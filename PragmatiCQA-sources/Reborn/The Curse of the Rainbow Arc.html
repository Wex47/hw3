   was appointed as the new officer in the future. While everyone else is arguing over the topic at hand, Mammon ignores all the commotion since they're solely focusing on Reborn's letter and the fact that they might have to tell Xanxus everything about the Arcobaleno curse. Because they are deep in thought, Mammon fails to see food being thrown at them, and as a result, the letter becomes heavily stained with food. They immediately excuse themself from the table so they can continue reading their letter. However, they cannot read the most important part of the letter due to the stain and their pride wouldn't allow them to ask other Arcobaleno for help. In the midst of their dilemma, Belphegor interrupts them and informs them that the Varia will go to Jura, France, to retrieve Fran. Knowing that there's a

Fran then tries to calm them down, which turns out into insulting them; Squalo about his hair, Chikusa about his skin, and Mukuro for his supposed 'pineapple reek', angering the three people further. Squalo questions if Fran recently hit his head, to which Fran answers that, according to his grandmother, he hit his head on a block of cheese, and claims that he cannot remember anything, which is his memories of the future. Knowing this, both Mukuro and Squalo turn to each other, and then attempt to shove the responsibility of taking Fran on one another. Squalo tells Mukuro that Fran is his disciple and he should be the one to take care of him, but Mukuro refuses and retorts that he's also busy and that the Varia should take Fran and cure him of his stupidity before he takes him back. Meanwhile, Mammon arrives at the Pacifier Spring and meets the other Arcobaleno, with the exception of Aria and Reborn. They then show their letters from Reborn and reveal that it is another one of Reborn's games, to gather them together to be able to read the entire message. Parts of the letters are purposely left illegible. By layering the letters on top of each other, the entire message can be shown. They then proceed to decipher Reborn's message, finding out the conclusion of Tsuna's battle with Daemon, the eight flame, and the Arcobaleno with transparent pacifier, surprising them. They feel like they have seen the Arcobaleno before, and the other Arcobaleno all have an idea as to who it may be. Back at the Kokuyo Gang and Varia's situation, they decide to use a game of ladder to settle it, with the loser taking Fran without holding any grudges. However, Fran interrupts and says that he wants to choose for himself, and pointed to one of the two groups, the chosen one being unknown.

After agreeing to this, they hear the bell for class to resume and return, but Tsuna stays behind and asks Reborn about the Arcobaleno. After dodging the question for a bit, Reborn admits that it's about time for Tsuna to know everything, after Tsuna has proven his growth. Reborn cut off that he will tell him if Tsuna wins the mimicry game at Chrome's welcoming party. At the party, Chrome thanks everyone for throwing it for her with the moral support of

   and Lal, who disappeared. They come to the realization that they are having the same dream. During their confusion and surprise, the man with the iron hat appears, causing them to try and attack him, but to no avail, as their movements are stopped and they can't move their bodies. The man explains that the reason for their immobility is that they were inside a dream, thus, they won't be able to use their Arcobaleno power. However, he assures them he didn't come to fight but to ascertain their determination, then make a proposition. The Arcobaleno are suspicious at this, until the man questions if they wish to solve the "Curse of the Rainbow". All the Arcobaleno, sans Reborn, answer in the affirmative. The man with the iron hat then reveals that he intends to decline the Arcobaleno's numbers by one; the strongest Arcobaleno's body will be reverted to its adult form. He further explains that they have to find a representative to fight for them. Reborn, however, says that they can't trust him, the other Arcobaleno agreeing with him. However, the man with the iron hat threatens to disappear and leave them in their infant bodies for the rest of their lives, which persuades all the Arcobaleno to agree. The dream then ends, leaving the Arcobaleno to find their representatives.

   Bermuda explains that the Arcobaleno are human sacrifices that Checker Face prepared to protect the Arcobaleno pacifiers. The pacifiers are cursed treasures that must never be destroyed and he selected the seven most powerful people of the generation and made them Arcobaleno to protect it since no normal human being is able to protect the pacifiers. However, the curse that was inflicted on the Arcobaleno resulted in a side effect for the Arcobaleno that would endanger the pacifiers. To prevent this, there's a pass-on pacifiers through generation to generation, either through contracting job or Representative Battle. Bermuda reveals that the Representative of the Rainbow is a trap that Checker Face set up to choose the next strongest seven and make them the next generation Arcobaleno and he had no intention to free the current Arcobaleno from their curse. Reborn questions what will happen to the previous Arcobaleno, to which Bermuda answers that they will be dismissed, but most of the Arcobaleno who had their pacifiers removed ended up dead or even if one does manage to survive they only have a cursed life, becoming a Vindice that desires nothing but revenge.

Reborn asks why out of all the Arcobaleno he chose him. Bermuda answers that Tsuna's miraculous growth through Reborn's guidance is what made him realize that he is different from the other Arcobaleno. He reveals further that he used to be an Arcobaleno that was deceived by Checker Face, but was able to resist when his flame was being taken by him and refilled the empty pacifier with a new flame,

Reborn then asks what will happen to the current Arcobaleno if Checker Face is killed. Bermuda reveals that they will die along with everyone that is involved with the Arcobaleno including Uni, Lal, and the Vindice since killing Checker Face means destroying the Arcobaleno system itself. Hearing this, Tsuna declares that they are wrong and he won't let them win the Representative Battle. Reborn decides to follow Tsuna's will, rejecting Bermuda's offer to join him.

Bermuda tells him to reconsider his offer and he will wait for his answer until the fourth day battle. Before they leave, Bermuda warns him that whether he rejects or accepts his invitation, he will go to hell either way. Not seeing any possibility that Tsuna will win against Jaeger, Reborn tells Tsuna that there's no need for him to die for the sake of the Arcobaleno. This frustrates Tsuna since usually he would punch him if he thought something as cowardly as that.

As Tsuna repeated the words of Bermuda to Talbot, Talbot commented that Bermuda is a tough guy. Tsuna told Talbot his idea to replace an Arcobaleno's removed Flame. Tsuna further elaborated by saying that Checker Face removes the Flames of the current Arcobaleno to create the new generation and that Bermuda had survived as a Vindice by forcing the Flame of Night, a Flame made of hatred and vindictiveness, into his empty Pacifier. Tsuna suggested that if the correct type of Flame is injected into the empty Pacifiers based on their owners, there might be a chance of the Arcobaleno surviving. Talbot compared Tsuna's idea to using blood as a transfusion for anaemic people. Tsuna questioned his idea's probability and after much contemplating, Talbot replied that it might be possible and disclosed that he had been doing research on the Pacifiers, finding them to be similar to both the Vongola Rings and Mare Rings. Talbot explained further, saying that what is transferred between Arcobaleno generations is not the Pacifier's soul but rather, the energy that is contained. Thus, even after the Flame is removed, if the right type of Flame is injected before the soul dies completely, the Arcobaleno's life could be prolonged. Tsuna interrupted excitedly but Talbot continued on and remarked that the process would not be so simple because the changing of the generations is also linked to the pacifier's lifespan. Talbot said that it is still worth a try because nothing is known yet and informed Tsuna clearly that if Bermuda were to win the Representative Battle, then all would be lost. Talbot told Tsuna to defeat Bermuda and stated that Tsuna is the only one who can accomplish this. Tsuna responded with a resounding yes.

Tsuna requests that Reborn gets on his shoulder, as he has something to tell the latter. Tsuna flies to Namimori Shrine. When they reach the shrine, Reborn asks why they went all the way there. Tsuna replies that he does not want to be discovered by other students and states that he is skipping school. Reborn comments that it has been a long time since that happened and asks Tsuna if he thinks that Reborn, as his home tutor, will allow his skipping of school. Hearing this, Tsuna shouts at Reborn agitatedly, wondering how Reborn could say that. Tsuna recalls the day when he first met Reborn and how Reborn showed up out of nowhere, claiming to be a tutor for training Tsuna to be a Mafia boss. Tsuna says that he felt like the days after had been a mess and rattles off things that Reborn had forced him to do that turned his school life into a disaster in the process. However, even after going through all of that, Tsuna says that in the end, he had fun and that he even felt happy to have Reborn as a tutor. Tsuna says that he was outraged when Reborn said that he never expected to die a decent death and angrily questions if Reborn is always thinking sad thoughts whenever he is by the former's side, even when he was having fun. Tsuna exclaims that Reborn is a failure as a home tutor if he has been behaving this way the whole time. Tsuna informs Reborn that this time, it is his turn to teach Reborn. Getting emotional, Tsuna is unable to complete his sentence and slumps onto the ground. After a few moments, Tsuna tells Reborn with conviction that he is not going to let Reborn die.

Reborn continues to say that his mission is to make him a splendid Tenth Vongola Boss and it would be pointless if he dies. However, Tsuna corrects him that Vongola Primo would surely say that someone that abandoned their friends cannot be entrusted with the fate of the Vongola, telling him that someone unwilling to risk death for the sake of their friends is not qualified to become Vongola Decimo, surprising Reborn. Seeing Tsuna's determination, Reborn admits that he wants to live longer and wants to die without any regret as he has gained the desire to see Tsuna grow more, requesting him to keep him alive, finally agreeing with Tsuna's plan, much to the latter's relief.

   After defeating Alejandro, the three move to their next targets. Receiving report that Alejandro was defeated and unable to sense their flames afterwards, Bermuda guesses that they're using some sort of barrier cover that protects their flames from being detected by him.

   After defeating Big Pino and Small Gia, Tsuna and his team decide to take a rest for a bit. Back at the park, Jaeger immediately defeats the majority of the elite team until Mukuro and Hibari are the only ones who are still standing and work together. Tsuna, and the rest of the team members arrive just in time to assist both of them.

   Checker Face reveals himself directly, much to the shock of everybody present. Realizing that they have known the truth behind the Representative battle of the Rainbow as well as the secret behind Arcobaleno Pacifiers, Checker Face confirms that it was true. When they question his presence, Checker Face reveals that he was merely hiding his presence with the
   Segno Ring
   as he opens his mask, revealing himself as Kawahira, surprising them. Kawahira then unleashes his flames, showing that they are on an entirely different level to defeat him as they are just normal humans. He reveals that he belongs to a special species who had lived on Earth before humans were ever born whose duty is to protect the planet Earth. However, the only ones of these species who are still alive in the present day are him and Uni.

  <p key="0a0f70b1-5f3c-4781-8429-7f38d745ef62">
   He explains that the Tri-ni-sette originally were not the set of 21 rings they all know but seven stones. When his species still had about ten people alive, they gave their flames to the seven stones. However, as their members died one by one until only five of them remained, they decided to borrow the humans' powers and thus, splitting the stones into Arcobaleno Pacifiers. When there was only him and Uni's ancestor, Sepira, as the only ones who were alive, they were unable to provide the stones with their own powers and thus, further split up the stones into the set of Vongola Rings and set of Mare Rings. Sepira gave the Vongola Rings to Giotto, while she kept the Mare Rings to be passed down within her Famiglia. Hearing this, Uni says that she never heard the story from her ancestor and Kawahira reveals that he and Sepira parted ways after their opinions differed with each other; while Sepira wanted to coexist with humans, he didn't.

  <p key="ed35de52-2a30-4273-9cd5-368c2b888480">
   Ending the talk, Kawahira demands for them to return the Pacifiers. Tsuna shouts that there must be another way to maintain the Tri-ni-sette without sacrificing the Arcobaleno's lives. Kawahira, however, replies that there's no other option left and warns Tsuna that he is the first one on the list to become the next Arcobaleno, something that Tsuna already prepared for. At this time, Talbot arrives, carrying seven jars and tells Kawahira that by using the jars, Arcobaleno Pacifiers are no longer needed. By using the Flame of Night within the jars, the flame is configured in a loop and by repeatedly passing through the warp holes, the seven flames of the sky would continuously accelerate, which replenishes their flames for basically half of an eternity. This method, however, requires Bermuda to keep continuously using his Flames. Everybody becomes skeptical as Bermuda only lives to get his revenge on Kawahira and they doubt he would accept the role to protect the Tri-ni-sette that Kawahira cares for so much. Surprisingly, however, Bermuda accepts the role as he thinks that they would have control over the Tri-ni-sette away from Kawahira. Hearing this, Kawahira is about to refuse, but Uni convinces him to accept as he won't live forever. Convinced that Uni has seen the peaceful existence of the Tri-ni-sette, Kawahira agrees to the term as he actually believes that if there's another method without sacrificing anyone, he would entrust the Tri-ni-sette to the future generations. They all gather around the jars and fill the jars with their flames at the fullest as Kawahira promises he will remove the curse.

   The Arcobaleno were all imagining themselves return to their real form, only to find Lal is the only one who returned. Verde concludes that the only part of their curse that has been removed is the part where they will stay as an infant and will never grow, which means it will take a long time for them until they return to their original form as they'll grow like normal humans do. They then go to the hospital to visit Dino and Basil. To avoid a ruckus, Tsuna and Reborn go to their rooms first. However, much to their surprise, Levi A Than comes out from the room with syringes all over his face, which he explains that Xanxus ordered him to take them all in his place. Squalo then approaches them with the rest of the Varia, reminding them that he also survived thanks to Mammon's immediate action to make an illusionary heart during the battle with Jaeger and would stay that way until they find a suitable heart transplant. Byakuran, along with

   destroy the wall of the room, greeting Tsuna. He explains that he also admitted into the hospital because Mammon created his illusionary organs for 10.000.000 yen per hour. This angers Squalo and Xanxus who are annoyed by the interruption, making Xanxus blast his gun, which they easily dodge, destroying the walls to the next rooms. From the destroyed wall, Hibari attacks and destroys the wall across, stating that he will bite them to death for disturbing his sleep with Hibirds all over him. From across the wall that Hibari destroyed, Mukuro and his gang emerge, startled by the sudden attack that made them accidentally foil their snacks. Since all of their rooms are all connected, Reborn suggests for them to start having a pillow fight, to which they respond variously that a fight would injure them more, causing some parts of the hospital to be destroyed. At the rooftop, Reborn thanks Tsuna for giving him another chance to live, which Tsuna answers that he won't be able to do it alone without his friends. Recalling Bermuda's decision to watch over the Tri-ni-sette to ensure that Arcobaleno won't be needed again, Tsuna begins to doubt his intuition as he first thought they were bad guys, but Reborn assures that he was right about the being bad guys before and his intuition is one of his merits that he should be proud of. Tsuna then remembers the man in suit who had helped him before in the battle against Bermuda and asks Reborn who he actually is. Reborn asks if he really hasn't realize yet, to which Tsuna replies yes though he is able to win thanks to him, as they continue to talk, ending the Curse of the Rainbow Arc.
