    illusions
   </b>
   . An illusionist uses their psychic powers to make their enemy feel, see, hear, or smell things that aren't there. Basically, every illusion is dealt through the mind. In the case of a first-class Illusionist, it's possible to even kill the enemy with illusions; for example,
   Chrome Dokuro
   created an illusion of lava erupting and
   Viper
   (Mammon) said that if they had believed it was real for one second, they would have burned. This proves, however, that if the enemy is aware that they are experiencing an illusion, it will have no effect on them and does not exist. Normal illusions take control of fear and force other people to be afraid.

   During the introduction of Mukuro's

   When two illusionists are going to fight, the role of an illusion is different. An illusionist will try to enchant his enemy with his illusion (this will mean controlling the enemy’s brain which governs their five senses). The enemy needs to survive by completely recovering this control and casting an illusion that will mirror the other illusion. The first one that has his illusion completely cast/returned by the opponent and be unable to recover their control completely will lose, and then they will be left to their opponent's mercy. For example, Chrome created an illusion of lava erupting, but Mammon wasn’t completely fooled and cast an illusion that the fire/lava would be turned into ice. Chrome, unable to recover, was turned into ice and slammed against the wall by Mammon as a result.

   Illusionists, or better known as spellcasters or technique-user﻿s, are the ones that cast illusions or psychic powers into the enemies' mind and thus, controlling their enemies' brain which governs their five senses, making them lose their perception and senses with things that aren't even there. Illusionists in general are said to be weak to physical pain.

   In conversation during chapter 336, it was hinted that illusionist have abilities to possess people; when Mukuro's body was possessed by
   Demon Spade
   ,

    Reborn
   </a>
   said that he for the first time heard of "an illusionist to have their body stolen by another illusionist while possessing someone." However, so far, the only people capable of performing this feat were Mukuro and Demon. This might be because it needs specific conditions necessary for it to work and even without any specific conditions, it's still an exceptionally difficult technique.
  </p>
  <p key="6c2c7707-d7f0-4bb9-8686-7aa01f53fbbe">
   It also seems that if an illusionist cuts off their attachment with their own body, the illusionist will become a living spirit with their illusions becoming stronger from time to time. Demon is, for now, the only one who is known to have done this for years. But to do this means that the illusionist must have a body to possess or else its spirit form will gradually disappear and the illusionist will finally die. How much power the illusionist would gain is dependent on the vessel they are possessing. According to Daemon, this action was considered taboo.
