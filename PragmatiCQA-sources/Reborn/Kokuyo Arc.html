   Kokuyo Middle School

   At the hideout, Hibari defeated several students and confronted the leader who claimed to be the new order in town. Hibari suddenly started to collapse. The leader commented that he had prepared several Sakura flowers as he knew of Hibari's weakness. He then started beating Hibari into a pulp. Unknown to Hibari,
   Futa

The Vice chairman of the Disciplinary Committee was then brought in wounded. Reborn noticed that he had four teeth missing and stated that they were targeting Tsuna. He explained that the number of teeth lost was a countdown of the strongest students at Namimori according to Futa's ranking.

   his dynamites

   his yo-yo

He was able to dodge again using mini bombs to propel himself towards Chikusa who dodged his attack. Gokudera threw Dynamite once more but included mini bombs in order to confuse Chikusa who was caught in an explosion. Tsuna then arrived to warn Gokudera, who (believing himself to have won) gave away Tsuna's position as the Tenth boss of Vongola. Chikusa revealed himself to be grievously wounded but conscious and attacked Tsuna. However Gokudera stepped in the way taking the attack and falling unconscious.

They were then joined by Bianchi and Yamamoto. Reborn claimed to know the enemies location. While back at home preparing, Reborn warned Tsuna that his other pupils had near death experiences while Leon was in his state. He also reminded Tsuna that he wouldn't be fighting as the orders were for Tsuna and that in his state Leon could only make one more Dying Will Bullet. The five then set out for Kokuyo Land.

   Upon arrival Tsuna remembered being brought there before when he was younger and was volunteered by Reborn to lead the way. Tsuna remembered being close to an exhibit of Flora and Fauna but couldn't see it. At that moment they were attacked by a pack of dogs, however they were revealed to be dead already. Suddenly a feral like figure pounced at Yamamoto knocking him to the ground which caved in. The figure then jumped into the hole after him. Reborn deduced that the Flora and Fauna exhibit had been buried under the dirt bellow them and that they would be unable to help Yamamoto without the exhibit collapsing around him.

   Down in the hole, although Yamamoto was ok
   the figure
   revealed himself to be one of the escaped inmates and put something in his mouth. He then ricocheted from wall to wall and attempted to bite Yamamoto who defended himself with his sword. However in the process the sword was broken. Ken then revealed that he was able to change his abilities to those of many animals by putting their fangs into his mouth. As a demonstration he activated his
   Kong channel
   and used his increased strength to throw Yamamoto. Ken then used his Wolf channel and while Yamamoto was unable to see him in the dark Ken was able to smell the blood of the dogs he had thrown at them earlier. Reborn noted that Yamamoto was being especially careful to avoid injury due to his love of baseball. Tsuna then blamed himself for bringing Yamamoto along to which Reborn kicked him into the hole. Ken instantly switched targets but was stopped by Yamamoto who threw a rock at the back of his head. Ken swapped to Cheetah channel and charged at Yamamoto dodging his second rock and biting his arm. However Yamamoto used this opportunity to strike Ken in the head using his sword handle leaving Ken seemingly defeated. Yamamoto then commented that an arm was a fine sacrifice to protect a friend. They then tied up Ken and climbed out of the hole. Yamamoto was bandaged and given a new bat. However Ken then revealed that he had been playing possum in case they tried to interrogate him but claimed that it wouldn't matter as Mukuro would defeat them all. Bianchi silenced him by dropping a boulder on his head. Reborn also showed the group a prison photo of Mukuro, who unknown to them looked nothing like the leader of the gang.

   Meanwhile Chikusa woke up at Kokuyo land and revealed to Mukuro that he had been in contact with the Vongola. Mukuro stated that he already knew and claimed that reinforcements had arrived. The group continued to travel until stopping for lunch. Suddenly an odd noise was heard and the food started to bubble and explode. After taking cover Gokudera threw Dynamite in the attacker's direction. However a girl in Kokuyo uniform with a
   Clarinet
   , emerged from the explosion unharmed introducing herself as
   M.M
   Bianchi then stepped up to fight and pointed out that the sound-waves from the clarinet creates vibrations that heat up the molecules within a target causing them to explode. Bianchi then charged at M.M. using her
   Poison Cooking
   as a shield. However M.M. revealed that the clarinet was also a Nunchuku and used it to knock Bianchi over. However, as she placed the clarinet to her lips in order to finish Bianchi off she realized that the clarinet had been poisoned. Gokudera then revealed to the others that Bianchi is capable of turning anything she touches to poison and that she had already touched the clarinet. M.M. then collapsed to the ground in disbelief.

   Bloody Twins

   Even so, she held back her punch. However Birds demands were not over as he produced a dagger and demanded that they stab Tsuna. Eventually Tsuna decided to do it himself, unaware that the blade was poisoned. However before he could stab his leg Dr Shamal appeared to aid Kyoko and Adult I-Pin and Lambo saved Haru. They revealed that they had both been ordered by Reborn. Shamal and I-Pin then defeated the Twins and before Birds could escape he was knocked unconscious by Gokudera. Reborn then revealed that he had always known about the others but wasn't aware they would appear as well. At that moment Bianchi noticed someone in the shadows and told them to reveal themselves. The person revealed himself to be Futa who (with a distressed voice) told Tsuna that he was staying with Mukuro and ran into the forest. Tsuna chased him but the others were stopped by a flying girder that blocked their path. The girder was shown to be thrown by a tall man carrying a huge ball and chain with his face covered.

   Meanwhile as he was looking in the woods for Futa, Tsuna ran into a Kokuyo student who claimed to have been held prisoner by the gang. Tsuna was unaware however that the student was in fact the gang leader. During the conversation he took a strange interest in Reborn and his abilities demanding information while revealing a strange symbol in his right eye. Tsuna was promptly spooked and ran off again giving the gang leader apparent amusement. Chikusa then appeared from the shadows and pointed out that Reborn must be an

   Meanwhile the man with the ball and chain revealed himself to be the Mukuro from the photo but claimed to be unaware of anyone named Futa. With great strength he began swinging the massive
   ball and chain
   through the air causing Gokudera to collapse due fear of being hit and the side effect of Shamals treatment. Yamamoto then stood up to fight but when Mukuro used a palm thrust to hurl the ball towards him Yamamoto found it impossible to avoid and was sent flying. However he stood up again as he had used his bat as a shield. Mukuro then used the same attack as before but Yamamoto threw up a cloud of dust allowing him to see the air currents and avoid the attack. Reborn deduced that the air currents were the result of the snake shaped groves in the ball that create a violent turbulence. Mukuro remained calm and this time threw the ball high in the air before thrusting it forwards with both hands and adding spin. As a result Yamamoto was dragged into the current and knocked unconscious by the ball. Bianchi then stepped forwards with poison cooking at the ready; however Mukuro claimed to have used less than thirty percent of his power.

   Tsuna finally arrived on the outskirt of the trees and upon spotting Bianchi defending the others shouted out to Mukuro but was too scared to approach him. Mukuro simply decided to finish of the others first and prepared to attack. Reborn then used the last Dying Will Bullet on Tsuna who held back the attack with his bare hands. Tsuna continued to avoid Mukuro's chain ball attacks and finally threw one of them back at him sending him flying into a pile of rubble. However Mukuro emerged with only minor wounds claiming that his true power was in hand to hand. Distracting Tsuna by throwing the ball into the air Mukuro struck with a number of attacks before placing Tsuna beneath the falling weapon. However Tsuna was still alive and rose from rubble claiming that Mukuro didn't have the will to kill him. Angered that Tsuna thought he knew him Mukuro struck out but Tsuna dodged the final attack and struck Mukuro again causing him to collapse on his knees. While returning to his normal self Tsuna explained that Mukuro had always used his weapon to finish his opponents as opposed to his bare hands and closed his eyes so he wouldn't need to see it. Tsuna thought that Mukuro was like Lambo as even though he was unreasonable you couldn't help but like him. Mukuro was surprised that Tsuna could see through his act but could see the Vongola's blood in him. He then revealed the shocking truth, that he was Mukuro's double who had been manipulated behind the scenes.

Gokudera used his smoke bomb to let Tsuna and the others went upstairs while he prevent Chikusa from chasing them. When Tsuna and the others arrived at the theater, they met the student who Tsuna recognized as one of the student who held captive. However, Bianchi realized that he is the real Mukuro that Lancia had told them. Futa suddenly appeared and stabbed Bianchi on her stomach with Mukuro's trident when she approached him. This shocked Tsuna who then attacked by Futa but able to dodged it and realized that he was controlled by Mukuro.

Futa stopped attacking as he cried and fainted, finally freed from the mind control. Tsuna then angrily asked what people are to Mukuro. Mukuro simply and playfully said that they were toys. This enraged Tsuna who then attacked him furiously but was unable to hurt him and instead he was the one getting hurt, and noticed there's a Dying Will Flame on Mukuro's right eye. The symbol in Mukuro's eye then changed and the ground started to crumble and made Tsuna panic but Reborn was able to get him back to his senses, realizing that it was only an illusion. Mukuro then explained about his power, The Six Paths of Reincarnations that he received from his past lives (In the anime, Mukuro said that his body had experienced the Six Paths of Reincarnations instead).

Hibari then threw Gokudera to the ground since he already paid his debt, and challenged Mukuro once again who was amused by it and accepted his challenge. The two clashed against each other but then Hibari's wound opened again, preventing him to move. Mukuro decided to end this and used illusions of Sakura trees again to make HIbari kneel. Hibari was seemingly beaten due to the illusions, but then when he was about to stumble to the ground, he attacked Mukuro on his stomach as Gokudera revealed that Hibari already got the cure for Sakura-kura disease and attacked him again, rendering Mukuro briefly unconscious.

Mukuro shows surprise as it was the first time someone saw through his possessions. Reborn remembered the gun that Mukuro used and concluded that Mukuro was using a forbidden bullet, the Possession Bullet, that was created by the Estraneo Family, and he asks how he had it because the information on its creation was destroyed.

Ken then shouts that Mukuro is the place where they belong and they won't let anyone to take it away from them. Tsuna who symphatizes with them after hearing their story says that he understands their feelings, but he also cannot let his friends be hurt because they are the place where he belongs.

   Suddenly, three men in black and bandages appear and chain Mukuro, Ken, and Chikusa. Reborn recognizes them as the protector of mafia law, Vindice. As the Vindice begin to drag Mukuro and his subordinates, Tsuna asks what they will do to them. Reborn says that they will be heavily punished, including the other convict who is still alive and Lancia and he also warn Tsuna not to get in trouble with them. After Vindice disappears along with the Kokuyo gang, the medical team arrives and immediately treats Gokudera and the others who were unconscious and wounded. Tsuna then feels a sudden pain throughout his body, which turns out to be the after effect of the Rebuke bullet and faints in exhaustion, followed by Reborn who decides to sleep after he praises Tsuna for being able to accomplish the ninth's order.

   One month after the battle at Kokuyo Land, Tsuna and his friends cheer for Yamamoto who plays in a baseball tournament. Gokudera threatens the team who is competing with Yamamoto's team that he will blow them up as he brings out his dynamite, and Ryohei cheers by persuading them to quit baseball and join his boxing club instead, which Tsuna comments that both of the choices are wrong. They are soon interrupted by Bianchi's arrival who carries her poison cooking box lunch and makes Gokudera faint after he sees her face. Haru also brings out her box lunch, but then Lambo takes it and he and I-Pin chase each other.

   Futa giggles at this as he says that he's happy because they were able to be gathered around like this. Tsuna smiles, also happy for it but is then interrupted by a sudden uneasy feeling and looks behind him but sees nothing. His attention is then distracted by Lambo's cry and Tsuna confronts him. Reborn then notices a young boy with his mother walk past behind him and smirks at him as he says that he seems lonely and he will take him on any time. The boy stopps walking and replies that someday they will meet again, revealing his right eye with the word "six" in it, revealing he is possessed by Mukuro. Reborn turns again to Tsuna and the others comforting Lambo and laughing together again, thus, ending the Kokuyo Arc.
