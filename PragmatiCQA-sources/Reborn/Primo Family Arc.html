   Colonnello told him that he could end up dragging himself down if his resolve is too firm. He then went to Namimori Shrine with the others waiting for him. Ugetsu appears and takes out his short swords which makes Yamamoto think it was a battle and he takes out his

   However, Yamamoto misunderstood this and wanted to finish his battle quickly. Ugetsu, having no choice, then unleashed Kuzuryuu Riverfall. Yamamoto manages to counter it with Blowing Rain but takes damage nevertheless. Yamamoto, still blaming himself, decided in his heart he won't make the same mistake again and he was going to stop being easygoing. Ugetsu used Kuzuryuu Riverfall again, but this time Yamamoto was able to dodge it and aim for Ugetsu's back but was stopped by Colonnello even though the attack nearly hit him. Even though Yamamoto won, Ugetsu announces that he had failed, saying he cannot allow him to inherit his power as the Guardian of Rain at Yamamoto's current state, much to Yamamoto's dismay. When Tsuna asked why he told Tsuna that he already knew the answer.

Gokudera then states that he vows to protect Tsuna even if he does not get the inheritance. Fon then asked if that was enough and if he could understand how strong their bond was. Tsuna asked what was going on and Fon explained that G wanted to see if his bond with Gokudera is unbreakable as that was the test. G said that one cannot serve as a right-hand man if the boss doesn't completely trust him but if their bond is firm, they could face any enemy that may come. Gokudera receives the inheritance and successfully completes the trial. After the test, Gokudera is happy that Tsuna finally accepts him to be his right-hand man (in truth, Tsuna actually just said that Gokudera was his important friend).

He goes on to say that Tsuna and the others must become the ideal heirs to the Vongola tradition in order to save the girls. His version of the Vongola is unparalleled strength and ruthlessness, enough in order to defeat any enemy, a heavy contradiction to the views of the other first-generation guardians. Not far from the building, Giotto and the other Guardians were watching from afar and commented that Demon had gone too far. Ugetsu suggested stopping him, but Giotto just told them to wait and watch since this is also part of the trial.

The group gets separated, with Gokudera manages to stay with Tsuna, and Ryohei manages to stay with Lambo, but Yamamoto is all alone. As all of them were surveying their new surroundings, a clone of all of them appears and starts battling them. Demon leaves openings in his attacks that can only be exploited if the guardians either cheat or sacrifice something. He tries to get them to win at any cost, in order to mold them into the type of people he desires them to be, but the 10th Generation guardians hold firm on their beliefs, and battle on.

   Tsuna says he is still nearby, Reborn agrees, saying Demon didn't have a body to begin with since it's only the will of the rings. Demon appears and tells Tsuna he does not intend to fight any longer as he realizes that he could not change Tsuna's mind. He instead, turns to Mukuro and wishes to ask him a question whom he referred to as the Mist Guardian. Mukuro responds to him that he despises to be addressed by that since he earns the title unwillingly. Mukuro continues saying that Tsuna is merely his target and that he will destroy the Mafia and control the world.

   Demon comments that Mukuro is better than the other guardians but he doesn't understand why he protected the girls. Mukuro answers that he only protected them because they are important to Chrome and he personally doesn't really care about them. Satisfied with the answer, Demon decides to deem him worthy of his inheritance but Mukuro says he isn't interested in the inheritance. He entrusts Tsuna with Chrome and changes back. Primo appears and says Demon did a good job before he gave his inheritance to Chrome. Primo then says that Tsuna has passed his test by staying true to his friends and guardians even after getting caught in Demon Spade's trap and grants him his inheritance. Shortly, elsewhere, Giotto once again met Demon and commented that he still kept the pocket watch that contain the vow of eternal friendship that they all share and he stated that he has not changed his mind, which Demon commented that Giotto is a forever fool and that's why he is disappointed him in the end, bidding Giotto farewell before going back to the Vongola ring, followed by the rest of the 1st generation Vongola guardians and Primo who also return into their rings. The next morning, Tsuna and his Guardians, Reborn, and Uni gather at Namimori Shrine to return to the future, ready to fight
