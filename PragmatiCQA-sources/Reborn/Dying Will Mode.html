   Tsuna first attained this form after Reborn shot him with a Dying Will Bullet, in order for him to confess his true feelings to Kyoko Sasagawa and later defeat
   Kensuke Mochida
   in a kendo match. During the
   Daily Life Arc
   , Reborn often made Tsuna enter Dying Will Mode as a way to train the boy and help him solve his problems and defeat enemies. The actions Tsuna performed in this form earned him the attention and praise of his classmates. This in turn, caused Tsuna to become more confident and befriend many of his classmates.

  <p key="60149ee9-8f6b-4011-a1dd-cc286e9c1aec">
   After being shot with the Dying Will Bullet for 10 times, Tsuna was afflicted with the incurable disease,
   Skullitis
   , which reveals the sufferer's deepest secrets before they die in a matter of hours. Reborn requests the aid of
   Doctor Shamal
   to cure Tsuna. Unfortunately, Shamal is shown to be a pervert and declines to help Tsuna, saying that he doesn’t examine guys. When Shamal tries to kiss Kyoko, Tsuna attempts to go into Dying Will Mode without the help of the bullet and is reborn with the dying will to protect Kyoko. However, after hearing the skulls reveal his secrets, Tsuna sits and cries, thinking that he is going to die as a loser. Shamal, however, feels pity for the boy and decides to cure him by having his
   Trident Mosquito
   give him Angel Disease, which is the exact opposite of Skullitis.

   "Mukuro Rokudo"
   himself. "Mukuro" easily defeats Takeshi Yamamoto, while Gokudera suffers from the aftereffects of his treatment by
   Doctor Shamal
   . Bianchi is nearly defeated as well, however, Reborn shoots Tsuna with the last Dying Will Bullet so he can defeat "Mukuro" in Dying Will Mode. After an intense bout, Tsuna emerges as the victor. Tsuna notes that "Mukuro" was not an evil person, and, because his heart was overcome with guilt, hesitated and always closed his eyes whenever he attacked his foes. "Mukuro" reveals that his real name is Lancia and he is a double that the real Mukuro uses to avoid showing himself. Before he can reveal Mukuro's true objectives, Lancia is attacked by Chikusa Kakimoto with poison needles. Despite having no more Dying Will Bullets, Tsuna resolves to obtain the antidote from Chikusa to save Lancia and face the real Mukuro.

With this new power, Tsuna is able to defeat the possessed bodies and Mukuro himself in combat, however, the Rebuke Bullet causes physical backlash on his body and Tsuna passes out due to severe pain. Afterwards, Leon becomes capable of producing Dying Will Bullets again, along with the new Rebuke Bullet.

   Basil
   , Tsuna, in his Dying Will Mode, intervenes and joins the fight. Squalo notices the symbol on Tsuna's gloves and, realizing who he is, plans to interrogate him. Tsuna attacks but is easily defeated by Squalo in a single blow. Reborn would have preferred for Tsuna to use Hyper Dying Will Mode, although, the last time he used the Rebuke Bullet, it gave him severe muscle pain for two weeks because his body wasn't used to the pressure. Tsuna and Basil are narrowly saved by the arrival of Dino and his men, and Squalo retreats.

   In preparation for the inevitable battle with the Varia, Reborn trains Tsuna by using the methods Vongola Primo used to master his gloves and Hyper Dying Will Mode. Using Dying Will Mode, Tsuna has to climb up the side of a cliff by himself.

   After completing this task, Tsuna spars with Basil using Dying Will Mode. Tsuna is easily overwhelmed by his more experienced opponent and is forced to improve his Dying Will Mode, increasing his time limit in the form and manipulating his Dying Will to increase his defense. These rapid improvements allow Tsuna to fight Basil to a draw.

Tsuna is surprised to see that the bullet has no effect on Ryohei as he always lives his life to the limit. Reborn is impressed with Ryohei and shoots Tsuna who is reborn with the dying will to reject the offer to join the boxing club. Tsuna manages to defeat Ryohei rather easily and Reborn invites Ryohei to the family. Ryohei is never shown using the form again afterwards.

   , Kyoko vists the Sawada residence, so Reborn can pay her back for buying his coffee. Tsuna’s mother, Nana Sawada then arrives and is surprised to see Kyoko with Tsuna. Misinterpreting their relationship, Nana asks her if it's hard to have her no-good son as a boyfriend and leaves before Kyoko can explain herself. As Tsuna apologizes to Kyoko, Reborn suggests that they play Russian roulette. Tsuna initially declines, thinking that they will be using real bullets, but agrees when Reborn shows them the party bullet. Kyoko volunteers to be first and shoots herself with the Dying Will Bullet that Reborn accidentally loaded. As Tsuna hurries to her side, Kyoko is reborn and heads downstairs to confront Nana while Tsuna and Reborn follows with her clothes. While accidentally destroying much of the furniture, Kyoko orders Nana to retract what she said earlier but ends up choking her, leaving Reborn with no choice but to use his Reverse 1 Ton hammer which forces the bullet to come out. Reborn explains to Tsuna the effects of the hammer and tells him that she would think of what happened as a dream. Later at her house, Kyoko is thinking of her ‘’dream’’ and it’s revealed that she tried to retract Nana saying Tsuna was a no-good son.

Fortunately, I-Pin has the antidote but its enough for only one person, forcing Tsuna to pick who to save. Because Tsuna cannot pick one over the other, Reborn decides to bet their lives with the Dying Will Bullet and shoots the two. Reborn says that this is first time he has used a Double Shot. Depending on the resonance of the Double Shot, the life force from the rebirth might become stronger. However, if their Dying Wills are not synchronized, they won't be revived into Dying Will Mode. As the group waits for something to happen, Kyoko and Haru are reborn and leave immediately with Tsuna, Reborn and I-Pin following. The two head to the bakery and gorge themselves on cake, showing that they regretted not eating more cake on their appreciation day. This forces Reborn to use his Reverse One Ton Hammer, forcing them out of Dying Will Mode and knocking the girls unconscious. Tsuna is forced to work in order to pay for the cakes that the girls ate. Later that night, the girls weigh themselves and see that they gained weight, causing their plans for next month's appreciation day to be cancelled.

   The last user of Dying Will Mode introduced in the series. Unlike most users, Basil relies on
   Dying Will Pills
   to obtain the Dying Will Mode. Basil is arguably the most skilled user of Dying Will Mode in the series. Unlike other users, Basil is able to retain his clothes and personality in this form and can maintain the form for much longer (During his fight with Squalo, Basil is shown in Dying Will Mode from night to the next day, showing his skill with form.)

   During the Varia Arc, Basil is attacked by Squalo on his way to deliver the
   Vongola Rings
   to Tsuna. Using Dying Will Mode, Basil is barely able to keep up with Squalo and fights him from night to day across Namimori. Eventually, their fight moves to a shopping center where Tsuna and his friends are. After swatting Basil aside, Squalo is challenged by Takeshi Yamamoto and Hayato Gokudera. Basil attempts to warn them that Squalo is too strong, however the swordsman easily defeats the two boys. Before Squalo can kill Gokudera, Basil intervenes and fights the Sword Emperor once more. Basil is quickly defeated and nearly killed, but Tsuna enters Dying Will Mode as well to save him. Unfortunately, Tsuna is much weaker than Basil in Dying Will Mode and is easily defeated by Squalo. Luckily, the two boys are saved by the timely arrival of Dino and his subordinates. However, Basil is so injured that he requires medical treatment.

   In a Dying Will Mode sparring match against Tsuna, Basil effortlessly dodges the young Vongola's attacks and conserves his stamina by increasing his power in short bursts. According to Reborn, Basil is several times stronger than Tsuna in Dying Will Mode.

  <p key="fe63dcf4-09c6-41e6-94dc-76e20286bdc3">
   On the fifth day of training, Tsuna is still at disadvantage against Basil, however, he extends his time limit in Dying Will Mode to six minutes and slowly closes the gap between them. These new improvements allowed Tsuna to nearly land a blow on Basil, who could barely block the attack, surprising the young CEDEF operative. However, Iemitsu and Reborn state that Basil could easily defeat Tsuna at full power. This is shown on-screen in the anime (off-page in the manga) when Basil effortlessly pummels Tsuna while fighting seriously. However, when Basil hits Tsuna with one last punch, Tsuna instinctively controls his Dying Will and raises his defense to decrease the amount of damage. At the same time, Tsuna locks his legs around Basil's hip and headbutts him, resulting in a double knockout.
