   Tsuna and his Family arrive at the area in Namimori at 11:50, where
   Shoichi Irie
   had set up their Vongola Base. As a storm cloud brewed,
   Byakuran
   's face appeared inside it. Unbeknownst to any of them,
   Gamma
   ,
   Nosaru
   , and
   Tazaru
   were watching from a distance.
Byakuran explained that they would need a kind of "ticket" to participate, mostly because it takes a lot of energy to transport so many people to the battlefield. They were asked to produce 5 million
   Fiamma Voltage
   , to which
   Spanner
   commented that is was 20 times the max output of the Hyper X-Burner. Byakuran said that they had 10 minutes or they were forced to forfeit. Tsuna declined, saying that all of his Guardians weren't gathered there yet.
  </p>
  <p key="e66c65e5-2cf0-4d54-9fed-9c1574b238dd">
   Byakuran showed he was serious about it when he destroyed a hill of Namimori with a beam from his eye. Reborn then said he understood how someone like Byakuran could rule by fear.

   Byakuran, although impressed by their Flames, mentions that not everything was taken care of yet, he then allows Tsuna to pick the field. Hundreds of cards flew out of nowhere and encircled Tsuna. Byakuran explained that in Choice, if they don't select the field and players first, the game couldn't be played. Tsuna picked a field card that read

   Hibari lighted his Vongola Cloud Ring, and upon seeing it, Kikyo commented that it was the same Flame type as his own. Hibari wanted to get started then and there, but Byakuran said that they still needed to make the next "Choice". He then pulled out the Gyro Roulette. Byakuran projected the Gyro Roulette images so everyone could see, it had eight crests on it: the 7 Flame Attributes and one blank Box. Byakuran placed his hand on the Gyro Roulette and instructed Tsuna to do the same. Byakuran explained that when he said "Choice", the Gyro Roulette would spin to the right. When it stopped, the selection was:

   The Non-Ring symbol for the Vongola, and the Sun crest for the Millefiore were ablazed with Flame. Byakuran said that the battle participants have now been decided.
   Byakuran said that the numbers next to the crests equaled the amount of participants from each Family for that attribute. He went on to say that the square symbol represented participants without Rings, of which Tsuna must select two to participate.
   Deisy
   suddenly appeared in front of Kyoko and Haru, and presented Kyoko with a wilted flower.

   just as suddenly pulled Deisy back to Millefiore and explained that he couldn't help himself when he sees things that "perish beautifully."
   Shoichi approached Byakuran, and persuaded him to count himself as a non-ring participant since he no longer has a Sun Ring. Shoichi then said that in addition to

    Reborn
   </a>
   satiated him by agreeing with the Choices. Then Ryohei has an angry outburst because he wanted to participate, but Shoichi said they just had to accept it for now. Hibari didn't care about the results, he claimed that no rules would stop him. However,
   Dino
   appeared, having snuck into the field because he was watching everything and reasoned with Hibari that after this was over, he could fight anyone he wanted to.
   Zakuro
   complained that the participant choices sucked, and Kikyo reported that Zakuro had lost his spirits. Byakuran announced that for the Millefiore the participants would be: for the Sun -
   Deisy
   , for the Cloud -
   <a href="Kikyo.html" key="a4e55e82-5609-43f8-84fc-545068c48e41" title="Kikyo">
    Kikyo

   , and for the Mist -
   Torikabuto
   . Basil called them on the fact that they lacked another Mist participant, Byakuran and Bluebell feigned surprise, and introduced their second Mist user,
   Saru
   , one of Torikabuto's A-rank subordinates.
   Then Byakuran decided that
   Target Rule
   was going to be the format of the battle. The Gyro-Roulette selected the Sun participant from the Millefiore and one of the participants without a Ring from the Vongola. The Gyro Roulette then selects Shoichi and Deisy by putting a mark on both of their hearts. The mark drains their Dying Will Flames, Reborn says that forcibly draining their Flames or "life" would eventually kill them. Byakuran considers this a time-limit to the battle. Although the mark shouldn't hurt the target in the slightest, but Shoichi doubles over in pain. Shoichi is willing to risk his life because he said that he's the one who made Byakuran the way he is, to which Byakuran says "So that's how you see it?"
   Byakuran says that not only can Choice now begin, but that they're playing for the three forces that "created the world": The
   Arcobaleno Pacifiers, Vongola Rings, and Mare Rings
   .

   The Cervello then instructed everyone to move to their respective Family's Base, if they were participating, or audience stall, if they were not. They had three minutes to do so. Yamamoto changed into his Vongola uniform (though, he needed instruction on how to tie the tie), and as soon as he finished, the three minutes were up.

   Back at the Vongola HQ, Tsuna's Family had revived
   Ryohei's
   tradition of a group huddle before a match. When Shoichi said that Tsuna and Yamamoto would be on offense team, and Gokudera would be on defense, Gokudera exploded that he shouldn't have been giving orders by him. But Tsuna agreed, so he swallowed his pride.
   Spanner
   and

   Gokudera
   ran through three different doors. They emerged riding their Motorcycles/Airbike away from the Base. Shoichi and Spanner then launched decoys that were replicating Shoichi's Flames signature.
   As they fly through the city, Saru detects these decoys. Kikyo praises Shoichi for creating the game with Byakuran, and orders
   Saru
   and
   Torikabuto
   to eliminate all the decoys until they find their targets.
Shoichi proceeded to give Tsuna, Gokudera and Yamamoto very specific instructions. Dino said that it was as if Shoichi had perfect vision of the whole field at his fingertips, Reborn responded by saying that Shoichi is the kind of guy you can count on in a crisis.

   Torikabuto saw Tsuna's dummy and destroyed it with a blast from his Mist Mare Ring which he kept in the palm of his hand, literally. Instantly, Saru and Kikyo detected a new Flame and then Tsuna appeared behind Torikabuto, and punched him into a building. When Tsuna wonders why it didn't shatter, the Cervello commented that due to the building were infused with Lightning Flames and the Lightning's

   if he can see anyone from his current position, the latter responds "no". Shoichi is so sure that the enemy is concealing themselves with Illusions, that he lowers the decoy so Yamamoto can reach with his sword. Yamamoto senses something, jumps off his bike, and charges toward the decoys, when one that is hit by an unknown weapon explodes into a pillar of thick vines.

Mainly because in his last battle with Genkishi, he thought he could win, but was utterly beaten. Yamamoto felt he shamed the blade and didn't do everything he could to grow stronger. So without that weighing him down, he's been able to train more effectively.

   Reborn comments that Yamamoto shares that decision with the First Rain Guardian, who threw away his passion for music to help his friend, the
   Vongola Primo
   . They even share the same Weapons, three short Blades and one long Katana.

   With the odds stacked against the Millefiore, Shoichi makes a plan. Tsuna and Yamamoto are to attack the Millefiore's Target, and Gokudera is to hold his defensive position. However, Kikyo was stronger then expected and was able to pass Gokudera (making his Sistema C.A.I. useless with his
   Bellflowers
   in the process). Tsuna appears to have a problem and is going in the wrong direction.

   After a while, Tsuna finally realises it isn't the map, but he was in
   Torikabuto
   's Illusion all along. He soon breaks out using his X-Burner and decides to help Shoichi and leaves Yamamoto with Deisy. However, he was too late and Shoichi was defeated. However, Yamamoto defeated Deisy at the same time too. The
   Cervello
   then explains that to make a Target be extinguished, the person's life force must be less than 2%. They then check if the results are legitimate. Both are legitimate, and they end in a draw, or so it may seem. Deisy suddenly wakes up with his marker lit. Kikyo then explains that Deisy cannot die, resulting in the Millefiore's victory. Byakuran demands the Vongola Rings as his prize. However, Shoichi claims his favor; in their last college game of Choice, Byakuran lost and promised a favor to Shoichi in their next game. Byakuran refuses the favor, but Uni emerges and proclaims that she deserves half of a share in the decision since she is the head of the Black Spell. After Byakuran refuses again, Uni leaves the Millefiore and joins Tsuna, bringing with her the Arcobaleno Pacifiers that Byakuran gave to her for safekeeping.
