   possesses the bodies of Hayato and Bianchi, as well as his subordinates, Ken and Chikusa in an attempt to defeat Reborn and possess Tsuna as well. Unfortunately for Tsuna, Reborn's pet chameleon,

    Leon

   , is unable to create a Dying Will Bullet in his current state and Reborn used the last one on Tsuna in order to defeat
   Lancia
   . As Mukuro's possessed bodies advance, Tsuna turns to Reborn for help but the Arcobaleno refuses and tells him to vent his true feelings to find the solution. Tsuna admits that he wants to defeat Mukuro. Suddenly, Leon glows brightly and Reborn tells Tsuna that Leon will finally emerge his wings. Reborn explains that when Leon goes through his cocoon stage, it means that his student is going to face a trial and that when he emerges from the state, Leon will disgorge a new item especially for his student after they have matured as well. Reborn explains to Tsuna that Leon disgorged a whip and
   Enzio
   for Dino when he was Reborn's student, much to Tsuna's surprise. Suddenly, Leon spits out a pair of wool mittens and the
   Rebuke Bullet
   . Reborn shoots Tsuna with the Rebuke Bullet, which brings out the calm fighting will and hidden awareness in him, and causes him to enter Hyper Dying Will Mode and his wool mittens to become the metal-clad
   X-Gloves
   .

  <p key="2c5ee7b8-7d51-4291-bb3a-c289f2d1a2a1">
   With this new power, Tsuna sees through Mukuro's illusions and easily defeats the possessed warriors. This convinces Mukuro to use the Fifth Path, the most dangerous skill of his
   Six Paths of Reincarnation
   , in order to defeat Tsuna. Although he was initially caught off-guard by Mukuro's enhanced physical abilities, Tsuna overwhelms Rokudo with the power of his new X-Gloves. Seemingly defeated, Mukuro tells Tsuna to kill him, saying that he would rather die than be caught by the Mafia. Naturally, Tsuna refuses and turns around, but Mukuro instantly recovers and binds his arms. Mukuro attacks Tsuna and sends him flying through the room, straight for the blade of his
   Trident
   . However, Tsuna uses his X-Gloves to produce flames from his palms and propels himself to safety. Tsuna then charges at Mukuro and defeats him by purifying his dark aura with his
   Sky Flames

   After exiting Hyper Dying Will Mode, Tsuna becomes crippled with severe muscle spasms and collapses from the pain. Reborn explains that the Rebuke Bullet places stress on the body and the result of using it is severe pain. According to Reborn, Tsuna suffered from severe muscle pain for two weeks after using the Rebuke Bullet for the first time.

   When the Varia's

   During the final match of the ring tournament, the
   Sky Ring Battle
   , Tsuna uses the Hyper form throughout to fight Xanxus. After a brief hand-to-hand fight, Tsuna pressures Xanxus into using his
   Dying Will Guns
   . The fight slowly shifts into the Varia boss's favor and he nearly kills Tsuna with a
   Scoppio d'Ira
   , which the boy luckily survives due to
   Dying Will Clothing
   (although his vest is destroyed). This convinces Tsuna to use his

   After clashing with the enraged Varia boss, Tsuna uses the Zero Point Breakthrough: First Edition to freeze Xanxus's hands before freezing his entire body, defeating him. However, Belphegor and Viper steal the Sky Ring from Tsuna and use the remaining rings to thaw out Xanxus. Xanxus takes the Sky Ring but is quick to cough up blood ad collapses. Sky Ring had rejected Xanxus, due not possessing the blood of Vongola. Since the Sky Ring rejected Xanxus, the
   Cervello
   declare Tsuna as the official Vongola Decimo successor.

   Basil gradually improves his control over the form and uses it multiple times in sparring sessions with Tsuna. On the night of the
