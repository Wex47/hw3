   Students from Tsuna's school started to get attacked by an unknown group, and Tsuna was assigned to find and to defeat them. When he found that the Gang attacked based on Futa's ranking of the strongest people in the school, he realized that Hayato was their next target. He quickly ran to warn Hayato, only to find him having already beaten Chikusa. Chikusa, having figured out that Tsuna was the Vongola Boss, quickly attacked; however, Hayato protected Tsuna causing him to get severe injuries. Chikusa continued to attack Tsuna, only for Takeshi to step in and forced Chikusa to retreat. They then took Hayato to the school hospital, and Tsuna blamed himself for not moving in time, forcing Hayato to protect him. Reborn then told him that the group was Kokuyo Gang, a gang that was exiled from the Mafia and had escaped from prison. Reborn then read a letter by the Ninth, which told him to destroy the gang or face death.

Mukuro then attacks, showing Tsuna is hopeless and outclassed until Hayato comes in with Hibari. Hibari then continues in Tsuna place, seemly defeating Mukuro, only for Mukuro to wake up, and shoot himself. Bianchi wakes up and attacks both Hayato and Reborn, with Reborn realizing that Mukuro shot himself with a special bullet, that allows him to possess anyone that has been cut by his trident.

   , but is stopped by Reborn, who is shot with the bazooka by accident. Tsuna expects to see the older counterpart of Reborn but is shocked to find out that Reborn had completely disappeared, not replaced with a ten-year counterpart. Tsuna remains curious on why an older version of Reborn didn't show up and assumes that Reborn would return after five minutes pass, though is proved wrong as a day passed without Reborn returning. Tsuna explains predicament to Haru and Hayato, with Hayato speculating the possibility that

   . The adult Hayato gives Tsuna instructions to kill a person named
   Shoichi Irie
   , in order to prevent the devastating future from happening, before Tsuna is given the chance to question why he's inside a coffin, the adult Hayato is quickly replaced by the fourteen-year-old counterpart that Tsuna is already well acquainted with. Tsuna explains to Hayato the information that he was previously given, and Hayato declares to kill Shoichi once they return back to the present, much to the discomfort of Tsuna who doesn't want to kill anyone. The two quickly realize that they've been in the future much longer than five minutes, and they should have already returned back to the present.
  </p>
  <p key="ec65eddb-dcf5-4a8b-ab06-c7b6f2cbc6ed">
   Much to their surprise, they do not return to the past after five minutes. Tsuna and Hayato soon come in contact with the future Vongola Famiglia, who are being slowly annihilated by a rival, the Millefiore Famiglia, and driven into hiding. It seems that the Future Tsuna ordered the destruction of the Vongola Rings, putting the Vongola at a huge disadvantage; most of the Famiglia's higher-ups and allies have already been eliminated.
  </p>
  <p key="466fa9f0-a443-4e47-817f-63995143e5a9">
   Motivated by a desire to prevent this Future from coming about, as well as to return to the Past, Tsuna is advised by Reborn to gather the Guardians, starting with the strongest Guardian

   . In the process, the Vongola battles numerous times with the Millefiore; while; fortunately, Tsuna learns how to use his Vongola Ring. His antics also alert the Millefiore to the presence of not only the existence of a young Tsuna being alive but the Vongola Ring's location.
Events soon conspire that transfer most of Tsuna's friends and Famiglia to the future, making it imperative to return to the past; in order to accomplish this, Hayato reveals it is necessary to defeat
   Byakuran
   , the head of the
   <a href="Millefiore Famiglia.html" key="74b5a5de-2064-48cf-8cc3-75cde297dd0c" title="Millefiore Famiglia">
    Millefiore Famiglia
   </a>
   , with the Vongola Rings. Thus, Tsuna and the Guardians, from the Past, undergo training to learn this Generation's unique style of fighting, using Boxes and Rings, in preparation for an attack on the Millefiore Base to be conducted in tandem with Vongola operations against the Millefiore worldwide.
  </p>
  <p key="cc0f7cd8-c7af-4089-b543-0e7ea72ac567">
   Tsuna's training with Hibari drives him near death, forcing him to undergo the Vongola Trial of Succession. Tsuna's declaration of his resolve before the former Vongola Bosses yields the ability to combine the power of the Vongola Ring with his X-Gloves, producing the X-Gloves Version V.R. (Vongola Ring); while more powerful, the Gloves are unbalanced and difficult to handle; however, Tsuna is able to use the Gloves' increased to power to develop a new technique, the X-Burner, before the scheduled raid on the Millefiore Base. During this time, Tsuna receives a vision, along with Chrome, about a circular white machine with Shoichi Irie standing in front of that seems to have something to do with traveling back to the Past. Tsuna also begins to become more accustomed to the idea of leadership; however, the Millefiore discover the location of the Vongola Base and attempt to ambush them in the middle of the night, forcing the gang to attack earlier than expected. Tsuna and company infiltrate the Merone Base, which they discover is conveniently led by Shoichi Irie. Although the group dispatched several Millefiore thugs, Shoichi Irie soon plays his hand and manipulates the placement of the Base's rooms to separate the group.

  <p key="73c8a1ad-1c71-4a1e-8c17-3e886fe5b8d1">
   Additionally, Tsuna is captured by a Millefiore technician,

   , after remaining behind as a decoy and defeating a force of Strau Moska robots. Surprisingly, Spanner does not kill him but offers to help Tsuna complete the X-Burner technique, on the grounds that he wishes to see it completed. Tsuna cooperates with Spanner after Reborn, who appears via hologram, urges him to; Spanner constructs Tsuna to use Contacts Lens to improve his X-Burner. Tsuna proceeds to use the X-Gloves to obliterate numerous Millefiore agents and obstacles, developing new Techniques, as he and Spanner, who is labeled a traitor, make their way to the control room to confront Shoichi Irie.

   Battle. Shoichi woke up to find out that they had lost. Tsuna didn't understand why it is so important to win even if it is for all of humanity. Shoichi then goes on to explain his past experiences and

   's power.
  </p>
  <p key="0f3c01b8-1b44-437a-bf89-0b8498cfb23e">

   Another big surprise is that Shoichi used a special bullet to put Future Tsuna into a death-like state and that he knew the only help to defeat the Millefiore was that the Past Vongola Decimo and his Guardians defeat them. Tsuna finally understands why they are the only hope, but it is too late. Byakuran demands the Vongola Rings as they had lost, but Shoichi asks for a rematch as the last time they played Choice, Byakuran had lost, failed to pay and therefore had offered Shoichi any condition that he wanted next time they played. Byakuran denies this had ever happened and rejects the rematch as Boss of the Millefiore Famiglia; however, the Sky Arcobaleno

When Byakuran continues to deny this, Uni leaves the Millefiore and asks Tsuna to protect her, to which Tsuna said that he will protect her. The gang then runs away and heads back to the Vongola Base.

   Byakuran
   showed up at the scene, revealing that all of the flames absorbed by Ghost has been transferred to him since Ghost is his parallel counterpart. With everybody exhausted from Ghost's absorption, Tsuna battles Byakuran alone. Tsuna seems to gain the upper hand, but Byakuran quickly overpowers him and nearly broke his neck, causing Tsuna to lose his consciousness.
  </p>
  <p key="3459f62b-6ddb-4987-85f1-49ec04f7424c">
   Through Reborn's encouragement, Tsuna regains himself and tells Byakuran that he didn't regret everything that had happened to him and would give his life to protect everyone. Therefore, he vows that he will defeat him. Responding to Tsuna's will, Vongola Primo and his Guardians appeared from the Vongola Rings and then explained that the Vongola Rings aren't at their original form and that it had its highest Flame output restrained so that it can be safely passed down to their proper successors. However, seeing that Tsuna has inherited his will and believes that Tsuna will know the true purpose of the rings, Vongola Primo changes the Vongola Rings back to its true forms. With his newfound power, Tsuna easily overpowers Byakuran, forcing Byakuran to reveal his full power. As the battle goes on, Uni was preparing to sacrifice herself to revive the other Arcobaleno. Tsuna tried to convince Uni out of it but she had already decided since there's no other way. Eventually, Uni, along with Gamma, sacrificed their lives to revive the Arcobaleno, leaving Tsuna and the others grief-stricken of their death.

  <p key="b5e15290-a9b7-4890-9397-a7ed7d34ae13">
   This enrages Byakuran who blames Tsuna for what happened, which Tsuna countered that it was Byakuran who made the world this way that caused Uni to sacrifice herself. Both of them then prepared to use all of their power, deciding to end the fight for good. Tsuna fires the X-Burner with full power, and after much struggling, finally incarcerated Byakuran without any trace. Despite the victory, Tsuna is depressed, wondering was their victory really worth the lives that have lost from the battle. The Arcobaleno then fully revived and assures Tsuna that with Uni's power over the Tri-ni-sette, all of Byakuran's actions will be negated and everyone who died will return, much to everyone's relief.

Adelheid asks Enma to test Tsuna, to which Enma responds by writing a letter to Tsuna, telling him that he had been captured by the enemy and asking for help. However, Tsuna never got a chance to see this letter, as a wind blew the letter away, leaving Enma alone and betrayed in an abandoned factory yard.

Enma revealed that the Sin was originally the Simon's and that they transformed with its power. Tsuna then goes into Hyper Dying Will Mode to fight Enma. He then goes on to explain that the Sin belonged to the Simon Famiglia and that it was the blood of their first boss.

This angers Simon and they make the declaration that Enma will inherit their Famiglia as the tenth boss and take revenge of the Vongola for pride and honor.

He told Tsuna that the power of the Simon Famiglia is not yet complete and it is only at a seventh of it of its full power.

Dino also expresses his guilt that he didn't fight with them in the first battle, and that he should stay nearby their school. Reborn, however, just tells him and Romario, whom he called over, to search for two remaining representatives.

   The group leaves Namimori Diner, and Tsuna is troubled, mentally commenting that he didn't want to return home to see his dad after such a devastating defeat to him. Takeshi, seeing his troubled state, invites him to go over to his house, as he had just bought a new baseball game. Hayato opts to go over to, just in case someone attacks Tsuna in the middle of the night, but expresses his excitement over Takeshi's sushi restaurant.

As class starts, Dino walks in and introduces himself as their new English teacher. On the balcony, as they regroup, Reborn states that they had to go get some "valuable intel". They head to a mansion in the middle of a forest where Reborn states that one of their allied teams knew some information about Team Verde. When they arrive, Uni greets them cheerfully, opening the door. Inside, she serves them tea as Bluebell and Nosaru stick their tongues at them, Uni mentioning that she had got to know them really well and that she hung out with them a lot. Uni explains that

Tsuna expresses his concern, but Uni tells them to fight for Reborn with all their strength, for two teams would be eliminated in the second day of the battle. Once more at Team Uni's rented mansion, Byakuran reveals that he had found a counter to Verde's machine, stating that they would fight genius with genius and machine with machine.

   All of Team Uni's members rush to their room, ready to fight, and Reborn notes that

Byakuran answers Tsuna's question that he was Team Uni's boss representative and flies out into the sky with his wings, Tsuna following him by entering Hyper Dying Will Mode, propelling himself with Sky Flames from his X-Gloves. However, the wristwatch announces the battle this time to be 30 minutes long as it commences the battle.
24 minutes and 30 seconds of the battle remain. Tsuna and Byakuran are up in the sky keeping a lookout for enemies. Tsuna questions Byakuran why he, who killed thousands in both the future and parallel worlds, was fighting with all his heart for a single Arcobaleno. Byakuran simply explains to Tsuna that he was like him back then in the future, willing to fight for Uni. As they are talking, Team Verde attacks. Tsuna flies to Mukuro and attempts to stop him but much to Tsuna's frustration Mukuro taunts him which causes him to lash out fiercely, still feeling insecure after the tragic defeat from his father.

Lal Mirch announces that Kikyo, Ken, and Chikusa had been eliminated, continuing to announce that although they were unable to confirm Gamma, Byakuran, Mukuro, and Fran's watches' destruction, they had all suffered injuries from trying to protect their watches. Iemitsu contacts Tsuna through his

As Tsuna, Gamma, and Reborn are all about to be hit, Byakuran intervenes, stating that they couldn't lose. Tsuna asks why, and Byakuran reveals that despite his dreams in the future, he was only awaiting death. He mentions how Uni became the warmth of his life and states that this time, he would be the one to protect her heart. Byakuran then tells Tsuna to charge and defeat his father.
Byakuran falls to the ground, heavily wounded and his Rainbow Wristwatch destroyed, signifying Team Uni's defeat. Tsuna rushes towards Iemitsu to avenge Byakuran, saying he will never forgive Iemitsu. Iemitsu tells Colonnello to leave this to him and to save his un-cursed time, and Colonnello states, "Present, stop" and wishes Iemitsu luck. Tsuna punches Iemitsu into the ground, but the latter kicks the former, sending him hurtling back. Iemitsu comments to Tsuna that he hadn't improved at all, but Tsuna, enraged, tells him to shut up and slams him into the ground again.

Tsuna recalls how Iemitsu left him and Nana in their house all alone, how he does when he returned, would only sleep or talk about meaningless things. Iemitsu, now sitting beside Tsuna, apathetically states that it was boring fighting with him. Tsuna exits

Iemitsu, meanwhile, doesn't respond and Tsuna repeats the question furiously, but Iemitsu still doesn't respond and tells Tsuna to take off his boss watch so that he could destroy it. Tsuna refuses, so Iemitsu lifts a boulder and hurls it at Tsuna. Colonnello and Lal Mirch shout out that it was going to crush Tsuna. However, Tsuna is saved by Reborn in the nick of time, who was in his curse-released time. Reborn shoots the boulder and destroys it into letters, spelling out the word "C-H-A-O-S" and they land around Tsuna. Iemitsu appears to be shocked, and Lal Mirch and Colonnello chorus in unison that there was only one person who could pull off a feat like that. Reborn, in his curse-released form, stands before them, with his hat shading his eyes. Tsuna asks Reborn who he is, not recognizing him in his adult form. Reborn looks at Tsuna with a hard expression and tells him that it was lesson time. Reborn easily heavily injures Iemitsu while in his un-cursed form, Tsuna being oblivious to the adult Reborn's identity. Reborn tells Tsuna two weaknesses of his for when he has to fight Iemitsu again. When Reborn runs out of his un-cursed form time, Tsuna is still oblivious to Reborn's identity when Reborn changes into his cursed form right behind a boulder. Reborn reminds Tsuna of his un-cursed form's lesson, which Tsuna takes into mind, and fights Iemitsu. Tsuna's skill and speed have suddenly improved, which Iemitsu notes, and Reborn mentally tells Tsuna to show him what his student was capable of.

Iemitsu comments that the battle was fun, angering Tsuna, who scolds him for taking the battle un-seriously. Iemitsu once again comments that Tsuna sounded just like Nana. Tsuna, despite that, tells him that he would win next time, Iemitsu responding with an "OK."

Hayato wonders where Reborn was, to which Tsuna answers that he was apparently meeting with the other Arcobaleno to discuss Bermuda. Suddenly, however, everyone notices an ominous Flame. As Reborn returns from the meeting, he finds Tsuna, Hayato, and Takeshi battling a Vindice member. As soon as Reborn reaches them, the Vindice vanishes. Afterward, Team Reborn's members discuss the day's events, and Reborn triumphantly states that he had found a new representative.
