   Jump Ultimate Stars has been changed slightly from the gameplay of Jump Super Stars. Jump Ultimate Stars gives battle characters the ability to dash and to do a new attack while guarding, which, instead of breaking the guard of the opponent, forces them to change characters, and can be identified by a green glow coming out of the character which executes it. Also, certain 7 and 8 panel koma (along with certain 5 and 6 panel koma) obtain a visual difference during battle as opposed to the appearance of the 1-6 koma of the very same character, some of this variations also bring a totally different set of attacks to the character (e.g. Naruto becomes Kyubii Naruto for his level 7 and 8 koma). Battle characters now have a new ability known as Ultimate Actions (UA). These UA are different for each character, as some recover health, other recover sp, while others can be used to dodge enemy attacks. Another new feature added is the Evolution Chart. This area allows players to upgrade their characters by spending gems(currency earned for KO'ing opponents) to buy a new koma. Each character has a chart, starting from the 1 block help koma and branching off into the 2 and 3 block Support and the 4 to 8 block Battle koma. Some characters have alternate block paths which unlock a different type for that character (e.g. Goku as a laughter type instead of a power type), while others can be used to unlock koma for characters from the same series, quizzes for the series, and new worlds in the story mode.
