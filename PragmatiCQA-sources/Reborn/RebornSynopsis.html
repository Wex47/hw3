   Reborn's past is shrouded in mystery, though it can be assumed that at some point in his life he had built the reputation as the world's strongest hitman, which had happened even before he met his fellow Arcobaleno. He was said to be quite close to first Arcobaleno boss,
   Luce
   , and at an unknown point in time, he began working for
   Timoteo
   .
  </p>
  <p key="da84f8b7-346d-47da-8569-35db8f311a6b">
   Reborn was cursed by
   Checker Face
   , transforming himself to an infant and given the Sun Arcobaleno Pacifier. After being cursed he enlisted
   Shamal
   in helping in "erasing' his past self and giving "birth" to him.
  </p>
  <p key="24d4237c-b84a-4292-863b-de4f29b89d74">
   Sometime after infliction of his curse, Reborn became the home tutor for Dino and trained him to become the Tenth Boss of the
   Cavallone Famiglia
   . He eventually left for Japan to train

  </p>
  <p key="bd1cff6f-78cf-443f-afb5-2dd62553a4fb">
   During an unknown point in his life, he became a famous mathematician, going under the name "Borin", and solved math problems that were previously considered impossible. Though, it's also possible that his "Borin" persona could have been a look alike. Reborn was previously in a relationship with four different women, his most recent lover being
   Bianchi

   Throughout the arc, Reborn mostly takes a mentoring back seat in the arcs, rather than the direct fighting; however, he can be credited with helping Tsuna achieve much higher levels and gain new, more powerful attacks. And he is shown wearing many costumes and appearing in his many hideouts. He is a known celebrity at

To get his revenge on Checker Face, Bermuda offered Reborn once again to join him. Reborn questioned why he choose him out of all Arcobaleno and what will happen to the current Arcobaleno if Checker Face was killed. Bermuda explained that he likes crazy people like him and witnessing Tsuna's growth through his teaching is what made him realized how Reborn is different from the other Arcobaleno. He revealed that if Checker Face is defeated, the current Arcobaleno, the Vindice, and everything that involved with it will die as killing Chekcer Face means destroying the Arcobaleno system itself. Reborn didn't mind dying, but he disagreed if Lal and Uni are getting involved with it. Tsuna, against the idea, declared that he won't let Bermuda win the Representative Battle. Hearing Tsuna's declaration, Reborn decided to follow Tsuna's will.

   However, Reborn immediately changed his mind when Jaeger single-handedly overpowered Tsuna, seeing no possibility for Tsuna to win against him and told him that there's no need for Tsuna to die for them, the Arcobaleno since this is the Arcobaleno's problem alone. He told Tsuna that he can return the boss watch whenever he wants to. Once they got back, he immediately called the other Arcobaleno except Skull to a meeting and told them everything that Bermuda had told him. The meeting ended in a huge argument when Reborn considered joining Bermuda since he wanted to stop the Arcobaleno system even though it would be at the cost of his life while Colonnello doesn't want Lal to get into this and Mammon and Verde refused to die because of Bermuda's scheme. Uni and Fon tried to mediate them, but Mammon used an illusion that accidentally hit Uni. They finally stopped arguing, took Uni to the hospital and parted ways without making up.
