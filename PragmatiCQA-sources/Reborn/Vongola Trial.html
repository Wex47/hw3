   It is unknown how the first Vongola Trials were like, seeing as though there were less bosses to appear in the formation they did, when Tsuna was given his new power by Primo. It is known that the will and time of each Vongola Boss is carved into the Vongola Sky Ring, allowing them to appear before the next Vongola Boss.

   Vongola Ring
   beams onto Tsuna's forehead, revealing all the past sins of the Vongola. The pain and tragedy of others cause him to suffer and cry, while all the former Vongola bosses appear around him in a circle, requesting he give into the "greatness" of the Vongola's history, as well as accept the sins of it.

   To the surprise of the former bosses, Tsuna states that he doesn't want the power of the Vongola Family, and if he was to inherit such sins, he would rather destroy it completely. This answer gained him Vongola Primo's approval, and before Tsuna could faint,
   Timoteo
   catches him, and shows all the bosses standing in two lines facing each other, with Primo sitting on a throne opposite from Tsuna.

   Between the eight bosses is the crest of Vongola, and after Primo accepts his long-awaited successor's resolve, all of the former bosses strengthen their flames and the symbol glows. As each boss turns to flame in another circle, Primo bids Tsuna farewell as the boy is consumed by the light, later to break out of Roll's sphere successfully.
