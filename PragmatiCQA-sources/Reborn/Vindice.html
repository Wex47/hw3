After he finished his story, he was about to take the pacifiers, but Talbot arrived with seven jars and proposed another way to keep the Tri-ni-sette to Kawahira without having any need for Arcobaleno. To do so, the Flame of Night possessed by Bermuda is necessary. Bermuda immediately agreed since that means they could take control over the Tri-ni-sette away from Checker Face's hand, fulfilling their revenge. After convinced by Uni to agree with Bermuda's terms and filled the jars with Seven Flames of Sky, Bermuda and the Vindice took the jars with them, protecting it for eternity so there wouldn't be anybody changed into Arcobaleno ever again.
