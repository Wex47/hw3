   Nana is Tsuna's mother. She is a kind woman and a good mother who sometimes displays a paradoxical lack of concern for her son. She is very much in love with her husband, but, like many characters in the series, is oblivious to both Tsuna's and her husband's involvement with the Mafia. Despite the dangerous situations she and her son always seem to be embroiled in of late, she curiously is generally unfazed. Similarly, as with both her husband and her son, she seems to be accustomed to caring for and not giving up on people who others see as lazy and worthless layabouts. Tsuna is often baffled and exasperated by his mother's obliviousness and overly welcoming attitude to anyone who comes to their house. Nevertheless, Tsuna loves his mother very much, always concerned that she may got involved in mafia business. During the Future Arc, Tsuna is worried sick for his mother when her whereabouts is unknown and prayed hard that she's safe from Millefiore.

   Iemitsu Sawada is another story altogether. He has been absent for much of Tsuna's life and is viewed by his son as a lazy slacker and a deadbeat dad, although ultimately his character comes off as outrageous, taking ludicrous jobs and wantonly distributing alcohol. Although Tsuna thinks very lowly of him, his father seems to have great respect and high hopes for Tsuna's future, since he is the one who suggested making Tsuna the next Vongola Boss of the Vongola Famiglia. Despite his worthless appearance, Tsuna's father has also steadfastly provided for his family for years and pulls strings behind the scenes for his son, as well as being the head of

   . And even though Tsuna thinks poorly of his father, he still cares for his well-being.

   Giotto is Tsuna's ancestor and the founder of the Vongola. Having been entrusted with his true will, Tsuna trusts Giotto completely and holds his ancestor in high regards. He stands up for Giotto when someone questions his actions, like when Enma told Tsuna about Giotto's betrayal of
   Simon Cozzato
   . He stated confidently that Vongola Primo was not the kind of person who would do such a thing. And during his fight against Demon Spade, Tsuna also fights for Giotto's sake, determined to defeat Demon for his betrayal.

   Hayato is one of Tsuna's closest friends and Guardians. At first, Hayato was considered a threat towards Tsuna, as he refused to accept Tsuna's status as being the tenth boss of the Vongola. However, after Tsuna saved his life despite him tried to kill him at that time, Hayato became devoted to Tsuna and aimed to become his right hand man. Even after his loyalty, Tsuna still considers him to be quite scary, and is unable to refuse Hayato's request at being his right hand man because of this. Tsuna is often flustered by Hayato's enthusiasm, but considers him to be his first friend and truly cares for him, such as him expressing his concern over the Hayato during his fight against

   , as the circumstances would have killed him, convincing him to abandon the

   Vongola
   , which unfortunately often leads to Tsuna being needlessly injured.

   When first meeting Takeshi, he admired him as someone that was greatly respected by many of his classmates. When the two first became friends, Tsuna saw Takeshi as one of the last bastions of normalcy in his life, which was otherwise dominated by violence and the mafia, especially as Takeshi continues to think that the entire situation is merely a role-playing game. Unfortunate for Tsuna, as Takeshi takes the "role-playing game" very seriously, and Tsuna often finds himself unwillingly dragged along by Takeshi's seemingly misplaced calmness and confidence.

   Tsuna definitely sees Takeshi as a true friend, albeit much more sensible than Hayato, and often shows a lot more trust towards Takeshi due to his kindness, not worry about his as much as his other friends. Tsuna is shown to truly care about Takeshi especially when injured during the Inheritance Ceramony, where he falls into a state of depression after his friend is hospitalized. Takeshi, likewise, views Tsuna as a friend, ever since Tsuna stopped him from commiting suicide. He generally accepts Tsuna as the Tenth Vongola, and is perfectly fine with following Tsuna's leadership.

   As Hibari is one of the most bloodthirsty characters in the series, Tsuna is often uncomfortable around him. At their first encounter, they fought with each other and Tsuna hit Hibari with a slipper while calling him a fool. Nevertheless, Tsuna generally feels more confident when Hibari is around, due to Hibari's deserved reputation as an excellent and merciless fighter. On the other hand, Hibari generally is aloof to Tsuna and initially thought of him as a herbivore. He mostly avoids Tsuna and the rest of the Guardians due to his dislike of "crowds," and views them as weak and not worth his time. However, in the Inheritance Ceremony Arc, before he fights Adelheid, he notices Tsuna making a 'boring face' due to the mental shock he received and tells him to watch his fight closely, which surprises Tsuna. This possibly means that Hibari has started acknowledging the current Tsuna. After he wins the fight with Adelheid, he says that "it is the sky that allows the cloud to move about freely." as further emphasis of his recognition of Tsuna. Considering that he is fond of small animals and acknowledges their will to survive, his description of Tsuna as a "small animal" may actually be a compliment.
  </p>
  <p key="35784cd0-652a-403d-b3f6-1e90cbfe77f2">
   Hibari's overall attitude towards Tsuna can be quite teasing and even friendly at times, such as when he told Tsuna that he likes to throw snowballs at people, which made Tsuna wonder why he hasn't been arrested yet. In the Future Arc, he is revealed to be the only Guardian and one of only two people (the other being Shoichi) that Tsuna confided in his secret plan, something that surprises even the present-day Hibari himself.

He is often roped into fights alongside Ryohei, leaving Tsuna wondering how he could be Kyoko's brother. However, Tsuna values him as a good friend, referring to him as an older brother. Tsuna also shows reluctance whenever Ryohei fights, due to how his injuries could affect Kyoko. Ryohei admires Tsuna's potential and more than often tries to drag him into joining the boxing club. He trusts Tsuna both as a friend and as a boss, but this doesn't stop him from being mad at Tsuna should Tsuna drags Kyoko into mafia business, though he understands Tsuna has no choice.

He does not see Mukuro much of an enemy and worried whenever bad things have occurred to him. Tsuna is also the only person to know of Mukuro's good side and thus, always be the first one to doubt whenever everyone feels Mukuro doesn't care about his comrades. Mukuro, despite his great hatred towards Mafia, doesn't seem to hate Tsuna that much and even trust him enough to protect his subordinates. However, Mukuro always brushes off any sign of concern Tsuna shows for him as his goal to possess Tsuna's body remains unchanging, often pointing out how Tsuna's foolish naivete would do more harm than good for him.

Tsuna looks up to Dino, seeing him as a reliable senior and older brother, even after knowing how clumsy Dino is without his subordinates around. If something happened, Tsuna would listen to Dino's advice. Similarly, Dino sees his old self in Tsuna and immediately regards him as his younger brother, often referring him as his "cute little brother". Dino is the first person outside Tsuna's inner circle to approve of him as the next Vongola Boss, and boldly takes his side during the Ring Conflict despite the consequence that will befall to him and his Family should Xanxus win the match. Dino whole-heartedly believes in Tsuna's potential to become Vongola Decimo, and so, willing to do his best to help Tsuna in any way he can.

   They are not on good terms, Xanxus hates Tsuna and has never openly acknowledged him as the true successor of Vongola, which is why he and the Varia only take orders from Timoteo. He was the only one who refused to attend Tsuna's Inheritance Ceremony. The mere mention of him being defeated by Tsuna during the Sky Match is enough to greatly enraged him to the point manifesting his old scars. Tsuna was at first scared of him and thought that he should be the Vongola boss instead of him. However, this changed after he realized what kind of person Xanxus is, especially what he did to Timoteo, and became determined to prevent him from succeeding the Vongola. After the Ring Battle, Tsuna remains wary of Xanxus and prefers to stay away from the Varia boss. However, despite this, whenever the Vongola are attacked by outsiders, they are willing to put aside their differences to work together and as stated by Xanxus, the Vongola always fight as one.

   Tsuna and Byakuran started off as enemies because of what Byakuran had done to the Vongola and its allies. Tsuna has shown his desire to defeat Byakuran at all costs numerous times and his resolve only deepened after Uni sacrificed herself to revive the Arcobaleno and Byakuran insulted her actions. This angered Tsuna so much that Tsuna killed Byakuran without hesitation, a very rare thing for him to do considering Tsuna's dislike of killing, making Byakuran the very first person Tsuna ever killed. Byakuran has also shown his annoyance over Tsuna's interference in every parallel world.

   However, in the present, they are on better terms, since Byakuran has had a change of heart. He even offered Tsuna an alliance with his team and protected him when Tsuna was almost hit by Collonnelo's attack. It is unknown whether Tsuna has fully forgiven him or not for what he had done in he future, but Tsuna is able to sense that Byakuran's concern for Uni is sincere, and starts to consider him as his comrade. Tsuna was concerned when Byakuran was injured by Colonnello's attack, prompting Tsuna to promise that he will defeat his father. Sometimes, Tsuna finds Byakuran's cheerful attitude to be odd and admits to not knowing much about him. According to Uni, Tsuna and Byakuran are similar in a way both of them don't understand.

   Enma has demonstrated in multiple ways that he is similar to Tsuna; likewise, Tsuna thinks of him as a good friend. However, after Tsuna unknowingly failed the test he had set up, their relationship became strained, making Enma believed that Tsuna is no different from the cruel Vongola bosses. After Enma and his Famiglia stole the Vongola Sin, their relationship worsened, as Enma claimed that he would never forgive Tsuna and would no longer have any hesitation to kill him. Tsuna stated that he is also angry at Enma for making his friends suffer, and also for insulting Giotto, but he also sympathized Enma's past and current condition, as he still regards him as his friend. After witnessing from the fourth and fifth keys that Cozzato was never betrayed by Giotto and saved Enma from Demon Spade's control, they reconciled, becoming friends again. Not only restoring their friendship, this incident also deepened their trust towards another, as Enma stated that he believes Tsuna would never betray him.
