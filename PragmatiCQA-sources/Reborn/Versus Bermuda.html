However, Reborn reveals that his purpose is to shot just one bullet. After saying "Come die in an instant," Reborn fires at Bermuda but the latter dodges. Tsuna seem to have caught onto something, recalling the past from Reborn's word. The bullet makes a turn, surprising Bermuda. It hits Tsuna just as he realizes that the bullet is the

   Flames engulf Tsuna's entire body and he tells Bermuda that he is ready to die in order to defeat him. Bermuda recognizes Tsuna's mental state as the last stage of the dying will. Tsuna questions if he is in the same state as Bermuda when he created the
   Flame of Night
   , which Bermuda affirms. Bermuda recalls that when he was lost in despair, he had become an epitome of vengeance towards
   Checker Face
   . He further explains the Flame of Night was born when pure dying will without the slightest hint of hesitation had consumed his body. However, Tsuna begs to differ and thinks that his dying will originates from hope. Bermuda shouts that it is nonsense and appears behind Tsuna. Before he can land a blow, Tsuna punches him. In disbelief, Bermuda attempts the same move, but the result remains unchanged. Tsuna explains that it is possible because he is using his dying will. Bermuda unleashes a barrage of attacks on Tsuna, which he does all.
