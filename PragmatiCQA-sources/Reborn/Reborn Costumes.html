    claims that it was boring in the house. As a result, Reborn comes in this suit, the suit's name being a pun on words in Japanese. "Bikkuri" means "surprising", and "big kuri" means "big chestnut". Reborn uses this costume to spy on people who use trains for long-distance commuting. People are scared of the spikes, so nobody bothers him. The costume was actually made by Bianchi when she was in elementary school for home economics class. The one who touches the spikes would go to heaven in 30 seconds, as claimed by Reborn himself. Reborn appeared as this costume again when Tsuna, Dino, Yamamoto, and Gokudera went to Death Mountain.
