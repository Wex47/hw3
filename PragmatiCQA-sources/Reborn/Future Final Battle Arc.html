   Tsuna and the group return from the past, having received their Inheritance from the
   First Generation Family
   . While waiting nervously for the inevitable battle to begin, Tsuna and the gang try to act as they always have. However, Byakuran and the
   Six Funeral Wreaths
   finally arrive in
   Namimori
   .
   Zakuro
   finds the base almost immediately. Squalo decides to hold off Zakuro to buy the group time to escape. As the group leave the base, they hear explosions from within the base. Squalo has been defeated. Having very little choice, the group make their way to a place Haru mentioned to hide.
   Kawahira
   shelters them, and even drives off the Wreaths, but the group knows that the battle has only just begun.

   Deisy ends up at Namimori Middle High School, where he is up against Hibari and Dino. The Vongola have the early advantage and are easily able to keep Deisy at bay.
  </p>
  <p key="905ea47d-468d-4408-b0c1-010d48b27169">
   However, Deisy releases the Wreaths' secret weapon, the
   Asura Box
   .
  </p>
  <p key="0c753c46-6530-4f88-b94c-e2f938e8ef6e">
   The Asura Box changes Deisy dramatically. He grows scales, a frightening hairdo, slitted eyes, and a much more fearsome and confident attitude.
  </p>
  <p key="8a4eafc7-6900-438b-9738-bf0ffddc8ae5">
   Deisy and Dino face off in a heated battle.
  </p>
  <p key="903a7ac8-bce9-4118-844a-f1f6f914af76">
   Deisy manages to defeat Dino's
   Pegaso Super Salto Volante
   and now heads for Dino himself. Dino, preferring to fight without Box Weapons, doesn't seem too concerned. He lights his whip with
   Sky Flames
   and releases his most deadly attack, Salto Volante Veloce Come Luce. This move releases a barrage of attacks with no visible blind spot, effectively leaving the enemy no chance to evade.
  </p>
  <p key="503fa112-1fa9-4429-a6ee-c27d10093a3d">
   Deisy, however, does manage to evade all the attacks, chanting the correct directions to move into as he does so. Dino finally realizes that Byakuran would have seen this attack in a parallel world, analyzed it, and given the Wreaths information on how to evade it if they ever face it. Dino is struck by Deisy, and now, with Dino at Deisy's mercy, Deisy moves in for the kill.
  </p>
  <p key="e66629fb-b74f-4357-9aa6-30074db75bde">
   Deisy is slammed into a wall by Hibari. Hibari kicks Dino out of the way and prepares to fight Deisy. He releases his Cambio Forma, which turn out to be handcuffs. Deisy, seeing this, seems pretty confident, and the battle begins.
  </p>
  <p key="f6a7f43c-d73c-4053-a435-0960ea956745">
   The two engage in a high intensity brawl.

  <p key="08e9c95e-0fb4-4a78-8088-2bc9613a66cb">
   Kikyo explains the extent of Ryohei abilities, and points out, that although powerful, he'll only be able to use this technique for three minutes. A frown from Ryohei confirms Kikyo's observation.
   The battle between these two rival Guardians continue. Ryohei holds his own against Kikyo's Spinosaurus army, but due to them multiplying time and time again, doesn't make any progress. Soon the fatigue starts to tell on Ryohei as his time limit draws to a close. Ryohei's once white gear, turns black, and his wounds start to reopen. An exhausted Kikyo realizes that Ryohei was feeling the side effects from the super active flames. Kikyo, now confident, goes in for the kill.
   Basil decides to help Ryohei, but Kikyo warns Basil, that while Basil was injured, he had suffered virtually no damage thanks to his ability to propagate. Kikyo then looks in the other direction and asks someone to come out of hiding. The group turn to see what Kikyo was referring, and see's
   Hibari
   .
  </p>
  <p key="e07ee972-465e-49a6-9745-27c57a1723de">
   Kikyo ask's Hibari why he hadn't joined the fight. Hibari responds that his school's boxing captain didn't appreciate interference. Kikyo commends their friendship, but says that he follows a different set of rules, one where anything goes.
   Suddenly a Spinosaurus emerges from the ground and bites Hibari's left arm. Kikyo bids Hibari farewell as a horde of Spinosaurus heads towards Hibari. Hibari, commands
   Roll
   to defend. Roll immediately complies, forming a defensive shield in front of Hibari. However more Spinosauruses erupt from the ground, pinning Hibari, while the others break through Roll's barrier. Hibari attempts to defend with his
   tonfas
   , but is struck down by these dinosaurs. A bent tonfa emerges from the wreckage as the group scream in concern. At the campsite, Tsuna notices a familiar sensation.

The battle had been drawn to where Kikyo was battling the Vongola group.

   Bellflowers
   .
   As the smoke from Kikyo's attack clears, two people can be heard talking to each other. As a frog like head appears, the person wearing it sounds a bit surprised as he comments that the other took a step forward during that last attack, and complains that, that person always wanted to be the center of attention. A pineapple like hairstyle slowly appears, the owner of this hairstyle asked with a sinister laugh, what on earth the latter was talking about, and simply comments that, that person's head was blocking him.

   One by one, opponents that the Wreaths thought they had defeated emerged. The Wreaths, couldn't believe what they were seeing, and slowly they begin to realize that the people they thought they had defeated, were nothing more than
   Illusions

   Bel seems annoyed at the fact that Fran used illusions to show the death of the Vongola, and questions him about the necessity of it, Fran explains that illusions are like pranks, and they were just adding a bit of reality to the situation, Mukuro cuts Fran's theory down, and explains that the Illusions served two purposes. One, to get him warmed up, and two, that by giving a sense of superiority to the Wreaths, they were successful in learning about Kikyo's underground attacks, and Bluebell's defensive barrier.
   Fran faked ignorance at this, which pissed Bel off, and he asks Fran how much longer he was going to keep up the illusion of Mukuro. Fran, then reveals, that Mukuro had managed to escape from Vindice Prison, and so, the Mukuro standing before them wasn't an illusion, but Mukuro in the flesh.

   At the Millefiore base, Byakuran comments on the ongoing battle, and comments that everything was going according to plan. He tells the person in front of him, that his time will be coming up as well. The person he was talking to, was the last Funeral Wreath
   Ghost

   The newly commenced battle between the Vongola and the Wreaths had picked up a notch, and had become fiercer than ever. Xanxus fights on level footing with Kikyo, Zakuro is taken on by both Ken and Chikusa, and Bluebell battles the opponents that she though she had defeated moments before. Both sides battle on level footing with no side having a clear cut advantage. Ryohei and Gokudera,

This thought is interrupted by a sudden static noise, and a flash of green lightning. The very ground trembles as a new foe enters the battlefield. The fierce battle that was taking place simply stopped, as the very ground trembles with every step that this new foe took. The Vongola wonder who on earth this new opponent was, but they weren't the only one's panicking. The Wreaths themselves seem intimidated by this sudden arrival. Kikyo says that this happened too early, and Zakuro and Bluebell seemed too intimidated to even speak. Ghost has arrived in the battlefield.

   Confusion reigned over the

   Ken Joshima

   Chikusa Kakimoto

Zakuro, as his flames are being absorbed, thinks to himself that since Open Asura Box turns their bodies into Box Animals, their very life energy was being sucked away, Zakuro dodges beams heading towards him, and proclaims that it doesn't matter which side anyone was on, they were all going to die.

   A little away from this battle for survival,
   Chrome Dokuro
   makes her way towards Mukuro, she sees these light beams between the trees, and wonders what they were. She had little time to think however, as a light beam shoots out through the tree's heading straight for her.
   As the beam was about to make contact, she was pulled to the ground by none other than Mukuro. Chrome seems suprised by the person who saved her. Mukuro tells her that this area was dangerous, and compliments her on being able to survive for so long. Chrome, still seems a bit surprised, but soon tears fill her eyes, as she say that she's glad. However she soon faints, leaving Mukuro in a slight bind.
   From between the trees, yet another light beam approaches, this time targeting Mukuro. However, a Box Weapon is opened, and takes the blow instead. This Box Weapon turns out to be Fran's, and his box turns out to be a
   miniature Bel
   .
   Fran makes another one of his cheeky comments, as his Flame, as well as the box's flame drains away. Fran ask's Mukuro to help him, Mukuro saying that they need to first figure out what they were fighting, takes the
   Vongola Ring
   from Chrome's finger, calls out to
   Mukuro the Mist Owl

   Cambio Forma

   The Mist Owl turns into

   Mukuro finds out that Ghost was not even a living organism, but a supernatural phenomenon.

   However, the rest of the group were more reluctant, saying that Tsuna going would be equivalent to him throwing his life away. Reborn, tells Tsuna, that it would be his decision to make. Tsuna looks around at the group around him, and finally, puts on his

   Dying Will Pills

   Kikyo, now thinks back to the time Byakuran had first mentioned Ghost. It was in a meeting hall, where Kikyo and Byakuran were alone discussing the new, and final Funeral Wreath. Kikyo is startled by Ghost's looks, noting that he looked exactly like Byakuran. He asks Byakuran whether or not he should treat Ghost as his double. Byakuran then reveals a shocking bit of news, that Ghost was not just a person who looked like him, but in reality, Ghost was him.
   Byakuran explains that he thought bringing in another "him" would make things easier, so he decided to bring a parallel version of himself to aid him. But, this came at a very high price. Even by using cutting edge technology to help with this process, Byakuran had ended up destroying an entire world to make this possible.
  </p>
  <p key="20da9db8-5b05-42c8-89ea-942201ab3938">
   Ghost arrived, with some semblance of a human, but had become a mindless mutant that absorbed Dying Will Flames from everything and anything in the process.
   Soon after Ghost's arrival, Byakuran had sent him on a test run, to get a better understanding of his abilities. Ghost had ended up destroying three battle ships in this trial, but was arrested by the
   Vindice
   for killing a virtuous mafioso in the process. Though he had lost Ghost in this trial, Byakuran knew that he would be able to get him out if the need ever arose, but more importantly, because of this trial, he had discovered that Ghost possessed a very unique talent, a skill that would be, what Byakuran called "My Power".
   Kikyo wonders, that when Byakuran mentioned Ghost's talent, whether he meant Ghost's ability to absorb flames. He tries to figure out why, the Byakuran who had saved them from misfortune, would send Ghost when he knew that they themselves would be caught up in Ghost's power. Kikyo wonders helplessly if Byakuran had abandoned them, knowing that at the rate things were going, even he would die.
   Basil throws his
   boomerang

   Ghost having absorbed so much of Flames seemed to be growing more powerful. Mukuro points out that Ghost had appeared out of nowhere, as if he had teleported, and now that he had become powerful by absorbing so much flames, it would be possible that he would teleport straight to Uni. The group realise that things look bad, till a voice states that he won't let that happen.

   Zero Point Breakthrough: Revised

   Tsuna heads towards Ghost, both opponents trying to absorb each others flames. Tsuna and Ghost clash in an explosion of Sky and Lightning Flames. While Tsuna clashes with Ghost back at the campsite, Uni gets an uneasy apparition. Ghost cries in agony and

   Dino
   points out, that the power of Zero Point Breakthrough: Revised, was to absorb enemy flames and make them your own, but after absorbing Ghost's flames, Tsuna's flames hadn't changed, it still remained the same.
   This realization starts to dawn on the rest of the watching group as well. They start to wonder, why Tsuna's flames hadn't increased, even though Ghost had absorbed most of their flames. An uneasy feeling sets in, as Tsuna wonders what on earth happened to the flames that Ghost had absorbed. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a familiar voice greets the group.

   Xanxus doesn't take to kindly to these words. He calls out to Byakuran, and tells him that he, by no means works for Tsuna, and shoots him with his

  <p key="4deeba55-2ac2-4620-b11f-595e64339f0b">
   However, Byakuran emerges from these attacks completely unscathed. He asks the two attackers, what was up with those weak attacks, comments that they all look tired, and then says that he cant blame them since Ghost had absorbed most of their flames, and therefore the group before him, are basically running on empty.
  </p>
  <p key="cd3ed055-c885-4a7c-bef0-159477aafb66">
   This comment doesn't sit well on the two attackers, and they challenge Byakuran to prove that they are not to be underestimated.

  <p key="793148a2-bd35-40cd-bdd4-03c24f1ad21d">
   Byakuran laughs off Tsuna's statement, and asks Tsuna whether he knew why he had shown up when he did. With a dangerous look in his eyes, Byakuran states that the reason was that his body and spirit were finally ready. Tsuna counters this statement by saying that he has been ready for a long time, and disappears.
   Tsuna reappears right behind Byakuran. Byakuran turns around in shock and is greeted by a kick to the chin. Byakuran had a look of astonishment on his face, as Tsuna grabbed his head and knee's it, everyone looks on in surprise as Tsuna seemed to be dominating Byakuran.
   Lal Mirch
   wonders when Tsuna got this strong, Mukuro thinks to himself that this was the Tsuna who was summoned from the past and grew after experiencing the many battles he had faced in the future. Allies now look on with confidence, as their boss was dominating. Tsuna goes on the attack once again as Byakuran, was helpless in midair. He looks to once again land a punch on Byakuran, bit this time was stopped by Byakuran. The astonishing fact was not the fact that the punch was stopped, but the fact that Byakuran only used a single finger to stop him. Byakuran smiles playfully, and this time it was Tsuna who was astounded.
   Byakuran wouldn't budge even though he was only using a single finger.
  </p>
  <p key="c26f714e-118a-458d-9a4e-ffd30cc12a1d">
   Tsuna wonders just what kind of strength Byakuran had, to be able to stop him so easily. Byakuran, still smiling, asks Tsuna if that's all he has, and then with a dangerous glint in his eyes, says that its his turn now.
   Byakuran uses a technique he calls
   White Finger
   .
   Sky Flames
   emanate from Byakuran's ring, and passes on to his finger, and Tsuna is immediately blow away by a powerful shock wave. Gokudera and Yamamoto scream in worry as Tsuna crashes to the ground. Byakuran had finally begun his attack.
   The impact of Tsuna's crash could be seen and heard all the way to the Vongola campsite. Everyone looks worried as the see the dust rising from the impact zone. Even Reborn thinks that things look bad.
   The power of Byakuran's technique had made Tsuna create a large crater where he crashed, and Tsuna seemed down for the count. Gokudera and Yamamoto pleads to Tsuna to hang in there, and Tsuna, gets up very shakily. Byakuran looks down at Tsuna and tells him that he cant have him dying from just that.
  </p>
  <p key="92708f86-9b5e-4c94-93e3-8c81f0126af9">
   He then makes a statement that shocks everyone around, he says that he's only using a tenth of the Flames he had absorbed from Ghost.
   At this moment another shocking development happens. From the scars on Byakuran's back, a pair of
   wings
   had started to grow. As the wings grow, Byakuran states that all the Flames Ghost had stolen, now belongs to him.
  </p>
  <p key="9f27c1e0-1a51-45f5-bc1d-c1eb6dda01b4">
   The realization of what Byakuran had just said starts to sink in. But not everyone was convinced. Dino questions the truth in Byakuran's statement by saying that he had never heard of someone taking flames from someone else without any contact. Byakuran laughs and explains that Ghost was never another person, but a different version of him from a parallel world.
   Absolute shock greets this statement. The fact that Byakuran had bought another version of him from a parallel world was hard to believe for the watching group. But Byakuran says that whether they believe it or not didn't matter, but the fact remains that Ghost had the ability to absorb flames, an ability which Byakuran lacked, and then transfer it to Byakuran. Mukuro then puts everything into clearer terms. If it was true that Byakuran had acquired the flames of everyone present, with the exception of Tsuna, then his power couldn't be measured.
   The focus now shifts onto Byakuran's wings. Levi A Than states that it's probably just for show, but Bel states the possibility that the flames were probably packed together so tightly that they look like wings. But Byakuran states that the wings weren't just merely flames, but a symbol, a symbol to show that he had gained power greater to that of a human. Dino and Squalo yell at Byakuran, asking him if he thought he was a god, but Kikyo says that Byakuran wasn't a god, but a devil.
   Byakuran was interrupted by Tsuna, who tells him it doesn't matter what Byakuran was, or what kind of powers he had, he would still be taken down.
   Byakuran tells Tsuna that that was the spirit and both Tsuna and Byakuran started to release their flames. The intensity of these two rival bosses releasing their power, was such that the very air began to crackle. Byakuran tells Tsuna that he came to play, and that Tsuna had better entertain him.

  <p key="ab1568cc-acc1-4031-a6c8-7ffe9aca3409">
   The members at the camp see this new development, and Reborn tells everyone that the real battle was about to begin. Uni thinks to herself that she had better hurry.

   Tsuna takes off and immediately lands a punch on Bykuran, and he flows it up by a barrage of punches to the same area. But even through all this, Byakuran just smiles and tells Tsuna that it tickles.

   Tsuna realizing that his punches were having no effect, backs off to create a bit of distance between the two. Byakuran smiles, asks Tsuna if he was finished, and begins to prepare his own attack.

   Byakuran's palm glows with the golden Sky Flames, he tells Tsuna to play with his pet, and then Byakuran's very hand turns into a

  <p key="baff0607-529d-4ee5-aa44-6eb45b31b0be">
   Tsuna wonders how Byakuran's hand could turn into an animal, but then he notices an open box hanging from Byakuran's clothes. This was his Box Animal.
   Byakuran sends the White Dragon to attack Tsuna, and Tsuna immediately opens his own
   box
   and goes into
   Cambio Forma
   , Modo Difesa,
   Mantello di Vongola Primo
   to defend against this attack.
  </p>
  <p key="1b82a9a3-fcc8-4a9c-a8ad-22bc4ec950fb">
   Nuts and Tsuna successfully manage to hold off the Dragon, but Nuts seemed a bit shaken. Byakuran tells Tsuna that he was holding back most of its power during its previous attack. He tells Tsuna that he's the only person to have this kind of box, and then says that the next attack would go right through him.
   Byakuran sends the White Dragon to attack Tsuna once again, Nuts lets out a snarl, but Tsuna tells him not to be baited. The Dragon heads for Tsuna, and this time, did manage to make a connection. When the flames clear, Tsuna had caught the Dragon and immediately used his
   Zero Point Breakthrough
   to freeze the dragon.
   Tsuna now heads for Byakuran, telling Nuts to begin Cambio Forma, Mode Attacco as he does so. Upon hearing this, Tsuna's allies wonder if Nuts can turn into a weapon other than Vongola Primo's Cloak.

    Vongola Primo

   focused all of his flames into his fist for an ultimate attack, his
   gloves
   would actually change form. His allies then begin to realize that Tsuna focusing all his flames into a single attack would be a punch as powerful as the
   X-Burner
   . This new weapon is called
   Mitena di Vongola Primo
   , Primo's gauntlet.
  </p>
  <p key="ef9e07db-5a4b-49c2-87a1-64c931965b2a">
   Tsuna charges towards Byakuran with the Gauntlet in hand, but Byakuran, for his part didn't even budge. He simply looks at the weapon, says that he'll be able to see how strong Tsuna was, and asks him to bring it on.
  </p>
  <p key="059de721-b47d-4156-a5f4-6414db6305fe">
   Tsuna seems surprised that Byakuran wasn't attempting to avoid it. Tsuna now looking frustrated, thinks to himself that Byakuran was screwing around and continues his charge. Once he gets close enough, he releases a technique he called
   Big Bang Axle
   towards Byakuran. Byakuran didn't move as this technique gets closer, he simply puts his hands together and
   claps
   . And then, much to everyone's shock, Tsuna's technique, said to be as powerful as the X-Burner, simply vanished.
   Byakuran, laughing, says that the Vongola Box has been defeated. Tsuna and his allies couldn't seem to comprehend what had just happened, so Byakuran explains. He says that the technique he used was the ultimate defensive technique,
   White Applause
   . He says that, that technique had the power to shatter any technique. He then talks to Tsuna, he asks him if Tsuna had ever been this outclassed in a battle before, he asks Tsuna if he was afraid, and says that he shouldn't feel any shame in being scared, after all, even if Tsuna was a Mafia boss, he was still just a middle school student. He charges towards an intimidated looking Tsuna, charging his Sky Flames as he does so, and says that Tsuna is even welcome to wet his pants.
  </p>
  <p key="4bfd9041-b147-452a-b823-0012aa08a6f4">
   Byakuran lands a vicious punch on Tsuna, that sends Tsuna crashing to the ground. Tsuna seemed pretty hurt, but he manages to get to his feet as Byakuran lands next to him. Byakuran acknowledges Tsuna trying hard, but then launches his next attack.
   He makes a grab motion with his hand, even though he was some distance from Tsuna, but some kind of
   hand
   erupts from Byakuran's hand, and grabs Tsuna. Tsuna was completely immobilized, as his allies cry out in worry. Byakuran tells Tsuna that he can stop now, as he makes a squeeze motion with his palm, and immediately the giant hand which had grabbed Tsuna begins to squeeze him. Tsuna looked in absolute pain, as Byakuran continues the torture.
   Byakuran
   continuing to crush

   with his
   Transparent Giant Hand
   technique. Byakuran expresses his disappointment in Tsuna, saying that he expected Tsuna to put up a better fight, and points out that the size of a person's Flames is equivalent to the resolve of the said person. He tells Tsuna that this could only mean that Tsuna's resolve about wanting to return his friends safely back to the past, was extremely weak.
   This statement makes Tsuna think about all the people who had been dragged into this vicious battle from the past. Tsuna's desire to defeat Byakuran and protect his friends grow, and Tsuna, once again lights his
   Vongola Ring
   with
   Flames

Uni calls out desperately, and her allies looked extremely worried. They soon realize that she was heading towards the battlefield, towards Byakuran.
   At the battlefield, Tsuna's allies realize that none of their attacks had any effect on the now expanding barriers. Soon they notice another barrier floating towards the other two, and much to their disdain, they realize that the person inside that barrier was none other than Uni.

   Byakuran greets Uni in his usual sinister, yet carefree way, Tsuna, now finding it hard to put two words together, asks her to stay back, Uni calls for Tsuna in concern, but is greeted by Byakuran's sinister laugh. Byakuran begins explaining the nature behind this phenomenon. He says that when the Tri-ni-sette Sky Elements release an incredible amount of flames, it creates the unique situation they were in now. He says that it's a special stage where the three of them wont be interrupted, that its a stage for the Tri-ni-sette Sky elements alone. He then says quite casually, that now that Uni was summoned, he no longer had any use for Tsuna, so soon, it'll just be Uni and him, and once again begins to crush Tsuna.
   Uni begs Byakuran to stop, Byakuran glares at her, and asks her how she could tell him to stop at this stage. He starts to blame Uni for everything that had happened, saying that it was her that had forced the Vongola Members to risk their lives to protect her, even when Uni herself knew that they had no chance of beating him. He says that her pointless escape, only served to increase the number of casualties that the battle had produced. He says that she couldn't be any more selfish than she had been.

   Uni listens to Byakuran's speech, looking to be in pain as Byakuran continues to taunt her. While Byakuran was doing this, something glowed under Uni's cloak. Uni tries to hide it, but Byakuran had noticed, and his eyes had an excited glint as he asked her what that was.

  <p key="bb861929-62ba-408a-b2da-ebbf3c1c8f97">
   Uni whispers "not yet", which once again catches Byakuran's notice, and although Uni tried to protect whatever it was that she was hiding, the objects soon wriggled free, and fell to the ground.

   These items turned out to be the Arcobaleno Pacifiers, but there was something strange about the Pacifiers, all of them had something sticking out of them.
   Reborn and

   arrive, and Reborn explains that the
   Arcobaleno
   were beginning to regenerate their bodies, or in other words, they were being reborn. This information takes everybody by surprise, the fact that the strongest babies were being revived, was something nobody expected.
   Reborn explains that he had heard that the Sky Arcobaleno had the power to restore the other Arcobaleno from the verge of death, but even he admits that he had no idea that the Arcobaleno would be revived from their own Pacifers. Upon hearing this, Bel shows a bit of relief that
   Mammon
   would be revived, and
   Lal Mirch
   seemed happy that, if everything goes according to plan,

   too would be revived.

   then realizes that the real reason that Uni had escaped, was to buy time for the Arcobaleno to be revived. For this reason, she escaped from the Millefiore and begged Tsuna to protect her, and the pacifires of her brethren. Soon they realize, that if the Arcobaleno were to be revived, the balance of the Tri-ni-sette would be restored, and if the Arcobaleno at full power join forces with Tsuna, defeating Byakuran could become a reality.
   Uni, tightly holds on to the Pacifiers, and Byakuran after thinking for awhile, realizes that there was no
   Non Tri-ni-set Policy
   around to torture the Arcobaleno, and does admit that it would be annoying if they were revived, but Byakuran, quite sharp to notice, points out that he at least had an hour before the Arcobaleno can return. The look of surprise from Uni confirms that Byakuran's observation was accurate. Byakuran, now realizing that he was right, makes a squeeze motion with his palm, and Tsuna, who was still caught by Byakuran's Transparent Giant Hand, lets out a cry of agony, as the sound of bones breaking echoes across the battlefield.

   Tsuna's eyes lose the color they gain when he enters

   Tsuna's friends scream as Tsuna collapsed. Byakuran, completely ignoring the now motionless Tsuna, tells Uni that she can call whoever she likes, and he still won't lose, but says that would be a complete waste of his time. He points out that no one could enter the barrier they were in, and says that Uni was his now. He tells her that the Arcobaleno wasn't going to be enough to defeat him.
   Reborn, surprisingly agrees with Byakuran, a comment which surprised both Byakuran and Uni. But Reborn continues, saying that the Arcobaleno aren't the ones who were going to defeat him, that job belong to his student, Tsuna.

   Haru
   immediately sees a person lying motionless on the ground, and much to their disbelief, they realize that it was Tsuna. They stare at the motionless figure, unable to completely comprehend the situation.
   Byakuran grins and asks Reborn whether it was Tsuna who told him that he would be the one to beat him. Reborn confirms this, and Byakuran scorns at Reborn, asking him if he had been paying attention to anything that had happened and points out that he had already crushed Tsuna.
   Reborn tells Byakuran, not to underestimate Tsuna, Reborn then turns his attention onto Tsuna, and starts speaking to him. He tells Tsuna that he had to defeat Byakuran, but still, Tsuna remained motionless.
   Mukuro looks at Reborn and thinks back to his battle with Tsuna, and thinks that what Reborn was doing, was the same thing he did back then. He notices that whenever Tsuna was in a pinch, Reborn always appeared to guide him, and encourage him.
   Byakuran laughs at what Reborn just said, and says that he thought that Reborn had more of a point to make, but the fact that all he did was give a motivational speech came as a surprise. Reborn tells Byakuran that that's how he rolls and turns his attention back to Tsuna. He tells Tsuna that he wasn't the only one putting everything on the line in this battle. He tells him that Uni plans to send everybody back to the past by sacrificing her own life.
   Reborn explains that the revival of the Arcobaleno takes more than Uni's power, he says that she had to burn her "Life Flame", and this will lead to the destruction of her body, and result in her death.

Byakuran goes onto say that, if Tsuna hadn't been bought to the future, he wouldn't have had to suffer as much as he did, and tells Tsuna to curse has own fate for everything that had happened.
   Tsuna surprises everyone by denying Byakuran's theories. Tsuna explains that, although the future had bought him great fear, pain and worry, and although he was only truly happy for a short period of time, he understands that you have to take the good with the bad, and says that he considers everything that had happened to be precious moments in his life.
   Byakuran, who didn't seem impressed, tells Tsuna that his was of looking at things was certainly an interesting interpretation, but that Tsuna should realize, that none of what he said will matter, once he kills him.

   Byakuran, completely ignoring what was happening outside, wonders a bit, and decides, that at Tsuna's current state, sending the Mini White Dragon through the heart would be enough to kill him. Tsuna, who was out of Hyper Dying Will Mode, and so had his original personality, panics, and asks Byakuran to wait, Byakuran, however, doesn't wait and throws the Mini Dragon right at Tsuna. The attack hits him straight at the heart, and Tsuna, as allies watch stunned, falls.

   Byakuran laughs at the fallen Tsuna, and savoring the moment, turns to Uni and tells her that her savior is now dead. But he is proved wrong by a loud scream.
   Tsuna gets up, screaming that, that attack hurt. As allies watch relieved, Tsuna rips his shirt, and looks at the Mini Dragon. The attack had been stopped by something given to him long ago, as a token of gratitude from a friend Tsuna had saved. It had been stopped by the very Ring that
   Lancia
   had given him after the battle for the position of boss with the Varia,
   Lancia's Boss's Ring
   .
   Tsuna see's the ring that had saved him and begins to realize that everything that had happened up till this point had played a part, and led up to everything he's done. He says that he wouldn't give up a moment which he had spent in the future, the pain, the suffering, the fun, none of it. Tsuna realizes that he was here now because of the people there for him, whether it was
   Kyoko

Tsuna questions what Byakuran had said about him being unlucky, and says that he was wrong, because he felt extremely lucky, he says that he treasures every moment he had spent since he had come to the future. Tsuna finally says that his flames could only have been born in this world, the world Byakuran rules. Tsuna's Wool Mittens light up, and he continues saying that Byakuran had hurt many people, and Tsuna, now back in Hyper Dying Will Mode, promises to make Byakuran pay for all that he has done.

   miracle of the Vertical Space Time-Axis.

   elements. She says that a song had been engraved to her memory since birth, "The Sea knows no bounds, the Clam passes down its form from Generation to Generation, and the Rainbow appears from time to time before fading away." She explains that Sea means Mare, Clam means
   Vongola
   , and Rainbow means
   Arcobaleno
   , and the song represents the different natures of the three Tri-ni-sette elements.
   Uni goes on to explain that the "Sea" which represents the Mare means that the Mare Rings hold the power to move horizontally among
   Parallel Worlds
   . The Vongola have the power to pass down their traditions, from the past to the future, and finally the Arcobaleno never stay in one spot, and appears as points of the Space Time Axis.

   Byakuran doesn't believe Uni's story, pointing out that he got the ability to peer into Parallel Worlds before he got the Mare Ring. Uni however, tells him that this only happened because the Mare Ring had already chosen Byakuran as its rightful bearer, just as Giotto had chosen Tsuna as his rightful successor.
   Giotto, who had patiently listened to the conversation between Byakuran and Uni, now turns his attention to his descendant, Tsuna. He tells Tsuna that he's about to unleash him, and explains that the Vongola Ring that Tsuna wears has yet to take on its true form. He explains, that, to preserve the strict process of succession within the Vongola, the Vongola Rings were
   divided into two
   , with one set going to the current Vongola Boss, and the second going to the external advisor. However, Giotto explains, that to do this the power of the rings had to be sacrificed to compensate for the division, which meant that the Vongola Rings flame output, was weaker than its Tri-ni-sette counterparts.

  <p key="61f0ff88-e8ce-413d-af59-ea70f5f88945">

Byakuran screams in pain, as he's hit by the technique, but Tsuna wasn't done yet. Using his amazing speed, Tsuna appears behind Byakuran, grabs his

   to try to petrify Byakuran, but Byakuran manages to duck underneath the attack, only to be met by a powerful elbow from Tsuna.
   As Byakuran was sent flying, he regains his balance, and uses another version of his box animal, the
   Black Dragon
   . Two of these dangerous beasts emerge from Byakuran and heads straight for Tsuna, but Tsuna manages to avoid these dragons, gets to Byakuran, and launches another punch, forcing Byakuran to defend.
  </p>
  <p key="b1d7c8ec-a27f-4919-8fdd-d49a5c6cdc42">
   Tsuna taunts Byakuran, asking him if this was all the power he had, saying that he had only just begun. Byakuran grins in his same excited manner, and tells Tsuna, that if Tsuna had just started, then he hadn't even begun. Byakuran's wings grow larger, and from it emerges dozens of claw like figures.
  </p>
  <p key="e2d0fff9-26b9-4f78-9bc4-75327b69f035">
   As it heads towards Tsuna, Tsuna uses his Sky Flames to cut them down, but then realizes that the now severed claws were heading straight for Uni. But instead of hitting her, the claws simply bounce off Uni, who was now covered in a mass of Sky Flames.
  </p>
  <p key="36151aec-a94c-4b47-a178-d41281b3ff56">
   Tsuna stares at the Uni, wondering about the incredible amount of Sky Flames surrounding her. Byakuran seemed to understand what was happening, and comments that Uni has now begun feeding her Flames to the pacifiers, Byakuran looks at Uni with a serious expression, and asks her in a grave tone, if she was seriously going to sacrifice her life to the pacifiers.
   Uni’s friends couldn’t believe what Uni was planning, they try to talk her out of it, to stop her from sacrificing her life, Kyoko and Haru in particular were in tears telling her to stop her, but Uni had a sad yet determined expression on her face, her mind was set.
  </p>
  <p key="66a79c5c-1918-4736-8eea-318547011277">
   Tsuna calls out to Uni, telling her to stop, telling her that they’ll find another way, but Uni responds to Tsuna in a sad tone, telling him that this needed to be done in order to send Tsuna and the rest safely back to the past, and also, in doing so she would save countless lives. She continues in her sad tone, that she finally has the power to use her power for good, saying that this was the only gamble she could take, a moment which she couldn’t avoid, she tells them that this was her fate.
  </p>
  <p key="a9c0a9f9-43ec-4aa8-9086-55bfa730b704">
   Tsuna looks both sad and reluctant at this statement, he looks at Uni and tells her that he can’t accept her reasoning. An unlikely person agrees with Tsuna, but for different reasons. Byakuran rushes to Uni with a fierce expression on his face, he agrees with Tsuna’s earlier statement, but, instead of Tsuna’s reason of friendship, his reason was greed. As he rushes to Uni he tells her not to even think of dying without his permission, as he draws closer, he is suddenly stopped by Tsuna, who had a look of utter determination, as he tells Byakuran that he’ll never let him have Uni. Byakuran frowns, annoyed at Tsuna’s interference, and tells Tsuna that if Tsuna insists on interfering, he’ll have to eliminate Tsuna first.
  </p>
  <p key="dff50247-4728-44f0-86e9-c49f70742560">
   Saying this he kicks Tsuna into the air, but Tsuna manages to steady himself, and hurls himself at Byakuran, sending both of them crashing into the ground. The two rivals, with contrasting emotions and reasons for victory, resume their fierce struggle for victory.
  </p>
  <p key="24089ca6-3c0e-4b61-9b42-d7c01059382e">
   As Tsuna and Byakuran resume their battle,
   Mukuro Rokudo
   states that they (the allies) couldn’t afford to just sit and watch the battle, he states that it was time they broke the barrier and rescued Uni.
   Dino
   agrees, saying that regardless of what Uni decides to do, she was in too much danger, being in the firing range of such a fierce battle.
   Each one of the allies agree, and start attacking the barrier, attempting to break it, but, as
   Gokudera
   pointed out, no matter what they did, the barrier wouldn’t flinch.
   Inside the barrier, Uni was well on her way to reviving the Arcobaleno. She thinks of her
   grandma
   and her
   mum
   , and thinks that she’ll be seeing them soon. A picture of
   Gamma
   appears in her head, accompanied by an image of the aftermath of what she was about to, she lets out a slight gasp as the image of her skeleton goes through her mind.
   Tsuna and Byakuran continue to trade blows, and after a while they both take a step back, feeling the effects of the battle. Tsuna acknowledges Byakuran’s strength, telling him that Byakuran wasn’t kidding when he said he hadn’t even got started earlier, Byakuran returns the compliment, telling Tsuna that he had never expected him to be this strong. But Byakuran looks towards Uni telling Tsuna, that in the end, Uni will be his. However, upon seeing Uni, Byakuran seemed to have a confused look, Tsuna, looks towards Uni as well, to see what Byakuran was staring at.
   Uni’s flames seemed to be shrinking, she falls on her knees, tears pouring from her eyes. She thinks to herself that she was scared of dying. The allies, who hadn’t figured out what was wrong with Uni, seemed perplexed by this sudden change.
  </p>
  <p key="347b4064-4925-4c5b-abdd-d5e94fcc3bcf">
   Byakuran looks at the crying Uni, and a smile crosses his face. He comments in a victorious tone, that the reason for this sudden change, was probably because Uni was afraid of dying. Tsuna pleads with Uni, telling her it was ok, that they’ll find another way, but Uni shakes her head sadly, her face brimming with tears, and says there’s no other way and stands up once again, reigniting her flames as she does so.
   Amidst the confusion,
   Basil
   shouts out “now” as his
   Box Animal
   begins to rise. But the strange thing about this was that, Alfin was rising with many more Box Animals, all connected to him.
  </p>
  <p key="c8c1c6bd-6a5d-4eef-9731-5031167b6518">
   Everyone watches this new development, realizing that what Basil was attempting, was a
   Box Combination
   attack, which consisted of all the Vongola Allies boxes.
   <a href="Reborn.html" key="40ce5535-e51f-4672-ab00-6749b14f040a" title="Reborn">
    Reborn
   </a>
   looks at this new technique, and says that this might just be enough to break through the barrier.
  </p>
  <p key="aa168d04-d128-4406-8033-c2263babe2c0">
   Basil and Alfin charge towards the barrier and attacks the barrier with this technique, which they dubbed
   Super Nova Ocean
   . The attack creates a massive impact, but, even a technique of this power could only create a slight crack in the barrier. Basil curses the failure, but a figure leaps towards the crack, saying that a crack was more than enough.
   Gamma
   leaps through the crack and right into the barrier, where he was immediately face-to-face with Uni. Uni looks surprised to see his arrival, but he greets her casually, and tells her it was cold of her to run off again right after they had been reunited. He smiles at Uni and tells her, that his flames are hers to use.
  </p>
  <p key="4d8bd438-cc6e-421a-946b-0787d0d6459d">
   Gamma thinks back to the time when the Vongola group were making plans for the battle, and when Reborn took him aside to have a private word with him. He remembers Reborn asking him about how he felt about Uni, with Reborn pointing out how fond Uni was of him. Reborn tells him that they were running out of time, and how, if you let the chance go you might never get it back.
  </p>
  <p key="e538e9ae-563c-448e-adc8-938e6997c4b4">
   Reborn reminds Gamma about how the Sky Arcobaleno show more emotion and smile brighter than anyone else, but how their fate dictates that they don’t live a long life. Reborn tells Gamma that Uni won’t have a chance to grow up, and advices Gamma to stop treating her like a child and start treating her as a person.
   Remembering this, Gamma hugs Uni, and tells her that he won’t let her do this alone, he looks at Uni who still had tears in her eyes and smiles. Gamma’s partners,
   Nosaru
   and
   Tazaru
   pleads with Gamma to stop what he was doing, but Gamma simply smiles. Uni looks at Gamma, surprised, Gamma smiles at her and tells her if she remembers what she whispered in his ear the day she went to meet Byakuran. He tells her that he never got a chance to give her his reply, he leans towards Uni and whispers something into her ear. This reply makes Uni cry even more, and Gamma tells her that she shouldn’t be so sad when they’re about to set off, telling her kindly, that this wasn’t what her mother taught her. Upon hearing this, Uni hears her mother voice telling her that she should smile from her heart when she’s happy.
  </p>
  <p key="f59e5020-0d2d-4ffa-960b-97f7e766debb">
   Uni smiles upon hearing this and buries her head in Gamma’s chest and begins the final step of her
   technique
   .
  </p>
  <p key="49e9d60d-089c-4fdf-82fe-2d6cf5d24ce8">
   As allies watch in despair, Uni and Gamma simply disappear, leaving only their clothes behind. Tsuna screams for Gamma and Uni and immediately heads for the place where they stood, just moments ago. Tsuna stares at the remains and reaches out for Uni’s pacifier. He grabs the pacifier, thinking of Uni, and looks at it with a mixture of sadness and surprise.
   Futa
   , who too looked surprised by what had transpired, snaps out of his trance, and immediately points out that, even though Uni had died, the Arcobaleno had not been revived. Reborn calms him by telling him that even though they might not have been revived, the Arcobaleno had received Uni’s flames, but that it’ll take a bit of time for them to return.
   Tsuna, who paid no attention to the conversation between the two, still stares at Uni’s pacifier which he was holding in his hand. Byakuran lands a few feet away and blames Tsuna for what had happened. He talks in a depressed tone, saying that he had finally found the missing piece of the puzzle, and now it was gone. He continues by saying that his dream of awakening the Tri-ni-sette, and become the ruler of all space and time was shattered by Tsuna and Uni’s act of friendship. Byakuran, having lost his cool, now screams at Tsuna, asking him if he knew what this meant. But Tsuna seemed to have had enough. He squeezes Uni’s pacifier, and releases a furious amount of flames, that sent Byakuran scurrying back. Byakuran stares at Tsuna, who was now covered with a tornado of flames. Tsuna, who had been silent all this time, finally begins to speak.
  </p>
  <p key="b5422986-d514-4b1f-a339-1410178ca4ec">
   Tsuna, his voice packed with anger and sadness, asks Byakuran in a slow tone, who it was that pushed Uni into making such a decision,
  </p>
  <p key="a12ba0a6-8f02-4909-a733-323e600e9ef0">
   he turns slightly towards Byakuran, and tells him that he ruined their worlds, which led Uni to do what she did. Tsuna now turns to face Byakuran and tells him, with tears in his eyes, that he was the reason Uni had died. Tsuna, his voice now filled with rage, and his eyes taking on a dangerous look, releases a furious amount of flames, and tells Byakuran, that he alone, he will never forgive.
  </p>
  <p key="613708b8-e8fb-4a4e-80b9-0d1e3e42d29d">
   The release of Tsuna’s Flames begins to crack the previously said unbreakable barrier. But Byakuran wasn’t moved. He looks at Tsuna and scornfully repeats Tsuna’s statement, he begins to laugh, telling Tsuna that he was a joke. He tells Tsuna that he might have been able to understand Tsuna’s reaction had he viewed Uni as a powerful tool, after all, Uni had the power to make him a god, but the fact that he treated Uni as an ordinary girl was something beyond him.
   Byakuran continues, telling Tsuna that Tsuna’s desire to attack him was nothing more than a humanistic rush of emotions, he tells Tsuna that if that was the best answer that the human society had, then they fail hard. Saying this, Byakuran himself begins to release powerful flames to match Tsuna. Byakuran shouts, as the barrier continues to crack, that individual desires will trump collective hypocrisy every time, pronouncing that, that was the world they lived in. Roots shoot out of Byakuran’s feet as he says this, as he stabilizes himself for a powerful attack, wanting to finish this battle in one
   final attack
   .
  </p>
  <p key="d080a9d8-a5e4-4707-9932-b78d18c28e57">
   The allies watch this heated confrontation in baited breath, they notice the roots that had shot out from Byakuran’s leg, and
   <a href="Kikyo.html" key="9514fe27-df89-46e2-a41b-eb45fa2b4958" title="Kikyo">
    Kikyo
   </a>
   immediately understands that Byakuran was stabilizing himself for a final attack, but as Kikyo says this Tsuna changes his own stance.
  </p>
  <p key="c165fb6e-b009-4bc2-8e35-32b148c17d4f">
   One hand points forward, while the other takes its place behind him. Tsuna then says “Operation-X”, to which gages appear in his eyes. Tsuna was about to counter Byakuran with his own deadly technique, the
   X-Burner
   .
  </p>
  <p key="550d9110-3bd5-4e72-96f8-bdc9bc893e8c">
   The two rivals, full of hate for each other each prepare their own deadly finishers. The heated enemies make use of the preparation period for these attacks, to have one final exchange of thoughts. Byakuran screams at Tsuna that his actions served no purpose, and how Uni and her pacifiers were the best toys he had ever had. Tsuna shouts back at Byakuran, telling him to stop insulting Uni, he stares at Byakuran and tells him ferociously that he was going down.
  </p>
  <p key="3f3fcda6-f0f0-426d-9638-035baa5c2c1f">
   The barrier, unable to withstand the intensity of the Flame release by the two bosses now begins to completely shatter as both release their finishing moves.
  </p>
  <p key="c9e05075-e6fc-4c54-9a96-e699c5f52e32">
   The two bosses fire their most powerful techniques, hoping finally to end the battle. These two techniques clash in the center of the battlefield, with the two bosses giving everything they had to make the techniques as powerful as possible. Byakuran and Tsuna scream as they continue to give their techniques more power,
  </p>
  <p key="1c293cfb-d47c-40e8-a1a9-1008a8a484ca">
   the release of these two powers were incredible, as they grow bigger with every passing moment. But soon, Tsuna’s X-Burner begins to overpower Byakuran’s technique, and in a few short moments completely destroys it, and eventually hits Byakuran.
  </p>
  <p key="9aac7f86-c301-4871-a703-78e9a1800355">
   Byakuran screams in agony as the X-Burner hits him, and soon, he begins to remember bits of his past. Byakuran recalls his first meeting with the
   Cervello
   . He recalls two of their members approaching him, and offers him the Mare Ring, stating that they have finally found the rightful bearer of the ring.
  </p>
  <p key="e1e3b277-f155-4c5e-b2b3-ee6f40bfceb1">
   Byakuran laughs upon hearing this and tells them that he’s been waiting for something like this to happen since he lost faith in the real world long ago. He states that everywhere he went society was just a backdrop, and this became clear after he traveled to the
   Parallel Worlds
   . Byakuran tells the Cervello that he’ll take anything that’ll make the world more fun, but warns the Cervello that he’ll use the Mare Ring to its full potential, even dabbing at things like World Domination and Global War. The Cervello promises to never interfere with Byakuran’s plans, but warns him, that if he viewed this as a game, he should be aware that there are two other players in this game.
  </p>
  <p key="c87d3bb7-b93e-47eb-a729-fc8e2b78ab79">
   Byakuran welcomes the challenge, starting a game would be boring without rivals. Byakuran snaps back to the present and continues to scream in agony as the X-Burner had hit him. He looks at Tsuna and thinks to himself, that he never really hated humans, in fact, he felt warm when in the presence of others, he assures himself that he wasn’t being pessimistic, he remembers that he was always good at finding fun things to do, and that he tried his best to have fun, but to him something about the world didn’t seem right, he looks at Tsuna, wanting to see if Tsuna agreed. He sees Tsuna eyes and laughs, as he realizes that Tsuna didn’t agree with him at all. His final thoughts cross his mind, he laughs thinking it was so bright, and as the Mare Ring slips out of his finger, Byakuran smiles for one last time, accepting his loss.
  </p>
  <p key="fb33a91c-7ad3-4fe0-98f7-8173b59342f2">
   Byakuran disappears and the barrier shatters, the crater left by Tsuna’s X-Burner was visible for all to see, and as the Mare Ring falls to the ground, Tsuna stands victorious, still in his stance for the X-Burner.

   Everyone rejoiced after Tsuna's victory against Byakuran, but quickly turns upset when they think about Uni and Gamma's sacrifice as Nosaru, Tazaru, Kyoko, and Haru cry for them. They were interrupted when the Varia attacked Kikyo, the only enemy remains and intends to kill him. Tsuna immediately tells them to stop since he had enough with people dies in front of him, which Xanxus comments that he is too soft. Irie explains that the Real Six Funeral Wreaths were originally normal humans like them. Kikyo angrily explains their pitiful fate before they met Byakuran and describe how Byakuran is their savior. Xanxus cuts him off, shooting him right on the face. Tsuna begins to wonder whether their victory is really worthy of remembering the lives of many people who had already been lost and cannot be returned, feeling that their victory means nothing over their loss.

   A voice tells him that it's not true, the pacifiers shine and the Arcobaleno are revived. Colonnello explains that Uni has communicated with them through her flames and they knew the situation. With Byakuran defeated, all of his evil deeds that had been done in the parallel worlds would be rewritten, making all the people who had been killed alive again as if nothing ever happened, creating a new future with the power of the Mare Rings sealed forever by Uni's last power. This made everyone relieved. Irie reminded them that it's the time to grant what their wish the most; returning to the past.
