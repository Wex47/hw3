   Iris

   Millefiore
   members arrive at the
   Vindice Prison
   to release the final
   Funeral Wreath
   . After a moment of taking in their situation, they ask the Vindice to open the door.

   The doors of this deadly prison open and standing behind them are three Vindice. Iris repeats
   Byakuran

   The three members of the Millefiore seem perplexed, arguing that it was them that were supposed to have finalized the exchange. One of the Vindice proceed to use his ring to show the released prisoner. The released man was none other than

   The three Millefiore members argue with the Vindice, saying that they had been fooled by a

   Illusionist
   . The Vindice deny this possibility, stating that there are only three illusionists capable of fooling them.

   Ten kilometers away from the Vindice Prison, Fran sneezes right on cue, wondering if someone was talking behind his back. In the room with him are
   M.M
   ,
   Ken Joshima
   ,
   Chikusa Kakimoto
   and Mukuro, who is resting. Ken and M.M. show delight at the fact that Mukuro is released, Chikusa, his usual quiet self, and Fran as usual, verbally attacks his companions. Mukuro was resting, due to being in a water tank for ten years. Chikusa states that as soon as Mukuro recovers, they'd be heading to Japan, to aid the other

   Nosaru
   and
   Tazaru
   seem to be unhappy with the amount of kids in their group. The fact that Lambo was climbing onto Tazaru's bald patch did not help to calm them down. Tazaru seems shocked that the Millefiore were being pushed around by a bunch of kids. He wastes no time in picking a fight with
   Shoichi Irie
   , calling him the captain who betrayed
   Merone Base
   . Irie, defends himself and the two start an argument, which is instantly broken up by Uni.

   Lal Mirch
   . Lal comments that Uni looks exactly like her grandmother,
   Luce
   .  Lal states that Luce had a mysterious Intuition, and asks if Uni possesses it as well. Uni says that she did possess it at one point, but her power has been slowly dimininshing for a while. Uni then reveals that Byakuran was going through something similar. She goes on to say that Byakuran would require a great deal of energy to see into parallel worlds, and could only see one thing at a time.

   Gamma
   seems worried about Uni. Uni goes onto say that Byakuran, due to his current condition, will stop at nothing to capture her, and obtain the true power of the

   At the Millefiore mansion, Byakuran receives word of what happened at Vindice Prison. He states that he'll talk with the Vindice again, and with a deadly face, says to get Ghost out as soon as possible. Back at the forest, the group continue their discussion, Uni states that this time she won't run away. This statement worries the group, Tsuna goes as far as to tell her not to give up as they've come so far. Uni then reveals a startling bit of information.

  <p key="8f9c510d-2c54-4bf8-aac9-98d331f68bed">
   She reveals that she's know for a long time that the final battle will take place in the forest. Uni reveals that the next day at dawn, the final showdown between the Millefiore and Vongola will begin. As the group continue their discussion, Uni reveals the secrets of Byakuran's power. She says that all though he's able to share thoughts with all the parallel worlds, there's only one reincarnation of him. In other words if Byakuran is killed in this world, the Byakurans of the other world's will cease to exist as well.

   The group are over joyed at the thought of returning to a peaceful past, till Lal bursts their bubble by reminding them that it will only be possible

  <p key="d302bc27-ccf6-428f-8c02-c254f1e0ec08">
   Tsuna begins to panic when he realizes that they have very little time, and no plan to go by. A bit later, Tsuna asks Irie to help him come up with a plan. Irie proposes that the one's injured shouldn't take part in the battle. This draws large protest, as the majority of the group were injured, and wanted to be a part of the battle. Reborn fires his gun into the air to silence them.

   Next on the agenda was sorting out the functioning Box Weapons. Gamma says that
   Basil
   's
   box weapon
   had the ability to communicate with other box animals due to its superior intelligence. He suggests using that ability to come up with deadly combo attacks.
  </p>
  <p key="b57220b8-5b34-44bd-b17e-9b5fcee5b86c">
   Everyone who had Box Animals released them to test out this theory. As they were about to get started,
   Nuts
   hides behind Tsuna. Tsuna reveals that Nuts is a scaredy cat outside battles.
   Uri
   attacks Nuts, and Tsuna too gets caught up in the cat fight.

   The mood now considerably lighter, Lal hands
   Colonnello
   Arcobaleno Pacifier
   to Uni who accepts it gratefully. Gamma sensing that Uni was up to something, worries about her. Reborn appears before him and states that they needed to talk.

   Zakuro
   heads towards the base, happy that he's the fastest out of the three. Suddenly he's attacked. A
   Cloud Centipede
   restrains him,
   Electric Foxes
   attack him, and finally a strong
   Storm Flame
   hits him. The trio who attack are
   Lal Mirch
   ,
   Gamma
   and
   Gokudera
   . The three seem excited at their success, till Zakuro laughs, states that he isn't as weak as
   Deisy
   and
   Torikabuto
   . He opens his coat to reveal his
   Asura Box
   . Zakuro opens it, and the final battle between the Millefiore and the Vongola is finally underway.
