Byakuran explained that they would need a kind of "ticket" to participate, mostly because it takes a lot of energy to transport so many people to the battlefield. They were asked to produce 5 million

Hibari wanted to get started then and there, but Byakuran said that they still needed to make the next "Choice". He then pulled out the Gyro Roulette. Byakuran projected the Gyro Roulette images so everyone could see, it had eight crests on it: the 7 Flame Attributes and one blank Box. Byakuran placed his hand on the Gyro Roulette and instructed Tsuna to do the same. Byakuran explained that when he said "Choice", the Gyro Roulette would spin to the right.

   . Basil called them on the fact that they lacked another Mist participant, Byakuran and Bluebell feigned surprise, and introduced their second Mist user,
   Saru
   , one of Torikabuto's A-rank subordinates.
   Then Byakuran decided that
   Target Rule
   was going to be the format of the battle. The Gyro-Roulette selected the Sun participant from the Millefiore and one of the participants without a Ring from the Vongola. The Gyro Roulette then selects Shoichi and Deisy by putting a mark on both of their hearts. The mark drains their Dying Will Flames, Reborn says that forcibly draining their Flames or "life" would eventually kill them. Byakuran considers this a time-limit to the battle. Although the mark shouldn't hurt the target in the slightest, but Shoichi doubles over in pain. Shoichi is willing to risk his life because he said that he's the one who made Byakuran the way he is, to which Byakuran says "So that's how you see it?"
   Byakuran says that not only can Choice now begin, but that they're playing for the three forces that "created the world": The
   Arcobaleno Pacifiers, Vongola Rings, and Mare Rings
   .

   if he can see anyone from his current position, the latter responds "no". Shoichi is so sure that the enemy is concealing themselves with Illusions, that he lowers the decoy so Yamamoto can reach with his sword. Yamamoto senses something, jumps off his bike, and charges toward the decoys, when one that is hit by an unknown weapon explodes into a pillar of thick vines. Yamamoto is caught unawares and is quickly ensnared by these vines, which knocks Shigure Kintoki out of his reach and pins him to the ground.
   Saru
   appears. After making a comment that strikes

   As Genkishi strikes a seemingly final blow, Yamamoto activates his Rain Vongola Box and summons his
   Cane di Pioggia ver. Vongola
   to the battlefield, with the Akita wielding one sword made of Rain Flames and Yamamoto wielding two others just the same. Yamamoto says that his name is Ziro, and that he holds onto his three short Blades for him. Yamamoto also comments that he and Genkishi are the same in that they both use four Swords. He proceeds to ask Genkishi if he could get his fourth one, Shigure Kintoki, which was knocked away. Genkishi shoots invisible
   Sea Slugs
   at Yamamoto, who calmly dodges by shooting a powerful burst of Rain Flames to both get away from the attack, and propel him towards his fourth Sword, which he grabs. Using his other short Blade, he shoots another burst of Rain Flames at the ground to put some distance between him and Genkishi, and finally releases a third burst to charge his opponent.

   Genkishi vanishes after their Blades connect, and in a swirl of vines, attempts to hit Yamamoto with more invisible Spectral Sea Slugs. Yamamoto again dodges with a burst of Rain Flames.

   Reborn comments that not only can he now fight aerially, but he can also use his Rain Flames to detect where the invisible attacks are coming from. In an instant, Yamamoto throws two short Blades at Genkishi. When Genkishi says that he shouldn't be able to see through his Illusions, Yamamoto reveals that he had his
   Rondine di Pioggia ver. Vongola

   is doing so much better is because for the time being, he's completely devoted to the Blade instead of baseball. Mainly because in his last battle with Genkishi, he thought he could win, but was utterly beaten. Yamamoto felt he shamed the blade and didn't do everything he could to grow stronger. So without that weighing him down, he's been able to train more effectively.

   With the odds stacked against the Millefiore, Shoichi makes a plan. Tsuna and Yamamoto are to attack the Millefiore's Target, and Gokudera is to hold his defensive position. However, Kikyo was stronger then expected and was able to pass Gokudera (making his Sistema C.A.I. useless with his
   Bellflowers
   in the process). Tsuna appears to have a problem and is going in the wrong direction.

   Cervello
   then explains that to make a Target be extinguished, the person's life force must be less than 2%. They then check if the results are legitimate. Both are legitimate, and they end in a draw, or so it may seem. Deisy suddenly wakes up with his marker lit. Kikyo then explains that Deisy cannot die, resulting in the Millefiore's victory. Byakuran demands the Vongola Rings as his prize. However, Shoichi claims his favor; in their last college game of Choice, Byakuran lost and promised a favor to Shoichi in their next game. Byakuran refuses the favor, but Uni emerges and proclaims that she deserves half of a share in the decision since she is the head of the Black Spell. After Byakuran refuses again, Uni leaves the Millefiore and joins Tsuna, bringing with her the Arcobaleno Pacifiers that Byakuran gave to her for safekeeping.
