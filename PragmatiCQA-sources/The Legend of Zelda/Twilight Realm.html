   The Twilight Realm's full history is incomplete. All that is known of the Twilight Realm's history are brief hints of its origins, and what recent political history Midna chooses to divulge. For much of its early history, the Twilight Realm was a peaceful place, until the King of Evil known as
   Ganondorf
   was banished to the realm by the
   Ancient Sages
   , where his evil influence would cause a coup of the government and cast the realm into darkness by overthrowing the true Twilight Princess and installing a puppet ruler named
   Zant
   into the position of ruler of the Twilight Realm. Zant would go on to seal away the Sols, leaving the Twilight Realm in darkness, and invade the land of Hyrule on Ganondorf's orders in order to merge the two worlds together into a single empire.
   However, after the Dark Lord's defeat, peace was restored, and the Twilight Realm was free of his grip. This was made possible by the efforts of the hero

   , before the Mirror of Twilight was shattered by
   Princess Midna
   , the Twilight Realm's rightful ruler that was restored to power. This action severed the only known gateway between the two worlds, destroying the only known means of travel between them to prevent similar events from happening again.

   At a certain point in the history of the land of Hyrule, a
   war
   broke out across the land when a group of shadowy magicians known as the Dark Interlopers learned of the mythical
   <a href="Triforce.html" key="7b13a0c8-c27d-4233-b85f-ac26a4131c7f" title="Triforce">
    Triforce
   </a>
   located within the
   Sacred Realm
   and attempted to establish dominion over it to harness the Triforce's power. To this end, the Interlopers used an ultimate weapon, the dark relic known as the
   Fused Shadow
   , inside which they had vested a vast amount of their magic.
  </p>
  <p key="beff1f91-57bd-4b5c-a6d9-552cf9ce6dbb">
   The
   Golden Goddesses
   decided to order the
   Light Spirits
   of Hyrule to intervene and seal away the dark magic of the Interlopers to halt the war.
   The Light Spirits shattered the Fused Shadow into four fragments (hiding three of them across Hyrule and leaving the fourth in the hands of the Interlopers) to prevent its future misuse. The goddesses chased the interlopers across Hyrule and banished them to the Twilight Realm.
  </p>
  <p key="d5c0f006-65bc-47be-b3c1-b4474c18bf62">
   In addition, the Twilight Realm's effect of causing those that dwelled within it for an extended period of time to only be able to exist as shadows outside of it took its toll on the Interlopers, dooming them to this fate as well. Over time, the Interlopers would evolve into the Twili.
   However, the goddesses did not completely sever the Twilight Realm's connection to Hyrule, for they left one link between the two worlds in the hands of the Ancient Sages: the Mirror of Twilight, which could only be shattered by the true ruler of the Twili.

   A long time after the banishment of the Interlopers to the Twilight Realm, the King of Evil Ganondorf attempted to launch an invasion of Hyrule, but was thwarted by the Royal Family of Hyrule, who had been forewarned by Link, the
   Hero of Time
   . As a result, Ganondorf was arrested and sentenced to execution at the
   Arbiter's Grounds
   , the home of the Mirror of Twilight.
   Ganondorf was kept there for a time until the day his sentence was to be carried out in the
   Mirror Chamber
   atop the prison. However, when the Ancient Sages impaled him with the
   Sword of the Sages
   , the
   Triforce of Power
   suddenly activated within him and prevented his death.
   With this second wind, the
   Gerudo
   leader soon broke free of his chains, obliterating the Sage of Water and turning the blade on its owners. As a last resort, the remaining Sages activated the Mirror of Twilight in order to open the portal to the Twilight Realm and send Ganondorf through it.
  </p>
  <p key="02bb8cbd-0068-4582-b988-5cf5a2ecef7e">
   Centuries later, the Twilight Realm entered a period of political instability when the throne was suddenly left vacant. One of the hawkish advisers of the Royal Family of the Twilight Realm, Zant stood as a prime candidate to ascend to the throne. However, Midna was selected as the true Twilight Princess, and Zant became enraged that he was not selected instead.
   He became severely depressed, and in this state was approached by Ganondorf, who masqueraded as a god.
   Ganondorf offered him the power to take the throne by force in exchange for his freedom from the Twilight Realm. Zant used his newfound magical abilities to curse Midna and usurped the throne of the Twilight Realm, transforming the Twili into

   and sealing away the Sols within the Palace of Twilight, leaving the Twilight Realm in darkness and bringing misery to the Twili.
   Meanwhile, Midna escaped to Hyrule with the lone piece of the Fused Shadow left in the hands of the Twili and decided to seek out the other fragments to use against Zant.
  </p>
  <p key="399d4641-b55f-4d03-adcb-e8071e92ec1e">
   Zant was persuaded to attempt a conquest of Hyrule by Ganondorf, whom he released back into the World of Light in fulfillment of their bargain.

  <p key="2d7fa3f8-6542-4180-9c35-7b4eda252ef6">
   Zant then proceeded to launch an invasion of the
   World of Light
   itself, intending to conquer both worlds and mix shadow and light together to make pure darkness, as ordered by his "god".
   His armies spread
   Twilight
   all over Hyrule as they conquered each of its provinces. In this Twilight, the people of Hyrule became like spirits, unaware of what had happened to them.
   Eventually, Zant and his army conquered the stately

   , the chance to either surrender or face the deaths of her people. At this, Zelda surrendered the throne of Hyrule to Zant, and Twilight completely engulfed the country's main regions, leaving only the small annex of
   Ordona Province
   free of the grip of the King of Shadows. With this, Zant now had control of Hyrule's government and imprisoned Princess Zelda in one of the castle towers.
  </p>
  <p key="26bbef41-8428-4946-9270-c7b4dbdb80cc">
   It was Zant's subsequent attack on the last remaining province that drew a new Hero into these events, a young ranch-hand named

   within him. Eventually, Link was captured when he entered the Twilight and was transformed into a
   divine wolf
   , dragged to the dungeons of Hyrule Castle by Zant's soldiers. Here, he met Midna in her transformed state and the imprisoned Princess Zelda, who relayed to him the fate that had befallen the kingdom of Hyrule. Link teamed up with Midna to locate the lost fragments of the Fused Shadow to defeat Zant and free Hyrule of his power. After succeeding in reversing the spread of Twilight and finding all of the Fused Shadow fragments, the pair were confronted by Zant himself, who stole the fragments and fatally injured Midna before they could escape. Zelda sacrificed herself to save Midna and instructed the pair to find the

   , the pair journeyed to the Arbiter's Grounds in search of the Mirror of Twilight. There, they discovered a shocking truth: before leaving for the Twilight Realm, Zant broke the Mirror of Twilight into four shards and scattered them over Hyrule to prevent anyone from entering the Twilight Realm.
   It was here that the Ancient Sages appeared and related the story of Ganondorf's execution to the pair and instructed them to find the three lost fragments of the Mirror of Twilight.

It was here that the Ancient Sages offered their apologies to the Twilight Princess for sending Ganondorf away into her world and causing so much misery for her and her people.
   With this, Link and Midna used the Mirror of Twilight to journey to the Twilight Realm, where Link succeeded in restoring the Sols to their proper shrine, restoring the normal flow of light in the Twilight Realm and causing the Twili to revert to their true forms. In addition, the power of the Sols transferred into the Master Sword, a sign that the gods of the Twilight Realm were on Link's side as well.

   The pair then entered the palace to face Zant himself. It was here that Zant revealed to his unwelcome guests the truth of his relationship with Ganondorf. Link is then forced to battle Zant in several deadly skirmishes for the fate of the Twilight Realm, facing him in arenas that Link had visited throughout his adventure to defeat the King of Shadows. Despite his great magical power bestowed by Ganondorf, Zant fell to the Master Sword's evil-banishing power and lay dying upon the throne as he stated his belief that regardless of what Link and Midna did, he would be resurrected by Ganondorf.
   After taunting Midna by revealing to her that the curse on her would not lift until Ganondorf was vanquished,
   Midna used the Fused Shadow to obliterate Zant, causing him to explode in a final scream of anguish. With this, Zant's reign of terror over the Twilight Realm was brought to an end, but Midna was distressed at the raw power that she had exhibited. She was unprepared for the abilities that the Fused Shadow gave her.

   After the Twilight Realm was freed of Zant's iron fist, Link and Midna journeyed back to Hyrule and infiltrated the usurped Hyrule Castle to face Ganondorf. At the top of the castle tower, they found the Throne Room being circled by dark, foreboding clouds. Inside, they found Princess Zelda's lifeless body suspended in the central hole of the Triforce statue adorning the chamber and Ganondorf himself sitting on Zelda's throne. After a brief conversation, the pair began a battle against Ganondorf for the fate of Hyrule, battling him in many different ways and forms. After Zelda was restored to her physical being, she and Link were warped away by Midna, who attempted to kill Ganondorf with the Fused Shadow, but ultimately failed. Link and Zelda then engaged Ganondorf in a horseback battle across

   Link and Princess Zelda accompanied Midna back to the Mirror Chamber to bid her farewell as she returned home to resume her place as the ruler of the Twili. Zelda encouraged relations between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm to continue, stating that they are two sides of the same coin, to which the Twilight Princess thanked her for her kind words and true heart. Midna then addressed Link one final time as she shed a single tear and sent it drifting toward the Mirror of Twilight, seeming to wish to confide something very personal to him but losing the nerve at the last moment as the tear collided with the Mirror of Twilight, causing it to begin to crack and fragment. The Twilight Princess locked her gaze with Link's as she vanished through the portal back to the Twilight Realm just before the Mirror of Twilight utterly shattered, sealing off the only known road between the worlds.

Since the Twili's ancestors were noted to be especially gifted with magic, it makes sense that the Twili themselves would continue this tradition and put that talent to use in the creation of technology that surpasses even that seen in Hyrule.

   The primary residents of the Twilight Realm, the Twili are a race of shadow-beings that are descended from another group of dark magicians known as the Dark Interlopers that once resided in the land of Hyrule in the past. After the Interlopers began to delve into darker magic and developed an awesome weapon in the Fused Shadow, they
   attempted a conquest
   of the fabled Sacred Realm in the hope of establishing control over a much greater source of magic, the Triforce. After much bloodshed, the Golden Goddesses chased the Interlopers across Hyrule and banished them to the Twilight Realm, outside of which they could henceforth only exist as shadows. The Interlopers eventually evolved into the Twili race, a more humble and less selfish race than their ancestors.
