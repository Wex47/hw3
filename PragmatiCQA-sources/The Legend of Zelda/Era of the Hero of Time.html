He climbed Ganon's Tower and met Agahnim at the top. Link defeated Agahnim once more, but then saw Ganon rise out of Agahnim's crumpled body. Agahnim was in fact Ganon's alter ego.
   Ganon then fled to the

Following Ganon's defeat, he found the Triforce within the Pyramid of Power, whereupon it spoke to him. He touched it, and his wish restored Hyrule to peace. The king and Link's uncle returned to life, and Link entrusted the Triforce to the Royal Family.

  <p key="f8539259-0a60-4e64-ba54-841982d51733">
   Upon awakening in Holodrum, Link met with a group of traveling performers who were watching after a dancer named
   Din
   . Link danced with Din, but suddenly a whirlwind appeared and snatched Din away. Din was actually the Oracle of Seasons, and her capture by Onox meant that the seasons in the land of Holodrum were thrown into chaos. The only way to restore balance to the seasons was to collect the eight

    Rod of Seasons
   </a>
   in order to manipulate the seasons as he went.
   Once Link defeated Onox and rescued Din, he was magically transported to the land of Labrynna, the setting of his second trial. However, even after his death, Onox's actions caused the Flame of Destruction to be lit.

  <p key="29e6dda6-4af6-4484-bc4f-4a9f4ff1e3e1">
   Upon waking up in Labrynna, Link met
   Impa
   , who had been attacked by monsters. He helped her by moving a block with the Triforce crest on it. Then, both of them met
   Nayru
   , who was singing to animals.
   Suddenly, a shadow came out of Impa and possessed Nayru, who was actually the Oracle of Ages. It was Veran, who had used Impa's body to trick Link. Veran used Nayru's time-traveling abilities to go back in time and alter the past. Veran influenced Queen
   Ambi
   in the past to build the sinister
   Black Tower
   . Link had to use the
   Harp of Ages
   to travel back and forth between the present and the past in order to collect the eight Essences of Time and challenge Veran atop the Black Tower.
   Link was able to drive Veran out of the body of Queen Ambi and defeat her, but he was too late: the Flame of Sorrow had been lit.

  <p key="0b8ec2f1-baac-48ec-bf93-2e8503983bca">
   In order to light the third and final flame, Twinrova kidnapped Princess Zelda who had arrived in Labrynna. This would complete their dark ritual and light the Flame of Despair. However, Link challenged them and killed them in battle. As a last-ditch effort to complete the sacrifice needed to revive Ganon, the witches offered their own bodies and revived the King of Darkness. However, because the ritual was incomplete, Ganon returned as a mindless beast. Link battled Ganon and defeated him, restoring peace to Holodrum and Labrynna.

   Centuries after Ganon's defeat, the peace of Hyrule is once again shattered by the sudden appearance of a mysterious and enigmatic wizard known as

   Seven Sages

   Ravio
   .

   Link is too late to stop Yuga. Using his magic and that of the Seven Sages, he is able to release Ganon.
   Along with the Triforce of Power, Yuga and Ganon are joined as one,
   and using this power, Yuga desires to consume both Hyrule and Lorule.
   Link is protected from the beast's onslaught by
   Hilda

   Taking the Triforce, he rushes to challenge Yuga in
   Lorule Castle
   , only to find Hilda waiting for him in the
   Throne Room
   . Here, she reveals the truth; it was her who sent Yuga to obtain the Seven Sages and release the Demon King. Taking the Triforce of Wisdom from Princess Zelda's portrait, she explains the history of her kingdom. Lorule once had its own Triforce, but was destroyed by her ancestors long ago to stop endless wars over its power. However, with the Triforce gone from her world, the kingdom crumbled, monsters arose and the world turned to darkness and corruption. Upon hearing of another world with its own Triforce, she sent Yuga to obtain the keys to unlocking the Triforce of Power, and manipulated Link into obtaining the Triforce of Courage. Summoning Yuga, she demands he obtain the Triforce of Courage from Link. Yuga, using Ganon's power, unleashes his might upon the hero. Link fights valiantly however, and defeats Yuga, upon which point Hilda demands he relinquish the Triforce of Power to her. However, Yuga disobeys his ruler, and using his magic upon her he takes her portrait and her Triforce of Wisdom into himself, becoming stronger than ever. In a desperate final battle, Link, with the aid of

   Ravio
   appears and reveals himself to be Link's Lorulean counterpart and once Hilda's loyal subject, and pleads with her to let Link and Zelda return to Hyrule with their Triforce. Finally relenting after seeing the senseless fighting that had led to this was not what her ancestors wanted, she helps Link and Zelda return to Hyrule with the last of the bracelet's power, through the first crack to appear between the worlds in Lorule's
   Sacred Realm
   .

   Hundreds of years after Ganondorf's death, the people of Hyrule had reconciled with Ganondorf's tribe, the
   Gerudo

   Pyramid

   He stole the

At that moment, Shadow Link appeared and scattered the maidens with his powers. Link drew the sword from its pedestal, splitting into four just as in ancient times. However, this released Vaati from his prison to cause chaos. Ganon used Shadow Link to tear open rifts to the Dark World, pulling the four
   Knights of Hyrule

   Tower of Winds

   Divine Beasts
   in preparation for Ganon's return. When Calamity Ganon appeared, the then-present reincarnations of Zelda and Link were able to seal him away with the support of the Guardians and Divine Beasts.

At some point, a militant faction of the Sheikah split off to become the

   A now 17-year-old Princess Zelda
   worked to awaken her sealing powers while being accompanied by Link, who had been appointed as her protector.
   Zelda was determined to awaken her power and prayed at the springs of the goddesses in Hyrule, but she was unsuccessful.
   Minutes after she had finished praying at the
   Spring of Wisdom
   , the Calamity broke its seal and rose up around the castle. Immediately after, it managed to corrupt the entire Guardian army by possessing it with
   Malice
   and turned it against Hyrule.
   The Champions, who were with Zelda near the Spring of Wisdom at the time, then rushed to their respective Divine Beast hoping to still be able to defeat Calamity Ganon in time. By that point, Ganon had already sent
   four
   incarnations
   of
   Malice
   after the Divine Beasts and possessed them, killing the Champions inside.
   With their strongest weapons lost, Hyrule was laid to ruin and Link was fatally injured while protecting Zelda, who had awakened her sealing powers while fleeing from Guardians, requiring him to sleep in the
   Shrine of Resurrection
   for 100 years.

   With their help, Link is able to critically injure Calamity Ganon inside Hyrule Castle using the Master Sword, scattering the
   Malice
   covering him. Immediately after, the scattered
   Malice
   gathers outside of the castle and transforms into
