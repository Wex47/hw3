   After completing each trial, the chosen hero would receive one of the three gifts left by Hylia, which would help the hero find his way to the
   Sacred Flames

   To reach these trials, the goddess also left the
   Isle of Songs

   Each of the guardians were left with a part of the "

   Hylia entrusted the guardians to teach the chosen hero their part of the song, since should the hero succeed in completing the last trial, the path to the Triforce would open to him.

   by
   Ghirahim
   's tornado. Is it here that an
   old woman
   rescued Zelda from being captured by evil forces and helped her remember her original purpose and life as the goddess Hylia.
   With a young
   Impa
   's help, who was actually sent out to help Zelda at the request of the goddess,
   Zelda set out to pray at the goddess statues located in each temple across the surface to purify her body, with each statue stirring up memories of her past life.

   into the past, with Impa destroying the gate to escape Ghirahim's grasp, who wishes to use Zelda's soul to resurrect
   his master
   . Link, the goddess's chosen hero, manages to activate a second Gate of Time and reaches the era where Hylia has just sealed away Demise. There, Link meets with Zelda, who explains her true nature as the mortal reincarnation of the Goddess Hylia. She blesses the

   with the power of the Goddess, causing it to take on its true form,
   before telling Link that she, as the reincarnation of Hylia, must remain in a deep sleep to keep Demise imprisoned within his seal.
   Before doing so, Zelda explains that the goddess needed someone with an "unbreakable spirit" to defeat Demise.
   However, Hylia realized that spirit alone was not enough,
   and so the goddess, knowing that the hero would "throw himself headfirst into any danger, without even a moment's doubt" if it meant saving Zelda,
   used Link so that he would be able to wield the Triforce.
   Her Grace apologizes for the way she had to involve him in all of it, but is prepared to pay for her actions.
   She proceeds to seal herself into a crystal and sleep for thousands of years to ensure Demise's imprisonment holds, and tells Link that he must find and use the Triforce to destroy Demise so that she will be able to awaken in their own time.
  </p>
  <p key="8323b3a8-a3a8-46cd-82b9-1da850234528">
   Link succeeds in obtaining the Triforce and wishes for the destruction of Demise. He then rushes into the Sealed Temple to witness Zelda's awakening,
   but just as the group believes that Link's quest is finally over, Ghirahim appears to attack them, taking Zelda and heading for the Gate of Time.
   Link follows Ghirahim, where he is beginning the ritual to revive Demise, who was still sealed in that era, by having him absorb the soul of Zelda. He has his troops attack Link to keep the hero at bay while he works, but Link manages to reach the center and fights Ghirahim, successfully defeating him. Ghirahim, however, reveals that while the two were fighting, the ritual continued, and the Imprisoned rises, absorbing Zelda's soul and returning to his original form: the Demon King, Demise.

  <p key="274b07fc-0f5e-45b3-a4ee-0f45d42a2920">
   After Link seals Demise's consciousness within the Master Sword, peace returns to the land, and Zelda as well as the young hero return to their own time. Zelda mentions to Link that she had fantasized about the surface for so long that she wants to remain there and watch over the Triforce, and asks what Link's intentions are for the future.
   Link smiles at her, and then the camera pans to show both his and Zelda's Loftwings flying back into the sky, implying that Link chose to stay with her.

    Hylia's Chosen Hero decides that he will always stand with his friends and accepts the Master Sword from the goddess.
    After reforging the sword, the hero agrees to lead the Goddess's army against the invading demons, but is mortally wounded in an encounter with Demise. With no other choice, Hylia and the hero use the power of the Master Sword to send the earth surrounding the castle into The Sky.
    With the humans and the Triforce safe in The Sky, Hylia proceeds to fight Demise and seals him away. After the battle, she sees her Chosen Hero lying dead on the ground, having succumbed to his wounds. Filled with grief, Hylia promises that his spirit will eternally live on and resolves to discard her divinity so that she may be with the Chosen Hero as a mortal.
