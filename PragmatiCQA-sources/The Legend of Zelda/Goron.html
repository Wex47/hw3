   They are notable for having a lack of identifiable female members.

   The Gorons are a large, mountain-dwelling race, with sizes ranging from medium, tall, and even gigantic. The largest known Goron in the series is
   Biggoron
   , who is roughly about the same height as the peak of

   . Goron legs are short, especially in comparison to their much longer arms.
   Gorons typically live in or under mountain ranges of several countries, including mountains such as Death Mountain of Hyrule and

   Some also live on islands, such as on
   Goron Island
   . Befitting with that of their habitat, their durable, round bodies greatly resemble that of stones and
   boulders
   , and nearly all Gorons have a hide of ridged stones on their backsides. They usually have light brown skin. They have small eyes and noticeable lips, which conceal unaligned, square teeth. Another common trait are their symbols in the shape of the
   Goron's Ruby
   tattooed to the sides of their arms, whether this is natural or not is unknown. Combined with their round shape, Gorons can also curl themselves into a ball shape and roll like a boulder, which is also their primary attack against enemies.

   Gorons possess immense strength which many are proud of, and many groups of Gorons like to hold competitions that test each other's physical strength and even rolling ability, including competitions such as
   Sumo Wrestlin'
   and rolling racing, among others. While Gorons do have many strengths, they are also not without their weaknesses. Gorons tend to move slowly, though their ability to roll can make up for this, and one of their apparent weaknesses is deep water as they cannot swim. However, as mentioned in

   . Those who become chiefs are both powerful and wise, uniting their people through respect and trust, rather than by force.
   Gorons tend to live in relative isolation but will regularly trade with Hyruleans and other friendly races.
   Gorons are very close and respectful to others of their own kind, and often refer to each other as "brothers". Though the Gorons are a friendly race, they can also be slow to trust outsiders, and may come off as cautious or even aggressive depending on the situation. However, if an outsider is able to prove their worth, usually in a test of strength, skill, intelligence, or courage, the Goron tribe will accept them and come to call them one of their brothers.

   Because of this, the Gorons can no longer mine for the rocks they eat, and are now starving because of their rock shortage.
   Some of the Gorons had became so hungry, that a few had went to the Spiritual Stone of Fire with the intention of giving it just a little lick, only to find it missing from where it was usually kept.
   Darunia had taken the Spiritual Stone and guarded it himself to prevent the others from possibly eating it. In the process, he locks himself in his room, saying that he would only come out whenever Hyrule's royal messenger arrives.

   Link the Goron says that he is the son of Darunia.
   He then tells Link that Ganondorf had revived an evil dragon named
   Volvagia
   that, according to Goron lore, had preyed on Gorons and was defeated by a Goron hero who used the
   Megaton Hammer
   in a battle against it.
   Darunia is a descendant of that Goron.
   More recently however, Ganondorf had captured nearly all of the Gorons and held them captive as prisoners in the
   Fire Temple
   , where he threatened to feed them all to the revived Volvagia, as an example to all of the other races who might question his rule over Hyrule.
   The only other Gorons who were not taken captive were Biggoron, Medigoron, and the Goron who runs the shop in Goron City. Darunia was not captured, but went into the Fire Temple to defeat Volvagia and to save his people. Link the Goron fears the worst and pleads with Link to save the Goron race.

After Link frees all the prisoner Gorons and defeats Volvagia with the Megaton Hammer, Darunia awakens and realizes that he is the Sage of Fire. He gives Link the

   Afterwards, all of the other Gorons return to their city, and thank Link again if spoken to.

   had built his fortress in the western peak of Rolling Ridge and had kept all of the Bomb Flowers for himself.

   After clearing the

   , Link heads to the eastern peak and base of Rolling Ridge, where he participates in several Goron mini-games. The Goron Dance Hall mini-game is hosted by a blue Goron in the present day and by a red Goron in the past, both known as the
   Graceful Goron
   in their time. They instruct dancing in rhythm to other Gorons in the Dance Hall. According to the red Goron, he is the first generation of Graceful Dancers,
   and that the blue Goron is the fifth generation.
   To join in, Link has to pay 10 Rupees in present day or 20 Rupees in the past to dance with them. According to the dance instructors, only people who dance well will be considered a Goron.
   When Link completes the mini-game, he is officially dubbed a fellow brother within the tribe. He is then given the
   Brother Emblem
   , allowing him access a tunnel that was being blocked by a Goron from outsiders.
   Other games that the Gorons in Labrynna play include the
   Target Carts
   game, which involves shooting targets with the

Link can then climb on top of the Goron to be launched to higher places. This is the only way that Link can get to the highest cavern which houses the wrestling ring and entrance to Goron Mines. During this time, the Gorons in the hot springs will not attack Link, giving Link a place he can rest.

Gor Coron asked for the help of Link to save Darbus and the fate of the tribe. Link then has to visit the three other elders within the mine, who were told about Link's assistance prior to Link visiting them. The Key to the sealed room of Darbus had been broken into three pieces and is being held by Gor Liggs, Gor Ebizo, and Gor Amoto.
   Link has to visit each elder to retrieve a piece of the Key to restore it. He also has to battle Dangoro for the Hero's Bow, and finally, has to defeat Fyrus to transform Darbus back to normal and to obtain the second Fused Shadow.

   Hot Spring Water
   to people. They have since ran out of Hot Spring Water as a result of the bridge leading to the Eldin Province being destroyed. This Goron can later be found at the bridge once it is repaired, saying he is too tired to continue his journey to retrieve water from the mountain, and says that if he were doused with Hot Spring Water, it would give him the energy to continue. Link can acquire a barrel full of Hot Spring Water from Gor Liggs in Kakariko Village, which he can then take to this Goron and throw the water onto him. Once he is revitalized by the water, his shop will restock Hot Spring Water. Another Goron can be seen trying to unblock the path to the Southern Hyrule Field, although he will not be able to do it unless he drinks a Bottle filled with Hot Spring Water. Link can bring him Hot Spring Water purchased from the Goron merchant's shop in Castle Town.

   Crimsonine

   Gongoron
   . Link asks for the Crimsonine but is refused it as he is just an outsider. However, since Biggoron has a love for quiz games, he decides that he would test Link in a quiz to prove himself as a Goron. Link has to meet and talk to every other Goron on island to begin the quiz.

   Afterwards, Link returns eligible to be tested. For the price of 20 Rupees, Link is given six questions that all have to be answered correctly, and every correct question will yield him a couple of Rupees as a prize. These questions are mostly about the Gorons of the island, such as how many homes there were or what some Gorons talk about. After getting all of the questions right, Biggoron is amazed by Link's knowledge, rewarding him with a
   Wisdom Gem
   . He also announces that Link is now a Goron, provided that he pays 146 Rupees, which was the very same amount that he wins as prizes in the quiz. After paying the Goron leader, he is given the name Goro-Link and is now officially a part of the tribe. Upon Link's membership, Biggoron declares that Link is free to take the Crimsonine from the

   The next time they see him, Gongoron is being attacked by

Gongoron and Link both have to be controlled to defeat the boss, due to each ones' abilities and Dongorongo's weaknesses. After Dondgorongo is hit enough times, it passed out, which Gongoron mistakes as a defeat and runs off into the next room containing the Crimsonine. A bridge appears over the quicksand and allows Link to cross, only for it to disappear again as Dongorongo awakens, challenging Link again only without Gongoron's assistance. After its true defeat, Dongorongo dissolves away. Link then hurries to the next room where Gongoron allows him to have the Crimsonine.

   Back outside, Link visits Biggoron again who had been told what had happened by Gongoron. Biggoron, greatly impressed by Link's courage and strength, says that he is now worthy to leave the island; suggesting that all Gorons on the island have to leave at some point. This is also evident by a Goron outside who was watching the
   SS Linebeck
   . Biggoron also leaves the Crimsonine with Link and says that he can do anything with it, including boiling it or forging it. Link then leaves the island with the Pure Metal, not without the other Gorons saying their farewells and hoping that he would come back for a visit.

   . Their appearance has not changed drastically from previous incarnations; most gorons have their hair in a topknot, and wear a mawashi or fundoshi, and the rocky growth on their backs are still present. The children all wear bibs, and the elderly have a hunch and a large beard. Some appear in that same pale colour, but there is more variation after the many millennia that have passed, namely orange, like
   Jengo
   , a darker beige which can be seen is
   Aji
   , and dark brown, such as
   Dorill
   and his son
   Axyl
   , or even a off-mossy green, seen mostly in elderly gorons, those being
   Grapp
   and
   Bohrin
   , but also in
   Kairo
   . They have a large mining industry which digs up the plethora of ore that can be found on

   and sells it to allow their hometown to prosper. Miners all wear
   Helmets
   and carry large pickaxes. There are two main mines, those being the
   Southern Mine
   , where most current miners can be found, and the
   Abandoned North Mine
   . The latter was more prosperous but when
   Divine Beast Vah Rudania
   showed up, lava levels rose and many
   Fire-Breath Lizalfos
   made their home there, forcing the gorons to make do with the former. Goron City is well protected from
   monsters
   ; the miner
   Drak
   keeps watch at the entrance to the abandoned north mine armed with a
   Cobble Crusher
   to make sure nothing goes in or comes out. There are also guards at the
   top
   and the
   bottom
   of goron city, each with a cobble crusher and bronze face visor.

   tourists, such as
   the armour shop
   and the
   outdoor grill
   . Other shops, such as the
   Goron Gusto Shop
   or
   Rollin' Inn
   , appear to have use to the general goron population as well as miscellaneous travelers.
   Offrak
   also sells
   Fireproof Elixers
   to people who can't withstand the heat. Gorons have no need for those goods, as they have flame-resistant bodies and eat
   Rock Roasts
   , as can be seen when
   Bladon
   prepares one for his
   brother
   , or from
   Daruk's Training Journal
   . There is an
   ambassador of tourism
   for Goron City, who promotes it to people he meets.  As well as that, they are seen going to settlements of other races, such as
   Reagah
   visiting

   Bludo
   in driving away the divine beast by being fired out of a cannon, as he had
   Daruk's Protection
   , allowing him to take hits completely unscathed. Daruk's spirit was worried that the gorons hadn't fared well after the

   The legacy of past gorons such as
   Biggoron
   or
   Medigoron
   is still going, as the venerable blacksmith
   Rohan
   keeps the "ancient arts" alive, according to his assistant
   Fugo
   . Rohan will recreate the
   Boulder Breaker
   for Link should it break, at the cost of one cobble crusher, five pieces of
   Flint
   and one
   Diamond
   . He may also be the source of other weapons, such as
   Stone Smashers
   ,
   Drillshafts
   ,
   Iron Sledgehammers
   and the flame weapons (the
   Flameblade
   ,
   Flamespear
   and
   Great Flameblade
   ). He does not craft
   Biggoron's Sword
   , but this can still be obtained through the use of
   Amiibo
   .

   Gorons have families in this game, but only brothers, fathers, sons etc. No female gorons appear, further denying speculations that female gorons exist, and no gorons are seen in relationships. Some do have biological brothers, such as
   Bladon
   and
   Gonguron
   ,
   Greyson
   and
   Pelison
   , and the three goron blood brothers,
   Bayge
   ,
   Heehl
   and
   Kabetta
   . There are also examples of fathers, as
   Dorill
   is the father of
   Axyl
   , and grandfathers, with
   Grapp
   being
   Dugby
   's grandfather, and
   Daruk
   as
   Yunobo
   's.
   Rohan
   ,
   Fugo
   and
   Slergo
   have clear family ties, but it isn't explicitely stated what those are in-game. It can sometimes be hard to tell which gorons are biological brothers, and the term "brother" is used to refer to pretty much anyone by gorons.

They often enjoy a good roll around, and their diet consists mainly of the gourmet rocks that they mine from Dodongo's Cavern. They also enjoy the music of a certain Kokiri girl.

   The name Goron may have originated from ゴロゴロ "goro goro," Japanese

   for the sound of a rolling rock, or more specifically, a boulder. The name Goron could also be related to the word "gora" (mountain) found in various Slavic languages.
   This would be appropriate as the Gorons' homeland is up in the mountains.
