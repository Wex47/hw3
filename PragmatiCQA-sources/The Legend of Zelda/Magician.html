    , the Magician initially appears in the same backstory as in the manual, making a deal with the Prince and placing the first Zelda in an eternal slumber. Unlike in the manual, the Magician escapes from the Prince after being wounded by his sword. Link soon encounters the Magician in the present day during his trek through Death Mountain. Here, the Magician is in charge of a cult comprised of Ganon's minions, inciting their mission to spill Link's blood on Ganon's ashes, in order to revive their master.

    After Link is forced to kill his mentor, a wolfman named Ganpu, Link has a nightmare of Hyrule under the oppression of the Magician, with an overlord acting as his emissary. Just as the overlord is about to bring harm to Zelda, Link strikes his mask and unveils

    . Immediately afterwards, Link wakes up. After Link crosses the sea to Eastern Hyrule, the Magician unleashes a storm that wrecks his ship. The Magician then launches an attack on the town of Darunia, but fails. A second attack is launched after the taming of the River Devil, leading to the death of the current Zelda, not knowing that Zelda, Link, and the royal guard Billy were all in disguise. This attack is successful as the Magician now has blood needed to revive Ganon. By mistake, his minions have obtained Zelda's blood, rather than Link's, making the revival incomplete.
   </p>
   In the final volume, the Magician starts an all-out attack on Link, having learned of the young hero's success in returning the crystals to the temples. After Link narrowly escapes Ganon, following the retrieval of the Triforce of Courage, the Magician attempts to steal the Triforce in the guise of one of the nursemaids. Link sees through the disguise and cleaves off the Magician's mask. Zelda I recognizes him as both Ganon and her brother's aide. The Magician reveals that he has been attempting to get the Triforce for countless centuries, rapidly decaying before Ganon bursts through his body and snatches the Triforce. With his dying breath, the Magician reveals that Ganon is his alter-ego, and that his revival was necessary for him to continue living. He soon realizes that his own ambitions were his undoing and passes away, calling out to Zelda for her forgiveness.
