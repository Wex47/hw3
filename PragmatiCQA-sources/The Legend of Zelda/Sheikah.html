   The Sheikah were originally chosen by the Goddess Hylia to serve as guardians, and have been highly devoted to the Royal Family of Hyrule, her reincarnation's descendants, since the inception of the tribe.
   Various incarnations of Princess Zelda are often protected by different Sheikah women who share the name of Impa. Often Impa is shown to be very protective and concerned for the safety of the Princess. Several examples of this include Impa's steadfast shielding and protection of Hylia, reborn as the mortal

   . These include the many
   Howling Stones
   scattered about Hyrule, which depict the eye symbol as their motif. Curiously, the Sheikah symbol makes an appearance on the back of the robes worn by the imprisoned Princess Zelda at the game's beginning.
   Madame Fanadi
   , a fortune-teller from
   Hyrule Castle Town
   , also bears the Sheikah eye on her forehead amongst other tattoos, as well as having the Sheikah-exclusive red eyes.

   One member of the Sheikah tribe, Impa, appears as both a young and old woman in the game. She serves as a guardian to the reborn Goddess and protects

   at her bidding, aiding Zelda in her quest to defeat
   Demise
   .
   The familiar eye symbol is tattooed in orange on her forehead, and her left eye is tattooed with the three white marks above and a white teardrop below in the form of the same symbol. It should be noted that, despite being likely the purest Sheikah ever met, she still has blonde hair, not white. From this, it is obvious that even though white hair is a common characteristic of Sheikah biology, not every Sheikah to live will have white hair. Despite this, Impa still bears red eyes. She demonstrates powerful magical abilities while protecting Zelda from
   Ghirahim
   , an intimate knowledge of the Goddess's design, and was associated with the Goddess before she relinquished her immortal form.

   though, about 10,000 years ago, their technological power came to be viewed as a threat to the kingdom and thus put them at odds with the King and the people.
   Cado mentions that the Sheikah were exiled and Rensa mentions that they were scattered across the land.
   Some, decided to cast off their technological advances to live normal lives.
   However, The

   Spearheaded by

   Whilst the sheikah appear physically similar to previous incarnations, some variations do occur. Many members don't have the distinctive red eyes; the only person who is confirmed to is
   Impa
   's older sister
   Purah
   . The average Sheikah exhibits either grey, brown or blue eyes. Variations in hair colour also occur. Most sheikah have iconic white hair, including almost all of the
   Kakariko residents
   and all of the
   Monks
   ; all Yiga clansmen however have what appears to be black hair. It is confirmed that this is indeed their hair, showing diversity does occur within the race

  <p key="12b1bb9d-5984-4833-b987-234b78bd2120">
   The civilization of the Sheikah is said to have disappeared long ago;
   however, many remnants of them and their technology still exist in Hyrule, especially within the
   Ancient Shrines
   and
   Sheikah Towers
   . These house elements of their civilization, most notably the Sheikah eye symbol, their
   script
   , and advanced technology.
   Link awakens within the
   Shrine of Resurrection
   , a Shrine that not only contains the Sheikah eye symbol, but also the
   Sheikah Slate
   , a device of Sheikah origin. This device, in turn, can awaken both the Shrines and Towers.
   As Link travels across Hyrule, he locates many other Shrines where, at the end, he meets their respective ancient Sheikah
   Monks
   ,
   who bequeath him their
   Spirit Orbs
   once they are reached.

  <p key="9ccfd56f-b643-4eba-aa9a-41310a1fb24b">
   The attire of the Sheikah in this game brings a sense of uniformity, with all Sheikah wearing distinct beige, red and navy blue garb. This clothing was made with the ancient prowess of the Sheikah, so it has practical usage: the clothes are completely waterproof and even ward off
   Lightning
   . Some also adopt head-mounted umbrellas when going outside to protect from the rain. Both the clothes and umbrellas are only allowed to be worn by Sheikah, so Hylians such as Link or
   Sagessa
   cannot purchase or even borrow them
   . The
   Monks
   do not wear this, instead opting for simple tan trousers, and gold jewelry; some wear white veils with the
   Sheikah Eye
   on it over their face, and a handful also have a large hat, very similar to the one worn by
   Impa
   , either on their head or on their back.

     manga
    </a>
    by
    Akira Himekawa
    , it is explained that the Sheikah Eye Symbol was once represented as a single eye without a tear. This changed when, long ago, an act of betrayal on the part of the Royal Family of Hyrule occurred, resulting in the banishment of the Sheikah tribe from the kingdom of Hyrule for a long time. To commemorate this event, the tear was added to symbolize the great sorrow felt by the tribe, which was sworn to protect the Royal Family.
    The manga also states that pierced ears were a traditional Sheikah rite of passage for young males.
