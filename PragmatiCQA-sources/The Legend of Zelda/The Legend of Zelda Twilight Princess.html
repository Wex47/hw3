   In his Wolf form, Link returns to Ordon Village to find it infested with Bulblins. He acquires the
   Sword
   intended for the Royal Family,
   along with a
   Shield
   from the Village. Before Link returns to the wall of Twilight, he is summoned by
   Ordona
   , the Spirit of Ordon Spring and one of the four

   Link returns to the Twilight-covered Faron Woods and finds
   Faron

   Tears of Light

   He requests that Link enter the Goron Mines and aid Darbus.

   She reveals that Shadow Beasts attacked Zora's Domain and executed her.
   She sent her son, Prince Ralis, to Hyrule Castle to inform Princess Zelda of their tribe's fate, but fears that something terrible happened to him.

   Snowpeak
   . Telma's acquaintance,
   Ashei

   creature
   that has been spotted in Zora's Domain and gives him a
   Sketch
   she drew of it.
   She recommends that Link should not set out for the mountain without a plan, as the blizzards in the area are harsh.
   Link consults Ralis about the creature, and shows him Ashei's Sketch. Ralis recognizes the creature and remarks about the
   Reekfish
   it is holding.
   The Zora prince gives Link his
   Coral Earring
   and tells him that he can use it as bait to fish for Reekfish near the
   Mother-and-Child Rocks
   in Zora's Domain.
   Ralis decides to return to his village when the time comes.
   Link proceeds to Zora's Domain and catches a Reekfish. It gives off a Scent, prompting Link to transform into his Wolf form to sniff it. The Scent leads into Snowpeak and effectively serves as a path through the blizzard for Link. He ends up at the top of the mountain and finds the mysterious creature from Ashei's Sketch holding a large Reekfish, the source of the Scent. The creature's name is
   Yeto
   , and he reveals that he has found a Shard of the Mirror of Twilight.
   He invites Link to
   his house
   so he can obtain it.

   Link consults Yeta, who tries to remember the location of the Key to the master bedroom. She gets the location wrong several times due to her illness, sending Link on numerous misadventures through the Ruins. Eventually, she finally gets it right and sends Link to the room where the
   Bedroom Key
   is located. Link collects the key, and Yeta greets him as he exits the room, having recovered from her illness by drinking Yeto’s soup. She offers to take him to the master bedroom where the Mirror Shard is located.
   When the two approach the Mirror Shard, Yeta stares into it, commenting on the Mirror's beauty.
   The Shard corrupts Yeta and transforms her into the gigantic
   Blizzeta

   forcing Link to battle her. Eventually, Link defeats her, releasing her from the Mirror's influence. Link and Midna depart with the Mirror Shard as Yeto and Yeta share a warm embrace.

   She thanks Link for defeating the Bulblins and gives him
   Ilia's Charm

   Link and Midna return to the Mirror Chamber and restore the Mirror of Twilight with the Shards they collected. The Ancient Sages reveal that Midna is the original ruler of the Twili,
   and that she had her power suppressed by Zant, who transformed her into her current imp form. As a result, Midna was forced to flee her people.
   The Twili believed that the hero would appear in the Twilight Realm in the form of a divine beast,
   and Midna thought that she could use Link to save the Twilight Realm from Zant, while remaining apathetic about the World of Light.
   However, after witnessing the immense courage and sacrifices of Link and Zelda, Midna developed a change of heart. She tells Link that they are now fighting to save both worlds, and the two use the Mirror of Twilight to enter the Twilight Realm.

   After announcing his master's wish to create darkness by merging shadow and light,
   Zant proceeds to battle Link. Link defeats him, and Midna regains the Fused Shadows. However, the curse that Zant placed on Midna does not break, since it was Ganondorf's magic that enabled him to curse her.
   Zant reveals that Ganondorf has been reborn and claims that his master will resurrect him.
   Midna uses the Fused Shadows to destroy Zant, and realizes that Ganondorf is responsible for the magical barrier over Hyrule Castle and is there now.
   They return to Hyrule and Midna uses the regained Fused Shadows to break the seal surrounding the Castle.

After this, the power Zelda gave to Midna to save her life returns to her, reviving the Princess. However, Ganondorf once again transforms into his "God" form, and Midna warps Link and Zelda outside the Castle before using the Fused Shadows to fight him. The resulting battle destroys Hyrule Castle, and Ganondorf is shown to be victorious as he crushes Midna's helmet. Ganondorf and his minions charge towards Link and Zelda on horseback, but Zelda summons the four Spirits of Light, who grant her the
   Light Arrows

   Link summons Epona, and he and Zelda ride her to battle Ganondorf. Zelda uses the Light Arrows to stun Ganondorf, and Link knocks him off his
   Horse
   . Link and Ganondorf then battle on foot with the Master Sword and the Sword of the Sages, respectively. Eventually, Link strikes Ganondorf down and plunges the Master Sword into his chest, killing him once and for all. This releases the curse on Midna, who is revived by the Spirits of Light, restoring her to her true form.

In order to swing the sword which Link uses as a weapon, the player makes a slashing motion with the Wii Remote. A jab with the tilt-sensitive Nunchuk will cause Link to perform one of his secret moves, the shield attack. To use Link’s “spin attack” (a powerful attack where Link swings his sword circularly around himself), the player shakes the Nunchuk side to side horizontally.

When an item's respective direction button is pressed, the item is switched into the 'B' button for easier use. The built-in speaker on the remote is used for sounds like the bowstring of the Hero's Bow being drawn and released, Midna's laugh, and the ever-present "Zelda chime" when discovering secrets.

   Nintendo
   had decided not to use an orchestrated soundtrack has been a point of criticism for the game. Koji Kondo, the lead composer for the game's soundtrack, originally stated that he "would really like to push for" the music to be orchestrated. Part of the full soundtrack (featuring the songs "

The first bonus track, known as "D.S. Trailer Pack", was the theme that was to be used instead of the present Hyrule Field Main Theme.

   A version of the game's Hyrule Field theme was recorded with a live orchestra before release. It was probably intended to be used in the final game; however it ended up being used only in pre-release demos and promotional material.

   Along with the standard features of sound in a Zelda game, the Wii console offers something more to the customers buying the Wii version of Twilight Princess. Using the Wii Remote, various sound effects (sword swing, Midna's calls, etc.) come from both the television and the Wii Remote's internal speaker, improving the overall game experience.

   <i key="9ac6b488-cc64-49c8-823a-3b84fc190ce6">
    Zelda
   </i>
   game of all time. Clocking with a 94-95% approval on Metacritic and a similar compilation score on GameRankings, the game was praised in nearly every aspect. IGN editor Matt Cassamassina stated that
   <i key="c757cfbe-aa6d-46e5-bff1-60d0ece3df3a">
    Ocarina of Time
   </i>
   was dethroned by this game, citing the length of the adventure, the storyline and the gameplay,
   and concluding that it "...is must-see, must-play and must-own entry into the series that proves over and over again why Nintendo is the best developer in the world". However, Matt also lamented that the game used MIDI-based soundtrack, instead of an orchestrated score, and that the characters lacked yet again fully-voiced speech.

   Kristan Reed from Eurogamer initially warned that games created to be overly long usually may end up being tiring and in need of replay value, in contrast to shorter games that sometimes offer richer experiences; however, he also said that
   <i key="ce7e6861-9f9f-49eb-9b04-9ccacd0edcf7">
    Twilight Princess
   </i>
   succeeds in being consistent and keeping the player interested in it despite its pronounced length. Kristan also considers the game a true successor to
   <i key="9abbb092-13fd-4219-a682-6b93aa0feb43">
    Ocarina of Time
   </i>
   thanks to the elements borrowed from the 1998 game,
   and that the Wii controls work well despite the game being originally developed for the GameCube only; as for complaints, he said that most bosses are easier to defeat than expected, and that the overworld's huge size makes the game's pacing more difficult when it comes to completing the main objectives.
  </p>
  <p key="fd62e1a3-ed20-463e-aafb-6485ba4a7516">
   1UP.com journalist Jeremy Parish commended the game for living up to the series' legacy and "appealing" for gamers that expressed complaints on some aspects of
   <i key="7b905ab8-bcd3-4e6e-adac-c1b369487147">
    The Wind Waker
   </i>
   , mainly the graphical style;
   he also praised the implementation of Wii controls, as well as the size of the adventure. He said that the only shortcoming of the game (and therefore in disagreement with Kristan from Eurogamer) was the fact that the game was too similar to
   <i key="e8151843-e00b-4525-ade8-0c93525e1138">
    Ocarina of Time
   </i>
   , and that it felt "predictable" in some aspects, mainly in gameplay and storyline.
  </p>
  <p key="e6bf52b9-484f-431c-a48a-d8f7d408a29c">
   GameSpot critic Jeff Gerstmann was more critical, and stated that the Wii controls feel "tacked-on" because of the fact that the game started as a project exclusive for the GameCube; for the same reason, he considered that the graphics felt outdated, therefore lacking the visual impact of other Wii games,
   and thus concluded that Twilight Princess "...could have been so much more with a few presentational updates and more effective and interesting uses of the Wii's unique control scheme". However, he ultimately recommended the game, citing the legacy it took from the other games in the series.

  <p key="45e564aa-f406-42ea-912d-fb158e2779d2">
   Despite the positive reviews, there are mixed opinions in regards of whether the game has surpassed

   </i>
   or not, as well as whether the game itself is a current-generation game or an old-generation title delayed multiple times since its 2004 announcement. Likewise, some journalists have criticized the fact that the game undid the ambition factor seen in games like

    In the English translation of the game, Princess Zelda mentions that light and darkness co-exist in a world of balance, giving the impression that darkness is a fundamental element of the Zelda universe. In the original Japanese text, the princess speaks only about the ability of light to drive away darkness, literally and metaphorically.
