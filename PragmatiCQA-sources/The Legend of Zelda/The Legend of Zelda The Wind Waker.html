   Ganondorf, the great evil that all still thought to be sealed away in the
   Sacred Realm
   of Hyrule, crept forth, eager to resume his dark designs.
   As the darkness was spreading over the kingdom, the people hoped that the Hero of Time would once again appear to save them, but the hero did not appear.
   Ganon's next step was to make another aggressive move for the

   As doom drew nigh, the king and his people prayed to the gods, leaving their kingdom in the hands of fate.
   The goddesses answered their prayers by instructing those chosen to flee for the mountaintops, before they flooded the land. Ganondorf and his minions were sealed along with Hyrule in an enchanted air chamber at the bottom of the sea, with the Master Sword serving as the key suspending the flow of time within the chamber. Over the centuries, the memory of the kingdom vanished, but its legend survived on the wind's breath.

   The King tells him of the story behind the shadowy figure at the Forsaken Fortress, revealing it to be Ganondorf. Somehow, the seal of the gods had failed.
   The King explains to Link that the key to defeating Ganondorf is locked away in a great power, the

   Link meets up with Quill again and learns that the Rito are having trouble with the Sky Spirit,
   Valoo
   , atop the mountain on the Island. Fledgling Rito earn scales from Valoo that allow them to grow their wings, but the Dragon has somehow lost control of itself.
   He also learns that Din's Pearl is in the possession of a young Rito named
   Prince Komali
   , who is afraid of earning a scale from Valoo.
   However, Komali refuses to give the Pearl to Link,
   as it is a gift from his deceased grandmother.
   With the help of a friendly Rito named
   Medli

   Ganon's Tower

   Knights of Hyrule
   were unable to assail in ages past.
   Link makes haste for the tower and scales it. Ganondorf is waiting for him, sitting on a bed where Zelda is sleeping. He expresses his outrage at the concept of people living on the Great Sea above Hyrule with little to nothing to achieve.
   He then transforms into a
   large marionette-like creature
   to battle Link, who defeats him. Ganondorf takes Zelda away and tells Link to follow and stand before him.
   He catches Link off guard and knocks him down, and proceeds to summon the pieces of the Triforce from within Link and Zelda, along with his own to assemble the full Triforce. He wishes for the rays of the sun to expose Hyrule anew so that the kingdom and the world may be his.

   In a fit of madness, Ganondorf attacks Link. With the Master Sword at its full power, Link and Zelda battle Ganondorf as Hyrule floods around them. Link eventually deals the final blow to Ganondorf, stabbing him through his head and turning him to stone. After bidding farewell to the King of Hyrule, Link and Zelda are spirited away to the surface of the Great Sea as the floodwaters come crashing down, burying Hyrule and its King beneath the Sea. Link and Tetra are reunited with Aryll, the Pirates, and some of Link's friends.

During his quest, he also explores dungeons, solves the puzzles within, fulfills various crucial challenges, and defeats multiple enemies.

   As mentioned above, the magical baton gives Link the ability to control the wind's direction as soon as he learns the proper melody. Manipulating the wind not only makes sea navigation faster, it also gives the legendary hero multiple other possible uses for the wind, such as being able to glide with the
   Deku Leaf
   for long periods of time, making a character give different notes of information, helping other characters fly farther, and even causing a treasure chest to appear when Link stands before a marked wind spot, among other things. After learning another song, Link can use the power of cyclones to
   warp
   from one island to another, reducing the amount of time taken to reach a destination. Other melodies serve purposes less related to wind, but still give more versatility and usefulness to the Wind Waker.

   Spoils Bag
   keeps several jewels and items that enemies drop upon death, and can be used for further purposes, such as preparing potions, receiving rewards, or helping people in need of them. The
   Bait Bag
   is of great utility as it keeps food for animals and creatures in exchange for either prizes, new information regarding something or even control of seagulls. The
   Delivery Bag
   is used to keep letters, souvenirs, or even documents, and is heavily used in a sidequest regarding a trading sequence that ultimately leads to an optional magical artifact.

   Pictograph Box
   , which this time has a much more extensive use; for example, there is a sidequest, the Nintendo Gallery, that consists of taking a pictograph of every single character, creature, and any other living being, either divine or merely mortal, in the game. The camera can be upgraded to take full-color shots and, unlike in the game it debuted, it can now support three pictographs. Another returning element is the ability to control other characters through psychic faculty. After learning the right melody, Link can control seagulls, statues, and secondary characters he previously met in his travels. This important ability is used in three dungeons, which require the Link to control characters or statues.

These elements were present to a limited degree in the prior games for

   The game features strings, flutes, and horns in the background, such as when opening a
   Treasure Chest
   . Sometimes, electronic instruments are used in themes such as
   Gohdan
   's boss battle theme, whose main melody is played on an entirely electronic instrument. For the most part, the music is based upon traditional Celtic themes, with several themes using bagpipes. The "intro story" theme is entirely based upon European baroque, renaissance and
   medieval
   music and instruments. The game also features Link and other characters being more active with his speech. For example, when Link is stalking
   Mila
   , he "meows" when she may have noticed him, or calls certain NPCs with English words. Though

   includes a tune that is heard during enemy proximity, but it is more developed because more notes and sounds of instruments are added when either Link or the enemy is attacked, especially when an attack is successful. A similar audio technique is used when a mini-boss is faced; drums are added to the theme once Link or the miniboss engages the other.

   Because of the three-month difference between the game's Japanese release in December 14, 2002 and North America's in March 24, 2003, some moderately significant changes were made in the North American and international versions. One of the more noticeable changes involves the fifth
   Triforce Chart
   ; in the Japanese version, the chart is found after recovering various
   Treasure Charts
   from the sea, with one chart pinpointing another's location, while in the international versions, these charts are found in dungeons and pinpoint the location of

   The game is set in the
   Great Sea
   , a vast body of water consisting of 49 islands, which are of different sizes, shapes, and purposes. Some are inhabited islands, and they house dungeons, sidequests, shops, and many other things; these include
   Dragon Roost Island

   There are islands that are either uninhabited or overrun by monsters, but are still key places for Link's quest.

   Mother and Child Isles

   Fire Mountain
   and
   Ice Ring Isle
   all house major treasure weapons and tools that help the young hero have access to Temples where the Sages blessing the

   must pray; said temples are, respectively, in the
   Headstone Island
   and the
   Gale Isle
   . Additionally, there are numerous islands where Link finds the widely-spoken
   Triumph Forks
   , which pinpoint the fragments of the
   Triforce of Courage
   as long as they're deciphered (which can be done by negotiating with
   Tingle
   in
   Tingle Island
   ).

  <p key="2ada6ef1-efe2-4f28-98cd-1a8f7ddb5baf">
   There are also islands that are similar to each other, for they share a similar purpose. For example, the three
   Triangle Islands
   are where Link must place the sacred Pearls in order to unveil the aforementioned Tower of the Gods.
   Five islands
   house
   Great Fairy
   entities, ready to improve Link's capabilities for weapon ammunition or even money amounts. There are also
   Eye Reefs
   invaded by multiple enemies and belic cannons, hiding Treasure Charts that lead to much more special charts. These charts give Link location of a wide variety of quest items or secret features. Finally, there are
   three archipelagos
   that are nothing but isolated rock formations with no possibility for human landing.

  <p key="2bd8b8ed-9cc5-46e1-abd9-063b2174ad49">

      A vast amount of unused stages, meant for the final release of the game, can be found within the disk.
      Most notably, a huge amount of unused rooms are present in various degrees of completion.
      These range from a very old forest area that was showcased in the game's first E3 trailer, to multiple test rooms, and even places intended for the final release, like a different design for the Tower of the Gods and an art studio on Tingle Island. More unused areas exist than the amount of islands in the final game.

The most well known concept was of Link getting progressively older as the game went on, but was scrapped because of difficulties implementing this idea. Another example, an island resembling a Nintendo GameCube was drawn, possibly the source of inspiration for
      Dee Ess Island

      . Another concept was that Link could interact with the submerged Hyrule through special portals around the Great Sea, guarded by actual fishermen. This would likely have been the implementation of walking underwater, as described above. Remnants of that idea can be seen via hacking Link to be under the ocean; he can walk on invisible ground below the water.
