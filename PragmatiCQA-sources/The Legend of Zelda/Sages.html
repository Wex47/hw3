The Sages often only take on these roles upon being "awakened" during a time that they are required, their role predetermined through a spiritual lineage or bloodline connecting them to a past Sage. Throughout Hyrule's history, Sages have been abducted and killed to prevent them from uniting their powers against evildoers. In such cases, only the Hero has what it takes to save them or find and awaken the new Sages to aid him in return.

   Nabooru tried to infiltrate the

   in the past years to thwart Ganondorf's plans, but got captured and brainwashed to be a servant of Ganondorf for seven years. Her mental imprisonment ended when Link defeated her Iron Knuckle form, but she was recaptured shortly thereafter. Link permanently freed her and awakened her as a Sage when he defeated Twinrova. For that, she gave him the
   Spirit Medallion
   , but not before she complimented him on the results of seven years aging. At the battle with Ganondorf, she fulfilled her role as Sage and could later be seen traveling to Death Mountain with the other Sages.
