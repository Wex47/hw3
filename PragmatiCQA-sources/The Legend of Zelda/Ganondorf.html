   within the series; as such, he is a villain of pure evil and a cruel, ruthless warlord whose goal is to usurp the Kingdom of Hyrule. Ganon's only ambition in life is to obtain the Triforce and dominate the world using the abilities imbued by them. He has many characteristics of a megalomaniac. Despite his undeniable lust for power, Ganon is a mastermind; he is an adept tactician and a master of manipulation and deceit. It is not unusual for Ganon to manipulate the events of a story behind the scenes (as he did in

   ), only to be revealed as the orchestrator in a plot twist. Ganon usually presents himself with the facade of a cynical yet calm and civil man, although he is known to very quickly become enraged, ensuing in a murderous rampage. Ganon has no sense of morality. In his conquest of the Sacred Realm, once he reached the
   Temple of Light
   , he single-handedly killed all of his followers who had aided him in his expedition, so that he could claim the Triforce uncontested. He is also culturally inclined, playing the organ with great skill, as seen in

   where he plays his own theme throughout Link's attack in his
   Tower
   . Ganon also possesses an arrogant sense of entitlement; he believes himself to be the only one worthy of ruling the kingdom of Hyrule. His pride is also shown when fighting enemies: despite being more than capable of defeating most enemies in combat, Ganon instead relies on his minions to defeat them. Apparently, he chooses to only fight opponents he deems worthy, such as Link.

   Ganon is also an extremely destructive being. Conquest and destruction seem to be one and the same to him, and examples of his rule have shown him willingly turning his dominion into a wicked place of terror and chaos.

   execution

   His power, with or without the Triforce, appears to grow over time. The sages in Arbiter's Grounds, when discussing his evil power, mention it being pure malice and hatred. As the Calamity-Ganon, his very essence is known as 'malice', possibly meaning that his demonic magic and power is fuelled as much by his own hatred as the Triforce, and his capacity for hatred is the only true limit on how powerful he can grow.

   As Hyrule's new king, Ganondorf gained even more knowledge regarding the Triforce. Because his heart was not in balance, he was only bestowed one third of the element: the Triforce of Power. With all of the luxury and power of the subdued kingdom at his disposal, the Sorcerer Evil King is able to wait for the moment when the two remaining Triforce keepers, Link and Zelda, would reveal themselves. Eventually, he finds them in the

   The three Triforce possessors meet again in

Ganondorf taunts the young hero and engages him in battle, where Link is able to defeat the tyrant with the aid of the Light Arrows and the Master Sword.
   Using the last of his power, Ganondorf tries to make his castle collapse to kill Link and Zelda, but the two manage to escape safely.
   However, an exhausted Ganondorf uses the essence of the Triforce of Power to transform into a bestial monstrosity called Ganon. Despite his massive size and clever tactics, Link manages to defeat him using the

   Ganondorf is then sealed into the void of the Evil Realm where he cannot harm Hyrule or lay his hands on the remaining pieces of the Triforce.
   As he is sealed in the Sacred Realm, Ganondorf claims that when he breaks the seal, he will destroy Link and Zelda's descendants,
   knowing that he will have the opportunity as long as he possesses the Triforce of Power.

   in Hyrule and Link begins his quest to reawaken the Master Sword, whose power had vanished since Ganondorf had murdered the Sages in charge of keeping the power within the sacred blade.
   Once Link achieves his goals of finding the Triforce of Courage and restoring the Master Sword to its former glory, Ganondorf locates their haven and consequently captures Zelda, whom he takes to his underwater
   Tower
   .
   Link finds Zelda unharmed, lying in a bed, sleeping, with Ganondorf watching over her and her dreams.
   However, before Link has any chance to approach, Ganondorf unleashes a bewitched,
   giant puppet
   , which Link defeats.
   Ganondorf finally reappears to challenge Link, and with Zelda in his arm, he rises to the rooftop of the Tower.
  </p>
  <p key="84eb8e14-5cf3-4cd5-a400-24d75bb527bb">
   Soon after Link reaches the rooftop, Ganondorf speaks to him about his reasons for desperately searching for the Triforce pieces, revealing a little of his origins from the harsh

   and his desire to take over the green landscapes of Hyrule. When he declares that he already has in his possession the Triforce of Wisdom, Ganondorf suddenly rushes against Link and delivers swift, hard blows that leave Link half-conscious and the Master Sword out of reach. Ganondorf, using his Triforce of Power, summons the two missing Triforce pieces from Link and Zelda and reforms the

   Nevertheless, right before Ganondorf is able to touch the Triforce and make his wish come true of conquering Hyrule,

   , appears to touch the Triforce first and makes the wish of washing away the ancient land of Hyrule.
   The Triforce disappears and water starts pouring through the protective barrier into the land of Hyrule as Ganondorf laughs scornfully. Link wakes up at that point and Zelda approaches him holding the Master Sword for Link to engage Ganondorf in a last battle. Ultimately with Zelda's aid, Ganondorf is defeated when Link deals the final blow by plunging the Master Sword straight into Ganondorf's forehead, turning him into stone
   and killing him.
   Immediately before his death, however, Ganondorf, with slight satisfaction, referenced the brutal winds that had long plagued the Gerudo.
   His body remains atop the Tower under the
   Great Sea
   with the Master Sword in his head, and the ocean finally drowns Hyrule under the Great Sea. With his death Ganondorf was freed of his obsessive desire for the Triforce.

    This was largely excised in the final version with Ganondorf instead merely assuring them that their conflict won't end then and there as "the history of light and shadow will be written in blood", although the Hyrule Historia nonetheless made clear that a reincarnation of Ganondorf did indeed reappear. Demise's curse at the end of Skyward Sword resembled this cut speech.
