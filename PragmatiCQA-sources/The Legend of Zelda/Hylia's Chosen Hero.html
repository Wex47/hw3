    Ready to fight with his allies against Demise and his army, the Goddess Hylia suddenly appears in person, riding on an old Loftwing. The articulate Loftwing expresses his low opinion of the
    Hylians
    , saying that they are useless and didn't know the differences of deities and monsters. He could not believe that the hero who would ride him and face Demise could be among the people of the Surface.
    Link reveals himself as the Knight of Hylia and the hero whom they sought. He claims that, although humans may seem small in the eyes of the gods, there are those among them who possess great courage.
    The old Crimson Loftwing gains interest in Link, and orders him to show him how worthy he truly is while he departs.
    Meanwhile, the Goddess Hylia, sensing the Demon King's upcoming arrival to the Surface, convince to her people to escape to the sky with the Loftwing guiding them there.
    Hylia acknowledges her knight's unmatched valiance and honor and proclaims him again her chosen hero. She then allows him to wield her legendary weapon brought by the gods, the

    .
    However, Link sorrowfully claims that he could not touch a holy sword, thinking that he is impure because he was imprisoned for years.
    Despite this, Hylia says that the Master Sword will decide whether he is impure or not, and asks him for his choice; to seek revenge on the surface's people who imprisoned him or to save the world from its terrible fate.
    Hylia's chosen hero decides that he will always stand with his friends and accepts the Master Sword from the goddess.

    The war had already begun, the Goddess Hylia and her chosen hero's army had been fighting Demise and his army of monsters for a week.
    The world's tribes supports Link and the Hylians on the war, fighting the demons, and the hero is facing Demise on his own.
    Unfortunately, Demise was unbeatable and the hero is critically wounded by the Demon King by one hit.
    As he was about to pass on, the Goddess's Loftwing allows him to ride on his back and fight together. The hero asks for the Loftwing's guidance to show his people to the skies, to which the Loftwing agrees to as long as the hero continues to fly with him.
    At that moment, the three legendary dragons,

    They reveal the legacy of the gods dwells within the Master Sword.
    The hero gives the holy blade to the Goddess, so she can send the Hylian people and their kingdom to the skies with a single sweep of the Master Sword.
    The Goddess sends it back to the hero and makes the Master Sword a pillar between heaven and earth.
    Hylia's chosen hero, who is gravelly injured, stays behind and watches the land floating through the skies before passing away.
    Meanwhile, Demise could not find where the legacy of the gods is, which was revealed to be in fact the

    Finished with the Demon King, she returns to see her hero, who has already passed away. Crying, she reveals that the imprisonment was planned from the start so her chosen hero would be strong enough to save the world.
    Hylia decides that she will be reborn with her hero and live with him as a normal person, casting off her title and ensuring that his heroic spirit will live on forever.
