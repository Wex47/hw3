     The Shadow Prince

   </i>
   is a book released for the
   Nintendo Adventure Books
   series. Released in 1992, it follows the "choose-your-own-adventure" format, which means the reader could choose what the characters did and thus direct the story. In total, there are 11 different endings, one of which is the only "true" ending, while the rest are endings in which Link dies under different circumstances. As the reader follows along, they will receive various items that may or may not help them along the adventure; moreover, they will also receive or lose points depending on the actions they take. Adding up all the points they receive at the end allows the reader to see their "
   Triforce Protector Rating
   ." If, however, the reader chooses the wrong path, they will receive a page ending with the words "GAME OVER," indicating they must start the adventure all over again and choose a different path. The book also contains various puzzles which the reader must solve in order to help them figure out which path to take or to foreshadow what will happen next.

   , Link and Princess Zelda meet a strange knight known as
   Sir Charles
   from the kingdom of
   Moria
   . Although the princess and the
   King of Hyrule

   arrows
   for her
   bow
   and ultimately gets knocked out by a rock thrown at her. Link goes after her but trips and tumbles to the ground, and just as he is about to be killed by a Moblin, a tall, dark man known as Charles saves him by commanding the Moblin to leave. He helps Link up and then notices the unconscious Zelda, who wakes up immediately after Charles kneels at her side.

  <p key="b03ab30e-70ca-4664-99be-36e9c511407e">
   Although Link is eager to part ways with the "irritating stranger," Charles introduces himself and goes on to say that he is traveling around and doing good deeds as part of Morian custom, and once he has done enough, he will become Moria's king. Just as Zelda invites Charles to go to

  <p key="21aeb41f-5b33-4a14-a2a4-52721404da30">
   Link begins to fall behind Zelda and Charles, and starts to think of all the strange events that have happened ever since Charles arrived: how the Moblins, who outnumbered Charles twenty to one, ran away just because he commanded them to, and the fact that Darknuts had never appeared outside of a cave or a castle.
  </p>
  <p key="671d6045-91c4-4847-93fd-c644e5deeeff">
   When the group arrives to the castle, Charles meets the

   , who notices
    Charles's Necklace
    and asks if he may see it. Charles tells him he rather didn't, since it is part of Morian lore that he cannot take it off until he becomes king. Before the knight can continue,
    Dowser
    , the court hound, runs in and licks both Link's and Zelda's face, but growls at Charles and then lunges for Charles's throat. Zelda pulls the dog back and Link begins to wonder why Dowser, who is always nice to new people, does not like Charles.
  </p>
  <p key="e5fba67e-bfef-411c-a1bc-210f70c48eb5">
   During dinner, Charles brags with tales of his travels, saying he defeated twenty
    Octoroks
    with a swing of his axe, to which Link remarks that Octoroks are easy and is not impressed. When the meal is over, Link suggests to the King to have an indoor archery match in order to "teach [Charles] a thing or two."
  </p>
  <p key="cfc94aa0-a493-4480-ba45-3735dda6c07f">
   Link nervously awaits his turn, and just as Charles is about to go up to the line, he asks that Zelda hold his scarf for good luck, part of a Morian custom. Zelda agrees, and Charles makes a bullseye. Now even more nervous since his reputation as Hyrule's mightiest warrior is at stake, Link begins to choose an arrow when
    Impa
    walks towards him and tells him to use the
    Green Arrow
    that she puts in his hand, saying it is enchanted with magic. Link now has three arrows to choose from: the
    Red Darknut Arrow
    , Impa's Green Arrow, or his usual
    Blue Arrow
    .
  </p>
  <p key="96db8f44-c9e8-4a64-9147-4ee3a6e12e5b">
   The king congratulates Charles and asks Zelda if it would be too premature to show the knight of Moria the

    Triforce of Wisdom

    Ganon
   </a>
   . The shocked king asks Zelda if she believes that Charles is linked to Ganon and goes on to tell Charles that he wishes to show him the Triforce. Link, who was listening nearby, turns to Impa in outrage. Impa tells him to calm down and hands him a piece of paper into his hand that will guide him on what he should do. The piece of paper, however, is written in ancient
    Hyrulean Number-Letter Code
    . When Link deciphers it, it contains the word "Forestall."
  </p>
  <p key="e4579c76-6f77-4589-91f7-023f861b681d">
   The king, Charles, Zelda and Link head to the Triforce Room. Zelda explains that the
    Triforce of Power
    is in Ganon's hands while the
    Triforce of Courage
    is buried deep in Link's heart. The king goes on to say that if the Triforce of Wisdom were to fall in the wrong hands, it could bring ruin upon Hyrule. Charles takes a Morian oath and promises to protect the Triforce, and the king then dubs him a knight of Triforce. Link now has two choices: keep quiet or say something to the king.
  </p>
  <p key="eab3f9a1-1d8e-4b42-9a30-d53586e39298">
   Link eventually reaches the town of Saria, but no one answers to open the gate. Here, he reaches into his pocket, having either the key given to him by the old man or the magic potion given to him by the Moblin in the Midoro Swamp.
  </p>
  <p key="235f2216-ae17-4520-84ce-86731954a4bd">
   Link, finally back in his room, goes to bed to sleep. The next day, Impa wakes him up and tells him that the king has called a Royal Council, mentioning it has to do with

  </p>
  <p key="45406b13-0da6-4655-803c-c063832c8e05">
   The King of Hyrule says there have been strange reports from the citizens of

    Hyrule

   stating that an entire gang of Darknuts were spotted in the
    Jungle of Favors
    , and that a recent thunderstorm caused for Goriyas to fall from the sky. Fearing for the safety of the Triforce of Wisdom, the king says that they must move the sacred triangle to the
    Fifth Castle of Ancient Hyrule
    , which is southeast of North Castle past deserts, rivers and swamps. When Zelda asks who will deliver the Triforce of Wisdom there, the king mentions he has two heroes in mind: Link and Charles. Anxiously, Link awaits the king's decision, and it is soon revealed that Charles will be the one to take the Triforce to the Fifth Castle.
  </p>
  <p key="c20b6fc3-b04c-4c0e-8a97-53c413e8bc4a">
   Link furiously reminds the king of all the brave deeds he has done and claims that Charles can't be trusted because he is evil. The king raises his hand and silences Link, saying he better have proof to back up the serious charge he has raised against Charles.
  </p>
  <p key="1fbd9dbf-df78-403a-b3c2-f2022c29f84a">
   Link rushes through the door, but just then Impa yells out to him and tells him to follow her. They reach her chambers and Impa informs Link that she used her rune dice and found out a message that tells her about Charles's true identity.
  </p>
  <p key="32144f1f-2adf-4095-a7d4-19a9102b7a8c">
   Link says that he has already found out that Charles is Ganon, but thanks her anyway and goes off to chase after Ganon. He mounts Cloud and follows Charles's tracks to Midoro Swamp. Eventually he bumps into Charles who has a troop of Moblins behind him, all surrounding Link.
  </p>
  <p key="afee0f14-a1a1-493f-892b-03db62bf832b">
   Wondering what everyone will say when he gets back to the palace, he realizes the castle is completely dark. He checks every room but sees that no one answers. Eventually he walks into the banquet hall, where a crowd surprises him and applaud him for saving Hyrule. The king thanks him for defeating Ganon and for bringing back the Triforce of Wisdom safely. Link thanks Impa for her help and Zelda, embarrassed, approaches the young hero and confesses what an "idiot" she was, to which Link replies by saying that maybe she'll now "appreciate the talent here at home." Zelda makes a sarcastic remark, causing for the pair to laugh. The book ends with the king throwing an arm around Link's shoulder and saying that it's time to celebrate.
