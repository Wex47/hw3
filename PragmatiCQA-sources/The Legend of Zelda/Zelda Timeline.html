Link ventured into Hyrule Castle once again, only to see Agahnim send Zelda into the Dark World before his very eyes. Link defeated Agahnim atop Hyrule Castle, but Agahnim used the last of his magic to draw Link into the Dark World as well. This was a twisted dimension that transformed anyone into a reflection of their true selves. Link's dark world form was a pink rabbit.

He climbed Ganon's Tower and met Agahnim at the top. Link defeated Agahnim once more, but then saw Ganon rise out of Agahnim's crumpled body. Agahnim was in fact Ganon's alter ego.

Following Ganon's defeat, he found the Triforce within the Pyramid of Power, whereupon it spoke to him. He touched it, and his wish restored Hyrule to peace. The king and Link's uncle returned to life, and Link entrusted the Triforce to the Royal Family.

   One hundred years later, Princess Zelda's sealing power had weakened, and Calamity Ganon's return as well as Link's awakening were imminent. In response to both, the still possessed Divine Beasts began to wreak havoc around Hyrule. With the healing process complete, Link eventually awakened in the
   Shrine of Resurrection
   without his memories, and ventured foward with the
   Sheikah Slate
   left for him there by Zelda. Outside the Shrine of Resurrection, the spirit of

   explained to Link what happened in the past century. At some point, Link re-obtained the Master Sword from within
   Korok Forest
   ,
   and is ultimately guided by Zelda's voice toward Hyrule Castle. Although he could have chosen to go entirely alone, Link instead takes back the Divine Beasts from Ganon's influence and frees the spirits of the deceased Champions, who also lend him their powers.
   With their help, Link is able to critically injure Calamity Ganon inside Hyrule Castle using the Master Sword, scattering the
   Malice
   covering him. Immediately after, the scattered
   Malice
   gathers outside of the castle and transforms into
   Dark Beast Ganon
   . Zelda, still imprisoned, summons the
   Bow of Light
   , and Link uses it to weaken Ganon enough to allow Zelda to free herself and seal him away.

   After defeating the Calamity, Hyrule begins to slowly flourish again. Princess Zelda focuses on rebuilding the Kingdom, while Link continues to support and protect her.
