    Legends of the Triforce
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="ec259e3f-0d14-456d-b362-27a71db65015">
   The Goddesses ordained the Triforce as Hyrule’s providence, the ‘True Force’ to govern all and the ultimate source of power.
   Of all the powerful mystical forces in the realm of Hyrule, none compare to the Triforce; thus, whoever claims the Triforce gains virtual omnipotence, their power, wisdom or courage dwarfed only by the Goddesses themselves.
   The Triforce ultimately determines Hyrule's destiny, such that if a person with a righteous heart claims the Triforce, Hyrule will enter into a golden age of peace and prosperity. But, if a person with a wicked heart captures the Triforce, the kingdom will inevitably fall into an age of darkness. However, it is prophesied that if
   <a href="Ganon.html" key="42a92ddf-2249-48e0-b5d0-eec065ed2c5a" title="Ganon">
    one with an evil heart
   </a>
   were to claim the Triforce, a

   is destined to stand against him.
  </p>
  <p key="8145e231-1e91-4131-8d41-38913928a1bf">
   The Triforce contains the essence of the Goddesses, but unlike the Goddesses, it does not discriminate between those who are good or evil. It grants the wishes of whoever obtains it, regardless of their motives.
   The stronger the wish, the more the wish comes true since the Triforce will express it more powerfully.
   The resting place of the Triforce, the Sacred Realm, is a mirror that will reflect the heart of the one who enters it and lays claim to the so-called "Sacred Triangle". This being said, one of two things can happen when this event occurs. If the heart of the one that holds the Sacred Triangle in his or her hands is pure and balanced, they will gain the True Force to govern all and the Sacred Realm will become a paradise. However, if the heart of the one that holds the Sacred Triangle does not contain an equal balance of Power, Wisdom and Courage, the Triforce will separate into its three component parts, leaving only the part representing the force that one most believes in and transforming the Sacred Realm into a world of evil as well.
   To gain the full power of the Triforce, the one who touched the Triforce must seek the two lost parts that will be held by two special individuals chosen by destiny, who will bear the mark of the Triforce on the backs of their hands.

   As mentioned in the
   Sheikah legends
   , when someone with an unbalanced heart touches the Triforce, the sacred relic is split up into three pieces: Power, Wisdom and Courage.
   However, as shown in

   . When all three Triforce pieces are in close contact, they will begin to resonate as they attempt to combine into one again.

   It's possible for a Triforce piece to be inactive inside its bearer's body and under certain circumstances to activate. An example of this scenario, is Link's transformation into a

   In that instant, Ganondorf seized his opportunity and attempted to lay claim to the Triforce.
   However, there was another tale told about the Triforce, one that stated that if a person whose Wisdom, Power and Courage were out of balance with each other should lay their hand upon it, the Triforce would shatter into its three separate pieces. The person would keep the piece of Triforce that represents the thing one most believes in, and the other two pieces would seek out a hiding place in the body of those chosen by destiny.

   Unfortunately, destroying this Triforce threw Lorule out of balance, causing the kingdom to begin crumbling. To save her kingdom, Hilda sent Yuga to Hyrule to steal the Triforce, which would thus restore balance to Lorule, though at the same time condemn Hyrule to the same collapse.
