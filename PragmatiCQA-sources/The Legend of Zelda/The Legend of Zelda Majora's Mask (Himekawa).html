   These extra few pages describe the creation of Majora's Mask and the death of Majora. Majora is depicted as a large shaggy dragon wearing armor, magic armor that grants wishes. An unknown warrior appears before Majora one day and Majora is under the impression that the warrior wants his armor, so that he may have his heart's desire. The warrior attempts to convince Majora otherwise but Majora is not willing to believe this. The warrior then reveals a drum and begins to play it, Majora is immediately thrown into a trance and dances for three days straight. Upon the completion of the third day, Majora dies from exhaustion. The warrior then takes the armor, but contrary to what many greedy adventurers would have done, he does not make a wish, and instead, carves the Majora's Mask out of it. This is speculated to be the reason why Majora wishes to end the world in three days and also why his second form, Majora's Incarnation, dances.

    After Link plays the Song of Time and returns to the first day, he notices that he no longer has the wound he had previously received to his arm. This appears to indicate that Link is not physically transported back in time, but instead, only Link's consciousness travels back to enter his body from three days prior. This would explain why Link does not run into the version of himself from the prior loop.
