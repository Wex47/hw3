   versions are. As such, most textures are significantly more detailed, and many models consist of more polygons than the original and are generally more faithful to the game's concept and promotional art. In addition, the frame rate has been increased to 30 FPS, compared to the original's 20 FPS. This reduces choppiness significantly.

   The game includes an all-new system for equipping items. Specifically mentioned at the game's announcement were the
   Iron Boots
   , due to the constant swapping necessary in the
   Water Temple
   . Both the Iron Boots and Hover Boots have been converted into items, as the Iron Boots are in

   . In addition, the three different arrow types are accessed in a "sub-menu" that is brought up when the player selects their bow twice in their inventory, rather than being treated as separate items. The new item system consists of two items that are mapped to the X and Y Buttons, and two touch-screen only slots that are labeled I and II. Any item can be mapped to these, and they can also be cleared. The item screen now allows players to organize their inventory themselves, rather than each item having a set spot on the subscreen. When acquired, items are automatically placed in the next available spot in the 4×5 grid. Selecting an item shows its full "collection" model on the upper screen, as well as a description, the description being a feature that was first implemented in

   Most of the original HUD has been moved down to the touch screen, leaving the upper screen mostly clear of graphic overlays. The only part of the HUD still on the top screen is the A Button prompt, which has been redesigned to look transparent. From this bottom screen the player has quick access to their inventory, equipment, and map. The Ocarina is permanently assigned to the bottom-left. The bottom screen can also be tapped to switch between inventory, equipment, and map, making it much easier and quicker to switch between tunics, swords, and boots.
   The bottom screen has a camera icon that can be tapped to switch to view mode, which can be controlled by using the Circle Pad. The camera can also be controlled by physically moving the 3DS around; for example, if the Nintendo 3DS is held up, Link will look up. The view mode is also used to aim projectile weapons, such as the
   Fairy Slingshot
   and
   Fairy Bow
   . If the L Button is held, it is possible to slightly look around and increase the viewing window by moving the 3DS; this may have been done to accommodate the smaller 3DS screen. Note that this cannot be done when an enemy is being targeted. Any time
   Navi
   wants to give advice, the view icon will be replaced with a Navi icon that can be touched to hear what she has to say, and her name will flash along the bottom of the top screen.

   Deku Nuts
