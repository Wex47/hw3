   is Holodrum, a land wracked by constantly changing seasons. The layout of certain areas of Holodrum can change drastically from season to season, with mounds of snow blocking paths in winter or high waters flooding the way in summer. The nature of these seasons can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on how they affect the Overworld. The Natzu region mysteriously changes according to whose
   Strange Flute
   Link possesses.
Underneath Holodrum is a subterranean, volcanic underworld called

   , is unique because Link can visit in it two different eras in the past and present, which are 400 years apart from each other. Naturally, Labrynna in the past is very different from the land in the present. A village in the past progresses into a city. Some landforms are altered by the elements; Link’s actions can sometimes affect the appearance of these places in both eras. Labrynna, in the past and present, exhibits the Black Tower near the center of its map. The Nuun Highlands change depending on which
   Strange Flute
   Link is given.

The Great Sea is mostly empty, with occasional submarines and towers than can be boarded. The islands themselves are far livelier, with villages on a few of the key islands. Some even have forests or volcanoes.
