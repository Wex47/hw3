   . It appeared in
   Nintendo Power
   beginning in January 1992 and ran for 12 issues, ending in December 1992. It was later published as a graphic novel in 1993. Many portions of the game were omitted, and several new story segments were added to "preserve the elements of surprise and add to the dramatic flow.
   Several new characters are introduced, most prominently
   Roam
   ,
   Epheremelda
   , and the
   librarian
   of Kakariko.

Although Link starts out as a simple, bumbling child, he gradually grows more confident about his abilities and succeeds in rescuing the princess with the help of the friends he makes along his adventure.

   Although often considered to be a manga, the comic was originally published in English in America by Nintendo Power. By modern day standards, it can be considered to be an

In the Japanese edition, the text is oriented horizontally in a left-to-right format as well and the original sound effects are left untranslated.

   When Link tells her that he is looking for the Master Sword, the old woman tells of ancient scrolls that speak of the prosperous people who once inhabited the land of Hyrule. According to the scrolls they made many powerful weapons, including the ultimate treasure, the Master Sword, crafted specifically to resist evil power and which now rests in the

   Just as Sahasrahla hands the Pendant of Courage to Link, the soldiers pursuing Link find him. Empowered by the pendant, he easily dispatches their leader and sends the rest fleeing.

   When Link returns to Kakariko to find clues about the remaining two pendants,

   Link learns that the librarian, who Link must speak to according to Sahasrahla,
   is trapped inside the flames.
   The young hero pours a bucket of water on him and barges in to successfully save the librarian. Inside the House of Books, the librarian theorizes that the soldiers might have been after the
   Book of Mudora
   ,
   and explains that it is the key to the ancient Hylian language which mentions that the hero will stand in the desert holding the book.
   Link takes the Book of Mudora and mentions how Sahasrahla had told him the Pendant of Power was in desert ruins,
   leading the librarian to claim Link as the legendary Hero of Hyrule and calmly leaving the book in the young hero's hands.
   Before Link can head out to the desert, Sahasrahla's wife warns Link that traveling through the desert will not be easy since the "fierce winds and shifting sand" have bested even the most capable adventurers.
   Just then, the young boy who Sahasrahla left in charge of his wife remembers that Sahasrahla showed him a
   bird that Link can ride on
   , which is actually a sort of glider with the shape of wings woven by the Hylian Sages.
   According to the librarian, the wings belonged to the bird who the knights used to take on their campaigns to protect the kingdom and which carried them to battle.

   Link reaches for his mother's hand when she extends hers out to the young hero, but Link's hand turns into a claw when it passes the portal's boundary. Sahasrahla warns that the power of the Dark World turns the inhabitants into a reflection of their heart, and Link's hatred of Agahnim, although justifiable, would turn him into a beast if he were to enter.
   Shortly afterward, Zelda appears to Link and explains that they are in a dream, for if two people dream the same thing, they will meet.
   The princess tells Link to rest and encourages him to not give up while he begins to fall asleep on her lap, complaining about his arm hurting.

   .
   Before leaving, Zora allows Link to take Epheremelda as a guide and grants him the
   Zora's Mask
   to disguise himself and not look so conspicuous as he is sneaking around the palace.

   The duo arrive to the Palace of Darkness and eventually reach the storeroom with the explosives,
   and although Link had been able to sneak around with the Zora's Mask without being noticed,
   he is discovered by a
   Rocklops
   .
   The Rocklops warns Link of what could happen if he set off the firecorns in the palace,
   but the young hero disregards his warning and takes a Hinox's bomb belt that was wrapped around it.
   Link then stumbles into the imprisoned crystal, but is attacked by a
   Gleeok
   that was called upon by the Rocklops. Although he defeats it easily with the Master Sword, soon more Hinoxs riding Gleeoks begin to head towards him.
   Link gives Epheremelda ones of the bombs from the Hinox's belt, which eventually denotes the firecorn stockpile and destroys the entire palace. This allows the maiden to be freed from the crystal, who thanks Link and grants him a relic called the
   Comm-Fork
   .
   Before Link can ask her where Zelda is, the maiden disappears,
   and instead a knight appears in the rubble and demands that the young hero hand over the Master Sword.

   The knight introduces himself as Roam, who challenges Link for the right to wield the Master Sword.
   He transforms into a monstrous eagle and proceeds to attack Link, who counters Roam's attack and defeats him.
   Roam apologizes for having misjudged Link and reveals to him that the ancient Book of Mudora tells that the one who corrupts the Golden Land will be defeated with the
   <a href="Silver Arrow.html" key="6f3a433f-785b-4ac9-b350-a2361583e560" title="Silver Arrow">
    Silver Arrow
   </a>
   , the sacred item that Roam has been seeking.
   He continues to explain that he is a descendant of one of the Knights of Hyrule who was a master archer, and when he discovered that Agahnim was sending the seven maidens to the Dark World, he sought after them through the portal near

   Because he is in the Dark World, he is transformed into an eagle every time he engages in battle.
   Link, overjoyed that Roam is also a descendant of the Knights of Hyrule, begins to think that the two of them can join forces to find Zelda.
   Roam is shocked to hear Zelda has been transported to the Dark World, saying Link is too much of a "weakling" to wield the Master Sword and save the princess.
   The young hero tries to defend himself by saying he has the three Pendants of Virtue to prove his worth,
   but Roam is unimpressed and begins to walk away to continue searching for the Silver Arrow.
   Before disappearing, Roam tells Link that he senses they will have to join forces against Ganon, and advices the young hero to stay alive until then.

   After Roam leaves, the Comfork begins to ring and Link sees an image of Sahasrahla and the rest of his friends back in Kakariko,
   where they are discussing an earthquake that shook the Eastern Palace.
   Although at first Sahasrahla disregards Link's voice as having been his imagination, Sahasrahla and the others eventually communicate with Link and discover that the Comfork allows them to speak with each other even though they are on different planes of existence.
   Link begins to tell his friends about his journey through the Dark World, and Sahasrahla begins to note similarities between the Dark World and Hyrule on his map of the land,
   leading him to discover that the Dark World is a warped reflection of the Light World and that the two are somehow connected.
   He goes on to reveal that the Dark World reflects the inner contents of one's mind, and because the heart of the maiden Link rescued was so pure, she was trapped in a crystal, much like Zelda.
   Knowing this, Epheremelda begins to ask her fairy friends if they've seen the princess,
   and one of them comments on how she overheard a monster talking about a girl imprisoned in a crystal near the
   Swamp Palace
   .

   The duo head out to the palace but discover that the area is completely dried up.
   Link calls to Sahasrahla for help
   and asks him to go to the Light World location of the Swamp Palace, where Sahasrahla and the boy accompanying him find a fountain surrounded by statues.
   The boy, able to see Link in the water of the fountain, warns Link of the monsters behind him,
   where a Hinox and a
   Taros
   shut the door to trap the young hero inside the palace.
   As the boy watches the battle between Link and the foes, he accidentally activates the statues that cause water to pour into the fountain. This leads to the Swamp Palace in the Dark World to get flooded, washing away the monsters and Link.

   The Hinox and Taros end up sinking as they struggle with each other,
   while Link's Master Sword is dragging him below the surface.
   Epheremelda tells Link to stay afloat, for the water is almost up to an opening that the fairy had found earlier on.
   The young hero is then rushed into a new chamber, where he finds the second maiden imprisoned in her crystal. As Link makes his way to the maiden, a large, tentacled monster attacks him. He thrusts himself with the Master Sword into the monster and defeats the creature, which spits out Link from inside and gives him a chance to destroy the floating crystal where the maiden is. The maiden, now freed, thanks Link and tells him that Zelda is imprisoned in
   Turtle Rock
   found at the end of the world, then vanishes.
   Epheremelda tells Link of a map of the Dark World that is located in the
   Ice Tower
   ,
   when suddenly Link hears Zelda contact him telepathically from beyond the
   Swamp of Evil
   .
   Epheremelda, who cannot hear Zelda's calling, advises Link against going to the wasteland since it is too dangerous, and once they get in there, there will be no way to escape.
   She recommends that they go find the map first,
   but Link disregards her suggestion, for he claims that if the wasteland is as dangerous as she says, then he has to rescue Zelda as soon as possible.
   This angers Epheremelda, who claims that Link never worries about her and that all he ever talks about is Zelda, leading the fairy to indignantly leave Link's side.

   Now on his own, Link heads into the wasteland and stumbles into an oasis from where Zelda is calling his name. The young hero ventures in and finds her,
   but as he remembers the maiden's words of Zelda being inside a turtle rock,
   the princess turns out to be an illusion made by a
   Wizzrobe
   , who promptly captures Link and conjures
   Vitreous
   from the swamp to devour him.
   Just then, a whirlpool is created that engulfs both Vitreous and the Wizzrobe, and from beneath Zora appears to rescue Link. When the young hero asks Zora how he arrived and who told him where he was,
   Zora explains that Epheremelda had requested that he go rescue Link and that he is able to warp between worlds due to the presence of water.

   Reunited with Epheremelda, Link travels to the Ice Tower, where they are confronted by
   Kholdstone
   . Link reveals that all he wants is to see the map of the Dark World,
   but Kholdstone mentions that the map is his greatest treasure and will not let anyone see it.
   The monster unleashes two Stalfos to attack Link, but when the young hero sees that they keep respawning even after defeating them, he begins to focus his power on the Master Sword,
   which causes for the tower to begin to collapse. Kholdstone warns Link that if he destroys the tower, then he will destroy the map as well, making him realize that the map is etched on the tower's floor.
   Before the tower collapses, Link learns the location of Turtle Rock and heads there along with Epheremelda, where they begin to look for the dungeon's entrance.
   Remembering the words Link heard in the Ice Tower,

   Zelda tells Link the book has a power which is beyond their comprehension,
   and Link remembers that Sahasrahla said only a man who has overcome his own negative thoughts and emotions can become the true hero. Since Roam has not, Link fears that this might actually be his downfall even if he finds the Silver Arrow.

She begins to comment on how although the bond between them was so strong when she was in Ganon's clutches, now that they are both free and at peace, their duties now keep them apart, leaving the queen to feel alone.
   As Zelda begins to gallop away on her horse, she confesses to Link that as long as she lives, she will never forget the time when they were together in their dreams.
