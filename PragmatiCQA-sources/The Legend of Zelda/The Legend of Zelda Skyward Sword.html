   With all of the participants ready, the Wing Ceremony begins. Despite Groose and his lackeys' efforts to prevent him from winning,
   Link succeeds in plucking the

   Sailcloth
   .
   To conclude the ceremony, Link must jump off the statue and land safely using the Sailcloth.
   Zelda pushes him off instead, and Link is successful. Zelda praises Link and proposes that the two fly around the clouds together in celebration.
   However, as they are flying, a mysterious black tornado suddenly appears and plucks Zelda off of her Loftwing, causing her to fall beneath the
   Cloud Barrier
   . Link tries to rescue her, but is knocked out by the tornado himself in the process.

   Link's Loftwing takes him back to Skyloft. That night, Link has a dream depicting Zelda free falling into the mouth of the

   from his dream at the beginning at the game. After waking up in his bed, he explains the events that transpired to Zelda's father,
   Headmaster Gaepora

   She tells Link that he must take the

   he sees in front of him and embark on his destined journey as the chosen hero of the Goddess.
   Although he is apprehensive at first, Fi tells him that Zelda is still alive,
   and Link draws the blade. The two are joined moments after by Gaepora, who explains his hidden knowledge of a prophecy that foretold what is taking place before him.
   He tells Link that in order to reach the Surface and rescue Zelda, he must pierce the Cloud Barrier, something nobody has ever done before.
   Fi remedies the situation by bestowing Link with the
   Emerald Tablet
   ,
   which opens a portal through the clouds to the world below.

   The next day, after receiving his green knight's uniform as the only graduating member of his class,
   Link makes preparations and heads to the Surface to find Zelda. As he descends, he arrives at the
   Sealed Grounds
   , where he sees a dark aura emanating from a
   Sealing Spike
   in the center of a large pit. Upon witnessing this, Link has yet another vision of the

   . He descends and approaches the Spike, and hears a voice telling him to strike it with a
   Skyward Strike

   Sealed Temple
   . Inside, a

    Skyview Temple

   Skyview Spring

    Ghirahim

   , and explains to Link that he is responsible for the tornado that brought Zelda to the Surface.
   Ghirahim tells Link that he and his forces nearly captured Zelda before a
   Servant of the Goddess
   helped her escape,
   and states that Zelda now lies beyond the door.
   He prepares to fight Link, threatening to beat him within an inch of his life.
   After Link defeats him, he realizes that Zelda's presence is no longer in the area and leaves,
   threatening to kill Link if he interferes with him again.
   The young hero enters the Skyview Spring, and Fi translates words that the Goddess left for him,
   indicating that Zelda must purify her body at two different springs.
  </p>
  <p key="ce52ee64-763f-4046-9464-12c283fa7ee0">
   Link receives the
   Ruby Tablet
   and returns to Skyloft to place it alongside the Emerald Tablet inside the Goddess Statue. With a new portal to the Surface accessible, the young hero travels to
   Eldin Volcano
   , where he continues his journey to find Zelda. After making his way through the
   Earth Temple
   , Ghirahim appears to Link and tells him that once again,

   took Zelda from him.
   He sics
   Scaldera
   on Link and leaves them to battle each other while he tries to reclaim Zelda.
   Link triumphs against the monster and proceeds to the
   second spring
   . There, Zelda is seen with a young woman in front of a golden portal. The woman prevents her and Link from reuniting,
   and Zelda sadly tells Link that she has to leave and apologizes to him before entering the portal.
   Link tries to follow her, but the woman stops him. She chastises Link for his failure to arrive in a timely fashion,
   and follows Zelda through the portal, which disappears in a flash of light. Link is left hurt and frustrated, and Fi translates another message from the Goddess intended for him, revealing that Zelda is headed to
   Lanayru Desert
   .

   Link receives another tablet known as the
   Amber Tablet

   . Just before Link can rejoin Zelda, Ghirahim breaks through the rubble blocking the entrance to the Temple of Time and casts a barrier in front of Link, preventing him from reaching Zelda. Ghirahim proceeds to engage in battle with Zelda's escort. In the midst of the frenetic action, Zelda gives Link the

   As Ghirahim's magic barrier dissipates, Link intervenes in the battle, allowing Zelda and her companion to escape Ghirahim by entering the Gate of Time. On their way through, Zelda's companion destroys the gate to prevent Ghirahim from following them. After vowing to kill Link the next time they meet,
   Ghirahim leaves the scene. Link decides to return to the Sealed Grounds to learn how to use the Goddess's Harp.

   As Link descends to the Sealed Grounds, Groose intercepts him in midair and both fall to the Surface. As Groose is shocked with what he sees around him,
   Link explains the situation, calming the former. Groose's old attitude quickly returns and he tells Link to head back to Skyloft, hoping to find and rescue Zelda himself.
   However, the old woman at the Sealed Temple tells Groose that he will not be the one to save Zelda,
   and he leaves the Sealed Temple in anger. The old woman reveals that Zelda's bodyguard's name is

   before allowing Link to learn the "
   Ballad of the Goddess
   ".
   As he plays it on the sacred harp, a large structure appears behind him and is revealed to be a second Gate of Time.
   However, outside the Sealed Temple, a beast known as

    The Imprisoned
   </a>
   (the same monstrosity from Link's visions and dreams) responds to the appearance of the Gate and breaks free of its seal.
   Although it is too powerful for Link to destroy, he succeeds in sealing The Imprisoned back into its pit. Groose is left with a feeling of uselessness and laments that he is unable to save Zelda,
   while the old woman tells Link that he cannot activate the second Gate of Time until his sword is much more powerful.

   Link returns to Skyloft to find clues to the whereabouts of the three flames. Following clues in the lyrics of the "Ballad of the Goddess",
   Link rotates the two windmills in Skyloft to make them face each other. This unearths the
   Light Tower
   , and Link performs the "Ballad of the Goddess" on the Goddess's Harp by the shrine at the top of the structure. In response, the Light Tower fires a beam into a large
   Thunderhead
   in the distance. Link is able to fly into the Thunderhead, where he finds the
   Isle of Songs
   . Inside, he learns a song known as "
   Farore's Courage

   Spirit Vessel
   with the
   Tears of Farore
   , Link receives the
   Water Dragon's Scale
   , allowing him to swim underwater and perform a spin maneuver. He uses this new ability to head to
   Lake Floria
   , where he hopes to find the first Sacred Flame. He encounters
   Faron
   , the Water Dragon presiding over Faron Woods, and discovers that she was gravely wounded from an attack by Ghirahim and his forces and is recuperating in a basin of water as a result.
   She tells Link to bring her
   Sacred Water
   to heal her wounds, promising to reveal the path to
   Farore's Flame
   in return.
   Link returns to Skyview Spring, collects the Sacred Water, and heals the Water Dragon with it. Faron reveals that Farore's Flame lies within the
   Ancient Cistern
   ,
   and tells Link that they will meet again.
   After conquering the challenges in the Ancient Cistern, the Goddess Sword is purified with Farore's Flame and is transformed into the
   Goddess Longsword
   .

   With the first flame obtained, Link returns to the Isle of Songs and learns the song known as "
   Nayru's Wisdom

   Lanayru Desert
   and completes another Silent Realm challenge there, giving him the
   Clawshots
   , which he uses to access the
   Lanayru Sand Sea
   . There, he meets
   Skipper

   Fireshield Earrings
   . Using the protective jewelry, Link heads to the
   Volcano Summit
   , where he finds the
   Fire Sanctuary
   . However, after traversing the Sanctuary, Ghirahim appears to Link once again and tells him that he has found out about the existence of a second Gate of Time.
   He asks Link to reveal its location,
   but he refuses. Although Ghirahim partially transforms his body to become more powerful, Link succeeds in besting him, incurring his wrath.
   Ghirahim leaves once more and Link obtains the final Sacred Flame.

   With this in mind, she devised a plan to destroy the Demon King once and for all. Hylia knew that the sacred power, known as the

    chosen hero

   who would inevitably fulfill the Goddess's wishes on his quest,
   and decided to transfer her soul to the body of a mortal: Zelda.
   The Goddess knew that Link would charge headfirst into peril without hesitation if it meant saving Zelda, and Zelda apologizes to Link for using him (as Hylia) to bring about the ultimate destruction of Demise.
   She also reveals that The Imprisoned is Demise's weakened form,
   and thanks Link for repeatedly confining it in the Sealed Grounds.
   She blesses the Master Sword with the power of the Goddess,
   causing it to take on its true form, the True Master Sword. Zelda tells Link that as the reincarnation of Hylia, she must remain in a deep sleep for thousands of years to keep Demise imprisoned within his seal.
   She seals herself into a crystal and tells Link that he must find and use the Triforce to destroy Demise so that she will be able to wake up in their own time.
   After an emotional goodbye, Link returns to the present and sets out to find clues to the location of the Triforce.

   Link returns to Skyloft where the Triforce is supposedly hidden, and asks Gaepora what he knows about it. However, the Headmaster has little knowledge of the Triforce,
   and can only tell Link of the Great Sky Spirit
   Levias
   ,
   who lives in the Thunderhead and whose knowledge is said to be encyclopedic.
   However, Instructor
   Owlan
   informs Link that Levias has been acting strange lately and suggests that he is possessed by
   something

   Owlan teaches Link and his Loftwing the
   Spiral Charge

   owner of the
   Lumpy Pumpkin
   ,
   a small diner popular among the knights of Skyloft. The owner makes an offering of his pumpkin soup to Levias on a yearly basis.
   Link offers to take the soup to Levias in his stead, and brings it inside the Thunderhead, drawing out the sky spirit with it. However, Levias is indeed possessed by a creature known as
   Bilocyte
   , and Link is forced to battle and destroy it to rescue the sky spirit. After returning to his senses, Levias tells Link to seek out the three dragons on the Surface who know of three separate parts to a song known as the "
   Song of the Hero

   When Link descends to Faron Woods, an anomaly prevents him from going anywhere but the Sealed Grounds.
   Upon arrival, Link teams up with Groose to seal The Imprisoned for a third time. The old woman explains that Link cannot enter Faron Woods because it is currently flooded and, to keep the Sealed Grounds safe from this flood, she placed a seal on the gate to the woods that will only hold as long as the gate is not opened.
   Groose decides to use his machine to fling Link into the woods.
   Link lands in the flooded woods and investigates the inside of the
   Great Tree
   , where the water supposedly emerged from. Link meets Faron again inside of the tree, where she informs him that she flooded the woods in order to get rid of the monsters in the area.
   She offers him the challenge of collecting the notes to her part of the "Song of the Hero" in the form of
   Tadtones

   Link completes the challenge and is given the Water Dragon's part of the song before she decides to cause the flooding to recede, returning Faron Woods to its original state.

Activating the Timeshift Stone, Link is able to proceed around and through the caves to reach the Thunder Dragon, shifting time backwards to a point when the Thunder Dragon was still alive. He is shown to have been deathly ill,

   A sapling has been planted in the present desert era, but it is unable to flourish in the Lanayru Province's climate.
   Using Timeshift Stones, Link digs up the sapling and brings it back through the Gate of Time to the Temple of Hylia, where he plants it, allowing it to grow into a tree that bears the life-saving fruit in the present day's Sealed Temple. Taking the fruit, Link brings it to the Thunder Dragon and saves his life. The Thunder Dragon recovers and teaches Link his part of the "Song of the Hero".

   With the three parts of the "Song of the Hero", Link returns to Levias, who combines the three dragons' parts with his own to teach Link the full song.
   With the full song in hand, Link returns to Skyloft and uses the song to open the Trial Gate to the final Silent Realm. On the other side, Link completes a trial in Skyloft and receives a
   Stone of Trials
   that will lead to the Triforce. There is a second Stone of Trials somewhere in Skyloft, and bringing the two together will reveal the path to the Triforce.

   However, just as the group believes that Link's long journey is finally over, Ghirahim ambushes them.
   He abducts Zelda and enters the Gate of Time, intending to use her to resurrect Demise in the distant past.
   Regaining his strength from Ghirahim's initial ambush, Link pursues him to the past, finding Impa on the ground as he emerges from the Gate of Time. Impa reveals that Ghirahim ambushed her and passed through the large doors at the front of the Temple with Zelda.
   She assures Link that she will be fine and urges him to pursue Ghirahim.
   Link heads out to the Sealed Grounds, where Ghirahim is beginning the ritual to revive Demise, who is still sealed in the past, by having him absorb Zelda's soul, as she is the reincarnation of Hylia. He has his troops assail Link in
   absurd numbers

   He raises Link and himself on a high platform, where he announces his intention to kill Link in an ironic way - by driving the boy from the sky to the edge and throwing him off.
   However, Link does exactly that, driving Ghirahim to the edge of the platform and knocking him off before plunging his Sword into the Demon Lord's chest to damage him. Ghirahim's rage peaks as he summons blades with which to battle.
   Link continues to strike the gemstone in the center of Ghirahim's chest, eventually defeating him once and for all. However, Ghirahim reveals that the ritual he started continued while they battled.

   Ghirahim welcomes back his master before the latter silently raises his hand,
   using his power to draw his blade (a dark, corrupted version of the Master Sword) out from within Ghirahim. Ghirahim's lifeless form is drawn into the blade, and Demise expresses his fascination with Link's courage.
   He then causes Zelda to fall from the air, but before her body can hit the ground, Groose arrives from nowhere and catches her.
   He tells Link that it will take some time for Demise to fully absorb Zelda's soul, giving Link a chance to save her by destroying him.
   Seeing Link defy his expectation of humankind by standing against him, Demise decides to give Link the chance to duel him in another realm for the fate of the world, creating a dark portal that he enters.
   Link follows him through the portal and finds the Demon King against a backdrop of the sky. Demise speaks with Link before their battle begins, telling him of his intention to destroy him and take the Triforce to rule the world for eternity.
   Link manages to outdo Demise at swordplay, causing the latter to summon a thunderstorm and power his blade with lightning. However, Link does the same with the Master Sword and uses electrified Skyward Strikes to match Demise's power. Finally, Demise is knocked down on his back, and Link leaps into the air, plunging the Master Sword through the Demon King's chest. Demise stumbles to his feet and commends Link,

   Just before she enters "a sleep without end," Fi tells Link that while she is unable to feel true emotion, she feels something best equated to happiness due to her time spent with Link.

   Impa promises Zelda that even though she will destroy the Gate of Time, they will meet again.
   Zelda gives Impa one of the bracelets that she had been wearing throughout most of the game before she, Link and Groose return to their own time. On the other side of the gate, they see the old woman as she destroys the gate from that end. She repeats her promise of seeing Zelda once again before showing her the bracelet that Zelda had just given to Impa in the past,
   revealing that the old woman was an elderly Impa all along. As the group realizes this, Impa vanishes in particles of light, her duty to the Goddess finally fulfilled.

Miyamoto discussed that the use of the sword and shield would incorporate the motion capabilities of the Wii MotionPlus and use of the Nunchuk accessory. The sword could also be charged up by holding the Wii Remote straight up in the air, and, once it's charged up, the Remote must be swung downwards to release the beam as a projectile attack.

   for the magazine's highest-ever review score. However, Gamespot rated it lower than previous games in the series, giving it a score of 7.5 out of 10. Fans have praised the new combat system, but complained about free-roaming in the sky, saying it lacked more interesting places to explore.
   In addition, the game has been criticized for being too linear.
