   The hero was able to defeat Vaati, seal him within the blade of the Sword, and rescue the maidens. Nobody seemed to know how this young man succeeded where countless others had failed, but the maidens spoke of how his Sword caused him to split into four copies of himself and how the four who were one worked together to subdue the Wind Sorcerer. Following these events, the blade was left enshrined deep within the forests of Hyrule, in the Four Sword Sanctuary where it served as Vaati's prison.

   but not before carrying Princess Zelda off to his palace above the clouds and making her his bride.
   The Wind Mage knocks Link out and carries the princess away, and shortly thereafter three fairies descend upon the scene as Link comes to, revealing to him what has become of the princess and explaining the power of the Four Sword to him. Seeing that he will have need of its power, Link draws the blade from its pedestal and is shattered into four colorful copies of himself. The four Links then use the Four Sword, now also shattered into four versions of itself (each having a different colored jewel to match the Link that wields it), to work their way across Hyrule to acquire the Keys necessary to open the way to Vaati's Palace. The heroes, after much toil, succeed in this endeavor and reach the palace, where they battle Vaati and, with the Sword's power, succeed in defeating him, resealing him within its blade. They free Princess Zelda from her captivity and return the blade to its resting place in the Four Sword Sanctuary, once again holding Vaati at bay.

   The Sword still seals away the Wind Sorcerer Vaati after he was re-sealed within it by Link and Princess Zelda.
   With the passing of time, the people have come to feel a sense of peace and security. However, dark storm clouds soon blacken the skies of Hyrule and fill all who see them with fear and dread.
   This has caused some to fear that the seal of the Four Sword binding Vaati may once again be weakening.
   The specter of Vaati's return causes such disturbance that Princess Zelda sees fit to convene a meeting of the six other

    Shadow Link

   Seeing he has no weapon to duel his dark doppelganger, Link draws the Four Sword from its pedestal, causing himself to split apart in the same manner the Sword had worked previously, causing him to split into four different colored versions of himself.
   Shadow Link laughs and makes a quick exit as Vaati escapes his prison once again and sends the four Links far away with a whirlwind. Upon awakening, the four meet
   Kaepora Gaebora
   , who tells them that they must master the power of the Four Sword in order to defeat Vaati and rescue Zelda and the Shrine Maidens.
   To do this, they must gather a total of 2,000

   Power to Repel Evil
   .
   In this manner, the four heroes work their way across Hyrule and gradually rescue all of the maidens with the power of the Four Sword.
   They eventually reach the
   Palace of Winds
   and confront Vaati, ultimately destroying him for good using the blade's power.
   However, it turns out that the true evil behind Vaati's release and the evil plaguing Hyrule is

   The Sword is returned to the Four Sword Sanctuary soon after, now serving as the prison of Ganon.

  <p key="787380b7-f8be-4e7b-b324-1c5cb65c5d33">
   The Four Sword is a double-edged blade with a spear-point at its tip and a fuller hilt, which has usually been depicted as being gold in color. The hilt is engraved with an eye-like symbol, likely a reference to its history with
   Vaati
   the Wind Mage. On the pommel of the Sword's hilt near the top, the Sword is typically depicted as having a round jewel whose color usually reflects its wielder. For example, the part of the Four Sword wielded by the green Link will have a green jewel whereas the red Link's Sword will have a red jewel. In Link's case, the Sword will have a green, red, blue and purple jewel in each of its clones for each copy of Link. When the Sword is not in use however, it appears that the jewel has a dull greenish color likely to reflect its dormancy.
  </p>
  <p key="9a2553a4-680a-4016-a6d7-c2bc95cbddc8">
   The Sword is shown to not have always been of this design however. For instance, when it was known as the Picori Blade, it more closely resembled the Master Sword with its purplish-colored hilt. After it is shattered by Vaati and re-forged into the White Sword by Melari however, it begins to more resemble the shape of the Sword it would become, albeit with a green-colored hilt.
   It was not until the power of the Four Elements were infused into the Sword that it finally transformed into its present incarnation, with its hilt changing first from red to blue and finally to the gold color that is seen in the chronologically later games.
   The Four Elements, which would chronologically later become known as the four "Royal Jewels," also typically are kept near the Four Sword's resting place on a special pedestal.

  <p key="98e8d81b-5b5c-4569-9434-84c771f98985">
   Like the Master Sword, the Four Sword is blessed with many magical capabilities that have been infused into its enchanted blade. Some of these capabilities have been present in each game the Sword is featured in while others have been specific to a particular game. In total, there have been three major abilities the Sword has shown itself capable of performing, though as stated earlier not all of these have appeared in every game the Sword is featured in. Also, some of these abilities that are shown in more than one game are shown to slightly differ from game to game. Overall, the Sword has shown itself capable of repelling and sealing evil entities away, creating three separate clones of the blade's wielder, and also breaking powerful curses.
  </p>
  <p key="d93e2b06-de94-460c-8b84-c6a33b63aa11">
   When the Sword is drawn from its pedestal, it will cause its wielder to split apart into four separate versions of themselves, each nearly identical to the original. The sole differences between the different clones is the tones of their voices (some are deeper than others) and the color of their clothing (in Link's case, his different clones along with himself are colored the four aforementioned colors). The non-canonical manga has depicted the Four Sword as causing the different colored clones to represent different sides of one's psyche as well. The four can work together as a team or they can work independently should the need arise as well.
  </p>
  <p key="444cd3aa-f619-45fc-aa64-7164eb521e10">
   When the four Links choose to fight in formation, they can do so in four different ways: horizontal line, vertical line, box and diamond. The horizontal line is just as it implies, with the four Links lining up in a vertical line and attacking in unison. The same principle applies for the vertical line with the exception of the four Links standing vertically instead. The box formation has the four Links stand together in a square shape and attack as though in a box. Finally, the diamond formation has the four Links assemble themselves in a diamond shape and attack from all sides simultaneously.
  </p>
  <p key="4741b2d6-122a-4a6d-b3be-c2e7d64635b2">
   The Sword's ability to create clones has varied from game to game. For instance, while in

    Four Swords
   </i>
   and

   </i>
   the Sword keeps the clones around indefinitely and in varying colors, this principle is different in
   <i key="deea6877-2194-49e7-a6df-7bbf5756a2e4">
    The Minish Cap
   </i>
   , where Link must power up the Four Sword and stand on special tiles to create the clones, who all look alike and only manifest themselves for a limited time before vanishing. The reason for this difference is not made clear, though it's likely just an aesthetic change for gameplay's sake. In this same game, the Four Sword also shows the ability to, when charged up, cast a magical beam of energy that can break curses, such as the curse Vaati placed upon Princess Zelda.
  </p>
  <p key="ba718514-efe5-486b-835a-e64a8e10cde6">
   When Link's health is full in most games featuring the Four Sword, the Sword will emit an energy beam. However, in
   <i key="e9963f61-6695-4fd8-ac88-af1bff0416cd">
    Four Swords Adventures

   , the Sword's power is based upon

   , 2000 of which Link must recover in each area in order to restore the power to repel evil to the Sword's blade. Only when this is accomplished can Link destroy the Barriers in each area made with Vaati's magic and proceed to the next area. If not enough Force Gems have been found by the end of the area, the Sword will take Link back in time to redo the level and find enough of them. In
