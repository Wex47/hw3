   In Gamelon, Zelda does battle with many creatures working for Ganon, and meets many friendly characters and obtains a variety of useful items along the way. On her adventure, she confronts and defeats several of Ganon's minions:
   Gibdo

   Iron Knuckle
   , the
   Three Witches
   ,
   Wizzrobe
   ,
   Hektan
   , and
   Omfak
   . Between her battles, Zelda and Impa learn from the Triforce of Wisdom that several of Gamelon's citizens have been captured by Ganon's minions and gone missing,
   and eventually learn that the same fate had befallen her father as well who was captured by Ganon himself. Although Link's fate remains unknown, Zelda meets
   Lady Alma
   after saving her from Wizzrobe, and learns that she had once met with Link. Eventually, Zelda reaches Duke Onkled's castle,
   Dodomai Palace
   , where she frees
   Lord Kiro
   and learns that Duke Onkled is actually working with Ganon and had betrayed the King. She confronts Onkled and forces him to give her the key to
   Reesong Palace
   , where Ganon is hiding. Zelda then later learns from
   Myra
   , a woman encountered earlier in
   Hanyu Forest
   , that only the
   Wand of Gamelon
   can defeat Ganon, which she finds in the
   Shrine of Gamelon
   after defeating its keeper Omfak.

   At Reesong Palace, Zelda uses the wand to imprison Ganon inside a book with chains, and rescues her father. Duke Onkled is arrested and turned over to the King, and begs for mercy. He is made to "scrub all the floors in

   " as his punishment. Zelda wonders where Link had went to, but Lady Alma, present at the King's liberation, calls him a bore. Zelda then takes her mirror and throws it away, which breaks and inexplicably releases Link, implying that he was trapped inside it. He seems to have no recollection of what happened. The group then celebrates by having a feast.

   . Stages are accessed from a world map which are selected with a cursor, with more areas becoming available as Zelda progresses through the game. Stages consist of several sectioned areas within them, usually with multiple enemies in each section. If Zelda loses all of her
   Life Hearts
   and perishes, a Continue screen with a counter will be displayed, allowing Zelda to restart at the entrance of the area she was last in. If Zelda however dies three times, she will be sent back to the world map and be forced to start over. Each stage has two
   Triforce Maps
   that serve as exits; one at the beginning and one at the end. In addition to simply reaching the second Triforce Map in each stage, some stages also have special items and power-ups in them that are necessary to progress through later areas. Zelda encounters several NPC characters in certain stages who provide Zelda with essential equipment and information, often requiring a specific item in return found somewhere else in the game.

   cutscenes, which are activated when Zelda approaches a character and touches them with her sword. The game explains this by referring to Zelda's sword as the "Smart Sword"; a sword Zelda uses that cannot hurt friendly characters and instead encourages them to talk.
   The cutscenes use voice acting to provide Zelda with instructions and story. Very little in-game text is encountered otherwise.

After an attempt to produce to CD-ROM based add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with Philips failed, Nintendo reached a compromise and gave Philips the license to five of their franchises' characters for use in the Philips CD-i.

   were developed by Animation Magic, then known as Dale Disharoon, Inc. early in development. The developers settled on making two separate games featuring Link and Zelda. Due to the small development budget and time restraints, the developers resolved to combine the funding to produce a single game engine that would be used by both games.
   The development team consisted of four programmers, one audio engineer and composer, four artists, a producer, and a freelance writer who would help to design both games. As Philips were expecting full-motion video animation in the games, the games' cutscenes were outsourced to a new animation company in St. Petersburg, Russia, founded by games' creator Dale DeSharone and Igor Razboff. Animators were flown over to work on the game cutscenes.
   The two companies would eventually combine and become known as Animation Magic.

   Very little input was given by Nintendo during the development of the games, who were mostly concerned with the designs and sketches of Link and Zelda.
   Philips also gave very little input, but Dale DeSharone expressed in an interview that he believed Philips would not have approved of a top-down view for the games, as it would have "looked old, and (would not) make use of the CD-i capabilities."
   The lack of input from both companies allowed the developers room for creative development.
