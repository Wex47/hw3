    Legends of the Triforce
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="b5cdb97c-c897-4f4a-8b22-6bed1bd51cf4">
   The Goddesses ordained the Triforce as Hyrule’s providence, the ‘True Force’ to govern all and the ultimate source of power.
   Of all the powerful mystical forces in the realm of Hyrule, none compare to the Triforce; thus, whoever claims the Triforce gains virtual omnipotence, their power, wisdom or courage dwarfed only by the Goddesses themselves.
   The Triforce ultimately determines Hyrule's destiny, such that if a person with a righteous heart claims the Triforce, Hyrule will enter into a golden age of peace and prosperity. But, if a person with a wicked heart captures the Triforce, the kingdom will inevitably fall into an age of darkness. However, it is prophesied that if
   <a href="Ganon.html" key="5271039e-1192-45f2-b447-96744188e18c" title="Ganon">
    one with an evil heart
   </a>
   were to claim the Triforce, a
   <a href="Link.html" key="79bc47b2-9b49-44c4-bcf4-d580f2c27321" title="Link">

   is destined to stand against him.
  </p>
  <p key="2870191d-f977-4e9b-9a1e-05819d39d797">
   The Triforce contains the essence of the Goddesses, but unlike the Goddesses, it does not discriminate between those who are good or evil. It grants the wishes of whoever obtains it, regardless of their motives.
   The stronger the wish, the more the wish comes true since the Triforce will express it more powerfully.
   The resting place of the Triforce, the Sacred Realm, is a mirror that will reflect the heart of the one who enters it and lays claim to the so-called "Sacred Triangle". This being said, one of two things can happen when this event occurs. If the heart of the one that holds the Sacred Triangle in his or her hands is pure and balanced, they will gain the True Force to govern all and the Sacred Realm will become a paradise. However, if the heart of the one that holds the Sacred Triangle does not contain an equal balance of Power, Wisdom and Courage, the Triforce will separate into its three component parts, leaving only the part representing the force that one most believes in and transforming the Sacred Realm into a world of evil as well.
   To gain the full power of the Triforce, the one who touched the Triforce must seek the two lost parts that will be held by two special individuals chosen by destiny, who will bear the mark of the Triforce on the backs of their hands.

   As mentioned in the

   . When all three Triforce pieces are in close contact, they will begin to resonate as they attempt to combine into one again.

   However,
   Demise
   , wanting to make the world his own, gathered an army of monsters and together launched an attack against the people of the surface, murdering them and causing misfortunes all just to get their hands on the power guarded by Hylia.
   To prevent the great power from falling into the hands of the demonic creatures - and specifically their leader, Demise - Her Grace gathered the surviving humans on a piece of land and sent it to the heavens, beyond the clouds and out of reach from the evil plaguing the land.

   Inside this keep were three separate gates which led to another realm, each gate leading to a different piece of the Triforce. Before departing, Hylia also entrusted the guardians of the surface as well as

   Statue of the Goddess
   and makes his wish: the destruction of Demise. The Triforce's power causes the entire island containing the Goddess Statue to break free from Skyloft and plummet down to the surface, thus returning to its original location at the Sealed Grounds and destroying the Imprisoned just as it attempts to break out once more with the Sky Keep itself.
   However, subsequent events made it necessary to travel back to the past and defeat Demise there as well. When this is accomplished,
   Impa
   reminds Zelda that she must stay in the past to watch over the Triforce since its might is too powerful to leave in "the grasp of man". She also mentions that once the Triforce has served its purpose, it will be secreted away once again, its existence kept hidden from everyone.
   Zelda assents and returns to her own time with Link and resolves to stay below the clouds to continue guarding the Triforce.

Although it is well known that it is not an item that can be received in the game, many stories and rumors from fans claiming they have obtained the Triforce by doctored photos and such have come up. These rumors were mostly due to an engraving of the Triforce on the Quest Status menu, centered between all of the
   Medallions
   , although it is only there for decoration purposes.

   reveals that, at one time,
   Lorule
   had its own parallel counterpart of the Triforce, which bears the same name and visually resembles an inverted version of Hyrule's. As was the case in Hyrule, wars were fought over this Triforce, prompting Hilda's ancestors to destroy it to end the bloodshed.
   Unfortunately, destroying this Triforce threw Lorule out of balance, causing the kingdom to begin crumbling. To save her kingdom, Hilda sent Yuga to Hyrule to steal the Triforce, which would thus restore balance to Lorule, though at the same time condemn Hyrule to the same collapse.
   Hilda then takes the Triforce of Wisdom for herself, ordering Yuga to attack Link to obtain the final Triforce. Link succeeds in defeating Yuga, however, prompting an angered Hilda to demand Yuga's Triforce of Power; however, he instead reveals that he never cared for Lorule's fate, merely desiring the Triforce for himself.
   He then turns Hilda into a painting and merges with her, thus gaining her Triforce of Wisdom. However, with help from Princess Zelda, Link manages to defeat Yuga, freeing both Zelda and Hilda. After
   Ravio
   manages to persuade Hilda of the evil nature of her actions, Hilda agrees to send Link and Zelda back to Hyrule, though seemingly dooming her kingdom in the process. Once back in Hyrule, however, Link and Zelda wish together on Hyrule's Triforce to restore its Lorulean counterpart. As it reappears, Lorule's skies begin to lighten as Hilda expresses tearful gratitude, seemingly indicating that Lorule is once more in balance.

   Prior to the events of the game, Ganon attacked the kingdom of Hyrule and stole the Triforce of Power.
   Fearing Ganon's wicked rule, the Princess Zelda split the Triforce of Wisdom into eight shards and hid them in the dungeons beneath Hyrule.

   Guarded by a wizened sage, the Triforce could only be recovered by a hero capable of defeating not only the soldiers and monsters set to guard the Great Palace, but also his very shadow. Link overcame these obstacles to achieve the third Triforce, and used the power of the united relic to wake the slumbering Princess Zelda.
