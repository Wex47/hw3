   to avoid them. Ricky distracts Medelock by punching a rock into its face, and Link uses the opening to slice Medelock in half. Soon afterwards, the Season Spirits thank Link for ridding them of the curse, and give him the Rod of Seasons. Maple decides to go with them, so she can steal the rod by gaining their trust. The four heroes then continue their quest to Onox's Castle.

   Atop Onox's Castle, the general taunts Din about Holodrum's transformation into a desolate wasteland. As she replies, Link learns about his new weapon- the ancient Rod of Seasons. Maple unsuccessfully tries to take it from the hero, but, as they bicker, they advance upon Onox's stronghold, traversing land soaked in darkness. They adventure up the mountaintop, and the green-clad hero wonders about their vulnerabilities. Continuing farther up, an old, frail woman begs the travelers for help. Revealing his weakness of kindness, Link helps her up, but not before pondering how she reached the rocky peak. Her weight drags him down and the three heroes crash into the dangerous depths below them, only to be swarmed by monsters. The lady reveals herself as the all-powerful

   Ricky bravely takes on the demons with immense power, although Maple frets he's not good enough, grabs the Rod of Seasons and flees in the confusion. True to her word, the kangaroo is knocked out to Link's distress. As he tries to revive his fallen friend, a sleepy baby-blue bear rises out of the barren ground to the heroes' surprise. Ricky recognizes it as Moosh, an old friend of his. As they attempt to convince the bear to help them and fly up the jagged peak, Moosh's flaw is revealed: he realizes everything extremely slow. After recovering from the shock of noticing the monsters, he agrees and lifts the travelers to Onox's Castle. A fierce battle soon unfolds between hero and monster as Link struggles to dodge the armored menace's brutal strikes and pierce his armor in the brief openings. As the blonde boy braces himself for his fatal blow on Onox, the general summons Din's crystal, cutting of the boy's attack in mid-jump and causing his sword to intersect with Din. Meanwhile, Maple frets about Link's well-being as she floats away with the rod. Convincing herself he's not worth it, the witch instead heads full-speed backwards on her disobedient broom, colliding into the fortress. She smashes into the falling Link and raises the Rod of Seasons, to find that it attracts Din's crystal to it, developing a strategy. As his shield flees, Onox reveals his true form- that of a deadly dragon.
