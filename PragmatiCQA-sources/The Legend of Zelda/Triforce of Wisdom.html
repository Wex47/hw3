  </h2>
  <p key="57097f69-d894-49f6-a060-d94161f5a705">
   The Goddesses ordained the Triforce as Hyrule’s providence, the ‘True Force’ to govern all and the ultimate source of power.
   Of all the powerful mystical forces in the realm of Hyrule, none compare to the Triforce; thus, whoever claims the Triforce gains virtual omnipotence, their power, wisdom or courage dwarfed only by the Goddesses themselves.
   The Triforce ultimately determines Hyrule's destiny, such that if a person with a righteous heart claims the Triforce, Hyrule will enter into a golden age of peace and prosperity. But, if a person with a wicked heart captures the Triforce, the kingdom will inevitably fall into an age of darkness. However, it is prophesied that if
   <a href="Ganon.html" key="3e1f8230-99f9-49c6-a236-cfe066bbc4f4" title="Ganon">
    one with an evil heart
   </a>
   were to claim the Triforce, a

   is destined to stand against him.
  </p>
  <p key="b5f96ded-f75d-4a6d-9b52-309c974464b7">
   The Triforce contains the essence of the Goddesses, but unlike the Goddesses, it does not discriminate between those who are good or evil. It grants the wishes of whoever obtains it, regardless of their motives.
   The stronger the wish, the more the wish comes true since the Triforce will express it more powerfully.
   The resting place of the Triforce, the Sacred Realm, is a mirror that will reflect the heart of the one who enters it and lays claim to the so-called "Sacred Triangle". This being said, one of two things can happen when this event occurs. If the heart of the one that holds the Sacred Triangle in his or her hands is pure and balanced, they will gain the True Force to govern all and the Sacred Realm will become a paradise. However, if the heart of the one that holds the Sacred Triangle does not contain an equal balance of Power, Wisdom and Courage, the Triforce will separate into its three component parts, leaving only the part representing the force that one most believes in and transforming the Sacred Realm into a world of evil as well.
   To gain the full power of the Triforce, the one who touched the Triforce must seek the two lost parts that will be held by two special individuals chosen by destiny, who will bear the mark of the Triforce on the backs of their hands.

   As mentioned in the

   However, as shown in
