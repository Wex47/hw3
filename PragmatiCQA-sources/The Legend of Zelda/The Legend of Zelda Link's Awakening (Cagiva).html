   After the
   first dungeon
   , Link is met by the
   Owl
   , who sends Felicia to assist him and look after him, storing the
   Instruments
   Link finds as light until he needs them again. Initially seeing Felicia as a pain due to her cheeky nature, Link proceeds to tease her and show off his abilities whenever he can. After the second dungeon, Link obtains the
   Ocarina
   from
   Madam MeowMeow
   as a thank-you for
   BowWow
   's return. Following this, Link encounters Marin at the beach, who expresses her desire to visit her friends at
   Animal Village
   . Immediately, Link agrees to take her, outrunning several enemies which try to attack him.

   Angler's Tunnel
   , his sword breaks. Although he is able to beat the
   Angler Fish
   with his broken sword, it is eventually the cause of his defeat by
   Karuna
   , who plunged him off a cliff. However, Link was saved by a ghost he had met outside of Angler's Tunnel,
   Nakura

   Escorting Nakura back to his home, Nakura reveals to Link a sword that he wielded in life, passing the sword onto Link as he departs into the afterlife. Soon after, Link encounters Karuna again, this time quickly killing the pig-warrior before heading to the

   In the Face Shrine, Link learns the truth about Koholint Island: that gathering and playing the Sirens of Awakening will result in both the awakening of the
   Wind Fish
   and the destruction of the dream island, Koholint.
  </p>
  <p key="f9063084-9f77-4e61-b734-dd0fa07fe570">
   Furious with both the Owl and Felicia for not telling him the truth, Link abandons his quest, heading back to
   Mabe Village
   to take Marin away with him. Although he extends the offer to
   Tarin
   as well,
   <span class="term" key="9daf24e0-14e0-4a40-86b6-6768633c9bbe">
    Tarin
   </span>
   declines, but allows Marin to go with him. However, the day before they can leave word reaches them that Animal Village is under attack by monsters which seek to stop the awakening of the Wind Fish. Heading there immediately, Link informs them that he is no longer trying to awaken the Wind Fish, but to no avail, as the monsters know that Koholint is a dream, and to them exist two options: be destroyed when the Wind Fish awakens, or continue to fight forever. Due to Link's choice, the second option is chosen. Disgusted, Link moves to dispose of each and every attacking monster before again returning to Mabe Village, setting sail with Marin.
  </p>
  <p key="3969d948-7c50-4297-a061-de5295439e41">
   A little after setting sail, the two find themselves unable to pass by an invisible barrier set in the sea. Despite Link's best efforts, Marin eventually convinces him to return to the island, seeing how he is damaging himself for her. Asking Marin why she wanted to leave, Link is met with the reply:
   <i key="6036bdcf-0048-49d0-ba1f-ff4949be92fd">
    It was a dream
   </i>
   , and is told that no matter how nice a dream is, eventually one must wake up.
  </p>
  <p key="4eb4447e-7787-4ebb-9fc2-1ad705e70c9f">
   As Marin heads back home, Link is met again by the owl, who asks Link who he is.  Link replies thinking this question is dumb that he is Link from Hyrule.  The Owl tells him that he is wrong, that there is no such place as Hyrule in this land of dreams, only this island.
   The Owl also tells him that he is only known as the Messenger of Awakening, not Link, on this island.
   Saddened, Link realizes that no matter what, he must continue his mission to awaken the Wind Fish, reuniting with Felicia and proceeding onwards.
  </p>
  <p key="c11a0c1b-f350-4763-840d-449f815e741f">
   Getting desperate, the monsters find themselves with only one option, to turn to
   Master Drona
   , a warrior who fights for no reason other than fun. While Link is caught in battle with the mighty
   Hinox
   , Felicia is kidnapped and taken to the
   Eagle's Tower
   . Only moments later, Link is able to best Master Drona with a secret move (Two Step Sword Revolution), dismissing Master Drona's love of combat as unimportant before heading to Eagle's Tower himself, defeating the kidnappers and
   Evil Eagle
   and the
   Grim Creeper
   , freeing Felicia and proceeding to gather the final two instruments.
  </p>
  <p key="6e82706f-4559-40b5-9944-383b43a43fbd">
   As the two stand before the Wind Fish's egg, Link bids farewell to Felicia as he steps inside the egg alone to fight the
   Nightmare
   , who identifies itself as the god of Koholint Island. As Link fights the monster, it attempts to mentally subdue him, telling him that the people of Koholint may only survive if he stops fighting.
  </p>
  <p key="6ecb9492-3a53-4cc6-b858-0feb32b45774">
   Ignoring the Nightmare, Link is able to finally best the creature, destroying it and revealing the Wind Fish, who apologises to Link, saying that the Nightmare was created due to the weakness in the Wind Fish's heart before coaxing Link to play the
   Ballad of the Wind Fish
   , dispelling the dream and returning Link to reality.
  </p>
  <p key="acde5f23-2183-4ed8-b3e3-717916ae54d8">
   As Link awakens amidst the rubble of his ship, his old sword returned to him, he contemplates if everything was his own dream before seeing the Wind Fish in the sky. Happily, Link concludes that everything that happened to him was real.
