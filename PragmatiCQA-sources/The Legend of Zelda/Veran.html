  </h2>
  <p key="d5a27de3-28a6-40e5-8e84-932260e6371e">
   Veran appears as a teal-skinned woman with a lightly-armored dress. Her abilities are very similar to that of a
   Wizzrobe
   , as she can teleport at will, create a flurry of fireballs, and summon spider-like creatures from the ceiling. One of her more terrifying abilities is to possess other beings, forcing them to do her bidding. Those under her possession gain her teal skin, but this never seems to be noticed by other characters. Veran can assume other shapes seemingly at will, but her true form is the Evil Fairy. With this she can spit fireballs and fly quickly, as well as produce at least four weak Shadow Links. If this fails, she can assume several animal forms. This is supposedly her last resort, as she decidedly finds these transformations to be utterly repulsive.
  </p>
  <p key="8eae0f6d-22b1-42f8-a5b0-787057fb8d60">
   Veran is manipulative, cruel, and ambitious. She is also somewhat conceited, declaring her own beauty several times throughout the game. She does seem to be capable of granting mercy to a certain extent, as evidenced by her sparing
   Ralph
   's life, though this could also merely be a ploy to force Link not to attack her in order to protect Ralph, since she is in Ralph's ancestor's body. It is also somewhat interesting to note the vaguely

   symbol
   on her shoulder pads that she shares with General Onox.
  </p>
  <p key="fb007bb2-3868-4797-8b2a-c2fb4efda7e4">
   Battling Veran has several different strategies, depending on which form she is in.

   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="1b4ad25b-f705-4fee-8d01-b00114bf418a">
   Possessed Nayru's only attack consists of shooting fireballs in a radial pattern. The projectiles spread out the further they travel, and Link's shield can't block them, so it's best to walk in the gaps that form at a distance.
  </p>
  <p key="d3f58947-20fd-4fda-afb1-13e9428f9dab">
   The only way to attack Veran herself is by shooting her with
   Mystery Seeds
   from Link's
   <a href="Seed Shooter.html" key="239c8870-b2c5-4deb-a1c2-baa4a8885b66" title="Seed Shooter">
    Seed Shooter
   </a>
   , or simply sprinkling the Seed on her. If hit, Veran will temporarily lose her possession,
   but she'll seep back into Nayru if Link is not fast enough. By switching places with her via the
   Switch Hook
   , she'll have a tougher time getting back to the body, and Link will have the opportunity to slash her at least once.
   Even so, Possessed Nayru will often hide behind pillars scattered across the room while she prepares an attack, making it harder to hit her with the Seed Shooter and Switch Hook fast enough to get an attack in. If the attack process is repeated three times, Veran will be temporarily defeated, and Naryu will be freed.

  <p key="5f5564a7-3072-4747-9423-f929ed17c0f6">
   The strategy for Ambi is little different than it was for Nayru. As Ambi, the only new ability Veran obtains is the ability to summon small spiders. Besides this, the strategy is still to use
   Mystery Seeds
   when she stops moving, then to use the
   Switch Hook
   to pull Veran out of Ambi.

  <p key="45e16bab-e758-41ce-84eb-9e023e098765">
   Veran's true form is drastically different in appearance to the normal form she takes. Taking on the form of a demonic
   <a href="Fairy.html" key="c558cee0-e1ad-43cf-a78c-58aa8e303572" title="Fairy">
    Fairy

    Dark Links
   </a>
   , which behave similarly to
   Arm-Mimics
   in that they copy Link's movements. The four Dark Links always yield one heart each upon their defeat.
  </p>
  <p key="968aacbd-3bd8-48c9-84d5-bcda1c15433b">
   Veran's attacks in this form changed little from her other form, her signature energy attack becoming much faster, she will also shoot small and large blue fire balls, and of course physical contact.
To defeat this form, Link simply had to attack her with his sword whenever she came into range, taking care to dodge her attacks. By repeating this method, Veran appeared to be defeated. As Link, Ralph and Nayru exited the Black Tower, a sudden rumbling had Link push Ralph and Nayru away, as a
   Wallmaster
   carried Link back to the top.

  <p key="95bc0a47-fe92-43ba-87d4-d7418febb9ec">
   As the Wallmaster released Link, a truly horrific side of Veran was revealed, as she appeared to Link in the forms she had wished to keep a secret from everybody. Now, with no other choice before her, Veran revealed her Metamorphosis state.

  <p key="5172c9a1-ce02-4f82-a667-b0ac200061cd">
   During this phase, Veran is prone to randomly changing between her three shapes. There is no order in which Veran will change shapes, with the exception that she will always start in beetle form. Although she will normally change back to beetle after assuming one of her other two forms, it is entirely possible for her to go from Spider to Bee and vice-versa.

   As little more than an oversized, grotesque beetle in this form, Link quickly realized that all Veran could do now was jump and land, creating a pool of acid underneath her when she landed. By attacking her face when she emerged with the sword, she would then transform into one of two forms.

   . By using a Bomb on this state, Veran would show her face for a few valuable seconds, allowing Link to attack her with his Sword. After Veran sustains enough damage, given her life, she will either revert to her beetle form or she will fall.

     Oracle of Ages

    manga briefly expands on Veran's motivations for wanting to cause discord, as she believes that peace and prosperity are boring.
    Veran is first shown when the Twinrova summon her to their chamber. They warn her not to underestimate Link, since he was able to best
    General Onox
    , the General of Darkness.
    Veran assures the

    witches that she will succeed and disappears.
    When she arrives in Labrynna, Veran possesses a young girl and uses her to ask Link to purchase flowers.
    Link agrees, only to have Veran call him stupid and ask how he can idle with the approaching shadows.
    Confused, Link watches the girl leave while Veran jumps into Impa, taking control of her. Using her newfound host, Veran leads Link to a stone marked with the Triforce, asking him to open it because it is too heavy for her.
    Link laughs because moments ago Impa had lifted a
    Cow
    .
    He is quickly silenced after a possessed Impa yells at him to do it.
    Despite his suspicions, Link moves the stone and continues with her onward. As they enter a forest, Nayru feels the presence of darkness and light.
    When the two enter her glade, Nayru introduces herself as an
    oracle
    who has abilities over time.
    Nayru demonstrates her power by foreseeing Link's future, leading Veran to ask Nayru through Impa if she knows her own fate.
    Nayru replies that she does, which is why she had hidden herself in the forest.
    Despite this, the oracle accepts that she cannot outwit the
    Goddess of Time
    .
    Veran laughs at Nayru's compliance and reveals who she is.
    Alarmed, the forest animals attack Impa to protect Nayru but do so in vain. Veran takes control of Nayru's body and travels to the past to complete her promise to the Twinrova.

    spreading agony and pain throughout Labrynna. After being captured by
    Sir Raven
    , Link escapes using a fishhook to pick the lock.
    Link overhears a conversation between Raven, Ambi and a possessed Nayru. Queen Ambi orders Link to be executed for treason after being convinced by the oracle, unaware he has escaped.
    Through Nayru, Veran explains to Ambi what will happen when her tower reaches the heavens.
    This pushes the queen into forcing the women and children into labor.
    The possessed Nayru goes to tell Link his fate.
    She is deeply angered when she discovers he has escaped.

    Sometime later, Link confronts the possessed Nayru. He prepares to attack but Veran laughs at him, telling him that the only one he will hurt is Nayru.
    She then brings the castle's stone dragons to life to attack Link.
    Link wonders what Veran's weakness could be.
    Veran summons large felines to attack him further.
    Veran does not relent, turning the large felines into fiery beats.
    Suddenly,
    Ralph
    appears, who used the Harp of Ages to enter the past. Ralph is excited to see Nayru at first, but is then attacked by his possessed friend. Link explains that Veran is still possessing her.
    Ralph begins to form a plan but Link accidentally strums the harp and the two are warped elsewhere.

    As Link and Ralph are dealing with their dilemma, Veran becomes suspicious of Sir Raven.
    While Nayru sleeps, Veran decides to leave her host and spy on the knight.
    Veran is surprised that Link knows Raven and possesses Ralph.
    Roperi
    notices something wrong with Ralph,
    yet Link laughs off her concern.
    The villagers, Link, and Raven discuss the weakness of demons that can possess, which are
    Mystery Seeds
    .
    Raven says he has some Seeds, which turn out to be the exact ones needed. The men ready themselves for the next day when they will confront Veran. However, while the men rest, Veran uses Ralph to burn the Seeds. She releases him and sends
    Ramrock
    to destroy the village.
    In an effort to eliminate Link, Veran captures his ancestor Raven, knowing that killing him will also extinguish Link.
    After a short fight, Veran's troops leave with their prize. Link notices that he is starting fade because if Raven is executed he will disappear.
    Determined, he and Ralph set off to rescue the knight.

    Through Nayru, Veran tells Queen Ambi to pronounce judgement on Sir Raven.
    Veran tells the people watching to cry out in sorrow as their only hero is sacrificed to her whim and the Black Tower is completed.
    Ambi does so, yet the execution is delayed when Ralph and Link interfere. Veran is surprised to see that Link has not faded away
    and commands the guards to kill Raven.
    When the guards hesitate, she attempts to stab Raven with a spear using Nayru but is stopped by Link.
    Ralph and Link convince Queen Ambi to stop building the tower, turning Labrynna's sorrow into joy.
    Furious, Veran releases Nayru and possesses Ambi instead.
    Within her newest host, Veran orders the guards to imprison them.
    Luckily, Nayru wakes from her unconscious state and transports the group back to Labrynna's present.
    After discussing what to do about Veran, they return to the past. Nayru reveals that Roperi's plant is a
    Mystery Tree
    , which produces the needed Seeds to defeat Veran.
    Nayru uses the her ability over time to speed the sapling's growth,
    but Ralph goes to confront Veran by himself.
   </p>
   <p key="d1a0327d-1f2f-45c9-93dc-2cb5dcb0ec26">
    Ralph enters the tower and threatens to attack with Veran with a sword. Veran says that only Ambi will die if he does.
    She also states her knowledge of Ralph and Ambi's bloodline connection, as she had possessed them both.
    Veran then dares Ralph to kill her.
    Seeing that Ralph is serious about killing her, Veran attempts to attack him herself, only to realize that Ambi's body does not have magical abilities like Nayru.
    To save herself, she flees and yells for the tower's construction to hurry.
    When Ralph corners her, she says her desire will still be a success even with her death.
    Despite this, Ralph readies himself to kill her. As he charges, Sir Raven and Link arrive, Link shooting a Mystery Seed at Queen Ambi. The seed causes Ambi to go unconscious as Veran is forced from her host, transforming her into her spider form. Enraged at being in her true form, Veran swears to avenge herself by killing Link.
    She catches Link with her spider silk, but he breaks free with his sword. As the two battle each other, Link notices a box of
    <a href="Bomb.html" key="56bc7eb9-0c0b-4052-bba5-18fca4de91a3" title="Bomb">
     Bombs
    </a>
    and tosses it at Veran's eyes.
    After a moment of pain, Veran shoots webbing across the tower's interior, forcing Link to the building's roof.
    She grabs the hero and begins to slowly crush him to death.
    Link slashes at her to release himself. Veran suddenly is immobile, which she believes may be caused by the Triforce's power.
    Link seizes the opportunity and stabs one of Veran's eyes. Although she is nearing death Veran grabs Link, holding a bomb and refusing to die alone.
    As Link struggles, Sir Raven arrives and cuts him free from her grasp. Together the knights strike Veran. Even as she dies, Veran sends a final lamentation of her own to the Twinrova,
    lighting the
    Flame of Sorrow
    .
    Combined with Twinrova's own sacrifice, Ganon is resurrected and defeated by the heroes.
