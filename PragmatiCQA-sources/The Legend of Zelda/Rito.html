   appear as humanoids with pointed ears, wide red eyes, orangish-yellowish beaks in place of noses, and talon legs. Many members have dark skin and white hair that is often braided; the exception to this being
   Medli
   , a female Rito who has light skin and red hair tied into a ponytail. Whether or not this is a difference of sex in the race is unknown. Rito are initially wingless; when they come of age, they must travel to Valoo and receive a scale that will enable them to grow their wings.
   Most Rito have their wings folded around their arms as "sleeves", the exception being Medli and the
   Rito Chieftain
   . When they take flight, their arms spontaneously transform into open wings. Their ability to fly makes them well suited as mail carriers across the
   Great Sea
   . The Rito were not always creatures of the sky, and the
   Grappling Hook
   is a remnant of those days.

   Revali
   , the Rito Champion from a century prior.
   While Rito can fly forward, they cannot ascend on their own and rely on the wind to lift them upwards.
   The art of creating an updraft to soar high into the sky, which Revali could do, is considered to be a masterpiece of aerial techniques even among the Rito.

   and for when they fly at high altitudes. A young Rito's feathers molt once per year, and the feathers have formed a thriving industry for the Rito who use them to craft clothes for Hylians or beds. Known for their musical abilities, the Rito pass down legends in the form of songs.
   They are not particularly long-lived.

   The Zoras evolved over the span of a century into the Rito after the events of the
   Great Flood
   because of the unnatural water created by the gods, which was uninhabitable to Zora.
   They live in
   Dragon Roost Island
   , specifically within the
   Rito Aerie
   , a small cavern to the side of the island mountain. Due to their wings enabling them to fly over the Great Sea with ease, they mainly work as post carriers, and as such their Aerie is mainly used as a
   Post Office
   . Their location is significantly important to their way of life; it is where
   Valoo
   the Sky Spirit roosts atop the
   Dragon Roost Cavern
   peak. When a Rito reaches adulthood, they must receive their wings by traveling to Valoo to receive a scale. A Rito is appointed among the tribe to serve as Valoo's attendant. As Valoo can only speak in
   ancient Hylian
   , his attendant is tasked with translating his words.
   Performing music for Valoo is also an expected duty of the attendant.
   The tribe is led by the
   Rito Chieftain
   .

   Golden Feathers
   are very popular among Rito women.
   Before taking flight, the Rito customarily go to visit the
   Wind God's Shrine
   at the base of the island.
   The Rito also sponsor the
   Bird-Man Contest
   on the
   Flight Control Platform
   every year.

   The first Rito Link encounters is
   Quill
   , a postman who visits
   Outset Island
   around the time when the
   Helmaroc King
   abducted
   Aryll
   after mistaking her for
   Tetra
   . It is by Quill's urging, pointing out that Aryll would have never been taken had it not been for Tetra and her
   Pirate Crew
   's arrival, that convinces Tetra to ferry Link to the
   Forsaken Fortress
   where his sister is imprisoned. Link's failure to rescue her, and subsequent meeting with the
   King of Red Lions
   , eventually brings him to the Rito's home of Dragon Roost Island.
  </p>
  <p key="6088f15e-e7cc-4d3d-8485-9e87287de314">
   There, Link learns that the Rito are having a crisis. Valoo has become violent and restless, preventing the Rito from receiving his scales needed to grow their wings, and is thus threatening their way of life.
   Furthermore, the Rito Chieftain is also concerned about his son,
   Komali
   , and his lack of confidence in light of the situation.
   Valoo's previous attendant and Komali's grandmother had recently passed away, dashing Komali's confidence and turning him into a recluse.
   The young Prince now spends his days cooped up in his room with
   Din's Pearl
   , a treasure of the Rito that his grandmother gave him.
  </p>
  <p key="a4171d66-3758-4542-80a2-d517b0582619">
   While trying to encourage Prince Komali, Link is asked by
   Medli
   , the newly appointed attendant and former apprentice of Komali's grandmother,
   to meet her outside at the
   Dragon Roost Pond
   . There she asks Link for help in reaching the entrance to Dragon Roost Cavern, which she cannot reach due to the wind's direction. Link helps her and Medli goes on ahead to help Valoo, and Link decides to follow. He later finds her captured by a

   and rescues her. Medli then informs him that she has discovered that something within the Cavern is harassing Valoo. Link discovers that the cause of Valoo's distress is in fact a

    Gohma

  <p key="e51d0c55-af0c-4e16-97da-270a113b9292">
   Later during his quest, Link eventually meets the spirit of
   Laruto
   , the deceased Zoran
   Sage of Earth
   who was killed by
   Ganondorf
   's forces, resulting in the

   losing some of its former power. Laruto beseeches that Link finds her successor, the one who carries the same
   Harp
   as she, who is destined to become the next Sage of Earth.
   Link locates Medli, and after playing the "
   Earth God's Lyric
   ," awakens her as the Sage of Earth. Together they travel to the
   Earth Temple
   where Link defeats the evil there, allowing Medli to pray so the Master Sword can regain some of its power.
