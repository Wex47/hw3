   Ganon's Tower
   and urged him to rescue the others.
   When Link collected all the Crystals, including one which sealed Princess Zelda in
   Turtle Rock
   , they helped break the barrier around Ganon's Tower as promised, allowing Link to go in and defeat Ganon once and for all.
   During the ending, the Maidens are seen finally restored to their normal Hylian form, along with the revived King of Hyrule and
   Soldiers

   On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the Shrine Maidens feared that the reason for those events was that

   They summoned Link to the castle so he could protect them while they opened the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they did however, the portal turned dark and
   Shadow Link
   came from it. Using the confusion his looks caused, he abducted the Shrine Maidens and sealed them in

   Not the one to sit back and do nothing, Link entered the portal the Shrine Maidens had created before their capture and drew the Four Sword, thereby accepting the destiny of the Hero and the responsibility to free the Shrine Maidens.
   Each Shrine Maiden he freed helped him reach another part of Hyrule, usually the part they watched over. They also used their ability to travel in
   fairy-form
   to accompany Link from time to time and hand him instructions on how to proceed. Once the sixth Shrine Maiden was freed, the group united their powers to call for Princess Zelda,
   whom they found out to be held in the Tower of Winds. They urged Link to find the last royal jewel not yet in his possession so that they could summon the tower back to Hyrule.
   The Shrine Maidens then went ahead to the Four Sword Sanctuary to keep it safe from attacks in the time Link would need to get the remaining royal jewel and to prepare for the ceremony.
   When Link returned with all four royal jewels, the Shrine Maidens wasted no time on bringing back the Tower of Winds.
   Link proceeded to rescue Zelda, who promised that she and the Shrine Maidens would prevent the evil Link had been fighting from recovering, but that he had to destroy Vaati to make peace return truly.

    , who saves them from
    Shadow Link
    . Unfortunately, they do not have enough
    force
    to break the seal on her crystal prison, so they begrudgingly leave her there to return later. She senses that Zelda is still alive, far away, and she urges them to travel to
    Eastern Hyrule
    , where she believes another Maiden is sealed in the
    Eastern Temple
    .

    After defeating
    Stone Arrghus
    at the
    Village of the Blue Maiden
    , they find the Yellow Maiden in the Eastern Temple. Overjoyed, she gives Green a
    Moon Pearl
    , which will open a gateway to the
    Dark World
    when struck by moonbeams. The Yellow Maiden later sends a
    Fairy
    to help Red and the others, which is able to transport them across Hyrule much like the Maidens are able to in their Fairy forms in the game.

    The four heroes do not meet the Maidens again until near the end of their quest, at the Four Sword Sanctuary. Due to their efforts in dispelling the barriers of darkness and destroying
    Shadow Link
    , they are freed from their capture and appear before them together. By combining their powers, they transport the four Links to the
    Tower of Winds
    , and urge them to defeat Vaati and restore Hyrule to peace.
