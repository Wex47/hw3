   When Link awakens, the Skull Kid takes off on Epona with the Ocarina and leads Link on a chase.
  </p>
  <p key="9a1bc568-6321-478f-ab49-e287e726cb35">
   When Link catches up with the Skull Kid, he tells Link that he "got rid of" Epona,
   and uses the dark magic of Majora's Mask to transform Link into a
   Deku Scrub
   .
   He then leaves Link with Tael, while Tatl continues to beat the helpless Deku back. However, Tatl's delay causes her to be separated from her brother and the Skull Kid.
   She then insists that Link take her with him, so that they can work together to find the Skull Kid and Tael.
   With limited abilities, Link follows the Skull Kid's path and finds himself inside the
   Clock Tower
   of
   Clock Town
   , where he meets the
   Happy Mask Salesman
   .
   The Happy Mask Salesman reveals that the Skull Kid stole Majora's Mask from him and that he can return Link to his human form if he finds the Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.
   He also warns Link that he must leave in three days,
   and that Link must retrieve the Mask and the Ocarina by then.
   Link sets off in his Deku form, finding himself in the parallel world of

    Moon
   </a>
   , which bears a grimacing and ominous face, steadily growing closer to the Town as Skull Kid pulls it out of its orbit.
   At midnight on the
   Final Day
   before the Mask Salesman's departure, Link is able to reach the top of the Clock Tower for a face-off with the Skull Kid. Upon arriving, Tatl asks that the Skull Kid give Majora's Mask back.
   Seemingly not hearing,
   Tael delivers an enigmatic warning to Tatl, to find four beings from the swamp, mountain, ocean, and canyon.
  </p>
  <p key="8b1e632a-9661-4c84-890d-84dcdffe9be2">
   The Skull Kid, in response to Tael's outburst, hits the Fairy aside.
   He then laughs about how even if "
   they
   " were to come, they would not be able to stop him.
   He then points Link and Tatl's attention to the Moon and challenges them to stop it from falling.
   With an unearthly shriek, he begins to bring the Moon down to Termina. Link fires a magic
   Bubble Blast
   , a skill learned earlier, at the Skull Kid, causing him to drop the Ocarina of Time. On picking it up, memories of Link's departure from Hyrule flood back to him. Link remembers

    Princess Zelda

   bidding him a sad farewell and telling him that the
   Goddess of Time
   is watching over him.
   After being snapped out of this reverie by Tatl,
   Link plays the "
   <a href="Song of Time.html" key="be497f4e-efe8-430e-a287-a8feb163399f" title="Song of Time">

  </p>
  <p key="ec95888a-23c6-4d7b-a25e-ae5769f66159">
   Link heads back to the Happy Mask Salesman, who teaches him the "
   Song of Healing
   ".
   Playing this song with the Ocarina of Time returns Link to his regular self, with the only remnants of his time as a Deku being a
   Mask
   , which he can wear to become Deku Link once again.
   After aiding Link, the Mask Salesman asks that Link uphold his part of the bargain and return the Mask that the Skull Kid stole.
   Upon learning that Link could not recover the Mask, the Salesman grows furious, berating Link and wildly informing him that the Mask, known as Majora's Mask, is an ancient artifact that possesses an apocalyptic power.
   He again requests that Link recover the Mask,
   stating that he believes that Link can do it.

   Upon arriving at the swamp, Link finds the area poisoned, apparently due to the disappearance of the Swamp's guardian god.
   After venturing through the

   This enables Link to inhabit Darmani's body and disguise himself as the deceased Goron warrior. After learning the "

   Link returns to the Clock Tower at the end of the Final Day to confront the Skull Kid once and for all. The Skull Kid begins to bring the Moon down to Termina once more, but this time, Link summons the Four Giants with the "Oath to Order" to stop its descent. The Four Giants successfully halt the Moon's fall and knock the Skull Kid unconscious. Tatl and Tael reunite,
   and Tatl chastises the Skull Kid for lacking the strength of will and heart to withstand the power of Majora's Mask.
   Now seeing the Skull Kid as useless,
   Majora's Mask separates itself from him and warps inside the Moon. There, the Mask possesses the Moon and attempts to consume all of Termina.
   Link and Tatl follow the Mask inside, finding a surreal field, in which there is a tree and five

After completing the game up to the point before Link fights the final battle against Majora's Mask, it is possible to complete several side dungeons in which Link plays a game of Hide and Seek with a series of children, at the cost of progressively giving up all of the Masks collected prior (although they are still available after the game is completed).

   While thinking in ideas for the game, Aonuma met Yoshiaki Koizumi, who proposed a system of time passing where the same moments would be played over and over again.
   Thus, the three-day system was created. However, an entire week was originally planned, but was later shortened to only three days to make it easier to remember the character schedules.
   The idea of the Moon falling came to Koizumi while daydreaming about what would happen if the Moon started to fall towards Earth.
   During development of

Another achievement from the Expansion Pak is that multiple non-playable characters can perform different tasks without impacting on the framerate, larger level design was possible, and many more enemies are present at the same time (most notably in

It has been ranked the 7th-greatest game of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) in the Top 100 Games of Time seen in their 100th issue, where
