   within the series; as such, he is a villain of pure evil and a cruel, ruthless warlord whose goal is to usurp the Kingdom of Hyrule. Ganon's only ambition in life is to obtain the Triforce and dominate the world using the abilities imbued by them. He has many characteristics of a megalomaniac. Despite his undeniable lust for power, Ganon is a mastermind; he is an adept tactician and a master of manipulation and deceit. It is not unusual for Ganon to manipulate the events of a story behind the scenes (as he did in

   ), only to be revealed as the orchestrator in a plot twist. Ganon usually presents himself with the facade of a cynical yet calm and civil man, although he is known to very quickly become enraged, ensuing in a murderous rampage. Ganon has no sense of morality. In his conquest of the Sacred Realm, once he reached the
   Temple of Light
   , he single-handedly killed all of his followers who had aided him in his expedition, so that he could claim the Triforce uncontested. He is also culturally inclined, playing the organ with great skill, as seen in
   <i key="2b4fd95e-efc5-4781-a645-a86acab2fd1e">
    Ocarina of Time

   where he plays his own theme throughout Link's attack in his
   Tower
   . Ganon also possesses an arrogant sense of entitlement; he believes himself to be the only one worthy of ruling the kingdom of Hyrule. His pride is also shown when fighting enemies: despite being more than capable of defeating most enemies in combat, Ganon instead relies on his minions to defeat them. Apparently, he chooses to only fight opponents he deems worthy, such as Link.

   Ganondorf was also an immensely powerful sorcerer with vast mystical resources. Additionally, Ganondorf has proven himself to be a very talented swordsman, as seen in the final battles between him and Link in

   to god-like proportions, his power unrivaled by any mortal, for he ceased to be mortal in that moment. Becoming a monstrously powerful demon king, Ganondorf became utterly unstoppable, conquering Hyrule with ease. He also implies that the Triforce of Power was sufficient enough to allow him to weaken any seals on him overtime.

   , the Triforce of Power also grants Ganondorf invulnerability; using its power, he is capable of enduring mortal wounds (such as having his chest pierced by a sword during his attempted
   execution
   ), and only the likes of the most powerful sacred weapons (such as the

   His power, with or without the Triforce, appears to grow over time. The sages in Arbiter's Grounds, when discussing his evil power, mention it being pure malice and hatred. As the Calamity-Ganon, his very essence is known as 'malice', possibly meaning that his demonic magic and power is fuelled as much by his own hatred as the Triforce, and his capacity for hatred is the only true limit on how powerful he can grow.

   The game's English manual instead opted for the spelling "Ganon".

   Using the last of his power, Ganondorf tries to make his castle collapse to kill Link and Zelda, but the two manage to escape safely.

   Ganondorf is then sealed into the void of the Evil Realm where he cannot harm Hyrule or lay his hands on the remaining pieces of the Triforce.

   knowing that he will have the opportunity as long as he possesses the Triforce of Power.

   Tower

   Link finds Zelda unharmed, lying in a bed, sleeping, with Ganondorf watching over her and her dreams.

   and his desire to take over the green landscapes of Hyrule. When he declares that he already has in his possession the Triforce of Wisdom, Ganondorf suddenly rushes against Link and delivers swift, hard blows that leave Link half-conscious and the Master Sword out of reach. Ganondorf, using his Triforce of Power, summons the two missing Triforce pieces from Link and Zelda and reforms the

   The Triforce disappears and water starts pouring through the protective barrier into the land of Hyrule as Ganondorf laughs scornfully. Link wakes up at that point and Zelda approaches him holding the Master Sword for Link to engage Ganondorf in a last battle. Ultimately with Zelda's aid, Ganondorf is defeated when Link deals the final blow by plunging the Master Sword straight into Ganondorf's forehead, turning him into stone
   and killing him.
   Immediately before his death, however, Ganondorf, with slight satisfaction, referenced the brutal winds that had long plagued the Gerudo.

   Even the Divine Beasts, with their pilots slain, fell under the control of incarnations of Ganon's
   Malice
   .
   With their strongest weapons turned against them, Hyrule was laid to ruin and Link grievously wounded, requiring him to sleep in a
   Sheikah healing chamber
   for 100 years.
   Princess Zelda went to confront the Calamity Ganon on her own and managed to seal him once more, though this required her to also become his prisoner to maintain the seal.
