   Like its sister countries of Hyrule and
   Holodrum
   , Labrynna is a vibrant country rich in beauty and resources. The land is bordered by a vast ocean, the
   Zora Seas
   , that flows to Labrynna's southern border, and the land is home to many interesting tribes such as the
   Labrynnans
   (the
   Human
   population of Labrynna), the
   Zoras
   , the

   , the
   Tokay
   of
   Crescent Island
   , and many other citizens. Labrynna's most imposing feature however is perhaps the great
   Black Tower
   that stands at the center of the country, visible from almost anywhere, even from far out into the sea.
   Rich in history, Labrynna has had more than one type of a ruling government, originating with a monarchy several centuries in its past, but ruled in the present day by a republic, though it has always retained the same capital city seemingly,
   Lynna City
   (previously known as
   Lynna Village
   ).
   Curiously, the land of Labrynna is most notable for its deep connection to the flows of time (as the home of the eight

   and the Oracle's protector, the

   , Labrynna is a country blessed with a long, rich history. It is unknown how the land of Labrynna was formed, though it is assumed by many to have been created, like the land of
   Termina
   , as a side effect of the
   Golden Goddesses
   ' creation of the land of Hyrule. It is also unknown exactly how long the country of Labrynna has been established, though it is confirmed that the country has existed for more than 400 years by the Maku Tree.
   Four hundred years in its past, Labrynna was ruled by a royal family (who ruled from the capital city of the country,
   Lynna Village
   ) similar to that of Hyrule, with the ruler of the time being the beloved
   <a href="Queen Ambi.html" key="c69ff7cb-f224-486b-b73f-3d4cc5ab9bc2" title="Queen Ambi">
    Queen Ambi

   , known best for her kindness and benevolence amongst her people.
   Many diverse races have inhabited Labrynna since this ancient period as well; in fact, pretty much all of the current races inhabiting Labrynna have their roots going back as far as the reign of Queen Ambi and beyond. With the passing of time however, so did the times change, as a new republican government was formed at some point to supplant Labrynna's ancient monarchy. In the present age, Labrynna is presided over by the mayor of present day
   Lynna City
   ,
   Mayor Plen
   .
   As the government of Labrynna changed with the passing of time, so too did the land's geography. Over the course of 400 years, previously small deities such as
   Lord Jabu-Jabu
   and the Maku Tree
   grew to humongous sizes, and many geographical features of the land changed, such as Zora Seas islands' drift westward, the receding of the
   Zora Seas
   , the transformation of the
   Sea of No Return
   into the
   Yoll Graveyard
   , the sinking of

   , the ruler that commissioned the building of the gigantic
   Black Tower
   that stands at the center of Labrynna to the present day, long after the end of her reign.
   After being ruled by a monarchy for many generations, Labrynna shifted to a republic at some unspecified point in its history, reverting power into the hands of elected officials and renaming the capital city of the country instead as
   Lynna City
   , the city having grown over the course of the 400 years since Ambi's reign. The current ruling official of the country is the Mayor of Lynna City,

   . Much of the same values applied to differing colors of Rupees also apply to Labrynna's financial system (e.g. green is worth one Rupee, red is worth five Rupees, etc). Pretty much every shop or establishment throughout Labrynna accepts Rupees as the preferred form of payment for good or services.
   However, on the mysterious Crescent Island, a system of trade is instituted rather than a currency system of Rupees.
   As such, while on the mainland of Labrynna Rupees are the dominant form of currency, the trade system is in use amongst Crescent Island's Tokay population.

   Labrynna is and has always been home to many very interesting and curious locales throughout its history, many of which survive to the present day. With the passing of time, many of these places have changed aesthetically in a variety of ways ranging from the very subtle (e.g. Zora Seas islands' shift westward) to the most radical (e.g. the transformation of the Sea of No Return into the Yoll Graveyard). By and large however, many locales are still halfway recognizable in their present states in comparison to how they looked in the past.
