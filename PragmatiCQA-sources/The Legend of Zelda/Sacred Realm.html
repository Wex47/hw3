In a desperate last resort, the Seven Sages seal Ganon along with the complete Triforce away in the Sacred Realm, which was already transformed into the Dark World, as a reflection of Ganondorf's evil heart.
   Hyrule enjoys a brief period of peace, but as rumors spread of the Golden Power lying in the Sacred Realm, many greedy people traveled to the Sacred Realm seeking it, but never to return. Within the Dark World, they were transformed into monsters by the power of the Triforce and became a part of Ganon's army. From here, he launched an invasion of Hyrule that was repelled by the Knights of Hyrule and the Seven Wise Men.
   The wise men then sealed the gateway to the Golden Land that Ganondorf had discovered, locking him away within the now-tainted Sacred Realm in a conflict that came to be known as the

The Essence of the Triforce explains that the Dark World was formerly the Golden Land where the Triforce had resided since ancient times, before Ganon found his way into the realm by accident and laid claim to the Triforce, causing the realm's transformation into the Dark World.
   It goes on to explain that the Triforce will now await a new master, and that the Dark World will vanish entirely upon the new master's wish before going on to instruct Link to touch the Triforce with a wish in his heart. Link touches the Triforce and wishes all of Ganon's evil to be undone, which returns peace and prosperity to the land of Hyrule and restores the Golden Land to its former self.

   In this story, Lanayru shows Link images of the creation of Hyrule by the Golden Goddesses as well as the Sacred Realm itself, speaking of its beauty and how the Triforce came into being. The goddesses descended upon the then chaotic world and granted peace and life to the world, and once they granted equal power to all the living beings, they returned to a land in the heavens that came to be known as the Sacred Realm.
   For ages, the people lived content in mind and body, but soon word of the Sacred Realm spread across the world, along with that of the wish-granting Triforce it contained.
   Tales spoke of how the Triforce could make mortal dreams come true and would grant the wishes of whoever held it as long as they lived. Lust for the Triforce's power caused much bloodshed amongst Hyrule's people until finally a group of powerful sorcerers, the Dark Interlopers, attempted to seize control of the Sacred Realm and take the Triforce for their own (by means of a mighty weapon that was of their own design, the
   Fused Shadow
   ), sparking a
   civil war
   that raged across Hyrule.
   As this war dragged on, the four
   Light Spirits
   intervened at the behest of the Golden Goddesses, chasing the Dark Interlopers across Hyrule and into the twilight, locking them away in the

   As time would go on, the Interlopers would grow into a gentler race in the form of the
