   . They live in a harsh desert that bears their name.
   The climate of the desert has made the Gerudo tough and resourceful.
   They are warriors by reputation, feared and respected in the countries they inhabit.
   Due to a unique biological quirk, the race consists almost solely of females. A single male Gerudo is born into the tribe every hundred years. This male is destined by Gerudo law to become their king.
   Ganondorf
   is the only Gerudo male to have appeared in the series.

   When there is no male to be their king, the Gerudo are led by a chief with the position passed on from mother to daughter.
   The exact nature of this phenomenon is never explained. It is known, however, that at least during the

   Their skin color, however, has been shown to come in two tones: a common light brown and an olive-greenish variation seen on Twinrova and Ganondorf. Gerudo in

   To do that she needs the
   Silver Gauntlets
   , a treasure kept in a part of the Temple that she is too big to enter. Impressed with Link's attitude, she requests he help her by retrieving the Gauntlets for her.
   However, Link never manages to hand them to Nabooru, as she is spotted by Twinrova and taken away. Link travels through time again and returns to the Temple with the Silver Gauntlets as an adult. Deep inside the Temple, he encounters Twinrova again and an
   Iron Knuckle
   . Link defeats the Iron Knuckle and reveals that it is in fact Nabooru, brainwashed into servitude of Ganondorf for the past seven years.
   Her regained freedom is cut short when Twinrova decide to abduct her again, to which Link follows the two and battles. Though strong and utilizing their "

   Against their belief, Ganondorf had successfully reached the Pyramid. When he had touched the Trident, he was transformed into Ganon, the King of Darkness. Ganon became directly responsible for all of the events that would transpire thereafter, as his theft of the
