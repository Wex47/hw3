   as his command.
   However, the King too was human and, anticipating his death, he hoped to find someone with the innate qualities that were fitting of a worthy possessor of the Triforce for if it were to fall in the wrong hands, evil would befall Hyrule.
   Unfortunately, he was unable to find any such person during his lifespan and, since his own son did not fit this archetype for being worthy to possess the one true Triforce,
   the King elected to split the relic into its three component parts, leaving the

   Valley of Death

   that was set at the head of the valley, guarded by many powerful monsters handpicked by the King himself.
   The King cast a magical barrier over the entire Valley of Death, one that would not grant entry to the valley until six special crystals were restored to their respective statues in six other palaces that lay across Hyrule. He also secretly cast a spell over all of Hyrule, one that would, at some point in time when a worthy person was born and came of age, cause the symbol of the Triforce to appear on the back of the hand of this special individual, marking him as the King’s chosen person to reclaim the Triforce of Courage.
   Soon after this, the King’s time was drawing to a close, and before he died, he confided what he had done only to his daughter,
