   Ten thousand years after the First Calamity, during the reign of

   , it was foretold that the return of Calamity Ganon was imminent. The prophecy of Ganon's return forced the Royal Family and the Sheikah still loyal to the kingdom to excavate ancient technology, in preparation to confront Calamity Ganon as their ancestors had done 10,000 years prior. They eventually recovered the mechanical army, and were able to reactivate and use them. The teenage Zelda assisted them in their research, as she still had trouble awakening her powers. King Rhoam then requested each race of Hyrule produce a Champion, and four elite warriors were selected from across the kingdom by Zelda herself:
   Mipha
   , crown Princess of the
   Zora
   ,
   Daruk

    Link
   </a>
   . The final key to defeating Calamity Ganon was the divine sealing powers of the royal family's bloodline, and the recent death of Hyrule's Queen saw this immense duty fall to Zelda. As she was now the sole bearer of this birthright, the King ordered Zelda to focus on awakening her divine sealing powers, to the exclusion of all else.

   Unfortunately, having learned from his previous defeat, Calamity Ganon created four phantom embodiments of himself representing the elements of fire, water, thunder, and wind, each tasked with corrupting and taking control the Divine Beasts, and killing the four Champions. Succeeding in taking control of the Divine Beasts and killing their Champions, Calamity Ganon proceeded to take control of the army of Guardians using his Malice, and turned the machines against Hyrule. He then destroyed

   and devastated much of Hyrule, slaughtering countless innocents. Amidst the chaos, King Rhoam was killed, and the remaining soldiers and
   Knights of Hyrule
   who survived the attack on the castle were helpless against the Guardian onslaught, and were forced to retreat to a massive citadel in
   Akkala
   . The final remnants of the Hyrulean Army took their final stand in Akkala Citadel, the kingdom's largest stronghold, which was all but destroyed in the historic battle, leaving the once great structure in ruins.

  <p key="a4e898ea-99ff-402f-b19f-5ebb1cf418e7">
   Hyrule's allies fared far better than the doomed kingdom. Ganon's attack focused squarely on the heartlands of Hyrule, and though the Guardians advanced throughout the kingdom, they did not reach the realms of the Gerudo, Rito, or the Gorons. A single Guardian ventured into

   Link and Zelda, meanwhile, were ambushed by the Guardians in
   Central Hyrule
   , and retreated south to
   Fort Hateno
   , where they made their desperate last stand against an army of Guardians. Though Link skillfully wielded the
   True Master Sword
   , which reacted to Ganon's corruption within the Guardians, and managed to take several down, there were simply too many, and he was eventually overcome. It was here, faced with the impending death of a loved one, that Zelda's powers were truly awakened, allowing her to shut down the Guardians with a blinding ray of light which purged them of Ganon's influence. Though the Guardians were stopped, Link was nonetheless greatly injured, and seemingly died in Zelda's arms. Heartbroken, Zelda wept in despair. As if responding to her cries, the

   suddenly spoke to Zelda, and revealed to her that Link could still be saved by using the Shrine of Resurrection, an ancient Sheikah medical facility her research team had discovered. Wasting no time, Zelda ordered her Sheikah allies, Impa,
   Purah
   , and
   Robbie
   , to carry Link to the Shrine of Resurrection upon the

   , and to place him in an experimental Slumber of Restoration. Zelda then returned the battle-damaged Master Sword to its pedestal in front of the
   Great Deku Tree
   , promising the blade that Link would one day return for it. In a final sacrifice, Zelda marched alone on Hyrule Castle and used her newly awoken powers to seal both Calamity Ganon and herself inside, ending the Second Great Calamity.
