    Uh, I see you over there
    Don't be shy, come here
    You got that thing that I can't deny
    So move it over here, oh, yeah
    You're giving signs that I recognize
    Say what you want, oh, yeah
    Baby, there's something about you
    Show me that nothing can hold you down
    Cause I, I must confess, I'm feeling you right now
    So baby take your chance and show your confidence
    Oh baby, tell me who you are
    You make my body scream
    You make me believe
    That you're what I'm waiting for
    Don't you be intimidated
    Just be a man, show me where you stand
    Positivity, oh, yeah, oooh
    Don't come off shy if you want me bad
    And if my e-g-o shows, oh, no, don't give up too fast
    Baby, there's something about you
    Show me that nothing can hold you down
    Cause I, I must confess, I'm feeling you right now
    So baby take your chance and show your confidence
    Oh baby, tell me who you are
    You make my body scream
    You make me believe
    That you're what I'm waiting for
    Don't you be intimidated
    B-R-I-T-N-E-Y
    (Uh, come on)
    B-R-I-T-N-E-Y
    It doesn't matter boo
    As long as you're digging me
    So much we can be (oooh)
    Yes, it's true, at first you got to make the move
    For me to see, what I want with you
    So baby take your chance (your chance)
    And show your confidence
    Oh baby, tell me who you are
    You make my body scream
    (You make my body scream)
    You make me believe
    That you're what I'm waiting for
    And don't you be intimidated
    So baby take your chance, and show your confidence
    Oh baby, tell me who you are
    You make my body scream
    You make me believe
    That you're what I'm waiting for
    Don't you be intimidated
