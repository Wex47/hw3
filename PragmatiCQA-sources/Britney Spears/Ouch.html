    Let's, let's play pretend
    Like you're my friend
    And everything is O.K.
    Then we shall begin
    To put an end
    To all the games that we play
    My body's a temple
    I'll choose who worships it
    Let's keep it simple
    No need for a big deal
    So if you're ready
    Just call me on the phone
    I'll be here waiting
    No need to be alone
    Ouch, your heart, you're burning me up
    Please don't stop, you're making me blush
    Ouch, my God, you hit my spot
    I just can't get enough of you, of you, of you, of you
    So, say how have you been
    How's your girlfriend
    It's funny you're here with me
    When you're still with her
    And I do prefer
    That we don't feel guilty
    My body is a temple
    I'll choose who worships it
    Let's keep it simple
    No need for a big deal
    So if you are ready
    Then this is what I'll do
    I'll take my time to
    You used to use me too
    Oh, you do
    Ooh, here we go
    Ouch, don't stop, you're burning me up
    Please don't stop, you're making me blush
    Ouch, don't stop, you hit my spot
    I just can't get enough of you
    Of you, of you, of you
    Do you remember?
    How we used to do
    I was your girlfriend
    We were so true
    Let's play pretend
