    (*Laughs*)
    Whoo, yeah
    I'mma just let y'all know somethin' like this, yeah
    (*Laughs*)
    Gonna break it down for all you girls out there
    You got your ass on your shoulders and you wonder why nobody ever really wanna get down and hang with you (uh, nobody really wants to go out with you)
    Cause You only hang around with fake people that barely even know you, kiss your ass, and love to agree with you (agree with you, it's all in your mind)
    You should take a look around when your down by yourself all alone and you'll see who's standin there next to you (no one but you, gonna let you know that)
    No wonder why you up and change your number every time, you are blind but you'll find nobody gave a damn but you (nobody gave a damn but you baby, damn but you)
    (Yeah, yeah) so where did you get that game
    You don't even know my name
    So who do you think you are
    You a wannabe rockstar (ho)
    So get off of your own throne (get off your own throne baby)
    Maybe you'll be alone
    By the time you hear this song
    You a wannabe rockstar
    XO, no love I'm gonna give you
    XO, oh love I never knew you
    XO, know what, I never loved you
    XO, XO, XO, XO
    XO, no love I'm gonna give you (I can't give it to you)
    XO, oh love I never knew you (I never knew you)
    XO, know what, I never loved you (nope, ahh)
    XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO
    You call every minute of the day, every second of the hour cause you're trying to come back but it's way too late (haha, that's what you said, not me)
    How's it feel all alone on your throne and the crowd is gone (*laughs*) and you're holdin on (Why you wanna hold on baby)
    So I saw you at the bar with your head up high but you're so down low and it's funny cause you don't even know (you don't even know, it's so sad, you know)
    It's sad when people, they can't even recognize, that they don't have a clue (they don't have a clue)
    You a wannabe rockstar
    XO, no love I'm gonna give you (yeah)
    XO, oh love I never knew you (yeah)
    XO, know what, I never loved you (yeah)
    XO, XO, XO, XO
    XO, no love I'm gonna give you
    XO, oh love I never knew you (knew you)
    XO, know what, I never loved you
    XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO
    I hate to break it to you (I hate to break it to you)
    But I'm not thinking about you (na ah)
    You're so wraped up (yep) in you're boys full of noise don't know, go ask all your boys then (that's really sad)
    You talk so much, but so what
    Please won't you shut yourself up (shut the fuck up) (laughs)
    So all my girls scream and shout
    If you've got an XO
    Get him right back
    Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
    XO
    Oh, oh, oh
    XO, XO
    You a wannabe rockstar
    XO, no love I'm gonna give you (yeah)
    XO, oh love I never knew you (yeah)
    XO, know what, I never loved you (yeah)
    XO, XO, XO, XO, XO
    XO, no love I'm gonna give you
    XO, oh love I never knew you (knew you)
    XO, know what, i never
    Know what, I never
    Know what, I never
    Know what, I never loved you
