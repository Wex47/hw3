    There was a time when you were mine
    There was a time when you held me tight
    But now you aren't around me
    Boy I wish you could find me, oh
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Wants you again
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Loves you, my friend
    Now you're gone, you left me
    What's a girl do, so pressed, you see
    And right when I saw the door
    You walked in and I fell to the floor, yeah
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Wants you again
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Loves you, my friend
    Every day I wake up and you're not there, no, no
    It takes too much of me, I just can't spare
    So why, tell me why, why did you go away, away
    This girls gonna be all alone, so come back to me, come back to me
    Oh, why did you go
    I feel so alone
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Wants you again
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Loves you, my friend
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Wants you again
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Loves you, my friend
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Wants you again
    This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
    Loves you, my friend
