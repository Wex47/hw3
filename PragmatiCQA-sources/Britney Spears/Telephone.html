     Hello, hello, baby, you called, I can't hear a thing
     I have got no service in the club you see, see
     Wa-wa-what did you say?
     Huh? You're breaking up on me
     Sorry, I cannot hear you
     I'm kinda busy
     K-kinda busy
     K-kinda busy
     Sorry, I cannot hear you
     I'm kinda busy
     Just a second
     It's my favorite song they're gonna play
     And I cannot text you
     With a drink in my hand, eh?
     You shoulda made some plans with me
     You knew that I was free
     And now you won't stop calling me
     I'm kinda busy
     Stop callin', stop callin'
     I don't wanna think anymore
     I left my head
     And my heart on the dance floor
     Stop callin', stop callin'
     I don't wanna talk anymore
     I left my head
     And my heart on the dance floor
     Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

     The way you blowin' up my phone
     Won't make me leave no faster
     Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
     I shoulda left my phone at home
     'Cause this is a disaster
     Callin' like a collector
     Sorry, I cannot answer
     Not that I don't like you
     I'm just at a party
     And I am sick and tired
     Of my phone ri-ringing
     Sometimes I feel like
     I live in Grand Central Station
     Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
     'Cause I'll be dancin'
