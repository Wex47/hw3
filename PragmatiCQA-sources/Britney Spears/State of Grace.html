    Love is a state of grace
    Transcending time and space
    No other way I can describe
    Insanely beautiful
    It's almost mystical
    Cause you're mine
    And I can't believe that I feel
    What I feel
    Such a strange kind of real
    Love is a state of grace
    Between you and I
    Golden, broken
    I didn't know
    One touch could open
    My body and soul
    And we've just begun
    Like the moon and sun
    We fade to one
    Love is a state of grace
    Transcending time and space
    No other way I can describe
    Insanely beautiful
    It's almost mystical
    Cause you're mine
    And I can't believe that I feel
    What I feel
    Such a strange kind of real
    Love is a state of grace
    Between you and I
    And the way
    That we feel
    Is a dream
    That we know is real
    Love is a state of grace
    Love is a state of grace
    Love is a state of grace
    Transcending time and space
    No other way I can describe
    Insanely beautiful
    It's almost mystical
    Cause you're mine
    Love is a state of grace
