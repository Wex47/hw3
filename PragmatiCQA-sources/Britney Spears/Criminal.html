     [Verse 1]
     He is a hustler, he's no good at all
     He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
     He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
     He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
     I know you told me I should stay away
     I know you said he's just a dog astray
     He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
     And even I know this ain't smart
     [Chorus]
     But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
     And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
     Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
     All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
     [Verse 2]
     He is a villain by the devil's law
     He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
     The man's a snitch and unpredictable
     He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
     Oh, I know, should've let go, but no
     'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
     And even I know this ain't smart
     [Chorus]
     But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
     And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
     Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
     All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
     [Bridge]
     And he's got my name
     Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
     So I guess it's okay, he's with me
     And I hear people talk (People talk)
     Try to make remarks, keep us apart
     But I don't even hear, I don't care
     [Chorus]
     'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
     And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
     Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
     All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
