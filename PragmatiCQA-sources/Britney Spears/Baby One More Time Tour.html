   Shortly after, she announced that the tour would start in July.
   On May 12, 1999,
   Tommy Hilfiger
   was announced as the main tour sponsor. During the time of the announcement, Spears was being featured in the "AllStars" campaign launched by the company. Hilfiger spoke about the sponsorship saying,

   "My passion for music has always inspired my designs. This year we have really put music in the forefront of everything we do. Britney represents the spirit of Tommy Jeans and of youth today. I cannot think of a better way to continue this exciting year by sponsoring one of today's hottest, young recording artists".

   future world tour
   .
   The leg's main sponsor was
   Got Milk?
   . Media director Peter Gardiner explained, "Britney is magic with teen-age girls, and that's an absolutely crucial target for milk". Spears shot an advertising campaign to be shown before her performances began.
   The secondary sponsor was
   Polaroid
   and the corporation released the
   Polaroid I-Zone
   as the official camera of the tour. Spears also used the I-Zone onstage to take pictures of the audience and further promote the product.

   Spears talked to
   CNN
   about her involvement during the development of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept.
   Spears worked with fashion designer
   Gia Ventola
   to create the costumes for her and the dancers.
   The
   proscenium
   stage was simple and had only one main prop, a staircase in the middle. The band was in both sides of the staircase and consisted of five musicians. There were also six dancers, that took the stage during interludes. The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well-known artists.
   In the 2000 extension, the stage was similar, although much bigger.
   There were many special effects, including smoke machines and fireworks that erupted during the show. There was a giant projection screen that resembled the magical mirror from
   Snow White
   . Also present was a mechanical
   magic carpet
   in which Spears sat and flew over the first 100 feet above the crowd.
   Spears was also joined on stage by eight dancers.
   She had five costumes changes during the show. The setlist consisted of nine songs, seven from her debut album and two unreleased songs from her then upcoming album,

   , ending with a smile at the top of the staircase.
   After "
   Sometimes
   ", she waved and left the stage. The encore consisted of a performance of "
   ...Baby One More Time
   ", in which Spears wore a black bra under pink
   halter
   , a pink sequined plaid mini-skirt, and black
   thigh-high stockings
   .

   In the 2000 leg, the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of
   lockers
   and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of "...Baby One More Time".
   She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform "(You Drive Me) Crazy".
   Spears briefly talked to the audience, the segment continued with performances of "Born to Make You Happy" and "I Will Be There". After a dance interlude, Spears appeared onstage sitting on the magic carpet and flew over the audience while singing "
   Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know
   ". When she returned to the stage, she performed another song from her upcoming album, "
   Oops!... I Did It Again
   ". Spears addressed the audience again before the "Who is the Ultimate Heartbreaker?" interlude, in which her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage.
   Spears took the stage again wearing a jacket and dedicated the performance of "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" to the boy.
   She took off her jacket to reveal a pair of black pants that featured a sequined red heart in the back and performed "The Beat Goes On". After two interludes that presented her dancers and band, Spears appeared onstage to perform "Sometimes". The encore consisted of a dance-oriented performance of "...Baby One More Time".

   Grammy

   Adam Graham of

Believe me, I'd give anything to do a show where I just sit there and sing".
