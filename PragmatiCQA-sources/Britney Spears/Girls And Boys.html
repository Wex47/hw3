     [Verse 1]
     Lying in bed, touching my skin
     Oh, God, I wish you weren't sleeping
     I long for your lips, to kiss me again
     Don't you know my body's aching?
     [Pre-Chorus]
     Seems we always have a little price to pay
     Price to pay, I'm falling in love
     It all starts, starts to ache
     [Chorus]
     Bad girls, and bad little boys
     Won't last forever
     But good girls and good little boys
     Will make love together
     [Verse 2]
     I look at your face, as I lie awake
     My body's slowly moving closer
     My hand on your leg
     My mouth on its way
     Oh, baby, I'll just turn you over
     [Pre-Chorus]
     Seems we always have a little price to pay
     Price to pay, I'm falling in love
     It all starts, starts to ache
     [Chorus]
     Bad girls, and bad little boys
     Won't last forever
     But good girls and good little boys
     Will make love together
     Love together, love together
     Love together, love together
     Love together
     [Bridge]
     Do you like this? I like this
     I want you alright
     Do you want to touch me?
     I like this
     Can you handle this?
     I like this
     We're going to slow it down
     Just a little bit
     I'm lying in bed, touching my skin
     I just can't take it, baby
     Open your eyes, whisper to me
     Do it again, do it again
     [Chorus]
     Bad girls, and bad little boys
     Won't last forever
     But good girls and good little boys
     Will make love together
     Bad girls, and bad little boys
     Won't last forever
     But good girls and good little boys
     Will make love together
     Love together, love together
     Love together, love together
     Love together
     [Outro]
     That's good, do you like this?
     Yeah, going to slow it down
     We'll make love together
