   "Piece of Me" was co-written and produced by the Swedish duo Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg, professionally known as
   Bloodshy &amp; Avant
   , along with
   Klas Åhlund
   .
   While recording with Spears over the years, Karlsson and Winnberg often saw first-hand how her regular activities were interrupted by the paparazzi, including one experience in
   Hamburg
   which Winnberg deemed as "really scary". For
   <i key="5309d37f-a809-4bb9-94c3-350e8219891f">
    Blackout
   </i>
   , Spears worked with them on "
   Radar
   ", "Freakshow" and "Toy Soldier". When the album was considered to be finished, Bloodshy &amp; Avant were persuaded by her
   A&amp;R
   Teresa LaBarbera Whites to work on a new track. Winnberg commented that it had always been an
   unwritten rule
   not to write songs about Spears's personal life since the label rejected "
   Sweet Dreams My LA Ex
   ", a response track to
   Justin Timberlake
   's "
   Cry Me a River
   ". However, the duo wrote "Piece of Me" with Åhlund and sent it to Spears, who loved it.
   Bloodshy &amp; Avant worked on the track at Bloodshy &amp; Avant Studios in
   Stockholm, Sweden
   , and Spears recorded her vocals at
   Chalice Recording Studios
   in
   Los Angeles, California
   .
   Winnberg stated that Spears was extremely psyched when she came to the studio, where she recorded the song in about half an hour as she had learned the lyrics by heart in her car.
   "Piece of Me" was later mixed by Niklas Flyckt at Mandarine Studios in Stockholm.
   On November 30, 2007, during a radio interview with
   Ryan Seacrest
   , Spears talked about the song, saying,
  </p>
  <p key="3b3da7da-fdcc-4bf3-9f3b-74cc24adba7b">
   "Wherever you go, there's a lot of people who ask questions, and sometimes you don't know their intentions and stuff like that. So, it is kind of a cute way of putting it out there. You know, like, 'You want a piece of me?', you know, in a cool, cute and clever way. It is a cute song [...] I like it".

   . The track consists of over-the-top vocal

   The lyrics of "Piece of Me" are written as a reaction to the scrutiny of Spears's private life in the
   media
   . They deal with
   fame
   and living under the spotlight.
   During the first verse, Spears sings the
   hookline
   "You want a piece of me?", that is repeated throughout the song. According to Kelefa Sanneh of
   <i key="8ba9ea74-5de0-419c-b7d6-aa262a1e6e6c">
    The New York Times
   </i>
   , the line "could be an accusation or an invitation or a threat".
   "Piece of Me" is constructed in the common
   verse-chorus
   pattern. "Piece of Me" is written like a biography retelling Spears's mishaps, sung in a nearly spoken manner.
   Alex Fletcher of

   The music video for "Piece of Me" was filmed on November 27 and November 28, 2007, at the nightclub and restaurant Social Hollywood in
   Los Angeles, California
   . It was directed by
   Wayne Isham
   , who had previously worked with Spears in the music video of "
   I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman
   ".
   British national newspaper
   <i key="98e2512a-45eb-4b52-9c75-6360287f2a2d">

   reported that the video cost $500,000, her most expensive music video since the music video for "

   ".
   In some scenes of the music video, Spears wore a purple satin dress from American designer Marina Toybina.
   Spears reportedly arrived twelve hours late to the set, after spending the day with her sons Sean Preston and Jayden James.
   Isham talked about the situation, saying, "She was late. People made a big thing about it, [but] how could she not be late, when you have 50, 65, 75 people running down the street chasing her car? That was a long day for the crew. It was literally a 20-hour day for the crew. She was there for the last six hours of it. She got there late, showed up and just kicked ass".
   He also explained the concept of the music video:
  </p>
  <p key="9b2b50df-9d84-4b48-920e-dd9f124ca734" style="text-align: right;">
   "On [the music video], I really just wanted to put the mirror back onto the whole experience. You can see that she had that kind of confidence. And, literally, every take became a more and more confident take, so that she could have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".

   The video begins with four blonde women changing their clothes, putting make up on and dancing in a bedroom. Outside, several
   paparazzi
   are taking pictures of the situation through the window. Spears appears in front of a multi-colored, illuminated background wearing a short brown fur vest, a sequined black bra and ripped
   low-rise jeans
   .
   There are also intercut scenes of Spears wearing a white fur vest tearing down tabloid covers and creating positive ones, such as "
   It's Britney, Bitch
   " and "Exceptional Earner". During the first chorus, Spears joins the four women, all wearing matching blonde
   bob
   wigs, dark sunglasses and black
   trench coats
   being hounded by paparazzi.

  <p key="bfd4ac34-1ca7-4eaf-9c46-90ddeafd429b">
   Then they enter a nightclub, with Spears wearing a purple satin dress.
   Spears starts flirting with a man and guides him into the women's bathroom, where she discovers he has a hidden camera in his chest. She writes "Sucker" on his forehead. There is a dance sequence until the song ends, in which Spears and the four women dance in the bathroom. At the end, the women are seen back at the bedroom watching an entertainment news program, in which the "Britney invasion" from earlier is reported. The final scene shows a close-up of Spears smirking.

   The ceremony was held on September 7, 2008, and Spears won all three categories.
   On October 18, 2008, during a live interview with New York's
   Z100
   , she explained that she was shocked when she won, saying, "It's a cool video, but I think by far I've done videos that are way better, so I was really shocked that it got [Video of the Year]. It was just inspiring, though, because now, going forward with the videos that I'm doing now, I can really go there and do something crazy and see what happens".
