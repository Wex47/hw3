    "That song was totally about him," Bell said. "It was all, let's not put it all out there. She was like, 'He'll know what we mean, but the rest of the world won't.'"

     Champagne, caviar, hot boys at the bar
     Lookin' at me, yeah, they're lookin' at me
     I was true to you, justify my point of view
     Now you're lookin' at me, yeah, you're looking at me
     They wanna give it to me, they wanna give it to me
     But I wouldn't go for that, 'cause, boy, I had your back
     This song is all about me, damn right, it's all about me (Yeah)

     I'm fickle every day
     Lookin' at me, you're still lookin' at me
