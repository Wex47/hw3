Its original name was the In the Zone Tour, but Spears was sued for trademark infringement and banned from using the name. Spears felt inspired to create a show with a hotel theme which she later mixed with the concept of an onyx stone. The stage, inspired by
   Broadway musicals
   , was less elaborate than her previous tours. The setlist was composed mostly by songs from

   The Onyx Hotel Tour was commercially successful, grossing $34 million. On March 18, 2004, Spears suffered a knee injury onstage while performing "I Got That (Boom Boom)" and was forced her to reschedule two shows. On June 8, 2004, Spears fell and hurt her knee again while shooting the music video for "Outrageous" and underwent
   arthroscopic surgery
   . Since Spears thought that continuing with the tour wouldn't be good for her recovery, the third leg in North America and the fourth leg in Asia and Australia were cancelled. In 2005, Spears sued her insurance companies for denying her a reimbursement for the cancellation.

   On December 2, 2003, Spears announced through her official website US concerts to support her fourth studio album, In The Zone (2003). The tour would kick off on March 2 in
   San Diego
   , California, at
   iPayOne Center
   . However, Spears released a statement saying, "I'm especially looking forward to bringing my tour to new markets and performing in front of fans that may not have had the opportunity to see any of my previous tours."
   On January 12, 2004, four dates were announced in
   Glasgow
   ,
   Manchester
   ,
   London
   and
   Birmingham
   , her first UK dates in four years.
   After the beginning of the North American leg, Spears announced a summer leg in the United States in June as well as a European leg starting on April 27 in London and ending on June 5 at
   Rock in Rio Lisboa
   .
   It was also rumored to visit Latin America and Asia later in the year.
   The Onyx Hotel Tour was originally going to be called In the Zone Tour. On February 17, 2004, a San Diego clothing manufacturer of the same name sued Spears for $10 million and banned her from using the trademark.
   On May 17, 2004, a hotel named Onyx Hotel opened in
   Boston
   , Massachusetts.
   Kimpton Hotels &amp; Restaurant Group
   had come up with the name two years before the tour was developed. Spears and the Kimpton group decided to promote the hotel by featuring a room named The Britney Spears Foundation Room. It was designed by Spears' mother, Lynne, reflecting Spears' personality and taste. The room opened six weeks later and a portion of the fee was destined to the Britney Spears Foundation.

   The show began with a skit where a flamboyant
   master of ceremonies
   welcomed spectators to the Onyx Hotel.
   After this, he took an onyx and threw into the video screens, causing a virtual
   chandelier
   to fall into the floor.
   Spears briefly appeared in the screens, as her dancers descended to the stage. She entered standing on top of a small bus dressed in a black
   catsuit
   , where she performed "Toxic".
   She descended to the stage for the breakdown and then performed "
   Overprotected

   1930s fashion
   . She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a corset to perform "...Baby One More Time".
   She performed Oops!.. I Did It Again" with a vintage microphone and joined by her background singers.

The show continued with another video interlude featuring a spoof of paranormal-themed shows, "The Onyx Zone", with the master of ceremonies doing a Rod Serling impression and introducing "The Shadow Room". Spears then reappeared sitting on a swing to perform "Shadow". During the performance, she was lifted into the above an M-shaped blue ribbon with performers twirling in the fabric. THer performance ended with Spears leaving the stage while her dancers perform to a ballet interlude in flesh-colored costumes. The next section began with a video interlude of two guards watching Spears in her room through security cameras. Spears then appeared on a smaller stage wearing a white rob and performed "Touch of My Hand" in a transparanet bathtub. During the performance, she removed the robe to reveal a nude body suit with crystals that resembled her "Toxic" music video otufit. She left the stage briefly to wardrobe change and reappeared on the mini platform where she descended to the main stage on a pole, wearing pink lingerie and performed "Breathe On Me" on a bed with one of her male dancers. She then put on a white trenchcoat and performed "Outrageous", the last song of the act.

   In the next act, Spears and her dancers wore street clothes and performed "(I Got That) Boom Boom". After this, she introduced her band and dancers and left the stage. The encore began with a system malfunction where a female voice counted down as the screens sketched Spears' outline, which then rose to reveal Spears at the top of the staircase. After this, "Me Against the Music" (Rishi RIch's Desi Kulcha Remix) began and Spears appeared onstage wearing a red ensemble. The show ended with Spears and her dancers on the staircase where the screen is lowered and Spears made her exit as confetti was shot towards the audience.
