    They say get ready for the revolution
    I think it's time we find some sorta solution
    Somebody's caught up in the endless pollution
    They need to wake up, stop living illusions
    I know you need to hear this
    Why won’t somebody feel this
    This is my wish that we all feel connected
    This is my wish that nobodies neglected
    Be like a rocket baby
    Be like a rocket
    Take off
    Just fly, away (ay, ay)
    To find your space
    Take off
    Just fly, away (ay, ay)
    To find your place
    Take off
    You know what they say about mixing the races
    And in the end we got the same faces
    My mama told me got love yourself first
    And if you disagree, get off this damn earth
    I want to feel connected
    Don’t want to be neglected
    This is my wish that we all find our places
    This is my wish that we all escalate (yeah)
    Be like a rocket baby
    Be like a rocket
    Take off
    Just fly, away (ay, ay)
    To find your space
    Take off
    Just fly, away (ay, ay)
    To find your space
    Take off
    Just fly, away (ay, ay)
    To find your space
    Take off
    Just fly, away (ay, ay)
    To find your space
    Take off
    Baby you'll see everything
    Hear this and you’ll want to sing
    Anywhere you wanna
    Everything you wanna
    All you will have to is be
    Think it and you can achieve
    Everything's not what it seems
    Anywhere you wanna
    Everything you wanna
    All you will have to is be
    Like a rocket
    Just fly, away (ay, ay)
    To find your space
    Take off
    Just fly, away (ay, ay)
    To find your space
    Take off, take off
    Be like a rocket baby
    Be like a rocket
    Take off, take off
    Be like a rocket baby
    Be like a rocket﻿
