   'Rebellion' was first teased way back in 2006 when Spears posted a short, fifty second snippet of the track on the main page of her website, accompanied by a very 2000's animation of her transforming into a Bengal Tiger and a cacophony of roars.

  <p key="d4af6732-cf18-4854-9da4-1f0688b59410">
   The song speaks about her rebellion against her management, This marks the second time she rebelled against the label Jive, after the release of the demo version of "

   snippet is less than a minute long, but it was later confirmed that there is a full version of the song. The full version has not yet leaked and it's unknown of it's whereabouts. Jeff Dandurand claims that he has attempted to purchase and release the track officially, even going so far as to state that he uploaded the entire song to YouTube at one point without fans noticing before being forced to take it down.

   Using Wayback Machine, a website that allows you to view the contents of a website on a specific date, it's possible to see that a full set of lyrics was actually uploaded to AZLyrics on the 24th of June, 2006, alongside an audio track that's no longer available.

   In 2019, Sam Lufti uploaded a photo on Twitter of CD's and one gold disc has "Rebell" written on it, which indicates that Lufti is the only one that has the complete song.
