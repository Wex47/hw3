    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
    Needed a fight as an excuse
    To get away from me, you've misused
    Sit there, make me look guilty
    You will leave in anyway
    But, with me
    You have a career? I can't tell
    I train you men so well
    No more boosting your egos
    Come on, you're smoking, what the hell knows
    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
    No more chains that you gave me
    Enough of pain, now I'm craving
    Something sweet, so delight
    How can you men stand sleeping at night?
    The silly pattern that I followed
    I saw my mama being swallowed
    By the one, who she loved
    He pulled her down, couldn't see up above
    Manipulation was his key
    He screwed it in, 'cause she was naive
    We're not perfect, we must say
    But, now I've got to run away
    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
    All that she wants is another baby
    She's gone tomorrow, boy
    All that she wants is another baby (Yeah)
