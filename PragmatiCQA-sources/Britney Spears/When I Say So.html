    Listen, listen
    Come on
    You read my eyes
    My vibes
    My body's pace
    Lookin' my way and I'm lookin' your way
    So heres the thing that I need
    I'll make it clear
    Now heres your chance
    But first understand me
    I ain't down for relationships
    I'm not like all them other chicks
    I just want it, when I want it
    Nothin' serious goin'
    Ain't no reason to rush in
    Nothing starts till I say go
    I don't really wanna tease you
    I don't wanna mislead you
    You'll get some, When I say so
    Uh, uh -- when I say so
    You're feeling me
    My jeans
    My baby tee
    You want it now
    But just chill
    Slow it down
    Ah
    Think you got game
    And you know
    How to play with me
    But who told you
    That this will be easy
    I might be down for relationships
    Gotta do me right to make me wanna flip
    I just want it, when i want it
    Nothin' serious goin'
    Ain't no reason to rush in
    Nothing starts till I say go
    I don't really wanna tease you
    I don't wanna mislead you
    You'll get some, When I say so (When I say so)
    (Rapping)
    You'll get some when I say so
    You'll get some when I say so
    You'll get some when I say so
    You'll get some when I say so
    You'll get some when I say so
    You'll get some when I say so
    You'll get some when I say so
    You'll get some when I say so
    Nothin' serious goin'
    Ain't no reason to rush in
    Nothing starts till I say go
    I don't really wanna tease you
    I don't wanna mislead you (ooo)
    You'll get some, When I say so
    Nothin' serious goin'
    Ain't no reason to rush in
    Nothing starts till I say go (slow, slow)
    I don't really wanna tease you
    I don't wanna mislead you
    You'll get some, (You'll get some) When I say so
    Nothin' serious goin'
    Ain't no reason to rush in
    Nothing starts (Nothin' starts) till I say go
    I don't really wanna tease you (baby)
    I don't wanna mislead you
    You'll get some, When I say so
    You'll get some when I say so
