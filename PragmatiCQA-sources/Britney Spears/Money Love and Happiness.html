    I'm about to go crazy
    I know you wanna get in my head
    I'd rather get in yours instead
    Boy you knock me off my feet
    This girl bring the heat
    Don't forget to paint the town
    I know you wanna hear my sound
    Don't try to be too tough
    Don't take this out of context
    But when it comes to be my best
    There ain't no contest
    You should know my name's synonymous
    With all the hotest hits I keep them breathless
    It's endless
    Boy rentless
    People pay me compliments (You're so wonderful)
    Boosting up my confidence
    All it takes common sense
    All it takes is money, love and happiness
    Money, love and happiness
    Money, love and happiness
    Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
    You know what they say about money
    That it can't buy happiness
    I just need to know
    Is this real or just a dream
    Hold myself in high esteem
    Picky about the little things
    Come full circles like a band of wedding rings
    Continuing living in the life of lux
    Life sometimes, I know it sucks (it's real shitty)
    Boy I'm not asking much
    People pay me compliments
    Boosting up my confidence
    All it takes is common sense
    All it takes is money, love and happiness
    Money, love and happiness
    Money, love and happiness
    Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
    Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
    Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
    All I gotta say, I wanna be in love
    I wanna run away to a place of
    Fairy land of dreams, that is where I'll find
    Everything I need to have a peace of mind, ow
    All it takes is money, love and happiness
    Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
    Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
    Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
    Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
    Money, love and happiness
    Money, love and happiness
    Money, love and happiness
    Money, love... oh
