    I wanna kisssssssss you all over
    Gimme that kiss
    Gimme that kiss
    Gimme that kiss
    Gimme that kiss
    Bet you if I kiss you all over
    You won't wanna' get rid of none of this that you're feeling
    Can't stop when you're kissing me
    Bet you if I kiss you all over
    You can tell that she'll be jealous
    We can't help it
    Nothing's wrong with kissing me
    Wish you knew that all I did everyday
    Just to keep my hands off you
    (If you, if you)
    Felt that y'all need to take a break
    She just wanna argue
    (If you, if you)
    Felt this way, can't let nobody know this, OK
    (If you, if you)
    Taste it, I'll make sure you eat every crumb off the plate
    (I need to think about it
    Cause all your eyes are saying
    That you wanna undress me)
    She must not like to drink
    'Cause if I was her I would sip on you all day
    (I will see about it
    But, babe, the problem's bigger than her you and me)
    The boy I'm currently seeing is
    6 foot 3 and too possessive
    Bet you if I kiss you all over
    You won't wanna' get rid of none of this that you're feeling
    Can't stop when you're kissing me
    Bet you if I kiss you all over
    You can tell that she'll be jealous
    We can't help it
    Nothing's wrong with kissing me
    (If you, if you)
    Drop the ball
    That might change everything I love about you
    (If you, if you)
    We should
    Call this an affair
    My kiss might hurt you
    (If you, if you)
    (If you, if you)
    (I need to think about it
    Cause all your eyes are saying
    That you wanna undress me)
    (I will see about it
    But, babe, the problem's bigger than her you and me)
    Bet you if I kiss you all over
    You won't wanna' get rid of none of this that you're feeling
    Can't stop when you're kissing me
    Bet you if I kiss you all over
    You can tell that she'll be jealous
    We can't help it
    Nothing's wrong with kissing me
    Bet you if I kiss you all over
    You won't wanna' get rid of none of this that you're feeling
    Can't stop when you're kissing me
    Bet you if I kiss you all over
    You can tell that she'll be jealous
    We can't help it
    Nothing's wrong with kissing me
