    Everyday I'm in a daze
    Looking for that someone
    And everyday I sit and kneel and pray
    Oh, sweet love, can I get some?
    So why do you desert me, baby boy
    I need your love right now
    And if you desert me , baby boy
    Don't you leave me in your crowd
    Yeah yeah yeah
    (Spoken:)
    Hey, baby, what time are you gonna' get home?
    Oh really?
    (Sigh) Alright, well...
    I'll see you later then
    Oh, wait, would you mind getting some, um...
    Yeah, when you come home
    Yeah, that's it
    Love you too
    Bye
    (Ahhh... ahhh...)
    Someday you will see my face
    And you will think that you have won
    And someday when it's all away
    I'll 've just begun
    So why did you desert me, baby boy?
    I thought that you, you were the one
    So if you preferred the other one
    She won't bring you the sun
