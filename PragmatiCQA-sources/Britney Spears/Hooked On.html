    My mama told me go on and let you go
    Said you would be more problems than I'd ever know
    Said if he's gonna go then let him go away
    But then I get the urge
    It hurts so bad (damn)
    When I feel the thirst
    It makes me mad
    I look up in my bed
    I look up and there is your face
    You love it, you love it
    I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
    You want it, you want it
    You're so good
    On a good day
    Sugarfall
    Your sugarfall
    You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
    You know you want it bad, babe
    I heard it in the streets
    You got another girl
    Yes, it did sting
    But didn't shatter my world (I'm ok)
    You should catch me now
    When I'm in a vulnerable state
    You're probably thinking to yourself
    This just aint me
    On the contrary
    I was your freak (I was your freak)
    Hit me one more time
    And trust me I'll be ok
    Hey
    You love it, you love it
    I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
    You want it, you want it
    You're so good
    On a good day
    Sugarfall
    Your sugarfall
    You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
    You know you want it bad, babe
    Now I will be a bad chick
    If I rounded up my clothes
    And headed over straight to the door
    You wouldn't have a clue
    Of what you should do
    If I left you laying longing for more
    You'd be like baby don't go (don't go)
    Baby
    Want some more?
    You want some more?
    Baby don't go (just don't go)
    Said baby please listen
    Don't you just go
    Do you lick your lips?
    When you stand alone
    Well you got no x-ray vision
    Staring through my clothes
    Are you sure that you're prepared
    For what comes serves on its plate
    Wait a minute
    Oooh, I'm having second thoughts
    See my hearts on fault
    Could you pass my shorts?
    Don't you got a girl?
    Till then
    I'm sorry, you must wait
    Especially since I know
    You love it, you love it
    I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
    You want it, you want it
    You're so good
    On a good day
    Sugarfall
    Your sugarfall
    You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
    You know you want it bad, babe
    Hey girl
    I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it)
    You want it, you want it
    You're so good
    On a good day
    Sugarfall
    Your sugarfall
    You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
    You know you want it bad, babe
    Hey girl
    You know you want it
    So come and get it
