    One more game,
    It's time to play,
    Play with me
    (One more game)
    Just one more game,
    It's time to play,
    Come play my way
    I'm no more Mrs. Nice Girl,
    No playing home ground,
    I'm not the same girl,
    You never rocked my world,
    You used me,
    Tried to abuse me,
    The fame the life the fantasy,
    Now back to reality.
    (Your dramatic)
    The truth that lies can't hide,
    I'm not by your side
    I'll let you drownd in your drama
    Run to your mama,
    See if she can save you,
    When I'm not around you
    (So dramatic)
    No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were,
    Now there's another ringing my bell,
    I'm under his spell,
    You're too dramatic,
    Understand it's over
    Baby, fuck you,
    The things you did, and never thought I'd get a clue,
    Yeah, you wanted me to be that faithful to you,
    Not let nobody's body touch my body in positions that we only knew
    (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
    Now I'm gonna give him what he wants and more,
    Do all those explicit things that I told you "No",
    Places you couldn't go,
    You know where I'm talking,
    You are too dramatic
    No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were.
    Now there's another ringing my bell,
    I'm under his spell,
    You're too dramatic,
    Understand it's over
    aww, awww, awww, awww
    aww, awww, awww, awww
    Come and play,
    You wanna play,
    Come play with me
    You're not the one I thought you were,
    Now there's another ringing my bell,
    I'm under his spell,
    You're too dramatic,
    Understand it's over
    You're not the one I thought you were,
    Now there's another ringing my bell,
    I'm under his spell,
    You're too dramatic,
    Understand it's over.
    Understand it`s over.
    (You're so dramatic)
