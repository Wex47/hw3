    Welcome to the jungle
    think it's about to rain
    light me with your thunder
    feel the ground shake
    I've been waiting for you
    up here in the wild
    and there's nowhere, nowhere to hide
    Get down with it
    be a man with it
    like an animal
    put your hands on it
    start playing with it
    start chasing it
    get a taste of it
    I can be a side bitch
    Ima let you have it
    I can be a side bitch
    Ima let you have it
    I can be all of my minds
    and that's just the way that I like
    I can do some damage
    like you can't imagine
    no one wanna save you
    I can be a savage
    I can be all of my minds
    and that's just the way that I like
    Welcome to the jungle
    here on my own
    I've been feeling hungry
    I need you alone
    I'm gonna get you nasty
    take you for a ride
    and there's nowhere, nowhere to hide
    Get down with it
    be a man with it
    like an animal
    put your hands on it
    start playing with it
    start chasing it
    get a taste of it
    I can be a side bitch
    Ima let you have it
    I can be a side bitch
    Ima let you have it
    I can be all of my minds
    and that's just the way that I like
    I can do some damage
    like you can't imagine
    no one wanna save you
    I can be a savage
    I can be all of my minds
    and that's just the way that I like
    Ooh, I wanna see you bear your teeth
    I wanna feel your body please
    Can you take this side of me, of me
    Ooh, I wanna see you bear your teeth
    I wanna feel your body please
    Can you take this side of me, of me
    Get down with it
    be a man with it
    like an animal
    put your hands on it
    start playing with it
    start chasing it
