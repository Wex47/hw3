    ; however, it was cancelled due to unknown reasons. The tour was officially announced in December 2008, with dates for American and British venues revealed. The stage was composed of three rings and set in-the-round to resemble an actual circus. Fashion designers Dean and Dan Caten created the costumes. A giant cylinder screen was set above the stage to showcase videos and backdrops. Effects were provided by Solotech. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears during the second act. The setlist was composed generally from her albums

   The tour was described as a "pop extravaganza". It was divided into five segments. The Circus featured a metamorphosis of Spears from as a ringmaster to a slave, while being surrounded by different performers. House of Fun (Anything Goes) displayed a series of upbeat numbers with different themes, including magic and military. It ended with a Bollywood-inspired performance and a ballad in which Spears performed while floating on a giant umbrella. Freakshow/Peepshow featured a video interlude set to heavy metal music, and continued with dark and sexual performances. Electro Circ displayed energetic dance routines, and the encore consisted of a video montage of Spears' music videos and a police-themed performance. Some changes were made to the show throughout the tour. Several songs were remixed; Spears also performed "Mannequin" in selected European shows and covers of Duffy and Alanis Morisette in some North American dates.

   The Circus Starring Britney Spears generated positive to mixed reception from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed it as an entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. The tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8 million. A great number of tickets were sold within a week of the tours announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest grossing tour of 2009, as well as the fifth highest grossing tour ever by a female artist. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said that a great number of fans had walked out during the performances. However, this was later denied by Spears' management and promoters.

Her singing, her dancing and even her wardrobe were all commented on extensively, and it was considered hurtful for her career In October, 2007, it was reported that Spears was planning to go on tour to promote the album and was holding open dance auditions, but this was later denied by Jive Records. In February 2008, similar reports surfaced that Spears had already rehearsed in private for a month at Millennium Dance Complex in Los Angeles, California and would be leaving to Europe during the following weeks for a worldwide tour. However, it was finally cancelled due to unknown reasons. In September 2008, after New York City radio station Z100 premiered her single "

   After her live performances on Good Morning America December 2, 2008, Spears officially announced a first leg of twenty-five dates in the US and two dates in the UK, with the tour launching on March 3, 2009, in Mew Orleans. The
   Pussycat Dolls
   were selected in October 2008 as the opening act of the first North American leg. Spears' manager Larry Rudolph claimed that the show would "blow people's minds and promises to show Britney's fans something they will never forget." He later added, "she goes full–speed the whole show — about an hour and a half. It's pretty intense. This is a full–blown, full–out Britney Spears show. It is a pop extranvangaza. It is everything everybody expects from her — and more!" On April 28, 2009, eight European dates were added. The following day, four more dates were announced in Russia, Poland and Germany. On June 9, 2009, Spears announced that she would tour Australia for the first time in November. Six dates were initially announced. Spears stated, "I've wanted to tour Australia for quite some time and now it's finally happening. My Circus tour is the best show I have ever created and I can't wait to perform it for all of my Australian fans. See you guys soon!" The following day, it was announced on her official website that she would return to North America for a second leg, visiting twenty cities. The Circus Starring Britney Spears was also rumored to reach South America, however, Spears' manager Adam Leber denied this despite their efforts to do so.

However, on December 23, 2008, the Robsons and Fuentes were replaced due to unknown reasons by Jamie King, who previously collaborated with Spears in her

   . He did the casting of the dancers and acrobats, and worked with Spears on the setlist and the choreography. King described the show saying it was "sexy, fun, explosive, and full of surprises. While avoiding such traditional circus elements as live animals, we've created something innovative and exciting using contortionists, dancers, lighting, fire and other special effects". Simon Ellis was hired as the musical director. The production design was done by Road Rage, a formed alliance between Nick Whitehouse, Bryan Leitch, William Baker and Steve Dixon. Lightning design was done by Visual Light, conformed by Whitehouse and Leitch. The stage was designed by Road Rage and set in-the-round, with a big stage in the center painted to look like a target. There were also two satellite stages in the sides unified by small catwalks, to resemble an actual three-ring Circus. The stage was built by Tait Towers and included nine lifts, which had a cost of $10 million. It traveled in 3,000 rolling cases packed into 32 semis and a crew of 150 people was needed to set it up. There was a semi-transparent Element Labs Stealth cylinder screen above the stage, comprising 960 panels that Solotech built into custom frames. The backdrops were designed by Dirk Decooedt. There were three new film sequences shot exclusively for the tour: an opening video featuring Perez Hilton, a video of Spears set to Marilyn Manson's "Sweet Dreams Are Made of This" and a final montage. The three videos were created by Veneno. Props, including swings, couches, unicycles, stripper poles, a gold cage and giant picture frames, were designed by ShowFX Inc.; they also provided custom VIP couch seating that lined the perimeter of the stage. VYV provided the video control, which included two Photon Show media servers and two Photon Controllers. The servers took timecode for the show and wrapped the images around the Stealth screen. Emric Epstein of VYV explained, "The servers and software permits us to control a large number of video layers on the 360˚ LED screen, composite the layers in realtime, and transform the final output so that everything look seamless after going through the LED controllers. There is also an astounding 3D preview of the stage and video screens in the software so you can control or re-program the show without being inside the arena bowl".

  <p key="1dabb59e-d7a4-44ae-85af-a5e72c351c8d">
   The sound was provided by Solotech. Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, "[Me] and Solotech were asked to come up with a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [Spears] expects and that we were looking for". The public adress (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Labotories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitor; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to adance club. Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods that hung in various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with scroller under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package. The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour. Pyrotechnics and jets of smoke used in the show were created by Lorenzo Cornacchia of Pyrotek Special Effects and Tait Towers.

   the album of the same name
   (1998).
   "Everytime" was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show.
   Magician
   Ed Alonzo
   joined Spears in one of the acts, and she played as his assistant. Alonzo stated, "We're going to be doing the classics of magic but a little high-tech. We'll be doing a little dissection, transposition, a vanish, an appearance — and if I do a trick, she doesn't just hold the props, she's actually getting inside the big boxes or I am slicing her up. ... Some of it's pretty scary, but she gets right in there with no reservations."
   The costumes were designed by
   Dean and Dan Caten
   from DSquared2. They recreated classic circus outfits, like
   clowns
   ,
   jugglers
   and
   trapeze artists
   in a more provocative way. They commented thaWe are enormous fans of Britney, and have been waiting for the perfect moment to collaborate with her. It's going to be wild. We wanted to create something much more provoking and indecent ... something animalistic and primal. We are confident that this tour partnership, an autobiographical tribute for one who has always been in the spotlight: scrutinized, watched, imitated, photographed, criticized and loved, will be an enormous success".
   The costumes of the first segment were selected to show a
   metamorphosis
   . The
   cheetah
   headdress
   represented an animal. The jacket and whip represented both a
   ringmaster
   and a
   lion tamer
   . She took the headdress off at the end of the first song to reveal a
   Swarovski
   -crystal corset, fishnets, and boots and entered the cage to represent a slave.
   The wardrobe for the song "Mannequin" included black
   jeans
   from
   True Religion
   and a yellow
   tank top
   with rhinestones designed by Spears herself.
   Spears's outfits had a duplicate set in case of any problem and were numbered in sequence. The total number of costumes was approximately 350, kept in order by six full–time women. The wardrobe was also revealed to have $150,000 worth of Swaroski crystals.

   The show continued with a video interlude featuring
   Marilyn Manson
   's cover of "
   Sweet Dreams
   ", showing Spears in a classically decadent party-setting, in which everyone except her was wearing
   masks
   . A distorted voice welcomed spectators to the third act and Spears appeared onstage to perform "Freakshow" and "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)".
   A video spoofing late-night chat lines featuring "Britney's Hotline" played, while clowns took a person from the audience and goofed around with them. Spears returned to perform "Breathe on Me", dancing on a giant picture frame, and "Touch of My Hand", in which she sported a
   blindfold
   while being lifted on the air sitting in the backs of two aerialists.
   In the fourth section, there was a band interlude, and Spears appeared on stage to perform "
   Do Somethin'
   ", with a gun that shot sparks in her hand.
   This was followed by a remix of "
   I'm a Slave 4 U
   ", in which she was raised on a platform as a ring of fire started below her. In the "Heartbeat" interlude, the dancers showcased their individual moves. Spears performed "
   Toxic
   " with moving
   jungle gyms
   and surrounded by green sci-fi lightning effects.
   The act ended with Spears and her dancers performing a remix of "
   …Baby One More Time
   ".
   After a brief pause, the encore began with the "
   Break the Ice
   " video interlude, which included various clips of Spears's music videos. Spears returned for a performance of "
   Womanizer
   " dressed as a
   policewoman
   .
   Spears and the dancers bowed to each side of the arena and left with "Circus" playing in the background.
   Some changes were made to the setlist throughout the tour. During opening night in New Orleans, Spears was supposed to perform a cover of
   Duffy
   's "I'm Scared" after "Everytime". However, the lyric sheet went missing onstage and she started performing from below the stage, leaving two backup singers in the main stage. It was later dropped from the show.
   "Mannequin" was added on the second Paris date and performed after "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)", with a brief lightshow introduction. The song was performed until July 26, 2009.
   A cover of "
   You Oughta Know
   " by
   Alanis Morissette
   was performed on select shows during the second North American leg, starting on September 5, 2009.
   In addition, "Piece of Me", "Radar", "Ooh Ooh Baby", "Do Somethin'", "I'm a Slave 4 U", "...Baby One More Time" and "Womanizer" were remixed at the beginning of the European leg.

   A week after The Circus Britney Spears was announced, 400,000 tickets were purchased for the North American shows, which prompted promoters to add six more dates in Los Angeles, Toronto, New Jersey, Chicago, Long Island and Anaheim.
   Due to demand in the UK, six more shows were added to the initial two, selling more than 100,000 tickets in a week.
   Spears performance at the
   American Airlines Arena
   broke the attendance record previously held by
   Celine Dion
   , with a crowd of 18,644 people.
   The first North American leg, which was sold out, resulted in an average of 20,498 tickets per show and a gross of $61.6 million, becoming the highest grossing tour of the first semester of 2009 in the continent. In addition, the tour grossed $13 million from the London, Manchester and Dublin shows, with a total gross of $74.6 million, ranking as the third highest grossing tour worldwide.
   The Copenhagen show at
   Parken
   gathered 40,000 people, Spears's largest audience since her 2002 concerts in Mexico City.
   The second North American leg was also sold out, with a gross of $21.4 million and it was reported that the tour had grossed $94 million.
   Her first three shows in Melbourne were also sold out.
   The four shows at
   Acer Arena
   in Sydney sold 66,247 tickets, making Spears the highest selling act ever in the arena.

   Before the first of the Australian shows, Minister for Fair Trading for
   New South Wales
   Virginia Judge
   , said she was aware that Spears would
   lipsynch
   during the concerts and was considering to include disclaimers on promotional materials and tickets, indicating that portions of the show would be pre-recorded.
   This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the
   2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony
   . Judge further explained her position saying, "Let's be clear – live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you deserve better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. There is a lot to see about this show, there's nothing like this in the world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for. We absolutely give them a show".
   After opening night in

   <i key="23a990b8-0ff7-46d0-82aa-b49457d1bdc5">
    The Advertiser
   </i>
   writer Rebekah Devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of the show. They were apparently "disappointed" and "outraged" regarding Spears's lip syncing and subdued dancing.
   Australian tour promoter Paul Dainty talked about the situation saying,
"It's the biggest lie I've ever heard. I'm so angry. We can take heat if there's something wrong and people can review shows badly – that's something you have to live with – but to say people stormed out of the show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, to be part of the Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".
   Spears's manager Adam Leber responded in his
   Twitter
   account, saying, "It's unfortunate that one journalist in Perth didn't enjoy the show last night. Fortunately the other 18,272 fans in attendance did". Spears's official website also posted a list of positive reviews from a number of fans.
   Burswood Dome
   also issued a statament reading, "Last night's concert (Friday) saw record crowds turn out for her first performance in Perth and from Burswood's perspective the event was a huge success. Early media reports that hundreds of fans left the concert early cannot be substantiated and Burswood has received no complaints about the concert".
   Finally, Spears addressed the situation according to
   BBC Online
   . She was quoted as saying, "I hear there is a lot of controversy in the media about my show. Some reporters have said they love it and some don't. I came to Australia for my fans".
   The negative media attention continued after her show in
   Melbourne
   when it was alleged that fans had placed tickets for the remaining Australian shows on sale on the online shopping website
   eBay
   , for as little as 99 cents. However, Dainty said that the holders of the tickets were not Spears's fans, stating "They're just profiteers. They buy tickets for $200 and think they that when the concerts sell-out they will offload them for $500".
