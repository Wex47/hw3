    Footsteps in the rain, memories wash away
    Beyond the headlight glare, it's kind of dark out there
    And everywhere I've been, it's hard to find a friend
    I've got no alibis for the state I'm in
    Everybody needs, needs a place to go
    God know's I have seen it's a twisting, winding road
    CHORUS :
    Every day, the sun comes up again
    A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
    And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
    And because of your faith, I get closer now every day
    Said every day, I said every day, every day
    It's hard to recognize, across the great divide
    Just what you left behind and what you keep inside
    A ripple in the calm, you keep my safe from harm
    Somehow you still believe, you believe in me
    Where it starts and ends, only time must know
    Wherever you will be is where I wanna go
    CHORUS :
    Every day, the sun comes up again
    A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
    And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
    And because of your faith, I get closer now every day
    'Cause you set me free
    'Cause you set me free
    CHORUS :
    And every day, the sun comes up again
    A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
    And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
    And because of your faith, I get closer now every day
