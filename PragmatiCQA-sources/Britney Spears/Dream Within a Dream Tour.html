   was the third
   concert tour
   by American recording artist
   Britney Spears
   . It promoted her third studio album
   <i key="625d197d-b1e6-4a44-9752-3550f84d43c0">

   </i>
   (2001) in North America and Japan. The Dream Within a Dream Tour was promoted by
   Concerts West
   , marking the first time Spears did not tour with
   Clear Channel Entertainment
   . On September 21, 2001, a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed. In February 2002, Spears announced a second leg of the tour. It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson, who explained the main theme of the show was Spears' coming of age and newfound independence. The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a B-Stage, united by a runway. Inspired by Cleopatra's barge, a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the B-stage. The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album, as Spears felt they were more reflective of her personality. Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson.
  </p>
  <p key="c2cb4cc9-71c2-4941-ac1f-0e15023432fe">
   The show was divided into seven segments with the last one being the encore. Spears opened the show hanging from a gyrating wheel; it continued with Spears performing a medley of older hits, jumping in bungee cords from the flying device onto the stage and dancing in a jungle setting. Most of the performances were accompanied by extravagant special effects, including confetti, pyrotechnics, laser lights, and artificial fog and snow. In the encore, there was a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage; this was considered one of the signature performances of the tour. During the 2002 leg, some changes were made; several songs were remixed, and Spears premiered various unreleased songs which included "Mystic Man". The show received mixed reviews by critics, who praised the show for being innovative but dismissed it for taking the attention away from the music.

  <p key="e715d945-f22c-4f90-b1da-1085a2eeb455">
   The Dream Within a Dream Tour was largely sold out and grossed $43.7 million. During the second show in Mexico, Spears left the stage after the sixth song due to a lighting storm; the show was canceled and angered the audience. The tour was broadcast live on an
   HBO
   special on November 18, 2001, and went on to win an Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction on the 2002 ceremony. A DVD titled Live from Las Vegas was released in January 2002.

   On July 19, 2001, Spears's band announced there would be a tour to support her third studio album,
   <i key="650878ef-7467-4a41-abd1-56580e2c18c3">
    Britney
   </i>
   (2001). The following day, Spears's label
   Jive Records
   confirmed that there was a tour planned for the fall.
   The Dream Withim a Dream Tour was promoted by
   Concerts West
   ,
   chosen after a much publicized battle with concert promoter
   Clear Channel Entertainment
   (CCE), who had handled her previous concert tours. It marked the first time Concerts West outbid CCE, with reports claiming Spears would earn between $13 and $15 million during the tour. Spears's manager
   Larry Rudolph
   commented on the situation, saying,
"Clear Channel is an incredible company, and I'm sure we'll be doing more business with them. We went with Concerts West because they're a strong touring company and because they have ancillary properties, in that [parent AEG owns] arenas and some 7,000 movie theaters throughout the country. This decision was not made to exclude Clear Channel. It was made to include Concerts West. [AEG] has the ability to help us market our core products—the album and tour—and our secondary properties—
   the movie
   — in ways that tipped the scale for us."
   On September 20, 2001, dates were released along with the tracklisting of the album. The tour was slated to begin on October 26, 2001,
   but the opening of the show was pushed back until October 31 after Spears became ill and was prescribed five days of rest.
   The tour was postponed one more day due to production delays and finally kicked off at
   Nationwide Arena
   in
   Columbus, Ohio
   .
   Before the tour began, Spears announced she planned to give $1 of each ticket to the children of firefighters and police officers killed during the
   September 11 attacks
   . She also planned to sell merchandise and auction front row seats, hoping to raise $2 million.
   On February 26, 2002, more North American dates were released through her official website to kick off in
   Las Vegas, Nevada
   at
   Mandalay Bay
   .
   The second leg of the tour was sponsored by
   Samsung
   . In conjunction with entertainment company WFX, they offered a cell-phone service that featured collectible merchandise and a membership card with access to backstage reports directly from Spears. She stated that "[the offering] is an exciting new way for me to stay connected with my fans".

  <p key="50b532e6-a168-4d3f-8fd8-a1cc6ff3f67e">
   The name of the tour was based on
   Edgar Allan Poe
   's poem
   of the same name
   .
   The tour was directed and choreographed by Australian choreographer
   Wade Robson
   . He explained the concept of the tour, saying,
"The show is gonna be really, really theatrical—it's really complicated. It's a massive show with a lot of new music. It's just gonna be really different. [...] You're gonna learn a lot more about her as a person. The show is gonna be really about how she's
   becoming a woman
   , how she's finding herself and her independence. She knows what she wants to do, she knows who she wants to be, and that's what the show's about."
   The stage was designed by
   production designer
   Steven Cohen and
   production manager
   Rob Brenner for the
   HBO
   special. Cohen designed the main stage with an
   oval
   shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said that the rest of the stage was created with three main components in mind: a
   runway
   , a
   B-stage
   , and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, "around this
   Cleopatra
   's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie
   <i key="2b028255-30d4-4b7b-9cd6-e8eaca52a5a4">
    Cleopatra
   </i>
   was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also
   high tech
   , because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." Brenner continued, "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers,
   Johnny Wright
   . The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] [He] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand
   railings
   and the floor lights and the
   MR-16
   covers. When you're doing something for TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV."
   "We had no idea the potential of the water screen, until we set it up in
   Lakeland, FL
   [the site of the tour's rehearsals], six or seven months after we decided to put it in. There had been a lot of design and technical engineering put into it before they got back to us and said they could do it. It's actually a two-part system [...] The water screen, which is up in the air, has pumps that feed the water screen that drops down. But we needed to be able to catch the water and pump it to the other set of pumps. So that was a unique challenge for us because it had never been done before. It took us about two months to see if we could get it to work. As much experience as Steve and I both have, this was an unknown entity and we weren't quite sure what we would have to deal with. [...] [It is] one of the signature items on this tour. The first time they turned it on, Steve and I looked at each other and smiled because in our wildest dreams we never imagined it would look as good as it does. When we turn on the water, there is a hush that goes through the arena. You can almost hear them whispering to each other, ‘Is that water?’ They've seen so much to this point, and a lot of the kids at these shows are at their first concert, so the
   pyro
   , the lasers, the flying barge, and the bungee—all of these effects are new to them. It's all something they've never seen before, and just when you think it can't be outdone, we turn on the water screen".
Rob Brenner, explaining the development of the water screen
   The video screens showed both live shoots and special footage directed by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video
   LED
   cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened the show was made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light
   yag lasers
   were provided by Spectra. The giant
   music box
   from which Spears emerged in "
   Born to Make You Happy
   " (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton.
   Confetti
   was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek.
   Pyrotechnics
   were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of "
   ...Baby One More Time
   " (1998), there was a water screen in which it was poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, FL) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet."

   The
   lighting
   was designed by Cohen and his partner in Steve Cohen Productions, Joel Young, who served as the tour's lighting director. Cohen continued saying, "All of our shows [are] heavily
   color
   -based—everything is rich in color. There is a lot of layering that is not confusing so the purity comes through". Young programmed the show on a Flying Pig Systems Wholehog II console, which he ran while simultaneously calling the 13
   followspots
   for each show. There were eight truss spots and five house spots: four Lycian 2.5
   kW
   instruments on the back, four Robert Juliats on the front truss, four
   FOH
   spots and one in the back." Steve Cohen Productions also served as the tour's lighting vendor and sublet the gear they required from Westsun and Fourth Phase/LSD. Syncrolite provided its own 3k lights. Apart from the Syncrolites, the rest of the lighting was a combination of Coemar and High End Systems
   automated fixtures
   and conventional luminaries. There were a total of 215 active lights.

   A week before the tour began, Spears said of the show: "I come from
   Broadway
   , so I want it to be very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical. Hopefully it will be something people have never even imagined or envisioned in their head. I was going through a run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be anything left for me to do'".
   Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in
   Los Angeles, California
   .
   The setlist was composed mostly by songs from
   <i key="c409efa5-5aa6-4ce9-adeb-470e623ad670">
    Britney
   </i>
   . She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, "I just want my fans to see me in a different light than they have ever seen me [in] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [the fans] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun." Several songs from her previous albums, such as "...Baby One More Time", were
   remixed
   by Robson to "take [them] in a new direction - flip [them] up a bit".

   The show began with a woman dressed in a 18th century white
   nightgown
   who talked to the audience briefly before disappearing. There was a video introduction in which different people told their dreams. At the end of the video, Spears appeared sleeping in a bubble.
   A platform with a wheel attached rose several feet above the ground, and she appeared strapped to it while wearing a black ensemble. She started rotating in a similar way to a
   target girl
   while starting to perform "
   Oops!...I Did It Again
   " with her dancers. "
   (You Drive Me) Crazy
   " was performed next with Spears captured by her dancers. She left the stage for a costume change while her dancers performed. "
   Overprotected
   " was performed next with Spears surrounded by laser lights. The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears, with her hair growing as the song went along. In the next section, a giant musical box was raised, and Spears emerged from the middle as a
   ballerina
   to perform "
   Born To Make You Happy
   ". She tore off her
   tutu
   and put on a long white
   satin
   cote to perform "
   Lucky
   " while
   confetti
   was shot. The
   medley
   ended with a performance of "
   Sometimes
   " for which she donned a bathrobe.
  </p>
  <p key="c899e2da-ae03-4cb4-b342-076d8ce4d184">
   She returned to the stage wearing a tank top with suspenders and pants for a dance-oriented performance of "
   Boys
   ". The show continued with "
   Stronger
   ", in which she wore a paint-covered robe and in some shows a bowler hat. At the end of the performance, she sat down next to a piano player and talked to the audience before moving into a performance of "
   I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman
   ".

   -type shows followed, showing Spears and her dancers as a struggling band.
   She took the stage again in a barge along with four female dancers to perform "
   I Love Rock 'n' Roll
   ". The barge was lifted by wires, but pyrotechnics below it made it seem as if it was lifted by fire. When it was above the B-stage, Spears jumped to it with
   bungee cords
   .
   There was a skit in which her dancers chased her before she went into a performance of "What It's Like To Be Me" in the small stage. She returned to the main stage for a performance of "Lonely", in which she danced to a video projection of herself. The dancers and the band performed the "Breakdown" interlude. In "
   Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know
   ", she sang on an elevated platform wearing an evening gown, while two of her dancers performed a routine. Artificial snow fell from the ceiling during the performance.
  </p>
  <p key="650e841d-a525-4950-9579-6ac446570595">
   After a brief interlude, she returned for a performance of "
   Anticipating
   " where she wore a patched
   denim skirt
   . The set was made of giant
   coloring book
   drawings of houses and cars.
   She removed the costume afterwards to sing "
   I'm a Slave 4 U
   " in a jungle setting while surrounded by artificial fog and laser lights, wearing a green bra top, a matching micro-miniskirt with a golden waistband and pale green boots (at some shows, she exchanged the outfit for an orange bra top, a matching micro-miniskirt and orange boots). After the song ended, she bowed and thanked the audience before exiting the stage. The encore began with a giant projection of a hologram of Spears onto a water screen. The projection gradually shrunk until Spears rose from the stage while wearing a plastic cowboy hat, blue hip-huggers, and a matching bra top. She began performing "
   ...Baby One More Time
   " in a ballad version until reaching the end of the runway.
   Pyrotechnics
   surrounded the stage while the song changed to a more uptempo version with elements of
   techno
   . Her dancers took the main stage while she returned to it running through the runway. They jumped on the barge while it was lifted into the air and continued to dance. At the end, Spears jumped off the barge with the bungee cords and landed in the main stage and descended from it.

  <p key="92e03d57-7d93-41a3-90b0-002c9c4ceebf">
   On the second leg of the tour, some changes were made to the setlist. The original mix of "Overprotected" was replaced by the
   Darkchild
   remix of the song. "Boys" was replaced by the remix featuring Pharell Williams while Spears replaced the outfit with suspenders for a black leather top. A new song called "Mystic Man" was added after "Stronger". It was described by Corey Moss of
   MTV
   as "similar to ["I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"], but with a bit more traditional
   R&amp;B
   flair, a la
   Alicia Keys
   ". The song was often replaced with "Weakness", "You Were My Home" and "My Love Was Always There" throughout the tour. Other changes included the video screens not having such a prominent role, and the backdrops of "Overprotected" being omitted.

   said the show was "dazzling" and commented that the performance did not suffer from music being its least important element, adding "This dream extravaganza perhaps unwittingly suggested that the Britney we know is herself a dream, an artist whose genius is not for singing [...] but for teasing out the cravings and fears that haunt the modern world. Ms. Spears now wants to awaken to an adult persona, but she may find that the netherworld of desire is her natural home."
