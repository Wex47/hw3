   Pilot Episodes (2 Episodes) features an aging ninja master,
   Sensei Wu
   , struggling to train four young Ninja in the ways of an ancient battle art called Spinjitzu to defeat his evil brother
   Lord Garmadon
   , ruler of the underworld, and stop him from gaining
   The Four Golden Weapons
   ,  which would make his power limitless and powerful.
  </p>
  <p key="5fe0a43a-1207-4544-8c5f-0db225bab8c5">
   Season One (13 Episodes) focuses on Garmadon's young son
   Lloyd Garmadon
   , who has released an ancient evil: an army of snakes called the
   Serpentine
   . The four ninja must stop them from uniting to unleash
   The Great Devourer
   , a large snake with the power to consume all of Ninjago and a bite that can turn the purest of people evil. Also, the Serpentine hold Lloyd as a hostage, and Lord Garmadon has agreed to aid the ninja in rescuing Lloyd and stopping the Serpentine.
  </p>
  <p key="a83d5fa3-d9ac-470e-8d77-b736ecdd1801">
   Season Two (13 Episodes) features the Ninja training Lloyd to become the chosen one destined to defeat
   Lord Garmadon
   . Meanwhile, the Dark Lord forms an alliance with the
   Serpentine
   and, with the Golden Weapons in his possession, attempts to prevent his son from fulfilling his destiny. In the meantime, several forces of evil are unleashed such as ancient pirates of the
   Destiny's Bounty
   and the formidable "Stone Army", of which the Ninja must protect Ninjago from becoming plundered.
  </p>
  <p key="e7ed13ea-2337-4903-85d0-094332c9efa6">
   Season Three (8 Episodes) features the aftermath of the final battle, with the defeat of Lord Garmadon--whom has been fully cured of his evil-- and the ninja and Lloyd at their strongest. However, an ancient enemy of the ninja returns to New Ninjago City and makes
   Nindroids
   based on
   Zane
   whom the ninja must fight to save the city. It will also feature the return of the Serpentine, and their secrets regarding the enemy's return.
  </p>
  <p key="88fe8337-0d52-4073-be42-6ca0a0c8f476">
   Season Four (10 Episodes) continues with
   Anacondrai
   cultists as the villains. New Ninjago City abandons its futuristic design for a more balanced look of old and new, in honor of the ninja who sacrificed himself in the latest battle. As they work to get him back, the remaining Ninja discover that they are not the only ones who possess elemental powers. The problem is that means facing a new enemy that has his own agenda of restarting what he began ages ago.
  </p>
  <p key="096c1346-7d53-4df2-adc9-a05e3c376160">
   Season Five (10 Episodes) continues right after the final battle from the previous season. Having just put an end to an ages-old war alongside new allies, but at the cost of Garmadon's life, the reunited Ninja discover that the war's end has also brought a new kind of enemy that is literally out of their realm. Gaining new energy forms and suits, they need all the power they can get to prevent this paranormal threat--which becomes even more dangerous when it learns their Spinjitzu art--from turning all of Ninjago's worst nightmares to reality.
  </p>
  <p key="36bc4981-90cc-4d96-9508-8370cfa87219">
   Season Six (10 Episodes) continues after the destruction of the previous season's ghoulish threat. However, just as the ninja begin to adapt to some major changes within themselves after that experience, they find themselves labelled as "Public Enemy Number One" for unknown reasons. What is worse, the cause is a mysterious djinn with the empowerment to turn anyone's deepest wishes into corrupted horrors. Now on the run, the ninja must rally whatever allies they can trust to assist in clearing their names, as well as their newest enemy and his support of sky-faring pirates set to building a new kingdom over Ninjago's ruins.

  <p key="ddf902df-b270-4708-9b92-9367afa41ff3">
   Day Of The Departed has Cole fading, and trying to get revenge on Yang. Then, Yang brings back revenge wanting villains to life from statues in a museum.
  </p>
  <p key="0f6feb35-af0b-4a1c-ab33-802fa3f47822">
   Season Seven (10 Episodes) has the ninja cleaning up the museum after the stone army ruined it. But Acronix, an evil time twin, comes back, and when Kai studies the museum, he finds out Dr. Saunders is secretly Krux, the brother of Acronix, and The Vermillion army is hiding in a hidden part of the museum. And the worst is that Wu is aging rapidly, and the army have kidnapped all the builders and are stealing all the technology. Now the ninja must get the Time Blades, and especially the Reversal Time Blade to stop Wu's aging rapidly, and they must defeat the Vermillion to get into the Vermillion lair, learn secrets about Kai and Nya's parents, and defeat Acronix and Krux, and also save the builders.

   <li key="b119ca51-b2f3-4aaf-a668-f0abb758bad7">
    In "The Surge", when the elevator opens, it's shown that Kai has two techno blades, but when the Ninja get out of Borg Industries, the second techno blade Kai had disappeared.
   </li>
   <li key="5b7d2782-5f71-4965-bbf2-69bdfcf80c1d">
    When the ninja leave the Temple of Fortitude to face the Golden Master, Zane is seen briefly doing Spinjitzu with the others, which shouldn't be possible with his energy source divided. It could have been that the Stone Warrior armor they wore acted as a power boost for him.
   </li>
   <li key="cf233acf-d695-439b-bba6-74247d6e41c6">
    When all of the ninja earn their armored Techno-Robes, Zane is the only one whose waist belt does not portray his elemental dragon's head.
   </li>
   <li key="08600878-6cee-4947-8527-572af6fe2723">
    In the ROV race for the Golden Weapons in the comet, the parasitic bugs are seen following the ninja and the nindroids. However, they disappear entirely right before jumping the gorge and then reappear when the ninja return to the spaceship.
   </li>
   <li key="71037127-6e50-421f-9876-c34fb6b01bad">
    In Borg Tower, the interactions between P.I.X.A.L. and Zane are played from a third person point-of-view. However, since they are all his and her memories inside and outside the tower, they should have been played from their eyes instead.
   </li>
   <li key="2ec1736d-6beb-4767-a1a5-d80530597b66">
    The ninja's spacesuits during their venture into space have distinct colorations in the chest area that match their elemental powers.
   </li>
   <li key="4c91e2f7-9060-4c0b-9169-9c2a217260ea">
    As P.I.X.A.L. is coordinating the returning ninja to their vehicles in "The Titanium Ninja", Jay's orb of energy before entering his is colored like Kai's fireballs instead of blue lightning.
   </li>
  </ul>

   <li key="49ccdc32-4c04-40b5-9f10-409d9b68efa2">
    Cartoon Network confirmed that Season 4 is going to premiere in February
    2015
    .
   </li>
   <li key="8edb91bb-113c-451b-93f7-75654650143d">
    This season borrowed elements from
    <i key="45cc5765-fbc4-41d9-b180-d8ad9d9369ff">
     Mortal Kombat
    </i>
    and

    .

   <li key="6dec1c3b-56b6-4d26-9cae-83ebdda36ddc">
    The first episode's ending reveals Zane in his new titanium-colored form, confirming he actually survived his fight against the Overlord from the previous season, as indicated from said season's finale.
   </li>
   <li key="d64a0876-b445-45a0-9815-5242613abf78">
    The Skulkin appear in "The Invitation" for the first time since "NinjaBall Run".
   </li>
   <li key="7b4d2eeb-dd51-46b0-ac0c-291a8e55930f">
    In "The Invitation", the classic Trainee, DX, and ZX ninja outfits appear for the first time since both the first and second seasons.
   </li>
   <li key="b7f062cc-4f86-471c-a161-16b0bba5a07d">
    The other elements aside from the ninja's fire, earth, lightning, and ice are revealed in various forms: metal, light, shadow, smoke, speed, nature, gravity, sound and amber.
   </li>
   <li key="530d8872-c6d6-4b96-9313-473ee65e7540">
    When the ninja are searching through the tunnels in "Only One Can Remain", they all are wearing gloves. However, all but Kai's gloves disappear without a trace when being chased by the cultists.
   </li>
   <li key="101f59b2-3bfe-435f-98f5-82fa91d1580c">
    In "Only One Can Remain", Kai remarks that the Anacondrai snake within the underground tunnels was the second-biggest snake he had ever seen, referencing the Great Devourer as the first.
   </li>
   <li key="7d3404d9-37f0-4436-bb79-c9ce7654ef0e">
    When Jay uses the peep hole within the passageway, he recognizes the room on the other side as Skylor's room. As Kai has not said her name to the others, this cannot be possible, unless he did so off-screen.
   </li>
   <li key="e7761adf-7b6c-4179-975a-b07cd4812d87">
    As the Titanium Ninja, Zane has his power source on his back instead of where his heart would be. Also, his voice has changed into a deeper, digital tone.
   </li>
   <li key="7147e710-ee31-423d-9c1f-a95bc2fa297f">
    The Skulkin spiders are seen in "Versus" for the first time in several seasons.
   </li>
   <li key="fcc90d53-7215-42e1-8cef-85fa5e613d1a">
    When Zane asks P.I.X.A.L. if they were compatible, her response is exactly his own when she asked herself back in "Art of the Silent Fist". Her reply may have been likely to help further boost his memory.
   </li>
   <li key="59596d6e-432f-4dfa-8c38-f877699850d8">
    Both of P.I.X.A.L.'s arms are seen in her dungeon in "Versus", but both of them are purple when it should be one. Her other arm should have been white.
   </li>
   <li key="9329cbd0-0add-402f-8964-2769bd799a58">
    When the first rounds take place in "Versus", some of the fighting contenders are seen in the bleachers as well. It is possible this error is really a time lapse; instead of taking place simultaneously, all three rounds happened one after the other.
   </li>
   <li key="ad75bbc7-15c0-4853-a419-6afcfc82fb79">
    In "Ninja Roll", Cole overhears Zane saying his new bonds were unbreakable. If this was truly the case, then he wouldn't have been able to make his way from his dungeon's far wall all the way to the door and reunite with Cole.
   </li>
   <li key="71be1720-655a-4256-b8d9-65eb30d4d7da">
    The Jade Blades were originally supposed to be the new weapons for the Ninja, but was changed when the plot changed for the Tournament of Elements.
   </li>
   <li key="9af54ab7-c254-4a3a-8c11-df7ff7ba6c33">
    During the flashbacks from "Spellbound", there is a woman shown as an Elemental Master of Water as she uses a nearby fountain to wash away attacking Serpentine and put out fires. However, no such master is present in Chen's tournament.
    <ul key="e488c972-bafa-43a4-be52-a6df9fc5a8be">
     <li key="d1d65dc1-4a2c-46fd-96f2-8a7451324e43">
      Later in the series, Nya becomes the Master of Water, and the old master is said to be her mom
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="446d169a-4ef5-4b65-9513-6ac464cdf29e">
    The Serpentine leader Arcturus, first mentioned in the previous season's "Codename: Arcturus", is revealed to have belonged to the Anacondrai in "Spellbound".
   </li>
   <li key="de1b3574-d28e-474a-858f-53b51d823d15">
    In "Spellbound", the Elemental Master to first use the flute against the Anacondrai is riding a gold-colored dragon. Since the Golden Dragon was performed only by the First Spinjitzu Master until Lloyd obtained it, the figure had to have been him.
   </li>
   <li key="2dfb6b90-7aaa-497e-ba84-74e20ff5a2af">
    In "The Forgotten Element", Zane plays and performs the same song and dance routine he did in "Tick Tock". Apart from making his friends laugh, it may have been to prove he was still the old Zane they knew.
   </li>
   <li key="53a759f3-df5e-49b6-8aa7-b20799a67954">
    Although she has absorbed the powers of several contenders, Skylor hadn't touched some others like Cole, Jay, or Lloyd, yet she was presumed to have all the elemental powers within her in "The Day of the Dragon". This could be due to either being present at each ceremony after a fighting round, or a result of her Amber power mixing with the others while in the staff's crystal and returned to her upon breakage.
   </li>
   <li key="b79fed8d-b028-479d-ba53-2cbb6a7cbc38">
    In "The Day of the Dragon", Lloyd declares that since Skylor was Kai's friend, then she was also the other ninjas' friend as well. The statement can be indirectly interpreted as Lloyd making her as the newest member of the team. This coincides with her suit's symbol meaning "six", just as Lloyd's first appearances had a green "five" on his shirt which made him the fifth member.
   </li>
   <li key="4ea20399-cbd2-4f91-a1b7-616250d9e829">
    Lloyd incorrectly mentioned the Serpentine War as the 'Anacondrai Wars' while fighting Chen in "The Forgotten Element".
   </li>
   <li key="7b5a50eb-95a6-45f5-98c6-f18762ca2d56">
    Some of the new characters in the 4th season reference some characters in Mortal Kombat (such as Gravis referencing Ermac, Chen referencing Shang Tsung, etc.)
   </li>
   <li key="2df89159-e67f-4304-a556-c5bdc5f8b9c4">
    Since being purified of evil from the second season finale to the season four finale, Sensei Garmadon has not done Spinjitzu once. Because it was the Great Devourer's venom that caused his Spinjitzu to turn dark purple (to represent Destruction), it is unknown what his tornado color would be afterwards.

   <li key="f52d68e4-b068-4fba-b4c0-3ecf1beacf30">
    Lloyd
    is confirmed too be possessed by
    Morro
    . This was apparently due to Morro believing he had been denied the title of the Green Ninja and thus possessed the rightful chosen one to accomplish this.
   </li>
   <li key="608a3402-f79d-4176-a490-44c7123baa1d">
    It was originally thought that the location of Season 5 would take place in the Cursed Realm. It was later revealed to mainly take place at the City of Stiix. Yet, it was revealed that the Cursed Realm are one of fifteen realms that exist in the TV series.
   </li>
   <li key="dff3b2ef-d151-4c00-ac0b-5d37d800fcdb">
    During the Season 5 intro,
    Sensei Wu
    is in his old robes from the previous seasons instead of his new one.
   </li>
   <li key="d04629c1-0413-48f3-b35f-43bbb95ab4bb">
    During the test to reveal the Green Ninja in Sensei Wu's story, the Dragon Sword is not seen anywhere and is replaced by a Golden Katana while when the ninja did it, the Dragon Sword was used. This could mean that even if Morro was supposed to be the green ninja, the weapons would not have reacted (though it is more likely that this was an animation error).
   </li>
   <li key="d71fd4bb-4a9a-4f1d-9258-4bdd9d87472c">
    The
    Land of Chima
    makes an appearance, in
    Curseworld, Part II
    .
    <ul key="31e83403-786b-4343-ad5a-1eaf1032d948">
     <li key="d9e2b03f-b975-41eb-96ec-936427ac1128">
      Since Chima appears in Ninjago, it might mean other LEGO themes are in their own realm.
     </li>
     <li key="3d8491ed-ced0-41db-9c2d-281d6386c163">
      This may also tie in with the upcoming LEGO Dimensions video game, in which numerous realms are discovered and explored, including Ninjago and Chima.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="fd051dd3-a3a1-4d38-b475-c825209efaa7">
    When the ninja were in the maze which is in the Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master, when the ninja looked into the walls of the maze, the ninja are seen in pirate like clothing (although Cole was not seen due to him being a ghost). So it's most likely that there was a hint of the 6th Season coming.
   </li>
   <li key="5a232386-4c09-4aa1-a1cf-eb9dff99e382">
    In the maze, the ninja witness themselves in the future, as adults: Kai has sharper cheekbones and longer hair; Zane's titanium exterior has dulled while his hair has brightened to a white hue; Jay has grown facial hair and an eyepatch, and is married to an older Nya; and Cole cannot see himself at all. It is unknown what Lloyd's fate will be, as his reflection was never seen.
   </li>
   <li key="c76b79e1-4dd8-418e-90c5-353cf5c3a750">
    Cole could not see his future self while in the tomb's maze. As Zane pointed out even ghost can see themselves in mirrors, it may be possible Cole will not survive to adulthood in the rumored sixth season.
   </li>
   <li key="2c0a1e3f-5457-4f93-a86c-17ae9f9c2b24">
    During Season 3, The Overlord said that he wanted to take over Ninjago and beyond. It's possible that he meant that he wanted to take over the 16 other realms with the Realm Crystal.
   </li>
   <li key="b8424e19-b17d-4218-ac13-60c6fe3c1da5">
    The First Spinjitzu Master makes his very first physical cameo in the episode "Grave Danger"--or his remains, at least.
   </li>
   <li key="a2d9adc9-f587-4623-b148-cb391b6d26db">
    Nya unlocks her true potential as the Elemental Master of Water in the final episode "Cursed World, Part 2". Fittingly, her NRG form is a whirlpool of aquatic energy, much like the traditional Spinjitzu tornado.
   </li>
   <li key="7917e9c7-7f2a-4493-975e-dd18b73a66a7">
    When Nya Unlocked her true potential, it would have been physically impossible for Cole to have survived, since it had seemed like it was pouring rain around the boat
   </li>
   <li key="03f64320-4aa6-45d8-88cd-920c826e320a">
    The Sword of Sanctuary may have been the very weapon wielded by the First Spinjitzu Master when battling the Overlord: in flashbacks from the second season, he is seen holding an unknown sword while creating Ninjago and facing the Overlord; and he may have used the sword's future-telling ability to create the pictures lain on the Temple of Light's walls, and thus sealing the prophecy of the Green Ninja and his guardians.
