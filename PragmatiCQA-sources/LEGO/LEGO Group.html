   When the Mall of America opened in
   1992
   , one of its premier attractions, next to the Camp Snoopy amusement park, was the LEGO Imagination Center (LIC). A second LIC opened at the Downtown Disney at Walt Disney World. A LIC is a large LEGO store with displays of LEGO sculptures as well as a play area with bins of bricks to build with; they offer a large selection of LEGO sets for sale, including sets which are advertised in LEGO catalogues as "Not Available In Any Store."

   October
   2002
   saw a significant change in LEGO Group's direct retail policy with the opening of the first so-called "LEGO Brand Store" in Cologne, [Germany. The second, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, followed very quickly - several dozen more opened world-wide over the next few years, and most of the existing stores have been remodelled on the new "Brand Store" template. One of the distinctive features of these new stores is the inclusion of a "Pick-A-Brick" system that allows customers to buy individual bricks in bulk quantities. How a customer buys LEGO at a Pick-A-Brick is quite simple; Customers fill a large or small cup or bag with their choice of LEGO bricks from a large and varied selection and purchase it. The opening of most of these stores, including the
   2003
   opening of one in Birmingham's Bull Ring shopping centre, have been marked by the production of a new, special, limited edition, commemorative LEGO DUPLO piece.

   The LEGO Group began in the workshop of

   , Denmark. Ole Kirk started creating wooden toys in
   1932
   , but it was not until
   1949
   the famous plastic LEGO brick was created.

   The company name
   <i key="c2fdfec4-deda-4511-9097-ed15a9531ab9">

   was coined by Christiansen from the Danish phrase
   <i key="dd98122f-8205-4562-8d10-ffad5775e14d">
    leg godt
   </i>
   , meaning "play well." The LEGO Group claims that "LEGO" means "I put together" or "I assemble" in Latin, though this is a rather liberal translation.

   obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced by the company Kiddicraft via a London-based injection moulding equipment manufacturer which was interested in developing its equipment sales in Denmark. The initial response from Mr Christiansen was skeptical, but the company produced the Kiddicraft bricks and said "you could be making these rather than your wooden toys." The name London Injection Moulders appears beneath early Kiddicraft bricks. These "Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks" were designed and patented in the UK by Mr. Hilary Harry Fisher Page, a child psychologist, who in 1957 took his own life without receiving any major benefit from the global fame of his invention.

  <p key="18b94b5f-6159-48cc-885a-ff26d646729a">
   In
   1949
   , LEGO began producing similar bricks, calling them "Automatic Binding Bricks." These bricks, manufactured from cellulose acetate, were developed in the spirit of traditional wooden blocks that could be stacked upon one another; however, these plastic bricks could be "locked" together. They had several round "studs" on top, and a hollow rectangular bottom. They would stick together, but not so tightly that they could not be pulled apart.
  </p>
  <p key="54cf7efd-efd3-4db8-8327-548760ddb1ca">
   The use of plastic for toy manufacture was not highly regarded by retailers and consumers of the time. Many of the LEGO Group's shipments were returned, following poor sales; it was thought that plastic toys could never replace wooden ones.
  </p>
  <p key="3abb77d1-37ec-4de9-8900-aeba3654bb9d">
   By
   1954
   , Christiansen's son, Godtfred, had become the junior managing director of the LEGO Group. It was his conversation with an overseas buyer that inspired the idea of a toy system. Godtfred saw the immense potential in LEGO bricks to become a system for creative play, but the bricks still had some problems from a technical standpoint: their "locking" ability was limited, and they were not very versatile.
  </p>
  <p key="232795f7-55c4-4b5a-bd4c-37fcee248888">
   It was not until
   1958
   that the modern-day brick design was developed. The bricks were improved with hollow tubes in the underside of the brick. This added support in the base, enabling much better locking ability and improved versatility. That same year, Ole Kirk Christiansen died, and Godtfred inherited leadership of the company.
  </p>
  <p key="b63546ca-3f13-44d2-b138-cd7a1045e53a">
   In
   1963
   , the material used to create LEGO bricks, cellulose acetate, was dropped in favor of more stable acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or ABS plastic, which is still use today. ABS is non-toxic, less prone to discolouration and warping, and is also more resistant to heat, acids, salt, and other chemicals than cellulose acetate. LEGO bricks manufactured from ABS plastic in 1963 still hold most of their shape and colour 40 years later, and still neatly interlock with LEGO bricks manufactured today.
  </p>
  <p key="665174c2-c8aa-46e7-9315-f15e7448a008">
   Over the years many more LEGO sets, series, and pieces were created, with many innovative improvements and additions, culminating into the colourful versatile building toys that we know them as today.

   Since the expiration of the last standing LEGO patent in
   1988
   , a number of companies have produced interlocking bricks that are similar to LEGO bricks. The toy company "Tyco Toys" produced such bricks for a time; the greatest rival is "Mega Bloks". These competitor products are typically compatible with LEGO bricks, and are marketed at a lower cost than LEGO sets.
  </p>
  <p key="1e55c703-37b4-4ada-9d3c-f8f97e4ba574">
   One such competitor is Coko, manufactured by Chinese company Tianjin Coko Toy Co., Ltd. In
   2002
   , LEGO Group Swiss subsidiary InterLEGO AG sued the company for copyright infringement. A trial court found many Coko bricks to be infringing; Coko was ordered to cease manufacture of the infringing bricks, publish a formal apology in the

  <p key="978bea71-01b8-4a99-98a7-c845580758b4">
   In
   2003
   LEGO Group won a lawsuit in Norway against the marketing group Biltema for its sale of Coko products, on the grounds that the company used product confusion for marketing purposes.

  <p key="c28260ef-2bee-4e76-8ecf-830cfcf56f76">
   Also in 2003, a large shipment of LEGO-like products marketed under the name "Enlighten" was seized by Finland customs authorities. The packaging of the Enlighten products was similar to official LEGO packaging. Their Chinese manufacturer failed to appear in court, and thus LEGO won a default action ordering the destruction of the shipment. LEGO Group footed the bill for the disposal of the 54,000 sets, citing a desire to avoid brand confusion and protect consumers from potentially inferior products.
