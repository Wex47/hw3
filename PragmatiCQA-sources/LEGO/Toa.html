   </a>
   Masks that provide them with additional abilities. Like most of the other beings of the BIONICLE universe, Toa are biomechanical in nature, having both organic and inorganic components.
  </p>
  <p key="2de4235f-f470-484a-89de-eb1e40b9dc86">
   Besides physical attributes, each Toa has a specific destiny, a special purpose that they must try to fulfill. Most also hold to a moral code that upholds justice and keeps one from killing opponents; those who betray such codes are no longer considered "Toa".
  </p>
  <p key="86cab80b-cf30-486a-89bb-5df6b471f570">
   Toa traditionally work in teams of six, with each member controlling a different element: so far the typical team contains one Toa each from the elements of Fire, Water, Air, Stone, Earth, and Ice. However, there are exceptions to both rules: some Toa have been known to work alone at times while others have banded together in groups as large as hundreds when needed; and Toa of other elements such as Light, Sonics and Magnetism have been known to exist.
  </p>
  <p key="9aaaa7b9-7dc5-4940-a6fc-cd64dc11d8c9">
   In general, Toa are transformed members of the
   Matoran
   race (though some early Toa were created simply as Toa, never existing as a Matoran beforehand). After achieving his destiny, a Toa can be given the option to give up his power for some greater good. If he does so, he becomes a Turaga elder.
  </p>
  <p key="02283fed-cc7c-4961-8377-e7bb3a75e0a2">
   There were once as many as 3,000 Toa in existence, but as of the time of the Toa Inika their numbers are down to 50.
   The Toa Hagah have since returned to active service, raising this number to 56. Currently, after
   Matoro's
   death and Toa Krakua's existence in the story, the number remains 56. This number may or may not include "Toa" Mata Nui, who is not a proper Toa.

   Toa are best known for their elemental powers, allowing them to have tremendous control over the element they represent. This includes creating the element out of nothing, absorbing it into themselves, and manipulating it in almost any shape or form. However, this manipulation uses up elemental energy, and a fatigued Toa must wait for it to recharge before elemental powers can be used again.
  </p>
  <p key="dd0867b6-0b14-4b7e-bb32-4d459850ef3d">
   Separate from elemental energy is Toa energy, which is not rechargeable. It is this energy that is given up when a Toa becomes a Turaga, though a Toa can use small amounts before then with no ill effects. The effects of Toa energy are vaguely defined, though it has been seen to unlock Toa powers in Matoran (via Toa stones), heal injury and poison, and awaken from a coma.

   Each Toa is also equipped with a Great
   Kanohi
   Mask that grants them an additional power (though Toa are also able to master the Noble Kanohi Turaga wear). While a Toa can have multiple masks stored away in a Toa Suva (shrine) that they can switch at will for a variety of powers, most Toa only have one mask that they wear constantly.

  <p key="0f8f138c-490a-415a-a462-8763ca7784ab">
   Toa are also equipped with personal tools, which can be melee weaponry or even ranged weaponry. Since the Toa stand against using these tools to kill living beings, they are most often used to focus elemental powers. Several tools can be used in alternate modes that help with transportation; for instance, a disk launcher can be used as a
   jetpack
   , and blades can be worn as ice skates.

   According to series writer
   Greg Farshtey
   , when Matoran become Toa they subconsciously pattern their armor style after their idea of what Toa armor looks like (barring any outside influences on the transformation). This reasoning is meant to explain why Toa Takanuva takes after the Toa Nuva, and why the Toa Metru have similar armor to Toa Lhikan.
   (The Toa Inika would have had Nuva-style armor, but it was altered as one of several side effects of their unique transformation.)

  <p key="c0cc8585-6313-4965-996f-877f58d3ef56">
   A few teams, such as the Toa Nuva and Toa Hagah, wear metallic-coloured armor in addition to that which is built into their bodies; in the Hagah's case, at least, this denotes an elite status.

   Three Toa can merge into a single being called a "Toa Kaita". Toa Kaita have the combined elemental and mask powers of the individual Toa. However, Toa cannot stay merged for very long, because keeping three personalities in sync can be mentally taxing.

   So far, only the Toa Mata have been seen to form Toa Kaita, and they retained this ability when they became Toa Nuva. No other team has been known to even attempt such a fusion, although they are capable of doing it.

Once they were rescued by the local Matoran, they recognized that this mission rightfully belonged to the Toa Inika and gave them their blessing to go forward. They are now pursuing a new mission of preparing the world for Mata Nui's eventual awakening. Recently, they arrived on the island of Artakha and received new armors called Adaptive Armor, which shapeshifts automatically to fit the environment the wearer's in. They then set off to Karda Nui, aka the Universe Core, in an attempt to stop the Makuta who invaded the land, and to retrieve the fable Kanohi Ignika, the Great Mask of Life.
