   In 1905, 14-year-old Ole was apprenticed to his older brother, Kristian Bonde Christiansen to learn carpentry.
In 1911, Ole left Denmark to work abroad as a carpenter, first in Germany, then in Norway.
In 1916, Ole returned to Denmark and, using his savings, bought the
   Billund Maskinsnedkeri og Tømreforretning
   (The Billund Carpentry Shop and Lumberyard). Around this time, he married
   Kirstine Sörensen
   , whom he met in Norway and they soon started a family. They had 4 children: Johannes Christiansen (b.1917),

   were playing in the shop and set fire to some wood shavings with a glue smelter. The shop and the house burned to the ground. Undaunted, Ole had an architect draw up plans and built a new, larger building. The new building was much larger than he could afford so Ole and his family lived in a single apartment next to the shop in the back and rented the other rooms out. The building, which would be known for its large dormer and two lions flanking the front door, is now part of the LEGO Group and is one of only a few of Ole’s buildings that still exist.

   The Great Depression reached Denmark in 1930; agriculture was the first sector to be hit and the effect was devastating for the farmers around Billund. As orders for new work dwindled, Ole struggled to survive. With virtually no new construction work, Ole turned to making small household items that farmers could afford, such as trestle ladders, step ladders, ironing boards, stools, Christmas tree stands and small toys.
In the middle of the Great Depression, Ole continued to make small household items and
   Wooden Toys
   . The same year,

   began working with his father in the business, and the two expanded their line of toys; the
   1932
   price list shows no less than 28 different designs. Ole’s first wood toys were large and simple in construction. His first designs included mostly vehicles, ferries, airplanes and buses, such as the massive 6 Hjul Rutebil (6-wheeled bus). Although simple in design, the toys were finished impeccably and built with the same quality that Ole made furniture. Wood, typically birch, was brought in from the forest and air-dried for two years, then kiln-dried for three weeks. The assembled toys were sealed, sanded, primed and finished with three coats of paint.
In 1932, Kirstine died, leaving Ole to raise their four sons alone.

   — With toys now the primary focus of the business, Ole held a contest for a new name. He chooses his own entry:

   .
The next series of designs, from around
   1935
   , included a number of animal models, including the classic pull-along
   LEGO Duck
   .These designs were more complex and often required jig work from a pattern; a pattern that Ole would carefully draft himself. The animal models were produced until
   1958
   . Over time, Ole expanded the range with more, and more complex, wooden designs. By the
   1950s

    Kiddicraft
    brick. The studs on the bricks were also flattened on top.
