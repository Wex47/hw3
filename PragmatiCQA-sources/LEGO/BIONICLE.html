   The LEGO Company's financial state was poor during the late 1990s, and decided that a LEGO theme with a storyline would appeal to children. Their first attempt to do so was the

   The BIONICLE line was originally to be titled “

   ,”
   and its first year was intended to end with the Great Spirit awakening. However, the storyline was changed to last seven years without the Great Spirit awakening, and two years following that. A major influence was Bob Thompson, the leader of the BIONICLE story team, who changed the names of the six main protagonists from Axe, Blade, Flame, Kick, Hook, and Claw to
   Lewa

   Kopaka

   Tahu

   A notable fact about the year 2002 is that the Maori people, angered at LEGO’s lack of respect for some of their words, sued the LEGO Company and won.
   As a result, many characters’ names were changed (i.e.,
   <i key="907b80d8-0962-473d-bd51-5e99d48cb6e3">
    Maku

   was changed to

   , etc.). LEGO used this to bring about the idea of the Naming Day Ceremony, where brave Matoran receive longer and better names, though they are still pronounced the same. Takua, who had saved all six of the villages, was not  renamed, so he had his own private “ceremony” where he renamed his Ussal Crab from Puku to Pewku. The villagers, originally referred to as Tohunga - after the Maori word for expert or wise man - were also renamed as Matoran.

   The main feature introduced in this year were the
   Masks

Special masks packs included gold and silver Kanohi. The Kanohi masks were attached to the face by an irregular knob, making them easy to take off. In this way, the characters could aim to hit the mask off their opponent. The canister lids of the Toa Mata had axle holes to hold the Toa faces, holding a maximum of six Kanohi plus one in the center.

By leaving the headplate open and pressing the lever, the Bohrok could launch its Krana at an opponent. The Krana could be fitted on a figure’s head in the same way as a Kanohi. The Bohrok were also capable of rolling into a ball, and with the help of a special peg, each Bohrok could be hung up inside its oval canister. The label on the canister would then be peeled off to reveal the hanging Bohrok inside. The Bohrok were accompanied by the smaller
   Bohrok Va
   , similar in size to the Turaga, and packed in boxes. They carried dormant forms of the
   Krana

   At the end of the year, the
   Toa Nuva
   , transformed forms of the Toa Mata, were introduced. They wore silver armour and larger, more organic-looking masks, which did not come off the Toa’s faces as easily. They wielded silver modifications of their former weapons; for example,
   Toa Mata Gali’s
   hooks transformed into water axes. Their canister lids had new designs and could be stacked. They also had axle holes in the lid, as they did in 2001.

   packs
   . They had different powers and power levels, depending on their colour and their pattern. The Rahkshi containers were triangular and could be stacked. The lids featured niches and holes to fit all six types of one Kraata in it. There were up to forty-two Kraata variations.

   In 2004, the form and shape of the Toa and Matoran changed entirely.  The
   Toa Metru
   were larger, used almost entirely different pieces, and had new weapons and new masks. One of the most notable changes was a new head with a ball-joint, that could attach to any masks except those from before the Toa Nuva (and the later Toa Inika). Adapting the Rahkshi's leg design with its poseable knees, the Toa Metru's whole leg was built upon ball-and-socket design, with a new double-sided upper-limb element. In addition to poseable knees, the Toa Metru had poseable elbows as well. The canisters of the Toa were round, having screw lids. By combining two lids a

   The Matoran came in small boxes. They wore remakes of the 2001 Turaga masks, but with new colors, and had larger bodies. They were the first BIONICLE set wave to have a uniform weapon, called the Kanoka Disk Launcher, which fired
   Kanoka Disks
   , similar to the Bamboo Disks of the 2001 Matoran and the Disks of the
   Slizers (or Throwbots)
   . The Kanoka Disks, which came in an ammunition pack called
   8613 Kanoka Disk Launcher Pack
   , had a three-digit code printed on them which indicated the origin, the ability and the power level of each disk.

Their secondary weapons were staffs with special powers they could inflict on their targets. The arms could rotate with a wheel on their backs similar to the Rahkshi. The Vahki sets also included Kanoka Club codes to enter on BIONICLE.com, printed on a cardboard piece. Their canisters were triangular, with a transparent lid in their respective colour.

The Rhotuka spinners had a code consisting of Matoran letters and numbers to enter on BIONICLE.com as a Kanoka Club code. The canisters of the Toa Hordika were nearly round, having the appearance rivets on the side. The lid was screwed onto the top of the canister, and had space to hold two Rhotuka.

Each Toa Inika's primary weapon was a strobe-light tool which glowed either red, blue or green and could be activated by pressing a small black button on the side. Each set came with removable batteries for the tool. The head of Toa was designed with a rubber mask, and could not accept any other mask. The lids of the Inika canisters were two-piece: the bottom piece could hold the four Zamor spheres and the strobe-light weapon, while the top piece fastened everything into place.

   Five titans were also released in 2006, all of whom guarded the Mask of Life. Two of them were Axonn and Brutaka, friends who had turned enemies. Axonn was dark red and silver and carried a double-bladed axe. Brutaka was dark blue and gold and carries a double-ended sword. Three of the titans guarded the cave to the Mask of Life. One was Umbra, based on the Latin word for shadow. Another extremely rare titan, named Irnakk, and had a golden spine with golden Zamor Spheres. Another titan set included Vezon and Fenrakk. Vezon wore a Piraka-like mask with a version of the Mask of Life fused to the back of it and carried the Staff of Fusion. The Vezon and Kardas set, including pieces from Axonn, Brutaka, and Vezon and Fenrakk, made up one of the largest BIONICLE characters yet seen, the 14-inch-tall Kardas Dragon.

   Midak Skyblasters

The Toa, as well as the Makuta, carried Nynrah Ghost Blasters, which shot rubber projectiles in either lime green or silver. The Makuta were released as a mutated form of their original selves, but they too wore Kanohi masks, although mutated into insectoid forms. The canisters of the six Mistika featured a lid with a Kanohi Ignika on the side.

   , the
   Protectors
   were released. They were the elders of each village, similar to the
   Turaga
   . They were sold in canister-like carton boxes that can be stacked above the Masters' boxes. Each came with a
   Skull Spider
   , a unique melee weapon, a special mask with joints that are now where the figure's 'ears' would be, and a rapid-fire stud shooter that was previously used in the

   line. At the same time, the Toa or Masters were released in larger boxes. They also each came with a Skull Spider and a golden version of their elemental mask. They have the size of the XL Hero Factory figures and 2-in-1 weapons, like the Toa Nuva had. Also, Tahu, Pohatu, and Kopaka have alternative melee weapons, since their weapon's secondary function is a mode of transportation. One of the major antagonists, the
   Lord of Skull Spiders
   was released as well. It isn't humanoid like the rest, and includes an exclusive Golden Skull Spider mask.

   In August, the
   Skull Creatures
   were released. There were 4 of them and they were sold in boxes. They have unique armor, limbs, masks and weapons. They come with half gold, half transparent variations of the Toa masks, symbolic of the fact that they can drain the elemental powers from even the uniquely powerful Golden Masks. Also, a large boxed set was released,
   70795 Mask Maker vs. Skull Grinder
   . It included the Mask of Creation, the mask the Toa searched for, Ekimu the Mask Maker and Kulta the Skull Grinder.

   In the second year, new versions of the Toa were released, similar to the original line, along with the Elemental Creatures. Five of each Uniter and Creature sets came in separate boxes, while
   Kopaka
   and
   Melum
   were in a single pack. A play feature of this line involved the Elemental Creatures being able to attach to their respective Toa, each of whom also came with standard and gold versions of their new masks; the Creatures also came with
   Shadow Traps
   enemies. This line also featured a set for the shadow hunter Umarak, who came with a Shadow Trap and a unique mask as well as the Mask of Control. Also, the pieces are completely redesigned and a new gear function found in the Toa and Umarak allows them to turn the waist, something that was impossible in previous BIONICLE sets.
  </p>
  <p key="1490e0f3-b746-46bd-9f7a-4dfc8afe8651">
   The summer line featured five boxed sets of varied sizes. The sets depict Ekimu and Umarak in new, larger forms; Ekimu comes with a new version of the Mask of Creation as well as a differently colored version of Umarak's mask from the winter wave. The other three sets depict the
   Lava Beast
   ,
   Quake Beast
   , and
   Storm Beast
   , who each come with recolored versions of masks from three Toa: Tahu, Onua, and Kopaka, respectively. This would be the last wave released in the second generation of BIONICLE.
