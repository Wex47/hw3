Anakin's head piece had simple black printing for his eyes and mouth, along with brown printing for eyebrows and freckles. This variant also had a light grey helmet piece with dark grey goggles. Also released in 1999 was Anakin's first pilot variant in the set

   . This time around, the minifigure was based on Anakin when he was about ten years older as a Jedi Padawan. The Episode II version had plain brown legs, along with a brown torso piece. This printing of the torso was black to show lines in Anakin's Jedi tunic, but also to reflect the colour of his leather tabard. White was also used at the top of the torso to show some of the inner tunic. A brown Padawan's braid was printed on the figure's top right side of the torso. The head had black printing on it for Anakin's eyes and mouth, and brown for the eyebrows. The accompanying hair piece was
   Nougat
   -coloured. Accessories for this version of Anakin were a blue-bladed lightsaber with a shiny silver hilt, and in the
   7113 Tusken Raider Encounter
   , Anakin also came equipped with a brown cape.

   . The most common of these variants was one which depicted Anakin as a Jedi Knight in his starfighter, which was included in a total of four sets (two of them being co-packs). This variant of Anakin featured black legs with a black torso piece with brown printing to represent the Jedi robes Anakin wore at the time. The right hand was black, representing the glove Anakin wore over his mechanical hand, and the left was flesh-coloured, due to the decision to change the skin colour of licensed minifigures from yellow to flesh in
   2004
   . The head piece was also flesh-coloured, with black printing for the eyes and the mouth, which for the first time is unsmiling. Other printing includes small marks to show scars on Anakin's face, and shiny gold printing is used on the right side in the shape of a
   headset comlink
   which Anakin commonly wore in space battles. A Nougat hair piece was also used on this variant which is longer than the hair on previous versions, and once again, Anakin came equipped with a blue-bladed, shiny silver-hilted lightsaber. A figure almost identical in appearance was also released in the
   7257 Ultimate Lightsaber Duel
   , except it was in light-up lightsaber form, this figure being one of the first of its kind. Light-up Lightsaber figures are different in that their head piece is not removable from the torso, and they do not possess a right hand. Instead a lightsaber hilt is moulded onto where the hand usually is, and when the head is pushed down, the lightsaber lights up. Another difference in this variant from the previous is that there was no headset printing on the face, and Anakin also had a black cape.

   The final 2005 appearance of Anakin
   was in the
   7251 Darth Vader Transformation
   , where the torso and leg pieces were identical to the Jedi Knight variant. The difference in this version was that it depicted Anakin after he had fallen into lava on Mustafar, so while he retained the same printing for the eyes and mouth, he had red printing in several places to show facial burns. This figure also lacked a hair piece, to reflect the fact that it had all been burnt off.

The leg piece was tan and was a shorter, immobile leg piece, making the minifigure shorter than a standard minifigure. The head piece had larger-than-usual black eyes printed on, along with a mouth, eyebrows and freckles. The hair piece was sand-coloured and covered a large amount of the head (this piece is probably most well-known as being used for
   Harry Potter
   ).

   In the second half of 2010, the set
   8096 Emperor Palpatine's Shuttle
   was released, which contained a new Anakin figure.
   The figure once again depicted Anakin after he had fallen into lava on Mustafar, though this variant differed in many ways from the original. The figure had a black leg piece and the torso was primarily black, with printing for the belt and other lines for the tunic. However, the tunic was burnt in several places, with skin darker than the normal flesh-colour, representing burnt skin, showing through the holes. The right arm and hand were black, while the left maintained the burnt skin colour. The head piece also has this colour, with printing on it for burns (in dark red), and printing for the face to give the figure a pained expression. The eyes were black dots as usual, but with white dots inside them, a common practice for minifigures which began at around
   2010
   . This minifigure came with a red-bladed lightsaber with a chrome silver hilt, and also with a black

   at the beginning of the race, Anakin managed to win the Boonta Eve Classic. Qui-Gon got the required parts from Watto, and also informed Anakin that he was no longer a slave, due to another bet made by Qui-Gon of which Anakin was not aware.

   took him to meet the Jedi Council and asked them for him to be trained as a Jedi, his strong connection in the Force being a major reason as to why he was able to win the Podrace. The Council denied Qui-Gon's request due to Anakin being what they felt was too old to begin the training. When the Queen decided to go back to Naboo to fight for the planet's freedom, Anakin once again accompanied her, Jar Jar and the Jedi on the journey.

   On Naboo, a battle ensued, which resulted in Anakin hiding in the cockpit of a

   Ten years later, Anakin and his Master Obi-Wan were ordered by the Council to act as bodyguards to now Senator Padmé Amidala after a recent failed assassination attempt. Not long after they began their duties, another attempt on Padmé's life was carried out. Anakin saved Padmé from two kouhuns, while Obi-Wan grabbed onto the hovering courier droid which deployed the venomous insects, hoping it would lead him to whoever sent the droid to Padmé. Meanwhile, Anakin commandeered an airspeeder to catch up to Obi-Wan.

Anakin leaped out of the speeder and landed on Zam Wesell's speeder, while Obi-Wan took over flying the speeder. Anakin began to cut through the speeder cockpit, but dropped his lightsaber. However, Zam's speeder was damaged and crashed, causing Anakin to fall off. Zam escaped the wreckage and entered a nearby cantina. Anakin and Obi-Wan followed suit after Obi-Wan returned Anakin's lightsaber which he caught. The pursuit ended with Zam attempting to kill Obi-Wan, only to be defeated by the Jedi. Obi-Wan and Anakin took Zam outside the cantina and attempted to interrogate her, but before she could reveal any important information, she was killed by a toxic dart, fired by

   Following these events, Anakin was ordered to escored Padmé back to her homeworld of Naboo and protect her from any assassination attempts. Some time after the two arrived on Naboo, Anakin began dreaming that his mother, Shmi, was in danger. So, Anakin and Padmé then travelled to Tatooine in search of her. Anakin soon discovered from Watto that his mother had been freed by Cleigg Lars, whom she soonafter married. Travelling to the Lars homestead, where he met Cleigg, his son

   After recieving a distress call from Obi-Wan on Geonosis, Anakin, Padmé, R2-D2, and C-3PO travelled there to rescue him, but soon found themselves captured as well. After escaping from his chains and defeating several squads of droids with the help of a Jedi strike team, Anakin participated in the Battle of Geonosis and fought Count Dooku alongside Obi-Wan, but lost half his right arm in the duel. Following Dooku's escape, Anakin married Padmé in a private wedding ceremony.The newly-Knighted Anakin would then fight in several battles in the Clone Wars alongside his new apprentice
   Ahsoka Tano

   Three years into the war, Anakin went on a rescue mission with Obi-Wan to save Chancellor Palpatine, who had been abducted from Coruscant by General Grievous. In this, Anakin had a rematch with Dooku and defeated him. Palpatine goaded the young Jedi to kill the Sith, which he did. Then Palpatine recommended Anakin to become a member of the Jedi Council, which arose Jedi suspicions. They gave him a seat, but denied him the Master title. Angered, Anakin met with Palpatine who expressed his disapproval, planting in him distrust of the Jedi. He then told him "an old Sith legend" about Darth Plagueis and his power to prevent people from dying, before revealing that he himself was Darth Sidous, Dark Lord of the Sith. Anakin relayed the information to Mace Windu who then organized a strike team to arrest the Chancellor. But he had second thoughts and arrived at Palpatine's office to find the Sith being held by Windu at bladepoint. Palpatine fired Force Lightning at the Jedi Master and both combatants pleaded for his loyalty. Anakin then panicked and drew his lightsaber, cutting off Windu's hand. Palpatine then killed the Jedi Master with Force Lightning and Anakin, now irreversibly involved in the conflict, had nowhere to go. Sidious then convinced him further to join the Sith and Anakin then complied. Sidious then gave him a Sith name and at this point, Anakin Skywalker was no more and
   Darth Vader
   was born.

   , with Force Lightning. Vader was torn between his loyalty to the Emperor and his love for his son. He feared the Emperor, but his love for his son was stronger, rebirthing Anakin Skywalker and destroying Vader. Anakin then grabbed Palpatine from behind, hoisted him into the air, and threw him into the reactor shaft of the Death Star II, killing him. But the Emperor's lightning short-circuited Anakin's life-support system, mortally wounding him. At his shuttle, Anakin requested that Luke remove his mask so that he could see his son with his own eyes. Luke complied and Anakin died, telling Luke to "

   Kylo Ren
   , who was unaware of his redemption.
