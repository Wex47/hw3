   Boba Fett's first appearance was in
   7144 Slave I
   in
   2000
   , and also in
   3341 Star Wars #2
   . This version of Boba Fett had green printed Mandalorian armour, with light grey arms and dark grey hands. His leg piece was light gray and brown, and his head was black with no face. Boba Fett's Mandalorian armour was completed with his helmet and jetpack, which were one piece. The front of the helmet had printing on it around the visor section, as well as two black triangles above the visor and yellow rectangles on the top left-hand side. For the three sets in which this variant was released (the third set being in
   4476 Jabba's Prize
   released in
   2003
   ), Boba Fett came with one weapon, a black
   blaster
   .

   . This version of Boba Fett featured him as a boy in blue clothing (light blue torso and legs, dark blue arms) with yellow hands and a yellow head with black printing for his face, with a black hairpiece. Young Boba Fett had shorter non-moving legs which were designed for smaller characters such as

   Boba Fett's next version came in

   . The variant was very similar to the original one, except it contained extra printing on the arm and leg pieces, giving the minifigure a more detailed appearance. This variant was exclusive to the
   10123 Cloud City
   set, and came with the same gun piece as the original version. At the time, arm printing was a rarity for minifigures.

   under Boba Fett's ownership. This variant of Boba Fett once again featured him in his Mandalorian armour, though the armour displayed on his torso appeared more battle-worn than the previous incarnations. Along with armour printing on the torso piece, Boba Fett's dark brown utility belt was printed on along with a
   Wookiee
   scalp hanging down from the right-hand side. His arms were
   Sand Blue
   and he had dark gray hands. The leg piece is also Sand Blue with dark red hips. New for this variant, Boba Fett a face and not just a black head. This variant was released with a number of accessories, including a
   blaster
   with a light grey
   TECHNIC
   element

   Sitting between Boba Fett's head and torso pieces were two other parts: a brown cloth piece similar to a cape, which fell over Boba Fett's left shoulder, and a sand green jetpack piece, which was first introduced in
   2009
   . Boba Fett's helmet was separate to the jetpack piece and fully enclosed. It was mainly sand green in colour, with some darker green printing, along with a black visor pattern and red markings around the visor. Some grey markings, representing dents in the helmet, along with the similar markings from the original helmet design, were also included. The helmet also featured holes (one on each side) where
   Clone Trooper
   accessories could be inserted. In this case, a rangefinder was attached to the right-hand side of the helmet.

   In

   9496 Desert Skiff
   , features a similar torso and helmet print as the one released in
   2010
   , along with using the same head piece. However, on this version, Fett's legs had a dark green hip joint and were printed, featuring a continuation of the armor plating from the torso, orange kneepads, and black and silver boots. The top section of the hip joint was also printed brown on the front side. This version of Fett retained his grey rangefinder from the 2010 version, but featured a green cloth which was thinner than the brown one previously used, and carried a gun constructed from a
   blaster pistol
   and a black
   lightsaber hilt
   .

   Also released in 2012 was a
   Celebration VI MINI Slave I
   at the San Diego Comic-Con International. This variant of Fett used the torso, leg and helmet pieces found on the other version released in 2012, but had a black headpiece with a smiling flesh-coloured face printed on it, a piece which was first used for
   Stormtroopers
   ,
   Scout Troopers
   , and
   TIE Pilots
   . Apart from the helmet, this version of Fett did not come with any other accessories.

   Four promotional versions of Boba Fett have been created and released to date, all in
   2010
   . The first variant released was a white Boba Fett. Ten thousand of these minifigures were released.
   The first known main release was when 150 of these Minifigures were given out at the 2010 Canadian Toy Fair. This minifigure has the same pieces as the original version- legs, torso, black head and joined helmet and jetpack piece. The difference is that the minifigure's legs are all white as is the helmet/jetpack piece. The torso is also white, but features some black outline printing on it to represent Mandalorian armour. Approximately 320 of these white minifigures were distributed during
   LEGOLAND California
   's LEGO Star Wars Days held
   August 7
   and
   8
   , 2010. The minifigures were given to winners of the Jedi Trivia contest.

   The second release was a solid bronze Boba Fett, given away as part of LEGO's
   "May the 4th"
   promotion. There are only two of these minifigures in existence, which were randomly given away to an order from the US or Canada with selected Star Wars sets ordered during the promotion. This minifigure had torso, leg, head and helmet/jetpack pieces, all of which are solid bronze.

The three minifigures were presented in a frame with a certificate of authenticity. These gold and silver variants were in the mould of pre-2010 Boba Fett minifigures. Additional gold and silver Boba Fett minifigures were given away during Star Wars Celebration V.

He flies Slave I, a highly customized starship that is just as packed with hidden surprises as its pilot.
