   had additional printing on the head for a headset, with a black microphone running down the right-hand side, and gold printing for the top of the headset above the eyebrows. Both head pieces had orange printing on it for Obi-Wan's beard and eyebrows, and black printing for the eyes and smiling mouth.

In this set, Obi-Wan's hilt was chrome silver. A Light-Up Lightsaber figure of Obi-Wan was also released in the

The torso piece for this version was the same as his previously existing Episode III versions, but came with plain tan legs. He came with a brown hood and cape, and a blue-bladed lightsaber with a plain grey hilt. Obi-Wan's new Episode III variant for 2007 was identical to his variant from the 7283 Ultimate Space Battle, except his legs were plain tan. This variant came without any accessories. The Episode IV variant was redesigned with a new torso piece--black lines for robe detailing, dark brown printing for an inner robe and belt with some flesh printing at the top for skin. The hands on the torso piece were flesh-coloured, as was his head. The face was redesigned, with the new grey printing for a beard and eyebrows, black printing for dot eyes and a new expression with the mouth, and some orange printing for extra detailing on the face. The plain tan legs and grey hairpiece were once again used for this variant; however, no accessories were included.

This minifigure had plain tan legs, a tan torso piece with flesh-coloured hands and redesigned printing--black and brown for robe detailing and flesh printing at the top--and a double-sided headpiece.

The head piece was also updated to have a different expression than the 2011 variant on one side, and on the other, a rebreather was printed over Obi-Wan's mouth, based on the scene in Episode I where Obi-Wan had to swim underwater to travel to Otoh Gunga. Instead of a hood piece, an orange hairpiece is used, but the minifigure retained a blue-bladed, silver hilted lightsaber as an accessory.

   At an early age, Obi-Wan was taken to be trained as a Jedi, and at the age of 13, began his training under Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Towards the end of his apprenticeship, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan were called upon to settle a dispute between the Trade Federation and the people of Naboo. However, the Trade Federation were under the influence of the Sith, and the dispute became hostile, with an invasion on Naboo being launched, and the citizens of the planet being imprisoned. However, after meeting
   Jar Jar Binks
   and
   Boss Nass
   , the two Jedi managed to free the
   Queen Amidala
   , and escaped on a Naboo Cruiser, intending to travel to the galactic capital of Coruscant to seek assistance. However, the ship was damaged by the Federation's orbiting blockade, and they were forced to land elsewhere, deciding on the desert world of Tatooine. The two Jedi split up, with Obi-Wan staying with the ship, and Qui-Gon to go into Mos Eisley to acquire replacement parts for the ship. A day later, as Qui-Gon was returning to the ship with the parts and
   a boy
   , he was attacked by a
   Darth Maul
   , a Sith Apprentice. Obi-Wan ordered the pilot to take off, and hover nearby the duel between Jinn and Maul, allowing Qui-Gon to escape the battle.

  <p key="29249a8c-30a2-4268-ab9c-dd2a4b74ec3d">
   On Coruscant, Obi-Wan reported to the Jedi Council with Qui-Gon, telling them about their encounter with the Sith warrior and Anakin Skywalker, the Force-sensitive child who Qui-Gon freed on Tatooine. The Council agreed to allow Anakin to be assessed to see if he could become a Jedi, despite being much older than when most Jedi begin their training. After Anakin was tested, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon met the Council once again with Skywalker this time, and were informed that Anakin would not be trained as a Jedi due to his advanced age. They then proceeded to tell them that the Queen was about to leave for Naboo, and they should escort her.
  </p>
  <p key="ba784532-c6f6-4edb-a321-b327ce6332f2">
   On Naboo, the Queen gathered her forces and formed an Alliance with Boss Nass and the Gungans, and battles with the Federation were initiated on several fronts. The Jedi remained with the Queen, until a door opened in the hangar opened, with Darth Maul blocking the way. The Queen and her security forces looked for another path, while the Jedi and Sith prepared to duel. As the duel progressed, Obi-Wan began to fall behind, at one point leaving him between forcefields, and forced to watch his Master fight Maul alone. During this time, Maul managed to get through Qui-Gon's guard, killing him. Obi-Wan then proceeded to attack Maul when he was freed, managing to cut the Sith Lord's double-bladed lightsaber in half, but was Force-pushed into a pit, though he managed to grab hold of a protruding power node. Obi-Wan then calmed himself, and leaped out of the pit, at the same time using the Force to grab his fallen Master's lightsaber, and cut Maul in two, who fell down the pit. After Naboo was liberated, Obi-Wan was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and took Anakin to be his Apprentice, fulfilling his Master's dying wish.

   Ten years later, Anakin and his Master Obi-Wan were tasked with acting as bodyguards for the now-Senator Padmé Amidala after an assassination attempt. That night, another attempt on Padmé's life was carried out. Anakin saved Padmé from two venomous insects, while Obi-Wan grabbed onto the hovering courier droid which deployed them, hoping it would lead him to whoever sent the droid. Meanwhile, Anakin commandeered an airspeeder to catch up to Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan dropped off the droid as it was destroyed by its owner- the bounty hunter
   Zam Wessell
   . Anakin flew underneath Obi-Wan and caught him in the speeder, then they chased Zam through Coruscant. Anakin leaped out of the speeder and landed on Zam Wessell's speeder, while Obi-Wan took over flying the speeder. Zam's speeder crashed after Anakin had damaged it, and she fled to a nearby cantina. Obi-Wan landed his speeder and caught up with Anakin, and the two entered the bar together. The pursuit ended when Zam attempted to shoot Obi-Wan, but he managed to disarm her first. Obi-Wan and Anakin took Zam outside the cantina and attempted to interrogate her, but before she could reveal any important information, she was killed by a toxic dart, fired by a Mandalorian who escaped with a jetpack.

Obi-Wan followed Jango to Geonosis, and came upon leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a group of worlds who wished to break away from the Republic, talking about a large droid army they had formed.

Not long after this, Chancellor Palpatine was revealed to be Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, who ordered all
   clone troopers
   to kill the Jedi. On Utapau, Commander Cody complied, with him and his men opening fire on Kenobi. However, Obi-Wan was able to escape, and fled the planet in Grievous' starfighter. Obi-Wan then met up with Senator
   Bail Organa

   Darth Vader

Obi-Wan found Anakin on Mustafar, when he stowed away on the pregnant Padmé's ship after he suspected that she was going to meet the new Sith. Obi-Wan then fought Anakin in a lengthy duel on the lava world, and was successful in defeating his former student, severing his legs and non-mechanical arm in one strike. Obi-Wan left the scene, taking Anakin's lightsaber as he fell into the lava. Obi-Wan then took Padmé to Polis Massa, where she gave birth to twins:

   Stormtroopers
   , he was able to disable the tractor beam, but was met by Darth Vader, who Palpatine had saved from the lava on Mustafar and put him in a black suit of armour. Former Master and Apprentice duelled for the last time, but then Obi-Wan, seeing Luke running towards the

   However, during the nineteen years he had spent on Tatooine, Obi-Wan had learned how to retain his identity after death after receiving training from his old Master, Qui-Gon. Obi-Wan helped and watched over Luke on several occasions, including telling him to trust his instincts instead of the targeting computer when he was a part of the Rebel Alliance's assault on the Death Star, leading to the space station's destruction. Obi-Wan was present on Endor with Luke after the destruction of the Emperor and the Second Death Star, along with two of his recently deceased friends who had also learned how to become Force ghosts- Master Yoda and Anakin Skywalker, who Luke had helped to turn back to the light before his death.

       Though he may be older than he was in his days as a Jedi General during the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi is still a skilled Jedi Master with a sharp wit and strong Force abilities. He is determined to help Luke Skywalker discover his destiny, even if it means facing Obi-Wan’s one-time pupil Darth Vader.
