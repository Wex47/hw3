   Fenrakk are a species of spiders with acidic saliva. They are native to the island of Voya Nui. The most well-known Fenrakk was enlarged by the
   Mask of Life
   and forcibly fused to
   Vezon
   , as a way of cursing Vezon. The Mask of Life also gave Vezon the ability to absorb kinetic energy, and he shared this power with Fenrakk, allowing them to grow stronger with every physical attack made by them or against them. This ability makes the two unaffected by all physical blows (as they immediately grow strong enough to withstand the attack), and the mask also grants them protection from other dangers such as lava.
  </p>
  <p key="1ef53ef3-0a9d-4093-b801-badecb43602e">
   The Toa Inika have tamed smaller, normal-sized "Fenrakk Spawn" to use as mounts in their sieges against the

   When Vezon and Fenrakk were defeated by the Toa Inika and the duo plunged into lava of their own free will, the Mask of Life evolved Fenrakk further into a new dragon-like creature that Vezon called Kardas. Kardas naturally generates concussive force inside its body that it can fire out its mouth; in fact if it
   <i key="13647316-e8b8-42f1-af46-7e4ab476c616">
    doesn't
   </i>
   release this force periodically, the concussive force will cause it to explode. It does not appear to have Fenrakk's ability to absorb kinetic energy. Vezon mentioned that if he were to plunge into the lava with Kardas, an even more terrifying 'steed' would emerge with him.
  </p>
  <p key="413612c3-2860-4533-9a3d-22aa8827a756">
   After the Toa took the Mask of Life, Vezon and Kardas were no longer fused, and thus went their separate ways. Kardas traveled to the surface, and has since lost a fight against a Tahtorak that was on Voya Nui. Flying north, it arrived on the island of Mata Nui and was injured in a conflict with the Bohrok. Toa Gali helped to heal its injuries, but what it will do next is anyone's guess.

   Keetongu lived in a Ko-Metru cave that could be accessed by an underground chute in Metru Nui. The Toa Hordika and the
   Rahaga
   found him and got him to help defeat the Visorak and reverse their mutations. In the Toa's siege of the Coliseum,
   Roodaka
   baited Keetongu into killing the Visorak's king,
   Sidorak
   . When
   Makuta
   later came to the city, Keetongu sensed his evil and attacked, only to be beaten into unconsciousness. He now comes and goes from the city as the Rahaga do,
   but was not present to welcome the
   Matoran
   upon their return.

   Keetongu can heal anyone afflicted by poison or venom, as long as the poison has not fully taken effect; and his spinning shield array can absorb attacks that he can then send back at his opponent using his
   Rhotuka spinner
   (though he cannot absorb the spinners of Roodaka or Sidorak). His single visible eye cannot actually see, but it can detect the good or evil in someone; the eyes that he sees with are hidden behind it. Rahaga Norik even stated that "Keetongu sees with one eye what we have missed with all of ours." He also carries a climbing claw that can be used as a melee weapon. He possesses great strength, rivaling that of a Makuta. As Keetongu is the only one of his race left in existence, it is impossible to tell which powers are shared by the entire race. He speaks in a grinding language intelligible only to himself and the Rahaga.

   Krahka was first encountered in Metru Nui defending her territory in the Archive's Maintenance Tunnels from the Toa Metru. She later joined the Toa Hordika in fighting the
   Visorak

Eventually, she was retired from racing, instead giving "taxi crab" rides between Po-Koro and Onu-Koro. It was on this job that

   This Tahtorak was last seen disappearing into the Zone of Darkness with Krahka and Zivon. Ironically, Brutaka was responsible for Tahtorak's and Krahka's escape from the Zone of Shadow a thousand years later, as he opened a gate to try to trap his former friend
   Axonn

    - A bull Rahi that can teleport away from danger (though they have been known to teleport into solid objects on occasion).

    Most famously, the two bird species "Kahu" and "Kewa" were reclassified as different breeds of a single species, called "Gukko" (a third breed was later introduced). The fact that Rahaga Kualus insists that "Gukko" is the wrong name for the species is likely an in-joke referencing this name change.
   </li>
   <li key="cb85d1cd-699b-4674-82c4-6f232ffc6a39">
    The names "Hoi", "Kuna", and "Vako" have also been dropped. Kuna are now called "Bog Snakes" and Hoi are now "Shore Turtles" but no replacement name has been given for the Vako species.

   Unrelated to the lawsuit, the "Mukau" was renamed the "Mata Nui Cow" because LEGO's story team felt that the pun on "Moo-cow" was too ridiculous.
