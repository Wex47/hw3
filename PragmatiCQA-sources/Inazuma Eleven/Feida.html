   's
   Chrono Stone
   . As Raimon's players were saying they could save Endou Mamoru themselves and that they wouldn't team up with El Dorado, Toudou told them what was happening in their era.
  </p>
  <p key="671872ac-d385-4114-a136-988e88e5eef6">
   Firstly, he said El Dorado is in a war against Feida. He explained to them Second Stage Children's DNA has a gene called SSC. It makes them have an incredible intelligence and extraordinary physical abilities. Some of them are telepaths and their senses are higher than human's ones, who couldn't have Second Stage Children's powers.
  </p>
  <p key="80f5bdce-69b9-4a05-9fe2-33f0861df0df">
   However, one year ago, Feida started a war against El Dorado to control the whole world. They attacked El Dorado by using weapons of massive destruction, which run on Second Stage Children's own auras. To counter them, El Dorado sent
   <a href="Protocol Omega.html" key="29dca552-7f5c-4c69-b835-c5741c05a959" title="Protocol Omega">
    Protocol Omega
   </a>
   's teams to Raimon's era in order to erase soccer, which means Feida would be erased from the existence as well. However, Raimon prevented them from erasing soccer.
  </p>
  <p key="bc618051-07ae-4d0f-b599-b30df37773af">
   Hearing this, Shindou asked why Feida started a war. Toudou answered they wanted to be world leaders to create a world which would belong to them. He added their existence was the symbol of the revenge they wanted to take against the ones who could not accept them as they are.
  </p>
  <p key="fd5fd36c-773c-40e5-9014-d4940e3068aa">
   Then, Toudou told Raimon that some days ago, Feida had made an offer to El Dorado, when their leader came to their headquarters. This offer was called Ragnarok, and its goal was to determine who would rule the world by playing three soccer matches. It surprised Tenma and the others, as soccer was compared to war. If El Dorado loses this tournament, Second Stage Children will rule the world. However,
   Sangoku
   asked El Dorado's leaders why Feida offered them Ragnarok, as they could conquer the world by their own hands. Sakamaki answered him by saying Feida's members want to test themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="5982e96c-78a3-4aee-a82b-1e3019506281">
   In fact, Second Stage Children can't become adults because they die when they're about 20 years old. So, they want to rule the world before dying. Consequently, El Dorado has to use all its power to fight against Feida, so the world would not be controlled by them. Their intentions are to create a world where only Second Stage Children would live in, so the humanity would completely disappear. After explaining this to Raimon, Toudou said they have to team up with El Dorado to fight against Feida in Ragnarok.
  </p>
  <p key="6b0dfde6-b577-4b9a-a627-1736c6382003">
   Later, in their headquarters, Feida was shown in its entirety.
   Garo
   and the others members of his team,
   Zan
   , were about to go to El Dorado's headquarters to show them their anger, but
   Meia
   said they would show it to them during Ragnarok. They didn't agree with each other and started fighting. As
   SARU
   entered the room,
   Garo
   and
   Meia
   immediately stopped fighting. Meia asked him about El Dorado's situation, in which SARU answered they teamed up with Raimon to play the three matches in Ragnarok, and finished by saying Feida would win.
   Zanark
   , who had joined Feida, smiled about it and whispered he could settle his accounts with Raimon.

   appeared outside the headquarters, SARU and the rest of Feida appeared too. It surprised Tenma who had already seen him before. He told him he is Feida's emperor, and that soon he'll be the master of the whole world.
   Fei
   started having a headache for no reason. SARU asked them if they had liked the opening ceremony of Ragnarok, which was to destruct El Dorado's headquarters. Then, he declared there would be soccer matches now, and along with the others Second Stage Children, they created the
   Ragnarok Stadium
   by using their psychic powers.
  </p>
  <p key="1ee45d97-3b11-429d-86eb-9d872cd6f72b">
   As the stadium was fully created, SARU said El Dorado's and Raimon's teams would be able to train and to meet each other. Raimon's players were shocked, saying they had no chance against Feida. However, SARU said they would not use such powers during Ragnarok, and that they would beat them without a such force to show how they're stronger. Then, they left while Saryuu was telling them the first match would start tomorrow. As he was leaving, SARU smiled when looking to Fei, which made his headache become even worse, and he fell.

They couldn't help him as they were occupied with something else. As they left, SARU said they would never change. Then, the match opposing

Then, Saryuu appeared too and declared Fei is a Second Stage Children too. He explained to Tenma he had erased Fei's memories and sent him to

   Near the end of the episode, the three El Dorado teams captains and coaches were seen with Toudou Heikichi. He told them El Dorado's institute of science had found a vaccine to cure Second Stage Children and erase the powers they are given by the SSC gene. However, Sakamaki added they would not take the vaccine as the only thing which preoccupied Saryuu was to rule the world.

   Helper X

After the end of the second match, Vanfeny and Garsha appeared again along with SARU. As Vanfeny said Giru had lost, SARU answered Feida's next team would certainly win. Vanfeny continued saying it wasn't a good idea to let Zanark leave as he joined El Dorado's and Raimon's alliance, but Garsha declared SARU had taken Fei back from Raimon. Hearing this, Feida's leader said he would take pleasure by watching the next match.

   Later in the episode, Helper X brought Fei to a locker room, and as this one got up, he confessed to him that he is his father. Fei and the others were surprised by it. However, Fei wanted to know why is he here, to which Asurei answered saying he wanted to take care of him, so he joined Feida to do so. Fei said Asurei had abandoned him when he was young, and added the reason was because Asurei was scared of him, being a

Asurei said to him he wasn't late, and that he would leave Feida. That made Fei say they are all selfish, and SARU was the only one who could help him. Asurei stated his heart would be swallowed by SARU's evil one, to which Fei answered his feelings would not change.

Hearing that, SARU accorded to Fei to take it, and he said Second Stage Children's methods are bad. Feida's leader laughed, and then Fei told him he would now battle with Tenma and the others. SARU answered he would never be able to be a friend of Endou and Raimon's players, but Fei then said they would meet each other again on the field. After seeing him leave, SARU seemed dissatisfied. Garsha and Vanfeny then appeared in the room. The first one asked if it they should let him go, to which the other one added he came back to Raimon for his parents. He laughed about it, but SARU still said it was an useless choice Fei had made.

As soon as it would be done, Asurei would try to recuper Fei, even though he knew it was a selfish wish. He finished his speech saying the last match should be suspended. However, SARU said humans were not ready to dominate the whole world, so Second Stage Children would do instead, and that Fei would regret betraying Feida. This made Asurei leave.

Then, SARU shot an ampoule from his gun, which created a wormhole. The stadium entered in it, and then the wormhole closed itself, making it disappear from the policemen stare.

Suddenly, as Tenma was having the ball and advancing through the field, SARU got the ball from him fastly and easily. He then declared  he was disappointed by them. He passed the ball to
   Imusu

   Great Max na Ore

   Hosu

Sure of himself, SARU said they didn't understand Second Stage Children's strength yet, and put an ampoule into some kind of orb in this belt. His teammates did the same, and in addition received power. As the match started again, Imusu was seen to be way faster, to which Fei said they had used ampoules. He then explained they were keeping their auras into these ampoules, and that when these were used, it would raise a lot the user's abilities. While he was saying this, The Lagoon was attacking, and
   Daku
