   Tenma arrived at Raimon and saw a bus from Fifth Sector. He went to the soccer field and apologized to Sangoku for being late. There, Tenma heard that the Raimon's team received a note from

    Hamano Kaiji
    ,
    Hayami Tsurumasa
    and
    Kurama Norihito
    had to stay at Raimon from Shindou just in case something happens to the school when they were away. Kurama wished them good luck. When the Raimon's team went inside the bus, they talked a bit to each other. Tenma saw that Shinsuke was sleeping and wanted to wake up Shinsuke but then, he fell in sleep instead. After that, the whole Raimon team fell in sleep because they were gassed by sleeping gas.

   The young soccer players of Raimon woke up to find themselves in a grassland. Shinsuke asked where the managers, Haruna and Kidou were but the others didn't have any idea. Then Shindou asked if Tsurugi recognizes the island.
    Tsurugi Kyousuke
    then stated that the place was actually God Eden and a person named
    Kibayama Douzan
    appeared along with some tanks that surrounded Raimon. Shindou asked where Kidou and the others were but Kibayama replied that he is only interested in soccer players and said that they will have a match against

   . Then, a person named
    Hakuryuu
    appeared along with his team; Unlimited Shining. Tsurugi again recognized the person, Hakuryuu then wanted to see how Tsurugi was stronger this time - or even if he has got stronger. Kibayama challenged Raimon for a match against Unlimited Shining. Sangoku asked Shindou what they should do and Shindou replied that they should play against them and the others agreed with him.

Amagi asked what was wrong with Shindou because his plays weren't the same as usual and Kirino replied that not having a coach around, effected Shindou's plays and was worried about Shindou. Hakuryuu then injured some members of Raimon and ended up scoring another goal, which made Unlimited Shining in the lead with 2 points.Kirino said that they were too fast to stop them. Tenma asked Shindou what Raimon should do and Shindou replied that using hissatsu may work to stop Hakuryuu. The match again continued but Hakuryuu easily stole the ball again from Tenma and as the defense of Raimon tried to block him by using all of their hissatsu, they were unsuccessful to do so due to Hakuryuu made a tornado which disabled their hissatsu, and Hakuryuu scored again using a stronger White Hurricane and injured all the Raimon's members who were on the field. The match ended with Unlimited Shining giving a landslide point of 12; 5 points from the first half and 7 points for the second half. Most members of Raimon were lying on the ground and couldn't stand up due their injuries. Only Shindou, Tenma and Tsurugi were standing but then, Tsurugi fell down on the ground and Tenma followed him, leaving Shindou the only one who was standing.

But, by the time they had enough, they easily stole the ball and some members whose Shuu shooted. At that moment, there was a lamb passing by so Tenma used
    Soyokaze Step
    to save it from the mighty shoot, which then easily scored against
    Sangoku Taichi
    . The match ended with no official score.

    . He used the tail of his keshin to defeat Shindou's keshin. Tsurugi then summoned
    Kensei Lancelot
    to stop Hakuryuu but failed too. Tenma summoned
    Majin Pegasus
    and tried to attack Hakuryuu's keshin, but failed just like Shindou and Tsurugi. Raimon's defenders were also easily passed through. Then, Hakuryuu used

    Director Miyao Yoshikazu had the idea of adding Hakuryuu and Shuu's aura with stillness and movement first, to build up the tension.
   </li>
   <li key="ed777b79-8da6-4410-be86-c386d49a8f3d">
    The main Raimon trio's voice actors comment that
    <a href="Endou Mamoru.html" key="d1b77035-9842-4ac5-a9be-70c01444da82" title="Endou Mamoru">
     Endou Mamoru

    is being treated like a dead person because of the silhouette idea in the sky.
   </li>
   <li key="98e7b851-0455-4439-87d9-a6bb7671bbc0">
    They wanted to add a scene where Tenma and Shinsuke flew into space with the Inazuma steel tower, in which they said it could have only been done in the movie opening.
   </li>
   <li key="7d8f5498-8b6e-4be6-ba47-eb82e17d8779">
    Hakuryuu's initial idea is not thrashing his aura around but stop a cannonball with his stomach, but instead it was moved to a normal SEED in the movie.
   </li>
   <li key="4d807ad7-b73f-4258-89b9-9f66160bf3ed">
    Shindou's voice actor commented on how long would Tsurugi keep on not wearing the Raimon school uniform, along with Tenma's voice actor commenting that it's a 'poncho'. But Hino says that he must have asked school permission first to be able to wear that kind of outfit around. Tsurugi's voice actor then jokes with saying "I want to debut in my high school life like this"
   </li>
   <li key="23e84ac2-f213-4683-bb70-c8ac7c4b0d83">
    Shindou's voice actor also commented on Tsurugi's collar raising, and if it was influenced by Gouenji, saying "Since he admires him, he mimics him secretly."
    <ul key="4087801d-9d0e-47a2-828b-d05964c89edc">
     <li key="6c96b99b-6b40-4600-aa32-0efc0751c381">
      The movie director also added theirs Amagi's chin goggles and Shinsuke's bandanna, and the jacket that Tsurugi wears is like a cape... just like Kidou Yuuto. With his comment being "From a design perspective, they share those kinds of points."
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="5670eb0b-112b-4cc9-9412-6bf82f2bbaed">
    The reason why Hamano, Hayami and Kurama stayed was because Hino concluded there were too many people in the team. Though, Tenma's voice actor comments that even if those three were left, they couldn't protect anything with Shindou's voice actor agreeing.
    <ul key="ad045e68-766a-4879-a0a4-a1d6116b290f">
     <li key="7ab1041e-9df2-41a8-8392-75c32da6dba6">
      The movie director commented that they made this way back in April, before the season started airing. No one knew what would happen to the team afterwards, with Hino backing it up that they wouldn't know who would be a popular character or not, but if they were to make the decision now, they wouldn't have left them and wished to give a better reason.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="d599a656-e912-435a-98a1-70e88255208d">
    They also said this was a big deal for Aoyama and Ichino to be in the movie, considering their screen time.
    <ul key="8856f611-6c97-4432-950b-dffe2a7486f3">
     <li key="7cabf637-aa57-4805-8c83-1059b6a44e83">
      The voice actors commented that Aoyama and Ichino felt like they were in the matches only to commentate, dubbing them the 'commentating duo'.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="c0960e0b-9fd0-4fde-8aa0-b58e9518de13">
    The voice actors felt sorry for Sangoku, even commenting that one of the father adults there said that they 'felt Sangoku's pain'. Since Sangoku is like the 'father' of the team.
    <ul key="3228ce86-c383-4b75-8878-c61b0058dd09">
     <li key="cfe5e960-0a9a-46d1-9558-63ab4ce42da0">
      Shindou's voice actor also commented that it's always "Fence of GAWAAAHH" for Sangoku.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="ef8661f0-8c1e-46e6-af03-dfaf01e4aede">
    The voice actors asked what really happened to Kageyama Reiji's fate during Hikaru's introduction to the adults but Hino and the movie director had their lips sealed.
   </li>
   <li key="5b8f07df-5d05-411b-84a3-ef9a60db0932">
    Shindou's voice actor said that the sunglasses didn't fit Ishido's style, with Tsurugi voice actor also agreeing.
    <ul key="b58fc1cf-93a0-4c4a-b446-3a287004b615">
     <li key="43c61ea6-896c-4840-9097-e0b28ee0fab3">
      Shindou's voice actor also commented if Gouenji's little sister pushed him into that fashion by also jokingly stating "Onii-chan, you're so cool!"
     </li>
     <li key="a6b3068b-c855-4af5-8870-60f9aa98f700">
      Hino also defended the fashion, stating that Gouenji had to pretend someone he wasn't so he had to wear a fashion style he didn't like but even if he returned with a different outfit in Chrono Stone, some fashion stuck on him.
     </li>
     <li key="4c5030af-6fca-4e7e-9da0-d63b6589a49b">
      They also commented that Sangoku's training in God Eden is easier than the others. The original plan though was for logs to hit him though.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="87838cac-73b5-4c58-83d7-f2a9d5b23210">
    The voice actors also commented they didn't expect that Hakuryuu will have a casual outfit in the movie. Shindou's voice actor comments that Hakuryuu's fashionable.
   </li>
   <li key="9c832c15-97d4-4050-b29c-55c663115e14">
    When Tenma saved the lamb, his voice actor during the commentary commented it was "Goat Kid Step" jokingly.
   </li>
   <li key="2f4798f7-bc3c-4632-9723-1c81a423d8d1">
    The training for the match against Team Zero was said to be around 3 days.
   </li>
   <li key="763f4824-9ec8-4ff5-a7e6-35402b90ebeb">
    It was also commented that this movie was the passing of the 'torch' of Raimon. In which the adults pass the responsibility to the next generation.
   </li>
   <li key="b3f4c5f9-6461-4691-8abc-9b5dce5696bc">
    The movie, when watched in 3D will instantly go off on the ending which the SEEDS watching the stadium throw their goggles high up.
