   Haizaki walked out of school and encountered two of his teammates, who asked him where he's going, as their training was about to begin. Haizaki however, decided to pass on training, as he thought it didn't matter whether he plays or not. Then,
   Mizukamiya Seiryuu
   also came in, questioning why Haizaki purposely disrupted the team, though Haizaki didn't really reply on that. Haizaki traveled to the arcade in town by train, to try and grab a teddy bear from one of the machines. There he encountered
   Inamori Asuto
   , who spotted him in the arcade. Haizaki didn't remember him at first, but when Asuto explained where they met, he remembered "the newbie team",
   Inakuni Raimon
   . When Asuto asked why he wasn't preparing for his next match, Haizaki said he won't play in the match, as he himself decided so. Haizaki then walked out, as he grabbed the teddy bear and went to the hospital, being followed by
   Kozoumaru Sasuke
   . There he visited Akane, where he gave her the teddy bear, wishing that she'd return to normal. Walking out of the hospital, Haizaki saw an interview with

Triangle Z was shot towards Gouenji, but redirected at the last second towards the goal, scoring past and shocked Haizaki, making the score 2-0. During half-time, Haizaki confronted Kidou to switch him back as a forward, but Kidou refused, as he had a plan to win the match and for Haizaki who needed to figure out why he's a goalkeeper. Haizaki thought he would never lose to Gouenji, but Kidou quickly snapped back not to underestimate him. Haizaki's individual strength would not be enough to beat Gouenji's teamwork. In the second half, Haizaki quickly leaped forward, stealing the ball from
   Mukata Masaru
   , charging on his own. Passing two players, he eventually was stopped by three players of Kidokawa Seishuu and got the ball stolen by
   Nishigaki Mamoru

   . This left the goal open, but the Fire Tornado shot by Gouenji, was saved by the team effort of Seishou's defenders. Mizukamiya then ordered Haizaki to think about how to protect the goal. Haizaki quickly figured how to, as he analyzed the attack pattern of Kidokawa Seishuu. He stole the ball from Gouenji and ordered the defense around. As he figured out how to play as a goalkeeper, he got switched back to the forward position and charged together with Kidou and his teammates, facing of Kidokawa Seishuu's defense.

   Inakuni Raimon
   met at the stands during the selection ceremony. He seemed to be a little bit nervous but still denied when Asuto asked him about that. He was later announced as the one of the forwards in team.

   It was revealed that the next Japan's opponent was Australia. Because the coach didn't get any informations about they play, he let Inazuma Japan's players train and do what they wanted. Haizaki wasn't surprised of his frivolous behavior. He was annoyed after he watched news on TV in which it was told that after Gouenji left the team, their chances for winning dropped significantly. Later during the training he couldn't concentrate and he got his anger out of Hiroto. He started to train with Kidou who was concerned about him. He asked Haizaki why he was so impatient. Haizaki responded that they were facing the world and he wanted to win with this team. He stated that now he was the only person that team could rely on, after Gouenji wasn't there. Haizaki wanted to get stronger to be able to beat players like Gouenji or Hiroto. As he stated Hiroto's abilities were comparable to Haizaki and he was still developing, what made Haizaki upset. Kidou said that Haizaki reminded him his own past. He was also searching some light in his life and he found it in Endou. He said that Haizaki was guided so far by light in Asuto and maybe his another light would be found across the ocean. Kidou believed that Haizaki got what it takes to become Inazuma Japan's ace. When the match against
   Shining Satans
   started, Haizaki seemed to be in a much better condition, full of enthusiasm and ready to fight. He looked at Kidou and stated that he was also like a light for him, to the point that he blinded him. From the beginning Australia started to use tricks in their play, causing consternation in Japan's players. Hiroto stated that he would show them that the god's power is greater than devil's but Haizaki smiled and said that Hiroto wasn't even able to beat him who was called the devil as well. He was trying to attack Australian goal but was stopped by their hissatsu tactic

Haizaki was ashamed by Kidou's behavior and said with defiance that Kidou was terrible commander of the pitch. When hypnosis failed, Shining Satans started to use mirrors hidden in their cleats. They blinded Japan's players one by one and scored their third goal. Haizaki realized that it might be

Haizaki and Hiroto started to play rough and kept shooting at Australian players as well. Ichihoshi told to Asuto that they were aiming at him because they didn't like his plays.

Haizaki, Hiroto and Kidou kept shooting at Ichihoshi but their attack was stopped by Asuto who protected Ichihoshi from another hit. Haizaki asked him why he did it and got in his way. Asuto responded that he wouldn't let to hurt his teammates using soccer. Haizaki stated that he was naive. Later final shot by Haizaki and Hiroto sealed the victory of Japan. After the match ended, Endou praised them and their perfect synchronization, he was counting for them during the next matches as well.

He was sure that it was Ichihoshi who set Kidou up but he denied. Haizaki almost punch him but was stopped by Asuto and Endou. Ichihoshi warned Haizaki to calm down if he didn't want to lose his soccer career as Kidou did. When he left, Haizaki had a grudge against Asuto because he prevented him when he wanted to punish Ichihoshi. He let out his anger by throwing a bench and accidentally hit

Ichihoshi managed easily avoid the hitting until Hiroto grabbed him. When Asuto and Goujin were trying to stop them, Haizaki threatened Asuto that would punch him. Then Endou came with
   Ootani Tsukushi
   and stated that they should be united since Gouenji and Kidou weren't with team. But Haizaki responded that it was Ichihoshi, who used dirty tricks to get rid of them two. He got mad after Ichihoshi mentioned about Kidou using doping. They've noticed someone with camera who was hiding in the bushes. Hiroto was wondering if Ichihoshi didn't provoke Haizaki on purpose. When coach Zhao appeared Haizaki told that he should kick out Ichihoshi of the team, otherwise they would do it themselves. However the coach stated that Ichihoshi should be considered innocent until his guilt was proven. Haizaki then insulted the coach and called him stupid but Zhao forbade them to hurt Ichihoshi.

Despite of captain's request, they didn't intend to be friends with Ichihoshi, stating that he was their enemy. Hiroto agreed that considering everything what he did, he was guilty.

Haizaki seemed to be worried hearing that and stated that apparently there wasn't place for him anymore in Seishou. To his much surprise Mizukamiya revealed that he could rejoin the team, after the FFI ended, according to the report that he got from Zhao Jinyun. The Seishou Gakuen was always place where Haizaki belonged to, nothing changed in that matter. When Mizukamiya told him that as a captain he could show him the right path to follow, Haizaki started to tease with him, stating that no one could ever tame the devil of the field. Mizukamiya explained that he never intended to do it and was wondering about using nickname like the devil of the field's master as well.

   During the flight to Russia the crew announced that the Japanese youth soccer team Inazuma Japan was on board and the passengers were asked to applaud for their achievements so far. Haizaki stood up together with the others, but as usual he wasn't impressed with it, like he didn't care about anything. When later the captain of the Russian team,

   welcomed Inazuma Japan later at the airport, Haizaki looked at them with reluctance, knowing that they were connected with the Orion Foundation. To his much surprise, Froy denied that they had something in common with this organization. While the departure from the airport was delayed,

   stated that in Russia nothing worked on time like in Japan and Haizaki irritated hearing that. Later the old

   When they reached the city of
   Kazan
   , Haizaki asked Pampietta, what he could tell them about this place. Pampietta again sought information on the phone, which apparently disgusted Haizaki when he stated that the guide was going to read straight from the screen. Later during the meal they met several members of the Spanish team and Luther began to provoke them, claiming that they would never beat Spain if they could eat so little. Haizaki and Hiroto promptly asked you for the seconds and Endou proposed a food contest to which Clario and Nishikage joined. At the end Nishikage felt sick and Endou with Clario drew. Later at
   Kazan Soccer Center
   the team met their new physical trainer
   Sekiya Tomoari
   who prepared for everyone personalized exercise schedule. After the training Gouenji informed Haizaki, Asuto and Nosaka that he was going to pass them his technique Last Resort. So they started to train but the result of this wasn't breathtaking at all. Their struggle was interrupted by
   Fubuki Atsuya
   who unexpectedly appeared before the team and scored a goal.
  </p>
  <p key="55663e6f-d7a2-430b-bf39-ee3f106a2994">
   Before the kick-off Haizaki made a joke about Atsuya being a traitor, but he denied and warned Haizaki that he wouldn't give him the ball if he didn't stop talking so stupidly. Later Haizaki got the ball from Asuto but Spanish defender
   Reinaldo Baraja
   easily stole it from him, sliding and passing other Japan's players. Soon after Clario scored the first goal for Spain. However Endou didn't lose fighting spirit and stated that would stop it next time. Haizaki agreed that it was just one point. When the match resumed Spanish players
   Domelgo Dominguez
   and
   Rufino Avalos
   were blocking Haizaki and Atsuya, their defense was very tight so they couldn't even move. When later Endou managed to stop Clario's shot Japan could focus on counterattack. Haizaki got the ball from Nosaka but immediately clashed between two defenders who started to mock him. They were running together, barring his way. As it turned out Haizaki was only decoy and fell on the field, passing the ball to Asuto, who kicked it further to Atsuya. Unluckily his shot
   Hissatsu Kumagoroshi Zan
   was easily blocked by Spanish goalkeeper
   Alonso Fibiano
   .

  <p key="433858d7-5ffd-421a-b1c5-1fc769af08c9">
   The match resumed again and Spain charged through the Japan's defense. Haizaki was trying to stop Luther, but they clashed together and Luther pushed him violently on the field. Soon after Spain scored the second goal, when Clario misled Endou with his curling Diamond Ray. Haizaki understood that playing like that, they won't be able to score since they had to focus on defense. Unexpectedly Fubuki started to run towards the Spanish goal, while the other players were going to protect Japan's half of the field. Haizaki looked at Fubuki unable to figure out what was going on. Atsuya quickly stole the ball from Bergamo sliding and made a long pass straight to his brother. Later they created new technique and scored the first goal for Japan, which immediately raised up Japan's morale and fighting spirit. During the break Haizaki was sitting on the field, gasping for breath and totally exhausted. When Li told that it wouldn't be possible for him to play in the second half, Haizaki immediately stood up but his legs were shaking and Hiroto had to catch him, before he fell. He started to tease with Haizaki that devil needed support from god and Haizaki muttered to leave him what Hiroto did, stating that it would be a nuisance on the field if he wasn't even able to stand. After Ichihoshi finished his analysis of Spain, Nosaka decided to use new strategy but he needed Haizaki to continue playing. Coach Zhao asked Sekiya to take care of Haizaki. To everyone's surprise Sekiya turned out to be certified qigong massage therapist and he used special technique Healing Celebration to restore Haizaki's power and strength. When the match resumed Haizaki full of new energy rushed towards Bergamo who was dribbling with the ball. They clashed together fighting and no one wanted to let it go. When Fudou appeared from behind to support Haizaki, Beragmo had to jump back to break free. The match was nearing its end when Nosaka proposed to use Last Resort. As he explained now it shouldn't strain so much their legs and they couldn't squander this opportunity. Haizaki doubted whether it would be successful and didn't want to be blamed in case of defeat. When they finally shot, Last Resort was easily stopped with new Spain's technique
   The Shelter
   . Later they decided to use their last chance and unexpectedly Asuto rushed through the field, passing all Spanish players. To everyone's surprise he managed to score the third goal for Japan, thanks which they tied 3-3.

   Before the upcoming match with
   Star Unicorn
   , the team decided to go to their camp to spy them. When they arrived and were introduced formally to
   Domon Asuka
   and
   Ichinose Kazuya
   ,
   Dylan Keith
   and
   Mark Kruger
   proposed a mini-game. The hissatsu techniques weren't allowed but Haizaki tricked Dylan pretending to use Overhead Penguin while he was passing him. Later Dylan repaid him the same when he was trying to use Unicorn Flash. The friendly match ended with Japan's winning after Endou scored a goal. Later unexpected guests appeared before the team. Three helicopters flew with
   Navy Invader
   team and their commander
   Bahat Descom
   on board. When American coach
   Mack Scride
   was arrested, Star Unicorn was forced to play in the match that would settle the representative team for America in the FFI tournament. Finally they lost when Navy Invader used
   Gunji Eisei Phobos
   and
   Jiraigen
   . Haizaki along with his teammates were watching this in disbelief. It was obvious that Navy Invader was connected with Orion and their actions were precisely planned. Before they left Bahat stated that he was looking forward to playing the match with Japan. They came back to their campground lost in thoughts, without saying a word. Later the team was informed about their new opponent and strange events that occurred in American camp. Haizaki made fun of Hiroto who kept talking about being god striker, although he was benched during the last match with Spain. When later
   Zeus
   ’ captain
   Aphrodi
   appeared before the team and pointed out their weaknesses, they wanted to teach him a lesson. Aphrodi challenged them in a mini-game 4 vs 4 however Sekiya stated that Haizaki wasn't going to participate due to the fatigue from the previous match. He snorted deeply disappointed because he wanted to face Aphrodi with the others.

   Before the match with Navy Invader started, Haizaki along with his teammates were looking at the opponent's players, stating that they were looking creepy. This time he was sitting on the bench but the events unfolded very fast when Navy Invader scored the first goal and later Japan tied thanks to Aphrodi's shot. When America used later tactic Jiraigen, Haizaki entered the field after
   Sakanoue Noboru
   was injured by the explosion, just like Hiura and Fudou before. Soon Nosaka and Aphrodi figured out how Jiraigen worked and deactivated it. The first half ended with Japan in the lead with 2 points. When the match resumed and Tatsuya fell on the ground losing the ball, Haizaki shouted at him what was he doing. However, later the same happened to him when
   Convoy
   and
   Shakey
   used clear wire to stop him. The match resumed after Navy Invaders scored the second goal and Japan counterattacked. Haizaki told Nosaka to give him the ball, however Aphrodi intercepted this pass and rushed further along with Hiroto, who mocked Haizaki. Later the duo along with Iwato created new technique
   GGG Senjou no Aria
   thanks which Japan scored the third goal.

  <p key="c86e0f8c-e0ae-4563-9c90-0c48f76d1da8">
   Unexpectedly Navy Invader's commander was arrested and replaced by Star Unicorn's coach Mack Scride. Later Ichinose along with Domon and Mark joined the opponent's team. Navy Invader's players, used to taking orders, now stood disoriented and confused. Haizaki along with Nosaka took the opportunity and rushed through the American goal. However, when Haizaki shot with his Shark The Deep, the Star Unicorn's trio appeared out of nowhere and blocked it. Soon after Ichinose called the disciples to destroy him in this match and Haizaki couldn't believe what he just heard, claiming that Ichinose was probably on the verge of desperation. As it turned out it was a strategy that helped Navy Invader to break through the field, at the same time involving them in game. Haizaki tried to steal the ball from
   Cobra
   , but he smartly passed him and moved on. Soon America tied with the score 3-3. When only five minutes were left, both teams fought trying to get another point. However, in the end Inazuma Japan won, when Aphrodi scored the 4th goal.

  <p key="fc4502bd-d5a2-43b7-b952-8093982f49eb">
   For Haizaki from the very beginning, Asuto's disappearance seemed to be very suspicious. He was wondering whether this man who Asuto met, was really his father. They all agreed that they should look for Asuto in the area and check what could happen. When the next day during the breakfast Nosaka asked the coach about Asuto and Zhao denied that something was wrong, Haizaki looked at them serious and thoughtful. Later Haizaki along with Nosaka kept practicing Last Resort, with Gouenji advising them what to do. New member of the team
   Kozoumaru Sasuke
   watched them and stated arrogantly that if it was all they got, he was the only one, who could inherit Last Resort.

   When the match against Russia began, Haizaki was sitting on the bench. Perfect Spark seemed to be playing fair however soon they showed up their true face. When they initiated tactic
   Aurora Wave
   it turned out that they used tear gas against the opponent. Haizaki praised later Saginuma's behavior when he broke Russian players' bands to prevent them from using dirty tricks. The match continued when Russia exchanged two players.
   As Inam
   ’s movements were strangely similar to Asuto's techniques and when he scored the second goal for Russia using
   Shining Bird
   , the matter was clear to everyone. Haizaki approached him along with Goujin, demanding explanations why Asuto betrayed the team. However, coach appeared and calmed them down, stating that they shouldn't cause any problems now, what's more, they didn't have any proof that it was Asuto himself. In the second half of the match, Russia took advantage of Japan's team distraction and successfully blocked all their attacks, using additionally underhanded methods. When the match was near to the end, coach let Haizaki enter the field along with Goujin and Aphrodi. Soon he managed to tie with Russia, when he scored the second goal with his Shark The Deep. But Russia didn't give up and kept using their dirty tricks, scoring the third goal after Japan's defenders and
   Umihara Norika
   were affected with sleeping gas. After the match the player who they thought was Asuto, revealed his face and turned out to be a person that they had never seen before. The whole team was dismayed after their loss but Haizaki stated that they couldn't change anything now. Later Sekiya informed them that Japan would play in the finals.
