In the day of the match against Mannouzaka, Tsurugi scores an auto goal to which Shindou was angry at Tsurugi, though after he realized that Mannouzaka's slide tackles would cause Matsukaze to break his leg and never play soccer again, which reminded Tsurugi of his brother, Tsurugi started helping out, and the other team members too along with Kurumada and the others. In the end, Shindou was able to shoot a hissatsu and won the match against Mannouzaka. After that, Shindou is worried about Kirino's foot because it got injured, though Kirino stated it was fine.

   shoot. Unfortunately, Tsurugi didn't arrive at the first half of the match, forcing Raimon having to play against Teikoku with only ten members

   Nozaki
   's ball. After that, the other members introduced themself and when Shindou heard that all the members haven't played soccer once, he got annoyed and angry and asked the trainer why this members were chosen if they can't even play soccer in which the trainer replied that he should ask the coach, who came in and introduced the managers,

   After that, they started practicing and having a break after practicing a bit, Shindou was seen resting out as well. After the break, Tenma explained more about soccer like dribbling and control where Shindou was just listening to Tenma. When Tenma was done, he was seen shooting balls to
   Ibuki
   , who couldn't stop them in which Shindou looked at him and started to think. When practice ended and everyone was tired, he was seen to be angry again as his hand turned into a fist and walked away which made Tenma worried about him. When they were in their rooms, Shindou asked if Tenma could go with him after he is done in which Tenma agreed. With Tsurugi and Tenma, Shindou went to Kuroiwa and asked why those eight players were in the national team. As Kuroiwa replied to him, Shindou said that they will play with only them three, Tsurugi as forward, Tenma as midfielder and Shindou himself as defender and when the opponent shoot to the goal, he will block the ball in which he was angry again and made Ibuki angry as well, who was about to practice when he heard the conversation.

   As Kuroiwa somehow agreed and walked away, Tenma asked Shindou if it will be alright with playing the match with three members, in which Shindou replied that the coach didn't understand soccer. Ibuki started to yell at him and said that the Japan goalkeeper was him, in which Shindou replied that he couldn't keep at all. Ibuki said that he will able to do it with practicing and asked Tsurugi to shoot at him, so he can stop it in which Shindou disagreed and said that he will shoot at him. Shindou used
   Fortissimo

The next day, Tenma tried to talk with Shindou again and tried to change Shindou's mind but failed to do so and made Shindou more angry and became also angry at Tenma and said that this were the nationals, so they should play their very best. The match between Inazuma Japan and Fire Dragon started with Shindou being placed as defensive midfielder. As the match started, Shindou became annoyed again when

As Tsurugi had a flashback, Shindou was seen in the flashback saying that they will play with only them three. When a member of Fire Dragon shot at the goal, Shindou stopped the shoot again, which made Ibuki angry again. As Shindou was standing there, Tenma had a flashback about the previous night. Shindou said in the flashback that Tenma and Tsurugi should bring the ball up and that he will protect the goal. Tenma was surprised in which Shindou stood up and said that he will stop Fire Dragon's shoots. Then, the flashback ended and Shindou passed the ball to Tenma. When Tsurugi lost the ball, Fire Dragon started to counterattack and Fire Dragon shot again. Shindou stopped it again which made Ibuki more furious. Ibuki said that said that Shindou should go out of the way but Shindou didn't listen.

   When Tenma was sliding tackled by two members of Fire Dragon, Shindou was worried about him. After that, Shindou went talking with Tenma and Tsurugi. As Matatagi wanted to join them, Tenma and Tsurugi agreed which shocked Shindou. After all, Shindou agreed too because Tenma and Tsurugi agreed. When Lee Chung-Yun shot with his
   Rapid Fire
   , he let the ball go to Ibuki but Ibuki failed to stop the ball, making the score 1-0. As the second half started, Shindou stood for the goal again which made Ibuki furious again. As Matatagi finally passed to

   Nozaki Sakura
   , Matatagi and Tsurugi were there. Shindou asked where the others were in which Nozaki replied that they weren't going to practice at all and Matatagi added that it was because of the match. It surprised Shindou and Tenma and when Kuroiwa came, Shindou became angry again of forming this team. Later, they went practicing and Nozaki showed her moves. Then, Shindou recognized her as a world class gymnastics ace which surprised Nozaki that Shindou knew her. Then, Nozaki said that she will keep training with playing soccer to play in the best gymnastics team, in which Shindou was dissappointed. When Nozaki ran off to be keeper, Shindou began to wonder again why she left her gymnastics team and joined the soccer team. Nozaki was scared for stopping the shoot which made Shindou dissappointed again. And as Matatagi started to practice to dribble in which he made a long gap between him and the ball, Shindou was disappointed again and said that this was no use to dribble.

  <p key="4226281d-c41f-4093-85cc-d31686202899">
   As both Nozaki and Matatagi went practicing there dribbling, Shindou said that Matatagi and Nozaki could be useful but it was still hard to be able to play in the match. As practice ended and Shindou and Tsurugi walked back, Shindou started a conversation with Tsurugi. Shindou went talking to Kuroiwa about his plan for the next match but Kuroiwa disagreed and Shindou left. The next morning, Shindou was at the training field already along with Matatagi and Nozaki. As Tenma went to search for the other members, Shindou started to practice with Matatagi and Nozaki. After practice, he went to talk with

The trainer said that he couldn't take it anymore and said that Kuroiwa was planning to take over the world with soccer. As the trainer said that and continued, Shindou overheard the whole conversation and began to wonder again.

  <p key="ec0ffaf4-6c8e-4ff6-96f3-78a559c84a21">
   The next day, finally the whole team was there, Shindou heard that Tenma had emailed them to come to the training field today and that was the reason why they were here. Then, Kuroiwa came and said that the members had to do a test if they wanted to leave the Japan team. After hearing that, Shindou was shocked and couldn't believe it.

   In
   episode 5
   , while the eight members were considering whether to take the test or not, Shindou stated the eight members didn't come to play soccer, and told them to take the test and get out of the team, which irritated Ibuki. While Tenma still tried to persuade Shindou that the eight members could play soccer with them, Tetsukado stated that he would take the test and said that Shindou would be happier without them around. As Shindou had already prepared, he went to the stadium but he was shocked at the view in front of him.

  <p key="e072f7bc-732c-4f1d-82cd-693dc5e54f4b">
   When the others arrived the stadium and saw the spectators, Tenma rushed to his side and asked him why, to which Shindou replied that Kuroiwa was the one who called the audience and news reporters to watch the withdrawal test, as Kuroiwa actually called them to see the Inazuma Japan's abilities, and he ran up with the others to watch the withdrawal test, and he kept silent most of the time. In the end of the withdrawal test, Kuroiwa told Shindou that the successful shoots of each member showed the powers of supportive words from supporters and friend alike, to which Shindou did not reply at all.

   In
   episode 6
   , Shindou oversaw the training and when a ball that Ibuki blocked out flew to him, Ibuki argued that he didn't need his help, in which Shindou retorted that he was only doing what was necessary for victory. While the others discussed about their strategy to use against
   Big Waves
   , Shindou stated they didn't have enough time for that.
  </p>
  <p key="14e02f95-3fde-4add-ad9b-03d9ab4cd729">
   While they were training before the match started, Ibuki blocked a normal shoot from Tsurugi and stated that he won't allow scoring anymore, to which Shindou retorted that it would be different when they are having a real match. When the match was about to start, Shindou stood in front of Ibuki, and he retorted that Shindou's position was too far behind, while Shindou stated that it was just the right position.
  </p>
  <p key="cffc7502-ef62-49fe-906c-ff00b954895e">
   After seeing some efforts the team was paying, Shindou thought to himself that at least the team would work well for victories. He then called Tenma to pass to him, and used Kami no Takuto and commanded Sakura, Kusaka, Matatagi and Tenma to pass the ball and at the end, to Tsurugi, who used
   Bicycle Sword
   . He then used Kami no Takuto once again but it got cut off when Big Waves used
   Suck Out
   on Kusaka. Shindou was shocked, and Kuroiwa stated that it was Shindou's mistake for showing Kami no Takuto too early. Shindou ran back to the defence and stole the ball, and he used Kami no Takuto again, only to be cut off after Sakura passed to Matatagi, when Big Waves used Suck Out again. Shindou tried to use Kami no Takuto again, and failed again after Tenma's passing was cut off. The trio gathered to discuss, and Shindou stated that it was strange since Big Waves was supposed to be a highly offensive team, and concluded that Kami no Takuto was entirely locked.

   After the match resumed, Shindou blocked a ball and passed it to Tenma, who was about to pass to Matatagi but get blocked by Sakura, who failed to dribble up. Shindou blocked back the ball and told Sakura not to stand too far away from her position. When Kusaka passed to Sakura, a few Big Waves players targeted her, and she tried to pass to Shindou but got blocked. Shindou attempted to steal back the ball but it was passed to Cole, who scored another goal with Megalodon. When Cole was about to use Megalodon again, Shindou rushed towards him and kept on trying to block him, without any effort. Shindou was also shown to be little shocked when Ibuki pulled out
   Wild Dunk
   . When Ibuki asked Shindou if he saw his hissatsu, he said that it was only something the goalkeeper ought to do.

   In
   episode 7
   , Shindou walked back to the defence position, which irriated Ibuki because Shindou still didn't acknowledge him. Tenma asked Shindou to take a look on the team, that the team has fired up, but Shindou told him that Kami no Takuto was totally locked, and asked him what he could do about it, and he agreed with Tenma's solution, saying that this is the only way.
  </p>
  <p key="75ebf43b-9221-40c5-8654-9bc8339c3504">
   After the match resumed, he received a pass from Ibuki, but stated that Ibuki's pass is still far from good. When he was about to get blocked, Shindou used
   Presto Turn V2
   and passed the ball to Tenma, but the ball got blocked by Sakura, who tried to use hissatsu to showcase herself, but was blocked. Shindou tackled the ball out of the field and demanded what Sakura was doing. When Sakura told the others that she felt dizzy and was sorry that she caused trouble, and Tsurugi suggested that they could only switch positions, Shindou stated that they should have prepared substitute players, and glanced accusingly at Kuroiwa. After Tenma has a temporary conversation with Sakura again, Shindou told him to go back to his position.

  <p key="5446f39a-8754-4f41-b368-e8c3a7144f38">
   When Cole commanded all his teammates except goalkeeper to offence, Shindou thought that just to keept their defence was already hard enough and what they should do, and he tackled a player but the ball got back to Big Waves again. Shindou was also shown to be a little shocked when Ibuki was about to block the normal shoot and Megalodon, but told Ibuki to throw the ball back to the field immediately after he blocked Megalodon. When Matatagi scored a goal with
   Parkour Attack
   , he was shocked that Matatagi used a hissatsu to score a goal. When Sakura got trapped by Suck Out, she asked Shindou to use Kami no Takuto. Shindou told her that it was impossible, but she insisted. Shindou used Kami no Takuto, but Sakura failed to reach it. Shindou scolded her that she may might be able to pass if she did not thought about jumping higher than his command. When Tenma encouraged Sakura, Shindou commented that it was truly Tenma's style. Sakura asked him to do this again, Shindou used Kami no Takuto FI instead, and questioned her if she could really follow the tactic, and was shown to be impressed when Sakura succeeded. After the match ended, Shindou wondered if the team actually possess horrifying potential, and looked to Kuroiwa for answer, but he only walked away accompanied with Mizukawa.

When Tenma commented that it is possible to access to the world stage with their current members, Shindou challenged him, saying that they are still newcomers despite all the trainings. Tenma brought out some examples about their process, but Shindou retorted, stating that the abilities of Manabe, Minaho and Morimura remained unknown, and Kusaka was still unable to dribble. Tenma tried to told him that it was not true, but Shindou told him that the world stage is not as simple as he thought, and then he walked away.

Shindou continued to explain that if his violence caused the match to stop, then everything would be over. After Tenma tried to reject this on Kusaka's behalf, Shindou asked the others what should they do in this current situation. Manabe and Minaho agreed to this, while Sakura doubted about this option. After listening to Tenma's pleading to let everybody on the team to play the match, Shindou demanded him if they could win in this situation, and Tenma, unable to answer, stated he understood.

He said to Tetsukado that his moves have gotten much sharper but that he need to improve more as his speed was dropping. He adviced that Tetsukado should move more to the front and left the field.

Shindou said that the only to score a goal was to use Kami no Takuto with higher precision, in which Tenma replied that he should do it. The match resumed and Tenma stole the ball back and told Shindou that it was time. Shindou used
   Kami no Takuto FI
