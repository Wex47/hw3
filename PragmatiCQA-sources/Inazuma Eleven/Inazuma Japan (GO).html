But then, eight unknown players until now were announced, surprising the whole audience and the other teams' members. They formed a line ahead of their coach, who told them to aim for the world title of the best young soccer team, and said there would be an exhibition match in ten minutes.

In addition, during the match, Sakura continuously tried to show off herself, thus blocking others' passes and disrupted their pattern.

This is due to Morimura, Manabe, and Minaho not being capable of defending against the Mach Tiger players. Morimura dared not to block the players, while Manabe and Minaho were too busy analyzing and calculating to block the players. During the rest of the match, Kusaka confessed his feelings to Morimura, which shocked everyone. Morimura stated that she was not ready for that, but she was obviously much better now. After hearing encouragements from Kusaka, she started chasing Mach Tiger's players. By running very fast, she developed her block hissatsu

However, Manabe started to lose his concentration when he saw his father came to watch the tournament. Manabe started arguing with Minaho after he realized what was wrong with Manabe, stating that he had a loving father. Though Minaho told him the real truth was that his father died long ago. After Minaho convinced Manabe that he still had a target to fulfill, he regained confidence. The duo then started to cooperate with each other and used their skills to be the strategists of the team.

   They are the last opponent of Inazuma Japan. Storm Wolf's forward,
    Maxim Adrov
    quickly scored a goal with
   Gold Fever
   at the beginning of the match, which discouraged Ibuki. Due to the training in the
    Black Room
    , Inazuma Japan was able to cope up with Storm Wolf's play. However, all players tried to play solo instead of cooperating with each other, and all were blocked by
   Rolling Cutter
   continously. As Gold Fever scored another goal against Inazuma Japan, Ibuki realized his mistake: not cooperating with the others. As Maxim shot Gold Fever again, Ibuki used
   Wild Dunk
   in a desperate attempt and blocked the shoot, but
    Ruslan Kasimov
    tried to make it in. Ibuki then finally asked Shindou for help, who used
   <a href="Einsatz.html" key="a5edbc64-3b5f-4bca-bd05-1033e79eb3dc" title="Einsatz">

   and kept out the ball. The others also realized their mistakes and cooperated with each other in passing and defending, and Ibuki mastered a new hissatsu:
    Rising Slash
    , which successfully blocked Gold Fever. Tenma then passed the ball to Tsurugi, who scored a goal with

   In the second half, however, Storm Wolf's players' movements improved and Inazuma Japan was held back. Maxim also scored another goal as
    Dmitri Sobirov
    feigned a shoot and Maxim headered the ball in. The team was dispirited of the score, but was encouraged by Tenma as he said he didn't want this to be their last match. Dmitri then scored another goal with Gold Fever, but Tenma told the team that they could score two goals together. The team followed Manabe and Minaho's strategy, which involved passing the ball back to Ibuki, who threw it back to the advancing team and Tenma scored a goal with
   <a href="God Wind.html" key="30d2f204-f46a-4920-98e6-fa4a3af19ae9" title="God Wind">
    God Wind
   </a>
   . Then Manabe calculated the seconds needed for the Storm Wolf players to clear off the shooting path and Tsurugi scored the fourth goal using

   . As Storm Wolf attacked again, they passed the ball straight to another player who was about to pass Konoha, and she surprisingly tackled the player with some aura of her

   . She passed the ball to Tenma and he used
   Z Slash
   to get another player, and passed the ball to Matatagi who shot
