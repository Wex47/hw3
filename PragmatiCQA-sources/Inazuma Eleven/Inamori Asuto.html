However, Haizaki broke the talk up quickly since he had somewhere to be and walked away, leaving Asuto behind. Inakuni Raimon later watched the match between Seishou Gakuen and

   Before Inakuni Raimon were able to play their match against
   Mikage Sennou
   , their coach got arrested for unauthorized access, leaving the team shocked and surprised. As the match started, they had no idea what they should exactly do without the instructions of their coach. Zhao Jin Yun luckily managed to send some instructions from the jail to Inakuni Raimon's Eleven Bands, resulting in Asuto scoring the first goal for Inakuni Raimon after receiving the ball from
   Hiyori Masakatsu
   who used his new hissatsu,
   Shooting Cut
   , to get the ball. Asuto then received an instruction that was meant for him through the Eleven Band and decided to dribble forward with the ball where he used
   Inabikari Dash
   to get pass two defenders. Receiving more instructions from their coach, Inakuni Raimon was able to win their third Football Frontier kanto match with a score of 4-0. After the match, Asuto met

The kick-off started and Asuto was surprised about Teikoku's movements and Asuto's teammates started to move up to which Asuto stated that they moved up too much. Asuto managed to pick up a loose ball and used his hissatsu, Inabikari Dash, to get past

   To make it to the national block of the Football Frontier, Inakuni Raimon had to face one more opponent in their kanto block and they had to win that match as well to be sure to have a spot in the top 2. Asuto decided to watch Seishou Gakuen's match and saw Haizaki wasn't playing, surprising him. Haizaki then approached Asuto and said he won't be playing against a weak team but
   Nosaka Yuuma
   and

Haizaki didn't tell him either when he walked away and Asuto then received a call from Michinari who told him that their opponent had to withdraw and that their next opponent would be Seishou Gakuen again. Later that evening, Asuto talked to Hiura and
   Mansaku Yuuichirou
   about the conversation he heard earlier between Haizaki and Nosaka. After the talk, Asuto received a letter from Yone who was from his deceased mother, telling him about his past and his dad. The next day, Inakuni Raimon trained for their rematch against Seishou Gakuen.

  <p key="591d2e53-b6ba-4053-9afb-86a53742948d">
   Seishou Gakuen quickly took the lead with Haizaki scoring three goals for them. Asuto clashed with Haizaki several times but was unable to take the ball. After the third goal for Seishou Gakuen, Asuto started to help defend as well, preventing Haizaki from scoring another goal and sliding tackling his opponents and the first half ended with Inakuni Raimon unable to score a goal. During half time, Asuto motivated his teammates to still have fun in soccer even though they're losing at the moment. The second half started and Inakuni Raimon's movements changed as they quickly scored their first goal with Kozoumaru's Fire Tornado. While Asuto approached the goal to score the second goal,
   Mizukamiya Seiryuu
   tried to stop him and he failed as Asuto managed to pass the ball to one of his teammates but Asuto injured his leg while doing that. After their second goal, they used their tactics,
   Marionette Attack
   , to disturb Seishou Gakuen's plays and Asuto proceeded to score the third goal for Inakuni Raimon. However, due to his injury, Asuto wasn't able to keep up with Seishou Gakuen's plays but he weakened Haizaki's Overhead Penguin, so Norika was able to catch it with
   Uzumaki The Hand
   . Near the end of the match, Asuto went to his coach and he received an acupressure treatment from him for his leg injury, which caused to temporary feel no pain from it. Because of that, Asuto played with everything he had got and scored the fourth goal with
   Meteor Drop
   , which was a combination hissatsu with Hiura and Kozoumaru, and the fifth and winning goal with his new hissatsu,
   Shining Bird
   . While Inakuni Raimon celebrated their victory and their place in the top two of their block, Asuto talked with Haizaki about his plays and the match.

   After their win, Inakuni Raimon was training a day before the opening ceremony for the national block of the Football Frontier. Nosaka decided to pay Inakuni Raimon a visit and Asuto talked to Nosaka about doing their best in their matches, only with Nosaka to respond that he dislikes his soccer. Being one of the teams that made it, they were present at the opening ceremony and Asuto gave a small speech during the press conference. Their first opponent was

Asuto saw that Norika was a bit depressed and asked what's wrong with her to which she responded that she wasn't able to stop the shoots and that she should become a goalkeeper that can stop those shoots. After some training, Asuto visited Seishou Gakuen to talk to Haizaki about the last match he played but Haizaki brushed him off. Asuto then returned to the Kogarashi Manor and saw that Norika left directly after dinner to train, which caused him to eat quickly as well so that he could train to. They started their match against Hakuren and Asuto, Kozoumaru and Norika immediately used Hokkyoku Guma 2gou after the kick-off but it was stopped by Atsuya's
   Hissatsu Kumagoroshi Baku
   , which surprised them. After the defense started to fall apart due to some arguing, Asuto decided to defend in order to help his teammates. Right after the Fubuki brothers scored the second goal with
   White Double Impact
   , Asuto tied the score 2-2 with a strong normal.
   Shiratoya Nae
   got switched in and Asuto and his teammates were surprised about the fact that she wasn't able to play soccer properly by missing passes but she proved otherwise by scoring two more goals for Hakuren, the second goal with the help of the Fubuki brothers with
   Triple Blizzard
   . Despite being behind again, Asuto received the ball from Hiura, who used Koori no Ya, and proceeded to use Shining Bird to score the third goal for Inakuni Raimon. He was also happy for Norika when she used her new hissatsu,
   Mermaid Veil
   , to stop Triple Blizzard successfully. Atsuya then used
   Hissatsu Kumagoroshi Zan
   , trying to score the winning goal for Hakuren, but instead Asuto and Kozoumaru used
   Counter Drive
   and reflected the shoot to Hakuren's goal instead, causing Inakuni Raimon to win the match with a score of 5-4.

Kidou and Haizaki came to their clubroom and Kidou revealed that Haizaki will be their eleventh member, surprising the team. After school, Asuto and some others went to visit Michinari in the hospital to see how he was doing and Michinari wanted Asuto to be the captain for the final match, which he accepted.

His teammates were surprised that he easily passed the ball to them and said that he should focus. While Shining Satans advanced towards Japan's goal, Asuto mentioned that the team weren't like the players in the video Ichihoshi showed them. When Shining Satans used their tactics,
   Invisible
   , Asuto was wondering what kind of tactics that was. After Japan conceded two goals,

   </a>
   arrived and told Zhao Jin Yun to send an order to the players to close their eyes. Asuto did what he said and closed his eyes, successfully stealing the ball from
   Sar Gatanas
   . Inazuma Japan then used their tactics, Juu to Gou, and Asuto passed the ball to Kidou, who used Overhead Penguin to score a goal for Inazuma Japan. After the kick-off, Asuto and Haizaki were blinded by something, so they weren't able to stop
   As Taroth
   . The first half then ended with Shining Satans being in the lead with a score of 1-3. The second half started and Asuto noticed Haizaki and Hiroto's weird passes they were doing to Ichihoshi. As the game advanced, Asuto was wondering if Haizaki and Hiroto were doing that on purpose and what was going on with the match. He went to
   Sakanoue Noboru
   and asked him if he was part of it as well but he had no idea what Asuto was talking about. After Ichihoshi was hit by The Explosion, he went to him and aksed if he was alright. Hearing his side of the story, Asuto went to Kidou and asked if it were his orders. Kidou didn't answer and walked away while Asuto stated that this wasn't soccer with Haizaki saying that he didn't get it at all.

   used his blade hidden in his cleats and cut Sakanoue, which caused Asuto to be worried about him. Before
   Satan Gaul
   was able to score another goal with
   Time Trance
   , Asuto stole the ball from him, stating that he will play soccer fairly, and passed the ball to Hiura. After Endou managed to stop Time Trance with

   </a>
   , Inazuma Japan quickly tied the score with Perfect Penguin, The Explosion and a new override,
   Death Crusher Zone
   . Kidou, Haizaki and Hiroto kept hitting Ichihoshi with their passes, so Asuto decided to take one on purpose which caused him to be immobilized for a bit, receiving some first aid. He then stated to the trio that soccer wasn't something you should use to throw out anger and hatred to each other, that would make soccer not soccer anymore with Ichihoshi thanking to Asuto for helping him. After both Asuto and Ichihoshi were treated, the winning goal was quickly scored with
   Penguin The God &amp; Devil
   .

   After the match, the Inakuni group went to Asuto and wondered if he was okay, also stating that something was off with the match. The team went to the locker room and celebrated their victory while Kidou caused some uproar with accusing Ichihoshi for everything bad that has happened to the team. Some people from the FFI administration bureau entered their locker room and searched through the belongings of the players when they found doping drugs with Kidou's stuff. They took Kidou with them, shocking the team, and Ichihoshi entered the room. Haizaki quickly grabbed his shirt and Asuto tried to stop him but that didn't work, so Endou calmed Haizaki down instead, saying that he would be banned from playing too. Ichihoshi then thanked him for helping him and that made him able to dispose of a nuisance, shocking Asuto. After Ichihoshi left, Haizaki blamed him for what had happened to Kidou. The next day, Asuto spied on Ichihoshi when he was sitting on a bench near the lake. Haizaki and Hiroto approached him and he and Goujin stopped the duo from causing more uproar. Some days later, their next opponent was revealed to be Uzbekistan,
   Eternal Dancers
   , who were a stamina team. The team were divided in teams to do a relay race for their training. They were exhausted when they were finally finished and thinking that they finally could get some rest, Kazemaru wanted them to do a different training. Some time later, Endou got arrested after he encountered some guys, which shocked the team, making Endou not being the goalkeeper for the match.

   The day of the match arrived and Asuto couldn't believe that Endou wasn't playing but Kazemaru stated that Nishikage was comparable to Endou's goalkeeping skills. The match started and Inazuma Japan quickly conceded two goals, making the score 0-2 in the first half.
