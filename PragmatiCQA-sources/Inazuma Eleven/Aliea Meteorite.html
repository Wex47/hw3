   Exposure to the Aliea Meteorite has a number of effects and consequences for humans. Although those exposed to the rock becomes physically stronger and more endurable, they also become aggressive and extremely obsessed with power, willing to do anything to become stronger and prove themselves superior. Their memories of themselves before exposure begins to fade, and in some cases their physical features (such as hair and eyes) change.
Defeat, despite being empowered by the rock, seems to be able to pull exposed people out of their trance. All the negative effects of the rock fades away over time, if kept away from it.
