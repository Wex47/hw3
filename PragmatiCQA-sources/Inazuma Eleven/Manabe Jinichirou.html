   He uses his logic a lot, which is often useful. Initially, he is also very arrogant. Manabe seems to hate being controlled by his parents because they always forced him to study; this is why he joins Inazuma Japan. However, it was later revealed by Minaho in
   episode 13
   that he doesn't hate his parents but himself for being unable to meet their expectations.
  </p>
  <p key="4d885ff0-f01b-4e33-8962-1a8138ac27fa">
   He has a rivalry with Minaho at the start of the series because both of them have different points of view on solving things: Manabe uses calculations while Minaho prefers deductive reasoning. Due to this, they argue easily. After episode 13, however, he and Minaho start to get along and are usually the ones who help the team to break through challenges.

Then, all of his calculations on the movements of the opponents failed and Mach Tiger scored another goal. Minaho then told Manabe that after studying his behaviour, Minaho concluded that the reason why Manabe was like that was because he wanted his father to acknowledge him. At first, Manabe denied this but after Minaho told him about his past and being encouraged by Tenma, Manabe was able to realize that his father doesn't hate him. He later heard his father's words as both him and Minaho cooperated together by using their abilities to observe and calculate Mach Tiger's players' movement. He unleashed his hissatsu,
   Defense Houteishiki
   and successfully stole the ball from
   Sarit Charat
   . After Inazuma Japan tied the score, the other members were able to pass through their opponents thanks to his and Minaho's commands. When the match ended with Inazuma Japan winning, he thanked Minaho and both of them reconciled.

   Storm Wolf
   . They noticed that the tension of the team was different than before because Storm Wolf used to be specialized in playing calmly. In the match against
   Resistance Japan
   , he was shocked when he saw the chain shoot of
   White Hurricane
   and
   Panther Blizzard
   which easily scored the first goal. Just like other 7 members of Inazuma Japan, he couldn't believe that he got overwhelmed and was not able to catch up to Resistance Japan.

   again, both him and Minaho agreed to protect the goal together. However, after Tetsukado failed to block
   Maxim Adrov
   , both had different plans and they ran separated directions, opening a straight way for the Storm Wolf forward to score the goal. Fortunately, he was blocked by Shindou. When
   Ruslan Kasimov
   dribbled to the defense line, Manabe and Minaho attempted to stop him but Tetsukado ran up instead, but he failed. After Ibuki finally asked Shindou to assist him, Manabe and all the other members realized their mistakes. It was proved when everybody cooperated with each other to dribbling, and Manabe and Minaho blocked
   Aaron Gachinsky
   . Manabe and Minaho also attempted to block
   Maxim Adrov
   after Ibuki asked them to do so, and Ibuki complimented them during the break, but the duo thought that it sounded more like complimenting himself, and everybody laughed.

   , he and Minaho both noted that Storm Wolf's movements were different compared to the first half. He, like the others, failed to block Storm Wolf's players due to their different movements. While all the other members were further discouraged, Tenma told them that he didn't want this to be the last match, which shocked them. After Kusaka's speech, he and Minaho stated that both of them also changed because of the team. While the others thought about the two scores, Tenma encouraged them, saying that they could score two goals together, and Manabe stated that it was possible. After Tenma's goal, he was signaled by Minaho to start their strategy and it succeeded with Tsurugi scoring a goal. He was shocked to see Konoha unleashing some of her
   Soul
   aura. He was also shocked to see the members of Storm Wolf revealing themselves as aliens and seeing the spaceship above the stadium.
