   ) is the name given to children possessing various psychic powers and increased physical abilities; their psychic powers include things such as levitation or telekinesis. A Second Stage Child is created by the presence of the SSC gene (Second Stage Children gene), a form of gene mutation that began in the DNA of strong soccer players around 200 years prior to the current Second Stage Children, as seen in cases such as

   . As Raimon's players were saying they could save Endou Mamoru themselves and that they wouldn't team up with El Dorado, Toudou told them what was happening in their era.
  </p>
  <p key="4990efeb-3a6c-4a21-8d2c-a28bec96d7d2">
   Firstly, he said El Dorado is in a war against Feida. He explained to them Second Stage Children's DNA has a gene called SSC. It makes them have an incredible intelligence and extraordinary physical abilities. Some of them are telepaths and their senses are higher than human's ones, who couldn't have Second Stage Children's powers.
  </p>
  <p key="5eb2221a-adb8-402d-8ead-2f247ffed3da">
   However, one year ago, an organization called Feida, made up of Second Stage Children, started a war against El Dorado to control the whole world. Hearing this, Shindou asked why Feida started a war. Toudou answered they wanted to be world leaders to create a world which would belong to them. He added their existence was the symbol of the revenge they wanted to take against the ones who could not accept them as they are.
  </p>
  <p key="cf2fe45c-e44d-412c-b55b-d7a9251f04f5">
   Sakamaki added Second Stage Children can't become adults because they die when they're about 20 years old. So, they want to rule the world before dying. Consequently, El Dorado has to use all its power to fight against Feida, so the world would not be controlled by them. Their intentions are to create a world where only Second Stage Children would live in, so the humanity would completely disappear. After explaining this to Raimon, Toudou said they have to team up with El Dorado to fight against Feida in Ragnarok, a tournament in which 3 soccer matches will be held to decide who would rule the world.

   Near the end of the episode, the three El Dorado teams captains and coaches were seen with Toudou Heikichi. He told them El Dorado's institute of science had found a vaccine to cure Second Stage Children and erase the powers they are given by the SSC gene. However, Sakamaki added Feida's members would not take the vaccine as the only thing which preoccupied Saryuu was to rule the world.
