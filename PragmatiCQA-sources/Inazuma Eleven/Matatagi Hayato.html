   . One of his friends asked him to bring his younger brothers and play with everyone in his class but he refused. He later talked to his brothers and they agreed in going and he went to talk to his friend. However, he didn't let him join because Matatagi didn't have a race car. Luckily, he found a raffle and won a racecar. When he brought it to play with everyone, they all paid attention to the race car and didn't care about his presence. After that, he was really frustrated of being betrayed by those who said that they were his friends and threw it into the sea. Ever since then, Matatagi could never believe in "friends" and developed a strong distrust towards other people.

  <p key="d3420249-8052-4684-8ab5-03b2706713fc">
   There was another time when his two younger brothers unintentionally stole food because of hunger so Matatagi took the blame to protect them. The incident made other people lose their trust with him. Whenever someone heard about an incident, they would look at him with disdain. This could have made him distrust people even more.
