   , Hiroto is quite tall, he has a fair skin tone and a messy, short, seaweed-like gray hair with some bangs tinted white. He has pale red eyes and a blue lightning-shaped tattoo that covers from his left cheek up to his left eyebrow. His casual clothes consists of a striped black shirt, as well as pants and shoes of the same color. He also wore a silver ring on his right hand, several bracelets on his right wrist, one in the left and a silver pendant around his neck.

   , Hiroto acted as a spoiled brat because he thought that his father wouldn't scold or care about what he did. Deep down, he actually yearnt for family love. He tried to be recognized by his father, but eventually gave up and acted as if he didn't care about soccer at all when in fact, he really loves soccer. This results in his subtle thought of having no dream to achieve.
  </p>
  <p key="52790951-f4b0-4245-b6d3-ae0ccba104d2">
   Hiroto was always practising soccer alone since he was trapped in his house, resulting in his superior individual play. However at the same time, he has no social connection and doesn't know how to act in a group. Tatsuya and everyone in Ohisama En has helped him to realize his dream and passion. Even if Hiroto doesn't have a dream for himself, his dream is to support others' dream.
  </p>
  <p key="0c377a8e-ea66-4d9d-a543-a6e430cacf04">
   Like any other forwards, Hiroto shows confidence in his strike skills and often arrogantly compares himself to "god". However, he always expresses his supports to others without hesitation and sees his rivals fairly. Like Haizaki, his tone is harsh and mock.

   Not much is known about Hiroto since he only appeared in flashbacks, but he loved soccer and wished to be a professional soccer player. However, 10 years ago, while studying soccer abroad, Hiroto was killed mysteriously and the actual cause of his death was never revealed. The case was then closed as an accidental death due to a government official's son being somehow involved. This caused his father,
   Kira Seijirou
   , great grief and sadness which made him want to revenge over the soccer world.
   Kiyama Hiroto
   was also named after him.

   Hiroto appeared at the ceremony where the members of

   were announced. He was sitting at the stands with his teammates from
   Eisei Gakuen
   and behaved like he didn't care about anything but clearly sure that he should be selected. As he stated the team without him as a God Striker couldn't call itself representative. He was right indeed because later was announced as a forward of Inazuma Japan, together with
   Kiyama Tatsuya
   as a midfielder and
   Saginuma Osamu
   as a goalkeeper. He smiled satisfied when Tatsuya told him happy that it was good to be working with him again. The new team went later to the

   Diamond Ray
   . Although he beat Japan's team he appreciated that their level raised up. Clario also revealed them that one of the Japanese players amazed him during the training and he decided to return to Spain, in order to practice more. When the players stood stunned and depressed, Hiroto laughed mockingly as if it didn't impressed him at all.

Hiroto responded in his style, stating that coach finally realized that he need him and it should have been done in the first place. What more the whole world would prostrate before him as a God Striker.
   Haizaki Ryouhei
   looked at Hiroto and made fun of what he just said. Hiroto didn't care about that and told Haizaki not to drag him down, calling him Mr Devil of the Field. But it was just the beginning of their rivalry. Hiroto started to play, saying with irony that would crush the opponent before they could even blink. So he was running towards the goal together with Haizaki, but to everyone's surprise they began to pass the ball with a lot of strength like they would like to try what they could afford. Near to the goal their pass was intercepted by Korea's captain

   The Explosion

   Tokkou Buffalo Train

Unexpectedly Lee and Park tackled their own captain and Hiroto with Haizaki watched this, stating that it was wrong but they forgot that were doing the same before. At the end of the match Japan regained the ball using their tactic

   new powerful technique
   thanks to their shoot Inazuma Japan won with 3 points. When Asuto came to praise them for what they've done, they went away angry and offended in different directions, not wanting to have anything to do with each other. Later in the evening the team gathered at the camp talking about Gouenji and their match. Asuto found an article about them in which Haizaki and Hiroto were mentioned as a God and Devil. But it wasn't something they wanted to hear. They started insulting, denying that they were connected or being synchronized in the game. They took their bags and returned to the room, which they unluckily shared together.

   Before the next match with Australian team
   Shining Satans
   coach Zhao informed that he didn't obtain any data about the opponent. Inazuma Japan decided to practice on their own and improve their weak points. Hiroto and Haizaki were training together to perfect their shot Penguin The God &amp; Devil but they couldn't synchronize and started to blame each other. Haizaki told that Hiroto was too slow, and Hiroto responded that Haizaki was impatient. They were arguing and insulting so Tatsuya had to calm them down. At the end Haizaki stated that Hiroto didn't put in the work and he wasn't going to practice with him anymore. He left leaving Hiroto angry and irritated. Later Hiroto met with
   Ichihoshi Mitsuru
   who told him that he understood how he felt. Mitsuru was outraged by Haizaki's behavior, who apparently had no respect for his older colleagues. Hiroto listened him, surprised that he got it but at the end he said that actually Haizaki always annoyed him so he wasn't bothered.

   The match with Australia from the beginning seemed to be not as expected, starting from their different appearance to strange behavior during the game. After they quickly scored the first goal, Japan's team began to wonder what was going on and if they were really devils. Hiroto didn't care about that as usual, stating that he would show them that god's power was greater than devils’. Haizaki smiled maliciously and said that Hiroto couldn't beat him, called the devil as well, not even talking to deal with others. Later Hiroto interrupted Australian way thanks which

They all agreed that Hiroto's irregular plays interfered Australian strategy and no one at the stadium or the bench noticed anything unusual, except players on the field. It was later revealed that Australian trick was hypnosis. When Inazuma Japan figured out how to break it, Shining Satans started to use mirrors hidden in their cleats. When they blinded Japan's players, Haizaki realized that Ichihoshi might be the traitor and cooperated with them so

Right after the second half of the match began, they took the ball and started to shot at Ichihoshi. Their behavior was something unexpected, at first glance it looked like a random shot, but the duo kept aiming at Ichihoshi with more and more strength and determination.

   Sar Gatanas
   Hiroto decided to crush Australian players as well and later he used The Explosion against Ichihoshi. When Australia replaced players on

There was only 5 minutes remaining to the end of the match but Hiroto with Haizaki kept aiming at Ichihoshi, instead of focus on the real game. When Asuto decided to stop this unfair play, he got hit and along Ichihoshi left the field. Later he explain why he did it and Haizaki stated that he was naive with Hiroto calling him sneeringly goody two-shoes. When the match resumed Kidou passed them the ball which was the last chance for them to become true ace strikers supporting the team. They warned each other not to let any of them delay or be impatient and one more time shot with their Penguin God &amp; Devil thanks which Japan won this match. When the match ended they both tried in their way to admit that it was a successful shot, but when Endou came and praised them for great synchronizations and counted on them in the next match, they turned away offended again.

   Later in the locker room Kidou revealed all his suspicions about Ichihoshi and told the team about his strange behavior. Just right after Inazuma Japan agreed to eliminate Ichihoshi from them, Kidou was accused of doping when some pills were found in his locker by the FFI administration bureau employee. Later Hiroto and Haizaki decided to confront Ichihoshi and approached him while he was sitting at the lake. He managed to avoid Haizaki's punches so Hiroto grabbed him from behind and encouraged Haizaki to hit him. Suddenly

When Ichihoshi kept teasing with Haizaki, Hiroto was wondering if he didn't provoke him on purpose since they noticed a strange man with camera, hidden in the bushes. Coach Zhao came suddenly and told them not to hurt Ichihoshi, stating that he should be considered as innocent until his guilty was proven. This was already too much for Hiroto and Haizaki.

   It was revealed that the next Japan's opponent would be Uzbekistan's team

The team participated in a special relay race, prepared by their coach Zhao. Later in the locker room Endou asked Hiroto and Haizaki to get along with Ichihoshi. Although Endou was their captain, they weren't going to change anything, stating that Ichihoshi was the enemy, considering all what he's done so far. Haizaki was wondering if Endou was an idiot and Hiroto said that he was just that type of straightforward person. When Endou was unexpectedly arrested after some strangers attacked him at the street,
   Kazemaru Ichirouta
   stated that it was planned and Hiroto was wondering what was going on in that tournament. The match began and Kazemaru told to players to calm down but then he looked at Hiroto and Haizaki, stating that they were going to be a problem. When Haizaki lost the ball, Hiroto was angry and insulted him. After Uzbekistan scored the first goal, they were arguing and picking at every word. The first half ended with Inazuma Japan losing with 2 points. When unexpectedly
   Nosaka Yuuma
   appeared before the team, their mood changed right away. After the match resumed they followed Nosaka's instructions and Hiroto with Haizaki easily scored the first goal for Japan. When later Japan tied, Uzbekistan started to play rough and Hiroto was hit by
   Onakhon Ims
   . Nosaka decided to use
   Grid Omega ver2.0

   Farhad Gilik
   . Luckily Haizaki kicked the ball further to Asuto, who scored the 4th goal for Japan.
When Endou left the arrest the team was talking about strange events that occurred during the FFI tournament and Hiroto was wondering which of them would be taken off next. Later coach Zhao revealed them that The
   Orion Foundation
   was trying to take control on soccer and the results of the matches. They also had their spies among the other teams, just like Ichihoshi in Inazuma Japan. When Endou revealed the true about Ichihoshi's past, Hiroto and Haizaki were against helping him, stating that he committed a despicable acts, which was unforgivable. Later

When the match resumed Hiroto was trying to shot another goal with The Explosion but Saudi Arabia's goalkeeper

When the first half of the match ended, he left the field in total breakdown. The team kept asking what was he doing and Hiroto stated that because Ichihoshi's brother was sick, he was obeying to the Orion Foundation, to get money for his surgery. Hiroto offered him lending money from his father
   Kira Seijirou
   . When Ichihoshi explained that he wouldn't be able to repay such amount, Hiroto stated that soccer was a well-developed business and in case of their winning, they would be rewarded by the sponsors with a prize money. Besides there was no doubts that Inazuma Japan was going to win this tournament. Later it was revealed that in fact Ichihoshi's brother was dead and Ichihoshi assumed his personalities, being now two persons in one mind. To much Hiroto's and Haizaki's surprise Endou agreed to let Ichihoshi continue play in match and the whole team accepted it. Later they kept passing the ball to Ichihoshi to involve him in playing. This strategy was successful because Ichihoshi managed to pull himself together and united with his brother. At the end of the match he passed to Hiroto and Haizaki, who scored later the second goal for Japan. Later in the evening the whole team gathered around Ichihoshi who was going to leave the camp and ensured him of their support.

Later they were surprised by the unusual game of Chinese players, who were passing the ball using handstands and acrobatic tricks. They were also teasing with Japan's team, at the same time paying compliments to the players and calling them names, what made Hiroto angry. When he was trying to stop Li along with Tatsuya, they failed and China quickly scored the second goal. Later Kudou Michiya decided to replace two defenders by

To Hiroto's much surprise suddenly his father appeared and without saying a word, he showed them a short video on the phone, in which he was dancing and wishing them luck. It was something really unexpected. When Inazuma Japan left to Russia, it turned out that Hiroto was afraid of flying. When the turbulence suddenly occurred, he caught Tatsuya in fear of his safety.

He joked of Haizaki as the devil needed support from god, which irritated Haizaki and he muttered to let him go. Hiroto did it but at the same time he became serious, saying that Haizaki at this stake would only make troubles on the field.

   When Hiroto began to complain about hopok training,
   Fubuki Atsuya
   told him to keep on practicing, he didn't want someone to leave the team like his brother. Although Hiroto was piqued by this remark and muttered under his breath that Atsuya was a dumbass, he continued to train. When Inazuma Japan found out about the unexpected change of American team
   Star Unicorn
   and what happened to them during the match, Hiroto stated that it didn't matter who they would play with, he would defeat anyone as a god striker. Hearing this Haizaki sneered that for someone who was sitting on the bench in the last match, Hiroto was too confident. When new player
   Aphrodi
   appeared before the team and bluntly stated that the Japan's forwards didn't perform well in their position, Hiroto immediately became alert. Later Aphrodi proposed a mini game 4 vs 4 and Hiroto derided him openly that it would be settled once and for all who the real god was. Before they started Aphrodi asked Hiroto to listen his request in case of their defeat. Hiroto agreed, though he immediately stated that he wasn't going to lose. Later it turned out that Aphrodi could play rough when needed and clashed with Hiroto fighting for the ball. Finally he managed to score a goal and his team won. Hiroto was surprised and disappointed but Aphrodi comforted him saying that gods were different, sometimes they won and sometimes they lost. At the end, according to their agreement, he asked Hiroto to go with him to the amusement park.

   Before the match started, Kazemaru asked Hiroto about their visit in the amusement park. As Hiroto stated the only good things were merry-go-round and teacups. He didn't seem to be excited about what happened unlike Aphrodi who was clearly satisfied with the results of their trip. After the kick-off Japan's players kept passing the ball between themselves however
   Navy Invader
   managed to steal it quickly. Hiroto was trying to dodge
   Convoy
   sliding but he avoided it. Soon after the opponent scored the first goal. When Japan tied 1-1, Navy Invader ounterattacked. They rushed through the field but Hiroto managed to steal the ball from
   Yoga

   Heaven's Time

   Jiraigen

   It was shown later what Hiroto, Iwato and Aphrodi were doing in the amusement park. Hiroto was angry and frustrated, stating that it was like a punishment when they were riding on the merry-go-round. As he stated the match with America was upcoming and they had no time for such nonsense. However Aphrodi explained that it was all for their new technique. The merry-go-round turned out to be not so bad as the rollercoaster which terrified Hiroto seriously. Although he was shaking, he denied that he was afraid of something. Aphrodi quickly found a way to convince him. He explained that in Olympus were gods who were riding on the rollercoaster like aces, and those who were doing much worse. When Aphrodi asked which one was Hiroto and suspended a significant voice, Hiroto immediately stated that he was an ace. During the ride, Hiroto seemed to be unaware of what was going on, as if he was in some kind of a trance. When they finished Hiroto staggered but he quickly got himself together when Aphrodi announced the last part of the training which were teacups. It was something that Hiroto liked and he could do it constantly. It turned out that this time Golem had enough. When they were resting under the tree, Hiroto understood that if they didn't try to pull out these semicircular canals, they wouldn't be able to create a new technique, which Aphrodi confirmed. Hiroto stated that obviously Golem wasn't able to overcome difficulties. Because he doubted his offensive abilities, Hiroto along with Aphrodi decide to support him. Later Golem kept riding on the teacups until he finally succeeded. Thanks to their hard training they created later new technique
   GGG Senjou no Aria
   and scored the third goal for Japan. In Saginuma's flashback Hiroto was seen talking with Tatsuya. He couldn't understand why he was going to play as a defender in the next match against America. Tatsuya explained that he was thinking about how to be useful for the team and being defender was the best what he could do now. When the match was near to the end, both teams were extremely exhausted. After Star Unicorn's trio failed to score with
   The Phoenix
   , Aphrodi took the ball and they tried to use once again GGG Senjou no Aria. However Ichinose, Domon and Mark blocked it in the air and the ball fell on the field. Aphrodi shot the last time with
   God Knows Impact
   and scored the 4th goal for Japan which sealed their victory.

   After the team watched the match of Spain and Russia, Hiroto stated that Russia must be associated with Orion, the defeat of Spain was too overwhelming to be considered otherwise. He joked that Ichihoshi as a former Orion member, knew all their methods. Later he was seen in the locker room with Fudou and they were talking about his leg, which was wounded in the match with Navy Invader. Hiroto asked if he could hide it and if he was going to leave the team, which Fudou confirmed. When
   Umihara Norika
   appeared during the breakfast as a new member of Inazuma Japan, it didn't impress Hiroto at all. He commented clearly bored that there was no need to make such a fuss, although Hiura said that there were reasons. Later during the training another player joined the team, causing a huge shock in everyone. Hiroto wondered if
   Kozoumaru Sasuke
   had changed so much and in fact this metamorphosis was overwhelming. Before the match against Russia, the coach informed that Fudou returned to Japan. While the team was shocked that he left them, Hiroto told them about his last words in which he asked his teammates to grab the world.
