    The War

  </h3>
  <p key="2615cfc0-caed-43a5-b6a3-1c9191a5a07a">
   During
   the War
   , Vengeous was one of Mevolent's Three Generals. He was the leader of the fanatical
   Diablerie
   , a cult dedicated to bringing the
   Faceless Ones
   back through any means necessary. It was mentioned that the
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Torment.html" key="530064fe-7195-48fc-aa5b-8cb9b3f0f9e0" title="Torment">
    Torment
   </a>
   , despite harbouring a dislike for both sides of the War, decided that Vengeous was the worst of two evils. The Torment set out to kill Vengeous. However, sometime after 1861, Vengeous had a legendary battle with Skulduggery Pleasant, in which Vengeous was defeated. Skulduggery Pleasant threw a stick of dynamite at Vengeous, winning the battle. Vengeous was then taken to a prison facility in Russia. The Torment, with Vengeous safely locked away, saw no reason to continue hunting the man.
  </p>
  <p key="e38f6934-28bc-48b5-a5b8-b1af9a50d5a1">
   Earlier in the war, Vengeous encountered
   Saracen Rue
   in Leeds. He also fought at
   The Battle of Black Rock
   , and was driven into retreat by
   Ghastly Bespoke's mother
   .

    Reviving
    the Grotesquery
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="830879f9-2aa1-4292-bca1-fb28f75f09dd">
   After escaping jail, Vengeous returns to Ireland, killing a
   Sanctuary
   agent who recognises him. He joins together with
   Dusk
   , a
   vampire
   who owed Vengeous an undisclosed debt, and Billy-Ray Sanguine. Using the two men as his chief henchmen, Vengeous would begin to enact his plan to revive the Grotesquery.
  </p>
  <p key="9c12c1bc-8ef6-48aa-abc7-779ff8e91f66">
   Vengeous is revealed to be in search of
   Lord Vile's
   armour and
   Valkyrie Cain's blood
   . Using both, he could revive
   the Grotesquery
   . The Grotesquery is made with the body parts of many other beasts grafted onto the torso of a
   Faceless One
   . This connection to the Faceless Ones was purported to be able to herald the return of the remaining gods.
  </p>
  <p key="41e9efeb-922a-4b48-8735-10d8f71ee36c">
   Using an army of
   Infected
   , Vengeous is able to find the fabled, powerful armour of
   Lord Vile
   , a fellow General. The immensely powerful Necromancer magic embedded in the armour falls under Vengeous' control. The magic is so powerful, he must wear a protective clothing underneath the armour. He also finds the body of the Grotesquery, a spectacle that is observed by
   Valkyrie Cain
   and
   Skulduggery Pleasant
   . They witness Vengeous' sadistic power first hand: he uses his magic to rupture the body of an Infected who had dropped Grotesquery's body.
  </p>
  <p key="738ce73f-08ae-43dd-9b1d-e3d5cbbf798a">
   Valkyrie is captured while Skulduggery attempts to contact the
   Sanctuary
   for reinforcements. After driving to a derelict church, Vengeous orders Billy-Ray Sanguine to cut Valkyrie's hand. Her blood falls upon the Grotesquery. Valkyrie's blood, which contains traces of the
   Ancients
   ' power, is able to revive the Grotesquery. However, Skulduggery returns, foiling the ritual before it can be completed. The Grotesquery appears to be unable to be resurrected. Skulduggery and Valkyrie escape with the carcas of the Grotesquery, infuriating Vengeous.
  </p>
  <p key="2d10b34c-3ec8-48d5-8511-993b95fde17c">
   It later awakens in the laboratory of
   Kenspeckle Grouse
   , enough of the ritual having been completed. It kills two of Kenspeckle Grouse's assistants,
   Stentor
   and
   Civet
   , as well as three

    Tanith Low

   , the Grotesquery escapes, falling under Vengeous' command.
  </p>
  <p key="ef9ed5e0-7f2c-4478-9d46-e9e9550dff6a">
   Vengeous, with the help of Sanguine, Dusk, and
   Springheeled Jack
   , orchestrates attacks on personnel from the International
   Sanctuaries
   . While the Sanctuaries are preoccupied dealing with attacks, Vengeous rightfully assumes that they will be too busy to answer Ireland's request for aid, ensuring that Vengeous is not overwhelmed by the international magic community
  </p>
  <p key="2ed8d6fe-c38d-4c92-a065-8d6f87ff27c0">
   It is discovered that Vengeous harbours a grudge against
   <a href="China Sorrows.html" key="26fbe66d-9a4d-44dd-9059-1acea066ab54" title="China Sorrows">
    China Sorrows
   </a>
   , former leader of the Diablerie, because she defected from Vengeous' group. Sorrows realises this, and employs two elite bodyguards,
   Zephyr
   and
   Sev
   , to protect her from Vengeous' fury. Vengeous confronts China and her bodyguards in a car park, easily killing Sev and ripping apart Zephyr. He wonders how Lord Vile was ever defeated while wielding such power, and tells China that while Necromancy is a little crude, nothing Beats the sheer thrill of using it against one’s opponents. China mocks him, saying that he is farweaker than Lord Vile. She states “Lord Vile... was different... he could have changed the world... you merely wear his clothes”. Baron Vengeous captures China, intending for her to watch the return of the Faceless Ones.
  </p>
  <p key="b562a27f-b732-443e-89e5-f7f95b252365">
   Vengeous then moves to
   Clearwater Hospital
   , a clandestine, abandoned site where he intends to bring the Faceless Ones back. Much of Vengeous' support has withered away by this point; Valkyrie Cain leads his army of Infected into the sea, and Springheeled Jack defects, incapacitating Dusk. Vengeous has the sole support of Sanguine, and the Grotesquery. Sanguine is captured at Clearwater by a Sanctuary task force consisting of
   Skulduggery Pleasant
   ,
   Valkyrie Cain
   ,
   Mr. Bliss
   ,
   <a href="Tanith Low.html" key="0850e415-42c3-446b-9fe2-cffef11ea532" title="Tanith Low">
    Tanith Low
   </a>
   , and a multitude of
   <a href="Cleaver.html" key="29b9c78c-9357-46ce-8f16-14fbc4c9c349" title="Cleaver">
    Cleavers
   </a>
   . The group observes that Sanguine seemed to have ulterior motives in supporting Vengeous after over-hearing his phone call.
  </p>
  <p key="2b7be2bf-ce62-4afa-b020-d4f1bc8af4e4">
   The Grotesquery is then found alone, Vengeous having seemingly vanished. Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Bliss, and Tanith begin the initial attack, managing to wound the Grotesquery before is it able to reach the peak of its power. It is then swarmed by the Cleavers, who severely wound the Grotesquery. Vengeous returns with the captured China, using Vile's armour to render Tanith and the remaining Cleavers unconscious. The Torment is called for reinforcement, but he too is defeated by the recovering Grotesquery. With the group seemingly defeated, it appears as though Vengeous would emerge victorious. However, China recovers, and fights Vengeous, allowing Skulduggery and Valkyrie to escape.
  </p>
  <p key="e362ec71-0ad9-4cf5-b0db-7864aaf07d10">
   Valkyrie and Skulduggery flee to the Bentley, where they open the boot to reveal they’re secret weapon. Using Sanguine as a mode of transport, they rise from the ground right next to Baron Vengeous. Not needing to deal with all the shadows at such close range, they remove his armor, leaving Vengeous severely weakened. Skulduggery shoots Vengeous, to which Vengeous protests, saying that he can’t die to Skulduggery; Skulduggery is an abomination. Skulduggery responds that he’s a lot of things.
  </p>
  <p key="9b92e1db-f876-4654-8c21-877c061adbb8">
   Vengeous, staring defeat in the face, crawls over to the Grotesquery to apologise for failing to protect it. The Grotesquery snaps his neck. The Grotesquery is then defeated by Valkyrie, but its death scream alerts the Faceless Ones to Earth's location.

   When Valkyrie Cain is forced into his dimension by
