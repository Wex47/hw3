   Little is known about the Ancients. They were the first to use Magic, and were extremely powerful with it. For years, they worshipped and obeyed the Faceless Ones, but eventually began a revolution, secretly stealing a Black Crystal from the Faceless Ones and crafting the Sceptre of the Ancients, as well as the four

   </a>
   . They then fought back against the Faceless Ones and banished them from our world. Eventually, without their gods, they began to fight amongst themselves, and the Ancients wiped themselves out. At some point, the Edgley family became supposedly descended from the Ancients before it was revealed that they were truly descended from the ones that the Ancients had once called Gods.

   The Sceptre was created by the Ancients, but the crystal that fuelled it belonged to the Faceless Ones. It would sing to the Gods whenever an enemy neared. However, when an Ancient approached, the crystal would stay quiet. They stole the crystal and built the Sceptre which they then used to defeat the Faceless Ones. The Ancients then turned on each other and used the weapon to kill each other. When all but one was dead, the last Ancient hurled the Sceptre deep into the earth.
