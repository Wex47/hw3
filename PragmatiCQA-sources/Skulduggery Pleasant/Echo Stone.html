    Echo Stone
   </b>
   is an object that can imprint the personality of the user. To do so, the user must sleep with the stone nearby for three nights. It is said that once a copy of someone is imprinted on a stone, it cannot be written over. Echo Stones are usually made for the dying, so that the can put any grievers at ease. An Echo Stone cannot be let out of it's cradle for a long time or it will run out of power and have to be recharged again, which can take up to a year. The imprints in the Echo Stone cannot breathe, but they have the same personality, have a mind of their own and can continue to learn. An Echo Stone can be recharged in its cradle.
