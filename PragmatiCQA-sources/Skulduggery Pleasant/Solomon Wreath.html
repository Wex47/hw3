   , Wreath and his contingent arrive midway through the battle, fighting with great skill against the Diablerie and their forces. However, they are powerless to stop the Diablerie from releasing the Faceless Ones. While trying to guide the final Faceless One back through the portal, after the other Faceless Ones are killed, Solomon is badly injured and is only just forced out of the fight by Skulduggery before he was killed. He then throws his cane over to Valkyrie, who uses it to force the Faceless One back into the portal. The cane is broken by the Faceless One but it is still forced into the portal, taking Skulduggery with it. Wreath seems strangely apathetic about this, most likely because of his strained relationship with skulduggery, whilst everyone else is horrified.

The book ends with Wreath telling Valkyrie that to get Skulduggery back from the realm of the Faceless Ones they will need Skulduggery's true head, which he lost, (he won the current one in a game of poker), as an Isthmus Anchor, and to gain the power needed Valkyrie would have to change her discipline from an Elemental to a Necromancer. He almost certainly does this to gain Valkyries trust, leading to her taking up necromancy to gain the power she would need and was the first of many actions that would lead to the events in

   He briefly met with
   Skulduggery Pleasant
   and
   Valkyrie Cain
   about two years after
   the Death Bringer
   incident. He remembered the latter's birthday, much to Skulduggery's chagrin. Wreath bestows Valkyrie with a gift of a new, more powerful, Necromancer ring, smashing the old one. Skulduggery questioned Wreath over why
   Bison Dragonclaw
   convinced the

   to kill Skulduggery and Valkyrie, back during the Death Bringer incident. Wreath revealed that Dragonclaw gave a name to the Warlock that
   Charivari
   yearned for. That name was
   Department X
   , a supposed covert mortal organization that kills mages. Skulduggery said that Department X didn't exist; It was just used as an excuse in case any mortals asked any questions over why creatures died. Wreath also said that five years ago

  <p key="fdd9c696-2ec0-4ff3-bdfb-44904f685d0a">
   Solomon Wreath was different from other Necromancers since he did not spend most of his life inside a Temple but instead liked to live in the mortal world. He knew about computers and various other modern pieces of technology and couldn't understand why his "brothers and sisters" didn't use technology themselves. He also preferred not to wear Necromancer robes. Although he admitted that he didn't like all of his fellow Necromancers, Solomon was protective of any whom he considered innocent and asked Valkyrie and Skulduggery not to kill Necromancers unless necessary. He did consider it necessary to kill Craven however and would have killed him personally if not for the White Cleaver.
  </p>
  <p key="b9d8ba2c-fc34-4803-8c0b-b34561115a67">
   Solomon also had a soft spot for Valkyrie, believing that she was the Death Bringer because of her exceptional talent with Necromancy. He tried to get her to understand that the Death Bringer would save the world, but actually attacked her when she tried to escape. He was devoted to bringing about the rise of the Death Bringer but it is implied that Valkyrie might have managed to make him doubt that it was the right course of action as he decided not to join any other Temples, although this was sort of because he didn't think they would accept him. When Skulduggery questioned him about these possible doubts, however, Wreath denied them.

   As a Necromancer, Solomon has control over shadows and darkness and is able to use them for many purposes such as waves, daggers, streams and whips of darkness. The object that Wreath used for containing his magic is his cane. He was a skilled and powerful Necromancer capable of overwhelming the powerful albeit inexperienced Valkyrie Cain easily in Death Bringer, whom he himself had stated had the potential to become the most powerful Necromancer in history. Solomon could also shadow walk, which was basically a more limited variant of teleportation.
