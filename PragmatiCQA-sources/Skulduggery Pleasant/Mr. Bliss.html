Mr.Bliss deserted the teachings and belief at an early age. China takes a while to do the same. They both continue to believe in their existence.

    Throughout the centuries, there has been a league of warrior mages, of combat sorcerers, that has defended the world from the threat of the Faceless Ones and their disciples. They were once known as the League of Ghosts, then the Shadow Echelon, and now, in this time, they are known as The Munchkin Army.

   It is implied that Bliss was a high-ranking member of the Munchkin Army, if not the leader. Initiates helped Bliss to defeat the Dark Gods. Presumably, Bliss would have fought earlier incarnations of the Munchkin Army when he himself was a Disciple of the Dark Gods, however further discussion would be limited to speculation. What is known is that he was a member of the Army in 2008.

It is later revealed Bliss was only pretending to help Serpine so that he could retrieve the Sceptre of the Ancients and "his actions would become predictable" (he says this after being told to kill
   Valkyrie
   ). He then assists in bringing Serpine down. The first time Valkyrie meets Bliss, she said there was something about him that made her want to curl up and cry.

   Despite the fact that he was considered intimidating by many people, Bliss was a decent man although he could be manipulative as shown in the first book when he pretended to be on Serpine's side in order to find a way to defeat him. He maintained an extremely calm and reserved demeanor around other people and rarely lost his temper - a lot of people see his stoicism as so unbreakable he looks almost bored, even when he should have suffered a fatal injury. He was intelligent, able to deduce which side was the winning side in the conflict. However, he was no coward: he willingly laid down his life for those he loved and respected. Despite the fact that his sister had tried to kill him, Bliss was very protective of China as shown when he furiously attacked Gruesome Krav for trying to kill her stating that she was the only family he had left.

  <p key="c683bba8-f01e-41fc-9d91-69f844e28b14">
   Interestingly, Bliss was the ultimate display of his family's expectations: he never changed his character. He was intensely stubborn and, when he refused to follow the Sorrows family tradition and refused later to join Mevolent, he was labelled as a coward and a hypocrite by his family. He believed that the Faceless Ones existed, but was not fanatically devoted to them. The most prominent factor of his personality was that he was extremely forgiving: even after everything China held against him, he still loved her with every fibre of his being.

   Bliss was an extremely powerful Adept sorcerer who studied the discipline of enhancement. His Adept magic went to his strength, and it caused him to become physically the strongest person in the world, able to punch through huge solid structures and break bones to splinters without suffering any injuries himself. Even the likes of Nefarian Serpine see his strength as overwhelming. Bliss's muscularity means that he has viciously fast reflexes. This also means that he possesses incredible amounts of durability: he survived being exploded into bookcases, a brick wall and even the full brunt of Serpine's red right hand. His most impressive demonstration of durability was when an assassin swung a sword at his neck - he caught it in one hand without getting a single cut, and then crushed the blade in his hand, all without a single drop of blood lost. As a result, he was also noted for being extremely difficult to kill; whether this was because of magic or simply his physical resilience is unclear. However despite Bliss' excellent survival skills he was eventually killed by one of the Faceless Ones.
