  <p key="f3defd5a-5f56-4326-8cce-c187c23ea725">
   Abyssinia was the daughter of
   the Unnamed
   , who was the master of Mevolent, as a result it is likely she was a key player for the entirety of the War. Though a member of
   <a href="The Diablerie.html" key="aec84a98-7eaf-4c14-b619-a64aeed9c635" title="The Diablerie">
    the Diablerie
   </a>
   , she was seldom mentioned.
  </p>
  <p key="1acd7d29-25fa-4b7d-b126-764ccda1f9c6">
   She appeared to Skulduggery Pleasant after he had returned to the fray, following his demise, and gifted him with a suit of black armor. How she forged this is unknown, as she does not seem to have had access to
   the Shadow Furnace
   . She became romantically involved with Pleasant and was likely a key part of his transition to becoming Lord Vile. During the War, they often went on sorties together, slaughtering whole villages with their powers. After the War, Skulduggery never mentioned her: likely ashamed of having been unfaithful to his dead wife.
  </p>
  <p key="616d73b3-15ed-4aac-993c-d32513c6a4ac">
   She became romantically involved with Mevolent and had a son, who she claimed to be Vile's child: Caisson. Mevolent perhaps sought to have a son with Faceless Blood, to become possessed as a Child of the Faceless. He could also have been in on the plot to create a vessel for his former master to use after his return. However, Mevolent's implied involvement in the death of her father makes this idea less credible.

   had stabbed her and thrown her out of the window. It was then when she met her father that he gave her his magic and told her to kill her son and let his soul be put in his body. Now that she was powerful again, not on the brink of death, she returned, stronger than ever. It was only after her father took back the powers that he had granted her so long ago. Without her powerful magic, she was finally able to truly be killed.

    Life Force Absorption
   </u>
   : Abyssinia possesses the ability to absorb her opponent's life force. She is only able to drain a single person at a time but can control the intensity and rate at which she drains her target. This can range from brief incapacitation to complete absorption of her targets life-force. If not interrupted this ability appears to be irresistible as not even Mevolent, one of the strongest sorcerers in the world, could prevent himself from being drained to death. Primarily, she uses her power to heal her wounds or make herself stronger. Normally, she seems to require physical contact to drain a person but with the powers gifted to her by her father the ability was enhanced, allowing her to drain her targets over a short distance. This conclusion is drawn due to her most noticeably trying to drain Crepuscular Vies by attempting to make physical contact during their fatal confrontation. This is despite the fact that a few chapters back she stopped Skulduggery from moving by draining his life-force from the other side of the room while preparing to trap him in the Infinity Gate.

   : Abyssinia has the power to look inside one’s mind, and is capable of searching their memories. She can communicate telepathically over vast distances and even from the confines of Coldheart Prison. She has the ability to alter memories to a degree, described by Valkyrie as both precise and elegant. She's able to sense others watching her through visions and converse with them. She can establish telepathic links with a person and can use clairvoyance to search for a person as she did when attempting to find Cassion after she sensed him dying.

    Enhanced Regeneration:
   </u>
   Abyssinia has been shown to possess immense regenerative abilities. Her healing factor is potent enough to allow her to recover from injuries like broken bones, gunshot wounds, and internal injuries within mere moments or seconds. Her regeneration appears to be uniquely tied in with her ability to absorb her opponent's life-force. If the right conditions are fulfilled she's shown the ability to regenerate from near-complete bodily destruction. Rebuilding herself a fully functional body from nothing but her heart. Her regeneration however was not an ability she learned herself but an ability that came with the powers her father bestowed her.

    Immortality
   </u>
   : Abyssinia, with the powers bestowed upon her by her father, is functionally immortal. The Unnamed was stated to be impossible to kill without the use of
   The Obsidian Blade
   and had he not been slain by it was certain he would've lived forever. Given that Abyssinia had been gifted all of his power, it is strongly implied that the same rules apply to her. This theory is further supported by the fact that her heart proved to be indestructible. Theoretically, if her father had not taken back the power he had bestowed upon her she could've continually resurrected herself if the right conditions were fulfilled and proved to be an opponent truly unable to die.

    Powers of The Unnamed:
   </u>
   Willingly given to her by The Unnamed while on the verge of death Abyssinia gained his extraordinary regenerative abilities as well as his inability to truly die from anything less than The Obsidian Blade. Evident when her heart proved to be impossible to destroy and could only be sealed away. It's hinted that Abyssinia possessed many more powers gifted to her by her father as Abyssinia shocked Valkyrie by her ability to fly in their final battle only for Abyssinia to state that her father possessed many powers including the ability to fly and so, by extension, so did she. Her whole style of fighting after she obtained her father's powers based itself around her regeneration allowing her to ignore enemies while she drained their life force or ripped them apart. After her father reclaimed his powers near the end of the book, her unfamiliarity of fighting without her enhanced powers or regeneration proved to be her downfall in her fatal confrontation with Crepuscular Vies. Without her enhanced healing or her father's immortality, she ended up finally dying for good.
