   He was in love with a girl called Anna but their relationship was not approved by their parents so they decided that they were going to run away together. Her family owned a tavern where she worked and one day a man visited. He kept coming back and got into a fight with two other men in the tavern, one who was protecting Anna, as he was in love with her. He then threw them across a room when he was confronted. He and Anna eventually started talking, and she told him about herself, Caelan and their plans. One night when Caelan was standing beneath her window, the vampire bit Caelan and he fell into the tavern cellar. When he woke, 3 days later, he found her family dead. All he cared about was the blood, and he drank it off of the walls and the floor. During those 3 days, the vampire had told Anna that Caelan had left without her and had even orchestrated it so that she would return to the house to find Caelan with the bodies of her dead family. She ran to the vampire and he slept with her and when he was finished he cut out her heart and left it for Caelan.

   When Valkyrie is kidnapped, she is thrown into a cell which she later realizes she shares with Caelan. They start talking and he tells her about his past and she explains how she is looking for Skulduggery. Caelan then says that he knows how to get in touch with Chabon, who currently had the Murder Skull, and so they made the agreement that if she got him out then he would help her in return. Caelan is then taken away to fight in the pit against another vampire called Victor while he is only half vampire. Valkyrie is thrown in the pit and catapults them up into the crowd, using her elemental powers. She then runs away and she finds Caelan again. He injects himself with more serum, so he is 100% human, and helps her escape. Valkyrie then tells him that he saved her life so he didn't owe her anything but he says that he will. He then walks away and is not seen again until Dark Days.

  <p key="9b93e129-1f06-49ff-a0e6-6f428d250f87">
   Caelan is strongly pictured as a self-loathing person during his appearances in the series. Although in human form he is seems generally kind and harmless, he quickly becomes obsessive, intense and angry when his feral side is tempted. He blames himself for everything, particularly bad things that happen to Valkyrie. He is shown to be unable to control his obsessive personality when he falls in love with people and reveals during Death Bringer that his former loves have died due to being unable to keep the monster inside him. At one point he reveals that he killed one of Dusk's friends who tried to convince him to stay away from mortals and hide in the darkness, worried that Caelan's behaviour risked the safety of the vampires. This causes him to be exiled and hated amongst other vampires. When he is around Valkyrie he shows undying affection towards her; although, he cannot justify why he loves her when he is questioned, and when Valkyrie breaks up with him he immediately becomes abusive and tries to infect Valkyrie for the sake of their "love".

   Caelan appears to be maybe nineteen or twenty, but is probably over a hundred years old, tall, with black hair that shines, dark eyes and narrow cheek bones. Valkyrie also describes Caelan as "good looking". This is probably why Fletcher feels so threatened by him.

   Caelan possesses all the usual skills a vampire has, (increased speed, strength, agility, vision, perception) and also sheds his skin at dusk, taking on the vampires' true form. Caelan seems to be inferior to Dusk, who easily beats him in their fight. This is because Dusk is many (maybe hundreds) years older than Caelan, and thus, Dusk has a lot more experience, especially when it comes to blood, of which Dusk is a "connoisseur".

    Caelan's relationship with Valkyrie during Skulduggery Pleasant: The Death bringer is possibly a reference to Bella and Edward's relationship in Twilight though it's portrayed more realistically with Valkyrie's discomfort and disgust with Caelan's behaviour. This is supported by how the chapter he dies in is called "My Twilight" and that Valkyrie even references Bella and Edward in that same chapter.
