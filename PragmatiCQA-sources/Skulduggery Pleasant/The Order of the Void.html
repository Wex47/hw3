    The Order of The Void
   </b>
   is a group first seen in
   Bedlam
   . The brothers of the Order of the Void are containing the 108 inmates of
   Greymire Assylum
   . Valkyrie is there to find K-49 for
   Caisson
   . On her journey to find her sister's lost soul and stop Abssynia and the anti-sanctuary Valkyrie meets someone who says the item that could fuse the broken pieces of soul together is in Greywright Asylum. She goes there, only to be ambushed and buried alive by the Order. As she lies down and fights the urge to let the dullness consume her, a vision of Billy-Ray Sanguine asks her what happened to her, because she used to be unbeatable.
