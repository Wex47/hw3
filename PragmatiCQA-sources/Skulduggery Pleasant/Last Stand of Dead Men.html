   War has finally come.

  <p key="349da7cc-63d2-4bda-ab78-1c0df27b327c">
   But it's not a war between good and evil, or light and dark- it's a war between Sanctuaries. For too long now, the Irish Sanctuary has teetered on the brink of world-ending disaster, and the other Sanctuaries around the world have had enough. Allies turn to enemies, friends turn to foes, and Skulduggery and Valkyrie must team up with the rest of the Dead Men if they're going to have any chance at all of maintaining the balance of power and getting to the root of a vast conspiracy that has been years in the making.
  </p>
  <p key="e09bf017-913e-4ee8-9b43-a78949ad8619">
   But while this war is only beginning, another war rages within Valkyrie herself. Her own dark side, the insanely powerful being known as Darquesse, is on the verge of rising to the surface. And if Valkyrie slips, even for a moment, then Darquesse will burn the world and everyone in it.

   's disappearance. They meet the Witch's granddaugther Misery and after convincing her that they're not there to kill her grandmother, they head into the cabin and into the cellar. They meet the witch Dubhog Ni Broin, who is holding Skulduggery captive after he attacked the front door. Through trickery, Skulduggery manages to trick why Broin was seen conversing with a Warlock who was sent to kill both Pleasant and Cain. Broin reveals that the Warlock was trying to convice her and her sisters to join with the Warlock's leader,
   Charivari
   to go to war. During a meeting between Irish Elders,
   Ghastly Bespoke
   ,
   Erskine Ravel
   and
   Madame Mist
   , they conversed with English Elder lllori Reticent where she tries to convice the Elders to let the Supreme Council establish a Council of Nine and not three so the other Sancturies around the World would not be so frightened should another disaster strike Ireland. Ravel refuses because he says the Supreme Council has no right to dictate other Sanctuaries on how to conduct their business. Illori tries to convince the Elders to at least shut down the Accelerator because it would boost the Irish Mage's powers beyond anything imaginable. Ravel again refuses because the Accelerator is possibly the only cell in existence that can hold Darquesse.

   Afterwards, Valkyrie and her parents with Alice, celebrate her 18th Birthday and her parents present her with an orange car which Valkyrie calls the "Oompa-Loompa" but still loves it all the same. Later she and Skulduggery go meet Solomon Wreath. Wreath gives Valkyrie an "upgrade" to her Necromancer abilites as a present. Pleasant questions Wreath over why
   Bison Dragonclaw
   convinced the Warlocks to kill Skulduggery and Valkyrie. Wreath reveals that Dragonclaw gave a name to the Warlock that Charivari wanted which was Department X. Skulduggery says that Department X doesn't exist; It's just used as an excuse in case any mortals ask any questions over why creatures died. Wreath also says that five years ago
   Baritone
   , one of the necromancers during the Battle of Aranmore Farm, noticed three mortals boasting about how they faced warlocks. Baritone asked who hired them but they couldn't remember the man. Skulduggery states that they have been hearing a lot about the mystery man;
   Davina Marr
   couldn't remember who hired her to blow up the Sanctuary and
   Sean Mackin
   was relased from his cell by someone who he couldn't remember.

   Meanwhile, Ghastly is out jogging and is startled when he realizes he is being tracked. He follows the trackers to the Accelerator where
   Bernard Sult
   and other Supreme Council members are planting explosives to destroy the Accelerator. Sult says that if the Supreme Council cannot have the Accelerator then neither can Ireland have it. Ghastly manages to defeat the Council members but Sult detonates the bombs himself. He and the others survive but are astonished that the Accelerator wasn't destroyed or even damaged. Ravel and the Cleavers arrive to arrest Sult and the mages.

   Valkyrie visits
   China Sorrows
   to find out who and how the Man with Golden Eyes manages to erase himself from other people's thoughts. China tells her that a type of amethyst crystal exists, that could induce a level of amnesia so the thoughts can be erased. However, it is not a discipline of magic so anyone can use it. China also says that most of the crystals are locked away carefully and there can even be one in The Sanctuary in Roarhaven. China then asks why Valkyrie really came to her. She says that she wants advice. Her parents expect her to go to college and study but she keeps wanting to work at the Sanctuary but also does not want to get too distant from other mortals. China tells her that its called Second Lifetime Syndrome and it happens when sorcerers watch their friends or family die around them. Valkyrie suggests that she could tell her parents about magic. China strongly advises her against that since Valkyrie's parent's lives will be ruined with fear and worry about their daughter and their lives.

   At the Sanctuary, Valkyrie meets
   Saracen Rue
   where the two converse with Erskine. He reveals that a robot called The Engineer was the only machine capable of deactivating the Accelerator. The Supreme Council are demanding the release of Sult and respond by accusing and arresting Irish Mages all over the world of spying on the council. They arrest many Irish Mages including

On the way, Valkyrie mentions that she was talking to China about the Second Lifetime Syndrome but Skulduggery responds that saying that she wants her to be happy and whatever way she can achieve that is fine. They find the crystal and Skulduggery realizes that the Crystals are so rare that the Man with Golden Eyes could have been using that same crystal. They then also realize that the Man is probably a Sanctuary Mage. They receive a message from Cassandra Pharos who says she is going to have a vision, and wants them to be there.

   Dexter Vex is arrested in America, alongside another Irishman, Caius Calavier. Caius is distraught as he is being imprisoned and that he did no crime to deserve it. He is being escorted by Grim - the ex-bodyguard of Grand Mage Strom, who lost his job after Strom's assassination. Grim beats Caius by shoving him against the wall, and Caius responds by saying that he is 'a big, tough man' when he is beating another with shackles on. Grim takes this as a challenge and goads Caius into taking his shackles off, even thought Dexter tells him not to. Caius lunges at Grim, but Grim easily overpowers Caius, and puts him in a chokehold. Dexter attempts to convince the both of them to stop, but Grim kills Caius. The death of an imprisoned Irish mage makes the Irish Sanctuary very angry. The Supreme Council does not directly apologize, saying that he could have been an Irish Spy. They find that Bernard Sult is not in his cell, and the guard on watch is unconscious. The Supreme Council's channel, which is broadcast internationally, is hacked by Syc and Portia - the Children of the Spider. They murder Bernard Sult on live TV, saying that if the Supreme Council harms any Irish Mages, it will be a 'life for a life'. Madame Mist is mysteriously calm on this matter, firmly stating she had no control over them.

   The Irish Sanctuary has a decoy trap hidden in the Keep, in the hope that Mantis springs the trap and they can subdue him. The Keep is located in low ground, against a cliff side. They have an army of cheap Hollow Men in the Keep, that appear to be human from a distance, but not up close.

It is mentionaed that Ravel is taken to a prison, but nothing can ease his pain. They asked the Engineer to shut down the Accelerator, and it asks the group 'who will be contributing?'. This confuses them, so the Engineer explains that is the Accelerator is not shut down within the four weeks of activation, a soul must be willingly given to seal off the Accelerator from the source of all magic. If a sacrifice is not made within 23 days, the Accelator will self-destruct. China declares herself Grand Mage to no objection. She assigns Dexter and Saracen the task of stopping the 19 super-charged mages - courtesy of the Accelerator - and Skulduggery must stop Darquesse.
