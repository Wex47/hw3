   is an
   Elemental
   and a "living" skeleton. He fought in
   the War
   against
   Mevolent
   as part of a group called
   the Dead Men
   . However, the death of his family at the hands of
   Nefarian Serpine
   caused him to go mad and in a fit of rage, he picked up a poisoned dagger which trapped him, and Serpine tortured and killed him. He was resurrected, but he soon was overcome by his fury and desire for destruction and joined
   Mevolent's Forces
   , becoming
   Lord Vile
   , the most powerful of
   the Three Generals
   . Five years later, he regained his senses and became Skulduggery Pleasant again.

  <p key="7ecfa79a-a5de-476a-9909-69d3aba1aaa9">
   Skulduggery Pleasant grew up presumably somewhere in Ireland approximately 400 years ago. When he was a child he had a stutter that caused people to think that he was possessed by the devil. At some point, he met
   Ghastly Bespoke
   and
   Hopeless
   , and they became good friends. When an evil sorcerer named Mevolent gathered an army and tried to conquer the world to summon the
   Faceless Ones
   back to their reality he was opposed by a resistance movement, in which Skulduggery helped. Skulduggery was one of the leaders of the resistance movement.
  </p>
  <p key="6e229359-ec27-4e7a-a325-890b22180134">
   During the war, Skulduggery was part of a group, ironically named the
   Dead Men
   , as they would always come back from suicide missions alive.
   Ghastly Bespoke
   and
   Erskine Ravel
   were some of the members.
  </p>
  <p key="515f6a7a-c41c-4a4e-ab8c-7df24d2e0ff7">
   He fell victim to Mevolent's second-in-command,
   Nefarian Serpine
   , who killed Skulduggery's wife and child and then attacked Skulduggery himself with a dagger. Skulduggery then grabbed it and discovered that it was barbed with poison. Skulduggery was tortured for several days before being killed by Serpine on October 23rd, around 1700.
   Mevolent's Forces
   then stuck Skulduggery's body on a pike and burnt it for all to see.
  </p>
  <p key="7a67b68d-7f77-483e-aaf0-f6d8aeacbbf6">
   One by one the other leaders of the resistance fell but strangely, Skulduggery's spirit did not move on. His bones had been placed in a bag and thrown in a river, but Skulduggery was somehow able to go into the bag, reattach his bones and quite literally pull himself together (It was later revealed that this was
   Auron Tenebrae
   's meddling). However, the loss of his family drove him to create a new, violent personality:
   Lord Vile
   . he was gifted with armour by his new girlfriend
   Abyssinia
   who also made sure that he stayed on the 'right' track. Vile aligned himself with Mevolent and fought alongside him for five years. Abyssinia also fought with him, decimating entire villages with Vile.
  </p>
  <p key="c6c960b8-23c4-46a8-9f77-7c504738b48a">
   Five years later, he was brought back to Skulduggery when Vile couldn't kill his own friend Ghastly Bespoke. With his help, the resistance was able to defeat Mevolent whose minions were either imprisoned or rehabilitated, Serpine included. Before this, however, Skulduggery and the Dead Men teamed up with the
   Diablerie
   to hunt down and kill Abyssinia. After Skulduggery himself cut out Abyssinia's heart, the groups parted ways and the war continued. Another of Mevolent's henchmen,
   Baron Vengeous
   , was personally tracked down by Skulduggery, who threw a stick of lit dynamite at him. A truce was signed between the
   Sanctuaries
   and the former followers of Mevolent and an uneasy peace began. After Mevolent's defeat, Skulduggery became a detective, but he never lost his hatred for and desire for revenge on Serpine.
  </p>
  <p key="cd0c9989-75e5-4ac4-ae5b-d150b0cf614c">
   Sometime during his career as a detective, a band of goblins would steal his skull and he would continue using one which he had won in a poker game until it was recovered by
   Valkyrie Cain
   in
   2009
   .

  <p key="dc39e5e8-ec02-41ea-85e8-048adc3ca3fd">
   Skulduggery was present at Gordon's funeral. He met
   Stephanie
   in Gordon's office and told her that
   Gordon
   had died "doing what he loved." In Gordon's will, he was left a piece of advice. When Stephanie was alone at Gordon's house and attacked by
   Vindick Leather
   , who was hired by Nefarian Serpine to find the key to the caves, Skulduggery saved her. By this point his disguise had come off and Stephanie saw that he was a skeleton.
  </p>
  <p key="ab09e6c6-b3cd-4ebc-aacd-9811555df2d0">
   After a brief conversation, Stephanie fainted. When she came back to consciousness, Skulduggery brought her some tea and explained to her that about the secret world of magic and mages. He also told her that he was killed by a man called Nefarian Serpine but came back to life as a skeleton, and that Serpine made a truce, but broke it, not that the Sanctuaries are aware of this and he is now looking for the supposedly mythical
   Sceptre of the Ancients
   .
  </p>
  <p key="f304bac9-8ea8-4d4e-bf69-0ff5be56c38c">
   He took Stephanie to see
   China Sorrows
   that night, and as they were driving back to Gordon's, they were attacked by the same man who assaulted Stephanie earlier that morning, damaging Skulduggery's precious
   Bentley
   . His
   adept
   power made him impervious to fire and when Stephanie leads him into the river Liffey after after a long chase, the water counteracted the spell and tore him apart. The next day, Skulduggery comes by Stephanie's house and casts a spell on her mirror, allowing Stephanie's
   reflection
   to leave the mirror and fill Stephanie's place while she goes with Skulduggery to solve the case of Gordon's murder. They go to Skulduggery's friend Ghastly for some information on the Sceptre, but Stephanie gets into an argument with Ghastly, so they leave. He next takes Stephanie to the
   Irish Sanctuary
   to try and persuade
   the Elders
   that the Sceptre actually exists, but the Elders refuse to believe them.
  </p>
  <p key="819c7216-42b1-44ab-a24d-2c52d5d2985d">
   Skulduggery and Stephanie then go to a gallery to seek more information about the Sceptre. They manage to get into a vault, where they find an
   Echo Stone
   . A man called
   Oisin
   , who imprinted himself on the stone, gives them information about the Sceptre of the Ancients. The two try to get back out, but they are attacked by two
   vampires
   who are working as security for the gallery. The two just manage to escape, and head over to the caves, where Skulduggery is kidnapped by Serpine's men. He is then tortured by Serpine's red right hand.

   Stephanie is under a controlling spell at this time because China used her
   Given Name
   against her. Stephanie finally creates a
   Taken Name
   , Valkyrie Cain. A plan is made by Valkyrie, who is joined by
   <a href="Tanith Low.html" key="39dd36cd-d126-417a-ac16-d1d4503973ba" title="Tanith Low">
    Tanith Low

  </p>
  <p key="44353066-837b-44f3-8f99-a345ab921f0b">
   After they escape Serpine's castle, he tells Valkyrie that the advice helped him find the location of the key, which
   Beryl Edgley
   has. He makes Valkyrie get it, and they get into the caves below Gordon's house, where they see Serpine acquire the Sceptre. The two meet
   Mr. Bliss
   , who betrays them. Skulduggery is thrown over a cliff but doesn't seem to be hurt by the fall. After finding out that one of the Elders,
   Sagacious Tome
   , betrayed them and helped Serpine kill the other two Elders, he, along with Valkyrie and Tanith go to the Sanctuary to stop Serpine. He also discovers that Serpine is really after the
   Book of Names
   . Tanith tells the other two to carry on when the
   White Cleaver
   attacks them. Tanith duels the White Cleaver while Skulduggery and Valkyrie take on Serpine, and is nearly killed. Skulduggery and Valkyrie have a long fight with Serpine. During it, Skulduggery defends himself using the Book of Names as a shield when Serpine tries to kill him with the Sceptre, and the book is destroyed. After Serpine nearly kills Valkyrie, Skulduggery uses the Sceptre to kill Serpine. He also discovers that Valkyrie can use magic.

   Scaramouch Van Dreg
   during his search for
   Rancid Fines

   Christophe Nocturnal

Scaramouch wakes him up and then reveals to Skulduggery that he has a plan for world domination. Skulduggery questions what Scaramouch would do after taking the world, pointing out all the problems that would come about, and then asks how Scaramouch is planning on doing this. Scaramouch reveals he has bought a box from someone which contains a bug which will sap away all the magic from every sorcerer and give them to him. Skulduggery then asks Scaramouch to release the bug to see if it's really in there. After Scaramouch does so, Skulduggery steps on the bug, killing it. Skulduggery then says that the world needs more villains who only want to take over the world rather than destroy it and arrests Scaramouch.

   Skulduggery aids Valkyrie in defeating
   Vaurien Scapegrace
   , a criminal who is wanted for various murder attempts. The two arrest Scapegrace, and take him to the Irish Sanctuary, where
   Thurid Guild
   , the new Grand Mage, and Mr. Bliss inform them that Baron Vengeous, a general of Mevolent, has escaped. Skulduggery and Valkyrie visit China for information on Vengeous. She tells them that Vengeous is planning to revive the Grotesquery to bring back the Faceless Ones.
  </p>
  <p key="4ecca773-408e-414c-a46b-c17ad5eb65d8">
   The next day, Skulduggery picks up Valkyrie and they head to the pier to see if they find Vengeous. Valkyrie stays behind to check on her reflection, and after Skulduggery goes the pier, saves Valkyrie from a vampire called
   Dusk
   and two
   Infected
   . Dusk drops a syringe, which Skulduggery takes. Skulduggery decides to go to the
   Hibernian Cinema
   , which is a lab that is owned by
   Kenspeckle Grouse
   , to examine the syringe. However, Valkyrie makes a mistake and are forced to leave. Skulduggery takes Valkyrie to
   China's Library
   to meet Tanith, and Skulduggery tells Valkyrie that he has something to do. He won't tell Valkyrie what it is but promises to tell her later. After Valkyrie and Tanith find information on where the Grotesquery is, Skulduggery picks them up. Valkyrie mentions the
   Torment
   , and Skulduggery tells the two he knows someone who knows him. The person is Scapegrace. After telling him that Tanith is a brain sucker, Scapegrace says that the Torment lives in
   Roarhaven
   .
  </p>
  <p key="e6cd18a3-ca4e-475c-a766-dfb2406997e4">
   Skulduggery and Valkyrie, along with Scapegrace, go to Roarhaven. They go to Scapegrace's old pub, where Skulduggery and Valkyrie get into a barfight with some citizens of Roarhaven. When Skulduggery and Valkyrie defeat them, Scapegrace is shackled to a pipe, and the two go in the cellar. They see the Torment, but they are forced to run when he gets hold of Skulduggery's gun. While escaping, a mass amount of spiders chase them. They escape the spiders and come face to face with the Torment.
  </p>
  <p key="f5915c2b-f7d9-4544-af9d-6c5361ee7fe1">
   When asked for the location of the Grotesquery, the Torment asks that in return, Valkyrie is to be killed as she is a descendent of the
   Ancients
   . Skulduggery refuses at first but then agrees. He asks for a minute alone, and the Torment agrees. While alone, Scapegrace escapes and stands next to the Torment. Skulduggery switches Valkyrie with her reflection. It manages to fool the Torment and Scapegrace, and Skulduggery shoots the reflection. Skulduggery forces Scapegrace to get back to the
   Bentley
   . Valkyrie reveals that she is still alive, and the two drop Scapegrace to a cell, and they go to
   Bancrook
   - the location of the Grotesquery.
  </p>
  <p key="a77ae483-a0fa-45e8-907d-7303cfeedc28">
   While in Bancrook, Dusk, Vengeous and some Infected arrive as well. Skulduggery calls for back up, and while they arrive, he distracts them. Vengeous defeats Skulduggery, and Valkyrie reveals herself and stops Vengeous from killing Skulduggery. Skulduggery then saves Valkyrie from Dusk, but Sanguine takes Valkyrie. Sanguine takes Valkyrie to a church, where Valkyrie's blood is used to awaken the Grotesquery. Skulduggery arrives to rescue her and throws a bomb on the Grotesquery. He threatens to blow up the Grotesquery, and Vengeous allows Skulduggery to take Valkyrie back. He tells her that the bomb is just a bag with a collapsible jack inside and the remote opens his garage door. When they escape, Skulduggery tells Valkyrie to steal the van when the Grotesquery is loaded in it. Valkyrie steals the van but crashes it. Skulduggery and Tanith then take Valkyrie to the Hibernian, along with the Grotesquery.
  </p>
  <p key="e9a3f2ad-8467-4b51-94cc-4dd77d90b4e2">
   At the Hibernian, the Grotesquery is awoken and kills
   Stentor
   and
   Civet
   , Kenspeckle's assistants. Tanith is poisoned, and the two take her and escape. They go to the Sanctuary, and Mr. Bliss heals Tanith. Skulduggery and Valkyrie go visit a man called
   Finbar Wrong
   , and pick up a case. Finbar points out that a vampire is following them, who is Dusk. Skulduggery tells Valkyrie that she has to go to the Edgley reunion, and Skulduggery and Tanith would protect her and her family.

   During the reunion, Skulduggery and Tanith are attacked by the Torment. They defeat him and force him to help them defeat the Grotesquery. The two pick up Valkyrie, and they go to
   Clearwater Hospital

They find out that Sanguine is just pretending to work for Vengeous, and is actually working for someone else. During the fight, Vengeous arrives but is killed by the Grotesquery when his plan fails. During the fight, everyone is knocked out, leaving Valkyrie by herself to defeat the Grotesquery. She manages to defeat it, and Sanguine tells her and Skulduggery that the fight has just begun.

   A few months later, Skulduggery and Valkyrie investigate reports of babies going missing. It turns out that a group of
   Goblins
   are holding them to ransom. Valkyrie meets with a zombie, who complains that she is late. The zombie explains that the Muldoons, a goblin trio of brothers, had kidnapped three babies and demanded gold in exchange for their lives. He claims that the Muldoons were descended from powerful sorcerers, even The Ancients, although Valkyrie proves him wrong. They were normal human children, who later became sorcerers. After their father died and their mother went insane, they believed themselves superior to mortals. They attacked a group of mortals, and the Council of Elders ordered them to be ambushed. They escaped, but all three were transformed into goblins, with gold as their only source of returning to human form, making them resort to stealing and exchanging babies. They reach a ruined church, and the zombie leaves for the exchange to take place.

   Fintan

   The session is interrupted when Skulduggery bursts through the ceiling and crashes onto the floor painfully. The goblins reveal that Skulduggery was attacked by their sister,
   Peg

Liam and Peg eventually get the better of the two and overpower them. Liam throttles Valkyrie, but she throws him across the church. Skulduggery summons up a piece of rubble to smash into Peg's face, but soon after, Liam rushes for the babies. Valkyrie quickly elbows him and knocks him unconscious.

   A few months after China's Library was destroyed, a boy named
   Ryan
   was looking around a library. Near him he sees a group of four suspicious strangers, shortly before noticing a tiny silver circle on a shelf. After Ryan picks it up, it burns him, leaving a mark, and the group of four come up to him. Their names are
   Samuel
   ,
   Obloquy
   ,
   Mercy Charient
   and
   Foe
   . They threaten him to go with them, but then Valkyrie shows up to save him. They run through the library throwing fireballs, before getting outside to the Bentley. Skulduggery then gets in and drives them away. During the drive Valkyrie explains some things about magic and it's people to Ryan before coming to an apartment building. She also explains that Foe and his friends need the imprint on Ryan's hand to activate a Doomsday Machine, a bomb that was initially meant to destroy the
   Faceless Ones

   Deacon Maybury
   was a sorcerer who used to belong to Foe's gang, but he betrayed them and stole the key, planning to sell it on.

   They searched Deacon Maybury's trashed apartment looking for clues about his murder. While searching a woman came to the apartment, Francine, looking for Deacon. They explained to her that Deacon had been killed and asked if she knew anything about it. She said she was very close to Deacon and loved him deeply. Ryan returns with her to her apartment. When he tells her it was no trouble at all, Francine tells him there will be trouble. Suddenly, Foe appears and kidnaps him. It is revealed that Francine is just an illusion, and she is really Mercy in disguise. Fortunately, Valkyrie and Skulduggery save him, and they escape by jumping out the window.

   Doomsday Machine

Skulduggery asks Ryan why he doesn't miss his home, and Ryan explains that he was initially planning to run away from home. But Skulduggery tells him that he doesn't have a home. Crasis created Ryan. Ryan is an illusion. And beneath the illusion lies Deacon Maybury. Ryan tells him that he is crazy, but Skulduggery insists that he is telling the truth. Deacon disguised himself so he could hide from Foe's gang, as an average teenage boy. Ryan eventually gives in, and he sits away from the others and weeps. Valkyrie comforts him and tells him that by dismantling the Doomsday Machine he would make Deacon mad.

Foe flees the scene when Samuel unleashes his vampire form. Ryan dismantles the machine, and Valkyrie comforts and kisses him. But then the illusion fades, and Deacon is revealed. Skulduggery tells him that he may escape, but only because Ryan was their friend.

  <p key="9a8c848a-fefb-4f64-b92f-9f0f0d720faf">
   bizarre appearance which he hides while in public with a disguise, is something of a dapper gentleman. He has a polite, old-fashioned way of speech and a velvety-smooth voice which enraptures Valkyrie when they first meet. As well as a powerful sorcerer, more specifically an Elemental, he is particularly enthusiastic about detecting, always searching for clues, much to Valkyrie's and Tanith's chagrin. He is also a flamboyant egotist, vocally exalting his own plans, complimenting himself, and showing off his magical abilities to Valkyrie, at one point walking on the ocean's surface after falling from a cliff.

   Skulduggery is a clever strategist, usually forming the plan the team uses, when they actually have a plan, and sharpening his wit on Valkyrie's, taking pleasure in his own wisecracks. The two partners develop a relationship throughout the books. He also reveals that he used to be great at motivational speeches, although he has obviously lost this talent, as his attempt to psyche up the party before they confront the Grotesquery with:

    "I want you all to know that we are the first line of defence. In fact, we practically the only line of defence. If we fail, there won't be a whole lot anyone else will be able to do. What I'm trying to say is that failure at this point isn't really the smart move to make. We are not to fail, do I make myself absolutely clear? Failure is bad, it won't help us in the short term and certainly won't do us any favours in the long run, and I think I've lost track of this speech, and I'm not too sure where it's headed. But I know where it started and that's what you've got to keep in mind. Has anyone seen my hat?"

   Skulduggery's suave demeanour hides a desire for revenge. Because he died hating Serpine and his hatred brought him back, it forms part of his existence. At Valkyrie's questioning, he describes his true nature as a "dark, twisted thing." Several characters throughout the series have commented about his legendary rage, which manifests itself in the form of
   Lord Vile
   , who is Skulduggery's evil side and shows how deadly the skeleton detective can really be since Lord Vile was arguably the most powerful necromancer who had ever lived. When Skulduggery transforms into Vile, he is capable of appalling acts including slaughtering hundreds of people, one of the most notable being the mother of one of his closest friends Ghastly Bespoke. However, Skulduggery has also shown a very strong will and has managed to fight off his darker urges and managed to help Valkyrie do the same when she transformed into Darquesse. He is also deeply remorseful for the terrible acts he committed as Lord Vile and has spent his entire life, or more accurately his afterlife due to the fact that he was dead, trying to redeem himself. Despite the darker side of his nature, witnessing the murder of his family makes him sensitive to the loss of others. Although he accepts sacrifices from individuals as part of war, he is highly reluctant to allow this to happen. He protects Valkyrie diligently throughout the novels; originally only about to arrest Serpine, he is forced to kill him when he attempts to kill Valkyrie.

   When the Faceless Ones returned to Earth, Skulduggery is sucked into the vortex along with them and trapped with them in a different universe. This ordeal seems to have had a lasting effect on his sanity, testament to this being when Valkyrie came to rescue Skulduggery he thought she was a hallucination and he mentioned he had been hallucinating a lot.

  <p key="00c5f708-ed69-463f-8ed0-f3bebe459581">
   On an interesting note, the head he was wearing was not his own; he won it in a poker game. His real head was stolen from him by goblins while he was asleep. When Skulduggery came back to Earth, a lot of characters believed him to be unhinged, but he said he was faking this side of his personality. Skulduggery particularly hates being shot at, as he finds it very rude.

   While his former appearance remains unknown, although he claims to not have been bad to look at, Skulduggery currently resides in the form of a skeleton. He can commonly be seen wearing suits made by his friend
   Ghastly
   , Skulduggery wears a hat, scarf, wig and glasses to cover up his face when in public, the wig being described as having fuzzy hair. Before the series, he got his
   skull
   stolen by some
   Goblins

   Skulduggery drives a

   , although he has other cars stashed around Ireland, typically brightly coloured Ford Fiestas. In combat he uses his

   . Skulduggery also has a case which contains another gun, some bullets and a bomb spike. During the

   Skulduggery wore black leather, a metal gauntlet that travelled from wrist to shoulder and his gun holstered at his side. He wore this same outfit again during

    Derek Landy revealed in an interview that he never cared or even thought about what Skulduggery looked like when he was alive. This is for the same reason he will never tell his readers if Skulduggery's child was a girl or boy. He said that Skulduggery is who he is and when people read about his past he wants them to only remember that 'his wife and child were murdered'. He said Skulduggery is whole and he wants his readers to only have certain, important details of Skulduggery's past; The rest, including his given name, is irrelevant.
