When he does, the Master says that he's seen her before. She tells him that if he saw a picture of her destroying the world, it wasn't her, it was a god who looked like her. Valkyrie then proceeds to attack the actors and the Master, with the help of

   Omen Darkly
   visits
   Jenan Ispolin
   in prison. Omen tries to chat to Jenan, but he simply asks Omen what he's here for. Omen says he just wants to understand why Jenan stabbed him. Omen has recovered from the wound, but Auger is still healing in hospital. Jenan says he was the leader of Abyssinia's First Wave. They were going to change the world, but Omen and his friends stopped them. So obviously, he wants to kill Omen. Omen says that isn't true, since Abyssinia was just using First Wave - they were going to be framed for killing mortals. Enraged, Jenan tries to attack Omen, but fails. A guard walks in, asking if everything is alright. Omen says Jenan just wanted a hug, and proceeds to leave.

Dexter says it's because Saracen wouldn't tell him his magical ability, which meant that Saracen didn't trust him. Therefore, Dexter couldn't trust Saracen. Saracen says he's here to tell him now. Tanith suggests that before Saracen reveals what his ability is, they should all have a guess. Valkyrie thinks it's something psychic. Skulduggery, however, says he already knows. He questions Saracen about the incident where he told Ravel his ability. Saracen was dying, so revealed what his ability was to Ravel. However, immediately afterwards, he was cured. Skulduggery says that Ravel must have been poisoning Saracen since he was afraid of him reading his mind, but after Saracen revealed his ability, it wasn't a psychic ability, so Ravel let him live. Saracen is surprised and angry at Ravel. Skulduggery concludes that he must be a Lynceus (X-Ray Vision). Everyone is disappointed. Saracen explains that when he chose his discipline, he was still a teenager. He chose X-Ray Vision because he wanted to see through other's clothes. Dexter teases him relentlessly, talking about how if he was an
