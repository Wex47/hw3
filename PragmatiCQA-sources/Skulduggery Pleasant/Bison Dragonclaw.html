   , Dragonclaw was sent to an airport in Dublin to receive Necromancer reinforcements from London. He was, however, intercepted by Skulduggery and Valkyrie, who hoped to stop the reinforcements and used Dragonclaw to infiltrate the Temple. Dragonclaw threatened them and tried to call over an airport guard. However, Skulduggery quickly told the cop that they were just looking for the toilets. They then took him to the toilets and forced him to tell them about the plans of the Necromancers. After a lengthy torture, Dragonclaw gave in, telling them what he had done, as well as how to enter the Necromancer temple, through a secret tunnel.

   After being taken to the tunnel, Skulduggery rendered Dragonclaw unconscious with his gun. When Skulduggery and Valkyrie were later captured, Dragonclaw got ready to torture them. Skulduggery lied about having taken his pen and using it to unlock himself, before he rushed over to Skulduggery and Valkyrie tripped him up. Skulduggery then kicked him in the face with his knee as he fell, and then picked the keys off his body.

   Dragonclaw soon got up, and Skulduggery and Valkyrie were surrounded by him on one side and a group of Necromancers with sub-machine guns on the other. Valkyrie took his gun away from him and elbowed him in the face. However,

   Despite the fact that he is made fun of for his name, it seems that Dragonclaw possessed some skill, as he was used for important black ops. Of course, due to many Necromancer's being inept at combat, as well as Dragonclaw's stupidity during the course of the book, it is possible that Dragonclaw was only used because he was the best available at the time.
