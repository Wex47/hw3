   Scapegrace was brave when he volunteered to go to the Necropolis, and starts being his old arrogant self once back in his original body. When Thrasher falls in battle, Scapegrace starts lamenting why he hadn't been better to Thrasher, and cries over his friend's body. But when Thrasher came back to life, Scapegrace insisted that what he said was nothing important.

    Vaurien is a French word translating to "ruffian" or "scoundrel." Scapegrace is an archaic English word  that means essentially the same thing, so both of Scapegrace's names are synonymous for villain.
