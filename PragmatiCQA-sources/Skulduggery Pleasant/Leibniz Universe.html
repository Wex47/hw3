   When Nadir wakes up from his coma (when he is shunting the prison through dimensions), he reaches for Valkryie’s arm and uses his magic in a way that means she will shunt into a different dimension. He has no recollection of doing this, and it is later revealed that this was caused by Armageddion controlling him.

   and the sorcerers rule the mortals, who are almost like slaves. Sense-Wardens and Redhoods (similar to Cleavers, but wearing red) roam the streets—Sense-Wardens read the minds of the mortals and they are taken away if they think anti-Mevolent thoughts. Several cities exist, including  Dublin-Within-The-Wall,
   Tahil na Sin
   and Tahil na Kurge. Initially, Valkryie thinks that the universe diverged from hers when Mevolent didn’t die, but they later theorise that it was Skulduggery not taking off Lord Vile’s armour that changed things.

   It is also infested with the Draugr which Lord Vile created to kill everyone as he felt that he needed to kill everyone to end human suffering. This is also one of the reasons that Mevolent wanted to enter our dimension.
