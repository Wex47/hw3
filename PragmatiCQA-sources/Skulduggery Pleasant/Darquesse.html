However, she cools herself, and the shadows tighten around her, becoming like a second skin. Skulduggery attempts to negotiate with her, but Darquesse says that Valkyrie is gone, not even a little voice in her head. She says that she does not want to kill her parents, she just wants to be alive and free. Darquesse then flies off.

   When in grave danger - such as being on the brink of death -, Valkyrie subconsciously allows Darquesse to take over her mind and body. As Darquesse, Valkyrie can wield a unique type of magic, possibly Ancient magic, which grants her a huge amount of strength, allowing her to break boulders, crush skulls, and punch through bones with ease. She also has the ability to fly, the ability to see and manipulate someone's consciousness. Darquesse can also dull pain and has the ability to heal even her brain and organs, making her practically invincible. Darquesse can survive injuries that would easily kill a normal mage, even one as powerful as Skulduggery. Darquesse can even withstand having her head ripped off, though she admitted there was a strong chance she'd have died had she not magically repaired herself within seven seconds. Complete destruction of the brain would kill her - however, this is almost impossible do due to her ability to heal any and all wounds magically. Darquesse has been shown to be capable of disintegrating regular humans, turning them to ash with a mere gesture. In addition, Valkyrie's normal skills, such as

   it is shown that her power has grown greatly, as she defeats Lord Vile with moderate difficulty, and even later states that she has surpassed him. She is also shown to have the ability to see Magic, sensing its presence and nature in other beings. She can understand different people's abilities, how strong they are, and how they will use it. She can also manifest her magic in the form of telekinesis, such as using it to break Kitana's leg and moving her body towards her decapitated head.

   Currently, the precise limits of Darquesse's power are unknown. As of
   2012
   , she is roughly equal to Mevolent, if not slightly stronger - however, it has been shown that her power is increasing exponentially every time she emerges. Argeddion also states that she is learning and becoming powerful faster than he did, as she easily mastered the ability to see magic, while it took him many months. It is known that Darquesse has been prophesied to extinguish all life on Earth, and eventually the planet itself. By
   2013
   Darquesse has completely taken over. She could tear another mage apart with a casual flick of her wrist, destroy a thousand powerful Witches and an army of Warlocks, other mages, Wretchlings and several supercharged sorcerers. By
   2014
   she is sufficiently powerful to destroy a large part of Roarhaven, absorb thousands of remnants, atomize living beings, erase matter, energy and souls from existence, and even travel to the dimension of the Faceless Ones. It was also said that even weakened, Darquesse could defeat Lord Vile (even after he was supercharged by the Accelerator). At almost her full power, she survives a combined assault by Valkyrie (with invincibility), Melancholia, and supercharged Lord Vile, and manages to defeat all of them with a large blast of energy. Skulduggery would later go on to state that despite this she would not be able to defeat more than two Faceless Ones, let alone a whole race of them after she was tricked into leaving her native reality for theirs. Strongly Implying that she would meet her demise at their hands. This, however, proved to be incorrect, as Darquesse had indeed survived her incursion into The Faceless Ones reality only to be locked in a stalemate as neither side possessed the means to kill the other.
