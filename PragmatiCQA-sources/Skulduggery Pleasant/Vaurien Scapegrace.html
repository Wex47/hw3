    Clarabelle
   </a>
   is in danger and the Sheriff is preoccupied with a child in jeopardy, he and Thrasher run to the fountain.
Scapegrace and Thrasher intend to distract the Wraiths  but are almost killed, only to be saved by the Black Cleaver. Scapegrace, Thrasher and an overly grateful Clarabelle barricade themselves in an empty building.
Clarabelle tells Scapegrace that he is her hero and he has a moment of personal triumph and validation, only for it to be ruined by Thrasher who he orders to "stand over there and don't speak for the rest of the night".

   It is implied that Scapegrace and the others move towards the sanctuary and away from the wall along with the rest of the Roarhaven citizens.

   Clarabelle, Scapegrace and Thrasher live together in a small house near the pub they manage. Near the end of the book Scapegrace and Thrasher help defeat Darquesse by entering Merryn-ta-Uul and activating the Merryn sigil.

   During the course of the series, it is conclusive that Vaurien is very clumsy and sloppy with his "murders". He builds up a very impressive self-introduction, describing himself as 'the killer supreme', but does not live up to his stakes as he is shown to be a coward. He bluffs a lot.
  </p>
  <p key="061c10ad-0fff-435e-9171-c2d9834f3ef5">
   Scapegrace also has the inability to cope with his zombified state and the fact that he will eventually decompose and "die" a second time and tends towards using things such as freezers and car fresheners to keep himself from smelling awful and rotting away. He takes his aggressions out on poor
   Thrasher
   who only lives to serve his master in an attempt to save him from himself.
  </p>
  <p key="eccb776d-4bb1-4e41-ac39-d96fe361a7f5">
   But Scapegrace seems to have a soft spot for Clarabelle, as he ran to her rescue during the battle of Roarhaven. And soon after, he starts to soften towards Thrasher as he can no longer summon his anger. This is because he misses his old body.
  </p>
  <p key="fd3f71f3-b05a-4f44-90d9-a311df5ac86e">
   Scapegrace was brave when he volunteered to go to the Necropolis, and starts being his old arrogant self once back in his original body. When Thrasher falls in battle, Scapegrace starts lamenting why he hadn't been better to Thrasher, and cries over his friend's body. But when Thrasher came back to life, Scapegrace insisted that what he said was nothing important.

    Vaurien is a French word translating to "ruffian" or "scoundrel." Scapegrace is an archaic English word  that means essentially the same thing, so both of Scapegrace's names are synonymous for villain.
