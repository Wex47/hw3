    Apostles of Darquesse

   were created by

    The Darquesse Society
   </a>
   . The apostles admire Darquesse and her power, many were present on Devasation Day and recount their experience. They selected one of their number, Sebastian, to wear his suit, in order to locate Darquesse. His sacrifice is greatly admired by other members of the group, who subsequently attempt to facilitate him further in his efforts. The society is largely democratic in its decisions, and members such as Forby and Sebastian are recognised as being very important to the functioning of the group.

   Many of the members believe Darquesse will help prevent the catasrophes like Global Warming that are plaguing humanity. This is seemingly consolidated by the theory that
