   When Tanith was a young girl, she was sent by her parents to become a Hidden Blade under the teaching of
   <a href="Quoneel.html" key="f2f3f9dc-6b4f-4ca9-b505-ec4af430ce86" title="Quoneel">
    Quoneel
   </a>
   . There, she learned combat, stealth and Wall-Walking as well as unlocking locks. She took the name Tanith after the first person she killed when in training. When she was old enough, she left Quoneel and the other students and became a mercenary and bounty hunter. After an encounter with Mr. Bliss where she nearly died trying to save his life, he took an interest in her and she began to work for the English Sanctuary. She has an older brother, another Hidden Blade, whom she "loves to death" but she has always wanted a sister she could share her secrets with. Over the course of the books Valkyrie and Tanith grow very close and regarded each other almost as sisters.

   is condensed and somewhat vague. All we know is that Tanith dislikes him and calls him a "coward". But in the fifth book their thoughts on each other are elaborated. Sanguine admits to Valkyrie that he has feelings for Tanith- which Tanith clearly does not reciprocate, despite Billy-ray being confident that she does. Billy-Ray's feelings for her contradict what happened in the last few books, in which he took part in a group which kidnapped and tortured her (

   . However, after Tanith is posessed by a Remnant, she dates him and they are now on the run. Tanith refers to him as "Honey" and Billy-Ray to her as "Honey Bunny". Valkyrie finds their relationship "disgusting and unnatural".

   , Tanith is the first to speak to Ghastly after he is ressurected from his statue-like-state, being seen hugging him and saying "how great" it is to have him back.

   when Tanith gives an opinion on Ghastly's facade, which allows him to look like he doesn't have any scars: "Nice, I like it. But I dig scars too." However, the couple only officially became canon in the fifth book, when Ghastly admits to Skulduggery and Erskine Ravel that he has had feelings for Tanith for years. It is implied that he didn't admit to it out of fear of rejection and general shyness. Near the end of the book, Ghastly finally asks her out on a date. He invites her to a homemade dinner, to which Tanith asks him to take off his façade. When he does so, Tanith kisses him and says "I like steak, you can't go wrong with steak." To which Ghastly replies "Steak it is." Sadly, their relationship was cut short when Tanith was possessed by a Remnant and runs off with Sanguine before their date. Since then, Ghastly spent the majority of his time (largely in vain) tracking her down. He and Tanith share a kiss in
