   The White Cleaver was originally one of the two Cleavers sent to help

   rescue Skulduggery Pleasant. The Cleavers were used as a distraction by Tanith to distract a small army of Hollow Men shortly after the mission started and although Tanith hated the decision she reluctantly said "that the Cleavers had a job to do and they had theirs". The Cleavers stood back to back and despite being heavily outnumbered, inflicted heavy casualties to the Hollow Men.
One of the Cleavers was killed. However, one was needed to test Serpine's experiment. The
   Hollow Men
   carried the Cleaver to Nefarian Serpine where he conducted the surgery, changing the Cleaver from a fierce enforcer to a glassy-eyed test subject. Serpine killed the Cleaver for the final procedure. Minutes passed and Serpine saw a slight movement and to his pleasure, the Cleaver blinked. So came the White Cleaver - a "pet" to Serpine and a new powerful enemy for Skulduggery and Valkyrie. The Cleaver due to its odd creation had shown some strange signs. It is clearly undead, yet Serpine stated that he would never dig in with the freaks of that nature. This may hint that the Cleaver can show some signs of life, for example, pain.

   Shortly after its creation, the White Cleaver was sent to ambush Skulduggery and kill Valkyrie in an attempt to weaken him into a rage; for he knew that in rage Skulduggery would be weaker than normal. While Skulduggery, Ghastly, Valkryie, and Tanith were investigating the warehouse in which the surgery took place the Cleaver dropped down from the roof, Valkyrie quickly noticed it and raised the alarm, allowing the others to quickly react to this unusual Cleaver's presence. Noticing that the assassin was one of the Cleaver's from the castle rescue Skulduggery attempted to reason with it. When he asked what the Cleaver wanted, he pointed at Valkyrie, which Skulduggery merely replied "That's all we need to know" with the three fighters attempting to best their undead assassin. But in the end, they were all beaten, and Ghastly was forced to use the protective Earth Elemental magic, which turned him into a statue.       
At the end of Skulduggery Pleasant, the White Cleaver battles Tanith Low. The Cleaver proves too powerful for her and stabs Tanith with his scythe, and nearly kills her. The White Cleaver is summoned by Serpine during the final fight. It is told to kill Stephanie, but when Serpine ordered the final blow, it ignored and deserted him.

   As a product of alteration the Cleaver was nearly impossible to destroy because of its Necromancy healing powers. Not only did the Cleaver get shot and survive with little to no wounds, it survived being impaled by its own scythe.
