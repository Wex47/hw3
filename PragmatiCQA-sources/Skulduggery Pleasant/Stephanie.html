   Skulduggery Pleasant

   After their meeting with the Elders, the pair broke into the Vault and consulted an

   At Gordon's house, they encountered Serpine and his

Together with the Grotesquery, he kills the Cleavers and beats Skulduggery and Valkyrie into submission. Valkyrie "tricks" Vengeous into releasing her, saying that she will join him and kill Skulduggery, but she releases China who attacks Vengeous and the Grotesquery. This gives Valkyrie time to free Skulduggery, who joins in the assault against Vengeous, tearing off his helmet and breastplate. Valkyrie ignites the protective clothing beneath with a fireball and Skulduggery shoots him in the stomach. In a swoon, Vengeous crawls toward the Grotesquery but his god callously breaks the baron's neck. The Torment subsequently arrives and attacks the Grotesquery but he is defeated.

   Returning to the surface with Skulduggery, Valkyrie goes home to say goodbye to her parents who are leaving on their second honeymoon. Surprisingly, Remus Crux arrives at her door and, after the departure of her parents, Valkyrie is chased down and eventually arrested. Crux intentionally puts her in a cell with Scapegrace who was badly beaten up by the Cleavers after his little distraction stunt. Scapegrace tries to kill Valkyrie but she manages to knock him out and ties him to a bed by his broken fingers. She is then able to trick a security guard into letting her out of her cell and she knocks him out and takes Scapegrace with her as he could be used as a distraction.

She tries to run, letting Valkyrie fall to the ground as she does, and Valkyrie trips her causing her to fall into the blue light, killing her and saving Bliss. Valkyrie then runs out of the Sanctuary and escapes with Skulduggery to Aranmore Farm, where the battle has already ensued.

Valkyrie takes the spectre and fires black lightning twice into the Faceless One that had consumed Krav, killing it. The second Faceless One attacks China, Skulduggery and Valkyrie. Fletcher appears and teleports Valkyrie out of the way. The Faceless One pulls the Sceptre out of Valkyrie's hand and shatters it, destroying the black crystal, and itself.

   Skulduggery decides to get the last Faceless One to chase Valkyrie and go through a new portal which Fletcher should open. The Faceless One charges at Skulduggery instead, lifting him off the ground. Wreath, with a broken leg, gives Valkyrie his cane full of his Necromantic power and she uses it to knock the Faceless One back as the cane is destroyed. The Faceless One shoots out tentacles made of its organs in a last attempt to save itself. The tentable whips around Skulduggery and pulls him through the portal with it. The portal closes before anyone can do anything to help. Valkyrie and her team are victorious, but also defeated by the loss of Skulduggery.

   Valkyrie and Skulduggery are called in to investigate the murder of a person in their living room. Geoffrey Scrutinous is there too, talking to the police officers. Geoffrey inspects a pen and a piece of paper reading "I'm going to be hit by a train." Confirming the victim's handwriting, they come to the conclusion the person didn't know he was writing. This is confirmed when Geoffrey looks down in shock at his own hand writing the words "I'm going to be eaten by a shark." He drops the pen, frightened, and Valkyrie suggests that the pen may be cursed. Skulduggery says Geoffrey has twelve hours before a shark may in fact eat him.
  </p>
  <p key="3974e9a3-bb76-4715-ace5-39a91475b4e8">
   The trio sits in a diner, discussing where the murdered person worked. Skullduggery makes some calls and finds four people were killed in the last two weeks. He comes to the conclusion that the pen was handed down from person to person and each of them was killed in turn. The curse started with a sorcerer named Elwood Satchel. The three take the Bentley to a person who knew Satchel well. Not at home, they wait for him in the car.
  </p>
  <p key="0cd46734-9ca3-415f-8fb1-d06945b713e7">
   He returns the next morning and tells them how Satchel died. He said Satchel was electrocuted while running. A few days later they found a note, left by Satchel. Skulduggery asked if Satchel had any enemies. The man mentions another sorcerer named
   Davit Maybury
   , who Satchel had stolen his girlfriend from.
  </p>
  <p key="a6b34c0b-93bb-4427-b776-83b67d3ddabd">
   The trio goes to Maybury's house, but no-one answered the door. When Geoffrey has only 15 minutes until he is going to be eaten. Skulduggery finds a door in Maybury's bedroom. Geoffrey notices the carpet is wet and soggy. Skulduggery calls out to Maybury through the door, but nothing happens. Geoffrey asks where the water is coming from, but Valkyrie says there is no water. Geoffrey sees a fish but he is the only one to experience it. Skulduggery looks for a way to open the door, without noticing it, he does. The go down a room with a dead Maybury sitting in the armchair. Geoffrey panics, but Skulduggery tries to calm him by telling a useless story.
  </p>
  <p key="469f6817-da97-4687-8fec-562a75895d44">
   Skulduggery looks at the cursed pen and cracks the outer shell. He sees four symbols engraved on the inside. Skulduggery notices one symbol is incorrect, which made the curse pass from person to person instead of one person. Geoffrey's teeth start chattering. Skulduggery rings China Sorrows to see if he can correct the symbol. Geoffrey notices the shark's dorsal fin poking out of the water. Valkyrie jumps in front of him but knows that won't do anything. Skulduggery starts talking to China about the symbol. Geoffrey starts shouting, saying that the shark is coming. Skulduggery tells Geoffrey to stop shouting. Valkyrie tells him to scare it away by splashing, but China says not to splash about. Skulduggery continues talking and takes up a scalpel and tries to correct the mistake.
  </p>
  <p key="2f10e012-76d7-4f6e-8e5a-ae21ce712a20">
   The Shark comes for Geoffrey, Valkyrie grabs his arm and pulls him away at the last second. But she drops him again, under water. He looks for the shark and sees it coming for him. But at that time, the water disappears and so does the shark. Geoffrey thanks Valkyrie for saving him and says he owes her a favour now. Skulduggery wonders why he doesn't get a thank you too and Geoffrey merely said, Skulduggery told him to shut up while he was "dying" and walked away.

It tells Valkyrie that she forgot to touch the grass. Fletcher then decided to go to Italy to get some pizza. While he buys the pizza, Melancholia visits Valkyrie in her home and with her new Necromancy skills, she heavily wounds Valkyrie. She barely manages to call Fletcher, and he teleports her to the Sanctuary for treatment. It turns out Nye is the new doctor, but it manages to save Valkyrie's life. Valkyrie wakes up and tries to threaten Nye. However, Nye knows that Valkyrie is somehow involved with Darquesse due to the mutterings and hallucinations as it performed on her to seal her true name. It says that if she tells the sanctuary about the experiments he has been conducting, he will tell the Elders about her involvement in it all and it would raise all sorts of "awkward questions." In the night Valkyrie is visited by Caelan, who is upset over not being able to protect Valkyrie. She tries to make a joke of the situation but fails. Caelan then proposes to Valkyrie but rejects him in horror.

They manage to capture Bison who, after interrogation, reveals that Necromancers are arriving soon to assist the Temple. Leaving Valkyrie to stop them alone, she manages to sneak into arrivals and stalls the Necromancers by forcing the police on them. Valkyrie returns to Skulduggery, who tells her that Dragonclaw will show them a secret tunnel into the Temple. They arrive and sneak into the Temple to find Melancholia. They split up but Valkyrie runs into Solomon Wreath, who knocks her out. She waked up in a room to find out Skulduggery has also been captured.

After being hit by a bus during the battle and continuously beaten up she begins to hear the voice of Darquesse saying "let me out" but ignores it as Skulduggery re-joins the fight and the pair of them manage to overpower the wolf enough to insert a tranquilizer dart into its bloodstream.

China asks why Valkyrie really came to her, She says that her parents expect her to go to college and study but she keeps wanting to work at the Sanctuary but also does not want to get too distant from other mortals. China says that its called Second Lifetime Syndrome and it happens when sorcerers watch her friends or family die around them. Valkyrie suggests that she could tell her parents about magic but China strongly advises her against that since Valkyrie's parents' lives will be ruined with fear and worry and will struggle with their lives and won't be able to cope about magic which ruined her Dad's life.

She and Kes first hear a man whistling, something that they have heard before and have taken to calling “The Whistler.” Next they see Auger and Omen, stumbling along a street littered with bodies, pursued by men with guns. The men slaughter Omen and Auger, as the vision melts into the Plague Doctor, holding a child. Then Saracen Rue is lying dead on the ground, and Tabita backing into a corner with her sword. The vision goes to China lying in a field of broken glass, and the High Sanctuary burned as an army led by Mevolent marched. When Valkyrie sees Abyssinia, Kes tells her to break away the vision.

Example: She had to kill Omen Darkley (but used Kes, figment of Darquesse, to fake his death), fight cannibals and be hunted by jockeys through a hedge maze. She rescues Alice with Skulduggerys help but discovers that Alice has no soul, because she was technically killed by Valkyrie in the Dying of the Light. This means she is always happy and can never be angry or sad or traumatised.  Valkyrie is distraught and runs away and Skulduggery promises to her that that they will fix Alice.

   Throughout the series, Valkyrie's skill in elemental magic steadily grows, from an absolute amateur incapable of performing magic when panicking to the stage of a reasonably powerful Elemental, capable of besting sorcerers far more experienced than she herself is. She displays great potency with Fire and Air but shows little aptitude with Water and even less in Earth, due to her not being interested in the former and the fact that the latter turns one into a stone statue.

   When in grave danger - such as being on the brink of death, Valkyrie subconsciously allowed Darquesse to take over her mind and body. As Darquesse, Valkyrie could wield a unique type of magic, possibly Ancient or Faceless Ones' magic, which granted her a huge amount of strength, allowing her to break boulders, crush skulls, and punch through bones with ease. It also gave her the ability to fly, the ability to see and manipulate someone's consciousness. Darquesse can also dull pain and has the ability to heal even her brain and organs, making her practically invincible. Darquesse can survive injuries that would easily kill a normal mage, even one as powerful as Skulduggery. Darquesse can even withstand having her head ripped off, though she admitted there was a strong chance she'd have died had she not magically repaired herself within seven seconds. Complete destruction of the brain would kill her - however, this is almost impossible do due to her ability to heal any and all wounds magically. Darquesse has been shown to be capable of disintegrating regular humans, turning them to ash with a mere gesture. In addition, Valkyrie's normal skills, such as

Argeddion also states that she is learning and becoming powerful faster than he did, as she easily mastered the ability to see magic, while it took him many months. It is known that Darquesse has been prophesied to extinguish all life on Earth, and eventually the planet itself. By
   2013
   Darquesse has completely taken over. She could tear another mage apart with a casual flick of her wrist, destroy a thousand powerful Witches and an army of Warlocks, other mages, Wretchlings and several supercharged sorcerers. By
   2014
   she is sufficiently powerful to destroy a large part of Roarhaven, absorb thousands of remnants, atomise living beings and even travel to the dimension of the Faceless Ones. It was also said that even weakened, Darquesse could defeat Lord Vile (even after he was supercharged by the Accelerator). At almost her full power, she survives a combined assault by Valkyrie (with invincibility), Melancholia, and supercharged Lord Vile, and manages to defeat all of them with a large blast of energy. However, it was stated that she could not defeat more than two Faceless Ones.

   Valkyrie first met Skulduggery when he rescued her from a sorcerer who attacked her in her house. At the time she was still known as Stephanie Edgely and had no knowledge of magic or even any idea that it existed. Skulduggery introduced her to the magical world and they became close friends and partners. Despite bickering regularly, they are fiercely loyal to each other. Shortly after their first meeting, Skulduggery killed Serpine in order to protect her, having originally intended to only arrest him and at one point Valkyrie even went into the world of the Faceless Ones in order to rescue him from the evil gods.

  <p key="6a71c3aa-0f9c-4472-b587-a199720d117c">
   Skulduggery was Valkyrie's mentor and usually acted as the leader in their relationship but due to Valkyrie's tendency to disobey orders she often didn't do what he said. Skulduggery was often exasperated by this but actually liked her headstrong nature. The Skeleton Detective also acted as her protector and despite Valkyrie's steadily increasing powers it was implied that there were still many sorcerers who could kill her easily; the reason they didn't was that they were frightened of suffering from Skulduggery's legendary rage.
  </p>
  <p key="77a67a9f-8902-4851-b04f-b00fab9a5f26">
   Skulduggery accepted that Valkyrie was Darquesse very easily, due to the fact that he possessed a ferocious dark side in the form of Lord Vile. However, it took Valkyrie a bit longer to accept that Skulduggery had once been the evilest and powerful Necromancer in the history of magic. She eventually forgave him and Skulduggery also managed to snap her out of Darquesse's control, after fighting off his own dark side during their ferocious battle.

While still retaining her core behaviour and principals, as Darquesse is simply a darker version of her and not a separate entity, they are greatly twisted. She retains her witty, sarcastic personality, but it becomes cruel and malicious rather than playful. She relishes in causing and feeling pain and violence and is constantly seeking opponents who can actually challenge her. However, it has been noted that Darquesse is not inherently evil - simply cold, uncaring and above all curious in regards to her abilities and their limits. She is willing to ally herself with those who would usually be opposed to her, valuing self-preservation above all else.

   Valkyrie is usually described as pretty (with a cute lil' dimple), having straight long dark brown hair and dark intense eyes. She is tall for her age and has a slim body with broad shoulders. It is said on many occasions that she is strong. She commonly wears the clothes made for her by

   which first included, a black tunic and tight trousers, long boots, and a three-quarter length coat, which are near-impenetrable. Later she gets a coat with sleeves as red as dried blood and a black jacket. The outfit after that is fully black. Before succumbing to Darquesse she is seen wearing a pink shirt the

   she is only seen in regular clothes (jeans and t-shirt) for a good portion of the book. She claims that the jacket was getting snug around her shoulders, though this was probably to disguise her unwillingness in committing to return to the magical world. When she accepts her role as Skulduggery's partner again, she dons the black despite the snugness. As of "Seasons of War" she starts wearing a stolen necromancer suit which can be activated by using a amulet in the shape of a skull. It also includes a protected hood in which she can pull down and will become the shape of skull, which like Skulduggery's façade is slightly different every single time she pulls it down.

    The name "Valkyrie" comes from the Norse warrior women who guard Valhalla (she first heard the name after hearing "Rise of the Valkyries"). The name "Cain" came to her mind when Skulduggery claimed she had a "penchant for raising cain," which means that she causes trouble.

    It is revealed she is afraid of penguins, zoos, and falling into a penguin enclosure.
    However, it is likely just a joke. She does, however, have claustrophobia: a fear of enclosed spaces.
