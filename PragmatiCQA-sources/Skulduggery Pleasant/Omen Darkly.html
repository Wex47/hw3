   a few minutes after his brother Auger to
   Emmeline Darkly
   and
   Caddock Sirroco
   . Through his mother, Omen is a member of the Legacy family Darkly. Where he grew up, the magical community harbors a deep distrust of their mortal neighbors.

   At Corrival Academy, Omen was socially overshadowed by his older brother Auger, who was the most popular kid in school due to his natural good looks, charisma, and fame as related to the Darkly Prophecy. Omen, however, blended into the background. He made few friends, one of whom and his best friend was the teleporter-student

    Resurrection

   takes place during Omen's third year at Corrival Academy. Omen is recruited by Skulduggery Pleasant and Valkyrie Cain to keep an eye out for suspicious activity at Corrival Academy, where they believe the Anti-Sanctuary is recruiting young and impressionable students.
  </p>
  <p key="7bd62e9b-9a3d-4124-8526-39d5781276b3">
   Omen wanders around the school, spying on teachers and students by following them around for a bit and listening to their conversations. Mr. Peccant finds him and chastises him for missing Maths class, and issues Omen detention the next day.
   Filament Sclavi
   comes over after Peccant leaves, noting how Peccant must really hate Omen. He asks Omen whether he's interested in sports, to which Omen replies that he never really got the point of it. Filament asks Omen to join the rugby team but Omen declines. They talk for a bit about what living with Auger must be like, and when Filament sees someone else and waves, he departs, telling Omen that it was good to meet him and that although they passed each other loads of times, he never had a reason to talk to him until now.
  </p>
  <p key="74b404ca-6497-4902-b3e7-210e13933a7d">
   During dinner, Omen watches people eating with their separate groups. He starts to suspect Jenan and his friends as potential recruits for the Anti-Sanctuary when he recalls their derogatory remarks about mortals that were harsher than the norm. Omen also remembers that Jenan's group is part of a History study group led by their teacher
   Parthenios Lilt
   , who shares a similar outlook on mortals.
  </p>
  <p key="3892dee8-cd1c-4676-ab25-47c54711d2c6">
   During breakfast the next day, Never sits with Omen and accuses him of avoiding her, to which he denies. She tells him he's been acting weird and that she noticed him spying on people yesterday. Omen asks her whether she thinks anyone else noticed and she says probably not, due to Omen's apparent gift of people having a tendency to ignore him. Omen tells Never that he can't let her know what he's been up to, and that they kept secrets from each other all the time. Never remarks that Skulduggery and Valkyrie visited the school yesterday and starts to get angry about Valkyrie being here. Omen quickly shuts down the conversation and they go to History class.
  </p>
  <p key="17cd9e70-ae34-42cd-9cbd-2b4e8c5ac74e">
   After History class, Omen asks Never if she knew how to join Arcanum's Scholars, the History study group Jenan and his friends are part of. She tells him about the secret meetings in the fifth-floor library. Miss Wicked tells them to get to their next class, and Never tells Omen he left his bag (with his timetable) in History.
  </p>
  <p key="f9f395d2-2682-4bfb-9aba-4fe321597d6c">
   Later during detention, Omen asks Never (who doesn't actually have detention and is just keeping Omen company) to do his Maths work for him, and Never talks to him about what he was like when he first got here and "how

   guy". Omen tells her that since he couldn't get his parents' approval no matter how hard he tried, he stopped trying. Augur shows up to detention, looking for Miss Ethel who was supposed to be supervising. After Augur leaves, Never asks Omen if he thinks his brother would ever take him on one of his adventures, but Omen says that after seeing his brother get hurt all the time, the novelty wears thin.
  </p>
  <p key="e83f5e60-5551-482a-9169-d2013570802f">
   After detention, Omen sneaks into the Arcanum's Scholars' secret meeting, hiding behind a bookcase. Omen overhears the students talking about Skulduggery and Valkyrie's fight with the Anti-Sanctuary. Jenan declares that they chose "the winning team", though
   Byron Grace
   , one of Jenan's group, expresses his doubts. Omen sees a golden mask in Byron's bag and uses Air Elemental magic to pull it to him. Mr Lilt enters the room and commands everyone to put on their ceremonial masks. As Omen just stole Byron's, Byron apologetically leaves the room to get the spare one from Mr Lilt's office. As he leaves, Omen hears Mr Lilt comment that they would probably have to kill Byron.
  </p>
  <p key="2e5bfaf2-71ce-420a-b92b-70ffc0fde406">
   Later that night, Omen goes to meet with Skulduggery Pleasant, who informs him the Mr Lilt has been arrested thanks to Omen. Omen asks Skulduggery Pleasant about his injury, and he replies that he's fine now. Skulduggery also tells Omen that his mission is over, despite Omen's protests that he could still be useful.
  </p>
  <p key="2e309f83-96c9-40b1-88be-0f3a1c253e54">
   The next day, Omen, who is feeling quite sorry for himself not that he felt he is no longer part of something special, sees Jenan's friends slipping away to another secret meeting and follows them, despite Skulduggery telling him his mission was over. Omen puts on the mask he stole from Byron and joins the group as they meet with the Anti-Sanctuary, who calls Jenan's group the First Wave.
   Nero
   , the Anti-Sanctuary's teleporter, notices that there were ten of them when there were supposed to be nine, and tells the rest of the group. Lethe singles out Omen and Omen backed into the curtain, where he finds a door that leads to the balcony. Jenan approaches him but Omen shoves him back and quickly enters through the door. With nowhere else to go but down, Omen starts to climb but Nero teleports him, startling him so much he lost his grip and fell. Nero catches him, only to let go and leave Omen plummeting to his death. However, Omen was saved by Mr. Peccant, who saw him falling and pulled in him. Peccant questions Omen, who was still wearing his mask, but Omen ran away.
  </p>
  <p key="4aa45102-01d9-4b21-a90c-0d89462f569f">
   Omen, shaken by the ordeal, attends Miss Gnosis's meditation session and starts to calm down. Omen suddenly notices Jenan looking at him and starts to panic. However, Auger seems to have noticed too and goes up to Omen at the end of the lesson, rescuing him from Jenan. Omen follows Jenan to his room and hides under a bed as Nero appears again. Nero asks Jenan if he found the spy yet and Jenan replies that Omen is his top suspect. Nero tells him that if it is Omen, then Jenan must kill both him and Augur (as he believes that if Omen knows, then Augur probably knows too). Just as Nero is about to teleport away, Omen reaches out and touches the tip of Nero's shoe, so that Nero takes Omen with him.

   Omen and Temper approach Valkyrie, who recently fought a now-possessed Skulduggery, and ask her what the plan is. Valkyrie gets angry because of Omen's involvement, insisting that it's too early for him for this kind of thing. However, she eventually lets him in on a plan to find
   Richard Melior
   and
   Savant Vega
   by searching their old home in San Francisco.

   Omen tells Never about the First Wave and the Anti-Sanctuary. Miss Gnosis takes them out of class to meet Valkyrie, who Never hates as she blames Darquesse (and therefore Valkyrie) for the death of her brother. However, Never reluctantly agrees to teleport Omen, Valkyrie, and Temper to San Francisco to search Merlior's old home. As Omen went back to his room for a change of clothes, Jenan attacks him and starts to choke him with the full intention of killing Omen. However, he is apprehended by Miss Wicked, who orders him to go to the infirmary.

   Never takes Omen and the others to San Francisco, where they met an old neighbor of Merlior and Savant's named Bridget who tells them the house was demolished years ago. However, Bridget kept some of their stuff that Omen and the others can go through. Omen finds a photograph of Merlior, Savant, Lilt, and an unknown man and woman. As they were about to return to Roarhaven, Omen was hit in the back of the head and knocked out.

   Never teleports Omen back to Roarhaven, where he was sent to Corrival Academy's infirmary with a concussion. Augur visits him and asks him what happened, and Omen responds only vaguely. Augur tells him that their parents called and asked what Omen was up to, to which Augur told them nothing. They talk about their respective roles: Augur as "the Chosen One" and Omen as "the Lucky One", which elicits a surprised reaction from Omen, who didn't know Augur thought of him that way. Augur tells Omen that Jenan's been expelled and that Jenan and his friends went missing. Filament came by later and they talk about the runaways, and he tells Omen that Byron split off from the group after an argument.

   Valkyrie visits Omen with her dog Xena, who has taken an instant liking to Omen. They talk about their different lives growing up, as Omen lived his whole life knowing about magic, as well as how to find Byron. After getting Byron's address from Miss Gnosis, Valkyrie brings Omen along with her to see him, as she thought a familiar face would help calm Byron down. Byron tells them about the Anti-Sanctuary's plans with the First Wave and why he quit and reveals that he had a tracking sigil on him and all he wanted to do was spend some time with his family before they find him.

   Omen and Skulduggery have a conversation at the fountain near the Clock Monument. Skulduggery tells Omen that everyone is worried about him. Omen asks Skulduggery about his facade and China's magic. Omen admits that he's hiding because everyone is mad at him, to which Skulduggery replies that plenty more people are mad at Skulduggery and that his family is only mad because they care about him. He also tells Omen that he's proud of him. Omen tells Skulduggery that he doesn't want to go back to being ordinary, and Skulduggery replies that he's "one of them" now, and they'll call them if they need him.

   He is captured by The First Wave, so they can leave him behind for the mortals. This however does not work as Omen telepathically calls Auger for help. Auger's worry is seen to escalate quickly as Omen explains that he was teleported along with the first wave to the Pearl Harbour where Abyssinia plans to execute mortals. Auger pleads for his brother to stay safe, telling him 'do not try to be a hero', however Omen counters that he cannot stand by while people are killed. Omen is then attacked by Slyboots, he manages to hit him a few times but is ultimately overthrown, but is saved by his brother who arrived just in time along with Never.

   After Auger defeats Slyboots he helps Omen stand up and reprimands Omen for almost getting killed, and trying to be a hero despite Auger telling him not to. Omen counters that because he was losing the fight he wasn't being a hero, to which Auger replies 'You don't have to win to be the hero'. Upon seeing Never Omen notes how tired he looks, Never greets Omen with a hug, thumps him then hugs him again to show that she is glad he is alive but he is mad at him for putting himself in danger. Along the way Omen is seen aiding his bother to get to safety, after he had been shot, and it is at this point where Valkyrie prevents the vision she saw of the twins from becoming reality.

Omen then falls to the ground, unable to answer the voice that was calling his name, and begins to crawl towards his brother, who's arm was reaching out to him. He is unable to reach him as he 'falls into darkness' just before their fingers touched. The last thing he saw was his brother's open eyes that blinked slowly.

   Omen visits Jenan in prison. Omen explains to Jenan, who is puzzled as to why Omen has come to see him, that Omen wants closure for not only himself but also Jenan. Omen offers Jenan the chance to explain his reasons for attempting to murder him earlier in the year, however Jenan mocks him and gloats that his fellow prison inmates respect him for almost killing the chosen one. Omen doesn't see how that's somethign to be proud of, and tells Jenan that Temper Fray had informed him how miserable and scared Jenan really is and that he is aware that Jenan cries himself to sleep. Embarrassed and full of rage, Jenan lunges at Omen, however his attempt was foiled when he fell to the floor in pain; Omen reminds him 'no touching'. Jenan swears revenge on Omen and says he hates him. Omen leaves.

   Omen then visits his twin in hospital. He finds it hard to see Auger so weak and pale. Auger asks how Omen's prison visit went, Omen replies that it 'could have gone better'. Auger insists that Jenan has chosen his path and that Omen has given him enough chances to change his mind and should be done trying to change that. When Auger asks if Omen will return to the prison Omen hesitates and Auger groans. The twins then talk about the attack that nearly took them both out. Auger is mad at himself for not following his training, but Omen reminds him that if he had been even a second slower that he would have died. Auger is glad he saved his brother and accepts that this may have been the only way to do so. They then joke with each other about Omen's life and end up crying from laughter.

   Later in the novel we witness Omen talking with his parents, who reprimand him for living a carefree and easy life. They ask him what he wants to be in the future, as his failure would look bad on the family. Omen suggests that he had been going on adventures and might want to pursue it as a career to which his father responds 'nobody wants to hire a sidekick'. His father continues and tells Omen that Auger will continue to outshine him, like he always has, in everything he ever does. This hurts Omen, but he says nothing. He leaves and screams at them, but only in his head.

   Never and Omen are later seen in Omen's bedroom talking about what his parents said. Omen tell Never about the events that unfolded, visibly upset while he paced. Never commends Omen for finally admitting that his parents aren't always nice to him, Omen immediately tries to backtrack but Never doesn't let him. Omen suggest that he should run away and lets it slip to Never that he doesn't think that his parents love him. This silences Never, however she allows Omen to backtrack on that statement. Never then offers Omen a hug, Omen is hesitant at first but eventually gives in. Just before they hug Never teleports away. Omen is left standing there.

   During the course of the novel Omen is shown to bond with his gym teacher, Hunnan. His teacher targets Omen and insists that he won't let Omen waste his potential. The teacher states that he was ecstatic when he found out he would be teaching the Darkly brothers and tells Omen that he could do much better that he currently does. This makes Omen try during lessons, easily winning fights that he normally would have lost due to not caring.

   Omen is later stopped by Oberon in the corridors of Corrival Academy who believes that he is the chosen one. Omen explains that he is not. Oberon tells Omen about the Obsidian Blade which is the weapon that Auger will need to be able to defeat the King of the Darklands. Omen, along with Axelia and Never, set out to retrieve the blade on Auger's behalf, from a man named
   Reznor Rake
   . They are successful, but only due to the fact that Crepuscular Vies stepped in and helped Omen win the fight. Vies gives Omen his number and they part ways, taking the blade back to the school to give to Auger.

   Later on Omen is wandering through the hallways of Corrival Academy and notices Never kissing someone, quickly realising that it is in fact his brother. Omen turns and quickly walks away, however Never and Auger follow him. Auger realises that Omen is upset and asks Never to leave so that they two of them can talk. The twins discuss how the relationship came to be and Auger tells Omen that if it made Omen too uncomfortable he would break things off with Never, indicating that he always took things from Omen due to being the chosen one. Omen tells him that he doesn't have to break up with Never. Auger expresses that he was very shocked at Omen's poor reaction, implying that it might be because he himself may have feelings for Never. Omen walks away and doesn't reply.

   Omen deliberately avoids both Never and Auger, speaking very little to them and often escaping the academy to go on long walks. He again meets up with Crepuscular Vies whom he contacted to talk about his struggle to determine his feelings regarding Never. Vies tells Omen that he was Skulduggery's old partner and that the skeleton detective left him to die. He then calls Omen his partner and says that he won't let anything happen to him.
