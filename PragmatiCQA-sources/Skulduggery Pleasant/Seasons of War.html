Omen has recovered from the wound, but Auger is still healing in hospital. Jenan says he was the leader of Abyssinia's First Wave. They were going to change the world, but Omen and his friends stopped them. So obviously, he wants to kill Omen. Omen says that isn't true, since Abyssinia was just using First Wave - they were going to be framed for killing mortals. Enraged, Jenan tries to attack Omen, but fails. A guard walks in, asking if everything is alright. Omen says Jenan just wanted a hug, and proceeds to leave.

He questions Saracen about the incident where he told Ravel his ability. Saracen was dying, so revealed what his ability was to Ravel. However, immediately afterwards, he was cured. Skulduggery says that Ravel must have been poisoning Saracen since he was afraid of him reading his mind, but after Saracen revealed his ability, it wasn't a psychic ability, so Ravel let him live. Saracen is surprised and angry at Ravel. Skulduggery concludes that he must be a Lynceus (X-Ray Vision). Everyone is disappointed.
