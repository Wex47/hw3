   built in the
   MacGillycuddy's Reeks
   . It was built in 1892 to contain a
   Remnant
   outbreak that happened in County Kerry. It has the appearance of a giant glass sphere, approximately 100m in diameter, set in a large wooden support structure. Despite looking like glass though, the sphere is formed of an field of energy which is able to allow remnants in but not out. When activated, the sphere begins rotating, capable of pulling remnants from their human hosts as well as attracting remnants in their natural form with a much greater force.
