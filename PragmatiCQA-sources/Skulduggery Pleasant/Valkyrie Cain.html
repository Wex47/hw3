   Skulduggery Pleasant

Stephanie managed to escape  him, but he chased her and they fell into a river, resulting in his death (who was immune from fire but vulnerable to water). Skulduggery took her back home, but she still accompanied him the next day. They visited a friend of Skulduggery,

   To enable Stephanie to work with him further without anyone noticing that she was gone, Skulduggery gave Stephanie a
   Reflection

   After their meeting with the Elders, the pair broke into the Vault and consulted an

   At Gordon's house, they encountered Serpine and his

   other brother

   A villain called

   Crystal of the Saints
   . Skulduggery tells Scaramouch all the work and trouble ruling the world would be, but Scaramouch believes that he could still do it. Scaramouch then shows Skulduggery a container, which had been enchanted by twenty-three spells by twenty-three different sorcerers. The container has an insect which could drain the magic of sorcerers. It is one of

Skulduggery squishes it just as Valkyrie walks in. She uses air magic and the two arrest Scaramouch. Scaramouch is outraged when Valkyrie doesn't recognise him. She, on the other hand, claims that they have real bad guys to stop, but cuffs Scaramouch anyway. As they walk out, Skulduggery tells Scaramouch that there should be more people who want to take over the world and that all the other bad guys think that it's just silly.

The Torment only says he will help them find Vile's armour if Skulduggery kills Valkyrie. Since she is a descendant of the Ancients, The Torment despises her, thinking any power will corrupt civilisation. Skulduggery takes Valkyrie around a corner and they summon

Soon after, Skulduggery and Valkyrie take the reflection back to Valkyrie's house. Valkyrie touches the mirror to absorb its memories and remembers what it is like to be shot. Valkyrie then notices that whenever she tries to look back in her memories one part always remains blank and she cannot pin it down. She realises that her reflection hid something from her, and finds it disconcerting and dangerous. However, she goes on with Skulduggery without mentioning it to him.

   Later, Valkyrie is kidnapped by Sanguine who takes her to an old abandoned church of the Faceless Ones where she is taken before the altar where Vengeous awaits her. The evil sorcerer cuts Valkyrie's palm and spills some of her blood onto the Grotesquery's body before using the armour's shadow powers which mingle with the blood. Skulduggery subsequently arrives and rescues Valkyrie, by throwing a collapsible jack onto the Grotesquery and making it out to be a bomb. After a stealing the Grotesquery, Valkyrie is incapacitated and wakes up in

However, the Grotesquery has already absorbed a lot of power from Vile's armour and Valkyrie's blood and so wakes up in the middle of the night whilst being operated on. Skulduggery and Tanith arrive and the three of them attack the Grotesquery before escaping. Skulduggery works out that Vengeous is actually a pawn in someone else's plan and accuses Guild of being a traitor. In a rage, Guild fires Skulduggery who decides to go after Vengeous anyway. Valkyrie begrudgingly goes to her family reunion as a distraction to Dusk. Valkyrie is subsequently attacked by vampires and forced to flee. Dusk corners her and vows that when he has transformed her into a vampire he's going to set her loose on her parents while in her bloodlust. Valkyrie stabs Dusk in the leg with the syringe he uses to curb his vampiric side whilst he is transforming and as a result, he is caught between vampire and human and put in intense pain.

   and do battle with the Grotesquery which, due to being part Faceless One, is virtually invincible. Mr Bliss is incapacitated but the Cleavers mercilessly attack the Grotesquery and almost overpower it when Vengeous arrives along with China, whom he has taken captive. Together with the Grotesquery, he kills the Cleavers and beats Skulduggery and Valkyrie into submission. Valkyrie "tricks" Vengeous into releasing her, saying that she will join him and kill Skulduggery, but she releases China who attacks Vengeous and the Grotesquery. This gives Valkyrie time to free Skulduggery, who joins in the assault against Vengeous, tearing off his helmet and breastplate. Valkyrie ignites the protective clothing beneath with a fireball and Skulduggery shoots him in the stomach. In a swoon, Vengeous crawls toward the Grotesquery but his god callously breaks the baron's neck. The Torment subsequently arrives and attacks the Grotesquery but he is defeated. In the ensuing battle Valkyrie stabs the Grotesquery through the heart, killing it. Before it dies it utters a terrible scream, which calls to the Faceless Ones trapped in another universe.

Valkyrie then runs out of the Sanctuary and escapes with Skulduggery to Aranmore Farm, where the battle has already ensued.

Ghastly informs Valkyrie that her new clothes are in the van outside, so Valkyrie runs to get changed. The Diablerie force Fletcher to open the Gateway and Skulduggery, Tanith and Ghastly go out to attack. They are ambushed by two or three hundred

Valkyrie picks up Tanith's sword and slashes open Sanguine's stomach, causing him to retreat in horror.

   Then, three Faceless Ones come through the fully opened gate and Fletcher manages to escape after the shockwave caused by their arrival. One of the Faceless Ones takes over Krav’s body and then kills Mr Bliss. Paddy gets Valkyrie the Sceptre then reveals himself to be Batu as he knocks Tanith out and hits Valkyrie with the Sceptre. Valkyrie realises that the ring Batu gave her is preventing her from using magic and removes it allowing her to burn Batu’s side. Batu takes the Sceptre and hides it in the trees, being followed by Valkyrie.

China coaxes the Sceptre from Crux and then turns to see Valkyrie running towards her with a Faceless One right on her tail. Valkyrie takes the spectre and fires black lightning twice into the Faceless One that had consumed Krav, killing it. The second Faceless One attacks China, Skulduggery and Valkyrie. Fletcher appears and teleports Valkyrie out of the way. The Faceless One pulls the Sceptre out of Valkyrie's hand and shatters it, destroying the black crystal, and itself.

   Skulduggery decides to get the last Faceless One to chase Valkyrie and go through a new portal which Fletcher should open. The Faceless One charges at Skulduggery instead, lifting him off the ground. Wreath, with a broken leg, gives Valkyrie his cane full of his Necromantic power and she uses it to knock the Faceless One back as the cane is destroyed. The Faceless One shoots out tentacles made of its organs in a last attempt to save itself. The tentable whips around Skulduggery and pulls him through the portal with it. The portal closes before anyone can do anything to help. Valkyrie and her team are victorious, but also defeated by the loss of Skulduggery.

   Later Solomon Wreath approaches Valkyrie who angrily tells him that Guild has given all the credit of the victory to Mr Bliss. Wreath tells Valkyrie that she can still save Skulduggery by using his
   original skull
   as an Isthmus anchor. With new hope, she is also told she is a natural at Necromancy, seeing how skilfully she was able to wield Wreath's cane. Wreath offers to train her, as she will need more power to get through her new mission.

Skulduggery notices one symbol is incorrect, which made the curse pass from person to person instead of one person. Geoffrey's teeth start chattering. Skulduggery rings China Sorrows to see if he can correct the symbol. Geoffrey notices the shark's dorsal fin poking out of the water. Valkyrie jumps in front of him but knows that won't do anything. Skulduggery starts talking to China about the symbol. Geoffrey starts shouting, saying that the shark is coming. Skulduggery tells Geoffrey to stop shouting. Valkyrie tells him to scare it away by splashing, but China says not to splash about. Skulduggery continues talking and takes up a scalpel and tries to correct the mistake.

   The Shark comes for Geoffrey, Valkyrie grabs his arm and pulls him away at the last second. But she drops him again, under water. He looks for the shark and sees it coming for him. But at that time, the water disappears and so does the shark. Geoffrey thanks Valkyrie for saving him and says he owes her a favour now. Skulduggery wonders why he doesn't get a thank you too and Geoffrey merely said, Skulduggery told him to shut up while he was "dying" and walked away.

China asks why Valkyrie really came to her, She says that her parents expect her to go to college and study but she keeps wanting to work at the Sanctuary but also does not want to get too distant from other mortals. China says that its called Second Lifetime Syndrome and it happens when sorcerers watch her friends or family die around them. Valkyrie suggests that she could tell her parents about magic but China strongly advises her against that since Valkyrie's parents' lives will be ruined with fear and worry and will struggle with their lives and won't be able to cope about magic which ruined her Dad's life.

   Throughout the series, Valkyrie's skill in elemental magic steadily grows, from an absolute amateur incapable of performing magic when panicking to the stage of a reasonably powerful Elemental, capable of besting sorcerers far more experienced than she herself is. She displays great potency with Fire and Air but shows little aptitude with Water and even less in Earth, due to her not being interested in the former and the fact that the latter turns one into a stone statue. However, she loses this power after she is stripped of her magic.

   After seeing her use his cane with great skill despite her lack of training at Aranmore Farm, Wreath decided that Valkyrie needed Necromancy training. She displays a strange skill and talent at the discipline and grasps it very well. Valkyrie has her power forced into a ring and she uses it to create shadow whips, barriers and tendrils, as well as shrouding her hand in solid darkness to increase the power of her punches and launch projectiles of darkness. However, she loses this power after she is stripped of her magic.

   When in grave danger - such as being on the brink of death, Valkyrie subconsciously allowed Darquesse to take over her mind and body. As Darquesse, Valkyrie could wield a unique type of magic, possibly Ancient or Faceless Ones' magic, which granted her a huge amount of strength, allowing her to break boulders, crush skulls, and punch through bones with ease. It also gave her the ability to fly, the ability to see and manipulate someone's consciousness. Darquesse can also dull pain and has the ability to heal even her brain and organs, making her practically invincible. Darquesse can survive injuries that would easily kill a normal mage, even one as powerful as Skulduggery. Darquesse can even withstand having her head ripped off, though she admitted there was a strong chance she'd have died had she not magically repaired herself within seven seconds. Complete destruction of the brain would kill her - however, this is almost impossible do due to her ability to heal any and all wounds magically. Darquesse has been shown to be capable of disintegrating regular humans, turning them to ash with a mere gesture. In addition, Valkyrie's normal skills, such as

Argeddion also states that she is learning and becoming powerful faster than he did, as she easily mastered the ability to see magic, while it took him many months. It is known that Darquesse has been prophesied to extinguish all life on Earth, and eventually the planet itself. By
   2013
   Darquesse has completely taken over. She could tear another mage apart with a casual flick of her wrist, destroy a thousand powerful Witches and an army of Warlocks, other mages, Wretchlings and several supercharged sorcerers. By
   2014
   she is sufficiently powerful to destroy a large part of Roarhaven, absorb thousands of remnants, atomise living beings and even travel to the dimension of the Faceless Ones. It was also said that even weakened, Darquesse could defeat Lord Vile (even after he was supercharged by the Accelerator). At almost her full power, she survives a combined assault by Valkyrie (with invincibility), Melancholia, and supercharged Lord Vile, and manages to defeat all of them with a large blast of energy. However, it was stated that she could not defeat more than two Faceless Ones.

She is also able to see magic like Darquesse.

   Valkyrie first met Skulduggery when he rescued her from a sorcerer who attacked her in her house. At the time she was still known as Stephanie Edgely and had no knowledge of magic or even any idea that it existed. Skulduggery introduced her to the magical world and they became close friends and partners. Despite bickering regularly, they are fiercely loyal to each other. Shortly after their first meeting, Skulduggery killed Serpine in order to protect her, having originally intended to only arrest him and at one point Valkyrie even went into the world of the Faceless Ones in order to rescue him from the evil gods.

  <p key="2b0057c0-12a9-46b9-9bb9-516120a129f9">
   Skulduggery was Valkyrie's mentor and usually acted as the leader in their relationship but due to Valkyrie's tendency to disobey orders she often didn't do what he said. Skulduggery was often exasperated by this but actually liked her headstrong nature. The Skeleton Detective also acted as her protector and despite Valkyrie's steadily increasing powers it was implied that there were still many sorcerers who could kill her easily; the reason they didn't was that they were frightened of suffering from Skulduggery's legendary rage.

  <p key="e2252a5b-7076-4c1a-be5f-3d1e9470b184">
   Skulduggery accepted that Valkyrie was Darquesse very easily, due to the fact that he possessed a ferocious dark side in the form of Lord Vile. However, it took Valkyrie a bit longer to accept that Skulduggery had once been the evilest and powerful Necromancer in the history of magic. She eventually forgave him and Skulduggery also managed to snap her out of Darquesse's control, after fighting off his own dark side during their ferocious battle.

She relishes in causing and feeling pain and violence and is constantly seeking opponents who can actually challenge her. However, it has been noted that Darquesse is not inherently evil - simply cold, uncaring and above all curious in regards to her abilities and their limits. She is willing to ally herself with those who would usually be opposed to her, valuing self-preservation above all else.

She claims that the jacket was getting snug around her shoulders, though this was probably to disguise her unwillingness in committing to return to the magical world.

As of "Seasons of War" she starts wearing a stolen necromancer suit which can be activated by using a amulet in the shape of a skull.
