    Children of the Spider
   </b>
   are a secretive organisation of Spider mages lead by
   the Torment
   . Its followers utilize a magical ability that allows them to vomit and control spiders and to transform themselves into gigantic spiders. The Children of the Spider are considered intimidating and reclusive, so much so that
   Erskine Ravel
   claims not to want
   Madame Mist
   joining him on the Sanctuary's ruling council of
   Elders
   . Despite their oddities, however, the Children of the Spider are still fundamentally human, though Derek has implied that there is more to be revealed about this strange Adept discipline.
   Most of them appear normal, except for Madame Mist, who wears a dark veil to cover her startling face: under her skin, tiny black spiders seem to crawl instead of blood.

   The Children desire a world where sorcerers rule over the mortals, and this is what leads to the expanding and upgrading of Roarhaven, numerous secrete schemes and plots, the murders of Anton Shudder and Ghastly Bespoke, the release of the psychopathic teenager
   Sean Mackin
   , the destruction of the first Irish Sanctuary, and many more events besides. Although their desire is not actually obtained, they come close – until the provoked and angered

   assassin
   Tesseract
   to kill
   Davina Marr
   . This means they may also be in contact with the mysterious Man with the Golden Eyes. When Tesseract returns to collect his money for Marr's assassination, he is poisoned by one of Madame Mist's spiders, which renders him immobile. The Children of the Spider order him to be buried alive, since during his investigation of Marr's whereabouts, he injured some Roarhaven mages. Tesseract manages to escape, however, due to the special properties of his mask. He digs himself out and goes to confront the Children, but is nearly defeated in the fight, before being taken over by a remnant. After the recapture of the remnants, Tesseract tracks down the Torment and kills him in his underground apartment in Roarhaven.
