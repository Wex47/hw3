However, once used, the Accelerator becomes a time bomb, continuing to draw on magic until it overloads and explodes. The explosion would instantly deliver magic to every magical being on earth, including

During a first time period after the Accelerator's first use, it can be shut down normally. However, after this time period, a soul is needed as a sacrifice to shut it down.

Ravel allows even more sorcerers to be boosted and eventually, they manage to slow the tide. After the battle, many of these supercharged sorcerers escaped, and needed to be recaptured as the power was making them too unstable. After a few weeks, the Accelerator-boosted sorcerer's power would begin to fluctuate, much like

   , Skulduggery and Valkyrie confront the Accelerator problem. Skulduggery finds a loophole in the Engineers instructions and uses Ravel as a sacrifice. The Engineer accepts this, as Skulduggery willingly gave Ravel's soul, and the Engineers instructions never specified that the owner of the soul had to be the one willing to give it. Through Ravel's sacrifice, the Accelerator is shut down. It is not stated whether the Accelerator can be used again, or even if it was demolished.
