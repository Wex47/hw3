   back to their reality he was opposed by a resistance movement, in which Skulduggery helped. Skulduggery was one of the leaders of the resistance movement.

   During the war, Skulduggery was part of a group, ironically named the

   One by one the other leaders of the resistance fell but strangely, Skulduggery's spirit did not move on. His bones had been placed in a bag and thrown in a river, but Skulduggery was somehow able to go into the bag, reattach his bones and quite literally pull himself together (It was later revealed that this was

   Five years later, he was brought back to Skulduggery when Vile couldn't kill his own friend Ghastly Bespoke. With his help, the resistance was able to defeat Mevolent whose minions were either imprisoned or rehabilitated, Serpine included. Before this, however, Skulduggery and the Dead Men teamed up with the
   Diablerie
   to hunt down and kill Abyssinia. After Skulduggery himself cut out Abyssinia's heart, the groups parted ways and the war continued. Another of Mevolent's henchmen,

Scaramouch wakes him up and then reveals to Skulduggery that he has a plan for world domination. Skulduggery questions what Scaramouch would do after taking the world, pointing out all the problems that would come about, and then asks how Scaramouch is planning on doing this. Scaramouch reveals he has bought a box from someone which contains a bug which will sap away all the magic from every sorcerer and give them to him. Skulduggery then asks Scaramouch to release the bug to see if it's really in there. After Scaramouch does so, Skulduggery steps on the bug, killing it. Skulduggery then says that the world needs more villains who only want to take over the world rather than destroy it and arrests Scaramouch.

   bizarre appearance which he hides while in public with a disguise, is something of a dapper gentleman. He has a polite, old-fashioned way of speech and a velvety-smooth voice which enraptures Valkyrie when they first meet. As well as a powerful sorcerer, more specifically an Elemental, he is particularly enthusiastic about detecting, always searching for clues, much to Valkyrie's and Tanith's chagrin. He is also a flamboyant egotist, vocally exalting his own plans, complimenting himself, and showing off his magical abilities to Valkyrie, at one point walking on the ocean's surface after falling from a cliff.

   Skulduggery's suave demeanour hides a desire for revenge. Because he died hating Serpine and his hatred brought him back, it forms part of his existence. At Valkyrie's questioning, he describes his true nature as a "dark, twisted thing." Several characters throughout the series have commented about his legendary rage, which manifests itself in the form of

    Lord Vile

   , who is Skulduggery's evil side and shows how deadly the skeleton detective can really be since Lord Vile was arguably the most powerful necromancer who had ever lived. When Skulduggery transforms into Vile, he is capable of appalling acts including slaughtering hundreds of people, one of the most notable being the mother of one of his closest friends Ghastly Bespoke. However, Skulduggery has also shown a very strong will and has managed to fight off his darker urges and managed to help Valkyrie do the same when she transformed into Darquesse. He is also deeply remorseful for the terrible acts he committed as Lord Vile and has spent his entire life, or more accurately his afterlife due to the fact that he was dead, trying to redeem himself. Despite the darker side of his nature, witnessing the murder of his family makes him sensitive to the loss of others. Although he accepts sacrifices from individuals as part of war, he is highly reluctant to allow this to happen. He protects Valkyrie diligently throughout the novels; originally only about to arrest Serpine, he is forced to kill him when he attempts to kill Valkyrie.

   When the Faceless Ones returned to Earth, Skulduggery is sucked into the vortex along with them and trapped with them in a different universe. This ordeal seems to have had a lasting effect on his sanity, testament to this being when Valkyrie came to rescue Skulduggery he thought she was a hallucination and he mentioned he had been hallucinating a lot.

   On an interesting note, the head he was wearing was not his own; he won it in a poker game. His real head was stolen from him by goblins while he was asleep. When Skulduggery came back to Earth, a lot of characters believed him to be unhinged, but he said he was faking this side of his personality. Skulduggery particularly hates being shot at, as he finds it very rude.
