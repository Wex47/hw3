    Skulduggery Pleasant: Bedlam
   </i>
   begins with Valkyrie Cain and Skulduggery Pleasant following a lead regarding Dr Nye's location. They meet up and converse with Christopher Reign; owner of a local Roarhaven bar and distributor of a new magical item known as a Splash. Originally created by

   , the Splash is a sigil carved onto a piece of paper that gives the user a jolt of magic, just enough to feel good. As the discussion begins to get heated Christopher calls on one of his door staff, Panthea, in an attempt to have them thrown out. Valkyrie initially tries to goad Panthea into a fight but ends up flirting with her instead. Skulduggery presses Christopher for an answer only for him to insist he really doesn't know the whereabouts of Dr Nye, but insinuates that Nye came to Christopher with the splash, received payment, and left. They decide to leave the bar but not before Valkyrie knocks out a patron she describes as getting too handsy with the staff.

   They leave the bar and notice a City Guard car parked in the next street over in front of a small shop with its door kicked in. They investigate only to find three city guards, Sergeant Yonder, Officer Lush and Officer Rattan trashing the place. After a brief discussion, it's revealed that this shop belongs to mortals from the

   . It's implied that the owners had not paid the city guard protection money and as such were being targeted till they do so. The trio of guards tries to leave only for Skulduggery to stop them and declare that they are under arrest causing all three to turn hostile. After a brief scuffle Lush, Rattan and Yonder are defeated. Cuffed and helpless Yonder declares his animosity towards the duo before being presumably taken away.

She states that he doesn't have to be to hard on himself as he still has a number of years before he experiences The Surge. Omen and Miss Gnosis briefly discuss Sensitives and how twins like Auger and Omen have a strong psychic connection before Miss Gnosis lets him off early. Omen, now free to leave, manages to get to his next class just before the bell rings. Class starts and Never comes in looking exhausted. The two discuss her recent adventures with Auger and his group. Never expresses how she struggles to balance her life of adventure with her school work. She compares her lazy work ethic to Auger who is seemingly always on top of his homework even after constant adventuring. She attempts to copy off Omen only for Omen to state that he doesn't complete his homework either. Never appears to be slightly annoyed and demands to know why, only for Omen to state "I was thinking about other things". Miss Chou walks in and begins class by asking Never a question regarding her homework.

   Razzia is applying makeup in the ladies room of Coldheart Prison next to Abyssinia. Razzia appears to be lost in her thoughts as Abyssinia speaks to her, presumably unaware that Razzia is not listening. Razzia ruminates on her past back in Australia. She admits it gets quite hazy as she thinks back to her father who she seems to be unsure she even had. On one hand, she has vague memories of a "a nasty old man quick with his fists" but expresses her dislike at those memories instead substituting them for memories of a more lovable father. Razzia realises Abyssinia has still been talking this whole time, but is completely lost as to what they were just discussing. Razzia goes back to applying her makeup and thinking to herself. Knowing Abyssinia, she assumes that she has been talking about her son,

She admits though that anyone having to endure what Caisson had just endured for a near century would come out at the very least, a little odd. It's for this reason that Razzia looks up to Caisson torturer

   and perhaps learn a thing or two. Abyssinia interrupts Razzia thoughts asking for her opinion on something. Razzia defects the question by instead asking Abyssinia what she thinks. Abyssinia believes that they should move to the next stage of her plan but at the same is concerned and unsure of what to do about Auger Darkly. Razzia doesn't see what the problem is. The Darkly Prophecy is still more than 2 years away. Plenty of time in Razzias mind to find an opportunity to kill him. She explains her thoughts to Abyssinia in a paradoxical way ending with her expressing her views on the whole concept of prophecy as a complicated yet deceptively simple business. Abyssinia disagrees and Razzia concedes the argument, admitting that her opinion may be invalid due to her being crazy.

China, being her secretive conniving self, has sent spies and double agents to the 3 African sanctuaries to try and put her own people as Grand mages in order to gain control of Africa. The Black Sand is working against China's advances, yet the African sanctuary is working against the Black Sand, whether due to China's spies is not elaborated on. The African sanctuary has rounded up the innocent family and friends of some of the Black Sand's members and is sentencing them to 30 years prison each. Tanith says she's here to give herself over to China as the leader of the Black Sand as a bargaining chip to release the others. Valkyrie begs her to reconsider, or at least hold the plan off for a while until they can figure something out and Tanith agrees. Following Tanith's visit, Valkyrie has a dream/premonition of the Darkly boys in Oregon America. Both boys have been shot, Omen dies from his wounds. They are being pursued by a group of people but they remain unidentified. From this dream Valkyrie learns that she can pause her visions, but cannot change the focal point or move.

Skulduggery reassures her that her traumas may have made her who she is, they do not define her and she has the strength to live with them. They arrive at Oberon's car, getting in and talking with him about the situation. Oberon reveals that his son Robbie is being used as a bribe to get Magenta, oberons ex, to use her psychic abilities on people within the American govt.

Oberon says Robbie is being guarded by the people in the house hes watching, and that Magenta is being guarded by the Seven-as-One, and that he has not had contact with her. They enter the house, punch a couple people, and interrogate a man Sleave. Sleave reveals his crew has been laid off recently, meaning they have no clue where Robbie is. Skulduggery makes an agreement with Sleave, allowing him to walk away free as long as they give up their employers name, Crepusculer Vies. Fletcher arrives to take them back to Ireland.

   's place, Skulduggery catches Valkyrie humming one continuous note which disturbs Valkyrie slightly but she ignores it. When they arrive Valkyrie blasts herself upwards to see that the building is built to look like a sigil. The inside of the Clockwork House is grand, soaring ceilings and incredibly large rooms with walls covered in cogs. Skulduggery asks the house for the location of Greymire Asylum, and the house leads them through two rooms to a seemingly random cog in one of the walls. Valkyrie and Skulduggery give one secret each in return for the secret of Greymire Asylum; Valkyries secret is that she can see and interact with a splinter of Darquesse. While in the recording room, Kes says she's been getting weaker the longer she's apart from Darquesse. After the secrets are recorded, they're placed in the wall. The Greymire Asylum secret is put in a device in one of the rooms in the house and a lever is pulled to release the secret. Greymire Asylum is on Inis Tra Thuathail, an island thought to be deserted.

Abyssinia asks about Wilkes and Flannery lies saying he doesn't know where Wilkes went, only that he'd left his job. While Nero mouths of the President, Razzia thinks of her murderous tendencies and self control, she notices that the longer Nero uses his magic, the more unstable he gets. Abyssinia calms Nero before entering Flannerys mind to update herself on Flannerys recent movements. Flannery agrees to keep Abyssinia updated on everything. They teleport back to Coldheart and Nero apologizes for his outburst. Abyssinia accepts the appology, saying she completely understands the outburst and that she will enjoy deploying the soul sucking bomb at Flannerys next speech.

They're escorted out by Brother Bear, but Valkyrie asks to go to the bathrooms and uses this as a means to escape and explore the Asylum.  As she leaves the bathrooms she runs from Brother Bear.

   On Twitter, a few days out from Bedlam's release, Derek had Tweeted about 'still writing on a book!' While some fans theorized that Bedlam hadn't been finished yet, others theorized that Derek had already started to write a sequel. Derek later said in a tweet a few hours after the one above, that Bedlam was indeed finished, but did not elaborate if the book he was talking about was indeed a sequel to Bedlam or a new series entirely, nor did he divulge the book's title.
