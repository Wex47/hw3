   Skulduggery had his head stolen by
   Goblins
   . Around the year 1987, Skulduggery was hired to investigate a church plagued by "angry spirits." He found out that Goblins infested the church. Skulduggery set up camp, waiting for them to arrive at the church. The first night he leapt out screaming and throwing fireballs, hoping to scare them away permanently. The second night, he crept up behind them and repeated his actions. However, on the third night, the Goblins approached Skulldugery's camp instead and stole his head while he was "meditating." Skulduggery did not realize this until the morning.

The murder was picked up by mortal police, and the skull was given the nicknamed the "Murder Skull." The skull found its way to the black market and changed hands four times. A sorcerer named
