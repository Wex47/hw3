   Sanguine is a member of the group led by Tanith Low to secure and destroy the four God-Killer weapons. It is revealed at the end of the novel that he had Sabine charge a second pair of forgeries, his reason being "there wasn't a lot of point in helping someone you love bring about the end of the world, if the end of the world meant you couldn't be with the one you love." He then stated that if the original copies could fool experts for a few days, he saw no reason why these forgeries couldn't fool Tanith while they melted for a few seconds. The book ends with him realising that having the God-Killer weapons makes him near unstoppable.

   Sanguine later aid's Tanith in her attempt to take on the Black Cleaver, showing great skill while fighting with the God-Killer Dagger. Both fighters initially appear evenly matched but Sanguine slowly gains the upper hand. The Black Cleaver realising he's outmatched attempts to move towards Tanith and kill her instead. As The Black Cleaver gets within striking distance of Tanith, Sanguine leaps from a wall attempting to tackle him. Sanguine takes an elbow to the face for his efforts and ends up dropping the dagger. Tanith shouts a warning at the momentarily disorientated Sanguine and The Black Cleaver moves in for the kill, scythe swinging for neck. Sanguine, however, has one last trick up his sleeve. Ducking the killing blow he dives straight through The Black Cleavers body, ruining flesh and armour as The Black Cleavers torso is now rent asunder. Hitting the ground behind his now seemingly defeated foe Sanguine rolled to his feet, cocky and sure that he had dealt the decisive blow, finally killing The Black Cleaver. He was still grinning when The Black Cleaver's scythe opened his throat. He had forgotten that The Black Cleaver was undead and couldn't be killed via ordinary means. A mistake that ultimately proved fatal

He also has a tendency to hold vendettas against people, such as Valkyrie after she stole his beloved straight razor on two separate occasions and when she cut him with Tanith's sword, causing him to become unable to use his magic effectively.
