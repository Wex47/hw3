   A vitakinetic is a magical healer whose
   Neoteric
   advantage is being able to resurrect recently deceased people. They likely summon the same type of magic discharged by the Sunburst device, it is likely that this discipline requires significant power and no known sorcerers possess the ability in the main universe.

   Mevolent, in the alternate universe, is likely resurrected using a form of this magic: however, it is suggested in Kingdom of the Wicked that he is healed by Nye. This could also explain his resurrection inside the main universe: where either Nye would be capable of performing the task. For instance, Leibniz Universe Nye's discovery of the soul would aid him in practising a form of this magic.
