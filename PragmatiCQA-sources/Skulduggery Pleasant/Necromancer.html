   Necromancy is an Adept discipline. Necromancers store all of their power in a certain object they own.
   Lord Vile
   stored his power in his armor, which
   Baron Vengeous
   spent so long looking for as it had the powers of the greatest Necromancer to ever live. In

   , it is said that
   Solomon Wreath
   stores his in his cane, and his two companion Necromacers store theirs in a cloak and a pair of flint-lock pistols, respectively. If not stored in an object, the user is not able to focus the power, as said by Melancholia in

   , Valkyrie is given Wreath's cane when he becomes too badly wounded to fight. Whilst she successfully uses it against the Faceless One, it is broken and shatters into tiny pieces.However Wreath is not upset, as when a Necromancer loses their object of power, the power flows back into the Necromancer until they can transfer it into a new object.

   Notably, Wreath selected another cane, identical to his last one, in which to store his power.

   For offensive purposes, they control Shadows to do their damage. The shadows seem to congregate in their chosen weapon - for example, Wreath's cane is shrouded in darkness, and when it strikes it seems to inflict the darkness upon whatever it comes into contact with. Other forms of combat by shadows can be found in Wreath's male companion's pistol, which fires bullets made from shadows, the female companion who has a cloak made of shadows and Valkyrie's ring. Serpine however, instead of manipulating shadows is able to torture and kill people by pointing at people with his skinless right hand. It is also known that when dead people, for example when
   Valkyrie
   was with
   Nye
   , use Necromancy they can't fully control it.

   Another ability is shadow walking, this is a power similar to teleportation, but with a much shorter range, it is shown that the caster creates a wall of shadow and steps into it, appearing somewhere else. In

   Another ability that Necromancers can potentially have is nicknamed Death Bubble. It involves the necromancer reaching out to the person around them in a bubble like fashion, and then drawing the bubble back in, taking their lives with the bubble. Only two known people have achieved this: Vile and Melancholia.

   It also is implied that Necromancers with potentially
   Death Bringer
   power levels contain their powers in an object that is easy to use and access, as Valkyrie used a ring which easily remains on the hand, Vile had his armor, which remained on him at all times, and Melancholia St Clair had her necromancy inside her. Comparing this to Vandameer Craven who stored his magic in an amulet, Dragonclaw who held it in a dagger and Wreath who held it in his cane, Cain, Vile and Melancholia all had their magic on easy access, and would have been able to act subtly and discreetly, whereas Wreath would have to point his cane.

   In the fourth book, the Necromancer faith is slightly explored, through Skulduggery's harrassing Wreath about it, and the concept of their saviour, the Death Bringer, is explored. They believe that one day, a Necromancer will appear who is so powerful, they will be able to break the wall between life and death, by killing half the population of the earth. Very little more is said, and the idea is left as slightly nonsensical. However, it is said that only two Necromancers have ever shown enough promise to possibly be the Death Bringer - Lord Vile, who betrayed them, and Valkyrie herself. Lord Vile, it is revealed, is Skulduggery, overwhelmed by hatred, brought to life by the High Priest.
   Vandameer Craven
   does not believe that Valkyrie is the Death Bringer, but
   Melancholia St Clair
   is. In
   Death Bringer
   , Melancholia experiances the surge, and as Craven etches powerful symbols into her, her magic travels around her body in a loop, enhancing her power. She becomes the Death Bringer. However, the loop is unstable and she cannot take the power rushing around her body. They appear to live aecetic lifestyles inside the Temple, with some spending their lives inside its walls. Vandameer Craven mentions that one of the basic Necromancer tenets is "
   <i key="4f5f5302-ed66-4a62-bf99-d57cd6219da5">
    To suffer is to live"

   , the Necromancers had a slightly nicer role. Early in the book
   Skulduggery Pleasant
   takes
   Valkyrie Cain
   to meet Solomon Wreath, and he acts very kindly towards her - as she continually states, "like an equal". Skulduggery gives her a warning about him similar to the warning about
   China Sorrows
   - that he is not to be trusted. Once again, however, Valkyrie pays little attention.

   , Necromancers have an even larger role. As Valkyrie needed more power to save Skulduggery, she accepted Wreath's invitation to become a Necromancer, storing her power in a ring. Very early in the book, she shows a preference to shadow magic over
   Elemental
   magic, and chooses to use her ring instead of her magic to fight off an attack from
   Remus Crux
   . This could be, however, to minimise damage that could be done using fire and air magic.

   More Necromancers are introduced during the course of the book, and their lair, the Temple, is shown. Solomon Wreath is shown to be a lot less influential than he had been previously, and his role as an ambassador is insinuated. High Priest Tenebrae is shown to be the Necromancers' "leader", and is advised by the obnoxious conformist
   Vandameer Craven
