Goblins were extremely greedy and would protect their money and valuables at any cost, which made them ideal guardians for the valuables of the wizarding world.

   The vaults themselves varied in size and security. The largest, most well protected vaults belonged to the oldest and richest wizarding families and lay deepest beneath the surface. Those vaults closer to the surface seemed to be smaller and had fewer security precautions surrounding them — they used keys, for example, rather than requiring the touch of a goblin to gain access. The rules around who was allowed to access vaults seemed to change; sometimes wizards were asked for identification or a key to be allowed access, yet both

It seemed that any vault belonging to a criminal would remain guarded and untouched, as when all the

   , though it is possible that they had non-criminal relatives who could be in possession of the vault during their incarceration, but as Sirius Black was the last Black by name for at least some of his sentence and his vault remained without anything being confiscated, it would seem that Gringotts operated outside of wizard law, at the very least in rights of ownership towards their vaults and what was kept inside.

   Gringotts used a variety of security systems. Most lower security vaults, such as

    Harry Potter
   </a>
   's, required
   a key
   ; higher security vaults required the touch of a certified Gringotts goblin. Higher security vaults might have various enchantments upon the doors. For example, the door to
   Vault 713
   needed to be stroked by a certified Gringotts goblin, which caused it to melt away. If anyone but a Gringotts goblin touched the door, the person would be sucked into the vault, which was checked for trapped thieves about once per decade. This, and the fact that visitors must travel in the mine carts to access the vaults, strongly suggests that there were
   Anti-Apparition Charms
   around the bank.

    Dragons

   ,
   Security Trolls
   and
   Sphinxes
   to guard the highest security vaults, such as the
   vault of the Lestrange Family
   . Though affiliated with Gringotts, the dragons kept there were not actually "tamed" in the traditional way, in the sense that they were merely used to discourage intruders and unauthorised persons from approaching the vaults to which these beasts were stationed at. They were "conditioned" in an inhumane way that compelled them to retreat whenever they heard the sound produced by
   Clankers
   , which only the goblins possessed. The usage of Sphinxes were troublesome for some clients, when they wished to make a withdraw but were unable to answer the riddles that the Sphinxes gave as security questions. Another security measure was the
   Thief's Downfall
   : a charmed waterfall that the goblin carts must pass through, it cancelled all enchantments and magical concealments, and threw the carts off their tracks. Some vaults used the
   Gemino
   and
   Flagrante
   charms; when any item was touched by a thief, it multiplied rapidly and burned them, eventually crushing and scorching them to death. Objects within Gringotts couldn't be summoned. At times,
   Probity Probes
   were used on clients to detect enchantments, magical concealments and hidden magical objects.

   to be cautious. Goblins were extremely greedy and would protect their money and valuables at any cost, which made them ideal guardians for the valuables of the wizarding world. This became one of the primary reasons that Voldemort chose to hide one of his precious horcruxes in the deeper vaults of the bank, and was explosively furious when it failed his expectations. Ironically, Harry later did
   rob Gringotts

   Gringotts may be derived from the word "ingots", which means a mass of metal cast in a convenient form for shaping, remelting, or refining. Also "Gringo" is an informal slang used by Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries to describe merchants of foreign nationalities, or really anyone who is foreign and (apparently) rich, a fitting term if one considers it refers to a bank run by the Goblins.

    Gringotts appears to serve the wizarding world in the same way the US Federal Reserve stabilises the economy in the United States (as similar institutions exist in other economically stable countries). It independently maintains the balance of the British wizarding economy, disallowing individual wizards, witches or groups to manipulate national financial matters for personal gain. This would also explain part of the goblins' resistance toward wizarding domination over the operation of Gringotts during the Second Wizarding War, that such interference by the Death Eater-controlled Ministry of Magic threatened the very economic stability of the wizarding community they were charged with protecting. Evidence that this may be the case appears in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, where Bogrod is seen examining
    leprechaun gold
    in disgust. Not only is such gold worthless, to allow it to continue to circulate would generate inflation, which in uncontrolled amounts, can be dangerous. Fortunately, leprechaun gold disappears fairly quickly, minimising the problem.

    According to W.O.M.B.A.T tests, Gringotts may be the oldest building in Diagon Alley and the other shops grew up around it.

    wished to conquer Gringotts, and had goblins killed in ludicrous ways such as drowning them, dropping them off buildings, poisoning them, and cooking them in pies, earning him the epithet "Goblin-Crusher." However, as The Quibbler is a tabloid magazine, this theory is debatable and most likely untrue.

    Harry believed that a primary reason Voldemort chose the bank (specifically the Lestrange vault) to hide
    one of his horcruxes
    is because as a child, Voldemort would envy the wizarding families who possess a vault in this prestigious bank when he, an orphan whose magical maternal family has been reduced to poverty (and therefore would not have a vault for him to inherit), did not, something he would see as a sign of belonging to the wizarding world. He also believed that the bank's famous security would be sufficient to protect the container of his soul fragment, and was beyond furious when he found out the goblins failed to guard the cup.
