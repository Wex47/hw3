She thanked them for having the courage to stand up to Merula, the school bully, and offered them her help in whatever they needed, which Jacob's sibling appreciated. Once they met Snape, Jacob's sibling lost house points for their house, while Merula did not. Before Snape could dispense punishment, however, he was interrupted by the school caretaker,

   Fenrir Greyback

   Chiara Lobosca
   , a werewolf student (in human form at the time), spotted Greyback and two werewolves emerging from the

   and tried to attack them, but was easily defeated. Shortly afterwards, Greyback and his two werewolf companions encountered Jacob's sibling, who defiantly stood up to them and briefly held off one of the two werewolves with their spells. Before Greyback could better coordinate the assault on and hence overwhelm the young pupil, however, he caught the scent of

   and made a hasty retreat, who arrived just too late to capture him. The headmaster briefly examined the injured student on the ground and instructed the other one to return to their dormitory while he attended to Chiara, explaining that he would contact the Ministry of Magic and ask them to send an expert from the
   Werewolf Capture Unit
   to help to stop Grayback.

   The next full moon, Greyback and his army attacked Hogwarts again. This time, they encountered Jacob's sibling and
   Cecil Lee
   , whom the Ministry had sent on Dumbledore's behest. During the confrontation, Cecil tried to use the
   Homorphus Charm
   on Greyback's werewolf companions, but, as he was out of range, it failed. While Cecil was surrounded by the two other werewolves, Greyback transformed. He was attacked by Chiara in her werewolf form, but swiftly and brutally put her out of action by knocking her unconscious. After this, Jacob's sibling successfully held him at bay by some swift-spell-casting. Having fended off the two werewolves attacking him, who had retreated to Greyback's side, Cecil swiftly stepped forward and conjured ropes from the end of his wand to restrain the pack leader. Having captured the three werewolves, Cecil agreed not to capture Chiara due to her heroic actions.

   Puffskein

Lockhart turned out to be quite weak after all, but he insisted on another duel after the first one, which made them and their date worry about having the dance on time. They then thought of a brilliant idea and turned the gobstone they had picked up into a skunk, which sprayed Lockhart and caused him to depart. The students were then able to return to the festival, and Jacob's sibling enjoyed a dance with their date. Near the end, the two were announced to have been elected as festival ambassadors, and they took off around the pitch together on a broom, when Jacob's sibling received a kiss.

   Cursed Vaults
   could hold similar danger, and their friends were excited about it as well. They spent some time learning about the Triwizard Tournament and its cancellation in the
   Library

   Nifflers
   .
  </p>
  <p key="cc0421a1-95ca-4596-9d62-980bfc72691b">
   The first task took place in the
   History of Magic Classroom
   , was worth 100 points and was about finding as much shiny objects as possible using Nifflers. Due to its simplicity, it didn't receive much positive feedback, but Hagrid and Kettleburn promised the second task would be more challenging, and after announcing the winner, who was Jacob's sibling, they explained that the hints to the second task were hidden inside the contestants' shiny objects. Jacob's sibling met
   Jae
   and
   Andre

   Untransfigured

   Andre
   taking the lead and catching the Pixie, but not before a mass of
   Doxies
   escaped their cages and created chaos, injuring several students who were taken to the
   Hospital Wing
   imminently. Hagrid and Kettleburn were no longer confident that continuing the tournament was a good move, and they, Jacob's sibling and several others talked to

   At night, Jacob's sibling met a couple of students gathered by
   Badeea
   , who couldn't sleep due to the tournament. Andre and Merula decided to practise spells, and Jacob's sibling and the others talked about the upcoming task, but no one really felt better. A Niffler left them a coin, which was Untransfigured into a

   Forest Grove

They collected their wits and formed a plan of blasting the tree branch on top of the Manticore and knocking it unconscious, which turned out to be successful. Hagrid, Kettleburn and Dumbledore then came out of the trees behind which they were monitoring the students, and congratulated them for finishing the final task.

   once more and listened to Dumbledore, who declared there had been a winner of the final task despite it being completed by collaborative efforts, and that the winner was Jacob's sibling for recognising the solution to be working together and convincing their competition of it. Another 500 points were awarded to them, who stepped up and accepted the
   All-Wizard Cup

   class using the

   , Jacob's sibling got the idea of bringing them to Pince for approval, but Pince was concerned that they would remind one of what they didn't have on a holiday and thus make one feel more alone. Jacob's sibling tried to explain to her the students' vision of the ball, but Pince was insistent that there be no floral arrangements and
   sugary
   refreshments, and the only sounds she would like to hear that night were a lonely classical
   fortepiano
   . She also suggested Jacob's sibling take it up with the
   Headmaster
   if they had issues with her arrangements, which was exactly what they did, and they received some wise advice from Dumbledore.

   Andre
   to design a makeover for him, which he wore to a meeting with Pince, Jacob's sibling and
   Talbott
   . At the end of the meeting, she was finally convinced to organise a fairy tale Valentine's Day Ball.

   to look for Jacob's sibling, she tried Jae's fairy cakes and talked about her idea of putting up a mural in the hall. They then met with
   Badeea
   , who agreed to paint one with them, and she also let them choose the type of story they would be telling with it. They also went to the forest in the
   Magical Creatures Reserve
   with
   Barnaby
   and recruited their
   fairy friend
   and her own friends to provide light at the ball. Throughout this whole experience, every student Jacob's sibling had talked to had asked them, explicitly or implicitly, to be their date, and they had a hard time deciding who to choose. They talked to
   Tonks
   in the
   Courtyard
   where all their friends gathered, and Jacob's sibling finally decided to ask one of them to be their date, who heartily agreed. They also put on an outfit Andre designed for them.

   At the ball, Jacob's sibling and their date met Pince and Filch, who thanked Jacob's sibling for their help. They had their first dance on the dance floor following the rhythm of the music played by the enchanted instruments set up by Badeea. After the dance, Dumbledore congratulated them for their efforts leading to an excellent ball, and pointed them to Pince and Filch who were sharing a romantic moment together. He also reminded them to go the

   They visited Villanelle, and while waiting for her to finish her business, they found a book that had a strange invisible message about a "vault portrait". Villanelle later told them that though she hadn't recognised anything from Fletcher's recollection of his opponent's incantations, he had told her that the wizard had been in white robes and had a tattoo of a skeletal snake or dragon, making her suggest him go to

   Before entering Borgin and Burkes, they encountered

   on Jacob's sibling's friend, and Jacob's sibling duelled her, only to attract more witches and wizards. At this moment, Rakepick appeared and defeated them. She then told them she had tracked down Fletcher and he was waiting in the
   Three Broomsticks Inn
   .

  <p key="97ba3d47-358c-4743-8430-a22fffcb801a">
   Fletcher told them he had managed to get the Marauder's Map out of Hogwarts, but had been attacked and robbed by someone from behind. Before he would tell them more, he asked for some

    Equinox Enchanted
   </i>
   , and an intimate scene in it in which the leads would express their love towards one another, which Jacob's sibling and their friends found to be a big undertaking. They talked to Flitwick himself, who further explained the plot details of the play and gave them advices on a successful audition. They helped each other prepare for it, and Jacob's sibling also learned some movement techniques from
   Diego
   , the Choreographer and Assistant Director. During the audition, Jacob's sibling's partner,
   Barnaby
   , forgot his line, and the two of them went completely off the script, but Flitwick was very impressed with their improvisational skills. After Jacob's sibling helped
   Badeea
   with her artworks for the play, Flitwick announced that they had been chosen as a lead, along with the exact student Jacob's sibling wanted to co-star with.

   during rehearsals would bring ill fortune, and while Jacob's sibling was doubtful about it, some of their friends, including Diego, was careful not to risk it. Later, Barnaby introduced to Jacob's sibling his pet
   Knarl
   ,
   Knarl
   , who Flitwick believed to be suitable for their partner during a dance scene with a magical creature. They tried to teach him some stage directions, but didn't have much luck except for the "stay" instruction. Flitwick then decided to change the script to include a duelling scene and reviewed it with Jacob's sibling and Diego in the

   Artefact Room
   , but were still missing a
   crocodile heart
   , which they had to ask
   Jae
   to obtain, and surprisingly, Jae had a lot of collectibles from crocodiles including their hearts, so they started brewing immediately. The potion, however, looked unusually purple, and when Jacob's sibling drank some, they felt their mouth burning, which Jae thought was because of too much
   peppermint
   oil he had added. Fortunately,

   The time of dress rehearsal came, but Barnaby had lost Knarl, so it took the crew some time to find him, and when they did, Barnaby accidentally uttered the words of ill fortune and yelled after realising his mistake, sending Knarl off in a fright while making a big mess on the stage. Flitwick was shocked when all the decorations had been ruined and he cancelled the show immediately. Jacob's sibling wouldn't admit defeat and gathered their friends in the
   Three Broomsticks Inn
   , and they planned to put up the play there, but due to the confined space and limited resources, it had to be adapted to a one-wizard play. Flitwick was on board with this plan, and soon Andre finished Jacob's sibling's costume for the Spring Nymph. Later in the Inn, they took the stage and completed the performance to the resounding applause from the audience. Their original co-star met with them alone in the Great Hall after the show and shared the romantic scene with them like it should've been.

   , and he stood up on the table and said he was seeking journalists to provide photographic evidence of the existence of
   Crumple-Horned Snorkacks
   , which he have heard reports to have been spotted near Hogwarts. Barnaby and Chiara disagreed over whether it was real, but Jacob's sibling thought it would be an interesting opportunity if it did exist and they could take a picture of it, which would be placed on the front cover of the next issue. After some discussion, Chiara thought the reward money could be a big deal to her, and they agreed to try searching for it.
  </p>
  <p key="1190681b-99be-4346-a41f-0c2119cbb04e">
   Chiara taught Jacob's sibling a
   tracking spell
   and Jacob's sibling tracked down a
   niffler
   for practice. They then tried searching for a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in
   Hagrid's Garden
   , but found Barnaby with his camera, who was trying to snap a photo of a
   Moon Frog
   , which he thought Xenophilius might accept as well. The three went back to Three Broomsticks and tried to convince Xenophilius, and he agreed to take a photo of a Moon Frog if Crumple-Horned Snorkacks couldn't be found. Afterwards,
   Ismelda
   confronted them and said she was up to something big.
  </p>
  <p key="d7a8ebbd-d194-4d42-bd20-b259e520df73">
   Barnaby took Jacob's sibling to the forest in the
   Magical Creatures Reserve
   and said this had been where he had first seen the Moon Frog. After retracing his footsteps, Barnaby thought he had an idea of where the Moon Frog could be, and when he went off to find out, Jacob's sibling met with Chiara, who divulged that the "school supplies" she had been meaning to get from the reward money was actually for preventing losing control during her next
   transformation
   . When Jacob's sibling and Chiara talked to Ismelda, they were surprised to hear that Ismelda wasn't looking for a Crumple-Horned Snorkack at all, but instead was after something "definitely real".
  </p>
  <p key="c9e734fc-59f0-442d-b723-5e9ae827eb50">
   At night, Jacob's sibling followed Ismelda and
   her friends
   to Hagrid's garden and overheard them talking about capturing a
   werewolf

   on her first, knocking her out of the curse's way. Chiara got away in time and Ismelda was determined to seek another chance.
  </p>
  <p key="aed85b1d-af7b-42b0-8bdb-31daa9585ecd">
   When Jacob's sibling spoke with Chiara again in the
   Courtyard
   , Chiara thanked them for saving her from the gang's curses, and when Jacob's sibling told her about Ismelda's intent, she was worried, so they played
   Wizard's Chess
   together to help them think the situation through. They came up with the idea of making Ismelda think it was a hoax, and Jacob's sibling talked to Barnaby, who suggested asking
   Tulip
   and
   Tonks
   for help. They formed a plan involving Barnaby telling Ismelda he had seen a werewolf near Hagrid's Garden and Tonks and Tulip wearing a werewolf disguise.
  </p>
  <p key="73b972f7-68f4-4628-8a08-04e372cd956b">
   Jacob's sibling then checked on Chiara, who was searching for ingredients for the
   Wolfsbane Potion
   in the
   Potions Classroom
   . They helped her, but didn't find any. When the time of executing the plan came, Jacob's sibling went down to Hagrid's Garden and saw the completed werewolf custome made by Tulip and Tonks. Jacob's sibling greeted Ismelda when she arrived, and pretended to search with her for the creature Barnaby'd told her that he'd spotted. Jacob's sibling pointed to a
   pumpkin
   , behind which Tulip and Tonks in the werewolf custome emerged and scared the life out of Ismelda, who asked Jacob's sibling for help. Tulip and Tonks then took off the custome, and Jacob's sibling faked their surprise towards them.
  </p>
  <p key="e5035896-fa99-417d-958b-a94842e6b9eb">
   The next day, Jacob's sibling and Chiara went to the

    Great Lake
   </a>
   to meet with Barnaby and search for the Moon Frog. After a while, Barnaby came and claimed he had seen it, but had lost it again. Jacob's sibling then used the tracking spell to reveal the tracks of the Moon Frog, and the three eventually found it following the trace. Barnaby took a picture of it with his camera, and when Jacob's sibling noticed
   Glow Bugs
   flying above it, Barnaby said it looked familiar to him. Jacob's sibling realised it looked like
   Sir Ribbithe
   , which
   Liz
   was said to have been finding, and that the glow was because of him feasting on the Glow Bugs.
  </p>
  <p key="e1f2a183-4ec7-4ae0-aec7-0479ba2a958a">
   Although it wasn't a real Moon Frog, when Jacob's sibling looked at the photo, he discovered a
   Quintaped
   , a very rare creature, in the background. They went back to Three Broomsticks and negotiated with Xenophilius, who decided to put the photo on the front page because of it. The students enjoyed some
   Butterbeer
   together, and when Jacob's sibling asked Tonks whether the Quintaped had been her in disguise again, she neither confirmed nor denied it.

   . Meanwhile, Tulip recruited
   Ismelda
   and Jae, who were cooking a
   meat pie
   with
   blood sausages
   and a
   tteokbokki
   respectively. They talked when
   Andre
   was designing some chef's robes, and alighted on the idea of inviting
   Murphy
   to be the host, who agreed and named the event the "
   Great Hogwarts Cook-Off
   ".

  <p key="dd63d9a1-8fea-4d0c-8a05-b57290b1962d">
   The cook-off was held in the
   Kitchens
   , during which the four contestant prepared their dishes while Murphy commentated. At the end, Mary and Rosa provided some critical insights towards each dish, but Ismelda was angered by her dough being called "sad and soggy" and transformed her pie into a
   monster
   , which destroyed Diego's flan. Jacob's sibling was quick to cast the
   Eradication Spell
   to wipe the monster out of existence, but even then, the cook-off had become a disaster. Tulip became very upset and left the scene, and though Jacob's sibling managed to cheer her up, the situation between Ismelda and Diego was more than intense. Jacob's sibling visited the two of them respectively and helped both of them with their affairs, and when Diego insisted on duelling to resolve the conflict, Jacob's sibling volunteered to duel him on behalf of Ismelda, effectively acting as her champion. After the duel, Diego and Ismelda reconciliated, and all of them went back to salvaging the cook-off.

   They gathered all the contestants and worked on improving their recipes. After they talked about what they loved about the dishes they chose, Jacob's sibling realised they could all make a progress by sharing their ingredients. The Madams Karasu were intrigued by the idea of collaboration, and heartily agreed to it. After the dishes were completed, students gathered in the

   Goblin Rebellions
   . They then paid another visit to
   Duncan Ashe

   up, about which Merula insisted them talk more. During the conversation, Merula said her parents had taught her the Killing Curse before they'd gone to
   Azkaban
   . She also tried demonstrating
   Fiendfyre
   , but the spell went wrong and they couldn't turn it down. Fortunately, Rakepick arrived and extinguished the fire. At lunch, Merula told Jacob's sibling how she had discovered her parents had been

   Portkeys
   for Jacob's sibling, Bill, Merula and Ben (who would all be entering the Vault) and explained that the
   vault portrait
   should be a Portkey that would travel that night. They then deducted that the Vault had no entrance due to the designed way of entering, and soon Ben realised there could have no exit too. Rakepick later spoke with Jacob's sibling, telling them that they should take the lead should she die.

They searched the Vault and when Jacob's sibling wanted to try opening a door on the portrait wall, Rakepick refused to let them, so their friend went up and used the

It turned out that she was only using Jacob's sibling for the Vault (because only Legilimens could open the door) and the rest of the students for dragon bait. The portrait curse hadn't been broken, Jacob had been trapped in a portrait that was beyond the door, and Rakepick had been transported to the

   They rushed her to the

   and seeing giant tentacles (of a

   ) before jumping in to do some reconnaissance. To help Beatrice understand the nightmares, Jacob's sibling took her to see

   Whomping Willow
   and a description that said it was a message exchange centre for a large dark organisation. Knowing
   Alanza
   was a natural with creatures, they asked her about the Willow but came down to talk about Alanza's school life instead. When they were finishing up, the

   white-robed wizard

   R

   told them they got to be a normal student again, something which he couldn't get now. They met

   discovered

She decided to teach them wandless magic to bring them to the same skill level as her, and said just like each person's wand was different, wandless magic worked for every person differently too. Jacob's sibling then cast a mildly powerful Knockback Jinx when they were focusing on things that made them feel at home.

  <p key="e86926e9-eb33-482f-aa51-70514424471a">
   Jacob's sibling went to the Auror Office and discovered the other student was
   Tonks
   . They practised duelling to burn off Tonks's extra energy, before Moody came in and told them to start their tasks.
   They then went to
   an office
   to receive their first task, which was learning about Hogwarts as much as they could. After completing it by returning to Hogwarts and investigating, they went back to the Ministry to report to Moody that everything in Hogwarts was perfectly normal.

  <p key="f4aa3ac8-8294-414f-8bfe-253181c03bb8">
   The second task was about a
   rogue alchemist
   who claimed to have invented a
   panacea

   corn starch

   lard

   registering wands, Jacob's sibling and
   Tonks
   went to see
   Arthur Weasley
   who taught them things about
   Portkeys
   to them in the
   Portkey Office
   . Due to malfunctioning
   enchanted windows
   which display a hurricane, Arthur could not continue his speech and tasked them to fix them. On the way to the
   Magical Maintenance Department
   , they met
   <a href="Ben Copper.html" key="c6c98204-bc98-4d10-996e-3a7e3d9a0d76" title="Ben Copper">
    Ben
   </a>
   ,
   Barnaby
   , Charlie and
   Liz
   in front of the
   lifts
   , and Barnaby brought up his uncle
   Cecil
   who had helped the Magical Maintenance Department before. Jacob's sibling went with Barnaby to talk to him, but he demanded them to duel each other first to see if they had the potential to join the
   Werewolf Capture Unit
   . After the duel, they learnt that only the windows in the Portkey Office were acting strange, which had not been the case before in which all of the windows were broken. When passing by the
   All-Purpose Room
   , they saw the hurricane windows had spread to it as well, and everyone was not able to work.
   Reginald Cattermole
   , an employee from the Magical Maintenance Department, joined their conversation about it and said this window was the "master window" which controlled all the enchanted windows in the Ministry. After considering it for a while, Jacob's sibling and Ben thought the windows might have been cursed by a complicated spellwork.
  </p>
  <p key="aefb678f-60c1-413a-b530-a3bf6edafe55">
   Jacob's sibling now called it the "enchanted windows mystery" and reported to Moody with Tonks, suspecting it might have been a work of
   R
   , though without solid evidence. Moody encouraged them to use their curse-breaking and detective skills to find out the truth, so they talked to Munch and read his documents, during which they noticed Reg had come in twice this morning without Munch having seen him leaving in-between. Reg himself denied this immediately and three others confirmed his continuous presence. However, Jacob's sibling found
   his wand
   under a desk, one which
   Mafalda Hopkirk
   usually sat instead of him. Connecting the dots, Jacob's sibling deduced a fake Reg may have stolen the real Reg's wand to curse the enchanted windows and blame Reg.
  </p>
  <p key="6bdfbae7-e8c9-4f89-a737-1d1a177ca10b">
   They discussed this with
   <a href="Ben Copper.html" key="b675af16-0227-4d78-a9db-8b723410bd36" title="Ben Copper">

   and landed their guesses on the intruder either taking
   Polyjuice Potion
   or being a
   Metamorphmagus
   . Just then, Tonks left in a rush to supposedly see
   Wilkie Twycross
   , and Jacob's sibling and Ben discovered a bouncing locked chest. They unlocked the chest and saw another Tonks in it, then realised the Tonks they had been working with was an
   imposter
   , so they tried but failed to chase them down. The last memory that Tonks had was her stopping in the
   Auror Office
   for her quill and notepad when heading to the Magical Maintenance Department, and a man like a weasel (probably the fake Reg before becoming Tonks) coming in after her. They thought since they had been discovered while assuming both identities, they were now disguising as someone else. An Arthur Weasley approached them, and after he was confirmed to be really him, he told them a suspicious
   Amos Diggory
   had left the Portkey Office shortly before he had arrived and seen the windows, displaying the same rudeness and amnesia that Jacob's sibling themselves had seen when talking to him.
  </p>

   Amos came into the All-Purpose Room, in which he usually rested around that time, shortly after them and acted like the real Amos. When he heard there may have been an imposter, he questioned Jacob's sibling instead about his son

   Pest Advisory Board
   with one of their
   albino bloodhounds
   instead, and that this was the first time he talked to them this day. This could mean nothing besides the imposter having been disguised as Amos.

   Reg's wand
   for him to examine. Meanwhile, they reunited with
   Corey
   and were informed that Merula had been visiting the
   Whomping Willow
   increasingly. When Jacob's sibling told Corey about the
   Metamorphmagus
   , Corey suspected the
   Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley
   due to her previous transformation. Then, Merula showed up and called Jacob's sibling a "Janitor" for the maintenance work she thought they had been doing. Jacob's sibling wondered whether someone at the Ministry told her that, but Merula refused to divulge what she had been up to.

   Madam Puddifoot's
   but not remember anything except the falling. When Jacob's sibling speculated she might have been attacked by a big cat, she turned angry and refused help from a "child". Then,
   Madam Puddifoot
   came in and informed them that a Hogwarts student had been found near
   Zonko's
   with large scratches earlier that day and too couldn't have seemed to recall how exactly she had gotten there.

   fight
   with him, and after he knocked their wand out of their hand, they Stunned him wandlessly. When they came close to secure him, they noticed what looked like the
   sock

   Afterwards, Jacob's sibling talked to Moody about this assignment and the sock, which Moody confirmed was the missing Portkey and thought might have been another distraction. He proposed that Jacob's sibling focus on Merula and his assignments while he work on
   R

They then talked with Merula, during which they voiced their suspicion of her, in particular, her constant change of tone and manners. Merula responded by saying she was still trying to figure out what kind of person she wanted to be. Before the conversation could reach a natural ending,

   Madam Villanelle
   to have visited his shop during this time according to his ledger. When they visited her, she was oblivious of her visit as well, but was immediately reminded of the backfired wand when Jacob's sibling mentioned it. Both Ollivander and Villanelle had been using Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution when their memory problems occurred, which they doubted was a coincidence.

   had been a journey of growth and renewal. Despite being a lonely child who frequently watched their brother closely with immense concern and kept to themselves, Jacob's sibling had found a family at school that could relate to them and give them new purpose and meaning. Their social skills improved phenomenally during their magical education. Indeed, they tended to form the closest relationships (positive and negative) with students who brought out their own strengths: being around

    In their very first lesson, they cast the best
    Wand-Lighting Charm
    that Professor Flitwick had seen from a first-year in a long time. They were usually the first to master any new spell Professor Flitwick taught (such as the

    ) with little difficulty, and by their second year, they were capable of casting the
    Shrinking Charm
    to such an effect that they became the size of an insect and thus, virtually invisible to the naked eye. They could also just as easily reverse the effect with an
    Engorgement Charm
    without experiencing any side effects. During class, Professor Flitwick would often commend them for their 'fine technique' and even request that they assist him in demonstrating how to cast spells properly for their fellow classmates, as well as tutouring classmates in various spells. By their fourth year, they produced a

   Jacob
   was this individual's older brother. It is implied that they had a rather close and affectionate relationship with him during their early childhood, as they pretended to duel with
   Liquorice Wands
   with Jacob when they were younger and even stole
   Sickles
   from their mother's coat pockets at his behest. When Jacob came home after his

   . After Jacob went mysteriously missing following his expulsion from Hogwarts, his younger sibling was left devastated and mourned his disappearance with their mother. When assaulted by a
   Dementor

   Jacob's disappearance also had major repercussions on his sibling outside of

Despite all this, however, Jacob's sibling never felt bitter or resentful towards the negative publicity that they received, caused by their brother, and continued to feel nothing but unconditional love for Jacob. Their early years at Hogwarts was marked by agony over the mysterious whereabouts of their brother, thus leading them to resolve to find and rescue him no matter what.

   Indeed, this strong, unconditional love for their brother became their primary point of obsession with seeking the
   Cursed Vaults
   , inciting them to sometimes behave recklessly and enact dangerous schemes in their goal to save Jacob, such as igniting the cloak of a member of faculty and fighting a troll in the Hogwarts grounds. They would also defend Jacob's honour against accusations and mockery when necessary, refusing to believe the perpetuated rumour that he was insane and had joined the

They both bonded over the fact that both of them did not truly have anyone else going into Hogwarts — Jacob's sibling was regarded as insane thanks to their brother's actions, and Rowan was socially inept and mostly talked about trees. They continuously helped each other get through both everyday and life-threatening situations. When Rowan died, they were devastated, and it was hard for them to get over the loss.

Even though Dumbledore could get stern and firm with Jacob's sibling, it was for their own good and apart from punishing them to constant detentions with Pitts, he had defended them from practically all of the staff's criticism.

Though she did not waste any time soliciting the help of said student and their group of friends to make her own, sanctioned search for the vaults easier, and even assured Jacob's sibling she meant them no harm and even were investigating the identity of the

   after curfew by forging a letter with the handwriting of Silvanus Kettleburn. Severus Snape, however, the Potions Master and former schoolmate of Rakepick's, did not trust her at all, going so far as to saying she had ulterior motives for being at Hogwarts and that she was after the Cursed Vaults for her own gain, and quite possibly meant to kill both them and anyone else who stood in her way. Rakepick continued, however, to request the assistance of Jacob's sibling, teaching them the

Rakepick did redeem herself for her indiscretions, however, when she saved the life of Jacob's sibling by coming to their rescue just as their attacker was about to deliver the
