    Oh, the torment bred in the race,
    The grinding scream of death
    And the stroke that hits the vein,
    The haemorrhage none can staunch, the grief,
    The curse no man can bear.
    But there is a cure in the house,
    And not outside it, no,
    Not from others but from them,
    Their bloody strife. We sing to you,
    Dark gods beneath the earth.
    Now hear, you blissful powers underground –
    Answer the call, send help.
    Bless the children, give them triumph now.
    (Aeschylus, The Libation Bearers)
    Death is but crossing the world, as friends do the seas; they live in one another still. For they must needs be present, that love and live in that which is omnipresent. In this divine glass they see face to face; and their converse is free, as well as pure. This is the comfort of friends, that though they may be said to die, yet their friendship and society are, in the best sense, ever present, because immortal.
    (William Penn, More Fruits of Solitude)

   Harry dives into Snape's memories, learning several surprising secrets. Snape and Lily were friends as children, back when Lily was first discovering her magical powers. The two remained close friends through school, even after Lily was sorted into Gryffindor and Snape was sorted into Slytherin, until the day Snape angrily called Lily a
   mudblood
   while being teased by James and Sirius. This ended their friendship permanently, as Lily refused to accept Snape's many apologies despite his total regret and remorse leading to him joining the Death Eaters. After overhearing the
   prophecy involving Harry and Voldemort
   and reporting it to the Dark Lord, Snape was horrified when Lily was targeted and went to Dumbledore begging him to keep the Potters safe. Dumbledore agreed on the condition Snape promised his total allegiance to him, however even he couldn't protect them due to their poor judgement in making Wormtail their
   Secret Keeper
   . Afterwards, Dumbledore knew the day would come Voldemort would return and Snape promised to protect Harry no matter what in Lily's memory, which he did throughout his time at the school despite the boy reminding Snape of James and the risk to his life if Voldemort or the Death Eaters should find out. Upon Voldemort's return, Dumbledore sent Snape to return to the Death Eater's ranks to act as a double agent for him.

   Harry then finds out that, prior to his sixth year, Dumbledore had put on
   the ring
   in a foolish attempt to see his deceased family only to fall victim to a curse which, despite Snape's efforts, would kill him within a year. Dumbledore then tells Snape to do what he could to protect Draco and, knowing that Voldemort had ordered the boy to kill the headmaster, to take over the task. As well as preventing damage to Draco's soul from committing a murder, he would also be sparing Dumbledore from a painful death. Dumbledore then explains why Harry is so important; when Voldemort's body was destroyed, a piece of his soul latched onto the baby since he was closest living thing (explaining why Harry can speak
   Parseltongue
   ). In effect, Harry himself is a horcrux and must be killed by Voldemort personally to destroy that part of his soul. Snape is horrified that they have essentially been preparing Harry to die at the proper time, and when Dumbledore notes that despite everything Snape does truly care for Harry, Snape summons his Patronus which is a doe... his love for Lily being so strong, his Patronus changed to be the same as hers (as well as revealing that it was Snape who led Harry to the Sword of Gryffindor in the lake).

   . He appears to be in a
   Limbo
   state in which he can speak to Dumbledore. Here, it is explained he cannot be killed by Voldemort whilst Voldemort lives. Since Voldemort used Harry's blood to recreate his body, Lily's protection over Harry binds the two and therefore tethers Harry to life. Dumbledore then gives Harry a theory on why his wand acted of its own accord: as a result of their encounter in the

   three years previous, Harry's wand was imbued with some of the qualities of Voldemort's wand and regurgitated some of his own magic back at him. He also discovers that the part of Voldemort's soul he had had inside himself has been destroyed by the attempted murder; Harry was in fact a Horcrux. Near a bench Voldemort's soul is represented as a naked flayed child, whimpering and struggling for breath.

   Dumbledore confides in Harry that he had sought the
   Hallows
   , with Grindelwald, for less than noble reasons and that the death of his sister resulted from their association. In Dumbledore's opinion, only Harry is worthy of possessing the Hallows. With all of his secrets in the open, Harry can no longer find himself angry with Dumbledore even after all he has been through. Harry is given the choice of moving on or returning to try to stop Voldemort. Harry chooses to return to life and fight back.

   Back in the forest, Voldemort appears to have collapsed at the same time Harry did. Fearing not all went according to plan, he orders
   Narcissa Malfoy
   to check and see if Harry is dead, and after being subtly notified that her son,

   Death Eaters
   that Harry is indeed dead, so that she may enter the castle and find him. Voldemort then attempts to desecrate Harry's "corpse" by casting the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on it multiple times, but Harry feels no pain from these curses. Afterwards, Voldemort orders Hagrid to carry Harry back to Hogwarts during the Death Eaters victory march. Voldemort then challenges Hogwarts to surrender, but is faced down by Neville. Voldemort proceeds to torture Neville by

Harry also attempts to save Voldemort, whom he is calling by his given name, Tom Riddle, from himself by telling him to feel some remorse for all he had done. This shocks Voldemort more than anything Harry has ever said to him up to this point.

   In the story's epilogue, taking place nineteen years later, that is in
   2017
   , Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron all meet at King's Cross, preparing to send their children to Hogwarts, where Neville Longbottom has become the
   Herbology
   professor. The four adults have remained very close friends, and their children too are very close. Harry and Ginny are married with three children named
   James Sirius
   , their eldest,
   Albus Severus
   , starting his first year, and

   Hugo
   , who has to wait two more years like Lily. Harry incidentally sees Draco Malfoy with his wife (later disclosed as
   Astoria Greengrass
   ) and son
   Scorpius
   , and is acknowledged with a curt nod. James spots
   Ted Lupin
   kissing
   Victoire Weasley
   , interrupts them, and comes running to tell the others. He also teases Albus that he might be sorted in Slytherin. As James gets on the train,
   Albus
   confides in his father his fear of being sorted into

   . Harry tells him that he was named after two Hogwarts headmasters, one of whom was a Slytherin and probably the bravest man he ever knew. When Albus is still scared, Harry tells him that the Hat will also take into account his personal preference, as it had when Harry himself was sorted—something he has never shared with any of his kids. As he watches the train pull away, Harry absent-mindedly touches the lightning bolt scar on his forehead, noting that it had not pained him for nineteen years. The story closes with the words, "

   The series of books was originally published as a children's book by UK publishers
   Bloomsbury
   , and US publishers
   Scholastic
   . However, it rapidly became a phenomenal success both amongst children and amongst adults. The books each chronicle one year at school for the characters concerned and follows a long tradition of children serial books about life in schools. Perhaps unlike some of the traditional series of this format, each book has matured and expanded in complexity and scope compared to the last, approximately developing with the age of the principal characters. Although it is reported that the author had comprehensively plotted the entire series of books before the first was published, and that this plot remains unchanged, she has also stated that it has undergone a number of revisions as it has progressed. This may in part reflect the extraordinary success of the book and a need to direct its content more towards the adult market. The books started as relatively slim volumes of 300 pages, but have grown towards 700 pages as the series progressed.

   Rowling first announced that she had a particular title in mind in the latter part of 2006. However, she also announced that she had a final choice of three possible titles, before choosing this one. She has declined to explain the meaning of the title, or say what the other two possibilities were, on the grounds that doing so would reveal information about the book. The other titles she had in mind were
   <i key="0f5b47d0-ef2b-43e3-a0b1-8dbad54ff9d3">
    Harry Potter and the Elder Wand
   </i>
   , which became a chapter title,
   <i key="f15a31c7-eba3-45be-a50a-a2c62da5d29e">
    Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest
   </i>
   , and

    Harry Potter and the Hallows of Hogwarts
   </i>
   . There were also fan rumours of titles such as "Harry Potter and the Green Flame Torch," "The New Beginning," the "Pyramids of Furmat," "The Forest of Shadows," the "Fortress of Shadows," and others.
  </p>
  <p key="987c2a88-c246-4044-8379-68b7ff491143">
   Hallows is a word which has fallen into disuse in modern English except as part of some names. It is popular to name churches after saints, and there are a number of 'Church of all Hallows' in Britain, as well as some schools. Similarly the holiday of Hallowe'en is derived from "All Hallows' Eve." This usage of the word refers to saints, relics of saints, or the places where saints have lived or their remains have rested (making those places holy). Part of the mythology of hallows is that the spirit of the saint remains in his relics, and may come to the aid of those who seek it. Thus pilgrims venture to see holy relics or visit shrines hallowed by the saints.
  </p>
  <p key="20ec29af-8694-4842-95da-68a358a0460e">
   Rowling has chosen to use the word 'deathly' in the title, rather than deadly. These two are similar in sound, and sometimes confused in meaning, but are different. A 'deathly hallow' need not be dangerous, but rather in some way is related to death.
  </p>
  <p key="1211e138-9637-4310-9400-99687f1db326">
   The word 'hallows' has been used in a number of legends to represent important and powerful objects. The Tuatha de Danaan in Ireland possessed six hallows: Manannan's horse, Goibniu's shirt and tools, Lochlan's helmet, Alba's shears, a fishskin belt and Asal's pig bones. These were guarded by four Guardians of the Hallows: Manannan, Lugh, Cumhal and Fionn. As the legend changed, the hallows became four objects: The spear of Lugh, Stone of Fal, Sword of Nuada and Dagda's Cauldron.
  </p>
  <p key="c5b84cc2-93e9-4ac0-a849-0ae85bd757a0">
   The symbolism of four hallowed objects extends into the suits which now appear on tarot cards. These are wands, coins, cups, and swords. In particular the picture card, the Magician, shows a man waving a wand, with a sword, cup, and engraved metal disc on a table in front of him. Sources suggest that the figure depicted may represent Hermes, the same ancient god as the bust which Rowling used to announce completion of the book. Hermes is also considered a messenger in older legends.
  </p>
  <p key="83f85002-596f-4802-b25c-6afd839b9f19">
   The coronation ceremony for monarchs still contains four ritual objects, now represented as the sceptre, sword, ampulla of oil and crown. Similar objects also appear in Arthurian legends where the Fisher King is the guardian of four hallows; the sword, spear, dish and holy grail. Earlier Arthurian legends also refer to a set of thirteen treasures of Britain.
  </p>
  <p key="5f1019d2-0863-4872-b41b-63ff2f3392ba">
   The symbolism in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows does not follow any particular legend, but there are clearly four Hogwarts founders, and Voldemort indicated that he intended to make six Horcruxes.

  <p key="df8b5c9e-cd06-4d89-98aa-0d39c394511a">
   Before the book was officially published, it became apparent that many people advertising the book in non-English-speaking countries without being able to read it, were having much difficulty working out what the words "deathly hallows" mean, when translating the title. As a result, Rowling authorised the alternative title "Harry Potter and the Relics of Death" to translate.
