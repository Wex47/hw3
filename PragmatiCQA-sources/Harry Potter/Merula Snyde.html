   Afterwards, Merula reappeared as Rowan and Jacob's sibling were playing
   gobstones
   and began to taunt the two. She insinuated that Jacob's quest for the
   Cursed Vaults
   led him down a
   dark
   path that resulted in him joining Voldemort. Jacob's sibling retaliated by bringing up Merula's
   Death Eater
   heritage and how her parents are in Azkaban in response. As a result, Merula challenged Jacob's sibling to a duel, and ended with Merula using the

   After receiving training from their prefect, Jacob's sibling found Merula in the Clocktower Courtyard, bullying Ben Copper by expressing her distaste for
   Muggle-born
   and
   half-blood
   wizards in Hogwarts. Jacob's sibling intervened to defend Ben and challenged Merula to a duel, in which they won. Shocked at Jacob's sibling's mastery over the
   Disarming Charm
   , Merula refused to acknowledge her defeat or apologise for her behaviour and she proclaimed herself to be the greatest witch in Hogwarts, who was free to do what she wanted. Professors Snape and Flitwick approached her from behind during her tirade, much to her surprise and they began to question what happened here. Ultimately, Jacob's sibling was blamed for the duel and was forced to lose
   points
   from their house.

   into the fifth-floor corridor, with Jacob's sibling following after her. Together, they spied on Snape and Filch having a conversation about the
   cursed ice
   and sealing a room within the corridor to contain it from spreading. Jacob's sibling and Merula briefly discussed the nature of the cursed vaults, before going their separate ways. Jacob's sibling later met Merula in another potion's class and she asked whether or not they divulged the vault's existence to anyone. Merula then taunted Jacob's sibling and then they both focused on their lesson for brewing a
   Herbicide Potion
   . At the end of class, Jacob's sibling attempted to assist Merula by giving her tips on how to correctly brew the potion, to which Snape awarded them both with house points, much to Merula's chagrin.

   Towards the end of the year, Jacob's sibling, along with Rowan and an unidentified student, investigated the fifth-floor corridor where the cursed ice was supposedly spreading from. Initially, the trio investigated a door leading to
   a small room
   where the ice originated from, only to be ambushed by Merula casting the Knockback Jinx on Jacob sibling's and their friends. After declaring that only she can claim the power and treasures of the vault for herself, Merula
   entered
   the small room alone, while the trio followed after her. Upon entering the room, they discovered Merula partially encased in a block of ice from the waist down and she demanded Jacob's sibling to help her. After being freed from the ice and escaping the small room, Merula declared the whole expedition to be a waste of her time and left the area. Merula was not seen again by Jacob's sibling, except briefly in the
   End-of-Term Feast

   warned Jacob's sibling that Merula was eager for a rematch after being defeated by them the previous year.
   During a potions class, Jacob's sibling attempted to reason with Merula, citing that nobody cared about what happened last year. Merula points out that, whenever duelling was mentioned, their duel was often brought up and how strong Jacob's sibling was compared to her. As a result, Jacob's sibling had no choice but to accept Merula's challenge but was helped by Penny in preparation for their second duel. Jacob's sibling then met with Merula in the
   Clocktower Courtyard
   at night, emerging victorious from their duel. Merula was confounded by her second defeat, but stated that, while their duel was concluded, the rivalry between them would never be over.
  </p>
  <p key="9dccd346-806b-49f5-9ae3-2c029a7e9894">
   Merula was next seen in Potions class, asking what Jacob's sibling had been up to. Merula boasted about working with
   someone
   in order to unlock the secrets of the vault before Jacob's sibling could. Snape then interjected, warning Jacob's sibling of potentially being in dire trouble, which was discussed once the class was over. After class, Snape accused Jacob's sibling of stealing potion ingredients from his
   storeroom
   , as his stolen ingredients were found by their bed's drawer. With a sufficient fact check, Jacob's sibling pinned the blame on Merula, pointing out her previous attempts at sabotaging them, along with being capable of duping another student into planting the ingredients in their room.
  </p>
  <p key="17994fb1-9441-4c3a-ab61-3a8a555199fe">
   Snape promptly asked Merula if what Jacob's sibling said was true, but she denied it, stating that she only wished to see Jacob's sibling expelled for being a danger to Hogwarts. Snape, however, pointed out that she was an atrocious liar, due to her constantly darting her eyes in multiple directions whenever she lied. As a result, Merula was punished by being forced to maintain Snape's storeroom for the rest of the year for attempting to frame Jacob's sibling.

   Merula was last seen by Jacob's sibling in
   Flying Class
   , where she sarcastically asked how their friends are doing after a failed excursion into the
   Vault of Ice
   . Jacob's sibling angrily retorted to Merula to not pretend to care for their friends, to which she replied that she did not, but only about the Cursed Vaults themselves. Merula then claimed to know what happened to Jacob, to which his sibling desperately demanded Merula to tell them what happened to their brother. Merula replied that she would, after flying class was over.

  <p key="d4d03b7c-cfad-4551-a0e5-131dbcbcf6fc">
   After class, Jacob's sibling immediately asked what Merula knew about Jacob's whereabouts, to which Merula attempted to force them into swearing that any future information they learn about the vaults should be relayed to her. Merula then ominously stated that Jacob does not have much time left. After this exchange, Merula was not seen by Jacob's sibling for the rest of the year.

   Merula returned in the third year, this time with a
   gang of her own
   to help her seek out the remaining vaults. Merula introduced them as
   Ismelda Murk
   and
   Barnaby Lee
   to Jacob's sibling during the lesson on
   Wideye Potion
   . The former threatened Jacob's sibling to keep away from Merula this year, while the latter expected them to be taller. Exasperated, Jacob's sibling urged Merula to not start another argument with them, to which Merula agreed, since she planned on focusing her efforts on finding the next cursed vault, with the help of her new associates.

   After their lesson is over, Merula's gang discussed what sort of power the next vault might hold. Ismelda gleefully hoped that it was something that could resurrect the

Jacob's sibling responded and prompted Merula and her gang to leave, but not without Barnaby threatened the sibling with a bone-vanishing spell. After a short discussion about why Barnaby was working with Merula, the burly student left to follow after Merula.

   Merula went to the

  <p key="7ccffd82-bc54-499e-bc58-b719affea797">
   At some point, Jacob's sibling met with
   Tulip Karasu
   , who told them that she used to be Merula's only real friend during the first years at Hogwarts, due to her taking a liking to her rebellious and free-spirited personality. Together, they made an effort to search for the vaults and they eventually stumbled upon Jacob's old room, where he kept his notes and information he found on the vaults away from prying eyes. Unfortunately, as time went on, Merula and Tulip would had a falling out, due to both girls becoming greedy for power and purposely withholding information from one another. As a result, the two locked Jacob's room with a lock, which was
   immune to the unlocking charm
   , that could only be opened with a key each girl had.

   Jacob's sibling and Tulip later went to spy on Merula and her cohorts in the Clocktower Courtyard. Merula loudly proclaimed her frustration at finding clues to the next vault, while Ismelda insisted on using the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on Jacob's sibling to torture the information out of him, much to Merula's disgust. Tulip devised a plan with Jacob's sibling in order to acquire the key from Merula, which involved the use of a
   Jumbo Dungbomb
   , to scare away Merula's allies so they could confront her alone. After acquiring the Jumbo Dungbomb from
   Zonko's Joke Shop
   in Hogsmeade, the pair found Merula and her gang hanging out by the Clocktower Courtyard again, making small-talk. Ismelda claimed that she would use the

  </p>
  <p key="1bb43e97-b36d-49eb-9df5-f2ac62ef6176">
   Barnaby chimed in by mentioning how he once killed a
   bowtruckle
   by accidentally sitting on one, which confused Ismelda for having nothing to do with their conversation. Eventually, Merula proclaimed she hated them both equally. While they were distracted, Jacob's sibling strengthened the bomb with the
   Hardening Charm
   before launching it in-between Merula's gang with the
   Banishing Charm
   . Initially confused by the object, Ismelda and Barnaby quickly retreated once the Jumbo Dungbomb released its foetid payload, while Merula seemingly withstood the stench.

   Jacob's sibling and Tulip revealed themselves to Merula, who had a feeling they were behind this prank. Tulip demanded Merula surrender the key to them, which caused Merula to angrily retort at how Tulip betrayed her to work with Jacob's sibling instead. Jacob's sibling and Merula then duelled for the second key, which Merula lost causing her to forgo her key to her rival, but not without she uncharacteristically warned Jacob's sibling to watch out for Tulip potentially backstabbing them.

   Merula next confronted Jacob's sibling in the hallway where Jacob's old room resided. She questioned what they were doing in the
   library

   True to her word, Merula, along with Ismelda, intercepted Jacob's sibling and friends in the library as they are about to enter the
   Restricted Section
   to find the
   Vault of Fear

   Barnaby faced off against his former allies in a two versus one duel and managed to defeat Merula and Ismelda, while Jacob's sibling entered the restricted section to investigate the area for the entrance to the second vault. Barnaby later said that Merula attempted to tell Professor Snape of what had happened in the library, but nothing would come of it due to a lack of proof from her and Ismelda.

Naturally, Merula entered to win the competition, but, as usual, came into conflict with Jacob's sibling who was also competing in the contest, only to learn what they could about Jacob's disappearance from Rita. During a potion's class session, Rita forced the pair to, not only to compete against each other in creating the better potion, but to also divulge each other's darkest secrets. Merula eagerly admitted that Jacob went mad and nearly destroyed the school in the process, while Jacob's sibling told Rita of Merula's parents being locked away in Azkaban for being Death Eaters, much to Merula's chagrin. Merula was last seen in the Great Hall by Jacob's sibling, as Rita was about to announce the winner of her competition. Rita later said that, should Merula be the victor, the article would be about Merula's troubled upbringing due to her imprisoned parents, which was something her readers would very much enjoy reading about.

   Jacob's sibling was able to deduce that the next location of a cursed vault must be within the forbidden forest, where all sleepwalking students have been magically drawn to. Charlie Weasley and Jacob's sibling devised a plan to enter the forest via flying. However, Jacob's sibling did not have a broom of their own, due to their mother forbidding them use for their own safety. As a result, Jacob's sibling had no choice but to borrow a broom from someone else.

   , had gone missing.

   Jacob's sibling suggested that they should search around the school, while they search the Forbidden Forest, in case Beatrice may have wondered there looking for adventure. Jacob's sibling chose to take Merula with them, who offered snarky spoken commentary throughout their search for the younger Haywood in the
   Red Cap
   's Hole and the
   Acromantula
   lair. During their excursion into the lair, Jacob's sibling encountered the same Acromantula they defeated in their fourth year. It demanded to know why they had entered its abode again and remained uncooperative while being questioned by the duo, prompting Merula making a grisly threat in what they will do to it if it refused to assist them. The Acromantula attacked the two students in response, but Jacob's sibling was able to defeat and banish the spider with the

   Jacob's sibling decided to return to Hogwarts with Merula, and then met with Penny in the potions classroom, after Bill informed them that Penny was brewing a mysterious potion to help her find her sister. Unfortunately, the potion failed to perform its intended effect, which was to allow Penny to locate and read Beatrice's mind through a
   Legilimens
   -like effect. Despite her failure, Merula quickly rushed into the class to tell Penny that she found Beatrice in the
   Grand Staircase
   . Merula led them to a part of the staircase and told everyone she found Beatrice trapped in a painting while wandering the school. While everyone pondered on what to do about Beatrice's predicament, Filch abruptly appeared to inform Jacob's sibling that they are to carry out their detention in the
   kitchens
   with a
   house-elf
   named Pitts.

   After receiving advice from
   Badeea Ali

   Jae Kim
   , Jacob's sibling met with Merula at the Three Broomsticks in order to ask for her assistance in freeing Beatrice from the painting. Merula made note of Jacob sibling's unusual chipper attitude, but nonetheless wondered why they needed her help. Jacob's sibling's reposne prompted Merula to stroke her ego over some butterbeer, by admitting she was the best at everything in order for her to cooperate. Once Merula was satisfied, Jacob's sibling explained to her that rescuing Beatrice is the key to finding the next Cursed Vault, as the curses may be linked. Merula told Jacob's sibling to look for the
   Marauder's Map
   , as it may help them in seeking the location of the fourth vault, before the two went their separate ways.

Merula offered to speak to the Baron on Jacob's sibling's behalf, but the ghost revealed that Duncan Ashe is deceased, but his reclusive spirit still haunts Hogwarts. Jacob's sibling deduced that Duncan's spirit may be hiding in the
   Prefects' Bathroom
   , while Merula teased Jacob's sibling for being frightened of the Bloody Baron, much to their chagrin.

   Later on, Jacob's sibling met with Tulip and Merula in Jacob's old room to find any information about Duncan Ashe and his relationship with Jacob. Despite Tulip's and Merula's differences, they assisted Jacob's sibling in searching the room, while warning them to watch out for the other as a potential traitor. After a while, Jacob's sibling found a letter addressed to Jacob and makes mention of R and their intentions, and among other things. Eventually, Rakepick has Jacob's sibling, Merula, Bill and Jae Kim gathered in the training grounds to prepare for their excursion into
   Knockturn Alley
   , by having them train amongst each other in order to be ready for anything they may encounter.

   Merula was one of the students called by Rakepick to enter the portrait vault. However, Rakepick double-crossed the group and blasted them, revealing that she only needed Jacob's sibling's
   Legilimency
   to open the door and the rest were merely "dragon bait", and proceeded to torture Merula with the
   Cruciatus Curse
   . Outraged, the rest of the group attacked Rakepick and overwhelmed her with Snape's
   Garrotting Gas
   and a barrage of spells, forcing her to flee. After being transported to the Great Hall with the others using the Portkey in the vault, Merula collapsed and was helped up by Penny or Charlie (depending on who was chosen before going to the vault) and transferred to the Hospital Wing, although she was not happy to be kept there. During her stay, Jacob's sibling visited her and they had an emotionally conflicted conversation about the nature of their relationship.

   Merula had short and messy dark brown hair, with one area an orange colour; she smoothed down her hair in rare occasions, including the
   Celestial Ball
   , and once changed her orange patch to pink for Valentine's Day. She had violet eyes and thick furrowed eyebrows. Merula also smelled like cloves, nail polish, and some other elusive scent.
   Her stockings have a hole around her left kneecap and she wore Slytherin robes as well as black combat boots. In their third year, Jacob's sibling privately described her as "strangely cute".

   A strong-willed yet mean-spirited and cruel girl, Merula Snyde was a talented young

   's traits, such as cunning, determination and ambition, though also the negative stereotypes of Slytherin, such as prizing

    pure-blood supremacy
   </a>
   , as well as extreme arrogance. Merula was also highly rebellious, sadistic, and petty, and was prone to bullying those around her, especially wizards from
   Muggle
   or
   half-blood
   families. Her greatest trait, however, was her ambition to prove she is the best, which was her primary motivation for seeking out the
   Cursed Vaults
   and the major reason for being in constant conflict with
   Jacob's sibling
   . Merula's parents being imprisoned in
   Azkaban
   , an experience that very much hardened her feelings, may have contributed to this need for attention. Another curious quirk to her personality was her irreverence towards the
   <a href="Tom Riddle.html" key="ad18e7a1-6884-46c7-8804-8272eab02f28" title="Tom Riddle">
    Dark Lord

   , as she often referred to him as Voldemort, much to everyone's chagrin.
  </p>
  <p key="6c2121c2-14b9-4409-9b4e-73b97100551e">
   Merula's hatred for Jacob's sibling pushed her to go to great lengths to sabotage her rival, by either attempting to get them expelled or badly injured. Indeed, Merula often went out of her way to seek out Jacob's sibling in classes, either to taunt them about Jacob or to generally be a nuisance. Merula was always eager for a fight with Jacob's sibling and never backed down from a challenge.
  </p>
  <p key="61db01a1-29cb-4e50-a9a8-e304dd16213c">
   Unlike a lot of bullies, Merula was used to getting her hands dirty and usually did moderate-to-major tasks herself, instead of leaving it to her cronies. In her
   <a href="Fourth year.html" key="b33efc78-d63f-4cbe-84b9-a29ae2975144" title="Fourth year">

   , Merula even expressed a fondness for getting potion ingredients stuck under her fingernails.
  </p>
  <p key="b3da1f0f-5339-4021-a1fd-b28dfbbd14da">
   Despite her aggressive nature, Merula did demonstrate a strong work ethic and could often be seen studying alone in the
   library
   and was noted to be a competent student by many of her peers, especially in

   . She didn't share her friend
   Ismelda Murk
   's obsession in the
   Unforgivable Curses
   and told her to shut up about it. Merula was also not so cruel as to be willing to completely ruin someone else's life.
  </p>
  <p key="8f4056f1-e6e0-4544-9a96-aa8c9cf729fd">
   As the years went by, Merula was also described by her classmates as "not all bad", hinting at a softer side, which she demonstrated from showing concern at
   Beatrice Haywood
   's predicament, while working tirelessly on finding a way to free her. Over time her relationship with Jacob's sibling also mellowed, her once cruel taunts becoming more like friendly jabs. By her sixth year, she was more or less on good terms with Jacob's sibling and their friends and formed close cooperation with them.
  </p>
  <p key="610ea332-f757-43dc-875d-27a3549910ee">
   As they became closer, Jacob's sibling came to realise that at least part of Merula's aggressive nature was a front to avoid being seen as vulnerable. Due to her life experiences she was insecure about herself and feared being vulnerable or alone. Their friendship allowed Merula to let go of those fears to an extent.

  <p key="320f16cd-e60a-4797-9fa0-4d01d6bf7c49">
   Merula had a liking for

     Duelling

    : Merula was known to be a fierce and resourceful duellist. Even during her first year, she showed her impressive

   Merula met
   Ismelda Murk
   in their first year, presumably drawn together due to their similar ideology and inclination towards cruelty and bullying.
   They often considered each other their only friend. However, their combative natures sometimes lead to conflicts, Merula occasionally seeing Ismelda as more of a henchwoman than a friend, and at times found Ismelda too psychotic even for her liking. In turn, if
   Jacob's sibling
   asked Ismelda to be their date at the
   Celestial Ball
   , Ismelda relished at the opportunity of having fun to spite Merula.
   Ismelda also realised Merula would only mock her romantic affections for
   Barnaby Lee
   ,
   and was known to recruit
   goons
   to strike out on her own.
   Nevertheless, they worked closely together in their sixth and seventh year.

   Merula Snyde became the arch-rival of
   Jacob's sibling
   almost immediately upon arriving at Hogwarts. Merula came from a supremacist family and desired to surpass all others, thus she considered herself superior to virtually everyone. She bullied Jacob's sibling for allegedly being cursed, though they did not truly hate Merula and merely wished she would leave them alone. They first met when Merula tried to force Rowan Khanna into claiming she was the most powerful witch in the wizarding world, and she baffled them by already knowing who they were. Jacob's sibling learned she was born of two Death Eaters, and while it made them realise why she was a bully, it did not soften their mutual enmity at all.
  </p>
  <p key="5753bd28-f923-4fd0-a54b-a213ef970489">
   They were forced to resort to violence when Merula antagonised them and again when she antagonised Ben Copper. During their first round, Merula bested them with a Trip Jinx, but they bested her the second time via the Disarming Charm. They were forced to challenge her a third time in their second year, and while Merula agreed to no more duelling, she refused to stay off his tail. They were also enemies because they both sought to find the Cursed Vaults, albeit for different reasons. When Jacob's sibling arrived with Rowan Khanna and another friend, she used the Trip Jinx against all three of them, confusing Jacob's sibling who did not understand why she wanted to solve the mystery as much as he did. She believed they were going to meet a sticky end someday.
  </p>
  <p key="6312cb4e-3937-4a7a-9634-f4aadaced855">
   However, over time their relationship warmed with their shared experiences and the general mellowing of Merula's personality. By their fifth year, their relationship was notably friendly with hints of a possible romantic attachment.

Most notably, in the Hair-Raising potion class, Rowan is seen to say "is it just me, or is Merula being friendlier lately?"

      Merula also became more tactful towards Jacob's sibling in year 4 when searching through Jacob's old room, when she realised that there is still a chance for Jacob to be alive. She also didn't take offence if/when Jacob's sibling picked her to travel to Forbidden Forest to talk to
      Centaurs
      again, due to her fearless and scary attitude. The change in attitude was later due to Tonks and Jacob's sibling saving her from a Dementor, or insisting her to try and cast a Corporeal Patronus Charm, which she failed.

      , she lost her parents as a result of the
      First Wizarding War
      and has had to live with an aunt with whom she is not close. Both also have a loved one in
      Azkaban
      as a result of the First Wizarding War, and are something of an outcast at Hogwarts. But where Harry is able to make friends and is mostly benevolent, Merula is largely friendless and is albeit initially, a mean-spirited bully.

      , she's had to work hard for everything due to lacking any connections or advantages upon arriving at Hogwarts. Both have a strong work ethic and a desire to become successful witches. But where one is a
      Muggle-Born
      whose parents are loving and supportive, the other is a Pure-Blood supremacist whose parents are convicted Death Eaters.

      , she suffers from feelings of insecurity and inadequacy born from being in the shadow of another student (in Ron's case his brothers and in Merula's case
      Jacob's sibling
      ). But where Ron is the best friend of his story's protagonist, Merula is the arch-rival of her's (though she can eventually become more friendly to Jacob's sibling).

    ; like James, Merula was talented but arrogant and something of a bully. But also like James, was loyal to her few friends and over time became more mature and friendly. Should Jacob's sibling choose to romance her, the comparison is strengthened (as both would be pairing off with a fellow student who they initially did not get along with).
