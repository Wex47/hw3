Cedric later asked Harry how he managed to cheat, and Harry again told him that he never cheated. Though Harry felt Cedric did not believe him, he remained kind and appeared to be okay with what Harry was telling him.

   On 24 June, Cedric was joined by his parents, who had been invited to watch the Third Task.

  <p key="fff1098f-a242-4199-be82-4f1249387442">
   Cedric spotted the cup, and sprinted towards it as fast as he could. From his left, an
   Acromantula
   burst onto the path and attacked him. His wand was knocked out of his hand, but the timely arrival of Harry distracted it enough for Cedric to recover his own wand. Although the giant spider was too powerful to be brought down by a single spell, Harry and Cedric both stunned it at the same time. Recovering, the two of them found themselves next to the Triwizard Cup.

   Having been saved by Harry twice in the maze, Cedric urged him to take the Cup. The two argued about who should take it and win the Tournament, each pointing out that they had been helped by the other. Eventually, Harry suggested that they both take it for a Hogwarts victory. Pleased, Cedric helped the injured Harry towards the Cup, and they both took hold of it. Their touch activated the Cup, which had been turned into a
   Portkey

During the D.A's meetings, Cedric was a key point of interest, with students wanting accounts of how he died, and his former girlfriend, Cho, seeking comfort from Harry, by asking whether Cedric would have survived if he had known what they were being taught. Harry, in turn, assured her that Cedric had known what he (Harry) was teaching the other students, but Cedric was simply unable to match Voldemort's experience and evil, and that Harry himself had made it back through good luck, rather than greater talent.
   Later on that year, only when incontrovertible proof of the Dark Lord's return was presented, did Fudge believe Voldemort had indeed returned and that Cedric was actually murdered.

   Cedric was said to be an embodiment of the qualities of

   . He had a sense of fair play: during the 1993 Gryffindor/Hufflepuff match, despite his capture of the
   <a href="Golden Snitch.html" key="47156985-cf6d-49b3-9621-4c85e3e7c382" title="Golden Snitch">

   (which ensured his team's victory), Cedric immediately offered to replay the match once he found out that his opponent, Harry Potter, had fallen from his broom due to the influence of the
   <a href="Dementor.html" key="54dc5cd6-3fc7-47ce-b63e-10cc6c60a256" title="Dementor">

   .
  </p>
  <p key="6fdab311-caec-4fca-bc64-8be35c809d8d">
   Later on, he provided Harry with information as to how to decipher the
   golden egg
   clue for the Second Task. After Harry saved him in the maze, Cedric realised that Harry was the one who truly deserved to take the
   Triwizard Cup
   , and had no qualms with openly acknowledging it, which actually resulted in an argument of sorts between them. This sense of fair play and his ability to accept there were those who were better than him is a definite testament to his nobility and his grace.
  </p>
  <p key="ca84d08c-8844-4e32-a886-2893d9eac007">
   He also appeared to possess a strength of character that was not unlike Harry's. This came into play when Fleur's turning the force of her
   <a href="Veela.html" key="0ab1e5c7-9161-46f9-9a58-7e3431d5b5e6" title="Veela">
    Veela
   </a>
   charm on him while asking him to be her date for the Yule Ball. He refused, for he already had a date. Hence, it could be said that Cedric was a man of his word with remarkable inner strength, especially given how he was able to successfully resist the allure of Veela charm (which could be overwhelming) and keep his previously made promise.
  </p>
  <p key="cb4d9c8b-467b-4b68-84d8-04307daed55a">
   Besides all this, Cedric was genuinely modest, telling
   his father
   that his victory in the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff Quidditch match had not been a truly fair one. All the female Gryffindor Chasers described him as being
   <i key="f6a69b2f-2d16-4cfb-89b7-8c176d40b952">
    "strong and silent"
   </i>
   , suggesting that he was sensible enough to speak only when it was absolutely necessary. He was also courteously polite to foreigners: though he supported Ireland during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final, he was still civil to Viktor Krum (who was from Bulgaria). The fact that his spirit's last request to Harry had only been to take his body back to his parents also proved that he loved his parents dearly.
  </p>
  <p key="d3a364ac-1171-4aac-bce9-9d831329b748">
   While this side of him was never seen in the original timeline, he appeared to have a sense of honour and importance for his title at the school. This was proven by the fact that in one of the alternate timelines, in which he was humiliated during the Triwizard Tournament, this feeling of embarrassment eventually led him to join the Death Eaters. This means that if his pride or status had ever been shot down enough, this feeling of anger would have turned him over to the Death Eaters.
