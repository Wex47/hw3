   was a female

   . That meant that despite her being a giant
   snake
   , other
   Parselmouths
   (such as Harry Potter) had no control over her, though they still could understand her.
   Aragog
   (a rare
   Acromantula
   ) was accused of being the monster of the chamber by Tom Riddle which sent Hagrid to
   Azkaban
   ;
   his name was later cleared and he was allowed back in Hogwarts.

    Heir of Slytherin

   diary

   Harry and Ron (accompanied by a reluctant
   Gilderoy Lockhart

   After he was separated from Ron and the self-

   After the conversation between Harry and Riddle, the latter sent the Basilisk onto him. During the escape from Slytherin's serpent, Dumbledore's

   Statue of Slytherin
   , where he slashed at the evil beast fiercely. The Basilisk lunged at him, and knocked Harry over, but just as she lunged again to kill him, Harry grabbed the
   sword
   and impaled the Basilisk through the roof of her mouth, mortally wounding her. Unfortunately, one of her fangs pierced Harry in his sword arm as a result of the struggle, and splintered off as the Basilisk pulled away and flailed around in agony before she ultimately lost her ability to live and her massive weight finally brought her crashing down to the floor. Harry yanked the fang out, but knew it was too late: he had been wounded with her
   venom
   , and he felt the
   poison
   spreading. Harry was only saved by Fawkes'
   tears

   Salazar Slytherin's Locket

   The Basilisk was an extremely powerful and dangerous
   beast
   . A horrifying monster with dark green scales, that creature was a violent and bloodthirsty beast of titanic size, and had deep yellow eyes. She possessed incredible strength and durability (she survived smashing her head against thick stone) and was resistant to a majority of
   spells
   .

   ) only resulted in Petrification, similar to the
   Gorgon
   's stare.
   In addition, her fangs were so
   venomous
   that she could kill any living creatures that she pierced within minutes, and were capable of destroying Horcruxes; the venom's potency remained even after five years of her death. Even when blinded (which took away her deadly gaze) she could still sense her prey through smell and sound, and proved to be extremely dangerous, if not more so, despite her disadvantage.
  </p>
  <p key="ae617c81-c6fe-4412-aae8-c649c9f5601a">
   The Basilisk could breathe while submerged
   underwater
   , squeeze through the piping network of the school to go about undetected, and, by entering a state of hibernation, ceased to age as long as she remained asleep.

  <p key="b3a55a5d-22da-40d4-b661-222aa43293c4">
   The Basilisk only listened to the Heir of Slytherin, Tom Riddle (Voldemort) regardless of Harry being able to understand and speak Parseltongue to her in the Chamber of Secrets. It was possible that the Basilisk was trained,
   enchanted
   or persuaded to obey only the Heir of Slytherin and not all Parselmouths.
  </p>
  <p key="7c1ce125-5238-4065-9b23-054a8db4811b">
   The Basilisk's personality was not particularly complicated. Reflecting the personality of her master, she was extremely bloodthirsty and sadistic, based on what she said when Harry listened to her attacking her victims. She was blindly and unshakably devoted to the Heir of Slytherin, for aforementioned reasons. She had nerves of steel, and ferociously continued her goals no matter how many obstacles she encountered - including being blinded by a phoenix, at which point she resorted to using smell rather than sight.

Warren was crying in one of the bathroom's cealings when Riddle summoned the Basilisk, and when she showed up in order to tell him to go away, as they were in the girls' bathroom, the Basilisk stared at her and killed her. She eventually came back as a ghost and ended up haunting the bathroom where she died.

    , Harry did not get pierced by the Basilisk's Fang and instead pulled it out of the dead Basilisk's mouth. Also, the Basilisk noticed Harry when Ginny screamed at one of his disembodied eyes. A third difference was that the Basilisk had a scarlet plume on its head, and thus its gender was male. Additionally, Ginny helped Harry during the battle as opposed to unconscious the whole time.

While maintaining snake textures, one of the sculpting crew, Chris Fitzgerald, made the Basilisk’s skin endowed with osteoderms and other hard scales, while also giving eyes with functional eyelids and earholes, which real snakes do not have as their eyesight is poor and are deaf.

    , when Ron and Hermione entered the Chamber of Secrets, the skeleton of the Basilisk was still there, but appeared to be in a different spot than where Harry had killed her five years ago. However, it's common for decaying bodies to experience changes as they decompose, such as their bones parting or closing together because of the forces breaking down the body. A contributing factor may have been the rats in the Chamber of Secrets, which may have fed on the defeated serpent some time after her death. Also, in the film, the fang was used to destroy an additional Horcrux,
    Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem

    There is a discrepancy in the description of the size of the Basilisk between the novel and film versions, with the snake being implicitly described as being much larger in the latter. At the end of chapter 16 of the novel, when Harry, Ron and Lockhart find the snakeskin in the novel, the narration states that
    <i key="06c34342-d562-4e04-bf47-9ba81e3845fa">
     “the creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.”

    In the corresponding scene in the film, Ron states
    <i key="d89e0463-9cd8-4d51-a858-cdba1e2c8c97">
     “whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more”

      The change of Serpent of Slytherin's size in the film is most likely to make Harry's fight with the basilisk seem more exciting and dangerous, as a twenty foot long snake would be closer in size to the python Harry releases at the zoo in the first film.

    Various medias have shown both the male and female depictions of the species for Slytherin's Basilisk. In the books, it seemed to be female: when Harry first saw it, he described it as "vivid, poisonous green" but made no mention of a red crown, which implied that either it had one and he simply didn't see it, or that the Basilisk was female. That was further supported by
    <i key="5d7dfe54-14bf-4095-9938-80d8fdf4ccaa">
     Pottermore

    , which depicted the snake with a distinct lack of a crown, red or otherwise. Though the voice Harry "hears" in the film sounds male, the basilisk in the film likewise seems to lack a distinctive crown on its head.

    , the Basilisk tended to be depicted in colours. In the
    PC version
    (as well as the Game Boy Color one), she was not green, but purple, and attacked by spraying a purple stream of venom which Harry dodged. After failing to kill Harry from the mouth of Slytherin's Statue, the Basilisk popped up from the grating in the floor to try and bite or spray Harry. When she was killed, the Basilisk simply fell on Riddle's Diary, and presumably buried her fangs into the book and destroyed it. In the GBC version, however, Harry instead used the Sword of Gryffindor itself to destroy the diary.

      Also, in the console versions, the Basilisk was grey. To defeat her, Harry must fire a beam of light at the Basilisk's mouth/head when her weak-point was exposed in order to zap her (in the PS2 version, it was a black diamond-shape on her neck, while in the
      Xbox and Gamecube versions
      , it was her throat). Damaging it properly just once caused Harry to drop the Sword as it flung away to certain parts of the arena, and Harry rushed back up to it, picked it up again, and rinsed and repeated.
