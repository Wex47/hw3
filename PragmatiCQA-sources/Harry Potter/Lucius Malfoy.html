   Descending from a long line of cold, brutal fathers that produced cold, brutal sons,

   in the years that he had resided there, and despite the
   strong-arm tactics
   that the
   Auror Office
   had been
   authorised
   to employ in the effort to suppress it, it was nevertheless the case that the Dark Lord's campaign of violence had just grown ever fiercer. Throughout the entirety of his magical education, Lord Voldemort and his followers had only been gaining in strength, until finally the ongoing conflict culminated in the
   First Wizarding War
   . In the motley collection that made up Lord Voldemort's innermost circle of followers, Lucius most certainly fell into the category of 'the ambitious seeking some shared glory': By the time Lucius left Hogwarts, rumours had also began to circulate that the Lord Voldemort, who had indulged in all manner of
   Dark Magic
   in an attempt to make himself invincible, had somehow made himself
   immortal
   ,
   thus further cementing the idea that he was unstoppable. And, being no less enthralled by their quest for the purification of the wizarding race than before, not to mention very much in favour of the idea to rid the world of
   Muggle-borns

   Although never made privy to the names of every one of his new comrades,
   they were all still able to tell each other apart when it mattered by the masks they wore to conceal their identities; which were all unique to the individual using them.
   Not only was he ideally positioned supply his brothers-in-arms with important information directly from the Ministry itself, but nor did he, as an advocate for violence and unafraid to use it himself, shy away from lending an extra wand in actually waging the war either. More than willing to turn his talents to

   and other atrocities in order to carry out his Master's bidding if called upon to do so, Lucius quickly proved himself a most valuable servant to the Dark Lord. By the height of the war, Lucius had risen ambitiously through the ranks of the Dark Lord's followers and even placed in charge of his fellow Death Eaters, becoming second-in-command to their Master himself; a time Lucius would later go on to call their family's "glory days.'
   An efficient leader and a master at delegation, many successful battles were fought under Lucius' direction, and even though the
   Aurors
   had put up a valiant fight, by the time the Dark Lord's ascendancy was almost complete, true resistance to their cause had become concentrated in an underground organisation called the

   Malfoy family
   in a
   duel
   with the
   Aurors
   , however; prior to his capture, he had already went on a careful campaign of bribery, blackmail, and flattery to win his freedom, meaning that that by the time he was brought in front of the
   Council of Magical Law
   to answer charges relating to his activities as a Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy had so many high-placed Ministry officials in his pocket that the official story, namely that he had been acting under the influence of the
   Imperius Curse
   ,
   was a little more than a formality. Thus, even though many like
   Arthur Weasley
   , the Head of the
   Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office
   , never believed his version of the events, Lucius nevertheless became one of the first to "come back" to the right side and released from custody.

   Lucius lived a rather good life with his family. Independently wealthy and therefore without any need to work, he was more than content with a settled life, preoccupying himself with upholding his influence in the
   Ministry of Magic

   Lucius eventually went on to raise his son in an atmosphere of regret that the

   Igor Karkaroff
   , who had won his freedom after capture by cowardly putting a numerous amount of Lucius's old comrades into Azkaban in his place. The most prominent evidence for his initial disinterest in revisiting his past and lack of faithfulness to the Dark Lord himself was how Lucius disregarded rumours of Lord Voldemort's survival as wishful thinking, and instead took interest in potentially allying himself with the very person who had brought about their former Master's downfall. Many different theories regarding how

   , to be influenced into sullying his pure-blood by reading a story that promoted marriage between wizards and Muggles. Dumbledore's refusal to allow the book to be removed was backed by a majority of the other Governors, and Dumbledore wrote back to Malfoy saying that pure-blood families maintained their so-called purity by disowning, banishing, or lying about

   Dumbledore considered it illogical and immoral to remove works dealing with the mixture of wizard blood and Muggle blood for the knowledge of the students.

   During the
   1985–1986 school year

   . Lucius entrusted
   Jacob's sibling
   and
   Merula Snyde
   to babysit Draco, having specifically requested those two students as Jacob's sibling was said to be the best student in their year and Merula was the scion of two of Lucius' Death Eater comrades and thus considered the "appropriate" kind of person for Draco to socialise with. The decision did not rub off well with any of the three, as the two older students were irritated and disgusted by the younger Malfoy's snobbishness and prejudiced remarks.
   During the inspection,
   Lucius' wand
   went missing.
   He refused to leave without it and initially blamed the theft on their

   , as the perpetrator knew Lucius kept his wand inside his
   walking stick
   , which wasn't common knowledge. Jacob's sibling investigated and discovered that Draco had taken his father's wand, as he was too young to have his own and wanted to perform magic after seeing Merula perform the
   Jelly-Legs Curse
   on Jacob's sibling. They successfully convinced Draco to tell them where the wand was, and returned it to Lucius.

   Death Eaters
   — that Harry was another, and better, Voldemort — were completely unfounded,
   he nevertheless discouraged Draco from seeming "less than thrilled" about the Potter boy, since open hostility towards him could prove potentially disadvantageous to their social standing, as Draco spent a lot of his time away from Hogwarts talking badly of Harry and him being placed on the Quidditch Team as a first year.

   Over the summer,
   Arthur Weasley
   began conducting raids on several wizarding households to confiscate Dark or illegally enchanted objects under his recently proposed
   Muggle Protection Act
   .
   Before his home could be raided, Lucius sold several of his more incriminating possessions at
   Borgin and Burkes
   and set in motion the old task that Voldemort assigned him which involved reopening the
   Chamber of Secrets
   . Although his master fell before the plan came to fruition, Lucius still had

Therefore, he could still make excellent use of it by not only purging Hogwarts of Muggle-borns but also by sabotaging Weasley's reputation, eliminating an incriminating Dark artefact all at once and hopefully even exploiting the forthcoming chaos to have Dumbledore removed from his position at the school.

   Harry proved Ginny's innocence and pointed an accusing finger at the true culprit — Lucius. Lucius challenged the boy to prove his claims, but Dumbledore who had returned to Hogwarts at the request of the governors, stated that would be impossible with the diary beyond repair. However, he warned Lucius not to sell any more of Voldemort's school things, as Arthur Weasley would likely trace them back to him. Subsequently (and adding insult to injury) Harry in gratitude to Dobby managed to trick Lucius into setting Dobby free. He accomplished this by wrapping the diary in his own sock before handing it back to Lucius. Dobby then caught the sock after Lucius carelessly tossed it aside; therefore, he was no longer forced into the servitude of the Malfoy family.

   In a fit of rage upon both losing his servant and being tricked by a much younger adversary, Lucius lost his normally controlled and calculating demeanour and tried to attack Harry. However, he was stopped by Dobby, who blasted him down a flight of steps. Lucius had no choice at that moment but to leave. While his role in the opening of the Chamber of Secrets could not be successfully proven, Lucius was ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor for threats against his eleven other colleagues.
   Despite his sacking, he still maintained strong ties with the

None of them served time in
   Azkaban
   due to the evidence he provided against fellow
   Death Eaters
   and his help to ensure the capture of many of Voldemort's followers who had fled into hiding.
   However, the revelation of their previous loyalty to Voldemort had invariably destroyed Lucius' prized and precious reputation and few people would forget the Malfoy family's previous loyalties. Lucius would eventually gain a grandson,
   Scorpius Malfoy
   , after Draco married
   Astoria Greengrass
   .
   Because of Astoria's change of view regarding blood purity after the war, Lucius and Narcissa found her to be a somewhat disappointing daughter-in-law despite her pure-blood heritage.
   According to Draco, Lucius was frequently telling Astoria that he wanted grandchildren to continue on the family line, despite Draco telling her otherwise.
  </p>
  <p key="e1088d38-5014-4f13-9dc6-79bc4f400115">
   Lucius still enjoyed collecting Dark artefacts, particularly ones that no one else had.
   Theodore Nott
   worked for him and they created a prototype for a new
   Time-Turner
   , having decided the ones created by the Ministry were unsuitable and, having been destroyed, unavailable. The prototype was hindered by the five minute rule, but they then found a way to create another Time-Turner which would enable Lucius to travel back in time years, as he had hoped. However, he never used it which led Draco to believe that he actually preferred a world without Voldemort. The Time-Turner he created was kept by Draco, and used to save Scorpius and his
   friend
   who were trapped in the past.

   Lucius had a pale, pointed face, with pale blond hair and cold grey eyes. He often carried a
   walking stick
   with a snake head that contained
   his wand
   . After spending a year in the wizarding prison of Azkaban, possibly suffering the horrors of the Dementors' presence, his looks suffered greatly because of it, his skin taking on a yellowish and waxy look, and his eyes sunken and shadowed. His voice was also quite hoarse. Later that year, after having been a victim of the Dark Lord's wrath upon Harry Potter's escape from the Manor, Lucius' looks took a turn for the worse, as he seemed ragged, and he carried traces of his punishment, meaning he might have looked beaten and bruised. It is likely that his looks might have improved upon the fall of his former Master once he returned to everyday life. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm; this had faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.

  </h2>
  <p key="6542d309-4d1c-4598-afc3-718741b9d646">
   Due to being the embodiment of wealth and influence in the wizarding world, Lucius Malfoy took great pride in his aristocratic stature by viewing himself as being biologically superior to
   <a href="Non-magic people.html" key="c896737e-c10c-4c88-ac98-d4bc4386192a" title="Non-magic people">
    Muggles
   </a>
   and
   Muggle-borns
   , although his views on
   half-bloods
   were likely more tempered as many a half-blood appears on the Malfoy family tree.
   He was also a very shrewd, opportunistic social climber who was good at controlling others, but behind his veneer of respectability, he treated people cruelly. He callously utilised eleven-year old
   <a href="Ginevra Weasley.html" key="f89cfd90-e04f-4b94-a4e2-d30856715ece" title="Ginevra Weasley">
    Ginevra Weasley
   </a>
   in an attempt to both discredit
   her father
   in the Ministry, and remove Albus Dumbledore from his position as Headmaster of Hogwarts. This attempt would have resulted in her death if Harry Potter had not intervened.
  </p>
  <p key="dff9c85c-d827-4a4f-aa95-3c7f5c6b2cf7">
   Lucius could be intelligent and manipulative when he needed to be, allowing him to gain respect and the good will of high-ranking individuals through his fortune and family name. He even had influence with Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge. Lucius' constant donations to important establishments were actually nothing more than bribing Fudge for classified information, delaying laws, and receiving undeserved rewards and recognitions.
  </p>
  <p key="6d55c346-c305-45a9-ba18-82661bfd99a2">
   While putting much effort into maintaining an appearance of respectability, Lucius's slick demeanour did little to hide his self-serving nature. He had no qualms about appealing to whichever side would be more beneficial to his social advancement. He was never unconditionally loyal because he didn't want to be put in a negative light with people on either end. During the Quidditch World Cup, he anonymously participated in the lowly torturing of Muggles but fled when the Dark Mark was cast in the sky. In fact, rather than going to find Lord Voldemort when he lost all his powers in the first place, he instead pretended to have seen the error of his ways and tried to ingratiate himself to the Ministry of Magic. He claimed that he was always alert for Voldemort's return but when Voldemort pointed out that he had fled from the Dark Mark, Lucius was instantly silenced. Despite this, he did attempt to go through with Voldemort's plan of using his old school diary to open the Chamber of Secrets, not realising that the diary contained a piece of his master's soul (although Lucius was more focused on ridding himself of an incriminating piece of dark magic when the Ministry was conducting searches).
  </p>
  <p key="c8b7a1ae-4acd-455c-88c7-08f843b5c9ae">
   However, in spite of his ruthless and prejudiced nature, one of Lucius's more redeeming traits was that he was very loving and devoted towards his family, especially caring greatly for his wife and son. He and Narcissa were indulgent and protective of their only child, though Lucius also demonstrated that he had expectations for his son, in one instance berating him for being beaten academically by Hermione Granger. In the end, along with Narcissa, he demonstrated that his family was more important to him than serving Voldemort, especially after Voldemort lost both the respect and trust he once had from the Malfoys. Lucius' love for Draco and Narcissa also allowed him to overcome his more self-serving side as he charged straight into the thick of battle during the siege on Hogwarts in an attempt to find Draco, eventually locating him after Voldemort was finally defeated and the battle came to an end.
  </p>
  <p key="4ebc70c3-323d-4a71-b30e-b2ccda67c8e1">
   Despite his love for his son, Lucius became disappointed in Draco for losing his value in
   <a href="Pure-blood supremacy.html" key="dfd27736-f581-494b-aefc-71669fb3384a" title="Pure-blood supremacy">
    pure-blood supremacy
   </a>
   after the
   Second Wizarding War
   , and for marrying
   Astoria Greengrass
   , who underwent similar changes to Draco's. Father and son had an argument for Draco's willingness to let the Malfoy bloodline end with him to preserve Astoria's
   frail body
   , showing that Lucius still maintained his belief in pure-blood supremacy over the well-being of a human being, and that the mistreatment he received from the Second Wizarding War did little to change his opportunistic and bigoted personality. He even employed
   Theodore Nott
   to create a "true"
   Time-Turner
   , a dangerous device that would give him the potential to go back in time to avert Voldemort's demise. Yet due to the fact that he never used it, it shows Lucius remained inclined to the dark side, as was seen by his creating and keeping such a dangerous and illegal device, and passing it on to his son. However, it can be also inferred that Lucius didn't have any intention at all to bring back his former master, as Draco later reflected that Lucius seemed to like a world without Voldemort.

    , even though his comrades present could not. The extent of his power and skill as a Dark Wizard was shown by how he was able to successfully perform the
    Unforgivable Curses
    , which required tremendous skill and genuine malice, as shown by his proficiency at the
    Imperius Curse
    , successfully placing
    Sturgis Podmore
    and
    Broderick Bode
    under control, which allowed him to carry out his master's orders.
    He was also known to enjoy the torturing of Muggles with dark magic, along with his fellow Death Eaters.
    Furthermore, Lucius owned an impressive collection of numerous dark magical artefacts and

    objects in his home, many of which he likely purchased from
    Borgin and Burkes

    : Lucius was a highly skilled duellist, though not as aggressive as some of his fellow
    Death Eaters
    , instead favouring a more elegant, refined technique when he engaged an adversary, and generally demonstrating great form in his duelling style. A veteran of the
    First Wizarding War
    , Lucius fought the enemies of the Dark Lord during his former master's first rise to power and, as his most senior lieutenant at the time, led fractions of the dark forces into battle.

    Department of Magical Law Enforcement
    of the day,
    Bartemius Crouch
    , authorised the
    Auror Office
    to
    kill rather than capture
    , and Lucius consequently proved capable of emerging from combat situations that were no-holds-barred as well as fending off people who simply sought to arrest or capture him. In spite of not having seen action for about thirteen years, Lucius had maintained his skill at martial magic; successfully fought the
    Ministry
    officials that tried to apprehend him and his comrades during the
    Riot at the Quidditch World Cup
    , although he, like them, fled when the

As an adult, his political acumen was such that it enabled him to effectively influence matters of state; being persuasive enough in conversation to win the respect of high-ranking bureaucrats such as

After the war, Lucius retained his influence at the Ministry, even becoming a close advisor of the

    against his will. He was also able to successfully pretend that he had no idea at all who was behind the
    Chamber of Secrets
    attacks while it was actually he who caused it and even when confronted by Dumbledore over this fact, Lucius was able to keep his emotion in check to avoid a confrontation with

In addition to being unaffected by the mockeries of his cause and insults to the Dark Lord, he showed that if the objective was sufficiently important, he would not hesitate in leaving fallen comrades behind, focusing instead on seeing Lord Voldemort's orders through to the very end.

   that he and the other governors had voted on his suspension. Hagrid saw through Lucius and shouted at him accusing him of threatening the other governors. Lucius' response was to mock Hagrid's temper and advising him not to shout at Azkaban guards like that. This instance proved that Hagrid did not trust Lucius. Lucius described Dumbledore's decision to employ Hagrid as a teacher as "eccentric".
