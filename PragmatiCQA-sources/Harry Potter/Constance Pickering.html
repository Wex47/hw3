   looked like loads of fun when her
   mother
   and
   sister
   pulled them together. The pop always made her squeal with delight. But they were never able to have a tree at they house. Constance's mum said she was “allergic” to decorating. Therefore Constance loved looking in their neighbours' windows and seeing their trees, all bright and shiny.

   Circus Arcanus
   , she finally saw the old-time circus up close and lost the desire to go to one. She also hated clowns.

She believed her unlawful actions with manipulating the Calamity were morally justifiable, as she believed good things would come out of wizarding secrecy ending.
