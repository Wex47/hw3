   Magic was honed through study, training and formal schooling, but couldn't be simply learnt by Muggles. Non-magic skills, such as
   picking a lock
   with a hairpin rather than an

   , were uncommon to the point of novel rarity. Magic was used for mostly everything, including cooking, cleaning, travelling, communicating, child rearing and medical treatment. Although on the surface, magic appeared morally neutral, the benevolence or malevolence of a spell's nature was tied to the intention behind it. For instance, the

   couldn't effectively torture a victim with pain unless the caster desired to do true harm to the victim. The technology of the wizarding world appeared medieval in character (such as Hogwarts not having any lifts, but instead having only stairs), as the use of magic precluded the need for advanced technology (as well as the fact that magic interfered with electrical equipment).

   A Ministry of Magic was the primary governing body of the magical community in many countries. These ministries were led by a

   , or the local equivalent. In Britain, there was no political separation between executive, legislative and judicial branches of power. The Minister was elected, but it was unknown who has the power to elect him, although there does seem to be some degree of input from the general wizarding population. The duration of term seems not to be fixed; the longest known term was that of British Minister
   Faris Spavin
   who was in office from 1865 to 1903, a total of thirty-eight years.

   There was another reason for most wizards' avoidance of Muggle devices, and that was cultural. The magical community prided itself on the fact that it did not need the many (admittedly ingenious) devices that Muggles had created to enable them to do what could be so easily done by magic. To fill one's house with tumble dryers and telephones would be seen as an admission of magical inadequacy.

   There was one major exception to the general magical aversion to Muggle technology, and that was the car (and, to a lesser extent, motorbikes and trains). Prior to the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy, wizards and Muggles used the same kind of everyday transport: horse-drawn carts and sailing ships among them. The magical community was forced to abandon horse-drawn vehicles when they became glaringly outmoded. It is pointless to deny that wizardkind looked with great envy upon the speedy and comfortable automobiles that began filling the roads in the twentieth century, and eventually even the Ministry of Magic bought a fleet of cars, modifying them with various useful

However, this was no more than an unwritten code, and there was no obligation to conform to it.

   In spite of these clear instructions, clothing misdemeanours had been one of the most common infractions of the International Statute of Secrecy since its inception. Younger generations had always tended to be better informed about Muggle culture in general; as children, they mingled freely with their Muggle counterparts; later, when they entered magical careers, it became more difficult to keep in touch with normal Muggle dress. Older witches and wizards were often hopelessly out of touch with how quickly fashions in the Muggle world changed; having purchased a pair of psychedelic loon pants in their youth, they were indignant to be hauled up in front of the

   clothing comprised plain robes, worn with or without the traditional pointed hat, and would always be worn on such formal occasions as christenings, weddings and funerals. Women's dresses tended to be long. Wizard clothing might be said to be frozen in time, harking back to the seventeenth century, when they went into hiding. Their nostalgic adherence to this old-fashioned form of dress might be seen as a clinging to old ways and old times; a matter of cultural pride.

   Day to day, however, even those who detested Muggles wore a version of Muggle clothing, which was undeniably practical compared with robes. Anti-Muggles would often attempt to demonstrate their superiority by adopting a deliberately flamboyant, out-of-date or dandyish style in public.

   Most things of magical nature were hidden from Muggles. However, to wizards, the Muggle world was also very mysterious. Wizards tended to bungle attempts to disguise themselves as Muggles when they ventured into Muggle society (for example, wearing clothing meant for the opposite sex). Muggle technology, such as the telephone or revolver, were foreign and obscure to wizards.

    has stated that she imagines the wizarding population of the U.K. to be around 3,000. This estimate, although seemingly small, was understandable; a larger population would be far harder to hide from Muggles. However, she also stated that the number of students attending Hogwarts was around 1,000, which seems inconsistent with the 3,000 population estimate. Harry once observed in one Quidditch match that three-quarters of the stadium was supporting Gryffindor, while the Slytherin supporters numbered around 200. There were a large number of government departments, and

    . It seems very unlikely that a sixth of the entire country worked for a full year on one single project, though it was possible that the Ministry could had hired out from other countries. If one were to extrapolate from Rowling's statement that 1,000 students were at Hogwarts at a given time, however, a more sensible number seems to suggest itself: Given that 1,000 students spread over 7 years would make a class size each year of about 143 students, that nearly every young wizard and witch in Britain appears to attend Hogwarts, and that wizards and witches seem to live around 100 years if they don't die by unnatural causes, 1,000 Hogwarts students would put the total wizarding population in Britain at 12,000 to 15,000‚Äîa number that would support almost all details known about the wizarding world.

      If the wizarding population was 15,000 then the Muggle to wizard ratio was about 4,150 to 1. This means that the current world wizarding population was roughly 1.6 to 1.7 million. If this ratio was true then unless something was drastically different a thousand years ago there were less then 900 wizards and witches in all of Britain when Hogwarts was founded. 9 students per year, tops.
