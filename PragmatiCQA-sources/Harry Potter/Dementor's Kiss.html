    It is never explained what happens to the soul after one is kissed. It is theorised that the soul is either completely obliterated or that it is imprisoned in the Dementor. The latter would mean that the person who got kissed is literally trapped in the Dementor's body while the victim is still alive, which is likely why some call it a fate worse than death (assuming a Dementor's interior is as bad as their appearance). The Dementor's interior may be some kind of "dimension" in which the soul remains in torment, unable to pass on and earn their comfort of death. If that is the case, it is unknown if the souls are able to interact with the others that are trapped in the same Dementor.

      Some suggest that Dementors may die if "starved" of happiness for extended periods of time (one possible interpretation of Rowling's claim that "their numbers can be controlled"). If that is indeed the case, and the above theory on the soul being trapped in the Dementor is correct, it is possible that the trapped soul may then be freed and move on.
