   Later when their
   Prefect
   decided to teach Jacob's sibling how to duel, Rowan helped Jacob's sibling find a
   duelling book
   in the
   Artefact Room
   , where Jacob's sibling saw some visions and heard a mysterious voice saying
   a kind of ice
   was here and
   a vault
   would open. Using the duelling book, they learned a new spell before teaching it to Jacob's sibling.

   discussing the

   Rowan and Jacob's sibling came up with a plan of brewing a
   Sleeping Draught
   to use on Mrs Norris. After Jacob's sibling brewed it with
   Penny Haywood
   , they went back to the door with Jacob's sibling and another friend of them, tricked Mrs Norris into drinking it and opened the door. However, Merula overpowered them and
   went in
   first. The door led to
   a room
   in which they discovered the
   cursed ice
   , with Merula trapped in it. The ice spread, blocked the door behind them, and trapped Rowan and their friends too. Jacob's sibling saved them and their other friend reopened the door. Before leaving, Rowan noticed some code written on the wall and remembered it. The code, later deciphered by Rowan, suggested there was an
   Ice Knight
   who stood guard past the
   Vanished Stairs

   Jacob's sibling
   proceeded to search for their friend. In the
   Artefact Room

   a note

   which Rowan later deciphered, revealing that it was signed by someone using the initial "
   R

   common room
   different from their own, which would turn into a note with additional information when
   Untransfigured

   Vanished Stairs

   another mysterious corridor
   , which ended in a kind of mist. Jacob's sibling used the
   Knockback Jinx
   to clear the mist and revealed a hidden door covered with ice. They tried opening it but Rowan got hurt by some flying ice, so Jacob's sibling sent Rowan to the
   Hospital Wing
   .
   When visiting Rowan, Jacob's sibling brought a book about
   Wendelin the Weird

   Bill Weasley
