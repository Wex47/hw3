   Moody, during his time as an

   As the war continued, and the situation grew more fraught, the Ministry of Magic authorised their Aurors to use
   Unforgivable Curses
   against Death Eaters, a practice which continued for a time after Voldemort's fall from power. Moody was known to have killed a number of Voldemort's followers, including
   Evan Rosier
   in
   1980
   and possibly
   Wilkes
   around the same time.
   However, he did not kill if not necessary and having spent six months tracking
   Igor Karkaroff
   managed to capture him alive around the same time.

   Igor Karkaroff was sent to

   Karkaroff's trial
   held sometime after Voldermort's fall on
   31 October
   1981

   Augustus Rookwood

   Unspeakable

   Ministry

  <p key="0ccff737-7669-407e-8a16-d9460cb801ff">
   All the while, Crouch did his part in Voldemort's plan. Moody's life was spared due to Crouch needing his hair to create the Polyjuice Potion, and wanting to question Moody for his behaviour, patterns and such, so Crouch could successfully imitate him, all the while keeping Moody captive under the

   After recuperating in the
   Hospital Wing
   , Moody returned to health in time to sit at the staff table for the
   End-of-Term Feast
   as he was the designated DADA teacher, though he hadn't actually taught many (if any) classes due to his unfortunate predicament.

   Dolores Umbridge
   , possibly as a gift. It was set in the wood of her office door and used to aid her in spying on her workers. When Harry, Hermione and Ron
   infiltrated
   the Ministry to find the
   locket Horcrux
   , Harry discovered the eye and, disgusted by how it was being used, stole it. Doing so, however, raised the alarm.
   After escaping, Harry, early the next morning and before the other two were awake, left the tent they were staying in to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled and resilient-looking tree he could find. Then, in its shadow, he buried the eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. While it wasn't much, Mad-Eye Moody was given a proper burial.

  <p key="ed7ff4f9-c25d-4830-bdc6-75ce01f600a4">
   Alastor Moody was tough, brave and a consummate survivor, as well as an excellent fighter. He had a gruff, surly disposition. Having encountered many dangerous experiences throughout
   his career
   , he was hyper-paranoid and thought of by many as being delusional.
  </p>
  <p key="4c9d35fe-1663-4890-8843-c31a5f6f958c">
   Moody prepared all of his own meals and drank only from his
   personal flask
   in case someone tried to
   poison
   him.
   He was also very distrusting of most people, being very careful of whom he relayed facts about his personal life to. He kept what he considered to be important information back even from his colleagues and superiors in the
   Ministry of Magic
   , such as his birthplace and which house he was sorted into during his attendance at
   <a href="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.html" key="bfd45d3c-80a1-4469-ad3c-b7bab9dff637" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">
    Hogwarts
   </a>
   . The latter probably with keeping in mind that the house could identify some of his more essential personality traits, making it easier for the enemy to find weaknesses in his psychological defences.
  </p>
  <p key="8adb2c72-72c1-486c-855f-f98b733d4c43">
   Despite his paranoia, Moody was a brave individual. He never hesitated to go up against powerful dark wizards, including Lord Voldemort himself. Indeed his plan for getting Harry to safety involved using himself as a decoy knowing that Voldemort would likely go after him. This demonstrates both confidence in his own skill and a willingness to protect the rest of the Order members from Voldemort.
   It's likely that he knew that he could easily be killed during this encounter suggesting that he didn't fear death. Indeed he seemed to see being killed in battle as something to be proud of, as shown by his proud descriptions of the deaths of members of the previous Order of the Phoenix.
  </p>
  <p key="58ddd70d-8273-4c3a-a204-3e929274ef94">
   At the same time, he was far from being devoid of attachment towards his allies and comrades: He was visibly saddened by the insanity of
   Alice and Frank Longbottom
   , noting how being dead would have be better than having to live the rest of their lives insane, and openly acknowledged he was never able to find it easy to get over the loss of a comrade and only by turning the sadness he felt into motivation to get justice was he able to move on, as seen by his expressing sympathy towards
   Jacob's sibling
   after they lost
   Rowan Khanna
   and even acknowledging he should have trained them well enough.
  </p>
  <p key="7601c353-d49d-42f5-ba36-79803c83da60">
   He also had a well-known habit of being set off by sudden noises or movements in his presence and even attacked a witch who shouted "boo" at him on
   April Fools' Day
   . He even destroyed a birthday present carriage clock, believing it was a cleverly disguised
   basilisk egg
   ,
   and was described in a Daily Prophet article as having left the Ministry when deemed "

   He had the ability to think like a Dark wizard, which helped him track so many down. This also allowed him to outwit Voldemort during the

    . This speaks for his versatility and his extensive expertise in many magical disciplines, which is a very big accomplishment for a sorcerer. After all, while most wizards are skilled in different areas of magic, but are best at one specific kind, Moody reportedly had fully mastered several. Ultimately, through his work as both an
    Auror

     skills

    : Alastor Moody completed the
    Concealment and Disguise
    , as well as the
    Stealth and Tracking
    portions of
    Auror training
    with excellence, with him eventually becoming considered by many to be the most powerful Auror of all time. Moody was thus extremely capable in both offensive and defensive magic, the hallmarks of the Auror's trade, which he employed so effectively that Moody personally ensured that half the cells of
    Azkaban
    were filled with
    Death Eaters
    during the
    First Wizarding War
    , and was trusted by the
    British Ministry of Magic
    with the most important missions. Also, Moody somehow managed to keep his birthplace and Hogwarts house a secret even from his colleagues and Ministry superiors. Additionally, Moody was an expert on
    Dark Detectors
    , owning a
    Foe-Glass
    ,
    Secrecy Sensor
    , and
    Sneakoscope
    , among others. These skills also allowed Moody to be by far one of the most prolific members of the

     Duelling
    </b>
    : Alastor Moody was an extremely skilled duellist, since in the midst of the
    First Wizarding War
    and in its aftermath, Moody utilised
    martial magic
    to fight and defeat dozens of skilled
    Death Eaters
    ,
    Igor Karkaroff
    and
    Evan Rosier
    being among them.
    Moody's ability to switch from offence to defence made him an immensely formidable opponent. He was also known to cast spells with his
    walking stick
    , which gave Moody an extra advantage in case he was deprived of his wand. Moody often restrained himself from inflicting fatal injuries, and tried to take his opponents alive, which may have resulted in his permanent physical injuries: mutilated face, loss of an eye, and loss of a leg. Indeed, Moody's reputation as a duellist was enough to intimidate even
    <a href="Severus Snape.html" key="98df1ead-1aed-422d-9998-c1c636359df8" title="Severus Snape">

    , himself a master duellist. After years of retirement, Moody's duelling skills had apparently grown rusty, which diminished his effectiveness when he once again began participating in magical combat during the
    Second Wizarding War
    . Hence,

    and
    Barty Crouch Jnr
    were able to subdue Moody at his home, despite his owning several
    Dark Detectors
    that could warn him of danger, and they beat Moody before
    British Ministry of Magic
    agents could arrive on the scene. Despite this, Moody evidently managed to put up a considerable fight against the two Death Eaters, as Crouch later stated that he and Pettigrew had difficulty subduing Moody, and only managed to do it just before the Ministry agents arrived. During the
    Battle of the Department of Mysteries
    , Moody fought two
    Death Eaters
    simultaneously, defeated one of them with a single nonverbal spell, and later survived a duel with
    Antonin Dolohov
    , among the most powerful of Death Eaters, although Moody was injured and beaten by him. Despite this,

    Mundungus Fletcher
    , the intended target, had
    Disapparated

    and witches as an Auror. He may also have been considerably capable in breaking and countering curses, so as to be able to negate the dark spells performed by his enemies. Even though Moody's duelling abilities had grown rusty during his retirement, his mastery of defending against the Dark Arts was still exceptional, as Dumbledore (himself formerly a professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts) held Moody's abilities in high enough esteem that he hired Moody to teach

     Dark Arts
    </b>
    : While Moody usually refrained from using dark magic, inflicting fatal injuries on his opponents, and killing them if it could be avoided throughout his time as an Auror, since the use of
    Unforgivable Curses
    and other forms of Dark Magic were legalised by
    Bartemius Crouch Snr
    , to torture or kill
    Death Eaters
    rather than capture them in the
    First Wizarding War
    , Moody was capable of practising dark magic, despite not being a
    <a href="Dark Wizard.html" key="a02f4278-2e1d-46b8-b14c-fcdf651023e7" title="Dark Wizard">
     Dark Wizard
    </a>
    . Although the extent of his abilities in this field is unknown, there are pieces of evidence to prove that Moody had a rather considerable amount of ability and knowledge, as shown by the fact that he killed
    Evan Rosier
    when the latter resisted capture, likely by either the use of the
    <a href="Killing Curse.html" key="2b99c480-92a5-4d7a-a402-cfe3906277f7" title="Killing Curse">
     Killing Curse
    </a>
    or another curse which could inflict fatal injuries on his opponent,
    and by the fact that Moody attacked a witch who startled him during an April Fool’s Day celebration (although the type of spell he used is unknown). Moody may even be powerful enough in the field of magic to be capable of performing the Unforgivable Curses, considering that
    Barty Crouch Jnr
    while
    disguised
    as Moody, was able to demonstrate the Unforgivable Curses while teaching
    <a href="Defence Against the Dark Arts.html" key="9955bb8d-7992-435d-92d4-68539bde5dc4" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">

    on his students to build up their resistance, without arousing suspicion from even

     Albus Dumbledore
    </a>
    . This also hints that Moody was willing to demonstrate the effects of Curses on people if he taught them about the dangers of dark magic, as long as the curses did not harm people seriously in the process. However, this is ultimately debatable, as Crouch Jnr managed to temporarily fool Dumbledore of his true identity, thereby possibly deceiving Dumbledore into believing that he just taught the Unforgivable Curses, rather than directly demonstrating them, and practising the Imperius Curse on his students. Nevertheless, Moody's knowledge of dark magic was likely great, which aided Moody in his time as an Auror to counteract curses from opponents, as well as setting up
    Dark Detectors
    at his home. Furthermore, Moody was capable of using dark magic in a protective capacity, as he used the
    Tongue-Tying Curse
    as one of the protections held on
    12 Grimmauld Place
    , which worked successfully on anyone who entered the house.

    Moody was skilled enough in charms to cast them from his

    also admitted that (who he thought was) Moody "scared him slightly". After Moody was rescued from his imprisonment by Crouch Junior, he retained his intimidating demeanour as Harry and his friends were wary of doing anything wrong in his presence, Vernon Dursley, despite being an unpleasant person, was terrified when Moody revealed his magical eye,
    Mundungus Fletcher
    was pressurised by Moody into being a Decoy during the
    Battle of the Seven Potters
    , and his protective enchantments were enough to prevent Snape from entering
    12 Grimmauld Place
    after Snape killed Dumbledore. Additionally, even after Moody's death, some of his intimidating and paranoid traits were picked up by some members of the Order of the Phoenix, especially
    Remus Lupin
    ,
    Kingsley Shacklebolt
    and even Harry Potter himself, mainly asking questions that only other members would be aware of, even though they initially believed Moody was being paranoid.

    : Moody possessed immense willpower and bravery, being considered the greatest Auror of all time, having great respect in the
    British Ministry of Magic
    , and fighting in both Wizarding Wars on the front lines, thus showcasing an unbreakable spirit, further demonstrated by his ability to intimidate others. However, this would also induce Moody to come off as a hyper-paranoid consummate survivor, scanning his surroundings with his magical eye, preparing all of his own meals, drinking only from his personal flask,
    keeping his birthplace and Hogwarts house a secret even from his colleagues and Ministry superiors, and being set off by sudden noises or movements. Indeed, Moody even attacked a witch for shouting "boo" at him during April Fools Day, and destroyed a birthday carriage clock when he thought it might have been a disguised

   1994–1995 school year
   , in order to send Harry Potter to Lord Voldemort. Dumbledore was able to deduce the impersonation once Crouch lost his composure from over-excitement. Dumbledore and Moody fought together in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Moody was the next member of the order to die after Dumbledore.

   Although originally some members of the Order thought Moody was being overly paranoid with his extra security, and simply humoured him passively, during the rising stakes of the Second Wizarding War,
   especially after Alastor was killed, the other members took after his methods, mainly asking questions that only other members would be aware of; Lupin even acted violently and cautiously when asking Harry such a security question.

   During his years as an Auror, Moody captured and defeated many
   Death Eaters
   , such as
   Evan Rosier
   . According to
   Sirius Black
   , Moody was very cruel with the
   Death Eaters
   he fought against, but he never killed if he could avoid it.

   Moody captured Karkaroff after Voldemort's downfall. He also participated in Karkaroff's trial and told Dumbledore that they should take information from Karkaroff and then send him back to the
   Dementors
   .
   However, Dumbledore refused. Moody and Karkaroff met again in 1994, during the
   Triwizard Tournament
   . In fact, he wasn't the real Alastor Moody, but
   Barty Crouch Jnr
   , a Death Eater. After

   . Barty answered that it was his job to capture Dark Wizards and perhaps he remembered, meaning that Moody and Karkaroff knew each other well.
   It is unknown how the real Moody reacted when he learned that Karkaroff was killed by Death Eaters.

   Moody also held a grudge against
   Barty Crouch Jnr
   for abducting, imprisoning, and impersonating him, and was furious that Crouch damaged his magical eye by wearing it, causing it to get stuck from time to time.
   It is possible, though never confirmed, that Moody disapproved of Crouch's teaching style and methods, though in the opinions of the students (and presumably the faculty), they were virtually indistinguishable.

    "Alastor" is Ancient Greek for "he who does not forget", thus (1) "avenger", "persecutor", "tormenter", (2) "one who suffers from divine vengeance". It gives him, therefore, certain similarities to

    , whose name is that of the first of the Furies, or Erinyes, and means "implacable anger".
    It is similar to "Alastair", which is the Scottish form of
