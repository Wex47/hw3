   In addition, her fangs were so

Even when blinded (which took away her deadly gaze) she could still sense her prey through smell and sound, and proved to be extremely dangerous, if not more so, despite her disadvantage.

   The Basilisk's personality was not particularly complicated. Reflecting the personality of her master, she was extremely bloodthirsty and sadistic, based on what she said when Harry listened to her attacking her victims. She was blindly and unshakably devoted to the Heir of Slytherin, for aforementioned reasons. She had nerves of steel, and ferociously continued her goals no matter how many obstacles she encountered - including being blinded by a phoenix, at which point she resorted to using smell rather than sight.

While maintaining snake textures, one of the sculpting crew, Chris Fitzgerald, made the Basilisk’s skin endowed with osteoderms and other hard scales, while also giving eyes with functional eyelids and earholes, which real snakes do not have as their eyesight is poor and are deaf.

    , when Ron and Hermione entered the Chamber of Secrets, the skeleton of the Basilisk was still there, but appeared to be in a different spot than where Harry had killed her five years ago. However, it's common for decaying bodies to experience changes as they decompose, such as their bones parting or closing together because of the forces breaking down the body. A contributing factor may have been the rats in the Chamber of Secrets, which may have fed on the defeated serpent some time after her death. Also, in the film, the fang was used to destroy an additional Horcrux,

    There is a discrepancy in the description of the size of the Basilisk between the novel and film versions, with the snake being implicitly described as being much larger in the latter. At the end of chapter 16 of the novel, when Harry, Ron and Lockhart find the snakeskin in the novel, the narration states that

    Various medias have shown both the male and female depictions of the species for Slytherin's Basilisk. In the books, it seemed to be female: when Harry first saw it, he described it as "vivid, poisonous green" but made no mention of a red crown, which implied that either it had one and he simply didn't see it, or that the Basilisk was female. That was further supported by

    , the Basilisk tended to be depicted in colours. In the
    PC version
    (as well as the Game Boy Color one), she was not green, but purple, and attacked by spraying a purple stream of venom which Harry dodged. After failing to kill Harry from the mouth of Slytherin's Statue, the Basilisk popped up from the grating in the floor to try and bite or spray Harry. When she was killed, the Basilisk simply fell on Riddle's Diary, and presumably buried her fangs into the book and destroyed it. In the GBC version, however, Harry instead used the Sword of Gryffindor itself to destroy the diary.

      Also, in the console versions, the Basilisk was grey. To defeat her, Harry must fire a beam of light at the Basilisk's mouth/head when her weak-point was exposed in order to zap her (in the PS2 version, it was a black diamond-shape on her neck, while in the
      Xbox and Gamecube versions
      , it was her throat). Damaging it properly just once caused Harry to drop the Sword as it flung away to certain parts of the arena, and Harry rushed back up to it, picked it up again, and rinsed and repeated.
