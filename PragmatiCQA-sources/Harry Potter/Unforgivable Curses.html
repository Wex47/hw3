   Since the Unforgivable Curses were very powerful, their use required both great willpower and great skill in order to bring about the effects. One must also have a desire to use the curses for malevolent purposes.

   The Imperius Curse placed the victim in a trance or dreamlike state, an experience described as a "wonderful release" from any sense of responsibility, making the victim under its power profoundly susceptible to the influence of the caster, whose hold on their free will was deeply rooted in part by the victim's unwillingness to impart with the comfortable sensation and in part by their newfound lack of (and thus indifference to) the moral perspective of the caster's desires, making the victim inclined to carry out whatever task thrust upon them for no other reason than that they failed to see why they should not do so, leaving him or her largely under the complete control of the caster.

   The victim was calm, from doing things they would be physically incapable of otherwise, to committing horrible crimes, and they obeyed any order.

It is also possible that nobody would care what he did to Bellatrix Lestrange or any of the other high-profile Death Eaters, given the circumstances in which he used them (such as after Lestrange killed Sirius Black), or that his use of the Imperius Curse on the goblins would have been deemed beneficial for the greater good.
