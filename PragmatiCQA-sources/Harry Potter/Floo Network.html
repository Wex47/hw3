   The Floo Network was in use for centuries. The most notorious instance of accidental misdirection regarding the Floo Network happened in 1855 when, after a particularly nasty row with her husband, witch
   Violet Tillyman
   leapt into the living room fire and cried, between sobs and hiccups, that she wanted to go to her mother’s house.
  </p>
  <p key="5a707c45-2db1-41a2-90b2-d1fdfe52f202">
   Several weeks later, with no clean pots in the house and his socks in urgent need of washing, her husband
   Albert
   decided that it was time she came home, and took the Floo Network to his mother-in-law's. To his surprise, she claimed that Violet had never arrived. Albert, a suspicious man and a bit of a bully, raged, stormed and searched the house, but his mother-in-law appeared to be telling the truth. A poster campaign and a series of articles in the

   later, Violet had still not been found. Nobody seemed to know where she was and nobody had seen her come out of any other fireplace. For several months after her disappearance, people were afraid to take the Floo Network, in case it simply vanished them into thin air. However, time passed, memories of Violet faded, and nobody else disappeared, so the

   continued as usual. Albert Tillyman returned grumpily to his house, learned cleaning and darning spells, and never used the Floo Network again for fear of what it had done to his wife.
  </p>
  <p key="d3e646b3-f12a-46cc-b141-02fc22ce6ac2">
   It was not until twenty years later, after Albert’s death, that Violet Tillyman resurfaced. Due to the incoherent way she had spoken when she had entered the Floo Network, she had not emerged from her mother’s fireplace, but that of
   Myron Otherhaus
   , a handsome wizard who lived in
   Bury St Edmunds
   . In spite of Violet’s tear-stained, ash-covered and blotchy appearance, it had been love at first sight when she toppled out of his fire, and Myron, Violet, and their seven children lived happily ever after.

   The British network was governed by the
   Floo Network Authority
   , a section of the
   Department of Magical Transportation
   of the
   Ministry of Magic
   . This department was located on Level Six of the Ministry. The Floo Network Authority controlled which fireplaces were connected to the Floo Network, which required specialised magic. Travelling by way of the Floo Network could be done without specialised
   magic
   , and could be preferable for wizards too young to

   Nearly every wizarding home was connected to the Floo Network. While a fireplace could be disconnected by the use of a simple spell, connection required the permission of the
   Ministry of Magic
   , which regulated the Floo Network and prevented

  </p>
  <p key="aec4f294-7560-42d6-8315-4c3f8d5a56a5">
   In addition to domestic fireplaces, there were around a thousand fireplaces across Britain connected to the Floo Network, including those at the Ministry of Magic and various wizarding shops and inns. The fireplaces of Hogwarts were not generally connected, although there were some occasions when one or more had been tampered with, often without the staff’s knowledge.

   homes were not connected to the Floo Network unless special, temporary arrangements were made, which did not require the Authority to visit the location, as the connection could be made from the Ministry of Magic.

   To access the network, one had to toss a handful of Floo Powder into a fireplace, walk into the heatless, emerald green fire, and declare the desired destination. It was apparently also important for the traveller to keep their elbows close to their body. During the trip, the traveller would notice other fireplaces and hearths zooming past, but it was not possible for the traveller to see these locations clearly, as the speed of travel was too great.

   It was also possible to use the Floo Network to speak to someone in another location by merely putting their head through the green fire, as
   Sirius Black
   did to talk to Harry in the latter's fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts. The Floo Network could also be used to transport inanimate objects. For example: In
   1994
   ,

   used the fire tongs to put a piece of toast into
   Amos Diggory
   's mouth while he was talking to
   Arthur Weasley

   Quidditch World Cup incident
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b710b600-455b-4518-bb7f-cca0b66805a8">
   As Sirius Black could use the fire to talk to Harry in fourth and fifth years, but in Harry's sixth year, a special arrangement had to be made from the Ministry to enable students to arrive at Hogwarts, it seems that head-only transport was possible even if full human transportation was not. Otherwise, intruders, including Sirius Black, could simply use the fire in the common room to circumvent the castle's defences.
