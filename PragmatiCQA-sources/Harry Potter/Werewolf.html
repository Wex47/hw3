   A werewolf could not choose whether or not to transform and would no longer remember who they were once transformed, and multiple werewolves were known to kill their best friends or loved ones while in wolf form if they were given the chance.
   Despite this, they were able to recall everything they had experienced throughout their transformation upon reverting to their human form.

   It was a very difficult potion to make, with many complicated ingredients.

   The high cost of the ingredients made it virtually impossible for werewolves to brew the potion for themselves, as most were reduced to poverty and could not taste the potion without revealing their statuses.
   Because werewolves only posed a danger to humans, companionship with animals whilst transformed was known to make the experience more bearable as the werewolf would have no-one to harm and would be less willing to harm themself.

   The monthly transformation of a werewolf was extremely painful if untreated and was usually preceded and succeeded by a few days of pallor and ill health. The werewolf could display irritation towards friends.
   While in their wolfish form, the werewolf would entirely lose its human sense of right or wrong. However, it is incorrect to state (as some authorities did, notably

   Werewolves could be easily distinguished from regular wolves by their shorter snout, more human-like eyes, the tufted tail, and their mindless hunting of humans whilst in wolf form.
   At all other times, they appeared as normal humans, although they would age prematurely, and would gain a pallor as the full moon approached and then waned.
   It's unclear if the premature apperance of ageing is due to the affliction or the physical and mental stress it causes.

   The real difference between a wolf and a werewolf was in behaviour.
   Genuine wolves were not very aggressive, and the vast number of folk tales representing them as mindless predators were believed by wizarding authorities to refer to werewolves, not true wolves. Wolves were unlikely to attack a human except under exceptional circumstances. Werewolves, however, targeted humans almost exclusively and posed very little danger to any other creature.

   In a display of ignorance and arrogance, the Ministry expected werewolves would submit themselves to the department to sign various conducts and
   registries
   , which would also force the werewolves to promise to secure themselves from attacking others. No person would be prepared to walk into the Ministry to admit themselves as werewolves, thus showing the Ministry's lack of respect of werewolves' intelligence and dignity.
   Lyall Lupin
   , in particular, regarded werewolves as "soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death", until his own son was infected as a result of his prejudicial comment.

   Due to the oppression and discrimination they faced, some werewolves came to hate the wizarding society, and as such created their own society. Under Fenrir Greyback's leadership, this society worked to infect as many people as possible, especially children, with the goal of one day having enough strength to take control of the wizarding community.

It is unknown whether this was the only occurrence of the society, though it is implied that it was a new idea of Greyback's.

   attempted to regulate werewolves and thus the relationship that existed between them and the Ministry was a rocky one. According to
   Newton Scamander
   , werewolves were shunted between the
   Beast
   and
   Being
   divisions of the
   Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures
   for years.

   and
   Werewolf Capture Unit
   were both in the
   Beast Division
   , while at the same time the office for
   Werewolf Support Services
   was in the
   Being Division
   . These regulations and services were ultimately a failure, as no one would be prepared to walk into the Ministry to admit themselves as werewolves, and thus none took the prescribed responsibilities of the
   Werewolf Code of Conduct
   .

   The Werewolf Code of Conduct of

   </a>
   . Werewolves were required to sign a copy of the Code and to promise to refrain from attacking and biting non-werewolves. They were also supposed to lock themselves away during their wolf transformation periods. As no werewolf was willing to sign it, the Ministry had huge difficulty in hunting down culprits of these attacks, such that

   Werewolves were classified as XXXXX creatures in their transformed state.
   Dolores Umbridge herself incorrectly referred to werewolves as
   half-breeds
   , and drafted an
   anti-werewolf legislation
   that made it almost impossible for werewolves to find a job.

   Even when the Ministry was taken over by the Death Eaters, the relationship between the bureaucracy and werewolves remained strained. Death Eaters and their supremacist allies looked down on werewolves, only using them as foot soldiers and to intimidate the rest of the wizarding world into submission. They did let the werewolves have more freedom of movement than before the takeover, but in no way showed they were equals; Greyback was not given the Dark Mark despite being permitted to wear the Death Eater's robe, and genuine Death Eaters looked down on him, while Greyback himself acknowledged that if he took
