   If a Horcrux was destroyed, the soul within would die away and disappear. This seemed different for the "main" portion of the soul that remained within the body, as it served as the sense of awareness and psyche for the person, meaning that only one portion could maintain such full attributes despite multiple pieces, and this piece could retain existence without any container.

   who had committed murder could use a
   spell
   to place a torn fragment of their soul inside an external object called a
   Horcrux
   , which anchored their soul to the living world, thus rendering them immortal.
   Creating a Horcrux made the part of the soul left inside one's body unstable,
   and, for obvious reasons, it was widely considered the most wicked of all the
   Dark Arts
   as well as a violation of the first of the
   Fundamental Laws of Magic
   . Existing as an earthbound soul was a fate that few would prefer over death.

   Harry Potter's soul was whole and unblemished, but he shared a body with a soul-bit of Voldemort, a state of being which Dumbledore's silver instrument described as "in essence divided". That is why Harry could sometimes view things from Voldemort's point of view or even
   Nagini
   the snake, since the creature also contained a Horcrux.
  </p>
  <p key="bced868f-24b0-47a5-be1a-0be16de16760">
   A soul that had been torn apart and partially removed from the body would of course become lesser in substance. This was shown to cause the soul to experience some form of mental and physical regression. In extreme cases, this regression could be so severe that the individual's soul essentially became sub-human and remained in
   Limbo
   , unable to leave and unable to become a ghost.
  </p>
  <p key="3f211055-7f96-4b5c-8be5-29ed8ace602f">
   It was possible for a wizard to create more than one Horcrux. However, only one wizard, Voldemort, had ever been recorded as having done so. Due to his willingness to create multiple Horcruxes and committing many murders in doing so, Voldemort was widely considered the most evil wizard on record. However, there seemed to be a limit as to how many times one could separate the soul before doing any more attempts, as going further seemed to be dangerous, which was exemplified by how Voldemort ceased creating any more Horcruxes once he intentionally reached his desired six and refused to create any replacements for the ones that were destroyed.
   In fact, Voldemort's soul was so unstable that by the time he created five Horcruxes, it split on its own when his

   It was possible for a person to live without any soul at all so long as their heart and brain were still functioning.
   However, without a soul, a person was left in an incurable
   vegetative state
   — they had no awareness of themselves or the world around them.
   The soul couldn't be recovered once it had been lost.
   This was a fate that was considered by many to be worse than death.

   . The

   The first two times a Dementor attacked him, Harry Potter heard his mother screaming as she died.

        Seeing that ghosts are imprints of a wizard's or witch's soul,
        in which its appearance would take on that of the said wizard or witch at the moment of death, it does seem likely that Voldemort's soul is indeed reflected by his rudimentary body's form.
