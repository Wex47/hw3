   Umbridge was a sadistic woman who, like Filch, enjoyed torturing and punishing students. Thus, the caretaker started to support Umbridge and follow her orders.

   With the passing of

   He was also probably the one to affix the notices with the Decree on the noticeboards of the Common Rooms.

   Sometime after the Easter holidays, Fred and George Weasley set off a
   Portable Swamp
   on the Fifth Floor Corridor, and left the school in a blaze of glory.
   They did not leave instructions on how to remove the swamp and as such, Umbridge and Filch tried fruitlessly different means of removing it. The other teachers, who could have removed the swamp in an instant, preferred instead to watch Umbridge struggle. The area was roped off, and Filch was given the task of getting students across it to their classrooms in a small punt.

   Inspired by the twins' legendary flight to freedom, a great number of students wreaked havoc in the school:

   put
   Nifflers
   into Umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart while searching for shiny objects and leapt on Umbridge when she entered, trying to gnaw the rings off her fingers. Dungbombs and
   Stink Pellets
   were frequently dropped in the corridors, so that students performed
   Bubble-Head Charms
   on themselves to get a supply of fresh air.
   Due to all those misdeeds, Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch students in the act, but the problem was that there were now so many of them, he never knew which way to turn. He was aided by the Inquisitorial Squad, but odd things like antlers sprouting from their heads kept happening to its members.

   Argus Filch was a

   and a
   hunchback
   .
   He had a horrible, pouchy
   and pasty face
   and bulging, pale eyes,
   along with sunken, veined cheeks.
   He had long hair with a bald spot on the top of his head and quivery jowls.
   Skinny-ankled,
   Filch would usually wheeze
   and shuffle when walking.
   He had knobbly hands and whenever he got the

   Filch usually wore a brown coat,

   Very foul-tempered, cantankerous, and easily annoyed, Filch had an extremely unpleasant personality. Despite working at a school, Filch deeply resented the students and was greatly disliked by them in return,
   and some members of the staff, as well. However, when called on to oversee the evacuation of the majority of the students before the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch led the children to safety without hesitation.
   In keeping with his dislike for students and their inevitable tendency to create messes and disorder (which he, as caretaker, would get stuck cleaning up), Filch idolised "the old ways" of discipline and constantly lamented that he was no longer allowed to use corporal punishment.
   Filch was obsessed with keeping the Castle neat and tidy, and was infuriated when students made a mess with potion ingredients, or forgot to wipe their feet.

  <p key="829dba8e-4683-40d5-a05f-1f083c308dc9">

   His obsession with the castle's cleanliness led him to neglect actual security at times, as he forgot to lock the doors at least one time even in the more dangerous hours, something Slughorn reprimanded him for.

   so, curious, they let off another Dungbomb in his office and "nicked" the
   Marauder's Map
   , which was stored inside that drawer, from him.
   The caretaker had punished them many times during their Hogwarts years, for their trouble-making. Among his many file cabinets documenting the punishments he handed out over the years, Filch had an entire drawer dedicated to the twins.
   Upon the opening of the
   Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes

   very much. Dumbledore appeared to like Filch, although the latter was unpleasant. When Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, was petrified, Dumbledore seemed to care about Filch and his cat.
   However, Filch did always plead to Dumbledore to permit him to use corporeal punishments on the students, a request that was never granted, which became a primary reason why Filch preferred Umbridge as head of the school.

   Filch thought that Hagrid was an oaf, and he also told Mrs Norris, his cat, to watch Hagrid when he entered the castle.
   Filch also did not care for Hagrid as a professor and treated him as if he were inferior, possibly because he was half-giant.
   Hagrid, on his side, insulted Filch, calling him "

  </h2>
  <p key="90e6b774-07ed-43d1-ad03-f658bee20554">
   The name "Argus" comes from Greek mythology, where it was the name of
   a giant with one hundred eyes
   who served the goddess
   Hera
   as a watchman (much like Mr Filch's role in patrolling the hallways of Hogwarts). His surname, "Filch", is an English word meaning "to steal", usually in a sneaky manner.
