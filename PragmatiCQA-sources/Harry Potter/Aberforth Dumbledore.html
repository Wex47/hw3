   Aberforth was Ariana's favourite sibling, and he took part responsibility of taking care of her. However, he was not at home when Ariana lost control of her magic and accidentally killed their mother. Following his mother's passing, Aberforth wanted to leave school and take over the care of his sister, but Albus would not allow it. Albus wanted his younger brother to complete his education at Hogwarts, although he bitterly resented having to abandon his grand plans.
   By this time, Aberforth was described as a "wayward" young man, known to chuck goat dung at their neighbours and inclined to get into

   Deathly Hallows

Upon learning of his elder brother's ambitions, Aberforth was disgusted by such a plan, but he was also concerned as Ariana would have to be involved. When it was time for Aberforth to return to Hogwarts, he decided to finally confront Albus and Grindelwald on the impossibility of such a scheme and angrily pointed out on Albus's neglect of Ariana and that he could not be the heroic leader of the revolution with Ariana in tow, which Albus later said to have "brought him back to reality" despite not wanting to hear the truth of the words Aberforth shouted at him.

   Aberforth was devastated by the death of the younger sister he and his mother spent years caring for and furiously blamed Albus for Ariana's death, going as far as to
   physically assault
   his brother at their sister's funeral and actually breaking Albus's nose, shouting that Ariana's death was his fault.
   He didn't forgive his brother and continued to resent him for years, despite Albus's immense feelings of regret, of which Aberforth did not know until Harry revealed it to him, which allowed Aberforth to finally forgive his brother.

Harry, already doubting Dumbledore's intentions, was unable to respond. With little prodding, Aberforth indicated he knew

   Aberforth was regarded by most people who were familiar with him as being odd and gruff.
   Alastor Moody

   He also had a long memory; he once placed a lifetime ban from the Hog's Head on
   Mundungus Fletcher

   Aberforth had a sharp wit and was a highly talented

   charms
   on a goat upset him. Despite not being as intelligent as his brother, he seemed to know what Horcruxes were when told about the hunt, suggesting a greater intelligence than he let on. He was a very terse person, commenting that the

It was the overall amount of damage that would be caused by such quest that he found disgusting. He even went as far as to duel both of them at once, despite knowing fully well they were superior duelists who he would certainly not stand a chance against. His magic was being amplified by the anger and determination he felt to hold them at bay, a feat made even more impressive by the fact that he previously had been subjected to the
   Cruciatus Curse
   by Grindelwald.

   In addition, Aberforth would join the
   Order of the Phoenix
   despite it being led by the older brother who he so disliked for his glory-seeking, and blaming him for their younger sister's tragic
   death
   , indicating he was willing to overcome his grudge towards his brother to fight for the whole wizarding world, further showing his morality. Although he never forgave Albus for years, Aberforth still considered Albus his brother and maintained contact with him, with their relationship being deemed cordial by
   Elphias Doge
   , and Aberforth joined the
   Order of the Phoenix
   , which Albus founded and led, and attended Albus's funeral. Also, in spite of claiming earlier that "

    You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves

   " and also showing still his resentment of Albus's true nature, Aberforth was shocked into silence as he contemplated what Harry had revealed: that Albus had never forgiven himself for Ariana's death and was always tortured by the fact that he was responsible for it.
  </p>
  <p key="b7514b12-8682-43d4-8b51-30a3394a0954">
   Ultimately forgiving his brother, Aberforth then fought bravely and selflessly at the
   Battle of Hogwarts
   , which may be out of a desire to honour his older brother's memory by protecting the school Albus had led for so long, possibly sparked by the regret of never even considering Albus had regretted Ariana's death and also that he never managed to reconcile with his brother. In addition, he appeared to consider the possibility that his brother would never resort to having Slytherin students held as ransom against the Death Eaters before sneering at the idea. His unwillingly courageous nature shows itself in one of his last conversations with Harry; after Harry thanked him for saving his and his friends' lives twice, Aberforth gruffly retorted, "
   <i key="06e4a8e6-66d8-45a8-a485-d201562cfde5">

     Duelling

    : During his school years, Aberforth was said to prefer to settle things by duelling instead of negotiating,
    which shows that, even as a student, he was already an active and experienced duelist, although
    <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="26b3ad2a-c888-47bc-a195-53ce4d81cd72" title="Albus Dumbledore">
     his brother
    </a>
    was still superior to him, noted to have the ability to put Aberforth in his place had he wanted to. Despite this, by the age of fifteen, his duelling skills were already sufficient to stand his ground in the three-way duel between himself, Albus, and
    Gellert Grindelwald
    when they were teenagers, both of whom eventually became arguably the most powerful duellists to ever live.
    Aberforth also noted the reason he did not face
    Patricia Rakepick
    , an infamously powerful individual, in battle when she came to his pub was not because he was afraid of facing her but because she would have disappeared without any traces for him to inform the Auror Office about, showing he was assured of his ability to at least fight against the dark witch long enough for reinforcements to come. During the
    Battle of Hogwarts
    he fought courageously and defeated the very skilled Death Eater
    Augustus Rookwood
    and emerged as one of the survivors,
    showing him to have been remarkably proficient in
    martial magic
    to have survived such a bloody battle.

   was described as a good woman, but Aberforth knew her secretive nature and bitterly described himself and Albus as having learned lies and secrets from her.

It is unknown who actually cast the spell which led to her death. At Ariana's funeral, Aberforth broke his brother's nose and shouted at him that her death was all his fault. Long after Ariana's death, Aberforth continued to keep a

   Aberforth and his brother had a strained, often acrimonious, relationship most of their lives. Aberforth was resentful and bitter about the fact that he was living under Albus's shadow due to Albus's superior magical capabilities and spent most of his time caring for his sick younger sister,
   Ariana
   . After the death of
   Kendra Dumbledore
   , Albus was left to care for his brother and sister and the two remained as strained as ever, as while Albus insisted that Aberforth complete his education, Aberforth disliked the way Albus was treating Ariana. When Albus and his friend, Gellert Grindelwald, began planning to start a revolution, Aberforth and Albus grew even more estranged as Aberforth was disgusted by his older brother's ambitions and this soon escalates to the point that Aberforth angrily confronted Albus and bluntly told him that Ariana would not be accompanying and his plans are impossible, resulting in Grindelwald initiating a duel that resulted in Ariana's death, which finally caused Albus and Aberforth to become fully estranged, as Aberforth felt extreme amount of anger at Albus and he fully blamed him for Ariana's death,
   shouting at him at Ariana's funeral and breaking his nose.

   Although Albus initially was resentful towards Aberforth for dragging him down from fame and glory with the responsibility of being head of the family, Albus loved his brother dearly, and came to respect and admire him greatly for his devotion to Ariana.
   However, despite Albus being known to feel sadness for his estrangement with his younger brother, he never attempted to change Aberforth's opinions of him, likely as he recognised that he fully deserved Aberforth's resentment and accepted it as punishment for his part in the tragic death of Ariana. But he did have a desire to reconcile with Aberforth, as whenever he looked at the Mirror of Erised, he would see Aberforth reconciled with him. While he still bitterly resented Albus even after the death of his older brother, Aberforth eventually forgave his late brother after Harry explained Albus' drinking of the
   Drink of Despair

   Cruciatus Curse
   on Aberforth; Albus then defended his brother and the three boys began to duel. None of the three ever knew who had cast the fatal spell, but by the end of the duel, Ariana lay dead on the floor. Grindelwald immediately fled the country; the two brothers both lived the rest of their lives with the fear that

    In a 2005 interview, when asked who her favourite member of the Order of the Phoenix was, J. K. Rowling stated that "...there is one member of the Order of the Phoenix that you have not yet met properly and you will, well, you know that they are a member, but you haven't really met them properly yet and you will meet them in
    seven
    , so I am looking forward to that." It is likely that Rowling was referring to Aberforth, as readers had "met" him as the owner of the Hog's Head, but at the time did not yet know him for who he was.
