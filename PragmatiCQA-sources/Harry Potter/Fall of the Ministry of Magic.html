   Minister for Magic
   Rufus Scrimgeour

    Lord Voldemort

   and his
   Death Eaters
   were ascending in strength. Most of this was due to the former
   Minister for Magic
   Cornelius Fudge
   refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return. Fudge's desire to prevent the destruction of the peace that the Ministry has worked so hard to maintain resulted in losing the chance for the citizens to prepare themselves for this tragedy and allowing the Death Eaters to have a full year to rebuild their forces unhindered.
  </p>
  <p key="29d8e633-5a22-4eed-9c77-d3f84ff805e6">
   By the time irrefutable evidence of Voldemort's return was shown, the Ministry had found themselves fallen too far back to get back on track, which was made worse when both
   Fudge
   and his successor
   Rufus Scrimgeour
   were more worried about the Ministry's reputation than actual security, such as covering up breakouts and arresting random suspects.

    The plan

  </h4>
  <p key="40a8d860-8f85-42c4-b0b9-959a498d6689">
   In the summer of 1997, Voldemort and his followers plotted to overthrow the
   Ministry of Magic
   . To this end, there was a
   break-out
   of Death Eaters from
   Azkaban
   , which the Ministry decided to keep quiet in order not to spread panic. Voldemort set up his headquarters at
   Malfoy Manor
   and had his servants use the Imperius Curse to gain servants in high places within the Ministry. By July,
   Corban Yaxley
   relayed information to Voldemort at the Meeting at Malfoy Manor that he had managed to place
   Pius Thicknesse
   , head of the
   Department of Magical Law Enforcement
   , under the Imperius Curse. Because Thicknesse had regular contact with Minister for Magic
   Rufus Scrimgeour
   and with the heads of other Ministry departments, he was useful in subjugating the others to Death Eater control and then having many people help Voldemort when he eventually decided to stage the coup.

  </h3>
  <p key="7bcef206-138a-4a41-a436-3813c6465244">
   On 1 August, 1997, the Death Eaters put their plan into action and staged a coup against the Ministry: after a brief and violent battle, Death Eaters defeated Ministry Officials and
   Aurors
   and took control of the
   Ministry's Headquarters
   in London. Minister
   Rufus Scrimgeour
   was arrested and interrogated for information about the whereabouts of
   <a href="Harry Potter.html" key="4ad19d52-1132-41cd-a451-3e4df1fae52c" title="Harry Potter">

   </a>
   , but refused to give in and was thus brutally tortured and murdered. Thicknesse was installed in his place as Voldemort's puppet. The coup was described as "swift and quiet" and virtually silent, and many members of the public were unaware of the take-over. This was to ensure the community was suppressed with confusion and distrust, as if Voldemort had declared himself Minister outright, it might have induced open rebellion. The official version of what happened was that Scrimgeour has resigned as Minister.
  </p>
  <p key="8efd9318-dc2f-4098-912a-74b508f63978">
   The coup also resulted in

   , allowing him to control the information given to the public. With this new tool he spread propaganda against Harry Potter, Muggle-borns, and allies of the Order of the Phoenix. This was disguised as the Ministry's new policy.

  <p key="4bdd17db-0796-4520-b437-ef212ba05107">
   Using the power of the Ministry, the Death Eaters managed to take down the protections the Order had placed around its new headquarters,
   The Burrow
   , and its safehouses, as well as use illegal spells to full effects without fear of detection and prosecution. Death Eaters arrived at the Burrow during the
   wedding
   reception of
   Bill Weasley
   and
   Fleur Delacour
   , but
   Kingsley Shacklebolt
   had managed to send warning using his talking
   lynx
   Patronus

   Some guests escaped, including Harry,

   .
   Those who remained were interrogated and roughed up, but no one was killed. Others connected to the Order, such as Ted and
   Andromeda Tonks
   , were also tortured for information about Harry, but left alive. They also
   attacked
   the
   home

   Various Death Eaters were given high-ranking positions in the Ministry (including
   Travers
   and
   Selwyn
   ), Yaxley became the new head of the
   Department of Magical Law Enforcement
   . The
   Taboo curse
   was placed upon Voldemort's name almost immediately, as a method of tracking enemies. This method worked since the only people brave enough to call Voldemort by his name were
   Order of the Phoenix
   members.
   Antonin Dolohov
   and
   Thorfinn Rowle
   nearly captured Harry, Ron and Hermione this way after tracking them to Tottenham Court Road.
   Harry Potter was declared Undesirable No.1, with a reward on his head, and anyone with known connections to him was placed under surveillance, such as
   Arthur Weasley
   .
   Muggle-borns and Blood-traitors were marked as Undesirables as well.

   The Ministry under Voldemort made a great many sweeping changes in line with Death Eater ideology. It was claimed by the

   and by Ministry-printed propaganda, that magic could only be inherited, meaning that
   Muggle-borns
   must have stolen it from "real" wizards and witches. The Ministry used this excuse to force Muggle-borns to register with the
   Muggle-Born Registration Commission
   , which convicted them of theft and sentenced them to
   Azkaban
   , or stripping them of their wands, jobs and families and leaving them as
   impoverished beggars
