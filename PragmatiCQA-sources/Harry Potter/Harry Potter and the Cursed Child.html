    As stated by Rowling, the story is part of the
    canon universe
    .
    However, many have chosen not to consider it as such, stating that the play contained too many contradictions that were well-established in the original books along with past information from Rowling herself.
    Dissatisfied fans and even some critics stated that while Cursed Child brings forth a sense of nostalgia, the overall quality of the plot was weak when compared to the original books and many have likened the play to amateur fanfiction.

      An example of this was the destruction of the Time-Turners during the

      and yet in the story there are two Time-Turners.

      Another example was how they have characters act in ways they never would. For instance, having Cedric Diggory become a Death Eater just because he lost the Tri-Wizard Tournament when it was confirmed that Cedric would never act like that.

    A major criticism that many fans vocalise about the story was its rampant use of time travel, claiming that it contradicts many of the facts established about time travel in
