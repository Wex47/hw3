   , Vernon tried everything to stop him getting it as more and more letters arrived via
   Owl post
   , resorting to increasingly desperate measures as the letters entered the house in variously creative ways and becoming more and more unstable. He finally cracked one Sunday when a veritable flood of letters came pouring down the chimney, and had the entire family leave the house to try and prevent contact from Hogwarts. However, his erratic attempts failed after driving the family several miles away from home, and upon staying in a gloomy Hotel, he was shocked to see letters turn up there even. Eventually, he took his whole family to a
   hut on a small rock
   on
   the sea
   , in a final drastic attempt to prevent contact and even bought what was most likely an illegal firearm as a final defence.
   But even this did not work, because it was found by

   they probably deserved it, as well as that they were (in Vernon's opinion) freaks anyway and that the world was better off without them (also in Vernon's opinion). Hagrid threatened Vernon with his umbrella in response. The exchanges became more and more heated until Vernon angrily insulted

   giving a pig tail

   1992

   Mr Mason
   and
   his wife
   over for dinner to try and secure a deal with Mr Mason about a stock of drills. He also forced Harry to stay in his room and pretend he did not exist.
   Harry was willing to comply with this, arguably because he did not want to create unneeded problems for his uncle (and get himself in further dislike). Due to the appearance of
   <a href="Dobby.html" key="9cc0debb-06ec-4ecf-bc07-8b8e477313d6" title="Dobby">

   accused Harry of doing Dobby's
   levitation
   of the pudding, and threatened expulsion from Hogwarts for violation of the Underage Magic Act, but elected to let Harry off with a warning.
   Furious for his business deal failing and learning that Harry was forbidden to use magic outside of Hogwarts, Vernon had Harry locked in his room and even had bars fitted on his window to punish him, believing that Harry would be unable to escape without using magic. However, Harry was rescued by

   with them, Vernon angrily asked his nephew about the letter, as the Molly's letter was covered in stamps which the postman found amusing. After Harry explained, he yelled at him initially but eventually decided that his nephew could go.
   He and Petunia were very displeased and discomforted with the idea that

   while Arthur was trying to fix Dudley's swollen tongue; it ended up being four feet long before Vernon and Petunia let Arthur shrink it.

   had returned to terrorise the both Wizarding and Muggle communities again. During the summer, Vernon and Petunia were concerned regarding Harry's overly attentive nature regarding his listening to the Muggle news, believing he was up to no good. Ironically, he and his wife were ignorantly unaware that Dudley was in fact terrorising the neighbourhood with his
   gang
   , engaging in anti-social behaviour and bullying younger children, instead believing that Dudley was simply going round his friends' houses for tea.
   Furthermore, Dudley was attacked by

    Dementors

   capital punishment
   . However, even when Harry explained to him that he had in fact saved Dudley from the Dementors and they were likely sent by the recently resurrected Voldemort, Vernon decided to throw Harry out of the house, since he did not want Harry staying because he believed that Voldemort was after him. However, he was reluctantly forced by Petunia to allow him to stay, on the grounds the neighbours would notice, when in reality she had just received an angry

   because of the letter from
   Mafalda Hopkirk
   , Vernon was delighted at the concept of Harry being punished by the Ministry.
   He locked Harry into his room for several days until leaving with his wife and son, to accept an award for the best kept lawn in England. In fact, it was a trick of

   It is unknown if he remained in contact with his nephew, if even only on Christmas-card terms, like Dudley did: nevertheless, he had two great-nephews and a great-niece by Harry. It is also unknown whether Vernon returned to his home at

   Vernon was described as a big, beefy man with a large purple face. He had thick, dark hair, a bushy black moustache (half of which he tore out through frustration on two occasions), with hardly any neck and mean little eyes that narrowed to slits when he was angry.

   Vernon was renowned for his physical reactions to magic or when attempting and/or failing to control his temper. In the case of the latter, a vein would throb very prominently in his temple. His face would also change to several different colours; a sickly porridge grey, red to green and various shades of purple. In one case, his face was said to resemble a "

    Personality and traits
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="d40fab3b-5586-4f2a-8cb8-ab80ca209f40">
   Vernon was an arrogant, surly, combustible, blustering, abrasive, petty-minded bully who was completely intolerant of people who were different than himself. Like Petunia, he detested magic and anything unusual or out of the ordinary, which he labelled as "funny business" in
   1981
   .
   Naturally, he despised his nephew Harry, who as a wizard was very much a symbol of both, and spitefully bullied him all throughout the latter's childhood. Vernon's disdain for Harry was so great that he forced him to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs and, after Harry discovered he was a wizard despite Vernon's best efforts to keep it from him, prohibited Harry from saying words such as "magic" or "wizard" inside the house.
  </p>
  <p key="d99485ad-65fe-4e88-ad3d-4202cd8cdf0b">
   In addition to being a bully towards Harry, Vernon was absurdly vain, materialistic and unsympathetic to beggars and vagrants. He was very much concerned with status and wealth and tended to judge people based on how big their cars were or their clothes. He enjoyed ordering around his employees at Grunnings, enjoying his status and authority as director of his company, sitting above them in a
   high office
   on the ninth floor.
   Vernon liked to look big and impressive, yet was easily intimidated whenever he was put in situations that he was not used to, such as dealing with wizards such as

   He was also shown to be quite oblivious to small things, particularly when cross, such as in 1992 when he asked Harry if he looked stupid to him when he became annoyed with the boy: he had a bit of fried egg sticking to his moustache.
   Sometimes when he was angry, Vernon would mumble, barely forming complete sentences.
  </p>
  <p key="06137507-8fc2-44fb-8833-cd84d88ac41f">
   He was also shown to be very conservative in his political views, as he read the
   <i key="11411e9e-9e16-477c-b58a-e4d66134ebd4">
    Daily Mail
   </i>
   , a British tabloid famed for its right-wing political stance. He also seemed to have a low opinion of the state of the UK, saying: "
   <i key="60d37e8c-5b08-4a5b-82b1-4b040c61b17c">
    No wonder the country's going to the dogs

   !" upon finding out that there was a Ministry of Magic.
   He advocated the death penalty, especially for murder; after seeing a mug shot of Sirius Black, he claimed that
   <i key="db764eb2-bf41-4f3e-8fc0-75e15ffc9311">
    "hanging's the only way to deal with these people,"
   </i>
   showing his harsh view of criminal justice.
  </p>
  <p key="42e62016-efb8-48c0-8f97-29c0a822b8a1">
   Vernon enjoyed complaining about anything that did not fit in with his narrow-minded views of the world and his favourite subjects included people at work, the council, the bank, motorbikes, as well as most of all: Harry.
   He showed his disdain to Harry with nasty smiles and he was not afraid of physical confrontations, going as far as wrestling with his son, Dudley, to confiscate Harry's
   Hogwarts acceptance letter
   .
   He frequently became angry and he received brandy from his wife when he was rendered speechless by the "vanishing glass" incident at the
   zoo
   .
   Despite his bad temper and blustering, bullying, dominant nature however, Vernon showed himself to be a coward when confronted by those he could not bully or intimidate, as shown by his terrified reaction when Hagrid furiously confronted him upon discovering that he had not told Harry the latter was a wizard, or who his parents were or that they had been murdered. All this Vernon had kept from Harry in order to "stamp the wizarding rubbish out of him."
   He was likewise scared by Alastor Moody when the latter confronted him over his bullying treatment of Harry,
   and would immediately back down whenever Harry threatened him with magic.

   . Then Petunia threw herself upon him in such violent gratitude that he dropped his battered sausage.
   Together they did everything they could to keep their nephew Harry from learning the truth about his heritage and abilities and bossing him in any sort of ways. They also endlessly pampered and spoiled their only son, Dudley.

  <p key="c31831b0-6149-463e-87e1-74822e46e8be">
   Vernon spoiled Dudley in a similar manner to his wife: they appeared to buy Dudley anything he wants, often apparently to waylay a tantrum and indulged him with treats and activities, particularly those which Harry was not allowed.
   However, there is evidence that Vernon and Petunia were indulgent of their son's behaviour and contributed to his obesity before

   They were frequently shown to be oblivious to his bullying, and at times criminal, behaviour, Vernon showing pride in his son and interpreting some of these characteristics as manly. Vernon had a similar physique to Dudley, also being very large and when convinced to make Dudley diet by the school nurse, was forced disapprovingly to join in the family's regime, whereas previously he and his immediate family considered Dudley merely to have a healthy appetite. He became very proud of Dudley's resulting sporting achievements when this enforced exercise and diet helped him become a competing boxer, believing Dudley gave the

   Vernon saw Harry as nothing more than a waste of space. Throughout his life, he tried to keep Harry as downtrodden as possible, in hopes of squashing the magic out of him. He lived in fear of anyone finding out about Harry's "

   ".
   Vernon rarely referred to Harry by name, instead referring to him as "[the] boy" or "You", both to Harry directly and in conversation. Vernon would have a tendency to throw fits whenever Harry (either accidentally or intentionally) used words such as "magic", "wand", "Hogwarts", or "broomstick" in the house.
   Both guests and neighbours believed Vernon's explanation that Harry attended
   St Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys
   , rather than the local comprehensive.
   Vernon even told Mr Mason and his wife that Harry was "disturbed" when explaining his sudden presence in the house in
   1992
   .

  <p key="87add26a-f82d-4ee3-a53a-a2b64774e26d">
   Though Petunia felt some moral obligation to let Harry stay (however grudgingly and bitterly), Vernon felt nothing towards his nephew. He had no trouble throwing him out of the house, despite full knowledge that doing so would put his life in grave danger. Petunia, however, intervened when Dumbledore sent her a
   Howler
   , reminding her of the agreement she made when they took in Harry. Additionally, when Harry was forced to go to court for underage magic, Vernon openly admitted that he hoped that Harry would get the death penalty.
   However, despite his dislike of Harry, he would still go to

    In the books, Vernon appears to be so afraid of magic that he forbids Harry to say any word related to magic (e.g. "wizard", "Hogwarts" "Hogsmeade", "Hogwarts Express" and the word "magic" itself). When he discusses magic, he usually uses euphemisms like "you-know-what" (magic), "that school" (Hogwarts), "that abnormality" (magic or magical ability), "[Harry]'s lot" (wizards and witches), or simply "it" to refer to magic. In the films, he actually utters the word "magic". Ironically, he's not afraid of the name

    The scene in which the Dursleys leave the house in the seventh book is shortened down to a scene at the beginning of the seventh film where Vernon and Dudley are leaving their house and are hastily packing away their furniture. Petunia is seen waiting in the car already. Vernon has two lines in this scene while Dudley has one and Petunia doesn't speak.

This is farewell!" something at which Harry nods. Harry sarcastically remarks “I’m just a waste of space, isn’t that right, Vernon?”, a statement that Vernon refuses to disagree with.

    Richard Griffiths, along with the actor of Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe, was shown on a poster in the films as an obvious reference to him. The show the poster was for is Equus.

    ) because of his intolerance both of magic and of his ward. Sir Ector calls Arthur "wart" or "you" and Vernon calls Harry "boy" or "you." Likewise, Dudley is based on
    Sir Kay
    , Sir Ector's son who mistreats Arthur.

    Unlike his magic-hating character, Richard Griffiths was very interested in the idea of a boy attending a school for wizards. Throughout the film series, he was hopeful that he could film a scene where Uncle Vernon is summoned to Hogwarts; however, this was firmly vetoed by J.K. Rowling.

    , the beginning has Harry approaching the vent and it opening up while Vernon is heard offscreen yelling at Harry that magic doesn't exist before shutting it forcefully enough to leave a quaking motion as the Warner Bros. logo pops up. In the actual film, it shows Vernon after tossing Harry into the cupboard under the stairs opening the vent and admonishing Harry before cutting to the inside just prior to Vernon shutting the vent. On a similar note, Vernon's delivery for "There's no such thing as magic" slightly differed in the trailer and in the film.
