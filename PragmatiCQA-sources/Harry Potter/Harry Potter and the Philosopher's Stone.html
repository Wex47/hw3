   On Tuesday,
   1 November
   1981
   , the Dursleys begin the day by gossiping about their neighbours while Petunia wrestles the disagreeable Dudley into his high chair. None of them notice a large tawny owl flying past their window, but Vernon does notice the tabby cat reading a map and a street sign outside their house. He forces himself to forget the cat, but upon arriving in town, he notices large groups of people wearing cloaks. He eavesdrops on them and hears them talking about “the

   Vernon returns home to find the cat still waiting there, and it only gives him a stern look when he tries to shoo it away. The news is full of unexplained owl sightings and firework displays, and Vernon nervously asks Petunia if she has heard from her sister recently. Petunia is upset, but she does tell him that she hasn't heard from her sister and that their nephew's name is "Harry." Vernon's heart sinks. He finds it difficult to fall asleep that night but eventually manages it.

   comes to Harry's door one morning and wakes him with a shrill voice. Harry is trying to think about the dream he had been having. It was about a
   flying motorbike
   , and he thinks he has had the same dream before. Aunt Petunia tells him to make some bacon, as she wants everything perfect for Dudley's 11th birthday. Harry dresses into a pair of Dudley's old clothes and goes into the kitchen, where the table is covered in Dudley's presents.

   Harry has jet-black hair and green eyes. His glasses are held together by tape because Dudley has smashed them so many times. The thing that distinguishes Harry from others the most is the
   lightning-shaped scar
   on his forehead. He often wonders how he got it and the Dursleys have told him that he got it from the car crash that killed Harry's parents. Harry doesn't know much more about the accident though because the Dursleys' first rule is to not ask questions. Dudley comes into the kitchen and begins to count his presents, only to find 36, which he angrily recalls is one fewer than the year before. Aunt Petunia states that they are going to buy him two new presents while they are out.

   Dudley is allowed to take a friend to the zoo and chooses his friend

   . Piers comes to the house with his
   mother
   . A half-hour later, Harry sits in the car with Dudley, Piers, Vernon, and Petunia. On the way, a motorbike overtakes them and Vernon complains about them. Harry remarks that he had a dream about a flying motorbike once and Vernon snappily reminds him that motorbikes do not fly. Harry thinks about all the strange things that have happened to him: He once turned his teacher's wig blue, jumped onto the school chimney, and grew all of his hair back the morning after a haircut. At the zoo, Dudley and Piers find the animals boring. Harry is left to watch a
   Boa constrictor
   as it sleeps and, when Dudley tries to make it move, it wakes up but still doesn't move. The snake begins to move after Dudley and Piers slink away. Moments later, Harry

   and finds that it miraculously understands him. Piers calls Dudley and Vernon back to the snake's exhibit upon realising that it is now moving. Dudley pushes Harry out of the way (he lands 'hard on the concrete floor'), and presses his face against the glass. Harry becomes angry and somehow the glass
   vanishes
   and the snake gets out scaring Dudley and Piers. As the snake slithers away, Harry thinks that he hears it speak back to him. Piers tattletales on Harry that he had been talking to the snake and Uncle Vernon sends him to his cupboard –with no meals for a week as cruel punishment.

   Harry can't believe it. He has never had a letter in his life. On the back there is a wax seal with a

Dudley wins, so Harry resorts to looking through the gap between the floor and the door. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia are discussing the seal on the back. Uncle Vernon says that they should just ignore it. Later, when Harry is in his cupboard, Uncle Vernon comes in and says that he has burned the letter, and that they are moving him up to
   Dudley's second bedroom
   . Slightly surprised, Harry moves all of his things up to the bedroom, wishing he had his letter. The next morning at breakfast, Dudley is asked to get the post by Uncle Vernon. After banging things all the way down the hall with his Smeltings stick, Dudley calls out that there is another letter addressed to Harry, this time in '''The Smallest Bedroom''', rather than '''The Cupboard Under the Stairs'''. Both Harry and Uncle Vernon rush to the hallway in an attempt to get the letter. After a minute of confused fighting, Uncle Vernon emerges clutching the letter in his hand.

   Determined to see what his letter says, Harry creeps down the stairs early the next morning and approaches the door. He is going to camp there until the post arrives, then he will finally get to read his letter. When he reaches the door, however, he stands on Uncle Vernon - who had the very same idea. Every day, letters appear addressed to Harry, and they are doubling in number. Eventually, there are so many letters arriving that Uncle Vernon resorts to nailing shut the letterbox. But they begin to appear in the strangest of places: under the door, squeezed through the window, and Aunt Petunia even finds some while cracking open
   eggs
   . Finally, they get attacked by thirty or forty letters being fired out of the fireplace. Despite the sender's efforts, Harry still does not manage to get his hands on one of the letters for long enough to read it and a furious Uncle Vernon states that they are leaving the house. They get into their car and leave ten minutes later. They travel for miles until they eventually stop in front of a gloomy hotel on the brink of the city. Vernon's attempt to shake the sender off are not successful, however, as more letters come for Harry to the hotel the very next morning. Again, they get back in the car and finally stop to get on a
   boat
   that takes them to an
   island with a small hut on it
   . Harry remembers that the next day will be his eleventh birthday. When they get there, Harry can't sleep with the raging storm outside, so he counts down the time until his birthday. When his watch turns to the next day, there is a loud knocking at the door - something wants to get in...

   discovers Ron, Harry, and Hermione out with the book one evening and confiscates it from Harry on the feeble pretext that library books may not be taken outside of the school. Harry’s suspicions of Snape continue to grow. Harry starts to notice that Snape is limping. Going off to retrieve the book from Snape, Harry overhears Snape talking to Argus Filch about the fact that the three-headed dog has attacked him, leaving a cut on his leg, which makes Harry even more suspicious.

Hermione notices that Snape is staring at Harry and muttering to himself, signs of casting a curse. As two of Harry's teammates, the Weasley twins, try to rescue Harry in the air, Hermione rushes over to Snape in such a hurry that she knocks Quirrell over, sneaks behind Snape, and sets his robe on fire. Suddenly, the spell on Harry’s broom is broken and Harry is once again in control. He starts speeding toward the ground and lands, catching the Snitch in his mouth and nearly swallowing it.

Harry realises this is the face of Voldemort and Voldemort demands Harry give him the Stone. Harry refuses and runs, but Quirrell seizes him. However, the contact with Harry's skin burns Quirrell and causes him to have boils all over the area in which Harry touched him. Harry grabs Quirrell's face, then his arm, and holds on, with the blinding pain in his head building, until he feels the arm wrenched away before he blacks out.

   He awakes in the hospital wing with Dumbledore there, telling him Quirrell did not succeed at getting the Stone, and indeed the Stone has been destroyed. In spite of this, there are other ways in which Voldemort can return. He cannot be killed, and he left Quirrell to die. Dumbledore explains the reason why Quirrell could not touch Harry was because Harry's mother had died to save him, protecting him with her

   . Dumbledore responds that Snape was only grudgingly protecting Harry this year to pay off a debt he owed due to James Potter saving his life during their Hogwarts years. Harry then receives a visit from Ron and Hermione, who reveal that Slytherin came in first for the House Cup and, with Harry unable to play in the championship Quidditch match, Ravenclaw easily won the match, before Madam

   feast, Dumbledore awards some last-minute points for the recent events. He gives Ron and Hermione fifty points each, and Harry sixty, which places them in a tie with Slytherin for first place. Dumbledore then recognises that while it is hard to stand up to enemies, it is even harder to stand up to friends as Neville did, and he awards Neville 10 more points, which was the most house points Neville had ever gotten. This puts Gryffindor in the lead and the winners of the House Cup, to much rejoicing from everyone but the Slytherins. Not only were Gryffindor students happy, but Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw were happy to see Slytherins downfall. Soon, their trunks are all packed, and they take the Hogwarts Express back towards the muggle world. Harry, Ron and Hermione all say their goodbyes before heading home.
