   This may not have been totally inaccurate, as Hermione typically showed respect for genuine talent and skill in people, even if said people had upset her, as Professor Snape did on a few occasions. Therefore, if Hermione had no such praise to give, it indicates that Pansy probably did lack talent or intelligence, though the fact that she was made a

   Pansy most likely lacked common sense and rational thought, as her extremely unwise suggestion of handing over Harry Potter to Voldemort resulted in the entirety of Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw threatening to magically assault her in retaliation, meaning she was likely unable to consider the consequences of her selfish actions. Her actions also made her appear very cowardly, since Pansy did appear to be very frightened and anxious about the situation, but failed to demonstrate any bravery or decency in response.

   Pansy frequently taunted others about their physical appearances, such as Angelina Johnson's hair
   or Neville Longbottom's weight,
   about their love lives,
   or about their families. She also tended to take great amusement in seeing others publicly embarrassed or hurt.
