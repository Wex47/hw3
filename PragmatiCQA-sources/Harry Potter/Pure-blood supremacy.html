   Some extremists considered blood traitors to be nearly as bad as the Muggle-borns they were prejudiced against.

   The most extreme of the pure-blood supremacists sought to purge the world of those they consider "impure". They often tolerated half-bloods out of necessity (though still disdained them), but Muggle-borns were persecuted and Muggles were viewed as nothing more than animals. Supremacists debated amongst themselves whether Muggles and Muggle-borns should be subject to death or slavery, but the generally agreed goal of pure-blood supremacy was a world where Muggles are relegated to a lesser role.

      The Malfoys' family motto means "purity always conquers" in Latin. As such they were best known for a command of political influence and respect that flourished with their traditional tendency for courtship with richness and power around them. They are known for their disdain of Muggles and Muggle-borns.
      While they strongly believe in the concept of blood purity, they did not take it to the interbreeding extremes, thus allowing half-bloods to appear on their family tree.
