   . Its first known resident,
   Ekrizdis
   , practised the worst kinds of
   Dark magic
   and constructed a fortress on the island, luring Muggle sailors there to torture and murder them. After his death, the various
   concealment charms
   placed on the island faded, and the

   became aware of the mysterious site's existence. Those who entered the deserted fortress to investigate discovered, among other horrors, an infestation of
   Dementors
   . The wizarding authorities of the time considered destroying the fortress, but, fearing reprisal by the dark entities or the island itself, decided against such action, and the Ministry allowed the sizeable colony to remain; the island was thus left unmolested and unchecked for many years, perhaps decades, until the
   International Statute of Secrecy
   was established.
  </p>
  <p key="bfb98cce-deec-4f8e-9199-1170cd7ae4f1">
   Due to the impracticality of using small, local prisons, which could result in bangs, smells and light shows if inmates escaped, plans for a single, purpose-built wizarding prison on some remote
   Hebridean
   island were made at the passing of the International Statute of Secrecy. However, when
   Damocles Rowle
   was elected Minister for Magic in
   1718
   , he insisted on using Azkaban instead, seeing the Dementors as a potential asset: putting them to work as guards would save expense, time, and lives. This plan was eventually put into motion and, despite protests, Azkaban remained the magical prison of Great Britain until the end of the
   <a href="Second Wizarding War.html" key="66756a36-d484-42e6-b1ee-93040076d839" title="Second Wizarding War">

   </a>
   , primarily due to its seemingly zero breakout rate. From that point on, the Dementors served the Ministry as the guards of Azkaban, as the arrangement allowed them to feed on the emotions of the prisoners within its walls. Opposition to the use of Azkaban did manifest, however.
  </p>
  <p key="6ab30594-aba8-4d4a-aa93-25899c5f5ab1">
   Somewhere between
   1733
   and
   1747
   Minister
   Eldritch Diggory
   visited Azkaban, and was horrified at the inhumane levels of despair and insanity that the Dementors induced in the prisoners. He formed a committee to find alternative solutions or mitigating measures, the least of which was to remove the Dementors; even this, however, met opposition from those who feared a mainland invasion if the Dementors were deprived of their food source. Diggory died of
   Dragon Pox
   while in office, and thus the campaign to find an alternative to Azkaban's Dementors stalled. Reversing his predecessor's position, when Minister
   Hesphaestus Gore
   took office, the prison was renovated and reinforced.
   No serious opposition to the continued use of the prison arose in the next few centuries, and no Minister considered closing the prison until the Minister of Magic

   's physical appearances were telltale signs of their deterioration within the prison, losing most of their great aristocratic looks. The Dementors' primary concern was their supply of human emotions to feed upon and, disregarding the prisoners' release terms, seemed unhappy to let them go. However, many denizens of the wizarding community remained happy that it was the Dementors who guard the prisoners, believing that they were what kept these dangerous people inside the remote fortress. On the other hand, there had been many who opposed the idea of keeping

   There was most likely an Anti-Apparition jinx on Azkaban; if there hadn't been, wizards and witches could simply have Apparated from the prison to the outside world. However, since it is debatable that most witches and wizards needed a wand to Apparate, this might be irrelevant, as none of the prisoners maintained possession of their wands. Most of the prisoners would barely have had enough strength to Apparate anyway, as the mere presence of Dementors, particularly in large numbers, inhibited the use of magical powers.

   Visits to the island were heavily restricted, as only respectable Ministry officials were noted to be allowed to visit with any possible relatives. An example is when Barty Crouch Snr and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit to their imprisoned son due to the former's high status in the government; they took advantage of this privilege to smuggle Barty Jnr out of prison.
   The

   was also allowed to visit the prison, as to check out on certain prisoners on their conditions, as

   It may also derive from the name of the Russian town
