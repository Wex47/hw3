   , each school being represented by one champion. Selected champions compete in three tasks — traditionally judged by the Headmasters or Headmistresses of the competing schools — designed to test magical ability, intelligence, and courage. Champions competed for the honour and glory of winning the Tournament, for the
   Triwizard Cup
   , and a monetary prize. The first Tournament was held sometime around the late
   13th century
   .
  </p>
  <p key="84e86fef-b276-43fb-82d0-6146dd67f3a8">
   The Tournament was notorious for being extremely dangerous: many champions died while competing, and it was discontinued at some point in or after
   1792
   , due to the high
   death
   toll.
  </p>
  <p key="bc07ef4d-d3df-4eaa-94ba-d3dab6782c99">
   In
   1994
   , the Tournament was revived with restrictions in place in an attempt to stop potential deaths.
   One of these restrictions was that all applicants had to be over the wizarding age of majority (which is 17), or else they would not be allowed to apply to be champion.
   The
   1994 Triwizard Tournament
   is famous for having had four competing champions instead of three,
   and for also having ended in tragedy with the death of

   and for the
   Rebirth of Lord Voldemort
   .
   No subsequent tournaments were held following Cedric's death.

   Durmstrang Institute
   . Held every five years, the competition would be hosted by each school in turn, the judges for the Tournament comprising the headmasters or headmistresses of the schools.
  </p>
  <p key="21ded511-9fcd-45d3-b15b-862f36e488f5">

  </p>
  <p key="fd89e2b0-5327-43d0-ac75-fc45394c514b">
   Due to the risks involved in overcoming the extremely dangerous tasks, and an increasing number of deaths, the Tournament was eventually discontinued at some point in or after the
   1790s
   . Multiple attempts had been made to revive the Tournament, but none succeeded until the
   1994–1995 school year

   nevertheless died at the end, though this only occurred due to the tournament being sabotaged.
   Due to this, the tournament had been permanently discontinued.

   Returning to Hogwarts with Cedric's body, Harry was promptly whisked away from the crowds by Crouch Jnr, still in the disguise of Professor Moody. As the assembled crowd learned that Cedric was dead, Dumbledore realised that something was amiss with Moody, since the real Moody would never have taken Harry away from the tragic scene.

   In Moody's office, Crouch Jnr started to question Harry about what had happened, and how it felt to stand in the Dark Lord's presence. Harry, unnerved by Moody's seeming adoration of Voldemort — something that went against everything he knew about Moody — was shortly rescued by Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape.

   Polyjuice Potion
   wore off, since, in the excitement, he had neglected to take it at the proper time to maintain his cover, and his duplicity was revealed. Under the effects of

   Right after Harry's victory, two judges of the Tournament fled far away immediately. Karkaroff felt Voldemort's return and summoning all Death Eaters, and being one who sold out many of his comrades, he abandoned the tournament's results for the sake of his life. Bagman made a bet against his goblin creditors that Harry would win the tournament, but they accounted that Harry and Cedric won together. Therefore not what Bagman wagered on, Ludo fled to avoid paying a highly increased debt that he could not afford to.

   Each competing school was allowed one champion to represent them during the Tournament. Students wishing to participate wrote their names and the school they attended on a piece of parchment and entered it into the
   Goblet of Fire
   . The Goblet was an impartial judge, and selected what it considered to be the best student from each school. At the appointed time, the Goblet ejected the names, making each selected student the official champion for their school. Each selected champion was then bound by a magical contract to see the Tournament through to the end.
  </p>
  <p key="9d4d218b-0fb1-4e16-9bd4-b06e8b900ba0">
   Each Tournament consisted of three tasks designed to test the champions' courage, intelligence, resourcefulness, and magical ability.
   These tasks were exceedingly dangerous and differ from year to year.
  </p>
  <p key="e8ea36d6-bd06-4d8a-aa5a-7ca7eaa148a9">
   Champions received marks in each of the tasks from a panel of judges, consisting of the headmasters or headmistresses of the competing schools.

  <p key="8c8d4aec-b20a-4287-b4e3-1be08f02bb85">
   Each champion was supposed to stand alone during the Tournament, receiving no outside help from anyone, including friends and teachers. Cheating was frowned upon, though it had been known to take place several times during the history of the Tournament, and some people believed it to have been a traditional part of the event.

   The
   Yule Ball
   , held on Christmas Day night, was a traditional part of the Tournament.
   The Ball included a feast, and a formal dance where the champions and their partners led the host school in dancing.
   Students old enough to attend were allowed to bring a friend. Students that were too young to attend might attend if invited by a student old enough to attend the ball.

   During the 1994 Tournament, new rules were added in counter to the previous death tolls, hoping to keep the participants safe. One such rule was that no student under the age of 17 may participate in the tournament.
   It was due to Cedric Diggory's death despite these new safety measures that led the tournament to be cancelled permanently.

    It is likely that the Triwizard Tournament could be viewed as the Wizarding equivalent to the Olympic Games. Champions, all representing their respective schools/nations, compete for honour and glory in games designed to test their abilities, with each Champion's respective school supporting that champion even if they do not like the individual student (shades of the fans of the Olympics supporting their home countries athletes, with no regard for personal favour of any one athlete). Even the judges of the Triwizard Tournament sit in booths and hover their scores over their heads like Olympic judges.

    ) "The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago ..." 1994 - 700 = 1294 (or so). However, Pottermore notes that Hogwarts has 63 wins, Beauxbaton has 62, so a minimum of 125 tournaments have been held (if Durmstrang has no wins). 125 tournaments *5 years = 625 years. Taking the last traditional Triwizard Tournament in 1794 - 625 = 1169. Even if some of the wins accounted for on Pottermore are from modern-day tournaments (1994 and after) the latest date possible for the first tournament is around 1194. Of course, it is possible that on some occasions, the Tournaments were held more often than every five years, for unknown reasons.

    During the

    tournament, the prize was 1000 Galleons. It is not stated if the prize value has been consistent throughout the tournament's history. According to Quidditch Through the Ages, 1000 Galleons in the 13th century would have amounted to several million in modern currency.

    erroneously states that the incident at the 1792 tournament was caused by a
    basilisk
    , rather than a cockatrice. This is an error, as the breeding of basilisks was banned since medieval times, and using one in the Triwizard Tournament would be far too dangerous since its gaze alone could kill the entire audience. This error is probably caused by the fact that the mythology behind cockatrices and basilisks is so similar that many people use their names interchangeably.
