   Marjorie went on to live in the country, in a house with a large
   garden
   where she bred
   bulldogs
   .
   She seemed to have a large amount of money, because she frequently bought her nephew, Dudley, expensive presents
   and was noted to be on holiday sometimes.
   She did not usually have time to cook. At some point in her life, she would live next to
   Fubster
   , a retired military colonel. She fell in

   During the summer of 1993, she stayed at the Dursleys' house for a week. Ignorant about Harry's "

   ", Marge was told that Harry attended
   St Brutus' Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys
   .
   Before her arrival, Vernon grudgingly made a deal with Harry, that if he held his tongue and didn't pull any "funny" stuff during Marge's visit, Vernon would sign Harry's
   permission form
   , allowing Harry to visit
   <a href="Hogsmeade.html" key="5c8976f4-3760-47ba-aba5-490ed44d3d03" title="Hogsmeade">
    Hogsmeade
   </a>
   on
   weekends
   . During Marge's visit, she cruelly belittled Harry for the entire week that she was there – something that he took in stride. When she asked if the cane was used at St Brutus', she dismissed the idea of not hitting people who deserved it as namby-pamby wishy washy nonsense. When she asked how often Harry was beaten and he casually replied "all the time", she insisted that the school was clearly not hitting him hard enough if he could speak of the purpoted beatings so nonchalantly. Marge advised Petunia to call the school to demand they not hold back in their beatings. Vernon abruptly changed the subject to discuss the news of the
   <a href="Sirius Black.html" key="47c1dce4-6c6e-43ad-81c5-5ca2e99bb7d0" title="Sirius Black">

   , and nothing further was discussed about Harry at that time.
  </p>
  <p key="d1b2747c-4d0e-4cbb-92c1-1ced804c072c">
   She also delighted in comparing Harry to Dudley, and remarked about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory person. On the third day of her visit, she began to insult Harry's parents. At that moment, her wine glass exploded. While Marge shrugged it off as a firm grip, Vernon and Petunia suspected differently, as did Harry, who quickly slipped out of the room.
  </p>
  <p key="316561d7-9944-4163-af15-f54548f99fca">
   The final evening of Marge's visit initially seemed to go off without an issue, where the talk was mostly about Vernon's
   business
   .  However, Marge, who was drunk on wine and Brandy started on Harry again, and insulted
   <a href="Lily J. Potter.html" key="2898d58a-8133-453c-9fde-93eeb475ede8" title="Lily J. Potter">

   <a href="Underage magic.html" key="a12dfdb9-7e2c-4392-8673-5153a188e737" title="Underage magic">
    lost control of his magic
   </a>
   and
   blew her up
   like a balloon with a non-verbal
   Inflating Charm
   . This caused her to float upwards towards the ceiling, forcing her brother, Vernon, to try and pull her down, only to be lifted up himself.
   Later, however, she was successfully punctured and her memory was modified by the
   Accidental Magic Reversal Squad
   from the Ministry of Magic, so she would have no recollection of the event.

  <p key="edebfbb9-024e-46ef-932e-4c8df4fdd824">
   After this, the Dursleys never invited Marge to stay again while Harry was in residence and he never saw her again.

  <p key="6e760f5c-2c41-4e51-a9cf-684558149212">
   Marge was an arrogant, spiteful, ignorant, abusive, selfish, cruel and vicious woman who seemed to brazenly take delight in making the lives of anyone she disliked miserable, given her spiteful, abusive treatment of Harry. In some respects she was even more horrible than her brother; although Vernon was likewise a bully to Harry, at the same time he preferred to avoid spending time with him whenever he could help it, which Harry was happy to comply with, while Marge seemed to want Harry under her watch at all times just so she could belittle him by spewing out suggestions about how he could improve himself. She ate and drank excessively and was, overall, a powerfully dominant woman who made even Vernon look weak and powerless.
  </p>
  <p key="1aa1b602-334c-497d-9c5b-e73e17a4d546">
   Despite her fondness of bullying Harry and deeply unpleasant nature, she appeared to be on good terms with her like-minded brother, nephew, and sister-in-law, as shown when she assured Petunia that she "wasn't saying anything against her family" while calling Lily Potter a "bad egg." However, it's implied that the Dursleys in return only tolerated Marge because she was Vernon's sister. Petunia, in particular, disliked Ripper making a mess in the house, Dudley only put up her kisses because he got paid for them, and even Vernon would make attempts to defuse Marge's attacks on Harry, by changing the subject or sending Harry out of the room, as he knew what Harry was capable of if he was pushed too far,
   and when he had learned of Marge's illness two years earlier, he did not seem concerned.
   When she visited, she always brought expensive gifts for Dudley, such as a computerised robot, and less satisfactory "gifts" for Harry such as a box of dog biscuits. It was unknown if Marge knew Harry's parents, but she constantly called them insulting names and implied their uselessness to society. Marge also had no knowledge of Harry's magical heritage, which the rest of the Dursleys intended to keep secret.
  </p>
  <p key="818a7e4e-a7eb-4ae9-a780-f40f7aaf8cf3">
   While she was not a blood relative of Harry's, he grew accustomed to calling her Aunt Marge. She was generally very cruel to him and once allowed Ripper to chase him up a tree and refused to call him off until past midnight. She heavily favoured her nephew Dudley and even went as far as whacking a young Harry in the shins to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues and also suggested that Harry be put into an orphanage instead of "being a burden" on the Dursleys. She finally pushed Harry too far when she insulted his dead parents to his face, showing that she was so unpleasant she could not even show respect for his loss at such a young age, much like her brother.
  </p>
  <p key="52ea9886-cc85-4e37-9a0a-499d9a06fab2">
   Much of Marge's reprehensible behaviour, however, was the result of having been shunned by Colonel Fubster, whom she was in love with, though it should be noted, that she was already a horrible enough person for Fubster to not wish to marry her on those grounds.
