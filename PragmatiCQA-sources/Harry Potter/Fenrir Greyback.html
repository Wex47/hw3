   By the mid-1960s, the amount of Dark magical activity across the country was growing steadily. While few knew what was behind it all, this was a precursor to

    Death Eaters

   were recruiting Dark creatures to help them overthrow the
   Ministry of Magic
   ,
   and among them was Fenrir Greyback, who did not join the Death Eaters because he believed in Voldemort's cause, but because allying himself with them would give him greater access to potential victims.
   Although considered to be a Death Eater by the enemies of the Dark Lord, Greyback was not given the
   Dark Mark
   on his forearm.
   He also was never accepted as a Death Eater by those belonging to Voldemort's innermost circle of followers, as Voldemort was prejudiced against his

    lycanthropy
   </a>
   ; despite Greyback's services to their cause: Greyback was used as a weapon by Voldemort, who would often use the notorious werewolf to intimidate people into doing his bidding, threatening to send Greyback after their children.
   It was around 1965, after one such attack that resulted in the deaths of two
   <a href="Non-magic people.html" key="24244c1e-6da4-47b3-ab95-a810d37e6c53" title="Non-magic people">

   </a>
   children, that Greyback was brought in for questioning before the
   Ministry of Magic
   . Due to the inadequacy and ill-maintenance of the
   Werewolf Registry
   , the Ministry did not know Greyback to be a werewolf, and he pretended to be a Muggle tramp who was amazed at finding himself in a room full of wizards and horrified at the talk about the dead children.
  </p>
  <p key="a6781e42-b8be-4e92-97e3-2544ef6f4439">
   His filthy clothing and lack of wand managed to convince most of the questioning committee, although
   Lyall Lupin
   , an authority on Non-Human Spiritous Apparitions that was among them, recognised certain telltale signs in Greyback's appearance that made him suggest that Greyback should be kept in detention until the next full moon, which was, coincidentally, one day away. The ignorant and foolish committee members thought it unnecessary, and Greyback started taunting Lupin, who grew angry and described werewolves as "
   <i key="0e551af4-097f-4034-ab1c-f8a5028ff8e8">
    soulless, evil, deserving of nothing but death
   </i>
   ".
  </p>
  <p key="2aa6bb9d-0054-4c57-a257-c07fd7d63b23">
   Lupin was ordered out of the room, the head of the committee apologised to Greyback, and the werewolf was released. Before the wizard who was escorting him out of the inquiry could cast a
   Memory Charm
   on the "Muggle tramp" so that he would forget having been at the Ministry, Greyback overpowered him and fled with three other werewolf accomplices. As soon as he escaped, he started planning his revenge on the wizard who said he deserved nothing but death.

Lyall reached the bedroom in time to save his son and to drive the werewolf out of the house using a number of powerful curses. The deed, however, was done, and Remus Lupin became a full-fledged werewolf from that point on.

   With the Dark Lord gone, and with him, the false promises of granting werewolves a place of high honour and privilege in the regime he intended to establish following his victory in the war,  the notorious
   Lycanthrope
   continued to attack witches and wizards on his own initiative, especially children. During this time, he had many run-ins with the
   Werewolf Capture Unit
   from the Ministry's
   Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures
   , and while they would manage to capture him on several occasions, they could never hold him for very long before he escaped and was at large once again. One of the werewolf hunters from the Ministry he would frequently be confronted by was a wizard named
   Cecil Lee

   Shortly afterwards, Greyback and his two werewolf companions encountered

   Before Greyback could better coordinate the assault on and hence overwhelm the young pupil, however, he caught the scent of

The headmaster briefly examined the injured student on the ground and instructed the other one to return to their dormitory while he attended to Chiara, explaining that he would contact the Ministry of Magic and ask them to send an expert from the
   Werewolf Capture Unit
   to help to stop Greyback.

   The next full moon, Greyback and his army attacked Hogwarts again. This time, they encountered Jacob's sibling and
   Cecil Lee
   , whom the Ministry had sent on Dumbledore's behest. During the confrontation, Cecil tried to use the
   Homorphus Charm
   on Greyback's werewolf companions, but, as he was out of range, it failed. While Cecil was surrounded by the two other werewolves, Greyback transformed. Chiara, in werewolf form, arrived and attacked Fenrir in an attempt to protect Jacob's sibling, but the larger and much stronger werewolf easily knocked her unconscious. After this, Jacob's sibling successfully held him at bay by some swift-spell-casting. Having fended off the two werewolves attacking him, who had retreated to Grayback's side, Cecil swiftly stepped forward and conjured ropes from the end of his wand to restrain the pack leader. Having captured the three werewolves, Cecil agreed not to capture Chiara due to her heroic actions.

   or when he was too wary to approach Bellatrix after she brought him to his knees violently. He was well aware of the lack of respect he received from the Death Eaters, and that the Ministry would have claimed all the glory had they brought Harry Potter to them instead of directly to Voldemort.

  <p key="8d79fd9d-c9ec-4dc7-ab0b-69ed256bd43d">
   Unlike most werewolves, Greyback took both pleasure in and advantage of his abilities and savagery when transformed, and stationed himself near his targets. He enjoyed attacking them and specialised in biting children, hoping to infect them and raise them to hate humanity, though sometimes killing them when going overboard. Despite his ideology of thinking werewolves deserve blood, and his attempt to recruit more werewolves for his cause, Greyback would ultimately seem to be just a primal savage who enjoyed killing. Greyback's savagery was what differed him from most other werewolves: while most of them bit and infected unintentionally during only their transformed state, Greyback actually went as far as eat and kill purposely whether in his human or werewolf form. Greyback was feared more than most werewolves due to his brutality, even Dumbledore was shocked that Draco Malfoy allowed Greyback to enter Hogwarts, and was slightly disgusted after learning about Greyback's cannibalism.
  </p>
  <p key="cc88c827-24d3-4a84-be49-7957eb530595">
   Being a werewolf and therefore not subscribing to the Death Eaters' views on racial superiority, Greyback was not branded with the
   Dark Mark
   , despite being invited into the ranks of the

   </a>
   and permitted to wear their robes.
   This may have been because Lord Voldemort was prejudiced against Werewolves as well as Muggles and Muggle-borns. Therefore he would not allow Greyback to become an actual Death Eater, yet he was too valuable of an accomplice not to have in his ranks. Greyback showed clear resentment at the lack of respect he received but sided with the Death Eaters because of the amount of victims he would have access to. Most Death Eaters seemed to regard him with disgust, with Yaxley throwing a
   <a href="Curse.html" key="f23f3e6b-34cb-4a83-b218-cbc9ecdc32bc" title="Curse">
    curse
   </a>
   at him in the Astronomy Tower for attacking without permission and Bellatrix Lestrange forcing him to his knees before her in Malfoy Manor. The revulsion that the other Death Eaters felt towards Greyback was likely because of his lycanthropy as well as his implied sexual perversions. Despite his resentment and mistreatment, he usually only mildly protested about the Death Eater's behaviour towards him, possibly out of fear for their power and what they would do to him if he stopped cooperating with them. Indeed, it is very likely that if Voldemort had won the Second Wizarding War, he would have tossed Fenrir aside once he was no longer useful, because Voldemort detested werewolves.
   Fenrir has also proven he had a low tolerance for insults and holds grudges, as he took vengeance on
   Lyall Lupin

   For his lack of loyalty to the Dark Lord, Greyback never went to seek him out after his first defeat, instead returning to his own mission of infecting as many as he could, and then returning when Voldemort came back to full strength, once again for the promise of more victims.

    While it's unknown what happens to Fenrir after the Battle at Hogwarts, there is a slight chance that he managed to escape back to his pack (although unlikely, as Ron and Neville are described as "bringing him down" shortly before the death of Voldemort, most likely either killing or Stunning him).

One of which is they're both "mindless" beasts covered in hair and with sharp claws that follow an intelligent leader who believes that humans must be eliminated because they are weak. Another similarity being their incredibly homicidal, sadistic, and psychopathic natures and how both are also torturers and sexual predators in addition. In fact, Sabertooth's design in the film
