   Dolores Umbridge was the first child of a

   named
   Ellen Cracknell
   . Her younger
   brother
   was a
   Squib
   , but Dolores was a witch. Under her father's influence, she despised her Muggle mother and her Squib brother, considering them inferior to her and her father, and Dolores and her father denounced them. Before Dolores reached 15 years old, Ellen and her son returned to the Muggle world, never to be heard of again.

   At some point, she obtained

   birch
   and
   dragon heartstring
   with an unusually short length of only eight inches. According to

   , abnormally short wands usually selected those whose moral character was stunted, rather than because they were physically short.

   She did not have a good relationship with Slughorn, who considered her to be an "idiotic woman" who he "never liked".
   She was also never given any position of power (i.e.

   ) during her studies, which made her feel deprived, and she never truly enjoyed her time as a student at Hogwarts.

   After leaving Hogwarts, Umbridge quickly rose to influential positions in the
   British Ministry of Magic
   . She started her political career as an intern in the
   Improper Use of Magic Office
   . Before reaching age 30, she became the Head of the Office, evidence of her ruthless tactics under her sweet attitude, which also involved taking credit for other people's work. This set up the beginning of her dubious career as a Ministry employee, one who tyrannised her subordinates while flattering her equals and her superiors.

   Dolores, being very opportunistic and power-hungry, was ashamed of her father, who was a low-level worker in the
   Department of Magical Maintenance
   , while she was seeking a professional career. Under her pressure, he retired early and she promised him a small monthly allowance in exchange for quietly leaving the public sight. From that point on she lied about her family, claiming that she was a
   <a href="Pure-blood.html" key="5ac52317-2423-4f34-a246-6251e41656b8" title="Pure-blood">

   rather than a half-blood. She eventually became
   Senior Undersecretary
   to the
   Minister for Magic
   and had a place in the

   .
  </p>
  <p key="bb38cc16-7419-43bc-88f5-b357c17d2982">
   Whenever she was asked (usually by workmates who did not like her) 'are you related to that Umbridge who used to mop the floors here?', she would smile her sweetest, laugh, and deny any connection, claiming that her deceased father had been a distinguished member of the Wizengamot.

   Throughout her career, Dolores tried to garner affections of one of her superiors in order to advance her status and security, with no particular desire on which superior it would be, as long as he would be a powerful husband. However, while they valued her hard work and ambition, those who got to know her best found it very difficult to like her very much. Indeed, when she got intoxicated from a glass of sweet
   sherry
   , Dolores was prone to spout very uncharitable views, which shocked even those of anti-Muggle ideologies with some of her suggestions, behind closed doors, of the treatment that the non-magical community deserved. As such, Dolores never succeeded in getting

   During the 1990–1991 school year, Dolores entered

   in the
   All-Purpose Room
   , which was becoming quite crowded.
   Later that year, she visited
   Hogsmeade

   Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop
   , she got attacked by
   a rogue wampus cat
   . The cat's
   hypnosis
   caused her to forget the incident, only remembering the fall. Jacob's sibling later found her at
   Hogsmeade station
   covered with scars because of the attack. When she was questioned by them, they came to the conclusion she was indeed attacked by a Wampus cat. But when they told Dolores this, she got angry and didn't believe them because they were a "child".

   Umbridge's hatred towards "

   anti-werewolf legislation
   in
   1993
   , which made it nearly impossible for
   werewolves
   , such as
   Remus Lupin
   , to find work.
   This act also made it easier for Lord Voldemort to recruit werewolves to his cause, preying on their treatment by the Ministry. In
   1994
   , she also campaigned that the
   Merpeople
   be rounded up and tagged, though this idea was scrapped due to it being too ludicrous to be put into effect.

   In
   1995

   professor, by order of the Ministry of Magic, under the terms of
   Educational Decree Number Twenty-Two
   , without Albus Dumbledore's consent. Her placement was to limit the learning of
   martial magic
   and allow the Ministry to monitor the activities at Hogwarts.
   The Minister did this because of an unfounded fear that Dumbledore was trying to upturn his position as the Minister and was also afraid that Dumbledore was using the students as a means of overthrowing the Ministry.
  </p>
  <p key="85b4945e-d47e-4607-b9b2-ac057056b9f3">
   Moreover, Umbridge admitted that she was not fond of children, even expressing hatred for them, as she once confessed to Harry Potter.
   Having been denied any position of power and responsibility during her time as a student, Umbridge saw this return to school as a golden opportunity to wield power over those who had not (as she saw it) given her her due.
   During the Start-of Term Feast she gave a despairingly dull speech that
   <a href="Hermione Granger.html" key="2a70af65-1bba-402d-b65c-6267500743a6" title="Hermione Granger">
    Hermione Granger

    Ministry
    is interfering at Hogwarts

   ". The start of her speech began when she rudely interrupted Dumbledore with a cough, and she insulted the students by speaking to them condescendingly as though they were five-year old children.
  </p>
  <p key="6c5c1d86-4c25-414c-b3e3-f4347a601917">
   She essentially stated that progress in Defence Against the Dark Arts was going to be limited, but none of the students (aside from Hermione) were able to comprehend her dull speech and simply wandered off into their own discussions, while Umbridge ignorantly continued. Her rudeness and subliminal speech led many teachers to scorn her, as none except Dumbledore bowed back to her when she paused to bow at the staff. Upon finishing, she received very scattered and unenthusiastic applause, as most students lost track of her speech altogether, and the teachers barely clapped once or twice before stopping, showing their low regard for Umbridge. However,

  </p>
  <p key="12c590a1-9612-47ec-9cdf-eea9058b35ab">
   She taught according to a politically restricted Ministry-approved curriculum. This curriculum entailed learning strictly the
   theory of Defence Against the Dark Arts
   , with no practical applications. Umbridge taught exclusively from a simplistic book:
   <i key="c619c62b-3a2a-4677-afa8-0d94535b3db9">
    Defensive Magical Theory
   </i>
   , by
   Wilbert Slinkhard
   , which seemed, based on the chapter headings, to concern itself with negotiation and appeasement of, rather than actual defence against, the Dark Arts. By teaching basic defensive theory as opposed to real spells that would prepare her students for the outside world, she and the Ministry hoped to decrease the chance that Dumbledore could form a wizard army of students to overthrow the Ministry.
  </p>
  <p key="c7783306-a696-4c4e-af4c-bfc83af12333">
   Dolores proved to be ineffective as an educator. She had no teaching background and had trouble maintaining the class's attention. Because of these shortcomings she ordered her students to simply read from the book during class, denied them the rights to ask questions, and sat back behind her desk to simply observe.
  </p>
  <p key="6deff5e7-0a28-4e94-b0e3-b9a23d4540b6">
   Most students were concerned and felt they would be left defenceless against the
   Dark Arts
   , since the book was useless, and even if Voldemort was indeed dead and gone there were plenty of other dangerous things in the world to defend against. Some spoke out openly in class, such as:

   Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three
   increased Umbridge's power and influence in Hogwarts. She was appointed the first-ever "
   Hogwarts High Inquisitor

   To combat Umbridge's repressive stance of not teaching practical defensive magic, Harry formed a group to teach practical Defence Against the Dark Arts. However, Umbridge, learning that the group was created and afraid that the students would soon start to rebel against her, soon
   abolished all student groups of three or more members
   , meaning that students were not allowed to be seen together in a group whose members numbered three or more, or they would be suspected of rule breaking. This also included

   This included doing things that made her work harder, like bursting out of blackboards, pushing over statues, toppling neatly stacked piles of parchment into fires, and following Umbridge around for hours, blowing raspberries every time she spoke. Umbridge had previously asked Cornelius Fudge to sign an order for the
   expulsion of Peeves
   , but if any such order was ever signed, it was clearly unsuccessful at his removal, since it was impossible to kick him out of Hogwarts. Umbridge was also forced to rule as Headmistress from the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor's

  <p key="a2c444fb-a016-4c33-87dc-97e131ff8df5">
   Most likely due to her mother being a Muggle and father being a source of embarrassment, Umbridge used the locket to emphasise her wizarding ancestry, to make herself seem more appealing to the new regime by distracting attention from her

   Dolores Umbridge was described to be a short squat woman resembling a large pale toad. She had a broad, flabby face, a wide, slack mouth, and little neck. Her eyes were bulging and pouchy, and in her mousy brown hair she often wore a black velvet bow, which reminded Harry of a fly perched dangerously above a
   toad
   , furthering Umbridge's toad-like characteristics.
  </p>
  <p key="c3449514-37f0-4015-9d47-62641647dff6">
   She spoke with a simpering high-pitched voice that was girlish and breathless, contrary to her appearance (Harry expected a croak) and decorated her office with kittens and other cute pink paraphernalia. Her wide toad-like smile and tendency to speak in a sugary voice that was often described as poisoned honey was a physical exemplification of her cruelty that was barely hidden by her seemingly harmless dress-style. Umbridge's thick stubby fingers were adorned with several gaudy old rings.
   She also was said to have a big chest, as noted by Harry Potter when he saw Slytherin's locket lying there.

   Umbridge was seen wearing various green tweed outfits, usually with a pink fuzzy cardigan on top, giving her greater toad-like qualities. The head-to-toe matching outfits, usually in shades of pink, were worn while she taught and during her duties as High Inquisitor. According to Harry, she looked like someone's maiden aunt, and that her style of dressing would fit someone half her age. During
   Harry's hearing regarding under-age magic
   , Umbridge wore the black robes of the

  <p key="4da6cc26-3058-434f-87da-9dad4ae9afea">
   Dolores Umbridge was an evil woman, who represented the very worst of political power. She was extremely ruthless, cruel, callous, brutal, corrupt, sadistic, arrogant, intolerant, power-hungry and devoid of any kind of moral or ethical centre. She was apathetic and absolutist, yet also a committed and flexible witch who was dogmatically supportive of the
   British Ministry of Magic
   , eagerly obeying the every command of
   <a href="Cornelius Fudge.html" key="3bc757bf-3aa1-46c3-9268-de795f98658c" title="Cornelius Fudge">
    Cornelius Fudge
   </a>
   ,
   Rufus Scrimgeour
   and
   Pius Thicknesse
   when in their respective terms of power, in order to gain power herself. She was even willing to go to Hogwarts for Fudge, in spite of her bad memories there and strong dislike of children. She was depicted using any means to maintain the political power of her bosses, often flaunting the power she in turn obtained during her time in Hogwarts. She committed attempted soul-removal (via the Dementor attack on Harry), solicited bribes, and tortured children to achieve her goals. Her draconian ideals of discipline, such as having victims write lines in their own blood using a
   Black Quill
   , which carves the words into the back of the writer's hand, were considered by Harry and Ron to be "sick".
   Although Umbridge saw such deeds as doing what was necessary, they ultimately amounted to a form of "the ends justify the means".
  </p>
  <p key="5f154609-96fd-4c23-b679-deb6bacf06f7">
   Her fanatical loyalty clouded her judgement and caused her to place a blind faith in authority, believing that it could not possibly be wrong, and even after it was proven wrong she did not change her opinion, as was clearly seen when she was loyal to Fudge over Dumbledore, rather than accepting the truth, and then abandoning Fudge when he was ousted from his office. However, as he was out of the picture, she was flexible enough to turn her loyalty towards Scrimgeour, proving she was more loyal to the cause than its leader and therefore continued to show the authorities her unbreakable devotion. However, when Fudge gave her power, it inflated her sense of self-importance and instilled a sense of ruthlessness, making her seek to exercise complete control over everyone and everything around her.
   Even as a student, she was resentful that the school did not grant her any position of power and responsibility, and felt that she was deprived of a chance to exercise authority over her peers.
  </p>
  <p key="a5cf548c-2ddc-419b-9de0-269f62365ea0">
   Umbridge's strictness bordered on the ideal representation of the qualities of a totalitarian government. From her perspective, free speech, dissent, diversity and multiple points of view could not be tolerated. She led not by consensus and respect, but rather by fear and intimidation; as the year progressed, she grew more independent of Fudge's will by beginning to use her own available resources in order to make people obey her, even attempting to use the restricted

   Her cruelty was disguised by her quiet, childish, high-pitched voice (which both took Harry aback and made the hair on his neck stand up straight, as he had childishly expected a croak), as well by decorating her office with paraphernalia related to

   Hence her kitten decorations, Umbridge wanted a pet cat, but she doubted she was responsible enough to actually care for real ones, and so maintained her focus on decorations.
   Her personality was described as being similar to "
   poisoned
   honey
   ," and it was said on various occasions that the sweeter her voice was, the more dangerous or infuriated she was.

   For unknown reasons, but most likely because of the Ministry's beliefs, Umbridge was fanatically prejudiced against part-humans (such as werewolves and half-giants), which she called "
   half-breeds
   ". It was her prejudice that caused her to pass a series of anti-
   werewolf
   legislation, which made it almost illegal for those afflicted with
   lycanthropy
   to hold jobs. Her prejudice also led to her mistakenly believe that mermaids and centaurs were part-humans, when in fact they were separate species, and in her haste of prosecuting them she would forgo her usual feigned politeness, and be outright rude. However, after the incident with the Hogwarts centaurs, she developed a phobia of centaurs. An odd derivative from this prejudice was that, despite her hatred of half-breeds, Umbridge did not seem to hate
   part-goblin

   Umbridge was a
   pure-blood supremacist
   , a belief stemming from her childhood when her brother was discovered to be a Squib. Hating her mother for being a Muggle, Dolores would blame her for being the cause of her brother's lack of magical powers. After bribing her father to quietly leave public sight, Dolores lied to everyone that she was a pure-blood, believing it would give her social respect and status, later bolstering her credentials by falsely claiming that she was related to the
   Selwyn family
   (albeit controlled by Voldemort's
   Horcrux
   locket
   ).
   She was known to spout very uncharitable views on the non-magical community when intoxicated, to the point that even fellow pro-pure-blood coworkers were shocked by her. While sober, Dolores would put up a facade of politeness for Muggle-borns, repressing her prejudice for them to maintain her public image; only when Voldemort took over the Ministry did she unleash her cruelty over them, tormenting them with sham trials and sadistically sending them off to Azkaban.
  </p>
  <p key="708f6611-5890-4ba8-a649-f7bcce67782d">
   Her lust for power and social status turned her against her own family, though it is unknown how they treated her and if she had planned to do so. Despising her Muggle mother and Squib brother as second class citizens while ashamed of her lowly janitorial employee of a father, Dolores would never speak of any of them again while shunning her father with a bribe, and went onto inventing her ancestry to make herself seem more noble to the higher ups. Dolores also attempted to seduce her superiors into marriage, not out of
   love
   , but for the social elevation and security it would provide, though she was always turned down as her obsession turned off any co-workers she flirted with. Her power-hungry nature was evident even as a child, as she came to despise her time as a student at Hogwarts because she was not given any power of authority, and upon returning as a Ministry-implanted teacher, she saw it as an opportunity to get what she thought was wrongly denied in her youth, heavily flaunting all the titles and power that Fudge granted her.
  </p>
  <p key="36754712-6ab4-44f3-916e-fbf54dab81c9">
   Umbridge was known to rapidly resort to cruel and unusual punishments over perceived slights and take great pleasure in such punishments.
   Umbridge also liked to showcase her statuses to anyone who would listen, as she arrogantly told the centaurs in the Forbidden Forest of her many titles,
   and mounted plaques on her office doors to display these titles.
   Unaware that she was in possession of
   Salazar Slytherin's Locket
   , she falsely claimed it was a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the
   Selwyn family
   .

  <p key="8c6e75e4-ca1c-4507-9503-83adb7b74af2">
   Despite her confidence bordering on arrogance, Umbridge knew she could not do Cornelius Fudge's will at Hogwarts without help, and so enlisted

   Inquisitorial Squad
   .
  </p>
  <p key="4db5e00e-b827-4b3a-babd-5fcfa7f1b8cc">
   She showed a particular hatred for Harry Potter, as she had no qualms about violently punishing Harry during detentions (though it is possible Fudge told her to be harsh on him). During her year as a professor at Hogwarts, she acted as a disciplinarian, insisting the students to greet her loudly and clearly in a monotonous style at the beginning of every class, and answer her questions in the same manner.
  </p>
  <p key="cb7cbaac-3ca5-4316-8304-642fbf89db4c">
   Despite (or perhaps because of) her feigned politeness, the other teachers found her extremely infuriating and obnoxious. Umbridge became more openly authoritative and cruel as she gained influence over the school, especially during her time as the
   High Inquisitor
   , as seen when she interrupted teachers with her leading questions, passive-aggressive comments, and disruptive note taking. She was especially insulting to Hagrid, whom she knew to be a "half-breed," and was blatantly condescending and rude to him during her inspection of his class. She interrupted Dumbledore during his speech at the
   Start-of-Term Feast
   , and delivered a very dull speech while being ignorant of the students' restlessness, to the point that Harry angrily speculated that she would have continued with it even if a full-scale riot broke out under her nose.
  </p>
  <p key="6161756b-ea69-4366-a68c-1f7cd34f7ce3">
   There were several signs indicating that Umbridge was impatient and had a short temper. However, she rarely expressed the extent of her anger openly, casually enforcing decrees written and signed by Fudge and handing out torturous punishments with a smile (most notably, forcing Harry to carve "I must not tell lies" into the back of his hand with a Black Quill) rather than openly taking out her hatred of children on the school as a whole. However, Umbridge's anger occasionally reached the surface when she did not feel things were as they should be, such as when Fred and George Weasley began a rebellion against her during her time as Headmistress, she had very little patience for the twins' antics. When
   <a href="Marietta Edgecombe.html" key="262dceb8-500a-4833-a3f5-f0dd3e23d2bc" title="Marietta Edgecombe">

   's memories were secretly modified by
   Kingsley Shacklebolt
   and she did not tell the truth about
   Dumbledore's Army

    Dumbledore

   pointed his wand at her. She also had a tantrum when the gargoyle of the
   Headmaster's office
   refused to let her in when she became Headmistress, and an outburst against "half-breeds" led her to be carried away by centaurs in the Forbidden Forest.
  </p>
  <p key="ec7e55d4-fbeb-4178-961d-5cd7131ba0f2">
   Umbridge often made hypocritical statements, claiming during the Start-of-Term Feast that she assured the students that they would all be very good friends, she admitted later that she actually hated children, showing she had sacrificed a lot to do Fudge's bidding. Despite claiming to be a "tolerant woman", she frequently attempted to silence those with whom she disagreed. Her hatred of both "half-breeds" and "
   Mudbloods
   " demonstrated her intolerance, while her constantly shifting attachment to the currently most powerful showed her opportunism. Despite her incessant claims that telling lies was wrong, she was perfectly willing to lie herself, evidently without shame for it.
  </p>
  <p key="6baeae7d-cbd7-48cf-a77e-2c2f508fa5ae">
   Her style of teaching students was also simply having them read from the textbook, while avoiding any practical lessons and answering students' questions, though she was simply following Fudge's orders on how to change Hogwarts. Indeed, Umbridge enforced his belief that theories were enough for students to get by exams and mastering self-defence, which in many situations proved both of them wrong, though she refused to acknowledge that fact. It is unclear if she ever agreed with it or if she merely had to keep her mouth shut as her opinions were of little consequence compared to the Minister of Magic. Because of her lazy and ineffective methods, Umbridge was a thoroughly incompetent teacher with no ability or experience in the teaching of children, something which

  <p key="a6159962-cae5-4ed4-bfdd-86945a4ef0b0">
   Despite her wickedness and pure-blood supremacist attitude, Umbridge was repeatedly stated to be no
   Death Eater
   , as she never showed support for them until they took over the Ministry in 1997. She was fearful in response to the
   Azkaban breakout
   in 1996 and was determined to capture
   Sirius Black
   who was, at the time, believed to be a Death Eater.
   Despite this, she was not above allying with them if it suited her interests. Once they took over she allied with them due to sharing many beliefs with them, as well as being given further power within the Ministry.
   It is also possible that she allied with them out of fear of being targeted as a high ranking Ministry official, but given her sadistic enjoyment in persecuting Muggle-borns for the
   Muggle-Born Registration Commission
   , it appears that Umbridge allied with the Death Eaters willingly and freely, given how their ideology and cruelty was extremely similar to hers, along with the power they granted her, which allowed to carry out her wicked actions on the

   's knowledge of the school's geography, and made efforts to befriend him in order to advantage herself, despite his status as a Squib, which many would consider a sign of a second-class citizen in the wizard community. However, she was not above blaming him for her own faults, to the point of irrationality, such as when she
   stunned
   one of the
   Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs
   causing it to explode, she called him out not to stun them despite his genetic inability to do so in the first place.
  </p>
  <p key="c78243f5-721b-4658-9cc3-79ce4c6f586b">
   Umbridge also had an unhealthy habit of drinking a small cup of tea with three spoonfuls of
   sugar
   , which could have contributed to her gaining weight, and thus in all likelihood she had possessed the habit for a long time.
  </p>
  <p key="6beda573-c2c7-4b3e-85d2-4682ed57be0e">
   The time Umbridge spent wearing Voldemort's locket highly exacerbated her nasty qualities, as demonstrated with her sadistic and ruthless persecution of defenceless Muggle-borns, along with her dishonesty regarding her blood status. However, as it was never exactly clear how much influence the locket had on her mind, it may not be fair to judge her entirely for her actions with it on. For instance, her dislike of Muggle-borns increased into base cruelty, tormenting them with sham trials and sadistically sending them off to Azkaban. Her lack of control over her own mind is evidenced by the fact that she had no idea what she was wearing and so falsely claimed it was a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the
   Selwyn family
   , showing her extreme arrogance to the point of utter delusion.

   power and knowledge were mainly focused in offensive and defensive magic, particularly of a darker variety. In fact, her rise through the Ministry ranks were more to her abilities to pander to her superiors while taking credit for other people's efforts and tyrannising her inferiors, rather than any genuine magical talents.

   .

   Under the influence of her father, Dolores blamed her mother for being the cause to her brother being born without magical powers, as well as looking down on said brother. Coupled with Ellen's flightiness and untidiness, Dolores came to hate both her mother and brother. She considered them to be inferior and upon reaching 15 years old, she and her father remained in the wizarding world, while Ellen took her son and returned to the Muggle world, never seeing each other again.

   Although her father was the source of influence on her prejudiced views on blood purity, Dolores found him rather irksome for his unambitious nature as a janitorial worker at the bottom of the social ladder. While climbing the ranks in the Ministry herself, Dolores found her father to be a source of embarrassment, and pressured him into an early retirement, disappearing from public sight in exchange for the promise of a small monthly allowance. With her father silently removed from public, Dolores managed to give herself a better public image. Whenever her colleagues (mostly the ones who disliked her) asked if she was related to the Umbridge who used to mop floors, she would use her sweetest smile (which indicates her suppressed rage) to deny all connections, and falsely claimed that her deceased father was an esteemed member of the Wizengamot. Nasty things tended to happen to people who asked about Orford, or anything else Dolores did not want to talk about, so people who wished to be on her good side would pretend to believe her false heritage. Once Dolores was arrested and sentenced to Azkaban, Orford lost his pittance that his daughter gave him.

  <p key="9f10de68-35bc-46bc-b9d7-24ad39270bf7">
   Ambitious and prejudiced, Dolores was utterly disgusted with all three of her family members, having no love for any of them, dismissing them and severing all ties with them due to their low birth and/or poor social statuses, and never again speaking about any of them.
   She then lied to others being a pure-blood, seeing herself as such, and even falsely connecting herself to the prestigious

   Cruciatus Curse
   to get Harry to talk before Hermione intervened and, together with Harry, tricked Umbridge into going into the Forest to show her "Dumbledore's weapon". This resulted in Umbridge being carried off by the centaurs, whom she had attacked first, due to her hatred of half-breeds.

   After the Ministry had finally acknowledged Voldemort's return to power, Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts. However, Harry was furious to learn later that year that Umbridge was still working for the Ministry of Magic. The next year Lord Voldemort took over the Ministry. Umbridge showed her respect for Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters by taking part in the hunt for Harry Potter. She branded Harry as "Undesirable No.1,"  and was given the job of Head of the
   Muggle-Born Registration Commission
   . This was a job that involved sadistically sentencing innocent Muggle-borns to Azkaban on the false charge of stealing magic. Harry learned that Umbridge had one of Voldemort's Horcruxes and
   Mad Eye Moody's magical eye
   in her possession. During the
   Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic
   , Harry saw Umbridge ruthlessly interrogating a poor Muggle-born. Enraged, Harry stunned Umbridge and retrieved the Horcrux. He also took the eye from her office and buried it.

   Fudge seemed to be unaware of Umbridge's dark and sadistic nature. In return, Umbridge was loyal to Fudge only because of the power he was offering her, and felt no true attachments to the misguided man. She was also willing to break the law behind the Minister's back to achieve results, such as summoning
   Dementors
   in an attempt to expel Harry, as well as attempting to use the illegal
   Cruciatus Curse
   for interrogation, all the while stating that "

   " Umbridge was always an opportunist seeking for power and status, and when Cornelius was succumbing to paranoia in 1995, she took full advantage by stoking the Minister's vanity and fears, feigning sympathy for his anxiety in order to use him for promotions. When Fudge was dismissed, Umbridge stood beside the new Ministers instead, even when it became apparent that the new regime established in 1997 was morally corrupt (which actually fell in line with her true personality).

   Head of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission

   During her earlier years, she attempted to charm her superiors for a marriage, in order to raise her status and power, but, while they valued her hard work and ambitions, they knew her enough that they found her very difficult to like and refused to have any affectionate relationship with her. Some of her coworkers who dislike her tend to ask her if she is related to
   the Umbridge
   who used to mop floors at the Ministry, which she took offensively before denying it, and caused some nasty events to happen to such people, thus leading to those who wished to remain on her good side to believe her invented ancestry. After the Ministry was reformed under

   's guidance, Umbridge was arrested, tried and imprisoned for her crimes against Muggle-borns, as not all the Muggle-borns she sent to Azkaban survived their imprisonment during the Second Wizarding War.

   The only Slytherin who did not support Dolores Umbridge during her tenure at Hogwarts was the
   Head of Slytherin House
   himself, Severus Snape. Like Harry, Snape hated Umbridge from the moment he set eyes on her for taking the post of
   <a href="Defence Against the Dark Arts.html" key="3f13873d-f5a6-4ae2-b918-0941208fe582" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">

   teacher. Like his colleagues, he did as little to help her as possible due to seeing her as the spoiled child she was. Because of this, Snape was the only one who could ignore Umbridge's insults and endure her tantrums. He was, however, not above subtle taunting as shown when he merely raised an eyebrow after she told him he was on probation or when he pointed out the foolishness in her use of the entire bottle of

  <p key="69a65fee-bb16-4887-8ea3-5647d146215a">
   Umbridge in turn seemed to enjoy bullying Snape over the fact that Dumbledore always refused him the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, which Snape found to be infuriating, and barely hid his rage. She was also annoyed with his lack of support for her and accused him of being "deliberately unhelpful". In general Umbridge seemed to expect more support from Snape, due to
   Lucius Malfoy
   speaking highly of him to her.

   In an
   alternate reality
   in which Voldemort won the war and Umbridge became the official Headmistress of Hogwarts, she kept Snape as a teacher of the school. Umbridge claimed that she knew of Snape's true allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix for years, but did not act on it at the time; it was only when Severus assisted
   Scorpius Malfoy
   in defying Voldemort did Umbridge expressed her regret of not dealing with Snape before. In short, it seems Umbridge kept Snape around for his teaching capabilities while disregarding his loyalty as something that could not bring harm to the new regime until he made an open move. Snape, in turn, had no qualms in blasting Umbridge back when she confronted them.

   During her time as a student, Umbridge never truly enjoyed her time at Hogwarts, and being denied any position of power (i.e. Prefect, Head Girl) made her resent the establishment.

She would constantly interrupt teachers, such as Dumbledore during his welcoming speech, with her high-pitched girlish cough of "

However, Dumbledore could not do anything about her due to her being appointed by the Ministry, and school life was made infinitely more difficult — for students and staff alike — by her presence.

This also turned even more of the students and staff against her. In fact, the school itself appeared to deny her authority, sealing the Headmaster's office against her. In addition, Umbridge liked to intimidate

   Umbridge always had a prejudiced view on those who were part-humans. She used the derogatory term "

   centaurs
   ,
   merpeople
   , and
   werewolves
   , as she either mistook them to be human-animal hybrids or simply found their appearances of being partially human revolting. Regardless of her definition of "half-breeds", she was extremely cruel to them, writing an
   anti-werewolf legislation
   so they could barely find employment, and campaigning for merpeople to be rounded up and tagged, the latter which was never followed through due to the sheer ridiculousness.

    "Umbridge" is a pun on the English "umbrage" meaning "offence" or "insult", indicates that Dolores Umbridge is destined to do only harm and cause only unhappiness. It also symbolises how she is offended by any challenge to her limited world-view and her secretive nature. "Umbrage", which came from the Middle French "ombrage" and ultimately from the Latin "umbra" is a word whose meaning has evolved over time. Originally, "Umbrage" meant "shadow" or "shade", then it evolved to refer to "that which provides shadow or shade", then took on the meaning "semblance" or "suspicion", and eventually to "the suspicion that one has been slighted" and its present meaning.

    Margaret Thatcher
    . Thatcher, similar to Umbridge, was minister for education, and made many changes that the public disagreed with (though ironically, she was the one to ban the cane in British schools), and was also known for her soft approach when addressing the public, but was also known for being radical, harsh and in some cases extreme with her policies and methods in running the country during her tenure. In the film adaptations, her hairstyle also bears a resemblance to that of Thatcher.

    Much of her tyrannical rise to power was shown, as she wanted to cast a Cruciatus Curse on Harry, an Unforgivable Curse. It is unknown how much the spell would be painful to Harry, but, when taking into consideration her nature, the spell would be almost as powerful as Bellatrix Lestrange's Cruciatus Curse.

    . Both of them were implied to have lonely pre-Hogwarts lives and they felt overshadowed by their family and resented that the school did not grant them any position of power and responsibility. Both of them were loyal to the
    Ministry of Magic
    and had a father that worked there; both of their fathers were of low rank (janitor and
    Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office
    , respectively), which they were both implied (in both cases without any cemented evidence) to be insecure about. They both wore
    Slytherin's Locket
    , which exacerbated their worst traits such as selfishness and selective loyalty. But the difference is that, as
    Sirius Black
    once cited, Umbridge's darker traits took over her mind, while Ron chose to turn over a fresh leaf and eventually got the position of power he wanted, choosing to act on the light in him.

    Once, long ago, I took instruction in a certain skill or subject (I am being vague as vague can be, for reasons that are about to become obvious), and in doing so, came into contact with a teacher or instructor whom I disliked intensely on sight.

    The woman in question returned my antipathy with interest. Why we took against each other so instantly, heartily and (on my side, at least) irrationally, I honestly cannot say. What sticks in my mind is her pronounced taste for twee accessories. I particularly recall a tiny little plastic bow slide, pale lemon in colour that she wore in her short curly hair. I used to stare at that little slide, which would have been appropriate to a girl of three, as though it was some kind of repellant physical growth. She was quite a stocky woman, and not in the first flush of youth, and her tendency to wear frills where (I felt) frills had no business to be, and to carry undersized handbags, again as though they had been borrowed from a child's dressing-up box, jarred, I felt, with a personality that I found the reverse of sweet, innocent, and ingenuous.

    I am always a little wary when talking about these kinds of sources of inspiration, because it is infuriating to hear yourself misinterpreted in ways that can cause other people a great deal of hurt. This woman was NOT 'the real Dolores Umbridge'. She did not look like a toad, she was never sadistic or vicious to me or anyone else, and I never heard her express a single view in common with Umbridge (indeed, I never knew her well enough to know much about her views or preferences, which makes my dislike of her even less justifiable). However, it is true to say that I borrowed from her, then grossly exaggerated, a taste for the sickly sweet and girlish in dress, and it was that tiny little pale lemon plastic bow that I was remembering when I perched the fly-like ornament on Dolores Umbridge's head.

    I have noticed more than once in life that a taste for the ineffably twee can go hand-in-hand with a distinctly uncharitable outlook on the world. I once shared an office with a woman who had covered the wall space behind her desk with pictures of fluffy kitties; she was the most bigoted, spiteful champion of the death penalty with whom it has ever been my misfortune to share a kettle. A love of all things saccharine often seems present where there is a lack of real warmth or charity.

    So Dolores, who is one of the characters for whom I feel purest dislike, became an amalgam of traits taken from these, and a variety of sources. Her desire to control, to punish and to inflict pain, all in the name of law and order, are, I think, every bit as reprehensible as Lord Voldemort's unvarnished espousal of evil.

    Umbridge's names were carefully chosen. 'Dolores' means sorrow, something she undoubtedly inflicts on all around her. 'Umbridge' is a play on 'umbrage' from the British expression 'to take umbrage', meaning offence. Dolores is offended by any challenge to her limited world-view; I felt her surname conveyed the pettiness and rigidity of her character. It is harder to explain 'Jane'; it simply felt rather smug and neat between her other two names.
