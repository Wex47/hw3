   Forbidden Forest

The sisters were very happy to be together again, and Penny said they spent much time outside after Beatrice was trapped for so long and thanked them. If Penny was at the vault, Jacob's sibling also praised her courage. They discussed Beatrice's ordeal, with Penny and Jacob's sibling reassuring her. Penny expressed her pain in being torn apart from her sister, before catching herself and apologising, remembering what happened with Jacob. When Beatrice expressed fear over a professor turning out to be evil and Penny tried to reassure her, Jacob's sibling was reminded of Merula, prompting them to leave to visit her.

However, she would not stop them if Jacob's sibling encouraged her to use the love potion; Penny would watch in shock as the scheme went wrong and Barnaby became infatuated with Jacob's sibling instead, and lead Barnaby away to get an antidote. If Jacob's sibling convinced Ismelda not to use the love potion, Penny would say she made the right choice, and leave to dispose of the love potion-infused sandwich.

Penny wanted to talk about Beatrice; she met with Jacob's sibling at the Three Broomsticks, clearly saddened. While hesitant, with some coaxing, she told Jacob's sibling that Beatrice spent the summer sulking, trying to act older than she was, and becoming distant from her. Beatrice had been avoiding Penny and hanging out with a new crowd. Jacob's sibling promised to talk to Beatrice.

Jacob's sibling attempted to excuse themself, but was stopped by both sisters. They continued to bicker with Jacob's sibling trapped between the saddened and worried Penny and the angry and rebellious Beatrice. Despite Jacob's sibling asking them not to, they are forced to take a side. Regardless of their choice, they could not stop the argument from escalating until Beatrice yelled at Penny that she wished she was not her sister and that she would "disappear", before storming out of the room, leaving Penny and Jacob's sibling shocked.

Jacob's sibling changed the subject back; they met Cedric and Penny said he was "cool", talked about among Hufflepuffs, and modest. If Jacob's sibling chose to welcome Cedric, Penny would say she knew they would get along; if they chose to challenge him, they would insult his 'perfect but humble' image as an attention-seeking act, which would start a brief argument with Penny, but in both cases they were interrupted by Sickleworth running by.

   After a DADA tutoring session, Bill asked Jacob's sibling, Ben, Merula, and either Penny or Charlie to stay behind to discuss the Cursed Vaults (depending on who was picked to enter the Buried Vault). If Penny did not visit the Buried Vault, she would still want to stay but relented when Bill said it is best only talked about between those who had been there. If Penny stayed, she would be told along with the others about Bill thinking the last vault is underwater and they should research where exactly it could be, and also stop Ben and Merula fighting. When Jacob's sibling and Beatrice snuck out to the
   Great Lake
   , Beatrice asked them whether they would tell Penny. She would be angry or relieved, but either way, she did not want to talk about Penny further.

   When Beatrice and Jacob's sibling met Jae at detention, Jae was surprised at how "Penny's little sister" looked so different. During detention, Beatrice said Penny would never get into detention. After they finished working, Penny came into the kitchens to give Jacob's sibling a message, and was shocked to see Beatrice there. Depending on their previous choice, either Jae let slip what Jacob's sibling and Beatrice were up to and their encounter with the
   Wizard in white robes

Penny revealed she told what she knew about 'R' and their threat to Rowan, which made the latter resolve to protect Jacob's sibling and thus followed them into the forest, and Penny blamed herself for Rowan's death.

   Penny seemed to have a particularly hard time deal with her grief, not helped by Beatrice still refusing to talk to her. When the rest of their friends decided to go to Hogsmeade, Penny wanted to stay back with Beatrice but the latter told her to go. Beatrice said she wanted to help at the Hospital Wing and Penny should be with her friends; Penny was surprised at and appreciative of her empathy and maturity. Beatrice said she did not need Penny and asked Penny to take care of herself, expressed sympathy to Penny over her friend's death, and then burst into sobs; Penny pulled her into a big hug.

   Beatrice, who was not in the group, was found with Ismelda and Merula talking about the issue. Jacob's sibling may choose to tell Penny of her involvement, or not. Ismelda and Merula were against letting Penny know, but Penny walked in, having learned where Beatrice was from Cedric. Penny said losing Rowan made her realise how easily she could lose someone. She apologised to Beatrice for not understanding her and pleaded her not to push her away this time. Ismelda made a slightly snide comment about Penny being weepy, but Beatrice defended her, and said she wanted Penny to stay.

   Penny had blue eyes, pale white skin and long blonde hair with two thick braids over her shoulders, and a braid on her left side that formed a ponytail, giving her a half up. She often styled her hair differently for special occasions, including a crown braid for

   Penny adorned different garments to special occasions (including her white and yellow

   Hogwarts uniform

   Nymphadora Tonks
   and
   Chiara Lobosca
   , who almost never wore the school robes outside of school. Similarly, although she would eventually gift Jacob's sibling with a potion belt when they became very close friends, she was never seen wearing it, unlike Chiara's necklace or

   Penny was sociable, approachable, and pleasant; regarded as the most popular girl in her year while attending Hogwarts.

   Talbott Winger
   , who were both considered outcasts, showing that despite her popularity, she was still humble, decent and treated others very respectfully.

   Emily Tyler
   , who called Penny "too nice"; Emily's popularity depended largely on her bullying and teasing of students she didn't like, and others only hung out with her so she wouldn't bully them. Other Hufflepuffs in her year liked Penny a lot and even said that if someone was Penny's friend, they are their friend. Some of them pretended to do poorly at
   Herbology
   just so that Penny would help them.
  </p>
  <p key="48175ca2-5cb8-421c-b614-542782f185bd">
   Apart from her incredible popularity and kindness, Penny was also very intelligent and
   magically
   gifted, as proven by her talents in potion-making, which was rivalled by very few of her fellow students, and was also competent with charm-work. While sweet-natured, she could also be a fierce and fearless protector of her friends and especially her younger sister she dearly
   loved
   .

  <p key="f9d37b2b-2de2-47bc-b824-918551f14d90">
   She was an avid fan of Quidditch, especially
   Wigtown Wanderers
   , her adopted hometown team, to the point that she would paint her face to the same house colour as
   Skye Parkin
   , the new Quidditch Chaser from the fabled Parkin Family. Although she would never use
   Felix Felicis
   to cheat, she liked to recite the potion's ingredients as her way of wishing for luck, and ate
   horseradish
   for a week before a big Quidditch match because it was one of them.
   In sharp contrast to her usually pacifistic demeanour, Penny was an advocate of rough play in Quidditch, to the point Jacob's sibling described her as "bloodthirsty".
  </p>
  <p key="3fc7fd18-718c-40e9-af62-fcfcf365ee6b">
   A classic Hufflepuff, Penny was dedicated, loyal, and hardworking; however, she did exhibit darker aspects of her personality. She reacted very poorly to
   Merula Snyde
   stealing her credit, was sometimes prone to reckless potion-taking in stress or grief, and she could be stubborn and resistant to change. Her strong attachment to those close to her could cause her to be overprotective, excessively dedicated to the detriment of herself, or becoming an emotional wreck from loss.
  </p>
  <p key="b823edba-80eb-47b8-bb5c-27aedbebe682">
   Penny could be talkative and gossipy, occasionally saying things she did not mean to. She let slip about
   Andre's
   grandmother being ill, and told Jacob's sibling they don't understand how she felt about Beatrice being trapped in a painting, despite their brother having been missing for years. However, she almost immediately realised that it was insensitive and apologised. While usually one to revel in the spotlight, she did occasionally feel the social pressure of her popularity and could be insecure about how she looked.
  </p>
  <p key="18b8cb5b-842a-4695-a25d-d34664c1331c">
   In her earlier years, she found it exciting that Jacob's sibling would invite her to dangerous adventures while others only invite her to parties; the tragic murders of two of her close friends and her sister's imprisonment and subsequent falling out affected her deeply. She suffered from chronic nightmares, and dipped into depression and occasional fearfulness (possibly exhibiting symptoms of
   ). Despite all this, with the help of her friends, her good nature always ultimately pulled through.
