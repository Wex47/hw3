   It took skill, practice, and patience for wizards and witches to become Animagi. The process of becoming an Animagus was long and arduous, and had the potential to backfire and cause the transformation to go horribly wrong. Many witches and wizards simply felt that their time might better be employed in other ways, as the skill was of limited practical use unless one had a great need of disguise or concealment.
  </p>
  <p key="ae9a038a-de44-45f5-9654-816f73656157">
   Part of the process by which one became an Animagus was holding the
   leaf
   of a
   Mandrake
   in their mouth for an entire month, using the leaf for the creation of a potion, reciting an incantation (

   and drinking the
   Animagus potion

   The process was extremely difficult and could result in disaster (such as permanent half-human, half-animal mutations) if done incorrectly. A witch or wizard had to keep a single mandrake leaf in their mouth for an entire month (from full moon to full moon). If the leaf was removed or swallowed, the witch or wizard would have to start over again. At the next visible full moon (if the night happened to be cloudy, one would have to start over) the wizard had to spit the leaf in a phial within range of the moon's pure rays. To the moon-struck phial, the wizard or witch must add one of their own hairs, a silver teaspoon of dew that had not seen sunlight or been touched by human feet for seven days, and the chrysalis of a
   Death's-head Hawk Moth
   . The mixture had to then be put in a quiet, dark place, and could not be in any way disturbed.

   The next thing that had to happen was for the wizard to wait for an electrical storm, whenever that might be. During this waiting period the wizard would have to, at sunrise and sundown without fail, chant the incantation

   had markings on their Animagus forms caused by their spectacles. If an Animagus underwent a major physical change, such as the loss of a limb, their animal form would reflect that, as in the case of Peter Pettigrew missing a finger, and his rat form missing a toe.

   and the Animagus transformation ability was that an Animagus could change into an animal whenever they want, without a wand or an incantation. Being an Animagus was an ability, and Transfiguring required a spell. An Animagus would still think as a human does when they were in their animal form, seeing as Rita Skeeter was able to eavesdrop on others' conversations when she was in the form of a

   was caused by a blood infection transmitted through being bitten by another werewolf, whereas the Animagus skill was learned. The werewolves could not keep their minds after a transformation (unless they took the
   Wolfsbane Potion
   ), nor could they control themselves when they transformed, while Animagi could do both. However, as werewolves only harmed humans, Animagi, while in their animal forms, were safe to be in the company of werewolves. They could actually help calm them down and make the transformations easier, as demonstrated with the
   Marauders
   : three of them transformed to help the fourth, who was inflicted with such a curse.

      Interestingly, the first four known Animagi prior to the registration system all took the form of birds (Falco Aesalon, Morrigan, Morgan le Fay and Cliodna). The two known registered Animagi both become cats (Minerva McGonagall and an unknown witch).

    Given an Animagus form is determined by the wizard's personality, it's unknown if the culture the wizard lives in has any influence. Some animals are attributed with different traits in various cultures. For example, Mongolian culture has historically revered wolves, attributing them as the ultimate hunters who can only die by human hand if the wolf consents to death as wolves are considered to be inherently superior to mankind. In other cultures, wolves are vilified and treated as cowardly, blood thirsty, and loathsome beasts.

    In Latin, the female form of Magus is Maga. However, in canon, female Animagi are never referred to as "Animaga" or "Animagae", which would be the female plural.
