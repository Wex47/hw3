   ,
   by

   she was a performer at the
   Circus Arcanus
   where she met
   Credence Barebone
   and had the ability then to transform at will. By
   1994
   , Nagini was seemingly trapped in snake form and belonged to

   Horcrux

   After Voldemort's initial downfall, he used
   Nagini's venom
   as one of the ingredients for a
   Potion
   to regain strength, which eventually led to his
   rebirth
   in
   1995
   . Later in the same year, she attacked
   Arthur Weasley
   but he managed to survive. During the
   Second Wizarding War
   , she had to be destroyed for Voldemort to finally be defeated. Nagini was killed by

   Originally, Nagini was a female
   human
   Maledictus
   , with the ability to transform into a
   snake
   . By
   1927
   , she was a featured attraction in a

   circus
   owned by
   Skender
   (who claimed to have found her in the 'jungles of Indonesia). At some point she befriended
   Obscurial
   Credence Barebone
   , who travelled to Europe with the circus after surviving
   MACUSA's
   attempt to destroy him in
   New York
   , after he
   attacked
   the city in
   December
   1926

  <p key="b3d6eaa8-db4d-4353-b78a-784ce69f0412">
   In
   September
   1927
   , Nagini and Credence decided to escape from the
   Circus Arcanus
   and discover his real identity.
   Amid her performance and transformation into a snake, Credence released
   firedrakes
   , so she attacked Skender to run away with Obscurial.
  </p>
  <p key="54c68eff-aad5-4f61-ba46-1ce64f566a4d">
   After that, she and Credence went to
   18 Rue Philippe Lorand
   to find who they hoped would be his biological family. They instead found
   Irma Dugard
   , a
   half-elf
   , who fondly explained some details of the alleged baby and parents. Unbeknownst to Credence and Nagini, they were followed by one of
   Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes
   ,
   Gunnar Grimmson
   . As the half-elf was about to divulge a key piece of the story, Nagini was suddenly trapped by Grimmson in a wall while he murdered Irma. Grimmson disapparated before Credence's

    Obscurus

   could kill him, Nagini tried but failed to escape her locked position inside of the wall until after the event concluded.
  </p>
  <p key="5ddc21db-d52b-4398-99ce-2faae73b9904">
   Later, on the rooftop of the house near the
   Eiffel Tower
   , Nagini and Credence met
   Gellert Grindelwald
   who was calling his supporters. He gave them a map of
   Pere Lachaise cemetery

   . While she remained either aloof or outright malevolent towards most others, she obeyed Voldemort completely and seemed to enjoy being close to him, as she often slithered up to the Dark Lord's shoulders to receive his affection. Nagini was also shown to be very intelligent, and was able to understand the concept of strategies and plans, as seen when she set up a trap for

   (which may have been due to her possessing a portion of Voldemort's soul, or maintaining her human sentience). She was rather cunning and deceptive, and understood how humans behaved (likely owing to Nagini having once been human herself). Possessing a strong bond with Voldemort, Nagini alone did not fear his wrathful moments, as he never punished her for failures nor took it out on her when misfortune struck him.

   Voldemort had a special relationship with Nagini, as she was his pet and one of his Horcruxes. According to Dumbledore, Voldemort had strong feelings for Nagini that he had not for anyone else; she was the one living thing that he had ever cared about.
   He was able to communicate with Nagini as a
   Parselmouth
   , and he turned her into a Horcrux in 1994, after he murdered
   Bertha Jorkins
   , which accounted for the unusual amount of control that he had over her. By 1997, and likely before then, he was able to communicate with her silently and across great distances, as she was able to signal to him when Harry Potter arrived at Godric's Hollow. This may have been due to her nature as a Horcrux, which gave her a link to Voldemort like the one Harry possessed.
  </p>
  <p key="efeaf9aa-7456-473e-bb6f-7c2350057552">
   Voldemort was also able to possess Nagini, which he did in December 1995, during the attack on Arthur Weasley. In 1994, Peter Pettigrew milked Nagini's venom to return Voldemort to a rudimentary body, and as a Horcrux, her very existence contributed to maintaining Voldemort's immortality. While Voldemort was known for his independence that makes him unable to feel any form of attachment or reliance to others, the affection he held for Nagini (and that she underlines his heritage to Salazar Slytherin) was the main reason he chose to make her into a container for his soul fragment in the first place; of course, holding a place in keeping her master alive made Nagini only increased her value to Voldemort's eyes. Voldemort usually sent her on missions, such as infiltrating the Ministry or holding Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow. He allowed her to consume the corpses of those he killed as a reward, like that of Charity Burbage, though this also served as a way for him to dispose of bodies. Voldemort apologised to Nagini when he could not feed Pettigrew to her, as Pettigrew's failure of keeping
   Crouch Snr
   was rectified, and therefore, allowed him to escape the death penalty and not become Nagini's meal. Unlike many of his subordinates, Voldemort did not punish Nagini for failures, as when she failed to retrieve the prophecy or let Harry Potter escape from her grasp. In turn, Nagini did not fear Voldemort's wrathful moments, as when even high-ranking Death Eaters such as Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange fled the area when Voldemort was savagely murdering goblins for reporting his one of his Horcruxes being taken, Nagini remained next to her lord.
  </p>
  <p key="c5576c25-8aa9-4adf-9945-c798e45564ea">
   Voldemort stopped sending Nagini on missions after he realised that Harry knew about the existence of his Horcruxes and was tracking them down, and placed her within a
   barrier
   to keep both her and his soul fragment safe, so long as he believed she was under the threat of being killed by Harry. Voldemort was enraged when Nagini was beheaded by Neville Longbottom with Godric Gryffindor's Sword, and he attempted to kill him in retaliation. Nagini was the last Horcrux to be destroyed, and her death led to Voldemort's final defeat and death.

   Nagini was aloof and indifferent to the Death Eaters as a whole, but sometimes could be irritated by them, as she hissed angrily at their loud laughter at the Malfoy manor which none of them took notice until Voldemort ordered their silence for her sake.
   She allowed Peter Pettigrew to milk the venom out of her fangs in order for it to be used for their master,
   but otherwise would have been glad to devour any Death Eater that her master permitted, as a form of punishment for their failure; Pettigrew, Dolohov and Rowle were threatened to become Nagini's meal in lieu of torture.
   Under Voldemort's order, Nagini ruthlessly bit Snape in a fatal location, dealing him a slow, painful demise.
   Because of this, along with that she held more favour from their master than any of them did, many of the Death Eaters were terrified of Nagini for her deadly and ruthless behaviour.

   Nagini was frequently used by Voldemort to kill others or to dispose of their dead bodies. In 1995, he promised Nagini that she could devour Harry Potter after he had killed him.
   However, she was denied this when Harry escaped from the graveyard shortly after the promise was made.
   It was likely that

   During the meeting at Malfoy Manor, she consumed the body of

    Nagini seems highly intelligent as a snake during the Second Wizarding War. Whether she retained her human intelligence and sense of self, or was possessed by the portion of Voldemort's soul in the
    Horcrux

    Tom Riddle's diary

    , Albus Dumbledore believed that Nagini may have been made into a Horcrux through the murder of an "old Muggle man", most likely referring to
    Frank Bryce
    . However, J. K. Rowling said in an interview that the murder that Voldemort used to make Nagini into a Horcrux was
    Bertha Jorkins

    Nagini's history with Voldemort is difficult to piece together. It is unknown whether Voldemort owned Nagini before his fall in
    1981
    , or if he had found her during his exile in
    Albania
    . However, it was stated that in the woods of Albania, the phantom-like form that was the remnants of Voldemort had possessed many animals, yet only snakes could bear having him inhabit them, thus leading to the notion that Voldemort and Nagini's relationship had originally commenced in Albania.

      As she had the name of Nagini before she permanently became a snake, it is possible that Voldemort met or acquired her before her permanent transformation, or found out her name through
      Parseltongue

    Nagini was killed by Neville using Gryffindor's Sword, which was an object that could destroy Horcruxes because it had been impregnated with
    Basilisk venom
    in
    1993
    . It was unknown if living Horcruxes could be destroyed by anything that cannot destroy an inanimate Horcrux; however, it was likely, because the Horcrux inside Harry was destroyed by Voldemort by using the Killing Curse. Nevertheless, it was still possible that living Horcruxes could not be destroyed by anything that would not destroy an inanimate Horcrux considering that the Killing Curse was a one-of-a-kind unblockable instant death spell. As a living container of a piece of Lord Voldemort's soul, it was unknown what would happen if she could have died naturally.

   <li key="8b5957be-3ba1-43bc-999e-83753132bbd9">
    The killing of Nagini was very representative of the houses Gryffindor and Slytherin. The sword was originally Godric Gryffindor's, and Nagini was a snake, Salazar Slytherin's symbol, who was owned by a descendent of the Slytherin Family Line.

     Basilisk
    </a>
    were both giant snakes who served Voldemort, and both were killed with Gryffindor's Sword when someone pulled it out of the Sorting Hat. Also, both their deaths contributed to Voldemort becoming mortal (as the Basilisk fangs were used to destroy two Horcruxes and the venom absorbed by Godric Gryffindor's Sword allowed the destruction of three more). Also, the Basilisk was related to the first appearance of a Horcrux in the series, while Nagini was the last Horcrux.

   <li key="0716d3be-d969-40d7-8f76-9f5b8cee2b85">
    Nagini was usually sent on missions on Voldemort's behalf, and made her rather vulnerable, which was against the general purpose of a Horcrux: to protect the portion of the soul. Nagini shared this trait with
    The Diary Horcrux
    . However, it may be that Voldemort was sure that no one had discovered his Horcrux secrets and, as only a few things could destroy Horcruxes, he was fairly sure that both Nagini and the diary would be safe. However, it could have been that the primary purpose of creating these two items was not so much to provide for Voldemort's immortality, but rather to use the other properties of a Horcrux to create unique weapons. Dumbledore believed this to be the case for the diary.

   , Nagini was not protected by the magical orb, but instead by what appeared to be an invisible force field that deflected all spells cast at her. This allowed her to participate in the second stage of the battle, as opposed to dying before it began, where she attempted to strike Harry from the back while Voldemort duelled him from the front. Ultimately, she was fighting against Hermione and Ron, both of whom tried to stab her with a Basilisk fang, before Neville decapitated her. Upon her death, she vanished into black smoke, as opposed to simply dying and falling onto the ground in the novel. Why her body perished was not known, and she was the only Horcrux to disappear in such manner; all the others did not disappear, but instead left behind fragmented pieces, except the Diadem when Ron kicked the remnants into the oncoming
   Fiendfyre
   . Also, Nagini was killed while Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort were duelling, when in the book, Neville Longbottom killed Nagini while Voldemort and his Death Eaters were standing outside the
   Entrance Hall
   . Furthermore, Voldemort's and Snape's final meeting occurs in the
   Boathouse
   in the film, as opposed to the
   Shrieking Shack
   in the novel, and thus Nagini murders Snape there instead of on her master's orders.
