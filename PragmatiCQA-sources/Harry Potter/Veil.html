   was an enigmatic structure located in the
   Department of Mysteries
   . It seemed to be a manifestation of the barrier between the land of the living and the land of the dead. One could not travel freely between the two worlds, as it was a one-way trip. The
   Unspeakables
   who worked in the Department of Mysteries likely studied it closely.

   A physical manifestation of the barrier was somehow kept in the
   Ministry of Magic
   's
   Department of Mysteries
   ; in the
   Death Chamber
   , a room large and echoing, dimly lit and rectangular, and kept in the centre of a raised stone dais in a sunken, great stone pit some twenty feet deep, with benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre (or like the
   <a href="Wizengamot.html" key="8ffea687-8f91-42df-bd95-1e1678c5b0bd" title="Wizengamot">

   ) and surrounded by a cold air and complete stillness.
  </p>
  <p key="3f679077-d20f-4e4e-bb7b-dc5705f348e0">
   On the dais stood the Veil, which was represented as a tall stone pointed archway that looked so ancient, cracked and crumbling that it seemed amazing that it was still standing (especially as it was not supported by any surrounding wall), and the archway was hung with the Veil; which appeared as a tattered black curtain, gently fluttering and swaying very slightly "as though it had just been touched" (perhaps due to the souls of the dying passing unseen into the next life through it). Communication through the Veil appeared to be impossible, though when a living person approached it, the souls of the dead, recognising a loved one nearby, would try to communicate.
  </p>
  <p key="8d9af855-2119-496b-a211-fd61ac27279f">
   Though the living could have the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the Veil on the other side of the archway, their words were inaudible except for "
   <i key="2f851829-f22d-4f2e-b035-ce7a6d766314">
    faint whispering and murmuring noises
   </i>
   " coming from the other side of the Veil. When the living person tried to communicate, the dead would try harder and their whispering and murmuring would become louder. If those who heard the whispering stared at the archway long enough, they would shortly become entranced and mesmerised by it, believing it had a kind of beauty about it (old though it was), unknowingly walking towards it, intrigued by the gently rippling Veil, and feeling a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it.
  </p>
  <p key="8f2164c7-fb37-44f4-bdab-356bc6936e06">
   However, this would prove fatal, as passing through the Veil would cause instant death. The Veil reacted to the passage of a living person by fluttering for a moment "as though in a high wind," then falling back into place. It was impossible for others to pull whoever passed through out without passing through and dying themselves, and it was already too late for those passing through to be saved (despite only a few seconds passing), as they were already dead.

   travelled to the Ministry in

She was scared of the Veil and considered it unnatural. Even though she did not have any idea what it was, she felt that it was dangerous. Her advice proved difficult to follow as Harry, Luna, Ginny, and Neville were all entranced by the Veil (presumably because they all believed more or less in some type of afterlife, while it was implied that Hermione did not), with Harry and Luna hearing the voices of their deceased loved ones from beyond.

    The Veil is a reference to an English phrase, "

    When Harry and Luna approach the arch claiming to hear voices, Hermione exclaims that it is just an empty archway; although the Veil can be clearly seen by the viewers, and, presumably, by Luna and Harry. This could reference the similar way in which

    In the sixth book, it is stated that Dumbledore's funeral is the first Harry Potter ever attended. It is explained that no funeral was ever held for Sirius Black because his body was never recovered. This presumably indicates that the body left the world of the living entirely when it fell through the veil.

    After the seventh book was released, a fan asked J. K. Rowling if Harry talked with Albus Dumbledore somewhere in the Veil, to which Rowling clarified that rather than the Veil, the place of their conversation was

   <li key="917fd7f0-47ad-44d4-bd75-acdfaf15cdd2">
    J. K. Rowling has said that the reactions of Harry and his friends to the veil vary about how much belief or doubt they had about what lies beyond. Additionally, she has stated that the Veil has been there as long as the
    Ministry of Magic
    itself.
