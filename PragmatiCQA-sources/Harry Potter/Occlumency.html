   , involved clearing one's mind — making it "blank and empty" — in order to prevent a Legilimens from perceiving one's emotions and thoughts. More advanced Occlumency involved suppressing only the thoughts, emotions, and memories that would contradict whatever it was an Occlumens wished a
   Legilimens
   to believe, producing a "faux" layer of mentality that could totally throw off the perspective of one who used Legilimency into thinking that the said layer being the legitimate one whilst its bona fide counterpart lay deeper within; hence, it was not obvious that Occlumency was being used even if the person was lying. It required a great deal of willpower, as with resisting the
   Imperius Curse
   , as well as a high degree of mental and emotional discipline. It was also one method of resisting the influence of

Harry was not able to repel most attacks, though it is likely that the personal enmity between him and Snape as well as the stressful events in his life that year hindered his ability; while Snape was not teaching in an encouraging way, Harry's climbing interests in Voldemort's repeated attempts at the
   Hall of Prophecy
   made him further neglect his practice of the skill.

   After the
   Battle of the Department of Mysteries

   lightning-bolt scar
   and also dreams of what Voldemort was doing.
   However, by
   1997
   to
   1998
   , Voldemort started losing control due to repeated failures of his Death Eaters infuriating him more and more, and the reported losses of his
   Horcruxes
   became a tipping point where he forgot to close his mind, allowing the thoughts to be seen by Harry as he mentally organised his Horcrux hiding locations.

   a secret. Draco became skilled enough to repel Snape's attempts at Legilimency.
   Draco's success was due to him shutting out his compassion to become the bully he is, making it easy for him to close his mind.
   Despite this, Dumbledore did not confront Draco earlier regarding the assassination attempts due to fearing Voldemort would use Legilimency on Draco to discover it, suggesting that Voldemort's Legilimency is able to overpower Draco's Occlumency.

But he's also very in touch with his feelings about what's happened to him. He's not repressed, he's quite honest about facing them, and he couldn't suppress them, he couldn't suppress these memories. But I thought of Draco as someone who is very capable of compartmentalising his life and his emotions, and always has done. So he's shut down his pity, enabling him to bully effectively. He's shut down compassion — how else would you become a

    Harry Potter briefly used Occlumency against Voldemort, although he has never been able to master it. Also of note, while Harry's use of Occlumency in the books was negligible, he was nigh-effortlessly able to throw-off the

    As Dumbledore was not suspicious when Barty Crouch Jnr used Occlumency when disguised as
