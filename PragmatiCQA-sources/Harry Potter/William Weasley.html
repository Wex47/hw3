   During the same school year, Bill learned that
   Jacob's sibling
   had been involved in their own search for the
   Cursed Vaults
   , leading to them entering a locked room on the fifth floor along with some fellow first-years containing
   cursed ice
   , which, as word spread quickly at Hogwarts, soon became common knowledge among the students.

   By his fourth year, Bill had become very popular among the other students and was regarded by many, including
   <a href="Rowan Khanna.html" key="2e173e26-85db-4e96-a8dc-5b053066f428" title="Rowan Khanna">
    Rowan Khanna
   </a>
   , as one of the bravest and most gifted students of his year. Usually found practising defensive spells in the
   Training Grounds
   , he was approached by Jacob's sibling, who asked him for help investigating the Cursed Vaults.
  </p>
  <p key="6851c89a-b83a-4929-8432-b6aaed2f9e15">
   To this, Bill heartily agreed, voicing the opinion that the cursed ice that had begun to spread throughout the school because someone had been meddling with one or more of said vaults, after all, were posing a threat to the entire school and he would gladly do whatever he could to help resolve the dire situation, expressing excitement at the prospect of his first "
   <i key="5b39c071-55e1-4783-a79f-15e91310d023">
    curse-breaking adventure
   </i>
   ".
  </p>
  <p key="3d904362-ebdf-481f-85b5-623cbde98af9">
   In preparation for entering the vault, Bill taught Jacob's sibling the
   <a href="Fire-Making Spell.html" key="6e31be97-ac2c-4d84-9e4a-a5880d5b10d6" title="Fire-Making Spell">
    Fire-Making Spell
   </a>
   , practised duelling and studied all known information about the vaults, including reviewing the old articles concerning Jacob and his expulsion. After these things were taken care of, Bill met up with the younger student to enter the vault, insisted that he was excited to finally have an opportunity to act as a Curse-Breaker as opposed to merely talking about becoming one.
  </p>
  <p key="bd7d2fc7-0b46-47c6-bbfc-ae826e3d67bd">
   Once they entered the ice-covered outer hall leading into the vault itself, Bill marvelled at the complexity of magic required to build such a place. Finding their path blocked by massive blocks of cursed ice reaching all the way up to the high, arching ceiling. The pair had to get past these obstacles, which Jacob's sibling speculated might be additional defences put in place to prevent people from reaching the vault, by working together to melt them down with flames from their wands. Once they reached the door, however, Bill, mindful of the details he had received of what happened to Rowan, insisted they would have to "
   <i key="926a98c5-26ea-4833-ab5b-380ae0e6f94c">
    attack the door before it had a chance to attack them
   </i>
   ".
  </p>
  <p key="676641ae-6847-4e46-8234-13baca50d9b9">
   Trying to force their way through the door the same way they had done to break through the cursed ice, Bill was caught off guard when it countered the flames and shot a jet of icy light at him without warning, encasing him in a block of cursed ice and restraining his arms and feet. Jacob's sibling was concerned that they might accidentally hurt Bill if they tried to melt the ice surrounding him. First meaning to run for help, the aforementioned individual finally made their best effort to carefully cast the Fire-Making Spell on the ice, freeing him. Bill informed them of how, while he had suffered no physical injury, it felt as if the cursed ice had somehow drained him of energy, and Jacob's sibling agreed it would be best to leave.
  </p>
  <p key="e722ab75-54fe-478a-9351-4c487eb06fcf">
   Although he spent some time recovering from his injuries at the
   Hospital Wing
   , Bill was quick to dismiss the concerns of Jacob's sibling, telling them how he had never felt as alive before as when the two had tried to break into the vault, eager to give it another try, though wisely suggesting they brought some more people into their second attempt, to which Jacob's sibling voiced their intention of enlisting the aid of Rowan,
