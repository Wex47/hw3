  </h3>
  <p key="5654ee06-5700-4d3e-8bea-15f353d365c4">
   Isolt Sayre was born around
   1603
   . Her father nicknamed her "Morrigan" after
   his ancestor
   because of her "affinity of all natural things". Growing up in
   Coomloughra
   ,
   County Kerry
   ,
   Ireland
   , Isolt had an idyllic childhood, well-loved by her parents and the surrounding
   <a href="Non-magic people.html" key="dd48176f-49d0-444b-b807-456e8e23e84a" title="Non-magic people">
    Muggle
   </a>
   community, for whom her parents would secretly produce
   magical cures
   .
  </p>
  <p key="62f26f73-d60e-4730-aaa2-0f6e7c2158b4">
   However, around
   1608
   when Sayre was five years old, her family's cottage was attacked and set on
   fire
   . In the ensuing destruction, both of Sayre's parents were tragically killed; however Sayre herself was apparently rescued from the burning house by her mother's estranged sister,
   Gormlaith Gaunt
   . This incident marked the beginning of a harsh existence that Isolt would have to endure for many years to come. Gaunt took Sayre to the neighbouring valley of
   Coomcallee
   , where she raised her, using powerful
   Dark Magic
   to enforce her cooperation and isolation.
  </p>
  <p key="32b3c0ea-71c2-4929-9edd-c30b20578ad3">
   Gaunt proved to be an unstable and cruel guardian. A
   pure-blood supremacist
   , she believed that her sister's willingness to help Muggles would lead to what she believed to be a "dangerous path" to marrying a Muggle man. As she grew older, Sayre realised that her aunt had kidnapped her and set her house ablaze, and was therefore her parents' murderer. Gaunt would make Sayre watch as she
   cursed
   or
   jinxed
   any Muggle or animal that got too close to her cottage. The village learned to keep their distance from the cottage, and the only outside contact Sayre would get with anyone but her aunt was when local village boys threw stones at her when she played in the garden.
  </p>
  <p key="6af0247d-5b01-4964-8abe-199c74b3a33b">
   When Sayre turned eleven around
   1614
   her
   Hogwarts acceptance letter
   arrived. However, her aunt refused to allow her to attend, or to obtain a wand, believing that teaching Sayre herself about
   magic
   would be better than risking sending her to a "dangerously egalitarian establishment full of
   Mudbloods
   ." Gaunt herself had attended Hogwarts where she was sorted into
   <a href="Slytherin.html" key="6e143f3b-59c3-442b-b07b-047007f4d063" title="Slytherin">
    Slytherin
   </a>
   , and told Sayre much about it, but largely denigrated it, lamenting that
   Salazar Slytherin
   's plans for the purity of
   <a href="Wizardkind.html" key="2d5e71a9-5b9f-4d12-8354-94af83c3607d" title="Wizardkind">
    wizardkind
   </a>
   had been unfulfilled. This, however, led Sayre, who had been isolated and mistreated by her aunt for years, to believe Hogwarts to be a sort of paradise and she spent much of her time as a teenager fantasising about it.
  </p>
  <h4 key="3504c4f7-6b55-4ec0-b667-ed99dfaf1cb1">

  </h4>
  <p key="69e41992-377e-4671-bb02-5d34547cf24a">
   Eventually, after twelve years with Gormlaith, Sayre finally worked up the courage, as well as learn enough about magic, to escape. She stole her aunt's wand, and left the cottage and fled the country. The only other object she took with her was a gold brooch in the shape of a
   Gordian Knot
   that had belonged to her mother. Fearing her aunt's prodigious tracking abilities and her subsequent punishment, Sayre fled to England, but soon her aunt was on her tail. Determined to hide from her cruel aunt, she cut off all her hair and, for five years, pretended to be a Muggle boy, taking on the name of "Elias Story" (an anagram of "Isolt Sayre"), all the while her aunt was attempting to track her. She then went aboard the
   <i key="7c4c66d1-e52f-4936-8027-8c2f67243051">
    Mayflower
   </i>
   in
   1620
   and sailed to
   North America
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b1f0f5ee-7b9e-43f5-b78a-b80944f29ea0">
   Sayre arrived in America as one of the earliest European settlers, most of them Muggles. Soon after arriving, Sayre left and moved to the surrounding mountains, leaving the Muggle settlers to assume that "Elias Story" was killed during the harsh winter among the others. Sayre left partly due to her belief that, despite moving to an entirely new continent, her wicked aunt would still somehow track her down. The other reason was that her voyage aboard the
   <i key="6978522b-f05d-46b1-97a9-deef8b17788b">
    Mayflower
   </i>
   led her to the conclusion that the Puritans there would be unlikely to accept her, as Sayre was a witch.
  </p>
  <p key="7c1efce1-ef09-44f9-a20b-7a4c440a4d95">
   After several weeks of living alone in the mountains in complete isolation, Sayre came across a
   Hidebehind
   about to disembowel a
   Pukwudgie
   . She cast a curse, making the Hidebehind flee. Unaware that Pukwudgies were rather dangerous to humans, Sayre carried him to her makeshift shelter and nursed him back to health. The Pukwudgie declared himself bound to her until he had the opportunity to repay his debt, but was greatly humiliated to be indebted to a young, vulnerable girl. Sayre handled the Pukwudgie's ingratitude and found him amusing and was glad of the company. Over time, however, a friendship formed between the two. Faithful to the beliefs of his race, the Pukwudgie refused to tell Sayre his real name, so she named him "
   William
   " after her deceased father.

   After becoming friends, William began introducing Isolt to various magical creatures he was familiar with. Various adventures and encounters they had together included a fight with a
   Snallygaster
   observing
   Hodags
   hunting, and watching newborn
   Wampus
   kittens playing in the morning. A
   great-horned river serpent
   lived in a nearby creek. Isolt was fascinated by it, and in turn the serpent was fond of her, to William's astonishment. Isolt also claimed to understand what the
   Horned Serpent
   was saying to her. Because this was alarming to William, she did not talk about her sense of kinship with the serpent, and that it seemed to tell her things. She visited the creek and never told William of it, and the beast always said the same thing:
   <i key="53497785-8609-43e6-b29e-99b8f107d6c4">
    Until I am part of your family, your family is doomed.
   </i>
   Isolt was unable to understand the meaning of the cryptic words that the serpent was saying, or if she was imagining the
   beast
   talking to her.

  <p key="e2654c8a-c33a-462b-bfa7-c9d4a70454a9">
   One day, while foraging in the woods, the two heard a grisly noise nearby. William shouted at Isolt to stay put and, poisoned arrow at the ready, charged through the trees towards the noise. Isolt ignored the directions and followed William to find that the
   Hidebehind
   who had attempted to kill William years ago had killed two naïve humans and was preparing to disembowel them, and two boys lay seriously injured nearby. Isolt and William worked together and "made short work of" the Hidebehind.

  <p key="dd26fb24-ca96-49f4-a179-5e2a3bb98b49">
   William continued to collect blackberries, ignoring the injured children. When Isolt angrily instructed him to help her carry the boys back to their shelter, he threw a tantrum. Isolt, outraged by his callousness and stubbornness, stated that she would accept assisting her in carrying the boys back as payment for being rescued. She insisted on carrying them home, as she was afraid that they were too ill to
   Apparate
   . William grudgingly agreed to carry the older boy, while Isolt carried the younger one, who were named
   Chadwick
   and
   Webster Boot
   respectively. As soon as they got back to the shelter, a furious Isolt told William that she no longer needed him and William glared at her and vanished.

   The boys that Isolt and William rescued survived the attack and, much to her delight and astonishment, were wizards. However, Chadwick and Webster were so ill for the next couple of weeks that Isolt hardly left them alone. She was troubled by the fact that, in her haste to rescue the boys, she had been unable to give their parents a burial, so when the boys were well enough to be left alone for a few hours, she returned to the forest with the intention of marking graves for their parents. To her surprise, she found someone there. As she watched, the man,
   James Steward
   , finished marking the graves she had intended to make herself, and picked up the two broken
   wands
   laid beside the corpses. She watched as he examined the
   dragon heartstring
   that protruded from the
   wand
   that belonged to the
   boys' father
   and waved it. The wand knocked James backwards and he hit a tree and was knocked unconscious.

  <p key="14253261-aec1-4d91-aa70-6373db9b2ac5">
   Isolt carried the unconscious man back to her shelter, where he eventually awoke. Isolt was unable to conceal her magic from James, especially in the confined space of her shelter and brewing potions to help the boys recover. She intended to
   Obliviate
   James once he recovered from his concussion, but until then she considered it nice to be able to talk to an adult, let alone one familiar with the Boot boys and he helped to entertain them while they healed. James also helped Isolt construct a stone house on the top of
   Mount Greylock
   by providing a workable design, and Isolt magically constructed it within an afternoon. Isolt named the new house "
   Ilvermorny
   " after her parents' house, which her aunt destroyed. Every day, Isolt vowed to Obliviate James, meanwhile James's fear of magic subsided, and they eventually admitted that they were in love with each other, and married.

   Europe
   , where they could receive their letters. Isolt, not wanting to frighten them, did not tell them of Gormlaith Gaunt, and instead promised to give them wands and open a magical school at their stone house. The family discussed what they should name the four houses after, and instead of Hogwarts founders, they named it after nearby magical animals: for Chadwick, the
   thunderbird
   ; for Webster, the wampus; for James, (after some debate) the Pukwudgie; and for Isolt, the Horned Serpent she still visited.

   At the time, Chadwick's eleventh birthday was near and Isolt had no idea how to provide him the wand she promised him, as she thought that her aunt's wand she stole was the only one in America. On the eve of his birthday, Isolt had a dream in which she went to the
   Horned Serpent
   's creek, who rose up from it and bowed it head, and Isolt shaved a long shard from its
   horn
   . She woke up and walked down to the creek. The serpent was waiting for her, and raised its head like it did in her dream, and Isolt shaved off part of its horn, thanked it, and returned to her cottage. She woke James, who had skill in crafting and stone-carving. They eventually finished crafting a wand of "exceptional" power.

   The Steward family had no idea that word of Ilvermorny had reached Gormlaith Gaunt, Isolt's aunt who she had managed to escaped from a year prior. When she learned of this, she made her way to America. Gormlaith vowed to kill Isolt and James, destroy the school building, and kidnap their daughters. As soon as she saw the house, she cast a
   sleeping curse
   on the couple, placing them into an enchanted slumber. Chadwick, having spotted Gormlaith outside, sent Webster to awaken James and Isolt. This was unsuccessful due to the powerful curse, so he went outside to help Chadwick duel Gormlaith. This was the only option, as they were the only ones awake.

   Due to the commotion, Martha and Rionach were woken up, and due to the power of love, their cries broke through the enchantment laid upon Isolt and James. Isolt woke up to the noise around her and screamed at James to go get their daughters, while she ran outside to assist her sons in
   duelling
   Gormlaith. Once she raised the stolen wand to attack, it did not, as Gormlaith had activated a hidden spell that would disable it. A gloating Gormlaith chased and drove the three back up the stairs, to the room where she could hear crying.

  <p key="6272c2f8-94f9-4cba-945c-d2e69014cb83">
   Isolt followed Gormlaith up to the room where James and their daughters were. Certain that "all was lost", Isolt, hardly thinking, cried out her father's name. There was a clatter as Isolt witnessed William the Pukwudgie appear and a
   poison
   -tipped
   arrow
   pierced Gormlaith in the heart, killing her. The family expressed their extreme gratitude. However, William was upset that it had taken Isolt ten years to say his name again. Isolt chose not to mention that she was actually calling for her late father. William later moved in with Isolt and her family at Ilvermorny.
