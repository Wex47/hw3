   Fred and George enjoyed making mischief from a young age, and were quite a handful for their parents. It was not uncommon for explosions to be heard coming from the bedroom the two shared. They also greatly enjoyed teasing their brothers Percy and Ron. At one point, they even used their family's pet
   Puffskein
   for
   Bludger
   practice.
   At the age of five, Fred
   <a href="Underage magic.html" key="20c6566f-5f56-4579-9cf3-fc5a68bfef56" title="Underage magic">

   Ron's

   into a giant spider, sparking his arachnophobia, after Ron broke his

   Acid Pop
   , which burnt a hole through his tongue.

   Montague

However, it is possible that he was unaware that the cabinet was broken and thought Montague would have stumbled out of another cabinet, too confused to remember to dock points from them, as he initially was planning to do. Fred could be quite callous in dealing with the victims of his pranks, particularly his older brother

   Another possible significance of the twins' names is that George III became king because of the early death of Frederick, Prince of Wales. George III was also deaf in one ear.
