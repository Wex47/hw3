   ,
   death

   Due to the highly classified nature of this department, it was granted a great deal of independence, being the only one within the entire Ministry that did not need to answer to the
   Department of Magical Law Enforcement
   .
   Even the
   Minister for Magic
   had very little authority over the department's operations, as the
   fifteenth Minister
   's attempt to shut down the branch was ignored by the Unspeakables.

   The Department of Mysteries lay on the second-lowest level of the
   Ministry of Magic
   , Level Nine. It was accessible via the lifts from the Ministry Atrium. This level bore a striking difference to those above: the black-tiled walls
   were bare with no windows and no doors, apart from a plain black one at the end of the corridor that led into the Department proper.
   Light was provided only by torches, which glowed with a blue-white light.
   A small flight of steps to the left led to Level Ten.

   Behind the black door was the Entrance Chamber, which was designed to disorient any unauthorised personnel who entered it. It was a circular room with a dark marble floor that looked almost like standing water, candles emitting a cool blue light, and twelve handleless doors. Whenever a door closed, the walls rotated, making it impossible to determine which door was which. This chamber would respond to a verbal request for an exit by the opening of the correct door.

   The Department of Mysteries was established sometime in or before the

   , actually predating the
   Ministry of Magic
   , which was only established in
   1707
   . It was in activity since at least
   1672
   , since there were records of intensive studies from this Department, dating as far back as that year, demonstrating that wizards and witches were born, not created.

   This was a dark room full of planets floating in mid-air. Presumably, it was from this Chamber where Wizards studied the aspect of space, as it was one of the limits of magic (along with time). Visitors could find themselves floating as well.
