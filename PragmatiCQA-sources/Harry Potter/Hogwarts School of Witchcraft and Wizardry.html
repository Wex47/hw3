   While war waged outside the ancient walls of the school and it remained safe from Dark Forces outside the castle, the existence of ancient threats hidden deep within it began to stir when a student by the name of
   Jacob
   became intrigued with and began to search for the fabled
   Cursed Vaults
   , five secret rooms of ambiguous origins somewhere within the castle said to house ancient magical treasures older even than the school itself.

  <p key="07313f74-4883-4171-b804-2b2d7bf086b9">
   Jacob grew increasingly obsessed with his quest to prove the existence of the Cursed Vaults throughout his school career and broke several school rules in his effort to locate them. The situation escalated further as when the pupil finally found it, he examined the outer chamber leading to the vault and, as a result of tampering with magic he did not understand, he inadvertently unleashed a curse that threatened to
   encase the entire castle in ice
   , injuring several students in the process.

  <p key="627816af-ea79-4f7a-b168-945742f556a4">
   By that point, Jacob's quests for the vaults were no secret. Rumours began spreading among the student body that he unleashed several curses upon the school, and even was cursed himself and that he eventually went mad. Ultimately, however, Jacob managed to break into the vault itself, causing the ice to vanish. Despite his part in ending the threat, however, he was found to have endangered the school, as he unleashed the threat in the first place. Jacob's resultant expulsion from Hogwarts was covered in the

   With the cursed ice gone from the halls of Hogwarts and his students once more safe from it, Dumbledore and the rest of the school staff did their best to dim the rumours that Jacob had actually located one of the vaults, treating it as an isolated incident that had more to do with Jacob's search for the Cursed Vaults rather than the vaults themselves. They hoped to discourage others from looking for them and maintain the common view that they were just a myth. This worked so effectively that while people still spoke of it a long time afterwards, no one, not even Jacob's
   own mother
   , believed that the Cursed Vaults actually existed.

   By the end of the 1970s, Lord Voldemort's ascendancy was almost complete. While the Ministry of Magic did their best to both put up a fight and keep wizardkind a secret, a true resistance to him was being concentrated in the underground organisation founded by Dumbledore himself called the

   There were normally four feasts per year: the start-of-term feast at the beginning of the school year, end-of-term feast at the end of the school year, and feasts at Hallowe'en and Christmas.
   Feasts were also called to mark special occasions, as was seen in the
   Goblet of Fire

   Classes would proceed normally and the next notable event occurs on the evening of 31 October: the

   season started usually with the first Quidditch match in the first weeks of November. In the second week of December, the Deputy Head would take names of those who would stay at Hogwarts over the
   Christmas holidays
   . The first term usually ended about a week before Christmas, and most of the students and some of the teachers went home by the school train.

   . Shortly after the 6th January (Epiphany aka Twelfth Night), the Hogwarts Express returned to Hogsmeade; the second term would begin. The exact dates of the beginning of the Easter holidays varied every year. During these holidays, the students could go home. The final exams were held the first week of June and the results came out on the second week. In the evening before the Hogwarts Express went back to London, the End-of-Term Feast was held. The Hogwarts Express returned to London during the third week of June. Some staff and all of the students left Hogwarts for summer holidays.

   There was an official school song, though it was only sung when the headmaster was in a particularly good mood and deemed it appropriate (which is therefore why it was only known to have been commissioned once from
   1991
   -
   1998
   ).
   It didn't seem to conform to the strict opinions of older headmasters and headmistresses, such as Armando Dippet. As such it may have been an invention of the relaxed Albus Dumbledore, and certainly sounded like it was of his invention.
   There was no standard rhythm to the song. Everyone could sing it how they like, as such the Weasley twins preferred a slow and deep style. The lyrics are shown below:

   Hogwarts was the most heavily haunted dwelling place in Britain (and this was against stiff competition, as there were more reported ghost sightings/sensings on these damp islands than anywhere else in the world). The castle was a congenial place for ghosts, because the living inhabitants treated their dead friends with tolerance and even affection, no matter how many times they had heard the same old reminiscences. Each of the four Hogwarts houses had its own ghost.

   Slytherin boasted the

    Bloody Baron
   </a>
   , who was covered in silver bloodstains. He was well known for being extremely unsocial and many students, including those of his own House, were known to be slightly afraid of him. While alive, he was a hot-tempered man. The least talkative of the house ghosts was the

    Grey Lady

   , who was long-haired and beautiful.
   She was the daughter of
   Rowena Ravenclaw
   , making her the only house ghost who was directly related to one of the four Hogwarts founders.

  <p key="e4464714-5578-433d-a6ad-5d2bbbf9e187">
   Hufflepuff house was haunted by the
   Fat Friar
   , who was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the pox merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling rabbits out of the communion cup. Though a genial character in general, the Fat Friar still resented the fact that he was never made a cardinal.
   He also frequently suggested that

  <p key="6f3d5a22-16ed-49b1-9043-674ee37fcb9e">
   Gryffindor house was home to Nearly Headless Nick, who in life was

    Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington

   Henry VII
   in life, until his foolish attempt to beautify a lady-in-waiting by

   caused the unfortunate woman to sprout tusks. Sir Nicholas was stripped of his wand and inexpertly executed, leaving his head hanging off by a single flap of skin and sinew. His ghost retained a feeling of inadequacy with regard to truly headless ghosts.

   Another notable Hogwarts ghost was

    Moaning Myrtle
   </a>
   , who haunted an unpopular girls' toilet. Myrtle was a student in Ravenclaw house at Hogwarts when she died, and she chose to return to school in perpetuity, with the short-term aim of haunting her arch-rival and bully,
   Olive Hornby
   . As the decades rolled by, Myrtle had made a name for herself as the most miserable ghost in school, and was usually found to be lurking inside one of the toilets and filling the tiled space with her moans and howls.

   All students at Hogwarts were required to complete a set of examinations to get into the next year of schooling. There was one exam for each subject. In fifth year, instead of end of the year exams, students sat their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels); the score they achieved on these was what allowed them to progress to N.E.W.T.-level. In order to progress to N.E.W.T., a student had to score either an 'Outstanding' or an 'Exceeds Expectations' on their O.W.L.

While students did have the opportunity to choose whether they wished to continue in particular subjects, those who began studying N.E.W.T.-level subjects in their sixth year were expected to carry on with the subject into the seventh year and sit the N.E.W.T. exam in that subject. Sixth year students were initially excited to have more free time, but this extra time was intended to help them study and do homework, as many, if not all, teachers assigned more
   homework

   The
   Easter holidays
   were not as enjoyable as the Christmas ones, as students were overloaded with homework in preparation for their exams, which were taken at the end of the year. Students were not allowed to use magic over the summer holidays until they turned seventeen; magic was also banned in corridors.

   The students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were required to wear a uniform. The uniform consisted of a black robe and a black pointed hat (occasionally), as well as coloured lapels and ties that distinguished different houses, along with the house logo on their chest. Students wore their own socks and shoes. Students had to wear their uniforms during all lessons, and while eating meals or studying in the

   . Students were allowed to wear their own clothes after lessons in their House dormitory and during the holidays. Most students were seen still wearing their uniforms in their house dormitory, most probably because they would need to change into their pyjamas to sleep before they go to bed, so they may feel that it is troublesome to change into their own clothes, then change again into their pyjamas.
