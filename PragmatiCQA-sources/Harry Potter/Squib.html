The horror of the moment when the Hat announced kindly that the boy beneath it was a good-hearted chap, but no wizard, would never be forgotten by those who witnessed it. Angus took off the hat and left the hall with tears streaming down his face. This had never happened before and it never happened since. Angus being a Squib caused him to become estranged from his family.

Angus ended up becoming a star in the Muggle sport of Scottish rugby, and his sporting talents became so well known that wizarding kind fell in love with his inspirational story, not to mention developing an odd interest in rugby.

   Despite the differences between Squibs and Muggles, they usually had a stronger affinity with each other than with wizards. Due to the prejudices in wizarding society, it was generally considered kinder to send them to Muggle schools and encourage them to integrate into Muggle society.
