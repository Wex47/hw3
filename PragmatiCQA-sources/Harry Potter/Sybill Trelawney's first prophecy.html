   He marked him with a
   lightning-bolt scar
   and did not kill him, but gave Harry powers, and a future, which would enable Harry to escape Voldemort four times, something neither Harry's parents nor Neville's parents ever achieved.

   Shocked by Voldemort's decision, Snape hastened to Dumbledore and explained that Voldemort had come to the conclusion that the Potters' child was his would-be vanquisher and had vowed to murder him. Snape also confessed his longtime
   love
   for Harry's mother,

   However, the

   Department of Mysteries
   , attempting to take the Prophecy from him. It was eventually smashed in a skirmish during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries taking place in the
   Death Chamber
   when it fell from Neville's pocket and Neville accidentally kicked and smashed it. The destruction of the prophecy infuriated Lord Voldemort, as it symbolised Harry triumphing over him once again.

   are the only two people who know the full contents of the prophecy. As the prophecy was made to Dumbledore, he had a memory of Trelawney telling it to him and thus could show it to Harry by means of his
   Pensieve

   scar
   , the reason he could
   speak to snakes
   , the reason he had no parents, and the reason he shares a connection with Voldemort's mind. It was all due to the fact of

Despite this, Dumbledore makes it clear to him that it is not entirely because of the prophecy that Harry would try to defeat Voldemort, it is because of the type of person Harry is that he would not rest until he had defeated the person who murdered his parents,

   about what the battle in the Ministry was centred on, leading to Harry being called "The Chosen One" in the newspapers.
   Indeed, Harry was the "The Chosen One" because Voldemort chose to believe that the prophecy was talking about Harry, the
   half-blood
   like himself and thus his equal. Harry survived the

   Harry knew that the prophecy meant he was the only one who could stop Voldemort. Only he had the ability to vanquish the Dark Lord
   and that it was up to him to finish the
   Horcrux hunt

  <p key="15677cbe-c06d-4ebe-858d-2ef7eaa31f26">
   Dumbledore explained to Harry that by attempting to kill Harry, Voldemort himself singled out the only person who would be able to defeat him, and thus it was a grave error on his part to act as Trelawney said. Not all prophecies are fulfilled, and so it was because of Voldemort that the prophecy of someone being able to vanquish the Dark Lord came true. Furthermore, Voldemort handed Harry the necessary weapons for the job. Voldemort also discovered, after the
   Battle of the Department of Mysteries
   , that it caused him excruciating agony to try to possess Harry because Harry is full of love. Voldemort didn't understand this, as in his haste to mutilate his

   Harry realised what Dumbledore said to him about the prophecy is that it his destiny was the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Harry knew that some would think there wasn't much difference between the two ways, but Harry knew with a rush of pride that both he and Dumbledore knew that it made all the difference in the world.
  </p>
  <p key="bef8f276-a503-4e35-860c-bf4526f46521">
   The prophecy was eventually fulfilled when Voldemort's Horcruxes were all destroyed, rendering Voldemort mortal and resulting in his final defeat and death at the hands of Harry Potter.
   Interestingly, while Voldemort chose to mark Harry as his target due to their similarities,

   In addition to Harry's love, the "power the Dark Lord knows not" could be Neville's courage (which enabled him to pull
