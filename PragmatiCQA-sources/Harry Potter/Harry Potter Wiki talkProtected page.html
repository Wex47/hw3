   I request unprotection due to the fact that this is a free wiki and should express the (correct) opinion of the people.  I also disagree with protecting this due to anyone can register, so what's the point.

   yes, I don't get why you can't edit it because you can just log in and then edit it, and like John Reaves said it's a free wiki, so you should get to edit anyone you want.:) :) :)
could you please unprotect it, i think that anyone with good 
information about a wiki should beable to 
edit it and put down there info.....

   On the Lavener Brown page, the quote found in the beginning of the "third year" section was actually from the fourth book and should be either changed or a note should be stated telling the difference.

   I see there are many pages that are major pages that are prone to vandalism, and they are indefinable. I was just wondering, of every page, why aren't the trio's pages protected? --

   I feel that they should not be protected, as there are some inconsistencies that need to be review. E.G. In Harry's article, in some places Ron's full name Ronald is used and at others his more famous nickname is used. This maybe confusing to newcomers to the fandom who have only recently or not at all read or watched the books or films, especially those who don't know what kind of a nickname a byname is. Also, in some articles, the film version is the primary source of information, and the difference between it and the books is not stated. Since the films are adaptations of the books, the books should be naturally treated as the primary source, with any difference between the book and film being noted when needed. Thus, I feel that this page should be unprotected if required, as there might be errors like these in Harry's dad's page too. PS, I think that this page's title should be changed to James Potter, while his grandson's should be changed to James Sirius Potter, as he and his other siblings are better known by their complete names.

   There are more facts here than any one person could produce I feel that there could be more knowledge to be shared and restricting the flow and sharing of information as such is counterproductive to the main cause of this website. For instance there are several unanswered questions that have been addressed on different articles that i feel that i could personally shed some light on. I am sure that many other people feel the same way. Please allow us our freedom on sharing information (not opinions). Atleast have the additions or corrections be submitted to the admins for review before publication. This is the information age, let us use it to our advantage.

And I would advise that two pictures of Dumbldore one of each actor one Richard Harris and the other of the other actor!!!! I am very angry that theres no picture of Richard Harris as Dumbldore in the Beginning of the article and a picture of the new actor for Dumbldore as Well!! I forget who. But that is not my point. My point is Richard Harris Deserves credit too!! That's insulting his memory!!!

   How do you expect this wiki to get edits when well over half the pages I've seen are semi-protected or protected. I believe that no person should be restricted to editing a small percentage of the pages of this wiki. Out of at least a hundred wikis that I have seen, none have even thought of this. So lets get down to the bottom of this: why do you protect a majority of the pages on this wiki (I am thinking you are trying to force people to register)? In a free wiki everyone can edit freely without creating an account or paying a fee. This wiki is not a free wiki. Definitely not. If you are convinced by my argument remove all the protection on any page in this wiki. Then this wiki is a free wiki where anyone, regardless of anything, can share share their knowledge AND edit freely. Jacob

   I would request unprotection of the etymology section of the Voldemort article, because previous authors have neglected to reflect on the secondary meaning of the French word "vol" which adds another dimension to his name. If I will not be allowed to edit it, I'd appreciate talking to someone who can edit it, so they might add some information I've gathered. --ajmurphyspence

   This page won't get any edits if it's all protected. Just because we are 'new users' it doesn't mean we don't have as good, if not better, ideas than the older users. So why not unprotect this site and patrol it for spam. Everything we do seems to be edited by one of you snooty 'older users.' No offence, but your like Percy waving his Prefect badge around to show who's in charge. But you haven't made an improvement.

  </p>
  <p key="8188c819-84bc-40da-9edc-e7836a7fb2b7">
   Some people criticise Rowling for the fact that Harry's wounds from Nagini in Deathly Hallows are cured merely with Dittany, whereas Arthur Weasley was hospitalized in St Mungos for so long. However, Harry explicitly states that the snake "only wanted to keep him there", as Voldemort himself needed to kill him. Therefore Nagini has a degree of control over use of the venom, and the point made in the Wiki article is incorrect.
  </p>
  <p key="ea6fa0e9-f14b-42c2-9d0a-8b153b3b5675">
   The article states that it is never explained why he is cured only by Dittany, when actually it is explained three sentences later or something, and it's bugging me.

   Please allow editing to the page on sexual orientation in the wizarding world. I would like to contribute more information on a topic that has an interesting role in queer literary readings of the series, and have information on the wizarding world's view of sexuality that could be useful. Fantasy series often work on addressing identity and sexual orientation in ways the mainstream does not, and Harry Potter is no exception to this trend. I would like to expand the article to reflect this so that more LGBTQ topics as they relate to HP can be heard in an article that is sadly lacking at the moment.

   Lots needs to be changed on the page. Allow lower levels in! This is ridiculous. This is fandom, not a controlled enviornment. This fandom has no corporate attachment!
