   Colin most likely had a good relationship with his family. His
   father
   was a milkman. Colin stated that his parents were very excited that their son was a wizard, and Colin wanted to take some photos of Hogwarts, in order to show to his father.
   Colin was also very close with his brother,
   Dennis
   , and was also excited when Dennis came to Hogwarts, too, and was sorted into

   In his
   fourth year
   , he and his brother fully believed that Harry did not lie about Voldemort's return. The Creeveys even became members of
   Dumbledore's Army
   (an organisation founded by Harry).
   When he died for Harry's cause, Harry's initial annoyance did not prevent him from being outright saddened when he saw Colin's dead body outside Hogwarts,
   showing Harry had grew to care quite a lot for the younger student, likely as despite his attempts to shrug him off, Colin still was fully dedicated to him while others who he had gotten along better with did not and joined the D.A, which Harry most likely appreciated.
