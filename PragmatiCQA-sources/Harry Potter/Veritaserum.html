   attempted to use Veritaserum on Harry the following year, but to no effect. In actuality, Snape had presented her with a fake potion, and Harry only pretended to drink it, instead dumping it in one of her plants while she was occupied. Umbridge later asked for more Veritaserum after Harry broke into her office to contact
   Sirius Black
   , but Snape said it would take a month to make more. Instead, he suggested she use poisons on Harry if the situation were very grave. Snape also taunted her about using the entire bottle during one dosage rather than using the necessary three drops. As a result, Dolores put Snape on
   probation
   and tried to use the
   Cruciatus Curse

   discouraged this idea since he knew that Slughorn would not be fooled easily and could resist the potion with the

   It could be mixed with pretty much any drink, and three drops was a sufficient dose to make the drinker "spill out his innermost secrets".
   Thus, the potion forced the drinker to tell the complete truth to any question put to them, according to what the drinker perceived as true.

   Since some wizards and witches could resist its effects while others could not, Veritaserum was "unfair and unreliable to use at a trial", and would have been difficult to use as definitive proof of guilt or innocence.

   Another problem was that the victim stated what only they believed to be true, so the victim's sanity and perception of reality were also factors in during interrogations. Therefore, while the drinker's answers were sincere, they were not necessarily true. This was the main reason why
   Barty Crouch Jnr
   's testimony was only partially credible,
   as some of his answers were true in his mind, but known to be false by his interrogators;
   Cornelius Fudge
   believed that Crouch being a "raving lunatic" was a mitigating factor on the Veritaserum's full effectiveness, thus chose not to believe half of it.
   However, despite Crouch's sociopathic and unhinged tendencies, his grip on reality and testimony was just.

    Because of the potion's usage being heavily controlled by the Ministry, the usages over the series are unauthorised and/or illegal: Dumbledore did not acquire permission from the Ministry before using it on Crouch, Umbridge used it for interrogating students despite such action being forbidden (though being a high-ranking Ministry official herself, she may have had the authority then), and Skeeter used it on Bagshot for an interview.

    Ironically enough, Umbridge's use of what she thought was Veritaserum on Harry wouldn't have worked even if it had been the real potion. Sirius was hiding in 12 Grimmauld Place, which was protected by a Fidelius Charm and Harry wasn't a Secret Keeper at the time and thus unable to reveal its location. Even if he had been, Veritaserum can't make a Secret Keeper reveal their secret, as they must do so willingly.

   has said that Veritaserum "works best upon the unsuspecting, the vulnerable and those insufficiently skilled (in one way or another) to protect themselves against it... just like every other kind of magic within the books, Veritaserum is not infallible."

   Sirius Black
