   Squibs were able to use magical devices, such as

   or other items whose magical capabilities were inherent, but not devices such as wands, which required magical abilities in the user.

  <p key="8d243d28-d960-48d2-bdd7-8db4406f8ef3">

   It is possible that a child or later descendant of

    It is stated all "pure-blood" families are interrelated. Muggle-borns are children of Muggles and have the magic gene possibly because of a squib, half-blood or pure-blood ancestor. Squibs are born into half-blood/pure-blood families but do not possess the power to use magic (though they would be carriers of the gene). Half-breeds are half-bloods/pure-bloods with a non-human ancestor. Muggles can become related and produce half-blood children when mixed with half-bloods/pure-bloods. A muggle may marry a squib and their descendants know nothing of their magical heritage until the gene resurfaces randomly.
   </li>
   <li key="8b85b772-6e06-452e-8ff3-acbd84cca9de">
    There are many parallels to the notion of blood purity that exist in the Muggle world, largely in the form of
    racism
    and 19th Century pseudo-science. Examples of this being manifested include the Ku Klux Klan, European colonialism (where, for instance, the children of slave-owners and slaves were denied the legal status of the slave owner's white children), some parts of the British National Party, Combat 18, some parts of The UK Independence Party, The National Front, some extreme forms of Afrocentrism (which might advocate for Black people to only marry and have children with other Black people), discrimination against immigrants in various cultures, and the persecution and mass murder of racial minorities such as Jews, Roma, Slavs, so-called "Mischlings" and others by the Nazis during the
    Holocaust
    . Adolf Hitler, promoting a society with a "pure Aryan race," is rumoured to have had a Jewish ancestor, and is thus similar to Lord Voldemort (Rowling herself compares the two figures).

     <li key="ab8b534c-88e5-43ec-99f5-6e59b9127b66">
      A more direct parallel, however, is the formation of blood purity laws and the infamous
      Spanish Inquisition
      in Mediaeval Spain to regulate the activities of Spanish conversos (converts to
      Christianity
      from either
      Judaism
      or
      Islam
      ). These
      conversos
      , although officially equal to their Christian brethren, were nonetheless scrutinised and even persecuted: if a converso showed any hint of heresy or apostasy, they would be subjected to
      auto-da-fé
      .

      Another direct parallel between blood purity and Harry Potter has been seen in the American Mafia. According to the code of the mafia, only men who are full-blooded Italian, meaning both parents are full Italian and can prove familial ancestry extending to Italy, are eligible to become "made men", or gain full-fledged mafioso status. In actuality, the American Mafia has found it increasingly difficult to adhere to those standards due to the large amount of immigration and intermarriages in the United States. Son of famous American mobster John Gotti; John Gotti Jnr, for instance, was born to a Italian/Russian mother and an Italian father, and should not have been made according to his own standards. Newer mafia code has said that men who can prove Italian ancestry through patrilineal descent (father's side) are eligible to get made.

   <li key="4d333951-b92b-47e8-acc3-bceb92a4585e">
    Although Ron Weasley stated that wizardkind would have died out without Muggle-borns, it would be more accurate to say that all pure-blood lines would die out through infertility, with the possible loss of most, if not all, compiled magic knowledge, skills and spells. However, there would still be wizards born out of the dispersed inherited magic from among Muggle kind, which could allow for individuals with magic abilities to eventually discover each other over generations and form groups. Such groups could then rediscover magical knowledge and eventually recreate lost spells and skills, essentially allowing a new wizardkind to start over, even if it took centuries.
