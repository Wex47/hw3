    In the book, the Diagon Alley attack is merely mentioned, and the Death Eaters were said to have kidnapped both Ollivander and

    Much of the first chapter has been omitted. This includes Cornelius Fudge discussing the murders, hurricanes, and bridge collapses that have been going on to the Muggle Prime Minister, as well as the former's resignation as Minister of Magic, and Rufus Scrimgeour introducing himself to the latter. However, there is still a minor reference in the

    at the beginning of the film that mentions there is a new Minister for Magic. The film instead begins with Bellatrix's final line ("I killed Sirius Black!") from the previous film echoing as Harry is seen standing in front of a mob of reporters, with their cameras flashing, when Dumbledore begins to lead Harry away. The scene then cuts to the bridge attack.

    The

    film location is inconsistent with the book. The mill referred to in the text is not a watermill or windmill, but a nineteenth-century textiles factory in a northern industrial town in the UK, most likely in Lancashire or West Yorkshire. The text references the mill chimneys (now disused) and rows of nearby houses. Terraced houses as shown in the film are typical of late nineteenth century mill-workers houses in industrial Britain.

    In the book, Bellatrix and Narcissa are met at the door by Snape, who then brings them to the parlour. Peter Pettigrew is then called in to bring them drinks. He does so, and then hurries upstairs to listen by a door, which Snape says is a new habit he has taken up. In the film, it is Peter who greets Narcissa and Bellatrix, and shows them to the parlour, where Snape is waiting. Snape then uses his wand to slam the door shut, barring Pettigrew from the room. Snape already has drinks out in the film.

In the book, Dumbledore comes for Harry at Privet Drive as he had pre-arranged in a letter, having a cup of tea and conversing with the Dursleys (who are absent from the film) before heading off with Harry. In the film, Harry is in a station café when he spots a flickering light in a distant part of the station. As a train whizzes past, Dumbledore appears on the platform across the tracks.

    In the book, Dumbledore tells Harry to take his left arm while on Privet Drive, as his wand arm was a little fragile, which Harry obliges and they apparate to Budleigh Babberton. There, as the two are talking, Dumbledore mutters "ouch" and points to his right arm. Harry then asks what happened to that hand, to which Dumbledore says that he has no time to explain it, but the tale is thrilling and he wants to do it justice. In the film, Harry meets Dumbledore on a train platform, and Dumbledore shows his right hand after Harry mentions how he enjoys riding on trains. Harry is a little startled by it, but before he can ask, Dumbledore acknowledges that it is a rather unpleasant sight, and says a similar line, "The tale is thrilling, if I do say so myself, but now's not the time to tell it." He then extends his left arm and instructs Harry to take it, which Harry is already to the left-hand side of Dumbledore and he obliges. The hand, curse and appearance aside, does not give Dumbledore any pain in the film.

In the film, Harry does not ask, and when asked if he was curious as to why they went there, Harry says that after all the years at Hogwarts, he no longer bothers to question what they do anymore. Dumbledore does not tell him anything about Slughorn or them being short on staff, only telling him to draw his wand, and they proceed to enter the house.

    Dumbledore's speech in the book explicitly states that Lord Voldemort is once again at large, and advises everyone to be careful and report any suspicious acts. In the film, however, he is more subtle, explaining that there was once a boy who attended the school, appearing to be a student like any other. The name Voldemort is not spoken, instead Dumbledore says this boy was named Tom Riddle, but is currently known around the world by another name. He goes on to state that, while at any moment there are dark forces attempting to enter the castle, "... in the end, their greatest weapon is you..."

As she is giving Harry his schedule, she says she is pleased with Harry's performance and asks why he wasn't continuing with Potions, to which he says he needed an 'Outstanding' in his O.W.L.'s.

We've actually pared them down in our story, and she was very supportive of that decision. They're such an enjoyable part of reading the Half-Blood Prince. But we've kind of distilled them down to two or three memories to try to keep everything more in the moment.

    In the book, when Slughorn finds Harry in Honeydukes, he tells Harry that he had missed the third supper party that Slughorn held (as Harry always held Quidditch practise whenever they were held) and invites him to another. In the film, this particular supper party is apparently the first (and possibly the only) one to be held during the term. In the book, Harry says he has to meet Dumbledore and thus is unable to attend, but in the film, he gladly accepts the invitation. Slughorn also invites Hermione to the supper party, whereas she had been attending the previous parties in the book. In the film, Ron asks Harry what he was "playing at" with Slughorn, and Harry says that Dumbledore wanted him to get to know Slughorn better.

    Mrs Cole taking Dumbledore into her room to talk about Tom Riddle is omitted.

    In the novel, Mrs Cole mispronounces Dumbledore's name by first calling him Dumberton by mistake. But when she tries to correct herself, she mispronounces his name again by calling him Dunderbore. In the film, Mrs Cole is able to pronounce Dumbledore's name correctly without making any mistakes as we hear her calling him 'Mr Dumbledore'. This is most likely because the film deleted the drinks she had with Dumbledore while talking about Riddle in her room before introducing Dumbledore to the boy.

      The scene as a whole was specifically made to serve as a representative of all of the news reports, which are scattered around in the source novel, about various attacks by Death Eaters on the wizard community. It was considered to provide better pacing for the film to have Harry actually experience one such attack firsthand, rather than hearing/reading about those that kept happening to some other students or their relatives.

    Draco is seen testing an apple on the vanishing cabinet. It comes back with a bite taken out. He then tests a white songbird in the cabinet, and it comes back dead. Draco's desperation and fear in this scene is palpable. It is likely that he was repeatedly testing to see if it would work correctly, and became more frightened the more the tests failed, as everything he sent through except for the black songbird came back damaged in some way. It is also possible that the white and black songbirds and their respective failure and success may be an act of symbolism or foreshadowing, as well as demonstrating the cabinets' temperamental nature.

    In the book, Harry opens the false locket when he was sitting by the deceased Dumbledore, noticing it is smaller than the one seen in the memory (omitted from the film), and lacks the distinct Slytherin "S" symbol. He then opens it, and holds the note to the light made by the school staff and students, and reads it. In the film, he just clutches the locket in this scene. Later, when he, Hermione, and Ron are in the Astronomy Tower, Harry hands Hermione the locket, and tells her that it is a fake. She then proceeds to open it and read the note.

    In the book, Dumbledore appears to be bleeding from his mouth after being killed, and Harry wipes off the blood with his (Harry's) own sleeve as he kneels by the headmaster's body. In the film, Dumbledore is not bleeding, and Harry just strokes Dumbledore's hair and puts his hand to Dumbledore's dormant heart. Also in the film, Ginny is seen going over to sit beside Harry and he leans on her shoulder sobbing.

    Also, since the visit to the hospital wing is omitted, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey are already standing in the courtyard with everybody else and staring down at Dumbledore's dead body, while Lupin, Tonks, Arthur and Molly are not present and Bill and Fleur are omitted from the film.

    The entire funeral scene is cut, and the last scene is the trio watching
    Fawkes
    flying away through the blue sky. In this scene Hermione mentions to Harry that Ron does not mind him being with Ginny, but they should still keep their snogging minimal whenever Ron is around.
    Also strangely enough, Ron sits off to the side and doesn't say a word while Harry and Hermione discuss R.A.B. whereas in the book Ron is equally part of the conversation and is sitting right next to them.

    During a scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione are sitting in Ron's room, discussing how old Dumbledore would be, there are two different angles taken: one, the angle by the door (that leads to a balcony outside) that shows the interior of the room, and two, the angle from the inside of the room that shows the exterior scenery. Based on these angles, we see Hermione's legs folded together on one angle whilst on the other angle, her other leg is laid down on the floor.

    Right after the scene in which Ginny snatches the Half-Blood Prince book and reads aloud that it "is property of the Half-Blood Prince", there is a short montage through the pages of the book, during which the writing "Sectumsempra - For Enemies" is briefly seen with the misspelling "Sectumpsempra". When we see Harry read the "Sectumsempra - For Enemies" note later on in the film, it is written in a completely different part of the book, in quite noticeably different handwriting, and with the correct spelling.

    During Slughorn's first class, Seamus Finnigan characteristically causes a small explosion as his potion blows up in his face. This shot is accomplished by a cut covered by a flash. Looking in the background to the left, Dean Thomas is in a different position after the flash than he was before, but the flash itself is too brief to cover that movement in addition to Dean noticing the explosion that just happened. In real time, his whole reaction would have been a bit delayed.

    When Harry, Ron and Hermione are talking at the table, the book of the Half-Blood Prince is opened on the page where "Sectumsempra - For Enemies" is written. When Harry stands up to go, the first page is open where "This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince" is written.

    During the scene in the Three Broomsticks in which Slughorn invites Harry and Hermione to his "occasional supper parties", the shot of Slughorn from the front shows the cup he is holding to be full of liquid. However, the cup appears to be empty when he is shot from behind.

    In the scene where Harry meets Dumbledore at his office before seeing his memory of first meeting Tom Riddle, Dumbledore is wearing his glasses while looking at
    Tom Riddle's diary
    just before Harry knocks on the door and enters, but when Harry is already inside and the next shot of Dumbledore appears, his glasses are gone.
