   house-elf
   who served the

   1992
   he disobeyed his masters and tried to warn

   Chamber of Secrets
   reopened. He came to know this via the contact between his masters and

   and slayed the
   basilisk
   in the Chamber of Secrets, he
   tricked
   Lucius Malfoy
   into freeing Dobby. Harry accomplished this by placing
   T. M. Riddle's Diary
   inside his own sock.
   Lucius disgustedly ripped the sock off the book and threw the sock into the air, where Dobby caught it.

   Dobby suffered a period of unemployment, during which he was often ostracised for having no "proper shame" in regards to being out of work. He was generally pleased to be free, although he did enjoy working as a hobby. Dobby was ecstatic to be out of the abusive hands of the Malfoys, but equally pleased to join the Hogwarts staff. At Hogwarts he could come and go as he liked, did not have many tasks, and those he did have were fairly simple. Dobby requested some compensations for his work and eventually he and Dumbledore came to an agreement. Dobby went on to work in the kitchens at

   Galleon

   Winky

   They treated Dobby with unkindness and cruelty, often reminding him to perform extra punishments on himself when he did something disagreeable to
   them
   .
   The Malfoys were harsh and abused Dobby often.  Dobby was threatened many times during his time serving the Malfoy family and told

   that he was accustomed to death threats, because he received them 'five times a day' from the Malfoys.
   Though he always did as he was told, he knew that their behaviour was wrong and he longed to be free of them.

   . Presumably, this was because the
   Malfoys
   saw Dobby as an insignificant slave, and because they knew that
   house-elves
   were not able to break the commands of their masters, never believing he would try to interfere.

   Ministry of Magic

   Mafalda Hopkirk
   of the
   Improper Use of Magic Office
   sent Harry a warning letter for the apparent transgression by an under-age wizard, informing the Dursleys that Harry was not allowed to use magic outside of school.
   Harry was then locked in his room;

   Whomping Willow
   after arriving late at the school.
   Dobby was so shocked to hear that they managed to return to Hogwarts that he accidentally allowed the Malfoys' dinner to burn, for which he was punished.

   Lastly, Dobby tried his most risky and dangerous plan by making
   a Bludger
   attack Harry during a Quidditch match, hoping to send him back to Privet Drive injured, but alive. This plan could not have been too well thought-out, because under normal circumstances Madam Pomfrey, the school nurse, would have been able to mend Harry's injuries instantly. However, an unfortunate blunder by Professor Gilderoy Lockhart resulted in Harry losing all the bones in his right arm. Madam Pomfrey was able to regrow the bones by using
   Skele-Gro
   but it took an entire night. While Harry was in the
   Hospital Wing
   recovering, Dobby appeared and admitted his acts, enraging Harry to the point that he threatened to strangle him. Dobby implored Harry to leave, accidentally admitting that the
   Chamber of Secrets
   had been opened before. Harry demanded to know who had opened it last time, but Dobby refused to reveal any more information and
   disapparated
   when he heard someone coming.

   had returned. Here, realising that Dobby belonged to the Malfoys, Harry stuffed Tom Riddle's Diary into one of his socks and handed it to Lucius Malfoy. Lucius ripped the sock off the diary, only for the sock to be caught by Dobby.
   This act freed Dobby from the Malfoys.
   When Lucius tried to attack Harry in retaliation, Dobby blasted him backwards down a flight of stairs. Although house elves are treated as low-class slaves, they have
   very powerful magic

   was initially indignant at the amount of pay, but Dobby explained that he requested that amount, as Dumbledore had offered ten Galleons a week and weekends off. It was just before this time that Hermione formed the organisation called

   When
   Winky
   ,
   Barty Crouch Snr
   's house-elf, was given clothes and freed of her servitude, she did not accept it as a reward, as Dobby had, but rather as punishment and a shameful failure in the fashion of most house-elves.
   She took up work at Hogwarts as well, but she became a heavy drinker of
   butterbeer
   , and Dobby took care of her.
   For a time, Dobby was the only Hogwarts house-elf who would clean
   Gryffindor Tower
   , because Hermione had hidden woollen hats and socks in with the rubbish with the intention of freeing them. The Hogwarts house-elves refused thereafter to clean the common room, as they viewed the hidden clothes to be insulting.
   This was a delight for Dobby, though, because it allowed him to see Harry Potter and his friends,

When he heard, Harry ordered Dobby not to punish himself for disobeying a direct order from Umbridge. Despite Dobby's warning Harry and the other members were still caught and punished.

   Dobby was a house-elf, much shorter in stature than humans, standing only about 3 and a half feet (1.06 m). He had large, tennis-ball-like green eyes,
   a pencil-like nose and long,
   bat-like pointed ears.
   Before he was given freedom, he wore a body-covering pillowcase. Later at Hogwarts, he wore a mismatched variety of jumpers, shorts, and socks.

    Personality and traits
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="7e444c69-c4ad-4ce6-8f92-722762ff3c84">
   Dobby was a brave, loyal house-elf, willing to put himself in dangerous situations when he knew it to be the right thing to do.
   He was also very loyal to the few friends he had. He considered himself to be a good house-elf, though other house-elves seemed to find his desires and proclamations of being a free house-elf to be shameful. Despite this, he was still a hard worker. When he went to work at Hogwarts he refused Dumbledore's original offer of ten Galleons a week and weekends off, opting instead for one Galleon a week and one day off per month. He explained to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that he liked freedom very much, but he liked work better. Dobby thought of Harry as his best friend.
  </p>
  <p key="4f2a197c-6f86-4130-bee3-adc30b2fc29b">
   Because of his loyalty to his friends, Dobby tried everything he could to save them if they were in danger, even if it hurt them, and once attempted to seriously injure Harry Potter, hoping that if he was hurt badly enough he would be sent home (this led to Harry asking Dobby to never try to save him again after setting him free). He did not make the rogue bludger chase Harry out of malicious intent, but because he was trying to save him from Lucius Malfoy's plot to open the Chamber of Secrets.
   When Harry found out, he was furious but Dobby explained why he had tampered with the bludger,
   and by the end of the year Harry had forgiven him.
  </p>
  <p key="6e0bd02b-b9ec-409d-afe0-bf76a1730435">
   Regardless, Dobby displayed a lack of foresight and common sense in his efforts to keep Harry from returning to Hogwarts in that by doing so he was putting Harry in danger in the long run by essentially ending Harry's education, which would have left him vulnerable to his enemies. Not only that, he was unintentionally insensitive to the wishes and feelings of Harry, who loved Hogwarts and his friends, and Dobby was essentially trying to cut Harry off from the things in his life that gave him real joy and purpose.
  </p>
  <p key="1fb29085-6535-459b-902f-905ae42dc714">
   One most noticeable trait was his capacity to self-harm whenever he believed he had done something wrong, usually using something to hit his head with and going as far as to iron his own hands. Dobby clearly had a strong conscience, and punished himself even when he had done "wrong" things that house elves should not do, even if they were for the right reasons.
  </p>
  <p key="6b59eb80-e47a-48c1-bf23-584af7f759fa">
   Dobby's favourite gift to receive was socks, likely because he was freed from his enslavement to the Malfoys with a sock.
   He would get confused when he would get two of the same style as he preferred to have two brightly coloured or patterned mismatched socks, and would often give socks as gifts as well.
  </p>
  <p key="de2ed9a4-809a-4927-a9c7-d348835cb1ba">
   Dobby referred to himself in the third person and tended to get his verb conjugations mixed up. Examples of his strange speech pattern include "I has seven now sir"
   or "Dobby must punish himself most grievously for coming sir".
   Dobby also referred to Ron as Harry's "Wheezy."
  </p>
  <p key="ab8f005b-aced-4175-8558-9566764c9a31">
   He was extremely devoted to Harry after he freed him in
   1993
   ,
   helping him out on several occasions, ultimately at the cost of his own life.
   He also tried to help Winky after she was dismissed by
   Crouch
   , getting her a job at Hogwarts as well,
   and looking after her whenever she became drunk on
   butterbeer
   .

This was shown when he tampered with a bludger forcing it to chase Harry hoping that if it hurt him badly enough he'd be sent home. Naturally Dobby was not intending to kill Harry; in fact he was trying to save him from Lucius Malfoy's plan to open the Chamber of Secrets.

     do
    </i>
    have very
    powerful magic
    , perhaps even beyond that of witches and wizards. House-elves do not need possession of a
    wand
    to cast
    spells
    or perform magical actions, as most wizards and witches do. In addition, boundaries are put on the apparition of witches and wizards in certain areas, but this does not apply to house-elves, so in this sense, they have much greater power than that of wizards (as far as apparition goes). They also can do magic
    without wands
    , something only the most powerful witches and wizards can do. Dobby could disarm with a snap of his fingers, send strong blasts to stun and disable opponents, and very efficiently perform
    charms
    like those of witches and wizards such as levitation and also tamper with magical objects. Dobby even managed to save Garrick Ollivander, Griphook the Goblin, Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter from a mansion full of some of the most powerful Death Eaters, even if it was at the cost of his own life—Dobby sacrificed himself in order to get Harry and his friends out of a situation in which they surely otherwise would have died. Without Dobby, Harry would not have lived, and Voldemort never would have been defeated. That being said, Dobby played a very significant role in the defeat of Voldemort, although sadly he was hardly ever recognised, probably partially due to the fact that he is a house-elf. Although quite small and humble, when put into perspective, Dobby was extremely powerful and was very heroic in his contributions to the

   Dobby and Harry Potter had a very strong relationship. Dobby loved and respected him very much to the point where he considered Harry to be his best friend. When Harry first met Dobby, he was a bit confused by the elf's devotion to keeping him safe from harm. Harry was furious when he found out Dobby was intercepting all of his friends' letters to him, and demanded them back while refusing to promise him to stay out of Hogwarts.
   Throughout the year, when Dobby made attempts to drive Harry away from

   , causing some rather unpleasant results on the way, Harry made some threats that were never followed through.
   Near the end of the
   1992–1993 school year
   , Harry freed Dobby from the slavery of the
   Malfoy family
   . Lucius became angry and intended to attack Harry but Dobby protected him by using a defensive spell. Dobby may have realised that he underestimated Harry Potter, when Harry managed to stop Lucius' plot and survive the
   Chamber of Secrets

   , though even as a free elf, his loyalty always laid foremost with Harry. When Harry visited the kitchens and therefore Dobby, Dobby hugged him so tightly that Harry felt as though his ribs might crack. Dobby also asked if it would be alright if he visited Harry from time-to-time, with Harry responding with an of course.
   Dobby visited Harry on Christmas day and presented him with a present, socks and when Harry tried them on Dobby's eyes misted with tears.
   In 1994, Dobby also provided Harry with gillyweed for the second task of the Triwizard Tournament.

   Room of Requirement
   and how to get inside. It is a secret room inside Hogwarts castle and cannot be seen even on the

   Dumbledore's Army

   When

   Dobby and Hermione didn't meet again until
   1997
   , when Harry had sent Dobby to spy on Draco Malfoy. When Dobby came to the Malfoy Manor to rescue them, Hermione was being tortured by
   Bellatrix Lestrange
   . Dobby then brought them to

   Dobby was first seen with Winky, a female
   house-elf
   , in
   1994
   . Earlier that same year, Harry had mistaken Winky for Dobby at the Quidditch World Cup. Winky excitedly told Harry that she knew Dobby, too; they evidently were friends previous to
   1994
   even though their relationship was only first displayed that year. It is likely that they met in the company of their masters, as Winky's master
   Barty Crouch
   was a high-ranking ministry official and Dobby's former masters the
   Malfoy family
   were well-connected and influential socialites.
  </p>
  <p key="d4617111-3b19-4806-8d0d-92a8ff4dcf56">
   Unlike Dobby, who loved his freedom, Winky was depressed and thought she was useless. When Dobby expressed his opinion that his life as a free elf was better than as a servant, he made her believe that he was a “bad house-elf”. So, Dobby tried in vain to convince her that she could live without serving the
   Crouch family
   by finding them both jobs at Hogwarts.
   It is known that Winky eventually managed to get over the fact that she was fired, although Dobby had died by then.

   Dobby presumably met Kreacher, another
   house-elf
   , in late 1996 when Harry sent Kreacher to work in the kitchens of Hogwarts, and they did not have a good relationship. Firstly, Kreacher strongly disliked Harry because he was a friend of many Muggle-borns and “blood-traitors" and because Harry initially wasn't very nice to Kreacher. Dobby loved and respected Harry very much for a variety of reasons; these differing viewpoints on Dobby's hero/best friend was mostly the reason why the two house-elves often fought with each other.

  <p key="5990167c-7d87-4899-addd-5a8dec2b2232">
   In
   1996
   , they fought in the hospital wing because Kreacher had badmouthed Harry. Harry attempted to make them stop, but then

   appeared and encouraged them to hit each other. During the scuffle, Dobby managed to hit Kreacher in the mouth hard enough to knock out half his teeth – it is unknown how Kreacher grew them back or if he ever did. Furthermore, Harry told both Dobby and Kreacher to go and spy on
   <a href="Draco Malfoy.html" key="8a24499d-bc4a-45a6-99aa-81f07ee414a2" title="Draco Malfoy">

   </a>
   ; even then, they argued: When they reappeared to give a report, Dobby was angry that Kreacher hadn't informed him that he was going to Harry. Dobby didn't want it to seem like he hadn't been helping, as Kreacher was trying to make it out.
   However, Kreacher later started to respect Harry and be less prejudiced in general. It is possible that, since Kreacher had contact with the Hogwarts kitchen house-elves, he had contact with Dobby, too, and their common ground caused a release of the bad blood, but it is unknown. Dobby might not have learned about Kreacher's change before he was killed in
   1998
   . Kreacher looked like Dobby in appearance, but was angry and antagonistic in character.

   . He loved his life as a free elf, something that the other house-elves who worked at the kitchens did not. They believed Dobby was mad and there was a great difference between their ideology and Dobby's, about a house-elf's life.
   Thus, he didn't have such a good relationship with his co-workers, as they believed that a house-elf should not have any personal life when they had to work and serve their masters.
   However, their opinion about Dobby might have changed during their later years at Hogwarts. During the
   <a href="Battle of Hogwarts.html" key="514e52e0-c878-4743-a49f-f21d3c198c13" title="Battle of Hogwarts">
    Battle of Hogwarts
   </a>
   all the house-elves, with Kreacher as a leader, fought against the
   Death Eaters
   , without anyone ordering them to do so.
   This indicates that they learned a house-elf can have a personal opinion, and that they should have as many rights as the humans. Unfortunately, Dobby had died by then.

   According to the
   Oxford English Dictionary
   , a "dobby" is an old English word for a benevolent elf that would perform household tasks secretly in the night, like the elves in tales of the elves and the shoemaker. However, just as those elves disappeared when the shoemaker made them shoes, so the dobbies were said to disappear when offered clothing. Also called a Brownie. A dobby is also a small mechanical part in a loom that enables the weaver to create small geometric patterns.
