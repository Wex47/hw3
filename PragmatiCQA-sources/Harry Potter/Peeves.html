   . He "came with the building",
   and came into existence with the founding of an institution containing a large number of children. Whilst unconfirmed, it was guessed that Peeves is a tangible manifestation of the students' mischief. Peeves has wrought havoc upon Hogwarts for centuries, and was often the cause of ire for various teachers and staff. Starting with
   Hankerton Humble
   , who was appointed by the Founders themselves, Peeves has traditionally been a pet peeve of every
   caretaker
   the school has seen.

   In 1876, caretaker
   Rancorous Carpe
   devised an "

   " in an effort to remove Peeves from the

   . The trap comprised a bait of assortment of weapons and a vast enchanted bell jar, reinforced by various
   Containment Charms
   , which he intended to drop over the poltergeist once he was in place. This did not go as planned, as Peeves easily broke through the bell jar and was left armed with several cutlasses, crossbows, a
   blunderbuss
   and a miniature cannon. The Castle had to be evacuated for three days as Peeves amused himself by firing randomly and threatening the students with death.

   Professor Eupraxia Mole
   , Headmistress of the day, agreed to sign a
   contract
   with Peeves, so that he relinquished the weapons in exchange for additional privileges (a once-weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor, first choice on stale bread from the
   kitchens
   for throwing purposes, and a new custom-made hat by
   Madame Bonhabille
   ). This was the last and most disastrous attempt to get rid of Peeves. These events forced Mr Carpe to take early retirement "for health reasons".

   " in 1992, Peeves taunted him in the hallways for "speaking in tongues."
   If students were late to class, he would, among other things, drop wastepaper baskets on their heads, pelt them with
   chalk
   , or pull the rugs out from under them. The worst case involved him sneaking up invisible, grabbing the person's nose and screeching "GOT YOUR CONK!".

   Peeves was shown to be able to create food at will out of thin air. This ability of his was shown when

   was trying to get Peeves to give him the vault portrait.
   Since this broke one of
   Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration
   , this might mean that Peeves might have had otherworldly powers. However, despite this, he did not seem to have the power to oppose tremendously powerful wizards, as he was shown to be unwilling to challenge the notoriously powerful Dumbledore.

   , was able to drive him away by pretending to be the Baron. Although Peeves did not usually heed commands, he did recognise authority of a sort. Though generally unimpressed by titles and badges, he is generally amenable to the strictures of the teachers, agreeing to stay out of their classrooms while they teach. He has also been known to show an affinity for rare students (notably

   ).
  </p>
  <p key="db6fb135-a1fb-41e6-b8fc-d13fb7ae9d24">
   However, Peeves was loyal and devoted to Hogwarts and proved this twice: first by defying the hated Dolores Umbridge by assaulting her endlessly with trouble, and then in the Battle of Hogwarts where he dropped
   Snargaluff
   pods on Death Eaters in mid-air,
   causing general chaos among their ranks and later showing evident joy when Voldemort was defeated.
  </p>
  <p key="971ba8fb-9491-4e8a-934d-ac1a8aca1039">
   Peeves also possessed a honourable side, as after Jacob's sibling had caused great chaos around Hogwarts, Peeves kept his end of the bargain.
   Students were known to allow Peeves to take the blame for their own mischief, for which he accepted responsibility, as he never had any fear of repercussions.

   Filch never ceased his futile efforts to get Peeves banished from the castle, and Peeves never stopped taunting Filch.
   To annoy Filch, Peeves trapped Mrs Norris in a suit of armour twice, dropped chandeliers and caused general mayhem, which Filch was later responsible for cleaning.
   It is presumed that this ongoing war between them continued after the Battle of Hogwarts, but Peeves' valour in service to the school during the fighting would have only made it harder for Filch to ever get him removed.

   Peeves has directly clashed with other past Hogwarts caretakers, including

   and
   Rancorous Carpe
   . An attempt by Carpe to remove Peeves by luring him into a
   trap
   featuring weapons and trapping him with
   Containment Charms
   instead resulted in Peeves seizing the weapons and then subjecting Hogwarts to a three-day standoff. The standoff was only ended when then Headmistress
   Eupraxia Mole
   drew up a
   contract
   that granted him special privileges, including a once-weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor, first refusal on stale bread from the
   kitchen
   for throwing purposes, and a new hat — to be custom-made by

  <p key="f1b2021c-d9ad-488a-9de4-ccb1f8aaabfd">
   However, despite all this, Peeves's surprisingly high loyalty to Hogwarts proved to allow him to work with both students and teachers alike when Hogwarts is truly in great danger, as he valiantly fought for Hogwarts during the Battle of Hogwarts and effectively coordinated with the fighters on Hogwarts's side; he taunted and attacked only the Death Eaters, and never once pranked any of those fighting for Hogwarts.
