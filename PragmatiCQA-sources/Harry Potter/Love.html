   's love for her son made her willing to die for him. Because of her loving
   sacrifice
   , Harry Potter was protected from very powerful dark magic — the

   .
   This protection was later strengthened when Voldemort arrogantly used Harry's blood to reinvigorate his body, to the point that Harry could not be killed while Voldemort was still alive, making it possible for Harry to survive another hit from the Killing Curse, when he found out when he was one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. By doing the same thing as his mother did, everyone that Harry sacrificed for was shielded from Voldemort.

   Love was the only protection against the lure and power of the

   Love could also enhance the power of a Patronus, as Harry's love for Sirius made him produce a Patronus so powerful that it could drive hundreds of

   Love Potions
   and
   Entrancing Enchantments
   were meant to artificially create love, but they couldn't; nothing could reproduce real love. Instead, they could at most produce an intense infatuation or obsession. Should these powers become undone, the victim would most likely lose all infatuation for the caster, and even become embarrassed or horrified, as Ron Weasley and Tom Riddle Snr both experienced once the love potion they were administered were cancelled, the latter even fleeing without a hint of care for the one who tried to captivate him. When a person smelt
   Amortentia
   , they would smell things that reminded them of what and whom they loved.

   was where love was studied, and a large fountain of Amortentia was kept. This fountain was the centre of the room and the Amortentia within it was very powerful.

   It appeared that those who abused the power of love, or applied it for the sake of those who had an affinity for the Dark Arts, usually suffered some severe backlash, based on the First Law of the
   Fundamental Laws of Magic
   . A prime example was seen when
   <a href="Merope Riddle.html" key="e9b42cfd-0134-4405-b72f-20e6305c86ec" title="Merope Riddle">
    Merope Gaunt

   used enchantments to subjugate the man she genuinely loved. This subjugation led to her being abandoned and left to die in despair (along with her magical powers being drained from the sorrow), when she lifted the control off her besotted. She later gave birth to
   <a href="Tom Riddle.html" key="7fce77a7-4cc2-449b-836a-1aea025b9ec8" title="Tom Riddle">
    a loveless being who would create a campaign of hatred for many decades

   truly loving

   and making much selfless sacrifices for his sake, he was utterly ungrateful and instead wasted their efforts. Since he abused their affections and returned to the
   Dark Arts
   , he suffered a fate worse than death.
