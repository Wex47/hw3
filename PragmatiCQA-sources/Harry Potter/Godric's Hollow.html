   A statue was later erected at the centre of the village square in Godric's Hollow in memory of James and Lily Potter and a dedication to Harry Potter.
   It's unknown exactly when it was erected and it can be assumed it was commissioned by the wizarding population of the Hollow, and the wider wizarding community of Great Britain.

   From a distance, the statue appeared as an obelisk, carved with the names of people who died in a war (presumably Muggle casualties of World War I or World War II). While

  <p key="cb225be2-30f2-402c-9120-596eb5ae4832">
   This sign was graffitied over the years with names and messages of support for Harry, something that he thought was touching. The house, like the statue, had been made invisible to

   . During the same visit, they were attacked by
   Nagini
   , disguised as Bathilda Bagshot. Lord Voldemort had previously murdered Bathilda and used
   Dark Magic
   to conceal Nagini within her corpse. She could not speak, however, except in
   Parseltongue
   , and communicated mainly through gesturing.

  <p key="464706d0-67bf-495e-9242-07a5b506ad89">
   After Nagini lured Harry away from Hermione and verified his identity, she telepathically contacted Voldemort, who told her to hold him. However, Hermione intervened,
   blasting
   the snake away and
   Disapparating
   with Harry just as Voldemort arrived. During the struggle,
   Harry's wand
   was inadvertently broken by Hermione's miscast curse. He was therefore required to use a new wand for the remainder of the hunt.

   The Hollow was described as being quaint. There was a narrow road with look-a-like cottages that resided on either side of it. There was streetlights at the centre of the village indicating it as the square. There was also
   a little church
   , and behind it, the village's graveyard. The graveyard was described as having row upon row of tombstones, some very old. The headstones showed members of different wizarding families that were buried there, such as an
   Abbott
   and
   Ignotus Peverell

   's note that Godric's Hollow was the home of a relatively large number of wizards does not indicate that it was a purely Wizarding village; in fact,
   Hogsmeade
   village was the only purely Wizarding village in Britain. As such, wizard residents of Godric's Hollow still had to avoid open use of magic to avoid disturbing the Muggle residents of the village. This is why the monuments to the
   Potter family
   were hidden.
  </p>
  <p key="1a82552f-b8d0-4ece-b038-52f32684a8c3">
   Similarly, the
   Potter cottage
   on the edge of the village was charmed to be invisible to Muggles. One must assume that a charm similar to the one that hides
   12 Grimmauld Place
   must have been in use at the latter site, to prevent Muggles from trying to build on the apparently empty lot as the village grew.
   Given the Dumbledore family experience with
   <a href="Non-magic people.html" key="154fc7e0-61b7-4c5c-acc2-4926d505ae67" title="Non-magic people">
    Muggles
   </a>
   , it was a little surprising that the family chose to settle at Godric's Hollow rather than Hogsmeade. However, it is possible that there was some family history that connected the family to this village; and it seems likely that the
   Dumbledore family
   chose to live in a part of the village that was primarily wizard-occupied.
