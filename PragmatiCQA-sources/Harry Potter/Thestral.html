   Thestrals had quite a disturbing appearance and the wizards who were capable of seeing them often only described these creatures as being sinister and spooky. This was because they were seen as having big, bony figures and their dragon-like faces which bore white, glittering eyes that lacked both expression and pupils. Additionally, they were lured by the scent of blood.

   Being a type of winged horse, most of their anatomy was identical to a horse, excluding their large wings that sprouted from their back. Unlike the
   Abraxan
   , another breed of winged horses, Thestral's wings did not possess any feathers at all; they had vast, black and leathery wings that were more similar to those of bats.
  </p>
  <p key="658745fa-5367-4242-8f5f-83d4059e12ce">
   Their fleshless, lustrous bodies were covered with a translucent and glossy coat. This smooth and dark skin was a bit slippery and so thin that Thestral's bones were clearly defined through the entire extension of their sleek bodies. These eerie horses had long black manes, as well as a large tail, either with flowing black hair, like horses or ending in a tuft, like zebras.
   Another distinction was their sharp fangs used to seize and slash their prey.

   They appeared to be loyal creatures, able to discern a friend from an enemy and offer help to humans in need of transportation. Thestrals would forcefully attack anyone or anything they saw as a threat and in the unusual case of domesticated Thestrals, any enemy of its owners.
   Thestrals were not marks of ill omen, nor (their spooky appearance notwithstanding) were they in any way threatening to humans, always allowing for the fright that the first sight of them tended to give the observer.

   The

   They also had quite a useful sense of direction. The Thestral could understand exactly where their riders needed to go, even if the beast itself might or might not be familiar with the terminus in question. If their riders had a certain destination in mind, they only needed to say the destination and the creature would diligently carry them to the intended location — much like owls do with letters.

   When riding a Thestral, the traveller usually holded the creature's mane to ensure balance. To aid the mounting, the wizards also placed their legs behind the wing joints to provide safety. Flying on the back of a Thestral during a long journey was frequently an unpleasant experience, particularly to those who dared riding them without seeing the creature. The high speed flight on an invisible steed could be terrifying. The wind would, eventually, cause a temporary deafness and force the riders to close their eyes. It was often difficult to keep balance on their slick backs.

   The Hogwarts herd was gentle towards humans, they reacted satisfactorily to caresses and avoided attacking owls. However, taking into consideration the Ministry of Magic classification as "dangerous",
   this behaviour might be exclusive to well-trained Thestrals,

      , when Harry and Cedric are transported into the graveyard, Harry's scar begins to hurt and then Wormtail kills Cedric. It mentions "A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he felt something heavy fall to the ground beside him." That meant that Harry had his eyes closed when Cedric died and did not know what fell next to him. Therefore, Harry did not actually witness Cedric's death and should not have been able to see Thestrals as a result of it. Despite this, it is canon that Harry can see Thestrals, as it was clearly stated that he could see them in

      , and thus the way in which he witnessed Cedric's death can be described as a consistency error. If one considers it a mistake that Harry was able to see Thestrals, then he should not have been able to see them until either the death of Sirius Black, or Albus Dumbledore, depending on whether witnessing Black falling through the Veil would count. Thestrals, however, can be seen by someone who has gained a sufficient understanding of what death means, and it is possible this was enough for Harry to see them, even though he had not witnessed Cedric's death directly.
