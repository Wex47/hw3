   although she was burned off the family tree after marrying a muggle-born, which was considered a betrayal to the family. Her mother noticed that Tonks changed hair colour on the day of her birth, meaning she was a Metamorphmagus. Given her common use of the greeting “Wotcher,” which is strongly associated with London, she likely grew up in southern England.

   In her
   third year
   , Tonks took at least
   Divination
   and
   Muggle Studies
   as her elective subjects. Also in the
   1986–1987 school year
   , at the start of the
   Herbology
   lesson on
   Valerian
   Sprigs, Tonks warned people to watch out, for she spilled some soil on the floor. When the Herbology Professor (her
   Head of House
   )
   Pomona Sprout
   , asked fellow Housemate

   to fetch a pail for the watering demonstration, Tonks took the time to briefly wonder aloud about which plant would be most suitable for bothering a certain "irritable, birdlike"

  <p key="72f163bf-61de-4132-8f42-8c019df37517">
   The musing was cut short by Penny's scream, and the class realised in shock that a supposed
   werewolf
   had burst out of a plant pot. Professor Sprout took care of the situation by casting the
   Boggart-Banishing Spell
   , and introduced the class to what a

   Before the start of the lesson on "rolling" in the
   Flying class
   , Tonks chatted excitedly with

   and Jacob's sibling, for as

   . She was especially looking forward to visiting
   Zonko's Joke Shop
   and
   Honeydukes
   , along with having
   Butterbeer
   at the
   Three Broomsticks Inn
   . After the lesson, she revealed she had crashed into the
   Owlery
   , the

   , the
   Whomping Willow
   , and
   Rubeus Hagrid's garden
   , but that apparently was a few crashes fewer than her average. Tonks later revealed that she had often gotten detentions for turning into teachers using her Metamorphmagus abilities.

   When revisiting an old lesson in Herbology, re-potting baby
   Mandrakes
   , Tonks forgot her
   earmuffs
   and resorted to rolling up some
   Jelly Slugs
   and sticking them in her ears, which proved to be sub-optimal, for though she was not affected by the screaming Mandrakes; after class, she also could not properly converse with Jacob's sibling, due to being unable to hear.

   Tonks was enthusiastic, bubbly, and easily able to make friends with people she had just met. She was eager and would often want to help

   Grimmauld Place
   , something that Molly was not eager about. As a
   Metamorphmagus
   , Tonks was known for using her gift for lighter purposes, such as experimenting with her appearance for entertainment. Despite this, she had difficulty controlling her magical abilities when she was unhappy, such as when her love was rejected by

   or when she was very angry.
  </p>
  <p key="eb942a1f-c0ec-4cf0-aef5-3ce036329b49">
   Tonks was notoriously clumsy and curious. For example, she smashed a plate in the Dursley's kitchen during their rescue of Harry Potter and knocked over an umbrella stand in Grimmauld Place. In her youth, Tonks tried to solve her mistakes in unorthodox ways, though they were not always effective.

  <p key="fc406062-e4a3-4d8f-bb5f-b20e62ad892d">
   Despite her young age, Tonks possessed an incredible will. This is evident when she cast a non-verbal Patronus Charm, which requires a powerfully happy memory, despite being highly miserable at the time. Tonks was a staunchly loyal supporter of

   Tonks rather disliked her given name and considered her mother as a fool for naming her as such, thus insisting to be called "Tonks" instead. She didn't express any rejection when others referred to her as "Dora", a shortened form of the given name she detested so much. This may have been because her father and her husband both called her it.

    : Unlike most other wizards and witches, Tonks possessed the ability to change her physical appearance at will, without the need for a potion or a spell to assist. With simply a thought, she was capable of changing her facial features, nose shape, the colour of her hair and eyes, or even her entire form. Tonks used this ability both to entertain people and to stop people from recognising her, as evidenced by her ability to take the form of

    . Tonks' rare skill was invaluable for espionage, as she worked as a covert operative inside the Ministry to feed the Order information and disguised herself as an old woman to escort Harry to the Hogwarts Express. She also passed the Disguise and Concealment portion of her Auror training without any studying.

   with fellow member Remus Lupin, who found her amusing, then impressing, and eventually reciprocated her feelings, although he didn't notice them at first because he was used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. After a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members during a mission they had together ("He’s still handsome, isn't he, even after Azkaban?"). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend ("He always got the women.").

   Despite being extremely happy, Remus felt that any relationship between the two of them was too dangerous because he was a

She tried on several occasions to convince him otherwise, but he constantly refused her pleas and even volunteered for long-term, lethal missions to keep distance between them. Tonks became depressed over this and confided in

   Tonks met Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley in the summer of
   1995
   . She immediately struck up a friendship with them, acting somewhat like an older sister to the teenagers during their time at Grimmauld Place. Ginny appreciated Tonks since, although she was an adult, she was interested in having fun and taught her how to check if a door had an
   Imperturbable Charm
   on it, by flicking objects at the door in question. Hermione liked the fact that Tonks was proof that women could also be successful and get good positions after school. Both liked the fact that she could change her appearance at will, as she entertained them both over dinner by changing her nose into various shapes.

   Severus Snape was Tonks' Potions professor and would therefore have contributed to her becoming an Auror, as a high

   In her adulthood, Tonks seemed to have no particular opinion of Snape regarding his loyalty, though it can be assumed that she trusted him because Dumbledore did but did not view him as a friend. In
   1996
   , Snape insulted her wolf Patronus, which by extension was an insult to her love for Lupin. After Snape's murder of Dumbledore, Tonks came to view the former as an enemy. Tonks died before learning of Snape's true loyalty or that he had tried to save her husband during the

    literally means "Gift of the Nymphs." Nymphs are nature spirits and minor deities in Greek mythology who rule trees, sacred groves, streams and the ocean, and are capable of changing their form, just like Tonks. During the Renaissance, northern Europeans equated the classical nymphs with their own legends of elves. If we therefore read "gift of the nymphs" as "gift of the elves", this echoes the ancient myth of babies stolen by elves and replaced by hideous monsters called "changelings". 'Nymph' is also the name of the "immature stage of a dragonfly or damselfly before it moults, before metamorphosing into a winged adult". All three meanings reference Tonks' metamorphosing skills.

    Henry Tonks

    Her husband's surname, Lupin, is quite fitting for Tonks: As a Metamorphmagus, she was noted for her ability to change her appearance to adapt or blend in in her work as an Auror, as wolves are one of the most adaptive mammals on the planet. It is a fitting name for someone whose occupation is capturing dark wizards/witches, as wolves are known to serve the needs of their pack above all else, making Tonks somewhat wolf-like herself, not to mention her rebellious personality and that wolves are extremely wild animals. Further similarities between her and wolves include her having been sorted into Hufflepuff (whose dorms and common room are subterranean) much like the dens of wolves, and that she is a relative of Sirius Black (whose Animagus form is that of a dog, a distant cousin of the wolf).

Interestingly, it seems that Voldemort never paid any special attention to Bellatrix's niece before, though Tonks was the child from the scandalous marriage between Bellatrix's sister from the noble House of Black and a Muggle-born, as well as being a skilled Auror who fought against his minions. This instruction from the Dark Lord made Bellatrix more eager in deciding that killing Nymphadora was her priority. Delphini was born at the
