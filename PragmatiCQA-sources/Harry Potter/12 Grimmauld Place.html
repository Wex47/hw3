   during their occupation, as the organization was completely composed of such individuals. They covered the portrait with a curtain to attempt to minimize her attention but any loud noise would wake her again.
Much of the decor in the entry hall was in the form of serpents, though there was also an
   umbrella stand
   made from the severed leg of a

   On one side of the hallway was the dining room, which contained a long wooden table with chairs and hanging light fixtures. It also featured a dresser holding the

   A door at the far end of the entry hall, a set of narrow stone stairs leads to the basement, and the house’s kitchen. Though less ornate than the floors above, the kitchen was still a large, “cavernous” room with a large fireplace at the far end.
   Iron
   pots and pans hung from the ceiling above, and a long wooden table sits in the centre of the room, large enough to fit a couple dozen people around it for a meal. The room had a gloomy feeling when it was occupied by the

   Also in the basement, just off the kitchen, was a dark pantry, large enough for two people to stand in comfortably; and another cupboard off the kitchen housed the boiler for the house, as well as Kreacher’s den, filled with rags, smelly blankets, and photographs of the

   On the first floor, there are at least three rooms: a bedroom, where Hermione and Ginny once slept; a bathroom where Harry once ran when he was overcome with a vision of Voldemort; and, of the most significance, the drawing room.
  </p>
  <p key="babb4b45-2998-4c2b-801c-1f2cff363152">
   The drawing room was at one time exquisite, with large windows overlooking the street in front of the house, a large fireplace flanked by two ornate glass-fronted cabinets, and an entire wall covered with a tapestry of the Black family tree. In the summer of 1995, though, the room mostly just needed a good cleaning, as the curtains were filled with doxies, the writing desk housed a boggart, and the dark items in the cabinets — from snakeskins to bottles of blood to boxes of
   Wartcap Powder
   — were ready to put up a fight against anyone trying to clean them up.
   It was in this room that Kreacher stored Slytherin’s locket when he couldn’t get it open,
   and it was in this room that

   The second floor housed at least one bedroom, and possibly more. It was in this room that Harry and Ron slept during their first stay at Grimmauld Place. The room had two twin beds and a wardrobe, and like the rest of the house was gloomy, had lofty ceilings, and had a doorknob in the shape of a serpent.
   On the wall was a portrait of
   Phineas Nigellus Black
   (though Hermione later removed this),
   and in the corner there was a wastebasket that coughed when owl droppings were placed in it.

   Number 12, Grimmauld Place held many Black family heirlooms and possessions, such as a
   music box
   that played a sickly tune and tried to put the listener to sleep, crested goblets, a biting silver box containing
   Wartcap powder
   , and an unopenable locket which turned out to be Salazar Slytherin's Locket, one of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes.
   This was where
   Kreacher
   put the object after he drove himself mad not being able to complete his master's orders to destroy the locket because it had to be damaged past the point of repair, which was beyond the capabilities and understanding of the
   house-elf

   " of the Order of the Phoenix members that inhabited the house, due to Walburga's prejudice against such people. The portrait was usually closed off with curtains, which aimed to keep the portrait quiet, but are not very effective; any loud noise in the vicinity would cause the curtains to fly open, and Walburga to start raging and howling again until someone forced the curtains shut.
  </p>
  <p key="c2ddc650-2f0d-4e5c-9dc5-d5c21728f432">
   Many of these family heirlooms were stolen and peddled by
   Mundungus Fletcher
   , including Salazar Slytherin's Locket, which the thief was forced to give to none other than

    The inheritance of the property by
    Sirius Black
    is almost certainly governed by the magical equivalent of the English Common Law concept of the
    Under this type of arrangement, the inheritance of the covered property by the designated heir ("down the direct line, to the next male with the name of 'Black'") cannot be prevented by disinheritance or any other legal means. The only way the entail breaks is if there is no living descendant who matches the conditions of the entail. When the entail breaks, the property in question can be disposed of by any legal means, including being willed to any person the current holder so chooses. This legal mechanism matches the known circumstances of the inheritance, where the property was inherited by Sirius although he was "disowned", and then could be successfully left to Harry Potter once there was no "direct line, male descendant."
