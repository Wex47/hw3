   In 1980, at the height of the First Wizarding War, which lasted for eleven years (from 1970 to 1981),
   Sybill Trelawney
   , the great-great granddaughter of the famous seer and magical hypnotist
   Cassandra Trelawney

   . During the interview, Trelwaney suddenly entered into a heavy trance and predicted the future coming of the only person who could truly defeat and destroy Lord Voldemort, due to this particular wizard having strength, power, will, and most of all: a capability for
   Love
   , that would not only equal and surpass those of the Dark Lord, but those of Albus Dumbledore himself. As a result, Dumbledore hired Trelawney in order to protect her from the Death Eaters.

   , at the time a loyal high-ranking Death Eater, who immediately reported what he heard to Voldemort. The Dark Lord then became so fearful that he immediately began researching the location of his future archenemy, hoping to be able to eliminate him before he could become a true threat. After some searching, Voldemort came to heavily suspect that the prophecy referred to the offspring of someone within the Order of the Phoenix, the resistance movement founded and led by Albus Dumbledore against Voldemort and the Death Eaters. After researching the members of the Order, Voldemort concluded that there were only two possible candidates: Harry Potter; the only son of

   , and Neville Longbottom, the only son of
   Frank Longbottom
   and
   Alice Longbottom
   . Both boys were born at the end of July 1980, the referenced birth timeline in the prophecy. Voldemort deduced that the prophecy referred to Harry Potter, because he was a
   half-blood
   just like Voldemort himself whereas Neville Longbottom was a

   The Potters had indeed gone into hiding at the urgent request of Professor Dumbledore due to the severity of the events of the war, when Snape, who had been secretly in love with Lily Potter since childhood, desperately warned Dumbledore of the approaching utter danger, begging the legendary wizard to hide and protect the Potters at all costs. Dumbledore agreed, and requested Snape's loyalty and services in return. Snape instantly agreed, and he became Dumbledore's top spy/double agent within the Death Eaters, whilst also secretly defecting from the Death Eaters to the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore also hired Snape as the new

   Master at Hogwarts, and was informed regularly about Voldemort's movements, whilst ordering Snape to feed Voldemort valuable information about the Order, so as to keep Snape's true allegiance a total secret. Dumbledore then placed the Potters under the
   Fidelius Charm
   , making it impossible for even Voldemort to find them alone. However, on Hallowe'en, 31 October 1981, their location in

After killing James Potter, who did not have his wand and tried to hold off Voldemort defenceless, Voldemort entered Harry's room and ordered Lily Potter to step aside, offering her the chance to save herself if she willingly let him kill the infant Harry. Voldemort also wished to grant the request of Severus Snape, who had begged him to spare Lily out of his lifelong love for her. Being his top Death Eater who Voldemort allowed to operate freely, Voldemort wished to honour Snape, but, since Lily disobeyed Voldemort's order to abandon her son a second time, Voldemort murdered her as well. He then turned his wand on Harry, but the

   As part of his plan, in January 1996, Voldemort secretly ordered a mass breakout of several top-security Death Eaters from the
   Azkaban

   Dementors

Voldemort had very little trouble arranging this, as the Dementors were more than happy to oblige to his dark whims and had grown tired of the laws put in place by the wizarding world, particularly the Ministry Of Magic.
  </p>
  <p key="ffeb9c9b-5830-48b1-848f-c09e805ae3b1">
   The Ministry, however, openly refused to believe that Voldemort had returned out of paranoia and fear of causing public hysteria, and instead blamed the breakout on Order member
   Sirius Black
   , who had been wrongly accused and convicted of the deaths of James and Lily Potter for thirteen years.
   Because the Ministry did not believe that Voldemort had returned and because he now had many of his greatest servants ready to do his bidding, Voldemort did not even attempt to retrieve the prophecy he sought himself, as he considered such a thing to be beneath him and being seen by the wizarding community would likely ruin his plans and was not an option. The Death Eaters then made a few secret attempts at stealing the prophecy in question, but all the attempts ended in utter failure.

Voldemort predicted that Harry would immediately race to the Ministry to save him, as he knew that Harry would be compelled by nature to help the people closest to him, particularly if said person was the only family left to him.

   Blasting Curse
   . Luna was then hit by an Impediment Jinx from one of the Death Eaters, sending her into the air before hitting a desk and falling to the floor, out for the count. Ron, in his confused state,
   summoned
   a brain from the tank and was injured by it as it attempted to strangle him with tentacles. Harry then used a
   Severing Charm
   to try and free Ron from the attacking brain, and at the same moment Ginny took a Stunning Spell to the face from another Death Eater, and was knocked unconscious. In a desperate attempt to draw the Death Eaters away from his injured friends, Harry sprinted deep into the
   Death Chamber
   , where he descended down to the centre of the chamber, next to its magical archway, where he was ultimately cornered by the rest of the Death Eaters. When Neville arrived to help, Bellatrix briefly and easily used the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on him in an attempt to coerce Harry into handing over the prophecy, warning Potter that Longbottom would slowly be tortured to death  if he refused them any longer. Harry, who did not think he had any other choice, decided to give in to their demands.

   Tonks fired a formidable Stunning Spell at Malfoy, giving Harry and Neville enough time to escape unseen, but Harry was then grabbed from behind by
   Walden Macnair
   and nearly choked. Neville then jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater's mask, making him release Harry with a "howl of pain". Harry then angrily hit Macnair with the
   Stunning Spell
   . He saw Sirius fighting a Death Eater, Kingsley fighting two and Tonks fighting Bellatrix. Harry was then cornered by Dolohov, who had managed to hit Moody with an Impediment Jinx to the head, rendering him temporarily unconscious. Dolohov then hit Neville with the
   Dancing Feet Spell
   and attempted to use the same dangerous unnamed curse on Harry that he previously used on Hermione, though the curses's lethal effects were prevented by Harry’s

   Once again, Harry and Neville tried to escape, but were stopped by Malfoy. Harry then passed Neville the prophecy and then used a powerful
   Impediment Jinx
   to blast Malfoy aside. Before Lucius could attack again, Lupin jumped between them and told Harry and Neville to get the other D.A. members and leave. As they tried to do this, the prophecy fell through Neville's pocket and shattered.

    Albus Dumbledore

   arrived through the same door the Order members had come through, his wand aloft and utter fury in every line of his face. Speeding past Harry and Neville, Dumbledore instead charged right into the middle of the fray, as the first Death Eaters suddenly realised he was there. There was a roar of shock, and the Death Eaters instantly attempted to flee out of utter fear of duelling him. One Death Eater fled up the side of the chamber in such terror, but Dumbledore quickly intercepted him with a simple blocking Spell.

  <p key="dcf45a9e-3523-4dd8-bf8e-e17720587f81">
   Only Sirius and Bellatrix were totally oblivious to Dumbledore's arrival, as both were still heavily duelling below next to the chamber archway, with Sirius easily ducking and blocking her spells, all the while taunting her failure to hit him with them. At that precise moment, Bellatrix fired another spell at Sirius, hitting him directly in the chest and causing his body to fall into the archway's Veil that separates the world of the living from that of the dead. Lupin then prevented Harry from jumping into the Veil after Sirius by grabbing him in a tight hug, telling him that his godfather was dead and that nothing could be done.

   Bellatrix, yelling triumphantly, then began running up the chamber steps to escape and Dumbledore immediately turned around and fired a spell at her, but she blocked it. Harry, maddened with grief and anger at his godfather's death, heavily pursued Bellatrix out of the Department of Mysteries and up to the Ministry's Main Atrium, intending to kill her to avenge Sirius. She then turned to face him, forcing him to take cover behind the
   Fountain of Magical Brethren
   . Filled with hatred at her baby-like taunting, Harry surprisingly hit her with the
   Cruciatus Curse

   The two then traded Stunning Spells, causing further damage to the fountain before Bellatrix ordered Harry to surrender the prophecy, telling him that he could not win against her, as she claimed to be Voldemort's most powerful and loyal servant, revealing that she had personally learned the Dark Arts from him. However, Harry laughingly taunted her with the knowledge that the prophecy was destroyed even as his scar suddenly exploded with pain, indicating that Voldemort was in a secret rage. Bellatrix, in fearful hysteria, accused him of lying but upon realising that it was true began begging her master not to punish her. Still laughing, Harry told her not to waste her breath because Voldemort could not hear her, only for a cold sinister voice to claim otherwise. Hooded and snake-faced,

   bewitched
   the statue to protect Harry. Voldemort, shocked and fearful, then shot a Killing Curse at Dumbledore, who instantly Disapparated and re-appeared behind Voldemort; proceeding to direct his wand at the fountain's other statues, which leapt to do the legendary wizard's bidding as well. The witch statue then immobilised Bellatrix by pinning her underneath it whilst the goblin and house-elf statues departed to warn Ministry officials via the nearby

   Throughout the battle, it became quickly obvious that Dumbledore was the more powerful and skilled out of them, heavily dominating the fight, despite outlining his peaceful intentions, while Voldemort, in a heated rage, was completely unable to come even close to penetrate Dumbledore's defences, all the while he was forced to immediately go all-out to simply defend from Albus's own stream of attacks. After a brief exchange of displeasantries, Voldemort fired another Killing Curse at Dumbledore, which hit the security desk next to the fountain, causing it to "burst into flames". Dumbledore retaliated with an unknown spell of such power and force that Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver magical shield out of thin air to deflect it. Whatever the spell was, it caused a gong-like denture in the shield, but was otherwise not intended to be lethal, something which Voldemort called Dumbledore out on before resuming the duel with yet another Killing Curse. This was taken by the centaur statue, shattering it into a hundred pieces, while Dumbledore conjured a rope of fire that bound the Dark Lord "shield and all", forcing him to transfigure it into a serpent which released him and turned on Dumbledore while he tried to take Dumbledore from behind with yet another Killing Curse. However,
   Fawkes
   , Dumbledore's
   phoenix
   , appeared out of nowhere and swallowed Voldemort's curse, which had no actual permanent effect on Fawkes since phoenixes can be reborn every time they die. Dumbledore then swiftly vanished the snake, turning it into mere black smoke with a casual flick of his wand, and then manipulated the water in the fountain to encase Voldemort, from which Voldemort could not break himself out from and was forced to disapparate again, finally realising he was fighting a losing battle from the beginning.

   In a last-ditch effort to have Harry killed, Voldemort then briefly turned himself invisible and secretly possessed Harry, hoping that Dumbledore would actually sacrifice the teenager in an attempt to kill the Dark Lord. However, Dumbledore did not take the bait at all and as Harry dwelt on his grief for his late godfather, the power of his
   love
   for not only Sirius, but for Dumbledore and his friends, caused Voldemort serious pain, forcing him to release Harry instantly. As Dumbledore tended to Harry, Voldemort, knowing fully well he was greatly outmatched at long last, grabbed Bellatrix and escaped along with her by disapparating away but only after he was visibly seen by a horde of Ministry officials that had just arrived, including

Indeed, he had no trouble recognising Malfoy in the Hall of Prophecy even though Malfoy was masked the entire time. It is hard to believe Rowling would intend Malfoy to be among this pair without ever identifying him. Harry also knows Macnair &amp; Avery - not as well as he knows Malfoy, but he does know them, Macnair in particular, whom he's seen and overheard in conversation (Harry probably knows Macnair better than Macnair knows Harry). Although this is less certain, it is hard to believe Rowling would intend Macnair to be among this pair and not identify him.
