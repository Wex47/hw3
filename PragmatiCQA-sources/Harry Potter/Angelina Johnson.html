   Quidditch captain,

   and authority to determine the composition of the team (excepting those undergoing punishments). She proved to be at least as demanding of her team as

   had been. She attributed this hard-driving attitude to the stress of the job, saying that she regretted having been so hard on Wood when he was Quidditch captain. Angelina had difficulty finding talent and was plagued with a year of practises most of them ending in shambles.

  <p key="f53c9eaa-2663-4fca-b5a6-7720edbcfedd">
   Her first duty as Quidditch captain was managing tryouts on the first Friday of term to fill Oliver Wood's keeper position. Upon learning Harry had to serve detention that day, Angelina was angry at him, deciding that it was his fault, and ordered him to say whatever he had to say to get out of detention and be there for tryouts, something he failed to do. After she had gone, Harry commented that they should check with
   Puddlemere United
   and see if Oliver Wood was still alive, as Angelina seemed to be channelling his spirit.

  <p key="45b82ed3-eea9-43dd-b0f2-f2f66594b8c7">
   Finding that Harry was not able to convince Umbridge to change his Friday detention, Angelina angrily suggested that people who wanted to stay on the team would find a way to make it to practises. Friday evening, after the try-outs, Angelina apologised to Harry for her earlier curtness, and said that she may have been too hard on Wood; she found managing the team to be a bit stressful.

She likely had already decided to keep returning members on the team as she previously called them "Keeper tryouts," stated she wanted to see how candidates fitted in with the team, and didn't require Harry to try out.  Their first practise as a team was marred with jeers and catcalls by Slytherins, including an insult to Angelina's braided hair.

   They drilled by passing the
   Quaffle
   . Ron missed it twice, but after catching it passed it so hard to Katie it hit her face and caused a nosebleed. Fred gave her a purple sweet. They released the other balls and took to flying until Angelina blew the whistle to stop, then criticised Ron for wandering off, letting in goals and told him to either stay in center position or circle the goals.  Katie's nose was still bleeding, and three minutes later Angelina stopped and ended practise; saying Katie needed the hospital wing. Fred realized he gave her a Blood Blisterpod by mistake and, with George, flew her to the castle.

   Upon reading the sign, Angelina immediately realised Quidditch was included and on the verge of tears implored Harry to keep his temper with Umbridge in order to get permission to re-form the team. Harry agreed and did so when she was inspecting his Potions class and again in Umbridge's own class. Nevertheless, upon asking Umbridge, she replied she needed time to consider, despite that morning approving the Slytherin team, which meant Gryffindors couldn't practise Quidditch that night. Angelina had intended to teach them the
   Sloth Grip Roll.
   The next day, Angelina told Ron and Harry during break that she got permission to reform the Gryffindor Quidditch team after she went to McGonagall who appealed to Dumbledore who insisted Umbridge allow them to play.

She said they were the usual gorillas unlikely to fly very well. As they left the locker room they heard Slytherins singing for the first time "
