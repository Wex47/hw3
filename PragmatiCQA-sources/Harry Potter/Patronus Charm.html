   According to legend, one of the most famous Patronuses of all time was a lowly
   mouse
   , which belonged to a young wizard called
   Illyius
   . Illyius cast the Patronus Charm when his village was being attacked by the Dark wizard Raczidian and his army of
   Dementors
   . Despite the mouse's diminutive size, it shone with a brilliant light, bringing the Dementors to a halt as it nimbly moved through the ranks of fleeing villagers.
   Enraged,
   Raczidian
   decided to enter the fray himself. He tried to summon a Patronus to ward off Illyius's mouse.

  <p key="2fcc7aa0-23a2-4414-8e09-0ff50f20bd9d">
   However, Raczidian failed to remember that only the pure of heart could produce a Patronus. Thus, for the first time in history, it was revealed what happened when a competent, but unworthy wizard or witch attempted the spell. Maggots shot out of Raczidian's wand and quickly devoured him as they engulfed his entire body. The villagers then hailed Illyius as a hero.

   The Patronus represented that which was hidden, unknown but necessary within the personality. When a human was confronted with inhuman evil, such as the
   Dementor
   , they must draw upon resources he or she may never have needed, and the Patronus was the awakened secret self that lay dormant until needed, but which must now be brought to light. Patronuses took forms that their casters might not expect, for which they had never felt a particular affinity, or (in rare cases) even recognised. Every Patronus was as unique as its creator and even identical twins had been known to produce very different Patronuses.

    Harry Potter

   was one of the youngest known wizards able to cast a Patronus; he was taught how to do so in early 1994 at the age of thirteen by
   Remus Lupin
   .
   In a
   Dumbledore's Army
   lesson, Harry taught the members how to use the charm. Some were even successful in casting a corporeal form, though Harry said this might be because there was no
   Dementor
   to make them frightened.
   However, three members were later able to cast corporeal Patronuses in the presence of Dementors.
   Being able to cast a patronus, whilst fighting Dementors or not, was not required to graduate from Hogwarts, so it was something that was taught under special circumstances.

   Amelia Bones
   and potential members of the
   D.A.
   were all very impressed when Harry Potter revealed that he could cast not only a Patronus Charm but a corporeal one to boot, which was notably more difficult than casting an incorporeal one. Given that the success of the charm was directly reliant on the caster retaining a particular mental state, the Charm was more difficult to cast in emotionally trying circumstances. For instance, Harry Potter,
   <a href="Ronald Weasley.html" key="433321f2-804e-43db-9ad3-5661cf9c8cd1" title="Ronald Weasley">

   This feature of the Charm was particularly unfortunate since the Charm's primary use was to defend against Dementors, dark creatures specifically equipped to mentally unhinge people (and hence was partly why it was regarded as such advanced, difficult magic).
  </p>
  <p key="c315ed3d-b93e-464b-b271-db87884fd9de">
   Self-confidence might also play an important role in casting the spell. In 1994, Harry was able to cast the
   spell
   successfully, driving off a large number of Dementors in the process (which, according to
   <a href="Severus Snape.html" key="1ff08633-9b5f-4305-aff6-66651dbffa02" title="Severus Snape">

   An incorporeal
   Patronus was one which did not resemble any living creature and had few distinguishing features (if any). Incorporeal Patronuses resembled a burst of vapour or smoke without any clearly defined form shooting from the tip of the wand. While they might be partially effective at halting Dementors (but not repelling them) and shielding the caster from them, incorporeal Patronuses were not "fully-fledged" Patronuses, and were regarded as a simpler and weaker version of the Charm.

   A corporeal Patronus was one that was fully-formed, taking the shape of a bright-silver, translucent animal. It was the strongest form a Patronus could take, being able to fully drive Dementors away. The specific animal forms that a corporeal Patronus took would vary from person to person and reflect each individual's innermost personality.
  </p>
  <p key="cdcc4069-80b0-41e2-981a-aa7e6c7c91a1">
   Patronus forms, however, were subject to change if the caster went through an emotional upheaval of some sort, including falling in eternal, unchanging
   love
   .
   For example,
   Nymphadora Tonks
   's Patronus changed from its previous form to that of a four-legged creature which others guessed was a
   wolf
   because then it would reflect her love for
   Remus Lupin
   , himself a werewolf.
   Another example was Severus Snape, whose Patronus was that of a doe, the same as
   <a href="Lily J. Potter.html" key="eef61882-0a76-47b7-8a73-72d7cc1653f2" title="Lily J. Potter">
    Lily Evans

   , though this may have been the case all along rather than a change from its original form, as Snape was in love with Lily for most of his life.
  </p>
  <p key="cf95be16-e229-4e04-be74-5fe070b294c4">
   Based on the fact that Patronuses were conjured by recalling happy memories, it stands to reason that a Patronus might change its form after one fell in love and the memories used to conjure the Patronus largely revolved around the person the caster was in love with. In addition, it seemed that some couples had "
   <i key="02e85505-23ed-419d-9ad4-b220c1c4dda1">
    complementary
   </i>
   " Patronuses (male and female forms of the same animal), such as Lily and

   . It is, however, unknown if this was a coincidence or not. If a wizard was an

   Remus Lupin's Patronus took the form of a wolf, rather than a werewolf. Whether or not all werewolves would generate a similar Patronus is unknown. It stands to reason that it was likely due to Remus's best memories of his youth revolving around the acceptance he felt despite his condition, in which he felt more at home in his wolf form during those times, rather than cursed by it and also due to his nature as desiring a sense of belonging at his core, much like a true wolf.

   Most Patronuses took the form of an ordinary animal. Magical creatures, such as

    Uses
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="99396613-cab2-44e7-b900-672a01ccdb0a">
   There were two known uses for the Patronus Charm. The first and main use of the Patronus was to drive off certain
   dark
   creatures, such as
   Dementors
   and
   Lethifolds
   and was the only known charm that would work against them. As Dementors fed on happy memories, causing humans to drown in their own sorrow and sadness, the Patronus acted as a shield of sorts, of which the Dementor would try to feed off instead — the Patronus was comprised exclusively of positive feelings and couldn't comprehend negative emotion, so the Dementor's influence couldn't affect it.
  </p>
  <p key="dacb05a3-a399-468c-a6af-1e67d160b981">
   The other use was devised by
   <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="6984dbff-3ef6-4307-9f6b-0ddb7c9439ed" title="Albus Dumbledore">
    Albus Dumbledore
   </a>
   , who invented a way of using the Patronus (corporeal and incorporeal) as a means of communication. They could deliver messages, speaking with the voice of the caster. This source of communication was believed to be exclusive to the members of the
   <a href="Order of the Phoenix.html" key="c0d95a36-e548-48e1-a96d-af2c461df45e" title="Order of the Phoenix">
    Order of the Phoenix
   </a>
   . Using the Patronus for communication offered great advantages in security, as Patronuses identified the caster and were
   Dark Arts
   -proof.
   A good example of this was when
   <a href="Minerva McGonagall.html" key="0bd95577-e6a9-40a2-8028-7b308e234efa" title="Minerva McGonagall">

   used her feline Patronus to call for help to the other
   Heads of Houses

   .
  </p>
  <p key="cb9c8554-1926-4871-8f7f-2c4aaa49abec">
   Multiple Patronuses could be cast for communication, as McGonagall was able to create three. Another was when
   <a href="Severus Snape.html" key="1a5fcf1b-2a6d-41a5-96aa-156a5e179548" title="Severus Snape">
    Severus Snape

   used his Patronus to lead Harry Potter to a pool in the
   Forest of Dean
   in 1997, where he had laid the

   </a>
   for Harry to retrieve. It is unknown if Snape had conjured the Patronus with instructions or if he was hiding and controlling it for this task. Harry's Patronus was able to follow both oral and physical commands. They also only remained active whilst the caster was focusing on them. If they were not protecting anyone, Patronuses seemed to take on the traits of the creature they resembled and generally followed their caster around. This made it unsure whether or not they were sentient.
