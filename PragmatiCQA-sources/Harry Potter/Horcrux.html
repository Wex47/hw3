   Given that Horcruxes were precious to those who made them, there were usually protective measures made to prevent them from being stolen or destroyed, such as
   counter-charms
   and

   , which was once held in
   Hogwarts' library
   (and later in Dumbledore's office). Due to the book's extremely dark and dangerous nature, Albus Dumbledore hid it away in his

   . It was believed that Tom Riddle had found the information necessary to make a Horcrux in this book before Dumbledore managed to get hold of it. While a Horcrux could be anything at all, including a living being, it was most advisable to create a Horcrux out of an inanimate object to decrease the chances of it being destroyed.
  </p>
  <p key="2e3a46a7-1073-4157-8817-3d0a59303862">
   Horcruxes by their nature appeared to be extraordinarily durable, as only very destructive magic and processes could truly destroy them.
  </p>
  <p key="b2b7d40f-1ee7-4547-aae1-2308978e783b">
   To create a Horcrux, a wizard first had to deliberately commit murder. Killing out of self-defence or to protect another would not suffice; one had to deliberately and consciously murder a person without regret or remorse. This act, said to be the most supreme act of evil, would result in the murderer metaphysically damaging their own soul. A wizard who wished to create a Horcrux would then use that damage to their advantage by casting
   a spell
   which would sever the damaged portion of the soul and encase it in an object.
   If the maker was later killed, they would continue to exist in a non-corporeal form,
   although there were methods of regaining a physical body.
   However, according to
   <a href="Horace Slughorn.html" key="84688fa4-11cd-4981-ae61-33b0bbb6a501" title="Horace Slughorn">
    Horace Slughorn

   , few would want to live in such a form, and death would be preferable to most, and he found the concept so dreadful that he wished not to know the process of creating such a vile object.
  </p>
  <p key="e24067fc-5cbf-4956-85c8-4017509d5ffe">
   As a fragment of soul, a Horcrux seemed to retain the identity of its creator at the time of its creation. Voldemort, for instance, created a Horcrux (his diary) during what was presumably his fifth year at Hogwarts. As such, the fragment of soul contained within the Horcrux took on the appearance and mannerisms of Voldemort as he had been when he was sixteen years old.
  </p>
  <p key="c0ba4fa8-c546-42fd-82af-599c680ace57">
   Horcruxes were said to be essentially the opposite of a person. Where a person's container, their body, could be destroyed without any damage to their soul, the fragment of soul contained inside a Horcrux was dependent on the container for its existence. If the container was destroyed, so too would be the fragment of soul within it.
  </p>
  <p key="303b834a-8555-46a8-ba32-4cbff5689f08">
   Horcruxes were originally conceived of as being a singular act. As such, it was unknown for many centuries what the attempted creation of multiple Horcruxes would result in, as nobody thought it possible to accomplish such an act. However, Voldemort planned to create six Horcruxes in the hope that it would make him stronger than just creating one, due to his belief in the power of the number seven.

   "
   in creating his Horcruxes. This implied a finite number of Horcruxes any one person may create before the process became too dangerous to attempt again. It also implied that the creation of a Horcrux used a set amount of soul and that this amount was the same every time the process was undertaken. Creating multiple Horcruxes rendered the soul unstable and liable to break apart if the creator of the Horcruxes was killed.

  </h2>
  <p key="1e6eabd3-3eb8-425c-a4b1-c716cf0a44a2">
   The main purpose and power of a Horcrux was to anchor the creator to the mortal realm for the sake of achieving
   immortality
   . As long as at least one Horcrux existed, the creator's soul would be bound to the world of the living. Hence, if the body was destroyed, the soul would remain as a lingering spirit instead of passing through to the other side. Though being in such a state of existence was what very few would prefer over death, the soul could possess others to regain physical form, which shortened the host's lifespan drastically.
   It was also possible (through a second party) to use certain potions to create a
   rudimentary body
   or even the
   true body
   of the Horcrux creator's soul to possess.
   Because of this purpose, a Horcrux was usually kept hidden and dormant, and its other powers were rarely explored or utilised.
  </p>
  <p key="845280e0-1fee-4d80-99ea-dc5d2269dad2">
   The fragment of a person's soul within a Horcrux was capable of thinking for itself and had certain magical abilities, including the ability to influence those in their vicinity and affect them mentally. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione were carrying Salazar Slytherin's locket around their necks in 1997, it brought out the worst in the trio by making them moodier, more prone to fighting, and slowly darker aspects of them began to appear, especially Ron as he carried the locket much longer than his friends.
  </p>
  <p key="ced007f3-94db-43ab-bd29-25778c31cda5">
   However, when away from a Horcrux its influence and effects would begin to wane and then disappear and those influenced would return to their normal selves, as soon after leaving Ron came to his senses and regretted his actions. They were also unable to summon their
   <a href="Patronus Charm.html" key="4331f522-ea74-4ce7-8488-cbb8ddc308b8" title="Patronus Charm">
    Patronuses
   </a>
   while wearing the locket since the soul fragment inside was darkening their thoughts. A person with an affinity for the
   Dark Arts
   , on the other hand, would be strengthened by the influence of a Horcrux, as

  </p>
  <p key="8f1ff565-dd26-4bdb-8fe9-cbc01bdaf782">
   If a person was more emotionally vulnerable, it was possible for the soul inside the Horcrux to take control of him or her, as Ginny Weasley using her. In fact, Voldemort took advantage of this possessive power over Ginny to reopen the Chamber of Secrets, using the diary as a weapon rather than a safeguard.
   Voldemort himself was able to possess Harry Potter and take control of his mind when Harry was heartbroken over
   Sirius Black
   's death and angry enough to perform the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on

   and almost perform the Killing Curse on her. This quasi-sentient entity that was capable of sapping life-force to create a physical form differed from a "
   <i key="0ac427db-bba7-41a2-bbf3-75e2288d8f67">

    memory

   ", which the diary's manifestation claimed itself to be, as no mere charmed object could achieve such a feat, though

   thought that was what the diary simply was.
  </p>
  <p key="b9ef09dd-1830-4da5-9434-1ff65ccb3825">
   In this way, a Horcrux could gradually feed on another person's life or negative emotions to strengthen itself and increase the ability of the soul fragment within to act independently in the physical world. The best example of this was in the case of
   <a href="T. M. Riddle's Diary.html" key="3bcb6d62-ef09-46a7-82d9-fefb31df16ee" title="T. M. Riddle's Diary">

    Lucius Malfoy
   </a>
   's possession, doing nothing other than safeguarding the soul fragment of Tom Riddle. When Ginny Weasley began to transcribe her fears and insecurities into the pages of the diary, the fragment of Tom Riddle's soul contained within was not only able to write back to Ginny but eventually drained enough life out of her to actually manifest itself in a semi-corporeal form and work magic with
   <a href="Harry Potter.html" key="3e77ff35-2d2e-4b1c-9a4d-ac31a323da25" title="Harry Potter">

    Salazar Slytherin's locket
   </a>
   slowly gained power when it was in the possession of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the months prior to its destruction. It can be theorised that the locket gained somewhat less power from them (not enough for Riddle to fully manifest but still enough to speak and create illusions) because Harry, Ron, and Hermione were actively resisting the locket's influence instead of embracing it as Ginny had done with the diary.
  </p>
  <p key="1f31c2ed-09bb-4733-8eb3-52db013e4635">
   On the other hand, Horcruxes which have been isolated for long periods of time (such as
   Helga Hufflepuff's cup
   and
   <a href="Ravenclaw's Diadem.html" key="bc0619d2-9c87-4c7b-8695-a2fbbf11aa90" title="Ravenclaw's Diadem">
    Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem
   </a>
   ) were very passive by comparison and took no real measures to protect themselves. Even Slytherin's locket was fairly inert when it was initially discovered in a cabinet in the drawing-room at 12 Grimmauld Place. It displayed no powers and gave no indication that it possessed superior magical properties.
  </p>
  <p key="87985ef6-11b0-4a19-bb52-fe1a4e6cd502">
   Horcruxes also possessed some last line of defence against destruction. The fragment of soul within the Horcrux seems to be able to sense impending threats and can act to defend itself. For instance, Slytherin's locket viciously taunted Ron Weasley with visions of his deepest fears in the hopes of preventing him from stabbing it with
   Godric Gryffindor's sword
   , and even attempted to strangle Harry Potter when he was close to obtaining the Sword with the intent of piercing the locket.
  </p>
  <p key="dd772cfe-9a11-409c-84d2-f3ee3d2deaa6">
   However, this form of defence may not be viable if the soul fragment in question is not given enough strength or chance to retaliate, as while Harry opened the locket with
   Parseltongue
   before allowing Ron to attack it, both Hufflepuff's Cup and Ravenclaw's Diadem were swiftly destroyed the moment the trio were given an opportunity.
  </p>
  <p key="4ccc640f-ad5c-4a66-b32b-12f3c41ddaef">
   Aside from its self-defence mechanism from the soul fragment, a Horcrux is usually enchanted by the creator to have other forms of defences to prevent destruction.
   Marvolo Gaunt's ring
   contained a
   deadly curse
   that would kill anyone who touched it.

   whether they were characteristics of a person who had been resurrected with the help of serpents (which had continued to play key roles in his revival), or whether due to any other alterations he had made to himself. Dumbledore speculated that Voldemort underwent other dangerous transformations, as well as creating Horcruxes which resulted in Voldemort's hideous appearance.

   . The rest of Voldemort's mutilated soul fled.
   However, this parasitic fragment of Voldemort's soul that attached to Harry did not make him a true Horcrux, since it was not created intentionally and the necessary parts of the Horcrux creation process were not carried out.

Regardless, reconciliation apparently cannot occur after death, as the soul's state at death remains forever, so the greatest of all consequences incurred by Horcrux creation may be the possibility of eternal limbo of the soul. Voldemort's soul fragments also appeared to possess only the awareness and intelligence of the infant they appeared to be.

   removed those books from the

   soon afterwards, although later he suspected that Slughorn had given information to Riddle about Horcruxes, as Slughorn refused to reveal the true account of what really happened. Voldemort did understand that his soul had a limit to how many times he could split it, as he ceased creating any more Horcruxes once he intentionally reached his desired six and refused to create any replacements for the ones that were destroyed.

  <p key="a67530d0-292f-4e1e-abfd-7bcd54da4004">
   Dumbledore later assigned Harry to retrieve the
   stored memory
   of it during the 1996-1997 school year, in which Harry was able to get it through the use of
   Felix Felicis
   .
   Although Voldemort had been warned that the usage of Horcruxes would render one's soul to live a miserable existence should their living flesh be destroyed, and Voldemort even experienced this first hand for fourteen years, he would regardless prefer to live in such a state when the alternative was death, which he feared the most because he regarded it as a shameful and ignominious human weakness, since he was willing to continue his creation of his

   </a>
   even in his crippled form.
   Voldemort's streak of independence made it intolerable for him to utilise any other methods to obtain his immortality (such as the
   Elixir of Life
   ); he chose to rely on Horcruxes because they were magical extensions of himself.
  </p>
  <p key="b26ba8cd-5125-49b2-b199-8b4fbc29bbc0">
   Having split his soul multiple times, it became extremely unstable that upon his Killing Curse's first rebound on him, Voldemort's already maimed soul split apart and attached to the only living being in the room at the time: Harry Potter. It was also the creation of so many Horcruxes that led Voldemort's humanity to deteriorate severely. As Voldemort's soul fragments have been separated from him for so long, he could no longer feel them should they be destroyed.
  </p>
  <p key="fab9983a-930c-498d-b7ca-d5ae8ae55736">
   This was part of Dumbledore and Harry's quest to determine, locate, and destroy, in secret, what they believed to be as many as four of Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes (two had already been destroyed). After Dumbledore's death, Harry took up the quest with his friends

   to aid them in their research on Horcruxes.
  </p>
  <p key="d4f9c6dc-b5d1-4fbb-916c-d70886487d69">
   Although Voldemort had six true Horcruxes (not including Harry) in total, no more than five existed at one time because
   Tom Riddle's diary
   was destroyed before Nagini was turned into a Horcrux. Concerning Nagini, it is not known if she had to have been killed by
   Godric Gryffindor's Sword
   or if any other means, such as a regular sword killing her, would have destroyed the Horcrux. However, as Albus Dumbledore stated, using a living being as a Horcrux was a risky business, due to it being able to move around and think for itself.
   It is unknown if any method that would normally kill Nagini would also destroy the Horcrux. It is also unknown what would happen if Nagini had died a natural death, or if that were possible, since Horcruxes have mechanisms in place to prevent destruction.
  </p>
  <p key="a8b818aa-ad9c-4989-a2ce-daebee90494c">
   All of Voldemort's Horcruxes were made from objects that had extreme monetary, historical or (in as much as he could feel) sentimental value, in his desire to secure his position as the greatest sorcerer in history, and that only noteworthy items could live up to his standards and have the honour of housing a fragment of his precious
   <a href="Soul.html" key="a1d93a18-d6bc-4d18-9acd-9b4e9e8e86fb" title="Soul">
    soul
   </a>
   . As such, he had originally made it his desire to collect four items of the four founders of
   <a href="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.html" key="a2479982-9641-4786-a4f5-c648c8efba82" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">

   </a>
   ; he found only three, and gave up after failing to find
   <a href="Sword of Gryffindor.html" key="c011c7ee-65ad-415e-a8e8-16adcc6e8eeb" title="Sword of Gryffindor">
    Gryffindor's sword
   </a>
   , but made Horcruxes out of other items that had sentimental value to himself, if not as a priceless artefact of the Wizarding world. Believing that the number seven is the most powerful number when it comes to magic, Voldemort intended to split his soul into seven pieces, with six Horcruxes housing one fragment each and his body containing the seventh.
  </p>
  <p key="34fd4338-6380-41d9-85b5-d892f115f349">
   He hid these Horcruxes in special locations and kept their existence and purposes from absolutely everyone. However, his arrogance had also inadvertently let him leave behind subtle hints of their whereabouts, leading to their destruction. Because Voldemort was the first (and by far, the only) known wizard to have created more than one Horcrux, both Dumbledore and Voldemort himself believed that he was the closest to true immortality than any other wizard or witch before him.
  </p>
  <p key="5f6d0c53-1045-4138-a0ec-96171ca9d408">
   A secondary reason why Voldemort chose to create multiple Horcruxes is to utilise the effects of having a soul fragment to weaponise some of these artefacts, as opposed to keeping them as hidden safeguards. Voldemort felt more comfortable placing these few Horcruxes in the risk of destruction knowing he had more hidden safely to maintain his immortality. It was for this reason he chose to use

  </p>
  <p key="ba5161b1-5123-48c8-8366-c91fa4f74f5f">
   Although Voldemort created multiple Horcruxes so that if one was destroyed, it would not be detrimental to him, he would nevertheless be furious if any one of them were destroyed. He was wrathful at
   <a href="Lucius Malfoy.html" key="ef9431f9-378b-4b4c-8c85-60f638d6bad7" title="Lucius Malfoy">
    Lucius Malfoy
   </a>
   for indirectly causing the destruction of the diary Horcrux,
   despite intending for it to be a weapon instead of a safeguard, due to Lucius acting without instruction. When Voldemort found out that Hufflepuff's cup was taken, he massacred all the Gringotts employees within the bank that failed to protect the cup. Discovering that
   Slytherin's locket
   and the Gaunt family ring were taken from their hiding places infuriated him even more, though it became more understandable as he was aware that he was losing more Horcruxes as time went on.
   His arrogance prevented him from adding more defences for the Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw, which led to its destruction. He went out of his way to protect his last Horcrux, Nagini, and was horrified and angry beyond words when she was killed by

    's inherited abilities. It also creates a mental link between the two the strength of which seems to depend upon the strength of the creator. For example, when Voldemort was weak and only in a spiritual form, Harry could only sense his presence when he was close by and feel his anger, but after he returned to somewhat of a body, this expanded a bit into the occasional dream vision of things happening with Voldemort. After Voldemort returned to full power, this link expanded so that Harry got full visions in his dreams of what Voldemort was dwelling upon, but the link can also be two-way and Voldemort was able to use it and Legilimency to implant a false vision in Harry's mind. The link can be shut off with Occlumency on the part of one of the two with the link, but if the Occlumency slips, the link can reopen. The only way to sever the link completely and remove the abilities the Horcrux gives is to destroy the Horcrux itself.

    It is debatable if the Killing Curse can destroy inanimate Horcruxes, although given the extreme measures Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to go through to obtain Basilisk venom to destroy the Horcruxes they found during their
    search
    , it seems unlikely. It is also possible that none of them were capable of performing the curse, as successfully executing an unforgivable curse requires dark intentions, making it nearly impossible for a non-dark wizard to do.

    According to Dumbledore, Voldemort was preserving the creation of his Horcruxes for significant deaths. However, this stands to be another one of Dumbledore's deductions being wrong, as Voldemort has used a
    Muggle tramp
    and
    Albanian peasant
    to create two of his Horcruxes, with no known significance for the two. However, Dumbledore only knew for certain of two of the murders committed to create Voldemort's Horcruxes: the murder of
    Moaning Myrtle
    (his very first killing) to create the diary, and murder of

    Interestingly, no one destroyed more than two Horcruxes (counting Quirrell) and half of them were destroyed by someone other than Harry, Ron, and Hermione. (This does not apply to the films, however, as Harry (and Ron, to an extent) destroy the diadem, which is destroyed by Crabbe in the book.) The majority of the people who destroyed Voldemort's Horcruxes didn't know what they were destroying at the time. Neville didn't know what Horcruxes were when he killed Nagini, Harry didn't know about Horcruxes when he destroyed the diary, Voldemort didn't know he was destroying a Horcrux when he attempted to kill Harry Potter, and Vincent Crabbe didn't know what he was destroying when he destroyed the diadem. Hermione, Ron, and Dumbledore all knew that they were destroying Horcruxes, which was exactly what they were trying to do.

    The books previously established that Voldemort can't feel when a Horcrux is destroyed. However, this was completely reversed in the movies. That is the reason he starts on the journey of seeing if all the Horcruxes are safe in the books, but in the movies it is unclear if he even checks his hiding spots. When Hermione destroys the Hufflepuff Cup, Voldemort, Harry and Nagini all seem to be momentarily incapacitated by pain. This also happens when the Ravenclaw Diadem and Nagini are destroyed, clearly showing that all Horcruxes and the Master Soul feel the destruction of the others.

      Interestingly enough, this only starts to happen when the cup is destroyed, as Harry does not react to the locket's destruction and Voldemort remains oblivious when both it and the ring are destroyed. The reason for this is unclear, but it may be because the cup marked the destruction of half of Voldemort's soul, or possibly because Voldemort wasn't aware that his Horcruxes were being hunted until the cup was stolen.

    According to Dumbledore, even when Voldemort's Horcruxes were destroyed, his brain and his magical power would remain intact.

    was unable to figure out Voldemort had created Horcruxes despite being told that a fragment of Voldemort's soul resides within Harry. In fact, despite Voldemort surviving the first rebounding Killing Curse and telling his
    Death Eaters
    that he alone went further than anyone on the path of immortality, none of them were able to understand that he utilised Horcruxes to achieve this. This all suggests that even among the most devoted Dark Arts practitioners such as them, they could not fathom that their master would dare mutilate his own soul for the sake of immortality. The only Death Eater who successfully learned Voldemort had created a Horcrux was
    Regulus Black
    and indeed he, despite coming from a family that had quite the affinity for the Dark Arts, was utterly horrified upon finding out and tried to destroy it.
