Dumbledore responded saying that Petunia may not study at Hogwarts, and even though he responded kindly, Petunia felt hurt and left out, which also in part could have been because her parents were so proud of Lily's talents. From that point on, Petunia wanted nothing to do with magic or the wizarding world and frequently called Lily a "freak".

She forced him to do all of the chores around the house, while Dudley was free to do anything he pleased. Petunia also told Harry that his parents had died in a car crash and that the scar on his forehead came from that same accident. She did not let Harry ask any questions about his family, nor generally any questions at all for that matter.

However, almost everything seemed to go wrong every time she and her husband had guests over when Harry was present. In
   1992

   Mr

She and Vernon completely forgot it also happened to be Harry's Birthday that day. During the day, she prepared a
   pudding

   , she was a spiteful bully, who took pleasure in abusing her nephew Harry, stemming from her resentment towards her sister Lily, Harry's mother. She cruelly mistreated and neglected Harry throughout most of his childhood, often calling him a "freak" and never showed any compassion towards him, whilst constantly spoiling and praising her son Dudley. Petunia was shown to be unpleasant and contemptuous even as a child, as she frequently insulted her sister as a "freak" due to her magical abilities and her sneering towards a young Severus Snape due to his shabby clothes and lower-class background.
  </p>
  <p key="c893a33d-f7ef-4bf0-9fcc-bae7a3b57765">
   Petunia was very house proud and was obsessed with keeping it clean, as she constantly kept her home clean and tidy, even to the point of cleaning the kitchen worktop surfaces before bed.
   She also hated animals: for example, she was disgusted at the sight of Marge's dog
   Ripper
   slobbering over her clean kitchen floor.
   She also appeared to be afraid of

   Hogwarts acceptance letter

  <p key="453af6e8-e6b5-4d06-95f3-cd9c5081d4ee">
   Petunia was responsible for Dudley's anti-social personality, along with her husband, due to their spoiling of him. She was also unable to realise her son Dudley's complete lack of positive qualities, and believed him to be a gifted and clever boy who was misunderstood by his teachers (whilst ironically shunning Harry), despite the fact he received abysmal school results.
   She was also very gullible to believe Dudley went to a different friend's house for dinner each night as a teenager, when in reality he and his gang were causing trouble in the neighbourhood and bullying younger children.
   Of course, her doting love for Dudley may have caused her to be in outright denial of his antisocial behaviours, although on one occasion, she did threaten to cut his pocket money should he not stick to his diet,
   showing she was somewhat capable of disciplining her son should she wanted to.

  <p key="1326f4b9-8f37-4115-84f7-1b1b4d6c048c">
   At the heart of Petunia's character was her secret regret at having not been born a witch like her sister. As a child, Petunia was both frightened of and envious of her sister's astonishing abilities. She also heavily felt that her parent's favoured Lily over her, resulting in feelings of being ignored and unappreciated by them. When Lily was accepted into Hogwarts, Petunia wrote a letter to Professor Dumbledore begging him to take her as well. He rejected her kindly, but when Lily discovered the exchange, Petunia only said that she "
   <i key="e3f191ed-137f-4cc1-9cb7-113b2e3f15d2">
    didn't want to go to that 'freak' school anyway
   </i>
   ", when in reality she was very upset at realising she had no magical abilities herself. In addition, Petunia was understandably devastated upon learning of her sister's death, and had deep feelings of sadness inside her for never reconciling with her before she died.
  </p>
  <p key="30c627dc-403f-4cad-90ac-fcf9ba453dbb">
   Petunia frequently referred to witches and wizards as "freaks". However, never did she forget that Harry was her sister's son. She begrudgingly gave him room and board for sixteen years because she knew that her home was the only place that he could be safe from the hands of

   </a>
   . Although she did feel some compassion and love for her nephew deep down, she was too repressed inside to ever express such emotions and was unable to say anything to him before they all departed from 4 Privet Drive in 1997, showing she was never able to let go of her resentment.
  </p>
  <p key="461c9533-dd4c-4c46-acb8-8578870d1d54">
   Due to having grown up with wizards, Petunia had a somewhat greater familiarity with magic than Vernon. For example, she surprised her family by revealing that she had known about

   However, her knowledge was very limited, since Petunia was unfamiliar with many magical subjects such as

Although Harry's relationship with Dudley had mended to the point that they remained on "Christmas card terms" and visited occasionally, it is unknown if Petunia herself ever had contact with Harry again. In spite of everything, Harry cared for her enough to push them to go into hiding for their protection. Although it is not known if Petunia contacted Harry again after the war, it is highly possible that Petunia reconciled with her nephew and was on Christmas cards terms with him too. Given how Harry learned of what caused the rift between his mother and her sister, Harry gained a new understanding of his aunt. After her death, Dudley gave Harry his blanket which had been kept in the possession of Petunia since his arrival at Privet Drive.

Petunia, who was contemptuous of anything out of the ordinary, viewed him with disdain because of his poor economic status and because he was such an oddball. Snape, on the other hand, regarded her balefully because she was a Muggle and also because she made disparaging comments about his clothes. Possibly as a result of this childhood animosity, the subject of Snape, as with anything magic-related, was never mentioned under the

   Petunia is the name of a flower. Her younger sister, Lily, also bears the name of a flower. This could have been done accidentally or by means of demonstrating Petunia's and Lily's sisterhood. A petunia is also a flower that is a symbol of resentment and anger. Petunia was a name J.K. Rowling used for unpleasant female characters in games in her youth, and believes the name may have subconsciously came from

   Petunia flowers themselves are used to represent resentment, along with anger. The alternative meaning is wanting the comfort of another person
