   Yaxley was described as having hard, blunt features

   and has long, pale blond hair tied in a neat braid that hangs down to his lower back. In spite of his snide comment about Lucius Malfoy's fondness for luxury upon seeing a peacock on his property, he shared Malfoy's sense of superiority over the rabble surrounding him, attiring himself in long, magnificent flowing robes to set himself apart from his fellow Ministry officials and highlight his position of power and authority.

   Haughty, blunt, and domineering, Corban Yaxley was a proud, ambitious man with little patience for the feelings and the problems of others, instead choosing to devote his energies towards the fulfilment of the Dark Lord's plans and the fruition of the peaceful society he and his comrades had been promised would follow their master's triumph. Like many other
   Death Eaters
   , he subscribed very strongly to the ideology of

  <p key="b7905753-d256-4355-baa6-03b2de23d638">
   Indeed, during one Muggle-born trial, Yaxley highlighted his immense cruelty through his apparent enjoyment of using his new authority to intimidate and verbally abuse the lower-ranked employees, and even laughed at
   Mary Cattermole
   and contemptuously dismissed her worries for her children, responding that "

   This also indicated that he despises even
   half-bloods
   , despite Voldemort permitting them to continue living in the Wizarding community. He also showed a lust for power and prestige, reflected by how he described in detail on how he subdued Thicknesse and eagerly spoke of the plan to move Harry, in hopes of attracting more praise from Voldemort and fellow Death Eaters.
   Even so, while he did display a rather ruthless streak, he lacked, or at least overtly lacked, the sadistic and bloodthirsty nature of such comrades as
   Antonin Dolohov

   , being intelligent enough to weigh political reality against a desire for personal, petty revenge. Whereas this shrewdness would've been a necessity in regard to maintaining his role of as an agent of the Dark Lord in the Ministry of Magic, it was perhaps best shown through his participation in the
   plot to assassinate Albus Dumbledore
   , during which, once they had the Headmaster cornered, wandless and alone, he contrasted
   Alecto and Amycus Carrow
   's gleeful enjoyment of seeing their enemy in such a compromising position by impatiently demanding that

   killed him so they could flee the area before the school got the chance to notify the Ministry of Magic

   While his loyalty was questioned during the
   Return of Lord Voldemort
   in 1994, it would appear that Yaxley's decision not to search for his master came, rather than a wish to not compromise his freedom and social status after avoiding Azkaban, from a genuine belief that the Dark Lord had met his demise when he failed to kill

   on Hallowe'en in 1981. This was shown by how he could be rather harsh with his fellow Death Eaters whenever they went against the Dark Lord's orders, such as when he violently blasted
   Fenrir Greyback
   away from Albus Dumbledore for trying to kill him without letting Draco Malfoy, to whom Voldemort had given the task, have a chance. However he did subside when Snape stepped silently forward to accomplish the deed, showing that Yaxley may have a certain level of feared respect for him, or that he might just have been aware that in the event of Draco failing to complete the task at hand, the Dark Lord would naturally have turned to Snape to do it and hence simply let him. Despite this seemingly pragmatic choice of life self-well-being over loyalty to a fallen Voldemort, according to
   Nymphadora Tonks
   , Yaxley appeared to be prepared to fight to the death during the

   Amongst his fellow
   Death Eaters
   , Yaxley has some mixed relationships. He reacted violently against
   Fenrir Greyback
   for trying to kill

   , though in all fairness Fenrir was not an official Death Eater, and therefore received little respect amongst them. Yaxley, at the very least, respected

   with a sense of fear, as he backed down when Snape stepped forward to kill Dumbledore. He received many praises from the Death Eaters when he went into detail in subduing Thicknesse, though he seemed a little envious when Snape was receiving slightly more attention and praise from Voldemort. He also appeared to be on good terms with
   Antonin Dolohov
   who patted him on the back during the meeting and were seen conversing together while on the lookout for

   He seems to have a sarcastic opinion on Lucius Malfoy's extravagance and show off attitude on his wealth. When he and Snape encountered an albino peacock on a hedge in front of Malfoy Manor, he sneered that Lucius always did himself well. He was also present when Lucius's son, Draco cornered Albus Dumbledore. He grew impatient when Draco was hesitant to kill the headmaster, and aggressively ordered him to do so quickly. When Voldemort humiliated the Malfoys during the first meeting, he joined his fellow Death Eaters in their mocking and sneering laughter.

   During his tenure as the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Yaxley abused his position by intimidating the less-ranking employees, such as
   Reg Cattermole
   , especially for marrying
   a muggle-born
   , and threatened him to have his office dried out within one hour or have his wife face even more dire consequences. He also ignored a wizard's greeting, showing little respect for those he did not deem worthy. However, he did nod approvingly at
   Albert Runcorn
   , showing respect for a fellow pure-blood supremacist. Seeing Yaxley scold and intimidate the

   in prosecuting the captured Muggle-borns, he ruthlessly sneered at their despair and ignored their pleas. He made it clear that he would never marry any woman who would be even mistaken for a "
