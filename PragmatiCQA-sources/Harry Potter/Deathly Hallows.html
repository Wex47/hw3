   Antioch Peverell

   According to legend, he who possessed these three artefacts would become the
   Master of Death
   . Dumbledore told Harry that he and another wizard,
   Gellert Grindelwald
   took this to mean that the uniter of the Deathly Hallows would be invincible. The story of the Deathly Hallows was originally told by
   Beedle the Bard
   and subsequently passed from family to family as a wizard fairytale. Few wizards ever realised that the Deathly Hallows were genuine items. Most people thought that there were things that Beedle had made up to entertain young wizards and witches.

   No one but Harry Potter had been known to have been in command of all three at the same time, though he was never in possession of them all at once (he dropped the stone in the Forbidden Forest just before gaining the wand that he had won the alliance of in a previous scuffle at Malfoy Manor).

   , the
   author
   presented his own version of the origin of the Hallows. Hundreds of years ago, the three
   Peverell brothers
   were travelling at twilight, and reached a river too dangerous to cross. The three brothers, being trained in the magical arts, simply waved their wands and created a bridge across the river. They were then stopped by
   Death
   himself, who felt cheated that they had gotten across the river, as most travellers drowned in it.
  </p>
  <p key="6946ae70-6e92-46d6-8fc7-def3ab73a5ea">
   Death
   , a cunning liar, then pretended to congratulate them on being clever enough to evade him, and offered each of them a powerful magical item. The first brother,
   Antioch Peverell
   , wished to have the most powerful wand out of his combative personality; Death broke a branch off a nearby elder tree and created for him the
   Elder Wand
   , a wand more powerful than any other in existence. The second brother,
   Cadmus Peverell
   , out of arrogance, wanted to humiliate Death even further, and wished to have the power to bring loved ones from the grave; Death then took a stone from the riverbed and created for him the
   Resurrection Stone
   , a stone capable of bringing the dead back to the living world. The third brother,
   Ignotus Peverell
   , who was a humble man, did not trust Death and asked to go on from the river without being followed by Death; Death then gave him his own Cloak of Invisibility, an invisibility cloak that never lost its power through curses or age. In time, the brothers went their separate ways.

   The three legendary objects, (the cloak, the wand and the stone) together made up the Deathly Hallows.

   Instead of being rewards for their cleverness, the Deathly Hallows were actually part of a cunning plan by

   The cloak continued to be passed down through the descendants of the
   Peverells
   (although the name became extinct in the male line). The wand passed from wizard to wizard, nearly always by the murder of its previous owner. The wand, during its passing from wizard to wizard, has been called "The Death Stick" and the "Wand of Destiny". On an interesting note, no witch is ever stated to have held possession of the wand. The stone was also passed down through the Peverells' descendants. It eventually ended up in the possession of the
   House of Gaunt
   , and was later stolen by

   Marvolo Gaunt
   were aware of the powers of the stone, nor that it was a Hallow. Marvolo was solely concerned with the "noble origins" of the stone, made into a ring, and thought that the Hallows symbol on it was the family coat of arms. Lord Voldemort could not have been aware of the stone's true origin either, as he transformed the stone into a
   Horcrux

   Godric Gryffindor's Sword
   did the stone revert to its normal state, with its original powers intact. Dumbledore also came into possession of the

   Harry Potter was the only known
   Master of Death
   , having gathered and mastered all three Hallows and most importantly, accepted death, as the true master understood that death was inevitable and that there were worse things in life than dying. He did not unite all three of them physically at the same moment, as he possessed no more than two at the same time. Albus Dumbledore had also gathered all three, though physically owning no more than two at the same time, and did not master the usage of the Cloak, but he could qualify for the title of the Master of Death as he fulfilled the most important criteria needed by accepting death. With the Stone lost, it was unlikely there would ever be another to hold the title.
