   Driven into a rage at the loss of his godfather, Harry pursued her all the way to the Atrium in an attempt to avenge him. After hideously mocking his relationship with Sirius, Harry attempted to use the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on her but only knocked her over causing her a few seconds of pain. Dropping her jeering manner, Bellatrix disdainfully lectured him on his failure to execute the curse effectively (inadvertently teaching him how to do it properly in the future) before resolving to torture him herself with it in order to demonstrate the full potency of the curse. After unsuccessfully attempting to attack Harry, she discovered to her horror that the prophecy had been destroyed and proceeded to panic, repeatedly attempting to summon it in vain from Harry who laughed at her efforts and dismissed her pleadings for leniency from her master due to being unaware that the latter had just arrived at the Ministry.

   Once Harry realised that Voldemort was indeed present, Bellatrix pleaded with her master not to be punished and tried to warn him that Dumbledore was nearby, but he ignored her and concentrated on attempting to kill Harry. As the Killing Curse blasted from the end of his wand towards Harry, Dumbledore arrived and
   enchanted
   the statues of the Fountain of Magical Brethren to protect Harry, act as reinforcements, and to ensure that Bellatrix couldn't intervene as she was then pinned to the ground by the newly sentient witch statue. However, she was the sole Death Eater to escape being captured by effectively
   blocking
   the spell that he had attempted to cast upon her.

   Before duelling Voldemort, Dumbledore summoned
   Cornelius Fudge
   and several Aurors to the Ministry using the statues as messengers via the fireplaces along the Atrium wall. After a failed attempt at possessing Harry, Voldemort grabbed Bellatrix before Apparating away but not before being seen by Fudge and the Aurors. With the rest of the Death Eaters immobilised and caught by the Ministry only moments later, Bellatrix was the only Death Eater not to be apprehended due to Voldemort intervening on her behalf, a testament to his acknowledgement of her loyalty to him.

   were captured by a group of
   Snatchers
   and brought to the manor, Bellatrix was at first eager to make sure that Voldemort was informed right away and she and Lucius briefly argued over who would summon him. When she spotted Godric Gryffindor's Sword amongst the trio's captured possessions, however, she at once flew into a panic because the sword (as far as she knew) was hidden in her vault. This led Harry to deduce that there could be something of great importance in her vault which ended up being one of Voldemort's Horcruxes:
   Helga Hufflepuff's Cup
   . Bellatrix, coming out of her panicked state, ordered the Snatcher holding the sword to hand it over to her and stunned the man when he refused.

   The other Snatchers turned on her at once, but even though it was four on one, they were no match for her and she quickly stunned three of them and
   forced
   Greyback to his knees, demanding to know where he had found the sword. He then informed her that the sword had been found in the Trio's tent. She then took charge of the situation by resorting to torturing Hermione into revealing how the sword was in the Trio's possession and demanded that the rest of the prisoners be taken into the cellar temporarily, while ordering the Stunned Snatchers to be placed in the courtyard to be disposed of by her personally at a later time.

   Bellatrix proceeded to brutally torture Hermione with the
   Cruciatus Curse
   , asking her again and again about the Sword and if they had taken anything else from their vault. Even in extreme pain, Hermione managed to lie, claiming the real sword was only a copy.
   However, Bellatrix doubted this claim, which led to Lucius suggesting that Draco retrieve the goblin prisoner

After Peter Pettigrew (who had been sent to check on the prisoners after hearing a suspicious noise) was strangled to death in the cellar with his own
   silver hand
   given to him by
   Voldemort
   after showing mercy to Harry and Ron escaped the cellar and proceeded up the stairs to aid Hermione.

Bellatrix eagerly asked Voldemort if she could check Harry for signs of life, but was refused again and he instead sent her younger sister to confirm his death.

   The Weasley matriarch, having already lost one child that night and distraught at the prospect of losing her only daughter, promptly threw off her cloak and shouted a vocal challenge to the Death Eater as she charged forward, causing Bellatrix to cackle with laughter at her. However, Bellatrix's reckless, arrogant laughter quickly turned to rage as Molly began to attack, making her realise her opponent was more formidable than she had expected. The two began to duel with the intensity of their powers being stated as causing the ground beneath them to become hot and cracked due to their intent to finish the other off once and for all.

  </h2>
  <p key="a10cb7f6-62b1-4ccd-8653-dda1e8345fc4">
   Bellatrix was an intensely sadistic witch with brutal, violent tendencies.
   She possessed a fierce and dangerous temper, a trait that she shared with her cousin
   Sirius
   and her aunt
   Walburga
   and which was likely a result of the inbreeding that plagued her birth family. Bellatrix was one of

   's cruellest
   Death Eaters
   , always eager to inflict the

   <i key="83299e1e-711d-427f-b0db-2161fc0e74ff">
    mad as her master
   </i>
   ."
   Likely for these reasons, Bellatrix was slavishly devoted to
   <a href="Tom Riddle.html" key="f0e4b80c-39d0-4a6a-8f6e-70b2fb8abe86" title="Tom Riddle">
    Lord Voldemort
   </a>
   and was willing to do anything for his cause. She believed to have proven her loyalty by her time in
   Azkaban
   , an event which had seemingly furthered her mental decline.
   Despite her loyalty towards her master she was able to disagree with him on occasion. She did not trust
   <a href="Severus Snape.html" key="956da75c-34f4-43c0-822c-b004de5ded35" title="Severus Snape">
    Severus Snape
   </a>
   , and believed that Voldemort was mistaken in doing so, though she showed shame and fear when expressing this.
  </p>
  <p key="e83f7976-7cf0-4d9b-b91d-250ef3ca0b4b">
   Overall, Bellatrix was obsessed with blood purity and took immense pride in the aristocracy of her family since a young age. Like all the rest of Lord Voldemort's followers, she was vehemently against all
   half-bloods
   ,
   Muggle-borns
   ,
   <a href="Non-magic people.html" key="628f3c71-023c-4ed2-bb32-1c7875291df2" title="Non-magic people">
    Muggles
   </a>
   , and
   half-breeds
   . She had a particular disdain for
   blood traitors
   , not being above killing members of her own family who displeased her, including her cousin Sirius and her younger sister's daughter
   Nymphadora
   , whom she sought to kill with great determination. Given her reaction to Harry's words that Voldemort is a half-blood, it is likely that she didn't know that her master wasn't a pure-blood or at least was in denial.
  </p>
  <p key="93b55d1c-72c7-417b-8837-f69eda5a9174">
   Bellatrix was intelligent and a natural leader, taking charge in tricky situations. These traits were shown during the
   Battle of the Department of Mysteries
   and the
   Skirmish at Malfoy Manor
   . The latter event was a mark of her decisiveness and ruthlessness, as she took no unnecessary prisoners (preferring to kill them instead), as she planned to do with a group of
   Snatchers
   who attempted to defy her.
   However, Bellatrix could be easily distracted and reckless, especially in battle with opponents that appeared to be (or were) weaker than herself.
  </p>
  <p key="14b3480f-c120-425e-a30d-b785d5e070fd">
   Bellatrix was also egotistical and arrogant, described by Harry as "

    treat[ing] everyone like scum"
   </i>
   in a rather taunting way. She had immense confidence in her skills and never hesitated to jump into battle against any auror or Order of the Phoenix member. Furthermore, she was immensely proud of her status as the most loyal and devoted follower of Lord Voldemort. However, Bellatrix chose to flee when
   <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="54fc7259-5319-4478-aed2-9fa534eb1caf" title="Albus Dumbledore">
    Dumbledore

  </p>
  <p key="0d2fb19c-7584-434e-a689-dc536d001496">
   Despite her cruel personality, Bellatrix was not incapable of caring for a few people. She was obsessively in
   love
   with her master, Lord Voldemort. She had a close relationship with her younger sister
   Narcissa Malfoy
   , grudgingly going with her to Snape's house to ask his help and didn't tell her master of her sister's deception. She also showed affection for her nephew and student

    : Bellatrix claimed to have been trained in the Dark Arts by Voldemort himself, boasting to Harry Potter that she had knowledge of "spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete!" ;
    a claim supported by her status as Voldemort's "best lieutenant". Bellatrix displayed particular proficiency with the
    Cruciatus Curse
    , which was her signature spell. She preferred to torture her victims rather than killing them straight away, doing so with such skill her victims would pass out or would lose their sanity after prolonged exposure to the curse. Following her first duel against Nymphadora Tonks, the latter had to spend some time at
    St Mungo's
    , suggesting that her aunt cursed her in such a way that couldn't be cured easily.

   muggle-born
   and was disowned, she never saw her again.
   Bellatrix shared a mutual loathing with her "dear cousin" Sirius Black, who had a similar temper. The two taunted each other as they duelled during the
   Battle of the Department of Mysteries
   . After killing Sirius, Bellatrix sadistically jeered at Harry about the death of his godfather on multiple occasions.

   Bellatrix was obsessively in
   love
   with Lord Voldemort, which extended to her being (sexually) attracted to him.
   More than just being a fanatic, she shared his ideas of blood purity and fascination with the
   Dark Arts
   . Unlike many of the other
   Death Eaters
   , Bellatrix never attempted to deny her loyalties when her master fell in 1981. Instead, she proudly claimed that she was his most loyal and trusted servant, and stated that he would rise again. She seemed to view
   Azkaban
   prison as a mere place to wait for his return.
  </p>
  <p key="8397efc7-d892-40e5-ad5f-c712ba63a028">
   Bellatrix was described as being slavishly devoted to her master, regarding him with "worshipful fascination" and speaking to him in a romantic way.
   On at least one occasion, during the 1997 meeting of Death Eaters at
   <a href="Malfoy Manor.html" key="b721e0df-0754-4689-9806-a7be96c4688d" title="Malfoy Manor">
    Malfoy Manor

   , her cheeks flushed and her eyes welled up with tears when she thought he was praising her. Satisfying him was of the utmost importance to her. She was perfectly willing to kill her niece,
   Nymphadora Tonks
   , as a way of "pruning" her "family tree", though she would most likely have done it without his orders, anyway.
  </p>
  <p key="bdf57477-eae9-4e76-97f0-34b9866b95d2">
   Bellatrix was outraged by anyone showing her master even the slightest disrespect. When Harry called him by his name in 1996, she became enraged, feeling that he was unworthy of speaking the name. She was also furious when Harry spoke of Voldemort's
   half-blood
   status and
   Muggle father
   . Despite agreeing with her master's ideology of blood purity, she apparently didn't care that he himself was a half-blood, if she believed this at all. Voldemort might have falsely told his subordinates that he was a pure-blood, something which Harry Potter suspected. If so, she believed her master's lie over the truth from the enemy.
  </p>
  <p key="5118f2ec-8909-4587-9c98-d37a64e9696a">
   Voldemort respected her talents and skills and considered her of greater importance than most of his other servants. At the conclusion of the
   Battle of the Department of Mysteries
   , he grabbed her and
   Apparated
   away with her. She was the sole Death Eater whom he bothered to help, though this may have been done out of convenience, as she was much closer in proximity than the other captured Death Eaters. However, Voldemort didn't reciprocate her romantic feelings, as he didn't know
   love
   . Due to his egotistical and self-centred nature, it is possible that he was at least pleased with her desire for him. Their sexual relationship and the honour of bearing of his child could have also been a reward to Bellatrix for her loyalty to him, as he believed that he had a found a way to cheat death and didn't need to leave an heir behind.

   Most of the Order of the Phoenix knew Bellatrix as one of the most dangerous and sadistic of Lord Voldemort's followers, especially considering Bellatrix managed to kill, seriously injure, or duel and successfully defeat several Order members.
   She bested

   Like many members of the
   House of Black
   , Bellatrix's name is derived from that of a star.
   Bellatrix
   is the third brightest star in the constellation Orion. It is also known as the Amazon Star, which is one of Orion's seven brightest stars. In fact, it's the twenty-seventh brightest star in the night sky. The Amazons were warrior women in Greek mythology, which is presumably an allusion to Bellatrix being among the most dangerously skilled
   Death Eaters
   . Her name likely has Latin, French and English origins:
   <i key="c51cbb16-9a5c-47d0-9e8a-8efa3913e1e7">
    Bella
   </i>
   is Latin both for the plural of
   <i key="aa73ed64-b6b8-4f68-a7e6-692840c67d83">
    bellum
   </i>
   , meaning war, and the feminine singular adjective meaning "beautiful;"
   <i key="07f40f17-1a82-4eb5-b20b-b3ea74f5bbb1">
    trix
   </i>
   is Latin feminine suffix (i.e. Bellatrix is the Latin word for a female warrior or a personification of feminine beauty). 'Bellatrix' also translates directly to 'war-like'.

    l'étrange

   , which is French meaning "the strange one". Her name thus alludes to her own mental instability, although technically

    is the one who kills Bellatrix. However, in the
    final video game
    , after Neville defies Voldemort and pulls the sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat, Voldemort casts a Killing Curse at Neville and it ricochets off of the sword and hits Bellatrix, she does not die when it hits her, but screams when it does. She later fights Molly and is defeated, lying on the floor dead, unlike the film, when she is blasted into ash.

    , Popco had introduced several "series" of Harry Potter film action figures, including Bellatrix, in the United Kingdom and several other European countries. This made people in the United States go online to buy this action figure and/or others via British departments of certain online shopping websites. These websites include Amazon UK and Ebay UK.

    Much like for Voldemort, two different versions of Bellatrix’s death were shot as director David Yates was unsure whether or not to use effects for the 3D element being presented in the film. To help him make his decision, he shot a take of her collapsing to her death, while the other take would be shot differently to allow the effects team to break Bellatrix into many pieces. The latter would make it into the final film.
