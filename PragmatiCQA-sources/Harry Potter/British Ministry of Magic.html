   Visitors to the Ministry of Magic came to a broken-down red telephone box on a dingy street which had several shabby offices, a pub, and a wall covered with graffiti. When the telephone in the box was dialled (62442, the word M-A-G-I-C), the welcome witch’s voice answered, not from the phone, but from the air, as if the person was standing right there. Visitors had to state their business, upon which a silver badge popped out with the visitor’s name and purpose of visit. Then the telephone box dropped down like a lift for about one minute, after which the visitor would be in the Atrium.

Down the left-hand side of the hall were gilded fireplaces which witches and wizards used to arrive at the Ministry. The right-hand side contained gilded fireplaces as well, and these were used for departures. The floor was polished dark wood. The ceiling was peacock blue with golden symbols moving across it.

   After the battle, Fudge and several other witnesses saw Voldemort with their own eyes, and this position of denial became untenable. Thus, the Ministry was forced to acknowledge the return of the Dark Lord and Fudge was unceremoniously replaced by
   Rufus Scrimgeour
   , although Fudge was allowed to aid in an "advisory capacity".
   The public was then made aware of the growing threat to its population and this marked the start of open warfare.

   In response to the war situation the country was facing, Rufus Scrimgeour, the previous Head of the
   Auror Office
   , was appointed Fudge's successor on
   2 July
   1996
   ,
   and was responsible for the creation of several new bureaucracies, such as the
   Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects
   .

  <p key="9576a2cd-517f-441b-be23-37a01aefc388">
   Despite this, Scrimgeour did not fare much better than Fudge. Again reacting to public opinion, Scrimgeour tried desperately to make the Ministry look like it was making progress despite the reality being the contrary, such as by wrongfully imprisoning
   Stan Shunpike
   . Under Scrimgeour's regime, there was no progress. He was too concerned with the appearance of false safety, something that would ultimately led to his downfall and the downfall of the Ministry.
  </p>
  <p key="b47279c0-41fc-46c8-98bf-4a45cca3ccaa">
   Harry had two meetings with Scrimgeour, in which Harry's co-operation with the Ministry was solicited for his propaganda value: the Ministry wanted Harry to be the "poster child" for the Ministry so as to give the public hope, by telling them that the Ministry remained a source of safety, strength, and that "the Chosen One" endorsed the Ministry's investigations. Harry turned Scrimgeour down flat both times. Harry made it perfectly clear that he did not approve of what the Ministry was doing and made his opinion of Scrimgeour known. This led the Minister for Magic to believe that Harry was arrogant and the two parted on bad terms. The two remained on bad terms during the reading of the last will and testament of Dumbledore and it came to an argument in which Scrimgeour lost control of his temper. Harry stated that he will never co-operate with the Ministry if they keep conducting themselves in a less then positive way as they have previously done.

   was the high court of wizarding law in Britain. The head of the Wizengamot was called the Chief Warlock, an old-fashioned title that denoted “particular skill or achievements” similar to a Muggle knighthood. A

   The high Wizard court of law was held in a dungeon. In court, the accused was magically bound to a chair in the centre of the room. A jury sat on the right of the prosecutor, who stated the case against the accused and eventually asked for a verdict.

The Ministry was known to be corrupt in nature, as it was shown to be quite prepared to decree and enforce draconian laws without notice, and seemed uninterested in solving serious problems, choosing instead to ignore or cover up bad news. More often than not, the Ministry was focused on positive publicity rather than genuine betterment of the community, and took the pressures from the satisfaction of the majority citizens as a factor to their decisions.

   The Ministry proved their incompetent and insensitive nature in how they dealt with
   werewolves
   , which resulted in years of poor surveillance. The government arrogantly expected the werewolves to willingly show up to sign the
   Werewolf Register
   and
   Werewolf Code of Conduct
   , assuming that they would openly admit their infection and promise to lock themselves up to protect the community. Unsurprisingly, no one showed up to sign either due to the stigma, which the Ministry apparently did not take into consideration, thus leading to their record on werewolves being inadequate, which resulted in several attacks and failure to arrest the culprits.
