   The Inferi in question were mostly vagrant, homeless Muggles murdered by Voldemort, but some of them were the earthly remains of wizards and witches who 'disappeared' during the war without explanation.
   This could possibly include wizards from the Ministry, members of the Order that were never found, or just random unlucky witches and wizards.

   and discovered its hiding place as a crystal cave by the sea. At first, the Inferi remained inert as the two sailed in the
   boat
   towards the
   central island

   When Dumbledore suffered from the Drink of Despair's thirst-inducing effects, Harry had to take some water from the lake (as this was the only option available to quench the thirst). Contact with the water triggered the Inferi, whom nearly dragged Harry to the depths of the lake to drown. Dumbledore successfully repelled them by
   conjuring
   a
   ring of fire
   , big enough to surround both Harry and himself. Once all the Inferi returned into the lake they did not resurface when Dumbledore's ring of fire faltered.

   An Inferius was a grisly puppet. The Inferi were gaunt, skeletal beings that closely resembled
   zombies
   . Being human corpses, they had individual appearances based on the humans they had been created from. For example, one Inferius might have dull teeth, while another might have sharp teeth. Some might have hair, others might not have any at all - depending on the age of the human at time of death and the corpse's state of decay.
   The most obvious sign that one was facing an Inferius rather than a living human were the white and cloudy eyes, indicating their owner was devoid of any form of life.

   The spells used to reanimate a human body were much more complex than those used, for instance, to make inanimate objects fly.
   The Inferius might be cursed to respond lethally if disturbed, to kill indiscriminately, and to undertake perilous jobs for its master. Its limitations were, however, obvious; it had no will and no brain of its own, and would not be able to think its way out of unforeseen trouble. As a warrior or guardian with no regard for its own safety, however, it had many uses.
  </p>
  <p key="eba77228-b699-4b6f-853d-583e1dce1cf0">
   Due to their status as being unfeeling dead, the Inferi were immune to bodily damages such as
   slashing
   , and had great physical strength, enough to kill a human or drag them away. Due to their superior strength and surprising speed, they were especially dangerous en masse.

   Preserved indefinitely by

   Because Inferi were creatures of the dark, they disliked light and heat (no spell had been found to render dead flesh impervious to burning). The most effective
   spell
   against them was therefore a fire-summoning spell, such as
   Firestorm
   . Because of this, the Inferi were enchanted by their master to avoid flames.
   Other spells might work against a few Inferi, but might not be useful against a whole army of them. It must be noted that Inferi were resistant to most spells: they couldn't feel pain, and thus were unaffected by many attacks whose main effect was pain such as the
   Cruciatus Curse
   . This was evident when

     Inferi have much in common with zombies, which are mentioned as separate creatures within Harry's world. I had several good reasons for not wishing to call the guardians of the locket Horcrux 'zombies'. Firstly, zombies are not part of British folklore, but associated with the myths of Haiti and parts of Africa. While the students of Hogwarts would learn about them, they would not expect to meet them walking down the streets of Hogsmeade. Secondly, while zombies of the Vodou tradition can be nothing more than reanimated corpses, a separate but related tradition has it that the sorcerer uses their souls, or part of their souls, to sustain himself. This conflicted with my Horcrux story, and I did not wish to suggest that Voldemort had any more use for his Inferi than as guards of his Horcrux. Lastly, zombies have been represented and reinterpreted on film so often in the last fifty years that they have a whole raft of associations that were of no use to me. I'm part of the 'Thriller' generation; to me, a zombie will always mean Michael Jackson in a bright red bomber jacket.
