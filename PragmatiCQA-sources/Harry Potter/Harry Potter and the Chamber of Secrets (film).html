Unknown to everyone, a monster/monstrous creature stalks the castle, with the power literally to petrify several students. During a transfiguration class, McGonagall explains that according to legend, one of the school's founders, Salazar Slytherin built a secret Chamber and sheltered a monster in it before leaving the school for good. Only his heir can open the chamber and use the monster to purge impure-blooded wizards and witches whom Salazar deemed unworthy to study magic.

   More attacks occur over the course of the year. Harry and Ron suspect Malfoy is the Heir, so Hermione suggests they question him while disguised using polyjuice potion. Their makeshift laboratory is in a disused bathroom haunted by the spirit of a former Hogwarts student named Myrtle Warren (Shirley Henderson), whom the school community addresses as "Moaning Myrtle".

   During the duelling lesson hosted by Snape and Lockhart, Malfoy conjures a cobra which menaces at a Hufflepuff student named Justin Finch Fletchley. Harry manages to control the snake by inadvertently revealing his ability to speak a serpent language known as Parseltongue before Snape vanishes the carnivorous reptile. This causes the school to suspect that Harry is the Heir of Slytherin. Unknowingly, Harry managed to gain the rare ability on the night Voldemort failed to kill him when the former was still an infant.

   (Josh Herman) and
   Millicent Bulstrode
   (Helen Stuart), hoping to learn from Malfoy the identity of the Heir. Unfortunately, the hair that Hermione took from Millicent Bulstrode's uniform was from a cat, and as the Polyjuice Potion is only intended for human transformations, she assumes a feline appearance, leaving Harry and Ron to ask information by themselves. At the
   Slytherin common room
   , they they learn that Malfoy does not know who the Heir of Slytherin is, but he inadvertently provides Harry and Ron with an important clue about the Chamber of Secrets that his father told him; a girl died when the Chamber was last opened fifty years ago. As the potion begins to wear off, the duo discover Hermione's feline appearance and that it would take a little more than a month to restore her to normal human form.
  </p>
  <p key="3cfa03a1-ef5a-4260-bbdb-65848113175f">
   Before Hermione is released from the hospital wing in early February with her normal appearance restored, Harry finds an enchanted diary, owned by a former student named Tom Marvolo Riddle, which shows him a flashback to the year 1943, exactly fifty years before. In the flashback, Harry witnesses four wizard authorities carry away Myrtle Warren's corpse from Hogwarts and Riddle, trying to find the problem, accused Hagrid, then a student, of opening the Chamber and freeing the alleged resident monster, a giant spider named Aragog. Riddle's actions caused Hagrid's expulsion later on.
  </p>
  <p key="a4ac990d-391d-4f92-98ab-8974bf398130">
   The attacks increase throughout the year, petrifying more students, including Hermione. When the diary disappears and Harry and Ron are shown by McGonagall the petrified body of Hermione, Harry and Ron go to Hagrid to question him. But before they can do, Professor Dumbledore, Cornelius Fudge, and Lucius Malfoy come to take Hagrid to Azkaban, but he discreetly tells the boys to "follow the spiders" and take care of his pet dog Fang. Lucius then has Dumbledore suspended. In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron, accompanied by Fang meet Aragog, a giant spider who reveals Hagrid's innocence and informs them of the discovery of a girl's corpse in a bathroom before giving a clue of the resident monster which he and his species fear and never speak of. Aragog then sets his colony of Acromantula on the boys, but the now-wild Ford Anglia saves them.
  </p>
  <p key="5dec882c-e4d8-4d45-9fac-d79591448ceb">
   A torn book page in Hermione's hand identifies the resident monster as a basilisk, a giant serpent that instantly kills those who make direct eye contact with it and only petrifies those who see it indirectly. Piecing the evidence together, Harry and Ron find out about the cause of petrification of Colin, Justin, Nearly-Headless Nick Hermione, and Mrs Norris; Colin had his camera, Justin saw it though Nearly-Headless Nick wherein the latter absorbed the force, while Hermione and Mrs Norris saw it through a reflection (the former having a mirror and the latter looking on a puddle of water). The duo also discover that the basilisk used the school's plumbing and from Aragog's statements the previous night, they realise that Moaning Myrtle was the girl found in the bathroom.
  </p>
  <p key="7af6379d-443e-41de-b12d-68b25303f665">
   The teachers discover a new message written on a wall declaring that Ginny Weasley has been taken into the Chamber, where "her skeleton will lie forever", and convince Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart, exposed as a fraud who wipes clean other wizards' memories and claims their achievements, planning to flee. Knowing Myrtle was the girl the Basilisk killed, they drag him to her bathroom where they discover the Chamber's entrance behind a circular column of sinks, a pipe big enough for a man to crawl through.
  </p>
  <p key="217b9c2c-dcb0-4d96-8bff-d1238b888f53">
   The trio jump through the hole and land in a series of cavernous maze-like crypts and dungeons. Following the tunnels, they find a shed basilisk skin wherein Lockhart feigns a collapse to seize Ron's broken wand and use it to erase Harry and Ron's memories. But as Lockhart casts the memory-erasing spell, it backfires on to himself, wiping his memory. The force of the spell also causes a portion of the ceiling to cave-in, separating Harry from Ron and Lockhart.
  </p>
  <p key="66847080-5ab1-4ed2-a5d7-0c7a84dde5ed">
   Harry ventures further to the tunnels and finds a circular door which is the entrance to the Chamber itself. He enters the Chamber where he finds an unconscious Ginny. As Harry tries to examine the body, he is greeted by the ghostly memory of the sixteen-year old Tom Riddle. After Riddle reveals to Harry that he is the memory preserved in the diary, he adds that he manipulated Ginny to open the Chamber and write the bloody messages on the walls, and how the diary traumatised her in February wherein she disposed it.
  </p>
  <p key="bde79536-67aa-4021-98dd-8b215d3100a8">
   Riddle then reveals his full name, Tom Marvolo Riddle, and the anagram he fashions out of it which reveals "I am Lord Voldemort". At this point Harry learns that Voldemort's real name was that of Riddle himself and was the true heir of Slytherin. Riddle reveals more on how he imprinted his 16-year old self as memory in an enchanted diary, in order to one day continue the failed work of his ancestor which he began when he opened the Chamber fifty years ago, ridding Hogwarts of impure-blooded witches and wizards. He also adds on how he framed Hagrid for the attacks and how he would make his new pseudonym a feared name in the wizarding community and how he would replace Dumbledore as the greatest sorcerer. After Harry expresses support for both Dumbledore and Hagrid, Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes, flies in with the Sorting Hat.
  </p>
  <p key="2ff177cb-8b5c-4085-8bcd-2e73234bb2fe">
   In an attempt to kill Harry, he unleashes the basilisk from the statue of Salazar Slytherin himself, but Fawkes, arrives and blinds the basilisk, destroying its fatal gaze. After a short chase and Harry's diversion, Harry returns to re-examine Ginny. Tom Riddle's memory grows more powerful as it steals life from Ginny's body.
  </p>
  <p key="ba7066a3-00fa-4c5a-951c-c8e10005d988">
   The basilisk emerges from the pool of the chamber and while Harry tries to find other means of fighting, the sword of Godric Gryffindor materialises from the Sorting Hat. Climbing the statue of Salazar Slytherin, he duels with the basilisk and manages to kill the monstrous creature by impaling the roof of its mouth with the sword. However, one of the creature's fangs pierces Harry's sword arm as a result of the latter's killing move. Harry manages to remove the fang as he and Riddle watch the basilisk slam dead to the chamber's floor. As Harry is slowly being poisoned, he uses his remaining energy to stab the diary with the the basilisk's fang, and the memory of Tom Riddle is destroyed, while Ginny revives from her near-death state. As Harry advises Ginny to get out of the Chamber with Ron, Fawkes comes to heal Harry with his tears, which have healing powers. Ginny and Harry both recover fully, along with those who were petrified: Hermione, Mrs Norris, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Nearly Headless Nick (John Cleese), and Colin Creevey.
  </p>
  <p key="a84a5e37-cf05-44be-ae5d-73b7ccdfb495">
   The next morning, Harry realises it was Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), Draco Malfoy's father, who slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron when he encountered the Weasleys in a Diagon Alley bookshop, but he is unable to prove it. Dobby reveals he is the Malfoys' servant, and knowing their treachery, had been trying to protect Harry all year. In gratitude, Harry sticks one of his old socks into the diary and hands it to Lucius. Lucius gives the diary to Dobby, who finds the sock hidden in its pages. This constitutes, in Dobby's eyes, a gift of clothing the traditional manner in which a master frees a house-elf from servitude. The freed Dobby declares he is eternally grateful to Harry and protects him from an attempted reprisal from Lucius. The word "Avada" is used as the beginning of Lucius Malfoy's curse, suggesting that it is the Avada Kedavra curse (the killing curse).
  </p>
  <p key="5b829fce-edb3-4dcb-a2e8-0892f584c338">
   Dumbledore dispels Harry's fears that he could have been put into Slytherin rather than into Gryffindor when he tells Harry that it is his choices that define him and not his abilities, and that Harry could not have wielded the sword of Gryffindor if he did not truly belong to that house. At the end of the year feast, everyone who was petrified is revived, including Hermione who is finally reunited with Harry and Ron, Dumbledore announces that all the exams have been cancelled and Hagrid is released from Azkaban, and receives loud cheers and applause from everyone, except a few students of Slytherin house.

In the film, he mispronounces "Diagon Alley" as "diagonally" out of a panic thanks to watching the effect of the Floo Powder as a demonstration.

    , and it leads to both of them chasing after the snitch for a few seconds before Harry catches it first. Also in the film, they chase the Snitch in between the

    During the match in both book and film, Slytherin had taken the lead of Gryffindor of throwing the Quaffle through the hoops, but they had different scores: In the book, the final score was 60-0, but in the film, the score is 90-30, in which Gryffindor would then receive 150 points because Gryffindor won the match.

    In the film, while Malfoy was dodging the Bludger, he tilted his broom too low, the tip of his broom hits a beam, causing him to catapult off his broom, and land on the grass, doing a full split. He was still moaning in agonising pain at the Hospital Wing when Madam Pomfrey tells him not to make such a fuss.

    The scene in the Great Hall during the Christmas Feast, Hermione simply says that she got Millicent Bulstrode's hair off her robes. The novel, however, depicts her and Millicent in the Duelling club where Millicent is head-locking Hermione, and she happens to find black hair on her robes.

    In the novel, the potion is in one of the stalls and when the trio prepares to drink from their separate glasses, they each go into a different stall and drink.

    The effects of the Polyjuice Potion differ from book to film. In the film, Harry and Ron's voices don't change when they become Crabbe and Goyle, forcing them to imitate these voices. This was presumably done to avoid confusing the audience because of the change in appearance which would be the standard for the use of the potion in both of the Deathly Hollows films.

    Though Ginny did seem uneasy as if it is her fault, in the book she is "bullied" into taking a dose of Pepperup Potion by Percy. In the film this is omitted, along with the fact that she didn't even notice Harry in the book, while in the film she had said "Mummy, have you seen my jumper?", and Mrs Weasley responded with "Yes dear, it was on the cat." Then, when Ginny sees Harry, he says "Hello" and she turns and hurries off.

    In the book, after Hagrid mentions that if they were looking for answers, all they'd have to do was follow the spiders, Harry and Ron didn't see any spiders until one day in Herbology when Harry points them out to Ron. They noticed the path the spiders were taking, which was right into the Forbidden Forest, and didn't follow them until everyone had gone to sleep in their dormitory. In the film, right after Hagrid is taken away by the Minister, Harry and Ron see spiders crawling along Hagrid's window and follow them into the Forbidden Forest.

    In the book, Harry deduces and tells Ron that the girl who died in the fifth-floor bathroom was most likely Moaning Myrtle due to her "never leaving" there, before he finds the scrap of paper in the petrified Hermione's hand detailing the Basilisk as well as her personal note as to how it was travelling through the school, immediately after returning from the Forbidden Forest.

Also, in the book the teachers' comments after Lockhart has left them make it clear that they know he is incapable and were simply getting him out of the way.

    In the book, the entrance to the Chamber where Ginny was consisted of a solid wall on which two entwined serpents are carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds and when Harry speaks Parseltongue to open the entrance, the serpents part as the wall cracks open and the halves slide smoothly out of sight. In the film, the entrance consisted of a circular door with 7 snakes on it that were on the edge of the door and when Harry speaks Parseltongue to open the entrance, an eighth snake appears from the cylinder bit where the snakes are held and goes all around the door and whenever it approaches each snake's head, the snake's head backs away and allowing the door to be opened.

      In addition, Tom Riddle's reaction throughout the fight in the film was significantly calmer compared to the book. In the film, outside of yelling "No!" in shock and stating that the Basilisk can still use its other senses (see below), he does not react in any way to the Basilisk missing Harry.

      The film also has Riddle claiming that Harry Potter's parseltongue abilities are of no use against the Basilisk, as it was specifically trained to only obey him, something that was not in the book (and which conflicted with the revelation later on that Harry Potter was one of Voldemort's horcruxes).

    The film has Ginny reacting in a significantly calmer manner when awakening shortly after Tom Riddle's memory was destroyed than in the book. In the latter, in addition to admitting her unwilling role in the disaster, Ginny clearly was breaking down from the entire ordeal.

    In the novel, when Harry and Ginny find Ron and Lockhart, Lockhart (having lost his memory) says 'Hello', that the chamber is an odd sort of place and asks if the three live there to which Ron answers 'No'. In the film, this occurs before Harry enters the Chamber and finds Ginny and Lockhart having just caused the tunnel to collapse; He says 'Hello', asks Ron who he is to which he replies "Um... Ron Weasley." and Lockhart responds "Really? And who am I?" then Ron says to Harry through the gap hole of the rocks that Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired and that he hasn't got a clue who he is. Then Lockhart picks up a stone, gives it a short throw then asks Ron if he lives in the Chamber (and also gives the stone to Ron) to which Ron replies "No." and Lockhart replies "Really?" and then Ron does something he never did in the book: He hits the stone on the top of the left side of Lockhart's head and he falls back down (presumably unconscious).

    In the book, just after Dobby was freed, Malfoy raises his wand threateningly at Harry, before Dobby tells him to leave. In the film, it sounds like Lucius Malfoy starts saying "
    <a href="Killing Curse.html" key="8d3c71de-e917-4ac4-9b1e-1f362b080166" title="Killing Curse">
     Avada Kedavra

    " before Dobby blasts him backwards across the hall (the spell was the result of an ad-lib by Jason Isaacs).

    In the book, Lucius Malfoy says to Harry, "Someday you'll meet the same sticky end as your parents. They were meddlesome fools too." In the film, he said, "Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. Mark my words, Potter - one day soon, you're going to meet the same, sticky end."

    During the dinner scene, the scene where Gryffindor wins the House cup again is cut, though it is nonetheless implied.

      Hermione originally hugged both Harry and Ron in the book upon revealing that she had been cured. In the film, she only hugs Harry, and just gives a hesitant handshake to Ron (note, this was the result of Emma Watson being hesitant to hug both Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint in public view, with her hugging Radcliffe during filming having to be frozen for a few seconds to get the desired effect due to Watson breaking the hug too quickly). This also unintentionally foreshadowed her and Ron's hesitant blossoming feelings for each other in the succeeding films.

      In addition, Hagrid's arrival has him apologising for his lateness, explaining his release from Azkaban was delayed due to the letter requesting his release getting lost, and proceeding to blame a bird named Errol for it getting lost, causing Ron to give a slightly embarrassed look. This was not present in the book.
