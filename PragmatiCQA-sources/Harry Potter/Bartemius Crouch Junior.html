   In
   1981
   , shortly after Voldemort's first defeat, Crouch allegedly participated in the
   capture and torture
   of
   Frank
   and
   Alice Longbottom
   along with the
   Lestranges
   , using the
   Cruciatus Curse
   to drive the two
   Aurors
   to insanity. Crouch and his comrades were sentenced to life imprisonment in
   Azkaban
   for their crimes by his own father.

   Crouch and his parents hatched a plot under which Crouch's mother would take his place in Azkaban, using the
   Polyjuice Potion
   to disguise herself. She died and was buried in Azkaban, with the result that the wizarding world believed that Crouch himself was dead. Crouch spent the following years living under his father's
   Imperius Curse
   . He eventually broke free with the help of Voldemort, who had learned that Crouch was still alive, making him enter the Dark Lord's service again.

   Department of Magical Law Enforcement

   Barty's father chose to make a public example of his son, and sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment in
   Azkaban
   at the age of roughly nineteen. According to
   Sirius Black
   , the trial was no more than an excuse to show how much the father hated the child, as the elder Crouch went as far as to drown out his son's voice by shouting the announcement of sentencing, and Barty was screaming inside his cell for his mother for the first few days, but then quieted down from the extreme depressive influence of the Dementors, as did many other prisoners. Barty already looked in poor health when he was brought in, as Sirius described.

   In
   1982
   , his
   mother's
   health had deteriorated drastically from the stress of her son's imprisonment, as did Barty's own from the severe depression inflicted by the prison. The couple were allowed to visit due to Bartemius Snr's high status in the Ministry and as Mrs Crouch's dying wish. She persuaded her husband to help
   smuggle their son out of Azkaban
   by swapping him for his mother. Using
   Polyjuice Potion
   , and undetected by the blind
   Dementors
   , Mrs Crouch took the place of her son. She died a short time later, and was buried outside the fortress under the guise of her son.

   Bartemius Jnr was brought back to the family household, where he was nursed back to health by their
   house-elf
   Winky
   . Revitalised, Barty's only goal is to search for his master, which he made no efforts to hide from his father. Bartemius Snr, overcame with grief and guilt, sought long and hard to subjugate his wayward son, to protect his son's secret existence from public and to prevent him from searching for Voldemort. In the end, the elder Crouch was forced to use the
   Imperius Curse
   on his son when he found no other methods capable of the feat of controlling him, and forced him to hide under an
   Invisibility cloak
   at all times. Winky was assigned to become Barty's caretaker and keeper, where she would constantly tried to persuade his father to reward him for good behaviour (even if it was only a byproduct of the Imperius Curse).

   Bertha Jorkins

   Memory Charm
   so powerful that she suffered permanent brain damage. Shortly thereafter,

   After the World Cup was through, Barty
   launched
   the

   Stunning Spells
   through the woods, crisscrossing the area where Barty and Winky had been, rendering them both unconscious and breaking the spell Winky had used to bind Barty to her in the chaos. Winky was dismissed for being found with Harry's wand, which was proven to have produced the Dark Mark, as well as her guardianship being proven unreliable due to Barty Jnr acquiring a wand and nearly escaping. Bartemius Snr found his son's unconscious body behind the bushes, and recasted the Imperius Curse on him after the other officials left, and the two returned home.

   without having appeared to do so. Barty accomplished this by breaking into former Auror

   Polyjuice Potion
   from Alastor's hair and concealed the Auror in his own

   . He then proceeded to take over Alastor's job at

   . He was able to maintain his disguise for months undetected by consistently sipping the potion from a
   hip flask
   ; he did so in plain view of students and staff, and it was generally assumed that this was due to intense paranoia. He kept Moody alive under the Imperius Curse to continue harvesting hair for the Polyjuice Potion, and to question him about his personality, behaviour and knowledge, in order to make the act more convincing.

   Upon entering Hogwarts'
   Start-of-Term Feast
   with Moody's appearance, he received applause only from Dumbledore and Hagrid, both of whom stopped quickly after realising that absolutely nobody else clapped, as everyone was too fixated on Barty's scarred facade. Barty then ignored the jug of
   Pumpkin Juice
   on the
   High Table
   and instead took a swig out of Moody's flask, administering a new dosage of the Polyjuice Potion while upholding his disguise's personality of fearing of being poisoned by food prepared by others.

   Barty used his time at Hogwarts to gain the trust of the students and staff at Hogwarts. During his first lesson for a group of
   fourth year
   students, he demonstrated all three
   Unforgivable Curses
   on three different spiders
   and controversially, later also the
   Imperius Curse
   on the students themselves, although he claimed to have had permission to do so, in order to teach them how to overcome it. As a teacher, Barty (under the guise as Alastor) was actually quite effective. Despite his ulterior motives, his teaching of how to overcome curses such as the Imperius was valuable with Harry Potter, who gained the ability to resist even Lord Voldemort himself as a result of this training. He was also a strict teacher, as he kept his students working until the end of the classes despite most of them being distracted by the Christmas festivities.

   During the events surrounding the Tournament, Bartemius Snr escaped from his home and travelled to Hogwarts, where he wandered in his confusion in search of Dumbledore, planning on confessing about how he smuggled his son from
   Azkaban
   . Voldemort immediately sent an owl to Hogwarts warning Barty Jnr that his father would likely show up at Hogwarts. Bartemius Snr came upon Harry and
   Viktor Krum
   , but by then, he was so delusional and insane that he was unable to clearly convey anything beyond what appeared to be ramblings about his son and Bertha. The former went to the castle to fetch Albus. Barty Jnr, having kept an eye on the
   Marauder's Map
   he borrowed from Potter, arrived at the scene before anyone else, and waited for Harry to leave before he stunned

   In his youth, Barty was described as being a pale young man with straw-coloured hair and freckles.
   In his early thirties, he still had pale, slightly freckled skin and a "mop of fair hair", but his face was lined, and was much older-looking.
   During his confession under

   , Barty's face would alight with diabolical mania. Prior to his capture and arrest, he often sported a
   pocket watch
   , though unlike his father's, his was golden in colour. Being a Death Eater, he bears the Dark Mark on his inner left forearm.

He was obviously a rather powerful wizard, having demonstrated sufficient magical ability to
   bewitch
   the
   Goblet of Fire
   into believing that four schools participated in the Triwizard Tournament in order for Harry to participate in the contest despite the object's power. Barty was also perceptively observant and exceptionally manipulative; his keen attention to the habits and motivations of others enabled him to impersonate

   Dangerously clever and fearsomely determined, Bartemius proved capable of orchestrating the events of the Triwizard Tournament so that Harry Potter would be transported to Voldemort, in order to ensure his master's return. Barty's high intelligence also made him bitingly cynical and he remarked how easy some people were to manipulate — he
   <i key="dc6ee5bd-f9a6-4530-8eac-b6430b4f98e0">
    was
   </i>
   capable of concern for his plans, and expressed his fear that Harry would have failed the Second Task. He also expressed frustration for how slowly Harry progressed in Barty's plans, citing Harry's weakness of pride as the reason.
  </p>
  <p key="4427e363-1003-4f02-8d05-106153a25265">
   Barty was extremely devoted to Voldemort and regarded him as a father figure. His loyalty was matched only by fellow Death Eater

    Bellatrix Lestrange
   </a>
   . He also seemed to know much of
   Voldemort's father
   , comparing him with his own father. This may imply that Barty was aware of Voldemort's status of being
   half-blood
   , but did not care, in contradiction to the Death Eaters' belief of
   <a href="Pure-blood.html" key="ef764da7-0131-4647-938c-a1e9d565268d" title="Pure-blood">

   supremacy, or that Voldemort simply superseded the blood status. However, Barty's immense loyalty to Voldemort blinded him to those who truly
   loved
   him, namely
   his mother
   and the family's devoted house-elf
   Winky
   . They sacrificed much to give him a second chance at a happy life, which Barty tragically wasted in his obsession to reunite with Voldemort. As with many other Death Eaters, Barty had deluded himself into believing that he alone understood Voldemort, and that they were closest to each other due to their commons, to which was in fact not true as Voldemort never desired a friend nor understood human affections.
  </p>
  <p key="a6946adb-eef8-4399-b146-56327b0d7d40">
   One reason for Barty's behaviour may be the fact that his
   father
   neglected him during his childhood and/or teenage years, and later forced him to spend years under the
   Imperius Curse
   in relative isolation, possibly affecting his mental stability. The year he spent in
   Azkaban
   also furthered his mental decline, due to the effects of the
   Dementors
   . He was also likely very sadistic, not only did he participate in torturing the Longbottoms, but forced their son

   to watch a demonstration of the Cruciatus Curse on a spider, despite the latter's bizarre and panicked response. However, this latter act could have been what the real Moody would have done himself, and possibly it was indeed to teach the students the harsh truths about the Curses.

  <p key="abaff891-0e97-4ca3-8878-7dc45abedef3">
   Crouch also loved

   in his youth, a fact mentioned by Winky. Also, as a young man, he was extremely emotional, weeping and screaming before he was sent to the Dementors and pleading violently with his father to grant him leniency. He screamed constantly in Azkaban — but this can be supremely expected among the prisoners of Dementors. This could be seen as hypocritical, as he snarled at Death Eaters for hiding and refusing to brave Azkaban in Voldemort's name, which is what he did himself.

   Barty was one of the only known wizards to call Voldemort by his name 'Voldemort' instead of using 'the Dark Lord' or a different version of it, saying his name while talking to Harry after the Third Task. He was also the only known
   Death Eater
   to do so; even defectors such as

However, Crouch's acting skills were still imperfect, as shown when after Voldemort had been resurrected, Crouch foolishly took Harry away from Dumbledore to kill him, so he would be honoured even more by Voldemort, which was something the real Moody would never do, allowing Dumbledore to finally realise that Crouch has been impersonating Moody.

   Crouch Jnr's father, as a high-ranking
   Ministry
   official, spent his entire life dedicated to
   eradicating
   the
   Dark
   forces, and as such, didn't pay enough attention to his own son. When Crouch Jnr was caught with other
   Death Eaters
   at the crime scene of
   torture
   of
   Alice
   and
   Frank Longbottom
   to insanity, his father's parental affection extended to as much as giving him a trial, something he did not always give other suspects. In the end, the trial was merely to make an example out of his own son, and to publicly disown him, making clear he had nothing to do with anyone who would even remotely be connected to the committing of such a horrible crime. Crouch Snr mercilessly sentenced his own son to
   Azkaban
   for life.
  </p>
  <p key="f5c4c50e-e025-4c08-ba41-918ae955bcf0">
   A little over a year later, the father, as a favour for his
   dying wife
   , smuggled him out of prison and kept him under control with the
   Imperius Curse
   for years to come. By Crouch Jnr's claim, his father loved only his wife and not him, but this was only in his own perception. The elder Barty's willingness to sacrifice his wife to spend her last days in the horrific Azkaban to rescue their son may be indicating that he retained some paternal affection for him, despite many believed otherwise. It was this sentence that cost Crouch Snr his chance to become
   Minister for Magic
   , his position as Head of the
   Department of Magical Law Enforcement
   , and his wife to suffer her last few days in Azkaban. It was also this sentence that caused Barty Snr to be demoted to the Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. When the elder Crouch was subjugated by Voldemort and escaped, he decided to tell Dumbledore of everything, including that he smuggled his own son out of prison; it was during this moment that Crouch (in a delusive state) expressed his regret to Harry Potter of mistreating and neglecting his son, blaming himself for the young man's choice of life.
  </p>
  <p key="cbdc9229-542a-4afa-84ba-bb7a95fb6e56">
   Crouch Jnr, in turn, hated his father, considering him to be a very disappointing parent. Being sent to Azkaban for one year and imprisoned in his own mind for twelve only increased the friction between father and son. Crouch also claimed that he suffered the indignity of being named after his father and had the "great pleasure" of finally murdering him. Adding insult to injury, he transfigured his father's body into a bone and buried it, showing callous, but understandable disrespect for the corpse with a crude method of disposing it.

  <p key="4cd02eb7-55b8-46b4-b5b5-502715ce2a49">
   His
   mother
   loved him very much, and persuaded her husband to help him escape
   Azkaban
   . He also apparently had some affection for his mother as it is revealed that he was "screaming for his mother" during his early days in Azkaban. She was about to die when her son was imprisoned, so she drank
   Polyjuice Potion
   and disguised as him to take his place at Azkaban. She died a short time later, and was buried outside Azkaban. However, rather than start afresh and repent for his crimes, he tried to use the opportunity to look for Lord Voldemort and help bring him back to power, apparently his year in prison and hatred for his father caused him to forget his love for his mother, tragically wasting all of her efforts for him.

   Winky the
   house-elf
   was extremely loyal to the
   Crouch family
   , to the point of surpassing the mere house-elf's magical binding. She took care of Crouch Jnr when he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and became his carer and keeper. She was extremely devoted to this duty, and was very motherly towards him, asking his father to reward him occasionally for good behaviour (even though it was no more than a by-product of the
   Imperius Curse
   ). Winky spent months to persuade Crouch Snr to let his son attend the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, and tried to suppress her acrophobia in order to keep an eye on the hidden convict. This all proved how much she loved him, despite his crimes. She was devastated when she was dismissed for failure, and became horrified when she heard of how Crouch Jnr killed his father.
  </p>
  <p key="d68359c8-efc0-4187-8b70-0ec57e31baf2">
   Crouch Jnr, on the other hand, thought that Winky's motherly nature was only out of pity and magic-bound duty. He launched the Dark Mark in the camp-site in order to scare disloyal Death Eaters, ignoring her efforts to keep him safe and hidden. He also showed no reciprocating affection for her as he ungratefully used her affections to achieve his goal of serving the Dark Lord, and gave a maniacal smile during his interrogation while she was there, the latter terrifying her.

   In contrast with his real father, Crouch saw Lord Voldemort as a father figure of sorts, and after having been disowned by his own father, was fanatically devoted to him. In fact, at that point, Crouch was willing to sacrifice and give absolutely everything to serve the Dark Lord. He also believed that if he finished off

   , he would be welcomed back, closer than a real son and honoured beyond his dreams. In essence, Barty's loyalty is only matched by fellow Death Eater

  <p key="b31a881e-dd2c-470e-917f-485785f885c2">
   Crouch's loyalty had  led him to know many things about Lord Voldemort that even other loyal Death Eaters, such as Bellatrix, presumably do not. Barty knew  that Voldemort had a
   disappointing father
   , that he suffered the indignity of being named after that father, and that he had the great pleasure of killing his father to ensure the rise of the dark order.
   These three common threads helped to fuel Barty's loyalty. This also implies that Barty was  aware of Voldemort's
   blood status
   as a
   half-blood
   , but did not  care,  in contradiction to the Death Eaters' belief of
   <a href="Pure-blood.html" key="2042fcb0-6303-4b98-9c56-79003343044d" title="Pure-blood">

   supremacy.
  </p>
  <p key="6b373399-73f1-4311-b791-d26f6f69fdf7">
   It could very well be that Voldemort told Barty these similarities between the two and used them as a way to get Barty to join him. Voldemort could have simply told Barty about his father being disappointing while neglecting to reveal that Tom Riddle Snr was a Muggle. Voldemort seems to have acknowledged Barty's worth, something his own father failed to do, referring to Barty as "
   <i key="81855c84-c66a-4350-97a2-49bc68e887ac">
    his most faithful servant
   </i>
   ". However, for all of Voldemort's public claims, he never truly cared for Barty any more than as a useful servant who is as easily disposable as any other, as Voldemort never wanted a friend. Although it is likely that he missed him for his usefulness and complete loyalty.

   Death Eaters
   who had abandoned faith in Lord Voldemort. He believed that those who would not brave Azkaban for him and denied their affiliation with him were unforgivable—apparently having completely forgotten that he was once like that himself as he screamed his innocence in the courtroom. Barty practically begged Harry to tell him that Voldemort punished the Death Eaters for their thirteen years of disloyalty, to hurt them for their lack of faith.

   revive
   the Dark Lord. Though it's also possible that he appreciated Pettigrew's role in finding their master in the first place, as well as helping to free him from his father's Imperius Curse, Pettigrew's neglect of guarding Crouch Snr may have nevertheless left another negative thought from Barty. Peter on the other hand seemed somewhat resentful that Voldemort compared him unfavourably to Barty in terms of skill and loyalty.

   that it was unknown if Barty was guilty or innocent. It could be that the only reason Barty desired Harry's death was to appease his master, and held no personal grudge. In fact, Barty seemed delighted when Harry proved to be able to throw off the Imperius curse in class; however, this is ultimately debatable, and could have just been part of Barty's act. However, when Crouch exposed himself, he did state how annoyed he was at Harry's pride being a setback for the plan, which forced Crouch to improvise to compensate.

In fact, Barty wanted to kill Harry and learn what had happened at the Graveyard. Dumbledore realised that he wasn't the real Moody, knowing that the genuine Moody would never have removed Harry from Dumbledore's sight after having been told not to, and ran at Barty's office. Dumbledore stunned Barty just as he was going to kill Harry. Harry noted that Dumbledore was in such a fury, that his eyes seemed like having a blue flame, and Harry realised why Dumbledore was considered the one wizard Voldemort always feared. Dumbledore was disgusted by Barty's patricide, as well as abusing and ignoring the love his mother and Winky gave him, and bound him up for it. After Barty's exposure, Dumbledore learned that he was given the

    The name Bartemius originates from the Biblical name Bartimaeus, a man who was blind all his life until
    Jesus
    healed him. Aside from being named after his father, the reasons for naming after a blind man may be due to the fact Bartemius was quite oblivious to his mother's and house-elf's love. It may also reflect his blind devotion to Voldemort. Somewhat similar to the Biblical figure, Crouch lived under a disability (the
    Imperius Curse
    ) for years until breaking free.

     <li key="5e809edf-25d0-4cc6-bf87-c9e89e705fde">
      Crouch, a manipulative man and clearly a convincing actor (he was able to convincingly pose as Alastor Moody for over nine months), was trying to escape prison to resume searching for Voldemort.
     </li>
     <li key="2d3ad742-6d40-4b8d-aabe-a92a2a8d74ac">
      Barty, like virtually everyone else in Wizarding Britain, feared Azkaban, and the knowledge of his impending lifetime conviction (as well as the six Dementors in the room at the time) caused him to lose his nerve.
     </li>
     <li key="11da0d48-2d89-4e7d-abce-69c873f98772">
      Due to his time in Azkaban, not to mention the years he subsequently spent under the Imperius curse, Barty may have simply gone insane, and disregarded his own actions.
     </li>
     <li key="cabb008c-a9a0-4e88-a558-e9ab3981335c">
      It should be noted, however, that at no point during his trial does Barty actually deny being a Death Eater. He simply denied being involved in torturing the Longbottoms (he specifically cries out
      <i key="363981df-892b-41df-b56f-6252bf5077b2">
       "I wasn't involved!"
      </i>
      ), and begged his father not to send him back to the Dementors.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="df5e7662-7474-4fbd-8d32-a616bf66b9e0">
    In the film version, Barty Crouch Jnr has the habit of licking his lips when threatened, in a snake-like way, to which he occasionally shows while under the disguise of Alastor Moody. This habit led to him giving himself away to his father following the second task of the Triwizard Tournament.
    <ul key="83df6cc5-86f0-4fff-9f3b-4baa6d8032de">
     <li key="8cafb27b-aaa8-4e83-b904-e2b2cd93d4e2">
      The snake-like licking of his lips was improvised by David Tennant himself and is followed by Brendan Gleeson, when Barty is disguised as Mad-Eye Moody.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="22a8ed1a-39b4-4f08-9290-b9e696e880aa">
    In the films, anyone who takes Polyjuice Potion has their voice remain the same, the only change being in appearance (to help avoid confusing the audience because of this change). This does not seem to be the case for Barty Crouch Jnr when he turns into Alastor Moody, however it does not seem impossible that Barty was imitating Moody's voice the entire time, or that the filmmakers decided to make this an exception since his transformation was kept secret (unlike the others that occurred throughout the films) and therefore the audience would not be aware beforehand until his identity was exposed at the end of the film (though it is notable that Crouch Jnr, without by Polyjuice, only had three lines before his exposure and was not identified, so the change in voice might not have been necessary for someone who hasn't seen

    before).
   </li>
   <li key="0e70c2f7-351f-4a4f-a4d7-dfe408074a65">
    Barty Crouch Jnr was the first person to escape Azkaban, not Sirius Black (although Black was the first to do it on his own). Black's escape was discovered immediately after it was done, leading to this misconception.
   </li>
   <li key="70b2536b-04ec-418f-9508-795744aa34e8">
    Crouch thought that killing Harry would please Voldemort. In fact, Voldemort would have been furious, since he repeatedly stated that only he would kill Harry.
   </li>
   <li key="9129eac3-b21d-4e79-ad75-6386ed1b6300">
    Ironically, considering his fanatical loyalty to Voldemort, Crouch's lessons on the Imperius Curse's effects while disguised as Moody are what allowed Harry to ultimately resist Voldemort's attempts at using the Imperius curse later on.
   </li>
   <li key="cb511eea-6ce4-42e1-aa4a-10deacc8a4e3">
    In the book Barty changes back into himself because he was unable to take the Polyjuice Potion in time due to being knocked out by Dumbledore and Snape earlier. In the film he runs out of potion, which also causes him to blow his cover by nervously asking Harry about the graveyard, despite Harry never mentioning a graveyard in the first place.
   </li>
   <li key="2e838a8d-9e80-4cd7-91f8-b7572357f553">
    Coincidentally, the first episode of

     Doctor Who

    in which David Tennant portrays the
    Tenth Doctor
    is called "
    The Parting of the Ways
    ". The last chapter in which Barty appears in the book is also called "The Parting of the Ways". The amount of time the characters appear is also very similar. Crouch appears for the first page of the book's chapter, and the Tenth Doctor appears in the final scene of the
