   In
   1943
   , sometime into Myrtle's education, the
   Chamber of Secrets
   was opened for the first time.
   The Chamber of Secrets was a legendary chamber built by
   Salazar Slytherin

   On her final day of her life,
   13 June
   1943
   , Myrtle was teased by student
   Olive Hornby
   , who made fun of Myrtle's
   glasses
   and left Myrtle alone sobbing. Myrtle then ran into one of the bathroom's stalls and started crying. Shortly after Myrtle had entered the bathroom,

   Parseltongue
   in order to open the
   Chamber of Secrets
   , the entrance of which was hidden behind the sink in front of the very stall occupied by Myrtle at the time. The

   basilisk

  <p key="a183e5b6-4414-4979-b302-faed7860a498">
   Myrtle, still in one of the stalls, recognised the voice as being that of a boy. Opening the stall's door, she was about to yell at Riddle to go away. On Riddle's command, the Basilisk stared at Myrtle and her eyes met with the monster's. Since looking into a Basilisk's eyes is a fatal act, Myrtle was killed instantly and her body fell to the bathroom floor, becoming Tom's first victim.
   Tom (later known as Lord Voldemort) used her murder to make his first

   so she could haunt student
   Olive Hornby
   in revenge for her bullying. Myrtle attended the wedding of Olive's
   brother
   uninvited, and apparently caused a massive scene to remind Olive of she bullied her, causing a huge mess. Olive went to the
   Ministry of Magic
   to restrain Myrtle, who was thereafter obliged to remain at

   Ever since, Myrtle haunted the bathroom where she had died, although she was sometimes seen in other bathrooms, and was even flushed into the lake occasionally. As a result of her haunting, her lavatory grave was rarely used, and was thus available for clandestine activities, such as forbidden

   that the murdered student had been killed in a bathroom, and Harry realised that the student must have been Myrtle.
   Myrtle was flattered by Harry's request that she tell the story of her death, the manner of which was one of the most important and interesting events of her short life. (It is possible that Harry was the first person to treat it as something worth asking about.) Myrtle remembered only having seen a pair of enormous yellow eyes, but neither Harry nor Ron recognised this as a clue that the monster was a
   basilisk
   . Hermione had already deduced the monster's nature by
   library
   research before she was

   , so Myrtle's clue was of no practical importance. However her presence in the bathroom combined with Hermione's clue about the basilisk's use of pipes did single the bathroom out as the entrance to the chamber of secrets.
