    Magic
   </b>
   was a supernatural force that changed aspects of the world at fundamental levels. The ability for
   humans
   to use magic was a
   hereditary trait
   passed down from a person's ancestors, which allowed

    witches and wizards
   </a>
   to practise it. Rather than being a mystical or unnatural pursuit that defied the laws of nature, however, magic simply allowed those who could wield it to exploit them in very specific and creative ways that Muggle science were unable to replicate.

   One example of this, for example, was in how
   Vanishment
   did not actually make objects cease to exist, but rather, according to

    into non-being, which is to say, everything
   </i>
   ", which was consistent with the law of conservation of matter and energy.
   Magic also followed its own set of rules with respect to what it could do, such as how
   Conjured
   objects could only exist for a temporary period of time,
   and objects couldn't be enlarged beyond a certain point without becoming unstable and/or exploding.

With the separation of the two worlds now put into effect, all of wizardkind went into hiding for good, forming their own isolated communities. In Britain, wizarding families began to cluster around
   small towns
   up and down the country, where they found relative safety and anonymity in numbers. The responsibility of the various wizarding governments in each country was laid out for maintaining the secrecy of everything magical, from Quidditch games to dragons.

   The magical governments of each country suppressed all exposure of anything magical to Muggles. As decades passed without incident, magic slowly faded into obscurity and became the stuff of fairy tales and legend for non-magical people, with the few clinging to these beliefs being seen as
   mad

   Wizardkind were also weakened when in the presence of Dementors for prolonged periods, as said creatures attacked their prey psychologically by making them recall their worst memories. This in turn left the victims physically vulnerable. Dementors sucked the happiness out of any one in their presence, making it hard to preform magic, as casting spells required a certain level of emotional stability.
   This was one of the reasons the Patronus Charm was considered such advanced magic.
   Several spells involved the use of emotion when casting them. The

   </a>
   required the caster to concentrate on a happy memory.
   Force of will under extenuating circumstances also helped in casting spells, and affected the force with which they were cast. An example of this was when Harry was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus when Sirius Black was in danger of being administered the

   Voldemort attempted to overcome this obstacle by using Harry's blood in his

   Harry used very much the same mechanism of sacrificial protection to negate the power of Voldemort's spells against the students and teachers of

   Voldemort had availed himself of other methods, being one of the few wizards ever to use

   Summoning Charm

   Charms was also something of a catch-all for spells that weren't Transfiguration (spells that changed the inherent nature of an object).
   In some sense, if a spell wasn't

  <p key="f66034d4-fa9a-43f7-ba28-d5108d4752b4">
   A charm might cause something to flash different colours. It might cause an object to
   levitate
   or even fly through the air.
   Charms could make a person laugh or dance or even create a bubble of breathable air around a person's head. In all of these cases, the object or the person didn't really change, they just did something unexpected. Some Charms could be extremely powerful. The
   Fidelius Charm
   , for example, could completely hide a person or a place in such a way that no one could find them unless they were given the location by a
   Secret-Keeper
   .
   Memory Charms
   could be so strong that they completely removed a person's memory or even damaged their mind permanently.

   The Dark Arts differed from other forms of magic in the intent of the wizard using it. Most magic was relatively neutral — it could be used for bad or good. Some magic, however, was evil in its intention through and through. Spells of this kind were often called

Although offensive and potentially dangerous curses existed in number, three were considered usable only for great evil, which earned them the special classification of "
   Unforgivable Curses
   ".
   Ultimately, the deep, true intention of the caster was what made the difference.

  <p key="266bfdf0-0e65-4cf6-8037-9e6e3da16028">
   Legilimency, a branch of magic not normally taught at Hogwarts (at least, not at
   Ordinary Wizarding Level
   ), was the ability to extract emotions, thoughts, and memories from another person's mind. Although the word literally translated as "mind-reading", this was considered a naive interpretation of the art by its practitioners. Someone who practised Legilimency was known as a Legilimens.
  </p>
  <p key="362a0718-5035-4eb3-a48c-c79d6e4e0f1b">
   Legilimency was easier when the spell-caster was physically near the target, and when the target was off-guard, relaxed, or otherwise vulnerable. Eye contact was often essential, so it was useful for a Legilimens to verbally manipulate his or her target into meeting the Legilimens's eyes, with the fringe benefit that the target's emotional state might bring relevant associated memories to the surface. All of this seemed to tally quite nicely with what is known of the nature of human memory in Muggle science. The only known defence against Legilimency was

  <p key="2cae389e-6deb-4205-ab47-31ec3ff3227c">
   Occlumency was the art of magically defending the mind against external penetration, sealing it against magical intrusion and influence — the defensive counter to Legilimency. A practitioner of Occlumency was referred to as an Occlumens.
  </p>
  <p key="0670afba-1b82-4fec-a9df-8debff69a8bd">
   Occlumency was a necessary prerequisite to defeat a Legilimens's lie-detector abilities without suspicious behaviour such as avoiding face-to-face contact and eye contact. Elementary Occlumency involved clearing the mind of thought and emotion, so that the Legilimens could find no emotional ties to memories that the target wished to conceal. Simple resistance to attack required similar skills to those needed to resist the
   Imperius Curse
   . In its more advanced form, Occlumency allowed the user to suppress only feelings and memories that contradicted what the user wished a Legilimens to believe, thus allowing the Occlumens to lie without self-betrayal.

   Divination was magic which attempted to foresee future events. Many in the wizarding world considered this branch of magic to be imprecise at best. There were several types of Divination. The most imprecise was what was commonly known as "fortunetelling", and this was what Sybill Trelawney taught at Hogwarts.
   The second kind of Divination was what was practised by the
   centaurs
   . When

  <p key="aeb01240-81f9-4a71-8158-07efec58cd08">
   The third type of Divination was called Seeing. This was true Divination, although what the
   Seer
   revealed was usually in the form of a
   Prophecy
   which then itself required some interpretation. A Seer, one who possessed the
   Inner Eye
   , didn't seem to have control over their Seeing. Trelawney, for example, only made actual prophecies three times, although she made plenty of claims about everything from troubles ahead for various students to

   In each case when she made an actual prophecy, Trelawney went into a trance and spoke in a completely different voice, and after speaking

  <p key="4908cfc8-be72-4a34-8a49-c864cfdade81">
   True Seeing was very rare, but it had happened plenty of times over the centuries. There was a huge cathedral-sized room of the
   Department of Mysteries
   where records of thousands of prophecies were stored in glass spheres. Each sphere was labelled with the initials of the Seer who spoke the Prophecy and the person it was spoken to and with the subject of the Prophecy.
