    Aragog
   </b>
   (c.
   1942
   –
   20 April
   1997
   ) was an
   Acromantula
   owned by
   <a href="Rubeus Hagrid.html" key="eb551bde-8837-4f66-88e1-354efa0e964a" title="Rubeus Hagrid">
    Rubeus Hagrid
   </a>
   . Like the rest of his species, Aragog had a taste for
   human
   flesh
   and was able to communicate with humans with speech. In his youth, he was the size of a
   Pekingese
   and near the end of his life was about the size of a small
   elephant
   with an eighteen-foot leg span.
  </p>
  <p key="47d687d8-0771-4c5f-95f0-168c658c5631">
   Aragog had a wife,
   Mosag
   , and was the leader of a large
   Acromantula colony
   composed of all of his sons and daughters.
   During his life, Aragog was accused of being
   Slytherin's Monster
   ,
   although this was really a
   basilisk
   .
   Ironically, all
   spiders
   feared the
   basilisk
   , as it was their mortal enemy.
   After Aragog died, some of his
   venom
   was taken by
   Horace Slughorn
   and was most likely sold later on.

   in the school after the monster were unleashed. But when one of its victims,
   Moaning Myrtle
   , died in a
   bathroom
   , it motivated the school's governors to consider closing the school. Tom, who considered Hogwarts his only home, found out about Aragog after discovering the young Hagrid tending to the Acromantula, and used Aragog as a scapegoat for the monster's rampage. Tom came to capture the creature, but Hagrid helped Aragog escape to the
   Forbidden Forest
   . Hagrid was later punished with expulsion from the school. Aragog, meanwhile, had to live alone in the Forest.

   Hagrid would visit Aragog now and then, bringing him food. On one particular visit, Hagrid brought Aragog a wife,
   Mosag

   colony
   . Sometime later, Aragog became blind.

   Arriving at

   Myrtle's
   body in the bathroom and added that he was not the Chamber's resident monster but however gave them a small clue of it; the monster was born in the castle unlike him and that his species never speak nor mention its name or anything about it as they fear it above other
   creatures
   . He only revealed that the creature in the Chamber was ancient. Aragog told the two that while he showed mercy to Hagrid, he would not deny his many children fresh meat—even if they were Hagrid's friends. However, thanks to the
   Flying Ford Anglia
   , Aragog's children failed to eat the two boys, as they both escaped the forest by flying away in the

   he eventually died on

   1997
   . Before this time, it had been dangerous for Hagrid to go and visit Aragog because, sensing the giant spider's weakness, his family was getting rather restive and possibly preparing to devour him (Aragog). When Aragog died, Hagrid was able to get Aragog's corpse out of the colony before his children could attempt to cannibalise his corpse, though barely as they would no longer hold back in an attempt to devour Hagrid. Aragog was buried in a deep pit near Hagrid's house the next evening.
   Aragog's funeral
   was attended by Hagrid, Harry, and Professor
   Horace Slughorn

   Aragog had a close friendship with his former owner, Hagrid. He admitted that it would have been his instinct to try to attack humans, but he restrained himself out of respect and gratitude for Hagrid, and never personally harmed a
   human
   in his life. In fact, Hagrid was the only human that Aragog stopped his sons and daughters from attacking. Otherwise, he would not deprive them of fresh meat and would allow his sons and daughters to attack unsuspecting humans. One such case was when Ron Weasley and Harry Potter found Aragog, though this was more than likely an act of parental care as opposed to anger or hatred. However, the two managed to escape by sheer luck, as the Weasleys' enchanted
   Ford Anglia
   emerged to extract them from the danger.

   Aragog, like all spiders, feared
