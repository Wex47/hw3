   and his
   Death Eaters
   . The original Order was created in the
   1970s
   . It was constructed after Voldemort returned to
   England
   from abroad and started his campaign to take over the
   Ministry of Magic
   and persecute
   Muggle-borns
   . The Order worked with the Ministry to oppose the Dark Lord and his followers, and played a crucial role in the
   First Wizarding War
   . Their first victory came in
   1981
   , with Voldemort's first defeat at the hands of
   <a href="Harry Potter.html" key="181dd8dc-7b26-43ec-95a0-3453a4f8f97c" title="Harry Potter">

   . The victory came with the high cost of many of their members.

  <p key="53151af4-d3af-438d-8a03-430a9ccd21a1">
   The Order disbanded but was reconvened in 1995 after Harry Potter informed Dumbledore of
   Lord Voldemort's return
   . The Ministry refused to admit that the Dark Lord had returned, thus the Order alone worked to protect Harry Potter and
   the prophecy
   concerning him and Voldemort in the
   Department of Mysteries
   . After an
   intense battle
   that occurred there on
   18 June
   1996
   between the Order, Dumbledore's Army, and the Death Eaters, the Ministry finally admitted the truth.

   The following year would see the Order losing their leader and the Ministry being conquered by Voldemort. The Order remained an underground resistance, trying to protect

   It was not enough to save them, however; Dumbledore offered to be the Potters'

   Because Lily had willingly sacrificed herself out of love for her son, Harry was shielded from the spell, and the curse backfired. Because Voldemort made

After learning from Snape's memories that he had to die in order for Voldemort to be defeated, Harry willingly went to Voldemort. He let the Dark Lord hit him with a

    Also in the
    films
    , Order members are shown as Apparating in clouds of white smoke, while the Death Eaters Apparate in clouds of black smoke. This may be a reference to the Death Eaters' use and corruption by Dark Magic, causing them to apparate in black smoke, as opposed to the white smoke of the Order members.

     Molly Weasley

    is not stated to have been a member of the original Order, despite her brothers being members. This is likely due to the fact that she gave birth to, and took care of,

    If the list of members of the Order of the Phoenix, above, is complete, then the mortality rate (including permanent incapacitation) of members, during the First and Second Wizarding Wars combined, rivals that of the
    in fourteenth-century Europe. About 44% of members died during the
    First Wizarding War
    , and 26% were killed by Death Eaters during the course of the
    Second Wizarding War
    .
    Horace Slughorn
    refers to this in
    <i key="e341045d-15db-49de-8772-2ece4bea2879">
     Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

   <li key="2d5a2788-97f0-453f-b81e-bdd3ac94ded1">
    Given the phoenix embossed on
    book
    , the Order of the Phoenix may actually go back to the fight against
    Gellert Grindelwald
    and the book may represent one of the other ways the Order had to communicate with one another.

    It may be that the Order of the Phoenix was inspired by the
    Fabian Society
    , where one of J.K. Rowling's professed favourite authors,
    Edith Nesbit
    , was a member. The argument is made more likely by the fact that several original members of the Order of the Phoenix seem to be named after members of the Fabian Society:
    <a href="Emmeline Vance.html" key="6fb4cb75-2e53-4697-ae84-77a6dff7dad0" title="Emmeline Vance">
     Emmeline Vance
    </a>
    for
    Emmeline Pankhurst
    ,
    Fabian Prewett
    for the Fabian Society itself,
    Sturgis Podmore
    for
    Frank Podmore
    , and
    Kingsley Shacklebolt
    for
    Kingsley Martin
    . The Fabian Society's members were also closely associated with a magical association called the
    Order of the Golden Dawn
    .

    In J.K. Rowling's early plot outlines of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (
    http://chandlermariecraig.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/rowling_outline2.gif
    ) it seems that the titles of the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army were swapped - the Order of the Phoenix being the group Harry, Ron and Hermione set up at Hogwarts, whilst Dumbledore's Army being Dumbledore's original army in the First Wizarding War.
