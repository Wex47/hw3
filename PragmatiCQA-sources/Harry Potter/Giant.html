   Some appeared as large and hairy humanoids, while others resembled humongous-sized people, and some may even have had bestial features (i.e. protruding sharp molars). Giants generally lived in tribes, although as their numbers dwindled, the tribes merged into larger groups. A Giant tribe was led by the strongest giant, known as the
   Gurg
   .
   Giants average between twenty and twenty five feet in height; a notable exception was
   Grawp
   , who was considered small at only sixteen feet.

   They are capable of learning

   When breeding, they pride themselves on having large babies, and disappointment would arise if the child was smaller than expected.

   Due to their lack of patience for resolving disputes verbally, they were not used to being cramped in small areas, and would fight against each other over the smallest matters, such as sleeping places and food. Even being a
   Gurg
   does not guarantee the complete loyalty of the tribe, as others may end up killing them to obtain the position, such as when

   Even without significant magical abilities, Giants were immensely powerful creatures. Gifted with overwhelming raw strength proportionate to their prodigious size, they were difficult to detain by wizards since most
   spells tend to have little to no effect upon them
   and may very well have been even stronger than
   dragons
   , as seen when six Ministry wizards came to subdue the half-giant, Hagrid. All of the stunning spells they sent at him only seemed to just bounce off.
   This was particularly noteworthy, since Sirius claimed that nothing less of at least half a dozen wizards casting said enchantments at the same time can stun a full-grown dragon into submission. However, similar to dragons, they may have certain weaker spots on their bodies, such as their eyes, as
   Olympe Maxime
   managed to subdue some of Golgomath's subordinates with the
   Conjunctivitis Curse
   (which attacks the eyes).
   It also seems apparent that, while giants may be resistant to many spells, their skin appears to be no more resistant to non-magical trauma than regular wizards, as evidenced by the fact that
   Grawp
   - a full-blooded giant - was injured by the centaurs' arrows in the spring of 1996, despite there being no indication that their bows and arrows have any magical properties.

   's loyalty to Dumbledore, as well as the insistence of Harry, Ron and Hermione (and likely eventually others after the Battle of Hogwarts) it is far more likely that wizardkind eventually wanted and managed to make peace and friendship with the surviving giants and let them live in remote habitats. However, considering their long life cycle and extremely small population size, it is not likely under any circumstances that the giant species would have remained extant for long after the end of the war, unless they were given more space on their own.
