   The Great Hall was a large hall with four long tables where students of each
   House
   sat during the day and at mealtimes. The staff table was at the front, where the entire Hogwarts staff sat. There was a throne-like chair in the centre of the table where the current
   Headmaster or Headmistress
   sat. The ceiling of the Great Hall was covered with
   candles
   and it was
   enchanted to look like the sky above

   To the left of the table was a door which led to
   a chamber with portraits

   , Lockhart decided to organise a "morale-booster" against the gloomy atmosphere generated by the Chamber of Secrets' opening. Come morning of
   Valentine's Day
   , Lockhart's "morale-booster" was revealed to be an overly lavish party, mainly for him to garner attention for himself more than to help the school residents regain their confidence. As the opening of this party, he overly decorated the Great Hall during breakfast with lurid pink flowers, falling heart-shaped confetti, and Lockhart himself dressed in matching pink robes. This vivid scene disgusted the majority of the staff, as well as some male students. However, female students who fawned over Lockhart's charm, were rather excited by this. When Harry first walked into the Great Hall for breakfast, the severe change in decor made him thought he walked through the wrong doors initially.

    . With the re-design of the front entrance to resemble the
    Clock Tower
    and its courtyard, the design team forgot to include stairs leading up to the Great Hall's elevated position that had been previously been represented by the
    Chamber of Reception
    . The floor level of the Great Hall is between the short and tall sets of windows. The short windows below the Great Hall had been originally designed for the
    Hogwarts kitchens
    , but that area was not seen in the films. The lack of stairs means that anyone walking through the new entrance would "magically" teleport up to the first floor, which is where the windows corresponding with the interior sets of the Entrance Hall and Great Hall were. The video games hid this issue by using different textures for the interior and exterior areas so they could exist at the same time. The issue was fixed in

    by inverting the window positions so that the taller windows that matched the floor of the interior sets were on the bottom of the model and then the smaller windows were on top (which completely removed the original intention of the smaller windows being for the Kitchens). However, it still was not fixed in

    The door behind the staff tables leads to a staircase, shown in the first film, which is architecturally impossible because the exterior wall is directly against the back wall of the Great Hall.

    While Hogwarts itself is based upon real castles is the UK, there was, obviously, a great deal of creative licence taken. The ceiling in the great hall, for example, is shown as having what is known as a hammer beam construction. The design was developed in the UK hundreds of years ago and used primarily in cathedrals, palaces, and royal homes. However, the weight of the ceiling, particularly under wind or snow load, would push the walls outward and collapse in on itself. Therefore, we must imagine the enchantment is not merely aesthetic but structural as well.
