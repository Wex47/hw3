   Little is known about Dean's relationship with his family.
   His biological father
   was a wizard who walked out on his Muggle wife and infant son in order to protect them from the Death Eaters. He never told his wife that he was a wizard, and was soon after killed by the Death Eaters when he refused to join their cause.
   Dean's mother
   married again
   a Muggle
   , who raised Dean as if he was his own son. Dean also had several
   half-siblings

   Ginny clearly got over Dean soon after they broke up, as she began dating Harry soon after and admitted to him that she had never really given up on Harry. Dean, however, seemed astonished and hurt when he saw Harry and Ginny kissing, and went as far as smashing his glass, indicating that he took their split harder.
   Later, while Dean was on the run and heard news about Ginny, Harry noted that Dean was concerned for her welfare.
