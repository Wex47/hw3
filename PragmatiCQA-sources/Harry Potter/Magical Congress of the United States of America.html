   In MACUSA’s early years, its primary aim was to rid the continent of

   The Magical Congress of the United States of America was established in
   1693
   with the introduction of the
   International Statute of Secrecy
   , as a direct result of the
   Salem Witch Trials
   . Thus this means that MACUSA pre-dates the
   No-Maj
   formation of the United States of America by around a century.
   One of the representatives was
   Josiah Jackson
   , who became the first President of MACUSA. Josiah was thought to be strong enough to deal with the troubles caused by the Salem Witch Trials.
  </p>
  <p key="ab157a08-9720-4c37-839b-f8db9e6baaf0">
   The first task of the North American wizarding legislature was to put on trial the
   Scourers
   , a unscrupulous and brutal band of wizarding bounty hunters and racketeers, executing those convicted of murder, wizard-trafficking, and torture.
   Josiah Jackson's main priority when he became President was to create and train
   Aurors
   . There were only a select few to start with, with only two of them surviving to old age. They won the enduring respect of the magical community in North America, which was extended to their descendants.
  </p>
  <p key="6e55d5f3-5b8d-4949-9085-b206598ea4b8">
   MACUSA has had to move its location at least five times since its inception. Originally, MACUSA had no definite meeting place and moved around so it would not be detected by No-Majs.
  </p>
  <p key="6c9ed5fb-d7c7-4128-a300-06e570f44ca7">
   Due to the fact that America had a very hostile relationship between magical and non magical people, there was no cooperation between MACUSA and the No-Maj government.
  </p>
  <p key="c00a5a31-3f09-4678-9730-c7399a04ddc7">
   Eventually, MACUSA created an enchanted edifice in the
   Appalachian Mountains
   as their headquarters. However, they had to relocate as it was in an inconvenient location.
  </p>
  <p key="5146cd63-bd59-4c18-89c4-b476b5026af5">
   In
   1760
   , MACUSA relocated to
   Williamsburg
   in
   Virginia
   where then President
   Thornton Harkaway
   lived. Harkaway bred
   Crups
   , which possessed a great aggression towards non-magical people. When the Crups attacked local No-Majs, it led to a great breach of the
   Statute of Secrecy
   , and Harkaway had to step down in disgrace.
  </p>
  <p key="d01ba432-4e9f-4914-8000-04742f9c0c8d">
   MACUSA then relocated to
   Baltimore
   , where President
   Able Fleming
   lived. However, when the
   Revolutionary War
   began, MACUSA decided to move to what would become
   Washington
   , decades before the No-Maj Congress even built the city.

  <p key="b2098f30-5d2f-43d3-8d7c-a467506e1d53">
   In
   1777
   , then President
   Elizabeth McGilliguddy
   presided over the infamous
   Country or Kind? debate
   . It was an extraordinary meeting which led to the expansion of the
   Great Meeting Chamber
   . They discussed whether to support their community or their country and whether to fight for liberation from the British Muggles. They also debated whether it was really their fight. The argument did not go well and it led to a fight. Pro-interventionists argued that by intervening, they could save lives, while anti-interventionists believed that they would reveal their community by intervening and place it in danger. They sought the advice of the
   British Ministry of Magic
   to find out whether they intended to intervene on their side, and they replied with only a four word letter —
   <i key="d4b2a657-5737-40da-a4d5-769541400ea6">
    "Sitting this one out"
   </i>
   . McGilliguddy replied with an even shorter message stating
   <i key="b93785e1-15a9-4b2d-a69b-02bcf8cd09b8">
    "Mind you do"
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p key="55dddbed-ab9c-4790-8a04-342d2d402c0f">
   Ultimately, they did not intervene, but they did attempt to protect their No-Maj neighbours unofficially, and celebrated Independence Day.
  </p>
  <p key="4d943d15-6663-4164-832a-f8e2f45772a9">
   Due to the indiscretions of the dim-witted witch
   Dorcus Twelvetrees
   , the then President
   Emily Rappaport
   created
   Rappaport's Law
   , which would enforce strict segregation between the No-Maj and wizarding communities. Henceforth, wizards were no longer allowed to befriend or marry No-Majs, and penalties of such fraternisation were harsh. Communication was also limited to only if necessary to perform daily activities. During this time, MACUSA worked strictly independently of the No-Maj government to decrease the possibility of exposure.
  </p>
  <p key="f7f3cafc-621d-403f-813c-9bf176c484aa">
   Under
   Rappaport's Law
   , MACUSA continued to avoid communication with the No-Maj community for many years, and MACUSA also continued to impose severe penalties on those who disobeyed the International Statute of Secrecy.

  <p key="1d68726e-b3ed-4514-af43-99aac98e907d">
   After the
   Great Sasquatch Rebellion of 1892
   , MACUSA was forced to relocate its headquarters for the fifth time in its history, and moved from Washington to
   New York City
   at the
   Woolworth Building
   , where it remained throughout the
   1920s
   . The rebellion was blamed on
   Irene Kneedander
   , Head of the
   Body for the Protection of Magical Species
   , as Kneedander had taken to attacking a Sasquatch that had done something wrong, which led to their decision to rebel. It had led to great
   Obliviations
   in Washington.

   They needed a new headquarters, and over the course of several years, wizards infiltrated the construction team of a new building in New York. By the time the
   Woolworth Building
   was completed, it could both house No-Majs and — if activated by the correct spells — transform into a space for wizards. The only outer mark of their new secret location was the owl carved over the entrance.

   Sometime at the end of the 19th century, legislation was introduced which would require all American wizards and witches to have a
   permit
   allowing them to carry a wand. This was a measure that was intended to keep tabs on all magical activity and identify the perpetrators by their wands, thus making the concealment of magic easier. Rappaport’s Law was still in operation in the 1920s and several offices in MACUSA had no counterpart in the
   Ministry of Magic
   .

   Unlike the
   No-Maj
   community, which had a strict
   Prohibition
   law against alcohol for many years, MACUSA allowed the wizarding community to consume alcohol, though many criticised this policy, pointing out that it made witches and wizards rather conspicuous around sober No-Majs. However, the then President
   Seraphina Picquery
   stated that being a wizard or witch in America was already hard enough. At one point she famously told her
   Chief of Staff
   that the "
   Gigglewater
   was non-negotiable."

   A significant difference between the wizarding governments of the United States and the UK of this time was the penalty for a serious crime. British witches and wizards were sent to
   Azkaban
   , whereas the worst criminals in America were executed. The penalty for escaping Azkaban, however, was the

   Magical Exposure Threat Level Measurer
   , sent a delegation to MACUSA Headquarters to hold an emergency meeting. It was at this meeting that Newt Scamander, Tina Goldstein, and Jacob Kowalski were falsely believed to have been responsible for the Senator's death and were arrested. Grindelwald, in his assumed capacity as Director of Magical Security, sought to have them executed after Scamander and Tina discovered a hint over his true identity. Scamander, Goldstein, and Kowalski ultimately escaped MACUSA, becoming fugitives.

   After Scamander, Tina,

    , MACUSA is incorrectly identified in an
    establishing shot
    as the "American Ministry of Magic". One possible explanation is that it was so called in the subtitles at the beginning of the film for the sake of simplicity and the benefit of the audience. Later on in the same film,
    Yusuf Kama
    refers to the "European and American Ministries", which, again, seems to have been done out of simplicity or could be bolted down to the character's ignorance about the structure of the American wizarding government.
   </li>
   <li key="383c8fc1-cd79-4c51-a525-73e2e65c07cf">
    The MACUSA's emblem greatly resembles the obverse side of the real-world
    Great Seal of the United States
    , albeit with many differences:
    <ul key="98331f0a-a105-4566-8556-70e2d3f1addb">
     <li key="06936a41-58e3-41da-86fc-b575bd4966ee">
      Only the bald eagle proper, the stars, and the escutcheon remain; the other elements from the No-Maj counterpart (the crest, the talons, the thirteen-leaved olive branch, the thirteen arrows, and the scroll with motto) are absent.
     </li>
     <li key="33f3667f-d222-462a-b1f3-a0221ba4fff9">
      In contrast to its No-Maj counterpart, the bald eagle dominates the entire emblem as a blue silhouette (with variations in shading), and its head and beak faces towards the viewer's right (the No-Maj counterpart faces towards the viewer's left).
     </li>
     <li key="38aa9205-fcb4-4022-bf6d-0a138221ac14">
      Beneath the bald eagle's outstretched wings are three tongues of flame on each side, perhaps symbolising the
      Salem Witch Trials
      ; the MACUSA was established as a direct result of the aftermath, and is therefore used as a tool in rationale for its foundation and legitimisation.
     </li>
     <li key="3c985c8f-45dc-4711-94ff-f2f0fa138fbe">
      The escutcheon (in the eagle's breast, which seems to blend in with the eagle) is much larger than its No-Maj counterpart (perhaps in proportion to the size of the bald eagle), with its bottom reaching halfway to the border. Its chief (like its No-Maj counterpart) is also blue (therefore violating the heraldic rule of tincture of "no colour on colour" since the eagle's breast is also blue of the "azure" shade), but unlike its No-Maj counterpart, contains thirty white stars (in five irregular rows). The colouring of its paleways (the stripes; also thirteen pieces) are in reverse of its No-Maj counterpart (outermost sides in white), resembling the vertical display of the
      flag of the United States
      .
     </li>
     <li key="0b54ae07-4241-4080-b28f-d7b26ab92b60">
      The bald eagle's head has twenty-nine radiating lines up to its wings in the background, termed in heraldry as "glory". But unlike its No-Maj counterpart (above the eagle's head is a crest of thirteen white stars arranged in a six-pointed star pattern, on a blue field within a yellow glory breaking through a cloud proper), the "glory" ends up to the borders of the eagle's outstretched wings, and within the space are eighteen randomly positioned stars (which is similar to the early committee designs for the No-Majs' counterpart seal, described as a "constellation"; it was in 1782 when the first die was made that the six-pointed star pattern, after English heraldry, was adopted for the No-Maj seal).
     </li>
     <li key="3461206a-4505-40d7-865e-2440def80eb2">
      The emblem contains altogether forty-eight stars, symbolising the number of states of America by the 1920s (the 48th state, Arizona, was admitted in 1912, and Alaska and Hawaii both were in 1959). Most likely, in this regard, the MACUSA emblem mimicks the real-world
      Seal of the President of the United States
      (which uses a variation of the obverse of the Great Seal), since the number of stars in it conforms to the current states admitted to the Union.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="b71ee185-ae47-4da7-89d1-9bcd6657939f">
    Although it is never mentioned, it seems probable that the MACUSA has a judicial branch to adjudicate on violations of wizarding law, and an organisation like the
    <a href="Wizengamot.html" key="d13087f2-6ac0-453c-b18b-982407a69189" title="Wizengamot">
     Wizengamot
    </a>
    which is akin to the Supreme Court used by the No-Maj.
   </li>
   <li key="52745b34-b9e1-465f-9030-feadf749dc43">
    It's possible that each state in the US has its own state wizarding government, emulating the No-Maj Federal set-up, especially given how many departments of the MACUSA have the word "federal" in them, implying a federalised structure of government.
   </li>
   <li key="25c0a660-888f-491d-a089-6405e28d830e">
    It is possible that wizarding newspaper
    <i key="7f1d3a64-8b47-49d2-bbfe-3f0a4fa135b2">

   </li>
   <li key="81946c43-cc6e-4aaf-b151-26b184cf5790">
    The worst criminals apprehended by MACUSA are executed rather than incarcerated. This is a reflection of how the United States still utilise the death penalty for many of their most dangerous offenders who don't get granted clemency via the defence of criminal actions being due to insanity. The State Government of Texas has sentenced to death and executed over 430 individuals to date, the largest number of any other State in the nation.
