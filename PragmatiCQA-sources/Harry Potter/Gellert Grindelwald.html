   Gellert Grindelwald was born around
   1882
   or
   1883
   ,
   and was educated at
   Durmstrang Institute
   during his formative years, where he excelled in various fields of magic and absorbed much of the school's strength-obsessed,
   Dark Magic
   -oriented culture. He was an extremely talented wizard who possessed an attractive and winsome personality, which was coupled with a "merry, wild" disposition.
  </p>
  <p key="8a90d25c-87f4-41c2-bbd4-630631ce8cd3">
   At some point in his youth, Grindelwald, who was a natural born
   Seer
   , had a
   vision
   where he saw himself rise to dominance over the

   ,
   and when he learned of the fabled

    Deathly Hallows
   </a>
   ; three fabled objects which, if united, would make the possessor the
   Master of Death
   , he quickly came to see the
   Quest
   as instrumental to fulfil the aforementioned prediction. Over the course of his school career, Grindelwald grew increasingly obsessed with learning whatever he could about the three items in question, to the point of appropriating the
   runic
   symbol that represented them as his own
   personal emblem
   ; and even engraved it on the walls of
   Durmstrang
   prior to his departure. These engravings persisted for many generations, and

This was an ominous and troubling sign, as it meant that Grindelwald performed experiments that were too disturbing even for a school with a notably high tolerance of the
   Dark Arts

   in the summer of
   1899
   that Grindelwald met and befriended Albus Dumbledore.
   The two teenagers had a lot in common: they were intellectuals and talented young wizards, who were also idealistic and ambitious. The pair even became lovers during the two months that they knew one another.
   Following these “two months of insanity,” as Dumbledore would later recall them to be, the two teens shaped one another's ideas, powers, as well as destinies from that day forth and became intertwined with each other. Whilst they were staying at Bathilda Bagshot's house, they also made a
   blood pact
   , swearing never to fight each other.
  </p>
  <p key="6cfc16e4-ba82-4d22-8459-097a249cd274">
   The pair shared two preoccupations: The first was their search for the Deathly Hallows toward the goal of acquiring all three and wielding their power to become a
   Master of Death
   , which they believed to mean immortality and invincibility. They also dreamed of overturning the
   International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy
   and creating a new order in which wise and powerful wizards and witches were the benevolent overlords of their world, including
   <a href="Non-magic people.html" key="0cdc6bd2-1f29-46f1-b1be-957f8fa4e601" title="Non-magic people">
    Muggles
   </a>
   . Dumbledore coined the phrase "For the Greater Good" that would be used to justify the necessary use of force required to achieve their goals, and Grindelwald would later adopt as his motto.
  </p>
  <p key="1ed1b5df-980c-425d-89c5-7b0fe0cc3d1d">
   However, Dumbledore's motivations and intentions were different from Grindelwald's: as a young man, he had been powerless to stop a group of Muggle boys tormenting his younger sister,
   Ariana
   , to the point that the sweet-natured girl suffered an emotional breakdown and her repressed magic became dangerously unstable.

    Dumbledore's father
   </a>
   was sent to
   Azkaban
   for taking revenge on the boys and his mother was killed in one of Ariana's accidents. Dumbledore wanted the power to protect his loved ones (and by extension the whole world) against cruelty and xenophobia like that shown by the Muggles. He viewed the
   Resurrection Stone
   as a way of returning his parents to life and relieving him of his new familial obligations, while Grindelwald mistakenly viewed it as a tool to amass an army of

   Their plans to leave Godric's Hollow, acquire power, and begin their revolution turned serious. When Dumbledore's brother

    Aberforth

   became aware of this, he was both concerned about and disgusted with Albus's ambition, knowing that he and Ariana would need to be brought along as she would not receive the care and attention she needed to keep her stable. The tense situation boiled over into a confrontation and Grindelwald, enraged, inflicted the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on Aberforth. Albus moved to defend his brother, igniting a vicious three-way
   duel
   in which Ariana was killed. Grindelwald fled the country and received putative blame for Ariana's death, thus confirming his place on the wrong side of the law and touching off his career as a Dark revolutionary, which would last until
   1945

   . Rumours had been circulating that the renowned
   Wandmaker
   Mykew Gregorovitch

   stunned
   him, and stole the wand, thereby becoming its new master. Grindelwald's research may have uncovered this unconventional path to ownership of the wand as the common interpretation was that ownership passed only by murder.

   As Grindelwald's power grew, he began to make plans for the confrontation he knew would happen one day; a confrontation with his old friend and the only wizard in the world believed to be powerful enough to defeat him: Albus Dumbledore. Unknown to the rest of the wizarding community, neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald could fight each other directly, which was the result of the
   blood pact
   they had
   formed
   in their youth. However, Grindelwald knew that Dumbledore was powerful enough to compromise his plans without fighting him directly, a threat he made clear to all his followers. Seeking a means to defeat Dumbledore without having to fight him personally, Grindelwald saw visions in which an
   Obscurial
   "killed the man he feared above all others"
   which was his former lover. Knowing that an

   of such destructive capability could be the only being apart from himself possibly powerful enough to kill Dumbledore, Grindelwald left Europe for America to find and recruit the child to his cause.

   Grindelwald's disappearance was noted by many newspapers around the wizarding world, who were concerned at the absence of news about the Dark wizard.

   of
   1926
   , unbeknownst to Picquery, Grindelwald had already infiltrated MACUSA by assuming the identity of her right-hand man
   Percival Graves
   using
   human transfiguration,
   whom Grindelwald managed to subdue. Grindelwald believed mysterious attacks occurring in
   New York City
   to be the work of a powerful Obscurial, which he felt would be a great asset for his plans of world domination. Using his disguise as Graves, Grindelwald came into regular contact with
   Credence Barebone
   , believing him to be connected to the Obscurial due to a vision he received. Thinking Credence was an orphaned
   Squib
   , Grindelwald emotionally manipulated him into helping him find the Obscurial with the promise of protecting him from his abusive adoptive mother and teaching him magic.
  </p>
  <p key="73933bb2-21b0-4300-adb1-ab1239672c3f">
   During this time, Grindelwald (as Graves) arrested
   Newt Scamander
   , whose escaped beasts were believed by MACUSA to be the cause of the Obscurial's attacks. During his interrogation, Grindelwald discovered the Obscurus within
   Newt's suitcase
   , and in an effort to hide his tracks, had him and
   Tina Goldstein
   sentenced to death. He then approached Credence after
   Mary Lou Barebone
   was killed by the Obscurial and had him track down his adoptive sister
   Modesty
   , believing her to be the source of the Obscurus. Once they found Modesty, Grindelwald cruelly rejected Credence, as he had no further use of him. This angered Credence, who then revealed that he was the Obscurial, much to Grindelwald's surprise, as no Obscurial had survived to more than 10 years old, more than 15 years younger than Credence's age.
  </p>
  <p key="7d496b96-6bad-406d-b616-6298702a2c35">
   Grindelwald wanted to use him to expose the
   North American
   wizarding community, and create a weapon against Dumbledore. He attempted to convince Credence that he had nothing to fear anymore and to join his ranks, but this further angered Credence, who began rampaging through the city. Grindelwald was not easily deterred, however, and continued to try to recruit Credence, clashing with Tina and later Newt, both of whom he easily overpowered. When Grindelwald, Newt, and Tina were finally close to calming down Credence, Picquery and her
   Aurors
   appeared on the scene and immediately attacked the Obscurus.
  </p>
  <p key="d5e28a30-df8b-42ba-8371-0d27de0c27ef">
   With Credence being seemingly destroyed at the Aurors' hands, Grindelwald was so beside himself with rage that he, led by his extreme idealism, began to break his disguise while expressing his utter disgust for being forced to hide from the Muggles. Picquery subsequently ordered the other Aurors to bring "Graves" in, but Grindelwald, no longer suppressing his tremendous magical prowess, started to overwhelm them despite being outnumbered at least twenty to one. However, Newt finally managed to catch him off-guard with his
   Swooping Evil
   and restrained Grindelwald's hands from behind, while Tina used a
   Summoning Charm
   to take
   Graves' wand

  <p key="3f173206-decd-4fc6-8dcc-2e1a9f69eedd">
   Newt then cast the
   Revelio Charm
   , making Grindelwald's disguise fade away while revealing his identity. Even apprehended, Grindelwald was unfazed, arrogantly questioning Picquery's ability to contain a wizard of his reputation and power. As he was led away, Grindelwald met Newt's gaze and mysteriously asked him: "Will we die, just a little?"

   Abernathy
   , a MACUSA employee, was already one of
   Grindelwald's acolytes
   . A few moments before escorting the dark wizard, Abernathy went to Grindelwald's cell and they both assumed each other's identities, possibly via

   One evening, Grindelwald
   called
   a meeting for his followers in the
   Lestrange Mausoleum
   . There, he gave a rousing speech, in which he shared his idealist perspective of Muggles, as well as his vision of the future, which he warns of another great and terrible war, with images of the London Blitz and Hiroshima punctuating his rhetoric. Grindelwald, openly recognising the battalion of Aurors that had infiltrated the rally, told his followers to remain calm as he revealed their presence and invited them into the circle and he described how the Aurors have fought him so mercilessly, killing his followers simply for believing. When a
   young witch
   , who had been motivated by Grindelwald's speech to lash out, went for her wand, the Auror killed her in response, much to the rage of Grindelwald and the rest of the attendees. Grindelwald knelt to the girl's dead body and martyred her, asking the brave young witch to be taken back to her family. While kneeling, in Grindelwald's ignorance, Newt's Niffler, having escaped its owner's suitcase, lurked near him and stole from him a vial of blood pact protecting him from Dumbledore. After getting up from the body he commanded his followers to Disapparate from the scene while he faced off against the Aurors.

   When
   Theseus Scamander
   set his men on Grindelwald, he responded by conjuring a
   circle of protective fire around himself
   , and added an enchantment designed to test the loyalty of his followers: those who entered with complete fidelity and believed in his cause would survive; those who did not, would be engulfed and perish. Abernathy,
   Vinda Rosier
   , Credence, and Queenie joined Grindelwald into the circle and apparated to safety, while many of the Aurors died either fleeing or fighting when Grindelwald manipulated the fire to work as a weapon as well, sending balls and bursts of black fire towards his enemies, thereby killing them. Ultimately, about half a dozen of the fifty Aurors Theseus had brought along accepted his offer and joined him in the circle as well.

   skull hookah
   . Leta was then engulfed by the flames, killing her, before telling the others to evacuate. Grindelwald let out his fury over losing such a valuable tool by unleashing the dark fire, allowing the flames to assume the form of giant bestial entities (similar to
   Fiendfyre

During these six years of utter chaos, Dumbledore hesitated to confront Grindelwald, despite the belief held by many, including quite possibly both men themselves, that he was the only wizard skilful enough to stop his former friend. The reason Dumbledore was so afraid was because Grindelwald knew better than he did who exactly was responsible for killing Ariana and he didn't want to find out.

   that Grindelwald had given his life to prevent Voldemort from desecrating Dumbledore's tomb, perhaps indicating that despite all that happened, Grindelwald still retained some care and respect for his old friend. Dumbledore's acknowledgement of Grindelwald's attempt to achieve redemption also indicated he believed Grindelwald was capable of changing out of some possible remaining affection for him. In the end, Grindelwald's prediction of Voldemort never fully mastering the Elder Wand would become reality, and would cause Voldemort's own demise during his final duel with Harry Potter. Although unknown, it is highly likely that after Voldemort's final defeat and the end of the Second Wizarding War, Grindelwald's assassination was exposed to the wizarding world. It is unknown what became of his body or whether it received a proper burial or was simply disposed of.

   himself confessed that Grindelwald was extremely charming, so much so that it had induced the former to fall in love with him, and it was partly the reason Dumbledore had been initially blind to just how dangerous Grindelwald truly was. His attraction to the
   Dark Arts
   was not necessarily malevolent in its initial stages,
   but was more of a personal interest that swelled over time in Durmstrang, a school that was rather notorious for its acceptance and study of the

   challenged his and Albus's plans and tried to convince his brother to abandon them, Grindelwald "lost control" and used the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on Aberforth, showing his willingness to cause pain to people who challenged him.
   Grindelwald resorted to physically striking Credence Barebone when he grew impatient with the boy, briefly shedding the soft and comforting facade that he adopted earlier. Later on, when Grindelwald duelled
   Newt Scamander
   , he swiftly overpowered his opponent but in his rage of Newt's interference, he fiercely unleashed bolts of lightning upon the Magizoologist in order to first incapacitate him in a painful manner. After his
   skull-hookah
   was destroyed, Grindelwald's rage prompted him to try to destroy all of Paris. He also showed a sadistic streak, as during his battle against the Aurors in Paris, Grindelwald called after them "

He was also not above killing Muggle infants, although he seemingly didn't like to do it, such as after arriving in Paris, Grindelwald heard the cries of a Muggle toddler, and after a brief moment of consideration, walked out of the room and left him to be murdered by
   one of
   his acolytes.

   For the Greater Good
   , he tirelessly endeavoured to fulfil this
   vision
   .
   Clever and composed, has well as an extremely persuasive orator, Grindelwald had a phenomenal command of the art of public speaking, allowing him to mystify and terrify his audiences, allies and enemies alike; inspiring fanatical loyalty with each word, and gaining
   widespread following
   for his cause, followers whom he affectionately referred to as his as "brothers and sisters" and "friends". When appearing in front of an audience at a rally, Grindelwald was treated as a revered celebrity, as was expected of someone with his charisma.

   He did recognise, however, that while a brilliant wizard, he was not infallible, and thus Grindelwald openly confided in a carefully selected group of
   Acolytes
   that constituted the innermost circle of the army of Dark witches and wizards that he marshalled to his side. Additionally, while escaping his
   Incarceration Carriage
   and killing all of the accompanying
   Aurors
   , Grindelwald went out of his way to let
   Rudolph Spielman
   live, seemingly in order for the frightened
   Head of Incarceration
   to tell the

   how great of a threat he truly was. Grindelwald could also work very independently when he had to, however, such as when he seemingly single-handedly infiltrated the

   , and was able to mimic the personality of
   Percival Graves
   for an extended period time without arousing suspicion — even when having his followers denounced as fanatics by Newton Scamander, Grindelwald was mostly unfazed and only chuckled the only time he truly aroused anyone's suspicion was when he interrogated
   Newt Scamander
   and labelled the hostless
   <a href="Obscurus.html" key="8131234c-f5b4-4aca-8fef-f4eed4718bc7" title="Obscurus">
    Obscurus
   </a>
   as "useless", which roused Newt to angry disbelief, and appeared to baffle former Auror Tina Goldstein. Thus, Grindelwald either momentarily lapsed in his façade at this point, or incorporated his own ruthlessness and calculative nature into that of Percival Graves. Still, Grindelwald was quick enough to quell their realisation by sentencing them both to death, before the conversation could go any further.

   Grindelwald showed himself to be immensely charismatic — he effortlessly exploited
   Credence Barebone
   by appealing to the boy in a way nobody else tried to and offering to accept the boy into his ranks. Even after it became clear that Credence, as an
   Obscurial
   , was extremely powerful and phenomenally dangerous, Grindelwald calmly continued to try and exploit him, and was outraged when the
   <a href="Magical Congress of the United States of America.html" key="3c974c2e-2212-4591-9d82-693773c81564" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">

   Aurors
   seemingly destroy him. Grindelwald was idealistic to an extreme,
   having absolutely no complaints about the murder of hundreds of innocent people as long as that accomplished his long-term goals. Indeed, Grindelwald's idealism even prompted him to truly break his disguise in New York, expressing his disgust for being forced to hide from Muggles, and then proceeding to attack the

   Aurors who had seemingly killed Credence. Even then, however, his anger was not expressed on his own behalf, but rather on that of the cause he was fighting for, which more or less spurred his life and deeds. Grindelwald spoke scornfully towards
   President Picquery
   when she insisted the Obscurial's destruction was on her orders, mocking the fact that history would note this, and that it wasn't right. Grindelwald noticeably paused before engaging the Aurors, indicating that he couldn't see any other way out of it. Throughout all of this, Grindelwald maintained a stern pride in his own skill: even as he was unexpectedly apprehended by the Aurors after Newt Scamander had attacked and subdued him from behind, Grindelwald was unfazed, and simply questioned President Picquery's ability to contain a wizard of his reputation and power. He did not even blink when faced with the President, fixing her with a fierce stare until she was out of his sight, showing his unwillingness to show fear to his enemies.

   Obscurial
   Credence Barebone
   , for instance, but was dismissive of the less talented and intelligent Aberforth, the permanently damaged
   Ariana
   , and also, initially, Credence, whom Grindelwald initially callously discarded when he seemingly became no longer useful, mistakenly believing Credence to be a
   Squib
   , whom it would be impossible to magically train. In addition, while disguised as
   Percival Graves
   , Grindelwald questioned
   Newt Scamander
   , who he seemingly found to be an average wizard, in an interrogation as to why Dumbledore would have such faith in Newt, indicating an interest in further understanding both Dumbledore and Newt's abilities. Grindelwald's dismissal of Credence as a Squib suggested that Grindelwald, in his (somewhat arrogant) awareness of his own brilliance, was so secure in his own
   Seer
   judgement as to having grown a weakness for jumping to conclusions. Grindelwald was also criticised by Newt for deeming magical creatures too simple to raise his interest, being only turned towards more complex forms of magic, unaware that one such creature, a
   Niffler
   , actually stole his
   Blood pact
   vial.

  <p key="e6951888-0fd0-42de-916e-9e8cd98662e2">
   However, Grindelwald was ultimately not a complete amoral man, as shown by how he was capable of feeling remorse for past wrongdoings and the fact that his lengths he was willing to go to reach his goals were fuelled by ambition and a fanatical sense of self-purpose, rather than evil intent. Grindelwald's decision to stun, not kill
   Gregorovitch
   , when he acquired the
   Elder Wand
   from the latter, and also not bother finishing off
   Porpentina Goldstein
   even though he could have easily done so, hints at a willingness not to kill simply as a matter of course. However, this might have been a calculated decision, perhaps considering that people were more likely to give credence to Gregorovitch's claims that he'd had the Elder Wand if he was murdered, as that was the traditional method of passing it on,
   while his sparing of Tina was likely because Grindelwald didn't view her worth the time he could instead have used to try to persuade Credence. After all, Grindelwald killed his own pet
   Chupacabra
   Antonio
   after deeming him "too needy", he killed numerous
   Aurors
   while escaping the MACUSA, he ruthlessly killed many people who did not display enough loyalty to him to enter his
   circle of blue fire
   (disintegrating his own inadequately loyal Acolyte
   Krall
   , although while he did not spare Krall, he sombrely closed his eyes, indicating some regret and remorse, at seeing Krall painfully die as he tried to reach out to him as he reached out to Grindelwald, in addition to also offering the Aurors who attacked him a chance to join his army rather than just simply immediately massacring all of them and when Leta Lestrange asked him to stop, Grindelwald seemed rather willing to spare Newt and Theseus had Leta joined him, having stopped his attempts to burn them alive and only having the black flames thwart them instead of killing them), and Grindelwald even had no objections to
   Vinda Rosier
   and
   Carrow
   murdering a
   family

  <p key="7fcb2e09-a9c6-44bd-a9e9-fc39d54256d3">
   Nonetheless, Grindelwald's ideology was considerably less extreme than that of Voldemort - while he considered his own wizarding kind superior, Grindelwald's intended new world order only seemed to oppose tyrannical and hateful non-magical individuals, such as the No-Maj
   Second Salemers
   , and the Muggle executors of the future atrocities of the
   Second World War
   . Whereas Voldemort genuinely desired the destruction of all non-magic individuals, Grindelwald only ever wanted to subjugate them, believing that the beast of burden would always be necessary to cement wizardkind's superiority and so some non-magicals would have to be spared, viewing himself and his attendants should be far from merciless that way. He was disheartened to hear that people thought he hated Muggles, and personally corrected this misconception in front of a very public audience clarifying to them that his deviant motives were not driven by hatred towards lesser beings, whom he considers inferior but in no way without worth to those higher, inferring that he may even pity them for their inferiority by virtue of their lack of magical aptitude.

   , was how that while Voldemort was completely without empathy and unable to feel remorse, Grindelwald seemed to genuinely pity Credence for the greatly unjust treatment he was exposed to not only by his own mother, but also by the magical community, as displayed by his rage of Credence being destroyed by MACUSA. He later expressed sympathy for how
   Mary Lou Barebone
   had nearly destroyed her own adopted son. After many years of imprisonment in
   <a href="Nurmengard Castle.html" key="1a3a9418-e16c-42e0-8b23-848fe9e4e7c0" title="Nurmengard Castle">

   </a>
   , as he sat alone in his former fortress, Grindelwald was reportedly known for having contemplated his past misdeeds and felt remorse and shame for the horrifying things he had committed during his attempted rise to power over the magical and non-magical worlds. This clearly influenced his decision to hide the location of the Elder Wand from Voldemort, despite being confronted and certainly about to die at the hands of the only Dark Wizard more powerful and dangerous than himself, which Dumbledore acknowledged to be out of a desire to achieve a shred of redemption. This remorse and redemption is in stark contrast to Voldemort, who showed not an ounce of remorse for the countless atrocities he committed.
  </p>
  <p key="3448220b-3072-46fb-816f-a60f5c0e40d7">
   Grindelwald was also proven to be capable of fear, judging from the fact that he fled in fear of his life after the intense duel between himself, Dumbledore, and Aberforth that resulted in Ariana's death, and how he resorted to being more cautious around Credence upon realising that
   <i key="fcba8619-4609-4312-b4d0-81f2093f82d4">
    he
   </i>
   was the Obscurial (in the knowledge of how dangerous and volatile Obscurials were). He never attempted to extend his power to Britain for fear of facing Dumbledore (most likely due to the circumstances of their last encounter, and the fact that he recognised how powerful Dumbledore was), but notably also due to their
   Blood pact
   making Grindelwald unable to directly confront Dumbledore. Not only does this suggest that Grindelwald was actually capable of contemplating Dumbledore being equivalently powerful or dangerous as himself, but that he was also capable of respecting Dumbledore. It would seem that despite Dumbledore being the cause of his downfall, Grindelwald still genuinely considered Dumbledore his friend in the end to an extent, as Harry Potter noted Grindelwald had also intended to prevent Dumbledore's tomb from being desecrated when he lied on the Elder Wand. It should also be noted that despite his claims of wanting to unleash Credence upon Dumbledore, Grindelwald was never known to attack Britain even after he had Credence, as Britain was always acknowledged as the only place safe from Grindelwald, which seemed to imply Grindelwald, even at his worst, did not want Albus dead unless he had interfered in his plans.

   sought
   ", saying there is so much he "doesn't understand". Indeed, he seemed to exhibit a grotesque remnant of the "merry, wild" temperament of his youth. Grindelwald's last words consisted of the dressing-down of Voldemort, and a rather enthusiastic outlook on
   "the next great adventure"
   , all of which seems clear in its connection to his old flame, Albus Dumbledore.

    , much of the international wizarding communities had come to concur with him, pleading for Dumbledore to take action. At the time, the evolutionary leader in question had successfully
    terrorised
    much of the wizarding world and had a huge number of
    followers
    at his command. Indeed, Dumbledore himself recalled that the height of Grindelwald's power was such that it would have been "
    <i key="e7568cf8-5c84-4e7c-94c7-e3b9fc099dd5">
     too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable
    </i>
    ", which ultimately prompted Professor Dumbledore to finally put aside his personal feelings and fears, and to finally seek out his old friend and to put an end to his reign of terror once and for all. Grindelwald was ultimately defeated by Albus, though it must be noted that according to contemporary accounts, their displays of power and skill was of a standard that few had ever seen before in the history of wizardkind, and their
    famous duel
    in
    1945
    went down in history as one of the greatest duels ever fought between two wizards.

    a generation later. Even as a student, Grindelwald's talents were already great enough that, coupled with his passion for the Dark Arts, his exploration and practice of such magic were already very dangerous, even nearly fatal to the fellow Durmstrang students, and eventually, his "twisted experiments" became too dangerous for even Dumstrang's tolerant outlook on the Dark Arts, resulting in his expulsion.
    ​​ While seventeen, Grindelwald was already adept at casting the extremely powerful
    Cruciatus Curse
    , notably using it against

    While impersonating Percival Graves and duelling

    unknown dark spell that unleashed fissures of force

    another that emitted a bolt of lightning to torture him

    of
    1927
    , Grindelwald
    conjured an incredibly powerful protective ring of dark fire

He also nearly killing Newt and Theseus with a concentrated burst of the flames, as well greatly spread it around upon being angered by Leta's destruction of his Skull-Hookah, with said flames serving as a magical protection of sorts, easily repelling Theseus's attempts to stop Grindelwald from killing his fiancée. Grindelwald was even able to shape it into a huge winged fiery demon of such potency that it was capable of potentially destroying all of

     Intellectual genius
    </b>
    : Grindelwald was not only a great wizard, but also possessed a tremendous level of intellect, considered by most to be just as brilliant as
    <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="7eba2864-ed4e-44d1-9ad7-7519370c69bf" title="Albus Dumbledore">
     Albus Dumbledore
    </a>
    . Indeed, Grindelwald and Dumbledore's intellects were so complementary to one another that according to
    Bathilda Bagshot
    , even after spending an entire day in intellectually stimulating discussions with Grindelwald, Dumbledore would still unexpectedly send Grindelwald messages by owl right after sudden ideas struck him, with him having to let Grindelwald know of them immediately.
    ​​ As an adult, Grindelwald became an exceptional strategist and tactician, whose expertise was perhaps best shown by his ability to start a massive
    revolution
    on his own, gathering a large amount of
    followers
    to establish a new wizarding world order, and strategically overwhelming much of the

     For the Greater Good
    </i>
    revolution. For instance, Grindelwald was highly adept at taking advantage of the discontent of those members of the wizarding world that harboured anti-Muggle sentiments: In fact, when European
    Aurors
    began to target and kill his followers, and
    Torquil Travers
    employed the
    same policy
    of suppression and violence against Grindelwald as
    <a href="Bartemius Crouch Senior.html" key="cf8e23cc-fa7f-4344-8e5f-56b0726543ea" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">
     Bartemius Crouch
    </a>
    would later use against
    Lord Voldemort
    and his
    Death Eaters
    decades later, rather than yielding measurable results like Crouch did, their efforts instead backfired in spectacular fashion, as Grindelwald was able to frame the narrative of his rise to power in such a way that said tactics only served to further stoke a hatred against
    Aurors
    and sow further division between his followers and the opposition, both to garner sympathy for his cause and to turn the steadily growing
    Alliance
    against the established order of things. Other examples of Grindelwald's uncanny ability to create complex and carefully-woven plans to achieve his goals was shown, among others, when he managed to think his way out of his
    blood pact
    with Dumbledore by formulating a master plan to investigate the Obscurial attack on
    New York
    unhindered, with the intent of using the
    Obscurial
    in question as a lethal weapon again his former friend. This he accomplished when he removed
    President
    Picquery
    's right-hand man,
    Percival Graves
    , from the playing field, and infiltrated the
    <a href="Magical Congress of the United States of America.html" key="485b4894-5f2a-4ecc-8ec8-3e76b1d66423" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">
     MACUSA
    </a>
    by assuming his identity. Grindelwald also proved to be a consummate actor, multitasker and investigator, as during his time disguised as Graves, Grindelwald was able to perfectly mimic his personality and American accent, and limit his magical abilities to be only on par with Gravesæ own, as well as convincingly and effectively carry out Graves' many duties, while also gradually managing to locate the rampaging
    Obscurial
    , all without arousing suspicion. Grindelwald demonstrated his brilliance yet again when he orchestrated an escape plan cunning enough to outwit even the experience of
    Rudolph Spielman
    , whose position as
    Head of Incarceration
    meant he was accustomed to dealing with highly dangerous criminals. During his

    into agreeing to accompany him as he embarked on his revolutionary endeavour to overthrow the
    International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy
    , halted only by Aberforth's timely intervention. As an adult, Grindelwald's skills in manipulating others grew even further, with
    Theseus Scamander
    describing him as a "charismatic blighter", and Grindelwald successfully convincing numerous wizards and witches to join his cause during rallies, to the point where he would receive a standing ovation at his

    Credence Barebone
    into trusting him, doing so by playing the role of a kind mentor to Credence after assuming the identity of
    Percival Graves
    , to the point that Credence was completely unaware that Grindelwald was merely using him. He was also shown to be confident that he could eventually get Credence in his

    </a>
    form to listen to him, which made him enraged when he was seemingly destroyed by MACUSA Aurors. Indeed, Grindelwald was ultimately even able to manipulate the young man to his side by presenting himself as the only one who could give him the answers he wanted, and finally gifting Credence with a proper wand, thus finally succeeding in earning his full confidence. Grindelwald was even able to persuade the kind-hearted and compassionate
    Queenie Goldstein
    to join his ranks, by promising to provide Queenie with the freedom to love and marry
    <a href="Jacob Kowalski.html" key="42e8613e-ec48-4265-ad6d-3a53bb328c70" title="Jacob Kowalski">

    , as well as to provide that freedom to others. An outstanding orator, Grindelwald could charm a fanatical following in hundreds of people at once, to the point that he trusted his new followers to "spread the word" of his ideology across the

    . During his time in prison, the MACUSA was forced to cut out Grindelwald's tongue, as he kept convincing his jailers to join his side, notably thus swaying the formerly loyal MACUSA employee
    Abernathy
    . Indeed, only people with truly incorruptible moral codes, or with a full acceptance of their past sins, were able to resist Grindelwald's charisma.

    : Confident in his own abilities and secure in his own judgement, Grindelwald was a very self-assured individual, and his considerable abilities and brilliant mind both allowed Grindelwald to become a greatly inspiring revolutionary leader. ​​During his younger days, he felt certain that together, he and Dumbledore could start his revolution to conquer the wizarding and non-wizarding worlds. As an adult, Grindelwald proved his leadership by raising and leading a vast army of followers during his

    Percival Graves
    as the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. This was also evident in Grindelwald's consummate knowledge of the
    International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy
    , and his ability to very effectively exploit the sacred law's weaknesses, and rebel against it. In addition, Grindelwald had a decent degree of understanding and knowledge of the
    Rappaport's Law
    and thus used said knowledge to great effect to successfully convince Queenie Goldstein to join him despite her lovable and peaceful personality, as Grindelwald took advantage of Queenie's desperation to be with Jacob, as Jacob being a No Maj cannot be with Queenie with said law in effect to persuade her he will allow her to be with him by abolishing the law after his revolution was successful.

    at Durmstrang Institute. Able to hone his skills to match his exceptionally high potential, Grindelwald became a fully confident, focused, disciplined and versatile practitioner of combative spellwork. In his late teens, he held his own against

    simultaneously during their three-way duel at Godric's Hallow, and later ​​​​​effortlessly won the Elder Wand from its previous master,
    Mykew Gregorovitch
    , with a single stunning spell when he stole it from his
    workshop
    . As an adult, he earned a fearful reputation having killed many witches and wizards during his reign of terror in wizarding world. Though quite capable of performing magic of great destructive power, as seen in the
    Battle in the Lestrange Mausoleum
    , he would sometimes prefer to engage his adversaries in a more traditional and formal manner of combat. When he did this, he could display a surprisingly defensive duelling style, deflecting his opponents' efforts with perfect ease and slowly advancing upon them before delivering the crushing blow, in order to take in the awe with which they observed the immensity of his power, but when duelling Newt Scamander, Grindelwald also used an aggressive duelling style, only once defending and constantly attacking his opponent. He also presumably overpowered Percival Graves, so he could disguise himself as him and infiltrate MACUSA. While impersonating Graves, Grindelwald still displayed considerable skill. Upon being unmasked, Grindelwald not only fended off many MACUSA Aurors simultaneously, seamlessly switching between offence and defence to both repel and attack his opponents, but he also quickly started to overwhelm them, until Newt intervened and restrained him from behind. Grindelwald later escaped from captivity, defeating many broomstick-mounted Aurors, and took control of the
    Incarceration Carriage
    . Later, he overcame the combined might of Theseus himself, as well as the highly skilled Tina Goldstein, Newt Scamander and
    Leta Lestrange
    , the latter of whom he killed. During his reign of terror, Albus Dumbledore was considered by the British Ministry of Magic to be the only duelist capable of overpowering and capturing Grindelwald alone and, at the height of his power, the only one who could defeat him, with much of the wizarding world pleading with Dumbledore to confront him. Indeed, although he was ultimately defeated by him, their duel went down in history as among the greatest ever fought between two wizards.

    Director of Magical Security
    with therefore undeniably great skills in safeguarding the North American wizarding community against the Dark Arts and perfectly imitated Graves's defensive expertise without arousing the suspicion of even

    the Hallow that Grindelwald was least interested in, though he continued his search for it only because the Cloak completed the trio of legendary artefacts. Grindelwald also enchanted a necklace with the symbol of

    . Grindelwald skill was such that he could cast several minor spells both non-verbally and wandlessly to a great effect: disarming Newt and Tina and summoning their wands, as well as Newt's case to him, before levitating them alongside Jacob, and slamming them down; summoning the magical orb containing the Obscurus from Newt's case; levitating Credence away and even levitating and throwing a car, all with mere gestures. Grindelwald later instantly made the wands of the Aurors inside his
    Incarceration Carriage
    reverse direction and hover dangerously in front of their owners throats. He took down several Aurors following him with the
    Tempest Jinx
    , and effortlessly unlocked the door to the Incarceration Carriage. Grindelwald also displayed phenomenal mastery over the

    , capable of instantly conjuring up massive magical shields with ease. Indeed, Grindelwald's Shield Charm was powerful enough to repel a barrage of spells fired at him by around thirty trained Aurors simultaneously without fail. After his rally, Grindelwald also drew up an incredibly powerful protective ring of fire around himself, which he proceeded to bewitch so that only those truly loyal to him and his cause could pass through it unscathed, with those insufficiently loyal to him, such as
    Krall
    , instead disintegrating from the fire. While disguised as Graves, Grindelwald locked the door to his office with a powerful charm that Queenie was not able to break. In addition, he was able to brand Dumstrang with his symbol and enchant it to make it forever irremovable, even after his death. He could also at least conjure a non-corporeal

    Newt Scamander
    , Grindelwald generated shock-waves of blue lightning that quickly knocked down Newt, before using the same spell to torture him. While escaping his flying
    Incarceration Carriage
    , Grindelwald blasted massive lightning bolts to dispatch the handful of broomstick-mounted Aurors tasked with escorting it, and then easily manipulated the waters of the Hudson River to flood the carriage, nearly drowning all those inside. Moreover, following his rally, Grindelwald was able to conjure an incredibly powerful
    ring of black fire
    that he was able to manipulate to cast columns of
    fire
    fast enough to reach Aurors in mid-Apparition, and the animated fire could shape itself into a fiery winged demon capable which nearly destroyed the Mausoleum.

    visions
    in order to be able to know what he saw and was able to craft a
    skull-hookah
    capable of enhancing his visions and using it to allow him to share them with others. The sheer strength of his gift was displayed by how while still twelve years prior to the beginning of the
    Second World War
    , he already predicted it in detail and thus used his Skull-hookah to project fearsome images of the future Blitzkrieg, Holocaust, and nuclear bombings, for attendees of his rally to see. However, when he had a
    vision
    about the existence of a powerful
    Obscurial
    linked to
    Credence Barebone
    , Grindelwald initially misinterpreted his vision, believing that Credence would lead him to the Obscurial child while in fact, Credence was the Obscurial himself. However, it should be noted that he had not anticipated such a miraculous thing happening as Credence is the only known Obscurial ever to have survived past the age of ten. He would also rely on
    Astrology
    , and use the relative positions of celestial bodies to try and gain further insight into future events, possibly in an effort to pinpoint at what point in time his
    predictions
    would be taking place, and kept a copy of the

    simultaneously drop to their knees with their arms locked behind against their backs, all with a silent hand gesture. When he interrogated Newt shortly thereafter, Grindelwald Summoned the protective orb containing an Obscurus by silently gesturing it forth. He later saved the life of Credence Barebone from an oncoming train in the New York City Subway by hurling the young man sideways off the tracks with a wave of his wand-free hand. Grindelwald was even able to send an automobile flying across a street at Tina with a silent wave of his hand. By using only silent hand gestures, Grindelwald generated forceful shock-waves to move and otherwise exert force on people and objects, notably being able to break apart the ground by sending a shock-wave rippling through a street, and later performing this on the train tracks Newt was standing on, to knock him down. Grindelwald later overwhelmed twenty MACUSA Aurors simultaneously without speaking a single incantation. Grindelwald also healed the cuts on Credence's hand by silently running his own over it. While escaping his
    Incarceration Carriage
    , Grindelwald simultaneously reversed the direction of Aurors' wands, making them point at their own throats, and disintegrated Spielman's wand. He subsequently defeated all of the remaining Aurors (along with
    Head of Incarceration
    Rudolph Spielman) by non-verbally using the
    Elder Wand
    . After he threw Spielman out of the carriage, he dropped a wand after him and, just before his captor was about to hit the water, made said wand fly into the latter's hand by doing a clasp-like movement with his hand, while both Spielman and the wand were quickly falling through the air. Grindelwald also used wandless magic to accelerate the growth of a baby
    Phoenix
    to adulthood in an instant, as well as to, both wandlessly and nonverbally, show to others his visions of the future
    Second World War
    with his

    Credence Barebone

    Obscurial
    , which made recruiting him rather difficult, Grindelwald calmly continued to try to recruit Credence to his side, despite also having to chase after him through New York, and also fend off Newt and
    Tina
    in the process. When Grindelwald learned that Credence was still alive, he quickly resolved to take advantage of the fact that Credence was unaware that the cruel, verbal mistreatment he got from
    Percival Graves
    had actually come from a disguised Grindelwald. As such, he promptly began seeking Credence out again. Grindelwald also showed no fear when the

    successfully imprisoned him, instead mocking
    Newt Scamander
    and
    President Picquery
    to their faces. His spirit remained unbroken after six months of MACUSA imprisonment, since Grindelwald was so effective at persuading his jailers to join his side, that President Picquery ordered her men to cut out the Dark Wizard's tongue. Indeed, Grindelwald's calm, yet unbreakable resolve greatly contributed to how persuasive his international rallies were. This was demonstrated when Grindelwald did not react violently after one of
    Theseus Scamander
    's
    Aurors
    killed one of his followers, so as to show the rally attendees that it was the Aurors, not the cause he advocated, that were truly violent, and were therefore truly to blame for the

Indeed, despite being defenceless against the greater Dark Wizard, who possessed a far greater capability for evil and destruction along with power and skill superior to Grindelwald‘s own, he was not intimidated and instead sadistically mocked Voldemort's efforts to get information out of him about the Elder Wand, daring the younger and more powerful Dark Wizard to kill him, in a last attempt to find redemption for his crimes.

   first met Grindelwald when he was seventeen. They were introduced by Grindelwald's great aunt,
   Bathilda Bagshot
   . They got along almost instantly, according to Bagshot. They had much in common, including the quest for the

   and edgy ideals about the structure of a wizard-led society. Eventually, their relationship developed further into one that went beyond mere friendship, one that was romantic, intense and passionate, as well as sexual. The two young lovers made plans to find the Deathly Hallows and lead a
   wizarding revolution
   with themselves as leaders, but Albus neglected his younger siblings,

   and
   Ariana
   , as a result. When Aberforth confronted the pair over this, Grindelwald lost his temper and attacked Aberforth. Albus rushed forward to defend his brother, and during the duel Ariana was killed. Grindelwald fled, his relationship with Albus over, although their feelings for one another would not subside.
  </p>
  <p key="6b83ae5d-da4d-402e-9ad5-3a06c4fac4df">
   Over the next few decades, Grindelwald caused considerable havoc on behalf of his revolution but due to a past Blood Pact between them, neither Grindelwald or Dumbledore could directly fight one another, which frustrated Grindelwald as it prevented him from attacking Britain, which was essentially Dumbledore's protectorate and operates on behalf of in his duties outside of Hogwarts. Although at this point, their relationship seemed to be a thing of the past, Grindelwald still acknowledged and respected the extraordinary magical and intellectual capabilities of his former lover, noting Dumbledore far outclassed any of his followers and with his equal intelligence and magical capability, he had the ability to subtly intervene anyway in his revolution, and this respect made Dumbledore the only wizard Grindelwald was wary of. Grindelwald feared Dumbledore as he recognised that Dumbledore would be capable of defeating him. This made Grindelwald seek out Credence Barebone in order to be able to use him as a weapon in case Dumbledore attacked him, although despite his claims of wanting to use Credence to kill Dumbledore, it seemed unlikely as Britain was always noted long after his revolution to be the only place Grindelwald never attacked, which could imply Grindelwald was either willing to tolerate Dumbledore, as at the time, even with the blood pact vial stolen, he didin't have broken it anyway, or he wanted to conquer the rest of the wizarding world first before finally fighting Dumbledore to further increases his chances of victory. It also seemed that Grindelwald retained interest in Dumbledore, as shown by his taking time to question Newt regarding why Dumbledore would be fond of him while disguised as Graves and seeming reluctance to stop questioning him and sentence him and Tina to death after making a mistake, and perhaps may even have unresolved affections for him, as he, repeatedly, showed hatred for Newt being Dumbledore's favourite. Eventually, however, by
   1945
   , the blood pact between them was abolished. Dumbledore and Grindelwald engaged each other in a legendary

    duel
   </a>
   , one to be marked as the one of the greatest ever fought between two wizards. However, Dumbledore's greater power and skill ultimately defeated Grindelwald despite his mastery of the
   Elder Wand
   during their duel, and Grindelwald was imprisoned in his own prison,

   about the Elder Wand despite the fact that he was imprisoned, wandless, and face-to-face with the only Dark Wizard ever considered more powerful than himself. This seems to indicate that Grindelwald no longer held the views of those who practised the Dark Arts and had felt remorse for his actions. It was speculated by

   that Grindelwald had given his life to prevent Voldemort from desecrating Dumbledore's tomb, perhaps indicating that despite all that happened, Grindelwald still retained some care and respect for his old friend and lover. Dumbledore's acknowledgement of Grindelwald's attempt to achieve redemption also indicated he believed Grindelwald was capable of changing out of possible remaining affection for him.

As the two boys were planning to travel around the world, they also planned to take Ariana with them. Aberforth opposed them, telling them that he would be able to take care of Ariana once more. Grindelwald became very angry and used the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on Aberforth; Albus then defended his brother and the three boys had a duel, in which Ariana was accidentally killed. Grindelwald escaped and left the country. Aberforth retained bitter memories towards Grindelwald for many years after their fateful encounter, and when he recounted the events that led to his sister's death Harry noted the "positively dangerous" look that came over his face when Grindelwald's name was mentioned.

Grindelwald likewise showed no fear toward the Dark Lord, and laughed, scornfully challenging Voldemort to kill him and using the younger wizard’s chosen feared name as a mockery of his great power, much to the latter's fury. Grindelwald refused to tell Voldemort the Elder Wand's location and taunted him by telling him that he would never be able to master the wand.

   Grindelwald, while disguised as Percival Graves, met the gifted
   Magizoologist
   in New York in 1926. Grindelwald, not finding Newt's unique personality or magical skills impressive, questioned him on why Dumbledore would be fond of him. Newt at one point was outraged and disgusted when Grindelwald implied Newt was serving the Greater Good and coldly told him he was not one of the dark wizard's acolytes, which actually impressed the Dark Wizard, causing him to smirk. He seemed to have been interested in talking more about it but upon having made a slip up of how he considered the Obscurus without a host useless, he ultimately did everything in his power to have Newt take the blame for the
   Obscurial
   deaths and nearly had him executed, albeit reluctantly, although it remained unknown what he would have done to Newt had the conversation continued. Grindelwald also revealed to
   Tina Goldstein
   that Newt had been expelled from Hogwarts for nearly killing a student in an incident involving a magical beast. When Newt intervened in Grindelwald's plan to acquire
   Credence Barebone
   , Grindelwald dropped all pretence and ferociously attacked Newt, duelling and even torturing him with lightning spells in a rage. Newt managed to capture Grindelwald by use of
   Swooping Evil
   and revealed his true identity to MACUSA, but before being carried off Grindelwald turned to Newt and said mysteriously "Will we die, just a little?", possibly as a message for Dumbledore due to his knowing Newt's closeness to Dumbledore. Grindelwald later encountered Newt in

   and attacked him and his allies, mocking Newt whether Dumbledore would mourn for him. Newt, however, survived the battle and out of hatred towards Grindelwald for having murdered Leta Lestrange, gave Dumbledore the blood pact vial, which would doom Grindelwald many years later. Grindelwald’s actions towards Newt seem to suggest he hated the younger man not only because he had thwarted him once, but also because he is infuriatingly jealous of Dumbledore’s admiration of Newt’s selfless qualities. It appears that Grindelwald, ever the narcissist, wanted to remain the centre of attention and admiration in his former lover’s mind in spite of his Dark deeds, their now opposing views, and Grindelwald’s own stated desire to have Dumbledore killed.

   , telling her angrily she always turned up when he least wanted her, implying she may have intervened with his attempts to find the Obscurus previously, and while he did not bother to finish her, he threw a car at her without hesitation, thus beating her without using lethal force but still endangering her life. A year later, while convincing Queenie to join his ranks, Grindelwald painted Tina in a negative light by telling Queenie that it wasn't the latter's fault for having an

   was his reward instead, although at least he did not just kill Credence to cover any traces. When it was revealed soon after that Credence was in fact the Obscurial, Grindelwald was surprised but quickly recovered and reassumed his old treatment of Credence and tried to recruit him to help expose the North American wizarding community, and create a weapon against

As such, because of his magical heritage, Grindelwald showed genuine empathy for how badly and unjustly Credence was treated, not only being upset and resentful of how Picquery had coldly ordered Credence to be destroyed just because he threatened to expose wizardkind, but also pitying how Mary Lou nearly destroyed her own adopted son just because he was magical.

   Lestrange family Mausoleum

   Global wizarding war
   by passing through the loyalty testing blue fire and joining
   Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes

Due to this, Grindelwald despised her, as he was planning to lead wizardkind to rise above the non-wizarding community, and seemed pleased when she became a victim of Credence's Obscurus, as he told Credence when believing he was just as a Squib, that the death of Mary Lou was his reward. Months later, Grindelwald showed clear resentment when referring to Mary Lou for her near destruction of her own adopted son just because he was magical.
