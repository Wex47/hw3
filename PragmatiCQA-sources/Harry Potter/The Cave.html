    Tom Riddle
   </a>
   was brought to a seaside site near this cave on holiday with his
   orphanage
   . He discovered this cave and terrorised two fellow orphans,
   Amy Benson
   and
   Dennis Bishop
   , there. He most likely magicked their way to the cave scaring the children. The experience was so terrible they refused to divulge exactly what happened. Without magic, entering the cave would require uncommon mountaineering skills, as boats cannot approach the cliffs.
  </p>
  <p key="110bb17f-9a0b-477c-b9c4-41f850332941">
   The first incursion upon the cave was by
   Regulus Black
   and
   Kreacher
   after

    Voldemort
   </a>
   asked Regulus Black for a
   house elf
   . Regulus Black offered Kreacher and he was taken here. Kreacher was forced to drink the potion and Voldemort left, leaving him to get killed by the
   Inferi
   .
   Kreacher
   disapparated back as Voldemort didn't remember or realise that house elves could apparate in and out. Kreacher told Regulus Black what had happened and Regulus started to hate Voldemort. Regulus worked out that Voldemort had made Horcruxes and asked Kreacher to take him back. Regulus got the locket, which was later stolen from the Black family home.

   The second skirmish at the Horcrux cave took place on
   29 June

   Wool's Orphanage
   as a boy. He took

   along with him to find the Horcrux.
   The "Horcrux" turned out to be a fake. Finding a cryptic note inside from an "
   R.A.B.
   ", Harry kept the locket, not because it was valuable, but because of what it had cost to obtain it.
  </p>
  <p key="6f8d6cf4-ac65-447f-ae59-09bce168b406">
   Upon learning that Harry was hunting his Horcruxes, having taken
   Hufflepuff's Cup
   from the
   Lestrange Vault
   , Voldemort immediately went to check the other ones for their safety and redouble their security. After finding
   Marvolo Gaunt's Ring
   gone from the
   Gaunt Shack
   , he immediately arrived at the cave and found the locket also gone, much to his murderous fury.

  <p key="bdbed230-f4e8-418e-8a2f-29c428be653e">
   Voldemort later decided to use this cave as a location for one of his Horcruxes (
   Salazar Slytherin
   's
   Locket
   ). It was a very difficult place to find and even
   <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="def754d2-8cfb-429f-bbec-d66cf1510667" title="Albus Dumbledore">
    Dumbledore
   </a>
   had to make a lot of research about Voldemort's past. Upon storing the locket in the cave, Voldemort set up a large number of complex enchantments, designed to keep others out but still allow him access to the Horcrux, should he desire to visit or remove it. As acknowledged by Dumbledore himself, the defences that Voldemort had set up within were well-designed in that one person alone could not enter and leave it without assistance.
  </p>
  <p key="a8593245-3520-4186-9873-64fa62c4644e">
   He placed a
   spell
   on the cave so that it was impossible to
   Apparate
   inside it
   (though ineffective against
   house-elf
   magic
   , as Voldemort underestimated them).
  </p>
  <p key="e645ef99-5211-434d-b18b-f98daa763ce2">
   A smaller entrance was made: a door which required a
   blood
   sacrifice, a
   weakness payment
   , to open. According to
   <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="ac8e4336-58b9-48c4-80bb-93ce918f83fc" title="Albus Dumbledore">
    Dumbledore
   </a>
   , this was due to a common misconception by Voldemort that physical pain would weaken a person entering the chamber.
  </p>
  <p key="4e8df34c-e5f2-4c95-a009-e0e530ead498">
   An
   Inferi
   -infested lake separated the entrance of the cave from the Horcrux. Any attempt to use a
   Summoning Charm
   to get the Horcrux would cause one or more
   Inferi
   to leap out of the
   water
   to block the spell's effect. If the water is disturbed, the Inferi would emerge and attempt to drag the intruder into the water to drown. The Inferi are frightened off by
   fire
   . The darkness within the cave was noted to be denser than normal, and the light created from a
   Wand-Lighting Charm
   would illuminate less than expected.
  </p>
  <p key="84c6a930-3788-4561-a3d2-1a353f2fe794">
   The Horcrux was placed on an
   island
   in the middle of the lake. To get there, one had to find an
   invisible boat
   anchored to the cavern wall. The boat was enchanted so that only one
   <a href="Wizardkind.html" key="5fa0edf6-7ed4-41b6-af0a-7ab5bcd8d75c" title="Wizardkind">
    wizard
   </a>
   of age could be transported in it. This once again shows Voldemort's habit of underestimating his opponents, because he did not expect any underage wizard would attempt such feats.
  </p>
  <p key="d1e769ed-18b5-405b-9f5c-fdc6d039eeeb">
   The Horcrux itself was in a basin filled with a
   potion
   that could not be touched, vanished, transfigured, or charmed; the only way to dispose of it was to drink it. Once drunk, though, it caused the drinker to see "terrible things", to experience almost unbearable burning in one's insides, and to be dehydrated. If the drinker still had strength left after consuming the potion, conjured water would vanish on them and they would have to drink from the lake; upon disturbing the water an army of Inferi would rise from the lake and attempt to kill the interloper by dragging them under the water and drowning them.
