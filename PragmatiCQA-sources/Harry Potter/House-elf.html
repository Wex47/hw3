   Their magic was limited by the lack of a wand. However, unlike some other magical beings, the house-elf was actually quite happy not to own a wand, as they did not require one for their daily activities. Apart from routine domestic tasks, house-elves usually had to obtain permission from their master before they would use their own brand of magic for other things. Although a house-elf might rarely act without permission, they would have to punish themselves for these acts.

   A house-elf must obey any commands given to them by their masters. At times, they seemed to desire to disobey these orders, but as their master's orders were "the house-elf's highest law", they couldn't, and were forced to punish themselves if they did. However, a house-elf might find loopholes within their master's or mistress's orders. For example, despite his loathing for Sirius Black, Kreacher could not disobey his direct orders. However, when Sirius yelled at him to "get out", which he meant to get out of the kitchen, Kreacher was able to interpret the command in a way that enabled him to leave

   Before this, Voldemort forced Kreacher to drink

   In addition, Voldemort framed the house-elf Hokey for the murder of Hepzibah Smith.

   When a house-elf was mistreated, they would typically work just enough to obey their master's commands. However, if even the slightest loophole could be found in a master's orders, house-elves that were unhappy with their master would exploit that loophole to their advantage.
   The best way for a master to ensure full loyalty and compliance with their orders was to simply treat them properly. This was evidenced in

   House-elves
   were so intensely loyal to their masters that they would not allow themselves to be set free unless their master presented them with clothes and this loyalty, in and of itself, was something akin to a code of honour among their kind such that it was not uncommon for a house-elf to carry out their imperatives to the best of their ability, and at great personal risk, even if at the cusp of death. Unfortunately, this could also mean that they were left utterly helpless if ordered to be by their masters, even if the elf wished otherwise, as seen when Kreacher apparently wasn't able to prevent Regulus's sacrifice after the latter's explicit orders for Kreacher to let him die through inaction and not interfering. To symbolise this, they usually wore makeshift clothes made with found objects such as pillowcases and rags. These clothes could become quite filthy, and yet the house-elf would not clean their clothes to further express that they had no needs which were not specifically commanded to them by the master. House-elves would punish, torture, or even maim themselves if they thought it would please the master .
  </p>
  <p key="1474ddd1-61dc-4cc8-98ac-4cb20bf99d31">
   House-elves not only served one specific master, but the whole family of the master and whoever the house-elf was ordered by the master to serve; however, if an order or instruction from a specific master they served had been given and worded specifically enough, then not even the other members of the family would be able to circumvent it, as seen when Regulus told Kreacher not to divulge the circumstances concerning the former's demise to the rest of the Blacks, with that knowledge resurfacing only after Harry was given ownership over the house-elf and ordering Kreacher to reveal what he knew, not violating Regulus's final command seeing that Harry wasn't a Black.

    test, it is possible that house-elves have an average life expectancy of 200 years, cannot be ordered to kill themselves, breed infrequently and only with their master's permission, can override wizard enchantments, and have an allegiance to their home rather than its inhabitants. The answer key of the test awards five points for counting "cannot be ordered to kill themselves" as false, and one point for counting "A house-elf's allegiance is foremost to its house (rather than to the inhabitants of the house)", likely implying that this is only partially true. Perhaps house-elves are loyal to the inhabitants of a house only so long as they inhabit the house. The other statements are presumably true, and a house-elf can likely be ordered to kill itself, although most owners would have little reason to use this order.

   Elves or similar creatures doing menial tasks around a home, and leaving when rewarded for their tasks with money or clothes, is a common motif in European folklore.

   The most well-known example of this in the English-speaking world is the
   Brownie
   , a small fairy-like creature who helps around a home in exchange for daily food and drink (in the form of hot milk, honey and gruel) but will depart forever if it is paid in human money. In some of the legends, rather than departing, the Brownie would instead turn malicious and antagonise their owners, much like a Harry Potter

   's House-Elves is French folklore's "farfadet". Originating in the southern areas, one specific legend about farfadets is that they were "wrinkled, brown-skinned midgets who went around either naked or wearing dirty rags", a description that is almost identical to Rowling's elves. The Farfadets would help around a farming home, completing tasks not done in the day by the human servants. They would leave forever if the master of the house gave them new clothes to replace their shabby old ones; once again, the parallels are obvious, though in this case, the reasoning is that Farfadets are proud creatures who are offended by the implication that their clothes
