   In the
   1993–1994 school year
   , Fudge had to deal with assumed mass-murderer
   Sirius Black
   's escape from Azkaban. As Fudge believed Black to be a threat to society as well as to Harry, he had
   Dementors
   stationed at Hogwarts and in
   Hogsmeade
   . However, Black narrowly escaped from Fudge's fingers.

   , Fudge saw Voldemort with his own eyes and was forced to admit that Harry and Dumbledore had been telling the truth the whole time, causing the wizarding community to protest and scream for his resignation. He was replaced as Minister for Magic by

   Second Wizarding War
   to the Muggle Prime Minister if Scrimgeour was unable to.

   was the top candidate to succeed
   Millicent Bagnold
   as the next
   Minister for Magic

   Bartemius Crouch Senior
   was favoured to be the next Minister for his effective methods of fighting the
   Death Eaters
   , but it was Fudge who finally replaced Bagnold when Crouch lost popularity following his
   son
   's trial. However, Fudge never forgot how much popularity and support Dumbledore received during the election. He also never forgot how much Crouch was admired in the Ministry, leaving him so jealous and with a strong dislike of Crouch that his very first act as Minister of Magic was to have Crouch reassigned to the department of International Magical Cooperation.

   Prime Minister
   trying to throw Fudge out of his office window, as he believed their meeting was an attempt at the hands of the
   opposition
   to sabotage his career and position in the muggle world.

  <p key="a0201160-d214-410d-beec-ae0bf83bff4b">
   In Fudge's early days as Minister, it was said that he was not very self-confident, and constantly sent

   At some point early on during his Ministerial career and before

   Fudge arrogantly and controversially awarded himself the

   to
   Azkaban
   prison, mainly because Hagrid's record was against him. Dumbledore tried to convince Fudge that taking Hagrid would make no difference, but Fudge was quick to cite that out of dutiful obligation he had no other choice. However, Fudge had his doubts, and reassured Hagrid that if another person was found to be responsible, he would be released immediately. At the same time, Lucius Malfoy, a then school governor, had Dumbledore suspended, which Fudge tried to protest against, but in futility.
   Eventually, when it was proven that Hagrid was indeed innocent, Fudge was as good as his word and immediately released him.

  <p key="dded0526-e060-4b23-abe4-f9a051c9a6bc">
   That summer,
   Sirius Black
   escaped from Azkaban. A few weeks prior to Black's escape, Fudge had visited him while on a tour of Azkaban prison and was unnerved at how normal Black seemed relative to the other prisoners.

  <p key="7504844d-2299-487e-81d8-1981dbe756b6">
   Convinced Black would be caught quickly, Fudge alerted the Muggle Prime Minister of the situation,
   and asked that the Muggles keep an eye out for Black, as well; the Ministry set up a special hot line for the Muggles to call with any information.
   Because of Black's connection to

   Arthur Weasley

Fudge assured Harry that the problem had been dealt with; Marge had been punctured by members of the Accidental Magical Reversal Squad and her memory modified by Obliviators. When Harry asked what would happen to him, Fudge told him not to worry, and that he would not receive punishment, since the circumstances had changed. The truth was, Fudge had let Harry off because he had been relieved to find him alive and told him that running away at night while a killer was on the loose was very irresponsible. Fudge then asked that for his protection, Harry stay at the

   In the spring of 1995, Fudge was summoned to Hogwarts after Barty Crouch was seen going mad and then disappeared. Fudge decided to cover up this embarrassing situation, and also refused to believe anything Crouch said, believing it to be the words of a lunatic. Fudge even suggested that
   Olympe Maxime
   had murdered him due to her being a
   half-giant
   , since the incident occurred near the
   Beauxbatons Carriage
   that night. When Dumbledore expressed his belief that Fudge's accusation was due to his personal prejudice towards so-called '
   half-breeds
   ,' Fudge, in turn, believed that Dumbledore's friendship with

   , another half-giant, was clouding his judgement. Harry also pointed out that Madam Maxime would have had a difficult time hiding, due to her abnormal size, this left Fudge feeling embarrassed.
   Fudge was later asked to fill in for Mr Crouch as a judge of the 1994
   Triwizard Tournament

   's dead body, Fudge informed the crowd and then tried to get Harry to release him. After an injured Harry released Cedric's corpse, Fudge suggested that he go to the hospital wing. Dumbledore refused the suggestion, wanting Harry to remain where he was. When Fudge was informed the
   Death Eater
   responsible had been caught, and feeling his personal safety was in jeopardy, he summoned a Dementor to accompany him into the castle, disregarding both Dumbledore's obvious dislike for the creatures and the fact that the culprit was already restrained; said Dementor then sucked out
   Barty Crouch Jnr
   's soul, leaving him an empty shell of his former self, unable to give testimony about Voldemort's return. This lack of testimony helped Fudge discredit Dumbledore the following year.

  <p key="4f513336-751a-42e6-b27f-afb99f5d68e4">
   Paranoid that Dumbledore may have had designs on the role of Minister himself, Fudge refused to believe the warning that Voldemort had returned. Fudge's decision was also influenced by one of
   Rita Skeeter
   's articles about Harry. In the article Skeeter wrote that Harry's scar had long-term negative effects on his mental health. This led Fudge to suggest that Harry may have been hallucinating. This made Harry an unreliable witness in Fudge's mind; when Harry started naming the identities of the Death Eaters who returned to Voldemort's side, he could only identify those who had been cleared by the Wizengamot, which Fudge claimed Harry could have looked up in old copies of the
   <i key="ba00162d-d79a-4971-b978-7a1d7fa3cae9">

  <p key="42a14436-f339-4071-9174-3d1b217d67c3">
   Dumbledore, however, insisted that the situation was still salvageable if they took the necessary precautions; they needed to remove Azkaban from the control of the Dementors and send peace envoys to the giants. Fudge was horrified at the mere prospect of both of these stating it would mean the end of his career if he did either one. Dumbledore, in turn, countered that Fudge was blinded by the love of his office, and his own prejudices. He provided a warning that the decision Fudge made here and now, would affect how he was remembered in the future: If Fudge took the necessary measures, he would be hailed as a hero throughout the ages, whether he remained in office or not. If he did nothing, then he would be immortalised as a coward who allowed Voldemort the opportunity to try and destroy the world they tried so hard to rebuild.

  <p key="47d5153c-2903-427c-9410-38cb692304dc">
   However, Fudge saw Dumbledore's suggestions as ludicrous (fearing he would be forced out of office for even suggesting it). As such he and Dumbledore acknowledged that they had reached a parting of the ways; Fudge was left to act as he saw fit, while Dumbledore acted immediately to reactivate the

   decrees
   , Fudge gradually extended her powers while suppressing Dumbledore's and Harry's freedom of expressing their claims. Fudge eventually handed full control of Hogwarts to Umbridge when, one evening, Harry was caught violating
   Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four
   ; Dumbledore took the blame and escaped after swiftly defeating Fudge, Umbridge,
   Kingsley Shacklebolt
   and
   John Dawlish

   After the
   mass breakout

   were cousins, either unaware or neglecting that Sirius had been disowned by his family and the two were mortal enemies. Throughout all of this, Fudge unknowingly became an ally to Voldermort, giving him an entire year to rebuild his forces uninterrupted. Because Fudge ignored Dumbledore's previous warnings, Voldemort was also able to convince the Dementors, Giants and other factions mistreated by the Ministry to join him. The Dementors' defection also allowed Voldemort to free the majority of his loyal followers, including Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius, amongst other falsely-reformed Death Eaters, remained in Fudge's trust, while discreetly manipulating him to assist their master and their own benefits. While the Order and Harry considered the possibility of Fudge being under the
   Imperius Curse
   , Dumbledore believed otherwise, which was of little comfort. Within a year of his return, Voldemort had a sizeable, still growing army at his disposal and was ready to begin his conquest.

This failed, as Dumbledore refused to make the arrangement, knowing that Harry would think the idea outrageous, but the idea did not die out when
   Rufus Scrimgeour
   took over. Also, prior to his dismissal, Fudge was threatened by Voldemort to stand aside as Minister, or a mass murder of Muggles would take place. Fudge refused, which resulted in the collapse of the

   , and Scrimgeour was killed because he walked the same political path as Fudge did. Only when the Ministry was retaken after

   was
   Kingsley Shacklebolt
   able to undo all the damage that Fudge and his administration had started.

   Fudge was described as a "portly little man", with rumpled grey hair. He was recognisable by his lime green bowler hat, which he usually wore or held and often wore a pinstriped cloak, but not exclusively. When Harry Potter first saw him, Fudge was wearing a pinstriped suit, scarlet tie, long black travelling cloak, pointed purple boots, and lime green bowler hat.
   On another occasion he wore a bottle-green suit. For the execution of Buckbeak he had a gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.

   However, this was ultimately a facade to hide his true colours, as Fudge was in fact an extremely prejudiced individual, a trait that seemed to rub off on his puppet,
   Dolores Umbridge
   . He seemed to favour people born with high status, particularly the
   Malfoys
   , over lower class, such as the

   , as seen in his friendship with
   Lucius Malfoy
   and selective neglect of
   Arthur Weasley
   , all the while being unable to tell Lucius was manipulating him. Also, despite being accepting towards Muggles, Fudge appeared to favour pure-bloods, and showed little respect for

   half-breeds
   , as he spoke in disinterest when interrogating

   Myrtle

   Olympe Maxime

   </a>
   to the
   hearing
   for testimony, Fudge blatantly stated that he had no time to listen to house-elves, showing his disregard for what he considered to be an inferior species, and his overall belief that the elves are lower than wizards, indicating he could be prejudiced against sentient creatures in general.
  </p>
  <p key="b6698ad3-4e2a-4f19-a8b4-264c8bf3c1d9">
   His favouritism had limits, though, for he was not so hasty to imprison Rubeus Hagrid as compared to Olympe Maxime, possibly due to the male half-giant's relationship with Dumbledore. Even so, he turned a blind eye to Lucius Malfoy's own record as a Death Eater because he was cleared in the past (as Lucius lied about being under the
   Imperius Curse
   ) as well as his vaunted position in Wizarding society and frequent cash donations. He was rather tactless, as he was making crude body gestures to communicate with the
   Bulgarian Minister for Magic
   and revolted aloud the moment he saw

   </a>
   's disfigured face, having little sensitivity to the girl's feelings. Upon discovering Harry was a
   Parselmouth
   , Fudge caved into prejudice, and started to doubt Harry simply because he could speak a language that was usually affiliated with the
   Dark Arts
   , making him comparable to
   Ernest Macmillan
   and
   Rita Skeeter
   . His arrogance, in fact, was egregious enough for him to award himself with the
   Order of Merlin
   , First class medal, which caused controversies throughout the community, as it was common view that Fudge's career was "less than distinguished".

  <p key="f85dae13-c6f3-422b-b500-aedcc383c718">
   Despite his claims that he always strove to figure out what was best for everyone, Fudge was ultimately a delusional and selfish hypocrite, a sycophant who favoured peace and tranquillity for the sake of his own position over a truth that would cause disruption of that peace. This was demonstrated when he was reluctant to tell
   <a href="Harry Potter.html" key="cd3ac390-ed26-4bb4-ba17-da7b2aec3a53" title="Harry Potter">
    Harry Potter
   </a>
   the supposed reason for
   Sirius Black
   's escape from
   Azkaban
   , due to not wanting to worry Harry, despite the importance to Harry's safety. Preferring to tell the public what they wanted to hear instead of what they needed to hear, and deluding even himself with such lies, Fudge would use virtually any means to cover up the truth as long as he deemed the evidence to be insufficient, and would not hesitate to ruin the reputation of those who dared to oppose him, even if it meant abusing the powers of his position and making changes in the laws to do so. This included temporarily pardoning
   Willy Widdershins
   for his crime in enchanting regurgitating toilets because he made a deal with the Ministry for his release due to providing testimony against Harry for forming Dumbledore's Army, showing that he was even willing to make deals with criminals if it meant discrediting those who opposed him. Even prior to his dismissal, Fudge attempted to persuade Harry to lie to the wizarding world that the Ministry was performing well in security and maintenance, despite how he mistreated Harry for an entire year, as well as the fact that his inadequacy had already endangered the entire world by denying Voldemort's return; he was seemingly more desperate in saving his own career and reputation than repairing the damage he inflicted to the community's defences against the Death Eaters, making him a truly remorseless and self-centred wizard. He created several new
   rules and regulations
   at Hogwarts in order to increase control and chances to punish students through his puppet Umbridge, despite many of them being ridiculous and unfair. Fudge also used falsified propaganda to maintain his own position at the expense of those who he believed were his enemies, even if that so-called enemy was someone who had helped him out for many years, to which he had no trouble in being ungrateful, and then later shamelessly asking favours from people he had offended, the result of a welled-up penchant for corruption harboured for years in context.
  </p>
  <p key="23744c20-48c1-457b-80ac-e173b9af03aa">
   Fudge also appeared to be more reactive than proactive; he would often wait for a solution to appear, rather than take the initiative and
   <i key="1272cd1b-2619-4ed5-992f-85dee7806d24">

   take the initiative and make his own decisions in attempt of accomplishing his job, they were often misguided and led to disastrous consequences, such as when he placed Dementors at Hogwarts to recapture Sirius Black, which led to students being traumatised and Harry Potter to nearly receive the Dementor's Kiss at the end of the school year. He later insisted on summoning a Dementor to
   Barty Crouch Jnr
   's interrogation for his own protection, despite knowing that Barty had been
   restrained
   and guarded by
   Professor

   , and the possibility that the Dementor would attack the prisoner on sight, which did happen, resulting in the destruction of their most critical piece of evidence at that time. His trust of Dementors also proved useful when he vehemently denied a Dementor would go anywhere near

   the chance to protect themselves and effectively allowing Voldemort a full year to build his forces uninterrupted. With each passing month, his facade as a well-meaning and harmlessly eccentric man waned further and further. Even after his folly had been exposed, Fudge was more concerned about his own reputation than actual security and attempted to deceive the community by persuading Harry to tell them the Ministry under him was achieving positive results, which would have endangered them further by giving them a false sense of security. Despite this, he was willing to stand against Voldemort and showed more courage in this regard than Umbridge did, as he refused to step aside as Minister when threatened, though due to poor preparations Fudge failed to prevent Voldemort from causing the
   Brockdale Bridge
   to collapse, and while he cited that no one in their right mind would yield to such blackmail, it was highly likely that this was another of his desperate attempt to remain in office.

  <p key="4113f5e0-eafd-444f-9e40-181619d9cec5">
   The only known case where Fudge was reluctant to act against his better judgement was the case of Hagrid in spring 1993. While he knew that Hagrid's record was against him, he didn't wish to send him to Azkaban for supposedly opening the Chamber of Secrets without definitive evidence. But Fudge couldn't put off the pressure from the Ministry forever. The situation wasn't entirely hopeless: Fudge promised that if proven innocent, Hagrid would be released and given an apology. In the end, the Minister proved as good as his word.

   Nevertheless, Fudge was, at his core, an extremely arrogant, paranoid, delusional and selfish person. He believed himself to be the smart one, and Albus Dumbledore a troublemaker who conspired to overthrow him for the post of Minister for Magic (despite the fact that Dumbledore had previously refused the post three times when offered) and apparently being more ungrateful for Dumbledore's years of friendly and helpful advice. This was partly due to Fudge remembering Dumbledore's superiority and popularity in the past and present. As stated before, this paranoia was usually kept suppressed, as Fudge continued to (in public) respect Dumbledore over the years, and accepted many of Dumbledore's decisions. By ignoring the professor, however, Fudge had metaphorically shot himself in the foot. With Dumbledore's help over the years, Fudge grew more confident on his own, which made him delude himself into believing that his poorly made choices were correct, making him, in a much more twisted way than Umbridge, the hero in his own story. His increasing lack of preventive action affected his popularity with the wizarding world: despite Fudge's efforts of keeping control, several people chose to believe Dumbledore and Harry over him, and by the summer of 1996, he had been forced to resign from office in disgrace and replaced by the more proactive
   Rufus Scrimgeour
   .

  <p key="88547379-c6a9-4a16-bf6d-7a92532debdf">
   However, despite all his faults, Fudge was not devoid of redeeming qualities; although it is unclear how many of them were to avoid projecting an air of tyranny, and how many came from his own heart. Even Umbridge believed that she would be crossing a line by using the
   Unforgivable Curses
   with his knowledge, since after

   speculated retribution from Fudge, she did not hesitate to agree with the teenager. He also demonstrated compassion when he protested Dumbledore's suspension as Headmaster of Hogwarts, even though the motion had already been carried. He also intended to protect Harry from the recently escaped Sirius Black to the best of his ability. After hearing that the Dementors had attacked Harry twice within Hogwarts' grounds, he had the sense to order them immediately away from the school. At times, Fudge could develop a sense of humour as well: he once assured Harry that "
   <i key="f684c394-90df-4a80-afd6-3c6beea029fa">
    the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts

   ". He also sarcastically responded that Harry might have "a twin brother" when Dumbledore attempted to absolve him of forming the DA.
  </p>
  <p key="c6de3c3a-0e74-4f68-ba61-f526be32449d">
   Although his behaviour between 1995 and 1996 made him appear to be such, Fudge was not a totally unreasonable man and was more rational than Umbridge or Voldemort by nature, as he simply buried himself in his own self-denial, love of office, delusions and paranoia. He was capable of admitting when he was wrong, but only with damnable and solid evidence which he could see with his own eyes. After witnessing Voldemort's return with his own eyes, Fudge could no longer bury himself in lies and cleared Dumbledore's and Harry's names alongside the names of notable members of the
   <a href="Order of the Phoenix.html" key="dba56732-a6b3-4fb4-a2fd-d08c92599c40" title="Order of the Phoenix">

   unjustly persecuted by the Ministry (most notably Rubeus Hagrid, Arthur Weasley, Sirius Black), at the price of him being removed from his position. For instance, he was able to admit to the Muggle Prime Minister, with somewhat humbleness, that starting a ruthless manhunt for Sirius Black may have been aimless since he was in fact innocent all along, which Fudge realised when he learned that Black was killed by

   Over the years, though, Fudge became paranoid that Dumbledore was seeking the Minister position for himself, despite Dumbledore clearly showing lack of interest in the position, rejecting it at least three times. This paranoia was kept suppressed, as Fudge continued to respect Dumbledore over the years and accepted his decisions, despite their eccentricity. Despite constantly seeking advice from the more able wizard, Fudge would nevertheless succumb to the public's views and sometimes go against Dumbledore's insistence on certain issues, such as sending Hagrid to
   Azkaban

   After seeing Voldemort's return in the Ministry, Fudge was forced to accept it all, as well as reinstate Albus' reputation. Following this, Fudge resigned as Minister in disgrace because he refused to take the steps Dumbledore offered him. When Fudge requested Dumbledore to persuade Harry Potter to lie for the Ministry's behalf to the wizarding world in a last ditch effort to cling onto his position, Dumbledore refused, seeing no more desire or purpose in helping Cornelius.

Fudge, in fear that this would jeopardise the peace of his community and his seat as Minister for Magic, refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore, and spread a smear campaign to make it look like they were liars and nutters who were trying to gain attention, as well as take over the Ministry; his decision had partly been influenced by Rita Skeeter's writings, believing Harry to be hallucinating and that being a Parselmouth made him even more untrustworthy. Because of this, Fudge transformed Harry's disciplinary hearing of underage magic used to defend against Dementors into a heavily biased full-court trial, made the

   print slander stories against him as though he was something of a slip-in joke, and granted Umbridge many new privileges to extensively punish and torment the boy.

  <p key="c82fa126-ed11-487c-a4ec-3851753a8a35">
   At first, Harry was shocked by Fudge's blatant denial, and somewhat desperate in regaining recognition during the trial, which did not occur, while, in extension, unsuccessfully trying to persuade his right-hand woman Umbridge. However, as Fudge's antagonism continued, Harry lost faith in the Minister, and began to feel more disgusted at Fudge's increasingly tyrannical hold; Harry only felt more angry when Fudge chose to blame the Azkaban mass breakout on Sirius instead of accepting that Voldemort had returned. When Fudge came to Hogwarts to deal with the Dumbledore's Army business, he sneered at the captured Harry, who replied with the dirtiest look he could muster, and thought it was worth watching Fudge's blood pressure rise from anger by denying his transgression of
   Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four

   When undeniable evidence of Voldemort's return was finally given, Fudge, in a last ditch effort to remain in office, tried to persuade Harry to lie to the wizarding world (which ironically was what he had accused Harry of for a whole year) that the Ministry was doing a good job in security. This failed, as Harry hated Fudge for his actions and held him in contempt; when Harry was notified that Fudge had the gall to attempt to even ask him for such a favour, Harry expressed disgust at the former Minister's shamelessness.

   Dolores Umbridge was Fudge's right-hand woman, being his Senior-Undersecretary, and he trusted her greatly to place her into Hogwarts to control it. He granted her many powers through his
   Educational Decrees
   , and full-heartedly agreed with all of her comments and mockeries against Dumbledore and Harry. It is unclear whether Fudge knew the extent of Umbridge's sadistic and dark nature, but Umbridge was loyal to Fudge only because of the power he was offering her, and felt no true attachments to the misguided man. She was also willing to break the law behind the Minister's back to achieve results, such as summoning
   Dementors
   in an attempt to expel Harry, as well as using the illegal
   Cruciatus Curse
   for interrogation, all the while stating that "what Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him". Curiously, however, in spite of believing Fudge would draw a line there, and in spite of Umbridge often and unfairly receiving far more blame (mostly from Hogwarts) than Fudge for everything that happened that year, both of them were immoral in very similar ways. Still, Umbridge ultimately used Fudge to further her lust for power, making him think she was a mindless extension of his own hunger. When Fudge was dismissed, Umbridge stood beside the new Ministers instead.

This association may have encouraged Fudge's own belief in the superiority of pure-bloods over those with mixed parentage, as well as "half-breeds" and creatures with "near-human intelligence" which his senior assistant, Umbridge, expressed. Fudge admired Lucius for giving donations of gold to the right causes. In return, Fudge granted him many privileges, such as personal access to him, favours in delaying laws and revealing classified information (e.g. the Triwizard Tournament). Fudge gave Lucius tickets to sit in the top box for the

  <p key="bb02296f-1910-461f-852d-fc0bf7a25b40">
   Fudge did have disagreements with Lucius and his views. For instance, Fudge did not oppose Arthur Weasley's
   Muggle Protection Act
   , and allowed Ministry officials to conduct raids on wizard homes (later including Lucius'), searching for artefacts harmful to Muggles. This may have turned Lucius back to the Dark Arts as his plot to re-open the
   Chamber of Secrets
   and discredit Arthur Weasley came about when he did not get his way. Then, when the twelve school governors
   suspended
   Dumbledore for not being able to prevent the Chamber of Secrets incident, Fudge said it was the wrong thing to do, but did not use the law to interfere with the running of Hogwarts as he would later.

   After Harry survived Voldemort's rebirth and reported to him that Lucius was one of the
   Death Eaters
   who came to the re-gathering after receiving the Dark Mark invitation, Fudge took this as a great personal offence, and absolutely refused to believe it, continuing to treat Lucius with great respect and meeting him at the Ministry. He said Harry was just throwing out names of people who were cleared thirteen years previously, and began a campaign to discredit Harry and Dumbledore. The next year, when Lucius' son, Draco Malfoy, captured Harry for being in the illegal organisation calling itself
   Dumbledore's Army
   , Fudge commented that his father must be informed of this achievement. Fudge was completely oblivious to Lucius' dark nature. Lucius, in turn, used this to his advantage and manipulated the gullible Minister to delay laws and other factors that would benefit the Death Eaters. By the time Lucius was caught red-handed as a renewed Death Eater, Lord Voldemort had a year to regain power and followers while being unopposed by the Ministry, making it that much harder for his successor to protect the

   As Arthur was a lower-class person and having a poor family, Fudge always neglected Arthur while having a manipulated friendship with his wealthy rival, Lucius Malfoy, due to Fudge's swaying of money and power. As Arthur was considered an odd duck due to his fascination with Muggle culture, Fudge was able to use that as an excuse that Mr Weasley "did not fit" into the Ministry norm and that he was unfit for promotion to higher office. However, despite his disapproval and neglect of Arthur, Fudge did not oppose Arthur's Muggle Protection Act as he was also accepting towards Muggles, and once allowed Arthur and his family to sit at the Top Box during the Quiddich World Cup. When Lord Voldemort had returned, Fudge suspected Arthur being in league with Dumbledore since he was aware that the two of them were friendly. He even invited Arthur's son, Percy to become his Junior Assistant in an attempt to spy on the Weasley family and Dumbledore, which led to Percy defecting from his family after a row with Arthur. Fudge ignored Arthur and Harry's existences when he and the Wizengamot exited Courtroom Ten. After Fudge was disgraced and forced to resign, Arthur was instantly promoted by Fudge's successor.

By Percy's claim, Fudge was actually glad that Percy left his family for the sake of the Ministry. This may have been a contradiction as this meant Percy was no longer a source of information of the Weasley family's involvement with Dumbledore and Potter. Over the final year of Fudge's term as Minister, he kept using Percy as the court scribe for both
   Harry's disciplinary hearing

   discovery of Dumbledore's Army

   Fudge had a huge hatred for
   Barty Crouch Snr
   . This was because of Barty being one of his main competitors during the election for Minister of Magic in 1990, where he was jealous of how much Crouch was admired in the Ministry. Despite winning, the election left Fudge with such a strong dislike of Crouch, so much that, Fudge's first act as Minister of Magic was to have Crouch reassigned to the Department of International Magical Cooperation, using Crouch's falling popularity after Crouch's son's trial to his advantage. Fudge's dislike of Crouch was strong to the point where he refused to take Crouch seriously when Crouch vanished after trying to warn Dumbledore about his son and Voldemort despite being in a delusional state, Fudge simply dismissed his warnings as the ramblings of a lunatic, and refused to believe the real reason he was gone until he was forced to acknowledge Voldemort's return the following year. This dislike also extended to Crouch's son, as he believed Crouch Jnr was not a true Death Eater and that he only acted through insanity rather than his loyalty to Voldemort, calling him as a lunatic just like his father, and had no regret about Crouch Jnr receiving the Dementors Kiss and therefore ending the Crouch family line, even though Crouch Jnr could no longer testify Voldemort's return as a result. Despite his dislike of Crouch Snr, Fudge apparently required Crouch for translating foreign wizards and creatures who didn't understand English, as he struggled to communicate with the Bulgarian Minister of Magic (who was pretending to not understand English in order to prank Fudge) during the Quidditch World Cup while Crouch was absent. It is unknown what Crouch thought of Fudge, although given his serious and rule abiding nature, he likely disliked Fudge in turn for his bumbling and incompetent nature, and for reassigning him to the Department of International Magical Cooperation, which permanently ruined any further chances of Crouch becoming Minister of Magic despite his fall in popularity.

   When Fudge first ascended his ranks to the Minister for Magic, his bumbling nature failed to worry the citizens, as long as he was willing to take advice from more able people such as Albus Dumbledore. However, Fudge never forgot how much the community supported Dumbledore to become the Minister in the past. As his position was the leader of the entire government, he was nevertheless highly influenced and affected by the opinion of the people as a whole. When a few people would oppose his rule which threatened his administration, he would abuse his powers to discredit such people to maintain his hold on the likings of the rest of them, as well as threatening any employees with dismissal for not supporting his rule; ironically, Fudge only became popular because he took Dumbledore's advice to begin with. When Fudge awarded himself with the
   Order of Merlin

   However, by ignoring Dumbledore's and Potter's warning of Voldemort's return, Fudge endangered the entire world, and despite his increasingly tyrannical hold on them, about half of the British wizard community chose to believe Dumbledore and Potter instead. When undeniable evidence of the truth finally came out, the entire community issued a virtually unanimous condemnation of Fudge's tenure, while Fudge made one last (unsuccessful) attempt to lie to them to regain their trust, which would have further endangered them by denying more preparation. Fudge was ultimately forced to resign after two weeks of pressure, and was remembered by history, as Dumbledore had warned him, "

   , to the point of being unable to say his name aloud, using the evasive alternatives or writing it out. Fudge preferred the peace and tranquillity that came with Voldemort's first downfall that he refused to spoil it as long as there is insufficient evidence of his return. His fear and self-denial led him to campaign to discredit those who tried to say Voldemort is back, instead of making preparations of ensuring their victory and safety in the upcoming war. Cornelius continuously sought excuses of the increasing disappearances and the Azkaban mass breakout instead of accepting the fact that the most evil Dark Wizard has came back. Only when seeing Voldemort in the flesh did Fudge accept the Dark Lord's return. Voldemort was able to take full advantage of Cornelius' besotted moves to rebuild his forces with no interference, and by the time the truth came out, it was too late for the disgraced Minister to defend the community. Despite his fear, Cornelius refused to stand aside when Voldemort threatened him with a mass murder of Muggles.

    - as well as
    Lee Harvey Oswald
