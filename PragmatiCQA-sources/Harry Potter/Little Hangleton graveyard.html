   The graveyard was located in the valley county side outside the village of
   Little Hangleton
   . Like the village, both the graveyard and its church, were clearly visible from the hillside above the valley.
   The graveyard was bordered by a stone wall and sat next to the grounds of the vast Riddle estate and the
   Riddle House
   was clearly visible from the graveyard.
   Frank Bryce
   , the Riddle’s groundskeeper, lived in a cottage on the grounds which was located right next to the graveyard and was separated from it by the stone wall. One set of the cottage’s kitchen windows faced the graveyard.
   The grave yard was placed in an uneven area which resulted in it having high and low burial ranges ranged from wide open to narrow and cramped. There was also a small wooden area filled with
   yew
   and other bare trees.

   In previous years, the Little Hangleton graveyard was a fine resting place for the citizens of the Little Hangleton. However, by
   1994
   the graveyard had become overgrown. Many of the graves had become covered by ivy and moss. Many of the names written on them had become faded. Several grave stones had become tilted and sunken into the ground. A number of stone steps had also recessed into the ground and partly hidden. The
   Riddle House
   can be seen in the distance.

   As well as having normal graves, the graveyard also had above ground mausoleums and a series of below ground vaults and catacombs. While most of those buried had simple head stones to mark their graves, there were several other monuments that were grander. Several were marked by stone obelisks and angels.
  </p>
  <p key="20f2caf6-7dfe-4d21-ad95-1450de6b738e">
   Near the mausoleum and vaults were a number of stone sarcophaguses. Several of these were placed on top of each other. The most opulent of the graves belonged to the
   Riddle family
   . The Riddle grave was marked by a
   large marble headstone
   that bore the names of
   Thomas Riddle
   ,
   Mary Riddle
   and
   Tom Riddle Snr
   .
   The most striking feature of the grave was the large stone statue of the Angel of Death. The angel bore a raised scythe in its right hand and featured a skull face and skeletal hands.

   ) came to
   Little Hangleton
   to seek out his family and travelled to the
   Gaunt shack
   , the former home of his mother
   Merope
   . There, he found his half-crazed uncle,
   Morfin Gaunt
   , living in deplorable conditions. Gaunt (who had no idea that this boy was his nephew) immediately mistook Riddle for
   "that Muggle that married my (Morfin's) sister,"
   . Morfin went on to tell his sister Merope's tragic tale, and how she was abandoned by her husband many years ago. Riddle was enraged by what he considered the tale of his father causing his mother's death and condemning him to a miserable life in a Muggle orphanage.
  </p>
  <p key="eb51a3bd-52d2-424e-bec3-21d5eb1cb1e7">
   After Morfin finished his story, Riddle temporarily incapacitated his uncle with the
   Stunning Spell
   , and took his wand. He then proceeded to the "big house over the way" Morfin had told him about, the
   Riddle House
   . Once there, Riddle used the

    Killing Curse
   </a>
   upon his father and his Muggle grandparents,
   Thomas
   and
   Mary Riddle
   . Riddle returned to the Gaunt shack and replaced Morfin's wand on his person and
   altered
   his memory so that he would confess to killing the Riddles and there would be no further investigation into the matter.
  </p>
  <p key="e1a0c05b-8746-404e-9ad6-72685a565e36">
   The Riddle's gardener,
   Frank Bryce
   , was accused of the murders on the Muggle end of the investigation. Though, the baffled Great Hangleton Police were forced to release Bryce for lack of evidence, as the cause of death could not be determined, Bryce's life was mired in rumour and speculation.
   Morfin, meanwhile, proudly confessed to killing the Riddles to the
   Ministry of Magic
   (which recognised it as a wizard's murder instantly), and was taken away to
   Azkaban
   to serve a life sentence for the
   murder of the Riddle family
   . Thus, two men paid for the crimes of the future Lord Voldemort while Riddle escaped with
   Marvolo Gaunt's Ring
   , stolen from his uncle Morfin.
   The three Riddles were laid to rest in a prepared family grave in the Little Hangleton Graveyard, where their remains would remain undisturbed for over fifty years. Not one citizen within Little Hangleton bothered to even pretend to miss the three Riddles, as they were immensely unpopular due to their snobbish and rude attitudes.

   in August of 1994. Frank Bryce, now an old man, saw a light in the windows of the Riddle House and went to investigate. Inside, he overheard part of Lord Voldemort's plan to kidnap and murder Harry Potter once and for all, but was discovered by
   Nagini
   , who reported his presence to Voldemort. After a brief confrontation between Bryce and the Dark Lord, Voldemort performed the same curse upon Bryce that he performed on the Riddle Family more than half a century ago in that very same house, killing Bryce instantly.

   On the night of the Third Task of the
   Triwizard Tournament
   (which had been grossly manipulated by Lord Voldemort through his servant,
   Barty Crouch Jnr
   ),
   24 June
   1995
   , Harry Potter entered the Triwizard Maze in search of the
   Triwizard Cup
   . Unbeknownst to Harry or anyone else involved in the Tournament, Crouch had turned the Triwizard Cup into a
   Portkey
   to the Little Hangleton Graveyard. Harry and

   arrived at the cup at the same time, and having helped each other several times throughout the course of the Tournament, agreed to take the cup together and tie for first place.
   Upon touching the cup, the pair was transported to the resting place of the Riddle Family, the Little Hangleton Graveyard, where the Dark Lord was awaiting Harry with

   A newly reborn Lord Voldemort then summoned his remaining
   Death Eaters
   to the graveyard by activating their
   Dark Marks
   , several of whom appeared in the graveyard via
   Apparition
   . Voldemort then harshly admonished them all for failing to look for him after his downfall, accusing them of being disloyal and demand they all confirm their devotion towards him, which they all agreed to.

   The Dark Lord, restored to physical form, briefly
   duelled
   Harry, who was forced to hide and dodge behind tombstones to avoid Voldemort's
   curses
   . Finally, Harry fired a
   Disarming Charm
   at Voldemort at the same moment Voldemort attempted a

   on Harry. The spells collided and formed a golden thread that connected the two wands. This rare effect, the
   Reverse Spell
   , occurred due to the wands' "twin cores:" feathers from the same
   phoenix
   . Harry's courage overpowered Voldemort's destructive will, and his wand forced the Dark Lord's wand to regurgitate "echoes" of the spells it had previously cast, in reverse order. First came an "echo" of Cedric Diggory, followed by Frank Bryce, Bertha Jorkins, Harry's mother,

   . They instructed Harry to break the connection when he was ready and to grab the Triwizard Cup to return to Hogwarts, as they would be able to momentarily hold Voldemort at bay. Cedric Diggory requested that Harry take his body back to Hogwarts, to his family, which Harry agreed to do in honour of his fallen classmate and fellow Champion. Harry broke the connection, and while the apparitions held Voldemort off, he was able to grab Cedric's body,
   summon
   the Triwizard Cup to him and escape from the Little Hangleton Graveyard.
