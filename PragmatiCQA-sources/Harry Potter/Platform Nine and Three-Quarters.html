   When returning from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, there was a

   stationed just outside the ticket barrier, in order to regulate exits from the platform through the gate, in order to not alarm the Muggles.

   Through this barrier, of course, lay Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, home of the famous

   . There, a look back at the barrier revealed it is instead a wrought-iron archway with the words âPlatform Nine and Three-Quartersâ on it. Over the scarlet steam train's billowing smoke, there was a sign announcing that the Hogwarts Express would depart at eleven oâclock.
   The platform also had a distinct smell â one which lifted the spirits of young wizards who, like

   as hoardes of students and parents moved around through the steam âlike dark ghostsâ,
   their voices carrying through the mist.

   Finally, at 11:00, a whistle sounded announcing the trainâs departure.
   , and the hiss of the pistons filled the platform as the train began to move,
   creaking out of the station as family members stood on the platform and waved their children off to school.
   Nobody returned to the platform, then, for months â until the end of term, when it once again filled with
