After she had done Flitwick's classroom, he told her that he could have put them all out easily but was concerned he didn't have the authority to do so. After Easter break, the twins used one of their inventions, a

Flitwick was seen cheering and supporting them at their departure after they ran rings around Umbridge and Filch.
