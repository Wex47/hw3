   On the evening of
   30 June
   ,
   1997

    Professor Dumbledore

    mysterious cave

   </a>
   was hidden. They successfully obtained a locket from a lake inside the cave, where Dumbledore weakened himself by drinking a
   potion
   and they narrowly escaped from a group of
   Inferi
   .
   Harry and Dumbledore escaped together and managed to
   Apparate
   back to
   Hogsmeade
   . When Harry moved towards the location of the castle,
   Madam Rosmerta
   (who was under the
   Imperius Curse
   ) appeared and warned Dumbledore that the
   Dark Mark
   had been cast over the school. Using a pair of Rosmerta's

   Astronomy Tower
   .
  </p>
  <p key="550317bd-747d-4adb-bce8-ce5ca0640826">
   When they landed, Dumbledore commanded Harry to get Snape, and talk to no one else. But when Harry headed towards the door leading to the spiral staircase, they heard footsteps coming up the stairs. When the door burst open, Dumbledore
   immobilised
   Harry
   nonverbally
   . At the same time, a cry of
   <i key="b39e5520-e621-4091-bfc3-6b8a9279be81">
    Expelliarmus
   </i>
   went up and the
   Elder Wand
   flew out of Dumbledore's hand and over the battlements.
  </p>
  <p key="1ddd4604-e5bb-4a35-a9e5-1f290010c8e9">
   The person who disarmed Dumbledore was soon revealed to be
   <a href="Draco Malfoy.html" key="52e6812a-8524-4b7d-a37d-abb8bbaa248e" title="Draco Malfoy">
    Draco Malfoy
   </a>
   . Dumbledore pleasantly made conversation, revealing that he already knew Malfoy had been tasked to kill him. While Dumbledore tried to convince Draco to defect, promising to protect his family,
   Death Eaters
   Alecto and Amycus Carrow
   ,
   Thorfinn Rowle
   arrived, along with the
   werewolf
   Fenrir Greyback
   . They congratulated Draco for disarming the Hogwarts Headmaster, and questioned why he had not yet killed him. In arrogance, Greyback attempted to attack Dumbledore, but he was blasted out of the way; Alecto ordered Draco to fulfil the mission, but he was unable to strike the killing blow. A few moments later, Snape arrived. After a plead from Dumbledore, Snape walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. After a few tense moments, Snape then cast the

   After killing Dumbledore, Snape ordered Draco and the Death Eaters to retreat. After they vanished from the
   Astronomy Tower
   , Harry was able to move again and gave chase. Reaching the grounds shortly behind Snape, he tried to curse the Potions master, but Snape was able to counter the jinxes. While
   one
   of the Death Eaters set
   Rubeus Hagrid's cabin
   on fire, Harry and Snape continued to duel; Snape then revealed that
   <i key="b7e97c89-c563-4d34-ae02-1c75f6739bc8">
    he
   </i>
   was the Half-Blood Prince. After the Death Eaters managed to escape, Harry helped

   Water-Making Spell
   .
  </p>
  <p key="42505f09-7fe9-4903-84ad-25c56c2fce46">
   Harry then told Hagrid that Snape killed Dumbledore; Hagrid refused to believe it, but Harry was adamant. Reaching the base of the Astronomy Tower, Hagrid learned the Headmaster was indeed dead. Noticing the locket had fallen out of Dumbledore's pocket, Harry picked it up and opened it. He found a note from an anonymous "
   R.A.B.
   ", which said the real Horcrux had been stolen. Harry crumpled up the note in anger, feeling his trip with Dumbledore had been for nothing. As Harry knelt and cried beside Dumbledore's body, Ginny comforted him, rubbing his back affectionately.

   A few moments later, Professor McGonagall arrived and informed the group that

   were on the way to the hospital. She then asked Harry what had happened, and Harry informed her that Snape had killed Dumbledore. Arthur and Molly then arrived, along with
   Fleur Delacour
   . After a few more conversations, McGonagall decided to leave to prepare for the arrival of the Ministry officials. She ordered Hagrid to call the other Heads of the Houses to meet them all in the
   Headmaster's office
   and summoned Harry to come with her.

  <p key="a3a71e85-f490-408c-8e39-84dce29b45e7">
   When they arrived at the Headmaster's office, McGonagall asked Harry what he and Dumbledore were doing before the tragic incident. Harry steadfastly refused to explain, telling her Dumbledore asked him to remain quiet. He also informed her that Madam Rosmerta was under the
   Imperius Curse
   . When professors Sprout, Flitwick,
   Slughorn
   , and Hagrid arrived, the group discussed what should happen regarding the school remaining open.

   powder-blue carriage
   the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant
   winged palominos
   , arrived flying from the sky and landed on the edge of the Forest. Harry saw Professor
   Olympe Maxime
   from the
   Beauxbatons Academy of Magic
   leave from the carriage and fall sobbing into the arms of

   The place where the ceremony was held was set up outside of the castle near the
   Black Lake
   . Hundreds of golden chairs had been set out in straight even rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it.
   An extraordinary assortment of people had settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young. Most of them Harry did not recognise. The Ministry of Magic delegation was seated in the front row. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake, with Harry sitting closest to the edge. People were whispering to each other. Fawkes could still be heard singing aloud from afar.

   After Hagrid placed the body upon the table in front, a
   little tufty-haired man
   in plain black robes appeared and stood in front of Dumbledore's body, giving a speech that Harry paid little attention to and regarded as most inappropriate for the man whose funeral service it was. Centaurs and
   Merpeople
   had come to pay their respects as well. The centaurs were seen standing quite still, half-hidden in shadow of the forest, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides, and the
   Merpeople
   rose from the water to sing.

  <p key="0ae65649-2d84-4c5c-8fd1-01fdba43ae80">
   At the end of the ceremony, bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledore's body and the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes.
  </p>
  <p key="21e6ee46-2160-4473-b892-61865ea70383">
   When the fire vanished, in its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore's body and the table on which he had rested. There were a few more cries of shock as the centaurs sent a shower of arrows through the air as a sign of respect, but they fell far short of the crowd.

Harry then talked with Ron and Hermione that he was not coming back to Hogwarts and that he was going to track down the Horcruxes to kill Voldemort, that he might visit his parents' graves at

   wedding
