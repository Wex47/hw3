    books and hence seemingly not handed out to Hogwarts students, even as an optional test. As such, considering these tests were so significant in terms of magical education to merit the production of its own separate
    revision guide
    and given how said Ministry division even encouraged those that failed the tests to undergo the coursework offered by
    Kwikspell Company
    before trying again, these tests were presumably - from a purely in-universe perspective - a way for people to to renew their credentials later in life if they achieved bad marks on their school exams.

    It is also interesting to note how, given that the series of character and aptitude tests in question were solely written exams aimed at establishing and assessing the taker's ability to function in the magical community, and considering the results were accepted as valid credentials yet seemingly not taken by Hogwarts students, not only could this test hypothetically serve as a citizenship test for immigrating wizards moving to the UK, but young witches and wizards that did not receive a Hogwarts education might also be given these tests as an alternative to the O.W.L.s and N.E.W:T.s examinations in the event that they were home schooled. Indeed; as it would be unreasonable to expect a child tutored by their parents to have the same level of magical dexterity as those receiving a more thorough education from learned experts at a wizarding school, as the W.O.M.B.A.T.s would also allow the Ministry of Magic to determine whether their instruction in magic was sufficiently well-rounded to allow them to become a functioning member of the wizarding community of Great Britain without holding them to the exact same standard as a Hogwarts student, and encourage them to try again if they failed the first time.
