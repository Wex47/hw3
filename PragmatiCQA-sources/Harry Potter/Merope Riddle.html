   Merope Gaunt had lived in a

   with her father,
   Marvolo
   , and brother,
   Morfin
   . Generations of inbreeding left the
   Gaunts
   violent, mentally unstable, and poverty-stricken.
  </p>
  <p key="2ccb37d4-ab75-425c-b96c-074beac61edf">
   Merope exhibited little
   magical
   talent in her early years, and as a result was mentally and physically abused by her father, who called her a "
   <i key="c3a90694-3fa0-425a-9ba3-cb78f1e57223">
    disgusting little
    Squib
   </i>
   ", among other things. However, this was actually a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Merope's magical abilities were suppressed largely
   <i key="0fd66d82-2242-4a2d-b07d-b4b5c8a38589">
    because
   </i>
   of her father's abuse. It should be noted that a person's magical abilities can be affected by their state of mind, and powerful negative emotions endured on a chronic basis can interfere with or completely drain a person's powers, as
   <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="8753dc83-ee87-4db8-bae4-54c474dc68b2" title="Albus Dumbledore">

   pointed out. By extension, it can be inferred that Merope had magical powers, but had never really used them nor developed them.
  </p>
  <p key="25dec943-4741-4427-a6eb-6de81f6177da">
   However, Merope's magical ability flourished after her father and brother were incarcerated in
   Azkaban
   and she was free from their abuse; she showed herself capable of significant magic, enslaving
   Tom Riddle
   either with the
   Imperius Curse
   or a
   love potion
   for an extended period of time.
   It is unlikely that Merope attended

   wand
   ; it seems likely that she was taught
   magic
   at home. Another possibility is that Merope disciplined herself to the extent to become self-taught. Merope seemed to be in charge of cooking and cleaning in her family home; it is unknown what happened to her mother.

   Thomas
   and
   Mary Riddle
   , who lived nearby. Her father was livid when Morfin revealed this to him in the summer of
   1925
   , and attacked her physically, but was restrained by
   Ministry
   official
   Bob Ogden
   . Ogden arrested both Marvolo and Morfin, who had

   Riddle because his sister found him attractive. With
   her family
   gone, Merope manipulated Riddle into marrying her. She left the shack with a
   farewell note
   revealing her marriage to Riddle, and her existence was never again mentioned by Marvolo.

   , upon learning of these events, speculated that she might have used the
   Imperius Curse
   or a love potion on Riddle, Dumbledore believed that she most likely used a love potion because it seemed more romantic. Dumbledore also speculated that she could administer the love potion to him while mixing it with water or some other beverage. In any case, Riddle became infatuated with her and they were
   married
   in late
   1925

   After a year of marriage, Merope Gaunt soon became pregnant and decided to release Riddle from his mental enslavement, having grown tired of living a lie. Dumbledore thought that she did this hoping either that
   her husband
   would have truly fallen in
   love
   with her by that point, or that he would at least stay for the sake of

   After her husband's sudden escape, Merope soon fell into a deep depression and lived as a pauper in London, selling her valuables to survive in order to gain some gold. Specifically, she sold her
   locket
   , a family heirloom which was one of her father’s most treasured ones, to Caractacus Burke for only ten

   , either not knowing that it was a priceless artefact, no longer caring, or a desire to sever ties with her abusive father and valuing the paltry profits much more than the painful reminder of her family. With her heart broken and her dreams in tatters, Merope stopped using
   magic
   altogether after Riddle's desertion, not even willing to raise her wand to save her own life (although, according to Dumbledore, it was also possible that her powers may have been sapped as a result of depression and also because of her unrequited love for Riddle).

   On the night of
   New Year's Eve
   in
   1926
   , she staggered up the front steps of an
   orphanage
   , ready to give birth to a son. She told
   Mrs Cole
   , a woman who worked in the orphanage, to name him
   Tom
   for his father,
   Marvolo
   for her father, and
   Riddle
   to be his surname. Mrs Cole believed Marvolo was a "funny name", and wondered whether Merope had come from a circus. Merope died without warning, within an hour, and her last words were a final wish that her son would turn out to look like his father, which Mrs Cole said that she was right to hope it since Merope was no beauty. It is unknown what happened to Merope’s body after her death.

   Years later, her own son would find it difficult to believe that she could ever have been a witch, as she succumbed to something as mortal as death; he was, however, forced to accept that she was indeed a witch once finding nothing of "Tom Riddle" in the history of Hogwarts. It seems she was too depressed to use magic after Riddle left her when the effects of her magic wore off on him.

  <p key="a6dbb999-96ee-4f38-9b96-41f6865ec68b">
   Her son would grow up believing his father married Merope of his own free will, only leaving her after discovering she was a witch. Although Merope had a choice, she chose death in spite of a son that needed her due to the utterly miserable existence to which she had been condemned. These circumstances caused even

   hypothesised that if Merope had hung on, and been there to express
   love
   and affection for her son, Voldemort might never have come to be. Nevertheless, Dumbledore and Harry did not resent her, as they understood that given her suffering and lack of inner strength, she could not in good conscience be blamed for her son's corruption. Her son, while contemptuous for her mortal weakness, did avenge her death by killing the elder Tom Riddle for abandoning both mother and son.

   Merope was physically and emotionally abused by her family, and as a result was timid and miserable for most of her life, traumatised to the point of being unable to perform magic well. She could perform magic, but having been terrified of her father and brother, lacked confidence; thus, her magic was haphazard at best. However, she grew bolder and happier once Marvolo and Morfin were sent to Azkaban and displayed enough cunning and magical skill to manipulate the man she was in love with into marrying her. By extension, she seems to have also been able to effectively manipulate her husband when he was under her control as to prevent him from becoming suspicious about the truth of their marriage and resisting her.

   She loved Tom Riddle Snr obsessively, given the lengths to which she went to obtain his affection and her morbid depression after he left. Even the responsibility of having a baby to look after was not enough to give Merope the will to live. Her obsession seemed to have grown into a desire for a genuine affectionate relationship as opposed to living a lie any further; she ceased her enslavement of Tom in hopes that he would have truly fallen in love with her, or at least remain for their unborn child. Her naivety proved to be her undoing, as Tom felt nothing for his captor, and fled to never return.

   Having lived a life where she had always been miserable, Merope had no hope left and could not find the courage to make her want to keep trying, even for the sake of her newborn son. This decision had a dramatically negative impact on her son's psyche. Despite this making Merope responsible for the creation of the most dangerous dark wizard of all time, both Albus Dumbledore and (reluctantly) Harry Potter sympathised with her upbringing and did not bear her a grudge for it, with Dumbledore stating one should not judge her too harshly, as she had been greatly weakened by long suffering which resulted in her choosing to die instead of staying alive for her son, and she never had the courage and inner-strength of

   One point as to why Merope may have chosen to seek out a Muggle location to give birth rather than to seek sanctuary with other witches/wizards may also have been influenced by the miserable life she had lived up to that point; it's likely that after everything that had happened, and now so traumatised to the point of being unable to perform magic, Merope came to view magic as having been the root of all her problems in life one way or another (her father's treatment of her her whole life, etc.), and that her choosing to go to a Muggle orphanage over Saint Mungo's, after she'd already gone into labour, may have been a final act of love on her part, wanting her unborn child as far from magical people as she could get.

   Merope's relationship with her father and brother was a violent one where they treated her more like a slave than family, and forced her to do all the housework. Her father, Marvolo, who placed the utmost importance on his heritage, tended to use words such as "squib" as putdowns and to make insinuations about blood status when as a form of insult. Marvolo became furious with Merope's infatuation with a

   leading to the involvement of authorities and a stint in prison. Morfin made fun of Merope's romantic feelings for
   Tom Riddle
   , and laughed while watching Marvolo abuse her.

  <p key="b79ce20a-c293-4f1f-9c04-95fea839b200">
   She was physically and emotionally abused by her family, and as a result was timid and miserable for most of her life, traumatised to the point of being unable to perform
   magic
   . Upon discovering that Merope was a

   , Marvolo went as far as to attempt to murder her in front of a Ministry official. She grew bolder and happier once
   Marvolo
   and
   Morfin
   were sent to
   Azkaban
   , and displayed enough cunning and magical skill to brew a
   Love Potion
   . However, Marvolo was shocked when he learned that Merope had left the house, despite never loving her to begin with, and never mentioned her name or existence ever again, and this was probably a shock that led to his death (or possibly due to Merope no longer feeding him, as he never learned to feed himself). Morfin then felt that Merope had betrayed him and Marvolo, for marrying that "filthy Muggle".

  <p key="4e0e9b11-b930-4667-84c3-062b33784a96">
   Despite a lifetime of abuse at the hands of her father, Merope did give her son her father's name as a middle name, showing she might have had lingering affections for her father, sentiments that were not reciprocated. An alternative explanation could be that Merope chose to name her son "Tom Marvolo Riddle" because she was likely reflecting on her life in her dying moments, and "Tom" and "Marvolo" were among the few male names that came to mind. This could be due to her Gaunt upbringing leaving her with very few men in her life to truly interact with aside from Marvolo and Morfin before her marriage.

   Dumbledore had theorised that Merope, who was deeply, truly in love with her
   husband
   , could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means, and made the choice to stop giving him the potion, convincing herself that he might have truly fallen in love with her of his own accord, or even if he had not, he would stay with her for their child's sake. This turned out to be a fatal mistake; Tom, feeling as if he'd woken up from a nightmare, immediately escaped Merope to never return, claiming he had been "hoodwinked" and "taken in". It was speculated among his neighbours that he had been tricked into thinking he was the father of her unborn child. Merope was heartbroken and devastated by this, to the point of losing the will to live, and later died shortly after giving birth to his son.

    Voldemort's mother's one-sided possessive desire for his father and Riddle only being with Merope due to magic can be contrasted with the mutual love of Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, both of whom were willing to do everything for the other's happiness instead of their own. Merope giving up on life when she lost control of Riddle Snr rather than live for the sake of her son is also contrasted with Lily giving her life to save Harry from Voldemort.
