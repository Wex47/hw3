   During the establishment of Hogwarts in the
   First millennium A.D.
   , Salazar Slytherin co-existed peacefully with the three other founders initially, but as time passed, he became increasingly adamant about his disapproal of the acceptance of Muggle-borns at Hogwarts. Disagreeing with the other Hogwarts founders about the matter, Slytherin left the school. According to legend, before he left, Slytherin created a secret chamber deep underground in
   <a href="Hogwarts Castle.html" key="89c59871-9c5a-4ce9-aea9-56708eaa3d6b" title="Hogwarts Castle">
    Hogwarts Castle
   </a>
   — known as the Chamber of Secrets.
  </p>
  <p key="6173d749-78a8-4ddb-afb8-b1205dda8526">
   That Chamber was home to a monster — a
   Basilisk
   — that was allegedly supposed to purge the school of all Muggle-borns. Only the Heir of Slytherin could open the Chamber of Secrets, through the use of Parseltongue. Over the centuries after Slytherin's death, many
   Headmasters
   conducted searches of the school to find the Chamber. None, however, were successful, and the Chamber was dismissed as a mere legend by many.
   Until it was opened years later.

   There was clear evidence that the Chamber had been opened more than once between its creation and the twentieth century. When it was first created, the Chamber was accessed through a concealed trapdoor and a series of

   tunnels. However, when Hogwarts’ plumbing became more elaborate in the eighteenth century, the entrance to the Chamber was threatened, and was located on the site of a
   proposed bathroom
   . The presence in school at the time of a student called
   Corvinus Gaunt
   — who was a direct descendant of Slytherin — explained how the simple trapdoor was secretly protected, so that those who knew how could still access the entrance to the Chamber even after the newfangled plumbing had been placed on top of it.

   Once in the Chamber, Harry met with the memory of Tom Riddle, which was preserved in the diary. A near-dead Ginny lay nearby, whose life force was slowly being drained. As Ginny grew weaker, Riddle grew stronger. Riddle then revealed that he was, in fact, Lord Voldemort (rearranging the letters of his name from
   <i key="6b69e2df-2037-49ed-98ca-35a25467c1be">
    "Tom Marvolo Riddle"

   ) and then summoned the Basilisk. Harry, after he knew that eye contact with the Basilisk would be fatal, ran from it, and was helped by the timely arrival of
   Fawkes
   , Dumbledore's
   Phoenix
   who clawed the Basilisk's eyes out, rendering it fully blind and no longer able to kill with its lethal stare.

   , which Fawkes had brought down to the Chamber. As Harry impaled the Basilisk, a fang stabbed into his arm in the process. Near death, Harry used the fang to stab the diary, which spurted out black blood like ink, and the memory of Riddle preserved in it was destroyed. That action also effectively destroyed the fragment of Voldemort's soul within it, as
   Basilisk venom
   was one of the substances that were capable of destroying Horcruxes. After the fight with the Basilisk, Fawkes's tears healed Harry's wound, and he, Ginny, Lockhart, and Ron were carried by Fawkes out of the Chamber.

   The Entrance to the Chamber was at a snake-engraved sink tap on the Second Floor Girls' Lavatory, where a ghost of a girl named Myrtle Warren, more commonly known as Moaning Myrtle was often found. A corridor may be entered by giving the command of:
   <i key="e5e58752-9fb3-49d2-95ab-0a73aa433d7f">
    "Open"
   </i>
   or
   <i key="2bba2f07-e1fb-4b50-8e4b-dc38c6de74d2">

   to a snake engraved on the entrance in Parseltongue.
  </p>
  <p key="ead7c6c1-428f-45b6-bb18-d2b0595d9cb1">
   The engraved snake was on a tap over one of the sinks. The snake twisted, which made the other snakes go back. According to Myrtle, the tap had never worked. A passage opened from the sink that lead to a corridor, which Harry and Ron opened in 1993 and 1998, respectively.

   This hidden passage behind the fixture was actually the works of
   Corvinus Gaunt
   's doing, as the proposal of the new girls' bathroom threatened to expose the original entrance — a concealed trapdoor and a series of magical tunnels — so he secretly ensured the passage would be adapted to the new washroom's creation without compromising its hidden nature, and that those who knew how could still access the Chamber.

   That corridor was a passageway that lead to the door of the Chamber. In the spring of 1993, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Gilderoy Lockhart found an old and shed Basilisk Skin while they travelled through the corridor. Lockhart accidentally caused a cave-in when he attempted to use Ron's
