   was a branch of
   magic
   and an ancient
   science
   concerned with the study of the composition, structure and magical properties of the four basic elements, as well as the
   transmutation
   of substances; it was thus intimately connected with
   potion
   -making,
   chemistry
   and
   transformation
   magic.
   Alchemy also concerned philosophy; one interpretation of alchemical literature, which was known to be dominated by mystical and metaphysical speculation, were that the study of Alchemy were symbolic of a spiritual journey, leading the alchemist from ignorance (base metal) to enlightenment (gold).

   persecution) led alchemists to borrow the terms and symbols of
   biblical
   and pagan mythology,
   astrology
   ,
   kabbalah
   and other esoteric fields. This marked a progress in alchemical research, as it allowed the exchange of ideas between alchemists. However, this also ended up making the plainest chemical recipe read like an abstruse magic incantation,
   probably confusing the learning and spreading of alchemy as a
   science

   The best known goals of the alchemists were the transformation of common metals into
   gold
   (a phenomenon called
   Chrysopoeia
   ) or
   silver
   , the creation of a
   Panacea
   , a remedy that would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely, and the discovery of a
   universal solvent
   .
   At least two of the three primary alchemical goals were achieved by the famed
   French
   alchemist

   Chrysopoeia

   Alchemists' greatest prestige came not from their trademark mystic and metaphysical speculation, but from their more mundane contributions to various chemical industries, such as ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of inks, dyes and cosmetics, ceramics and glass manufacture, preparation of extracts and liquors and the invention of gunpowder. The preparation of
   Aqua Vitæ
