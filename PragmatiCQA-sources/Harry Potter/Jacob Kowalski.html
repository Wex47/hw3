   , who lived at
   435
   Rivington Street
   in
   New York
   during the
   1920s
   .
   Jacob fought in the
   First World War
   .
   After returning home to the United States, he found work in a
   cannery
   , but dreamt of becoming a baker.
   On
   5 December
   1926
   , he went to
   Steen National Bank
   to apply for a loan of $2300,
   but was turned down.

   While at the bank he met
   Newt Scamander

    wizard
   </a>
   who stopped in
   New York City
   on his travels to find and document
   magical
   beasts
   .
   Through Newt he was exposed to the magical world, but had his memories wiped as was required by wizarding law.
  </p>
  <p key="7f11b784-a98b-4dc6-a873-cb49ae7eef34">
   Jacob would later go on to own a very successful bakery subconsciously inspired by his experiences with Newt Scamander's beasts and financed through silver from
   Occamy eggs
   provided by Scamander.
  </p>
  <p key="fd05cb36-32f2-4ff3-b753-e47ffaa959b3">
   It was later discovered that the memory modification largely didn't take and Jacob ended up back together with Queenie. Though the two were happy together, Queenie disagreed with Jacob's stance on his not wanting her to take a chance on him by breaking the law in marrying him. She bewitched him to make him want to be engaged to her, but the truth was revealed to him when they paid a visit to Newt Scamander. Following an argument with Queenie, he left with Scamander on another adventure, ultimately reuniting with Queenie, who had fallen under the influence of the philosophy of Gellert Grindelwald. While Queenie felt that Grindelwald's aims would allow the two of them to be together, Jacob was repulsed by Grindelwald, and watched sadly as Queenie joined with the Dark Wizard, leaving him behind.

    Meeting Newt Scamander

  </h4>
  <p key="30fc6ed8-aed8-45a0-8687-b20832830ac3">
   While visiting the
   Steen National Bank
   to secure a loan to set up his own bakery, Jacob met
   Newt Scamander
   when he arrived to find the
   Niffler
   that had escaped
   his suitcase
   . As Newt left suddenly to chase his Niffler, Jacob noticed that he accidentally left his
   Occamy egg
   behind. Before he could return it, Jacob was summoned to banker
   Gilbert Bingley
   's office. Jacob presented Bingley with his suitcase full of pastries, but Bingley questioned how Jacob would return the loan and pointed out that his proposed bakery would not produce the same revenue as a factory and thus rejected
   his application
   .
  </p>
  <p key="991cb48e-a112-4afd-a284-965d9dfa945d">
   As he left the office, Jacob noticed that the egg was about to hatch and called out to Newt, who pulled the egg, and Jacob accidentally, with a
   Summoning Charm
   and
   Disapparated
   them onto the stairwell near the bank vault. Just as Newt recaptured his Niffler, Bingley arrived at the vault and, seeing the pilfered deposit boxes, mistakenly assumed that Jacob was trying to rob the bank, and sounded the alarm. Newt quickly placed a
   Full Body-Bind Curse
   on Bingley and Disapparated himself and Jacob to the outside of the bank just as the guards arrived. Subsequently, Newt tried to
   Obliviate
   Jacob, but the No-Maj unknowingly grabbed Newt's briefcase, hit him with it, and fled.
  </p>
  <p key="d15209a4-4cf4-4c57-ab95-3c7e0a1a91ad">
   When Jacob returned to
   his apartment
   without a bank loan, his fiance Mildred left him.
   Shortly afterwards, Jacob placed the case down on his bed only to hear something protesting inside. As Jacob approached it, the lid opened and several magical creatures escaped, including a
   murtlap
   that attacked and bit Jacob. Following escaped
   billywigs
   , Newt and
   Tina Goldstein
   arrived at Jacob's apartment, finding it half destroyed and Jacob unwell due to a reaction to the Murtlap bite. Newt

   her place

  <p key="f0306ea9-5e48-4714-a9a8-f301667d3e40">
   At Tina's house, Jacob met
   Queenie Goldstein
   who made them dinner and
   strudel
   . He and Queenie instantly connected with each other. In the evening, he watched Newt walk down into his suitcase and followed him after Newt invited him in. He met Newt's collection of creatures and heard about how Newt hoped to care for them as they were rejected by the wizarding world. Jacob wandered through various landscapes as Newt did a headcount of each creature to see which he needed to find. Jacob found an
   <a href="Obscurus.html" key="109ec7aa-1ebd-4c77-98ab-9ba8a58b1541" title="Obscurus">
    Obscurus
   </a>
   which Newt described as a dark entity and advised Jacob not to touch it. They decided they needed to retrieve the missing
   Erumpent
   first and left the suitcase.
  </p>
  <p key="b3e30d30-7b8e-4932-9fd6-f06c796939a2">
   However, Newt soon found out that his Niffler had escaped again. As they passed by a jewellery store, Newt spotted his Niffler inside. While Newt furiously attempted to capture the Niffler, Jacob noticed that a latch on Newt's suitcase had popped off and by the time he sealed it, Newt and the Niffler fell through the store's glass window. Subsequently, they were confronted by a squad of
   policemen
   , who were puzzled by the sight of the Niffler. Jacob then directed their attention to a
   lion
   wandering right by them, giving him and Newt the opportunity to
   Disapparate
   away.

  <p key="9b600827-08f4-4ffb-a6ef-92b840b9a1ca">
   Passing an ostrich in
   Central Park
   , they soon discovered the cause of the loose animals: the Erumpent had broke into the
   Central Park Zoo
   , setting many of the animals free, in its search to mate with the zoo's hippopotamus. Newt provided Jacob with a helmet and vest to protect himself from the Erumpent and left the No-Maj to hold a vial of
   Erumpent musk

He caught up with Queenie and said that he loved her, but he knew that she would be arrested if they get married. His reluctance, and almost calling her crazy caused her to Disapparate, leaving him alone on the street. Devastated, he went back inside Newt's apartment to his friend packing after he found letter from Tina to Queenie.

     Jacob

    is derived from Late Latin Jacobus/Iacobus, from Greek Ἰάκωβος (
    <i key="af88c218-6d3f-4f85-bd55-3251fe2e81a3">

     Yaʿqob/Yaʿaqov/Yaʿăqōḇ
    </i>
    ). In the Abrahamic monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), Jacob, (in
    Christianity
    considered one of the Patriarchs) son of Isaac and Rebekah, was the third to have held a covenant with
    God
    , and was later named Israel (later the progenitor of the Twelve Tribes). His original name meant seizing by the/holder of the heel or supplanting/supplanter, which ties in with his pre-covenant life: in birth as having held his elder twin brother Esau's heel, as having persuaded Esau to give him the birthright of the eldest son, and as having his old almost-blind father bless him under the disguise of Esau. Jacob is also a cognate/reduced English form of the name James, the name of some of Jesus's disciples.

    Jacob's role in Newt's life (from inadvertently switching cases to being Newt's friend/assistant in helping him catch the former's escaped beasts) is reflected from the name's original Hebrew root עקב (

     ʿqb
    </i>

    In an interview, Fogler stated his character speaks with a historical
    Brooklyn accent
    , similar to that of early 20th-century comedian
    Lou Costello
    .
    He has likened the relationship between Jacob and Newt as being akin to that of Holmes and Watson, or Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.

    Since Jacob is identified as having been born around 1900 in
    (then-partitioned) Poland
    (Poles being the largest Slavic ethnic group in the USA, immigration dating back to the Colonial era
    predating
    the
    Pilgrims
    ), Jacob and/or his family must have immigrated in the latter years of 1870-1914 (the largest immigration wave, which most present
    Polish Americans
    are descended from), and as Poland never existed as an independent sovereign state (from 1795-
    1918
    ), the
    classified Poles (including Jacob and/or family) into either
    Russian
    ,
    German
    , or
    Austrian
    , depending on which partitioned territory the immigrant came from.
   </li>
   <li key="61c0ed3a-d3f1-474f-9d6b-27aa7d34f7d5">
    Jacob's connection with bread can be related to the 1870-1914 immigration wave, as immigrant Poles from this time period were called
    <i key="7989a0fe-94c3-46df-b911-59b971dd190b">
     za chlebem
    </i>
    (for bread) immigrants, because most were peasants in Poland who did not own land and lacked basic subsistence.
   </li>
   <li key="463a29d6-f12e-4108-9b0a-a6b8d9b935df">
    As Jacob mentioned participating in the
    Expeditionary Forces (1917-1919) in World War I
    , he would have been drafted through the amended
    Selective Service Act of 1917
    . Under the original Act enacted May 28 1917, all men aged between 21-31 were required to register for military service, and after Congress amended the Act in August 1918, the age range was widened to 18-45. Due to his birth date around 1900 most probably before August, Jacob must've been drafted after the 1918 amendment the 3rd registration held on September 12 1918, as he would've been ineligible underage under the original 1917 Act.
   </li>
   <li key="5be4d647-e2dc-4ba3-ab3a-4faa11cff057">
    It is worth noting that World War I motivated Polish Americans such as Jacob to vigorously contribute and/or support the War, with large numbers volunteering for or being drafted into the United States Army, working in war-related industries, and buying war bonds a common theme was to fight for America, defeat the Germans (who were one of the participants in the
    partitions of Poland
    , and for the restoration of Poland as a unified, independent nation.
   </li>
   <li key="0370a46f-6fdd-466b-bae7-13256c245712">
    His late return indicates that he would likely have been a member of the U.S. Third Army, which was created by General Pershing at the end of 1918 to perform occupation duties. Third Army was created from the Third and Fourth Army Corps which both took part in major combat operations at the end of the War from September to November of 1918. Despite his apparent desire to minimise his war experiences, it is most likely that Jacob was a combat veteran, having taken part in either the Battle of Saint-Mihiel or the bloody Meuse-Argonne offensive.
   </li>
   <li key="576cb37f-f057-4cf0-9524-8669f9d6f6e6">
    Although Jacob was born in Poland and emigrated to America, by the time he was in his mid-twenties he spoke with a heavy Brooklyn accent. As such, he likely immigrated when he was young child.

   <li key="18827275-720f-44a2-b61c-3ee4efa54d84">
    Quentin Kowalski
