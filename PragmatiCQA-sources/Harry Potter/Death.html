   It was also believed that death could manifest in physical forms. The
   Grim
   , which took in the form of a large black dog, was believed to be an omen of death, and even a cause of death to others, as some people who spotted it died 24 hours later while others believed it would haunt them until they finally died.

   Another manifestation of death was
   a mysterious hooded figure
   which the three
   Peverell brothers
   in
   The Tale of the Three Brothers
   allegedly encountered when crossing
   a road
   and then a river which was too treacherous to pass. This manifestation and embodiment of Death appeared treacherous and tricked the brothers into using the

   Antioch Peverell
   was murdered due to the lust created by the Elder Wand, and
   Cadmus Peverell
   committed suicide upon seeing the Resurrection Stone's limitations, but
   Ignotus Peverell

Some ghosts professed to regret their status: They knew nothing about the afterlife after they died. They thought that 'beyond' seemed like it would be a more natural and comfortable place for their soul to inhabit. Becoming a ghost was something of an aberration of the normal process of death, in which a body died, a soul left it, and moved 'on'.

   There were no accounts of non-magical forces bringing about the deaths of witches and wizards. Heart attacks, strokes, and cancer were unheard of. Lethal run-ins with water, deoxygenated air, crushing forces and the like also seemed not to happen without magical forces being involved. Most likely this had more to do with the innate rather than deliberately used powers of magical humans (for example, children without wands often did magic to protect themselves, like

   There were fascinating moral dimensions to the use of lethal force in wizarding. During the Second War, the forces of the resistance to Voldemort, in particular the Order of the Phoenix, sustained very heavy casualties, while relatively few Death Eaters died. This was partly because they faced death so much more willingly and fearlessly than their adversaries, and partly because they refused to use some of the greatest powers available to them (Dark Magic, in short), not because of the penalty in effect, but simply because to do so would be evil. While their deaths were tragic, in a sense they were also acts of nobility and

   In the Muggle world, certain countries also carried the death penalty, in which criminals of a certain severity was lawfully executed, which would not (in legal terms) be considered as murder or manslaughter. While no such system existed in the modern Britain magical community for wizard criminals, magical animals who were deemed a threat could face execution as well. The American magical community did carry the death penalty; violating the
   International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy
   was a crime that might be punishable by death, as many demanded
   Dorcus Twelvetrees
   to be executed, and
   Newton Scamander
   and
   Porpentina Goldstein

   Limbo
   was an afterlife-related plane that existed in-between the physical world and the true afterlife; its contents were apparently subjective. Living people and the dead rarely spent time there. When Harry visited limbo, he met Albus Dumbledore, who offered counsel and consoled him. But when Voldemort, his soul maimed and mutilated by "tampering so inadvisably" with such evil as Horcruxes and the Killing Curse, arrived in the afterlife, he was trapped in limbo, unable to go onward or go back.

   There was no known way to magically reunite a person's soul with his/her body once they had died.
   Many young witches and wizards discovered this through the story of
   Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump
   (in which the protagonist
   Babbitty
   was blackmailed by a
   charlatan
   to perform magic for
   a king
   , but did not bother raising her wand when the king tried to raise
   a dog
   from the dead.) During the six centuries that had elapsed since
   Beedle
   wrote the tale, innumerable ways had been devised to maintain the illusion of the continuing presence of one's loved ones. For example, wizarding photographs and portraits moved and (in the case of the latter) talked just like their subjects.

   Despite this, wizards had still not found a way of reuniting body and soul once death had occurred. This subject was covered by eminent wizarding philosopher
   Bertrand de Pensées-Profondes
   in his celebrated work

    A Study into the Possibility of Reversing the Actual and Metaphysical Effects of Natural Death, with Particular Regard to the Reintergration of Essence and Matter

  <p key="eada59a4-070f-40d7-b48b-7e442c02944b">
   However, while there existed no known method of reversing death once it had occurred, there were certain things a witch or wizard could do to postpone their death or prolong their life (even further than the longevity which would seem to be granted by magical ability e.g. Albus Dumbledore's health despite his advanced age).

  <p key="0dcaf20b-e8f6-4e96-a9de-88b1455905dd">

   However, because the only known Philosopher's Stone in existence at the time was destroyed in
   1992
   , this method was not currently available.
   Unicorn blood
   could keep alive a person who was near death, but

  <p key="f5857ce7-6231-4c8c-aac5-63a19415f963">
   A wizard or witch who ripped their soul through an act of murder could place that torn fragment inside of an external object called a
   <a href="Horcrux.html" key="315cca94-5a6b-46e6-a9cb-246bf23169c0" title="Horcrux">
    Horcrux
   </a>
   .
   By binding a part of the soul to the earth, the Horcrux prevented the wizard or witch from dying, even if the body was injured or completely destroyed.
   However, there was a cost to using Horcruxes — as shown in the deterioration of Lord Voldemort's physical condition after repeatedly splitting his soul, as well as the mangled spectral state he had been trapped in during the destruction of his physical body. There was a
   potion
   which enabled the Horcrux-creator's body to be reconstructed in the latter scenario.
   Overall, however, many wizards and witches would prefer death over such a pitiful state of existence. It seemed if this potion was used, and the wizard was returned to a resurrected body, they seemed to be unable to die until all of the Horcruxes were destroyed, as shown with Lord Voldemort during the final battle of Hogwarts, as only when all of his Horcruxes were destroyed was he killed. The creation of Horcruxes damaged the soul in such a way that if the user died after all their anchors were destroyed, then the soul would remain trapped in
   limbo
   in a terrible state, never to return as a ghost nor move on.

   for suffering what he regards as a weakness; even discovering she was a witch did not alter his perception of her mortality. Albus Dumbledore saw Voldemort's fear of death as his greatest weakness, as there were fates worse than death, and that anyone who could truly understand that and accept the inevitability of death could be considered to be a true "
   Master of Death
   ". On the other hand, some people who believed in the existence of the

   mentioned, the existence in a spectral state of a wizard who created a Horcrux would be a fate that very few would desire, and that death was a preferable alternative to such.
