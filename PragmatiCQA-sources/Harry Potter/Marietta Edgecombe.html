   Dumbledore's Army
   at the urging of her best friend
   Cho Chang
   , an organisation taught and led by

   When she became afraid that her
   mother's
   job at the
   Ministry of Magic
   might be threatened by her membership in the organisation, Marietta betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge. This activated a
   jinx that caused boils to erupt on Marietta's face
   , and a
   Memory Charm
   was later placed on her by
   Kingsley Shacklebolt
   to prevent her from fully incriminating her fellow D.A. members.

   Cho considered her a true friend because of this loyalty. However, Marietta was forbidden by her parents to go against the Ministry during the summer of that year, as the Ministry had denied Harry and

  </h3>
  <p key="634f94a0-fcfd-427b-8e6a-b5247447bf1c">
   During the 1995-1996 school year, Marietta was persuaded to attend the first meeting of what would become Dumbledore's Army in the
   Hog's Head
   pub in
   Hogsmeade
   by Cho, despite her obvious suspicion of Harry's intentions as well as his claims that
   <a href="Tom Riddle.html" key="3f2aec61-dbea-4d4f-993c-c5daddeda155" title="Tom Riddle">
    Lord Voldemort
   </a>
   had
   returned
   . She gave Harry a thoroughly distrustful look to tell him that, given her way, she would not be there and slopped
   Butterbeer
   down herself with a shriek when the name "Voldemort" was said. She also gave Cho a disapproving look for signing the
   piece of parchment
   drawn up by
   <a href="Hermione Granger.html" key="291c554d-f1a7-40af-aab5-29bf78d24de6" title="Hermione Granger">
    Hermione Granger
   </a>
   for all members to sign and only added her name reluctantly.
  </p>
  <p key="2852d687-097f-4712-aa13-eb1808512d0f">
   Despite Harry's extremely effective teaching methods, Marietta did not seem to enjoy the lessons, especially during the first lesson when Cho accidentally set her sleeve on fire, and continued to resent Harry, seeing both him and Dumbledore as liars and nutters. She acted disrespectfully to Harry, behaviour which Cho told him to ignore. Her membership in the D.A. became particularly difficult as it increasingly came into conflict with
   Hogwarts High Inquisitor
   Dolores Umbridge, who was at Hogwarts as the representative of the
   Ministry of Magic
   where Marietta's mother worked. Even after the
   Death Eaters
   '
   mass breakout
   of
   Azkaban
   and Harry's subsequent interview was published in
   <i key="12e8f495-b945-439b-835e-c342d88a693b">
    The Quibbler
   </i>
   , Marietta continued to distrust Harry.
  </p>
  <p key="ad34e012-1fc4-4037-975f-83738dae29be">
   After six months of the meetings, and from the pressure regarding her mother's career, Marietta finally betrayed Dumbledore's Army to the Ministry. After dinner, while the rest of Dumbledore's Army was learning how to cast a
   Patronus
   , Marietta instead went to Umbridge's
   office
   and gave her an advantageous hint about the
   Room of Requirement
   . With a little further questioning from Umbridge, Marietta confessed that a meeting was taking place there. Right after that, Marietta came to regret her decision, as the parchment she and the other members of the D.A. had signed at the first meeting was
   jinxed
   , making anyone who betrayed the organisation break out in pimples that spelt the word "SNEAK" across their face. Upon catching her face in Umbridge's mirror, Marietta covered her face with shame.
  </p>
  <p key="dc0ff229-0050-4784-b4ab-954bac9cd612">
   As Marietta could not be persuaded to uncover her face (which muffled her voice), she was unable to verbally confess everything to
   Cornelius Fudge
   . As such, Umbridge simply asked her and told her to nod. However, just before she was to confess all to Umbridge,
   Kingsley Shacklebolt
   , an
   Auror
   and a secret member of the
   <a href="Order of the Phoenix.html" key="846ba5dc-082c-42e2-8799-382608d33863" title="Order of the Phoenix">
    Order of the Phoenix
   </a>
   , took advantage of Marietta's silent shame to perform a
   Memory Charm
   on her so that she could not implicate Albus Dumbledore and Harry. The sudden change in her testimony angered Umbridge so much that the professor began shaking her violently and only stopped when Dumbledore pointed
   his wand
   at her in anger and caused Edgecombe to
   emit a forcible charge
   .
  </p>
  <p key="095a75fb-7758-463c-9fa9-6d5a80d2f255">
   After Dumbledore took the blame of the organisation's formation, Marietta was one of the few people who witnessed the fierce battle between Fudge's brigade and Dumbledore in the
   Headmaster's office
   . However, as she went to the
   Hospital Wing
   to clear up the blemishes, she was unable to give anyone a full account. Throughout her stay there,
   <a href="Poppy Pomfrey.html" key="6dbb015c-5558-42ee-b8bc-2e49f65a6de3" title="Poppy Pomfrey">
    Madam Pomfrey
   </a>
   was unable to make the slightest change in the jinx. Cho was upset for her friend and defended her to Harry, saying Marietta merely made a mistake and called Hermione's jinx a
   <i key="a209471c-2b51-4510-a526-63f140228b3a">
    "horrible trick"
   </i>
   whilst trying to persuade Harry to forgive Marietta. Harry, however, considered Marietta a traitor and her informing the ruining of the D.A., to which he replied that the jinx was a
   <i key="16d72839-0367-43e0-94e2-90c20482bd33">
    "brilliant idea"
   </i>
   . After this row, their relationship fell apart.
  </p>
  <p key="d36985bf-39dc-4f6e-8000-2cb5dfb54c43">
   At the end of the year, Marietta was seen wearing a balaclava to cover her disfigured face, accompanying Cho on the
   <a href="Hogwarts Express.html" key="94b3be8c-2306-4b04-a7d0-79b59dad633c" title="Hogwarts Express">

  </h3>
  <p key="0fff7a0e-124f-487f-aac1-8932f2f1c771">
   Marietta still had blemishes on her face from the jinx the
   following school year
   , and took to wearing thick make-up to try to cover them up, with limited success. She sat with
   Cho
   on the

   to Hogwarts. They saw Harry during this journey, but did not speak to him and looked away when he walked past them on the train.
   The formation of the pimples on her face would eventually fade, leaving a few scars behind.

   Marietta was described as having curly, reddish-blonde hair.
   After she was struck with the parchment jinx for betraying the D.A., she bore pimples spelling "

   When Cho became depressed over Cedric's death, Marietta was presumably comforting and supportive, being the only one to remain with her when the other friends left irresponsibly. Cho claimed Marietta was a lovely person, an attribute that was mostly unseen in her behaviour to others.

   However, Marietta was one of the many people who were loyal to the Ministry of Magic and was sceptical of Harry Potter's statement of Lord Voldemort
   returning
   . She thought that he and Albus Dumbledore were liars and remained cynical towards him throughout her time in the D.A., and would not be swayed by the genuine article within

   about Voldemort's return; she only joined because Cho wanted her to. As with the majority of the

   , Marietta feared to hear the name "Voldemort", as she shrieked aloud and slopped Butterbeer down her front.
  </p>
  <p key="507ce284-40f8-4e89-854c-a7917c7afbb8">
   Marietta's mother was a Ministry employee and as such, Marietta felt strong pressure to be on Dolores Umbridge's good side. Her apparent faithfulness to Cho Chang diminished when Cho forced her to join an illegal organisation, and she eventually betrayed Dumbledore's Army meaning her classmates (including Cho) who were in the organisation were almost expelled from school. Even if it meant that she would forsake a chance to learn more practical defence, especially the
   Patronus Charm
   that others were so eager to learn, Marietta chose her family's loyalty first. While Cho insisted that Marietta simply made a mistake, Harry Potter felt that Marietta was disgraceful and an unforgivable traitor. Hermione commented that she was "stupid".
  </p>
  <p key="93e55a69-235a-4bf4-9ea5-0f4c8553504a">
   When her face was horribly disfigured for her betrayal against Dumbledore's Army, she became extremely embarrassed and refused to uncover her face to testify verbally, leading to some setbacks for Umbridge and Fudge that ultimately gave Kingsley a chance to modify her memory. Because of the jinx scarring her face, she took great measures to cover her disfigured face, and even became anxious in the presence of Harry Potter afterwards, implying she may have felt some guilt over her treacherous behaviours, but lacked the courage to apologise to him.
  </p>
  <p key="0c94f338-6c2e-4df6-8cc7-4700497a58a1">
   She was shown to be a poor judge of character, as she did not believe Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore's story, instead believing the Ministry's

   . She was also very critical and insolent towards Harry during their DA meetings, implying she was rather impolite and unpleasant in nature.

   Marietta's mother worked for the Ministry, and therefore, Marietta herself was loyal to it; her parents forbade her from getting onto the Ministry's bad side during her school year. She feared that any bad impressions left on Dolores Umbridge, a Ministry representative at Hogwarts, would injure her mother's reputation at the office, and therefore refused to get on Umbridge's bad side.

   's death, Marietta is the only one who remained with her. This means that while the others only followed Cho for her popularity, Marietta is indeed loyal and true. However, when Cho brought Marietta to Dumbledore's Army against her will, Marietta's loyalty for Cho faded rapidly, and eventually betrayed her and the entire group, and was willing to have even her best friend expelled for being part of
   an illegal organisation

   printing out Harry's version of the story, Marietta continued to believe that Harry was an unstable lunatic, and distrusted him, an attitude that Harry ignored at Cho's behest. After Marietta betrayed the organisation and suffered a horrible jinx as a result which disfigured her face, Harry felt no sympathy for her despite her mother's position, and he insulted her, leading to the ultimate breakup between him and Cho when she defended Marietta. When hearing that Marietta could not remove the pustules inflicted by her treason, Harry saw it as just desserts, and reflected that Hermione was brilliant to have jinxed the list, later sneering at Marietta's limited success in hiding her marks the following year. She refused to face Harry on the Hogwarts Express journey home at the end of her final year, implying she felt some guilt for betraying him, but she was also likely too afraid to confront or apologise to him.
  </p>
  <p key="aae09c30-ba1b-4907-abee-36dadbd94ed9">
   Later on in his life, Harry stated that he had grown to understand that Marietta's reasoning for turning them in was simply that she had been afraid and that fear was a powerful motivator. However, despite this, he claimed that this motivation didn't excuse her actions, showing that he still hated her even years after the fact.

   Cho forced Marietta to attend the illegal organisation, Dumbledore's Army, against her will, despite it being a great potential of ruining her mother's reputation at the Ministry. None of the members seemed to care too much about Marietta's cynical behaviour against their formation, until she betrayed them to Umbridge, nearly expelling them all. Once that happened, they considered her a traitor and felt that many of the following events were her fault; Hermione referred to Marietta as "stupid" while Ron thought up of a large number of insults when Harry brought up the subject. Also, this betrayal led to the split between Harry and Cho, Cho being the only member to stand up for Marietta.

  <p key="b00c82bc-cb60-4a4a-a573-f624941e6a88">
   Marietta, being the daughter of a Ministry employee, Madam Edgecombe, was adamant in not doing anything that may go against Umbridge, who was a high-ranking Ministry official assigned to Hogwarts as a teacher and inspector, fearing that doing anything that seemed rebellious may damage her mother's reputation and standing within the government. As such, Marietta was very reluctant in joining the illegal Dumbledore's Army.
  </p>
  <p key="2ef9c7c1-ed9f-4c19-bae5-5c3e083f2890">
   Eventually, her loyalty to her mother and Umbridge overwhelmed that to Cho, and Marietta betrayed DA's whereabouts to the High Inquisitor. Umbridge, desperate in getting more information in expelling Potter, put up a falsified sweet side to coax Marietta, who was too ashamed to show her face when Hermione's jinx disfigured it, to reveal more to Cornelius Fudge. When Kingsley Shacklebolt secretly modified Marietta's memories to contradict what Umbridge was made to believe earlier, Umbridge lost her temper at this change of testimony, and even violently shook the girl until Dumbledore threatened her. It was then that Umbridge deemed Marietta untrustworthy.

   , who was also highly revered within the wizarding community. However, when the Ministry campaigned against Dumbledore and Potter, Marietta, out of loyalty for her family, believed the Ministry over Dumbledore. Even after Harry's interview in the Quibbler, Marietta refused to believe either of them and continued to think of them as nutters and liars, and ultimately betrayed Harry and Dumbledore's Army. Despite this distrust and betrayal, Dumbledore seemed to hold no grudge against Marietta and even defended her from Umbridge's assault, meaning he likely sympathised with her.
