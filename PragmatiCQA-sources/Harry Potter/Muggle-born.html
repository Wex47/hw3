   , argued that the school should only admit pure-bloods as students, as
   Durmstrang Institute
   did. Slytherin's views were considered unusual at the time. Most wizards of his era not only accepted Muggle-borns but actually considered them especially gifted, and referred to them by the affectionate term "
   Magbobs
   ".
   The other three founders of Hogwarts favoured admitting all witches and wizards as students and opposed Slytherin on this point.

  <p key="879a1651-a2da-4906-be00-133946a9bc26">
   As a result of the disagreement, Slytherin left the school. Before leaving, he created the
   Chamber of Secrets
   , hoping that his true heir would one day release the Basilisk out of the Chamber and kill wizards and witches he thought didn't deserve to have access to magic (particularly Muggle-borns). About one thousand years later,

   When Voldemort seized control of the
   British Ministry of Magic
   in 1997, Muggle-borns were required to register with the
   Muggle-Born Registration Commission
   . Political propaganda claimed that Muggle-borns were really Muggles who had stolen magic from "real" witches and wizards, supported by research supposedly carried out by the
   Department of Mysteries
   . The Ministry continued to promote the belief with the distribution of agitprop such as the pamphlet
   <i key="afceab39-c065-48a5-bb9d-b872bd4e24d5">

   This led some Muggle-borns, such as

   However, Slughorn generally expected his more talented students to be

   This may indicate that even among those who did not believe Muggle-borns were inherently inferior or "

   It was a widely held belief in the wizarding world that Muggle-borns were more likely to produce Squib children and slower to show signs of magic in childhood than pure or half-blood wizards. These stereotypes were disproven by the
   Institute of Muggle Studies
   , though they also disproved the positive beliefs that Muggle-borns have greater immunity to wizarding illnesses and a natural sense of rhythm.
