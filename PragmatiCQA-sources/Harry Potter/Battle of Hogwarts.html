   final Horcruxes

   Death Eater
   and dark creature that had ever pledged loyalty to him to launch a massive attack on the school.
   Dumbledore's Army
   then communicated the need to fight to the
   Order of the Phoenix
   and their other allies within the
   British Ministry of Magic
   , leading to a large-scale battle. Voldemort led his forces from the
   Shrieking Shack
   in Hogsmeade; while Harry Potter,

   and

   The battle ended with a decisive victory for the Order and the D.A., with many Death Eaters killed or captured and Voldemort himself dead. It was the most devastating battle of the war, with casualties including:

   infiltrating the Ministry

   Furthermore, the day before the battle, the trio succeeded in
   breaking into
   the
   vault
   belonging to
   Bellatrix Lestrange
   within Gringotts in Diagon Alley to obtain Helga

   Two other Horcruxes had also been destroyed prior to Dumbledore's death:

   apparated
   into the main street of
   Hogsmeade
   . However, they immediately triggered a
   Caterwauling Charm
   , and a dozen cloaked and hooded
   Death Eaters
   dashed into the street from the
   Three Broomsticks
   . One of the Death Eaters tried to
   summon
   the Cloak, but the Summoning Charm did not work on it because it was secretly the cloak of legend, one of the fabled
   Deathly Hallows
   .
  </p>
  <p key="010df0f5-0e33-48dc-b5de-77a03278381a">
   Harry, Ron, and Hermione backed quickly down the nearest side street. Harry informed the others that the Death Eaters must have set up the Caterwauling Charm to alert them to the trio's presence, and they likely had done something to trap them there. At that moment, one Death Eater suggested releasing the
   Dementors
   , pointing out that the Dementors wouldn't kill Harry. Voldemort wanted Harry's life, not his soul, and he would be easier to kill if he had been subjected by the
   Dementor's Kiss
   first.

  <p key="a53a766d-92e8-48e3-a5f9-50ef040a1543">
   Hermione suggested that they
   disapparate
   , but as they tried, the air through which they needed to move seemed to become solid. They could not Disapparate due to an
   Anti-Disapparation Jinx
   placed by the Death Eaters. Ten or more Dementors closed in on them, and Harry raised his wand to cast a Patronus, causing the silver
   stag
   to burst from his wand and charge. The Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from the Death Eaters.
  </p>
  <p key="a6c3a710-0667-42ce-aaa3-5c214854ab8e">
   Suddenly, a door near the trio opened and the three of them were hustled inside the
   Hog's Head Inn
   . They ran up the stairs into a room with a single large oil painting of a blonde girl. Outside, the inn's proprietor pulled out his wand and cast a
   goat
   Patronus
   ; he insisted that the Death Eaters had mistaken his Patronus for a stag and that he had set off the alarm when he let out his cat. Reluctantly convinced, the Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street. Hermione came out from under the Cloak and sat down on a chair. Harry drew the curtains shut, then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the man down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.

   Harry's attention was caught by
   Sirius Black
   's half of his
   two-way mirror
   on the mantelpiece. He realised it was the man's eye he had been seeing in the mirror, and that this must mean that the man had sent
   Dobby
   to rescue them during the
   Skirmish at Malfoy Manor
   . From his resemblance to his late brother, Harry deduced that the man was Aberforth Dumbledore: the younger brother of the late
   <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="17e5d4b9-f398-4c8e-82d8-abbacfffc617" title="Albus Dumbledore">

  <p key="a52eaac0-f65f-49f9-8615-75e6263adb2a">
   Realising that the trio was hungry, Aberforth went out of the room and reappeared with bread, cheese, and a pewter jug of mead. Aberforth told them to wait for daybreak when the curfew would lift. Then they could get out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and disapparate. Harry, however, refused and claimed that they needed to get into Hogwarts to complete the task Albus Dumbledore set them. Aberforth said that people had a habit of getting hurt when Albus was carrying out his grand plans.
  </p>
  <p key="f3bc8c47-e278-4e51-9ade-3d5181bf2cd5">
   Aberforth told the young wizards to get away from the school, out of the country if they could; forget Dumbledore and his clever schemes. Harry pointed out that Aberforth was fighting as well, as he was part of the
   Order of the Phoenix
   , but Aberforth retorted that the Order was finished, that Voldemort had won, and that those still left serving in the Order fought a lost cause. Aberforth then said that Dumbledore was a natural at secrets and lies, a trait he learned from their father, Percival Dumbledore. Hermione timidly asked if the picture on the mantelpiece was of his sister,
   Ariana Dumbledore
   , and Aberforth confirmed this.
  </p>
  <p key="92d960d4-9dde-461b-93ca-384b57ed3249">
   Hermione said that Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much, but Aberforth said that many of the people his brother genuinely cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he had left them alone. When Hermione asked if Aberforth was talking about his sister, he burst into speech. He told them that when Ariana was six years old, the Dumbledore Family lived in Godric's Hollow; and  she was attacked by three
   <a href="Non-magic people.html" key="ab8ae70b-1f27-4f53-8023-742877111bb6" title="Non-magic people">
    Muggle
   </a>
   teenage boys, who tried to forcibly rape her; and that afterwards her magic turned inward and drove her mad, exploding out of her because she couldn't control it. Aberforth revealed this to his father Percival, who furiously went after the boys that harmed his daughter, attacking them all with the Cruciatus Curse; and was locked up in
   Azkaban
   for it by the Ministry of Magic, when the family's neighbour Bathilda Bagshot witnessed the event and alerted the Ministry.
  </p>
  <p key="72f1f199-1dfc-4df5-8dfa-1fe103768d36">
   The rest of the family was moved out by Aberforth's mother, Kendra Dumbledore, and Percival died in Azkaban. Albus was often too busy for Ariana, so she liked Aberforth best. Aberforth could get her to eat when she refused, and he could calm her down when she was in one of her mental rages. Then, when Ariana was fourteen, she accidentally killed her mother. Kendra's death resulted in Albus having to put aside his dreams and settle down as head of the family.
  </p>
  <p key="c8800c6d-b828-49ce-8815-5c0fbe174ba7">
   Aberforth said Albus did all right for a few weeks- until
   Gellert Grindelwald
   , Bathilda Bagshot's nephew, arrived. Here was someone almost as bright and talented as Albus was; and so Albus and Gellert instantly became best friends; in particular, due to their shared obsession for magical equality concerning wizards and muggles. Ariana was neglected as the two of them planned a new secret wizarding order, wanting to end the International Statute Of Wizarding Secrecy and create a global monarchy where both worlds' lived together in permanent harmony. After a few weeks of this, Aberforth confronted the two of them about their treatment of his sister, which made Grindelwald angry. There was an argument, and Grindelwald subjected Aberforth to the
   Cruciatus Curse
   . Albus tried to stop Grindelwald, and the three boys began to duel fiercely. When the curses stopped, Ariana lay dead by an unknown hand.
  </p>
  <p key="30f8d1da-e573-41c6-944b-f7a0c34beba1">
   Aberforth then again told Harry to hide, but Harry knew that in war, sometimes you have to think about the greater good. Harry told Aberforth that Albus had taught him how to finish You-Know-Who, and he was going to keep going until he succeeded, or died. He also told Aberforth that no matter what Albus had done or been in the past, he wasn't that during the time Harry knew him. Harry said he wasn't interested in what happened between Albus and Aberforth, that he loved Albus with all his heart and spirit, and he also berated Aberforth for abandoning hope when it was most needed. Rejuvenated and inspired by Harry's bravery, Aberforth approached the portrait of Ariana and said "
   <i key="065ba25f-0acc-4cf5-8e5a-924865396f44">
    You know what to do
   </i>
   ." She smiled and walked along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. Aberforth said that there was only one safe way into Hogwarts left that was unknown to the Death Eaters.
  </p>
  <p key="92bf65e1-c15d-4653-84f9-b0bd117af67d">
   A tiny white dot suddenly appeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came, with somebody else limping along beside her. The two figures grew larger until the painting swung forward on the wall like a door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. Out of the tunnel and onto the mantelpiece came a badly bruised and beaten

   Neville had informed a number of them that it was time to return to
   Hogwarts
   to fight and help Harry find whatever it was that he needed. When Harry realised how loyal they were being to him, he accepted help, telling them that Voldemort was on his way to Hogwarts and that he, Harry, needed to find something in the castle. When he asked about artefacts associated with
   Rowena Ravenclaw
   , Harry was told about her lost diadem, and he decided that it was almost certainly what Voldemort would have used for his Horcrux.

Infuriated that Crabbe had actually attempted murder, Harry fired a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who inadvertently knocked Malfoy's wand out of his hand before firing a second Killing Curse at Ron, who pursued in rage while Goyle was Disarmed by Harry and Stunned by Hermione. Attempting to destroy them, Crabbe unleashed

Harry spotted some old broomsticks and in order to escape from the conflagration, mounted them to escape. As they left, though, Harry saw Malfoy and the still unconscious Goyle and rescued them. He then saw the diadem being thrown about by the Fiendfyre and grabbed it as well, then he made for the door. They narrowly missed being killed by the inferno, and upon getting out of the room they collapsed on the hallway floor. As they flew out into the corridor, the door slammed shut behind them and vanished. Now landed, Harry watched as the diadem emitted a thin shriek and then fell apart in his hand. Hermione then mentioned that Fiendfyre was one of the few things capable of destroying

As Harry and Hermione struggled through the rubble to see what happened, they realised with horror that Fred was dead.

Before they came to an arrangement, the tapestry on the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open by two masked Death Eaters. Hermione shouted
   Glisseo

   Hardening Charm

   The trio sprinted to the
   Whomping Willow

Panting and gasping over their sprint, the trio reached the tree and tried to find the single knot in the back that would paralyse the branches. Ron wondered where Crookshanks was when they could have used his help but Hermione reminded him that he is a wizard. So he used a
   Levitation Charm
   to cause a twig to fly up and jab the place near the roots, stopping the writhing branches instantly. Though Harry had second thoughts about leading Ron and Hermione exactly where Voldemort expected him to go, he realised that the only way forward was to kill the snake, the trio crawled along the underground secret passage that led to the

Harry saw through the tiny gap between the crate and wall Nagini, swirling and coiling in her protective, floating enchanted sphere, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand.

   Snape, inches away from where Harry crouched, hidden, told Voldemort that the castle's resistance was crumbling, and Voldemort told Snape that there was no need for Snape to return to the fray. Snape offered to bring Potter to Voldemort in the Shrieking Shack, but Voldemort declined, changing the subject by saying that the Elder Wand has only performed his usual magic, that it had not revealed the legendary and extraordinary powers it was said to possess. Snape then begged Voldemort to let him return to the battle and find Potter, but Voldemort declined again, saying that the boy would come to him, as he would hate watching his friends die for him when handing himself over was the only way to stop it. Voldemort said his instructions to his Death Eaters had been perfectly clear: capture Potter alive. While they could kill as many of his friends as they wanted, they must not kill the boy.
  </p>
  <p key="20cdcfe6-2951-4531-901e-086366341e33">
   Snape protested, wishing to return and bring Voldemort the boy, but Voldemort angrily declined once again and asked Snape why both wands he used,
   his own
   wand and
   Lucius Malfoy's wand
   , failed when ordered to kill Harry. Voldemort told Snape that after both of the wands failed he sought the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, Wand of Destiny; he took it from the
   grave of Albus Dumbledore
   . Snape pleaded again to go to the boy, but Voldemort ignored him and told Snape that he had been wondering why the Elder Wand refused to be what it ought to be, and that believed he now had the answer.

  <p key="6f01a8c8-5d71-4ede-b591-644f49a8a65b">
   Voldemort told Snape that he had been a valuable and faithful servant and that he regretted what he had to do. Voldemort told Snape that the Elder Wand could not serve him properly because he was not the wand's true master, that the wand belonged to the wizard who killed its last owner. Mistakenly believing Snape to have won the wand's allegiance upon killing

  <p key="aac0dc54-58a1-4fd3-b2fb-fbd6ed761991">
   Snape tried to explain the situation, but Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand before he could finish, and Nagini's cage began to roll through the air. Snape yelled as the
   protective sphere
   encased his head and shoulders. With no remorse, Voldemort ordered Nagini to kill Snape in
   Parseltongue
   . Snape screamed while Nagini's fangs pierced his neck. Believing that the wand would now truly do his full bidding, he pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake and caused it to drift upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor with blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Without a backward glance, Voldemort swept from the room with the great serpent floating after him in its large protective sphere.
  </p>
  <p key="ef6755a4-8ff1-407b-b83b-d31476ffad9a">
   After Voldemort left the shack with Nagini, Harry pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view, making it lift an inch into the air and drift sideways. Harry entered the room, not knowing why he was approaching the dying man, not knowing what to feel as he saw Snape's white face and as Snape tried to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked at the man who he hated, and Snape's black eyes widened upon seeing Harry and tried to speak. As Harry bent over him, Snape seized the front of Harry's robes and pulled him close.

  <p key="cb049dac-2b86-4c77-8605-00134c38d17d">
   Snape, barely alive, told Harry to "Take it", and as he did so, silvery-blue wisps, neither gas nor liquid, were gushing from his mouth, ears, and eyes. Hermione conjured a crystal flask out of thin air, and Harry lifted the silvery substance into the flask with his wand. When the flask was full, Snape's grip on Harry's robes slackened and he asked to look into Harry's green eyes. Harry's green eyes looked into Snape's black eyes for a moment, before something in Snape's eyes vanished, the hand holding Harry's robes fell to the floor, and Snape's life ebbed away.

Petunia called Lily a freak for being a witch, and Lily retorted that Petunia had not thought so when she wrote to Professor Dumbledore, asking for admission to attend Hogwarts. An embarrassed Petunia realised that Lily and Snape went through her room and read her letter. She proceeded to insult them and they parted on bad terms and stayed on bad terms.

   Mudblood

   Gryffindor Tower

Despite his deep, desperate apologies, the angry Lily is fed up with Snape and will not forgive him, and disapproves of him having friends with Death Eater ambitions. She leaves him and the scene dissolves.

   Harry then learnt that Snape had revealed
   the prophecy
   made by
   Sybill Trelawney
   (not knowing, at first, that it was referring to Lily and her family) to Voldemort, prompting the Dark Lord to attack the Potters in an attempt to prevent its fulfilment. Though he asked Voldemort to spare Lily, Snape, still fearing for her safety, went to Dumbledore and begged him to protect the Potters. Dumbledore agreed and ensured that they were placed under the
   Fidelius Charm
   . In return, Snape became a re-doubled agent for the
   Order of the Phoenix

Snape wished he were dead with Lily, and Dumbledore told him that if he truly loved Lily, he would help protect Harry when Voldemort returned. Snape reluctantly agreed, making Dumbledore promise never to tell anyone that he was protecting James Potter's son, ever.

   In Snape's memories, Harry found that Snape, always loyal to Dumbledore because of a promise he had made out of his unrequited
   love
   for Harry's mother, had been playing a dangerous double game, protecting Harry and feeding Dumbledore information from the Death Eaters while pretending to be Voldemort's most loyal lieutenant all his life by feeding information to Voldemort that Dumbledore instructed him to. Snape demanded of Dumbledore, however, that his deep love for Lily (his reason for switching sides) be kept a secret. Dumbledore agreed and he kept the secret for the rest of his life.

  <p key="6dc0c30e-3a1b-4294-8a81-385fd55ed947">
   Snape's memories then revealed that Dumbledore had been afflicted by a
   powerful curse
   cast on
   Marvolo Gaunt's ring
   , one of Voldemort's
   Horcruxes
   , prior to the start of Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts. Although Snape's knowledge of the
   Dark Arts
   enabled him to slow the spread of the curse, the curse would have ultimately killed Dumbledore within a year. Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even asking about the impact of such an action on his own soul, Dumbledore implied that this kind of coup de grâce would not damage a human's
   soul
   in the same way murder would; mercifully ending a life is different. Snape eventually agreed to do as the Headmaster requested and a plan was formed.
  </p>
  <p key="1e2a7bca-9266-4923-b699-d21bdd95a58b">
   The memory showed Albus Dumbledore telling Snape that, if there is ever a time when Voldemort kept Nagini magically protected and always in his sight, Snape must then tell Harry that he is a seventh Horcrux, inadvertently created by Voldemort and that Harry must die in order for Voldemort to be killed. Snape felt tricked, upset that Dumbledore made him protect Lily's son only to have him die. Dumbledore asked if Snape had grown to care for Harry, but Snape spurned that possibility and produced his
   Patronus
   , a silver-white doe. Dumbledore asked Snape, "

   Many other details of Snape's behaviour were revealed in these memories as well: the scenes also showed Dumbledore's portrait telling Snape that he must give Voldemort the correct date of Harry's departure if Voldemort was to trust Snape. Snape was also to suggest the Potter decoys using
   Polyjuice Potion
   to
   Mundungus Fletcher
   so that Harry was indeed safe. It was then revealed that Snape, face-to-face with Mundungus in a tavern, used a
   Confundus Charm
   on Mundungus so that he would suggest using multiple Potters, and to forget seeing Snape or that he got the idea from him.

   Thus, the memories Harry saw showed that the reason Snape was begging for Voldemort to let him find the boy shortly before his death when he saw Nagini in her protective sphere. While he made it seem to Voldemort that he was offering to bring Harry to him so that Voldemort could kill him. Snape truly wanted to find Harry to tell him the crucial information found in this memory. Voldemort killed Snape, believing that it would make him the true master of the
   Elder Wand
   , before Snape could tell Harry the information Dumbledore instructed him to, but luckily Harry witnessed Snape's death in the
   Shrieking Shack
   and Snape was able to deliver the memories and information to Harry as his final act.

   Harry surfaced from
   the Pensieve
   and finally knew the truth; he was not meant to survive. His job had been to dispose of Voldemort's Horcruxes and then walk calmly to his death. As he lay on the floor of the
   Headmaster's office
   , Harry felt terror and fear at the knowledge that he had to die. He understood that Dumbledore had always planned for him to die, in order to defeat Voldemort.

  <p key="f0eb14ea-dbf6-4ae5-bfd9-9c5d3a50e9e5">
   However, Harry realised that Dumbledore had overestimated him and that Nagini, the last Horcrux, remained to bind Voldemort to the Earth even after Harry had been killed. He knew that Ron and Hermione would have to carry out killing the snake after Harry was killed. Not wanting to waste time with goodbyes, Harry put on the Invisibility Cloak and went down the floors and saw Neville carrying a body in from the grounds with

  <p key="c66d8bf4-3bfc-4973-a2af-3fd9123936e1">
   Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall, where people were kneeling beside the dead and comforting another, but he could not see Hermione, Ron, Ginny, the other Weasleys, or Luna. To make absolutely sure that Nagini was killed, he spoke to Neville, saying that just in case Neville got the chance, he must kill the snake. Now, like Dumbledore, Harry made sure that there were backups to carry on when he was dead, and that there would still be three people in on the Horcrux secret. Neville would take Harry's place.

   Harry swung the Cloak over himself and continued walking, but he stopped when he saw Ginny comforting a
   girl

Harry, mostly addressing Lupin, told them all that he had not wanted any of them to die, especially because Lupin will never know his son, but Lupin said that he hoped his son would understand that he died to have the boy live a happier life. James told Harry that they would stay with him until the very end, and Sirius informed him that the others would not be able to see them, as they were a part of Harry and invisible to everyone else.

   They set off, and the Dementor's chill did not overcome him; his companions acted like
   Patronuses

   Yaxley
   and
   Dolohov
   emerged from behind a nearby tree, with Yaxley saying he heard something and suggested that Harry was under his Invisibility Cloak. Deciding it must have been an animal, the two decided Harry's time to come was over and that they would return to the other Death Eaters to await orders.

   Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him to Voldemort, and his mother and his father smiled in encouragement. In mere minutes, Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov step into the clearing that once belonged to the monstrous
   Aragog
   . A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and there was a crowd of  Death Eaters around it. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group. Harry noticed Lucius Malfoy looking defeated and terrified, while Narcissa had sunken eyes full of apprehension. Voldemort looked up at Dolohov and Yaxley, and they informed him that there was no sign of the boy. Voldemort told the Death Eaters that he expected Harry to come and that it appeared he was mistaken. Harry contradicted Voldemort as loudly as he could, while the Resurrection Stone slipped between his fingers. His parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanished.

   Harry found himself laying face-down in a strange room. Not knowing the nature of this place, or its physical laws, he realised he was naked. As soon as he was aware of this, clothes appeared to him. Harry was concerned at a strange whimpering noise he could hear.
  </p>
  <p key="66f92576-0fe9-47e5-b096-4908e19aceff">
   Looking more closely at his surroundings, Harry saw a great domed glass roof glittering high above him, and he thought perhaps he was in a palace. Turning slowly on the spot, his surroundings invented themselves before his eyes; a wide-open space Harry recoiled as he spotted the thing making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child curled on the ground, with raw and rough skin, flayed looking and shuddering under a seat where it had been left unwanted, struggling for breath. Harry was afraid of it, feeling both pity and revulsion. At that moment, a voice told Harry he could not help it, and he turned to see
   <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="4e5a0891-ef49-401a-b37d-c3e32effc51e" title="Albus Dumbledore">

  </p>
  <p key="271c68ae-c1b2-4303-9b1a-fc18814cf04a">
   Dumbledore led Harry away to some seats away from the flayed child. The two sat down, and Harry looked at Dumbledore and saw everything he remembered about him. But, knowing Dumbledore was dead, Harry asked if he was dead as well. Dumbledore says this was not the case, and the fact that Harry willingly sacrificed himself would have made all the difference. With Dumbledore prompting him, Harry concluded that, because Harry let himself be killed by Voldemort, the part of Voldemort's soul that was in Harry had now gone. Harry's soul was whole and completely his own. Asking Dumbledore what the small, maimed creature trembling under the chair was, Dumbledore replied that it was something beyond either of their help. Harry asked how he could be alive when Voldemort used the
   <a href="Killing Curse.html" key="48e4722d-7e73-4644-9045-8b98841bcd61" title="Killing Curse">
    Killing Curse
   </a>
   and no one
   died for him
   this time, and Dumbledore explained that it was because Voldemort, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty, used Harry's blood to
   rebuild his living body
   in
   1995
   in the graveyard of
   Little Hangleton
   . Thus, Harry's blood being in Voldemort's veins, Lily's protection was inside both of them, making it so Voldemort tethered Harry to life while he lived.
  </p>
  <p key="0fc70e5a-c80e-42a7-92cf-1a28587c863c">
   Explaining further, Dumbledore revealed that Harry was the seventh Horcrux, a Horcrux that Voldemort did not mean to make. When Voldemort tried to kill Harry, his soul broke apart, and Voldemort left more than his body behind: a piece of his soul latched to Harry, his would-be victim.  Voldemort remained ignorant of some forms of magic, and he thus took Harry's blood in an attempt to strengthen himself by taking into his body a tiny part of the enchantment that Lily laid upon Harry upon her death. Voldemort's body kept her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survived, so did Harry and so did Voldemort's one last hope for himself.
  </p>
  <p key="7279573d-6bc0-4e66-88a7-7eaa2ca47c20">
   Harry then asked why his wand broke the wand that Voldemort borrowed. Dumbledore told him that Voldemort, having doubled the bond between them when he returned to human form ( thinking to strengthen himself, he took part of Harry's mother's sacrifice into himself) proceeded to attack Harry with a wand that shared Harry's wand's core. The cores reacted in
   <i key="d04c0d0c-0203-40a3-b12a-27f574279948">
    Priori Incantatem
   </i>
   , something Voldemort, who never knew that his wand and Harry's shared the same core, had never expected. That night, when Harry accepted, even embraced the possibility of death, Harry's wand overpowered Voldemort's, and something happened between the wands that echoed the relationship between their masters. Dumbledore believed that Harry's wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort's wand that night, that it contained a little of Voldemort himself.
  </p>
  <p key="be2c819b-6c78-4057-833a-6c646f00b9dd">
   During the
   Battle of the Seven Potters
   , Harry's wand recognised Voldemort when the Dark Lord pursued Harry, and it
   regurgitated
   some of Voldemort's own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything
   Lucius's wand
   had ever performed; Lucius's wand had no chance against the combined power of Harry's enormous courage against Voldemort's own deadly skill. Dumbledore explains that Harry's wand's remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered with the deepest laws of magic, and otherwise it was a wand like any other and so Hermione was able to break it.
  </p>
  <p key="9c1b8d6d-4dc9-4b70-a567-bf7b738c566b">
   Dumbledore told Harry that they could agree that Harry was

    not

   dead, and then Harry asked Dumbledore where they were. Dumbledore asked Harry the same question, to which Harry replied that it looked somewhat like

   </a>
   except cleaner and empty, and without any trains. Dumbledore chuckled at this suggestion, and when Harry asked what Dumbledore thought it looked like, Dumbledore replied with an infuriatingly unhelpful response. Harry then brought up the subject of the
   Deathly Hallows
   , which wiped the smile from Dumbledore's face. Dumbledore asked Harry to forgive him for not telling Harry, that Dumbledore feared that Harry would failed as he had failed, and make Dumbledore's mistakes. Dumbledore says that Harry is the better man, and with tears in his eyes he says that the Hallows are a desperate man's dream and lure for fools, and that Dumbledore was one such fool. Dumbledore tells Harry that he, too, sought a way to conquer death, and so he was not better, ultimately, than Voldemort, to which Harry protests, saying that Dumbledore tried to master death using the Hallows, whereas Voldemort tried to conquer death with the use of Horcruxes, by murdering.

  <p key="27ee7c56-aade-460f-9dab-d7ca81963c07">
   Dumbledore told Harry that above all, the Deathly Hallows were the objects that drew him and

   to explore the place where
   Ignotus Peverell
   , the third brother, had died. Dumbledore reveals that the
   Peverell brothers
   were in fact the three brothers of the tale, but that it is more likely that they were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating the powerful objects rather than them being Death's own Hallows, that this was the sort of legend that would have sprung up around the creations. The

   travelled down through the ages to Ignotus's last living descendant, who was born, like Ignotus, in Godric's Hollow: Harry. Dumbledore revealed that the Cloak was in his possession the night Harry's parents died because James had shown it to him a few days previously, and while Dumbledore had long since given up his dream of uniting the Hallows, he still wished to examine it, as it was a Cloak that matched the description of the tale perfectly.

   Dumbledore told Harry that he gave up on his search for the Hallows because of what happened, and that Harry cannot despise him as much as he despised himself. He told Harry that he resented the responsibility of his sister's poor health, and that his father died in
   Azkaban
   and his mother giving up her own life to care for Ariana. He revealed that he was gifted, brilliant, he wanted to escape, to shine, to have glory, and while he loved his brother and sister and parents, he disliked having the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother; he felt like his talent was trapped and wasted. Then Grindelwald came, with his ideas of

   forced into subservience and wizards triumphant, Grindelwald and Dumbledore being the leaders of the revolution. Dumbledore revealed that he had scruples, but he assuaged his conscience with empty words about it being for the greater good and any harm done would be repaid in benefits for wizards. Dumbledore closed his eyes to what Grindewald truly was, because if their plans came to fruition all of Dumbledore's dreams would come true.

  <p key="d040c804-feec-4839-b300-fed799bec7cd">
   At the heart of Dumbledore and Grindewald's schemes were the Deathly Hallows. Dumbledore told Harry how interested they were in the fascinating objects: the
   unbeatable wand
   that would lead them to power, the
   Resurrection Stone
   —to Grindewald it meant an army of
   Inferi
   and to Dumbledore it meant the resurrection of his parents and the lifting of all responsibility from his shoulders. Dumbledore told Harry that he and Grindelwald never discussed the Cloak much. Both of them could conceal themselves perfectly fine without the Cloak, and Dumbledore thought it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but mostly they were interested in the Cloak because it completed the trio, which would make them
   Master of Death
   , which they took to mean "invincible". After the two months of scheming and neglect of the two family members left to him, Dumbledore was forced to face reality with his brother,

    Aberforth
   </a>
   , telling him the truth that he could not seek the Hallows with an unstable sister. The argument became a fight, and Ariana lay dead on the floor. At this, Dumbledore began to cry in earnest, and then said that Grindelwald fled while Dumbledore was left to bury his sister and live with his guilt and grief, the price of his shame.
  </p>
  <p key="503cf6fd-b601-4e11-916d-38720b677ba5">
   Dumbledore then said that he was offered the post of
   Minister for Magic
   while rumours about Grindewald procuring a wand of immense power flew about. Harry told Dumbledore that he would have been a much better Minister than
   Fudge
   or
   Scrimgeour
   , but Dumbledore said that he had learned at a young age that he was not to be trusted with power, that it was his weakness and his temptation, and that those who are best suited to power are perhaps those who have leadership thrust upon them and have never sought it.
  </p>
  <p key="00aa94bf-ecbb-4352-bcf5-5426fcb80a31">
   While Dumbledore was at Hogwarts as a teacher, where he believed he was safer, Grindewald was raising an army, and that some said he feared Dumbledore, but not as much as Dumbledore feared him. It was not what Grindelwald could do to him magically (as Dumbledore knew that they were about evenly matched) that Dumbledore feared, rather Dumbledore was afraid of truth; which one of them had cast the curse that killed Ariana during that last horrific fight. Dumbledore dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been him who had brought about Ariana's death, not just through his arrogance and stupidity but that he actually struck the blow that killed her. Dumbledore delayed facing Grindelwald until it became shameful. People were dying, and Dumbledore did what he had to do. He won
   the duel
   and won the Elder Wand's allegiance.
  </p>
  <p key="548cd43b-b84a-4045-be01-43ec54598d40">
   Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead, and at last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he look in the

   . After a long silence, during which the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore, Harry told Dumbledore that Grindelwald had tried to stop Voldemort from going after the wand by lying and pretending he never had it. Dumbledore nodded, and said that Grindelwald was said to have shown remorse in later years, alone in his cell at

   , and that perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends, to stop Voldemort from taking the Hallow, or (as Harry suggested) to stop Voldemort from breaking into
   Dumbledore's tomb
   .
  </p>
  <p key="bda710a9-4ea0-4ab9-b873-983b75d96b80">
   After another short pause, Harry brought up that Dumbledore had tried to used the
   Resurrection Stone
   , to which Dumbledore nodded. He said that when he discovered it, after all those years buried in the
   abandoned home
   of the
   Gaunts
   , he lost his head and quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux and that
   the ring
   was sure to carry a curse. He picked it up, put it on, and for a second Dumbledore imagined that he was able to see Ariana and his parents again, and to apologise, but instead he suffered from the curse placed on the Horcrux ring. Dumbledore said that this was final proof that he was unworthy to unite the Hallows, that after all those years he had learned nothing. Harry defended him, saying that it was only natural for him to want to see his family again, but Dumbledore said that he was only fit to possess the Elder Wand, and only to use it to protect others from it. The Cloak, Dumbledore said, he had taken out of a vain curiosity, and so it would never have worked for him like it worked for Harry, its true master. Dumbledore said that he would have used the stone to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable his self-sacrifice, as Harry did. At this, Dumbledore said that Harry was the worthy possessor of the Hallows.

  <p key="76c08022-05e1-4356-94f5-a875535215b4">
   Harry asked Dumbledore why he had to make it all so difficult, and Dumbledore smiled as he admitted he counted on

   to slow Harry up. Dumbledore said he was afraid that Harry's hot head might dominate his good heart, and that Dumbledore feared that, if presented outright with the facts about the tempting objects, Harry might have tried to seize the Hallows like Dumbledore did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If Harry laid hands on them, Dumbledore wanted him to possess them safely. Dumbledore said that Harry was the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from
   death
   , but instead accepts that he must die and understands that there are worse things in the living world than dying.

  <p key="0baea90b-62e8-46ba-aea7-3ff350688cd6">
   When Harry asked if Voldemort ever knew about the existence of the Hallows, Dumbledore said that he did not believe so. He did not recognise the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux, but even if he had known about them, Dumbledore doubted that Voldemort would have been interested in any except the Elder Wand, as Voldemort would not think he needed the Cloak, and whom would be want to bring back from the dead with the stone, as he fears the dead and does not love. Despite this, Dumbledore did believe that Voldemort would go after the wand ever since Harry's beat Voldemort's own during the
   duel in Little Hangleton
   . At first, Voldemort was afraid that Harry had conquered him by superior skill. However, after kidnapping

   </a>
   , he discovered the existence of the twin cores, and he thought that a borrowed wand would solve the issue. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against Harry's, and so Voldemort went after the Elder Wand, a wand that was said to beat any other. Dumbledore said that he did indeed intend for

  <p key="6ff51e36-f3de-4e1d-a178-c0fdfc6dd5f8">
   Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet, while the creature behind them jerked and moaned. The realisation of what would happen next gradually settled on Harry, and he asked Dumbledore if he had to go back. Dumbledore replied that Harry had a choice, and that if they were in King's Cross Harry had the decision to go back, or to board a train and go "on". Harry mentioned that Voldemort has the Elder Wand, and while Dumbledore confirmed this, he said that if Harry chose to return there was a strong chance that Voldemort would be finished for good.
  </p>
  <p key="34defda0-2691-49dc-ac77-bc952c7e4133">
   Dumbledore said he could not promise this, but that Harry had less to fear from returning where they were than Voldemort did. Harry glanced at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair, but Dumbledore told Harry not to pity the dead, but instead to pity the living, especially those who live without love. He told Harry that by returning, Harry could ensure that fewer souls were injured and fewer families torn apart, as Harry had a strong possibility of being able to defeat Voldemort once and for all.

   Dumbledore said that if that seemed like a worthy goal, they would part for the time being. Harry nodded and sighed, knowing that leaving this place would not be as difficult as walking into the forest, but it was warm and light and peaceful and he knew that he would be going back to pain and the fear of more loss. Harry stood up, as did Dumbledore, and they looked at each other. Harry then asked if this was all real, or whether it had simply been happening inside his head. Dumbledore smiled, and as the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure, his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry's ears as he told Harry that it was definitely happening inside Harry's head, but by no means should that mean it was not real.

Harry expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead he heard hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filling the air.
  </p>
  <p key="8f6882fb-d7f8-454e-844a-757e4e1faab1">
   He then heard Bellatrix's voice, speaking as if to a lover as she addressed Voldemort. Harry, not daring to open his eyes, allowed his other senses to explore his situation, and he found that his wand was stowed beneath his robes and due to a slight cushioning effect around his stomach, he knew that the Invisibility Cloak was also there. Bellatrix addressed Voldemort again, but he cut her off. Harry heard more footsteps, and several people backed away from the same spot. Opening his eyes a millimetre, Harry saw that Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet with various Death Eaters hurrying away from him, with only Bellatrix remaining kneeled beside him.
  </p>
  <p key="6ae5c4ff-adbf-4920-b500-0f6d7b26d9c0">
   Harry closed his eyes and considered what he saw. The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the ground; perhaps Voldemort had also collapsed when he hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Both of them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned. Voldemort declined Bellatrix's offer of assistance coldly, and asked if the boy was dead. There was complete silence in the clearing as no one approached Harry, and with a bang and a small shriek of pain Voldemort ordered someone to examine Harry and then tell him whether the boy was dead.
  </p>
  <p key="08c73de4-efc1-47f0-a182-15939cd7a018">
   Voldemort himself was wary of approaching him, as he suspected not everything had gone according to plan. Harry felt a woman's hands touch his face, pull back an eyelid, creep beneath his shirt, down to his chest, and feel his heart.
  </p>
  <p key="0d9eac5c-ef88-4052-832f-ac0e9d160461">
   Harry's fear intensified, knowing that she could feel the steady pounding of his heartbeat against his ribs. In a barely audible whisper, with her lips an inch from Harry's ear and her long hair shielding his face from the onlookers, the woman asked if Draco was alive and in the castle. Harry breathed back a "

   Narcissa Malfoy
   falsely announced to the watchers that the boy was indeed dead.

  <p key="5070249c-9047-4fe9-9058-842b9d389905">
   Now the Death Eaters shouted, yelling in triumph and stamping their feet, and Harry saw through his eyelids bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. Still feigning death on the ground, Harry understood that Narcissa no longer cared whether Voldemort won, and so she lied to the Dark Lord knowing that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. Screeching over the tumult, Voldemort announced that now, with Harry Potter dead by his hand, no man could ever threaten him. Voldemort then cast the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on Harry's body, believing that his body must not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the floor but must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. Harry was lifted into the air, and he tried as hard as he could to remain limp, yet the pain he expected from the Torture Curse did not come. He was thrown three times into the air, and his glasses fell off while his wand slid a little beneath his robes, and he kept himself floppy and lifeless. When he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing was still echoing with jeers and shrieks of laughter.
  </p>
  <p key="3ce1bda4-373a-4a52-9355-0986d40e42ae">
   Voldemort then announced that they would go to the castle to display the defenders of Hogwarts what had become of Harry. Voldemort decided that Hagrid should carry Harry's body, as the boy would be nice and visible in Hagrid's arms, and Harry felt his glasses slammed onto his face with deliberate force when Voldemort ordered that he wear the glasses to be recognisable. The enormous hands that lifted Harry up were exceedingly gentle, and Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, but Harry did not dare to tell Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. Voldemort commanded Hagrid to move, and Hagrid stumbled forward as he forced his way through the close-growing trees back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he continued to feign death with his mouth lolling open and his eyes shut and in the darkness, with the Death Eaters crowing all around them and Hagrid still sobbing, no one looked to see if a pulse beat in Harry's exposed neck.

   Two
   giants
   crashed along behind the Death Eaters, and Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed. The giants made so much noise that the
   birds
   rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession continued to march on toward the open ground, and Harry could tell, after a while, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. Then, Hagrid unexpectedly bellowed at

   centaurs
   for not fighting, asking them if they were happy that Harry was dead, but he broke down in fresh tears and couldn't finish. Harry could not tell how many centaurs watched their procession pass, and he heard of some Death Eaters calling insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest, and Voldemort commanded Hagrid to stop and due to Hagrid's lurch, Harry suspected that the gamekeeper had been forced to obey. A chill began to settle over them, and Harry heard the rasping breath of
   dementors
   that patrolled the outer trees. However, the fact of his own survival burned inside of him, acting like a Patronus in his heart.

   Voldemort, his voice magically magnified, announced that Harry was dead and that he was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself. He told the defenders of Hogwarts that his
   Death Eaters
   outnumbered them and the Boy Who Lived was finished. Calling for no more war, Voldemort threatened that anyone who continued to resist would be killed, but that those who came out and knelt before him would be forgiven and spared. He then claimed that there must be no more conflict, offering the survivors the chance to join the Death Eaters and help the Dark Lord build a New World Order together. Voldemort strode in front of the procession, followed by a weeping Hagrid carrying Harry's supposed dead body, and wearing Nagini, now free of her enchanted cage, around his shoulders. Hagrid continued to sob, and Harry strained his ears to distinguish above the gleeful voice of the Death Eaters and their footsteps any sign of life from those within the castle.

  <p key="6e12096d-1371-459d-83ab-f66aab6b0daf">
   The Death Eaters came to a halt, and Harry could see through his closed lids light streaming upon him from the
   Entrance Hall
   . Harry waited for the moment when the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms. The first of the resistance to see Harry was Professor McGonagall, whose scream of anger, despair and denial was all the more terrible to Harry's ears because he had never imagined her capable of such a noise. The mocking laughter of another woman nearby was heard, and he knew it was Bellatrix glorying in McGonagall's despair. Harry squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face the Death Eaters and see the truth of Harry's death for himself.
  </p>
  <p key="d6916413-ecc7-4311-9a63-ce0f37a66470">
   Harry saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head with a single white finger. He then heard Ron, Hermione and Ginny's shouts of horror, even worse than McGonagall's, but Harry forced himself to remain lying silent. Their cries acted like a trigger, and the rest of the survivors began screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eaters until Voldemort cried for
   silence
   and with a bang and flash of bright light, silence was forced upon them all.
  </p>
  <p key="95824ba3-39f9-401b-add8-07a5ef8dc345">
   Voldemort ordered Harry to be lowered down and set at his feet, and he proclaimed to the survivors that Harry Potter was nothing but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him. Ron then yelled and cursed at Voldemort, claiming that Harry was always better than him, and the charm broke and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until another bang extinguished their voices once more. Voldemort lied once more that Harry was killed when trying to sneak out of the castle grounds, but he was interrupted by a scuffle and a shout, then a bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain. Opening his eyes slightly, Harry saw that someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort, but hit the ground, disarmed, and Voldemort laughed as he threw the challenger's wand aside.
  </p>
  <p key="eb142d3c-9296-4a01-91e0-5f76543f57c8">
   Voldemort asked the crowd who had stepped forth to show what happened to people who continued to fight when the battle was lost. Laughing delightedly, Bellatrix answered that it was

   Dumbledore's Army
   , and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's wand bangs seemed unable to hold. Voldemort answered in a dangerous, silky voice that, if that was Neville's choice, they would revert to the original plan.

   Salazar Slytherin
   would suffice for everyone. He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still as Voldemort cast a
   Full Body-Bind Curse
   on him, then Voldemort forced the hat onto Neville's head. There were movements from the watching crowd, but the Death Eaters raised their wands as one and held the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. With a flick of his wand, Voldemort

There was an uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle with loud war cries. At the same time,
   Grawp
   came around the side of the castle, and when he saw that his brother Hagrid was captured; he furiously yelled

Grawp, showing no fear despite actually being a young giant himself; flung himself at the oncoming giants and began to pummel and floor them. There was then the sound of hooves and the twangs of bows as the
   centaurs
   , ending their neutrality, joined the fray. Arrows began falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks shouting in surprise.

In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind curse placed upon him, and the flaming hat fell from his head and he drew from inside it something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle: the
   Sword of Godric Gryffindor

Then, over the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid yelled for Harry, asking where Harry was. There was chaos as the charging centaurs scattered the Death Eaters and everyone fled from the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements. Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort's giants,

   bouncing on his chest, was
   Kreacher
   , yelling at his compatriots to fight the Dark Lord in the name of his master's
   sacrifice
   . The house-elves were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters with their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked the Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempted to escape but swallowed by the charging army.

   Harry sped between duellists, past struggling prisoners, and into the Great Hall, where he saw Voldemort in the centre of the battle striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot of him, but he fought his way closer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. Harry watched as the Death Eaters, outnumbered by the defenders and allies of Hogwarts, were taken down one by one:

  </p>
  <p key="084de815-c552-47af-bb34-0138c2ee7bd8">
   Bellatrix roared with laughter at the sight of her new challenger, and Molly ordered the girls to step aside. With a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around their feet became hot and cracked, both witches were fighting to kill. As a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid, Mrs Weasley shouted for them to get back and leave Bellatrix to her. Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights: Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, while Harry stood invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.

  <p key="54fb908a-445a-4a6d-9fb2-e03dd3b2ec22">
   As Bellatrix, as mad as her master, taunted Molly about the death of Fred Weasley even as Molly's curses came within inches of her, Molly screamed that Bellatrix would never touch her children again. Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh that her cousin
   Sirius
   had given as he toppled backward through the
   veil
   , and Harry suddenly knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly's well-aimed
   curse
   soared beneath Bellatrix's outscretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix's gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge; for a split second she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.

   Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion. He saw McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley, but Harry roared

   The yells of shock, cheers, and screams of delight at Harry's appearance were stifled, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry stared at each other and began to circle each other, like prowling lions sizing each other up. Harry called to the crowd that he didn't want anyone else to help, that it had to just be him and Voldemort, though Voldemort hissed that Harry truly wanted someone to use a shield, to sacrifice themselves for him. Harry replied that there were no more
   Horcruxes
   , that it was just him and Voldemort: neither could live while the other survived, and one of them was going to leave for good. Voldemort jeered at the proposal that Harry would survive, the boy who survived by accident and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings.
  </p>
  <p key="6ba1a54c-993c-49de-b7c8-6ef808d752fd">
   Harry then asked if it was accident when his mother died to save him, accident when he decided to fight in the graveyard, if it was an accident when he didn't defend himself that night, still survived, and returned to fight again. Voldemort screamed that these were accidents, but he still did not strike, will the hundreds watching in the Hall were frozen as if Petrified. Voldemort proclaimed that it was accident and chance, and that Harry crouched and snivelled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted Voldemort to kill them for Harry to save himself. Harry replied that Voldemort wouldn't be killing anyone else, as they stared into each other's eyes, green into red. Harry said that Voldemort wouldn't be able to kill any of them ever again, because Harry was ready to die to stop him from hurting them, and that thus he did what his mother did to him. He gave the defenders of Hogwarts
   sacrificial protection
   , and which was why none of the spells Voldemort put on them were binding: Voldemort couldn't torture them, or touch them, and Harry ended by calling Voldemort "

  <p key="f4e99c73-871d-4f6e-82a8-36ca51d6b837">
   Harry told Voldemort that he knew lots of important things that 'Riddle' didn't, and offered to tell him some of them before he made another big mistake. Voldemort did not speak but continued prowling in a circle, and Harry knew that he had kept him temporarily at bay and mesmerised, held back by the possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. His snake's face jeering, Voldemort suggested that the secret was
   love
   , Dumbledore's favourite solution that he claimed conquered death, but Voldemort said that love did not stop him from killing Harry's mother, or Dumbledore falling from the top of the
   Astronomy Tower
   , and that nobody seemed to love Harry enough to run forward and take Voldemort's curse. Voldemort then asked, if nobody sacrificed themself for Harry, what would stop Harry from dying when he struck.
  </p>
  <p key="886b013e-3711-434a-a386-a3db6c99beb2">
   As they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret, Voldemort suggested that, if it wasn't love that would save Harry, Harry must believe he possessed magic that Voldemort didn't, or a weapon more powerful than Voldemort's. When Harry said he believed both, shock flitted across the snakelike face, but it was instantly dispelled as Voldemort began to laugh at the possibility that Harry knew more magic than he did, than Lord Voldemort, the wizard who performed magic
   <a href="Albus Dumbledore.html" key="682d47c8-ccef-463f-a743-9e92070b323e" title="Albus Dumbledore">
    Dumbledore
   </a>
   himself never dreamed of. Harry contradicted this, saying that Dumbledore did indeed dream of it, but that he knew more than Voldemort, he knew enough not to do what Voldemort had done. Voldemort screamed that this meant Dumbledore was weak, too weak to dare, to weak to take what might have been his, and what would soon be Voldemort's. Harry again disagreed, saying that Dumbledore was cleverer than Voldemort; a better wizard and a better man.
  </p>
  <p key="7dec2d56-9f6c-457d-81d7-e44c7af66afe">
   Voldemort said that he brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore, but Harry told Voldemort that he was wrong. At this, for the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one. Voldemort hurled the words that Dumbledore was dead at Harry as though they would cause him unendurable pain, and added that his body was decaying in the marble tomb on the Hogwarts grounds, never to return. Harry calmly agreed that Dumbledore was dead, but that Voldemort didn't have him killed. Harry told him that Dumbledore chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, that he arranged the whole thing with the man Voldemort thought was his servant. Voldemort said that this was a childish dream, but he still did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry's.
  </p>
  <p key="2ac8a0f5-3caf-4194-9f5a-873d1de4c3a3">
   Harry said that
   <a href="Severus Snape.html" key="bc864f2b-94c6-46b3-bde6-f6806eaa8afe" title="Severus Snape">
    Severus Snape

    Lily Evans
   </a>
   . Harry added that Voldemort never realised this because of the thing he can't understand. Harry asked Voldemort if he had ever seen Snape cast a Patronus, and Voldemort did not answer as they continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. Harry revealed that Snape's Patronus was a doe, the same as Lily's, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. When Harry asked Voldemort if Snape asked him to spare Lily's life, Voldemort sneered that Snape had only desired her, and that when she had gone he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him. Harry said that of course Snape would have told Voldemort that, but that in reality Snape was Dumbledore's spy from the moment Lily was threatened, he had been working against Voldemort ever since, and that Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him.
  </p>
  <p key="fb9a7d66-33f2-470a-afca-fa887a451a9a">
   Voldemort had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter as he said that none of this mattered. It didn't matter whether Snape was his or Dumbledore's, or what petty obstacles they had tired to put in his path. Voldemort said that he crushed them, crushed them as he had crushed Harry's mother, Snape's supposed great love. Voldemort then said that it all made sense, in ways that Harry didn't understand. Voldemort then mentioned that Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from him, that Dumbledore had intended for Snape to be the true master of the wand. Voldemort then said that he had gotten there ahead of Harry, that he had reached the wand before Harry could get his hands on it, understood the truth before Harry had caught up. Voldemort then said that he had killed Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, was truly his.
  </p>
  <p key="5309e852-c09d-474d-9e38-88f7e4f6e4c2">
   Voldemort said that Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, which Harry agreed with, but he advised Voldemort to think about what Voldemort had done. Harry told him to try for some remorse, and of all the things Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort more than this. Voldemort's pupils contracted to thin slits, and the skin around his eyes whitened. Harry said that trying for remorse was Voldemort's last chance, that he had seen what Voldemort would be otherwise, that trying to feel remorse was all Voldemort had left. Voldemort was furious at this, and Harry revealed that Dumbledore's last plan hadn't backfired on him at all, that it had backfired on Voldemort, whose hand was trembling on the Elder Wand. Harry gripped Draco's wand very tightly, knowing the moment was seconds away. Harry told Voldemort that the wand was still not working properly for Voldemort because Voldemort murdered the wrong person; Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand, that he had never defeated Dumbledore.
  </p>
  <p key="dd9c3f8e-be7d-4812-b9dd-0d00108f2796">
   Voldemort began to disagree, but Harry once again said that Snape didn't defeat Dumbledore because their death was planned between them. Dumbledore had intended to die undefeated, the wand's last true master, and that if all had gone as planned, the wand's power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him. Voldemort said that this meant Dumbledore as good as gave him the wand, because Voldemort stole it from its last master's tomb, removed it against its last master's wishes, and that the wand's power was his. Harry contradicted this, saying that Riddle still didn't understand that possessing the wand wasn't enough, that holding and using it didn't really make it yours. Harry revealed that the Elder Wand recognised a new master before Dumbledore had died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realising exactly what he had done, or that he had attained the allegiance of the world's most dangerous wand. Voldemort chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, building inside the wand Voldemort had in his hand.
  </p>
  <p key="4a81a634-730b-4a7d-97cf-25a3c9629f86">
   Harry then said that the true master of the Elder Wand was, in fact,
   <a href="Draco Malfoy.html" key="f942b793-ca0a-4ee7-9d6b-0a9c6ed9a7eb" title="Draco Malfoy">
    Draco Malfoy
   </a>
   , who had
   Disarmed
   Dumbledore and won the wand's allegiance shortly before Snape killed him. Utter shock showed on Voldemort's face for a moment at this news, but then it was gone as Voldemort said that this didn't matter, that even if Harry was right it made no different to them. Harry no longer had the phoenix wand, and so they would duel on skill alone, and Voldemort said that after he had killed Harry he would attend to Draco Malfoy. Harry then said that Voldemort was too late, that he had missed his chance, because Harry had overpowered Draco weeks ago and took the hawthorn wand from him. Harry twitched this wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. Harry then whispered that it all came down to this, whether or not the Elder Wand knew its last master was Disarmed, because if it did, then that meant that Harry was the Elder Wand's true master.

   A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above as the sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window, and the light hit both of their faces at the same time so that Voldemort's was a flaming blur; nature itself indicating that the time had come.

There was a bang like a cannon blast, and golden flames erupted between them at the dead centre of the circle they had been treading, marking the point where the spells collided. Voldemort's green jet of light met Harry's spell, and the Elder Wand wrenched itself from Voldemort's hand and began spinning across the ceiling toward the master it refused to kill. Harry caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed and the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Voldemort hit the ground, his body feeble and shrunken, his snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead by his own rebounding curse, and Harry looked down at his enemy's shell with the two wands in his hand.

Harry returned the Elder Wand to the

   The death of Voldemort and many of his followers brought the
   Second Wizarding War
   to an end. Wizarding Britain, which had been living in fear for the previous two years, suddenly found itself again free from the grasp of the Death Eaters and their leader, Lord Voldemort. Harry Potter, without a doubt one of the people most affected by the war, having lost parents, godfather, mentor, and many friends, now finds himself free of the burden that was placed on him before his birth, when
   the Prophecy
   named him as the only one that could defeat the Dark Lord.

   , and telling Hermione that they ought to warn them, is a turning point in their relationship. Hermione recognised it as a sign of maturity, that Ron was now thinking of others, and it deepened her

   and
   Scorpius Malfoy
   attempted to use a "true"
   Time-Turner
   to save
   <a href="Cedric Diggory.html" key="2dfdb1c8-fd0e-4aca-992e-961814b4c70b" title="Cedric Diggory">

   from death at
   Voldemort's rebirth
   , they inadvertently created an
   alternate reality
   where Cedric was so humiliated that he joined the Death Eaters in spite. Cedric killed Neville during the final stages of the Battle of Hogwarts, thus preventing him from killing Nagini. As a result, Voldemort remain protected from death, and succeeded in killing Harry.
  </p>
  <p key="78eebf03-bd27-4aca-ae3c-013381ab253d">
   As a result of killing Harry, Voldemort completely conquered the wizarding world, where
   Dolores Umbridge
   became the permanent Headmistress of Hogwarts, Draco becoming the head of the
   Department of Magical Law Enforcement
   and the Order of the Phoenix and their allies became no more than a flickering pocket of resistance. In a twist, Voldemort did not kill Snape, who continued to live up to his role as a triple agent, lamenting on his failure to protect Harry. Because Harry died during the war, Albus Potter became
   un-born
   .
  </p>
  <p key="51dc0fee-0e28-408f-b1a4-bb3d03e787eb">
   The Scorpius of this timeline was alleged to be cruel and mean, such as forcing
   Craig Bowker Jnr
   to do his homework. However, because Scorpius was involved in using the Time-Turner to change the past, he maintained his original personality and memory of his friend Albus. He was able to persuade Snape of everything that happened and to help him in repairing the damage, thus restoring the timeline in which Voldemort was defeated.
  </p>
  <p key="17e15ea5-f141-4b1e-b85f-74b152906ced">
   Upon returning to their true time, Albus and Scorpius were greatly reprimanded by Professor McGonagall and their parents for plunging the world back into the dark age where Voldemort ruled, and would have been expelled were it not for McGonagall's understanding of the students' parents. Nevertheless, she punished them with a multitude of detentions and cancellation of their holidays.
