   Trolls generally reached a height of about twelve feet and weighed up to a tonne.
   Troll whiskers
   had magical properties, and were sometimes used as
   wand cores
   , though they were considered inferior to the
   Supreme Cores
   . Their feet had two toes, both with giant toenails.

   They were dangerously violent and incredibly aggressive, and they engaged in unpredictable behaviour, comparable to
   giants
   .
   They were also incredibly low in intelligence, of which
   giants
   seemed to have more.
   Trolls were particularly attracted to unpleasant smells, such as
   Dungbombs

   Troll language was supposedly nothing more than simple grunts that only trolls seemed to be able to interpret, though skilled magical multi-linguists such as
   Barty Crouch
   could understand them.
   Trolls understood only a limited number of
   Human
   words, and some smarter ones could be skillfully trained as
   security trolls
