   's office, to use the fireplace to try to contact Sirius, while Ron attempted to distract Umbridge. However, they were caught, along with Neville Longbottom, by Umbridge and members of the
   Inquisitorial Squad
   . They were restrained and gagged, but Luna hardly seemed bothered by this as she was staring, dreamily, through the window as if bored.
  </p>
  <p key="3508d43f-87f6-4298-a65f-22c35716f3ec">
   Harry and Hermione drew Umbridge away into the
   Forbidden Forest
   , and Luna, Ginny, Ron, and Neville managed to escape from the Inquisitorial Squad using a variety of hexes and jinxes. When they all met up again in the forest, Harry planned to go to the
   Ministry of Magic
   . Luna reminded Harry about the
   <a href="Thestral.html" key="6a8c9fed-2657-4320-a473-9c82199baf5e" title="Thestral">
    Thestrals
   </a>
   and suggested using them to get to the Ministry. She then mounted her Thestral side-saddle, "as though she did this every day." She also helped Ron, Hermione and Ginny mount their Thestrals, as the animals were invisible to them. The six D.A. members flew to the Ministry and entered the
   Department of Mysteries
   , where Luna heard voices coming from behind a

   Luna participated in the
   battle
   that ensued. She protected Ron, who had been hit with a
   spell
   that made him highly confused. Luna also attacked a Death Eater who had seized Ginny's ankle with the
   Reductor Curse
   , which destroyed a model of the planet Pluto. The model blew up in the Death Eater's face; however, the impact broke Ginny's ankle. Luna guided both the injured Ginny and the
   Confunded
   Ron until they met up with Harry and Neville.

   Luna was one of the last D.A. members to fall, eventually being
   stunned
   by a Death Eater and thrown across the room. She regained focus just before the end of the battle and survived relatively unscathed. At the end of the school year, Luna spoke to Harry, who was mourning the murder of his godfather and had found no comfort in talking to

   asked Harry if he wanted to join her and her friends in another compartment, while treating Luna and Neville with disdain, Harry coldly rebuffed her, stating that they were his friends. Luna correctly observed that people expected Harry to associate with "cooler" people; he replied that she and Neville were cool, and among his closest and most trustworthy friends.

   In
   1995
   , fourteen-year-old Luna had waist-length, straggly, dirty blonde hair,
   protuberant silvery eyes,
   which often seemed to be dreamily distracted, and faint eyebrows. She had an aura of "distinct dottiness" about her,
   and was known to put
   her wand
   behind her left ear for safekeeping.

   Luna had a unique fashion sense that other people usually found bizarre. She often wore odd pieces of jewellery such as a
   Butterbeer
   cork necklace and
   Dirigible plum earrings
   , and in 1996, a pair of
   Spectrespecs
   .
   Luna also did not wear shoes because students in her house would take her shoes and hide them.

   Although many thought Luna was bizarre, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, Dean Thomas and Ollivander eventually became very fond of her.

  <p key="f209e33e-ddfb-4896-bade-30dd3d15e466">
   Luna's demeanour and voice were often distant and dreamy; she would drift away from a conversation she did not find interesting. However, whenever someone made fun of her father or his magazine

   Luna was often the subject of ridicule and had difficulty making friends. Other students gave her the nickname of "Loony Lovegood" and even stole and hid her things. She was unfazed by this, and instead chose to be nonjudgmental and accepting of those around her.
   She once said that she did not like dancing much, though she did dance some at the
   wedding of Bill and Fleur
   , along with her father.

   Luna seemed to have enjoyed artistic pursuits in her free time; her house was filled with various things that she painted.
   She even painted very life-like portraits of her friends that seemed to breathe. Luna was very loyal to the few friends she had — she published Rita Skeeter's interview of Harry Potter on

Neville found Luna a bit "odd," as she believed in the existence of strange, mythical creatures, had a tendency to read magazines upside down, and wore earrings that appeared to be made of radishes.
