   The holidays pass, and Lupin

   Harry the spell to conjure a Patronus, a 'shield' or 'force' that can repel a Dementor. A Patronus is the opposite of a Dementor which breeds on unhappy thoughts and bad memories. The happier the thought used to cast the spell, the more powerful the Patronus. After a few attempts, Harry manages to create a Patronus. One night, Harry is using the Marauder's Map, and he sees Pettigrew's name. However when following his name, he finds no one, but is caught by Snape. Lupin appears and sees the map. He takes it from Snape and then gets Harry away. In his
   classroom
   , he tells Harry that it was irresponsible of him to wander around with the map. Before leaving, Harry says that the map may not be working properly - he had seen Pettigrew's name on it, despite the fact that he's supposed to be dead. Lupin says that it's not possible, and stays looking at the map, quietly.

At the end of the year, Lupin resigns, knowing that people will not want a werewolf to teach their children. Later, Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt, an extremely fast racing broom.

But in the film, during his first ride on Buckbeak, Harry is fascinated by the ride and enjoying it a lot as they fly over the Black Lake, raising his arms and shouting in triumph. The film portrayal also depicts a much longer ride, with Buckbeak achieving a sort of smooth, idyllic glide not described in the novel.

    In the novel, when Snape substitutes for Lupin in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Harry is 10 minutes late and Snape takes 10 points then another 5 when Harry is told to sit down, but continuously asks where Lupin is. Hermione then says that they had done Boggarts, Red Caps, Kappas and Grindylows and that they're about to start something else before being cut off by Snape and a moment later when he announces that they will start a lesson about werewolves, but Hermione tells him that they are not meant to start that topic yet and that they're due to start Hinkypunks. Snape then asks the class who can tell him how to distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf, Snape immediately criticises Hermione and deducts an extra 5 points from Gryffindor then Ron shouts at Snape for taking points when Hermione knows the answer and he gives Ron detention. In the film, this is all different in some ways and this scene also has a few moments that did not occur in the book:

      Harry is already in class before Snape enters, so Harry is not at all late. This also omits Snape taking the first 15 points from Gryffindor. However, Harry asks only once in the film where Lupin is and Snape replies "That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say that your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time."

      Hermione tells Snape that they had just began learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks and are not meant to start werewolves for weeks before Snape tells her to be quiet. Also, Hermione learns Snape will be teaching werewolves after he does an action that does not happen in the book: He sees Ron turning his pages one-by-one before Snape makes a movement with his wand and the book turns to page 394 (as Snape requested) and Ron says "Werewolves"?.

    This quote is also said in the book, after Lupin enters and greets Sirius as an old friend: "I trusted you, and all this time you've been his friend!"; It was shouted at Lupin by Harry, but in the film, it is Hermione who shouts this at Lupin when she thinks both he and Sirius are wanting to kill Harry when Sirius says "Let's kill him!"

In the novel, Snape is as eager to hand over Lupin to the dementors as well as Sirius, despite the fact that there is not any evidence supporting Snape's claim that Lupin was helping Sirius into the castle, which he was not.

   <li key="58e0fe4f-2ca9-4f79-bffc-9da8d9316094">
    In the film, Lupin pleads with Snape while Sirius continues to taunt him. Snape is more calm (albeit still spiteful), confronting the two, as opposed to the book, where he seems to be angry and even more reluctant to listen, as he bounds and gags Lupin, threatens Hermione with suspension and states that Harry deserved to be killed by Sirius.

    In the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione all try and disarm Snape at the same time, causing him to hit against the wall and go unconscious. In the film, it is only Harry who does this, as seen when he sneakily pulls Hermione's wand from her pocket, while Ron holds onto her sleeve to keep her hand still, as Harry removes it. Still, both Ron and Hermione are shocked that Harry did this, as Snape is a teacher.

    In the book, Ron hesitates before giving Scabbers, or rather Peter to Lupin. In the film, it is Sirius who takes Peter from Ron, and he does it by force, instead of Ron giving Peter to him freely.

      Similarly, when Sirius Black explains that Peter Pettigrew is alive and fingers who he is, Ron initially thinks Sirius truly is insane, thinking Black was referring to him, before Sirius clarifies that he was in fact referring to his pet rat Scabbers, whom he was holding at the time.

    In the book, Snape had been unconscious because of the spell cast by Hermione, Ron, and Harry and had to be suspended in mid-air by magic to be brought out of the
    Shrieking Shack
    . He was not there to protect Hermione, Ron, and Harry when Lupin transformed into a werewolf, but in the film, Snape was left behind, but suddenly regained consciousness to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione from Lupin. In the book Snape regains consciousness only after Sirius, Hermione and Harry become unconscious because of the Dementors.

Harry never threw anything at the transformed Lupin in the book.

In the novel, neither of these two events occur. All those events revealed they never actually changed the present, but instead were already part of the actions unseen previously by their past selves.

Dumbledore reminds Harry that he saved Black, an innocent man, from a terrible fate, that Pettigrew owes a life debt to Harry for saving him, which Dumbledore is sure will prove useful later on. Dumbledore also mentions that Harry has some of his father's qualities, which is why his Patronus took the form of Prongs (a stag). In the film, it is Lupin tells Harry all this. Also:

One change noted several times on the associated DVD featurettes is that Gambon plays Dumbledore with a more pronounced Irish accent than his predecessor, who was also Irish.

    different actress
    , background, and ball gown from the first film: In the first film, the Fat Lady is played by Elizabeth Spriggs. She is shown with black hair and a pink silk dress and she doesn't seem to have much personality. Oddly, this version of her is not particularly fat. Her portrait is located at the end of a corridor somewhere in the castle, but its location is never specified. The Fat Lady as portrayed by Spriggs moves only when approached by a student and very little at that. She also asks for the password, ensuring more effective concealment of the common room. In the first film, given the Fat Lady's dress and background, she seems to have lived in the sixteenth century Europe. The Spriggs version of the Fat Lady's portrait is also used in the video game adaptations of Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets.

   In this film she is played by Dawn French, who portrays the character with a more humorous side, such as giving her a bad singing voice (possibly from the saying "the fat lady sings"). This iteration of her is much, much fatter than the previous one. She is much louder and more flamboyant and would be obvious to any passing members of other houses, who would also be able to hear Gryffindor students as they gave her the password, which this version of the portrait is reluctant to listen to. By this time, her portrait has been moved to the seventh floor of the Grand Staircase Tower. The portrait is shown to swing backwards rather than forwards in this film as well. In the third film, given the Fat Lady's dress and background, she seems to have lived during the Classical period.

   , it is located on the
   Seventh Floor
   of the
   Grand Staircase Tower
   . As the shape of the common room doesn't change, one explanation of this change of location may be that these particular stairs were not there in the first film, and were built to replace the corridor during the summer of 1992, before Harry's third year started.

    The Whomping Willow also went through a significant design change. In the previous film, it had thick, club/fist-like branches that attempted to punch and crush anything that comes nearby, with thin branches protruding from the tips. In this film, it looked more like a regular willow, with long, thin branches it used to slap and grab anything that moves too close. (and flick any bird that flies too close)

    Lupin's school-time nickname of 'Moony' is misspelt on the Marauders Map as 'Mooney.' This is an inside joke from visual effects supervisor, Karl Mooney. Also, Albus Dumbledore's name is spelled 'Albvs' when he is seen pacing in his study on the map. However, this might be an influence from Latin, where "u" is replaced by "v".

    When the film begins, Harry is shown performing "Lumos". According to the
    Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery
    , he is not allowed to perform magic, even at night, under a blanket and even without any Muggles present - whereas in the book he uses a torch. (Since

    In the scene in which Harry and Hermione go back in time, Dumbledore states that 'The word of three thirteen year old wizards will convince few others'. However, only Harry is still thirteen at this point; Ron and Hermione have both had their fourteenth birthdays. Buckbeak is sentenced to death in April 1994, but Ron turned 14 in March 1994 and Hermione in September 1993. However, this could be explained as the headmaster of a school that has probably hundreds of students at any one time Dumbledore cannot be expected to remember the personal details, such as dates of birth, of every single one of them.
