    Tom Marvolo Riddle

   came to
   Little Hangleton
   in search of his family. Upon learning of
   his father
   's actions toward
   Merope
   and himself from his
   uncle
   , he decided to murder his father. That same evening, Frank Bryce saw Riddle climbing the hill towards the
   Riddle House
   but did not accost him or do anything, unaware of how his life would be forever changed by the boy.
   The next morning, the Riddles'
   maid
   found all three Riddles dead in their house's drawing room. The
   police
   arrested Frank as their main suspect, since he had the only key to the mansion and there had been no sign of forced entry, and he was taken to the neighbouring town of
   Great Hangleton
   for questioning. Though Frank explained that the last person he saw near the Riddle House was the dark-haired boy, nobody else had seen him and was sure that Frank invented him. However, the report on the Riddles' bodies was unable to determine the cause of their death, and Frank was released due to lack of evidence, although he was still widely suspected by his neighbours.

   Frank had no family, and continued to live a solitary disconnected life in his small cottage on the
   Riddle House
   grounds. He continued to be paid as the gardener by the house's succession of owners. As he aged, he was plagued by the pain in his leg, and by the vandalism of
   local boys
   , which he suspected was motivated by the belief that he was a murderer. The boys would usually throw rocks into the Riddle House, trample or ride their bicycles on the flowerbeds that Frank worked hard to keep smooth or even break in the House for a dare, then flee when Frank tried to pursue them, unsuccessfully due to his injured leg.

Invited into the drawing room where Voldemort and Wormtail resided, Frank courageously faced the murderer, trying to bluff that his wife would know of his absence. However, Voldemort easily saw through Frank's bluff, knowing that no one knows of his whereabouts and that he had no wife. When Frank challenged Voldemort to face him "like a man", he was utterly horrified at the
   mutilated, rudimentary body

    Etymology
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="4232dfb4-cea2-4816-b931-2909c56f76f2">
   The name "Frank" comes from a Germanic name which referred to a member of the Germanic tribe, the Franks. The Franks settled in the regions now called France and the Netherlands in the 3rd and 4th century. They derived their tribal name from the name of a type of throwing axe that they used. The name was brought to England by the Normans. Notable bearers include author L. Frank Baum (1856–1919) and architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959).

    Horcrux
    , but it was officially stated that
    Bertha Jorkins
    ' death was used instead. However, as Jorkins was omitted from the films (and she did not appear in the stream of people who appeared in the
    Priori Incantatem
    ), Frank's death might have been used instead in the film timeline. However, this still leaves in question how Voldemort knew about the Triwizard Tournament. So Bertha may have been present off-screen, but not killed with Voldemort's wand, perhaps by Nagini instead.

    In the book, Frank is invited into the room and killed when he demands Voldemort to show himself. In the film, Voldemort does not tell Wormtail to beckon Frank, but tells him to stand aside and merely kills Bryce on the spot where he was standing.
