   Centaurs also decided to be placed in the

Later the same year, they proclaimed that even Hagrid was "no longer welcome" within "their" forest, as he had "forfeited the friendship of the centaurs," and that their "tolerance was waning" (in reference to Hagrid's half-brother,
   Grawp

   Starting in

   Being
   " status, when
   Grogan Stump
   decreed that a "being" was "any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws". However, they declined because of the associations with other creatures, such as
   vampires
   and
   hags
   , that "being" status would give them. The
   merpeople
   made the same decision a year later. Subject teaching material thus notes on why they are classed as 'Beasts' and that they should be treated with great respect.
