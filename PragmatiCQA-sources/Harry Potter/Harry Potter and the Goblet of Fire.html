   The students sit down at their tables (with the Beauxbatons students at the Ravenclaw table and Durmstrang at Slytherin), and the
   Welcoming Feast

   Ludo Bagman
   , and
   Barty Crouch
   all arrive late. After the feast, Dumbledore announces that Bagman and Crouch, who helped organise the tournament, will also serve as judges alongside the three headmasters to evaluate the Champions' performances. Dumbledore then announces that the three champions will be chosen by the
   Goblet of Fire
   , an enchanted artefact. Students must drop their names into the Goblet, and the Goblet chooses the most worthy entrants to compete in three dangerous tasks. Dumbledore finishes by stating the champions will be selected the following night during
   Hallowe'en

   Karkaroff
   gives Harry a look of displeasure before Moody forces him to move along. The Goblet is placed in the Great Hall and an

   Since Harry neither submitted his name nor asked an older student to do so, the assembly is dumbfounded. Harry himself is feeling very confused as he heads into the room where the champions are waiting. Although protests issue from the heads of the other schools, it is decided that the Goblet of Fire has spoken and that changes must be made accordingly. While many think Harry has somehow circumvented Dumbledore's age-restricting barrier, Moody suggests that perhaps someone entered Harry's name under a fourth school to ensure he would be included in the competition, hoping he might not survive the perilous tasks.

Ron demands to know whom he was talking to but Harry tells him it's none of his business and goes to bed.

During a private conversation with Mr Bagman, Harry learns that Barty Crouch has stopped coming to work and is sending Percy instructions by owl. Also, after a search, they still haven't found Bertha Jorkins. Bagman then again offers his help for the tournament, which Harry immediately declines. Fred and George's sudden appearance forces Mr Bagman to leave. Hermione then questions why Mr Bagman is trying to help Harry cheat, along with why he was meeting with goblins. Rita Skeeter, who also encountered Bagman and the goblins, then shows up to investigate. Harry and Hermione start an argument with her about her article on Hagrid.

   The trio go to Hagrid's cabin and, along with Dumbledore, try to persuade him to return. They point out that not everyone has abandoned Hagrid, and that everyone has secrets in their pasts. After Dumbledore leaves, Hagrid remembers his late father telling him never to be ashamed of what he is and gets over his depression. He gives his support to Harry in the Tournament, believing that if Harry wins, he could show everyone they do not have to be ashamed of what they are. This is enough to convince Harry to put aside his pride and take Cedric's advice.

Moody then shows up, angering Snape by suggesting Snape had something to hide in his office. Snape points out that Moody searched his office after his arrival at Hogwarts. Moody then saves Harry from detection by claiming that the Marauder's Map is his own (after an invisible Harry warns him not to give it to Snape). However, Snape suspects Harry's involvement because he recognises the Marauder's Map before Moody confiscates the egg from Filch and forces the pair away.

   On the last night before the task, the trio are continuing their research in the school library when Fred and George appear to inform them that Professor McGonagall has summoned Ron and Hermione.

   The next morning, with a little help from Dobby, Harry discovers
   gillyweed
   , a plant that, when eaten, gives him fish-like qualities such as gills and fins. He quickly makes his way to the lake just as the task is about to start and finds that, once again, Percy is taking Mr Crouch's place. While swimming through the lake and fighting off a swarm of
   Grindylows
   , Moaning Myrtle points Harry in the right direction and Harry discovers a town of
   Merpeople
   , where Ron (the thing Harry would miss the most) is being held, along with Hermione (for Krum), Cho (for Cedric), and Fleur's sister.

   Harry frees Ron, but refuses to leave the others, despite the insistence of the Merpeople. Cedric and Krum appear and rescue their loved ones, but Fleur never arrives. With little other choice, Harry drags her sister to the surface as well, narrowly avoiding drowning as the gillyweed wears off. Although he was wrong to think the other hostages would be left to die (they would have simply returned to the surface unharmed), his bravery and valour earn him extra points from the judges, who state that he showed great "moral fibre." This puts both Harry and Cedric in first place in the overall points. Ludo Bagman then reveals the third and final task is on
   24 June
   and the champions will learn more about it a month beforehand.

   articles are waiting (Sirius had been stealing discarded newspapers to keep up on current events). They first discuss Winky and what happened at the World Cup. Sirius suggests that whoever stole Harry's wand must have done so while they were watching the game in the Top Box, and is suspicious that
   Barty Crouch
   was looking around for something before he sacked Winky. He then finds it odd that not only did Crouch not show up during the game, but also that he is suddenly indisposed.

   Sirius explains that Crouch was the one who sent him to Azkaban without a trial, as Crouch used to be the Head of the
   Department of Magical Law Enforcement
   and was once poised to become the next
   Minister for Magic
   . During Voldemort's previous reign, Crouch took extreme measures against the Death Eaters, including allowing the Aurors to use the
   Unforgivable Curses
   against them. While this greatly boosted Crouch's popularity and ensured that Crouch would become the next Minister, Crouch's

    son
   </a>
   had been caught with a group of Death Eaters just after Voldemort's downfall. The Death Eaters in question were trying to find Voldemort and help him get his strength back. The youth was given a show trial by his father before being locked up in
   Azkaban
   ; he died a year later. Shortly after Barty Crouch Jnr died, Crouch's
   wife
   died as well. Crouch's popularity dropped heavily after that, as people suspected that Crouch was a bad father. As a result, with Crouch's reputation outside the Ministry destroyed, the Minister for Magic's post went instead to

   Ron brings up Crouch's appearance in Snape's office. Sirius states that doesn't make sense, since Crouch would have kept an eye on Snape as a tournament judge. When Ron and Hermione bicker about whether Snape can be trusted, Sirius partly agrees with Ron, as it is questionable why Dumbledore would trust Snape. Snape was interested in the Dark Arts as a child and hung out with some Slytherin students that became Death Eaters, though he also knows Snape is smart enough to not get caught by the Ministry. Harry then remembers Karkaroff's sudden appearance in their class, though Sirius can't figure out what that was about.
  </p>
  <p key="2cc7d51e-4f87-4e49-a71c-79e1c395a1db">
   Sirius then brings all the questions of these mysterious circumstances together, including why Moody was also searching Snape's office. He asks Ron to send a letter to Percy to find out if there is any news about Crouch. Before they leave, Sirius reminds them not to wander outside Hogwarts at all for safety reasons. On the way back, the trio conclude that the scandal involving his son is the reason Crouch overreacted to seeing Winky being accused of conjuring the Dark Mark. Ron voices how he and Percy are similar. Hermione states Percy would never do what his boss did, but Ron is unconvinced.

   a letter to Sirius Black
   , and overhear Fred and George, who are talking about blackmailing someone that they've tried to reason with. Ron asks whom they are blackmailing, but they make it look like they are joking. After they leave, Ron points out that it is obvious Fred and George are serious about starting a Joke Shop. They are close to graduating, with only one full year left, and they have to make enough money on their own to start one. Hermione suggests telling Percy, but Ron refuses, both because of what Sirius said about Barty Crouch Snr and Percy's similarities to him. Later, they meet up with Moody.

   Dumbledore, Fudge, and Moody leave to examine the school grounds, and Harry is alone in Dumbledore's office. While looking around, notices Dumbledore's
   Pensieve
   , a device that stores memories. Through curiosity, Harry peers in and ends up looking into three of Dumbledore's memories. The first is the trial of Igor Karkaroff, in which he renounces his support of the
   Death Eaters
   and gives the names of existing Death Eaters, including Snape. Dumbledore (in the memory) states that Snape is a spy against Voldemort and is no longer a threat. The second memory shows the trial of
   Ludo Bagman
   , who was accused of passing information to Voldemort, even though he wasn't aware the person he gave the information to was a Death Eater; his popularity quickly clears him. The third is a trial for the
   Lestrange family
   , a group of three, and Crouch's son,
   <a href="Bartemius Crouch Junior.html" key="bed572a9-c4a4-4c2f-9bff-4a4a84b208d6" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">

   Frank Longbottom

  <p key="4311ef24-8ad5-4ad6-bbc7-2c38abbe6b90">
   After Dumbledore explains what happened and shows Harry another of his memories regarding a teenage Bertha Jorkins during her Hogwarts years, Harry explains what happened in Divination. Dumbledore finds Harry's scar pains to be an odd concept and brings up that this is the second time it has hurt, the first being during the summer. This shows Harry that Dumbledore has been talking to Sirius Black, and Dumbledore reveals that it was his idea for Black to hide in the cave outside Hogsmeade.
  </p>
  <p key="188ddc8c-3e90-4e28-85a1-412fd4e91f2c">
   Dumbledore suspects that the reason why Harry's scar hurts is due to the connection that Voldemort's failed curse had created with him. He believes the scar would only hurt when Voldemort were close or was feeling a strong emotion. Dumbledore also explains to Harry that, unlike the Ministry, he believes that the disappearances of Bertha Jorkins, Barty Crouch, and a Muggle by the name of Frank Bryce may be connected to Voldemort.
  </p>

   Dumbledore also explains that Frank and Alice Longbottom are Neville's parents and they went insane due to the Lestranges' attack and that this is the reason why Neville was brought up by his grandmother and why he has such an aversion to the Cruciatus Curse. Dumbledore doesn't know if Crouch Jnr was involved, but he personally requests that Harry does not disclose this information to anyone, saying that Neville himself will share it when he is ready.

   Harry passes on the information he learned from the Pensieve to Ron and Hermione, excluding the details about Neville's parents. Hermione realises this is what Rita Skeeter and Winky meant about Ludo Bagman being a dark wizard. That same night, Harry's hatred of Voldemort reaches a new height because of what he learned from the Pensieve. As the task approaches, Ron and Hermione find time when they are not studying for their final exams to help Harry. Even McGonagall helps by allowing him to practise in her empty classroom during lunchtime. During one practice session, Ron notices Malfoy outside the castle sitting by a tree and doing something odd. Harry and Hermione also see him before they return to practice. Sirius sends Harry messages by owl each day, reminding Harry to focus on what is ahead.

   On the day of the third task, Rita Skeeter releases
   an article claiming Harry is demented and dangerous
   . She uses a quote from Draco Malfoy in the article. This raises some questions between the trio, since the article mentions Harry's scar hurting during Divination. The class takes place in the North Tower and Skeeter is not allowed inside Hogwarts, so she shouldn't have had that information. Hermione finally figures out how Skeeter may be getting her information and leaves to put her theory to the test.

   McGonagall tells the champions that their families have come to watch them complete. Harry doesn't want to meet them, expecting the Dursleys, but instead finds Molly and Bill Weasley. While they give Harry a tour of their knowledge of Hogwarts, Mrs Weasley gets into an argument with
   Amos Diggory
   regarding Harry's popularity in the tournament, before Mrs Diggory asks him to stop. They then mention to Harry that Percy will not be coming this time. After the Barty Crouch incident, which is being kept secret, Percy was hauled in for questioning regarding that the instructions he was receiving, which may not have actually been sent by Barty Crouch. Instead, Cornelius Fudge will be serving as the fifth Triwizard judge in his place.

A second voice orders the stranger to kill Cedric, which he does, leaving Harry frozen with shock and horror.

   Voldemort forces Wormtail to take out his bleeding arm to activate the

   After his Death Eaters arrive, Voldemort spends time criticising them for failing to seek him out during these last thirteen years, even though they knew that he had found a way to escape mortal death. He believes they feared a power greater than his, like that of Albus Dumbledore, which is why they slipped back into normal wizarding society and claimed they were never loyal to Voldemort. Voldemort then rewards Wormtail for aiding with his rebirth by creating a new
   silver hand
   for him.

   Voldemort identifies more Death Eaters, including

Voldemort answers Lucius's question about how he had returned by explaining the protection spell that Lily Potter provided Harry when she died. That is what originally caused his downfall and provided Harry with protection from him, but now that they share the same blood, Voldemort is free to touch Harry. Voldemort then reveals that he fled deep into an Albanian forest, barely alive and without a proper body, surviving by possessing animals until

He gave Cedric the clue to the egg for the second task, knowing that Cedric would tell Harry. Moody's original plan was to have Harry use Neville's herbology book to learn about the gillyweed, but since Harry would not ask for help, Moody purposely set up the conversation with McGonagall about gillyweed so Dobby would get it from Snape's office. Moody also reveals that he was responsible for helping Harry in the third task by dealing with the obstacles, stunning Fleur, and bewitching Krum to take out Cedric.

His mother was dying, and it was his mother's wish that he could escape, so Barty Crouch Jnr and his mother switched places using the Polyjuice Potion. Mrs Crouch died and was buried disguised as him, while Crouch Snr had a private funeral for her to conceal the truth.

   Memory Charm
   on her; this permanently damaged her memory. After Winky persuaded her master to let his son go to the Quidditch World Cup, they arranged to use an
   Invisibility cloak
   to hide Crouch Jnr as he sat in the Top Box. During this event, Crouch Jnr secretly fought the curse and stole Harry's wand when Winky wasn't looking. When the Death Eaters showed up and disrupted the tournament, Barty Crouch Jnr was angry that they weren't loyal to Voldemort. After regaining control he used Harry's wand to summon the Dark Mark, which scared the Death Eaters away. His father fired Winky for failing to watch him and almost letting him escape.

Learning from Bertha about Alastor Moody becoming a teacher at Hogwarts, he and Wormtail captured Moody, allowing Crouch Jnr to be planted at Hogwarts as Moody, with Wormtail keeping an eye on Crouch. He kept Moody alive not only to maintain his disguise, but also learned about his habits so he could fool Dumbledore.

   It is revealed that Crouch Jnr was the Barty Crouch Harry saw on the Marauder's Map, stealing potions ingredients from Snape's office to continue making the Polyjuice Potion. Eventually, Crouch started to fight off the Imperius curse placed upon him and was then kept under home imprisonment by Wormtail under the pretence of being unwell. He managed to escape and travel to Hogwarts to warn Dumbledore of his son's existence. However, using the Marauder's Map, Crouch Jnr was able to intercept and kill him. He then transfigured his father's body into a bone and buried it in Hagrid's yard. Crouch Jnr, as Moody, then offered to take the Triwizard Cup into the maze so he could turn it into a Portkey and complete his master's plan.

She wrote to Rowling asking what was going to happen in the next Harry Potter book as she would not live long enough to read it. The former emailed back, but Natalie had died a day earlier.

When Rowling was later in Canada for a promotional tour she visited the McDonald family. With the exception of people of ancient times, such as

    ". The series had maintained that James Potter was murdered before Lily. Therefore, logically, Lily, the more recently killed of the two, should have emerged from Voldemort's wand before James during the Priori Incantatem scene. However, in the original edition of the book, James Potter came out first, and said, "Hold on, your mother is coming and wants to see you." Rowling had originally written that Lily emerged from the wand first, however, her American editor, in the rush to edit the book, incorrectly pointed this out as an error, and Rowling "changed it without thinking." Subsequent editions of the book corrected the mistake, and Rowling's original order (Lily appearing before James) stands as canon.

    , it says that the first ever World Cup was in 1473, with a match being held every four years. Yet the World Cup in 1994 is number 422. There cannot be 422 world cups in 521 years with a four-year gap in between. Calculated correctly, the World Cup that the Weasleys, Hermione, and Harry attended was actually the 130th, and it should have been held in 1993.

Since Hagrid's years as gamekeeper appeared to have overlapped Molly's years at school, it seemed unlikely that she knew a previous one. The likely explanation of this is that since Hagrid was only thirteen years old when he was expelled, he started out as Ogg's assistant, and was still in this post when Molly started at Hogwarts.
