   one biography
   was published.

   In actuality, Rakepick also worked with the malevolent organisation known as
   R
   , during which she attempted to
   enter
   the
   Buried Vault
   , the last major obstacle before the
   final Cursed Vault
   , but did not succeed.
   She was invited back to the school during the
   1987–1988 school year
   by Professor Dumbledore, the school's
   Headmaster
   , to help put an end to the threat posed by the Vaults.
   At the end of the year, she accepted his offer to assume the position of

   Jacob's sibling
   during their search for the remaining Vaults.

   However, by the end of the next year, Rakepick's true intentions were revealed. She manipulated Jacob's sibling to open the Buried Vault, and when Jacob's sibling and their friends discovered the truth, they managed to defeat Rakepick, forcing her to flee Hogwarts.

   Keeper of Keys and Grounds
   during her student years, she disappeared from the castle for days at the time on more than one occasion.
   During her many trips into the forest, she encountered one or more members of the local
   Centaur colony
   , a negative experience for both parties. Even in adulthood, she resented and distrusted
   centaurs
   in general, warning
   Jacob's sibling
   to be cautious of them.
   Patricia was a firm believer during her time at school that the

   Legilimency
   abilities to open the door. When Jacob was trapped in a portrait, Rakepick forcefully touched the centre column of the Vault, but instead of unlocking the supposed treasures inside, she was transported to the
   Forbidden Forest
   , ending the trip for her. This fiasco would continue to disturb her until another opportunity came years later.

    Professor Dumbledore

   . When it was time for the Headmaster's welcoming speech, however, Dumbledore took his usual place at the
   Owl Lecturn
   : addressing the students, he said that an important part of the learning process was to learn how to identify and overcome dangers, both seen and unseen, as a pretext to praise the older students for their bravery in the face of adversity in light of
   recent
   events
   at the school after someone had tampered with two of the
   Cursed Vaults
   and the hardships they all had endured because of it.

  <p key="e5a146ea-9bee-49d5-b1e7-0be6187414d2">
   While Dumbledore assured his charges that the staff would do their utmost to keep them safe, he also explained that neither he, nor the faculty, had all the answers; stepping aside so Madam Rakepick could take his place behind the lectern, Rakepick thanked the Headmaster for such a warm welcome, commenting on her own age-old disregard for the school rules being part of her surprise at his invitation. After a short introduction of her own, mentioning both her work at Gringotts and how her suspicions about the Cursed Vaults went all the way back to her own education at Hogwarts, she proceeded to affirm her intentions of finding the Cursed Vaults and unveil the secrets within — and urged the students to be forthcoming whenever she might need their assistance, but also also strongly advised them against trying to get in any way involved without her prior permission.

  <p key="7dc2db18-9cdc-4f1d-af1f-ea73012a1caf">
   Charged with anything having to do with the Cursed Vaults, Madam Rakepick was notified when two students were placed in harm's way by wandering mindlessly into the
   Forbidden Forest
   , apparently while under the influence of a somnambulism of some sort. Recognising this as the same
   sleepwalking curse
   that had been unleashed on the school years ago, she visited the victims at the
   Hospital Wing

   girl named
   Tulip Karasu
   . Karasu was being visited by the
   ringleader
   of a group of students that she knew was greatly involved in breaking the curses placed on the last two Vaults that had been meddled with. Overhearing how they were discussing the Vaults and the reason why the curse would make students walk into the Forbidden Forest of all places, a question with potentially dangerous implications, Madam Rakepick finally made her presence known to the two young conspirators.
  </p>
  <p key="dc554e43-3204-4715-a739-933cf1ba78b7">
   Intruding on their conversation, Madam Rakepick said she had been wondering the same thing since the last time the sleepwalking curse had sent students to their deaths via the dangerous beasts inside the forest. Confronted with her eavesdropping, however, she shifted the blame over to them by reminding them that, in no uncertain terms, the Cursed Vaults were no longer their concern. When Madam Rakepick learned the reason
   the visiting student
   wanted to find the Vaults was so they could find their brother
   Jacob
   , who had disappeared shortly after his expulsion for inadvertently endangering the school during his own search for the Vaults, Rakepick changed her mind, suggesting they could help each other. Telling
   Jacob's sibling
   that if they were to help her they should be aware of the dangers involved, Rakepick invited them to the
   Training Grounds
   to learn a new spell that would allow them to properly defend themselves. Rakepick then left to find Miss Karasu's, as she wished to discuss the latter's sleep-walking incident with in private.

   Already there when Jacob's sibling arrived for their lesson, Madam Rakepick, who by then had been informed by the staff that the pupil before her was quite gifted, decided to try and solidify their potential alliance by appealing to their shared experience of embarking on curse-breaking adventures and the understanding of the dangers involved. Going as far as to proclaim them a curse-breaker on equal footing as herself, she went on to emphasise the importance of self-defence. She then trained Jacob's sibling in the use of the
   <a href="Shield Charm.html" key="f690cb49-96ce-4c04-8120-8546352ad0cc" title="Shield Charm">

  </p>
  <p key="a90b4680-cbc4-4480-b5c9-4feeebb6c82e">
   During the first part of the tutorial, Jacob's sibling practised casting the Shield Charm against
   Death Eater dummies
   while Rakepick observed and occasionally offered advice. After sensing that Jacob's sibling was capable enough, she decided to test them, dismissing their concerns that the
   Blasting Curse
   she wanted to use was potentially deadly; as a witch who lived for the thrill, she found that which was not deadly was very dull. Jacob's sibling was able to cast a fully-fledged Shield Charm in time, deflecting the curse. Congratulating them on their success, Rakepick noted that their professors were right to commend their talents, and ended the lesson by saying they were likely to meet again soon, before leaving the training grounds.

As per Dumbledore's instruction, Madam Rakepick was kept well informed of these incidents and began to visit the Hospital Wing on a regular basis to see if there was anything more to be learned from sleepwalking victims who woke up. Rakepick also set up her own network of informants, including

   At some point, Rakepick was informed that
   Jacob's sibling
   had been asking the teachers about her, as well as researching the creatures of the Forbidden Forest. In return, Rakepick made inquiries into Jacob's sibling as well, questioning their classmates such as
   Penny Haywood
   . Finally, Rakepick sent Jacob's sibling a letter arranging a meeting in the
   Artefact Room
   for a private discussion. While not angry with them for snooping, she said that if they had questions about her, they could ask them to her face, as no one in the castle actually knew her as well as they thought they did. She also admitted that she considered them a standout from the student at Hogwarts, by virtue of their considerable talents and their reasons for wanting to find the vaults, and encouraged their pursuit of them. She also suggested they ask
   Professor
   Silvanus Kettleburn
   about how to enter the Dark Forest without being detected, since had spent a considerable amount of time exploring the forest and as such was privy to many of its secrets. Since he had once shared information regarding the forest with Rakepick when she was a student, he might be persuaded to do the same for Jacob's sibling.

   With her search for the Vaults hampered by the sleepwalking curse, Rakepick needed an assistant. She contacted all the students who met her criteria: above average in intelligence and ability, some sort of talent or expertise, and experience with the Cursed Vaults. She gathered her candidates at the Training Grounds to put them through a trial that would determine which of them would become her assistant. Six of her seven choices turned up, with only
   Penny
   declining Rakepick's offer because she felt more like a potion-maker than a curse-breaker. When questioned by
   Ismelda Murk
   as to why anyone would want to be her assistant, Madam Rakepick hinted that, she would be teaching her assistant powerful magic the likes of which they could not learn from any of their professors. She used the
   Blasting Curse
   on a
   Mechanical Death Eaters
   to illustrate her point.

  <p key="9be0fab7-9678-4516-a082-a7af56750282">
   It did not take long before the chosen six were called to assemble at Training Grounds a second time. Rather than teaching them another curse, Rakepick said they were to
   duel
   each other, and encouraged them to bypass the usual restrictions by using

   Potions
   and even physical violence if that was what they had to do in order to win, explaining that she expected them to from one another that evening. The last one standing would become her assistant. She let Jacob's sibling pick their opponent first, and after they had triumphed over their chosen adversary,
   Rakepick ended the session, asking the victor to stay behind to see if they would be interested in a private lesson to teach them a spell she believed to "align with [your]

   Later, Rakepick let Professor Kettleburn use
   Sickleworth
   as a teaching aid in his
   Care of Magical Creatures
   class on
   Nifflers
   . Afterwards, introduced the students to her pet, and said he had been assigned to her by the management of

   to burrow underground for treasure hidden at cursed sites. She also told the students how she came up with his name and affectionately described his sweet disposition and destructive capabilities. After class had ended, Rakepick brushed off Kettleburn's expressions of gratitude, simply commenting that everyone should be aware of how inadvisable it was to keep Nifflers as pets. She was taken somewhat by surprise when he replied that he had twelve Nifflers of his own, which had cost him his house, boat and favourite peg-leg, but he was eager to get more.

  <p key="5c0a6fa0-15ae-402a-ae5c-83a0976facef">
   As part of her search for the Cursed Vaults, Rakepick interrogated the castle's

   Jacob's sibling
   one night in the
   Courtyard

   Penny Haywood

   Prefect
   Bill Weasley
   , and informed him that if he wished to be a Curse-Breaker like herself, becoming
   Head Boy
   in his final year would help him reach that goal. Shortly thereafter, having resumed her duties of searching for the Cursed Vaults on her own, Rakepick was content with observing the students in the Great Hall. Upon spotting Jacob's sibling, she inquired about Mr
   Bilton Bilmes
   , the proprietor of
   Zonko's Joke Shop
   , whom she had encountered on one of her trips to
   Hogsmeade
   , as she thought there was something "peculiar" about him.

   Jacob's sibling sent Rakepick an owl, requesting another meeting at the Training Grounds; they were searching for a jewelled arrow head that belonged to the
   centaurs
   , and wanted Rakepick's advice on the matter. While happy to assist, she nevertheless insisted that she would only do so once they had improved their proficiency in combative magic. When asked why there had to be a prerequisite, Rakepick said that she helping them more than they knew.  After seeing Jacob's sibling work on their offensive and defensive spell-casting to her satisfaction, Madam Rakepick complimented them on their improving skill before returning to the matter at hand. On the subject of the arrowhead, she suggested that it might be buried somewhere inside the castle, reminding them that with magic, one could easily bury something without dirt or shovel. She also promised that if they proved themselves capable of caring for a Niffler, she would lend them her own to help them find the arrowhead.

  <p key="ea24054d-51a1-4abd-bb43-4b262bca16c7">
   One time after Defence Against the Dark Arts class, Rakepick told Jacob's sibling there had been rumours of a
   portrait of a
   Cursed Vault
   hidden in Hogwarts.
   Jacob's sibling then went on to search, but instead of a portrait, they brought back a parchment, which Rakepick told them was the
   Marauder's Map
   .
   At night, Rakepick explained to Jacob's sibling all about the map. It was her belief that the Map would show them the location of
   the man who attacked
   Mundungus Fletcher
   who would have the portrait, the key to the
   next Cursed Vault
   . They opened the Map and saw a person moving very fast, but before Jacob's sibling could see their name, Rakepick pocketed the Map.
  </p>
  <p key="ce932a84-5446-4233-a026-278677bb08d3">
   Jacob's sibling did however see the location of that person, and after some investigation, they found one of
   Jacob's notebooks
   , which recorded
   Jacob
   's collaboration with Rakepick, Rakepick's fear of
   the Cabal
   , and that she had saved Jacob's sibling's life years ago.
   They talked to Rakepick about them, but Rakepick denied everything. Days later, Jacob's sibling asked her again, but she still refused to divulge anything. They then wanted to duel Rakepick to show her their strength, but she made the first move and broke
   their wand
   .
   Rakepick then accompanied them to

  <p key="6bda1b8f-9588-4ee6-ab4c-b4e82b16820b">
   Rakepick met Jacob's sibling again when they were looking for people to practise
   Legilimency
   . She pretended to welcome them to break into her mind, but then used

   After
   Rowan Khanna
   was mentally possessed to behave like the
   unidentified cloaked figure
   and knocked unconsciousness by
   Ben Copper
   , Rakepick deliberated with Jacob's sibling and found
   <a href="Percy Weasley.html" key="88a45676-8c14-42d2-b623-d19946c636e1" title="Percy Weasley">
    Percy Weasley

   to be possibly responsible for Rowan's behaviour. She then spoke to Percy, and though she didn't think Percy had the ability to cast the Imperius Curse, her instincts told her he was somehow intimately involved. Rakepick wanted to teach Jacob's sibling the
   Cruciatus Curse
   , but they didn't want to learn an
   Unforgivable Curse
   like it. She then demonstrated on a nearby dark wizard, who immediately screamed in pain. Witnessing this didn't change Jacob's sibling's mind, but Rakepick still believed it would be useful under certain circumstances.
  </p>
  <p key="973ed437-3dd8-49b3-8aa1-6059c1afa7c1">
   When the castle apparently had a
   rat
   problem in the upstairs corridors, Rakepick talked to
   Professor Kettleburn
   who suggested purchasing some
   <a href="Cat.html" key="0d7b496a-78fb-4477-845b-9dac1022be7d" title="Cat">
    cats
   </a>
   . At one point, when Rakepick arrived at the upstairs corridors, she heard Jacob's sibling talking to a man (who was in fact
   <a href="Peter Pettigrew.html" key="e6868631-2a1e-4d14-beed-cb9b8f9b3080" title="Peter Pettigrew">

  <p key="fbbcdf8b-43c7-4889-be3b-aa861746c7bb">
   After executing a
   delicate plan
   , Jacob's sibling was successfully in possession of the
   vault portrait
   . They presented it to Rakepick, who told them they would be facing a
   dragon
   in the next Cursed Vault. Due to it being highly efficient in fighting dragons, Rakepick taught Jacob's sibling, Merula and Bill the
   Conjunctivitis Curse
   .
   She also lent Merula the
   Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom
   , but when she walked in, Merula had cast a dangerous
   Fiendfyre
   which she couldn't control, so Rakepick extinguished it for her.
   When the time of entering the next Cursed Vault was near, Rakepick arranged a private lecture on
   Portkeys
   for Jacob's sibling, Bill, Merula and Ben (who would all be entering the Vault) and explained that the vault portrait should be a Portkey that would travel that night. Later, Rakepick conversed with Jacob's sibling in private and asked them to take the lead should she die.
  </p>
  <p key="862969c6-5a3a-4b1d-bad9-882206f9746c">
   Rakepick and the students waited for Ben for some while, and when he came, they grasped the vault portrait and travelled to the chamber outside the
   Buried Vault
   . After searching, Jacob's sibling wanted to try opening a door on the portrait wall, but Rakepick prevented them. When Ben simply knocked on the door, the
   Hungarian Horntail
   appeared and stepped out of the portraits. The Vault started to collapse, and while Rakepick cast the
   Slowing Charm
   on the falling rocks, Jacob's sibling used the
   Conjunctivitis Curse
   on the Horntail, thwarting several of its attempts to attack and leading to their victory.
  </p>
  <p key="202fe287-1018-43a1-999f-4b72363d0f09">
   The door on the portraits still wouldn't open, but Jacob's sibling reported that something was in their head, which Rakepick recognised as the door using Legilimency due to being enchanted and suggested they do the same to the door. This successfully unlocked the door, and it was also at this moment did Rakepick knock the students all down and reveal her true nature. She recounted the story of her first visit, and when they tried to stand up to her, she shoved them down with simple wand strikes. She admitted that the students were only used by her as dragon baits, except for Jacob's sibling, whose Legimilency abilities she needed to open the door. When Merula attempted to stop her from killing all of them, Rakepick used the
   Cruciatus Curse
   on her. This escalated the conflict, and Jacob's sibling pulled out a bottle of
   Garrotting Gas
   and smashed it in front of Rakepick, making her choke and
   Disapparate
   out of the room.

   While a self-declared daredevil with little regard for rules or restrictions and with a strong sense of entitlement, Patricia Rakepick was a highly intelligent and magically gifted witch, as evidenced by both her top performance at Hogwarts as well as her later achievements in life. Very secure in her own judgement and immensely confident in her own abilities, she would often eye those with whom she conversed with a look of gleeful smugness, yet could demonstrate a sudden temper or disdain towards those of whom she did not think very highly, such as
   Ben Copper
   , whom she cruelly singled out during her evaluation of a group of students from which she wanted to pick an assistant for her sanctioned search for the Cursed Vaults. While she was sorted into Gryffindor upon arriving at Hogwarts, Severus Snape noted her to be unusually cunning for a member of that house.

  <p key="8ab11439-abc1-44eb-82ea-4ca372377b01">
   According to
   Silvanus Kettleburn

   Sickleworth
   was, according to Professor Kettleburn, the most well-behaved Niffler he had ever seen.

   Beneath her veneer of cordiality, lurked a personality that was ambitious, cruel, sadistic and downright evil. Hungry for the power of the Cursed Vaults, Rakepick had no qualms with how she attempted to achieve this goal nor with whom she associated in the process, having joined the mysterious and intensely malevolent "R" and manipulating young and eager wizards and witches in this regard. She did not in fact care for her young charges in any way beyond their immediate or potential usefulness to her and willingly discarded them the moment she deemed them liabilities rather than assets.

   An intensely brutal and sadistic witch, Rakepick subjected her most loyal and trusting disciple, Merula Snyde, to repeated and prolonged torture with the Cruciatus Curse, which required a genuine willingness to inflict pain and enjoy doing so, also verbally taunting the poor girl for her misplaced faith. She later also tried to use the Killing Curse, which again requires a genuine willingness to kill and disregard for the life to be extinguished, on Ben Copper when he managed to actually hurt her during a duel. The only reason it didn't kill Ben was because of Rowan Khanna jumping in and pushing him away, taking the curse themselves and dying as a result, but Rakepick still showed herself as an intensely malevolent witch by not only being willing to murder young teenagers, but also to taunt Rowan's best friend with the reminder that "R" had intended to kill one of their friends.

    , which served as a further testament to her ability of fending off
    Dark Magic
    . In addition to an impressive academic record, she was also said to have spent as much time in the
    Forbidden Forest
    during her time as a pupil once she knew how to enter undetected, and her skill in the subject undoubtedly was of great help in keeping the dangerous creatures that dwelled therein at bay. As a matter of fact, Madam Rakepick's abilities in fending off the Dark Arts was sufficiently potent for

    Professor
    of Hogwarts, during which, she effectively taught her students about dark creatures and defensive and offensive spell-work, much to their benefit, considering how little they had learnt with previous teachers. Her reputation on fighting the Dark Arts was such that her presence alone made a group of
    dark wizards
    wary, one of whom she easily subdued and they were not willing to challenge her.

She was able to easily defeat Jacob's sibling, Merula and Ben in their duel in the Forbidden Forest and Ben only survived because Rowan saved him at the cost of their own life.
    Rakepick later defeated Jacob and Ben simultaneously, though not without effort, but she ultimately lost in a fierce duel against

    , a spell of potentially lethal effect if used against another living being, had served her well in dealing with enchanted objects, creatures and rivals and later encouraged them to follow her example by including curses in their repertoire for combative magic.

   , another trouble-making Gryffindor. Whilst it is uncertain what he thought of Rakepick's initial claims about the existence of the fabled Cursed Vaults as a student, he did acknowledge that she was remarkably ambitious for a Gryffindor, and by no means stupid. By the time he had replaced
   Horace Slughorn
   as the school's
   Potions Master
   , Rakepick was already a notable curse-breaker and building her career on eliminating her competition. Wary of her true intentions, when Albus Dumbledore invited her back to help break the curses plaging the school and its denizens, their old rivalry immediately reignited, and Snape immediately went about trying to uncover whatever ulterior motives she might have, suspecting that she wanted to use the Vaults to take control of Hogwarts.

   From that moment on, it is known that Snape and Rakepick were engaging in a subtle battle of wits, and even used students to spy on one another. Recognising that Rakepick regarded
   one of the pupils
   as a potential rival in her quest to find the Vaults, and aware how Rakepick dealt with rivals, Snape cleverly had said student serving as his spy to shift her attention over on him to protect the student as a supposed mastermind of the youngster's actions, while also using the ploy as a tool to try and learn what Rakepick was up to and expose her to Dumbledore, the one person who they knew for a certainty would be able to put a stop to her plot, whatever it might be.
