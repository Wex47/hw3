   When Tom Marvolo Riddle was in his fifth year at Hogwarts, he achieved his goal of locating
   Salazar Slytherin
   's Chamber of Secrets and used his ability to speak
   Parseltongue
   to open it. He further used this language ability to order the Chamber's Basilisk to terrorise the school and hunt down the
   Muggle-born
   students. Eventually one of the Muggle-borns, a
   <a href="Ravenclaw.html" key="411a2a78-84e7-4132-854b-59470f02f561" title="Ravenclaw">
    Ravenclaw
   </a>
   girl named
   Myrtle Warren
   , was killed.
   Riddle would later use this murder to
   infuse
   the journal with a piece of his
   soul
   , and transformed it into his first Horcrux.
  </p>
  <p key="2a48fe6c-2a7f-42b0-b368-8acf02a063c7">
   After Myrtle's death, Albus Dumbledore, then
   Professor

   , began suspecting Riddle. Knowing it was no longer safe to open the Chamber, and that the school might be shut down if the perpetrator was not caught, Riddle framed

   and his pet
   Acromantula
   Aragog
   for the crimes, and earned himself an award for Special Services to the school.
   He imbued the diary with other powers, so that the Chamber could be opened again in the future.
  </p>
  <p key="3288e772-4771-4d6e-ad3f-e98c532f453a">
   In the following years, Riddle also questioned
   Potions Master
   ,
   Horace Slughorn
   about the properties of a Horcrux and how one might create multiple ones. Influenced by Riddle's charisma and believing his own wisdom was being admired, Slughorn told Riddle what little he knew on the subject. Based from Slughorn's information, Riddle became positive on the possibility of creating more than one Horcrux, and became confident of using the diary as a weapon instead of the intended safeguard.

  <p key="baaae5ce-deec-431a-addf-265266364d57">
   Some time during the
   First Wizarding War
   , Lord Voldemort entrusted the diary to Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy. The plan was to use the diary to reopen the Chamber, but Voldemort fell before that plan came to fruition, although Voldemort never told Lucius that the diary contained  a fragment of his
   soul
   , instead simply making it appear to be cleverly
   charmed
   . However, Malfoy still possessed the diary and, in 1992, he planted it on Ginny Weasley, hoping to kill three birds with one stone by sabotaging Ginny's
   father
   , purge the school of
   Muggle-borns
   , and eliminate an incriminating
   Dark
   artefact.
  </p>
  <p key="29bbbee1-56b5-44d9-a6a0-74fa03a0bcfa">
   Because Lucius was unaware that the diary was actually a container for his master's soul fragment, he treated it with such light-handedness. When the Weasleys and Harry left to

   </a>
   , Ginny accidentally left the diary behind at the Burrow. Just before they got to the motorway, she remembered the diary and demanded to be allowed to go back and get it.
   She soon learned how to use the diary to communicate with Tom Riddle, though she was unaware that he was Lord Voldemort, or if he was even real. Ginny wrote all of her deepest feelings and secrets in the diary, including her feelings of infatuation toward Harry Potter.
  </p>
  <p key="59f8928d-dda2-4fba-9e74-60a1e93cae99">
   Her emotional vulnerability allowed the fragment of Voldemort's soul within the diary to gain partial control of her mind and force her to re-open the Chamber of Secrets. Ginny was forced not only to paint terrifying threats in the school corridors using

   but also to release the Basilisk within the Chamber and strangle the school roosters to protect the Basilisk,
   all the while in a sort of trance, and never knew what she had been doing. The Basilisk attacked several members of the Hogwarts community, including

   Harry heard strange voices in the walls of Hogwarts, which exhorted the urge to kill.
   Harry followed the voices through the Hogwarts corridors until he came upon the second floor girls' lavatory. It was here that he discovered the water-logged diary, which Ginny had discarded when she suspected that it was she who had petrified the Muggle-borns, and that she finally realised that the diary was the cause. Soon enough, Harry was communicating with Tom Riddle, who showed him a memory within the diary, in which Riddle confronted Rubeus Hagrid about the keeping of a dangerous pet. This implied to Harry that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets, but Riddle was merely using Hagrid's pet
   Acromantula
   , Aragog, as a scapegoat so Hogwarts would not be closed down.

  <p key="b07beb43-cc10-40d8-b5c0-fb1951c9cb86">
   Later, Ginny, having seen the diary amongst Harry's books, stole the diary from among Harry's room in the
   Gryffindor Boys' Dormitory
   .
   She feared that Riddle would tell Harry about her feelings toward him, and shortly thereafter went missing. She was forced to paint a threat against her life on the walls of a hallway and sealed herself inside the Chamber. Hogwarts was again under threat of being closed down.

   made their way into the Chamber. Lockhart, who had no plans to actually fight the Basilisk, attacked the students with Ron's own broken wand, which backfired on him, and
   wiped
   his memory. Harry continued into the Chamber, where he discovered an unconscious Ginny next to Tom Riddle, who was gaining strength and form. Concealing his true nature as a Horcrux, Riddle claimed to be a memory of his younger self, and revealed the truth of his identity and plans to Harry and unleashed the Basilisk.

   . Harry then took one of the Basilisk's fangs and stabbed the diary with it. This successfully destroyed the Horcrux, as
   basilisk venom
   was one of the few substances with that ability. When he later explained about the diary's true nature to Dumbledore, the latter was privately concerned, as no mere memory could just possess a girl and eventually take physical form,
   and he suspected the diary was a Horcrux. Because of how careless this Horcrux was treated (after all, its purpose was to keep its owner immortal), Dumbledore theorised that Riddle had created more Horcruxes, something that had never been done before.
  </p>
  <p key="f37b3ed6-19e0-48c0-b57d-87dc0efc8be6">
   Lord Voldemort was unaware that this Horcrux had been destroyed, until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy (who did not know the diary was a Horcrux) shortly after his return to power in June of
   1995
   , due to the portion of the soul being separated from his body for such a long time. Despite the known risks of using the diary as a weapon instead of a safeguard, Voldemort was nevertheless furious to learn of its destruction,
   due to Lucius implementing the plan without Voldemort's say-so in order to dispose of the diary for his own benefit while also attempting to destroy the

   and Dumbledore's reputation, as well as getting rid of an incriminating Dark Arts artefact (the Ministry was conducting a search at the time); this was one of the many reasons that he lost trust in the Malfoy family and why Lucius was punished and demoted.
  </p>
  <p key="65d62d3a-8c31-431f-8302-e428e0453f81">
   Although Voldemort was unaware of the diary's destruction until Malfoy reported it to him, he attributed this to his non-corporeal status at the time of its loss; as a result, he took no additional precautions to safeguard the remaining Horcruxes, and assumed that they were safe and undamaged until the break-in to Gringotts confirmed to him that someone else was hunting them.

   As a Horcrux, the diary allowed a writer to communicate with the memory of the sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle, merely through writing on the journal's blank pages.
   The diary could transport the reader into a realm of memories, much like the
   Pensieve
   .
   The diary was also able to siphon the life force from a reader and transfer it to Riddle's stored memory. This act was an endeavour to create a physical body for the sixteen-year-old Soul of Tom Riddle. The closer a writer became to the memory of Tom Riddle emotionally, the more power the diary would acquire over him or her. As this diary contained Riddle's soul, it also housed his magical powers, including his ability to speak Parseltongue, even by possessing the writer to speak it, which was instrumental in reopening the Chamber of Secrets.

  <p key="c86f0f41-e1c5-4760-82d1-3b6dfc2706a7">
   It was unclear whether other Horcruxes include any of these same abilities; however,
   Salazar Slytherin's Locket
   had a negative physical and emotional effect on those who wore it,
   and
   Marvolo Gaunt's Ring
   was fatally
   cursed
   Albus Dumbledore.
   Also, it was unknown if Riddle had placed powerful
   enchantments
   to protect the diary from being destroyed by conventional means, as he did with all of his other Horcruxes, but it was highly likely that this was indeed the case. Ginny Weasley tried to flush it down the toilet, but it came back perfect as new.
   When Harry's ink bottles shattered and drenched all of his other textbooks, the diary alone remained dry and unmarked.

This manipulative little book, the temptation particularly for a young girl to pour out her heart to a diary, which is never something I was prone to, but my sister was. The power of something that answers you back, and at the time that I wrote that I'd never been in an Internet chat room. But I've since thought "Well it's very similar." Just typing your deepest thoughts into the ether and getting answers back, and you don't know who is answering you. And so that was always a very scary image to me, in the book, and I thought it worked very well in the film. You could understand when he started writing to see these things coming back to him, and the power of that, that secret friend in your pocket."

    According to Dumbledore, Voldemort tended to use extremely valuable trophies or sentimentally important artefacts to create his Horcruxes, and that the reason for this diary was chosen was due to it proving him to be the Heir of Slytherin. Otherwise, the fact that the diary was a common artefact made it very ironic to be considered valuable in Voldemort's eyes, especially when it was manufactured by his hated enemies: Muggles. However, the diary was also likely a different case given that it also was intended as a weapon and looked innocently enough to lure its victim to write in it.
