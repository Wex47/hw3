   Supposedly certain people, such as parents of students, were supportive of this post, as they feared that Dumbledore's eccentric decisions may have had a negative impact on the students and were glad that the Ministry was keeping an eye on the situation; however,
   Lucius Malfoy
   , who gave an interview of his support of the post's creation under the false pretence of caring for the school's future, was in truth desiring for this action to discredit Dumbledore. Other people, such as
   Griselda Marchbanks
   and
   Tiberius Ogden
   , were outraged by this post's formation, as they supported Dumbledore and knew full well that the High Inquisitor was nothing more than an excuse for Fudge to usurp control over Hogwarts from the headmaster. As a result, they themselves were discredited by Fudge and the

   also answered her prying questions rather haughtily during his inspection. Despite McGonagall and Snape's apathetic and cold treatment of her, Umbridge could not deny that they were good teachers and knew their subjects, and thus they were not sacked.

   Sybill Trelawney

   probation
   and then fired from the post of

   's inspections in his
   Care of Magical Creatures
   classes went no better, as after he barely excused himself for his long-term absence, Umbridge's prejudice for
   half-breeds
   led her to be biased against Hagrid's first inspection, acting as though she could not understand his language while asking extremely offensive questions to students,
   and then placed him under probation as well; this led Hagrid's subsequent performances to falter, as he was distracted by her continued presence, and eventually he was ousted from his position as Care of Magical Creatures teacher.

  <p key="339cce3c-484a-4f96-9f2b-13d384cf6e7a">
   Umbridge seemed certain that she would achieve a dismissal, and attempted to accelerate the process by being present in both Trelawney's and Hagrid's classes. She proceeded to distract them with difficult questions and peer pressure, thus unfairly giving them no opening for improvement that contradicts the purpose of a probation. In the end both teachers failed their final evaluation at the end of the probationary period and were subsequently sacked.

   While Trelawney's dismissal became something of a spectacle, with her crying in anguish in the Great Hall and her luggage thrown unceremoniously, Hagrid's was more discreet but violent, with Umbridge bringing in corrupt
   Aurors
   to deal with him, only for him to escape. The former was witnessed by pretty much the entire school, while the latter was by the
   Astronomy
   O.W.L. examinees.
   As Dumbledore was still headmaster when Trelawney was removed, he allowed her to remain in Hogwarts as a resident, as the High Inquisitor had no authority to remove fired teachers from the grounds;
   Hagrid, on the other hand, was forced to flee after a brief but violent
   struggle
