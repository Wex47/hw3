   and constructed a fortress on the island, luring Muggle sailors there to torture and murder them. After his death, the various
   concealment charms
   placed on the island faded, and the Ministry became aware of the mysterious site's existence.

  <p key="eed2ddf8-0781-4342-b59d-4ed8df8dc1f6">
   Those who entered the deserted fortress to investigate discovered, among other horrors, an infestation of Dementors. Fearing the reprisal of these dark entities should anyone try to evict them, the Ministry decided to let the sizeable colony remain, unmolested and unchecked.

   When
   Damocles Rowle
   was elected Minister for Magic in
   1718
   , he insisted on utilising Azkaban's dark pedigree, seeing the Dementors as a potential asset: putting them to work as guards would save expense, time, and lives. This plan was eventually put into motion and, despite protests, Azkaban remained the prison of the wizarding world right up until the

   as the guards of Azkaban, as the arrangement allowed them to feed on the emotions of the prisoners within its walls. Somewhere between
   1733
   and
   1747
   , Minister
   Eldritch Diggory
   visited Azkaban and was horrified at the sheer despair and insanity that the Dementors induced within the prisoners. He formed a committee to find alternative solutions, the least of which was to remove the Dementors, which met opposition from those who feared a mainland invasion by the dark creatures if they were deprived of their food source. Alas, Diggory died of Dragon Pox while in office, and thus the campaign to find an alternative to Azkaban's Dementors stalled. Though their primary function was to guard Azkaban, Dementors also performs other services for the Ministry, such as being sent to guard other locations, escort prisoners to trial or even hunt down certain criminals.

   Although many in the wizarding world felt that the Dementors were necessary to keeping the wizarding world safe from Voldemort's supporters and other dangerous criminals, some believed the Dementors to be inherently fickle and untrustworthy.

    Patronus Charm

   The charm summoned a Patronus, a magical manifestation of good will and happiness, providing varied levels of protection against the Dementors' influence, based on the caster's strength as a wizard. With sufficient ability, a single wizard could hold off dozens, if not hundreds, of Dementors with a single corporeal Patronus, as Harry Potter demonstrated during his third year at
   <a href="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.html" key="d6594597-1607-444d-bef5-e76510f83e8d" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">

  <p key="3cc7d3f8-aa7f-49a6-9028-73b635193aa9">
   As the Patronus was not alive, the Dementor couldn't feed on it. Only when summoned by an experienced caster would the Patronus take the form of an animal significant in some way to the individual. While the lower level Patronus was more amorphous and ephemeral, corporeal Patronuses chased down Dementors and forced them to flee the vicinity.
   An incorporeal Patronus only slowed a Dementor down,
   as if the creature was walking through quicksand, and tended not to last long, but could eventually give the caster time to escape.

   The effects of a Dementor's happiness-draining powers could also be resisted if one focused not on happy thoughts, but on obsessions, or other things that gave one strength without exactly making one feel better. For example, Sirius managed to avoid going mad in the Dementors' custody and eventually plan an escape by focusing on the fact that he was innocent and didn't belong in Azkaban, and later that

   This implies that there were, indeed, other methods. Probably one of them was reducing the effects and conditions of the habitat that Dementors preferred, which would cause them to be driven away. Other methods might include the use of
   Felix Felicis
   to increase a wizard's luck, or with the use of

   The mood-enhancing properties of
   chocolate
   were well known in both the Muggle and wizarding worlds. Chocolate was the perfect antidote for anyone who had been overcome in the presence of Dementors, which sucked hope and happiness out of their surroundings. Chocolate could only be a short-term remedy, however. Finding ways to fight off Dementors — or depression — were essential if one was to become permanently happier. Excessive chocolate consumption couldn't benefit either Muggle or wizard.

    states "the only people that know what's under a Dementor's hood are in no state to tell us" (being soulless) but from the fifth movie and onward, they are shown without any hood at all. This is likely due to change of directors.

   Another notable difference is that the Dementors in the films can
   fly freely
   . This aspect was completely absent from the books, where they were merely gliding over the ground. This is most noticeable when the Dementors were intruding the first Quidditch match in the Prisoner of Azkaban. In the book, the Dementors were described as standing in the stadium, while in the film, they were purposefully pursuing a broomstick-riding Harry Potter. Because of this, the corporeal

   Furthermore, the Dementors from the films appear to have a much more drastic effect on the environment compared to their book counterparts. In the films, the nearby surroundings of a Dementor are immediately covered by a layer of ice and any plant in the vicinity almost instantly withers away. The only explicit effect the book described Dementors were having in the environment is that they are accompanied by a cold mist. The first Dementor Harry encountered in the third film was able to open the

   without touching it, causing it to slide open with a wave of its hand, with some wizards and witches in the films also being able to perform similar feats. Also, the first Dementor seen in the fifth film was able to effortlessly lift Harry off the ground by the neck and pin him to a wall, showing great strength.
