   Alan Rickman was born on 21 February 1946 on a council estate in South Hammersmith,

   to a working class family, the son of Margaret Doreen Rose (née Bartlett; b. 6 Dec. 1911 in Pontypridd, Glamorganshire, Wales—d. 16 Feb. 1997 in Leicester, Leicestershire),
   a housewife, and Bernard William Rickman (b. April 1914 in Fulham, Middlesex—d. 9 Sep. 1954),
   a factory worker, painter and decorator.
   At the time of his older brother, David's birth, he had been working as a WWII aircraft fitter.
   His ancestry was English, Irish and Welsh; his father was Catholic and his mother was a Methodist.
  </p>
  <p key="186bd7ac-d620-49e4-8f75-bc7916bbfde7">
   Before his mother married his birth father, she was married to Reginald Cory in 1931 in Hammersmith
   before unofficially separating from him and marrying Bernard Rickman in 1940.
  </p>
  <p key="980d59c3-a5e9-4b84-b07e-196acafed67a">
   He had one elder brother, David Bernard John (b. Sep. 1944),
   a graphic designer who married Christine J. Morrissey in 1970
   and live together in Watford, Hertfordshire;
   a younger brother, Michael Keith (b. 21 Nov. 1947), a professional tennis coach as well as a Councillor on Harborough District Council of the conservative party and lives in Medbourne, Leicestershire;
   and a younger sister, Sheila J. Innes (b. 15 Feb. 1950).
   Like Alan, she won a scholarship to Godolphin and Latymer School, she attended Kingsway Princeton College, London, currently works as an office manager for a company named PRN and lived in Bordon, Hampshire with her husband and daughters until 2009.
  </p>
  <p key="050e757d-b09d-4a20-a655-f4c2a467982f">
   When Rickman was eight, his father died of lung cancer on 9 September 1954 at age forty,
   leaving his mother to raise him and his three siblings mostly alone. She married again in 1960 to Kenneth W.J. Edginton,
   but divorced his stepfather after three years. "There was one love in her life", Rickman later said of this.
  </p>
  <p key="4d348819-9178-4506-89a6-4c26c08af0df">
   Rickman attended Derwentwater Primary School, in Acton, London, a school that followed the Montessori method of education.
   He attended Latymer Upper School on a scholarship and then went on to study Graphic Design at Chelsea College Of Art and Design.
  </p>
  <p key="a84f4558-e8c1-4c9c-a000-3b19cdf36654">
   After three years at Chelsea College, Rickman did graduate studies at the Royal College of Art and started a successful graphics design business with friends called Graphiti, before his love of the theatre led him to seek an audition with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA). He received a scholarship allowing him to study at RADA, which enabled him to start his professional acting career which lasted nearly 40 years, a career which has spanned stage, screen and television and lapped over into directing, as well.

   Rickman continued to show dismay over journalists repeatedly labelling him as a villain actor, citing the fact that he had not portrayed a stock villain character since the Sheriff of Nottingham in 1991, and pointing out that he had continued to portray characters of complex and varying emotions, and didn't think it was fair to assign characters a label of good or evil, hero or villain. The media also dogged him in later years for his thoughts on his role in the

However, he is very much admired by his Harry Potter fans for the protection he showed for his character in the series, as he continued to cite a fear of ruining the mystery of the character for the fans by talking about him.

In the video Sharleen Spiteri (the lead singer of Texas) danced the tango with Alan: the clip was nominated for Best British Video at the Brit Awards. Sharleen said about the choice of Alan for the clip; "I thought it had to be someone who would be believable, who would rip your coat off and pull you into the tango, so I thought Alan Rickman!" In 2015, Rickman and Spiteri resumed company for production of Texas' song "Start a Family", in which Rickman not only starred in the video but also provided vocals.
