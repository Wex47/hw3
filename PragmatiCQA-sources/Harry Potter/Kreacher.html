    Lord Voldemort

   Regulus Black
   that he needed a house-elf, Regulus volunteered Kreacher, saying it would be an honour to serve the Dark Lord. Voldemort took Kreacher to the

    Crystal Cave
   </a>
   and forced him to drink the
   potion
   in the basin so that Voldemort could place

   drank) caused Kreacher to have nightmarish delusions, intense stomach pains and made him dehydrated. Voldemort then left, leaving Kreacher to drink from the lake (as any

    Inferi
   </a>
   . However, Voldemort, in his arrogance, had never cared to learn that House Elves can apparate out of locations that Wizards and Witches cannot, so Kreacher, using his own
   special type of magic
   and not contained by the enchantments on the cave, was able to
   <a href="Apparition.html" key="1789c6d3-c5e6-49f5-a4ed-759487cc5067" title="Apparition">

  </p>
  <p key="c99a7737-7986-4608-ae19-9e6c45ddf98e">
   Regulus later had Kreacher take him back to the

   himself and ordered Kreacher to switch Slytherin's Locket with a
   fake locket
   and then go home and destroy the "real" locket, leaving Regulus to die in the cave. For the last few seconds Kreacher was there, he saw the
   <a href="Inferius.html" key="52766fdc-d9a5-41d3-8fd8-417485ef0b69" title="Inferius">

   . Regulus also ordered Kreacher to never tell his family what had happened to him. Kreacher left as ordered but was unable to destroy the locket, despite his many attempts. This inability to complete an order of his master may have driven him to insanity, explaining his muttering and devotion to his
   mistress' painting
   .

   Kreacher was considered somewhat of a liability by the Order of the Phoenix, who used the Blacks' house as headquarters; as a house-elf, Kreacher overheard sensitive information, but was forbidden to disclose it. However, in December 1995, when he witnessed Harry and the Weasley children arrive by
   Portkey
   after
   Arthur Weasley
   was attacked, Sirius told him to get out of the kitchen. Kreacher took this to mean that he was allowed to leave the house and went to the
   Malfoy family
   , who were close relatives of the Blacks, and told

   Battle of the Department of Mysteries
   in which Sirius was murdered by Bellatrix.

  <p key="4e6c8c2e-ba09-4f92-8e80-2f3dd63d613d">
   Kreacher was very loyal to all the members of the Black family except
   Sirius Black
   , whom he hated because he treated Kreacher poorly. He had a strong bond with Sirius' brother,
   Regulus Black
   and was devastated by his death. Kreacher was usually hostile, bitter and miserable and had a habit of insulting people, including his masters. He frequently called
   <a href="Hermione Granger.html" key="d9e2c5fe-9dc4-4435-97cd-db8ec95f4bb1" title="Hermione Granger">

   a
   Mudblood

  </p>
  <p key="6f69d22d-b9b1-4338-9823-e99966eed230">
   Like most members of the Black family, Kreacher believed that
   Muggle-borns
   and
   <a href="Blood traitor.html" key="cb093f9a-be2e-418d-b449-4d603844e9e0" title="Blood traitor">
    blood traitors
   </a>
   were scum. Because of this, he frequently insulted Hermione even though she tried to be nice to him. However, he gradually grew more respectful towards both Muggle-borns and blood traitors, as is seen by his giving Hermione a respectful salute prior to the
   infiltration of the Ministry of Magic
   . Kreacher was also very loyal to people who treated him with kindness and respect, particularly Regulus Black. He later grew loyal to Harry Potter and started to be friendly towards Harry, Ron and Hermione. However, he was disloyal to those who treated him poorly. This ultimately led to him being partially responsible for the death of Sirius Black. Had Sirius treated Kreacher the same way his brother had, his death could have been avoided.
  </p>
  <p key="11fe789c-a7e3-4398-be62-3cec852f54d0">
   While he assisted Regulus in trying to bring Voldemort down, this did not stop him from assisting the dark lord through Bellatrix and the Malfoys some fifteen years later. Despite this he likely did not see a connection between the two events and merely saw both actions as service to the Black family. He also didn't seem to hold any resentment towards Voldemort for trying to kill him and showed no hesitation in helping him indirectly by luring Sirius out of hiding. This is presumably due to the way house-elves are generally treated which, as Hermione says, is not much better than what Voldemort did to him.
  </p>
  <p key="51875dac-37d1-47eb-bbc5-1bba2bcf7e27">
   Because of years of solitude, Kreacher hadn't cleaned the Black family home for a long time and when the Order of the Phoenix used it as a headquarters, he was rarely seen cleaning. He also had a habit of stealing items that reminded him of his loyalty to the Black family. Kreacher was also considered to be slightly mad, probably from being stuck in the Blacks' house alone for so long. His misery and insanity was most probably a combination of drinking the
   Drink of Despair
   , Regulus Black's death, not being able to complete his master's order of destroying the locket, living alone with the locket as well as Walburga's portrait, and Sirius Black's cruelty to him.
  </p>
  <p key="8f3797ac-021e-4d49-be22-b516a94bb319">
   A tradition for the Black family house elves was for their heads to be cut off and stuck on a plaque. Kreacher and Ron both expressed the wish for this to be done to Kreacher. Ron later regretted this statement.

  <p key="3b5e7867-b1d8-4857-a357-0756e40f2454">

   Kreacher was extremely devoted to all members of the Black family except Sirius Black, whom he hated. He especially held
   Walburga Black
   in high regard and spoke to her portrait with devoted affection. Kreacher often attempted to calm her portrait down when it flew into a rage and referred to it as his mistress even though it wasn't truly Walburga (who had long since perished). Sirius claimed that he was slightly less devoted to
   Sirius' father
   than he was to Walburga, though this did not stop Kreacher from trying to save
   Orion's old ring
   and a pair of his
   trousers
   . It's likely that he held the other members of the family with similar affection and devotion. Considering Kreacher was disloyal to people who treated him in a horrible manner, the

   Out of all members of the Black family, Kreacher's bond with
   Regulus
   appeared to be the strongest. In fact, it was partially because of Kreacher that Regulus turned against Voldemort; after discovering the cruel way his master treated Kreacher, and realising that his immortality came from creating Horcruxes, Regulus and Kreacher went to the cave to steal Voldemort's locket. Regulus sacrificed himself to retrieve the locket, even though he could have ordered Kreacher to drink the Drink of Despair for him, showing that he truly did care about Kreacher. Despite the fact that Regulus died trying to bring down Voldemort, Kreacher still assisted the dark lord through Bellatrix and the Malfoy family years later, though he likely didn't associate the two events together. The elderly house elf was still devastated by Regulus' death, nearly two decades after it happened. He felt he had failed Regulus by being unable to destroy Voldemort's locket, and partly warmed up to Harry Potter when he learned that he hoped to finish the job Regulus sought to do.
   He later led his fellow House Elves into battle in Regulus' name during the

   , Hermione immediately realised that Kreacher was very fond of them. She told Harry and Ron that since 'Miss Cissy' and 'Miss Bella' must have been lovely to him, Kreacher must have been willing to do a job for them, especially against
   Sirius,
   the man who treated him horribly. Harry, who at first hated Kreacher, for good reason since it was Kreacher's lie to Harry that made him go to the
   Department of Mysteries
   , resulting in Sirius's death, took a while to come to terms with the fact that

   At first, Harry and Kreacher had an antagonistic relationship. When Harry attempted to discover if Lord Voldemort had captured Sirius, Kreacher lied to him and claimed he was alone in Sirius' house. After Sirius' death, Harry placed part of the blame on Kreacher and part on Severus Snape, but put most of the blame on himself. Under Harry's ownership, Kreacher was ordered to work in the Hogwarts kitchens. Harry then ordered him and

   to spy on Draco Malfoy and made sure there were no loopholes in the instructions he'd given Kreacher. When Kreacher and Dobby returned from spying on Malfoy, Harry congratulated Dobby but ignored Kreacher.

   However, whilst living in the house of Black, Harry learned a bit about Kreacher's past. Though he was initially angry with the elf for helping the Death Eaters even after Regulus died fighting them, he quickly began to feel more sympathetic towards him. He tried to be kind to Kreacher and gradually their relationship improved. Harry then gave Kreacher the fake Slytherin's Locket with the note from
   Regulus
   , saying Regulus would have wanted him to have it, as Kreacher adored having a

   heirloom for himself. Kreacher eventually grew quite friendly towards Harry and company, especially after Harry gifted him the locket, and started cooking for them, cleaning the house, and reminding him to wash his hands before dinner. Harry also congratulated him when he succeeded in capturing
   Mundungus Fletcher

   was the only person who made an effort to be kind to Kreacher. Despite this Kreacher was disdainful towards her because she was a "Mudblood". Hermione insisted that Kreacher wasn't in his right mind, and despite his insults she continued to treat him kindly, giving him a present at Christmas which no one else had bothered to do.

  <p key="bc35584e-fc6c-487b-82fb-45b62ffbb18e">
   When Hermione discovered that Kreacher's
   master
   had been killed during his and Kreacher's mission to retrieve one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, she tried to comfort him with a hug but Kreacher appeared revolted. However, Hermione's kindness towards Kreacher eventually started to change his attitude towards her, and before going on his search for Mundungus Fletcher he gave her a little spasm, which was supposed to be a respectful salute. Because of Hermione, Kreacher grew more respectful towards Muggle-borns.

   thought that Kreacher was a nutter and thus they didn't have a close relationship. Ron felt disturbed at the thought of Kreacher wandering around his room in the middle of the night and said that his life's ambition was to have his head chopped off and put on a plaque, like his mother before him. Kreacher thought of Ron and the rest of the Weasley family as "blood traitors". However, as with Harry and Hermione, Kreacher grew more friendly towards Ron during the trio's time in Grimmauld Place. Ron even displayed some affection for Kreacher and said that he no longer dreamed of chopping off his head.
