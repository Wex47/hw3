   This campaign had a highly negative effect; as the majority of the wizarding world began to believe Harry and Dumbledore over Fudge, once Voldemort was revealed to have returned, the entire wizarding community not only lost complete trust and respect for Fudge, but also confidence in the Ministry of Magic itself; as a result, Fudge was removed from office as Minister for Magic by force.

   Harry, for supporting Dumbledore and being the one who claimed Voldemort returned, also suffered from this campaign. Fudge planted
   Dolores Umbridge
   as the
   Hogwarts High Inquisitor
   and headmistress in order to further destabilise Dumbledore and Harry.
   Fudge also made it clear that anyone siding with Dumbledore should clear out their desks in the Ministry's office.
   Due to the great influence the Ministry had, the majority of the wizarding community ceased supporting Dumbledore and Harry and lost a chance to prepare themselves against Voldemort. The campaign also pressed the position that Harry was a deluded attention-seeker that could not be trusted.

  <p key="aa69edfe-da78-4432-a7a8-cf86a1667bda">
   When Voldemort was revealed to have truly returned,
   Fudge was forced to accept it and to reveal everything to the world, by which time it was too late to prepare. The campaign, along with all the
   Educational Decrees
   and

   Harry was forced to watch as the Dark Lord was reborn before his eyes. Once the potion had done its work, Harry witnessed Voldemort summon the

   Later, once he had watched Voldemort berate his Death Eaters for their betrayal and speak of his future plans, he was forced to

   It was revealed that
   Bartemius Crouch Junior
   , Crouch Snr's only son and Voldemort's most loyal Death Eater, was using
   Polyjuice Potion
   to impersonate Alastor Moody in order to perpetrate a plan for Lord Voldemort. After hearing Crouch's story and Harry's account of the events in the graveyard, Dumbledore could come to no conclusion other than that Lord Voldemort had returned.
  </p>
  <p key="8afb7fa5-f5d9-4e10-b3a1-b217b65ab78c">
   When Dumbledore informed
   Minister for Magic
   Cornelius Fudge
   of the events that had taken place that evening, Fudge believed them to be the work of one deranged madman. When he was taken to question Barty Crouch Jnr, the
   Dementor
   that accompanied him subjected Crouch to the
   Dementor's Kiss
   before he could be actually questioned by Fudge.
   Fudge regarded this as no loss since he had "
   <i key="e609b060-b16f-458f-8ff6-cbfd4de798d4">
    been responsible for several deaths
   </i>
   !"
   When Dumbledore pointed out that this meant Crouch could no longer testify as to why he committed his crimes, Fudge stated that Crouch did them because he was a madman. Dumbledore replied that Crouch's crimes had been part of a larger plot to revive Lord Voldemort. Fudge smiled and said that Dumbledore was believing the words of a raving lunatic.
  </p>
  <p key="5825b2ae-a931-4eb8-a558-d13a183c48f9">
   Dumbledore proceeded to point out that Harry's account of what happened in the graveyard jived with what Crouch was saying. Fudge smiled again and pointed out that Harry was not necessarily the best source, as he (according to
   Rita Skeeter
   ) had been said to be mentally unstable. Dumbledore replied, in no uncertain terms, that Harry was sane. When the others present began to defend Harry and pointed out

  </p>
  <p key="4efe1cb7-7d95-4691-aa1b-c66792d17e0e">
   Dumbledore then proceeded to give Fudge a string of suggestions to ensure the safety of the wizarding community and to defeat Lord Voldemort; Dumbledore noted that had Fudge followed these steps, he would be memorialised as one of the bravest and greatest
   Ministers for Magic
   in history, otherwise he would be looked down as the man who stepped aside to allow Voldemort a second chance to destroy both the wizarding and muggle worlds. When Fudge replied that these ideas would result in him being thrown out of office, Dumbledore replied that Fudge
   loved
   his position too much, and that they had reached a parting of ways. While there was no hint of threat in Dumbledore's voice, Fudge took this as a threat and stormed off telling Dumbledore that they would speak in the morning about his running of Hogwarts.

  <p key="8dc442ff-fd4b-4854-8940-7ce472cfc799">
   During the following summer, the
   Ministry of Magic
   began to make moves to discredit Dumbledore.
   After he made a speech to the
   International Confederation of Wizards
   announcing Voldemort's return, he was stripped of his title as
   Supreme Mugwump
   . It is implied that he was voted out by representatives selected by the Ministry of Magic. They used the excuse that he was going senile in his old age. Soon after, he was removed from his post as
   Chief Warlock
   of the
   Wizengamot
   , for much the same reasons. Fudge even threatened to retract the
   Order of Merlin, First Class
   , from Dumbledore.
  </p>
  <p key="fe4c3e9d-ed16-4561-bb64-20f7391e2418">
   When he appeared as Harry's witness at the
   disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter
   , Fudge told him that he considered Dumbledore's views on the
   Dementor
   attack "bilge".
   When Fudge began to slander Harry in front of Dumbledore and the entire
   Wizengamot
   talking about Harry's misuse of magic at Hogwarts, Dumbledore pointed out that the Ministry had no right to punish students for what they did at school and could not expel students from school. Fudge took exception to this remark, indicating his want to influence the workings of Hogwarts.
  </p>
  <p key="82011ca7-d6a1-426c-bf3b-10353e32bebc">
   He got his wish a few weeks later when Dumbledore could not fill the position of
   <a href="Defence Against the Dark Arts.html" key="ef7441a4-5945-4b65-a84e-a38f6a6089f6" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">

   professor. On 30 August, the Ministry passed
   Educational Decree Number Twenty-Two
   .
   This established that in the event the
   Headmaster
   of
   <a href="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.html" key="aa277dca-00e4-4b51-a655-c12c12839fcd" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">
    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
   </a>
   could not find someone to fill a position in his faculty, the Ministry of Magic would appoint someone instead. The following day Fudge appointed his right-hand witch,
   Dolores Umbridge
   , as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts
   Professor
   , which he believed would kill two birds with one stone; Fudge now had a spy at Hogwarts, and as he believed Dumbledore was using Hogwarts as a training centre for an army to use against the Ministry, he could enforce a Ministry-approved theory-based curriculum in Defence Against the Dark Arts to prevent students from learning any practical defensive magic.
  </p>
  <p key="a41ec5dd-9fbb-4f53-8af5-4ed8d93ffbfa">
   Fudge further increased his control at Hogwarts on 8 September. This is when the Ministry passed
   Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three
   . This decree created the position of Hogwarts High Inquisitor, which was immediately filled by Dolores Umbridge. The reason for the decree was ostensibly to improve the "falling standards" at Hogwarts. In reality, it gave Fudge greater control of the teaching staff through Umbridge. Umbridge now had the power to inspect and suspend Hogwarts staff. Fudge continued to tighten his grip on the school throughout the school year with more Ministry decrees.
  </p>
  <p key="b5d7c627-91c6-4f4e-acc0-d04dac42acba">
   When
   Marietta Edgecombe
   betrayed Harry's rebel student group,
   Dumbledore's Army
   , to Umbridge in April 1996, Fudge's suspicions seemed to be validated when Dumbledore took the blame for forming the group in an act to protect Harry. When Fudge tried to arrest Dumbledore, Dumbledore attacked him and his entourage and made a hasty escape.
   Dumbledore was not seen again until the
   Battle of the Department of Mysteries
   .

   with his usual grace, stating that he didn't care what happened to him as long as they don't remove him from the
   Chocolate Frog Cards
   .
   He did not show overt anger or displeasure at his treatment. This may have been because he was acting against Voldemort anyway, and there was no way the Ministry was going to stop him.

   Skeeter also stated that Harry might resort to using the

   Barty Crouch Jnr

  <p key="40231e90-42a1-48d3-98fb-59b74f57dc39">
   On the night of 2 August, Harry and his cousin

    Little Whinging
   </a>
   .
   The Dementors were dispatched to Little Whinging on the orders of Senior Undersecretary to the Minister
   Dolores Umbridge
   , without the knowledge of Minister Fudge. According to Umbridge, the Ministry had been going on about discrediting and/or silencing Harry, but no one was doing anything about it, so she ordered the Dementors out to Little Whinging.
  </p>
  <p key="13a0b3f0-7937-4180-89f1-81f3f5587c11">
   Umbridge knew that Harry would have to either defend himself with a
   Patronus Charm
   or be subjected to the
   Dementor's Kiss
   , either outcome working in the Ministry's favour as using a Patronus would be a serious breach of the
   Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery
   .
   The Ministry initially expelled Harry from Hogwarts and planned on confiscating and destroying his wand. Dumbledore was notified in time to prevent this from happening. Instead Harry's punishment was changed to a hearing at the Ministry.
  </p>
  <p key="dd3ceffe-07a7-451b-8221-55b42cf4bfe8">
   In an underhanded move to attempt to prevent Harry from attending his own hearing, the Ministry changed the time and location of Harry's hearing on the very morning it was set to be held. Harry thankfully arrived in time to make the hearing. The
   disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter
   was tried in front of the full
   Wizengamot
   . It appeared to be nothing more than a show trial, but due to the intervention of Dumbledore, who acted as a barrister for Harry, Harry got a fair hearing. Once evidence was presented, it was obvious that Harry was not guilty, but Fudge stubbornly kept trying to deny this fact. When the court was polled for a verdict, the overwhelming majority voted for acquittal, with only roughly seven, including Fudge, Umbridge and

   professor
   Dolores Umbridge
   , who punished Harry for telling the truth with sadistic and abusive punishments by means of a

  </p>
  <p key="80802cb6-62bf-4c42-a7f3-85bbabd0fae1">
   Overall, the Ministry had a harder time getting to him, but the effects of the summer campaign continued to haunt Harry. Other students continued to heckle Harry, but overall the student populace was split. A few who knew Harry personally turned against him, though. A good example of this was when

   The noose tightened on

   , and all those who had attended the first meeting of what would become
   Dumbledore's Army
   . This group, led by Harry, was formed in response to Umbridge's method of teaching only theory-based defence.
   They hoped to learn practical defence, knowing that Voldemort was out there. When the group was discovered due to
   Marietta Edgecombe
   betraying them, Fudge and Umbridge initially thought that they finally had a way of driving Harry Potter out of Hogwarts and marginalising him in the wizarding world. Dumbledore took the blame for Harry, enabling him to continue his studies.
  </p>
  <p key="576f1e3d-2ea0-4bd2-b7cc-d0a20daec36f">
   While it seemed that Dumbledore was taking his discrediting with his usual grace, Harry was unable to control his temper at the way he was treated by the Ministry, and began to lash out even at Ron and Hermione. During the first few days back at school, Harry attempted to persuade Fudge's right-hand woman, Umbridge, that Voldemort has returned, and that he had duelled the Dark Lord, to no avail.
   This led to Harry screaming at Umbridge,
   for which he was punished with detention where he had to cut words into his own hand. When he read Percy's letter to Ron, it all seemed to hit home for him. Harry was terribly hurt reading those words. He had liked and lived with Percy, and now Percy was suggesting that Harry might become physically violent if Ron decided not to be friends with him.
  </p>
  <p key="12b627fc-902f-4413-b049-01c0e44cdfb7">
   When the mass breakout from
   Azkaban
   occurred, Fudge blamed
   Sirius Black
   for being the mastermind instead of accepting Harry and Dumbledore's explanation, and Umbridge further enforced the suppression of the truth by
   preventing the teachers from speaking to students about it
   . Harry was further infuriated with this, as he saw the Ministry was adamant in their denial even when the mounting dangers were providing more evidence to the truth.
   Harry ceased his subscription of the

   After Harry got a vision of his godfather,
   Sirius Black
   , being tortured by Voldemort, he and his friends decided to go to the
   Department of Mysteries
   to rescue him,
   (this later turned out to be a trick of Voldemort's: Black was safe, but Voldemort needed Harry to retrieve a
   particular prophecy
   from the department).
   Before they could leave, they were caught by Umbridge,
   but they eventually got rid of her by leading her into the
   Forbidden Forest
   and having her
   carried away
   by
   centaurs
   angry at her hateful and arrogant remarks towards them.

   The students headed to the Department of Mysteries,
   where they found Lord Voldemort's
   Death Eaters
   waiting for them.
   A battle
   ensued, during which Harry's friends were injured and the prophecy destroyed. The
   Order of the Phoenix
   arrived and battled the Death Eaters, and Sirius Black ended up being killed by
   Bellatrix Lestrange
   in the
   Death Chamber
   .
   Furious and grief-stricken, Harry pursued her into the
   Atrium
   , where Voldemort himself soon Apparated. Voldemort and Dumbledore then engaged in a
   duel
   , which ended with Voldemort trying to possess Harry unsuccessfully due to Harry's ability to
   love
   . Following his attempt to possess Harry, Voldemort grabbed Bellatrix and the two Disapparated, but only after Voldemort was seen by many
   Aurors
   , Ministry workers, and
   Cornelius Fudge
   himself.

   When Fudge walked into the Ministry of Magic Atrium after the
   Battle of the Department of Mysteries
   and saw Dumbledore, he appeared to be of half a mind to have his Aurors seize him, but he had also seen Voldemort with his own eyes. This confirmed the stories that Harry and Dumbledore had been telling the Ministry and wider wizarding world the truth for a year.

   Umbridge was removed from her positions at Hogwarts,
   Fudge was dismissed as Minister in disgrace while Head of the Auror Office
   Rufus Scrimgeour
   took his place,
   and Dumbledore was reinstated as
   Headmaster
   . Harry, who had so recently been insulted and slandered by the press, became the darling of newspapers like the
   <i key="31c287b2-8b19-4c5c-ac74-ad77348b39a4">
    Daily Prophet

   . The newspapers called him "
   <i key="8b200eef-9670-4d7a-b03b-c97a5bc9955d">
    the lone voice of truth

   " among ridicule, while failing to mention that it was
   <i key="fa306d24-0819-48a5-965c-c2f0801ef66d">
    them
   </i>
   doing the ridiculing.
   The Ministry also had the nerve to ask Harry to be their poster child; that is, convince the public that the Ministry was winning the
   war against Voldemort
   (which was yet another lie), a move both Harry and Dumbledore opposed.
