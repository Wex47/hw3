   Death Eater
   , and that he should carry out the mission of killing Dumbledore, rather than Voldemort himself; due to Dumbledore having easily rivalled and surpassed the Dark Lord in power during their duel at the Ministry Of Magic the year prior.

   Narcissa Malfoy
   , however, strongly suspected that Voldemort had given Draco this task as a form of secret revenge against Lucius, as The Dark Lord foolishly believed that Dumbledore would kill Draco if he discovered any assassination attempts on his life. Voldemort also made it perfectly clear that if Draco failed in his mission, he and his entire family would face serious consequences. Narcissa then assumed that Voldemort literally intended for Draco to die in the performance of his duties, either by Dumbledore's hands or by Voldemort's hands.

   During periods of extreme desperation, Draco invented more conventional ways to kill Dumbledore. He placed the

   Draco also made Rosmerta sell

   Throughout the year, Harry had also been having
   private lessons
   with Dumbledore in the Headmaster's Office, regarding Lord Voldemort's past and his quest for immortality. They found out what a Horcrux was, and that Voldemort had made at least six, wanting to split his soul into seven parts.
   Through Dumbledore's memories of Voldemort's childhood and early years of education at Hogwarts, Dumbledore determined that one of Voldemort's Horcruxes was placed in a cave near the Atlantic Ocean; where the Muggle orphanage that The Dark Lord had grown up in as a child had once taken the children for a daytime outing.
  </p>
  <p key="8969db7d-8cc3-4422-a220-03404d3875f2">
   Before leaving the castle with Dumbledore, Harry met
   Sybill Trelawney
   , who told him that she had been unable to enter the Room of Requirement, and had heard someone expressing triumph inside it. Although thinking it strange, Harry said nothing about it to Dumbledore. He and Harry then set out to find and perhaps destroy the Horcrux. Once at the cave, Dumbledore had to drink the
   Emerald Potion
   , which greatly weakened him and caused him to experience terrible hallucinations about his family and Gellert Grindelwald, and he and Harry had to fight an army of
   Inferi
   .
   They obtained the Horcrux; Harry later found that it was actually a fake and
   someone else
   had taken the real Horcrux years before.

   Inside the Room of Requirement, Draco watched as an army of Death Eaters: Corban Yaxley, Fenrir Greyback, Amycus Carrow, Alecto Carrow, Thorfinn Rowle and Gibbon; all suddenly emerged from

   Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder
   to prevent Ron, Ginny, and Neville from seeing the Death Eaters, who refrained from harming the young heroes and quickly and quietly left the Room, while Malfoy ensured his own visibility with the
   Hand of Glory
   which his mother Narcissa had given to him as a birthday present earlier that year; as he quickly led the Death Eaters from the Room and up the entrance to the top of the Astronomy Tower. A Death Eater also placed a
   Cursed barrier
   at the Tower's only entrance/exit, in order to prevent anyone except a Death Eater from passing through.

   At the same moment, Snape felt the Dark Mark tattoo on his arm ignite, signalling that the Death Eaters had successfully entered the school; and he then quickly left his office, told Hermione and Luna to go alert any Order members they encountered that something was wrong on the 7th Floor, before leaving for that floor himself. Meanwhile, Ron, Neville, and Ginny had all seen the Darkness Powder suddenly emanating from inside the Room Of Requirement; but were completely unable to see anyone exit.
   Gibbon
   then fired the
   Dark Mark
   out of an open window, and placed it directly above the Astronomy Tower. However, mere moments afterwards, Dumbledore and Harry arrived in Hogsmeade, having returned from their mission. The Death Eaters then began ascending the stairway of the empty Tower.

   Dumbledore then revealed that he secretly knew all along of Draco's mission, along with the failed attempts on his life, having been constantly updated all year in secret by Professor Snape; although Draco claimed that Snape was a double agent and that he was one of Voldemort's highest-ranking servants. Dumbledore merely told Draco that it was natural that Snape would tell him that; and claimed that he still allowed Draco to remain at Hogwarts to protect him from
   Voldemort
   , then proceeded to offer Draco the chance to change sides, and promised to hide Draco and his family where Voldemort would never find them. Draco, full of great visible remorse, shame, and anger; could ultimately not bring himself to kill the headmaster, even after the immediate arrival and encouragement of all the other
   Death Eaters

The impact and force of the Killing Curse also caused Dumbledore's body to be blasted into the air, where his corpse then fell down from the Tower to the school courtyard below under the light of the
   Dark Mark

   Snape then grabbed Draco by the scruff of his shirt collar and dragged him towards the exit while ordered the rest of the Death Eaters to immediately flee the school; taking the lead as he quickly began descending the Tower stairway. Harry, who was forced to silently watch the entire spectacle from the
   Full Body-Bind Curse

When he ran into the dimly lit corridor, it was full of dust and debris, as half the ceiling had fallen in, as the battle was violently raging, with several Hogwarts residents and the Order
   duelling
   the Death Eaters. Draco and Snape however, had passed through the violence somehow unscathed, due to the Order unaware of Snape's recent actions, instead believing that he and Draco were being pursued by the hostile Death Eaters; Snape ordered the remaining Death Eaters to escape.

    Professor Trelawney
    mentions having drawn the tarot card
    in a reading and how

    was ignoring her warnings that this foreshadowed "calamity...coming near all the time". In
    Divination
    , this tarot card is usually taken to mean catastrophe and chaos, much like the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. However, it can also mean epiphany and the letting go of pretences (illusions or self-delusions) one has clung to, which

    In the novel, as Harry and Snape are duelling, Snape is shouting at Harry.
