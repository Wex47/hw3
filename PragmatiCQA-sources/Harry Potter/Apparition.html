    Apparition
   </b>
   was a
   magical
   form of
   transportation
   , in which the user travelled instantly from one location to another, without traversing the space in-between. This was accomplished by having the user focus on a desired location in their mind and then purposely disappearing from where they were, to reappear at the desired location. Apparition was by far the fastest way to get to a desired destination, but was tricky to pull off correctly and disastrous if botched.

   unique type of magic
   . For example, they could Apparate inside

   Apparition had a range-limit,
   and became increasingly difficult with the distance to be travelled. It was advised that inter-continental Apparition should only be attempted by the most highly skilled of wizards,
   otherwise risking
   splinching
   ,
   severe injury, and death. Apparition also required a familiarity with the terrain of the place the wizard wanted to visit, as they needed to be able to visualise it clearly.

   As such, even an extremely powerful wizard like Voldemort couldn't Apparate much further than the length of England. As such, wizards apparently could not Apparate somewhere outside of range by imagining that location and Apparating small stretches at a time, as doing so would possibly cause splinching.

   A variant of Apparition used to transport two or more individuals at once was called Side-Along Apparition. This method could be used by adults seeking to transport underage wizards, or licenced individuals could use this method to transport an injured party.

   In the

   of the series, Apparition differs greatly in deployment from the book series. The appearance of Apparition is also inconsistent between characters and uses. As it somewhat deviates from the books, the way Apparition is portrayed in the films is most likely a stylistic choice made to better suit the visual medium of a film. It could also be explained that the style differs by distance. Short range and/or without needing to change locations immediately, the less intense, black smoke form of the
   Death Eaters
   is used. Long range and/or needing to change locations immediately, the more intense twisting into and out of nothingness, the kind which was first used by
