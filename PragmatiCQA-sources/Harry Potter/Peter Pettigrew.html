   1981
   , he cut off his right index finger as part of a ploy to fake his own death, which is reflected in his "Scabbers" form, and, fourteen years later, he cut off his entire right hand at the request of Lord Voldemort. Voldemort used magic to give Pettigrew a shining silver, glove-like replacement. As a Death Eater, he bore the
   Dark Mark
   on his left inner forearm.

   employee, despite not knowing the extent of her usefulness. He only returned to a broken down Voldemort simply because he had no other choice, as the other side was aiming to kill him, and would have gone to anywhere else if he had more options, seeing Voldemort at the time was too weakened to be the victorious side, along with the task of caring for his lord being tedious and unpleasant.

He originally formulated his plan to return to the Dark Lord without being accused a traitor by his colleague Death Eaters: to turn Harry in as a welcome back present and be honoured above all others; though a well thought out plan and he waited patiently, it was upset when Pettigrew's form was exposed prematurely. He also managed to manipulate
   Bertha Jorkins
   to accompany him with ease, when he brought her to Lord Voldemort. He was also adept in the Dark Arts, powerful enough and malicious enough to use the Killing Curse on Cedric Diggory. In moments of desperation Pettigrew was willing to amputate his own limbs to serve his purposes, such as his finger to fake his death, and his hand to revive Voldemort, the latter being promised with a worthy reward.

   He was, however, foolish enough to stop by an inn for food en route to returning to Voldemort, which led him to run into a Ministry employee; if Pettigrew had not been cunning enough to persuade Bertha into his trap, he might have exposed his own duplicity to the world at large then, as Voldemort had noted. Despite Pettigrew's cowardly streak and his repressed regret of his treachery, he was ruthless and callous towards others if it benefited himself, as he massacred twelve muggles to frame Sirius,

   However, despite his treacherous and cowardly nature, Pettigrew did feel some regret for betraying his friends, and he hesitated to kill Harry when reminded of his
   life debt
   , in
   1998
   . Though he quickly tried to undo the moment of weakness, his "tiny merciful impulse" resulted in his being strangled to death by his own
   silver hand
   .
   Pettigrew also suggested that Voldemort should find another enemy to use for his rebirth, though when Voldemort began to suspect that he cared about
   Harry Potter
   , Pettigrew hastily claimed that Harry meant nothing to him. This suggested that he may have consciously felt some gratitude towards Harry for sparing his life.
   Pettigrew also realised and admitted that he was a coward saying that he'd never been brave like Sirius, Remus, and James.

  <p key="1e1d42d9-b312-4180-8581-eacf2ac2e895">
   Though he valued his own life more than the lives of his friends, Pettigrew felt guilt for betraying Lily and James, but did not have the courage to admit his treachery until it was forced out of him, or to turn against Voldemort. He did feel rather under-appreciated when Voldemort claimed him to be an unintelligent and disloyal servant when comparing to

   . and also seemed resentful that he was treated as little more than a servant for Snape, though he refrained from complaining too much when Snape threatened to request more dangerous assignments for Peter. Without James, Sirius, and Remus protecting him, Peter found no courage to go against Snape, who would in turn bully him in return throughout their time as Death Eater colleagues.

   Pettigrew also developed a bit of nosiness, having been eavesdropping behind doors during his stay at the Snape family house, resulting in Severus slamming the door in his face. Pettigrew was so meek that he did not dare request for reassignment when Voldemort sent him to assist Snape, in which Snape treated him as a mere slave for household chores.
   His unenthusiastic and careless attitude for more risky missions led to the Death Eaters' perception on how Pettigrew could not be trusted with such importance, resulting in him being placed with menial tasks of serving his colleagues instead.

Although his carelessness from time to time may serve as a setback, such as stopping at an inn for food that led to Jorkins discovering him, Pettigrew proved himself to be a quick thinker to swiftly formulate tactics to take advantage of what seems to be a lost situation.

   , enjoyed tormenting Severus Snape. Pettigrew, who probably would not have fared well duelling with a wizard as skilled and powerful as Snape, only got away with doing so because he had more talented friends backing him up.
   For this reason, Snape possibly viewed Pettigrew with even more scorn than the other three because of his pitiful ineptitude. Or perhaps his intense dislike of Pettigrew was due to the former betraying

Severus did not condone Peter's habit of eavesdropping, and even slamming the door in his face to get him to stay away from listening any further. With the feeble protests Pettigrew made proved his ineptitude and cowardice, Snape openly and contemptuously mocked him for it, showed his "assistant" no respect whatsoever, and regarded the treacherous coward as a negligible vermin. As with the rest of the Death Eaters and Order of the Phoenix alike, Snape would address Pettigrew as "Wormtail" instead of his real name during their later years of life.

He only intended to return if Voldemort would regain his strength, in which Pettigrew would present Harry as a "welcome back present" in order to make it appear that he never betrayed the Dark Lord.

Though he regretted this decision, and attempted several times to escape, while flinching and shuddering at any contact with Voldemort's rudimentary body, he ultimately engineered Voldemort's return to physical form, and Voldemort rewarded Pettigrew with a new

   Voldemort neither trusted nor respected Pettigrew. He knew that Pettigrew felt no true allegiance to him and kept him only because he was sometimes useful (often times without Pettigrew being the wiser),
   or having him assigned to menial tasks.
   He also made it clear just how little he trusted Pettigrew, when he designed the silver hand he made to turn on the man for any attempts at treachery; it did just that when it strangled Pettigrew for hesitating to kill Harry Potter in 1998.
   Based on this, it is possible that Voldemort reacted to Pettigrew's death with indifference at worst, especially since Voldemort had by that point been more concerned with the

    In the Bible, Peter is the name of one of Christ's apostles who, on the morning of the crucifixion, denied Christ, although he later repented. Also, the name "Pettigrew" could be derived from the French word "petit" ("small") and the English word "grew," hence "grew small." The name "Pettigrew" could also be a reference to his time as Ron's rat, being the pet that Ron grew. "Petti" could also be a corrupted form of 'petty' meaning "of little importance" or "trivial", showing his lack of talent and - had he not befriended James, Sirius or Remus - easily overlooked.

    Scabbers may derive from the word "scab." A scab is the crusty covering blood forms over a wound as it clots. A scab is also a worker hired to replace others who are on strike, and "Scabby the Rat", often used as a caricature by the labour rights movement, is a possible source for his name.
    "Scab" is also slang for a horrible person, which could reflect Peter Pettigrew's true nature.

    Peter Pettigrew shares similarities with two apostles of
    Jesus
    of Nazareth,
    and
    , beyond the name of one of them. Both Peter and Judas belonged to Jesus' close circle, being two of his disciples or
    , and played a pivotal role in Jesus' crucifixion, Peter being the one who denied his relationship with Jesus three times, and Judas his greatest betrayer by handing him over to the Sanhedrin for thirty pieces of silver, just as Pettigrew disavowed his friendship with James and Lily and ended up handing them over to Voldemort to save his own skin. It is interesting to note that both Pettigrew and Judas were rewarded for their betrayal or lack of loyalty with silver, with Judas receiving the Sanhedrin's thirty pieces for handing Jesus over to them, and Pettigrew receiving the prosthetic hand from Voldemort, to replace his lost right hand in the ritual that would restore his physical body. Both, moreover, showed remorse for their respective betrayals and repented of them, having an incredibly similar outcome, Pettigrew dying strangled by his silver hand after freeing Harry, sealing his life debt to him and in a moment of redemption, and Judas committing suicide out of guilt for his actions by hanging himself.

Given Pettigrew's extreme cowardice and lacklustre aptitude for magic, it is highly unlikely that he could master it.

Indeed, Wormtail served Lord Voldemort in much the same way Wormtongue served

    Harry's attitude toward Pettigrew is comparable to Bilbo Baggins' response to Gollum. Each protagonist spared the life of an antagonist who seemed to have deserved death.

    It was predicted by many fans that Pettigrew would kill Remus Lupin with his silver hand, as Remus is a werewolf. However, J. K.

However the Marauder that dies by the silver hand is not Lupin, but Wormtail himself.

   She also said that James Potter and Sirius Black allowed Pettigrew to be their friend "in a slightly patronising way" and that he ended up being a better wizard and better at hiding secrets than they ever knew.
