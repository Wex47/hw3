  <p key="f0f6e6cd-a5f8-48b7-b4e0-f25081cf1f77">
   Kama, who was attempting to assassinate Barebone, had tried to take Newt and his friends captive in his

   Water dragon parasite
   venom.

   Once they had arrived safely at the Flamel House, which was by then well protected by various

   Water dragon parasite

Because of Nicolas' frail state due to his extremely advanced age, Jacob's firm grip hurt him and he screamed from the pain. The No-Maj apologised and he was okay.

   After the greeting, Flamel looked over at his
   crystal ball
   , which showed, among other things, that Grindelwald was about to host a rally for his followers at the
   Lestrange Mausoleum
   at
   Pere Lachaise Cemetery
   . They also saw

When Jacob saw, he asked Flamel where the place in the ball was located, and requested Nicolas to look after Kama, however when Jacob looked at the place where Yusuf should have been laying, Yusuf was gone, making the request obsolete. While Jacob was running out of the house, Flamel demanded that Jacob went to the Cimetière.
  </p>
  <p key="8716b380-d086-4cf6-9cf6-66f42ec1b743">
   A moment after Jacob left, the vision in the crystal ball changed and presented the upcoming tragic events at Grindelwald's rally. While watching, the alchemist became scared and wanted to warn Albus with the help of his
   book
   , he was shocked to see that Dumbledore was not available, so he panickedly flipped a few more pages and found that
   Eulalie Hicks
   was there, who advised him to go immediately. Nicolas had doubts, because he had not been in active battle for two hundred years. However, she declared that everyone believed in him, which made him go.

   knew how to counter it. When Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini and
   Theseus Scamander
   ran out of the fire consuming everything, Nicolas ordered them to form a circle, plant their wands in the ground and use the
   General Counter-Spell
   . This created a cleansing orange fire which, directed nonverbally by Flamel and the other, eliminated the effect of Grindelwald's spell and saved the whole of city from destruction.

   to set their affairs in order, it was expected that they would die shortly thereafter as their supply ran out. When Dumbledore informed Harry of this, the young wizard initially took the news to be terrible. However, Dumbledore assured him that, for them, it would be like "going to bed after a very, very long day", implying that when Nicolas and his wife passed on, their deaths would be dignified and peaceful.

    Nicolas Flamel
    was a real French scribe believed in legend to have been an alchemist who created the Philosopher's Stone. He was born about
    1330
    and died in
    1418
    . There is no proof that the historical Flamel and his wife
    Perenelle
    achieved immortality, though a few have claimed to have seen him throughout the centuries, or that he was even involved in alchemy at all. According to the legend, another of Flamel's goals was to turn ordinary lead into pure gold. However, while the Flamels had a reputation as generous benefactors, Nicolas's will did not indicate the fantastic wealth later ascribed to him. Historically that wealth was generally derived from Nicolas's businesses and Perenelle's inheritance from two previous husbands.

    The legend of Flamel as an immortal alchemist probably dates to 17th century. The reference to Flamel marks one of the few occasions in which a real person has been referenced as a character in the Potter books.
