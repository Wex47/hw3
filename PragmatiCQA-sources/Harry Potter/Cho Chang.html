   a new girlfriend
   while Cho moved on with either Cedric or Harry. Davies asked Cho out sometime after Cedric's death, though Cho rejected him in favour for Harry; regardless, she used this to gauge Harry's feelings for her, and looked at Roger and his girlfriend as though they were setting a standard to which Cho expected Harry to live up.

   This was probably compounded by a lack of closure, as Harry was the only person who knew what had happened to Cedric and did not want to discuss it with Cho.
  </p>
  <p key="6dfed50c-55c6-4c6f-94e1-929bec27a6b7">
   Given how, in spite of her genuinely intense grief, Cho managed to go on to date others, and eventually married a Muggle after the Second Wizarding War, it can be said that she learned to move on from the pain of losing Cedric.

   Roger Davies
   had asked her out, and ultimately leaving him in
   Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop
   for the other customers to stare at him astonishingly. Unimpressed with her attitude and for souring his experience of a first date, Harry grew angry at her. Though they eased up a bit after Cho read Harry's interview in

   at the end of the 1995–1996 school year, and again at the start of the 1996-1997 school year, she avoided him both times, as she was too embarrassed (and possibly still angry), for them to look at each other, let alone talk to each other.
   On the other hand, Harry found himself not caring about Cho anymore due to his godfather
   Sirius Black
   's death being far more devastating to him than their break-up,
   seemingly disregarding Cho with indifference as opposed to embarrassment. As for Marietta, he sneered at her limited success of hiding her disfigurement.

   </a>
   escort him instead, suggesting that Cho may have appreciated some alone time with Harry, whether because of any lingering feelings or just because she would've liked to talk with him since after their fallout. Harry, on the other hand, did not so much as hesitate in accepting Ginny's suggestion and Luna's escort, indicating that he was still angry and/or indifferent towards her and had no interest in mending their relationship (though it is also possible that the then tense and desperate situation with Voldemort and his forces left Harry with little time or emotional energy to devote to Cho).
  </p>
  <p key="8e6d2cc7-292f-4e58-a5e1-5e253a08559d">
   One of the reasons for Harry's attraction to Ginny was due to her being rarely weepy when she was upset.
   This contrasts with Cho, whose depression after her boyfriend's death led to her crying frequently, which Harry did not know how to handle. Harry had always envisioned that any time they spent together would involve Cho enjoying herself, not crying on his shoulder, showing that he had little desire in spending time comforting her to begin with. Eventually, Harry implied that Cho's depression and crying were things that he had to "cope" with, leading her to storming away due to this insensitivity.

   Cho was, until the beginning of her sixth year, very popular. She had an entire group of Ravenclaw girl friends, who were constantly giggling, Marietta being one of them. However, as because of Cho's depression and grief-induced mood swings, all the others fell by the wayside. Being a Quidditch star and very pretty, she was the centre of the group, having a handful of friends accompany her even to the bathroom, and up until her sixth year she was never seen without them. At the welcoming feast in her sixth year, Cho chatted animatedly with her friends but later on she was mostly by herself or with Marietta.

    [惆悵] means "melancholy".
    This may allude to Cho's fragile emotional state following

    , the name "Cho Chang" is translated into "Zhāng Qiū" [張秋] (in most Eastern languages, the surname precedes the given name), with "Zhāng" being a common Chinese surname and the official pinyin transcription of "Chang", and "Qiū" meaning "autumn". As the name Cho Chang is considered to be Chinese, this translation may give a hint as to what the name may mean. In Mandarin pinyin, the name is pronounced "Jah-ng Chee-oh". "Cho Chang" is also a possible direct romanisation (not a translation) of 張秋 in Hong Kong, due to its dual Cantonese and British influence (for more on this, see
    Hong Kong name
    ).

    , Cho appears as one of the many students of Hogwarts suffering under the Death Eater regime run by Snape and the Carrows. When Harry returns, it seems that all hard feelings about her betrayal of Dumbledore's Army have been forgotten (or forgiven) when she is one of the many people to embrace him. She is also one of the many who stand up for Harry against Pansy Parkinson's claim that they should grab him after Voldemort's ultimatum and is seen with Neville and Seamus receiving instructions from Professor McGonagall to blow up the bridge. Finally, she is seen by Harry recovering from the battle in the Great Hall. They smile at each other.
