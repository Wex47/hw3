   Before they made it back there,
   Scabbers
   began to squirm in Ron's hands and escaped. Not wanting to lose his rat again, Ron chased after Scabbers with Harry and Hermione behind him. He caught up to Scabbers, but not before they were in the shadow of the
   Whomping Willow
   tree. He looked up to see a large black dog bearing down upon him. The dog dived at Ron and gripping Ron's arm in its mouth, it dragged him into the Whomping Willow. To try and stop the dog from pulling him further, Ron tied his feet around a tree branch, but the dog's grip was so powerful his leg snapped. When the dog reached the Shrieking Shack, it let go of Ron and revealed itself to be Sirius Black.

He would take exception whenever Hermione complimented Harry on something Ron thought was equally due to him. Ron was temporarily mollified about this when

   , he blew up at her. In retaliation, Ginny belittled him for his complete inexperience with the opposite gender, declaring that Harry and Hermione had also snogged people. The siblings treated each other coldly afterwards, and Ron was so bothered by this — and by the revelation that Hermione had kissed Viktor Krum almost two years earlier — that he began to perform poorly in Quidditch.

   He also began to treat Hermione with a cold indifference, which confused her. He even offered to resign from the team. To boost his confidence, Harry pretended to pour the

However, when after the match Harry revealed it was a trick, Ron rounded on Hermione and accused her of having no faith in his abilities.

When Ron attempted to use Godric Gryffindor's Sword to destroy the locket, horrible incorporeal images of Harry and Hermione came forth which cruelly mocked Ron about his many insecurities, including his fears that Hermione would choose Harry over him. This brought Ron to the point of tears. However, Ron successfully stabbed the Horcrux with Godric Gryffindor's Sword.

   Though his loyalty and bravery never faltered Ron's character was also marked by occasional jealousy and insecurity rising from feeling overshadowed by his five older brothers and his parents' constant comparisons between him and their other children. He could be argumentative, a trait particularly displayed in his bickering with the equally argumentative and occasionally highly critical Hermione. Though their bickering was frequent, it was never malicious (with the brief exception of sixth year) and generally a way to hide their deeper feelings for each other. Inheriting the Weasley trait of a strong temper Ron was not above provocation especially when dealing with the spiteful treatment of Professor Snape and the bigotry and hatred of Draco Malfoy. Always willing to stand up for his friends and family even when angry with them, Ron never stopped standing up for Hermione when she faced Muggle-born related prejudice and hatred. He also stood by Harry's side when he was met with disbelief and scorn from his classmates and Wizard society in general. Ron frequently demonstrated great bravery in attempting to protect those he loved, from facing his arachnophobia to stand by Harry in his second year
   to trying to take Hermione's place when

   Ron was also prone to insecurity about his abilities, when compared to his older siblings and to his famous best friend. When he felt insecure or embarrassed, it was noted that his ears turned red. This became his tell-tale sign of his anger and embarrassment.
   He felt as if he was consistently overshadowed by the legacy of his older brothers and the fame of Harry; this lead to a feeling of being "

   Ron's point of view on many topics was often that of the stereotypical wizard, which clashed many times with those of Harry and Hermione because they were both raised by

   Ron was particularly fond of food. He had a tendency to talk with his mouth full, often to Hermione's disgust, and a great fondness for bacon sandwiches, though he disliked corned beef sandwiches, as mentioned in his first year; his love of food eventually made him settle into a portly middle age. And like Harry, Ron was intelligent, but lacked the motivation to put forth effort in class due to incredible laziness; during their years at school, Ron frequently expected Hermione's help, and when she either refused or was unavailable, he was often dumbfounded about how to proceed. If not for Hermione's help, he would have undoubtedly failed his exams.

   Ron was brave, to a level which would put him on a par with his best friend Harry; he never hesitated to put himself into extremely dangerous situations with his best friends Harry and Hermione, and as shown many times, he would rather die than have someone else he cared about be harmed. He risked his life on many occasions, and his bravery was not unnoticed by his friends.

   Ron was also quite pragmatic and, despite his occasionally fierce temper, was usually able to keep a more level head in stressful situations compared with Harry and Hermione. His pragmatism was demonstrated by his defence of
   <a href="Bartemius Crouch Senior.html" key="f002da50-e6c1-4e38-b3ce-aa7bb0104c60" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">

   Winky
   , with Ron stating that Winky liked being told what to do by Crouch to the point that she held a seat for him despite her acrophobia and that this was because she wasn't human and as such didn't think like one.
   Another example of Ron's pragmatic nature was when he discovered the truth about

   as while Harry was disgusted by Dumbledore's past desires to rule over Muggles alongside Grindelwald and Dumbledore's secrecy over this, and even Hermione expressed huge shock over this, Ron simply stated that Dumbledore was still growing up at that age and changed as he got older.
   However, Ron's pragmatism occasionally made him naïve and insensitive, as while he believed that Winky liked being told what to do and acknowledged that she wasn't human, he was ignorant to Winky's acrophobia and her emotional distress once she was sacked by Crouch Senior.

   Ron was also a person who liked to do things the easy way, as he did not like to work hard. This quality was reflected in his first year when he just picked up books from the Hogwarts Library shelves randomly when finding out about

    Ron was also able to keep a level head in highly stressful situations, and was generally more pragmatic than either of his best friends. His knack for strategy allowed him to consistently outclass his peers in both combat and strategy games such as Wizards Chess. His tactical mindset allowed him to recognise Quidditch plays and strategies almost instantly, which is an impressive feat, given that Quidditch is a sport with a three-dimensional playing field.

    : While it was mostly Harry or Hermione who did the leading, Ron also had relatively good leadership skills as he took charge of the Wizard's Chess obstacle during their search for the Philosophers Stone and ordered Harry and Hermione to continue searching for it when he decided to become a sacrifice in the end. He later formed and co-lead Dumbledore's Army alongside Harry and Hermione, and temporarily lead their Horcrux hunt when Harry briefly fell into depression over his obsession for the Deathly Hallows. After the war ended, his leadership skills were again shown when he, Harry and Hermione helped to reform the Auror department and Ministry of Magic, and help reduce the prejudice towards non-pure bloods and other underprivileged magical creatures, and when he co owned Weasley Wizard Wheezes afterwards alongside George Weasley.

   They were rather young when they married, as noted by Ron in 2020. His nephew, Albus, noted that Ron was rather openly affectionate towards his wife and was known to kiss her in public rather frequently. At this time Ron proposed to Hermione again after reading about renewing wedding vows, showing that Ron had become rather romantic as he matured, which made Hermione melt, deeply touched by her husband's romantic gesture and agreeing on the spot to it. This shows hows Ron and Hermione's relationship had evolved and much of their bickering subsiding a bit for a more gentle marriage, yet still rife with their uniquely combative and verbally alarming undertones to it.

   1991

   After Dumbledore's death, it was discovered that the Headmaster had bequeathed Ron his

   . Unknown to Ron at the time he received it, the Deluminator had the magical ability to return Ron to his friends if the time came, as Dumbledore had anticipated, when Ron would part ways with Harry and Hermione during their quest. The Deluminator's function as a homing device for Ron's friends suggested that Dumbledore understood Ron well enough to know that as surely as he would struggle with the mission, he would be just as certain to want to return to his friends' sides.

   In return, Ron admired Dumbledore for his extraordinary magical prowess and intelligence greatly and felt a great amount of respect for him. During Dumbledore's funeral, Ron was clearly distraught as Dumbledore's body was laid to rest. This respect clearly became greater than ever when Ron realised that Dumbledore valued him as Harry's friend enough to give him the Deluminator, showing great appreciation and gratitude for the Headmaster's trust in him. Due to his pragmatism, he is entirely unaffected by the revelation of Dumbledore's past with Gellert Grindelwald whereas even Hermione could not help but be deeply shocked by it, believing it only happened because Dumbledore was still growing up at that age and defending him from Harry when he mentioned about it.

This differs from the book, since Neville was the fourth student (along with Hermione, Harry, and Draco Malfoy). This can be attributed to the significantly less amount of time spent on Hagrid having Norbert, along with the differing circumstances on how they were caught. In the book, Ron wasn't helping deliver Norbert because he was being treated for injuries suffered when he was helping Hagrid take care of Norbert.

Hermione's got the sensitivity and maturity that's been left out of Ron, and Ron loosens up Hermione a bit, gets her to have some fun. They love each other and they bicker a bit, but they enjoy bickering, so we shouldn't worry about it.
