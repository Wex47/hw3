   Grindylows

Unaware that the hostages were not in any real danger, she was quite hysterical and fought so hard to return to the water that even Madame Maxime had difficulty restraining her. She was overjoyed when Harry, determined to rescue all the hostages, not just his own, returned to the surface with both Ron and her sister,
   Gabrielle
   . She thanked him and Ron profusely by giving them a kiss on each cheek, and after the incident became friendly toward the two. From then on she came to view Harry as a respected friend. Upon learning that she had been awarded twenty-five points, she remarked that she deserved zero, as she had failed to retrieve her "hostage." After the first two tasks, Fleur was in last place going into the Third Task.

Fleur left Hogwarts the day after with her family, saying goodbye to Harry and Ron. She kissed Harry on the cheek and proceeded to tell him that she hoped they would meet again. She was hoping to return to
   England
   to work and improve her patchy English.

Fleur was greatly upset over Moody's death and voiced the opinion that someone may have betrayed them, as the Death Eaters seemed to know the plan to escort Harry to safety.

  <p key="d3dc4ad3-a47e-43aa-bdb1-0492eadda15a">
   In her youth, Fleur was arrogant and conceited. Because of her beauty, she saw herself as 'a cut above' most others. For instance, when

   ." Her only redeeming feature seemed to be her genuine concern for her sister,
   Gabrielle
   , as seen when she fought to return to the water to save her, despite having previously suffered an attack by
   Grindylows
   in the Second Task of the
   <a href="Triwizard Tournament.html" key="ee0550cb-bd7e-44e6-99a6-a8faba957887" title="Triwizard Tournament">

   .
  </p>
  <p key="d47532b7-e489-417a-8373-6008fb3628c4">
   Fleur also had a very blunt nature, always speaking her mind, and therefore she often came off as rude and snobbish. She once made insulting comments about the state of the Hogwarts Christmas decorations and later even about Mrs Weasley (her future mother-in-law)'s home.
   This snobbish attitude was what made most other women, especially Molly and Ginny Weasley, dislike her.
  </p>
  <p key="54df5213-a4a1-48f6-8941-be702f85b56d">
   However, despite her high opinion of herself, Fleur's softer side was warm and caring. She fretted over the safety of those she loved, and if someone she cared about was in trouble she would always try to help them.
   She was also not a superficial person. In
   1997
   , after the

    Molly Weasley
   </a>
   . When Molly lamented over how the wedding was to be cancelled because of Bill's wounds, Fleur took offence at the implication of her being a shallow person and retorted that she loved Bill for more than his good looks, even stating that his acquired scars were — to her — proof of her husband's bravery. This genuine demonstration of her valuing true worth over surface glitter was what made those who initially disapproved of her (such as Molly and Ginny) finally begin to accept her. She also was also more perceptive than she appeared to be, as she correctly suspected that Molly had hoped Bill's injuries would cause Fleur to reject him and call off the wedding, meaning she had known all along that Molly (and others) disliked her.

   After being married in the summer of
   1997

   , be allowed to stay as well. While she played host to Harry, Hermione, Ron, and the others at her home, Harry noticed Fleur had become a lot more like her mother-in-law, Molly Weasley, as she displayed traits similar to Molly's such as worrying excessively and fussing in a maternal fashion over him and his friends.

   They had been dating for a year when Bill asked Fleur to marry him, and she accepted.

   While Fleur stayed at
   The Burrow
   in the summer of 1996, Harry seemed to be the only male who was unaffected by Fleur's beauty. This was possibly due to the platonic relationship that developed between them over the course of the tournament. At the Burrow, Fleur showed affection for Harry and treated him in a similar way as Mrs Weasley. She once brought him a breakfast tray while he was in bed and would often kiss him on both cheeks twice as a form of greeting and farewell. Like

   After Harry and several others came to her home at Shell Cottage the same year, Fleur tended to their wounds and generally took care of all of them. Having so many people at her home tested her patience, but she was still kind to Harry, of whom she still had a high opinion because of his efforts to save her sister. Through his marriage to Ginny Weasley, Harry became Fleur's brother-in-law and uncle to her three children. It's quite possible that Harry became close to Fleur's children and in return she became close to his. Due to their common ground as surviving Triwizard Champions, Harry and Fleur share a unique sense of camaraderie. This camaraderie reinforced their familial bond. Harry, as a frequent guest lecturer on
