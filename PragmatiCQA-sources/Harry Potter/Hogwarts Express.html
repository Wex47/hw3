    To promote J. K. Rowling's fourth Harry Potter book, a West Country Class Southern Railway locomotive, named Taw Valley, was painted crimson red and was given the Hogwarts Express nameplate.

    once claimed that the train was a GWR 5900 and was built in 1936,
    when the real locomotive was a GWR 4900 (indeed, the 5900 class does not exist) and was built in April of 1937. It is possible, however, that these details were intentionally changed to differentiate

    Ottaline Gambol

    In the films and books, it is suggested the staff of the train, in particular the witch with the food trolley, are able to pass through to see the driver of the train.  Under normal circumstances this wouldn't be possible, as there is no path through the tender to the cab of the engine.  However, the LNER A3/A4s featured a "corridor tender" that allowed for on the fly crew changes.  This was done to allow non stop passenger service from King's Cross to Scotland.  Crews would change over by way of a special corridor built through the tender that connected with the rest of the train.  This directly contradicts the films, as the tender used is a standard GWR tender, thus rendering safe passage between the locomotive and coaches impossible. However, it is also likely that the staff are able to use a standard teleportation or levitation spell for this purpose.

    The locomotive used for the Express, Olton Hall, raised eyebrows in the British train spotting and heritage rail communities, since for the films it bears the name "Hogwarts Castle." Many people thus refer to it as "the Hall that thinks it's a Castle", referring to a separate, larger class of engine built by the Great Western Railway.

    In real life, it is unlikely that a school such as Hogwarts would keep the engine and rolling stock for use only at certain parts of the year, as such a large locomotive would be uneconomical to keep for such minimal use. It is possible, therefore, that either both the locomotive and the coaches were on loan to other railway companies, or that the locomotive was used on some freight duties for the school throughout the duration of the terms.
