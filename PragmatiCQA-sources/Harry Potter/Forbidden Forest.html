   At some point during the mid- to late

   1980s

   Sleepwalking curse
   was unleashed when someone unwisely disturbed the
   Forest Vault
   , one of the five fabled
   Cursed Vaults
   of Hogwarts. This caused a number of students to sleepwalk into the forest, where some were gravely injured and even killed by the creatures living in there. Around this time, a student by the name of
   Jacob
   entered the forest hoping to break this curse, soliciting the aid of the Centaur
   Torvus
   . In order to open the vault so he could break the curse, the pupil's research indicated that a specific jewel encrusted arrowhead was required.
   The arrow
   being a precious heirloom, the Centaur refused to hand it over to a human, prompting Jacob to use magic to steal it from their camp. He was expelled from Hogwarts before it could be returned where it belonged.

   , someone once again tampered with the Forest Vault,
   prompting
   Jacob's younger sibling
   to locate and break the curse, just as their brother had tried to do. Distrusting of humans following Jacob's thievery, which lead to his own banishment from the herd for trying to help a human,
   Torvus
   challenged Jacob's sibling and his companions to a duel, and ultimately agreed to help them look into the future if Jacob's sibling could find the head of his arrow.

      Once led by Aragog. Acromantulas named Aragog and Mosag, together with their large family, lived in a dome-shaped nest in the very heart of the forest until Aragog's death during Harry's sixth year. Hundreds of the giant spiders dwelt there, all decended from the original pair. Aragog was a pet of Hagrid's fifty years ago.
      The Acromantulas were among the most dangerous
      beasts
      in the forest.

      At least fifty centaurs of fighting age lived in the forest. In typical centaur fashion, most of them avoided humans and did not involve themselves in human activities, simply watching portents in the stars and uttering cryptic responses to questions. Firenze was an exception, and was cast out from the herd and nearly killed because of it in Harry's fifth year. Hagrid knew many of them by name and had a civil (though sometimes frustrating) working relationship with them until partway through Harry's fifth year. When Hagrid brought Grawp home with him late in 1995, the centaurs objected.

      . When Hagrid and
      Madame Maxime
      acted as envoys to the giants in the summer and autumn of 1995, Hagrid learned of his mother's death and of the existence of a half-brother he had never known: Grawp, a full-blooded giant. Since Hagrid had no other family, and Grawp (being a runt for a giant at only 16 feet) was being bullied, Hagrid managed to smuggle Grawp all the way back to the forest. This was the last straw for some of the forest's inhabitants, specifically the centaurs.
