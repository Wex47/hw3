   Filius Flitwick was born somewhere in the British Isles into
   a wizarding family
   with the distant descent of a
   goblin
   , which accounted for his short stature. He was prejudged and foredoomed from an early age because of his ancestral connection to a different breed of being that was both regarded and treated as second-class citizens by much of the

   Brave in the face of adversity, however, whilst Flitwick once admitted to having been subjected to scrutiny from those around him from the minute he set his foot inside the castle,
   the future professor carried his burden remarkably well: Wise beyond his years and rather thick-skinned, he eventually came to regard those who judged him as ignorant rather than malevolent, reasoning that most people simply want those around them to be simple so that they would be easier to understand, as opposed to simply acknowledge the fact that people are complex. In this, he indirectly proved himself to be correct: During his
   Sorting Ceremony

   Flitwick was considerably more tolerant of disobedience than most of his fellow professors, known for rarely handing out detentions and deducting House Points, his more laid-back and forgiving teaching attitude making him particularly liked and respected by the students.

   , only warning her that it would appear in the exam. Additionally, when

He was eminently fair and never discriminated anyone regardless of their origin or whether they were of different house and treated all students the same. This is shown by how despite the wrongdoings
