   who acted as a highly trained law enforcement official for magical governments. Auror training was extremely difficult and intensive, so there were few qualified applicants. Aurors of different countries dealt with different high-risk situations that were most prominent to them.

  <p key="425ef910-b5cc-47e6-8171-1a7f58deea8a">
   Their training and areas of responsibility varied greatly depending on the type of threats for which they were prepared, and the magical education they received beforehand. In Britain, for example, the Aurors were trained to investigate crimes related to the
   Dark Arts
   , and to apprehend or detain

   In the United States however, they seemed to go up against any criminal posing a significant threat. When working for the
   Major Investigation Department
   , Aurors used a number of magical tools and devices such as the
   Real-Time Hex Indicator map
   and the
   USA Spell Contraventions map
   to track down illegal or especially flamboyant use of magic that could pose a threat to the
   International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy
   . Also, unlike their British counterpart, the American Aurors were divided into
   several divisions
   around North America to keep the peace, as opposed to all working within the
   same one
   .

   Each division presumably worked in collaboration with local offices of the

In other words, should a suspect or escaped convict manage to slip through the fingers of the Aurors in one place, the Auror Division in the area to which the criminal in question is believed to have fled would be contacted and would take over from there.

   would usually only work domestically and keep themselves within the boundaries of the Ministry's jurisdiction, they would occasionally be sent abroad during extraordinary circumstances, presumably after being granted prior permission to operate there from local magical authorities. Notably, some Aurors (including

  </h2>
  <p key="ac55a58e-6a39-4382-91c2-c25e8e939f23">
   "Auror" may be derived from "aurora", meaning "the dawn", from the Latin word "aurum", meaning "gold", or from the Hebrew word "Arur" (ארור), meaning someone who is cursed.
  </p>
  <p key="e16ca23c-a810-4e12-ba6d-8a09f514cb8c">
   Most likely, however, it is derived from the Latin word for ear, 'auris' and the related adjective, 'aural'. Since aurors are detectives (among other policing and justicial roles), they are those who listen for and receive information. Alternatively, if it is derived from "aurora" the name is possibly a metaphor based on the fact that Aurors are notorious Dark Wizard hunters. Indeed, after the night and the darkness it brings always come the aurora/dawn which always end it and restore light.

    Aurors can easily be comparable to elite Muggle national law enforcement officials, intelligence operatives, or military units such as the MI5, MI6, SAS, SBS, RAF Regiment, etc. Some require excellent academic credentials (but not all), have an exhausting selection process to weed out the weak, undergo extensive advance training (sometimes up to a year or two to be operationally ready in the field), and are employed for the most dangerous missions/criminals. And like many units in real-life, the Auror office is very selective based on character traits. An example would be how the American agency known as the CIA has often taken into account a potential candidate's personal history and moral compass through a series of intense psychological screening processes. Given this, there is likely a Wizarding equivalent of such screening in the process of becoming an Auror.
