    In the PC version, there is a secret level known as the Gryffindor Challenge. It's only accessible with the debug mode. Press the Delete key next to the help key, then move to beyond the door usually leading into the Gryffindor Tower's dormitories, then press the Delete key again, the level will then load. There are nine secrets, and ten challenge stars there. There is no timer for this level.

    In the Game Boy Advance version, Harry has to sneak into Filch's office to take a map though it isn't mentioned until

    The game, especially the console versions, has an alternate ending. If Harry were to lose the fight against the Basilisk, the chamber starts to collapse as Harry is knocked down on the ground, and Riddle, while brimming with power, speaks in Voldemort's voice:

    Unlike the previous game's console versions, this game's wizard card sets are more consistent with each playthrough, as the objectives for obtaining each card stay the same, and only certain set cards can have an extra copy to allow trading with certain NPC students for other specific cards.

   <li key="4e856bf6-b0d9-41a9-88c6-e8eff7dfee93">
    There is also a glitch that can occur in the Xbox/GameCube version of the game in that the player, by re-visiting
    Myrtle Warren
    's bathroom per day (as soon as it's been made available after a certain point in the game), can reopen a certain chest (which requires
    Skurge
    to unlock) to receive multiple copies of
    Godric Gryffindor
    's card, despite the fact that it is not one of the cards programed in the game for trading. This can also apply to the
    Merwyn the Malicious
    card, only since it is received from the
    Library
    , it can be "cloned" during the day or the night (and for that card, the player must know

    In the PlayStation 2 version, as soon as the player receives
    Expelliarmus
    , it is possible to use the spell to deflect the
    Locomotor Mortis
    spells from prefects at night to leave them surprised and shocked, all while giving Harry the chance to flee. Most prefects will respond with "Did you see that?!". Note that this only works in the aforementioned PlayStation 2 version, as that possibility was not carried over to the Xbox and GameCube versions.

    In the Game Boy Color version of the game, in the part where Harry, Ron and Lockhart are in the Chamber of Secrets, there is a notable exploit/glitch (as well as perhaps a programming oversight). When the three fight in a magical encounter and lose it, the screen resumes to Harry on the other side of the snakeskin and when you move on to the Chamber of Secrets, you still have Ron and Lockhart in the group and during the fighting of the Basilisk, Ron joins Harry and Fawkes in battling the monster and later Lockhart is said to have lost his memory despite his backfiring Memory Charm being skipped.

      Some things would keep resetting, which includes opened chest being closed again, with same number of beans, except that if you got the wizard card from the chest already, it would give one bean. It also includes cauldrons in Potions acting like you didn't already took a lesson and not letting you get potions (all other identical cauldrons will still give the potion after Potions class). It also includes Gold Wizard Card Challenge door to lock even after you unlocked it, but if you already got all silver cards, you could workaround by turning on debug mode and using a delete key to go through the door. But don't do it until you get all 40 silver since it would be cheating. Also number of secrets found in areas would reset to zero. However number of beans, cards, house points, spells learned, players available to duel, and record time in spell challenge will remain, and events like tasks for Polyjuice Potion, and classes would not repeat unless you start a new game.
