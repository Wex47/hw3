    Slytherin's Locket
   </b>
   was a piece of jewellery originally owned by
   Salazar Slytherin
   that became an heirloom of
   his family
   . It was a locket of heavy gold with a serpentine
   <i key="dfdadda8-20d9-4b1c-84f4-d517dd68ad81">
    S
   </i>
   in glittering green stone inlay on the front. After descending down from Slytherin, it came into the possession of the
   Gaunt family
   , and
   Marvolo Gaunt
   treasured this heirloom of this

   </a>
   heritage along with
   his ring heirloom
   . After Marvolo and his son
   Morfin Gaunt
   were sent to
   Azkaban
   , the locket was stolen by Marvolo's daughter
   Merope Gaunt
   , who sold it to
   Caractacus Burke
   for ten Galleons, a price far below what the priceless artefact was truly worth.
  </p>
  <p key="d099d249-6fec-40ff-bdb4-ac156768c49e">
   The locket was bought from
   Borgin and Burkes
   shop by a wealthy
   witch
   with an affinity for rare or valuable items named
   Hepzibah Smith
   . In the mid-20th century, Smith showed it to a young
   <a href="Tom Riddle.html" key="88c95b61-32be-47d8-942d-db923000318d" title="Tom Riddle">
    Tom Riddle
   </a>
   , who was an employee of Borgin and Burkes at the time. Riddle was interested in the locket (which was, after all, his birthright), and two days later, Hepzibah was found dead and her
   house-elf
   ,
   Hokey
   , made a full confession (Riddle presumably performed a
   False memory spell
   on her, as he did with his uncle Morfin years earlier).
   Using the murder of a
   Muggle tramp
   , Riddle turned the locket into his third
   Horcrux
   and hid it in a
   <a href="The Cave.html" key="c490c4b8-10ed-478c-9edd-b3df271c988c" title="The Cave">
    seaside cave
   </a>
   where he had hurt two children when he was in the orphanage.
   It was taken from the cave, however, by a defected
   Death Eater
   named
   Regulus Black
   with the attempt of having his house-elf,
   Kreacher
   , destroy it, but the elf was unable to destroy the locket.

   It was stolen by
   Mundungus Fletcher
   from
   12 Grimmauld Place

   's attempts to
   find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes
   , they decided to track down the locket first after retrieving the
   fake one placed by Regulus
   from the cave. They learned from Mundungus that it was taken from him by a Ministry bureaucrat named
   <a href="Dolores Umbridge.html" key="6f0164e3-94ea-483b-899e-adc3a7122e40" title="Dolores Umbridge">

   </a>
   ,
   and thus the trio
   infiltrated the Ministry
   , found Umbridge, and retrieved the locket.
   Ron and Harry retrieved
   Godric Gryffindor's Sword
   from the bottom of a
   frozen pool
   in the
   Forest of Dean
   and were able to destroy the Horcrux with it in the winter of
   1997
   .

   . When Slytherin created the locket, he enchanted it so that only a
   Parselmouth
   , like himself, could open it.
   When Slytherin left Hogwarts, he took the locket with him.
  </p>
  <p key="31870679-54af-48f2-ad7a-cf2995243a89">
   After Slytherin's death, the locket was passed down his family line, and eventually came to
   Marvolo Gaunt
   , who lived outside the village of
   Little Hangleton
   .
   The locket was one of two remaining Gaunt family heirlooms, the other being a
   ring
   inherited down the line of the
   Peverell family
   . Contradictory to his obsession with the two heirlooms, Marvolo permitted his daughter, Merope, whom he horribly mistreated, to wear the locket around her neck.
   After Marvolo and Morfin were imprisoned in
   Azkaban
   for assaulting both a

   and
   Ministry of Magic
   officials, Merope escaped the horrors of her childhood home and fled to
   London
   with
   Tom Riddle Snr
   Albus Dumbledore theorised that she had used a
   Love Potion
   to capture his affections.
  </p>
  <p key="fc4ebf9c-cabf-4a35-81ee-e2b72335948b">
   After they had eloped, Merope became pregnant with Riddle's child.
   During her pregnancy, Merope apparently stopped giving Riddle love potions out of the hope that he would freely choose to stay with her or that he would at least stay for his child. However, after coming to his senses, Riddle fled from Merope, returning to
   Little Hangleton
   .
   Desperate for money, Merope sold her only valuable possession, the locket, to
   Caractacus Burke
   for only ten
   galleons
   , either not realising that the locket was a priceless artefact or not caring.
   Not long afterwards, on New Year's Eve
   1926
   , she came to a Muggle
   orphanage
   and gave birth to her son,

   naming him after her father and husband. Merope Gaunt died shortly thereafter, leaving her son in the care of the orphanage.

   Many years later Tom Riddle graduated from Hogwarts, spurned a wide variety of prestigious offers and took a job at
   Borgin and Burkes
   , because of the potential to work with Dark artefacts. In the course of his work, Riddle visited the elderly witch
   Hepzibah Smith
   on many occasions and charmed her with flowers and compliments. After many visits Smith showed Riddle her most prized possessions:
   Helga Hufflepuff's Cup
   , an artefacts that she had inherited from her prestigious ancestor and the locket. She told the young man that she hoped he would appreciate the unique history the objects' possessed.
  </p>
  <p key="5b48f51a-6115-4047-812d-0ec41f47ea94">
   Hepzibah stated that both objects had considerable powers which she had not fully tested, and detailed the locket's historical value.
   Smith admitted she had paid a heavy price to
   Caractacus Burke
   to obtain the locket, and that Burke had previously bought it from "
   <i key="18aa488e-c584-4407-9a3f-ab03ae806e65">
    a ragged-looking woman
   </i>
   ,"(Merope Gaunt) having paid her a mere pittance for it.
   By this time, Riddle knew of his family lineage and knew the "ragged-looking woman" Smith referred to was his own mother.
   Riddle returned the cup without incident, but when the time came to replace the locket, Riddle briefly hesitated and a look of intense hunger washed across his face, before he let the locket slip through his fingers. According to Dumbledore, Riddle saw the locket as rightfully his due to its past connections, and is one of the reasons why he would covet it more.
  </p>
  <p key="524f8a4e-9777-4d4b-9225-61b2a31ef20e">
   Two days later Smith was found dead and her elderly
   house-elf
   ,
   Hokey
   , admitted to accidentally poisoning her mistress' cocoa (mistaking a little known) highly lethal poison for sugar.
   It was later believed by Albus Dumbledore, however, that Riddle had murdered Smith himself and
   embedded a false memory
   in the house-elf to escape detection, not unlike his murder of the
   Riddles
   in Little Hangleton a few years earlier.
   As Smith had quite a collection and many hiding places, it was assumed that the priceless artefacts were simply hidden in her house. Later, Smith's family discovered the cup and the locket were both missing, but by then Riddle had already quit his job and disappeared, not to be seen or heard from again for a decade.
   Riddle murdered a
   Muggle tramp
   and used that murder to make the locket into a
   Horcrux
   . This was a marked departure from his other
   Horcrux
   murders, as he tended to choose deaths significant to him in the creation of Horcruxes.

   <i key="f1543614-ee4a-4e26-853c-5f21938f6084">
    committed an act so horrifying
   </i>
   " that he shocked fellow orphans
   Dennis Bishop
   and
   Amy Benson
   into muteness.
   In addition to the natural barriers, Voldemort hid the locket in this cave with several magical enchantments to guard it. First, the cave could not be
   Apparated
   into or Disapparated out from; second, an unmarked door that could only be opened with the payment of blood wiped upon the cave walls; third, an
   Inferi
   -infested lake; fourth, an invisible rowboat that would transport only one wizard at a time safely across the lake; fifth, a stone basin filled with a
   green potion
   that could not be parted, vanished, transfigured, or otherwise made to change its properties.
  </p>
  <p key="bb09c224-92bf-4bdd-8fb1-0f69504a7f55">
   The only way to remove the potion from the basin, thereby exposing the locket at the bottom, was to drink it. The potion caused unbearable pain to the drinker and forced them to relive their worst memories and face their worst fears, as though in a nightmare.
   If the drinker had any strength left, in their desperate thirst they would be forced to drink

   Late in the 1970s, Lord Voldemort requested the use of a
   House-elf
   from his
   Death Eaters
   .
   A young
   Death Eater
   , Regulus Black volunteered the
   <a href="House of Black.html" key="dc8c47c5-faf9-4e11-8c1a-42d6f2da82f0" title="House of Black">
    Black family
   </a>
   house-elf
   Kreacher
   , whom the Dark Lord used to test the locket's defences. When he had seen the cave's effectiveness in action, he left Kreacher to die on the island in the middle of the dark lake.
   However, he overlooked the house-elves' special
   magic
   binding them to their masters, considering it beneath him and not of importance. As Regulus had instructed Kreacher to do all that Voldemort asked of him and then return home, Kreacher was able to Apparate out of the cave and back to his master Regulus. The younger Black was infuriated at the mistreatment of Kreacher, and having seen the lengths to which the Dark Lord would go, turned against Voldemort.
  </p>
  <p key="6e4c5b72-c3c5-4308-880a-2d92ff229047">
   During Regulus's time as a
   Death Eater
   , Lord Voldemort had made veiled references to his
   Horcruxes
   , believing that no one would deduce exactly how he had come to be immortal. Regulus had, by the time of his defection, concluded that Voldemort had made a Horcrux and that it was the object that Voldemort had forced Kreacher to help him protect.
   Having reached these conclusions, Regulus told Kreacher to take him back to the cave, where he crossed the lake with the house-elf and drank the potion himself.
   He instructed Kreacher to switch the true locket with a
   fake one
   , and to take the Horcrux home and destroy it. He ordered Kreacher to leave the cave without him, and
   Kreacher
   , with the Horcrux in hand, watched in horror as Black was dragged beneath the lake by the Inferi. After his master's death,
   Kreacher
   escaped with the locket to the Black family home,
   12 Grimmauld Place
   .
  </p>
  <p key="286c61a1-9b16-4966-a59a-310acb1c7f17">
   Over the ensuing years, Kreacher was unable to destroy the locket, no matter what means he tried, although he did come to the conclusion that the locket needed to be opened to be destroyed.
   For failing to obey his master's orders, Kreacher brutally punished himself. He placed the locket in a glass case in the drawing room and left it undisturbed for many years until the
   <a href="Order of the Phoenix.html" key="1151c32e-d4f0-4bc5-bb5e-473f0e592554" title="Order of the Phoenix">

   began to use the house as headquarters in the summer of
   1995

   Horcrux
   Voldemort had made. He shared his theory about Horcruxes with Harry during his

   Albus Dumbledore spent a great deal of time in his final years attempting to locate any Horcruxes Voldemort had made, a search which proved both fruitful and disastrous with the finding of
   Marvolo Gaunt's Ring
   in the summer of
   1996
   . Although he successfully destroyed the
   Horcrux
   , he was infected with a debilitating
   curse
   that left him only a year to live. However, Dumbledore continued his search for more clues that might lead to the discovery of the other Horcruxes.
  </p>
  <p key="cdcda822-8037-4452-a800-e4c982aa74ba">
   Believing he had located one, Dumbledore and Harry left the school one evening in June of
   1997
   in the hopes of obtaining and destroying it.
   Apparating to the

    cave
   </a>
   by the sea, they made their way among the waves and spray. Upon reaching the inside of the cave, Dumbledore surmised the location of the door (through sensing the magic) and made the payment himself over Harry's objections, remarking that Harry's blood as far more valuable than his own. The pair ventured into the depths of the cave, walking along the shores of the vast lake. Dumbledore abruptly stopped, startling Harry, and located an invisible chain suspended above the lake. The chain raised a small boat out of the water's depths on which they sailed to the island in the middle of the lake.
  </p>
  <p key="7d543fcd-e4f8-4998-8ce0-0ce52b4d4787">
   Once there, Dumbledore attempted to obtain the locket, but could not penetrate the
   green potion
   . Extracting a promise from Harry, he began to drink the potion, and when it became too much to bear, Harry forced it down his throat.
   When the potion was finished, Harry attempted to conjure water to revive Dumbledore, but was unsuccessful due to the cave's defences. He then attempted to draw water from the lake, which awakened the
   Inferi

   While searching the house the next morning, Ron noticed a small sign on the door to Regulus Arcturus Black's room, bearing his full name.
   Having discovered R.A.B., the trio searched the house, finding no sign of the locket, until Hermione recalled that it had been thrown out during their cleaning two years earlier. In a last ditch effort, Harry summoned Kreacher, who told them the whole story about the locket, including he had salvaged it and how it was later stolen by
   Mundungus Fletcher
   .
   Harry ordered Kreacher to find Fletcher, who told them that

   Over the following month, Harry, Hermione, and Ron scouted the

   and developed an elaborate plan to get into the building and retrieve the locket.
   Setting out on

   infiltrated
   the premises without difficulty. Once inside, they were forced to separate, with Ron going to work on maintenance and Hermione leaving to take stenography in court proceedings, leaving Harry alone to search the building.

   From under the cloak, Harry stunned Umbridge, and Hermione took the locket after conjuring a
   replacement
   . The trio narrowly managed to escape, but were forced to abandon
   12 Grimmauld Place

   Out in the wilderness for months, the trio were forced to merely keep the locket in safekeeping until a way could be found to destroy it.
   As they wandered listlessly up and down the country, they took turns wearing the locket, which began to wear heavily at their physical and emotional health.
   Harry once thought, the first time that he wore the locket, "... and it seemed to Harry as he sat there ... that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left.". This could possibly be a foreshadow to the moment before Harry's death when he thinks, "Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes." While Harry and Hermione held up well against the negative forces of the locket,

    Ron
   </a>
   was particularly susceptible to the locket's powers, causing him much discomfort and unexplained anger. One evening weeks into their journey, the trio overheard another band of fugitives discussing current events. In the course of the conversation, they learned that Ron's sister,
   <a href="Ginevra Weasley.html" key="c4e442e1-a9cb-463b-98bf-0bcd76909c66" title="Ginevra Weasley">
    Ginny Weasley
   </a>
   was among a band of students punished for attempting to steal
   Godric Gryffindor's Sword
   from the
   Headmaster's office
   at Hogwarts.
   This upset Ron, who was wearing the locket, but Harry and Hermione were revelling in the realisation the sword could destroy Horcruxes. This pushed Ron over the edge emotionally, and after a row with Harry he stormed off into the night.

   Harry was able to find
   Godric Gryffindor's Sword
   at the bottom of a frozen pond.
   After a a couple of failed attempts to retreive the sword Harry realised what he had to do. Stripping down, Harry waded into the freezing pool to retrieve the sword. He described the sensation of being submerged in the icy water as incredibly painful. Rather than allow him to acquire the sword, the locket around his neck tried to kill him both by strangling him and keeping him under the water, nearly drowning him.
   Ron returned and rescued Harry from drowning.

   After a brief reconciliation, Harry decided that Ron must be the one to destroy the locket, since he recovered the sword.

   Following Harry's
   break-in of Gringotts
   and theft of
   Helga Hufflepuff's cup
   (another Horcrux), Voldemort became aware that Harry was hunting down Voldemort's Horcruxes in an attempt to defeat the Dark wizard once and for all. With this information, Voldemort decided to return to the places he had hidden each fragment of his soul, check to see if they were safe, and redouble their protection. Deciding
   Marvolo Gaunt's ring
   was in the most danger (Dumbledore, knowing that Voldemort's middle name was Marvolo, might have made the connection between him and the
   Gaunt family
   ), he checked in the
   Gaunt shack
   and found that the Horcrux was missing. He then decided to visit the seaside cave and check on the locket, and was furious to discover that the locket was gone as well.
   With murder in his heart, Voldemort decided to head to

   Before becoming a

   Hepzibah Smith

   and the only way to open the locket was to speak to it in

   would have an affinity rather than an aversion to it, and not be hindered by it.
   The locket also had magic in place to protect itself; when Ron attempted to destroy it, it created a vision to show him his worst fears and deepest insecurities. At times, it also burned very hot, such as when Harry wore it in proximity to
   Nagini
   , another Horcrux, and when he tried to pick it up while its continued existence was being threatened. It even attempted to strangle Harry to prevent him from retrieving Gryffindor's sword, knowing that he would use it to destroy the locket.

   to have a visible, although immaterial presence; when the locket's doors were open, Riddle's eye could be seen watching from inside. On a similar note, the locket may also have had the potential to possess individuals, in a manner similar to another Horcrux (
   Tom Riddle's Diary
   ), as Harry saw "a trace of scarlet" in Ron's eyes at one point during the locket's attempt to prevent him from destroying it.
