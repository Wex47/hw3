   The Sword of Gryffindor was made in the 10th century by

   , the magical world's most skilled metalworkers, and was therefore enchanted. Fashioned from pure silver, it was inset with rubies, the stone that represented Gryffindor in the hour-glasses that counted the House points at Hogwarts. Godric Gryffindor's name was engraved just beneath the hilt.
  </p>
  <p key="c36cd6a3-0828-469d-9a2d-bffd7d72a7e3">
   The sword was made to Godric Gryffindor's specifications by
   Ragnuk the First
   , finest of the
   <a href="Goblin.html" key="70ca3f0c-8396-4ea1-9e48-dc927a39461b" title="Goblin">

   </a>
   silversmiths
   , and therefore King (in goblin culture, the ruler did not work less than the others, but more skillfully). When it was finished, Ragnuk coveted it so much that he pretended that Gryffindor had stolen it from him, and sent minions to steal it back. Gryffindor defended himself with his
   wand
   , but did not kill his attackers. Instead he sent them back to their king bewitched, to deliver the threat that if he ever tried to steal from Gryffindor again, Gryffindor would unsheathe the sword against them all. The goblin king took the threat seriously and left Gryffindor in possession of his rightful property, but remained resentful until he died.
  </p>
  <p key="de56a56f-bac8-4875-acd6-5e37918139e5">
   The story persisted, in some sections of the goblin community, that Gryffindor actually stole the sword from Ragnuk. This was a result of the cultural understanding of ownership that goblin-made items rightfully belonged to goblins, rather than the heirs of those who may have purchased them, a cultural understanding that should have been honoured by the wizards.

   This caused the sword to be imbued with
   basilisk
   venom
   (since goblin-made items only absorb what makes them stronger) and hence gained the ability to destroy Horcruxes, although Harry instead used one of the Basilisk's fangs to destroy the diary, which eliminated the sentient memory of

   Before he died, Dumbledore entrusted the sword to Harry in his

   Rufus Scrimgeour
   claimed that the sword was not Dumbledore's to give away. The Minister stated that it was a school heirloom, not personal property and refused to give it to Harry. This caused the trio substantial problems. Dumbledore placed an

   of the sword in his office, because he knew that the
   British Ministry of Magic
   would try to confiscate it and hid the real sword in a hole in the wall behind his portrait. Sure enough, the sword on display in the Headmaster's office was later taken by

   Upon discovering where Harry and his friends were camping out, Dumbledore's portrait instructed Snape to give Harry the real sword without Harry knowing that it was Snape, in case Voldemort found out through
   Legilimency
   on Harry. It also needed to be recovered "under conditions of need and valour". To fulfil these conditions, Snape deposited the real sword in a frozen lake in the
   Forest of Dean
   and used his corporeal
   Doe
   Patronus
   to guide Harry to the sword. When Harry tried to retrieve the sword, the
   Locket of Slytherin
   closed around his neck and attempted to strangle him, sensing that its destruction was near.

    In the series the sword's size changes often, on the cover of the seventh novel it looks more like a large dagger than sword, as mentioned above it appears like a scimitar in the American version illustrations. In the films the handle appears to have a one handed handle but when Neville wields it, its handle is relatively long and is more a hand and a half. In the PS2 version of the game, it is as short as a short sword, while the PS1, Xbox and Gamecube versions have its length and design akin to a normal broadsword. Some fans theorise that it was enchanted to adjust its size appropriately to the worthy wielder's size and style of combat, single or double-handed. This has yet to be confirmed or discredited.

    Twice, the sword presented itself to a Gryffindor who doubted that they belonged. Harry Potter pulled the sword out of the Sorting Hat, when he was worrying that he should have been in Slytherin, and Neville Longbottom had an argument with the Sorting Hat; The hat wanted to put Neville in Gryffindor but Neville was scared and wanted to be put in Hufflepuff. Later, he pulled the sword out of the hat.

    Ironically, though the sword is a Gryffindor relic, it is made of silver which is a Slytherin colour. However, this is likely out of necessity as a solid gold sword would be far too heavy to lift, let alone wield. In addition, gold is also a rather unsuitable metal for a sword: besides its weight being unruly for a weapon, it is also an incredibly soft metal with a very low melting point; a sword of ordinary steel could easily damage or cleave right through it. Gold is so soft that a brick of it the size of a match box can be hammered down to cover an area the size of the average tennis court.

   <li key="25f36bd2-0719-473a-aa5b-680f10f92aab">
    Its composition of silver is fitting for a sword used to slay dark creatures and destroy dark objects as silver is often used in mythology as a metal that can kill monsters such as Vampires, Werewolves, and more.

    Judging from the era which it was supposedly made, it could be argued that the sword should have taken the appearance of a pattern-welded Anglo-Saxon sword, perhaps not dissimilar to the description of the poison-ivy bladed sword

    It is also fitting as a magical weapon as silver is an incredible conductor of electricity which, like magic, is a form of energy, making the comparison all the more fitting.

    In the film adaptation, the design of the Sword of Gryffindor has a blatant resemblance to one of the ceremonial swords of Napoleon Bonaparte. The only few differences would be the silver hilt, a label of Godric Gryffindor on the handle and the rubies on the pommel and the guard.
   </li>
   <li key="a3302639-bcdd-408d-a9d2-b06526c3f21e">
    Interestingly, the sword's quality of imbibing only that which strengthens it corresponds with muggle philosopher Frederich Nieztche's famous quote, "That which does not kill me only makes me stronger." And this is very much the principle that the Sword of Gryffindor exemplifies.

    Ironically, it also has qualities mentioned by Snape during a lecture on the nature of the Dark Arts, that they are mutating, ever-changing, indestructible. Funny that a sword that was used to destroy the darkest and foulest of magical objects would in and of itself be similar in nature to the forces it was being used to fight against, much like the classic saying, "Fight fire with fire." And this fits the sword due to it being the legacy of Gryffindor, whose house corresponds with the element of fire.

   <li key="0fa7fd88-0db9-4674-b8f3-a82996493c4d">
    The sword's rubies and silver blade and possession of a man whose emblem is a lion and possesses red hair and lion-like features is reminiscent of the character Lion-O from the 80's cartoon series, Thundercats and the Sword of Omens. This, and also the fact that only the worthy are able to wield or summon each sword, and that they are used against an enemy with a serpent as their insignia and motif, Voldemort and Mumm-Ra for Gryffindor students Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom, and Lion-O respectively.

   <li key="d276d92d-80ef-432e-94af-7459efdf5534">
    The issue of the sword's ownership is discussed frequently in the series. By wizarding law it is believed to belong to Gryffindor's chosen heirs, however by goblin culture it should have been returned to the artisan or their family, a cultural law that should have been honoured by the purchaser and makes wizarding possession of the sword tantamount to theft regardless of Gryffindor came to own it. Hermione states to Scrimgeour that it belongs to Harry since it appeared to him in the Chamber of Secrets (along with the popular but incorrect fan theory that Harry is a descendant of Godric Gryffindor which technically would make it his) while Scrimgeour himself viewed it as an important historical artefact which is known to present itself to worthy Gryffindors but is not theirs automatically. As Gryffindor has no known descendants, the sword would technically, by wizarding law, be the property of Hogwarts along with the Sorting Hat, though it could be argued that the way it presents itself to a 'true Gryffindor' is Gryffindor choosing an heir each time.

    A fan theory states that Voldemort had the Sword when going to the Potter's house intending to use Harry's death to turn the Sword into a Horcrux just as he'd done with the other Hogwarts Founders relics (the Locket, the Cup, and the Diadem). However as Voldemort was defeated when trying to kill Harry, he was not able to turn the Sword into a Horcrux. The theory also states that after Voldemort's defeat, the Sword returned to the sorting hat as it was not found in the Potter's house in the aftermath. However this theory is not confirmed or hinted at during any point in the series.

     The question of why a wizard would need a sword, though often asked, is easily answered. In the days before the International Statute of Secrecy, when wizards mingled freely with Muggles, they would use swords to defend themselves just as often as wands. Indeed, it was considered unsporting to use a wand against a Muggle sword (which is not to say it was never done). Many gifted wizards were also accomplished duellists in the conventional sense, Gryffindor among them."

     There have been many enchanted swords in folklore. The Sword of Nuadu, part of the four legendary treasures of Tuatha Dé Danann, was invincible when drawn. Gryffindor's sword owes something to the legend of Excalibur, the sword of King Arthur, which in some legends must be drawn from a stone by the rightful king. The idea of fitness to carry the sword is echoed in the sword of Gryffindor's return to worthy members of its true owner's house

     There is a further allusion to Excalibur emerging from the lake when Harry must dive into a frozen forest pool to retrieve the sword in Deathly Hallows (though the location of the sword was really due to a spiteful impulse of Snape's to place it there), for in other versions of the legend, Excalibur was given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake, and was returned to the lake when he died.

     Within the magical world, physical possession is not necessarily a guarantee of ownership. This concept applies to the three Deathly Hallows, and also to Gryffindor's sword. I am interested in what happens when cultural beliefs collide. In the Harry Potter books, the most militant of the goblin race consider all goblin-made objects to be theirs by right, although a specific object might be made over to a wizard for his life-span upon a payment of gold. Witches and wizards, like Muggles, believe that once payment has been made, the object belongs to them and their descendants or legatees in perpetuity. This is a clash of values without a solution, because each side has a different concept of what is right. It therefore presents Harry with a difficult moral dilemma when Griphook demands the sword as payment for his services in Deathly Hallows.
