   Because of his fondness for Muggles, in 1992, he drafted a proposition for the Ministry called the

   attempted to sabotage Arthur's plans; by planting Riddle's diary on Arthur's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and bury the legislation.

   in 1994, he was adamant about remaining incognito. He insisted on putting up their tents by hand and cooking their food outside with a fire.

In the end, he managed to get the fire lit with Hermione's help and seemed to have a great time. When

His greatest ambition was to find out how Muggles were able to keep aeroplanes airborne. Arthur's love of engineering and Muggle technology was inherited by his sons Fred and George in that they too possessed Arthur's ingenuity and almost compulsive need to invent or modify things from their intended purposes, resulting in many of the twins' joke items.
