   According to Scholastic, Stine's 1996 Publication Agreement stated that he would be the sole writer of each main series book. Scholastic alleged that Stine wrote the first sixteen books in the series independently, after which he began to employ freelancers. Scholastic accused Stine of allowing freelancers to make the majority of his creative decisions while he contributed "minimal" changes. Scholastic went as far as to accuse ghostwriters for the declining popularity of the series.

  <p key="5e5b579c-1f04-46e0-aedb-96d0ded4c81e">
   While Stine and Parachute deny ever allowing ghostwriters to write their main series, Parachute claimed that they employed freelancers to help create outlines. However, they claimed that the initial concept and final books were written by Stine. Parachute also argued that the sole writer clause in Stine's Publication Agreement was designed to prevent plagiarism, not to prevent Stine from receiving assistance.
