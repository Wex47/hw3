  <p key="5b555db1-879f-4fc3-aba1-7a5abf67caf9">
   Jim Thiesen first entered the art industry when he studied drawing and painting at the Art Students League in New York. His first notable illustration work was in 1983 with a three page comic for
   <i key="1dd14943-37ff-4388-9ba5-286ead9a1d95">
    Heavy Metal
   </i>
   Magazine. He would follow that by taking jobs illustrating packaging for action figures and helping design new toy lines. In 1987, Thiesen, with the suggestion of his agent, Sal Barracca, began to illustrate book covers, notably for horror and fantasy books. He would soon be pigeon-holed as "The Horror Guy", but given his love for the genre, he wasn't completely against it.

   compared to Jacobus' more ultra-saturated and cartoonish scenes. Thiesen parted ways on the project after finishing the cover art and continued working on other cover works for other horror authors such as Stephen King and Richard Matheson.
