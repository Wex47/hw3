   Jack runs inside and warns his mother to stay upstairs. Jack tries to think of how he can defeat the aliens. Jack remembers when he knocked over the deputy mayor's water bottle. Jack deduces that the aliens' weakness must be water. Jack grabs his water rifle and fills it up. When Jack goes outside, he sees a crowd of people circling his house. They are all possessed and trying to get him. Jack sprays the crowd with his Super Soaker. The whole crowd begins laughing at him. The aliens can't be killed by water. The crowd keeps moving closer to Jack trying to hug him. Mr. Fleshman shows up and Jack thinks that he has come to help defeat the aliens. However, Mr. Fleshman reveals that he isn't a government agent, he is the alien leader. Mr. Fleshman tears off his mask and reveals his real face. Mr. Fleshman looks like a giant brain; he is pink and slimy. Mr. Fleshman hugs Jack, but Jack manages to enter into Mr. Fleshman like the Body Squeezers did. Once Jack has possessed Mr. Fleshman, he falls down, dead. Jack leaves Mr. Fleshman's body, and he realizes that entering the alien's brain killed it.
