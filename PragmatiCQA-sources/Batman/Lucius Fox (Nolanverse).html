   Batpod
   and a new Batsuit that was designed for more efficient mobility. In addition, Fox participated in his employer's vigilante activities both in the
   Batcave
   and in the field as his technical assistant and reconnaissance expert, and used his professional duties as cover. Fox eventually learned that Bruce had expanded on sonar technology and developed an advanced surveillance system that could listen in and track the movement of any of the thousands of cell phones in Gotham, but, to ensure that the system was not misused, Bruce designed it so that only Fox could control it. Since that essentially contradicted everything that Bruce believed in, Fox agreed to help but said that he would resign if the machine was not destroyed after

   Lucius and Bruce became friends almost immediately after Bruce returned to the family business. At first, Bruce "worked" with Lucius in the Applied Sciences Division. But, this job was an excuse to gather the equipment Bruce needed to become Batman. Lucius caught onto the fact that Bruce was up to something else entirely and told Bruce that much and not to treat Lucius like an idiot. This impressed Bruce greatly and Lucius allowed Bruce free access to necessary equipment. Lucius's subsequent assistance in dealing with the League of Shadows attack on Gotham City cemented the trust and friendship between them as Bruce appointed Lucius Fox the company CEO and trusted him with day to day business matters.

   Subsequent adventures saw Lucius going in the field to support Bruce as Batman. It is implied that while Lucius saw the value of Batman's work, he also enjoyed the excitement that came with assisting Batman. Lucius, did however, disagree with Bruce's building of a large scale version of a sonar device to stop the Joker and while agreeing to help because of the situation, he said he could not stay in Bruce's employee if the device where still there. In the end, the device was destroyed and he remained as company CEO.

   Lucius stood by Bruce's side when the company began to crumble due to financial problems and was demoted to company President after Miranda Tate became company head. Lucius helped Bruce Wayne return as Batman by providing necessary equipment and counseled Bruce when he could. Lucius also played a considerable part in Batman's final plan to stop Talia. After the supposed death of Bruce, Lucius attended his friend's funeral service at Wayne Manor and subsequently went back to running Wayne Enterprises. He will be repairing Wayne Enterprise the way it was. He also learned The Bat's autopilot was fixed by Bruce Wayne before Bane's attack, suggesting he may have figured out Bruce Wayne was alive.
