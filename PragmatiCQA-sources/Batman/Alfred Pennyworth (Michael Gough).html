   Alfred Pennyworth was raised in an unspecified area of
   England
   . According to
   one account
   , he had a brother named Wilfred and a younger sister named Margaret. The same story claimed Alfred had served as a butler at Buckingham Palace.
  </p>
  <p key="b9b82334-a8b2-4822-ba27-9e696de3e665">
   Alfred eventually came to live in
   Gotham City
   , and was employed as a butler by Dr.

   and his wife,

   Bruce
   . When the Waynes were murdered by
   an unknown mugger
   , Alfred became Burce's legal guardian. He helped him organized both social engagements and prepare for his war on crime as Batman. Bruce often regarded Alfred as a father figure rather than just his butler.

   Alexander Knox
   , who gave him a crumpled dollar as a tip. When
   Commissioner Gordon
   left the event for
   urgent reasons
   , Alfred informed Bruce whilst he conversed with with Knox and
   Vicki Vale
   . Alfred's comments gave Bruce prompting to investigate further, before which he gave Alfred a series of instructions in his absence.

   During Bruce's later date with Vicki, they joined Alfred in the kitchen. During it, he told Vale about an incident involving a horse-riding where he'd been caped in mud. As the evening got late, Alfred excused himself to got to bed. The following morning, Alfred ran into Vicki as she left the manor. When she wished him well on their trip, Alfred responded that they weren't leaving the city any time soon. This tipped off Vicki that Bruce had lied to her about leaving town.

   When Bruce returned later that evening after
   being caught in the middle of a gunfight
   at
   Gotham Square
   , Alfred provided him a drink of water and let him know that Vale had called to check on him. He encouraged Bruce to open up to her, noticing he'd become smitten with her. Bruce quickly changed the subject by informing Alfred that Napier had survived and had taken over
   Carl Grissom
   's organization. Leaving to get him police files for Napier, Alfred voiced his approval for Bruce to pursue Vicki further.

   Alfred later returned at the end of Joker's
   Smylex Commercial
   , prompting Bruce to turn it off to investigate. Noting Napier's proficiency with Chemistry and his gloating in the commercial, the two set out to buy as many health and beauty products to identify
   the deadly toxin
   that he'd used in the products. Alfred later relayed a message to Bruce of
   an upcoming date
   with Vicki. However, Bruce quickly remembered they'd not agreed to meet and realized it had been set up by the Joker.

   After Bruce had brought Vicki to the Batcave, Alfred suggested that he focus on his relationship with her and let her know about his "double life". When Bruce remains dismissive, he let him know that she would eventually figure it out, one way or another. When Bruce returned after an encounter with the Joker, he asked Alfred to dig up files on Thomas and Martha's murder. Alfred did as he asked, but suggested he'd let the past go.

   Before or during Joker announcement that he'd be hosting the
   200th Anniversary Parade
   , Alfred met with Vicki, who revealed she knew Bruce was Batman. Deciding to let her see him, Alfred brought her into the Batcave to speak with him. He then left the two to discuss it before he went after the Joker.

     According to one account, Alfred remained in
     Bruce
     's employ at
     Wayne Manor
     and supported him in fighting various costume criminals, including former ally
     Two-Face
     . The two also abandoned their search for Selina, concluding she'd either cut contact with them or left the city for good. At some point, Alfred learned that his sister Margaret had died in a car crash with her husband, leaving his niece

     Alfred, after years of service to Bruce, was stricken with a rare disease. His niece, Barbara Wilson, came to visit him at Wayne Manor, and intended to take him away in the belief that Alfred was only a servant to Bruce. However, Alfred assured Bruce in a later conversation after Bruce learned of his illness that Alfred's only regret in life was that he had never been able to assist Bruce in his crusade in person, and concluded that spending his life tending to heroes had been a worthy one. As Alfred's condition worsened, it was revealed that he was suffering from
     MacGregor's Syndrome
     and that the only person who could cure it was Dr. Victor Fries, aka
     Mr. Freeze

Once Batman defeated Freeze, he was able to convince the former doctor to provide the cure, and introduced it into Alfred's system.

After Bruce returned, Alfred informed him of Robin's actions in the Burnside protests and the aftermath of the actions. Alfred also passed the information he'd collect to Bruce, allowing him to learn about Drake further.

    Sam Hamm
