   Eighteen months after a destructive battle with General Zod in Metropolis,
   Superman
   has become a controversial figure. Billionaire
   Bruce Wayne
   , who has operated in Gotham City as the vigilante
   Batman
   for nearly two decades, sees Superman as a potential threat to humanity. After learning of Batman's form of punishment,
   Clark Kent

   to allow him to import kryptonite retrieved from the Indian Ocean following Zod's terraforming attempt, claiming he wants to maintain it as a "deterrent" against Kryptonians, but she denies the request. He also makes side dealings with Finch's subordinate and demands access to Zod's body and the Kryptonian scout ship.

   Wayne attends Luthor's party at LexCorp, where he meets an antiquities dealer named
   Diana Prince
   , and retrieves encrypted data from the company's mainframe. While decrypting the drive at the Batcave, Wayne has a dream of a post-apocalyptic world, where he leads a group of rebels against a fascist Superman. He is snapped out of the dream by an unidentified being who warns him of
   Lois Lane
   's
crucial role in the future, and urges him to find "

   " before vanishing. Wayne later discovers that Luthor is not only experimenting 
with kryptonite, but also investigating metahumans. One of them is Prince herself, who is an immortal warrior. Wayne admits to
   Alfred Pennyworth
   that he plans to steal the kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman.

  <p key="d10f2f3b-5678-4fac-9603-44b2b1293539">
   At a congressional hearing, as Finch questions Superman on the validity of his actions, a bomb planted by Luthor explodes, killing everyone present but Superman. Believing he should have detected the bomb, and frustrated by his failure to save the people, Superman goes into self-imposed exile. Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite, planning to use it to battle Superman by building a powered exoskeleton, and creating a kryptonite grenade launcher and a kryptonite-tipped spear. Meanwhile, Luthor enters the Kryptonian ship and learns details of its alien technology.

   Luthor kidnaps
   Martha Kent
   , Clark's adoptive mother. He reveals that he has manipulated Superman and Batman by fueling their distrust for each other. He demands Superman kill Batman in exchange for Martha's life. Superman tries to reason with Batman, but Batman instead fights Superman and eventually subdues him. Before Batman can kill him with the spear, Superman urges Batman to "

  <p key="a8a78b10-44d1-477f-992b-4b5ee4aceb65">
   Luthor executes his backup plan, unleashing a genetically-engineered monster with DNA from both Zod's body and his own. However, Prince arrives unexpectedly. Revealing her metahuman nature, she joins forces with Batman and Superman to fight the creature. They are soon outmatched by its power, as it can absorb and redirect energy. Realizing that it is vulnerable to kryptonite, Superman retrieves the kryptonite spear. With Batman and Prince's help containing it, Superman impales the monster, killing it. In its last moments however, the creature fatally stabs a weakened Superman with one of its bone protrusions.

   Luthor is arrested, and Batman confronts him in prison, warning Luthor that he will always be watching him. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats, and that something bigger is coming to Earth. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, and Wayne, Lane, Martha, and Prince attend a private funeral for him in Smallville. Martha gives an envelope to Lane which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Wayne reveals to Prince that he plans to form a team of metahumans, starting with those from Luthor's files, to help protect the world in Superman's absence. After they leave, the dirt atop Clark's coffin begins to levitate.

   Four days before Man of Steel's release, it was announced that Zack Snyder,
   David S. Goyer
   and
   Christopher Nolan
   would return to their respective roles—director, screenwriter, and executive producer (albeit in a lesser role than in the previous film), for a

   <i key="ef0fff8c-50d8-4614-b678-4bea7cd9fc09">

   film featuring Superman.
   The movie was officially announced at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2013. The film is set for a 2016 release and will feature Superman and Batman meeting for the first time in a cinematic format, with most of the first film's main cast set to return, while a new actor will be chosen to play Batman.
   Two tentative titles for the new film,

   Filming will start sometime in 2014 in Toronto, Ontario instead of Vancouver.

   Marvel Cinematic Universe

   Performances have been praised, notably
   Ben Affleck

   Jeremy Irons
   as Alfred. However, the film received a lot of criticism from fans for the character's willingness to kill criminals and endanger bystanders. Though this criticism had also been leveled at the character in

   's was somewhat hypocritical, as he seemed to target Superman for collateral damage in the film but was also responsible for a somewhat disregard for the lives of others. Eisenberg's portrayal of Lex Luthor has also been criticized, with many believing that he had been "miscast" in the role and was trying to emulate
   Heath Ledger
   's
   Joker
   .
  </p>
  <p key="9eb2bd77-c44f-4ad9-bfc5-4a21ba414431">
   Criticism was also directed at how the film seemed to take Batman's favor rather than place equal focus on both him and Superman. It's plot has also been widely criticized as convoluted and mismanaged, often how contrived many of the plot-points felt to necessetate moments, such as the fight itself and Superman's death. Some have also noted that the film seemed to be created specifically simply for the spectacle of the two title character fighting. The setup for the
   Justice League
   in the film has also been criticized, often for their "unnatural" feeling and taking focus away from both title characters to build up a "cinematic universe".

   The Extended Cut of the film, which added an addition 31 minutes of time, received comparatively more favorable reception, often for adding more cohesion and explaining Superman's actions better than the Theatrical Cut. However, some have noted that it still is the same film (both in tone and narrative) and was unlikely to change less-favorable opinions.
