   Despite finally getting his heart's desire, Tim had his doubts about becoming the new Robin, but Bruce told him that he had every confidence in him to be his new partner. He also confided in him that he was looking for someone with smarts, not just guts, and Tim had that and more. All that was necessary was that Tim go through intensive training before taking to the streets in Gotham. This would involve a tour overseas, helping Tim understand who he was in addition to learning how to be a great fighter.

They followed the trail to Hong Kong. While there, Shiva trained with Robin some more, and here he first acquired his collapsible fighting staff. King Snake's plan was actually to unleash his plague into Hong Kong so as to leave it a rotting cesspool before the Chinese reclaimed it from the British. The team split up when they breached his lair. Clyde found him first and was quickly killed by Snake. Robin managed to defeat him, but refused to kill him when Shiva ordered him to.

   Tim distinguished himself from Jason Todd by being far more reserved in temperament and from Dick Grayson by being more of a detective and less of a great acrobat. Whereas Dick had been brought up from a very early age to be acrobatic, Tim had to work hard for it. He proved himself more than capable of holding his own in a fight though. However, Batman did have strict orders with Tim—whenever he came across a known killer (such as Joker, Two-Face) he was supposed to withdraw and summon help.

   Unfortunately, Tim was not quite able to follow Batman's orders, and during one of his first solo-periods in Gotham without Batman, he found himself confronting Jason Todd's killer, the Joker. Having recently escaped from Arkham, Joker managed to use a hacker to cause the city to digitally self-destruct. Forced to handle the situation alone, Robin was made to confront the Joker who became infuriated at the sight of him, thinking that he had actually failed to kill the previous Robin. Upon realizing that this was a new Boy Wonder, Joker swore to kill this one, just as he had done Jason. Unfortunately for Joker, Tim proved more intelligent than Joker thought, and he was soon defeated and returned to Arkham, where he claimed that Robin was his, and his alone to kill.

   Thankfully, Bruce did not die, though when he awoke he was psychologically scarred, as his defeat from Bane on top of months of exhaustion was a major blow to him mentally (in addition to his broken back). Tim could barely stand to watch his mentor so shattered, but he stayed the course, helping Alfred recruit Dr.

Once Bruce was feeling in better spirits, Tim went to talk to him about the escalating violence and gang war in Gotham—someone would have to step in for Bruce until he could recover. Bruce turned down Tim's suggestion to get Nightwing, reasoning that he was his own man now with his own responsibilities, which left the task to Azrael, Jean Paul Valley. Tim gave him the costume and taught him a few of Batman's tricks.

   Bruce's condition was particularly heartbreaking for Tim, given that his own father was still paralyzed (although Jack had been making remarkable progress; while still wheelchair bound, he had much more feeling and could move his arms a lot better). Robin went out with the new Batman (sometimes referred to by fans as "Az-Bats") on patrol and was dismayed when Jean Paul kept getting more and more aggressive, pushing the edge when it came to defeating criminals. Robin kept trying to remind Jean Paul that there was more to being Batman than just the costume, but Jean Paul had quickly lost himself in his role. Meanwhile, Bruce surmised that since Bane had guessed his secret identity, he may have guessed Tim's, and went to the Drake's manor—too late, for Jack Drake was kidnapped just before he got there.

   Tim felt shut out of the team and the Cave by the time Nightwing dropped by. Tim filled him in on the situation, saying that he blamed himself partly for Jean Paul's behavior, as it had been he who had designed his original costume, which was very similar to a villain Bruce had recently defeated. That, combined with "the system", a kind of brainwashing Azrael had undergone, might have been the cause of his recklessness. Nightwing told him not to blame himself. He also admitted he was surprised Bruce hadn't asked him to fill in while he was injured. Robin showed up when Bane and Jean Paul had their second sparring and managed to save the passengers of an elevated train while Az-Bats took down Bane. Much to Tim's relief, Jean Paul did not kill Bane and for a moment considered that perhaps Jean Paul was a worthy successor.

He follows the clue to the gang's heist: an armored car robbery, but unfortunately, he and Cluemaster get sealed inside the car and the other two (not knowing they're in there) put the car in a pit and begin to cover it with cement.

After a firefight where Deathangel fled the scene, Robin and Huntress split up, with Robin following Mandy to a church. Huntress found Robin and Deathangel there, after correctly guessing that he was really Danny DePaolo, Mandy's brother, and he was a priest at that very church.

   Bruce kept his word—he and Alfred found Jack Drake and they returned to Gotham City. Bruce had even been mystically healed of his broken back during the trip. Once back, Bruce confessed to Tim that he was thinking of permanently staying retired. That all changed when he learned that Azrael had let Abattoir die. Bruce was a little angry at Robin for not doing more to stop Azrael, but Tim replied there wasn't much else he could do—Jean Paul had sealed off the cave and had almost killed them in their fight. Breaking into the lair, Bruce and Tim found Jean Paul, who was beyond reason. He did not even refer to himself by name anymore, but simply was the Batman in his mind. Bruce decided he would have to retake the mantle by force, but he would need a crash course to get up to peak again, and that meant going to Lady Shiva.

Afterwards, Bruce decided he needed some time off, and this time he handed the mantle over to the right person—Dick Grayson.

On a date with Ariana, some teens picked a fight, and unfortunately he had to take some hits. He vented his frustration later that night when he went out with Dick.

Robin saved her life, and after changing into her costume, she insisted on coming along. Batman was not amused, but Stephanie told him that Cluemaster had conned them and was in on the whole thing. While Batman went for another chat with Cluemaster, Robin and Spoiler stayed put until he tipped them in the right direction, where they rounded up the rest of the gang.

   Robin got to take his mind off things a little by helping Batman investigate a string of local robberies that were perpetrated by a gang of amateur ninjas—one of whom died when he fell off a rooftop. The deceased turned out to be a classmate of Tim's and he learned that the kid had gone to a Ninja Camp. Robin followed another classmate and easily took down some of the ninjas, though they managed to escape. Tim decided to go undercover and enrolled at the camp as his alias, Alvin Draper. He impressed the camp leaders enough that they let him in on their outfit, provided he could pass one last test. Robin passed it with flying colors—and the ninjas were arrested. Tim got home and learned that Ariana's uncle had sold his store and they would be moving at the end of the week.

   That night on patrol, Robin heard that Killer Moth had broken out. Figuring Moth for a third tier super lightweight, Robin went after him. Unfortunately, Moth had just sold his soul to Neron during "Underworld Unleashed" and been transformed into Charaxes. The monstrous being shredded its way through some cops and evaded a shootout with Sheriff Smith while capturing Robin—hoping to use him for dinner. Robin was saved by an unknown party before Batman could turn up and Killer Moth was gone.

One of Tim's classmates, Karl Ranck, had even been given a gun by his dad to protect himself, prompting Tim to tell his father. Jack had a talk with Karl's dad, who took the gun away. Karl then took one of his dad's and was killed in a shootout at the school. Tim was so angry that he attacked the gunrunners and may have even killed him, had Stephanie and Connor not been there. Tim spotted Stephanie at Karl's funeral and tried to avoid her, prompting Ariana to misread the situation. Then he and Spoiler went after the guy who shot Karl, who was part of a larger street gang. They had to be saved by Batman, who was not happy Robin decided to go at the gang without more backup than Spoiler. He also reminded Tim that Karl had made the choice to pick up the gun and become a target.

He got the shock of a lifetime while they were alone at her house and she walked out of her room in a sexy nightgown, wanting to sleep with him. Tim finally learned about the guy who had tried to rape her. Although it never got very far, but it left her feeling very scared and vulnerable. Tim told her that he loved her and said it would be best if they waited, since they were so young. Unfortunately, while Tim and Ariana were sharing a tender moment, her uncle and aunt walked in and saw them. Her uncle was not in the mood to listen for an explanation. Tim had to book it before Vari strangled him. He decided to go on patrol, where he ran into Spoiler and she explained about Lynx's Ghost Dragons. Robin agreed to work with her, but the Dragons proved too much for them to handle and they had to back off. Robin knew he should tell her to give up being Spoiler, but he just couldn't do it.

Despite being one of the dumbest goons in Gotham, the Baffler managed to tie up Robin and Spoiler and planned on leaving them to die in an old project building that was being demolished. He knocked himself out, however, and so they ended up having to save him as well as themselves. Afterward, Robin told Stephanie she might have to stop being Spoiler. When he got home (early the next day) he found his dad back from his recent lecture tour—and Jack had spoken to Ariana's uncle.

With Nightwing's help and a Waynetech jet, Robin went over to the war-torn country (the conflict was escalating with the appearance of more mercenaries on either side, such as Deadline (whom Robin managed to easily take down).

Robin had Nightwing drop him off in France, saying that lately he'd been feeling lost and decided he needed to step back for a while.

She wanted to be able to fight in the war that was destroying her native country of Transbelvia. After she left, Lady Shiva arrived looking for her. Robin had to withdraw, leaving the Iron Master to fight her alone, and she killed him. King Snake was also involved again, this time selling weapons to Transbelvia. Robin went after Dava to warn her about Shiva. Back in Gotham, Jack Drake, Ariana, and Spoiler were all wondering what had happened to Tim. Robin found Dava, a rebel fighting against the oppressive regime, and she has a secret—a special chemical called Aramilla that allows her to move at super-speed. Together, they easily took down some military thugs—but then Shiva turned up. Not willing to step aside and let her murder Dava, Robin attacked. Not even Shiva could stand up to Robin moving at super-speed. Losing control, Robin beat her to death—just in time for King Snake to saunter in. While Dava fought King Snake and his minions, Robin performed CPR and managed to revive Shiva—unfortunately, she had absorbed some of the Aramilla, and at super-speed she took down all of King Snake's men and went after him herself. Robin left them to fight each other and brought an injured Dava to safety. But the war continued, and Robin decided it was finally time to return home.

   Just before The War Games story arc, Tim's father, Jack Drake, discovered Tim's secret identity. Jack was enraged and threatened to expose the secret identities of all those involved with Batman. Tim offered Jack a deal, in which he would give up his role as Robin to respect his father's wishes; in exchange, Jack would keep their secret identities safe.

   After this, Stephanie Brown took over the role of Robin for a short period, until Batman fired her for disobeying orders. Soon afterward, a massive gang war (which Stephanie starts unintentionally) consumes Gotham City, and found its way into Tim's school. After assisting the Bat-Team to the best of his abilities, with no equipment or costume, Tim protected his classmates, but not without casualties. Tim then realized that he cannot disregard his responsibilities and took up the Robin mantle again, against his father's wishes. When Jack found out that Tim was Robin again, he grudgingly realized how truly important his son was to Gotham, despite the immense danger.

   One night, while Batman and Robin were investigating these crimes, they received an incoming transmission from Oracle saying that Tim's father needed to speak to him immediately. It turns out that there is an intruder in the Drake home and a mysterious note with a gun was left for Jack suggesting that he protect himself. Jack told Tim that he was proud of him, and that he is not responsible if something bad happened. The intruder turned out to be the hired killer Captain Boomerang. Jack fired as Captain Boomerang unleashed a razor boomerang and the two killed each other before Batman and Robin can make it back to the scene. Like Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, Tim Drake had now lost both of his parents to crime.

Quickly immobilizing the other Titans, Jason confronted Tim to see if the new Boy Wonder was really as good as everyone claims. The two Robins fight, until at last Jason struck Tim down in the Hall of Fallen Titans, where he also raged at how he was forgotten by everyone. Although Drake was defeated, Jason demands to know if he still believed himself to be as good as people say, to which Tim replied with a defiant "Yes" before Todd rendered him unconscious.

   As of the events surrounding the Infinite Crisis storyline, Robin, along with the Veteran's forces, defended the city of Blüdhaven against an army of OMACs who captured dozens of meta-humans for immediate extermination. After a virus deactivated the cyborgs (see also: The OMAC Project), Tim, the Shadowpact and the Veteran's team accomplished the capture of the meta-humans. With Blüdhaven safe, Wonder Girl arrived on the scene asking Robin for help. Along with the Teen Titans, the Doom Patrol and the Justice Society of America, he battled against Superboy-Prime, who had gone on a violent assault of their world's Superboy. The fight overwhelmed Conner's body to the point where it began eating away at itself for energy.

He then lead a successful assault into one of Lex Luthor's genetic research bases to find a cure for Superboy. With Blüdhaven still in chaos, Superman left Robin in command of all the superhero rescue efforts. However, when the government put the city on complete lock down, the Titans were kicked out.

Tim moved into the Wayne Estate, living in the Carriage House, which had been converted into a loft and Robin's new "nest".

Using his "R" shaped throwing stars, he supposedly killed his opponent, which he realized was Lynx (who already had died while battling Batgirl) dressed in a Batgirl costume. After doing an in-depth investigation, Tim discovered that the kidnapper is in truth Cassandra Cain, who had become the leader of a splinter cell of the League of Assassins. Cassandra orchestrated her "kidnapping" and the release of her father, David Cain, as a plan to convince Robin to join her. Robin refused, and after a lengthy battle, she escaped.

Soon after, he manages to assemble Cyborg, Wonder Girl, Raven, Miss Martian, and a resurrected Jericho into the team's ranks. Unfortunately, soon after the team got reassembled, they were attacked by Deathstroke the Terminator and his own squadron of Titans, he dubbed "The Titans East". During their battle with the group, Robin discovered that Batgirl was under the same mind control serum that Deathstroke used on Ravanger. Using a cure he developed, he freed Cassandra from Deathstroke's control. Unfortunately, still driven by a thirst for vengeance, Cassandra did not immediately return to the Gotham with him. She would later rejoin the Batman Family, and in fact be adopted by Batman shortly before his "death".

Soon after, the Titans were shocked to learn that their old friend and teammate Bart Allen had been murdered by the Flash Rogues.

He has also been considered the most skilled hero in all the DC Universe with his preferred weapon of choice though there is a another combatant who is truly the most skilled with their weapon of choice in all the DC Universe . Although he has not mastered near as many fighting styles as his mentors, he has managed to use the training given to be considered a highly skilled combatant.

    Gifted Intellect:
   </b>
   His naturally high intellect allows him to excel in computer science and more importantly as a skilled detective. Further more, Tim apparently has a firm grasp of assorted scientific techniques including biology, engineering and genetics, which he has been shown to use in his attempts at re-cloning Superboy. Batman states that Tim could potentially be smarter and better than himself. The Batman has trained him in many disciplines, such as forensic, criminology, acrobatics, stealth, disguise, and escapology.

    Master Detective:
   </b>
   His ability to deduce the secret identities of superheroes on his own has been used to underscore his skill. Among the identities used in this way are the Batman, both of his predecessors as Robin, the Huntress, Impulse, the Flash, and Captain Marvel.

    Master Tactician and Strategist:
   </b>
   Tim, much like Dick Grayson is also a brilliant and experienced strategist with impressive leadership skills, having served as leader to the Teen Titans, Young Justice, and even being placed in charge of the rescue efforts of Blüdhaven by Superman, following the attack made by Deathstroke and his fellow villains. In recent times, he has managed to orchestrate the unified control of the Gotham Street Gangs, thus reducing the threats they pose to the city.

    Robin Costume 1:
   </b>
   Drake's original costume was slightly different from that of his predecessors as supplied by Batman to give him a measure of increased protection. It includes an armored tunic, a cape that is black on the outside though still yellow on the inside, and green leggings. Other details include an armored gorget, jika-tabi style boots, an emergency "R" shuriken on his chest in addition to the traditional batarangs, a utility belt that is less bulky, and a collapsible bo staff as primary weapon. There is also a general change of the theme of the equipment from "Bat" to "Robin"

    Robin Costume 2:
   </b>
   Tim updated his costume to match Superboy's black and red color scheme as homage to his late friend. These updates include long sleeves, the elimination of the green from the suit, the addition of scallops to his gloves and cape, and inclusion of a utility belt with pockets. The scallops on the cape give an illusion of feathers rather than bat-wings, as seen on the cape of the Batman. The stylized "R" on Robin's chest has been replaced with a more traditional one, though its appearance varies from artist to artist. Robin retains his "R" shurikens, but he now carries them in his belt as opposed to his tunic. During a brief period where he suffered damaging burns, Tim temporarily wore the Red Robin hood and cape, which covered his head and offered him glider capabilities.

    Batman Costume:
   </b>
   With Batman supposedly dead and Dick Grayson refusing to become Batman, Tim temporarily assumes the mantle, by wearing Bruce's old blue and grey costume, with the yellow background emblem surrounding the Bat on his chest. He continues to carry his bo-staff.

    Red Robin Costume:
   </b>
   With Damian now assuming the role as the fifth Robin, Tim adopted the full uniform of Red Robin. This costume seems to contain a mixture of both Tim's old Robin uniforms, as well as Batman's. The uniform is comprised of black leggings and boots, a red tunic similar to that of Dick Grayson's old Robin tunic, though lacking the 'R' emblem. He wears a utility belt, again similar to the one worn by Dick Grayson while as Robin, only of a slightly larger size. He then has a chest harness, that is connected by the Red Robin symbol. Finally, he wears a black cowl and cape. Rather than using throwing stars or batarangs like before, Tim now uses Red Robin throwing disks. He does, however, continue to use his collapsible bo-staff as his primary weapon.

    Red Robin Costume 2:
   </b>
   With a few minor alterations by Alfred, Tim begins patrolling with a new version of the Red Robin costume. The hip-flaps are replaced with a more streamlined look and the heavy leather is replaced (or at least lessened). Tim returns to a utility belt more like his previous Robin costume (arguably more Batman in nature, as well, ditching the thin rod-canisters in favour of the metal, square "pouch"-style). It seems, if the cover of Red Robin 13 is anything to go off of, that Tim has developed a sort of Red Robin-branded batarang of his own to replace the throwing disks.

    Transportation
   </b>
   : Tim first vehicle was the Redbird car. It is capable of morphing between a highly armored combat vehicle and a normal looking car. With the disappearance of Batman, Robin has also begun using the Batmobile.
