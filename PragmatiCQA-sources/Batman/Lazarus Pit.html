   dug an experimental chemical pit where he discovered the restorative chemical pools that he dubbed a Lazarus Pit for its abilities to heal those at death's door. After using the pit to save the life of the prince, a side effect of the pit's restorative abilities revealed itself as the prince went mad and killed Ra's al Ghul's wife Sora. Blamed for his wife's murder, al Ghul was left to die, buried in the desert, but was soon rescued by his own tribe and a boy named Huwe. Afterward he used the tribe to gain vengeance for what happened to him and proceeded to call himself the "Head of the Demon".

Having returned to life in a crumbling body, Ra's seeks a permanent young one to take as host, which he decides to be his grandson Damian. After a fight with the Sensei, who declares himself to be Ra's father, Batman is stabbed via a cane in the chest and pulls the Sensei down into the pit with him. Sensei is killed for being an unsick user, but Batman is healed to full health and slightly de-aged.

   Notably, climbing out the Pit would symbolize one's rebirth, much like how a Lazarus Pit would re-invigorate one's health into being the prime of their life thus making them younger again.

    , a Lazarus Pit appeared in "Out of the Past". It was used to rejuvenate an elderly Bruce Wayne back to his prime. However, that all turned out to be a ruse by Ra's to transfer his mind (which was currently in
    Talia
    's body, where he transferred himself after his last battle with Batman left him too badly injured for even the Pit to heal) into the youthful Bruce's body. In

    s future, the process of using the Lazarus Pits became much safer and, although the pit's restorative powers made Bruce's body more youthful, because of his age in the series, he would have required multiple doses for the effects to be long-lasting. It was stated that it would take Bruce roughly a week to revert to his elderly state within a week.

   It should also be noted that the Pit was underneath the Monarch Theatre in the game. It was unknown if there were any other Pits in the world during the "Arkhamverse", although Batman mentioned that the particular pit featured within the game had been the one that Ra's had used for centuries, which indicated that this might have been the one and only pit within the Arkhamverse and, as a result of its destruction, cemented the deaths of Ra's, Talia, and the Joker once and for all.
