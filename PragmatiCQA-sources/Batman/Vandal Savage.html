Finding an enemy tribe in his home, Vandar tried to advise his chief, his father, on how to proceed. Ignored, Vandar's tribe began to lose the battle until distracted by a meteor whereupon Vandar killed the enemy chief. Making his way to the comet, Vandar killed his father and took the power of the meteor. Becoming Chief Savage, Vandar slaughtered his own tribe when they refused to join him.

Looking for places to wage war, Savage began to wander around, leading a slaughter at Dudesti where he saw Pandora, though made nothing of it. Heading to China, Savage desired to see the Han Dynasty. Becoming General Sha, the immortal found a friend in Zhang Heng.

   Along with Giganta, Vandal Savage was recruited by the Secret Society and assigned to work with Signalman. Savage's first task was to locate Pandora, however, in irony, it was Pandora who located Savage. After a quick fight, Savage attempted to open the box but as there was some pureness in Savage, it neutralized him.
