    Oswald Cobblepot

   and funded much of its criminal operations as one of its biggest black market manufactures. Directing his affairs from predominately the
   Iceberg Lounge
   , Oswald was seen as a reputable businessman to the people of Gotham, but was a sadistic, and mass murdering gang leader in reality.
  </p>
  <p key="1533cef4-2d0c-44a0-93e6-442ef88776d2">
   Initially operating out of a dilapidated ship, the Final Offer, as he recently began to accumulate his power within Gotham's criminal underworld, Cobblepot began to build up his own forces and carved up a piece of the black market for his own profits and purposes. Forming an alliance with

   , the most powerful and sadistic crime lord in the entire city, who put a $50 million bounty on
   Batman
   himself, the Penguin sought to crumble his competition, particularly the Falcone Crime Family, and aid in killing the Dark Knight in order to consolidate his own power over the city.
  </p>
  <p key="8cd7d814-1ad3-41e8-96ed-1848ddb497f8">
   Eventually captured by Batman and incarcerated within
   Blackgate Prison
   , Penguin bribed his way out of prison and established his new base of operations within the Cyrus Pinkney Museum, alongside the attached restaurant and bar, the Iceberg Lounge, and continued his criminal activities. Years later, after he refused to leave his base of operations when
   Arkham City
   was constructed around it, Oswald stayed within the prison compound, built up his forces, became one of the ruling elites on the streets, and was determined to keep anyone from taking over his turf and claim the rest of Arkham City for his own purposes.
  </p>
  <p key="5b857bcd-e9be-4a57-8456-470723e92f7d">
   After he was humiliated and defeated by Batman once again, Penguin joined in an alliance of other villains, that was orchestrated by
   Scarecrow
   and the
   Arkham Knight
   . Using his new front company, North Refrigeration, to smuggle weapons out of
   Bl√ºdhaven
   and into Gotham to be sold to the other villains, Penguin hoped to help destroy Batman on Halloween Night and conquer Gotham once and for all.

   Throughout the history of the Cobblepot Family, many of its members were in a constant rivalry with the Wayne Family for control of Gotham City. However, in the case of the Waynes, they simply conducted their businesses to make a living, improved Gotham's economic and moral standings through charitable ventures and improved architectural projects, and were not aware of the direct competition that the Cobblepots saw in them in their bid to dominate Gotham's business revenues and criminal underworld.
  </p>
  <p key="ccf691f8-cdc0-441a-9fcd-4105aa025ced">
   Regardless, the unhealthy fixation to outdo the Wayne Family and their business cost many of the Cobblepots their health and their business empires, including Oswald's father, Stanley Cobblepot, who began to neglect his son as a result and sent him overseas to England to spend his educational years. While overseas, however, Cobblepot was often bullied for his small stature and spent many days outside of school and on the violent streets instead, and associated with the various criminals and thugs.
  </p>
  <p key="2edbff78-9391-4f54-9135-41a70c15f987">
   After he felt appreciated and seen as somebody worth wild by the criminal element, Cobblepot began to learn and educate himself about the criminal lifestyle that so appealed to him and how to accumulate massive amounts of wealth and numbers. In the meantime, Cobblepot's father died after he nearly bankrupted his own businesses while he tried to outdo the Wayne Family, the final straw for Oswald, who saw the Wayne Family as nothing more than spoiled individuals who had ruined his family. As a result of his stay in England, Oswald also adopted an East London accent.
  </p>
  <p key="e6eaf8da-ce8a-4153-8b0c-1b0d44d2a4e1">
   After he arrived back in Gotham, Cobblepot soon became known to the criminal underworld as The Penguin. From then on, Cobblepot used his inheritance money to purchase¬†a large ship within Gotham's harbor in Old Gotham, the Final Offer, which he used as his headquarters. From within the bowels of the ship, Penguin marketed and sold the latest firearms and military-grade equipment, which he smuggled into Gotham through illegal means and was even tested them out in the ship's shooting range, to be sold to the criminal element in Gotham. Eventually building up a massive gang of his own, Penguin led his men into performing daring heists on other companies that specialized in advanced and military grade weaponry manufacturing and sold his ill-gotten gains to other criminals and gangs, while he kept a good portion of the equipment for his plans. Presumably, he also established a significant amount of bases of operation within Gotham during this time.
  </p>
  <p key="c0499d55-f28a-4f03-9086-357c655246a0">
   This lead to a massive increase in gun activity and violence in Gotham, as criminals made daring robberies to obtain the money that was needed to purchase the firearms. Pocketing all his profits, as well as keeping some of the smuggled weaponry as his own, Cobblepot additionally performed jobs of his own on lucrative establishments for their profits and became a rising star in the criminal underworld.
  </p>
  <p key="db73f2c8-19b7-443b-895e-0725f9e9f9e0">
   Penguin also built a large casino that was filled with booze and drugs within his massive ship, which attracted all manner of thugs, criminals, and greedy individuals to engage in illegal gambling on a nightly basis. However, unknown to all except for Cobblepot's crew, the machines within the casino were purposely rigged to cheat gamblers out of their money, while the clerks were paid to cheat and swindle others out of their winnings. If anyone on the other side of the spectrum was caught cheating though, Penguin brutally tortured and murdered them, and displayed their corpses within the ship's theater as a reminder to all with what would happen if they crossed him.¬†Penguin even went as far as to build a gladiator pit within the center of the ship's boiler deck, where brutal fights to the death occurred, and was appropriately named as The 'Boiler Deck' Fights, in which all viewers and participants could bet on the winners.
  </p>
  <p key="2b8ff446-4d32-4124-a678-f77a33458c5f">
   Penguin stored all his money, plans, and blueprints for his future headquarters, the Iceberg Lounge, in his office. Overseeing the criminal mastermind's operations with him were
   Candy
   and
   Tracey
   , two beautiful women who worked for Cobblepot, in Candy's case to support herself in light of the worsening economy in Gotham.¬†With his massive profits, Penguin had no trouble in hiring his own bent cops from within the
   <a href="Gotham City Police Department.html" key="c33847fe-fcf2-44fe-983c-44f9bdc83b78" title="Gotham City Police Department">
    GCPD
   </a>
   and even corrupt guards at Blackgate, all of whom aided his plans by stealing weapons from their respective facilities, sold them to him, gave him inside information on the occurrences in Gotham, and turned a blind eye on his black market dealings. With various informants throughout Gotham's other gangs and criminal elements, Copplebot had tabs all over Gotham and inside information on all its criminal operations and activities.
  </p>
  <p key="8affdc9f-0e88-48bf-94d8-7503f5c607aa">
   All of Penguin's operations made him a growing star in the criminal element of Gotham, but he was still not satisfied and lusted to wipe out his competition and become one of the leading crime bosses throughout the city. With his immense wealth, Cobblepot began to purchase most of the real estate throughout Old Gotham, including the¬†Cyrus Pinkney Museum,¬†which put him in complete control of the area and gained the attention of Black Mask, the city's most powerful crime lord.
  </p>
  <p key="74b1504c-cbfe-4ceb-8011-ece555e64b66">
   The two villains soon began a brutal and bloody turf war over complete control of Gotham's criminal underworld until a truce was made; Black Mask would run his operations throughout New Gotham while Penguin would continue to control Old Gotham without the worry of other fractions interfering with his own operations. Both crime lords knew, however, that the truce would simply be a diversion to allow them time to plan counter attacks and, eventually, the war would continue to wipe each other out and conquer the entire criminal underworld; Cobblepot was intent to make sure that he was the victor.

   On a particularly snowy Christmas Eve in Gotham, Black Mask placed a bounty of $50 million on Batman's head and enlisted eight of the world's most deadly assassins to take him down. Penguin, having previously formed a truce with Black Mask, decided that the time was right to make his own moves and commenced an open war on Black Mask once he learned that Roman Sionis and Black Mask were one and the same based off the fact that Roman had a collection of various masks.
  </p>
  <p key="bf29c0c9-704f-4867-9b13-2d7bacc669d1">
   After he used his latest shipment of military spying equipment, droids, Penguin kept surveillance over the crime lord. Eventually, Penguin attempted to murder Black Mask with a handful of his crew within his safe house at Lacey Towers, only to find Black Mask's girlfriend,
   Tiffany Ambrose
   , dead and hanging from a chandler, and a
   Decoy Black Mask
   dead as well. Disturbed by the gruesome fashion in which the murders were committed and annoyed after he learned that it wasn't actually the real Black Mask (due to the fact that there was no pacemaker among the carnage as Roman Sionis had one implanted in his heart), Penguin left the room and building after he unknowingly left his fingerprints at the crime scene. Due to this, Penguin was initially believed to be the killer by the GCPD, but, thanks to a few bribes, he was never convicted.
  </p>
  <p key="7893f130-8335-4b15-957c-f3db6cb280c2">
   Unknown to Penguin at the time, Tiffany and Black Mask's decoy were murdered by the

    Joker
   </a>
   , a new criminal mastermind and mass murdering psychopath, who desired pure chaos and anarchy and who had impersonated Black Mask to take control of his criminal empire, hired the assassins, and had taken the real Roman Sionis hostage.¬†After he used one of his many inside agents within the GCPD, Penguin learned of the assassins and which ones would be of particular interest with regards to selling firearms, and also arranged for an alternate method of getting communications through after Captain
   James Gordon
   's running of the GCPD that prevented them from using the normal channels due to his by-the-book nature.
  </p>
  <p key="1ee42a2d-931c-4099-92a5-4e1c4e563507">
   Penguin saw that as a great opportunity to capitalize on his own criminal lifestyle and formed an alliance with some of Black Mask's assassins, particularly
   Deathstroke
   , also known as Slade Wilson,
   Deadshot
   aka Floyd Lawton,
   Bane
   , and the
   Electrocutioner
   aka Lester Butchinsky, the last of whom who was more concerned with the annual fighting matches that Penguin hosted rather than firearms.
  </p>
  <p key="139c0988-fa5a-4237-a495-43ffadb09e0d">
   Penguin provided Bane and his army of mercenaries with immense firepower and military-grade equipment to use in their own plans while Deathstroke arrived on the Final Offer and collected his ammunition and Electrocutioner arrived to fight in the 'Boiler Deck' Fights for money and glory. Batman eventually made his way to the ship after he foiled one of Penguin's firearms deals in Old Gotham (which was largely Penguin's fault, as he sent a text to the
   gang member who was in charge of the deal
   and inquired about its status around the time Batman that had interrogated him), fought his way past scores of Penguin's Henchmen, soundly defeated Electrocutioner in the process with a kick to the face, and ripped through all his operations.
  </p>
  <p key="34cdc21e-0ff6-493d-be20-a83c15e9936a">
   In the meantime, Penguin had managed to capture
   Alberto Falcone
   , son of
   <a href="Carmine Falcone.html" key="b33ca89b-4177-45dc-816c-a7198a7b3039" title="Carmine Falcone">
    Carmine Falcone
   </a>
   and one of Penguin and Black Mask's remaining competitors, and had him brought to the Final Offer to be tortured. After he brutalized Alberto, Cobblepot enticed him to convince his father to give up their criminal activities or he would wipe them all out himself. As Penguin was about to further torture Alberto, Batman himself arrived, took out Penguin's Henchmen, and interrogated him for information on Black Mask.
  </p>
  <p key="28575877-c0ad-4f03-a39c-f17c907a6875">
   Penguin informed the vigilante that there was a murder at the Lacey Towers in South Gotham that was somehow connected to Black Mask and his criminal empire. Before he could pry Cobblepot for additional information, Batman was pulled out of Cobblepot's Office by Deathstroke's Remote Claw, was suspended upside down, and was about to be cut into pieces by Deathstroke. Batman, however, punched Deathstroke, took his sword, used it to free himself, and glided down to the gladiator pit below. With Slade following, Batman and the assassin prepared themselves for a brutal brawl as the Penguin gleefully watched from above.
  </p>
  <p key="6e5ac87f-f143-46bc-bd53-d1030145a7da">
   However, Batman proved to be much more than even Deathstroke could possibly imagine, defeated him, and Penguin locked himself in his office with Tracey and Candy, and also taunted Batman when he attempted to enter and question him further. However, Batman had
   Alfred
   call the GCPD and let them know where Penguin had stored his illegally obtained weapons as well as the location of Deathstroke. That forced Penguin to flee his ship as Batman foiled the rest of his plans, including disarming all of his arms caches that were hidden throughout Gotham by his inside agents at the GCPD. Despite that, Penguin's forcing the Falcones to give up on the weapons business increased his popularity in the underworld, and caused at least one criminal, under the employ of
   Firefly
   , to consider joining his group.

   With the criminal underworld in disarray with the emergence of the Joker and the subsequent reveal of the massive amount of conspiracy and corruption within Gotham's infrastructure to the general public, Penguin realized that he needed a game changer to remain within his power base against the more outlandish villains who suddenly emerged and the more sufficient police force. With his other competitors, namely Black Mask and the Falcons, crippled in power due to Joker's actions, Penguin planned to capitalize on his remaining influence to become a leading power within the criminal underworld. To this end, on New Years Eve, Penguin set up a meeting with a mysterious armored man who requested his assistance, known only as
   Mr. Freeze
   , a former scientist who could not survive outside sub-zero temperatures due to a lab accident and was thirsty for revenge. Freeze offered Penguin cryogenic weaponry that was manufactured at his previous employer,
   GothCorp
   , and in exchange, they allied with him to capture GothCorp's CEO
   Ferris Boyle
   .
  </p>
  <p key="471ee1c5-a1bd-499c-82e7-d13e869971dc">
   With Freeze supplying Penguin and his gang various cryogenic weapons, Penguin planned to use his upgraded artillery to unleash another crime wave on Gotham and perform daring heists, while also selling some of their new weapons to the Black Market.¬†Penguin and his henchmen used the weapons to freeze over entire sections of South Gotham, along with many GCPD officers, which prevented the police from stopping the crime wave and took control of 'My Alibi', that was formally shut down after Joker's capture. Penguin converted the club into a secondary base of operations, where he stored some of his newly acquired cryogenic weapons that were to be sold to interested parties out on the streets.
  </p>
  <p key="93faa904-988b-4727-9600-fd8da4b8846d">
   Freeze and Penguin's gang eventually tracked Boyle's location at
   Wayne Manor
   , as he was presented with the Humanitarian of the Year Award by Bruce Wayne's foundation. That presented Penguin with yet another unique opportunity as the crime lord harbored a deep-rooted hatred of the Waynes, and blamed them for ruining his family's legacy. Penguin instructed his men to aid Freeze in abducting Boyle, to additionally take anything of value, torch the mansion, and kill Bruce Wayne to obtain his revenge over the Wayne legacy.
  </p>
  <p key="d7e07150-136b-4ed8-b67e-470e3db3efba">
   However, with the gang not knowing that Bruce Wayne and Batman were one and the same, Bruce was able to fight off his attackers, rescued Alfred and his guests, and prevented his mansion from being engulfed in the fires, despite Penguin's men successfully abducting Boyle. Meanwhile, some of Penguin's men also used their cryo weapons to conduct a burglary at one of Gotham's banks, although that operation was foiled by Batman, who had, at that time, been following a trail of cryogenic chemicals from one of the Penguin's arms dealers to find the dealer and get Freeze and Boyle's destination.
  </p>
  <p key="34aa71bf-3ef0-4072-b9f5-fea28b84bf9b">
   Upon his men successfully retrieving Boyle, Penguin and Freeze then attacked and seized complete control over GothCorp, froze entire sections of the building, and held the staff hostage. After he used the security codes that were given to him by Freeze, Penguin had Boyle brought to the Propellant Research Wing and also told his men to keep a lookout for anyone who tried to rescue the CEO. Penguin eventually turned on Freeze when he learned that the villain had wanted Boyle for the security codes that would grant him access to what Penguin assumed to be a massive weapon and planned to procure it for himself.
  </p>
  <p key="33de7b6a-9083-45fc-b3cb-d07b149caa09">
   The reality of the situation however, was that Boyle had been holding Freeze's wife,
   Nora Fries
   , at his corporation for his own personal gain after he stole her from the former scientist once Boyle learned that Fries had been continuing to use company resources without his knowledge in an attempt to cure Nora and neglected his orders to advance GothCorp's secret cryogenic weapons manufacturing project.
  </p>
  <p key="0ea0653c-c770-408a-9676-d444697f29cc">
   Penguin then attacked Batman after he revealed himself, but ended up frozen by Freeze, and eventually ended up trapped in a thick wall of ice by him after he overloaded some cryogenic equipment. Penguin then told Batman about the existence of a cryodrill that Freeze had supplied them, and cited its location at "My Alibi".¬†However, Penguin had ordered for the cryodrill to be separated into pieces that were to be sold to external parties, and its fuel was still in the weapons lab where Freeze, then known as Dr. Victor Fries, experienced his accident.
  </p>
  <p key="97baae38-31da-4f4e-a5d7-1e5ce9041c6e">
   Despite that, Batman managed to retrieve the parts from Penguin's Henchmen, discovered Freeze's tragic origins and Boyle's crimes, and completed the cryodrill to make a path to the center of GothCorp in order to apprehend Freeze and Boyle and ensure Nora's safety. As Penguin's gang attempted to thaw their boss out of the ice, the frozen crime lord threatened them to hurry up and get him out and even implied that he'd drown his men in a hot bath that was made by Candy as soon as he got out. Batman, after he defeated Penguin's men, decided to leave him trapped in the wall.
  </p>
  <p key="14fc9db3-4800-41b8-95c0-dcefe77c18f9">
   While trapped, Penguin reflected on the Joker's hiring of eight assassins, how Batman had managed to live despite that, and viewed the Caped Crusader as being "like a bad joke." Penguin was eventually and finally arrested, alongside Freeze and Boyle (with the latter's crimes exposed), presumably freed from his icy tomb in the process, and was taken to Blackgate Prison.

  <p key="ba74cc25-f641-4733-9055-e1effa8d0d99">
   It was implied that Penguin deliberately allowed himself to remain locked up at Blackgate, even if he could bribe his way out, as he initially thought that the prospect of running his criminal empire from within the prison might be an ideal method to recruit other criminals and keep himself safe from Batman as he was already locked up and in relative comfort thanks to at least twelve guards that were on his payroll. Using gardening equipment, Penguin also dug several tunnels beneath the prison and monitored all guard movements so that he could effectively run Blackgate when an opportunity presented itself and even escape if he wanted. However, three and a half months later, a massive explosion within the prison commenced a riot that allowed Black Mask, the Joker, and Penguin to seize complete control of the facility, carve up a portion of it for themselves, and advance their own, individual agendas.
  </p>
  <p key="e3c28096-a705-43e2-bd2b-053bbceb54c4">
   After he believed that the carnage was much more complex than just a simple prison riot and takeover, Batman arrived at Blackgate to investigate the situation further and allowed Penguin and his fellow criminals a chance of ultimate revenge against their hated enemy. After he destroyed all of the cameras throughout the Cell Block and used fragments of a broken bathroom mirror to reflect sensor lasers, and a blowtorch and spade to destroy the security boxes, Penguin broke into several weapon caches and claimed the weaponry for himself and his gang. The crime lord even went as far as to create makeshift electrical fences throughout the Cell Block to incapacitate first responding guards and used them as human shields for successive officers.
  </p>
  <p key="8101e491-ed87-4086-865a-1430c17181f9">
   Penguin additionally used the riots as an opportunity to recruit the prisoners for members of his gang and also used the opportunity to stage fights between various prisoners. After he took the Prison Yard guard hostage, Penguin had his men string the man's neck in a noose and hang him, only to be rescued at the last second by Ben Turner, aka,
   <a href="Bronze Tiger.html" key="0f4af0df-8924-4464-ae94-e261061a878e" title="Bronze Tiger">
    Bronze Tiger
   </a>
   . Wanting to teach the man a lesson, Penguin gave Tiger the title of "Champion" and forced him into fighting various guards and prisoners to the death, until he decided to join his army. When Batman interfered with Tiger's attempt at finishing off a guard, Penguin was pleased at this development as he was fresh out of guards for his "champion" to fight before ordering the two to fight to the death. After Batman refused to kill Bronze Tiger upon defeating him, Penguin demanded that the prisoners beat up Batman, but Tiger grazed Penguin with bullets, and forced him to escape, although not before Penguin ordered several of his men to kill both Tiger and Batman as revenge.
  </p>
  <p key="3d83453b-59fc-4d1a-a65d-75e361a1238a">
   During that time, Penguin also tried to steal the weapons inside Blackgate and smuggle them. Penguin's plans were once again thwarted by Batman in the Cell Blocks (as Batman successfully tracked Penguin down thanks in large part to his earlier graze wound leaving drops giving away his intended location), and he was left to hang. However, Penguin had previously struck a deal with
   Catwoman
   to rig the prison with explosives and hold hostages as insurance to his escape, which forced Batman to diffuse them or else it would completely destroy Blackgate (that development varied between which of the three main bosses that Batman defeated last). Catwoman did not care either way, as she only wanted to smuggle Bane out of Blackgate. While Cobblepot was again apprehended, he was able to escape thanks to a Blackgate guard, who was on his payroll, and who then was almost immediately murdered by Penguin after he was freed of his restraints and gave him back his umbrella from the police lockup as revenge for the guard treating him in a more rude manner, although not before he learned that there were 120 criminals under Penguin's employ outside the prison.
  </p>
  <p key="519e5d98-8b77-4151-ab32-06d371573d95">
   Not long after that event, Penguin took up residence within the Cyrus Pinkney Museum in the Bowery of Old Gotham, after he purchased it several months prior, converted it into his new base of operations, and constructed the Iceberg themed restaurant on the other side of the structure.

   Cobblepot eventually used his ill-conceived fortune and purchased large sections of Old Gotham, including The Cyrus Pinkney Institute of Natural History, which was in the process of being shut down due to its position in a dilapidating part of Gotham City. Oswald saw the museum as the perfect base of operations and converted both the museum and the attached restaurant, the Iceberg Lounge, into his main headquarters. After he reestablished the Iceberg Lounge into one of the finest restaurants in Gotham, Cobblepot gained the attention of the wealthy and criminal citizens of Gotham with a den of booze, drugs, gambling, and beautiful women.
  </p>
  <p key="ce6c6d45-1606-4675-a703-6d29a6e46097">
   On the opening night for the Iceberg Lounge, Oswald felt proud to have finally gained respect. He invited the Joker and
   Harley Quinn
   and offered them a free drink. When a waitress arrived, she tripped and accidentally spilled the drink on the Joker. Joker then sprayed acid on her face with his flower. Joker and Harley then trashed the club and fled. Enraged at Joker for ruining his party, killing his waitress, and tarnishing his reputation, Penguin developed a deep hatred of him.

  <p key="174f77cc-27d5-45c4-8195-59954266fa9d">
   On the outside, Oswald was a legitimate business tycoon, but truly made a living off of the Black Market in Gotham, and had shipments of drugs and firearms arrive each week, which he then sold to Gotham's criminals, while also he also performed his own scores and heists with his gang. Penguin gained a reputation for sadistic torture and mass murder, particularly on those that he caught cheating in his casino. Within the museum, Penguin created a gladiator pit where he selected various criminals from Gotham's streets to partake in illegal fights to the death. The winners became part of Penguin's growing gang while those that died were put on display in various cases or fed to his shark,
   Tiny
   , who was originally part of the museum's underwater attractions.
  </p>
  <p key="7540a1f7-78e3-4130-8652-47d6cd9abd06">
   Penguin also added a torture chamber to punish those who stood against him or were caught cheating in his gambling activities and additionally added a war room to plan his criminal operations, and an armory to store his own personal shipments of weapons for his gang's use or to be sold to the Black Market. Gambling ran rampant through the Iceberg Lounge and those who couldn't pay were either put into a private torture room or were killed.

  <p key="28ce69ed-f40a-4195-b166-f6925572125d">
   When one such client who couldn't pay, a barroom brawl broke out, which resulted in a broken beer bottle that was lodged into Penguin's left eye, a favor which Cobblepot repaid by taking both of the client's eyes, as well as left him wandering blindly through the Gotham freeway at rush hour. After Penguin saw the finest doctors, it was determined that the removal of the bottle would result in his death.
  </p>
  <p key="28d72062-b89c-45c3-955b-5109b905dd39">
   Penguin became content with it, and believed that it made him look "unique." In addition, due to his hatred of the Waynes, Penguin never stopped laughing about their deaths at the hands of a mugger as well as Bruce Wayne's status as an orphan as a result upon learning about their deaths, and even went as far as stated that it "couldn't have happened to nicer people."

  <p key="97ab2f02-496c-4fa9-8006-5049e862a2ae">
   At some point, Penguin also was incarcerated into Arkham Asylum, where he ended up maltreated by the other inmates largely thanks to his short stature, and also ended up probed by the chief psychologist at the Asylum, Dr. Penelope Young, regarding the origins of his deep-seated inferiority complex, only for him to rebuke her and over-compensate by citing his business acumen and his misunderstood intelligence, as well as spending his time tinkering with his various umbrellas to create trick contraptions. It was presumably during this time that he managed to glean enough intel on the inner-workings of the asylum to know the means to not only break out of the asylum, but even to infiltrate it if necessary, which he would later put to use under Amanda Waller's discretion.

   At some point prior to the events of the film, Penguin's feud with the Joker and Harley, initially sparked when Joker murdered one of his waitresses at the Iceberg Lounge, and intensified when the murderous couple lit fire to a delivery truck that contained cigarettes and contraband that was meant to be sold onto the streets and dumped it into the Gotham River. As that act was committed by the Joker simply for a laugh at the cost of the crime boss, along with a considerable amount of expenses, Penguin's hatred of the Joker and Harley was renewed. Penguin also held a lot of respect for Deadshot for his reputation of being among the best assassins out in the criminal underworld, and who worked him several years prior by supplying him with various artillery and weaponry for an assassination that he was hired to embark on in Gotham on Christmas Eve.

   When Arkham City was developed, Penguin ended up trapped within the city because of his refusal to abandon the Iceberg Lounge, as he didn't wish to let his base get caught at the hands of some of the thugs. After he ordered his men to open fire on the GCPD that was sent to evacuate the museum, Penguin's Henchmen murdered three officers and finally revealed his criminal status to the people of Gotham. Officially branded as a criminal once again, Professor
   Hugo Strange
   had the perimeter wall that encompassed Arkham City still undergo construction as scheduled, and left Penguin as another inmate.
  </p>
  <p key="d2e0e85c-1e0e-43b4-bed8-645c352dc764">
   Situated within the newly christened Arkham City, Penguin quickly adapted to his new environment and saw fresh opportunities to conquer the criminal underworld and eliminate his competitors. After Joker escaped from Arkham Asylum and arrived in Arkham City, Cobblepot briefly met with the Clown Prince of Crime, who attempted to make peace with him, to which he reminded him that he hadn't forgiven him for ruining the Iceberg's Lounge's opening, and thus began the war between the two anew during the events of the game.
  </p>
  <p key="0119c8a1-5b40-405a-88d6-f09c4052b787">
   In order to survive Arkham City's violent environment, Penguin started his own gang and hoped to seize complete control over the rest of the prison for his own ends. Penguin ended up meeting Lester Kurtz, who wished to join his gang after he fled from Jokers. Unlike Joker, Penguin didn't put Kurtz through any initiation and just told him to follow orders and he'd be paid. Penguin then turned to another thug named Grisby and revealed a picture that showed him double-crossing him by giving information to Harley Quinn. Penguin then sent a panicked Grisby to "tell the man downstairs" and sent him down a trapdoor.
  </p>
  <p key="7e53ad4a-edf3-4099-ba12-89e6170383ac">
   Kurtz asked him what's down there and Penguin simply replied: "Pray you never have to find out." Since Grisby told the Joker about the raid on the Security Armory that was planned by Penguin, Penguin told his men that they would have to get the weapons before they got to the armory. Due to the unexpected appearance of the Joker's Henchmen, Kurtz had to destroy the guns, which infuriated Penguin, but Kurtz was able to talk his way out of being sent "downstairs" and instead got his pay cut in half and Penguin made him lead a strike on the weakened Joker's hideout the next day.
  </p>
  <p key="1a9a8633-08af-40b3-bf55-5dcbe4ec4a56">
   To be sure that he didn't escape, Penguin told his men to lock Kurtz up for the night, but Kurtz escaped anyway by knocking out the goons, a little later. Penguin never realized that Kurtz was a new alias of his mortal enemy, Batman. Presumably because of Kurtz' earlier actions, Penguin instigated an initiation process where he handpicked any "horrible psychopaths" who wished to join him to prove themselves to be the best, and the exact initiation process was different each day.

  <p key="ea01f91e-daf3-481d-be31-289602a9599c">
   Eventually, Penguin was taken to Strange by
   TYGER
   to begin taped interview sessions, as much as the rest of the super-criminals had to do as well. There, Strange began to diagnose Penguin, much to the villain's annoyance and even struck an alliance with the gang lord as part of his own plans for power. At the Penguin's request, Strange purchased and delivered a wide variety of military-grade weaponry, ammunition, and technology to his base of operations, and told him that Arkham City was merely an experiment to observe the actions of the criminal populace that it housed when Penguin questioned Strange's motives for the alliance.

   With Penguin's new and incredible artillery in conjunction with all of the resources that he had at his disposal at the museum, Penguin took the compound by storm, killed all who opposed him and recruited hundreds of individuals to build up a massive gang. Throughout the months, Penguin's Henchmen went on recruitment missions and assembled large groups of potential gang members and other inmates who were locked up in the gladiator pit within the museum to eventually undergo duels to the death to determine who was worthy of joining Penguin's gang.

  <p key="2fa174a1-fca0-4687-9e81-2cf0d58531cb">
   Penguin remained in contact with Strange, who continued to supply him with weapons and even handed over victims of his inhumane experiments that were used as target practice. Strange eventually informed Penguin that his rival, the Joker, was indeed sick and dying, but had blackmailed Freeze into developing a potential cure for the

   Penguin agreed, had several of his men take Freeze away to be locked up in one his display cases at the museum, and cruelly chose the one that ventilated with extreme heat. As one last string to pull, Strange revealed to Cobblepot that ten inmates that worked within his gang were actually inside agents for the GCPD for Commissioner Gordon, and trusted him to dispose of them. Penguin wasted no time when he returned to the museum and had all ten of the undercover cops abducted, beaten, and locked away in his torture chamber for eventual death.

   When Bruce Wayne was imprisoned in Arkham City for leading a protest against it, Penguin and his gang were among the first of the criminals who greeted him. Desiring revenge against Wayne for his family being ruined, Penguin took out some brass knuckles to beat him up.

Penguin then had his gang kill Wayne, but he defeated them with ease and also broke his handcuffs in the process.

   Later the during the night, Penguin had his men rig the bridges and streets that lead to Joker's base of operations, the Steel Mill, with explosives to cut off the Clown Prince of Crime's forces. When all of the explosives were put in place, Penguin detonated them, and killed many of Joker's Henchmen and his own men in the process and stranded any who were left on the other side. Eventually, Batman, who tried to locate Freeze so that he could get the cure for the Titan Disease that he, and the thousands of Gotham citizens who were infected with by Joker, managed to encounter Penguin, who mercilessly executed one of the cops,
   GCPD Officer Best
   . Penguin then asked Batman whether he was there to rescue the cops, Freeze, or to take him down. Batman, with barely concealed rage towards Penguin's murder of Best, told him that he had initially arrived to rescue the hostages as well as Freeze, but that Penguin's current action meant that he fully intended to take him down as well, with him ominously vowing that he was "about to find out" when the latter sarcastically stated that he was scary with his response. After a failed attempt at getting Batman to surrender and become a part of his collection, Penguin then had some of the inmates attempt to kill him as their initiation.
  </p>
  <p key="226bcc1e-f9f6-466d-af1d-684ba3ce98cc">
   Batman defeated all of them with ease and enticed Penguin to unveil his big guns: more specifically, a henchman that he injected with some of the Titan Formula that he had acquired from shipments that the Joker had previously sent off from Arkham Island. After Batman managed to defeat the Titan Henchman, Penguin escaped from the chaos and went back to the Iceberg Lounge. One of the cops that Penguin had held hostage, GCPD Officer Forrester, also managed to escape him but wasn't able to get to the exit before Penguin froze him with Freeze's
   Freeze Gun
   . Penguin then revealed that he had a shark in the frozen pool of water known as Tiny, which he regularly used to dispose of bodies and who even devoured living victims.
  </p>
  <p key="665e1426-d871-4a00-a679-950f630ee686">
   Penguin ordered the rest of his gang to guard the other cops in the armory, with the threat of killing them should they fail to do so. Eventually, Batman, after he saved most of the cops, defeated legions of Penguin's gang, and even Tiny, proceeded to the Iceberg Lounge. Once there, Penguin taunted Batman with the intention of torturing another undercover cop by the name of
   GCPD Officer Denning
   by freezing one of his hands as well as declaring his intention of shattering the frozen hand with a hammer.
  </p>
  <p key="02fa936f-d12d-432b-8570-1c0d382abc84">
   Batman managed to arrive in time, but Penguin forced him to retreat due to his use of Freeze's Freeze Gun. Batman eventually returned and, thanks to the override code for the Freeze Gun from Freeze, the gun failed to fire on Batman, and resulted in him uppercutting Penguin off the iceberg monument. Penguin tried to talk his way out of his predicament, but when Batman implied that he wasn't simply going to let him go after all of the destruction and death that he caused, Penguin destroyed the iceberg monument with a remote-controlled detonator, and dropped Batman to a room below the lounge, with Penguin declaring that Batman had brought it upon himself.

   Penguin then activated an entity that he had discovered under the Iceberg Lounge presumably before Arkham City was even established, Solomon Grundy, and forced Batman to fight him. After Batman managed to completely destroy the mechanism that continuously revived Grundy and put him down for good, Penguin was eventually forced to fight Batman himself with a grenade launcher but was easily defeated. Batman then delivers Penguin to Freeze, who stepped on Penguin's already broken hand as revenge for the latter's earlier treatment of him. Batman ordered Freeze to stop hurting Penguin and focus on the cure and enticed him to place Penguin within one of his own display cases, the one that he had reserved for Bruce Wayne, although not before he made a subtle threat to him.

   Catwoman could speak to Penguin inside the display case. She asked him what he's supposed to be in the exhibit. Penguin rudely told her to "piss off". Offended, Catwoman warned him against talking like that to her again before she left and Penguin immediately apologized out of cowardice.

   After he was released from Arkham City, Penguin and his gang spent time recovering from their time in there, including doing gunrunning to and from Bl√ºdhaven via a front company known as North Refrigeration, which he managed to form after he retrieved a deed to the company from his family's old manor on Founders' Island. The actions of North Refrigeration and Penguin in Bludhaven and Gotham eventually got
   Nightwing
   involved. Eventually, Penguin met up with the recently escaped Harley Quinn. Despite their animosity in the past (mostly due to Joker), they nonetheless managed to form a partnership, and Penguin was kissed by Harley to seal the deal. Months later, Penguin went to a meeting that was arranged by Scarecrow, alongside Harley, and Two-Face.

After Scarecrow alongside the mysterious mercenary known only as the Arkham Knight arrived and explained why they were there, Penguin then confirmed they knew that they were afraid of Batman, and told him to tell them something that they didn't know.

   Some time later, although they agreed to the truce, Penguin nonetheless continued to bicker with Two-Face, largely because of the latter's smart remark about Penguin's height after he commented that when he made a deal, he preferred to "look them straight in the eye," as well as vocally voiced his distrust of the Arkham Knight. Penguin also mentioned that, from his cut aside, he wouldn't have anything to do with Two-Face's bank heists, before Two-Face reminded him that he needed to keep them armed and their guns loaded via their gun smuggling operation, at least until the truce ended with Batman's death. At some point later, Penguin had a group of his men go over to the docks for what was presumably a business deal.
  </p>
  <p key="e16c450d-3c4b-4d6a-b4da-c40131adf577">
   However, only one of his men returned and had a broken arm. Penguin then interrogated him and threatened to "give him a matching pair" if he didn't have a good reason for why their operation failed. He then explained that his forces ended up ambushed and taken out by unanticipated methods, and caused Penguin to deduce that the person who ambushed them was none other than the Arkham Knight. Penguin then broke the man's arm anyway, in response to the saying "don't shoot the messenger."

  <p key="2f94bf48-ce14-4773-8b08-f5dadf8881e2">
   Sometime later, Penguin gave radio support to Harley when she raided the Bl√ºdhaven Police Station to retrieve

  <p key="ebf1f0b8-a97e-4dc1-9445-e5a7038e7a87">
   Penguin gave a speech that told his men that they're "bloody rich" with the proceeds from their weapons racket during the night, as well as implied that once Batman was dead, he would take out Two-Face and the others to be the top kingpin. However, Batman lurked in one of the floor grates below, jumped out, and interrogated Penguin on Oracle and the Arkham Knight's location. Penguin then told Batman that they and Scarecrow had departed to meet up with
   Simon Stagg
   on one of Stagg's Airships, although he managed to escape after some of his men had managed to restrain Batman. However, it wasn't without a cost, as Nightwing saved Batman and they then blew up the weapons' cache.

   Throughout the night, Penguin's remaining weapons caches were being destroyed by Batman and Nightwing, which gradually angered Penguin to the extent that he began to regularly threaten the drivers of the various vans that were meant to deliver the illicit weapons and by the fourth weapons' cache, he stopped taking the calls altogether.

   Around the time that Batman tracked the fourth weapons' cache in Gotham, Nightwing snooped around and uncovered the final weapons' cache, although he ended up captured by Penguin and was held hostage, with Penguin transmitting a video message that revealed Nightwing's current status with the threat that he would kill him if Batman didn't back off. After Batman traced and freed Nightwing from his bonds and defeated Penguin's men in the room, Penguin managed to subdue Nightwing just as Batman was about to destroy the final weapons cache. While Penguin threatened Batman (as well as Nightwing alluding to his past as being a part of the Flying Graysons), Nightwing managed to break free and had Batman pin him down.

   Despite demanding Batman to not blow up the weapons cache, Batman did so in front of Penguin and caused him to angrily threaten to kill him if Batman didn't break his one rule of no killing. Penguin was then transferred over to the GCPD Lockup, and also angrily lamented the destruction of his weapons cache, with Batman suggesting that,

   Penguin also appeared in a hallucination where he, alongside Riddler, Two-Face, and Killer Croc had presumably teamed up to capture the Joker by knocking him unconscious, and were discussing how they're to kill him, after he killed 50 of their men, with Penguin, in particular, protesting Two-Face's request that they "kill him right" in a manner befitting justice, citing his earlier murder of 50 of their men. Joker then regained consciousness and revealed that he, in fact, had tracked them down, with Penguin expressing shock citing that they captured him, only for Joker to reveal he had allowed himself to be captured by them while citing that Penguin, though cruel, was never cunning, before revealing his Jokermobile. Penguin then attempted to flee with the other two surviving crime lords (Killer Croc having been crushed by the Jokermobile's explosive entry earlier) while their men tried to gun down Joker and his Jokermobile. Penguin attempted to hide behind a stash of money and eventually tried to plead for mercy only to be shot in cold blood by the Clown Prince of Crime, with the latter citing he never liked his groveling. In another hallucination, it was revealed that Penguin had eventually surpassed Joker as Batman's most well-known nemesis, to the extent that a news broadcast on the radio even announced an upcoming museum exhibit dedicated to the Penguin, much to Joker's chagrin.

   However, even locked up at the GCPD Lockup holding cell was not enough to stop Penguin. After he anticipated the possibility of being arrested, Penguin planned a breakout from the GCPD Lockup with the remaining members of his gang who hadn't been arrested by Batman and even directed them to the Bludhaven docks to retrieve some money that he had stashed there after Batman had ruined several of his operations. Penguin also had his men break him out by cutting the power to the GCPD.

   he was able to actually leave the GCPD. To make matters worse for him, Nightwing also returned to Gotham after he learned of the jailbreak after he thwarted the recovery of Penguin's illegal money stash. Penguin's escape was ultimately foiled by Nightwing, with the latter adding insult to injury by pranking him by posing as one of his men via radio transmission outside the elevator and making it seem as though Nightwing was taken out and thus had the crime lord literally walk right into him. After being brought back to the GCPD, Cash mockingly told him that it hasn't been the same without him, only for Penguin to coldly tell the latter to "get stuffed" while being escorted back to his cell.
  </p>
  <p key="6d8c1bcc-8f54-4c86-bd73-1f0fd45252f3">
   Penguin's attempt to escape from the GCPD through sheer force implied that he could no longer bribe his way out of jail, with Gordon elected as Mayor,
   Aaron Cash
   heading the GCPD, and nearly all of the corruption throughout the city's police department and other infrastructures finally cleaned up. With Nightwing locating the last of Penguin's ill-gotten gains in Bl√ºdhaven, his men rounded up, and his gun supply depleted (to the point that his men had to attempt an earlier purchase from Black Mask before they were foiled by the
   Red Hood
   , who later killed Sionis), it could be assumed that Penguin had finally lost all power and influence within Gotham once and for all and spent the rest of his days behind bars.

   In addition, Penguin's gunrunning spree during the events of Halloween ultimately acted as a diversion against Batman and Nightwing that Two-Face and his gang exploited for their secondary plan of robbing Bludhaven's banks in the event that Two-Face himself had failed to successfully rob Gotham's banks, which went off without a hitch. A month later, some of Two-Face's Henchmen commented on that, especially after the GCPD had seized the stolen assets from Gotham's banks.

  <p key="7d3a7d81-7243-42f6-a5f9-a8b61130c208">
   Since his early ages, Penguin made numerous acquisitions to achieve positions of power, respect, and authority, through the use of brutal and unorthodox torture and other, often intricate, elaborate and violent means, but always sought more to dominate over others and destroy his rivals. Penguin had an extensive love for money and other materialism, but he only took the best, that went for weaponry, equipment and members of his own gang and would often violently outrage over petty slights if things did not match those standards or went precisely the way that he planned. Penguin also enjoyed luxury and extravagance, lived a life of entitlement and lavishness, and did almost anything to regain the influence and fortune that he lost. His ultimate desire was to effectively "own" the entirety of Gotham City, to such an extent that he'd demand for his cut of the pay if someone so much as even

   at the city.
  </p>
  <p key="75819b7f-ddea-4fdb-abf1-cdb3f6159f64">
   Noticeably, Penguin was one of the few Batman villains who was utterly ruthless in his pursuits but seemed quite sane, at least by comparison to the other rogues gallery, as Dr. Young implies in her notes that he was once incarcerated at Arkham Asylum. Glaringly, the most noticeable of Penguin's psychological disorders would have been his Napoleon Complex; caused by his short stature, he acted extremely aggressive, over-dominating, and ruthless towards everyone including his own men. Even Penguin's desire to grow his criminal empire larger was an extension to his greatest goal, and that was to tower over everyone until he was the only one in possession to the keys of the kingdom, including going to war with the other crime lords in Arkham City in order to seize control of the super-prison. Aside from his Napoleon Complex, which has him apparently claiming his misunderstood intellect and business acumen as over-compensation for mockery of his short stature, he also engaged in schizotypical behavior that was rooted in an inferiority complex as well as had an unhealthy obsession with ornithology and umbrellas.
  </p>
  <p key="36a97292-ea98-419a-b0d7-a62605e50c2b">
   Penguin's megalomaniacal and hedonistic tendencies were displayed by the way that he refused to leave Arkham City out of fear that the Joker would take over his territory and made sexual advances on several female characters including his assistants, Candy and Tracey, the League of Assassins Ninja in his display case at the museum and even trying to get Harley Quinn to work as a "girlfriend" of his by offering her a gradually increased sum of money and even an offer to get her "whatever [Harley] wanted", although this mostly failed due to her undying loyalty to the Joker even after the latter's death. He was also somewhat gluttonous, as he mentioned he was just "finishing [his] supper" when inviting the Suicide Squad in to meet with him, which had a full plate of seafood. On a similar note, it is also implied that he has very poor dietary tastes, as he tended to eat raw fish and octopi whole without any prepwork to them beforehand.
  </p>
  <p key="92825c2d-7aa8-417b-808a-efa16ae1a37f">
   Penguin considered himself a collector of sorts and amassed such collection with living and deceased prisoners who were trapped within his museum for display, entertainment, humiliation, and a reminder to his own men. His ruthlessness was such that, during the Arkham City incident, one of the criminals even said regarding the prospect of whether Joker or Penguin would take over Gotham "You think Gotham's bad under the Joker? Wait until Penguin's done with it. Penguin's an animal!", the implication being that he was even less merciful than the Joker.
  </p>
  <p key="611a1649-44b5-41a6-a90d-53ed5591016b">
   Though he had amassed an extensive number of followers, Penguin had little concern for any of them and even left his remaining forces who were trapped in Joker's territory to die after he blew up the bridges that connected Arkham City. Nevertheless, the competent or loyal henchman that got on his good side, Penguin did treat them better, paid them better than most, granted them passage into the Iceberg Lounge, and granted them top-of-the-line equipment.
  </p>
  <p key="1c77b642-0ca0-4f97-b571-cac550cd9f36">
   Beyond that, Penguin was heavily reliant on fear to keep his men in line, and intimidated them constantly with the threat of death, physical threat, brutal torture, or an exaggerated cockney accent. Penguin had a hatred for traitors and squealers and planned to cut the tongue out of a henchman who informed Batman of Freeze's location in his museum and tortured the ten undercover GCPD Officers who disguised themselves within his gang. He would occasionally kill or otherwise maim his men for simply being the bearer of bad news, such as "shooting the messenger" (or more aptly breaking the arm) of the man who informed him how the Arkham Knight had slaughtered his men as well as that of another criminal group they were meeting at the time.
  </p>
  <p key="dd3f1d77-3cdd-494e-807d-26a93045507a">
   He also had very little tolerance with failure, once threatening to castrate the drivers of one of the North Refrigeration trucks carrying weapons if they ended up leading Batman to the third stockpile area for his illicit weapons, and also nearly beat a man to a pulp when initially assuming his injuries (including a broken arm) were because he and the rest of the group failed to deliver the right amount to another criminal group they were to meet up with. In addition, at times Penguin's abrasive treatment of his soldiers can also negatively impact him. A notable example of this was in Arkham City when he had a sniper positioned near the Joker's location, and he eventually annoyed the sniper enough with his pestering him of information that said sniper, despite his having a perfect opportunity to kill the Joker then and there, deliberately let him live simply to spite his employer. Although very unforgiving towards his foes, he was nevertheless pragmatic enough to realize when sparing his foes would ultimately benefit him, which was especially evident by his encounter with the Suicide Squad, and more specifically its member Harley Quinn: When he realized Harley was part of the Suicide Squad, he deeply considered gunning her down as revenge for her role in torching one of his contraband delivery trucks, and partially because it would be "bad for business" for him to treat her mercifully for her role, although he ultimately decided to spare her when realizing from Deadshot that, as much as it would be bad for business to be lenient with Harley after that action, it would be even worse for his business if he gunned Harley Quinn and any members of the Suicide Squad near her due to it resulting in a reputation of him double-crossing his clients. Another instance of this pragmatism was when he worked alongside the other gangs, in particular Two-Face, despite hating them solely in order to take out Batman (and also implied that the short-term alliance would benefit his gang and especially him in the sense of gaining massive profits regarding the illicit weapons sales). On a similar note, one of his

   game over quotes has him expressing disappointment in Batman's death, because he felt he'd get even more money or at least more of a bargaining chip if the latter remained alive
  </p>
  <p key="23459820-3536-4f97-88c6-ff2305fbeede">
   He also was shown to be sarcastic, at least by the time of the events of Scarecrow's takeover of Gotham, which had been demonstrated twice. The first time was while Batman was pursuing several henchmen to one of their hideouts: Penguin, who by that time was outraged over losing two weapons stockpiles to Batman, sarcastically forgave them when they apologized for Batman tailing them. The second time was while his men were working to restore power to the elevator and asked him how he was holding up, where he sarcastically claimed that he was having "the time of his life" in the stalled elevator. Both times, he also angrily told them he wasn't actually being serious when his henchmen asked if he was being serious.
  </p>
  <p key="e4b013ed-d1cb-43c4-9302-1e6487995335">
   When faced with a truly powerful opponent, such as Catwoman and Batman, Penguin abandoned his intimidating and menacing persona and reverted to his cowardly nature, groveled for his life, and desperately pleaded or apologized in a frantic manner to not be hurt further. In the face of cowardice through or in possession of a superior hand or ulterior design, Penguin could be defiant, such as adopting a sarcastic, arrogant, and taunting facade throughout Batman's advance in his museum and pretending to beg when he was overpowered at the Iceberg Lounge just after he rigged the explosives where Batman was standing on. Even when Batman permanently disabled Solomon Grundy by ripping out his heart and crushing it, Penguin nonetheless opted to personally confront his nemesis with a six-shot grenade launcher despite being at a significant disadvantage. He also found the courage to threaten to kill Batman while he was pinned down and claimed that the Dark Knight would have to kill him otherwise and continued that nature while he was taken to the GCPD Lockup (although that would only occur due to Scarecrow's reveal of Bruce Wayne's identity of Batman and Batman cured of the Joker Infection).

  <p key="88b1ddda-2689-46e4-a225-4a6f78f1d72b">
   Matching his name, Penguin had a fondness for ice-related or Arctic paraphernalia as well aquatic and used it for the cover of his operations and establishment such as the Iceberg Lounge and North Refrigeration. He also stole Freeze's Freeze Gun and used it against Batman and several undercover cops, and encased them in a pool of frozen water where he had his personal shark, Tiny, which he fed traitors or other insubordinate henchmen to. Also, Penguin was a heavy cigar smoker, but it's unknown if the voice box in his throat was there because of smoking or from an injury that was caused because of Batman. Owing to his name, his henchmen also have logos that resemble penguins, as well as having balaclavas that have a superficial resemblance to a penguin's head.
