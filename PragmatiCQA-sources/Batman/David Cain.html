   David Cain is one of the world's premier assassins, whose victims have included some of the most famous and powerful people on the planet. He trained the young Bruce Wayne with the skills that he would use as Batman, although Bruce has never used such techniques. Regarding his training, Batman explained, "Knowing

   Cain desired a perfect partner with whom to carry out his assassination plans. Attempts to train young children resulted in failure, so he decided to conceive one himself. He found the perfect mother in a martial artist named Sandra Wu-San. He watched her and her sister duel at a tournament and concluded that it was her sister Carolyn that was holding Sandra back from her full potential. He murdered Carolyn and ambushed Sandra with the help of

   Cain trained Cassandra in every imaginable form of violence, from hand-to-hand combat to weapons and explosives. Cain never taught her to read or write; her only language was her ability to read people and predict what her opponents were going to do. When she was 8 years old, Cain took her to kill a businessman. After she did, she "read" him as he died, she saw death as the man saw it. "Terror and then... nothing". It was this reading that made her decide that murder was wrong and she ran away from Cain.

Cain's ulterior motive is to see if Batman was worthy enough of raising Cassandra; having realised that the troubled young man who came to him for training as a child was Batman, Cain set up a frame that not only publically incriminated Bruce Wayne, but also planted a complex sequence of evidence that would imply to his allies that Batman killed Vesper before she could deduce his identity. After the two engage in a fight near the end of the story arc, Cain believes that Batman is indeed worthy and turns himself in to clear Wayne's name.

Cain was proud of this and told Cassandra her birthday and said that "My little girl... all grown up." He once escaped prison undetected to give Cassandra a birthday present before returning.
