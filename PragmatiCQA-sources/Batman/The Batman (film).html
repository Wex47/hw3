    THE BATMAN is an edgy, action-packed thriller that depicts Batman in his early years, struggling to balance rage with righteousness as he investigates a disturbing mystery that has terrorized Gotham. Robert Pattinson delivers a raw, intense portrayal of Batman as a disillusioned, desperate vigilante awakened by the realization that the anger consuming him makes him no better than the ruthless serial killer he’s hunting.

   Ben Affleck
   , who portrayed
   Batman
   in the films, was originally set to write and direct the film, in addition to starring as the character. Writer
   Geoff Johns
   helped co-write the initial drafts for the script, which featured
   Deathstroke
   as the main villain. An
   Arkham Asylum
   breakout played a major role in the story. Despite initially being slated for 2018, Affleck dropped out of directing in January 2017, due to concerns about his wellbeing.
   Matt Reeves
   was brought in replace him the next month and allowed a year to finish production on the film

   Sometime in December 2019, a tweet reportedly said that a special location in Cardington, Bedfordshire has been reserved for a funeral scene that will be filmed in February. It was also said that people from ages 18-70 are being sought for special roles in the film, presumably funeral guests. Though not confirmed some speculate it could be Thomas &amp; Martha Wayne's funeral, then again the film won't be an origin story, and some say it will be for a completely different character. Later on in December, a picture was tweeted showing the cathedral location surrounded by mini airship probs. Another point in December 2019, it was rumored that Robert Pattinson's Batsuit, could be based on the design that was previously posted as somewhat fan art by Lee Bermejo. The post was then deleted, possibly being that would be the final design for Pattinson's batsuit.

Another tweet had been posted by a person named: Jordan Lee, saying that he was in Thames, and saw cop cars saying 'Gotham Police', as well as a van called 'Gotham Action News 4 HD', and finally a truck with the logo of 'Gotham Water &amp; Power', so filming is slated to start around this time.
