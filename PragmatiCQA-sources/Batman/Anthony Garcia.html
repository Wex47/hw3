   Eight years after the death of District Attorney
   Harvey Dent
   , Mayor Garcia is rumored by a Congressman to be planning on retiring Commissioner
   Jim Gordon
   from his position in the force due to the
   time of peace
   . Following Gordon's hospitalization by
   Bane
   , Mayor Garcia attended a football game, where Bane initiated a "revolution" in Gotham. It started by setting off a bomb in the private booth where Mayor Garcia and several other politicians were viewing the game from and the blast killed all of them within. Even up to his death, Garcia never knew the truth about Harvey Dent. The truth of Harvey Dent's actions were eventually revealed by Bane himself, who stormed Blackgate prison, and read documents obtained from Jim Gordon which is a written confession by the police commissioner as well as a letter of resignation. In the past, Garcia was determined to never repeal the Dent Act while in office, but it is unknown if he would have done other-wise if he had known what Harvey Dent has done before his death.
