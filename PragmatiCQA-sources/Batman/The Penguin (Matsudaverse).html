   Gotham City
   's other villains may have it out for Batman, Penguin was unique in that his scorn was often directed at Bruce Wayne, who served as a constant reminder of everything that he was not. Employing the use of highly trained birds and an arsenal of deadly umbrellas, as well as his faithful
   Kabuki Twins
   , Penguin was determined to rebuild the Cobblepot fortune by criminal means.

   Oswald "Ozzy" Cobblepot is descended from an aristocratic family whose lineage goes back to Newcastle, England. Alfred Pennyworth's grandfather was once a butler to the English Cobblepot's and Alfred was raised on stories on how cruel and disrespectful the Cobblepots were to their staff. A few years ago, Cobblepot left Gotham City and spent several years traveling the Orient. There he met two silent female assassins known only as the Kabuki Twins who later went on to work for him as his personal bodyguards. Despite his portly physique, Cobblepot took an interest in martial arts, and trained his body into top fighting form.

   Oswald eventually returned to the United States whereupon he used his birds to nab various riches from Gotham's wealthiest citizens. He stored his ill-gotten gains in the aviary at Cobblepot Manor. One evening, Oswald crashed a charity drive hosted by Bruce Wayne at Wayne Manor. He nearly came to blows with
   Alfred Pennyworth
   whose memory of his grandfather's mistreatment at the hands of the Cobblepots was as clear as ever. After making a scene, Oswald managed to snatch the party's guest list and used this information to select his future targets. Bruce Wayne assumed that Cobblepot's return to Gotham City coincided with the most recent rash of burglaries and he investigated the crimes as his costumed alter ego â the Batman. Pennyworth, still angry with Cobblepot's behavior at the fund raiser, decided to take matters into his own hands. He went to Oswald's family mansion, but was captured by the Kabuki Twins. Batman arrived at the manor shortly thereafter and Oswald and he faced each other for the first time. Now calling himself the Penguin, he demonstrated his fighting skills against the Batman and the two engaged in a protracted battle across the room. Batman eventually proved victorious and the Penguin was captured.
