   Jervis Tetch, formerly a research scientist, is completely smitten with the works of Lewis Carroll. As his criminal name indicates, he takes the appearance of the Mad Hatter from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He is an insane neuroscientist and developed hardware that can control the brain and induce hypnotic states, and often uses hats or other headgear for mind control.

  <p key="f2f93f86-5891-4729-bf93-cd1c752c5ef5">
   In his first appearance, the Mad Hatter attempted to steal a trophy from the Gotham Yacht Club, but was foiled by

   Tetch's base of operations in Gotham was destroyed following a search for an atomic weapon, by Robin III, Tim Drake and Captain Boomerang II, Owen Mercer.

   It has been revealed that Tetch designed a hat to make him happy beyond the measures of what illegal drugs can accomplish.

   Scandal tends to Hatter's wound, and Catman administers an antidote to Tetch. While the Six face off against Cheshire and
   Vandal Savage
   , Hatter takes on Dr. Psycho one on one, and emerges victorious despite his injuries, possibly killing Dr. Psycho with Cheshire's dagger. Hatter saves Scandal from falling to her death, and the Six tell Tetch that they are his friends, something Tetch has never had. As Hatter stands atop Savage's destroyed base with Ragdoll, he expresses deep happiness and excitement about having friends. He says to Ragdoll that he will be a very good friend in return. Ragdoll then pushes Hatter off the roof, seemingly to his death, saying there's only room for one dandy freak on the team. Miraculously, Tetch survived the fall. Heartbroken, he vowed revenge on the rest of the Six.

   Tetch often utilizes his technological mind-control devices to commit his crimes. He is also a master of hypnotism and mind control.

   Jervis Tetch is fascinated with hats of all shapes and sizes, as well as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking Glass, particularly favoring the chapter 'A Mad Tea Party'. He is obsessive-compulsive, highly delusional, suffers from psychotic manic depression, and can even sometimes be homicidal. It has been hinted in recent years that he is a pedophile, kidnapping little girls with the name "Alice". He won't eat a piece of food that doesn't have a hat on it. He exhibits delusions and thought processes typical of schizophrenia. Not only is he often known to quote and associate with Carroll's Wonderland novels, but he often fails to discern between these stories and reality. He will go to insane lengths to get what he wants.
