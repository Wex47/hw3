   Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech's deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station's antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J'onn J'onzz' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna's destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch.

J'onzz reported that Batman was dead, but in truth, he had mentally shielded Batman to prevent the Imperium forces from detecting him.

   Inspired by a general's speech about vigilance and the possible return of the invaders, Batman had the Watchtower constructed by Wayne Enterprises, hiding the funding as a "line item in the aerospace R&amp;D budget". Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station. The seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn't a "people person", Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help.

On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being taken prisoner by an Amazon trained criminal.

However, Batman still held a deep respect for the Man of Steel, especially after he had seemingly died at the hands of Toyman. But, regardless of his respect, Batman remained stubborn in his disbelief in Superman's death, and refused to mourn for him for quite a while.

   After these events, Robin went missing for three weeks while on patrol, with Batman and Batgirl searching for him, until they learned he was at
   Arkham Asylum
   . They encounter Joker and
   Harley Quinn
   , who reveal that they adopted a son named J.J.(Joker, Jr.), who was actually Robin brainwashed and driven insane. Joker seems to escape, with Batman hot in pursuit. However, he was actually trying to lure Batman into Arkham's Cineplex, where he reveals that he subjected Robin to countless amounts of psychological and physical tortures, and because of this, Joker now knows Batman's true identity, and everything about him. Batman, enraged at the cruelty and torture Joker inflicted onto Robin, smashes through the theater box, and beats Joker down (wrecking the projector in the process, causing Joker to say "If you don't like the movie, I've got slides!"), then hurls Joker down to the room that J.J.'s in.
  </p>
  <p key="47b459ba-a33e-4fe2-a5a4-161d5e6625a1">
   Batman threatens to break Joker in half, causing the Joker to retort that he would have done it years ago if he really wanted to do it. Suddenly, The Joker draws a switchblade, and slices Batman's chest, as well as stabs his leg. He then gives what looks like a gun to J.J. and tells him to kill Batman (or, in his words, "deliver the punchline."). J.J. then pulls the trigger, revealing the gun to actually be the infamous "Bang!" flag spear gun that is one of the Joker's trademark weapons. J.J. apparently hesitates to kill Batman, causing the Joker to shout "DO IT!". Tim reluctantly obliges.

  <p key="0ee8d3da-3b1f-4775-8b69-ff1ccfb4a4da">
   Instead of killing Batman however, he instead turns it away at the last second, thus shooting the Joker instead, killing him. J.J. half laughs and half sobs at the events, and Batgirl (having arrived after her fight with Harley Quinn) tries to console him. Commissioner Gordon and Batman later bury the body of Joker in the ruins of Arkham, and Tim is taken to Doctor Leslie Thompkins for rehabilitation. After these events, Batman forbade Tim Drake from ever becoming Robin again. Tim attempted to go solo for a few years, but in the end quit the super-hero life, got married and had children. He broke off contact with Bruce but remained close with Barbara and perhaps Dick. Also, as a result of the fight, Batman walked with a slight limp which in his later years would force him to walk with a cane.

   Many years passed following the attack of the Joker on the Bat-Family, Bruce entered middle age and began to suffer with a bad heart from the effects of a hard life of crime fighting. Batman developed a powered high tech suit (which had longer Bat ears and minus a cape) that augmented his physical abilities and allowed him to continue the never-ending battle for a few more years. At this time, his corporate rivalry with Derek Powers began, and Wayne Enterprises resisted a hostile bid for corporate takeover.

  <p key="142c40e5-043d-4f3b-a659-9837f710989d">
   However, injuries suffered through the long decades of physical punishment and an ailing heart finally took their toll, and even the suit couldn't compensate any longer. While attempting to rescue his old friend Veronica Vreeland's daughter
   Bunny Vreeland

   Injured, Batman limps outside the hangar, removing his mask upon realizing he was wielding a handgun, forced to rely on the weapon of his parents' cowardly murderer to defend himself against criminals. Ashamed, Bruce returns to the Batcave, where he places the Batsuit in the costume display gallery. Walking to the top of the stairs, Bruce takes one last look at the Batcave and solemnly vows, "Never again."

   When he hung up the mantle of the bat, Bruce came a recluse, shut off in Wayne Manor with his dog, Ace.

It was now the year 2039 and Bruce Wayne had become a very old man.

  <p key="3cd1c3ed-8258-4120-998b-9ce4eb5d94d4">

   The elderly Bruce Wayne occasionally ventured into the field to support Terry.

   As Bruce continued to age, he suffered a kidney failure. When it was discovered that Terry was not just a suitable donor but a perfect one, their relationship reached its weakest point; Terry, like Dick Grayson before him, felt betrayed, manipulated, and outright used. He set off to uncover the truth from someone willing to reveal it. Terry confronted Amanda Waller and learned the truth about his heritage. In her earlier years, Waller realized the world would always need a Batman. Taking fate into her own hands (unbeknownst to Bruce), she gathered a sample of Bruce Wayne's genetic material, after a battle that left Batman in need of medical attention. Using her Cadmus connections, Waller implanted this genetic material into a young Warren McGinnis, replacing his genetic material with Bruce's. Thus, Terry McGinnis was born, the son of Bruce Wayne, sharing half his genetic code.
