   Bruce Wayne was the son of
   Dr. Thomas Wayne
   and his wife
   Martha
   , and heir to the Wayne fortune. Not much is known about his childhood, but it seemed to be a happy one. However, at the age of nine, the family was ambushed whilst returning from a showing at the Monarch Theatre. The man,
   Joe Chill
   , shot his parents dead but fled upon hearing police sirens, leaving Bruce alive. Picked up by the family's butler
   Alfred Pennyworth
   , Bruce grew up under his care and guidance.

   After this event, Bruce pledged to avenge his parents and make Gotham a safer place. For years, he trained in various martial arts, crime investigation techniques and criminology. By his late twenties, Bruce had secretly become a vigilante known as the "Batman", fighting crime and corruption in Gotham. As his civilian identity, Bruce became friends with District Attorney
   Harvey Dent
   and, as Batman, an ally of Police Lieutenant
   James Gordon
   . Bruce also received help in his operations from Alfred and

   woman in a catsuit
   had broken into
   the Mayor's
   office and broken into the safe. After defeating the last of the mercenaries, Batman chased her to the roof and fought her. During the fight, he recovered an encrypted drive she had stolen from the safe. As the thief made her escape, Batman tried to subdue the thief with a Bat-Stunner. This caused her to fall from the rooftop, leading him to jump after and catch her. The thief escaped by pickpocketing his Grappling Gun from his utility belt and using it to hang from a passing monorail.

   After the encounter, Bruce returned to Wayne Manor, where Alfred performed minor surgery on his new injuries, and prepared for the fundraiser for Harvey's Mayoral campaign. After witnessing his speech, they talked about Bruce's absence and how he could influence the campaign. During the event, Bruce tried to convinced Wayne Enterprise Board members

   After being informed by Alfred that crime lord
   Carmine Falcone
   had arrived, Bruce learnt that Harvey had invited him in the hopes that he would help get the strings pulled to get him into the Mayor seat. To this end, he was forced to welcome Falcone and talk with him privately in the parlor. During the conversation, Falcone tried to convince him to enter a partnership, during which he brought up Bruce's father. Regardless of whether Bruce chooses to associate with him or not, the meeting was interrupted by Alfred, which prompted Falcone to leave.
  </p>
  <p key="c3e54a79-2f59-4cbc-ab2b-57c8331cbd4b">
   After the fundraiser, Bruce returned to the Batcave and began looking at the drive he'd confiscated from "Catwoman". Discovering it was encrypted, he set the Batcomputer to decrypt it and found that it contained information about East Side Docks. Bruce also searched up Catwoman in the GCPD archives, finding nothing about her but a few jobs within the city. Whilst talking to Alfred, Bruce learnt that his childhood friend
   <a href="The Penguin (Telltale).html" key="39278e6b-d052-4dea-b975-e0212301a793" title="The Penguin (Telltale)">
    Oswald Cobblepot
   </a>
   had been at the fundraiser and made arrangements to meet up in
   his family's old park
   . Learning more about Cobblepot's criminal activities as "the Penguin", Bruce decided to go through with the meeting to discover why he'd returned.
  </p>
  <p key="e9cb4abf-b4a2-47d7-b755-43ad22129568">
   Arriving at the allotted time, Bruce received a text from Oswald saying that he was running late. Whilst waiting at the statue, he was confronted by two muggers, whom he fought off with Cobblepot's help. The two conversed about their own pasts since their last meeting, particularly the Cobblepot family's collapse. They also discussed Carmine's attendance of the party, with Oswald showing his displeasure towards the crime boss, expressing his desire to see him fall. He then brought up that he was leading a "revolution" that would change Gotham and warned Bruce on the right side. Oswald left to organize the revolution, whilst Bruce received a text from Alfred about the Thomas &amp; Martha Wayne Memorial Hospital press conference.
  </p>
  <p key="bdf943d2-009f-4aa7-bd59-2fcc78a86852">
   Arriving at the conference just in time, Bruce and Harvey announced their intentions to use it to replace the decrepit
   Arkham Asylum
   . During the conference, he received a text from Alfred, asking him to come back to the manor urgently. During the questions and answers section, Bruce was confronted about an account held by his father and Falcone, learning that Gotham's news establishments had received information from an anonymous source. Receiving many questions about his family's ties to Falcone's crime family, Bruce decided to leave and received a call from Alfred, who told him that the GCPD were raiding Wayne Manor.
  </p>
  <p key="7e31318b-ff89-4ffb-8bee-d35e84b804e1">
   Returning to find the GCPD officers in the middle of the investigation, Bruce talked to Gordon and learnt that the search had been approved by Mayor Hill. He reluctantly allowed the officers to take files related to his father's accounts and Wayne Enterprises. Gordon also left a copy of warrant with Bruce. After the GCPD left, he was met by Vicki, who offered to help him though the crisis and help his family's reputation. After they discussed possible theories on who may have released the information, Vicki asked Bruce to give a quote to defend himself.  After she left, he and Alfred decided to confront Harvey about the warrant.
  </p>
  <p key="322029a8-b6fa-4d0d-9ca7-a1393401ffb2">
   Meeting at Café Triste that evening, Bruce learnt that Hill had done this without Harvey's authority and began making plans to investigate it themselves. The conversation was interrupted by Harvey's date, Selina Kyle, who recognize each other from an injuries they'd received from the other. After a brief conversation, Harvey left to rally damage control, leaving Bruce to confront her. Revealing she was aware that he was Batman, Selina tried to get him to hand over the drive. Bruce refused, instead offering to track down her employers. Desperate to not suffer repercussions, Selina reluctantly gave him the address that she was meant to meet them at. When Harvey returned, Bruce gave an excuse to leave and headed off to investigate as Batman.

   Batman arrived at the address, a warehouse in the Gotham Docks, and discovered there had been a shootout between the GCPD and

  <p key="1d133bc1-f09a-494a-9179-c443b6d2fc7d">
   Returning to the Batcave, Bruce was confronted by Alfred for his use of violence. The butler implored him to use less violent techniques or, should he continue to do so, not to forget the reasons for becoming Batman. After the computer finished decrypting the drive, they discovered that it contained a complete manifest of Falcone's criminal empire. With the information they had, Bruce realized that he could now destroy Falcone's empire and finally arrest him. They discussed either giving the information to Gordon to help the GCPD dismantle the Falcone empire or giving it to Vicki so that the information was public. Depending on who Bruce decides to give it to, the following possibilities will occur.

Interrogating the criminal, Batman learnt that the warehouse was actually owned by Falcone, along with the chemicals stolen. The crime lord also denied playing a part of the shootout. With the GCPD entering the building and Falcone refusing to answer any more questions, Batman has the option to either brutalize or arrest the criminal. Regardless of the choice, the crime lord revealed that the allegations against his parents were true. Shocked by the revelation, Batman fled as the GCPD arrived.

   The next morning, Bruce returned to Crime Alley for the first time in years. Met by Alfred, Bruce learned that he had been aware of the truth and that he had hidden it so that he could grow up without his father's ties to crime. Alfred also admitted to almost left Thomas' employ but stayed because of his parents' deaths. Suspecting that their murder was linked to their connections, Bruce tried to recall the event to see if their was any link to their criminal ties. With Alfred's help, he began to recall more details, including his father demanding that Chill told Falcone was making a mistake. With this epiphany, Bruce decided to visit the crime lord in the GCPD to get more answers about his parents' involvement in his organization and the possible link to him in their murder.

   With Harvey's help, Bruce managed to arrange to visit Falcone in the GCPD. Met by Gordon, Bruce was shown to Falcone's confines in the infirmary. During the trip, they discussed Batman's recent actions and the effect he was making on the city. Bruce also met
   Stg. Renee Montoya
   , who showed him her support despite the allegations against his family. Arriving at the infirmary, Bruce was left to talk to Falcone alone. As they talked, Bruce learned more about his father's operations with Falcone and how close the two actually were. When asked about his involvement their murder, Bruce learned that the crime lord was not involved. However, before he could reveal the true culprit, Falcone was shot dead by Montoya. Before she could attack any of the approaching officers, Bruce subdued her, noticing the blue veins on her lips.

   With Gordon, Bruce escorted Montoya to one of the interrogation rooms. Waiting for Harvey, they discussed ways to handle the fallout from these events and theories why she would have killed Falcone. After Dent and Gordon left to handle the criminal's lawyers, Bruce investigated Montoya himself, identifying evidence that she had been drugged. When she awoke, he learnt that the person had mentioned a "revolution", leading him to realize that Oswald had been involved. When Gordon and Harvey returned from the conference, Bruce left to return to the Batcave and locate Cobblepot, briefly bumping into Vicki Vale as he left.

Oswald confessed to playing a part in it, claiming that Batman had not gone far enough during their confrontation. Batman also learned of their plans to attack Mayor Hill and Bruce Wayne. When Cobblepot revealed that they had located Catwoman and deduced her identity, he left the building and ordered one of his men,

Entering a bar fight, Bruce and Selina managed to defeat the group and left the bar before police could arrive. Hiding in an alleyway, they managed to avoid the police, sharing a brief moment together as they did so. Shortly afterwards, Selina left to escape via the rooftops whilst Bruce investigated a phone he had taken from one the men. Discovering messages from Mayor Hill to Penguin, he deduced that they had been working together. Deciding to pay him a visit, Bruce must choose whether to go as himself or Batman.

   As the GCPD attempted to raid the auditorium, Batman took the opportunity to confront Penguin. He helped Vicki Vale, who he had been held hostage by Penguin, escape and fought Blockbuster. Though able to get the upper hand, Batman was distracted when Hill admitted to ordering his parents' murder, allowing the henchman to subdue him. After Penguin murdered Hill, Batman was able to defeat Blockbuster by beating him unconscious with a Bat-Stunner and confronted Cobblepot, who now held Dent hostage. Despite his orders to stand down, the criminal shot at them, hitting and injuring Catwoman.

     If Bruce decides to meet Harvey as Batman, he confronts Dent on City Hall's roof. Depending on whether Batman saved him, Dent will either try to negotiate with him or refuse to talk to him. Regardless, Harvey refuses to lay off his plans and orders his men to blow up the warehouse where the Arkham drug was kept. When Dent reveals that he had ordered Gordon to be executed for objecting, Batman threatens him to tell him where Gordon is. As enforcers gather, Harvey reveals that he has been taken to Crime Alley, prompting the vigilante to leave.

His Batuit is incapacitated by one of the anti-Bat weapons and he is almost killed, only to be saved by Grogan at the cost of his own life. Though able to recover, he is unable to save the Commissioner from being killed, but incapacitates the mercenary.

During this, he learnt that Alfred had the opportunity to expose his father and that his mother also intend to. Regardless of his reaction, they decided to find and stop Lady Arkham's plans. Using Bruce's restored access to the Wayne Enterprises network, Oswald's tampering with public records and their knowledge of Vicki Vale, they deduced that she was planning to break into a known landmark, using the codes Cobblepot provided to the group. However, with Penguin now incarcerated, they would have to do the job physically, meaning that they would have to go to the landmark themselves.

Arriving at the manor, he found the parlor in a state of disrepair and evidence of a scuffle.

Following it, he found a recording from the Children of Arkham threatening to kill Alfred in his place. Gathering clues from the recording through reflections in Alfred's glasses, they learned that he had been taken to the Vale residence. After receiving

Investigating the area behind it, he found a makeshift torture chamber. Realizing that the Vales had abused Vicki whilst she was in their care, he deduced why she had been full of rage and what had driven her to murder them. Bruce also discovered that Alfred had also been put through the same abuse, but had also left a message in chalk that was the same color as his tech. From it, he learned that Vicki planned to take over Arkham Asylum and release its inmates.

   Discussing the claims with the board, Bruce decided to investigate the claims personally. Calling a meeting between former staff at Arkham Asylum, he learned about his father's activities within the Asylum. Midway through the meeting, one of the former workers was shot, causing Bruce to call security and lead the others to safety. Slipping away and suiting up as Batman, he found
   a lone sniper
   had fired the shots, dubbing him as "Deadshot". Making his way to the site, Batman found that the gunman had fled and left a sniper rifle behind.
  </p>
  <p key="ed48f4c5-6431-4713-a878-63bcf02dfcd6">
   With GCPD arriving, Bruce attended questioning to obtain possible theories to the sniper's identity. Among these was the possibility that it was one of the families suing him, proposed by Regina, or a Wayne Enterprises board member covering their tracks, from Gordon. Believing the gun would bring him to the shooter, Batman interrogated a gunrunner to learn the assassin's identity. However, the hood revealed this to be a dead-end, due to the number of similar models were being shipped by various other criminals filling the void created by the Children of Arkham.

  <p key="f5071629-74fe-4f4f-a4c2-8a66a531de63">
   Choosing to monitor the victims instead, Batman came across another mercenary and identified them as
   the Black Spider
   . Entering a confrontation with the assassin, he learned that the Wayne Enterprises attacker was actually the client. However, Black Spider was serving as a distraction for Batman, allowing "Deadshot" to kill the victim. Now knowing the assassin's motivation, he and Alfred decided to break into Arkham Asylum to gather information about patients held there, hoping it would lead to the assassin's identity. Using various gadgets prepared by Lucius to bypass improved security measures, Batman was able to enter the records room, where he fought and defeated Black Spider.
  </p>
  <p key="82cba170-ebb2-4987-afcf-7a0c0e374931">
   Using the records, Bruce deduced that Deadshot wasn't targeting Arkham Staff in revenge for a loss, but rather inmates that his father had released. This led him to real-estate tycoons George and Genevieve Lawton, who had been admitted to the facility for abusing their sons Edward and Floyd. Bruce deduced that Thomas had freed them to obtain property for lower costs. However, Edward had been killed in an apparent accident months after their release, leaving Floyd the only possible suspect. Bruce also suspected that the Lawton's murder-suicide years later might have been Floyd taking revenge upon them, due to flimsy evidence within the report. After weeks of trying to bring Deadshot out into the open as Batman, Bruce decided that the best course of action would be to meet him in person.
  </p>
  <p key="56151711-420d-4e31-a999-2cff902ddad3">
   Arriving at Lawton's estate, Bruce accused him of being Deadshot and confronted him on their parents' ties. When the billionaire denied the accusations and revealed disregard for the lives he'd taken, Bruce finally lost his temper and argued that the staff were fearful of his father. In response, Lawton revealed the truth about his parents, revealing that his brother had informed the authorities. When they were released from Arkham, the Lawtons had hidden their abusive nature until they were certain they were not being monitored by child welfare services. Bruce also learned that Edward Lawton's death was not an accident, but had been murdered by his parents while attempting to defend Floyd.
  </p>
  <p key="73557add-da23-476f-9a21-3647f994aa50">
   Though Lawton admitted to having trained in shooting, he denied involvement with his parents' deaths, retaining the murder-suicide story. In order to bait Lawton, Bruce threatened to use his resources to reopen the case, leading the playboy threaten him with a gun and confirm his suspicions. As Lawton calmed down, police arrived to escort Bruce out, having been reported to be acting antagonistically towards him. As he left the estate, he realized that Deadshot would no longer be targeting Thomas' allies, but his family and friends.

   , the Director of the Agency. Claiming Gordon and the GCPD were loose cannons, she tried to convince Batman to work with her and the Agency locate the Riddler. Whilst Waller left to get a detail on Mori, she left two of her agents,
   Iman Avesta
   and
   Vernon Blake
   , to talk with him. Avesta gave him a psychiatric evaluation of the Riddler, though asked about why the criminal had targeted Mori and tried to learn about Batman's fascination with the criminally insane. She would then add his response to a psychiatric report she was writing about the vigilante. After Waller returned, she threatened Batman that he would have to cooperate with her and the Agency, to which he can respond to aggressively, tell her about the Riddler's puzzle box or simply grapple away.

   Batman returned to the Batcave to observe the box. After leaving the Batcomputer to scan it, Bruce accessed information about both the Agency and the Riddler, learning about their past exploits. After the computer finished scanning, finding nothing lethal inside, Bruce observed it to find a puzzle, which he solved. With the box now taking the shape of a disc, he found a riddle, which he was able to solve. Realized that the box had become a music disc, Bruce played in a gramophone, hearing a message from the Riddler, and the box revealed a radio-wave emitter. Unable to work out what to do, they contacted Lucius and asked him to help solve it. As Bruce prepares to arrive at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius told him that his daughter,
   Tiffany
   , would be working for the company, that being her first day. After packing the Riddler's puzzle into the case, Bruce left for Wayne Enterprises.

   Shortly after his arrival, Bruce met with Regina, who briefed him on the company's stock prices and inquired about the item in the case. As he arrived in his office, he discovered Lucius in his chair and showed him the Riddler's puzzle. As they investigated, Tiffany intruded on the conversation, showing a new drone she had created, which she gave to Bruce as a present. Upon seeing the Riddler's puzzle, she offered to help solve it, which he can either accept or decline her help. After she left, Lucius suggested that he brought Tiffany into his operations as Batman, believing that she would be more useful to him than he ever was.

   As they left for Lucius' office, Bruce found Avesta and Blake outside, having come to talk to him. Letting Lucius leave to investigate the puzzle, Bruce was interviewed about his knowledge on "John", with Iman drawing attention to his connections to Vicki, Harvey, and Oswald; all of which criminals that had a close connection to him. When she accused him of a criminal, Bruce's response was cut off by the evacuation alarm going off. As Avesta and Blake left, Bruce received a call from Lucius, who revealed that he had figured out Riddler's puzzle. He asked Bruce to get Tiffany out of the building and stated how proud he was that they had helped make a difference to Gotham, which was cut off by an explosion. As Bruce looked out over his office's balcony, he discovered Lucius and his office had been destroyed completely.

   Approximately a week later, Bruce attended Lucius' funeral with Alfred. After leaving some departing words, they discussed what he would do with the Riddler after the apprehended him. Bruce also comforted Tiffany, who showed signs of anger and aggression. Believing the puzzle to have been responsible for her father's death, she asked Bruce whether this was true or not. Regardless of his choice, she leaves to consult her family.

   As Bruce looked at Lucius' coffin, he heard John talking to Tiffany and making some inappropriate jokes. Pulling him aside to talk to him, John gave him a card and revealed that he had been discharged from Arkham by Dr. Leland. As the service began, John revealed that he had come to ask for the favor Bruce had owed him for escaping Arkham, regardless of whether he agreed to or not. He asked Bruce to meet a group of friends he had made within the time he had been out of Arkham, which he referred to as "
   the Pact
   ". He also told him about the Riddler and how he was an "enemy" of John. When Bruce showed interest, John revealed that the criminal was operating in the East End of Gotham, though this information only came from rumors. As the service finished, John left to find out more information about the Riddler for Bruce.

   As Batman, he met with Gordon on the roof of the GCPD and conversed with him about the explosion at Wayne Tower and how Waller was affecting the department, along with how it could influence Batman's operations.

   , who had been forced to take part in a puzzle to escape but failed. Using evidence within the room and Gordon's help, Batman learned what mistakes the agent had made and how he could avoid them. They also investigated Riddler's computer, where they found evidence of his deals with Mori and that Riddler had been in conflict with a criminal known only as
   "H"

   After being able to find the final clues, Batman willingly put himself into the Riddler's puzzle and was able to solve it. After opening a safe, he found a homing missile inside. Scanning it, he discovered that it would be directed at specific radio frequencies, leading him to realize that it had been involved in Lucius' death. The Riddler then contacted him and Gordon, claiming to have been a victim of the Agency before Waller took over as director and that he had plans for them. He also mocked Batman with Lucius' death and told Gordon about his involvement. After they left the lair and told Waller about her agent, the commissioner confronted Batman on what Riddler said and whether he had any involvement, something the vigilante can confess to having some involvement or deny it. He then left to return to the Batcave and investigate further.

  <p key="671c7730-9a95-4120-817f-e7b927f41729">
   With the new details on Lucius' death now known, Bruce deduced that Riddler was planning to use the missiles to attack the Agency, by hacking its agents' phones and making them give off firing signals, drawing the missiles to their locations. He also deduced that he had solved the Riddler's puzzle box, but that the Batcave's scrambler had prevented the signal from getting out. He formulated a plan to draw Riddler's missiles away with Tiffany's drone, by duplicating the signal, and draw them away from Gotham, knowing the Riddler will fire them at the city if his plan didn't go through. Bruce then retrieved a sample of the signal from a recording of Lucius' death, so he could redirect the missiles and neutralize them from the agents' phones.

   Deciding to find the Riddler, Alfred suggested that Bruce used Riddler's second in command, Eli Knable, who is currently in Waller's custody, but warned that doing so would endorse the agency and damage his reputation with Gordon. At the same time, Bruce received a text from John that suggested that he used Mori, as he had dealt with the Riddler and would have kept tabs on him, though this would show Bruce working with criminals and draw more attention from the Agency. Depending on the decision made, two possibilities will happen.

Riddler revealed himself to be conscious, having found a way to neutralize the Bat-Stunner used on him and unveiled the missile launcher. He then asked Batman to answer a number of riddles in order to save the remaining hostages. If he refused to answer even one, an agent would die, but answering them would fire a sonic blast at him and Avesta, which could kill her if used three times.

When Harley returned, Bruce is forced to choose between either himself or Selina.

     If Bruce chose to take the blame for the theft, he is able to escape the cryo chamber by hacking the EMP generator with his phone. After escaping, he gives Alfred an update and summons the Batmobile to his location. After suiting up, he arrives at the Bodhi Spa, only to find staff and patrons brutally murdered by the Pact. After finding a living SANCTUS employee, he goes into the lab to stop the Pact.

   Following their arrival, Bruce/Batman watched as the Agency arrested Bane and cleared up the lab. In the middle of it, he told Alfred to contact Tiffany and get her to come over to Wayne Manor, to hide from Quinn. Whilst talking to Waller and Avesta, they conversed about the effects of SANCTUS and how they were going to find Harley Quinn. When Avesta suggested talking to Freeze, Bruce/Batman agreed to do so, despite Waller telling him not to. After she distracted the agent guarding the criminal, he took a bioscan of Freeze and asked about the Pact's plans with Project LOTUS. Freeze told Bruce/Batman about the curing properties of LOTUS and that the Pact had been planning to use them to cure their various problems, including Bane's addition to Venom and Nora's incurable disease. Revealing that Riddler had survived an infection with the virus, Freeze told Bruce/Batman about blood samples he had stored in the Pact's lair and asked for the temperature of the airlock to be lowered, to help combat his LOTUS infection. Bruce/Batman has the option to comply but leaves with Avesta to retrieve the samples.

   At Avesta's suggestion, he investigated as Bruce Wayne, believing that doing so would prevent Harley from doing something drastic. During the ride over, Avesta admitted to having been the one who had told Waller about his true identity, which Bruce can forgive her for.

   As they drove to the lair, Bruce learned about Harleen Quinzel's father and a hereditary mental illness which was present in his side of her family. Iman also shared her doubts about Waller, especially with her hiding information about the properties of LOTUS and giving up Riddler's body intentionally, and that she was considering leaving the organization.

   Upon arrival, they found the Pact's lair to be empty, though there were traces of someone being there. Whilst investigating, Bruce found a skeleton key, used by Agency operatives, leading him and Avesta to realize that they had been there. Further findings revealed that Riddler's blood had been taken, including from the body itself, and bombs that had been created some time ago. Using the evidence, Bruce realized that Waller was planning to use Project LOTUS to blackmail the Pact into working for the Agency, planning to offer the virus to them for their services. She had sent the team to ensure that Harley couldn't retrieve the samples and make her desperate to cooperate with the Agency. Upon hearing a noise from her office, Bruce and Iman went up to investigate, finding a drunk John at the desk.

   After waking him up, Bruce, believing he would know where Harley was, demanded to know where she had gone. After revealing she had been in the lair, John vented his frustrations towards Bruce, believing him to be responsible for Harley's betrayal and the others' capture.

   When he returned to the Batcave, Bruce found Alfred lying unconscious. After helping him wake up, he investigated the effects of the LOTUS virus and discovered that, despite it curing all known physical problems, it would cause severe damage to the brain's chemistry and lead to various psychological problems. Realizing that it only caused more harm than good, he sent his findings to Avesta and talked with Alfred about the care he needed to receive. Moments later, Iman contacted Bruce to tell him she had located Riddler's blood in the Agency's cold storage and her intentions to destroy it. After giving her advice, he helped Alfred back to the Manor and arranged to get a doctor to see him. Depending on whether Bruce told Tiffany about his activities as Batman, the following will happen.

Despite John's claims of self-defense, Bruce found some flaws in his testimony, including a number of gunshot victims despite him claiming that he had bludgeoned them to death with an object. Depending on whether Bruce is able to believe John's testimony, the two can either "get closer" or become more antagonistic towards each other. During the conversation, John also revealed that he knew Bruce was Batman and that he had been working within the Pact to dismantle it. As the conversation drew to a close, John revealed that Harley was planning an attack on the Gotham bridge to get the Agency to hand over Riddler's blood samples.

   Batman's character is up to the player. Depending on decisions made by the player, he can be pleasant, friendly, affable, humorous, and a much more traditional and inspiring hero as Batman compared to the other versions of the Dark Knight or a much more vengeful, rage, aggressive, arrogant, ruder, colder, crueller, and unempathetic character than how he's usually portrayed. Decisions made, such as saving Catwoman or Dent, can affect others and his reputation as Bruce Wayne or Batman.
