After the incident, he began to doubt his capabilities and began to ponder leaving the life to be with Chase. Visiting her later as Batman, he learned she'd fallen for Bruce instead. Recognising he'd been using Batman to fight against their greatest fear, Bruce finally decided to abandon the identity and lead a normal life. Unknown to him, however, Riddler and Two-Face learned his dual identity through the brainwaves they'd recorded through the Box.

   The following Halloween, Bruce called Chase to visit him at Wayne Manor to spend the evening together and reveal his identity.

In a panicked frenzy, Two-Face tried to grab all of them and lost his balance, causing him to fall to his death.

   After ensuring Nygma had forgotten his identity, Bruce decided to continue operating as Batman, with Dick's help as Robin. Giving Chase the dream doll she'd given him, he said his goodbyes to her and subsequently broke up. Rebuilding the Batcave, he developed new equipment and technology to use, including a new vehicle for Robin. Some time after the events of Claw Island, Bruce began dating
   Julie Madison

   her disease
   and his lab accident. Deciding to set a trap for Freeze and his men, he donate some of his family's diamonds to an auction to lure him into another heist.

   Attending the auction as honorary guests, Batman and Robin fell under the pheromonic control of Poison Ivy, who sought to steal the funds of Gotham's wealthiest to fund her schemes. Under her influence, they bid against each other to extravagant amounts of money. This finally ceased when Freeze attacked the auction and stole the diamond, forcing them to chase him. As Robin attempted a potentially dangerous stunt to chase after the criminal, Batman overrode
   the Redbird
   via remote controls to stop him from endangering his life. He then subdued Freeze himself, ensuring that he'd be taken to Arkham. Though he'd stopped the criminal, Bruce's actions shattered Dick's trust in him and, as a result, fractured their partnership.
