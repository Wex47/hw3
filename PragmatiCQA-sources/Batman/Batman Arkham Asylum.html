    Joker
   </a>
   , Batman's arch enemy, has instigated an elaborate plot from within
   Arkham Island
   , where many of Batman's other foes have been incarcerated. Batman investigates and comes to learn that the Joker is trying to create an army of Bane-like creatures to threaten Gotham City, and is forced to put a stop to the Joker's plans. Throughout the night, Batman is forced to deal with the temporarily admitted sane prisoners from
   Blackgate
   prison, Scarecrow, Zsasz, Poison Ivy, Bane, Killer Croc and Harley Quinn. By the night's end, all the villains, save Bane, Croc and Crane, are recaptured and placed back in their cells and what remains of the staff try putting the Asylum back in order. Though it is thanks to Batman that the criminally insane are brought back under control, administrator of Arkham, mayoral candidate
   Quincy Sharp
   , soon takes advantage and claims the credit himself for bringing the Arkham institution back under control.

   being escorted by
   Batman
   in the
   Batmobile
   to the asylum after being captured during an armed siege at Gotham City Hall.
  </p>
  <p key="fa62a3f5-f745-4414-b5d8-87a74cfe3475">
   The situation at city hall took place at exactly the same time as a 'mysterious fire' broke out at
   Blackgate Penitentiary
   , causing many of the prisoners to be sent to Arkham, among them a great number of Joker's own gang. When the two arrive at Arkham, Batman and several helmeted security guards strap the Joker to an up-right stretcher and wheel him down into the Intensive Treatment Center. Sensing something is wrong because Joker seemed to give up easier than usual, Batman accompanies the security personnel and the Joker to the Holding Cells, where the Arkham staff refuse to let Batman go any further.
  </p>
  <p key="727de71e-c780-4ede-9815-51e0a975cba7">
   As the Joker is being registered into the Cell Block by
   Commissioner Gordon
   , he breaks free from a guard and escapes from Batman with the help of
   Harley Quinn
   . Batman, who is locked out of the area, breaks into the holding cells through a glass window. Once Batman is inside the Holding Cells area, the Joker springs his first trap, unlocking the holding cells and allowing Blackgate convicts to flood out to attack Batman. After another brief confrontation with more convicts, the Joker deactivates a security gate, allowing Batman to follow in his direction, despite Commissioner Gordon's observation that it was most likely a trap.
  </p>
  <p key="319fd8ed-c8ba-4980-ade8-b0d759adab0b">
   Batman moves up a ramp in the direction of the Joker's escape, leaving the Holding Cells and entering the Processing Corridor, finding the hallway littered with fallen security guards the Joker left in his wake. He found one guard that had survived named
   Eddie Burlow
   , who points him to the Lower Corridor. Batman reaches the Patient Pacification Chamber, where two security guards inform him that escaped inmate
   Victor Zsasz
   has taken another guard,
   Mike
   hostage and will kill him if he sees anyone get close to him. Batman subsequently subdues Zsasz after swooping down from a gargoyle behind the psychotic killer
  </p>
  <p key="15aad645-7438-43d5-a9ba-97e51f226e0b">
   All of a sudden, Batman receives a message from Harley Quinn, who has taken
   Quincy Sharp
   , the warden, hostage. Batman offers a single chance to surrender peacefully, but Harley refuses it and activates the security locks. Although Quinn is convinced Batman is trapped in Patient Pacification, Batman escapes back to the Processing Corridor via an air duct, heading into the Decontamination area, where several Arkham personnel and inmates were trapped in a room filling with Joker Toxin. After clearing the room of toxins, Batman proceeds from the Decontamination area and follows several green arrows along the floor of the Transfer Loop, following the Joker to the Secure Treatment Transfer room
  </p>
  <p key="98d8390a-898d-4516-99b7-d4e7d44b4a6b">
   Batman is attacked by a
   mutated Blackgate prisoner
   . After a short battle, the prisoner collapses from heart failure. Feeling generous, Joker offers Batman a free shot to knock him into the abyss below the mobile security cell to stop his madness. Batman preps a batarang, but decides against it. Laughing at Batman, Joker escapes on top of a mobile security cell to Extreme Isolation; he broadcasts a message to Batman from a nearby guard station telling him that
   Frank Boles
   , a member of the security team assigned with escorting Joker to his cell, is actually on his side and has captured Gordon. The Joker also warns that if Batman is caught following him, then Gordon will die.
  </p>
  <p key="125fa0ff-4b3c-4097-9e9d-7d4ae586a0fc">
   Using a scanner in his cowl, Batman follows an alcoholic vapor trail left by Boles' bourbon through the Transfer Loop. As he nears the elevator to the upper level with security guard
   Henry Smith
   , Harley Quinn appears and blows up the elevator cable, hoping to trap Batman on the lower level, but he manages to scale the surrounding support structures. After a brief encounter with several pipe-wielding convicts, Batman approaches the Cell Block Transfer section, where he encounters the first goons carrying firearms, who have overwhelmed the security guards and taken control.
  </p>
  <p key="34b8db61-4bfd-4e37-bc24-cbcd89c2daed">
   He circumvents these armed henchmen and takes them down by stealth, before moving on to the entrance hall, where several armed convicts are patrolling the Intensive Treatment Lobby, armed with riot guns. After defeating them, he proceeds to the far side of the room and up the ladder to the raised hallway, at the end of which the Dark Knight finds Frank Boles dead, strapped to a stretcher near the exit of Intensive Treatment, having been double-crossed by the Joker (who may have simply done it for amusement/out of boredom or for the hell of it), thus ending the trail Batman followed.
  </p>
  <p key="037aacb8-e98f-47a7-ad30-4624739e2425">
   Simultaneously, the
   Riddler
   intercepts Batman's transmission system which he uses to contact
   Oracle
   , and begins tasking him with riddles which he can solve across the island.
  </p>
  <p key="1d4a633d-ca0c-4237-942f-bab49469ad96">
   After solving the first of the Riddler's puzzles, Batman is approached by William North, an Arkham guard, who unlocks the door to the Utility Corridor for him.
  </p>
  <p key="b64ece1b-4b67-40a8-aa93-bf1107327692">
   Walking through the guards' locker room, Batman overhears Jack Rhyder's broadcast announcing that Joker has threatened to set off bombs across Gotham if any law enforcement is seen approaching Arkham Asylum. However, knowing Joker well, Batman suspects that the bombs are nothing but empty threats to keep the city busy. He contacts Oracle, instructing her to investigate the bombs while he tries to subdue Joker and the other inmates.

  <p key="fcaf7152-6dc8-4ee7-a923-743c4b649be7">
   Batman leaves Intensive Treatment, finding his way to Arkham East, where he discovers that the Batmobile is being attacked by Harley Quinn's henchmen. Fearing Gordon might be hurt, Batman instructs Oracle to deactivate the automatic defenses and decides to head for the northern part of the island, where it is parked. In the heavily-guarded Arkham East, Batman finds that many of the asylum's security guards had been lured to the area by a blind. Batman moves to a small connecting tunnel in between Arkham East and North.
  </p>
  <p key="ff71ae67-b7d4-41b9-8279-29cb24035df1">
   As Batman enters the smaller area, he discovers a wrecked ambulance and a security guard taking cover behind it. The guard informs Batman of the armed Blackgate Convicts on the other side, and Batman defeats the thugs, after which he rushes to where the Batmobile is parked and Harley Quinn's thugs are trashing it. He quickly defeats the henchmen and follows a trail of pipe tobacco, left for him by Gordon, to the western section of the island, where Joker's men have also managed to take control. He also arms himself with Explosive Gel kept in the Batmobile's trunk.
  </p>
  <p key="ba974aad-7ed4-49cb-ae3c-1920e98cf7cb">
   After defeating two of the Joker's men attempting to make renovations to the Visitor's Center to better suit the villain's taste, Batman finds a nervous guard attempting to hide in a watchtower, who informs him that the escaped convicts have seized the Medical Facility as well.
  </p>

   Entering the Medical Facility, he encounters Harley and Gordon, but cannot reach them due to one of the security fields, thus forcing him to find a different point of entry through the Maintenance Access on the roof. He then uses the ventilation system to gain access to the Sanatorium. Batman then defeats five gun-wielding Blackgate prisoners who are holding Dr.
   Sarah Cassidy
   and three other doctors hostage. On his way through the facility, Batman rescues several more doctors and staff, including
   Dr. Penelope Young
   , in whom the Joker's henchmen showed a particular interest. In the Patient Observation area, Batman encounters security guard
   Aaron Cash
   and Doctor Kellerman trapped by a trio of Blackgate convicts in a control room filling with toxic gas. After filtering the gas out of the room via ventilation fans, Batman heads to the Surgery Area, where he rescues Doctor Chen from a large number of The Joker's thugs. He proceeds back to the Sanatorium, pausing only briefly to halt a
   violent inmate armed with knives
   . Back at the Sanatorium, Dr. Young insists on securing her research notes and is escorted back to the Arkham Mansion by Cash, while Batman follows Gordon's abductors down to the Morgue level in an elevator.
  </p>
  <p key="b05cf38a-50f2-425a-929a-3b5993fbd929">
   Upon entering the lower level, Batman catches a glimpse of the
   Scarecrow
   and several unfortunate victims of his fear gas trapped in an operating room. Soon he is affected by the gas himself, first subtly then in increasingly surreal ways. He finds Gordon's dead body in an empty hallway and has a chilling encounter in the morgue with reanimated corpses of his parents. The Dark Knight finds himself in a nightmarish dreamscape set in the crumbling ruins of Arkham Asylum, controlled by a gigantic, monstrous Scarecrow, whose fiery gaze he must evade, until he can defeat him with a symbolic bat-signal.
  </p>
  <p key="c276b11c-f918-4169-9ed7-a290f6825ac2">
   Shaking off the effects of the fear gas, Batman awakes inside the Morgue. Batman leaves the Morgue and finds Scarecrow's gas had him believe something that wasn't real, finding a fallen security guard where he had seemingly found Gordon's corpse earlier. Batman realizes that Gordon is still alive and follows a trail left for him by the Joker to the scene of a vicious little game set up for him. Harley is guarding Gordon, and Joker challenges Batman to make it undetected past four of his henchmen patrolling the room; if he is spotted Harley will execute Gordon instantly. Once Batman succeeds, the Joker directs his attention to a surprise left for him in a previously locked chamber in the middle of the room.

Bane says the "Bruja" drained his Venom. Since Bane is talking too much about his plans, Joker triggers the pump, replacing Bane's venom, which enables him to break free and attack Batman, hurling him through a wall and into the Boiler Room. After a fierce battle, Batman flees the Boiler Room by means of his grappling gun as the ceiling, weakened by the fight collapses on Bane, burying him under a pile of rubble. Batman meets with Gordon, but before they can speak, Bane breaks through the wall and grabs Batman. Though Bane says he'll break Batman, the Dark Knight corrects him, "No, Bane. This time, I break you!" The Batmobile is remotely summoned to the scene, ramming directly into Bane and knocking him into the murky waters of the Gotham Bay.

He discovers the Joker has seized the tunnels of the Old Sewer, and has posted several Blackgate convicts there to prevent him from proceeding. After defeating them, Batman enters the Main Sewer Junction, a massive, crumbling, chamber, a maze of decrepit columns, archways, and platforms. Oracle radios, explaining that she went through Dr. Young's e-mails, finding that a Jack White had been supplying her with funding for her Titan research; Batman realises Joker was the one who was funding the project as it's one of his oldest aliases. Young eventually found out who was paying her, and put a block on her account. Joker sent threatening emails to Young, who was prepared to resign from Arkham to get away from the high probability of seeing him again. He emerges from the Main Sewer Junction in the Surface Access area, which provides an unused exit to Arkham North. Here, Batman finds that the Joker's men had gotten their hands on sniper rifles stolen from the guard armory. After being forced to deal with several of the armed convicts, Batman enters Arkham East, only to find that the Joker had taken over this part of the island as well. Armed prisoners now guard the watch towers after having shot the security guards.

Joker is shocked nothing has happened, rhetorically asking if he should give her another injection.

While Ivy laughs maniacally, rumbling comes all around Batman and once outside, he sees that Titan is having a different effect on her.

   Some Arkham staff members who survive the initial mayhem of the Joker's escape also assist Batman, including guards, orderlies, and psychiatrists. Nevertheless, a number of the staff are depicted as openly immoral or corrupt; for example, Penelope Young and security officer

    Batman: Arkham Asylum
   </i>
   is set wholly on the grounds of the
   Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane
   , better known as Arkham Asylum. The asylum is located on a remote island in the Gotham Bay, a strategic necessity given its reputation for housing violent, incurable psychotics. This depiction of Arkham portrays the facility as a sprawling, multi-faceted campus with both new and old structures, including a medical building for low-risk patients, surgical procedures, and pharmaceutical purposes, a penitentiary cell block for the general inmate population, a large factory re-purposed into an intensive care unit for high-risk patients, a series of indoor botanical gardens, and a vast subterranean network. The iconic Victorian mansion normally associated with Arkham in Batman comic books also makes an appearance as the main administration block.

    Combat
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="f700ee2c-e2e0-4ac8-a6fa-ea8a8dc93e72">
   Conflicts between Batman and opponents take place in two different styles, depending on the situation: either straight combat or the stealthy "Predator" style.
  </p>
  <p key="bfc02af5-1997-4f84-88d5-ad4a9f332658">
   The unique combat system does not feature specific moves tied to specific buttons of the controller, but focuses instead on keeping up a perfect rhythm of blocks and attacks, which Batman executes in whichever style is appropriate for the situation, making his fighting style very realistic and extremely fluid, adapting to whichever situation presents around him. As a string of blocks and attacks is kept up, a "Combo Counter" keeps track of the length of the current string, increasing both the strength of Batman's attacks and the XP earned. The only controls necessary for combat are "Attack", "Block", "Evade", and "Cape Stun". As the game progresses, additional special moves - such as an unblockable throw maneuver - can be bought with XP, which can be executed once the Combo Counter reaches a certain level (initially 8, can later be reduced to 5).
  </p>
  <p key="c6fddc9a-a611-44c6-b80e-f91f44721af9">
   Two of Batman's gadgets can also be used in combat, namely the batarang and the batclaw (once it has been collected). These have special buttons to deploy them quickly in combat, rather than the usual way.
  </p>
  <p key="7bf7e8f4-9885-4782-875d-679f2a7d6aef">
   Certain opponents wield knives or stun batons and cannot be attacked directly or blocked. Their attacks must be evaded instead, and they can be attacked only when stunned (knife wielders) or from behind (shock baton wielders). Enemies armed with lead pipes can block attacks, but their own weapons can be taken from and used against them.
  </p>
  <p key="130413e2-a586-425c-8996-d50070307f5e">
   Opponents enhanced with the Titan drug require special tactics. Their attacks must be evaded, and they can only be safely attacked when stunned. When they execute their charging maneuver, a quick batarang will cause them to stampede blindly into walls, stunning them, leaving them open to attack. When a series of attacks has brought a Titan temporarily down to his knees, Batman can jump on his back and steer the stumbling, flailing Titan into hitting other opponents in the area, until he is shaken off. Conflicts with groups of gun-wielding goons require the stealthy "Predator" approach, where Batman silently takes out goons one by one without being detected. It is advisable to play these encounters in "Detective Mode", which allows Batman to see the position and status of all opponents, even when they are hidden by walls. Special moves such as "Silent Takedown", "Ledge Pull", "Glide Kick", "Corner Cover" and "Inverted Takedown" (must be bought with XP first) are best employed in this style of combat.
  </p>
  <p key="30e5dfdf-acff-4517-b6e6-77c896952b0e">
   Conflicts of this type usually take place in high-ceilinged rooms featuring many interior gargoyles that allow Batman to strike from above and fly back up into the shadows when spotted.
  </p>
  <p key="da6eae7f-451d-48a4-8282-bed09df0fd64">
   Certain gadgets and their buyable upgrades are well suited to the Predator style. The "Sonic Batarang" can interact with the alarm collars of goons to either attract or disable them. The explosive gel can be used to set traps that are detonated either by remote control or automatically.

   The developers have come up with a CSI style for forensic puzzles because Batman is the "World's Greatest Detective". Detective Mode is the centerpiece in Batman's arsenal. His cowl can highlight certain points of interest and much like the Metroid Prime games will scan items into your database. One of Batman's new tools is Explosive Gel that you apply to weak walls highlighted by detective vision so they crash down making ways for you to escape and sneak in or even knock out the person on the other side.

There are several distinct types of challenges:

    Joker Teeth. The Joker has scattered a lot of "chattering teeth" toys, often in groups of two or three. To fulfill the challenge, a certain number of teeth (5, 10, 20) must be destroyed.

    Perspective riddles. Two halves of a question mark have been painted on the scenery (only visible in Detective Mode). When viewed from the right perspective, they line up to form a whole question mark, which can be scanned to solve the riddle.

   Some of the items are initially inaccessible and can only be accessed after Batman has collected a specific gadget. Since this requires revisiting locations when the actual plot of the game does not require it, the game allows the player to continue exploring the island, even after the reaching the end, in order to achieve 100% completion.

   As Batman continues to solve his riddles and collect the items, Riddler initially taunts him with the "slowness" of his progress, but becomes increasingly agitated, as the amount of solved riddles rises. He accuses Batman of cheating, possibly by looking up the riddles on the internet, a brief moment of a broken fourth wall since you can indeed look the answers up on the internet. Once enough riddles have been solved, Batman manages to deduce Riddler's current location and transmits it to the Gotham Police.

   The Collector's Edition Batarang Box Set was released by GameStop and Wal-Mart. The package features a 14-inch (36Â cm) Batarang, a 50-page character journal, a bonus disc that includes interviews with the voice actors, and the Crime Alley challenge map. The Wal-Mart regular and Collector's Edition's of the game came with a code for an armored Batsuit for use only in the challenge maps. Additionally, a pre-order challenge map from GameStop was announced called Scarecrow Nightmare. It places Batman under the influence of Scarecrow's fear toxin, causing him to hallucinate and all the enemies to be seen as skeletons. Both codes are included in their respective editions. A Game of the Year Edition was released on March 26, 2010 in Europe, Australia and Japan and in North America on May 11, 2010. The updated edition features all of the original game, the extra challenge maps Totally Insane, Nocturnal Hunter, Crime Alley, Scarecrow Nightmare, and the ability to play the game in 3D on any regular 2D television using TriOviz stereoscopy glasses.
