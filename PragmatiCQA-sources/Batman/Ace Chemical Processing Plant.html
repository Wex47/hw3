   . Red Hood attempted to escape through the ACE Chemical Plant and jumped into a vat of chemicals in order to escape and swam away from the vigilante through the use of a breathing device hidden within his signature cowl. After finally having made his escaping and taking refuge in the Playing Card factory, Red Hood noticed that the chemicals had bleached his skin bone-white, dyed his hair green and colored his lips red. Noticing his similarities to the figure on Monarch's Joker playing cards, Red Hood declared himself "The Joker" and used his new appearance for a new life of crime.

   According to a memory of the Joker which may or may not be true, before he was a super-criminal he was an employee at the Ace Chemical Processing Plant where he was a minor engineer with a mind for chemistry. He eventually quit his job to try and become a stand-up comedian only to fail miserably than later learn his wife
   Jeannie
   was pregnant which would send them into greater financial problems than they already were in. Desperate, he made a deal with gangsters in which he would help them rob his old workplace of ACE Chemicals in exchange for money. The gangsters gave him a red cowl made of one-way glass and a red cape, informing him that he'd be wearing both to disguise himself as "The Red Hood" a criminal alias which the gangsters used as a red herring to make the police (and Batman) focus on him while they were merely treated as accomplices. Not long before the robbery the engineer's wife and unborn child both died in a freak electrical accident when Jeannie tested out a defective electric baby-bottle heater. Forced to still go through with the crime, things turned sour when it was revealed the police and Batman ambushed them with the gangsters being shot down by police as the Red Hood was chased down by Batman who believed him to be a super-villain. Attempting to convince Batman he was simply a decoy, Red Hood attempted to remove the helm but tripped on his own cape and fell over edge of a cat-walk into a vat of chemicals where he was presumed deceased. In reality he was washed up in a chemical river and found himself with bleached white skin, dyed green hair and red-tinted lips. Finally being pushed off of the edge, the Red Hood became the Joker.

   One night an insane super-villain known as the Red Hood attempted to use several chemicals and explosives to turn the entire ACE Chemicals Plant into a giant bomb with the help of his gang, the
   Red Hood Gang
   which was made up mostly of individuals black-mailed by the Red Hood. Red Hood was found out by the vigilante known as Batman who had only made a few appearances in Gotham prior to then but who had fought the Red Hood on countless occasions. Batman managed to prevent the plant from exploding but it was set aflame in the process, Red Hood attempted to escape via helacopter but Batman pulled him down to fight him hand-to-hand. Ultimately the fight ended with the cat-walk the two were fighting on being destroyed by a chemical blast from the over-heated chemical vat below. Red Hood was hanging off the edge of the cat-walk while Batman was securely on-top trying to save his enemy. Red Hood laughed at Batman's nobility and willingly let go, falling into the flaming vat of acid while smiling maniacally. Due to the acid having been lethal and boiling-hot Red Hood should have been killed by the fall and was presumed dead but his body was never found. The police had a suspicion from interrogations of Red Hood Gang members that the criminal's identity was a thug from the
   narrows
   named Liam Distal but Distal's body was found shortly after outside of Amusement Mile, dissolved in Lye so that the time and cause of death would be impossible to discover, presumably having been killed by the real Red Hood.
