   Lucius Fox had been working for Wayne Enterprises for years before Batman's operations in Gotham, having become the head of Research and Development by the time Bruce Wayne became CEO. Alfred Pennyworth claims that Lucius had been present in Bruce's life before he became the vigilante, having helped raise Bruce in addition to working on his tech.
  </p>
  <p key="906184e4-5e2c-44d6-93d9-6cdd5c08fbcb">
   At some point, he became aware that his boss was the vigilante known as the Batman, having either deduced it himself or been told personally by Bruce. He agreed to help him in his endeavors, hoping to help make the city safer for his children Luke and
   Tiffany
   . Lucius designed and supplied the vigilante with many various gadgets and equipment, including the Batsuit, Batcomputer and the Batmobile. To hide these exploits, he and Bruce created a secret laboratory underneath Wayne Tower, where the two could work on the technology without arousing suspicion. Due to his work on the Bat-Tech, Lucius was unable to spend time with his family, particularly his children.

   After his drones were destroyed by
   Roland Desmond
   , Lucius created and deployed a new Bat-Drone to help Batman in the field. When contacted by the vigilante, he told him of the new features he had installed and how they might be useful to him in the field. He was later contacted by Batman, who had collected a data chip from a
   Children of Arkham
   member's radio, asking him to analyze it and find out how it could listen to the Police Radio. Lucius agreed to and arranged to meet Bruce Wayne the next morning.
  </p>
  <p key="a1ed556a-c011-406b-b510-d7aac6c07d29">
   When Bruce arrived, Lucius spied on him and
   Regina Zellerbach
   as the two discussed a meeting between the board to decide on what should happen to him. They discussed the possibility that Bruce may be forced to loose most of his technical support and access to the Wayne Enterprises R&amp;D, which could knock onto Batman's activities. Lucius also revealed that he had found out how the Children of Arkham gained access to the GCPD's coms throdeugh a backdoor he created in the system to help Batman and prepared a patch for the Batcomputer to make it less susceptible to these compromises. He also provided Bruce with a number of new gadgets he had prepared, including a new cowl with infra-red vision and a new form of sticky bomb. When Bruce left to meet with Regina, Lucius handed a drive containing the patch to him.

   After learning that Bruce had been asked to leave Wayne Enterprises, Lucius met up with him to discuss what might happen and whether Wayne Enterprises were aware that they had hired a known criminal and member of the Children of Arkham,
   Oswald Cobblepot
   , as their new CEO. Lucius also pondered whether to stay at the company and keep an eye on the R&amp;D department to make sure Cobblepot did not access and use its gadgets for Children of Arkham activities or to leave and work for Bruce, continuing to help Batman in the field. Regardless of the choice Bruce makes, Lucius swore to help Bruce in his endeavors.

He is contacted by Bruce after his Bat-Stunner malfunctions in the field and is unable to disable one of the Children of Arkham's new drones. Realizing that he had not kept a close enough eye on Cobblepot, Lucius apologizes to Bruce and looks into the issue, promising to contact him once he has found what has been causing the tech malfunctions.
He later calls to tell him that Cobblepot installed a Black Box on the Wayne Enterprises network and that it would hack the Batcomputer if not dealt with immediately. However, at the same time, Wayne Manor is being seized by

Arranging to meet that morning in Wayne Enterprises, Lucius also revealed that Tiffany would be starting her career at the company. Lucius met Bruce in his office, but the two are unable to figure out how to solve the next part of the riddle; a radio wave emitter that could be modulated. During this, Tiffany came into the office to greet them, having slipped out of orientation. She showed interest in the Riddler's puzzle box and offers to help. After she left, Lucius asked Bruce to bring her into the fold and let her help him as Batman. As they went to his office to investigate the puzzle box, they met Agents
   Avesta

Lucius' death was also used by Riddler to mock Batman, having figured out that the vigilante had worked closely with him. This was also revealed to Commissioner
