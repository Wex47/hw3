    Theodore
   </span>
   and
   Esther Cobblepot
   . His family was once a large influence on Gotham, owning a large portion of the city's land and building
   a park for the city's public
   . At a young age, Oswald became friends with
   Bruce Wayne
   . According to
   Alfred Pennyworth
   , the two were "as thick as thieves", though Oswald would take this quite literally in later life.
  </p>
  <p key="ddea079d-fa4e-4e87-9e37-f07c3298c0e0">
   Whilst Oswald was still a child, the Cobblepot family lost their fortune to events set in motion by
   Thomas Wayne
   ,
   Carmine Falcone
   and
   Hamilton Hill
   . Whilst running for mayor, Theodore apparently committed suicide before the election could be held. Furthermore, his mother was forcefully committed to
   Arkham Asylum
   and gaslighted with a

   by Wayne to gain ownership of their land. Due to his mother's perceived mental illness, Oswald would often be bullied by other children, but would be protected by Bruce.
  </p>
  <p key="b5e99a12-858f-4013-9433-f24a7b3fb8fe">
   At some point after his family's fall from grace, Oswald moved to England to attend boarding school. After finishing education, he joined the military, though was dishonorably discharged. Cobblepot went on to establish himself as a professional criminal in England's underworld, making a number of illegitimate enterprises including illegal boxing matches, arms dealing and fencing. Adopting the alias "Penguin", he would disguise himself with bird-like gas mask to avoid identification. Despite these measure, Oswald was arrested many times, once by the Essex Police Department, and served a number of prison sentences.
  </p>
  <p key="2e3e560e-4e85-412d-a95a-48d5b9394b1d">
   At some point, Oswald returned to Gotham for unspecified reasons, possibly in the hopes to take revenge on Falcone, Hill and the Wayne family (despite Thomas being dead). He joined the group known as the
   Children of Arkham
   , though it is currently unknown whether he joined before returning to the city. To obtain evidence of their dealings, Penguin made contact with  Hill and blackmailed him into compiling information about the trio's dealings. Unknown to Hill, Cobblepot planned to betray and kill him once he had released this information. Through his connection, Penguin anonymously hired famed cat-burglar
   Catwoman
   to steal the information from Hill and help locate the psychogenic chemical used on his mother.

   A short time before he arrived, Oswald sent Bruce a text saying that he'd be a couple of minutes late. Upon arrival, he discovered Wayne being set on by two muggers, who he brutally attacked and forced to flee. After this, they caught up, talking about how their families' legacies had changed over the twenty years. During it, Oswald warned Bruce about a "revolution" he was planning. Having drawn to a close, Oswald left to organize the revolution, bidding Bruce goodbye. It is unconfirmed whether he was involved in the Children of Arkham's raid of

   During the Gotham City Mayoral Debate, Penguin lead the Children of Arkham to attack and subdue hostages. During it, he murdered the moderator and "forced" Vicki Vale to host it in his place. After they were drugged with their psychoactive chemical, Penguin and his men showed video evidence of Hill and Thomas Wayne gaslighting his mother and committing her to Arkham Asylum. As the GCPD tried to storm the debate, Penguin took Vale "hostage" as Batman appeared to apprehend him. When she attacked him and fled, he fired at her, though was prevented from killing her by Batman.

   Ordering Blockbuster to fight Batman, Penguin turned his attention to Hill. Despite Hill's protests to spare him, Oswald gunned him down and attacked Dent when he attempted to intervene. After Batman defeated Desmond and Catwoman arrived to confront him, Penguin took Dent hostage and shot at the duo to drive them off, injuring Catwoman. Grabbing a stage light, Penguin attempted to attack Dent with it, though Batman has the option of intervene or save Catwoman from a group of Children of Arkham members.

   During the time between the debate and Dent taking the role as Mayor, Oswald managed to infiltrate Wayne Enterprises, being hired into the board. Using ties he had, Oswald managed to create a false backstory about his business experience and covered up his criminal dealings. This managed to convince the Wayne Enterprises board to hire him as a replacement CEO instead of Bruce, as they wished to sever ties to his family.

   Having discovered a backdoor into Wayne Enterprises' telecommunications network, Oswald helped the Children of Arkham break into the network and monitor the entire city's communications. Once implemented, the Children of Arkham were able to listen in to police communications, allowing them to prepare for attacks or investigations. However, this was discovered by Batman and rectified by

   After Bruce was committed to Arkham by the now insane Mayor Dent, Oswald took full control of Wayne Enterprises. Using the position, he used his position to gain security intel on the Children of Arkham's intended targets and company funds to arm their members. He also undertook several personal ventures, including buying multiple yachts and attempting to purchase an island. Penguin also connected a Black Box to the Wayne Enterprises network, planning to use it to break into Arkham Asylum and override the security systems. He also used the R&amp;D department to gain access to various prototype weapons and gadgets, including armored drones and an eyepiece interface for them.

However, it was denied by the judge after it was proven he was actively involved in Lady Arkham's plans. Penguin would have to wait five more years for another parole hearing. An image of a clearly angered Oswald can be seen, implying that his good behavior at Blackgate was simply a ruse to reduce his sentence.

To cover this, Oswald would put on a calm demeanor during meetings with others over his clearance, as he did with Regina Zellerbach and something he continued to use after being defeated by Batman.
