   , a former network executive who had organized Greenway Productions, also called Greenlawn Productions, into existence, was asked whether he would produce the series. Never before having read comic books, he formed the idea, when he did read the Batman comics, to produce the series as a lampoon, villain-driven and heavy on action comedy.

   Premiering on January 12, 1966, as a mid-season replacement, the series featured actor
   Adam West
   as the perennial character of Batman, while
   Burt Ward

Living alongside them in the vast mansion was doddering old Aunt Harriet Cooper, based upon a minor character in the comics who had been added to give the Bat-Duo reason to be secretive about their dual identities, and their mild-mannered butler and majordomo, Alfred. Alfred was the only other person to know Batman and Robin's secret identities. Aunt Harriet could not be allowed that knowledge for two reasons; first, for Bruce and Dick to have been able to lounge around in their Batcostumes would have been at least marginally undercutting to the drama; and second, knowing the Bat-Duo's identities might have caused her more danger than they wanted her to have to face. (Dozier, however, told Eisner--based upon his own incorrect recollections--that the Aunt Harriet character had been added to prevent Bruce and Dick from looking like they were gay in those unfortunately homophobic days and, thereby, to defuse the accusations that Frederic Wertham had made in

   One major difference about the heroes compared between television and other media, the Batman and Robin of the TV series (and the adapted 1966 film) were fully deputized law enforcement officers, a point emphasized on more than one occasion by Commissioner Gordon, whereas in the comics and later films they were viewed (by police and the public at large) as vigilantes.

   Unlike the earlier movie serials of the 1940s, this was the first Batman project to feature Batman's rogues gallery of villains. Cesar Romero made numerous appearances as the Joker, while Burgess Meredith reinvented the image of the Penguin, with his crooked smile and trademark "Squawk". Julie Newmar provided Catwoman's rolling "R"s, only to be replaced later by Lee Meriwether for the 1966 movie, and again in the final season by Eartha Kitt. Two men provided their talents to the role of the Riddler - Frank Gorshin (in the first and third seasons) and John Astin (in a one-off second-season appearance).

   In addition to the fantastic sets and costumes, the series also featured a number of James Bond-inspired gadget-filled vehicles: Batmobile (which had originated in the comics), Batcycle, Batboat, and the Batcopter. The Batmobile donor car was a 1955 Lincoln Futura that George Barris customized in only three weeks. Two Batcycles appeared on the show; the first was a barely modified Harley Davidson, and the second was a highly modified Yamaha. The Batboat was built by Glastron. Some of the specialty vehicles - in particular the Batboat and Batcopter - were constructed under the budget for the 1966 film.

   During its first two seasons, the series aired twice a week, with each week featuring a two-part story, with the exception of a one-off three-part Penguin story that aired midway through season 2. As a result, season 1 aired for 34 episodes, while season 2 aired for a massive 60 episodes, at a time when most US prime-time series only aired 25 or so episodes a season. In season 3 the series was scaled back to once a week and the show began mixing up the formula by airing a mixture of single-episode, two-part and three-part storylines. Only 20 episodes were made that year.

Although Batgirl was a popular character, her presence could not save the series, and it was canceled in 1968.

   The series spun-off a motion picture in 1966 featuring most of the TV cast. After its cancellation, West and Ward continued to portray Batman and Robin in voice only for several Saturday morning-cartoon versions of Batman, and appeared on screen once more as the Dynamic Duo in the two-part comedy special "Legends of the Superheroes" which aired in 1979 and also featured Frank Gorshin returning as the Riddler.

   a tongue-in-cheek film in which West and Ward, appearing as themselves, reminisced about making the TV series. Based upon the two actors's memoirs, the film featured recreations of various scenes and behind-the-scenes events from filming. Jack Brewer plays young Adam West, Jason Marsden assails the role of young Burt Ward, and Julie Rose plays young Julie Newmar, among other. The film is notable for allowing Frank Gorshin to film a scene on a recreated Batcave set - he was one of the only recurring rogue's gallery actors never to get the chance on TV - and is the only Batman production to feature both Julie Newmar and Lee Meriwether, though due to licensing issues related to the TV series (see Home Video Release, below), the producers were only allowed to use footage from the 1966 Batman movie with Meriwether when scenes from the original series were needed, although the makers were allowed to also feature Waggoner's screen test footage, as well.

   ". The episode "The Color of Revenge!" begins with a flashback to the time of the 1960s television series, using attributes such as the red Batphone, the Shakespeare bust, the sliding bookcase, the Batpoles, Robin in his old television-series costume, and the shot of Batman and Robin fastening their seat belts in the Batmobile. Additionally, the Adam West Batman briefly appears in "Night of the Batmen!" as part of an army of Batmen gathered across the Multiverse.

(from the television series' first season) and "Holy flypaper, Batman!" (from the television series' second season). During the movie, Robin says "Holy rusted metal, Batman!" after the duo climb onto twisted metal girders beside some water. This catchphrase also appeared for a time in "Batman" comic books.

    After the show was canceled by ABC in 1968, the producers thought they could bring it to another network. Yvonne Craig said this in an interview:
    <i key="6b35c403-7caa-410f-93e3-6957dabb779e">
     "When we were cancelled by ABC, they wondered if we could get on another network. When it looked like we couldn't, they came with a bulldozer and bulldozed the whole set--The Batcave and all of that. Then, two weeks later, NBC said, 'Listen, we'd like to take a shot at Batman, if you still have the set.' They didn't want to start from scratch and build them because the set cost $800,000. So it was too late and nothing came of it."

    The delay doomed new episodes of the television show, but by 1969 stations were showing reruns of the television episodes, and continue to do so as of 2021.

    In 2006, Deborah Dozier Potter, the daughter of
    William Dozier
    and "the successor-in-interest to Greenway Productions," sued Fox for allegedly withholding money from royalties under the Fox/ABC agreement. Dozier Potter further claimed that this came to her attention when, in March of 2005, "she considered releasing the series on DVD," implying that (from her perspective at least) Greenway/Dozier Potter had some say in the matter of potential DVD release of the series. The case was resolved/dismissed in November of 2007. It was not till 2014 that Conan O'Brien posted on his Twitter account that Warner Brothers would release an official DVD box set of the complete series sometime in 2014; Warner Brothers, owners of the Batman copyright through their DC Comics unit, later confirmed this post.

    Even though George Barris built four Batmobiles, and later acquired a fifth that was built by a fan, there is only one occurrence during the entire series where a replica was used instead of the original #1 car, during a Mad Hatter episode, when the #4 dragster replica was used in the background in the Batcave while the #1 car was being repaired.

    when Batman is fighting off a group of thugs, one of them may say: "Badabadadadada, BATMAN!" This was a clear reference to the famous theme song of the series.

    also has many references to the 60's series. At one point, before a big action scene, Batman lampshades the battle sound effects by saying, "We're gonna hit these bad guys so hard, words describing the impact will spontaneously explode from our fists." The Batmobile's horn is also the series's theme music, composed by Neal Hefti.

   Due to complex licensing and ownership issues, the 1966-1968 Batman series was withheld from home video release for decades, missing the VHS videotape and laserdisc eras completely. With the advent of DVD in the late 1990s, and subsequent popularity of classic TV shows being released in that format, many fans called for Batman to be released. However, for years the rights issues were seen as insurmountable, with one site, the TV Guide-affiliated TV Shows on DVD.com, several times declaring that a home video release of Batman would be impossible in North America. No international release occurred either (unlike similar series with licensing issues such as The Six Million Dollar Man), suggesting the rights issues spread beyond the US. Among the issues cited was the fact Warner Bros. took ownership of the Batman characters when it bought DC Comic in the 1970s, but the TV series was produced and owned by 20th Century Fox, and also the issue of royalties regarding the dozens of celebrities who guest-starred or made cameo appearances.

  <p key="d931d7fd-afd5-4e29-9ce7-28689630cbbf">
   As a result, for years, only the 1966 Batman film represented the TV series on VHS, laserdisc, DVD and, later, Blu-ray formats. In the 2000s, a two-DVD set called Holy Batmania was released featuring archival interview footage, rare promotional items, and also never-before-released screen test footage from pre-production of the series. In the late 2000s, Adam West also released a special DVD in which he discussed each episode of the series. Bootleg DVD versions of the series itself, featuring episodes recorded off TV broadcasts and of wildly varying quality, became common place at science fiction conventions.

   was also released on DVD, though as noted above the film was only able to utilize 1966 movie footage (including a sequence paying tribute to Julie Newmar's Catwoman that only features footage of Lee Meriwether).

  <p key="77e51bbe-4121-4e8c-84f6-30f3ce9d47fa">
   Finally, in 2013 it was announced that the longstanding rights issues had been resolved, clearing the way for Batman to be released on home video. On November 11, 2014, the series was finally released (in various different editions) in both DVD and Blu-ray formats. Although it had been thought that the contents of Holy Batmania and Adam West's private release would be incorporated as special features in the set, ultimately a new collection of special features was compiled (see Videos, below, for excerpts). Among the permutations released was a Complete Series box set that included a toy Batmobile, a book of photographs selected by Adam West, an episode guide book, and a reproduction set of trading cards from the 1960s. The seasons are also to be released separately on DVD, though as of November 2014 Blu-ray release for now is expected to remain limited.
