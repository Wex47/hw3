   Having witnessed his parents' death at the hands of

   as a child, Bruce traveled the world as an adult to train and understand the criminal mind in order to combat it. Mentored by
   Ra's al Ghul
   , Bruce later returned to Gotham and challenged the city's crime lords, employing unusual weapons and tactics as a mysterious black-garbed crusader. Despite being considered an outlaw by the
   GCPD
   , Batman defeated
   Carmine Falcone
   and
   The Scarecrow
   , and later battled against Ra's al Ghul and his plan to have Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

   " Dent resulted in Batman going into hiding and taking the fall for Two-Face's crimes in order to maintain Dent's status as Gotham's "White Knight". As a result, Batman became a fugitive and Bruce turned into a recluse, not just as Batman but he also ended contact with associates such as Lucius Fox.

   Bruce Wayne is a brooding, troubled man, but he is also extremely brave and willing to put his life on the line to defend the lives of others. His sense of justice prevents him from killing criminals, though he clearly grapples with this belief as it often leads to the deaths of countless others. He's been known to get extremely aggressive when interrogating his enemies, going as far as to drive one insane and cripple several others.
  </p>
  <p key="83d5555b-82a2-4746-9514-88b16cb7ad94">
   Bruce's sense of grief can lead him into very extreme bouts of depression. When his parents died, at first he thought it was all his fault. Later on, he directed his rage towards his parent's killer. After losing his childhood friend and love of his life Rachel Dawes, he became more and more reclusive. He also becomes more suicidal at this point, rushing headfirst into fights that might very well kill him.
  </p>
  <p key="0b534449-3395-479c-93d4-a2775c178712">
   Despite his faults, Bruce is still a decent human being who believes in the goodness of others and strives to make life better for everyone. He has a dry sense of humor and has fairly convincing acting skills which help draw suspicion away from himself. Despite his daytime image as a reckless playboy, he invests in several charitable contributions and fundraisers, his philanthropic nature being a trait his parents taught him. This makes him stand out among the other socialites of Gotham who care only for themselves.

   Martha
   , Bruce Wayne grew up home-schooled on his parents'
   Wayne Manor
   estate (since there was no public school anywhere near the estate) apart from them and their trusted butler
   Alfred J. Pennyworth
   . Although the only child in the house, his loneliness eventually changed during his fourth birthday, when his parents brought in other children for him to befriend, but most spent his party running around and yelling. This left Bruce in a best friendship with the only well-behaved child among them,
   Rachel Dawes
   , who was the daughter of the mansion's housekeeper and lived in housing unit nearby. Despite having play dates with the other kid over the next three years, he secretly wished to stay away from some except Rachel, who was the friend he saw the most. One day at age eight, while playing with her in the garden greenhouse, Bruce fell into a cave where he encountered a swarm of bats. His father rescued him, though Bruce developed a fear of bats; the senior Wayne comforted his son by telling him that though people fall, they always have the strength to get up.

   Later, Bruce accompanied his parents into the city to see a new monorail system they built that just opened up for the public. Throughout the ride, his parents explained that Gotham was suffering from an
   economic downturn
   and enduring deeper into very hard times. To help its citizens, his father nearly bankrupted his company,

   Bruce got frightened by a scene featuring a bat-like monster (which reminded him of the bats that attacked him in the well) and asked to leave. Once outside, the family was confronted by a mugger named
   Joe Chill
   , who shot both of Bruce's parents for dead for causing the depression to drive him out of his job and fled just as police patrol showed up to shelter the now orphaned boy. Thomas' last words to his son were to not be afraid. At the

   Gillian Loeb
   was able to capture Chill. Taken back home to watch as his parents' bodies were buried outside, a distraught Bruce was left cared for by Alfred, who arranged that he won't be taken into social service care. He blamed himself for his parents' murder: if had he not been frightened, the Waynes would not have encountered Chill, though Alfred assured him it was no one's fault but Chill's.

   Bruce attend
   Princeton University
   Jungian archetypes and mono-myths. After graduation, returned to Gotham and turned down his arranged inheritance of Wayne Manor's ownership, deciding to demolish the foundation just the way he felt it should be if he had his way. He let his heart weigh him down even more that afternoon, when he learned that Chill's prison sentence was being suspended in exchange for testifying against mob boss
   Carmine Falcone
   , who he shared a cell with. Intent on ensuring Chill didn't become reminder of disgrace under the eyes of the Wayne empire for what he did to his parents, Bruce waited outside the courtroom of
   Gotham City Courthouse
   with a gun under his sleeve to shoot and kill him with, but one of Falcone's henchwomen did so first. Rachel, who was now the city's assistant District Attorney, drove him to an alleyway in front of Falcone's restaurant to show him that things have grown much worse since the depression when Falcone rose to power from the criminal underworld, flooding the city with organized crime, and Chill would have been the justice system's ace in the hole against him. Bruce dismissed that idea by telling her about his foiled plan, and she expressed disgust for his blind vengeance without regard for justice.

  <p key="a4e0904e-8c0e-4e82-8baf-078ab83c5270">
   Realizing she was right, Bruce threw the gun into the harbor and confronted Falcone, who told him that he was ignorant of the nature of crime and he would never be able to face up against criminals as he didn't understand their world. Hoping to prove him wrong, Bruce got on a ferry with the intention of traveling the world to understand the criminal mind. While in Shanghai, he and a deckhand named
   Stocky
   took a taxi to an airport on the city outskirts, where the job was to hijack a truck full of crates being loaded onto it by laborers. The plan eventually succeeded, but both he and Stocky were cornered in a warehouse by police, who detained Bruce in a Bhutanese prison for the theft (ironically of Wayne Enterprises cargo), where he brawled with the inmates.

   On his last day in the jail, a man named

Bruce was freed and traveled to a mountaintop to the League's headquarters to begin his combat training, first stumbling upon a rare blue flower growing near the temple that Ducard told him to pick up along the way. Throughout the time being, Bruce was taught the will to act against corruption and mind his surroundings, which Ducard explained made the death of his parents his father's fault, overcoming his fears in the process. But when he was ordered to execute a criminal as his initiation, Bruce learned that the League were intending to use him to commit urbicide on Gotham, believing it has reach the point of its decadent corruption and that its destruction was necessary to restore the world to balance. In response, he refused their cause and escaped by lighting the League's temple on fire, killing Ra's in the process. Bruce rescued an unconscious Ducard from the wreckage and left him to recover at a village, where the village doctor promised to tell him that his new pupil saved his life.

   Bruce continued begging for food and money until he had enough to make a telephone call to Alfred in the United States. By the time he arrived in Kathmandu two days later, he walked onto a landing strip as the Wayne Enterprises jet carrying Alfred landed and boarded it when the butler saw him. Throughout the plane ride, Bruce shared his idea to fight crime, hoping to show Gothamites that their city doesn't belong to crime and corruption. Alfred agreed to this by saying that during the depression, Bruce's parents believed that the example their monorail system represented would inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city, and in a way, their murders shocked the wealthy and powerful into action to do so. In Bruce's opinion, his idea may not be put in place as the Waynes' son, but as a symbol which he could be incorruptible, everlasting, and terrifying. Alfred assumed that as his master is taking on the criminal underworld, the symbol must be a persona meant to protect those he cared about, who he implied might not believe Bruce to be coming back after being gone for seven years; as it turned out, Wayne Enterprises' CEO,
   William Earle
   , declared Bruce dead to liquidate his shareholding (which had brought in an enormous capital) and take the company public, but Bruce was glad to have left the rest to Alfred. The plane refueled itself once in three days before reaching its destination back in Gotham City, and Bruce often wondered what dramas have been occurring on the city streets.

   Retaking residence in Wayne Manor, Bruce planned on making his return known to Gotham, but nonetheless moved onto investigating key individuals in Gotham's justice system. He started this objection by spying on Gordon from a tailor shop as the sergeant and his corrupt partner,
   Det. Arnold Flass
   , were stopping at a liquor store, and then on Rachel as she was talking with her boss, District Attorney
   Carl Finch
   , were discussing at the courthouse about Falcone's buy on half of the city. While listing much about them from newspaper articles in the manor's living room, he spotted a giant bat flying overhead. This reminded Bruce of the bats he encountered in the well and headed down there into
   the caves below
   to overcome his worst fear. The bats living down inside that he was afraid of fluttered around him and welcomed him as an old friend to their home as Bruce became inspired by them to make the symbol he discussed with Alfred earlier into a vigilante persona, which he later called "the Batman".

Jessica was pretty surprised to see Thomas Wayne's son in front of her and asked him to teach her indoor golf, thus making Earle frustrated after calling her on the comm twice yet shocked to come out of the meeting room to see Bruce alive. As word spread around Gotham about Bruce's return, he and Earle sat down and discussed the company going public. Bruce offered to be handsomely rewarded with his shares, but instead of looking to interfere with the corporation's ownership, he hoped to apply for a job within it. He asked to start at the Applied Sciences Division, and Earle made cheers to welcome the young Wayne home. While down at the workplace, the division's chief activist, former board member

   , and
   <a href="Nomex Batsuit.html" key="d10e31bc-0840-4b71-ade1-4726dfd7faa1" title="Nomex Batsuit">
    a bullet-proof Nomex survival suit made of Kevlar bi-weave

   With Alfred's help, Bruce began construction on a secret base inside the Batcave, and the butler showed him a secret elevator leading from the cave up to Wayne Manor, explaining that his young master's great-great grandfather used it to hide escaped slaves on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War. To turn his new Kevlar suit into Batman's self styled "Batsuit", Bruce upgraded it with unique gauntlets given to him during his League of Shadows training and spray-painted all black without carvings to make it unrecognizable to the Wayne Board, but first needed a bat mask to conceal his identity. Alfred suggested that if they ordered the main part of the mask's cowl from Singapore via a shell corporation, they would put it together from a large order to avoid suspicion. Testing his suit and harness on his first night out as a vigilante, Bruce used it to break into Gordon's office at the police station to ask him about Falcone's criminal operation to bring a shipment of drugs into the city every week and the
   Gotham City Police Department
   's inability to stop him. With the back of his head pressed on by a common office stapler (which was thought to be a pistol), Gordon explained without turning his head that he's payed up with the right people, and the only possible methods against would leverage against corrupt District Court Judge Juez Faden, whose best friendship with Falcone got him listed on the crimelord's payroll, and an assistant DA to provide it for prosecution. Bruce realized immediately that the DA in question could only be Rachel, and suggested that they form an alliance, but Gordon believed him to be "just some nut" and chased him alongside two other cops up to the roof of the building. Luckily, the ski-masked billionaire escaped their gunshots by soaring into the air, but since the suit didn't have wings, he ended up falling headfirst into the railing of another fire escape which collapsed in his grasp.

  <p key="3a043e8c-6aa6-40e2-85ca-f0951a5c6fa6">
   Realizing that the bat he was to become was going to need wings, Bruce returned to Applied Sciences to request lightweight fabric to use for what he claimed was base-jumping. Knowing just the thing, Fox introduced him to a sheet of black "memory cloth" activated by electric currents from a thick canvas glove to change shape, but though Bruce thought the activist might be uncomfortable with the unusual requests, Fox replied that he didn't really care. So the the younger man borrowed it anyway, but in addition asked to have a directional microphone that he would later incorporate into Batman's mask and test out an armored vehicle that caught his eye which Fox called "the
   Tumbler
   ", purchasing the latter in black. Later that night, Bruce began to test the microphone by using it to eavesdrop on a conversation between Falcone and Flass, in which the mob boss mentioned that the last of his drug shipments would be arriving at the docks on Thursday evening and asked the cop to meet him there. When Flass put in that word on the streets that Rachel was sniffing around in their operation, he and Falcone plotted to get her out of the way by having her mugged and assassinated. As soon as their shipment from Singapore arrived, Bruce and Alfred spent the next three days testing the thousand batter helmet-like bat masks to see if one of them was unbreakable enough, which one was. In addition, Bruce added

   With the same bat design spray-painted on the suit's chest, the construction of Batman was complete, but the drug shipment arrival was only a week away. So, the young billionaire decided to wait by leaving again for a brief vacation in northern California, where he saw sights in and around San Francisco and went hang gliding on Mt. Tamalpais for a few days. He did, though, think it as a mistake to leak his hang gliding plans since it would attract attention to the abilities he wanted to be kept hidden. But to his relief when he returned to Gotham by commercial carrier, no one saw him stop at several Falcone-owned areas to install tin microphones on the following night. At his last stop, located in Falcone's apartment near the theater district, Bruce listened as Falcone announced from inside that the next night was when the shipment would be docking, then went back to the Batcave to prepare Batman for his strike. Once the ship docked and
   Falcone's Thugs
   started unloading it, Batman spied on Falcone as he entrusted the drugs sewn inside stuffed bears to his men for them to take to their buyers and the drugs sewn inside stuffed rabbits to Flass for a purpose that the vigilante didn't quite hear. Wasting no time, Batman proceeded to disrupt the shipment, first making the thugs aware of his presence by pulling one of them,
   Steiss
   , into one of the open crates and descended upon two more,
   Bigger
   and
   Alfie
   . Finally emerging in the sight of the Falcone's remaining men, a firefight broke out and Batman was able to subdue every thug. Falcone tried to escape but found his limousine driver unconscious, leaving the vigilante on his heels enough time to grab him from inside and head-butt him, knocking him out. Leaving the mobster tied to a searchlight near his bound thugs which formed a makeshift
   Batsignal
   , Batman arrived at a monorail station and disrupted the rest of the crime family's attempt on Rachel's life, leaving her with the leverage she was looking for. By the time the police rounded up the Falcone crime family, Gordon began to take Batman's idea for an alliance seriously, and the vigilante watched from atop the district courthouse as thousands of Gotham citizens saw him as their new hero.

   Batman's theatrics that night made quite an impression around the city, but a few were not very impressed that someone was taking the law in their own hands and being glorified by it. Though theatrics were sharp weapons to Bruce, Alfred suggested that they may be too sharp if it left serious injuries from his nights as Batman and get some of the billionaire's friends to wonder what he does for his time and money. Later the next day, when Earle invited Bruce to join him for dinner at
   Puccio's
   , the young Wayne drove there in his
   Lamborghini Murciélago LP640
   with two beautiful young European women,
   Kiki
   and
   Soozey
   , as company. While talking about Batman's achievement and the police's "jealousy" of it with Earle and his friends, Bruce let Kiki and Soozey swim an inside pool nearby, but even though a maitre'd told him that they couldn't go in since the pool was a decoration and they didn't have swimwear, he told the waiter that he was going to make some changes before signing a check for ownership of the restaurant on the spot and joining the two women for their swim. On their way back to the Lamborghini, the three passed Rachel, who arrived for a casual blind date. Bruce tried to convince her that he wasn't who he seemed to be, but she noted that one isn't only who they are on the inside, but also how they act.

   Suiting up again later that night, Batman stopped at Gordon's house while Gordon himself was taking out the trash. As the cop implied that Gotham's organized crime was getting jumpy since the vigilante stood up against Falcone, to which Batman complied that it was a start by adding in Falcone's deal with Flass on splitting the drug shipment in half so that those in toy bears went to the dealers, and that the he might get the answer for Gordon on where those in toy rabbits went from Flass. Before he left to do so, however, Batman was warned that Police Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to hunt him in his belief that the vigilante was dangerous, despite Gordon's belief that the crime-fighter was probably trying to help. Cornering Flass in an alleyway and hoisting him up 70 feet into the air with a cable, the bat-costumed man interrogated the corrupt cop until the latter finally explained that Falcone had to drugs driven to "special customers" for a couple of days before they went to the dealers, because there was something hidden within them that they required for an unknown purpose. When Batman asked what that was, Flass blurted out that he never went to the drop-off since it was in
   the Narrows
   , where cops only went when they were in force. Releasing Flass from the cable, Batman headed to the decaying river island and pinpointed drug drop-off point as the apartment of
   Dr. Jonathan Crane
   , a corrupt psycho-pharmacologist and chief administrator at the neighboring
   Arkham Asylum
   on Falcone's payroll. Before he could get his hands on the "unusual" drugs kept inside though, Crane came in with two of
   his thugs
   and told them to burn the evidence. The vigilante hiding in the shadows knocked both men out before they could do anything, only to be stopped when Crane came up from behind in a burlap gas mask, sprayed him with a powerful hallucinogen made from an organic compound within the drugs which he called "
   Fear Toxin
   ", and lit him on fire with a cigarette lighter. Batman narrowly escaped with his life and mind intact by jumping out the window washing the flames off in rain, but the hallucination from the Fear Toxin was too great , and he called Alfred and told him to come pick him up.
  </p>
  <p key="4ee3f241-b250-4f05-96ad-5e16d9298cb0">
   The hallucinations continued throughout the car ride home, but when Bruce awoke to find himself in bed on his 30th birthday two days later, Alfred had already used an anti-toxin developed by Fox to save him. Though Fox believed that his employer was simply getting himself drugged at nightclubs, Bruce asked if he could produce more of the cure. Rachel later came over to drop off her present to him but insisted not to come to the party due DA work that she had to catch up on, eventually leaving shortly afterwards after receiving a call from her office saying that Crane had just transferred Falcone to Arkham on suicide watch. Concerned, Bruce left the festivities to Alfred and suited up to follow her to the asylum. There, Batman listened through his microphone as Rachel observed Falcone's antics (such as the mob boss' mutters of the "external tormentor" persona Crane used for his burlap mask, "the Scarecrow") and accused Crane of corruption, but the sadistic psychiatrist gained the upper hand by taking her down to the nuthouse basement and showing her that he was experimenting the toxin, which was harmful only in vapor form, on his patients and having them pipe it into Gotham's water supply for his mysterious employer. Rachel tried to escape in an elevator, but the Scarecrow blocked her exit, poisoned her with the toxin and took her back downstairs as a captive. Batman saved her by subduing the Scarecrow's gang and attacked the Scarecrow himself by ripping off his mask and spraying him with his own poison, damaging the rest of his sanity. But right when he tried interrogating Crane about his employer, who the psychiatrist oddly claimed was the supposed dead Ra's al Ghul, the police arrived after receiving a call from one of the gang members and surrounded the asylum, so the vigilante carried Rachel to the rafters and met with Gordon up there once he entered the building first. Explaining what had happened, Batman insisted on giving her the anti-toxin when he got back to the Batcave, and instructed the sergeant to carry the assistant DA downstairs to a side allyway while the bat-costumed man signaled a swarm of bats to keep the policemen outside and SWAT team coming into the asylum busy while he made his exit. Then, the vigilante recollected Rachel from Gordon and put her into the parked Tumbler as they sped off from the Narrows. A few policemen led by Flass sped after him in a messy chase leading out of Gotham, only to lose sight of the vehicle when it drove into a clearing underneath an unfinished elevated road.

   Administering the antidote to Rachel in the Batcave, Batman told her that she'll wake up at home with two vials of it for her to give to Gordon – one for the detective to inoculate himself, and another to mass-produce for the city's population. After he sedated her, he thought to himself about loving such a person who he knew his whole life despite it assuming certain trust or fidelity obligations, such as abandoning what he began or subjecting her to continuing danger.

   Heading upstairs to Wayne Manor, Bruce instructed Alfred to drive the still-sleeping Rachel while he attended to the party guests. The birthday celebration was at full swing over for at least three hours until the now 30-year-old billionaire came face to face with unexpected guests from his travels; a group of League of Shadows ninjas led by Ducard, who revealed himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul, and that the man killed earlier was a decoy. In response, Bruce tricked his guests into leaving for their safety by faking a drunken rant much to the League's amusement despite it being pointless since Batman's heroism at Arkham almost delayed their plan. When his student came to realize that the Scarecrow really was working for them after all, Ra's explained that the psychiatrist's toxin (which was derived from the organic compound found in the blue flower) was to be their method of destroying Gotham by distributing it undetected via Gotham's water supply and releasing it on the population so its citizens would destroy their own city in a state of panic. He elaborated on this by adding in that the exploits the League made throughout history were to correct humanity's recurring fits of decadence.

   Bruce tried convincing him that Gotham wasn't beyond saving and should be given second chances, but Ra's signaled his men to setting the manor on fire and retorted that mankind would only see the error of their corrupt nature if an example was made out of the decadent of them, to which they would witness in horror once its most corrupt city destroyed itself and the League's way to move them back to harmony through Gotham proved to be unstoppable than last time; their last attack on the city was through the use of economics that eventually started the depression, but when Bruce's parents used his monorail system to make things better, their murders galvanized the city rebuilding itself and Gotham limped on ever since. With the vigilante society now back to finish the job, no misguided idealists would be able to interfere, and Ra's warned that whoever successfully tried would get killed from behind. Bruce fought briefly with Ra's and his companions in the League, vowing to stop them, but was knocked down unconscious by falling debris. When he awoke a few minutes later, most of the League had already left, and Alfred had just returned and got past the League ninjas guarding the entrances to the burning mansion. Getting his master up from under the debris, the butler helped him into the elevator leading down to the Batcave just as Wayne Manor tumbled in ruins above them.

   Batman returned to the Narrows in the Tumbler to see that the League had already set many psychotic criminals, including the Scarecrow, free from Arkham and started vaporizing the fear toxin onto the neighborhhood with a
   microwave emitter
   stolen from Wayne Enterprises. With most of the riot police battling who the lunatics already exposed to the drug, he he met with Gordon, who was already given the antitoxin from Rachel, and predicted to him that the League were planning to spread the poison on the the entire city by transporting the emitter on the elevated monorail train to Wayne Tower, causing a chain reaction within the city's central water-hub, located beneath the building, that would vaporize the rest of Gotham's water supply. In order to stop them, the vigilante left Gordon in control of the Tumbler before flying to the Narrows monorail station. Along the way, he spotted Rachel being chased alongside a little boy by inmates led by Falcone assassin
   Victor Zsasz
   and saved their lives by lifting them up onto a rooftop. Rachel stopped him for a second to ask who he really was underneath his mask, and Batman repeated what she said about one not only being who they are on the inside but also how they act, indirectly hinting his identity to her. By the time he landed at the station, the vaporizer was already aboard the monorail, and Ra's had four of his ninjas keep his vigilante pupil busy as he boarded to guide the train to its destination. Batman took down three of the warriors, but the last one tackled him over the monorail support's side railing onto the street, where a mob of drugged Narrows inhabitants attacked him. Luckily, he was able to reach for his grapple gun and aim it at the train carrying Ra's and the emitter, which pulled him along as it sped out of the incapacitated island, magnetizing the toxin with it and with Gordon racing ahead in the Tumbler.

   Batman entered the front monorail cart via crashing into a side window and engaged Ra's in battle, where he broke his master's sword with the scallops of his gauntlets and kicked him against the vaporizer before turning to the driver's seat to slow the train's with the brake lever. However, Ra's came from behind and jammed the mechanism with the cane and overwhelmed his pupil by hurling with him over the microwave emitter and pinning him down. Though all hoped seemed lost for Batman as the monorail neared Wayne Tower's train station, the vigilante replied to his mentor's mocks about not being able to fight injustice in Gotham nor preventing the city's destruction by saying that their was no need to stop the train, and broke free of the martial artist's grasp just as Gordon toppled the elevated line using the Tumbler's missiles, demonstrating Ra's' lesson on minding one's own surroundings. Now finally learning to do the necessary, Batman refused to kill his old mentor nor bother to save him, and escaped by flying out of train car's imploded back door and into the night, leaving Ra's still aboard as the train missed the tower's monorail system entrance and crashed to the ground in an explosion caused by the microwave emitter's overloaded power core, killing Ra's and stopping fear toxin vaporization spreading from the Narrows to the crash site.

   Throughout the night, Batman became a public hero when his actions to stop the fear toxin from getting vaporized all over Gotham made the front page of the newspapers. But since the Tumbler was left in the Gordon's possession, the vigilante had Alfred come pick him up and called Fox on the butler's car phone to issue some instructions that would earn Bruce the controlling share as Wayne Enterprises and make the activist the company's new CEO, much to Fox's delight. Upon arrival, Alfred helped his young master into the guesthouse on the manor grounds, where Bruce changed out of the Batsuit and had a cup of Earl Grey with him for the last half hour before morning came. When Earle found out about being replaced with Fox once he saw the activist running a board meeting, the board called Bruce so that he could explain to the former CEO that as long as his company's future was secured, his roundabout means to ensure that projects like the microwave emitter didn't fall into the wrong hands would be what his father would have done to make Gotham a better and more moderate place. Earle was astounded to hear this, and received a quip from Fox, "Didn't you get the memo?". Once they reached the guesthouse after breakfast at a restaurant, Bruce asked Alfred if they could visit what was left of Wayne Manor, where the butler oversaw the start of the mansions reconstruction while his billionaire master sealed the dry well leading to the Batcave up with wooden boards and nails to prevent any of the construction workers from discovering the secret kept within. Rachel dropped by as he was finishing up on the well, and apologized for the terrible things she said to him on the day Chill died. Bruce, however, excepted them as true things because they helped him find his regard for justice, to which Rachel admitted that when she heard that her childhood best friend was back, she started to hope for their future marriage. But when she found out about his vigilante persona, and concluded that the wealthy boy she dated her whole life never spiritually returned, thus telling Bruce that if Gotham no longer needed Batman, they would be together. The young couple went up to the mansion ruins, where Bruce found his father's stethoscope among the ashes and decided to rebuild the foundation just the way it was. He eventually agreed to Alfred's suggestion on making improvements for the Southeast corner, and Rachel expressed joy for his heroic justice with regard for the law.

   Later that night, Gordon unveiled a Bat-Signal for the police department to summon Batman with if needed following his promotion to police lieutenant, and met with the vigilante on the police station's roof near the floodlight to discuss the effects that his appearance had on the city. Loeb had finally disbanded the task force hunting the bat-masked figure after becoming amazed of what saving the city did for his image, and the impact of the Batman's actions started sending a terror through Gotham's criminal underworld, with corrupt authorities running scared and hope on the streets. However, the city had suffered an unstable tear in its infrastructure; the Narrows was lost to its madness and half of the lunatics released from Arkham by the League of Shadows, including the Scarecrow, remained at large. Even though they will have their hands full finding them all, Batman promised that they can bring Gotham back all together but was corrected by Gordon about the escalation in crime. Apparently, Batman's presence in the city not only showed its citizens into further action on ridding their streets of corruption, but also in a worsened way inspired many in the criminal underbelly to adopt similar theatrical tastes of their style. The cop gave his new vigilante friend an example of

   Lau
   . He later revealed that he deliberately allowed for Lau to come so he could get a closer look at his numbers, having already suspected that his business methods were dirty. At the same time, Bruce Wayne and Harvey both competed for the love of Rachel Dawes. Lau informed gang leaders that he had taken their money to Hong Kong to prevent the police and the district attorney from seizing it in an imminent bank raid. In order to ensure there wasn't anything suspicious about his absence from Gotham when trying to retrieve Lau, he also proceeded to have the entire Gotham Ballet group accompany him to a yacht vacation near Hong Kong. He then faked not being able to arrive while Lucius Fox scouted the building under the pretense of a business meeting with Lau, with Fox also proceeding to supply him with a blueprint of the layout of the building. Later that night, Batman then proceeded to infiltrate the building (thanks to a EMP device smuggled inside the building earlier) and, despite the arrival of several cops under Lau's payroll, succeeded in nabbing the corrupt businessman, and also ensuring his escape with a Fulton surface-to-air recovery system and a cargo plane.

When the Joker began killing off public officials, including Commissioner Loeb, despite the best efforts of the police and Batman to stop him, Wayne decided to turn himself in to the police. Before he could do so, Dent publicly admitted to being the Batman to draw the Joker out of hiding for the real Batman to capture.

   With the Joker in custody, Batman and Gordon at first believed that his madness was over, but became alarmed when informed that Dent had gone missing. Desperate to find him, Batman interrogated the Joker until he revealed that Rachel and Dent have been taken to opposite sides of the city, far enough apart that Batman would not have time to save both of them. Batman sped off to save Rachel, while Gordon and the police headed after Dent. Unknown to them, the Joker had switched the locations, sending Batman after Dent and Gordon after Rachel. Batman arrived and rescued Dent just as both buildings exploded, although the left side of Dent's face was burned during the explosion. Gordon did not reach Rachel in time and she died in the explosion. In the hospital, Dent was driven to madness over the loss of Rachel, which he blames on Batman, Gordon and the Joker. The Joker freed Harvey from the hospital and convinced him to exact revenge on the cops, mobsters, Gordon and Batman.

The Joker planted explosives on two ferries of evacuees and gave the passengers on board the chance to destroy the opposing vessel, one full of prison convicts and another with civilians, in order to save their own lives. Batman tracked the Joker to an uncompleted skyscraper. Batman prevented the Joker from blowing up the ferries when both vessels' occupants decide they would rather not sacrifice the lives of the passengers in the other vessel for their own.

   Following a brief hand-to-hand fight which ended when the Joker pinned Batman in a scaffold, Batman threw the Joker off of the scaffold but saved him by grappling him. The Joker acknowledged that Batman really was incorruptible, but that Dent was not, and that he had unleashed Harvey's madness upon the city. Though Joker lost the fistfight, he would win "the battle for Gotham's soul". Batman found Gordon and his family with Dent at the building where Rachel died. Two-Face proceeded to judge Batman, himself, and Gordon's son through the chance of a coin flip, which he saw as the only fairness left in the world. Two-Face shot Batman in the stomach and judged himself innocent, but before he could determine the boy's fate, Batman tackled him over the side of the building, saving Gordon's son, but injuring his leg in the process.

As Gordon destroyed the Bat-Signal, a manhunt was issued for Batman. From that day onwards, the Batman was branded an enemy by the rest of Gotham.

   Bruce Wayne is very dedicated and determined to his work of crime-fighting, sometimes employing illegal and morally dubious tactics (like torture) but ultimately for the good of Gotham. Despite his dark past and serious work, Bruce has displayed a sense of humor around his butler Alfred and a romantic side around his love-interest Rachel and other love interests, such as Miranda Tate and Selina Kyle. Although possessing great hate and anger towards criminals, he has proven himself a very caring and selfless person, constantly putting his life on the line to save innocent lives and bringing the most dangerous criminals to justice for society's protection.

   Perhaps Bruce's strongest characteristic is his strong moral code to never kill, believing all men deserve a trial and to do so makes him no better than his enemies, because of this he was been noted by the Joker as being "incorruptible". Although he did let Ra's al Ghul die, coldly saying "I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you", he has shown compassion for his enemies, such as when he saved his employee Mr. Reese from getting killed, who was just about to sell him out by telling the public he was Batman. Bruce Wayne has also shown himself to have a good deal of faith in people as evidenced in

Bruce Wayne's ultimate goal is to bring order and justice to Gotham city, as opposed to the Joker who's ultimate goal is to bring chaos and anarchy making the two polar opposite's

    Batsuits

  </h2>
  <p key="fa0f9912-29aa-41cf-a348-ecdc1d50e767">
   The Batsuit is the costume Batman wears to conceal his identity and to frighten criminals. This particular incarnation of the Batsuit is given the most complete description ever seen in a Batman film and possibly the comic books. The suit is derived from Lucius Fox's Research and Development program, within Wayne Enterprises' Applied Sciences Division. It is described by Fox as a "Nomex survival suit" originally intended for advanced military use, but, with its $300,000 price tag, was considered to be too expensive for the United States Army and military in general. Based on an advanced infantry armor system constructed from Nomex, the first layer of protection is an undersuit with built-in temperature regulators designed to keep the wearer at a comfortable temperature in almost any condition. The second layer of protection consists of armor built over the chest, calves, thighs, arms, and back.
  </p>
  <p key="3e52d4b7-c838-4768-b99b-c8b0cc4fdc3d">
   This armor features a kevlar bi-weave that can stop slashing weapons and can also deflect any bullet short of a straight shot impact, and reinforced joints that allow maximum flexibility and mobility. The armor was then coated with a black latex material to dampen Bruce's heat signature, making him difficult to detect with night-vision equipment. Made of a graphite material, the cowl acts as a protective helmet. The cowl's Kevlar lining is supposed to be bulletproof. A manufacturing defect in the graphite used in the production of the first shipment of the cowl's components made its outer shell incapable of withstanding blunt trauma (a flaw Alfred demonstrates to Bruce Wayne using a baseball bat). Batman apparently takes on Falcone and his henchmen at the docks with the defective helmet. The second shipment was supposed to fix this problem. An advanced eavesdropping device is concealed within the cowl's right ear and enables Batman to listen in on conversations from a distance.
  </p>
  <p key="f77e4f35-044f-44a8-9988-45811d7aa136">
   Batman's cape is made of "memory cloth," also developed by Lucius Fox. It is essentially flexible in its normal state, but becomes semi-rigid in a fixed form (Batman's wings in the movie) when an electric current is passed through it from the microcircuits in his right glove. Bruce also adds metal gauntlets with scallops on the forearms, an innovation derived from his experience as a pupil of Ra's al Ghul's organization, the League of Shadows. Mainly used to block against knives or other stabbing weapons, Bruce managed to surprise Ra's by breaking the blade of his ninjaken in multiple places with the gauntlets.
  </p>
  <p key="76a2d94c-9447-491f-9171-a6ae583c40c1">
   The Batsuit is changed in the next film
   <i key="9b26a8e5-e57a-48a0-9c91-37c59aac4968">
    The Dark Knight
   </i>
   . In this new design, the bodysuit is made of hardened kevlar plates on a titanium-dipped fiber and is broken into multiple pieces of armor over a more flexible bodysuit for greater mobility. As a trade-off, however, the flexible armor leaves Batman more vulnerable to injury from bullets or knifes in favor of increased flexibility and lighter weight. The cowl of the Batsuit, which in previous film incarnations has been attached to the shoulder and neck, is now a separate component inspired by the design of motorcycle helmets, allowing the wearer to freely swivel and move his neck without moving the rest of his upper torso as was characteristic in all the previous cinematic versions of the Batsuit. Also, a strong electric current runs through it that prevents anyone except Bruce Wayne from removing it, further protecting his identity.
  </p>
  <p key="c09521fe-b267-49eb-b5e3-97274a95c040">
   In this Batsuit, the iconic fins on the sides of Batman's gauntlets are now retractable and are capable of firing outwards as projectiles. The bat emblem is smaller than the one in Batman Begins and it is more similar to the Batman logo used in the posters.
  </p>
  <p key="68b9bc82-40d1-4bbe-b6fc-7949bfd44c98">
   Furthermore, unlike the Batsuit in
   <i key="3d731b97-d434-4d7c-981d-8b9731f738c5">
    Batman Begins
   </i>
   , this suit does not have an external 'memory cloth' cape, but, rather, a concealed cape in compartments behind the shoulder blades, which eject, connecting to the suits limbs to provide a hang-glider-like functionality with a bat-motif design.
  </p>
  <p key="1667ae97-83e8-43a1-8e4a-148a18a16c12">
   The second Batsuit also has sonar-vision, where signals emitted by mobile phones are converted into images in a similar way to sonar. In order to view the said images, white lenses fold down from Batman's cowl to cover his eyes. Aesthetically this gives Batman, for the first time in a live action film, the 'white eyed' appearance he is always depicted with in the comic-books and animated series.
