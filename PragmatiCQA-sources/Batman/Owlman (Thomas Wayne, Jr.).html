Equipping himself with a utility belt containing technology and weapons similar to those used by Batman along with a drug-enhanced high intellect (devoted to crime rather than serving the law), Owlman became a master criminal and an ally to local crime lord "Boss" Gordon (the antimatter Earth's version of

   , gathering a cadre of police officers who did not give into the rampant corruption which infested their version of Earth. Thomas Jr. blames his father for the deaths of his mother and brother and it is strongly hinted that the main purpose to his criminal career is to punish his father, who is well aware of who he is and is equally determined to destroy his own son; during his visit to the 'main' DC Universe, upon discovering the Waynes' grave he states that nothing matters because "He's dead", presumably referring to Thomas Wayne Sr., and actually shows a rare moment of humanity as he kneels in front of the grave, in a display of genuine mourning.

   While

   Ultraman
   is the leader of the Syndicate, Thomas Jr. as Owlman is the real brains behind the group. The working relationship between the two is extremely tense, due to Ultraman's desire to rule the planet through fear and violence clashing with Owlman's more pragmatic desire to allow dissent and rebellion to run rampant (going so far as to funding opposition towards the Syndicate) in order to provide himself and his allies in the Syndicates enemies to fight.

   this reality is stated to be Earth-3, separate from the Pre-Crisis Earth-Three reality and an older Owlman is shown with a young sidekick called
   Talon
   , who is dressed parallel to Grayson's
   Robin
   . The current young Talon had a relationship with
   Duela Dent
   , the daughter of his greatest foe,
   the Jokester
   as shown in the Teen Titans series. The Teen Titan Talon wears a costume that is a direct alternation of Tim Drake's Robin costume, suggesting the current Talon to be the Earth-3 Drake and not the same Grayson-parallel Talon shown in "Search". Based on statements and illustrations in this same book, it is stated one of the earlier Talons succeeded the old Owlman in a manner parallel to the way that Wayne as Batman was succeeded by Dick Grayson in the role of Batman for a period of time. As he was shown killed by the Jokester on page 22 of this book with the Jokester's boot on his throat. A young Owlman with a different costume and helmet later appears in the same book battling the Jokester.

   It is not specified who the old Owlman is though his face is clearly shown in a panel. Some suggest the old Owlman was the Post Crisis Earth-3 Bruce Wayne based on the fact that Todd of Post Crisis Earth-3 is stated to be the current Owlman, though others state the old Owlman was someone else. The old Owlman's exact birth identity has yet to be specified in panel.
