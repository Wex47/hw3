   Bruce had been patrolling the streets for some time prior to the public become aware. Spreading legend around Gotham, he primarily targeted small-time criminals, such as
   Johnny Gobs
   . His forays against the criminal underworld encouraged word and superstition of himself to manifest among the populace, though many of Gotham's citizens regarded Batman to be a rumor. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne publicly devoted his money and attention to cleaning up Gotham, using his efforts to support clean officials and politicians, namely
   Commissioner James Gordon

   Vicki Vale
   . He later encountered her and Knox in the mansion's armory, properly introducing himself to the pair. Enquiring further, he discovered they'd attended the gala to pursue leads about Batman, particularly with Gordon and Dent. Bruce seemed to flatter Vicki during their conversation.

Eventually catching up with him at the main mixing chamber, Batman disarmed the criminal and prepared to apprehend him. However, he was forced to let Napier go when his second-in-command,

Later that day, Bruce visited the alleyway where his parents were murdered, leaving flowers to pay his respects to them.

After Alfred delivered the files, Bruce watched the Gotham officials announce the cancellation of the 200th Anniversary Parade, only for Joker to once again hijack the airwaves to declare he'd be hosting the parade himself and to deliver a challenge to Batman. After this, Bruce recalled the night of his parents' deaths.

   Pretend to surrender, Batman threw a flashbang capsule onto the ground, stunning the soldier and giving him the oppotunity to escape. As he ascended the line, the stunned soldiers attempted to shoot at him. However, these wounded at least four bystanders and killed the youth he'd chased. Shocked from the harm he'd done, Bruce returned to the Batcave to contemplate his actions, only coming out of his state when Alfred investigated.

   Still reeling with grief, Bruce did not patrol Gotham the following night, instead working out and ordering the Bank's Penny to decorate the Batcave. The following morning, he listened to talk shows with the personality
   Dr. Q
   , though quickly called Alfred to turn it off. When confronted him on his order, Bruce relayed what had happened in Burnside and confessed feeling responsible for the kid's death. When Alfred suggested he tried philanthropy, this struck a cord with Bruce and he decided to donate to the neighborhood's youth.

  <p key="0b21094d-7524-43d9-90aa-336a9d5b1e20">
   Visiting Harvey, Bruce asked to arrange a meeting with Burnside's councilors to help with his efforts. Meeting at the
   Royal Autobody
   , they proposed that he funded the borough's children's education, including university degrees and other equivalents. When confronted on his motives, Bruce reasoned he'd heard about the recent violence and the orphaned child, Nyesha. The group agreed to think about his proposal. After the meeting, Bruce noticed
   a gang of copycats
   breaking into the Autobody. Donning a makeshift mask to hide his identity, he chased the group into an alleyway, though found they'd already been subdued by Catwoman.

  <p key="841ec488-40ff-458d-b716-ecbbb621136a">
   After "exchanging a kiss", Bruce returned to the Royal Autobody without his mask to rescue Harvey. Working with mechanic Drake Winston, he pulled Dent to safety before another explosion went off. Staying behind to make sure he was okay, Bruce learned that Harvey had been disfigured by leaking battery acid, disfiguring half his face and possibly causing internal damage. His presence was caught by several reporters, one of whom took a photo against his will. Forced to stay behind to give a statement to Bullock, Bruce also learned that Drake had witnessed the alleyway events, thus figured out he was Batman, and caught a glimpse of Catwoman leaving the scene. He later returned home to discover more reporters outside, forcing him to return via the Batcave.

   The following morning, Bruce learned his actions had become frontpage news around Gotham, drawing public attention that he'd previous avoided. He also discussed the night's events with Alfred, letting him know of Drake's suspicions and Catwoman's reappearance. Bruce later visited
   Gotham General Hospital
   to visit Harvey and arrange for plastic surgery to heal his disfigurement. When Barbara confronted him on his intentions, he revealed he'd be paying for the treatment himself. Returning to his car, he discovered a note from Selina cryptically giving him a meeting at

   Arriving at the appointed time, Batman quickly located Catwoman and chased after her, eventually subduing on the rooftop where they'd first fought. As they flirted, he offered to help rehabilitate Selina and reinstated the offer he'd given her. Batman also learned she'd also taken mercenary work, though had begun targeting the rich in Gotham who'd begun exploiting . Catwoman also confronted him on his lack of investigations into white-collar crime . Learning that Selina had begun talking to a psychiatrist about their relationship, their meeting was quickly interrupted when a series of fires were set off around the city.

   After the incident, Bruce returned to the Batcave alone. Discussing riots in Burnside with Alfred, he learned that the vigilante he'd encountered had helped Burnside protestors in a confrontation with the GCPD and the fallout for Gordon. Before he left to rest, Alfred revealed he'd discovered links between the Wayne family and Drake Winston. Investigating the information, Bruce learned that the youth was a member of Burnside's once-prominent Winston family and how his family had bought out their company to cover a buyout. Calling him back, Bruce invited Drake to Wayne Manor and sent Alfred to pick him up.
  </p>
  <p key="a77889b9-67d2-408e-8a41-68d03ac192a1">
   Bruce met with Drake after he was shown the foyers' gallery. Taking him into the library, the youth attempted to convince him to testify against the arsonists and asked him to tell the GCPD that he'd subdued the group. Bruce denied the allegations and told him about Catwoman's involvement. Drake, however, refused to believe him and threaten him with a vial, claiming it contained the same acid that disfigured Harvey. Bruce fought him off, ending when Drake was subdued and the contents were revealed to be water. However, the fight confirmed Drake's suspicions that he was Batman, leading him to reveal himself as the vigilante he'd encountered.

  <p key="71ad8711-2fae-41e7-bc4e-6fd969bd1281">
   Inviting Drake to discuss it over dinner, Bruce learned over it how he'd deduced his identity and why he'd not revealed it to anyone else. During it, they discussed his influence on the Batman copycats and its negative impact on Gotham. When Drake asked to see his car, Bruce brought him into the Batcave to see the car and his equipment. While down there, the youth proposed a partnership to take on the copycats and ensure order in Gotham.

   Bruce Wayne was heavily scarred by the sight of his parents murdered in front of him. He shows interest in Vicki Vale, but because of his obsession with his alter ego he seems unable to open up to her on an emotional level. Bruce has a deadpan sense of humor, though he only shows it to Alfred, whom he has known his whole life. Whilst in the comics he kept up his playboy profile by making public appearances, in the Tim Burton films he is something of a recluse. The people of Gotham have no idea what he even looks like, as he is able to go out in public without drawing attention to himself. When confronted by the Joker in broad daylight, he displays a level of frustration bordering on psychopathy as he smashes a vase and screams

   so as to appear intimidating. This contrasts with his normally cool demeanor when dressed as Batman, implying that his alter ego is a release for all of his psychological issues. Unlike his comic-book counterpart, this version of Batman doesn't think twice about killing criminals. At the start of Batman it was revealed that he dropped a mugger off a building. He also attempted to kill the Joker as means of revenge. In

Shortly afterwards, Bruce and Selina would figure out each other's identities, revealing that the attraction between them was built around their personal demons.
