   Clayface
   , who had created her in order to scout out Gotham for his inevitable return. Unfortunately the girl had 'forgotten' her purpose and continued to run. When Clayface reabsorbed the girl, Tim took her 'murder' very hard and almost killed Clayface.

When Superman arrived, growing concern himself, he and Robin teamed-up with Superman masquerading as the missing Batman, and Tim being his guide. Together the duo discovered that Bruce was actually under Brainiac's mind controlling nanites. Together they managed to save Bruce and again destroy Brainiac.

   Sometime after Dick Grayson left Gotham for good to establish himself in
   another city
   , Robin was patrolling alone one night. Upon hearing a scream of terror, Robin thought he was saving a lone woman from thugs but instead, fell into a trap set by the Joker and
   Harley Quinn
   . For three long weeks, at the old
   Arkham Asylum
   , Tim was mercilessly tortured with electro-shock and chemical injections. The Joker also took the opportunity to implant a microchip at the base of Tim's skull that contained an encoded version of the Joker's DNA and memories. During the course of the torture, the Joker learned the precious secrets entrusted to Robin. Not content with just destroying Tim's mind he sought to further humiliate Batman. To this end, the Joker transformed Tim into a crude version of himself. Tim's skin was bleached white, dying his hair green and twisting Tim's mouth into a grotesque Joker-like grin. Because of the torture and makeover he endured for the three weeks, he was also rendered unable to communicate in any way except with demented laughter. Renaming him "Joker Junior" aka "J.J." the Joker claimed Drake as his and Harley's new son, and planned on using Drake to destroy Batman. During the battle that followed, the Joker gave Tim a gun and ordered him to kill Batman with it. Tim laughed uncontrollably and fought with the choice whether or not kill Batman. He finally killed the Joker instead, after which he completely broke down in the arms of Batgirl. After these events, Commissioner Gordon quickly covered up the incident and nothing was ever made public.

   After the traumas that he suffered, Tim was shattered physically and psychologically. To help him recover, a close friend of the Wayne family, Dr. Leslie Thompkins spent a year treating Tim. Despite this, Tim would suffer horrible dreams for years. After he was restored back to sanity, Bruce forbade Tim from ever being Robin again; he blamed himself for what happened and swore that he would never endanger another young partner. Drake went out on his own as a hero and attempted several times to mend things with Bruce, only to fail.

   Later in his life, Tim completely gave up the life of a hero and became a top-level communications engineer, got married and had two kids. He ended up apparently regretting ever being Robin and had less love for the Robin suit than the Joker. Despite his apparently hatred of his other life from his teenage years, he still had a relationship with Barbara Gordon. Tim however fell out of contact more or less with Bruce, and like his life as Robin, Tim seemed to resent his former mentor. It was later revealed however that much of his hatred for his life from Robin and Bruce, was caused by another source entirely.

   microchip with the Joker's DNA and memories onto Tim's spinal column, located on the back of his neck. As the years passed, the microchip activated, allowing the Joker's personality to emerge and take control of Tim, transforming him into the Joker's own physical double, the 'resurrected' Joker reaching a point where he could take control of Tim at will while he attributed any lingering memories to bad dreams of his time as 'J.J'. This dual existence explained Tim's increased hatred for the identity of Robin. The 'new' Joker went on a crime spree using Tim's communication engineering skills to take control of a satellite with a laser on board. Ultimately, however,
   Terry McGinnis
   , the new Batman, was able to destroy the chip with the Joker's own lethal joy-buzzer in a final confrontation, freeing Tim from his control.

   , covered up Tim's involvement with the Joker's crimes, as he was technically innocent. As Terry took his leave to let Bruce and Tim catch up, Tim told Terry that he was more than worthy of being Batman, and Terry said that it meant a lot coming from him.
