   needed a costumed protector just as honest citizens had Batman, Killer Moth emulated the Dark Knight in every way, copying his paraphernalia and building on his legend to create his own super villain identity. He eventually came to resemble a dark mirror image of Batman, even adopting the alter ego of a wealthy philanthropist similar to Bruce Wayne. Moth was motivated by greed rather than justice, and only served the criminal underworld for a price. His bizarrely ingenious weaponry, such as "Mothmobile" modeled on the

   and an incapacitating cocoon gun, did not protect him from consistent defeat at the hands of Batman.

   Killer Moth's major claim to fame was being the first supervillain ever defeated by then-amateur heroine Barbara Gordon, the first Batgirl. His reputation was largely destroyed as a result of that debacle and other extravagant but failed capers; throughout his latter career he struggled to be taken seriously by the underworld. The original Killer Moth was Drury Walker, but there have been multiple incarnations of the character operating under different aliases during Batman's career.

   Much like Batman, Killer Moth's textual history has undergone several major revisions but a few fixed themes have emerged, namely the fact that he was a petty ex-convict who dreamed up a scheme to become the patron saint of Gotham criminals by protecting them from law enforcement. Donning a garish costume, the self-styled "Killer Moth" used his skills to help other miscreants evade capture in exchange for a share of their ill-gotten wealth. This brought Moth into several confrontations with Batman, nearly always resulting in his defeat and return to incarceration. During a botched attempt to kidnap Bruce Wayne, Moth was thwarted in his efforts by the intervention of Barbara Gordon, daughter of Gotham police commissioner
   <a href="James Gordon.html" key="0f649c13-1bb2-4fe5-b51f-628d75945974" title="James Gordon">

   . This experience helped establish Barbara as the fledgling heroine Batgirl. While Killer Moth was originally considered a threat in his own right, his reputation declined thereafter and he went from being a consistent regular of Batman's Rogues Gallery to an obscure washout who struggled to be taken seriously.
  </p>
  <p key="4d9ac573-0f8c-4d60-824f-2d0015f453d2">
   Like many super villains introduced during the Golden Age of Comic Books, Killer Moth's flamboyant persona and spectacularly bizarre, often impractical schemes were regarded as being unsuitable for the increasingly dark and gritty Batman stories which began appearing during the late 1960s and early 1970s onwards. Interest in Killer Moth diminished quickly with the end of the Silver Age of Comic Books. With a new audience invested in more realistic, noir themes, the more cartoonish Golden and Silver Age villains
   disappeared from Batman's cases
   . Having survived this trend, Killer Moth was nevertheless a rare exception to the rule; Batman himself once described him as a relic of a bygone era, much like others such as

   and the
   Cavalier
   , who continued to resurface on occasion in futile attempts to reassert themselves as successful criminals. Part of the reason for the character's continued survival was the pivotal role he has traditionally played in Barbara Gordon's career as Batgirl, making him an inseparable part of her past in most incarnations.
  </p>
  <p key="090c17eb-8be0-43ba-bccf-ce67e9003259">
   The shift in themes and storytelling led to Batman literature and media becoming more psycho-analytical in nature, as most of the

   and the Rogues Gallery possessed no superhuman abilities. This led to new ideas surrounding the psychology of the characters, and why they pursued the lives they did. For example, books like

   and the disturbing psychological connection he shared with the Dark Knight. Although Killer Moth had long been relegated to the periphery of the Rogues Gallery, he was subject to the same treatment. Storylines like

   Although Killer Moth was originally conceived as human, after the Golden Age he was almost never shown out of costume, leading to some ambiguity concerning his true nature. During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, he appeared to exhibit some genuinely animalistic characteristics, such as a set of razor sharp teeth he used to saw through Batgirl's grapnel line. This theme has resurfaced a few times since, namely in the

   storyline, in which Moth is transformed into a humanoid monster known as "Charaxes". Since the original character was never named, Killer Moth's true identity was also the topic of some dispute; compounding the confusion was the fact that he used a variety of aliases. Moth was alternatively referred to as Arthur Leland, Cameron van Cleer, Laszlo Furlenbach, and Drury Walker, with the latter being used with the most consistency. Further adding to the ambiguity was the sheer number of outright impostors and those with unverifiable claims about having assumed the Killer Moth persona at one point or another, suggesting the supervillain gave rise to a cult following.

In this guise, "van Cleer" sits on the board of directors for the Gotham municipal museum, purchases a large manor on the outskirts of the city, and is introduced to other prominent society figures such as Bruce Wayne. By night, however, the supposedly distinguished socialite dons a bizarre helmet and costume, becoming Killer Moth - an alter ego which the convict swore would "mean to the underworld what Batman has meant to the world of law and order!"

Killer Moth's grotesque costume was complete with a utility belt, a "steel strand" which resembled Batman's grapnel gun, and a helmet sporting twin antennae capable of picking up police band radio. Unlike Batman, Moth also carried firearms and had no qualms about using deadly force. During his first job, he rescues some mobsters from the police, only to be pursued by Batman and

This battle of wits ends abruptly when Moth plunges one thousand feet into the river to his apparent doom. (

   Unknown to Batman, Moth was able to break his fall with his winged costume and escape into a storm drain. Emerging from the sewers, he flags down a ride from a group of petty crooks who recognize and ridicule him. Word soon spreads around the underworld of Killer Moth's defeat at Batman's hands, and as Moth became a laughing stock among the city's mobsters he adopted what would deepen into a lifelong obsession with salvaging his reputation and being taken seriously again. Using his influence as Cameron van Cleer, Moth persuades the Gotham Museum's board of directors to import a collection of Mesoamerican moth artifacts for an exhibit while secretly planning to pilfer them and revive his own shattered image. The subsequent disappearance of these artifacts from a storage vault known only to the museum staff attracts Batman's attention, however, and the latter deduces that Killer Moth is one of the board members. At the same time, "van Cleer" makes a slip revealing his own identity, allowing Batman and Robin to finally unearth his alias and have him arrested at his home. (

   Several months later, Killer Moth escapes the state penitentiary but finds it difficult to resume his criminal activities without a hideout, an alter ego, or cash. Since he couldn't afford to build up a new, respectable identity, he decides to steal one from an existing socialite, Bruce Wayne, whom he kidnaps and imprisons in a vault. Rather than ransoming his hostage, Moth hires a plastic surgeon to alter his features to resemble Wayne's. Arriving at

Marveling at his good fortune, Moth goes out as Batman and obligingly assists Robin with breaking up the rackets of notorious gangster Whitey Casey; however, he then visits Casey as Moth and blackmails him for protection money. Meanwhile, Wayne escapes, changes to Batman, and attacks the Casey gang. Convinced he has been double-crossed, Casey guns down Moth with a Thompson sub-machine gun. Moth's face was wrecked by the bullets, forcing him to undergo a reconstructive procedure, and the resulting cranial injury caused amnesia regarding recent events. (

The Dark Knight was now faced with another quandary: prison officials had informed the Justice League that Killer Moth was still incarcerated. The "second" Killer Moth quickly broke free and Batman discovered to his astonishment that he was grappling with an empty costume. During the ensuing melee, he remembered that Killer Moth had once used a silken cord to swing from building to building. Batman groped for the cord on Moth's utility belt and used it to yank the costume back to earth as it attempted to escape. Using his own batrope, Batman then overpowered the costume and left the struggling bundle of cloth trussed up in a ball. (

   The following day Moth delivered a threatening letter to Wayne Manor, demanding $100,000. When Bruce bluntly refused, Moth became determined to murder him for his insolence. Batman and Robin staked out the manor for the next three days, arranging mannequins resembling Bruce Wayne in various lifelike positions. Once Killer Moth was satisfied he'd eliminated Bruce, they could then tail him to his hideout. Though Moth's assassination attempt was interrupted by Batgirl, the Dynamic Duo implanted a tracking device on the Mothmobile and were able to locate his headquarters anyway. They were initially trapped in an anti-gravity chamber by the Moth-Mob, but Batgirl is able to ground herself using a powerful magnet and free them. Killer Moth vanishes and is only apprehended when Batgirl locates his hiding place by the scent of her perfume, which had lingered on his costume after their clash at Wayne Manor. (

   Killer Moth soon took up company with the Cavalier again as they plotted their revenge on the Dynamic Duo. Moth's fixation with learning the location of the Batcave and gaining access to Batman's secrets resurfaced; he was convinced he could pry that information from Batgirl. The Cavalier disagreed, pointing out that Robin was much more closely associated with Batman and would have greater access to that information. Moth bet $10,000 that he could trick Batgirl into revealing the location of the Batcave, and the Cavalier set out to prove him wrong by targeting Robin in a similar manner. For a week, Moth intentionally bungled attempts on Batgirl's life, warning that he would kill Batman next. The purpose of this exercise was to force Batgirl to alert Batman directly at the Batcave, while Moth tailed her and learned its location. Barbara soon deduced Moth's plan and led him on a wild goose chase. When Moth entered the wrong cave, she amused herself by allowing him to wander listlessly about after stealing his cocoon gun. Realizing Batgirl was mocking him, Moth attempted to kill her with his bare hands but was knocked into an underground pool. (

This scheme was simply a new take on an old formula: when cornered by costumed heroes or the police, Moth's clients summoned him, albeit via a radio beacon rather than the Moth-Signal. Batgirl stumbled onto his latest racket while investigating the suspicious murder of a local shoemaker, a Mr. Halsey. Halsey was working on a project for "Cameron van Cleer" when he died, which coincided with Killer Moth's latest appearances in Washington. Batgirl deduced that the Boltons were contacting Moth through miniature transmitters hidden in their shoes, allowing them to send out distress signals whenever they were in danger of being apprehended. She confiscated the shoes of two imprisoned Bolton gangsters and transmitted a false signal to Moth, luring him into an ambush. (

Moth and the Joker, who masterminded the details, believed that Batman would jump at any chance to redeem Harvey Dent due to the close relationship they'd enjoyed during his tenure as Gotham district attorney. Ultimately, Two-Face opted out of the cabal after a coin toss. (

   Paul Sloane

   To prepare Sloane for assuming the role, Moth shadowed the real Two-Face and let Sloane observe his mannerisms and habits. Sloane became so fixated with Two-Face that he even attempted a duality themed heist while disguised as latter, claiming he needed to know how it felt. The Joker, who had gotten bored with the "overrated" team effort, decided to sabotage Sloane's crime by tipping off Batman. The ensuing battle made headlines in Gotham City and attracted the ire of the real Two-Face, who kidnapped Sloane and tortured him nearly to death before dumping him at the Joker's hideout. Disappointed, Moth and the other rogues parted ways, leaving Scarecrow to dispose of Sloane. (

   A third explanation was advanced by an amateur art thief named Danko Twag, who claimed there were actually multiple Killer Moths throughout Walker's career, although the latter used that persona most consistently. Twag infiltrated Barbara Gordon's apartment and disclosed his knowledge of her past identity as Batgirl as well as her current one as Oracle.

Twag was never captured, and later his identity was stolen by Walker, who was imprisoned for his initial crime spree. The truth remained uncertain, because Twag committed suicide before Oracle had an opportunity to probe him further. (

The wild melee ended when Robin allowed Moth to take flight with his loot before using his own momentum to slam him headfirst into a glass display case. (

   Working out of Albuquerque not long afterwards, a Killer Moth—likely one of the trio encountered by the Secret Six—kidnapped and tortured Mike Dante, assistant to a certain Professor Hyatt believed to be in possession of sensitive technology. This incarnation of Moth was a bald, brown-eyed individual who bore little resemblance to Drury Walker, although he was attired in Walker's classic costume. His clumsy efforts at interrogating Dante for information on Hyatt's work resulted in the former's death. One of Dante's friends, retired Atom

   Killer Moth had no compunction with using firearms and although he rarely took human life simply for the sake of it, he had no difficulty resorting to murder as it suited him. Moth often killed civilians around him when they either ridiculed his costumed identity or possessed insider knowledge of his operations. For example, he killed the original architects of the Moth-Cave. (
