   Venom was a potently addictive strength-enhancing super-steroid. According to JSA Classified #17 (November 2006), Venom was based on the Miraclo Formula that was developed at Bannerman Pharmaceuticals, the drug company that was formerly owned by Rex Tyler, the original Hourman. The first appearance of the drug was a five-part story arc,

   , steroid patches known as "Slappers" contained small doses of impact-release Venom. They were mainly used as performance enhancers in competitive sports, although the use of multiple patches could produce
   Bane

   Titan was much more potent than Venom, and required only a small amount for a Bane-like reaction. The treatment had a price, as the sudden release of endorphins and adrenaline, along with the extreme pain of the transformation, resulted in the recipient going into a crazed, psychotic state. The subject underwent not only a size change, but grotesque facial and muscular disfigurement, and even caused their spinal columns to become exposed. Only the Joker retained his

It was possible the drug reduced even Joker's intelligence, for while the fight was a ferocious one, Batman had no trouble in finding a strategy to bring Joker down. Whatever his overall health, Joker did not look well when he was shown in withdrawal during the game's closing scenes, nor did his formerly enhanced henchmen.

   , Bane was shown as being one of the eight assassins who was hired to kill Batman on Christmas Eve. Besides his regular use of Venom, which he acknowledged as a weakness, Bane also developed a variant of Venom, TN-1, as a means to overcome his addiction, but was reluctant to use it until it was perfected because it caused permanent and gradual memory loss. Bane learned about Batman's true identity, but the drug seemed to have the effect of memory loss on the user. The drug greatly increased the user's bone density and muscle strength.
