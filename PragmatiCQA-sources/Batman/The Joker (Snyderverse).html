   Ace Chemicals
   and fallen into the Chemical Vats, bleaching his skin white, hair green and lips red. Becoming a career criminal, Joker built up his own criminal organization, including henchman
   Jonny Frost

   Dr. Harleen Quinzel
   . After an unknown amount of therapy sessions, Joker managed to seduce and convince her to help him escape. Organizing his gang to break him out, he then had the gang restrain Quinzel in electroshock therapy. Justifying it as retribution for similar treatment, Joker torture Quinzel with the eletrodes, damaging her brain and driving her insane.

   After an unspecified amount of time, Joker brought Quinzel to Ace Chemicals. After having her deliver an oath to help in his criminal endevors, he convinced her to jump into the same vat that created him to become his "Criminal Queen". When Quinzel complied, Joker thought of leaving Harleen to die, but had a change of mind and saved her. As she regained consciousness, Joker kissed her, embracing her as his partner in crime: Harley Quinn. The two would have multiple encounters with Batman from that point onwards. Their relationship also prevented retrobution against Quinzel by other mobsters, such as the
   Black Mask

   To prepare for the role, Leto researched real-world criminals and psychopaths, particularly those who worked for Cartels or organized crime. Some source also claimed that he slept a night within a prison during it. He also isolated himself from the rest of the cast, listening to 1920s gospel music and reading literature about shamanism. Leto also sent cast and crew members macabre gifts, such as live rat to Quinn actress
   Margot Robbie

   Leto also claimed that Joker had a much more substantial role in the film, with the footage shown being only "a fraction" of what he had featured in. Some have speculated that Warner Bros. may have interference with production after negative reception to

   Zack Snyder
   's plans for future DC Films. Joker had originally been absent in the films original version, including Snyder's original footage, but was added Joker's appearance was also changed, with his costume changed to a post-apocalyptic appearance and the tattoos being removed.

Some have also been critical of the fact that Joker is alive in the Snyderverse films, given that Batman kills criminals and that he is established to have caused more psychological pain than any other member of Batman's rogues gallery.

    There is much contention of the identity of the Robin Joker killed and potentially the timeline. Zack Snyder intended for it to be
    <a href="Dick Grayson.html" key="c55c97e9-a2a2-4e20-b436-3e3de579f5a9" title="Dick Grayson">

    , and he'd also have acted alone. However, Ayer claimed he assumed Snyder intended for it to be

     Jason Todd
    </a>
    , who'd traditionally died at Joker's hands. Props and promotional material for both films also refer to this being the case. Harley's animated bio also claims that Quinn was also complicit, or potentially responsible, in the act.

      There are several contradictions with accounts of Joker killing Robin, particularly in

      . In the film, Joker has the grill and tattoos, which he received after killing Robin, in flashbacks for Harley's origin. However, the film also claims that Harley assisted him in the murder. It is possible that Joker had killed Dick Grayson whilst Harley killed Jason Todd, though this is only conjecture and Snyder has denied any other Robins existing after they were murdered.
