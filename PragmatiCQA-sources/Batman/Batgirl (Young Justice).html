   In "Beneath", Batgirl was assigned to Alpha Squad alongside Miss Martian, Wonder Girl and Bumble Bee in an effort to infultrate a base in Byalia in order to find Krotolean stolen technology. They are commanded off sight by Nightwing who explains that he assigned an all female squad to avoid Queen Bee's power of male control. Batgirl asks if he would have felt the need to justify an all male squad, leaving Nightwing in an awkward silence. They begin the mission by sneaking in and leaving Wonder Girl behind to watch. Wonder girl spots Psimon, which means she cannot warn the team telepathically, and is forced to disobey orders and enter the facility to inform Miss Martian directly. She is successful but is soon spotted by Devastation which causes them to become compromised, unknown to Batgirl who remains in a vent and is found by Bumble Bee who informs her. They head further into the facility, but are soon found as Batgirl is quickly knocked unconscious by Psimon. The team rescues her and leaves her to drive their escape plane along with several found hostages. She is nearly stopped but saved by Miss Martian and Wonder Girl, they return to receive a warm congratulations from Nightwing.
