Significantly, the well-known superhero Aquaman was left out of the lineup (although he would become a member of the team on

   ), and was replaced by Hawkgirl, the team's second female (along with Wonder Woman). Additionally, John Stewart-- an African-American Green Lantern who had previously worked with the League in the comics -- was used rather than one of the better-known modern-era Green Lanterns: Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner or Kyle Rayner (even though Rayner had appeared as Green Lantern in the Superman animated series).
