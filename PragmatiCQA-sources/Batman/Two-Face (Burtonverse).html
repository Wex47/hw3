   a double-headed one
   , the outcome would always bee in Harvey's favor, though he later claimed that he knew that it was rigged. At some point, he took the coin into his possession and used it to reassure his decisions.

   As a teenager, Dent had the opportunity to go out drinking with friends, though refused to stay inside and study. The incident meant he avoided being caught with the friend and a criminal record. Dent's efforts ultimately led to his enrolment at law school and a career in law. Some time during
   Batman's
   early career, he was elected as Gotham's District Attorney.

   Carl Grissom
   . Unknown to either party, their efforts were also helped by Batman, who secretly provided them evidence for these. At a press event organized by

   The following day, Dent and Gordon discussed preparations for the city's 200th anniversary celebrations with Borg. Despite the Mayor's enthusiasm  for the prep, both he and the Commissioner express concerns of budgeting and public safety. In response, Borg suggested that businesses will return to Gotham once they'd arrested and imprisoned Grissom. Dent also attended the fundraiser at
   Wayne Manor

   Alexander Knox
   confronted him on rumors of Batman, which he dismissed as "[stories of] ghosts and goblins".

   When one of the Joker Gang members stole Barbara's purse, Harvey chased after him but was quickly ambushed by another member. Pretending to surrender his watch, Dent instead fought against the would-be muggers and tossed his coin, threatening to kill them if it landed on heads. When Barbara arrived, Harvey reassured her he'd simply scared them off and reassured her he was safe. As they watched Batman drive by in the
   Batmobile

   At some point over that night, Dent decided to blame Batman for inspiring the riots and criminals. He also decided to remove Commissioner Gordon, believing that he was either becoming too reliant on the vigilante or using him as a personal enforcer. Dent also convinced Barbara to help by using her access at the GCPD to uncover Batman's identity, despite his plans for her father.

   The morning after the riots, Harvey visited Bruce Wayne to ask for his support, though expected he would side with Gordon due to their history. Using reports about the previous night's events, he argued that Batman was callous as the criminals he fought and that his presence inspired more dangerous criminals. He also shared a theory that the vigilante was actually multiple people under Gordon's command. When Bruce politely refused, Dent left the home and warned him about the National Guard's presence in Gotham until they caught Batman. As he left, Dent called Barbara to discuss evidence she'd obtained from confiscated equipment belonging to Batman. This included
   a computerized Batarang
   taken during
   a previous Christmas
   , which they realized he had access to high-tech.

   Deciding to get help from his old neighborhood, Harvey called into the Royal Autobody to met with Otis, claiming his car needed routine maintenance. When Otis confronted him on his absence, Harvey initially claimed he'd come to set a good example for Burnside's children, though gradually charmed him with recollections of his childhood. Able to soften Jerome, he was able to convinced him to get figures from the community to help him, such as Gotham Congressional Church reverend
   Cecil Culp
   . With this, he was able to get enough support to call for Gordon's dismissal as Commissioner.

  <p key="21b5ef5b-3373-46d7-b81c-3e6dad717efe">
   That night, Dent worked with
   Harvey Bullock
   and at least three other officers to set a trap for Batman on the GCPD headquarters' rooftops by lighting the Batsignal. However, he knew that it wouldn't work, since it hadn't been used in six months. Whilst waiting, Dent learned from Bullock that Gordon had been communicating with Batman via a communications channel. Unknown to them, the vigilante was monitoring the conversation from a nearby rooftop.

   The following morning, Harvey and Barbara visited a park to test the confiscated Super-Batarang. As she talked him through the systems, Dent struggled to target other object, continually being hit by the weapon. Both of them also deduced that the weapon must have cost millions and Batman had access to it. Eventually giving up, Harvey left to pick his car at the Royal Autobody. In reality, he wanted to ask for help from
   Drake Winston
   , a young mechanic working at the shop to track down components belonging to the Batmobile. However, the youth refused due to a person grudge against the GCPD.

   Deciding to put his campaign aside, Dent agreed to help the group in the demonstrations, even speaking at the event.

This Dent also showed him possibilities he'd avoided, including him dying in his mother's place and his arrest if he'd gone out with Curtis. Believing these to be split possibilities out of his hands, Dent decided to put himself in control of his own destiny.When he regained consciousness, Harvey took his double-headed coin and defaced one of its sides with a nail file.

   Believing it would help chose his destiny, Harvey began using the coin to make his decisions. Among them were whether to continue his relationship with Barbara, to stop fighting for "the soul of Gotham", and to refuse the surgery offered by Bruce. He also began to display a second personality based on the "Harvey Dent" he'd dreamed about. The following night, Harvey mounted an escape from Gotham General Hopsital, knocking out a guard to steal his door keycard and painkillers. During the escape, Harvey also ripped of the bandages and embraced his new appearance.

   Breaking into the Gotham City Police Headquarters, Harvey began stealing files from the GCPD. After the cops learned of his appearance, he attempted to hide from them. However, an officer entered the room he was hiding in, forcing Dent to attack him and flee. Chased into the Subway system, Dent escaped by running in front of a train, only surviving by hiding against the wall. Going further into the tunnels, he eventually travelled into the abandoned Burnside station, where he planned to set up his new base of operations.
