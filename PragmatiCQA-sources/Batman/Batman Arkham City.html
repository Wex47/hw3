   Eighteen months after the chaotic events of
   <i key="6e67639c-7ea9-468b-bd6e-af3514738ed3">
    Batman: Arkham Asylum
   </i>
   , both the
   Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane
   and
   Blackgate Prison
   remain gutted, the former in a massive breakout launched by the inmates, lead by the Joker and the latter due to a mysterious fire, which the Joker hints was caused by him for his plans in
   <i key="a1f16ffc-c6c8-46bb-b374-20f1092bbb1f">
    Arkham Asylum
   </i>
   . The administrator of Arkham, mayoral candidate
   Quincy Sharp
   , soon takes advantage of Batman's defeat of the Joker at Arkham and claims the credit himself for bringing the asylum back under control, perhaps saying Batman was working under his orders. This is partially to salvage his image, in tatters after the single worst asylum riot took place at a crucial time when Sharp was trying to convince the people of Gotham City to vote for him.
  </p>
  <p key="9de7f5cc-6490-4650-84a7-3441305bd574">
   This is successful, and Sharp is elected mayor of Gotham (though it's actually thanks to Hugo Strange's partnership with Rā's al Ghūl). His first act is to announce ruined Arkham Asylum and Blackgate Prison both unfit to house criminals, sane or insane. He then undertakes a bold new project: To move all the former inmates of incarceration at both places into a walled-off urban district, Arkham City. This will be a city only for villains, and is made up of Gotham City's most notorious slums, including
   <a href="Crime Alley.html" key="480d7c5c-d3b6-4fbe-a9e7-32fb2b59d61f" title="Crime Alley">
    Crime Alley
   </a>
   . To guard the perimeter of Arkham City the mayor does away with Arkham Asylum's old security force and replaces them with professional mercenaries from a private military organization, TYGER (who are subjugated to brainwashing by Strange). Once all the criminals are trapped inside the prison city, they are told they may do as they please, but there is only one rule: Do not try escaping or you'll be shot dead. This is supported by the TYGER mercenary forces, who enforce this policy through the liberal use of their firearms on any escaping denizens of Arkham City. Since the entire population of Arkham is made up of criminals running wild on the streets, Sharp secretly hopes they will destroy each other inside walled confinement instead of committing crimes in Gotham.
  </p>
  <p key="7e0c80ee-ccfc-485e-b053-e70c3bc98b3a">
   With the criminals free to do whatever they want short of escaping, bloody turf wars erupt as various super-villains carve up Arkham City among themselves. A mysterious figure named Dr. Hugo Strange, an Arkham psychiatrist, is placed at the helm of the project by Sharp, but little is known about his objectives or his shadowy past, and rumors soon run rampant that he is up to horrible things behind Arkham City's walls. Those who try and find out too much about Arkham or Strange one by one mysteriously vanish by night, and it is implied most end up inside the city themselves, to be torn apart by the inmates. Batman, wary of Sharp and even more so of Strange, monitors Arkham City for several months, believing that the entire thing has been a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.

   ,
   Bruce Wayne
   is holding a press conference discussing the danger of the
   Arkham City
   super-prison, calling it unsafe for the people of Gotham. However,
   Hugo Strange
   , the mastermind of Arkham City, is one step ahead and sends
   TYGER
   operatives to arrest Bruce as well as the press reporters covering the press conference, and have them all imprisoned within Arkham City.
  </p>
  <p key="0224686c-d550-42b1-9c53-7ae10e353188">
   Strange interrogates Bruce, revealing his knowledge of his secret identity as Batman, and says that, with him out of the way, "
   Protocol 10
   " may proceed as planned. Bruce attempts to escape, but is restrained by a TYGER guard and released into Arkham City. On his way inside, he meets
   Jack Ryder
   and protects him from multiple guards and inmates before being sent into Arkham City, and is inserted as Azrael watches from the nearby rooftop; however, he is confronted by the
   Penguin
   and a group of his thugs and is knocked out. Penguin proceeds to beat Bruce down as revenge for destroying his family, but Bruce manages to fight back, breaking Penguin's hand and breaking his cuffs in the process. After defeating Penguin's thugs, Bruce escapes into the City. He then has Alfred send him a Batsuit. Once dressed for the occasion, Batman programs a stolen TYGER communications chip into his cryptographic sequencer, which enables him to listen in on TYGER's communications.

  <p key="7d3c1ee1-46ec-45d6-9303-82306f37a18a">
   Doing this, Batman is able to find out that
   Catwoman
   has been captured by
   Two-Face
   and his gang, who is planning to publicly trial and execute her at the Soloman Wayne Courthouse. Believing that Catwoman could have valuable information on "Protocol 10", Batman resolves to save her. Batman is able to save Catwoman and restrain Two-Face. When Batman asks her about Protocol 10, Catwoman doesn't know what he's talking about, but she believes that Strange could possibly be working with
   <a href="The Joker (Arkhamverse).html" key="aa79b4d5-f644-4277-b571-a3370db9a547" title="The Joker (Arkhamverse)">

   . At that moment, a sniper round aimed at Catwoman is fired into the courthouse and misses her by millimeters. Batman manages to get her out of the way and tells her that it's not safe.
  </p>
  <p key="809952cc-5b3e-423b-9fd8-5a9b48f427f8">
   With this, the duo go their separate ways. Setting up a crime scene, Batman is able to determine that the round was fired from a church tower across the street from the courthouse. Entering the church, Batman encounters a group of Joker's thugs led by
   Harley Quinn
   , who mentions that the Joker wasn't feeling well before leaving. Evading the thugs, Batman manages to take them all out and rescue a team of security guards, led by
   Aaron Cash
   , being held hostage by them. After rescuing the hostages, Batman travels to the top of the church's bell tower, where he finds the sniper rifle hooked up to a remote feed, which he proceeds to hack. Moments later, Joker appears on the TV's inhabiting the small area; it is revealed that his face has become hideously mutilated with deep cuts and scars. Moments later, a series of bombs go off, destroying the tower, though Batman is able to escape just in time. Batman is able to track the remote feed to the Sionis Steel Mill, which is serving as Joker's base of operations. Infiltrating the Steel Mill, Batman is able to rescue
   Dr. Stacy Baker
   , who tells Batman that Joker was dying from an illness brought upon by the

    TITAN formula

   , and briefly overcomes
   Mister Hammer
   , one of the
   Abramovici Twins
   who joined up with Joker. Batman then breaks into Joker's office, where he is fooled into thinking Joker is dead when he sees a Joker dummy attached to a flat-lining vitals monitor. The real Joker and Harley then ambush him, knocking him unconscious.
  </p>
  <p key="dd653fa7-ae3a-494f-b373-5a0e25ce483b">
   When Batman comes to, he finds himself strapped to a wheelchair, with Joker standing in front of him. Batman accuses Joker of lying and not really being sick, but Joker proves him dead wrong when he shows him his heavily scarred face. Joker also reveals that he's injected Batman with his contaminated blood, and has had samples of it shipped to hospital emergency rooms all over Gotham, intending to poison hundreds to give Batman the motivation to find a cure for him. Batman believes this to be Protocol 10; however, Joker claims that he has never heard of Protocol 10, and proceeds to push Batman out of a window.
  </p>
  <p key="a6a545a2-0384-4b95-a068-95c7c541f915">
   Batman takes the SIM card from a cellphone strapped to his chest by Joker and puts it into his cowl in case Joker has information about the cure for him. Joker states that he blackmailed
   Mr. Freeze
   to make the cure for him, but he had since lost contact with him. Searching for the coldest area of Arkham City, Batman tracks down Mr. Freeze's location to an abandoned
   GCPD
   forensics lab, but upon reaching the facility, learns that Mr. Freeze is not there. After defeating a group of thugs working for Penguin, Batman interrogates one of them, and learns that Penguin has kidnapped Freeze and taken him to the Natural History Museum, which he has turned into his base of operations.
  </p>
  <p key="45e851eb-9e7a-4a58-a05c-93ff9f09b3ad">
   After a few complications, Batman infiltrates the Museum and learns that, against his advice,
   Commissioner Gordon
   had sent an undercover team from the
   13th Precinct
   to infiltrate the gangs of Arkham City and Penguin has captured all 10 of them. After Penguin kills one of the cops, Batman vows to take him down. Batman manages to rescue all (except two, who were being personally held by Penguin) of the remaining undercover cops, and locates the captive Freeze. In exchange for Batman promising to return his suit to him, Freeze reluctantly tells Batman that his suit contains an override chip that he created in the event that someone ever managed to use his weapons against him. Batman takes this override chip, then heads to the
   Iceberg Lounge
   to confront Penguin and disable his freeze gun (which he had stolen from Freeze earlier.)
  </p>
  <p key="46be9616-ee82-4ca1-94e4-1b2c614fff0e">
   Penguin, however, has an ace up his sleeve. He dumps Batman into a hidden chamber beneath the Iceberg Lounge, where it is revealed he is keeping the massive zombie known as
   Solomon Grundy
   . Penguin awakens Grundy using electricity and forces him to fight Batman. After a long fight, Batman is eventually able to take down Grundy after disabling the electricity sources keeping Grundy active, then tearing out his heart. Batman then confronts Penguin one final time and beats him down, then has him imprisoned within one of his own display cases.
  </p>
  <p key="9e255148-76dd-44b6-b5bb-b3d48b9fcead">
   Batman then returns to Mr. Freeze (who is now fully armored) and demands information on the cure for his and Joker's illness. To his dismay, Freeze states he had indeed been able to manufacture a cure, but it was incomplete - it required a restorative chemical in order for it to be properly stabilized. Studying the data, Batman tells Freeze that he knows of a man who had been exposed to a nearly identical chemical for several centuries:
   Rā's al Ghūl
   , the leader of the
   League of Assassins
   . Freeze asks Batman to retrieve a sample of Rā's al Ghūl's blood so he can use it to synthesize the cure.
  </p>
  <p key="0e101710-d20b-4086-9e89-c3e479a3dec8">
   Suddenly, Batman is attacked by a ninja bearing the insignia of
   Talia al Ghūl
   's elite guard. Using a blood trail to track the ninja, Batman proceeds to follow her. Along the way, he is ambushed by more assassins, but is saved by
   Robin
   . Batman gives Robin a sample of his poisoned blood and tells him to give it to the hospitals in Gotham. Robin reluctantly agrees and leaves Arkham City. Resuming his search for Rā's al Ghūl, Batman tracks the trail of the assassin to the abandoned
   Wonder City
   , which is functioning as the headquarters of the League of Assassins.
  </p>
  <p key="c5e16598-a977-4900-b68d-8367bd318704">
   Unfortunately, Joker's poisoned blood has started to take effect, and Batman is greatly weakened. Estimating that he has only minutes to live, Batman nonetheless forces himself to keep going, his sheer iron will perhaps the only thing keeping him from death. Finally arriving at the Chamber of the Demon, Batman meets Talia and tells her about his condition. Because he seemingly has no other choice, Batman informs Talia that he has finally decided to accept Rā's' offer to replace him as the leader of the League of Assassins. Talia informs him that he would need to take part in a series of tests known as "The Demon Trials". As part of these trials, Batman drinks a sample of the "
   <a href="Lazarus Pit.html" key="4fcb1fe7-4e68-4484-b280-28956055fab1" title="Lazarus Pit">
    Blood of the Demon
   </a>
   " which boosts his health but doesn't completely cure him.
  </p>
  <p key="d1ba7df5-990e-43b5-83bd-ae2da8b783fb">
   Batman is inevitably successful in completing the Demon Trials. Afterwards, he confronts Rā's himself, who states that in order to become his successor, Batman simply has to kill him. Batman refuses to kill under any circumstances, prompting Rā's to get himself into fighting shape by jumping into his Lazarus Pit and immersing Batman into a hallucination where he is all powerful.
  </p>
  <p key="8ff04990-0f2b-4b3c-bfc2-db84d8b7b80b">
   Batman nearly defeats Rā's, but at the last moment, he takes Talia hostage and tries to force Batman to kill him to save Talia (whom Rā's states is the only woman Batman has ever loved, supposedly). Instead, Batman simply knocks him to the ground via a well placed Batarang and acquires the blood sample he came for. Angrily, Talia runs off after having been used and betrayed by the only two people she loves.
  </p>
  <p key="7c822590-2416-45ae-bfb0-6f89a6dd7596">
   Rā's also reveals that the reason why he's seeking an heir is because his extensive use of the Lazarus Pit has mutated his body and mind. He says that each time he comes out of the Pit, he fears more and more what will come out next. Batman gives Rā's one chance to break his addiction or he'll come back and break it for him. Batman has no time to go after Talia, as he needs to get the blood back to Mr. Freeze. However, on his way back to the GCPD, Batman hears an announcement from Hugo Strange. Strange announces that Mayor
   Quincy Sharp
   has been brought into Arkham City and encourages the inmates to "provide him with the welcome he deserves". Batman decides to find Sharp and question him about Hugo Strange. Upon reaching the surface, Batman finds Two-Face's thugs surrounding Sharp with guns. After taking them out, Batman interrogates Sharp about Strange but only learns that Strange had "powerful friends" who helped Sharp win the election at the cost of Sharp "turning a blind eye to Strange's experiments".
  </p>
  <p key="9d0376dc-17b3-4848-8f25-cbfd7931213a">
   Once back at the GCPD lab, Batman gives the blood to Freeze, which he uses to complete the antidote, making two vials. However, at the last moment, Freeze destroys one of the vials and seals the other into a vault, then tries to use the antidote to blackmail Batman into rescuing
   Nora Fries
   , whom has been kidnapped by the Joker as collateral to try and force Freeze to make the antidote. They proceed to fight each other over the antidote and Batman defeats Freeze.
  </p>
  <p key="b01280f7-26dd-4efd-a593-011e91aff826">
   However, it is revealed that during the fight, Harley Quinn had broken into Freeze's safe and taken the antidote. Freeze tries to help Batman defeat Joker, hoping that he'll rescue Nora, by giving him an armament of freeze bombs he developed. Unfortunately, on his way to Joker's hideout
   Vicki Vale
   's news chopper is shot down by Joker, leaving her caught in a shootout between Joker and Penguin's thugs. Batman easily rescues Vale and moves on, being informed by Joker that the attack was a distraction to buy Harley time to get back to base.

  <p key="e3714ca8-4f40-4c2a-81b8-4094030cd8a8">
   Once inside,
   Oracle
   calls and tells Batman that Strange been given approval by the Gotham City Council to initiate Protocol 10. Strange claims that he failed to stop the spread of illegal firearms, which he provided, in the city and that the inmates are preparing an uprising. Using this, Strange has gained permission to activate Protocol 10 in 30 minutes.
  </p>
  <p key="4d06d402-8953-41d4-b88c-a9979c87e00d">
   Returning to Joker's office, Batman notices that Joker has apparently been completely cured. Batman demands that Joker hand over the cure. Joker refuses, and fights Batman, aided by a large group of henchman, Mister Hammer, and a TITAN-enhanced thug. Batman is able to defeat the others, and advances on Joker. Suddenly, Talia interrupts the fight, and surprisingly offers to give Joker the secret of immortality and make him the new leader of the League of Assassins. Intrigued, Joker agrees, but Talia plants one of Batman's tracking devices onto herself, subtly telling Batman to follow her lead. Meanwhile, across town, Catwoman and
   Poison Ivy
   are arguing. Catwoman neglected to water Poison Ivy's plants and now there is only one left which is locked up in Strange's vault, protected by TYGER guards. Catwoman convinces Ivy to allow her to retrieve the plant from the confiscated goods vault.
  </p>
  <p key="15ee1a02-04c9-4df0-86ec-9b7389b4f85a">
   During the effort to break into the vault, Catwoman overhears Strange's plans to wipe out Arkham, and has apparently killed Batman. Against her better judgement, Catwoman proceeds to rescue Batman with success. Once outside, Batman realizes that Protocol 10 is actually missile strikes against Arkham. It was a ploy to gather every criminal in Gotham in one place and wipe them out.
  </p>
  <p key="889596ca-f0f9-4311-b90c-340a7213b15e">
   Batman orders Oracle and Alfred to remotely hack Wonder Tower and stop Protocol 10 while he goes to rescue Talia from Joker. Instead, Alfred and Oracle cut Batman off from WayneTech telemetry and force him to stop Protocol 10 first. Determining that the Tower is on lockdown, Batman hacks the TYGER Patrol helicopters and eventually finds the Master Control program. With it, he is able to infiltrate Wonder Tower.
  </p>
  <p key="cd48f96f-080f-4eec-8818-f3a572edf339">
   Once inside, Strange contacts Batman over the PA system and says that the crime problem was his fault to begin with and his presence created an environment in which the criminal element has spiraled out of control, and there was never any way to truly rid Gotham of crime, until now. Batman proceeds up Wonder Tower and eliminates Strange's personal guards before confronting him in his office. Incapacitating Strange, Batman contacts Oracle and tells her to shut down Wonder Tower. She succeeds, and Protocol 10 is halted.
  </p>
  <p key="5c02be8e-ee07-4d5e-a6ae-09ae9ff91486">
   Rā's al Ghūl suddenly makes an appearance, revealing himself to be the mastermind behind the whole plot. When Strange came to him with Batman's identity, he was so impressed that he offered this one chance to prove his worth and succeed him, which now he has failed, and Rā's stabs him in the back. When Batman asks Rā's about the plan, he states that doing this was the only way to rid crime from Gotham. Batman is disgusted with Rā's, saying that he has become the very thing that he had always fought against. At that moment, Strange activates "Protocol 11" with his dying breath. Suddenly, the tower begins exploding around them - Protocol 11 was a self-destruct sequence. Batman and Rā's jump out of the tower just in time. During the fall, Batman tries to save Rā's. Trying to take advantage of the situation, Rā's attempts to kill both himself and Batman by stabbing the both of them with his sword, but only manages to kill himself.
  </p>
  <p key="5c816671-d8a6-4e52-b64b-bd9151022c34">
   Once Batman recovers from the fall, he is contacted by Joker, who reveals that he has taken Talia hostage at the
   Monarch Theatre
   . Batman heads to the theatre and confronts Joker, demanding that he return Talia. In turn, Joker, while holding Talia at gunpoint, demands that Batman give him the cure. Batman is confused at Joker's statement, as he is apparently healthy and had already stolen the cure. At this point, Talia breaks free from Joker, then stabs him with her sword, seemingly killing him. She then reveals to Batman that she stole the cure from Harley Quinn. However, realizing that it's never simple with the Joker, Batman begins to rethink all the strange occurrences throughout the night; a seemingly dead Joker dummy in a wheelchair, the two versions of the Joker card left in place of the cure, and a healthy Joker looking into a mirror that reflected a sickly Joker. Connecting them all together, Batman realizes the truth: there were always two Jokers.
  </p>
  <p key="adc6cb40-cf42-4b5c-a3b6-c42f24d95938">
   Moments later, Talia is killed by the true Joker, who is indeed still very sick. The seemingly dead doppelgänger then reveals himself to be none other than
   Clayface
   , who says that he agreed to impersonate Joker because it was "the role of a lifetime". Batman then engages Clayface in a fight, with Batman able to slow Clayface down using the freeze bombs given to him by Mr. Freeze. After completely freezing Clayface, Batman seeming defeats him when he takes Talia's sword and cuts him into pieces. However, Joker detonates explosives on the floor of the theatre, causing it to collapse, and bringing the fight into the room where the very Lazarus Pit that Joker had been looking for was located. After a brutal fight, Batman finally manages to defeat Clayface for good, then retrieves the cure and drinks it, curing himself of the TITAN illness, keeping the other half needed to cure Joker and the rest of Gotham.
  </p>
  <p key="773b2df3-7ed7-42f6-90b1-fe7eafcd63b4">
   Joker then attempts to jump into the Lazarus Pit to claim immortality once and for all and become the new leader of the League of Assassins. However, much to Joker's dismay, Batman throws the sword into the main generator, causing it to falter and knocking what's left of Clayface into the Pit. The controls and remaining generators go critical as a result as Clayface's body matter contaminates the chemicals of the pit, resulting in an explosion that completely destroys the pit and most of the room.
  </p>
  <p key="94e354ed-c3d8-4fed-bb7c-effcb6fcfccf">
   Now desperate, Joker demands that Batman hand over the cure. Batman pauses for a moment, stating that, because of all the misery he has caused, all the lives he has either ended or ruined, and that no matter how many times he apprehended him, he would just escape and continue to cause more pain and misery; he felt that maybe Joker
   <i key="b27525ef-754d-4dc9-93cc-698768a14f78">
    did
   </i>
   deserve to die. Joker desperately tries to take the cure by force, stabbing Batman in the arm. However, he inadvertently causes Batman to drop the vial, shattering it onto the floor. Screaming in horror, Joker tries desperately to drink what is left of the now useless cure from the floor. Batman watches with pity, and states that, despite all the atrocities that Joker has committed, he still would have saved his life. Laughing at the irony of the situation, Joker comments that actually was pretty funny. Seconds later, he finally succumbs to the TITAN poison, and dies with a smile on his face.
  </p>
  <p key="5adb49e0-93ee-471d-a8c1-c61d5adc6905">
   A stoic Batman picks up Joker's body and carries him out of Arkham City as the inmates and the other survivors of Protocol 10 watch. Outside, Commissioner Gordon asks Batman what happened once he sees the Joker's corpse but Batman does not reply and merely lays down the Joker's body on the hood of a GCPD car before silently walking away.

    Catwoman
    - Catwoman is controlled differently than Batman. She has her own story, (Roughly 10% of the game) and her own combat moves (uses her whip, bola, and caltrops). Instead of gliding, she uses her whip plus jumping and climbing through the environment. She has her own version of detective mode, which is known as thief mode. Thief mode highlights objects of value. Along with her whip and the bola, Catwoman uses a Caltrop in combat. She can also crawl along ceilings, climb building, etc. with her claws. While some of her missions are optional, she will have to be used on occasion seeing how her story is intertwined with Batman's. The content featuring Catwoman is not available on the disk, you must download it from Xbox Live/PlayStation Store using a code that comes with new copies of the game only (so if you buy a game used, or from Gamefly, you can't get the Catwoman content unless you pay an additional money required). Catwoman also has her own exclusive collection of Riddler trophies to find.

   Batman also has combat abilities added in addition to the new movement abilities. He can pull off a new move called Dive Bomb, Batman can drop from either a great height, or execute the maneuver mid glide, plummeting towards the ground to either reach his destination quicker, or make a dramatic entrance to a fight. Rocksteady have confirmed that thugs will jump back in fear, and are not forced back by a form of shock-wave generated by Batman's impact.

   Arkham City is five times bigger than Arkham Asylum. Because of that, there is a less constrictive feel to the game, and a lot more movement options for Batman has been given.
  </p>
  <p key="5ce11ea6-2244-42fe-9e64-e3c0b8cfcf49">
   Gliding has been given a major overhaul in Arkham City, in Asylum, the player was limited to a very simple glide mechanic that allowed the player to slow descent, allowing them to cover more ground whilst airborne, and perform turns in the air. In Arkham City, Batman swoops across the rooftops, and can execute two new moves that allow him to maintain his glide indefinitely.
  </p>
  <p key="a55e7fdd-de47-4811-ab0c-0aff8ffc0278">
   The first move, the Dive Boost, is very similar to the Dive Bomb, where Batman will pull his cape in and hurtle towards the ground, opening his cape at the last second, and using the newfound boost to make him soar back upwards into the sky. 
The second move is the Grapple Boost. Batman can fire the grappling gun from the first game in mid-glide, and use the line to pull himself through the city.
  </p>
  <p key="b327d78c-5e83-4c0a-ba6b-a27983d448e1">
   If Batman is feeling tired, or perhaps wants to travel around in a stealthier fashion, he can now use his Grapple Gun to zip up to a helicopter and hang off it, as well as a sneaky way to travel around Arkham City, Batman can also use this elevated position to plan out his next plan of attack, before dropping into the fray.
  </p>
  <p key="4490a38e-5929-4f46-b1ac-dac3fddc0536">
   The Line Launcher from Arkham Asylum makes a return, but the gadget has been heavily upgraded since the last time we saw it, Batman is still able to use it to quickly get from one place to another, though in Arkham City it will open up a whole new range of movement and strategic possibilities. Rocksteady confirmed that the player is able to fire and travel along the rope line, in the same manner as which they did in Asylum, however this time around the player can swivel the camera around Batman, and at any point during the Line Launcher transportation, execute a flip into the air, following up with a quick second shot from the Line Launcher. Batman can perform this move with 360 degrees of flexibility, and similar to the Grapple Boost, this tactic can be repeated to keep Batman off the ground indefinitely. When traveling down the line, the player can press a button that will slow down time, allowing for easier line launcher shots. Batman can also anchor his line between any two points, and then flip up onto it, balancing in place. Batman can move the distance of the line, using his position to plan an attack. More aggressive players can then choose a target, and swing down using the line, slamming their chosen enemy into the ground.
  </p>
  <p key="e14dc499-f610-4442-93a7-09cbb270434b">
   The Silent Predator missions have returned. In Arkham Asylum Batman could perform many exotic environment based take downs (Such as the Corner Takedown or Ledge Takedown) Arkham City is set to increase the variety of these take downs. Similar to combat, Rocksteady excluded certain gadgets like the Ultra Sonic Emitter, which can summon bats to aid you, and will go into the stealthier aspects of the Dark Knight at a later date.
  </p>
  <p key="0fea1118-1a2e-473f-a028-dbba510604bd">
   Batman can burst through thin wooden walls to grab an enemy and choke him unconscious, which in gameplay terms is a combination of Asylum's explosive gel and a standard silent take down.
  </p>
  <p key="6fd80514-e04e-4fae-929e-be1ac4cd2def">
   Batman can now perform double silent take downs, as well as hanging take downs. Batman also has a new smoke bomb gadget, small smoke grenade pellets that distract the enemy and obscures Batman from view just long enough for the Dark Knight to make his escape. To use the smoke bomb, the player must hit the Y or Triangle button when he is spotted by enemies in a button prompt on screen.
  </p>
  <p key="e1425efc-a41d-40f3-afe3-540378d464b4">
   Batman can also sabotage his enemies' weapons using the Disruptor, so that when enemies spot and attempt to fire at him, the guns will not fire.

Decoding this message is more complicated. First, match each number to its corresponding letter in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.). This gives the sequence: C T Z R Z P X A K D X I C H E B L R F P G K C J Q E M D U H. Using an Atbash cipher, A is substituted for Z, Y for B, X for C, and so on. This gives the sequence: X G A I A K C Z P W C R X S V Y O I U K T P X Q J V N W F S. Finally, a Vigenere ciphere is used. A keyword is needed to solve the cipher, and the keyword for the code is "SCARECROW". Once decoded, it reads:

   Arkham City was scripted by veteran comic book author Paul Dini, who also scripted Arkham Asylum. It features a main plot and side-missions that develop their own sub-plots. The main storyline revolves around Batman's imprisonment in Arkham City, a sprawling new super-prison five times bigger than the original asylum and enclosing a wide variety of industrial districts, iconic locations and Gotham City landmarks. He must now stop mishaps occurring around this chaotic enclosure caused by Gotham's most notorious super criminals. The game has received universal critical acclaim and was the highest rated video game of 2011.
