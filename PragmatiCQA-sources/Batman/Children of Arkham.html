   Years before Batman's operations in Gotham City, his father,
    Thomas Wayne
    , worked with crime lord
    Carmine Falcone
    and corrupt
    Mayor Hamilton Hill
    to gain control of the city. To get rid of citizens who posed a threat or did not accept their offers, they convicted them to
    Arkham Asylum
    . To make sure their "insanity" looked realistic, the trio would inject a psychogenic chemical into their victims, which stripped them of moral filters and cause them to act violently.
  </p>
  <p key="a3d634a2-2917-48c9-a113-459c73af666e">
   It is unknown who founded the Children of Arkham, but the group began as a political group with peaceful intentions. Hoping to expose the trio's use of the Asylum, their voice fell on deaf ears. It distributed what happened to the organization, but it eventually fell into the hands of
   Vicki Vale
   , the daughter of the Arkham. Vale reinvented the group as a terrorist organization and adopted the identity of Lady Arkham, a figure she created during her childhood. She tracked down and convinced other Gotham citizens who had suffer the repercussions of the trio's action, mainly those who had lost parents or relatives to the institute, notably

   Roland Desmond
   .

  <p key="e5d5c85e-96dd-491d-b6e8-9d205c7a8afe">
   Using Cobblepot's ties to the criminal underworld as "the Penguin", the group grain resources and mercenaries to bolster their ranks and began preparing for an attack on Gotham. They seized up evidence against the Wayne family, including an account managed by Wayne and Falcone and a video of
   Oswald's mother
   . Through blackmail, they managed to get Hill to hand over information on his partners, including the warehouse the trio's chemical was stored. Penguin also hired the skilled thief
   Catwoman
   to retrieve these drives and the location of the drugs.

   The Children of Arkham's attacks began when six of its members broke into City Hall, murdering a security guard on the way. Making it to Hill's office, they accidentally activated an alarm, which locked the room down. Whilst one member tried to break open the lock with a power saw, their leader destroyed the elevator with C4, cutting off the GCPD. As they continued to break the lockdown, the vigilante Batman arrived and subdued several members. Confronting the leader in combat, he defeated the mercenary and the last member. At least five member of the group would be arrested by the GCPD after the incident.

   The next day, the group leaked the account managed by Wayne and Falcone to news outlets in Gotham. The same day, other members of the Children investigated a warehouse owned by Falcone, where the chemicals had been located and were to rendezvous with Catwoman. When she failed to arrive, the group were forced to search for the chemicals themselves, leading to them attracting attention. With GCPD officers arriving, a shootout took place that lead to multiple deaths, including three members.

   Following the successful heist, Lady Arkham and the other members were able to refine the drug to make victims susceptible to suggestions. The day following Falcone's arrest, one of their members, likely Vale herself, intercepted and injected
   Sgt Renee Montoya
   the modified chemicals, coercing her into killing crime lord. Unable to disobey, Montoya followed through and was taken into custody shortly afterwards. At the same time, Penguin ordered his men to locate Catwoman, having deduced her identity as Selina Kyle.

   Some time after Falcone's murder, Penguin, Blockbuster and his raided the Skyline Club to gather his resources and further evidence of the Arkham conspiracy. As they interrogated one of the criminals, Batman, having learned about their involvement, confronted Cobblepot on their actions. After hearing that his men had located Catwoman, Penguin ordered a group of men to assassinate her. When Batman tried to stop them from leaving, Blockbuster battled and threw the vigilante out of a window, allowing the group enough time to escape. Penguin's men later attacked the
   Stacked Deck
   , where Kyle had been located. However, they were defeated by the cat burglar and Bruce Wayne, who had warned her of their attack prior to their arrival.

   That night, the Children of Arkham, lead by Penguin, attacked the Mayoral debate between Hamilton Hill and
   Harvey Dent
   . Making their presence known, Vale, who hid among reporters, was taken to the stage and injected the candidates with the modified drug. The Children showed a video of "Lady Arkham" proclaiming their cause and footage of Wayne committing Esther Cobblepot. As this took place, Batman and Catwoman infiltrated the building and subdued several members. When GCPD launched their attack, Penguin murdered Hill and attacked Dent, possibly disfiguring him in the process. During the commotion, Batman was able to subdue more members, including Blockbuster, though Penguin escaped in the chaos. Following the attack, the Children of Arkham released the names of Thomas Wayne's victims and officially began their crusade against the city.

   In the following week, the Children of Arkham began attacking Gotham in ferocity, ranging from simple crimes to elaborate attacks. Using records obtained from Wayne Manor that Hill provided, the Children of Arkham gained access to Wayne Enterprises' network and access all organizations within the city. Covering up his past as the Penguin, Cobblepot infiltrated Wayne Enterprises to replace Bruce Wayne as CEO, granting the Children access to its resources and finances.

   A number of members, including Lady Arkham herself, planned out another attack, this time on the busy Mercy Street. They planned to send a rigged train to spread the chemical via a monorail train, which was modified to store tanks and release them on trigger. Requiring more of the drug, they arranged a transfer a number of barrels to a Skyrail depot they had infiltrated. With the handoff taking place on Arkham Island, the operation was interrupted by Montoya, who had sworn to stop them following their use of her. At the same time, several members made another attempt on Dent's life, hoping to murder the new mayor. Depending on Batman's decision, the following situations can take place.

With access to the GCPD's communication, Dent's assassins are able to prepare for their attack and bolster their forces to hold off the GCPD.

   After hearing members alert the perpetrators of the crime he chose not to pursue, Batman realized the GCPD's communications have been compromised and alerted Gordon. When he learned that Wayne Tech has been responsible, Batman tipped the GCPD off and they removed all Wayne Tech from their operations. With this, the Children of Arkham were unable to monitor their operations, but it also crippled communication for officers.

   After running out of the dissolving agent required for the new chemical, Lady Arkham lead a group of the Children to attack an unknown building to acquire more. Successful, they returned to the Skyrail depot with Catwoman, who hand helped with the heist. Having tipped Batman off about the base and knowing he was likely present, Lady Arkham took the thief hostage and threatened to inject her with the new drug unless he surrendered. This lead to a fight between the vigilante and the members present, including Arkham herself. Batman was able to sabotage the plan by destroying their delivery train with sticky bombs. It is unknown how many members were able to escape or were captured by following the group, with the exception of Lady Arkham herself.

   In the following days, Children of Arkham attacks dropped, due to the police state imposed by the now insane Harvey Dent. Their last reported crime was the apparent kidnapping of Vicki Vale. After murdering her adopted parents, Lady Arkham used her father's warehouses to store the drug and as a new base for their operations. Using his new position as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Penguin began using its finances to fund the Children of Arkham and purchase various weaponry. He also provided them with various prototype gadgets and installed a Black Box into the network, enabling them to hack into any Wayne Tech device. In doing so, Penguin discovered

   After Batman learned of the Children of Arkham's stockpiling at Vale Water and Heating's warehouse, he informed the GCPD about it. When Dent gained access to the information, he sent his mercenaries to blow up the building. Though it didn't cripple the Children of Arkham's operations, it cut off their supplies and ensured that they would not use it in their operations. It also lead to the public losing trust in Dent, helping chaos spread through Gotham. After discovering how the Children of Arkham were hacking into his network, Batman was forced to decide whether to stop them or defeat Dent and his enforces. Depending on the decision made, the following possibilities occur.
