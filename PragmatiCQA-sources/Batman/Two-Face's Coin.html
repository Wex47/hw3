The coin has often been used by Dent to decide whether his actions will be good or for bad. In recent years, Two-Face has become increasingly reliant on the coin to make his decisions, something that both

   In Pre-Crisis continuities, the coin once belonged to mob boss
   Sal Maroni
   as his lucky coin. After lawyer Harvey Dent was disfigured by the mobster throwing acid in the face with acid, he took Maroni's lucky double-headed coin and defaced it. As Two-Face, he would flip the coin dictates Dent when making any significant life decisions. If the coin lands on the scarred side, Two-Face will pursue acts of evil. If the coin lands on the unmarked side, he is compelled to commit acts of good.
  </p>
  <p key="4b58939b-81d0-4767-9cc1-8a38253f3b3f">
   In Post-Crisis stories, the coin once belonged to Harvey Dent's father before it entered his possession. Using it, he would decide whether a young Harvey would be beat or not - the coin always landing on heads. When Dent obtained the coin, he learned that it was double-headed, leading to a mental breakdown. Harvey also had the coin in his possession during Maroni's trial and it, like him, was defaced by the acid.
  </p>
  <p key="698f152f-240b-4c09-b37c-c545d8a2c163">
   Two-Face often defers to his coin in choices of life and death, to the point that he will rely on the coin even if the subsequent flip jeopardizes his own plans. He once collaborated with the Joker and the Penguin to poison Batman, but when Robin suggested a coin-toss to decide the final outcome of the plan, Two-Face  attacked the Penguin to get the antidote. During No Man's Land, Two-Face put James Gordon on trial for his 'illegal' alliance with Two-Face during an earlier plan to protect Gordon's territory, but when
   Renee Montoya
   noted that Gordon needed a defense, Two-Face tossed a coin to confirm that Harvey Dent would act as Gordon's defense lawyer, Dent's cross-examination of himself leading to Gordon's acquittal.
  </p>
  <p key="3d1a64dd-3768-4497-95f5-b8c546976f9d">
   At one point, Two-Face was so dependent on the coin for any of his criminal acts that he could be easily defeated by taking the coin away from him or preventing him from seeing the result of the flip. Harvey Kent (Earth-Two) was usually shown at this level of dependency. Dent has since lessened his dependency on the coin flip to whether a situation should be implemented, rather than each individual act; for example, during
   <i key="2c731155-d344-46d0-865d-9e4858ce5cc2">

   , he set up a plan where he would disrupt all criminal records of those currently awaiting full sentencing, but still relied on a coin toss to decide whether he put the plan into action by flicking the final switch or not even after setting everything up for the plan to go into action.

   and their gang would respond to the threat of the
   vampire
   Batman

   James Gordon
   and
   Alfred Pennyworth
   , the villains were apparently able to shoot Batman with a wooden arrow during a confrontation in the Batcave, but after Batman was presumed dead, Two-Face turned on Gordon and Alfred, explaining that this was what the coin-toss meant (With this in mind, it suggests that Two-Face always planned an alliance as the only solution to the vampire Batman and the coin-toss just determined whether he would honor the alliance afterwards or betray his 'allies' immediately).

However, as the criminal sunk to his watery grave, the coin landed one last time in his open hand, with the unscarred side up.

   flipped his own two-headed coin whenever he had to make a decision. Before his accident, Harvey Dent used the coin to trick criminals into confessing, such as when he kidnapped
   Thomas Schiff
   and informed him, "Heads, you get to keep your head. Tails, not so lucky". But because both sides were heads, Dent never killed. After Dent's accident that turned him into Two-Face, one side of the coin was badly burnt while the other side was fine. Two-Face then used the coin to actually decide whether his target would live or die. Dent stated that the coin was a keepsake from his deceased father, which he implied was also the reason that he managed to ask

   novelization
   expanded a bit on the coin's backstory, where it was revealed to have been used in a manner similar to the comics' rendition of Dent's childhood as a means for his father to give his son a beating (with the coin always choosing in favor of having him beaten due to its double-headed nature). Dent's father's status as a former cop also prevented anyone from reporting to the authorities of his evident child abuse, which consequentially led to Dent's severe hatred for corrupt cops, especially the ones in
   Commissioner Gordon

    Some viewers have decried that in live-action movies, Two-Face wasn't dependent enough on the coin to make his decisions, and if the coin dictated that he couldn't kill his target, then he'd find a way around it. For example, when Two-Face met
    Sal Maroni
    in his car and the coin dictated that Maroni couldn't be shot, Two-Face shot
    his driver
    instead, and caused Maroni to possibly die in the following car crash. Two-Face may have already thought ahead, however, and ensured that Maroni would live but would be severely injured and possibly be unable to inform anyone of his actions.
