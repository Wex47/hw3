Using her acrobatic training, an arsenal of gadgets (many disguised as feminine makeup products and jewelry), and money inherited from a late relative, Kathy debuted as the Batwoman. It was suggested that she was extremely infatuated with Batman to the point that she assumed the costumed identity in order to get close to him and hopefully engage in an emotional relationship with him. It worked but not quite in the way she had hoped, as the Batman wanted her to retire from the role for fear that she would be hurt in her costumed exploits.
