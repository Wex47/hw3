   Once Gotham's District Attorney, Harvey Dent worked to arrest and convict
   Sal Moroni
   , a prominent mobster in the city. During a trial, he questioned mob boss
   Sal Moroni
   in court. Unknown to anyone, Moroni managed to smuggle a hidden flask of acid into the court and threw it on Dent. Though able to protect the right side of his face in time, the acid splashed against the left side of Dent's face and horribly disfigured it. Batman had learned about the plot, but arrived too late to save him.
  </p>
  <p key="d2ccc1a3-67e7-4bae-a51c-4cc0287571c1">
   According to news reports, the acid burned far enough through Dent's head that part of his brain was damaged. This damage made him develop a second personality that psychotic and homicidal, who was dubbed "Two-Face". Going on a crime spree, Dent was eventually arrested by Batman and committed to
   Arkham Asylum
   .

   Two-Face escaped from his cell on the second anniversary of his arrest, and his escape was discovered by
   Dr. Burton
   , who then contacted the
   GCPD
   . Two-Face and
   his thugs
   robbed the Second Bank of Gotham. They took hostages and looked like they were going to get away when Batman intervened and stopped the robbery. Two-Face trapped him and a guard inside an acid filled safe, but Batman escaped and saved the horrified guard. Batman pursued Two-Face by boarding his helicopter. However, Two-Face escaped before he crashed his helicopter into the

   Two-Face traveled to the circus looking for Batman. The circus held a fundraiser that was attended by Gotham's elite, and Two-Face concluded that the odds were excellent that at least one of them knew The Dark Knight's identity if they weren't Batman himself-, and he threatened to blow the place up unless his enemy turned himself over (although the subsequent riot in the circus prevented Bruce Wayne from obeying his order). Two-Face was responsible for the origin of
   Robin
   because, when a family of acrobats known as the
   Flying Graysons
   tried to stop him, they were all killed by him apart from Dick, the youngest Grayson, who went on to join Batman as Robin after he stopped his bomb.
  </p>
  <p key="2add8f72-590e-4176-a0dd-ea7b2aa88681">
   At his hideout, Two-Face met Edward Nygma, who adopted the mantle of the

    Riddler
   </a>
   , where Two-Face initially wanted to kill him for invading his lair, but the Riddler stated his case, and Two-Face decided via coin flip whether he killed or allied with him. After his coin landed on heads, Two-Face stole enough money to fund Nygma's company, and the two gained knowledge through
   the Box
   and discovered Batman's true identity at Nygma's party. Following that, they traveled to
   Wayne Manor
   and the Riddler
   destroyed
   the
   Batcave
   . Two-Face, on the other hand, had his henchmen attack Bruce and Dr.
   Chase Meridian
   while he flipped his coin, which kept landing on the good side, and prevented him from doing any wrongdoing. As soon as the scarred side came up, Two-Face fired his pistol at Wayne, which grazed him in the head. Two-Face wished to finish him off, but the Riddler intervened, then they left, kidnapped Dr. Meridian, and left behind a riddle.

   , where Two Face hid, Batman and Robin got separated. Robin had the opportunity to kill Two-Face, but didn't want to be like him. Two-Face used that to capture Robin. Two-Face and the Riddler then tried to make Batman choose between Chase and Robin, but Batman destroyed The Box, which permanently defeated the Riddler, and saved them both. Two-Face showed up, and was poised to kill them, but Batman reminded him of his coin. Two-Face flipped his coin to decide if he would shoot Batman, but Batman tossed a handful of identical coins into the air. Two-Face panicked and tried to find his coin but stumbled and fell into the pit on a watery bed of spikes. His exact coin then fell good side up into Two-Face's open palm before he sunk underwater, dead.

   broke into Arkham Asylum's storage room. It was unclear if it had been left over from his last escape or taken into storage after his defeat. Some also speculated that he had survived his fall and was captured, the suit being confiscated after being committed.

   Two-Face's design was originally going to be more graphic, with a bulging eyeball and exposed teeth on the left side.
   Rick Baker
   wanted to portray these iconic qualities early in the design process. However, these were quickly vetoed to make the film more family friendly.

   According to Jones, he'd accepted the role as a request from his children, who wanted him to star in a superhero movie. According to Schumacher, he'd also been difficult behind the scenes and not gotten on with Riddler actor
   Jim Carrey
   . Carrey claimed he'd tried to meet him behind the scenes, where the actor had told him "I hate you. I really don't like you. I cannot sanction your buffoonery".

   In a deleted scene, Two-Face would have captured a guard whilst escaping Arkham and used him in his place, leaving a message written in blood. The scene in question would have followed
   Dr. Burton
   as he discovered this. The scene was cut from the final film, likely due to concerns about how dark it was and the attempt to make it more family friendly.

    "Harvey Two-Face" played up the "two" gimmick to the point where Two-Face even referred to himself in the plural, except for two instances when he said: "I'll call you dead, is more like it!" in response to the Riddler's introduction when he broke into his hideout, and in the film's climatic showdown, when he told Robin: "I'll see you in Hell." while he hung on the edge of a cliff. The other "two" themes of half white and half black were: his hideout; his guns (one automatic and one revolver); his suit, and his two molls Sugar and Spice.
