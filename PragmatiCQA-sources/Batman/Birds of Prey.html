   During the One Year Later period Black Canary has made an exchange with Lady Shiva. Dinah undergoes the same training as Shiva and Shiva will fill Dinah's spot as an agent on the team. The Crime Doctor is turning on the Secret Society of Super Villains and they've sent Killer Croc, Clayface, and the Ventriloquist to take him out. Huntress holds them off until Lady Shiva can get their. Shiva then destroys Scarface, and breaks Croc's legs and an arm. The Crime Doc is badly injured and is taken to a hospital. Dinah arrives at an unknown location and meets a woman only referred to as Mother. A bag is swung over Dinah's head and she is beaten unconscious by a group of men. In the hospital Gypsy is introduced. She is a metahuman with the ability to become invisible as well as make other objects invisible. When Dinah recovers she faces off with the men and this time beats them all down. She also meets a little girl named Sin. Sin followers her around and refers to her as "Sister".

   HIVE Agents are sent as a distraction and the injured Crime Doctor is captured by Prometheus, a villain with the martial arts skills of the 30 deadliest fighters programed into his helmet. Mother tells Dinah an army is coming to destroy the village and kill it's population. Dinah tries to warn the people but they don't listen and seem prepared to die. Afraid to embrace Shiva's world she compromises and blends Shiva's world and her own. The Birds arrive at Prometheus' location and ready themselves to rescue the Crime Doc. Black Canary single handedly fights back the entire army and earns a bit of respect from Mother. Dinah learns that Sin will take her place as the new Lady Shiva should she leave. Shiva takes on Prometheus and is knocked out in one well placed punch. The rest of them attack cautiously. Black Canary meets with Mother to tell her that she's leaving and she's taking Sin with her. After slapping and kicking her in the face she demands a phone.

   The fight with Prometheus ends with the Crime Doctor taking his own life. Without him Prometheus has nothing to fight for and leaves. Now Mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen helps Dinah get Sin into the country legally and the girl is introduced to the team. Black Alice has the attention of the Secret Society of Super Villains and they send Talia al Ghul, Felix Faust and Barbara Minerva, the Cheetah, to persuade her into joining them. The Birds go to her house to intercept. Black Alice is very wary of people and doesn't like metahumans around her father. When the Birds of Prey arrive all hell breaks loose and after stealing the magic of someone from the Wonder Woman Family, she attacks. A red haired Batgirl saves a couple from a group of thugs. Alice grows more angry the longer the fight goes. She gets away from them and Faust tracks her magic trail to an airport hangar. He explains they've made a deal with Neron and presents Alice's dead mother. Her mother is unable to speak and Faust promises he will return her voice once Alice joins them. Black Alice's dad is there and he tells her it's not her mother and to get away from her. The Birds arrive as well and another fight breaks out. Tired of all of this Black Alice steals both Felix Faust's and Cheetah's magics and banishes them from all from Dayton, Ohio where she lives with her dad. The weapons dealer from Istanbul, Yasemin, is released from prison and wants revenge. Barbara is worried about Dinah raising Sin with the lifestyle she leads. Dinah wonders if she should leave the team.

   Curious about this new Batgirl, Gypsy, Huntress, Black Canary and Josh, a friend of the team, stage a sting operation. Josh pretends to rob Gypsy and soon after Batgirl comes to the rescue. They spring the trap but Batgirl makes quick work of Gypsy and calls Huntress by her first name then announces she's the damn Batgirl. Both Dinah and Huntress can't stop her and she even manages to land a punch on Black Canary while she is distracted. Hanging from a fire escape now she sees that Yasmin has a rifle targeted at Huntress and teleports in front of the bullet taking the shot. Yasemin speeds away and Batgirl teleports in behind Oracle with a big hug suggesting they spend more time together. Huntress and Black Canary chase Yasemin and call for Oracle's help but she's busy with Batgirl. Whoever the new Batgirl is she doesn't show up on the motion detectors which Oracle says can detect Martian Manhunter when he's really making himself scarce. Barbara and Batgirl fight and during the course of it Batgirl mentions her mother is a movie star and they live in a big mansion. She wants to be friends with Oracle and states she is the most popular girl in school. They stop fighting and Barabara shows Batgirl pictures of the recently deceased Spoiler.

   Yasemin threatens Helena's kids at the school where she works. Huntress takes her by surprise on the roof and beats the hell out of her to show her threats like that have consequences. Yasemin promises to leave the kids alone after Helena threatens to drop her ten stories if she doesn't. Oracle convinces Batgirl to give up the cowl. She refuses to give up being a superhero and jumps out the window. Dinah finally decides to leave the team and says her good byes to Barbara and Helena. Zinda cries her eyes out. With Black Canary's departure from the team Oracle sends a team invitation to several superheroines including, Dr. Light, Hawkgirl, Power Girl, and Wonder Woman. Their first mission without the Canary involves breaking an innocent girl out of a Mexican prison. Her father is the head of a powerful west coast mob and his enemies framed her. Oracle uses several new agents in her plan to break out Tabby Brennan, the girl. Kate Spencer (Manhunter), Big Barda, and Judomaster are all in on the mission. Katarina Armstrong known better as the Spy Smasher is aware of the mission and looks to take Oracle's team down.

   After rescuing the girl they bring her and her father back to America with the Aerie Two. Spy Smasher has sent a group of American Fighter jets with orders to shoot them down. Barda takes down one jet but the rest are too much and the Aerie Two is destroyed. Barda transports them all to a beach using her Mother Box. Manhunter has ulterior motives for being in Mexico and stays behind for another mission to rescue a group of metahumans from the same prison. Spy Smasher sends Lois Lane after Barbara and gets to the agents waiting to pick up Mr. Brennan. In exchange for rescuing his daughter he agreed to turn states evidence. Zinda radios Oracle who is busy but the new Batgirl answers and is now calling herself Misfit. Manhunter is beaten by a large metahuman guard. Misfit teleports in to help the team and starts a firefight by mistake. Manhunter beats up all of the guards watching her with a little help from her partner, Gypsy.

   Mr. Brennan is shot and his daughter has run away from the gunfire. Oracle returns from her dinner with Lois and learns Misfit teleported 3,000 miles from Metropolis to the West Coast which according to her is unfathomable. The team tracks Tabby to a limo with two dead D.E.O. Agents. Huntress suspects She shot her father and it's almost confirmed when she wonders aloud what it will be like running her father's mob. Manhunter and Gypsy shut down the metahuman trafficking ring. After Spy Smasher threatens Barbara's father Oracle agrees to work for her. Barbara informs Helena on the Aerie One immediately following the Tabby Brennan incident. Misfit is holding a tray for Barda to put the bullets she picks out of herself in. Oracle wants them to drop Misfit off and then pick up supplies for their mission in Baku, the capitol city of the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijani. They are after a man named General Feodor Kerimov for massive drug importation and human trafficking, among other things, throughout Europe and the Americas. Creote is a former soldier of the General's and they use him as an in at the General's party.

   The General is showing some sort of item soon and has hired the Secret Six as guards. Knockout, Scandal Savage, Deadshot, and Catman are all inside with the crowd while Ragdoll waits in a car outside. Helena dances with Catman but that ends after he licks her neck. She flings meatballs at him afterwards. The General delivers a speech and reveals he is selling a Rocket Red Suit. Knockout recognizes Barda as they are both warriors from Apokolips so Barda clocks her in the face, grabs the Suit and jumps out of a window. The team flees in a van with the Six, minus Scandal, on their tails. Oracle has Hawkgirl standing by to help and Kendra smashes the car driven by the Secret Six. Scandal speeds by on a motorcycle continuing the chase. Inside the van Barda picks open the Rocket Red Suit and they fin Ice inside. She was thought dead for a while and Oracle along wth the rest of the team is pretty surprised.

   In a dark basment the General slits a mans throat hoping to soon resurrect Rasputin. The Secret Six's newest member, Harley Quinn, arrives with a stolen car as their ride. Hawkgirl grabs Scandal off of the motorcycle and brings her in the air. Scandal punches and slashes at her and they crash to the ground and begin to fight. The rest of the team makes to the rendezvous which is an old barn. Spy Smasher's guy greets them and takes them in. Ice is sort of regaining consciousness and Barda carries her inside. Things soon get out of hand and end up in a standoff with Huntress and Barda against Katarina and Manhunter. Before anyone can make a move, the Generals men show up along with the Secret Six. They've captured Hawkgirl and demand a fight. The Six want Ice back but instead Barda suits up and attacks them tackling Knockout. Misfit bounces in and pesters Barbara. Oracle agrees they will have to fight their way out. Barda takes Knockout while Spy Smasher faces Deadshot. Misfit does the math and realizes the numbers aren't fair so she teleports all the way there and starts a fight with Harley Quinn. Manhunter and Ragdoll go at it and Huntress battles with Catman leaving Hawkgirl and Scandal to pick up where they left off earlier.

   They all fight for a time and Deadshot ends up shooting Scandal in the back by mistake. Creote has been left to watch Ice and he's trying to wake her up by slapping her repeatedly. Huntress and Catman fall down a small hill and she lands on him. After flirting for a second she stabs him in the leg with two crossbow bolts. Hawkgirl is now tending to Scandal. Ice finally wakes up and is angry. The snow swirls and she projects her image through a huge icewoman demanding to know who murdered her. Catman and Huntress call a truce and she helps him to his feet and up the hill. The rest of them though keep fighting even with Ice's giant ice creature threatening to kill them all. Helena and Catman talk some sense into their teams and everyone stops fighting except for Barda and Knockout.

   The General has ordered Rocket Reds to burn everything and everyone in the area and they've arrived to do so. The Birds and the Six team up to stop them. The General shows up to try and control Ice but Deadshot shoots him in the head. The Birds get a ride from Lady Blackhawk who has apparently stolen a van and the teams go their separate ways. Barda and Knockout shake hands. Spy Smasher is angry Zinda disobeyed orders by coming there and she fires her. Zinda punches Katarina in the face while telling her to go to hell. Lady Blackhawk says she'll walk and disappears in the woods. On the flight back home Huntress has some words with Katarina. Once back Oracle challenges Spy Smasher to a fight with the winner getting control over everything. Barbara seems to win but Kat threatens prison and states that all of her operatives belong to her as she exits to the roof. Once through the door Helena is waiting with a rooftop full of heroes that have Oracles back. The entire Birds of Prey plus Wildcat, Metamorpho, Nightwing, Catwoman, Power Girl, and even Lady Shiva are there along with some others. Black Canary showed up as well an ushers Kat to a helicopter threatening to undo her if she bothers any of them again. Afterwards the four core members sit around eating Chinese food. Barbara asks which one of them invited Shiva and they thought she did. Dinah and Helena go dancing while Zinda and Barabara run a little errand. One of the few useful things Katarina did was leave Oracle a file with information in it. An address that leads them to a condemned burnt out building where Misfit lives. The stuff about her being rich and popular was a lie. She's homeless and poor. Oracle learns her real name is Charlotte Gage-Radcliffe and then invites her to come live with her.
