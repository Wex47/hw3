   Bruce dismissed the possibility that the fabled Court of Owls exists, not thinking them much of the threat. He refused to entertain the notion that there was some ancient organization pulling the strings of Gotham, as he believed no one knows the city better than he does. However, during a meeting with Gotham mayoral candidate

   , he was warned by Lincoln that an ancient evil has come back to Gotham, awakened by the ambitious new plans for the city that Bruce had been promoting. Almost immediately,
   Talon
   burst from an elevator, leaving two deceased security guards in his wake. After plunging a knife in Lincoln's chest, the Talon attacked Bruce. The Talon managed to stab Bruce multiple times, and despite eventually getting his arm around Talon's neck, Bruce was unable to choke the assassin out, despite applying more than enough force. Bruce was stunned from the thought that the Talon would not go down, even after he applied more than ten times the force required to crush a human windpipe. Talon threw Bruce out the window of

   , and jumped after him, claiming that he "loves killing Waynes". Bruce managed to catch a gargoyle on his way down, shaking off the Talon who hit the street below. EMT's picked up the seemingly dead body, but a short time later, the Talon's body came back to life, killing the people disposing of him into a morgue and further reinforcing the notion that the Talon is immortal.

   Later, as Batman, Bruce sought answers as to how the Talon found his way into Old Wayne Tower. Accosting a group of Ukrainian criminals called the "Whisper Gang" in the subway, he beat them all up and demanded to know how the Talon entered the Tower, as the section of the rail lines that they controlled was the only possible secret route into the building. After an altercation with half a dozen other members, The Whisper Gang member remaining in Batman's presence could not give Bruce any answer as to how anyone could have entered the tower. After narrowly escaping from a trap in one of the Court's ancient bases, Bruce exhumed the body of his ancestor

   . Alan was deathly afraid of owls in the last years of his life, many people considered him paranoid. He was suspected to have been killed by the Court of Owls as he had ranted about owls hunting him in the days leading up to his death. However, no one believed him at the time, dismissing his fears as the effects of senility. As Batman, he enters the sewer system to investigate the spot where Alan's body was found, and while his back was turned the Talon suddenly appeared and pounced.

   The Talon held Bruce captive in a giant maze constructed by the Court for over a week, during which time Bruce had no food but only a constant supply of drugged water from a fountain, which caused him to have vivid, disturbing hallucinations. He desperately tried to find a way out of the maze while the Talon watched him from the shadows. Upon finding a weak tile on the floor, he ripped it out and entered a room filled with pictures of Batman. He screams "I'm not listening! I'm not listening to you!" while the Talon slowly walked up to him and impaled him from behind with a sword. While the battered and bleeding Bruce crawled across the floor of the labyrinth, the Talon looked up to the Court and asks them how they wished to see Batman die. The youngest member tells Talon "Hurt him......more", so the assassin proceeded to thrash Bruce, finally kicking him through a wall and leaving him for the Court to tear apart. Weakened and close to succumbing, Bruce contemplated surrendering to his fate and meeting his end at the hands of the Court. Then he spotted a broken portrait of his ancestor Alan Wayne. The terror in Alan's expression fills Bruce with a potent burst of rage and anger, and he leaped back on his feet. The Talon was amused by his defiance and walked up to end him, but Bruce charged at him and violently beat him around the labyrinth. After beating him unconscious, Bruce used the potassium chlorate in a nearby camera to trigger an explosion that dropped him into the river as an escape route. The members of the Court walk up to the Talon's unconscious form and one of their leaders (an elderly woman) decided to have him disposed of since it's unlikely he would recover psychologically from the beating he received at Batman's hands. She then turned to the room filled with caskets, all filled with Talons, and gives the order to wake them all up for the war against Batman.
