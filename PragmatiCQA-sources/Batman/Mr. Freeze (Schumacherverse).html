   Dr. Victor Fries was a two time Olympic decathlete and a very well known scientist, who won the Nobel Prize in the field of molecular biology. He tried to cure his wife, Nora, (to whom he was deeply devoted) from a terminal illness that was called
   MacGregor's Syndrome
   that would eventually kill her. Victor placed Nora in an experimental cryogenic tank of his own invention, and hoped to keep her in suspended animation until he could find a cure. He continued his research on the disease while his wife endured her frozen slumber, and even managed to cure the disease in its early stages, but still worked on the advanced case that Nora contracted. During an experiment, an explosion caused Victor to fall into a vat of his machine's cryo-fluid that was fifty degrees below zero. Victor somehow survived, but the chemicals mutated his body and left him incapable of surviving outside of temperatures below the freezing point. Victor developed a special cryosuit that used diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees. He then took on the persona of Mr. Freeze.

   Freeze hid out at the
   Snowy Cones Ice Cream Factory
   and began a life of crime in a continued effort to cure Nora. Freeze began to rob museums of large diamonds, and planned to use them to create a deadly device that he called his "

    freezing engine
   </i>
   ", a device so powerful that it would create a giant
   Freeze Gun
   . He would then freeze Gotham and hold it ransom for billions, which would allow him to complete his research for Nora's cure. Freeze was pursued by
   Batman
   and
   Robin
   , but managed to steal a diamond after he froze Robin, and warned Batman that he had eleven minutes to thaw him out before he would freeze to death. Freeze spared Batman, but threatened to kill him the next time that he tried to stop him, and escaped with the diamond.
  </p>
  <p key="b0825e6c-408f-484a-90d8-102fc5c2a5a4">
   At his hideout, Freeze watched his past before his accident. Freeze was then interrupted by one of his thugs,
   Frosty
   , who held a newspaper and told him that he wanted him to see, but Freeze froze him, and commented: "
   <i key="145a9fed-a8af-45ed-a648-b35e466def60">
    I hate when people talk during the movie

   At a rainforest costume party that used a large diamond necklace to help raise money for charity, Freeze returned and stole it.

  <p key="ccfda5d9-3de2-407d-9699-d3edc0b21e5e">
   Batman and Robin followed Freeze, captured him, and imprisoned him at
   Arkham Asylum
   . Stripped of his cryosuit, Freeze could no longer survive outside of his specially designed cell, and was rendered incapable of escape.
  </p>
  <p key="e3eb4640-26a2-4c1a-8cce-1eacd09e5fbc">
   While at Arkham, Freeze carved an ice statue of Nora in order to have some solace; he missed her deeply and wished that he was still with her.

   Freeze was then broken out of Arkham by
   Poison Ivy
   and
   Bane
   . Ivy had witnessed Freeze's attack at the party and was impressed at his skills.
  </p>
  <p key="976ec6b4-b179-4460-8f5e-a44bc17263a4">
   They returned to Freeze's hideout where Ivy and Bane distracted the Dynamic Duo (who learned of Freeze's escape) while Freeze retrieved his energy diamonds and weapons, and told Ivy to bring his wife back to him.
  </p>
  <p key="348378f6-38f1-4227-8d02-b4e7ba371222">
   However, Ivy betrayed Freeze by disconnecting the cable to the cryo tank that kept Nora alive. Later, at Ivy's hideout, the
   Turkish Bath House
   , Freeze took refuge there and froze one of the rooms for his survival. As soon as he saw Ivy, Freeze asked her if she had retrieved his wife. Ivy told him Batman had deactivated Nora and that she was dead. Freeze angrily refused to believe Ivy until she showed him Nora's special snowflake necklace that he had given to her as a gift. He was deeply grieved and shed a small tear that suddenly froze and blew away in the cold air. Freeze's sorrow then turned to rage and he swore vengeance on Batman, and, at Ivy's urging, humanity itself. Freeze thus decided to continue his plan to freeze Gotham and kill its population. Ivy continued to cause chaos in the partnership between Batman and his sidekick by seducing Robin with the
   Batsignal
   , modified to project his red bird emblem in an attempt to get rid of the Dynamic Duo once and for all. During this time, Freeze began to put his plan into action.
  </p>
  <p key="384353be-cb73-48e0-8228-130d440d2479">
   Freeze went with Bane to the
   Gotham Observatory
   to use its powerful telescope to create a giant Freeze Gun. On his arrival, Freeze froze lead scientist, Dr. Lee and his assistant, left them to die, and began his plan to freeze Gotham. Knowing Batman would likely arrive, Freeze had Bane plant bombs around the telescope room that resembled glowing icicles as a contingency plan.

    Batgirl

   , arrived at the observatory in special costumes that nullified freeze blasts. By this time Freeze had already frozen most of Gotham's population, and left them with only eleven minutes to thaw the whole city. Freeze sent Bane to deal with Robin and Batgirl while he engaged in physical combat with Batman. When given the opportunity, Mr. Freeze made no attempt to fire his rifle at Batman, likely deducing that his new costume was designed to withstand it like his new vehicles. A fierce battle ensued between Batman and Freeze for control of the telescope, which ended with Freeze being knocked off the telescope platform and the destruction of his freezing engine.
  </p>
  <p key="7e14db6b-595b-4f78-8b21-d65907c708a8">
   But Freeze wasn't defeated easily, and, with one last ounce of strength, detonated the icicle bombs that were placed around the telescope, causing the surrounding structure to explode. The telescope crashed straight through the walls to the ground far below in one last attempt to destroy Batman and avenge his wife. In doing so, Freeze fell fifteen feet to the ground below, and broke his helmet with the impact of the fall. Batman survived the fall along with the two scientists who were thawed out and clung onto the telescope for dear life. After he set the two scientists down safely on the ground, Batman went after Robin and Batgirl who defeated Bane. They headed back to the observatory and even though the clock hit midnight, finally found a way to thaw Gotham by using the satellites; the population was then restored to normal.

   With Freeze lying amid the wreckage of the telescope structure and weakened by the heat, he was confronted by Batman, who responded to Freeze's order to kill him like he killed Nora. Batman revealed a recording in which Ivy admitted that she had pulled the plug on Nora's equipment. As Freeze roared in rage, Batman revealed that his wife was not dead; she had her systems restored and was still alive.
  </p>
  <p key="8d051517-e94e-4d09-8b26-c56628bb6d6a">
   As Freeze sobbed in relief at the news, Batman solemnly reminded him that vengeance was not power as anyone could take life, but

   life was a power that only a few people possessed, including Victor. With that in mind, Batman asked Freeze to help him save another life by sharing the cure for the first stages of Nora's illness (specifically, to save Bruce Wayne's friend and butler,
   Alfred Pennyworth
   , who was dying from stage one of the disease).
  </p>
  <p key="d77571e2-7b6a-43e3-b3ac-81a2037ea6e3">
   Deeply moved by Batman's assurance that the man his wife loved was still inside him, Freeze complied and gave him two vials that contained the antidote with the words: "
   <i key="697b57df-f99d-464a-8dc2-230e80e156e5">
    Take two of these and call me in the morning"

   . Batman gratefully took them from him. Although Freeze was still sent back to Arkham Asylum, Batman promised that he would move Nora to the lab at Arkham so that he could continue his research for a cure.

   Mr. Freeze was an expert in cryogenics and engineering. As a scientist, Freeze had a very intelligent mind. He had previously been a two-time Olympic decathlete and continued to maintain above average muscle mass throughout his life. As a criminal, he was very resourceful and a cunning strategist. The accident that mutated his body has given him the vital weakness of being unable to survive in a temperate environment, which he has overcome with technology.

The suit also doubled as highly durable body armor, gunfire having no effect. It had a flight pack with glider wings which allowed him to fly, a special pair of goggles were worn while skydiving under the armor's headpiece. The cryosuit has many hidden compartments and controls such as to check the gauge of the suit's cooling system, detonate icicle bombs, carry chemical vials etc.

Freeze could use this to makes walls and objects brittle, easily smashed with his power armor and vehicle. Additionally, Freeze kept smaller freeze guns in his vehicles and laboratory. Gigantic freeze guns could be made using a hi-tech
