   As a child, Lawton idolized his brother. When his mother convinced his brother to kill their father, his brother locked Floyd outside. Floyd, wishing to save his brother from a grim future, took a rifle to shoot the gun out of his brother's hand. He was sitting in the tree branch when it broke and Floyd accidentally shot his brother in the head. Lawton inadvertently kills the brother he loves to save the father he hated.

   . He strived to die in a spectacular way, the main reason he joined the Squad. He feels he has no reason to continue living, and, while he does not want to commit suicide, he simply does not care if he dies. Various reasons have been cited for this, but the most common thread in them is his parents' peculiar hatred for one another, so much so that Lawton's mother tried to hire both her sons to kill their father. During a hiatus from the Squad, his son was murdered by a pedophile, upon whom Deadshot later took revenge.

   Deadshot's death wish has been curtailed somewhat in recent years by the discovery that he has a daughter, Zoe, who lives with her mother in Star City. His personality has also been influenced by his involvement with the mercenary group known as the Secret Six. Founded in protest of the massive villain group known as the Society, the Secret Six were originally gathered by Lex Luthor (under the alias of Mockingbird). Since then, they have gone into business for themselves. Deadshot has formed a reluctant bond with his fellow members of the Six, particularly

   Captain Boomerang
   , who was given the trigger for the bombs in the Squad member's heads by Waller as insurance should the Squad betray him. This is proved a ruse in the next issue when the trigger fails to work, and that Boomerang's involvement in the Squad was simply a bargaining tool as he had killed the friend of a terrorist sect leader whom the Squad infiltrated to capture one of their scientists. Upon returning to Belle Reeve, the Squad is put in isolation and Harley Quinn orchestrates a massive breakout and the remaining four members of the Squad put down the revolt, though Yo-Yo is 'killed' by King Shark in the process. As a reward, Deadshot earned a visit with his daughter, but Waller ends the meeting early to have him head to Gotham and capture Harley Quinn with a new Squad, she is assembling.

   When going after Harley Quinn, Harley has both the squad and the GCPD after her, only to have both groups clash. With Limelight's help, King Shark is portrayed as Clayface, terrorizing the GCPD, while the rest of the squad apprehend Harley. However, Harley takes out Deadshot and Savant, only to have Deadshot tied up with Joker's face on him. Meanwhile, Limelight lose their power and are near to being captured, only to have Lime close to telling the truth. Lime dies as Waller pushes the button, blowing her head. Harley, deranged, tries to Joker through Deadshot, while Deadshot plays along, telling her to kill the Bat family. Enamored, she runs to him, only to be shot in the stomach.

   , go on to retrieve Resurrection Man. However, his powers are too great, and the team shatter, only to have Light and Deadshot find a way out. Light complains about Waller killing her sister, only to avenge her sister. However, shielding himself from Resurrection Man, Deadshot uses Light and apparently kills her. He goes away, saying if anyone going to kill Waller, it will be him. Deadshot and the team face off against Resurrection Man once again, only to have Waller stop this, by threatening his love. As he powers down, Waller kills him, only to have her staff cut off his hand. The team returns to base, leaving Resurrection Man alone, for now.

Their next mission is to retrieve the information, that Basilik is trying to steal at the Columbia Center, where a member of Basilisk has taken a room full of employees from a bio-tech company called Gendreon hostage. Waller wants the hostage taker alive, not the hostages. However, a low profile is required, in order to avoid attracting the

As it happens, Gendreon's code of ethics is worse in his books than Basilisk's. Angrily, the gunman threatens to blow himself up. Fortunately, Iceberg sneaks up behind him, and freezes his detonator so that it no longer functions. El Diablo follows it up with a punch, and then removes the unconscious Basilisk soldier's poisoned tooth, lest he try to kill himself with that, too.

   The squad receives their orders while riding on a cargo plane. Waller appears on the screen and informs them that new intelligence has given them the location of Basilisk's compound. Their mission will be to assassinate Regulus, the leader. This is despite the fact that the only source of intel that the squad knows of was killed by a Basilisk traitor on the last mission. Waller promises that whoever supplies the kill-shot will have their sentence reduced by half. To facilitate the mission, she has provided backup.

   Unfortunately, one of these new backup members happens to be a Basilisk agent, and she punctures her own nanite bomb, causing the plane to explode with the Suicide Squad inside.

Deadshot doesn't realize it at first, but when he turns around, all of the others are down too. Moments later, he is cracked over the head with a club.

   Fortunately, a team of armed operatives rappels down onto the pyramid, come to the squad's rescue. Surprisingly, though, they are not Waller's men. They are Basilisk, and they are led by Captain Boomerang.

   Boomerang leads the squad to their cells, eventually getting into another verbal altercation with Deadshot. This evolves into a fist fight, but confusingly, Boomerang's demeanour changes, and it becomes clear that he never did convert to Basilisk's beliefs, and has been working as a spy for Waller, all the time. They get the others free, and make an escape, hoping to get out of the compound with the help of Basilisk members whose dissent has grown enough that they would betray Regulus.

   Despite fighting their way to Regulus, the Captain Boomerang is suddenly on the receiving end of a massive shock. They all turn to see that Black Spider has betrayed them. They warn that he will not be able to take them all out, but he has used hypnosis to implant a trigger word in all of the squad except Harley and Deadshot. As he expects to be overpowered, Deadshot warns that Waller will simply send another task force after Basilisk, should Task Force X die.

   With three of the Suicide Squad under the mind control of Basilisk, Black Spider taunts Harley Quinn and Deadshot with their imminent death at the hands of their cohorts. Rather than listen, Deadshot simply shoots their adversary through the head, revealing that this was not Black Spider. The real Black Spider probably hadn't been with the team since they were last at Belle Reve. The real Black Spider would have dodged the bullet.

   Despite their attempts to escape together, Harley and Deadshot are faced with their mind-controlled team-mates. They are forced to find a way to shock them out of it. Harley manages to find a fire-hose, and douse King Shark with water, snapping him out of it. As Iceberg prepares to use his freezing hand against Deadshot, the marksman grabs a sword, and slices it off at the wrist, the pain waking him from his hypnosis. The frozen hand then freezes the flaming El Diablo solid in his spot. With everyone back on-side, Deadshot declares that they should finish their mission to kill Regulus. Fortunately, they will have the help of Captain Boomerang and the freed experimental prisoners of Basilisk to help in that effort.

   Back at the Basilisk Compound, Regulus appears, and begins controlling Harley's mind, causing her to shoot at her teammates. Regulus manages to grab Deadshot from behind and urges Harley to kill him. Before she can make a move, Deadshot simply raises his own weapon, and shoots through his own chest, to kill his target. As Regulus dies, Harley snaps out of it, and rushes to Deadshot's side.
