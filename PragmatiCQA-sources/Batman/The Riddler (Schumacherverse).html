  <p key="59fc52ec-7e20-421f-b2c3-3cdff379d191">
   Edward Nygma became a researcher under the employment of
   Wayne Enterprises
   . He idolized the proprietor Bruce Wayne and had several magazines with his face on them all over his work cubicle. He later developed a device to beam television directly into a person's brain.
   Fred Stickley
   , the head of the research department was not impressed and put a halt on it, terminating the project.
  </p>
  <p key="a4780169-f700-475f-abcc-180d20f299ef">
   When Nygma heard that Bruce Wayne was coming to visit, Nygma was determined to show it to him, so he could have his full permission to make his project a reality. However he didn't get the answer he was hoping for because Bruce was convinced that mind manipulation was too dangerous and would raise too many questions, so he turned the idea down.

  <p key="d76b06c8-3d98-4905-a7e1-864ffcb25934">
   Nygma felt angry and disappointed, but continued to work on it after hours. When Stickley discovered Nygma's clandestine overtime on the invention he had previously terminated, Nygma knocked him unconscious, tied him to a chair and used him to test his device. While Stickley was being mesmerized by his 3D TV, Nygma discovered that he could use it to absorb people's knowledge to become smarter.
  </p>
  <p key="fbdbcafb-23af-4949-b4f1-d422508c992c">
   After finding out what Nygma had done and realizing that Bruce Wayne was right about it being mind manipulation, Stickley was furious and fired Nygma on the spot, but Nygma murdered him by pushing him out of the window to the reservoir below. He then craftily altered the security tapes to make Stickley's death look like a suicide, and then resigned from Wayne Enterprises, deciding to get even with Wayne for rejecting him and become rich and famous himself.

  <p key="edded595-0cc9-4beb-8b97-094e719a7eda">
   Nygma, who stalked Wayne and left riddles for him, was inspired and delighted by watching
   Two-Face
   's raid at the circus on live television and created his own alter-ego in the form of the Riddler, the master of puzzles and quizzes, wearing an emerald green outfit adorned with black question marks and carrying a gold high tech question mark cane. Nygma perfected his brain-manipulation device into a system, "
   The Box
   ", which beamed signals to and from the human brain in order to simulate an immersive television-viewing experience.
  </p>
  <p key="b1836a70-b7bb-4c3b-801a-bb23a4e05f03">
   The device allowed Riddler to read viewers' minds, as well as augment his own intelligence. Using his device, the Riddler found Two-Face at
   his hideout
   , and proposed a deal that would benefit them both: they would mass-produce the brain-manipulation device to become Gotham's clever carbon-based lifeforms and discover Batman's true identity so that they could use it to their advantage to plot out his downfall. Seeing the advantage of the device, Two-Face agreed (due to
   his coin
   flip marking heads in favor of the deal), and they became partners-in-crime in order to fund mass-production of the device. With enough capital to start mass-production of his invention, the Riddler readopted his Edward Nygma identity, opened his own business company that was called
   NygmaTech
   , and sold thousands of his devices to many of Gotham's citizens, who found his inventions very impressive. Nygma then built his corporate headquarters on
   Claw Island
   , which was ten miles away from
   Gotham City
   . With his wealth he secretly began turning the island into a metal fortress with death traps designed to kill Batman. A large control room was built with a throne made of two gold statues of
   <i key="5a57049b-f503-4349-9de6-e53305fb1c33">
    The Thinker

   as arm rests. Above the chair was a much larger version of the green brainwave antenna than the hand-held versions that Two-Face and his molls were permitted to use.
  </p>
  <p key="4b9b5b2a-d5bf-4718-92a2-aaa83fea3add">
   With the Box fad being an overnight success, it allowed NygmaTech to gain overwhelming profit, and the Riddler started to feed on the citizens' minds every time they used his inventions to make himself more intelligent; and he even allowed Two-Face to receive his share of feeding off the citizens' minds, which made Two-Face more intelligent as well. Following his successful marketing of the invention, Nygma hosted a launch event for a set-top version of his device, to which many citizens attended, including Bruce Wayne himself. Nygma convinced an unwitting Bruce to try it, which resulted in Riddler and Two-Face finally discovering his alter ego as Batman, much to their delight.

   On the night of Halloween, Riddler and Two-Face later converged upon
   Wayne Manor
   . While Dent and
   his thugs
   stormed the mansion, Riddler used a device in his cane to find a hidden door and hacked the electronic lock. After walking down the stairwell he discovered a
   large cave
   with Wayne's secret armory and crime lab. Riddler destroyed everything he could see with
   bat shaped bombs
   , this included the
   Batmobile
   and all of his
   black Batman uniforms
   . When Riddler walked back upstairs he found Two-Face about to murder an unconscious Bruce Wayne with a gunshot to the head. Reacting in extreme displeasure, Nygma talked him out of it, emphatic that "

   " Two-Face was reminded of the bigger plans they had for him on the island and agreed. They left a final riddle for Bruce and kidnapped Dr.

   Nygma was drugging the captive Dr. Meridian during this time and taunting her while she was chained to his couch. Riddler tried to impress her with a smoking jacket that had blinking green neon lights, joking that it keeps him safe while jogging at night. Chase told the Riddler that Batman would come for her, but upon expecting to see that he would be scoffing at it, Riddler instead admitted that he was actually counting on Batman to come as part of his plan.

   new sidekick
   driving a
   Batboat

   Batwing

   Riddler-branded scuba guards
   to capture the duo but they failed. After trapping the frogmen in a net and chaining them to a Buoy, the caped crusaders were quickly separated after swimming ashore. Batman fought his way through the Riddler's deadly traps, while Two-Face went to confront Robin on the surface. Robin was tricked by Dent in the fight, who used his boyish empathy against him and Two-Face brought him to the Riddler.

   Meanwhile, Batman finally reached the Riddler, who sat in usual throne, surrounded by obfuscating neon signs and festive light shows. Nygma had also outfitted himself in a new silvery white costume, adorned with glittery rhinestones and emerald green question marks and held a differant high tech cane. Riddler revealed Chase and Robin, who were bound and gagged with duct tape and were imprisoned in large glass containers over a large, and deadly pit of water and metal spikes.

Unable to resist, the Riddler took his hand off of the control on his cane that would drop the two, sat back down on his throne, and listened eagerly, unaware that this would lead to his ultimate undoing. Batman gave his riddle: "

    I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?

Before the Riddler collapsed, he sprung the trap doors in Robin's and Chase's cages, and sent them plummeting to their apparent doom. In defiance of Nygma's sadistic choice, Batman was able to save them both using the

   After tricking Two-Face into falling to his death, Batman returned to the Riddler's destroyed lair and found Edward; his mind enfeebled by the overload of brainwaves and his body was horribly scarred from the explosion. Taking light to his former employee's plight, Batman finally answered Nygma's riddle and said:

   Arkham Asylum
   for his crimes against Gotham, and his company was sunk. Chase was asked to consult on Nygma's case by
   Dr. Burton
   after she was told that he had screamed for hours that he knew who Batman was. After she wondered if the Riddler had indeed remembered the information that was taken from Bruce's brain that concerned Batman's identity, Chase went to his cell. Chase identified herself and then asked Riddler if he remembered her. When he answers affirmatively, the Riddler offered to reveal the identity of Batman to Chase if she said "please". Chase did so, and the Riddler responded by telling her that he

At that point, Chase came out to tell Bruce that his secret was safe, and confirmed that Nygma was now a complete lunatic.
