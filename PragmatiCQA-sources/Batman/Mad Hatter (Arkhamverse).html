    Jervis Tetch

   became obsessed with the story, "Alice in Wonderland" and the incredible ability of controlling a person's mind through hypnosis techniques. After he fashioned himself into the image of the iconic character, the

    Mad Hatter
   </b>
   , Tetch used his expertise in mind control and placed his victims under a hypnotic state in order to recreate them into the other signature characters from his favorite story. Among those characters, none took Tetch's insanity to such ultimate extremes as Alice herself.

  <p key="02eba1b0-f146-406b-be3c-131fcfc85041">
   Looking for young women with blonde hair and blue eyes that matched Alice, Jervis was responsible for the abduction of dozens of young girls, some of whom were children, where he eventually brutally molested and murdered them during a schizophrenic episode. Regardless of how many young girls and women that he abducted and killed, Jervis was always on the lookout for another potential Alice to complete his deluded fantasy of living in a storybook.

   Years later, Jervis became a pivotal pawn to the mad and power crazed Professor
   Hugo Strange
   , who exploited Jervis's amazing mind control experiments to set the stage for
   Quincy Sharp
   's descent into insanity as another unwitting pawn in
   Arkham City
   's construction. Jervis hoped to use his own discoveries in those mind control experiments to finally find his Alice and entrap
   Batman
   within a perpetual state of hypnotic control and serve as the ultimate form of protection for Alice and his gang.

   Not much was known about Jervis Tetch's early life, other than him being a self-claimed inventor, entrepreneur, and part-time haberdasher, and that prior to developing his mind control devices, was constantly ignored. At some point, Tetch became delusional and believed that he was The Mad Hatter from Lewis Carroll's
   <i key="6a0beb37-c962-4dd1-81f5-92e6109594d8">

  <p key="571f71e1-124e-4987-8dd4-93e6adcae49b">
   Shortly after he put the Lacey Towers murder case together, Batman encountered three henchmen in rabbit masks who sung that he was invited to The Mad Hatter's Party. After they collapsed, Batman received a message from the Mad Hatter, which requested him to enter a business proposition with him. However, his attempt at recruiting Batman was interrupted by
   a girl
   , who desperately called for Batman to help her (which made it clear that Mad Hatter had kidnapped her). Mad Hatter then silenced her and told Batman that the girl was "Alice", that she had been through a lot, and promised to make her "right as rain" soon. Batman then headed to Mad Hatter's Lair in the Bowery.

  <p key="ab00bd14-3e58-4e7c-817d-67501253fa49">
   Tetch, who anticipated Batman's arrival, then made final tests on his mind control, and discovered with glee that the devices actually worked, but his henchmen did not address him as "sir" aside. Batman, after he took out the brainwashed henchmen, confronted Tetch about "Alice's" location with the clear intention of rescuing her from his clutches, but Tetch trapped him with his hypnosis by forcing him to look at a clock above them, which made him end up in "Wonderland". Batman managed to navigate through "Wonderland", broke free of Tetch's control, and found him threatening to kill "Alice" with a Knife. Batman then threw a Reverse

  <p key="81cbdfb4-e485-4823-b27f-2544e0677fae">
   Batman then told "Alice" that she was safe, and that she'd be alright as the
   GCPD
   were on their way. However, the girl, who was deeply traumatized by Tetch's actions to her since he kidnapped her to the extent of sobbing uncontrollably, told Batman in a fearful tone that it wouldn't be all right for her. If Batman returned to Tetch's Lair, he noticed that Tetch was still unconscious, and also noticed that the girl still cried after what she went through.

   as part of an assignment. In that continuity, Tetch was a truly deranged figure, who was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of a number of young women whom he saw as incarnations of Alice. He was shown to have a weak perception of reality, denied the murders that he had committed, and used his obsession with mind control and

Tetch exceeded Strange´s expectations and was eventually asked to use his techniques to manipulate Sharp into finalizing plans for Arkham City. To motivate Tetch further, Strange supplied him with a female assistant with a resemblance to Alice, something that Tetch could not resist. Tetch's mind control technology was utilized by Strange to ensure the loyalty of the

When Batman injected himself, he passed out and woke up in the Mad Hatter's Lair in Park Row, strapped to a chair and surrounded by various inmates who wore rabbit masks and were also under the Hatter's control, all a part of The Mad Tea Party. The Hatter revealed that what Batman thought was "the cure" was in fact a hypnotic suggestion that he tricked Batman into taking, then attempted to control Batman with a special mask that resembled a rabbit version of Batman's Cowl that the Hatter had created just for him. Unfortunately for the Hatter, Batman broke through with sheer will, and, after a fight with the Hatter's mind controlled henchmen, eventually defeated him and flattened his hat.

   Due to the illegal nature of Arkham City and Strange's true status and plans that came to light, Tetch was released under the pretense that he did not return to crime. Due to his insane nature, Tetch found himself incapable of resuming his sick inclinations to find 'Alice' and recreate his favorite story. His mind was even more diluted since Arkham City's shutdown and the Hatter went as far as targeted men, abducted them, and dressed them in attire, which included dresses and wigs, in order to resemble Alice.

   . After he took advantage of the chaos that distracted the GCPD and Batman, Tetch abducted
   Officer Katz
   and
   Officer McQueen
   and put them into transient states by sabotaging their police sirens to recite hypnotic sound rhythms, in order to employ mind games against Batman to serve as revenge for spoiling his plans within Arkham City nine months prior and turn him into his new 'Alice'. In order to ensure that he got an audience with Batman and ensure his involvement, the Hatter walked into the GCPD Lockup, got himself deliberately arrested under suspicious circumstances in order to draw Batman out, eventually met with Batman in the Maximum Security West Wing Interrogation Room, and was nearly threatened with death.

   Tetch informed Batman that there were three hostages who were held at separate locations throughout the city and gave him dubious clues for each hostage. At each location, Batman discovered a police vehicle with sirens that blared in a peculiar fashion, and the hostage locked within the trunk, alongside explosives. While Batman was able to dismantle the bombs and rescued the first two hostages, the third vehicle only contained a book, which mockingly detailed Batman within Wonderland. After he contacted
   Aaron Cash
   , it was revealed to Batman that the third hostage had arrived at the GCPD Lockup and that only his vehicle was stolen.

   After he returned back to the GCPD Lockup and the Interrogation Room, Batman demanded that Tech reveal what his true plans were and where the real hostage was. Tetch told Batman to simply open the book and turn the page in order to find the answers to all his questions. Upon doing so however, Batman fell into a deep hypnotic trance, imbued within his consciousness by the odd sound rhythms of the police sirens. Within that hypnotic state, Batman imagined himself fighting in the pop-up pages of the book, all of which were based off the worst nights of his life within Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Halloween.

   Officer Hutch
   , who was also under the hypnotic state and was the third hostage that Tetch had previously referred to. However, Batman was able to keep his resolve intact, broke free of Tetch's control, rescued Officer Hutch from the trance, and finally cornered the Hatter. After Tetch expressed shock and disbelief that he still could not control Batman, Batman forcibly locked the Hatter up within a cell, as Tetch wept uncontrollably and longed for Alice, which served as the final showdown and meeting between Batman and the Mad Hatter. Batman later attempted to inquire about how Tetch had managed to sabotage the police sirens, but Tetch compared his actions to a magician, and refused to answer.

   Jervis Tetch, the Mad Hatter, was delusional. Since his mental breakdown, he became completely wrapped around his schizophrenic confusions and displayed a very unstable, and borderline personality which was prone to violence, mood swings, over-active emotional reactions, and breakdowns. The Hatter displayed a completely typical trait of a low grip on reality, which was commonly related to people with insanity to the point where he that believed fictional characters were alive and genuinely believed that he was the incarnation of the
   <i key="4380cc15-e4af-45e9-9e99-bed6a0d6e3d1">

   haracter, The Mad Hatter. Tetch carried himself as very weak, absent-minded, and frail, but was more dangerous than expected.
  </p>
  <p key="9097c62d-9bd0-4e90-bbeb-76c90faf0809">
   The Hatter had difficulty reserving himself in speech or combat, despite being a scientist. Beforehand, Tetch had an almost childlike personality with little forethought, common sense, nor was he a physical threat and was usually overpowered. Tetch's lack of mental resolve resulted in poor sentence structures which were prone to becoming nonsensical gibbering and he tended to speak in rhymes or sing-song verses and tones in between dialogues, which was a trait that only worsened to where every sentence that he spoke was a rhyme during Scarecrow's occupation. However, the Hatter was smart enough to constantly manufacture his mind control serum, manipulated people under its effect, and hypnotized Batman, the World's Greatest Detective, three times.
  </p>
  <p key="afd9045e-fd99-4dcb-b841-9d2ca141be92">
   Jervis Tetch was an unstable individual, his grips on reality were muddled to say the least to the point where he thought fictional characters were alive. He was ambitious as a scientist, his main thesis in the field of his work was that free will was an illusion and a man's beliefs and loyalties could easily be changed with chemicals and successfully created a mind control serum. Tetch would later use his serum for villainous purposes after his schizophrenic breakdown by forcing people info his servitude. He saw people as puppets and cares very much for manners and excellent behavior, especially at tea parties. He is not incapable of making mistakes, for example he became frustrated when one of his men repeated everything he said while trying to make him refer to the Hatter as "sir" and does not factor in that willpower can break a person out of an hypnotic state, the prime example being Batman.
  </p>
  <p key="bef6e756-2b0f-4f39-a681-feb0a5fbe37f">
   Although he was a scientist beforehand, Tetch has an extremely muddled mind. He is easily confused, almost childlike and has been manipulated with ease in the past. Because of his fragile mental state people are quick to take advantage of him. For example Hugo Strange blackmails him into creating his mind control formula with his stolen hats and dominates him through bribery by feeding his allusions of Alice throughout their therapy sessions. However Tetch was capable of some resistance and was prepared to no longer help Strange but quickly gave in when he saw "Alice".
  </p>
  <p key="0dc94ef9-c450-4260-82ca-12edbdbe542e">
   Despite his schizophrenic delusions, Tetch is at least smart enough to constantly produce his mind control serum and has been able to hypnotize Batman twice, once in Arkham City and even came close to having the Dark Knight break his no-killing rule under heavy toxins. However he has little forethought and is not a physical threat so he's normally overpowered.
  </p>
  <p key="172f0528-7408-458b-962f-4b3770f22bb8">
   Also despite his psychopathic nature, Tetch is capable of expressing emotions which differs him from the rest of Batman's Rogue's Gallery is that he feels regret for his action. When confronted by Strange over Stephanie Williams, an "Alice" that he killed he is unable to recognize her but as Strange insists he is reduced to tears and overcame with genuine sorrow, implying he was not in control of his actions when he had murdered her and hypnotized himself into forgetting. He also began sobbing uncontrollably when Batman crushed his hat, weeping to him "I only wanted a friend."

   Tetch's delusions only worsened as his hunt for Alice continued. He even began abducting males and cross-dressing them in Alice's clothes.

   also implied that Tetch’s delusions became so intense with the fantasy of Wonderland that he became less attached to reality, such as sexuality and gender. His attitude with Batman shows that he cannot tell the difference between a man or a woman, constantly referring to him as “Alice” and even asking for him to snuggle with Tetch in his cell, implying that he sexually abused the Alice’s he abducted though both could be a result of his hallucinations. Tetch’s confusion with reality to fiction is shown by how he believes any blonde-haired woman is inherently Alice and the names of the cops he abducted related to the characters in “Alice in Wonderland” he believed they were (for example Katz as the Cheshire Cat; McQueen as the Red Queen and Hutch as the White Rabbit).

   Psychological Profile: Tetch is a classic delusional who also displays an obsessive ideation based on hats. He believes that he is the true-life incarnation of the Mad Hatter from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Tetch's skills as a hypnotist and his frankly inexplicable talent for inventions involving mind control make him at times a dangerous patient to treat, or they would for a less stable and insightful doctor than myself.
