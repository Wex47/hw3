   (December 1941). One of Batman's oldest foes, the Penguin is often presented as a gentleman of crime, often developing elaborate schemes whilst presenting himself as innocent of many of his activities. An eccentric criminal mastermind, he is well-known for his love of ornithology and use of
   technology-fitted umbrellas
   . More modern depictions have shown him as the manager of the
   Iceberg Lounge
   , a popular nightclub which serves as a front for his illegal financial stature.

   An icon since the Golden Age, the Penguin was a mainstay of Batman's rogues gallery, often paired alongside villains like

   . Elements of the show's depiction would also influence future versions of the character, including more explicit bird-like features and personality quirks. The Penguin is amongst the most well-known Batman villains, appearing or being mentioned in almost every known version of Batman media.

Their rejection drove him to become evil. These are contrasted against the more aggressive and specific wealth gathering origins of the Batman graphic novel

   The Penguin's weapons of choice are the trick-umbrellas he uses to execute his crooked schemes. Several versions of the Penguin's origins say that he was forced as a child to always carry an umbrella around by his over-protective mother due to the fact that his father died of pneumonia after being drenched in a downpour. In keeping with his pretensions of being a refined gentleman, he also prefers to wear formal wear, such as a top hat, tuxedo, and spats during his jobs. The Penguin received his alter-ego from a childhood taunt, bestowed by his peers, who teased him because of his grotesque appearance and love of birds (some re-tellings of his origin suggest he also suffered from some sort of hip ailment, which caused him to waddle when he walked; the Penguin shows no signs of suffering from this affliction today). Some comics suggest that he tried to abandon the title (which he hates), but it has been permanently brought into popularity by Batman.

   After the destruction of the previous primary reality of Earth-One had been removed due to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the new Penguin who emerged native to New Earth had far less girth in his belly and far more mental prowess and focus than any of his previous incarnations. Much of the New Earth Penguin's adventures shows Oswald far more concentrated on developing and refining his mental skills to overwhelm all of his many foes, not merely Batman and far, far less attention in his personal indulgences and consumption. In that focus, Penguin began exploring the potential of going straight as a successful means to his own long-term ambition of personal power and accomplishment.

Thus, Cobblepot selectively returned to criminal activities but he would continually be found out and imprisoned by both non-powered and superpowered law supporters, Deciding to take advantage of his limitations and contacts during his time in the

   While attaining social appreciation as a businessman and celebrity host of a successful restaurant and nightclub, Cobblepot also continued to gain success as a criminal mastermind manipulating the massive criminal underground members to largely work for him in his role as a clearing house for their illegal activities. While Cobblepot does still very occasionally participate himself in active criminal activities himself, it is in his role as an indirect and inactive criminal manipulator and social gadfly in the ownership of the Iceberg Lounge, a nightclub that Cobblepot has finally begun to attain the power over the three main groups he wanted: acceptance by the social elite he longed to be included in and who now recognize his legitimate businesses as some of the most successful society people willing frequently join; power over the criminal underground, whose many superpowered members including

   Penguin continues to operate in this successful mode as the ever entrepreneurial Penguin is often fencing stolen property or arranging early furloughs for incarcerated former criminal associates - for a hefty fee, of course - on the side. During the period when Gotham City was leveled by an earthquake (the "No Man's Land" storyline), he was one of the major players in the mostly-abandoned and lawless city, using his connections (one was eventually discovered to be tied to Lex Luthor and his company) to sell necessities at outrageous prices.

   The Penguin first appeared in Detective Comics #58, where he rigged a jewel heist and attempted to steal an emerald penguin. Penguin escaped the Dynamic Duo, but re-appeared countless times over and over. He had teamed himself up with the Joker on more than one occasion and was more umbrella and money obsessed than bird obsessed. He appeared in a purple hat and tails with pin-striped pants. His gloves changed color many times from purple, to orange, then to white. Penguin also wore gangster spats.

After the show's cancelation Penguin stories stopped being published as frequently (only two were made during a ten year period).

Medics treat a cut on him but the Penguin thinks they are police officers arresting him saying defiantly "You can't arrest me I haven't done anything wrong." A medic replies by saying "You're free to go now Mr. Cobblepot."

   . The thug approached the villain Dollmaker, who had captured Batman, with several thousands of dollars in gold, offering to trade the gold for Batman. Batman subsequently escapes as he is being tied up and knocks out all of Penguin's men. A hit man in a Joker mask is featured in the next issue and is in possession of a poker chip from the Iceberg Lounge (which appears to be a replica of the Sydney Opera House with a roof coated in ice). Though the assassin escapes, Penguin appears briefly at the end of the issue, watching reporter
   Charlotte Rivers
   disguise herself as one of the Lounge's waitresses from a security booth and tells several female bodyguards led by

   , he was often depicted as undeformed and, in some cases, attractive. However, elements of bird-appearance could be seen in several Golden Age appearances and continued into later reditions. Since the film however, Penguin has been depicted with as a grotesque psychopath, often a cross between an actual penguin and a man. Elements of this have often been used in designs for the character up until the modern day.

   Unlike most Batman villains, the Penguin is often depicted as sane and doesn't theme his crimes around a psychotic obsession. He does, however, posess a kean intelect and often puts on an aristocratic personality, starkly contrasting against more demented enemies like

   . As a result, his relationship with Batman is often somewhat less tense than it is with other villains. The Penguin recently became a mobster and nightclub owner who engages in more quiet criminal activity whom Batman tolerates as a source of criminal underworld information. Whenever he is apprehended for a crime, he is sent to an ordinary prison instead of Arkham Asylum, although some versions of the character (particularly the less sane interpretations) are sent to Arkham.

   The Penguin does, however, possess a few eccentricities. He is known for his love of birds and his high-tech umbrellas that serve some specialized function, such as hang-gliding and weaponry. He also keeps beautiful women around him, perhaps to remind others of his monetary power or to compensate for his own grotesqueness.
