   , who coaxed Harold into building deadly machines, which the Penguin used to conduct a massive crime wave through Gotham City. Penguin had the machines moved to Arctic Enterprises, a company secretly owned by Penguin in order to auction it off to terrorists from all over the world, telling Harold he should be prouder than a peacock, assuring him the two would split the money from the auction. However, Penguin secretly planned to get rid of Harold as soon as the auction and demonstration was over, which he revealed to his henchlady
   Lark
   . When the auction began however, the Penguin could not find Harold anywhere, as a betrayed and heartbroken Harold had overheard Penguin and Lark's conversation. Penguin attempted to begin the bidding with the terrorists, but Lark still could not locate Harold, forcing the Penguin to operate the machinery to the best of his knowledge. But Batman crashed the auction in the Bat-Copter, Harold turned against his feared master,and saved Batman from a flock of the Penguin's birds. As he rushed at Penguin,the villain demanded bitterly,

   Penguin knocked Harold down with his umbrella, and demanded if he was surrounded by traitors. Batman arrived and captured the Penguin, while Harold ran away and hid in the Penguin's chalet to be alone. Later, while Batman was fighting off Penguin's goons one night, he found and saved Harold.
