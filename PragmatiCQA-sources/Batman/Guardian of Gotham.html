   victims into his cell and gives them a taser. Though he puts up a fight, Bruce is subdued and beaten by the men, only to be saved by
   another inmate
   . As
   Dr. Leland

   As they are taken to through the Asylum, Bruce sees how derelict the conditions are due to his father's use of the asylum. As they arrived at the Recreation Room, Leland leaves them to attend to another matter. As John leaves to get the remote, he gives Bruce a key. He can explore the room and interact with the other patients, including
   Victor Zsasz
   and
   Arnold Wesker

   With the report revealing that

   was the one who sent him to the asylum, Bruce realizes that was sent there because of his perceived affair with Selina and his increasing mental instability. When a report reveals that
   Vicki Vale
   has gone missing, Doe reveals his knowledge that she is Lady Arkham. Believing Bruce to be on a collision course with her, he reveals that she is actually the daughter of the Arkhams, the family that ran the Asylum, having been adopted by the Vales. John also reveals that Vicki seeks retribution for her parents' deaths, having been murdered on Thomas Wayne's orders to prevent them from blowing the whistle on his activities.

   Offering to help Bruce escape from the asylum, John asks for a favor, but will go through with the plans regardless of whether he accepts or not. To achieve this, he starts a riot by cutting Zsasz cheek and causing the killer to have a psychotic breakdown. Lashing out, Zsasz is able to attack the attention of the orderlies and gives Bruce the opportunity to use the phone. However, he also has the option of trying to stop Zsasz and prevent more fighting.

     Batman decides to stop Penguin and the Children of Arkham from hacking his network, telling Alfred to barricade himself into the Batcave. Arriving at Wayne Enterprises, Batman will either have to negotiate the building himself or with assistance from Lucius, depending on whether he was asked to stay at Wayne Enterprises or work for Bruce Wayne. Despite being discovered, he is able to subdue both Children of Arkham members and Penguin's drones, eventually finding the criminal in the CEO's office.

     Confronting Penguin in his office, Batman listens as the criminal mocks him and monologues on their plans for the city, though can use this as a distraction to figure out how to defeat Penguin and his men.

      If this option is chosen, this is unsuccessful, due to the hack. When Penguin realizes what is going on, he nullifies the simulations.

     Deciding to attack, Batman takes out Penguin's men, but is thrown into the Elevator to R&amp;D by one of the drones and held there by Penguin as they drop to the department.

     Arriving, Penguin reveals the black box and places on a pair of experimental gloves, hoping that they will give him the edge in the fight. Despite his knowledge of combat techniques, Batman is also placed at a disadvantage with his tech unable to work. Despite Penguin's upper hand, Batman is able to remove and disable the gloves, using tools within the department, and break his leg, defeating him. With Penguin refusing to talk, Batman either restrains or knocks him unconscious. He then destroys the Black Box with a hammer, stopping the hack and saving his tech. He then alerts the GCPD, leaving Penguin strung up in a stairwell.
    </p>
    The episode ends with Harvey standing outside of a burning Wayne Manor, watching with his men as it falls apart. When one of his men asks him what to tell the public, he says to say that "Wayne put up a fight".

     Batman decides to stop Harvey and his men from taking over Wayne Manor, telling Alfred he will be there shortly. Though he tries to use his drones to monitor and plan out his attack from a distance, the hack causes it to crash. Deciding to confront Dent the "old fashioned way", he subdues one of the Mayor's enforcers and confronts him.
     <i key="0f0973d9-00c4-4219-b5ab-ecb67ffd8fd1">
      If Batman saved Dent, he will try to rationalize his actions and ask Batman to help take down Bruce Wayne. However, if Dent was disfigured, he will scold the vigilante for protecting Bruce and for not saving him from the Penguin.

     Despite his objections, Dent orders his men to fight the vigilante. Though Batman is able to take down most of the enforcers, he is forced to hide when Dent begins shooting at him with a machine gun, filled with Explosive Slugs. Forced to ascend to the second floor, Batman tries to use height as an advantage by gliding over the Mayor, only for the latter to get a shot in.
    </p>
    <p key="163c856e-8fb6-44db-a9fb-617f971be922">
     With his men holding Batman down, Dent prepares to execute Batman, only for Alfred to shoot him with a rifle. With Dent distracted, Batman is able to summon a cloud of bats, causing Dent's men to let him go. Throwing a Batarang into Dent's rifle chamber, Batman causes the gun to explode and burns the mayor's left arm. He then defeats Dent by tackling him to the floor, with help from his grappling gun. With Dent and his enforcers defeated, Batman hands them over to Gordon. Though the Lieutenant is happy that the mayor has been removed from power, he is unsure whether to send him either to Blackgate or Arkham Asylum. Whichever Batman suggests, Gordon will leave to do so whilst Batman returns to the Batcave.
    </p>
    Upon arriving, Bruce learns that Penguin's hack is almost complete and that the Children of Arkham have access to the Batcomputer. With no other option, he decides to cut off the Batcomputer completely, deactivating most of his tech and crippling his operations as Batman.
