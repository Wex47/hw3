However, he then realizes the man in the cell is not actually the Joker due to his chalk skin smearing off when he tried to grab him, and demands to know where he is. The Joker intends to drive

   The man who will become the Joker is an unnamed engineer who quit his job at a chemical company to become a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife,
   Jeannie
   , he agrees to guide two criminals into the plant for a robbery. During the planning, the police inform him that his wife has died in a household accident involving an electric baby bottle heater. Grief-stricken, the engineer tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them.

  <p key="9b6ad773-5366-4c21-96ef-8a2a23549ed6">
   At the plant, the criminals make him don a special mask to become the infamous
   Red Hood
   . Unknown to the engineer, this disguise is simply the criminals' scheme to implicate any accomplice as the mastermind to divert attention from themselves. Once inside, they almost immediately blunder into security personnel, and a violent shootout and a chase ensues. The criminals are gunned down and the engineer finds himself confronted by Batman, who is investigating the disturbance.
  </p>
  <p key="568415a6-7b81-4bbc-bc7d-9285139e3ec2">
   Panicked, the engineer deliberately jumps into the chemical plant's chemical waste catch-basin vat to escape Batman and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. Once outside, he discovers, to his horror, that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk white, stained his lips ruby red and dyed his hair bright green. This turn of events, compounding the man's misfortunes of that one day, drives him completely insane, causing him to break out into hysterical laughter, and results in the birth of the Joker.

   , and imprisons him in a run-down amusement park. His henchmen then strip Gordon naked and cage him in the park's freak show. He chains Gordon to one of the park's rides and cruelly forces him to view giant pictures of his wounded daughter in various states of undress. Once Gordon completes the maddening gauntlet, the Joker ridicules him as an example of "the average man", a naïve weakling doomed to insanity.

   Batman arrives to save Gordon, and the Joker retreats into the funhouse. Gordon's sanity is intact despite the ordeal and he insists that Batman capture the Joker "by the book" in order to "show him that our way works." Batman enters the funhouse and faces the Joker's traps while the Joker tries to persuade his old foe that the world is inherently insane and thus not worth fighting for, also claiming that Batman must have suffered from a bad day himself and gone insane as well, mostly because of his attire (with Joker being

   he realized
   ). He then commented that, while he doesn't remember exactly how his bad day went due to his memories changing every time, he knows he went crazy as a result, especially after knowing how the world was a black awful joke. He then ranted as to why Batman won't acknowledge he's gone crazy, especially when he's pretty sure the Caped Crusader was smart enough to see things from his eyes, pointing out how the Cold War frequently came close to escalating to World War III due to a flock of geese appearing on a computer screen, or how the second World War was allegedly caused by Germany entering an argument over the amount of telegraph poles they owed the Allies when undergoing reparations shortly after the first World War, and then denouncing everything everyone has strived to fight for as being a "monstrous, demented gag" before demanding to know why Batman not only doesn't see the funny side, but why he isn't even laughing at all. Eventually, Batman tracks down the Joker and, after explaining that the reason he isn't laughing at all, nor seeing it as a funny side is because he's heard the joke before, and it wasn't funny the first time around, subdues him. Batman then attempts to reach out to him to give up crime and put a stop to their years-long war; otherwise, the two will be eternally locked on a course that will one day result in a fight to the death between them. The Joker declines, however, ruefully saying "It's too late for that...far too late." He then tells Batman a joke that was started earlier in the comic:

  <p key="3a82d197-cfa8-4b8d-b9ba-fb29b1fa71fd">
   The joke is funny enough to make the normally stone-faced Batman laugh. They continue to laugh as the police approach. Batman then grabs the Joker and the story ends, leaving it up to the reader to determine the Joker's fate.

In addition, the episode Harley's Holiday had some thematic similarities to

   as reference for the role. The most apparent influence of the graphic novel on the narrative itself would be the Joker's concept of his past as being "multiple choice" – in the film, he describes two conflicting scenarios to explain the origins of his scars to two different people - as well as his claim that a bad day could drive anyone mad, which he tries to prove through tormenting Gordon in the comic book, and Harvey Dent in the film. Both Jokers also explain their behavior and attitude as seeing what a twisted joke the world is, with the film stating in society "their morals, their code: it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be." In addition, the Joker, when relaying the second of his infamous scar stories to Rachel Dawes, says to her "Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling!", which was similar to the line "So why can't you see the funny side? Why aren't you laughing?", also uttered by the Joker, in the aforementioned graphic novel. When revealing that he drove Harvey Dent insane as his "ace in the hole" for "the battle for Gotham's soul", Joker when explaining how it wasn't hard for him to accomplish says that madness was similar to gravity in that "all it takes is a little push", which was similar to Joker's line in the graphic novel of "all it takes is one bad day for the sanest man alive to be reduced to lunacy."

   Elements of Joker's character (specifically, his facial expression when asking why Batman not only doesn't see the funny side of everything being a joke, but why he's not laughing at all) have been reused in various other comic stories featuring him. In particular, in

   , the Joker has a similar depressed look when admitting that it wasn't funny even when it should have been when recounting how he killed Batman with enough Joker toxin to have even a regiment of elephants succumb to the effects and Batman still neither laughed nor even smiled upon expiring.

   , owing to Jerome Valeska's characterization being largely based on the Joker (and to a lesser extent, Jeremiah Valeska, his twin brother, actually becoming the Joker in that series), elements of
   <i key="ab723506-5f7b-4c25-852b-5eb4fc1678ca">

   were used in some of his appearances. In particular, in the episode "Knock, Knock", Jerome's speech about how the people are "prisoners" to their sanity, and comparing it to a prison in their minds that obscures their being "tiny little cogs in a giant absurd machine" before telling them to be free like the Maniax, was similar to Joker's memories monologue in

   . In addition, his character arc in Season 3, where he upon his revival abducted Bruce Wayne and tried to force him to go mad at the horrific carnival upon causing a blackout, was similar to how Joker tried to force Commissioner Gordon to go insane to prove that it only took one bad day to drive anyone insane. Lastly, after Jeremiah Valeska, Jerome's estranged twin brother, opened a gift that had been sent by Jerome post-humously and driven mad via the laughing gas, proceeded to make a similar pose to when Joker was driven insane in the graphic novel while giggling insanely. Likewise, Jeremiah Valeska's character arc was similar to what Joker described of how a bad day would drive the sanest man to lunacy in the graphic novel. Later after Jermiah kidnaps  Bruce Wayne  in a similar manner only difference is  he isn't stripped naked.

   that it merely took one bad day to drive someone insane. The second is shortly after this as Red Hood manages to kill Joker by shooting him in the head, where it shows Commissioner Gordon and Barbara hugging each other in silent relief over Joker's death, with the latter being in a wheelchair, referencing Joker's crippling of her. The third instance has the Joker, who was implied to have attempted to become sane out of guilt over Batman's death and using makeup to make himself appear more normal, relaying the same joke that he told Batman in the ending of that comic, causing Jason to recognize him immediately due to reading the files of Joker's crippling of Barbara, including transcripts of the joke, back when he was Robin and then promptly kill him by stabbing him in the eye after repeating what Joker said to him before leaving him to die to a bomb. On a similar note, the flashbacks to Red Hood's unconscious murders of various crooks were depicted in black and white with some red utilized throughout, which was similar to the art style of the Deluxe version of

    , the ending was ambiguous, leaving the fates of Batman and Joker to the reader. However, on August 2013, comic book writer
    Grant Morrison
    was a guest on Kevin Smith's podcast Fat Man on Batman this week, where he explained how he interpreted the book's ending:
    <i key="48e47c90-0a51-4c23-bce0-73f14be09e40">
     "No one gets the end, because Batman kills The Joker. That’s why it’s called The Killing Joke. The Joker tells the ‘Killing Joke’ at the end, Batman reaches out and breaks his neck, and that’s why the laughter stops and the light goes out, ’cause that was the last chance at crossing that bridge. And Alan Moore wrote the ultimate Batman/Joker story… he finished it."
    </i>
    However, there are contradictions to Morrison's idea, some of which coming from the script.
   </li>
   <li key="4c11bb9a-7862-4ad2-bcb2-7699de77589e">
    Neither Batman nor Joker are ever referred to by name in the comic (aside from a brief viewing of the wanted poster bearing Joker's visage). The initial French release, however, does have Joker being referred to by name once: When Batman discovers the impostor in Arkham Asylum, Batman shouts "Vous n'êtes pas le Joker!", which literally translates to "You're not the Joker!"

    Originally, it was intended that, in addition to Joker shooting Barbara Gordon through the spine and taking nude photos of her to drive her father insane, that Joker was to be explicitly depicted as raping Barbara Gordon. Artwork for the scene was even created, and the scene ended up cut, although rape was still implied in the final version. Gosh! Comics' Billy Hynes eventually tweeted the original page on December 1, 2013.

    A film adaptation of the Killing Joke was announced on July 21st 2015, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill returning to voice Batman and the Joker, respectively.
    In addition, the film was confirmed to premiere at San Diego Comic Con on July 21-24, 2016. Bruce Timm also mentioned the film will have a 15-minute prologue section original to it, explaining that there wasn't enough in the source material itself to make a full-fledged movie.
    It also received an R rating, the first DC Universe Animated Original Movie to have done so.
    The film received mixed reviews, with praise for Hamill and Conroy's performances and faithfulness to the story, but criticism primarily given towards the prologue and portrayal of Barbara Gordon.
