   Batman's reappearance in Gotham was one of high controversy and media coverage. When a debate of whether or not Batman was good for Gotham got aired in a reformed Arkham Asylum, it was overheard by the Joker. Ever since Batman's retirement, Joker's life lost its meaning and he went effectively comatose for a decade. Upon hearing Batman's name on the TV, Joker spoke for the first time in years with a large smile saying, "

   To escape from Arkham, Joker began manipulating his anti-Batman psychiatrist Bartholomew Wolper into getting him onto a late-night show to claim he was a victim of Batman rather than being a villain himself. Little to Wolper's knowledge, Joker came to reconnect with his old henchman

   On the late show, Joker used these weapons to murder the entire audience with deadly gas before going on a rampage. Teaming up with Abner, Joker travelled to an amusement-park to start selling poisoned cotton-candy to children.

   through the eyeball. The fighting between the two lead them to the Tunnel of Love with Joker giddily reflecting on how this will likely be the time that Batman finally kills him. It is also expressed Batman feels responsible for everyone Joker murders, that Joker never kept count of his victims, that Batman did do-so, and that Joker knew and loved Batman for it. Joker began stabbing Batman with a knife to abdominal area countless times once close. Overwhelmed, Batman ened the frenzy by snapping the Joker's neck to a certain degree, partially paralyzing him. Joker mocked Batman as a coward for not having the strength to finish the job. Taunting on how the new Gotham government will likely have Batman killed for the "murder" of the Joker, he managed to twist his own neck completely while laughing wildly.

  <p key="2b75afcd-c6da-4fc2-bb23-ae5bcaebc98a">
   Batman riggs Joker's body to explode before the police arrive. While waiting, Batman looked down at Joker's frozen death grin and couldn't shake the sound of his laughter from mind, spitting on his face as a final "goodbye." The police discover Joker's corpse at the end of the tunnel and indeed assume it's Batman's doing. Against Yindell's warning, an armored SWAT officer touches the body and it ignites him in flames. Amidst the confusion, Batman hurls three small explosives from his belt to further disorient the police, knocking them out of their boats. Yindell attempts to arrest Batman at gunpoint but he simply punches her in the face ands procures her pistol. Batman took pills from his belt to keep himself from passing out as he continued to elude the SWAT team. Batman glanced at Joker's face (now a blackened husk) one last time, still unable to shake the sound of his laughter in his mind. Batman struggled to aim the pistol, but managed to hit the plastique explosive he set up to ignite the entire the tunnel in flames. Robin arrived with the stealth helicopter soon after, pulling him out of the area with a line.
