The initial roster for this team consisted of three veteran Titans: Changeling (now calling himself Beast Boy once again), Cyborg and Starfire.

Cyborg was tasked with training the younger heroes in the tradition of the Titans. To this end, he designed and built a new

   Their next trial brought them against another former adversary of the New Teen Titans – the Church of Blood. The High Priest of the Church of Blood was a sixteen-year-old boy named Sebastian who ascended to the post (as per the tradition of the cult) through patricide. As the new Brother Blood, Sebastian captured former Titans member Raven. It was at this time that the cult was revealed to be worshipers of Raven's demonic father Trigon. In an occult ritual, Brother Blood wed Raven and sought to claim her power as his own. The Teen Titans fought against the Church of Blood and Raven was freed. Reborn into a younger human body, Raven rejoined the Teen Titans. Shortly after this adventure, Starfire left the group to join the Outsiders, but still teamed up with the Teen Titans on a regular basis.

   Robin was not the only one adversely affected by his experiences in the future. Superboy, who had for some time been wrestling with the truth that he was a partial clone of Lex Luthor, was greatly bothered to see his future self engage in acts of such wanton violence. Superboy’s apprehension proved justified when his teammates discovered that Lex Luthor had programmed a psychic trigger into his genetic make-up that caused him to turn into a violent, robotic drone. Under Luthor’s control, Superboy attacked his teammates, greatly injuring his girlfriend Wonder Girl in the process. It took the full might of both the Teen Titans and the Outsiders to halt Superboy’s rampage. Ultimately, Superboy returned to normal, but the damage to his psyche was grave.

   Blüdhaven
   , Superman hand-picked Robin to coordinate rescue efforts in the beleaguered city after it had been attacked by Chemo. Several times during this crisis, the Titans found themselves in pitched battle against the insane Superboy of Earth-Prime. Their fight against Superboy-Prime came at great cost, when the bloodthirsty Kryptonian brutally slaughtered several former Titans including Baby Wildebeest, Bushido and Pantha. Risk was also seriously maimed when Prime tore his arm off and would have died from substantial blood loss if not for the efforts of Raven. The Titans' greatest loss however was when one of their own, Superboy, sacrificed his own life to stop the machinations of Superboy-Prime's puppet master, Alexander Luthor. A special memorial to Superboy was erected in Centennial Park in Metropolis next to the one honoring Superman.

   The death of Superboy caused a dramatic shake-up in the team roster. Cyborg had been injured during the Crisis, Starfire was missing in action and Raven had departed from the team for a special mission. Beast Boy left the group to rejoin his original outfit the Doom Patrol. Kid Flash disappeared into the Speed Field during the Crisis and had yet to return. Hawk and Dove had quit and Speedy left the team for a six-month training session on the Marshall Islands with her mentor Green Arrow. Robin, still reeling from the aftershocks of Superboy's death, tried in vain to re-clone him from skin samples he had obtained. Each effort however, met with failure. To fill the vacuum left behind by the absent Titans, Robin and Wonder Girl began auditioning new members. Several neophyte heroes tried out for the roster including Molecule, Little Barda, Miss Martian and Zachary Zatara. At this time, Deathstroke's daughter Rose Wilson, having abandoned her chosen career as a criminal, was accepted into the ranks of the Teen Titans as well. Wonder Girl however, did not support Rose's inclusion on the team, and the two continue to despise one another to this day. Of those that tried out, the only other member who remained with the team was the young alien Miss Martian.

In order to facilitate a suitable family environment for his offspring, Deathstroke engaged in an elaborate scheme to force the Titans to accept Rose and Joey into their ranks. To this end, he recruited several super-powered individuals into a new Titans East. Titans East and the Teen Titans battled one another in a fight that brought them all the way back to New York and the original Titans Island. In the end, the Titans proved victorious, but Deathstroke managed to elude capture. Neither Rose nor Jericho learned of the true motivations behind their father's actions.

   A second team consisting of the older Titans formed shortly after the Teen Titans' battle against Starro and the Titans Tomorrow. Having distanced himself from the San Francisco team, Cyborg began recruiting young heroes into a new iteration of Titans East. Some members such as Anima had served with the roster in previous incarnations. Others, were amateur heroes like Power Boy and Little Barda who had little experience working with a team dynamic. Cyborg suspected that Power Boy was dangerous and primarily invited him to the group so he could keep an eye on him. During a training exercise on Titans Island, a mysterious assailant attacked the neophyte heroes and Power Boy was killed in the onslaught. Other recruits such as Hawk and Dove and Lagoon Boy were also greatly injured. News of this incident reached the former members of the New Teen Titans and the heroes reformed the Titans to investigate the matter. They soon discovered that the threat originated with the spawn of one of their most dangerous foes ever Trigon.
