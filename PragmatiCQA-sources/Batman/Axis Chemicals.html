   The plant was one of several organizations alleged to have ties to Gotham mob boss
   Carl Grissom
   , and was a frequent target of investigations by the
   GCPD
   . Grissom, worried about the continued police presence exposing his empire, sent his hitman Jack Napier to destroy any evidence of Axis Chemicals' ties to Grissom. The operation was actually part of a scheme by Grissom to have Jack and his men killed in revenge for Jack having an affair with his mistress,
   Alicia Hunt
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b561e441-55c1-467f-a160-aa83afe096fc">
   When Jack and his men arrived at the plant, the group went into the main office and broke open a vault that contained the incriminating documents. After his men removed the locks that secured the vault, Jack glanced at what appeared to be a smoke-like gas coming out of the files, indicating that they were already destroyed much earlier. Realizing that his operation was a set up, Jack warned his men to keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
  </p>
  <p key="c59b7213-63fb-4064-8224-bf6541107349">
   At that point, the GCPD, led by
   Lieutenant Eckhardt
   and
   Commissioner Gordon
   arrived, who was tipped off by Grissom after sending Jack and his men to Axis. The gang opened fire on the police, and Napier made a hasty escape.
   Batman
   soon arrived and assisted the police by stealthily taking down several of Napier's men.
  </p>
  <p key="36200834-612b-4a39-84a1-1bbf3cd32409">
   Napier turned up several of the plant's machines to dangerous levels to try and create enough chaos to escape, and inadvertently caused several of the vats to fill up with an uncontrolled mixture of hazardous chemicals. Napier made it up to the final gantry, just beyond which was the exit door. Free to escape, Napier prepared to kill Commissioner Gordon. Batman soon stopped him, but
   Bob
   put Gordon at gunpoint - which forced Batman to let Napier go. Napier did not leave, but first shot Eckhart in revenge, which killed him, then he attempted to shoot Batman. Batman deflects the bullet into Napier's face, and caused him to tumble over the side. But rather than fall, Napier grabbed the gantry. Batman tried to pull him up, but couldn't, and Napier plummeted into the vat of chemicals below. He sank into the green slime, quickly disappeared, and was presumed dead by onlookers.
  </p>
  <p key="daebbc29-3493-41b7-b667-ce14070bccaf">
   Commissioner Gordon ordered his men to get Batman. However, Batman threw a
   smoke bomb
   and disappeared into the pipe works. Batman watched over Axis, and was lit from behind with the luminous Axis sign. After Batman left, a deathly white hand rose from the murky wastewater underneath the plant's drainage pipes, and several
   playing cards
   floated to the surface. The chemical submersion had changed Napier's appearance with emerald green hair, chalk white skin and red lips and thus began the origin of one of the most dangerous criminals Gotham would ever know.

   Batman realized that the only way to stop the Joker's master plan was to destroy the nexus of the poisonous products - Axis Chemicals. Batman controlled the
   Batmobile
   via the communicator to drop an explosive device at a certain point in the facility, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed the most of the structure. The explosion took with it the tainted products and a few members of
   Joker's gang
   that had stayed behind to repeatedly fire at the armored vehicle with handguns. Joker fled in a
   helicopter
