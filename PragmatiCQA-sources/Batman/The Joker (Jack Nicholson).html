   Born in Brooklyn, Jack Napier came to live in
   Gotham City
   . In his school years, Jack proved himself to be emotionally unstable, but was highly intelligent, and showed aptitude in art, science and chemistry. He also turned to a life of violent crime. When he was fifteen, Jack was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. He also implied that he may have also murdered people, including his own parents, since he was a kid. Napier also got into a sadistic habit of asking his victims whether they "

   As a young man, Jack and his associate
   Joe Chill
   ambushed the Wayne family whilst they returned home from the
   Monarch Theatre

   Bruce
   , Jack stepped out of the shadows and aimed his gun, asking his signature question. Before he could shoot him, a horrified Chill convinced him to flee the scene before police arrived. Deciding to spare the boy, Napier told Bruce he'd "

   As Jack aged, he worked his way up in the Mafia ranks and eventually became the right-hand man of Mob Boss,
   Carl Grissom
   . Jack often toyed with a
   lucky deck of playing cards
   , which saved his life on one occasion by taking an otherwise fatal gunshot for him. In stark contrast to his later hilarious attitude, Jack's persona was rather sarcastic and grumpy, and he prided himself on a dignified and handsome appearance. At some point, Jack entered into an affair with Grissom's mistress,
   Alicia Hunt
   .
  </p>
  <p key="5d7a7265-3818-4ffd-8ad8-5137536c1f07">
   Jack doubted the competence of Grissom's leadership of the crime family and also snidely retorted to a news broadcast of

   ", as well as heavily implied that he'd kill Dent brutally if the latter even attempted to move in on Grissom. Napier later met with
   Lt. Eckhardt
   to learn what Dent and
   the GCPD
   had been investigating. During the fight, Jack attacked the officer when he insulted him, the officer not retaliating due to his friend and associate
   Bob
   threating him.

  <p key="0bf39ebc-acbb-40a9-9c6d-222c9e175d4d">
   Eventually, Grissom discovered Napier's affair with Alicia and decided to set him up to be killed by Eckhardt at

   . When Grissom informed Jack of his entrusted task with stealing incriminating documents from the plant, he consulted his lucky deck to pull a random card's face towards him. The card happened to be a Joker (which, coincidentally, was the very thing that he later became). Napier reluctantly agreed to help Grissom, despite the card's advice.
  </p>
  <p key="e1c1f498-d9d4-42f8-9de2-d1ed112e5d5f">
   Breaking into the chemical plant with
   his men
   , Napier discovered the ruse after they broke into the main office vault to discover it was empty. Whilst his men kept the GCPD busy, Jack activated machinery around the plant to make detection more difficult and cover his escape. Grissom's plan went awry thanks to intervention by
   Commissioner Gordon
   , who took charge of the officers and demanded they spare Napier, and Batman, who subdued several of the Hoods and tracked Napier as he fled.
  </p>
  <p key="b5cf596f-90af-4cb3-8996-8b12447fb618">
   Making his way to the mixing chamber, Napier was confronted by Batman. However, the vigilante was forced to stand down when Bob arrived and held Gordon at gunpoint. Before he fled, Napier gunned down Eckhardt for his betrayal and attempted to do the same to Batman. However, the Dark Knight deflected his attack and the bullet ricocheted through both of his cheeks. In pain and in a panic, Jack lost his balance and fell off the catwalk. Though Batman caught his arm and attempted to pull him back up to safety, Napier's glove eventually slipped through the vigilante's and he plummeted into the chemical vat below.
  </p>
  <p key="c2ffba34-cab9-4f75-a3b9-c87c3ebfcd58">
   Jack survived, and was washed into
   Gotham Harbor
   by a drainage pipe. Still submerged, Jack stretched an arm upward through the water's surface, where his lucky deck floated, and managed to climb out. However Jack's long chemical submersion had permanently wreaked a horrible toll: his hair follicles and nails were turned emerald green, his skin pigmentation was bleached chalk-white and his lips were flushed ruby-red.

  <p key="2a254efd-4730-49be-aec4-cd6f582b87a5">
   After he saw the horrible result of his chemical encounter, Jack turned to a backstreet plastic surgeon named
   Dr. Davis
   and was particularly desperate to have his facial wounds healed to preserve his prized appearance. Despite an extensive procedure, Davis informed Jack that not only was he unable to reverse the chemical damage to his skin and hair, but due to the extent of the trauma - specifically completely severed nerves - and a lack of effective tools, Davis was forced to resort to a procedure similar to a face lift; stretching the skin of Jack's cheeks over the gashes to hide them, resulting in a permanent rictus grin. At Jack's demand, Davis presented Jack with a mirror to reveal that his carefully maintained appearance had been transformed to that of a clown.
  </p>
  <p key="1a8a7c35-2649-4a46-9d7d-2fb69e868889">
   This was too much for the vain mobster, and after moments of reflecting on all that had transpired, Jack lost touch with what little sanity that he had. He began to laugh maniacally and convulsively, then smashed the mirror that he held on the table that held Davis' tools, stumbled out of the room, and laughed into the night. With Jack's mind completely snapped after he saw his bizarre new appearance, Jack then assumed the new identity of "The Joker".
  </p>
  <p key="0cf2be5b-de3b-4fb6-92b4-01b32f9f2d2f">
   Joker went directly to Grissom's apartment, revealed his survival, and made clear that he knew that it was Grissom who set him up to die in the first place, especially regarding Alicia as his motive, and also held Grissom up in order to prevent him from reaching for a stowed away gun. Grissom tried to cut a deal with Joker but the crazed mobster killed him as revenge for setting him up and took over his empire. When sitting at his now deceased boss' desk, he picked up a newspaper which read "Winged Freak Terrorizes Gotham's Gangland" and scowled, deciding to get revenge and "outdo" Batman, whom he felt was getting too much press. He said with a smile "Wait'll they get a load of me", and laughed heartily.

  <p key="d1921f2b-45ff-483a-a313-85bd7386dbe1">
   The Clown Prince of Crime then engaged in a violent and chaotic crime spree. When Joker tried to present himself in a more "normal" light, he applied various cosmetic products to give himself a more normal-looking skin tone and hair color that resembled his original appearance.

   During a mob summit with the rest of the

   ". However, most of the mob bosses, including
   Antoine Rotelli
   and
   Vinnie Ricorso
   , were suspicious of Jack's apparent orders from Grissom and his constant devilish grin. Rotelli then wondered what would happen if he said "no". Jack then responded with a handshake and that would be it. Unfortunately for Rotelli, Jack meant by that statement that it would be it for Rotelli, as he fried and electrocuted Rotelli with a
   Joy Buzzer
   , which horrified the rest of the Mob bosses and with Jack joking about his demise and then laughing at it. Jack then dismissed the mob as his
   Goons
   then rushed in and held them at gunpoint. Joker then ordered
   Bob
   to tail
   Alexander Knox
   to find out more information on Batman, and then decided (by talking to Rotelli's charred corpse as if he were still alive) to "grease" all of the mob bosses at the summit.

   Joker then arrived at City Hall and, after he claimed that the check was written with a dead hand, murdered Ricorso (who claimed that Grissom had landed him with the check with his signature) with his quill pen after he claimed that he was his "Uncle Bingo" and then had his mime faction of his gang open fire. As Napier made his way down the stairs he noticed that Bruce Wayne was the only member of the crowd who not taken cover, unafraid. Joker got in his black sedan getaway car and waved at Bruce as he stared into window.

A large studio room had hundreds of photos taken of dead soldiers stolen from a CIA file where spread across the floor. An elderly

After sitting at her table he told her she could take off her gas mask; when she did, he said she was "beautiful... in an old-fashioned kind of way". Lighting up a candelabra, he took notice of her portfolio, and Vicki replied she was meeting with someone who wants to see her work. Joker opened the portfolio and mocked the fashion photos, but praised a photo of a dead civilian from the

He offered her the job of photographing his homicidal performance art but she didn't seem very enthusiastic. During this, Bob walked Alicia (who was now unable to stand by herself) over to the table. Vicki asked about her mask, and Napier asked her to show her scarred visage; it startled Vicki so much she immediately rose from her seat, realizing the full extent of Napier's intentions. Joker initially admitted he was no Picasso before asking if Vicki liked it; she said it was great, before asking what she could do for him, to which he replied, "Oh, a little song, a little dance, Batman's head on a lance". When she admitted she didn't know anything about Batman, Joker replied, "Really? Well, how about a little you and me?"

As Vale attempted to comfort him he looked up to startle her and cackled in her face. Suddenly Batman crashed through the skylight and grabbed Vale away from him. As Joker stepped forward, the Dark Knight held up a

It had been discovered that Joker had cleverly tainted the chemicals of the products from a mixture of components that would only be poisonous if the products were combined, such as hairspray being combined with lipstick and eyeshadow. Now that Gotham City knew, they were avoiding using the products altogether until safe products would be shipped in. This as well as Batman taking Vicki away from him, made the Joker furious and he vowed to kill the Dark Knight for interfering in his plans.

As he approached Joker, Bob pointed his pistol at him on the quickest draw of his life, ready to protect Jack. Joker motioned to Bob and Lawrence to stand down and let Wayne speak. Bruce leaned in and whispered that he know Napier's true identity, he then proceeded to tell a story about a "bad seed" that met an unfortunate end.

   Joker then took Vicki hostage and led her at gunpoint into the
   Old Gotham Cathedral
   . Realizing that an injured Batman was pursing them up the immense staircase, he made Vicki leave behind her high heels and trench-coat possibly to lure him. When Joker reached the bell tower, he used his

   to disconnect one of the massive bells which fell to the ground and blocked the only entrance to the stairs so they wouldn't be followed by the police. The falling bell narrowly missed the Dark Knight and he continued the pursuit. Joker then ordered three of his goons to attack the Batman on sight while he forced Vicki to waltz.

  <p key="d0bd40c7-cad9-4708-aafe-d6cdfb415d3b">
   Batman eventually reached the belfry and after he defeated Joker's henchmen, confronted Joker, and vowed to kill him for murdering his parents years ago, although Joker, who had apparently murdered several parents since he himself was a kid, did not know what Batman was talking about and eventually mocked him for how he made the revelation of Joker making Batman first.
  </p>
  <p key="6ad4d3ce-5f56-4601-b6cd-78f50d2f4187">
   During their confrontation, Batman repeatedly beat up Joker and managed to knock him off the balcony, but Joker reached up with both of his arms and pulled both Batman and Vicki down. Batman and Vicki held on for dear life from a narrow ledge, while Joker insanely taunted them. Joker's helicopter then arrived to get Joker to safety.

   After taunting Batman and Vicki one last time, Joker began to climb the helicopter's rope ladder. Batman fired a bolo launcher that then tied Joker's ankle to a large stone gargoyle. As the Joker clung to the rope ladder, struggling to get free, the gargoyle broke loose and sealed his fate by starting to slowly drag him down rung by rung.
  </p>
  <p key="2ea46c94-45da-4f75-ad07-b8fa6afdafcd">
   Unable to break free from the heavy burden of the gargoyle and now on the last rung of the rope ladder, Joker finally lost his grip, fell to his death, and hit the Cathedral's flight of steps below hard, which then broke every bone in his body.
  </p>
  <p key="d88aa3be-b017-4d16-947d-0f28e32fc116">
   Commissioner Gordon and the rest of the GCPD then came upon Joker's body and heard a repetitive laugh. Puzzled, Gordon wondered where the laughter was coming from until he reached into Joker's tailcoat and pulled out a laugh box that was activated by the landing.

   Though the madness of the Joker was ended forever, the decline of the Gotham mob and the Joker's initial rise paved the way for the appearance of numerous villains. These ranged from those within Gotham's higher society with dubious leads, such as
   Max Shreck
   , and criminals with similar theatrics to Napier, such as
   Penguin
   and
   Catwoman
   . Several different accounts claimed that Joker left varying degrees of influence on Batman and Gotham City.

  <p key="1ee38dbf-dace-4be9-93b6-bb3eebec7eef">
   Jack Napier was seen as quite vain, with a penchant for nice suits and Alicia Hunt as his trophy girlfriend. In contrast to Joker, Napier was quite humorless, though when he committed his crimes, he made large smiles on his face (after he murdered the Waynes' or when he enjoyed killing Eckhardt). However, Napier was still equally as psychotic, although not as outwardly, with hints of his psychopathic nature that oozed out when he watched Harvey Dent's speech about making Gotham safe for decent people, noted that "decent people" needed to move elsewhere and also stated he'd "hand [Dent's] lungs to him by now" should Dent even dare try to move in against Grissom, which showed that Napier had no qualms with killing any threats to the mob in an extremely graphic manner. Napier was also not above murdering children, as he was clearly preparing to execute Bruce Wayne on a whim after he murdered his parents and would have gone through with it with zero remorse had Chill not told him to flee the scene. Even prior to killing Grissom upon becoming the Joker as revenge for being set up, Napier mentioned that Grissom was a tired old man who "couldn't run the city without [Napier]", which indicated that he was treacherous against his boss and was content with waiting until the mob boss died before he could take over the mob. Napier's treachery was also retained after he became the Joker, where told his friend, Bob, that he was his number one guy in a very similar manner to how Grissom himself told Jack that right before he sent him off to Axis Chemicals to die, which implied that he may have been planning a similar fate for Bob in the future. While he discussed Grissom and Eckhardt's future within the mob, Eckhardt retorted to Napier that he was: "
   <i key="1d4d1f98-1f6b-46a7-93ef-f792c5409815">
    An A-1 nut boy
   </i>
   ". After he read Napier's Police File Report, Bruce summed up to the Joker his opinion of what he was before: "
   <i key="3e1883fe-3ab3-4938-bd5f-22816abae979">
    Mean kid, bad seed, hurt people (...) he got sloppy, you know crazy, he started to lose it. He had a head full of bad wiring, I guess. Couldn't keep it straight up here. He was the kind of guy who couldn't hear the train until it was two feet from him. (...) Well... he made mistakes. Then he had his lights out!
   </i>
   ".
  </p>
  <p key="9fbb90b4-ddb2-4378-acda-40973fe86572">
   Like many criminals before him, Napier was just as terrified of Batman when he first met him. However, after he became the Joker, Napier had absolutely no fear of Batman, and, in fact, not only was he unphased by Batman vowing to kill him, but reminded Batman bluntly that he was the reason why Joker existed, and even when told that he himself had been responsible for Batman's existence, he didn't lose his composure and continued to mock him.
  </p>
  <p key="b6aa36dc-e3c9-4101-b8d0-4ab3c9a46d5c">
   When he sought out surgery after he fell into the vat of chemicals, it was possible that Napier finally lost his remaining sanity upon seeing his new appearance, although he explained to Batman that he tried to get over it. As a result, the Joker was born cackling madly. Joker also was shown to "talk" to Antoine Rotelli's corpse as if he were still alive and was even "told" by him to "grease" the remaining mobsters at the summit, although it was unclear whether he genuinely believed that he was being told that by Rotelli or was simply mocking the deceased mobster, as shortly afterwards, he laughed exhilarated over his own words about how he's "
   <i key="ac958040-cd88-433b-8cec-f3a8abac3cb1">
    glad that [Rotelli's] dead
   </i>
   ". Throughout the film, the Joker had skills for using all sorts of gadgets as weapons. Joker killed a mob boss with a quill, another with a supercharged
   Joy Buzzer
   , and was frequently seen using an
   <a href="Acid Flower.html" key="24e75bb1-c630-4fa1-935c-1b7c27dec7b6" title="Acid Flower">
    Acid Flower
   </a>
   . Also, Joker had a tendency to wear gag chattering teeth so that he could shock the enemy if he was punched in the face long enough to attempt a retaliatory blow, as he attempted to do with Batman in their final encounter.
  </p>
  <p key="5f33cb2b-7a2f-4f72-b79e-829f1bb98bf0">
   In addition to his trademark gadgets, the Joker also had a macabre sense of humor, which was both surreal and morbid. The Joker was also quite sadistic, as seen when he shot Grissom and laughed, deliberately disfigured Alicia (it's strongly implied also that he threw her to her death out of a window) and found humor in killing Mob boss, Rotelli. It's also implied that when he killed Grissom, that Joker actually seemed to enjoy death in itself, and not just the deaths of other people, and even went as far as referred to it as "
   <i key="cb69dc8e-a673-4941-a994-ee4e4cd1146e">
    therapy
   </i>
   " from his experience. That belief was contradicted near the end of the film, though, when Joker was seen screaming as he fell to his death. However, that might have been because there was no way that he could have survived.
