   discovers that Joe Chill, the small-time crime boss he is investigating, is none other than the man who killed his parents. Batman confronts him and reveals his secret identity. The frightened Chill flees, seeks out his cohorts, explains the encounter, and begs for their protection. Once they learn that Chill's actions led to the hated Batman's existence, they instead turn on their boss and fatally shoot him. Luckily for Batman, Chill did not specify any names while explaining his hand in the crime-fighter's origin. A moment later, the men realize how valuable Chill's knowledge is to them. Before the dying Chill has a chance to reveal Batman's identity, Batman catches up and renders the goons unconscious. Chill dies addressing Batman as Bruce, and the two make a kind of peace with one another.

   #673), Joe was a mid-level crime boss. He had built the Land, Sea, Air Transport company from the ground up (most likely through illegal means). Any crimes he committed, including the Waynes' murder, he blamed on class warfare. In this story, Batman has visited and frightened Chill every night for a month. Chill is living as a shut in, but his guards never see or catch Batman during the visits. On his final visit, Batman gives Chill the gun he used to kill the Waynes. There is one bullet left within it (possibly meant for Bruce). Chill finally realizes who Batman is, and that he was the one who created the Batman. Fearing what his fellow gangsters would do to him if they found out, it is implied that he takes his own life with the gun.

Chill notes that he was there at the birth of The Batman, and it is only fitting he should be there to witness the end.

One night, a policeman wants to bring Mr. Wayne in for questioning, and when he refuses, the officer opens fire; this Earth's version of Bruce and his mother are killed. Chill comes out of the alley to discover the dead bodies. The Waynes' elder son, Thomas Wayne Junior, leaves with Chill. Junior would later become

   Chill of the Night!
   " voiced by Peter Onorati. Batman finds a lead in the case of who murdered his parents is Joe Chill while the Spectre and the Phantom Stranger watch. After much investigation, Batman locates a dying Lew Moxon, who reveals that Chill was a hitman working for Moxon, who shoots Thomas and Martha Wayne out of spite. Batman interrogates several villains, including
   Louie the Lilac
   , about Chill and the Wayne murders, and is also shown scenes from the past about Chill by the Spectre. In the present day, Chill is an arms dealer who sells weapons to super-criminals on the black market. When Batman confronts him and reveals himself as Bruce Wayne, a terrified Chill asks for the villains (consisting of the Joker, the Mad Hatter, Mr. Freeze, the Penguin, Poison Ivy, Solomon Grundy, and Two-Face) for help, but they attempt to kill him for "creating" Batman". Batman foils the villains, but the Spectre manipulates the events so that Joe Chill dies when he ends up collapsed by debris as a result of Batman redirecting the sonic gun that was to be auctioned toward the ceiling. This marked the first time in animation that Batman confronted his parents' killer.

   during a nightmare in which Bruce relived his parents' death within Crime Alley. After murdering Thomas Wayne when the man defended his wife from Chill's attempt to grab her pearl necklace, Joe then shot Martha dead to silence her screams. Chill turned his gun to a young Bruce Wayne, preaching to him that heroic deeds only get people killed, like his father before him, but ultimately let the boy live.

   The bio of Joe Chill within the batcomputer detailed that Joe was a suspect in a series of burglaries, muggings, and murders, aside from his actions in Crime Alley. It was confirmed that Joe was never found or brought to justice by either the police or Batman himself. His ultimate fate was left as an intentional loose end to serve as a contributing factor for Batman's never-ending resolve to fight crime.

   At the time of his murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne, Joe appeared to be middle-aged, balding, had a comb-over, several missing teeth and tattoos, and wore a brown leather jacket, tattered white undershirt, jeans, boots, and an empty watch band.

   It was implied that Bruce's nightmare of Chill was a component of an intense hallucination of Joker's creation, due to the villain's blood now flowing through the hero's veins after the events of Arkham City and slowly began to take control of his mind, using the memories of his parents' murder to further taunt him.
