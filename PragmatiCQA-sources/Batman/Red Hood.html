   The Red Hood first appeared in Detective Comics #168 "The Man Behind the Red Hood (February 1951). In it, Joker attempted to relive his time as the Red Hood after Batman and Robin held a presentation at a college on how to do detective sleuthing, although a gardener had managed to ambush him and stole his costume. Batman eventually stopped the Red Hood, although he deduced the man who used the costume was an imposter. Joker then revealed that he had been the Red Hood of the past, and explained that he had intended to steal over a million dollars from his boss at the

   and then retire, but then Batman interfered. He ultimately survived falling into the vat via a special apparatus in his Red Hood that allowed him to retain oxygen and swam all the way back. When he got back to his home, and removed his Red Hood, he noticed that his body had been discolored from exposure to the chemicals, and decided to adopt the identity of The Joker.

   . Like in the above comic, the Joker was the Red Hood during that time, although it was revealed that he was not the sole holder of the identity (and in fact, was simply the latest to hold the title), and he had more sympathetic and tragic motivations for becoming it: A man named Jack had a pregnant wife,

   appeared and cornered him on the plant's catwalk. Terrified, he jumped off the catwalk into the chemical basin to escape, swam to freedom, and survived because of a special breathing apparatus that was built into the helmet. The toxins in the vat permanently and grotesquely disfigured him, and turned his hair green, his skin white, and his lips red. Upon discovering that, Jack went insane, and became The Joker. On a related note, how Jack discovered the deformity was altered from the above comic, as he was shown to have discovered it almost immediately afterwards, and was even shown to be in agony from exposure to the chemicals as well as confused as to why he burned and itched all over before he noticed his new appearance. After they believed Jack to be dead, the mob then hired a corrupt police officer to take his wife out. He succeeded, and Jack's wife, along with their unborn baby, burned to death in an alleged "accidental" electric fire. That all occured as

Strangely enough, Joker himself was reluctant to admit that this iteration of his story was definitive, and stated: "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"

   The only other occasion that the Joker ever took up the identity of the Red Hood again was after his latest scheme had been thwarted. After he sought to restore confidence in his abilities, the Joker donned the domed helmet and tuxedo of the Red Hood again and committed a crime in Batman #450 (1990).

   In the New 52 continuity, the Red Hood was already a violent anarchistic nihilist before his fall into chemicals. His incarnation of the Red Hood Gang was largely composed of normal Gotham citizens which he used blackmail to force into his gang. Red Hood's motivations revolved around destruction and nihilism which he believed were the only truths of the world, especially Gotham.

   He became a recurring enemy of the vigilante who would come to become Batman who proved himself to be a persisting thorn in his side. In order to combat the supposed hope which the vigilante was bringing, Red Hood started stealing chemicals to turn the ACE Chemicals Plant into a giant chemical cocktail bomb. The plan was foiled however by Batman which resulted in a fire at the chemical plant. After a fight with the Batman, rather than surrendering the Red Hood willingly leaped off of a cat-walk into a vat of boiling chemicals which should have killed him.

After he was enraged that Batman didn't avenge him, Jason located the Joker, stole the Red Hood outfit (but not before he beat him brutally), and took up the mantle of the second Red Hood. He used aggression and fear to control strong gangs and the mob, and supposedly saved the city. Jason was then found out of his activities by Batman. They argued over their theories of crime-fighting through combat, and Jason eventually showed his face and confirmed Batman's suspicion.

   episode, "Deep Cover for Batman!" and was voiced by
   Jeff Bennett
   . That version was a heroic alternate reality version of
   The Joker
   . Like the Joker, that Red Hood was disfigured after he fell into a chemical vat at the Ace Chemical Plant. In his case, he was already a superhero and was actively dropped in by
   Owlman
   . However, his sanity was said to have been "bent, but not broken." Red Hood then tried to rally his world's heroes (alternate versions of the villains from the "normal" universe) against the Injustice Syndicate, but they were defeated. Red Hood escaped and tried to use a device to recruit help from an alternate Earth (Batman's Universe), but he was captured by the Syndicate.

   After Batman was attacked by his alternate-reality doppelganger, Owlman (sent to Batman's universe on a reconnaissance mission), he journeyed to Red Hood's dimension. During scenes in that episode, the Red Hood's face was shown, but was in shadow, which showed a bit of green hair, white skin, and a wide grin that clearly resembled the Joker. After the heroes were freed and the villains were defeated, Red Hood thanked Batman and hoped that his counterpart could return the favor. Sure enough, in the next episode, "Game Over for Owlman," Batman was forced to team-up with the Joker in order to defeat Owlman, who impersonated Batman and ruined his reputation in his absence.

   That Red Hood was shown to be an extremely capable fighter, and was able to hold his own against multiple members of the Injustice Syndicate. In addition, he wielded projectile weapons that were shaped like spades (a reference to his alternate universe counterpart's playing card motif).

   's presence in the plot (and his psychiatric evaluation), the Red Hood was alluded to on the crime-board in the
   Batcave
   , which was listed under the second row, as well as on a separate billboard. According to the information, in addition to the Red Hood's role in the Ace Chemicals Heist, the Red Hood also had undergone several daring heists and major scores. His schemes were detrimental enough to
   Gotham City
   for Mayor
   Hill
   to make the apprehension of Red Hood a high priority for the

   Batman
   wasn't sure if that was actually Red Hood who did it. His actions ended up costing Gotham $1,000,000, at least at the time that the report was made. Commissioner
   Loeb
   later claimed that Red Hood was "run out of the city." Batman also speculated whether Red Hood was in fact several criminals who used the moniker. Sometime after that, the Red Hood case went cold.

   After being unmasked during his confrontation with Batman, Jason began to realize that Bruce was truly sorry for what had happened to him with the Joker. Jason tracked Batman after he surrendered to
   Scarecrow

Arriving, he easily dispatched the goons and cornered Black Mask. Sionis continuously pleaded with Red Hood for his life, and offered him drugs, money, weapons, and even promised to leave Gotham and go anywhere that he wanted. Red Hood's response: "How about you go to Hell!" Before he left, Jason added: "Say hi to Joker for me." before he set off into the streets.
