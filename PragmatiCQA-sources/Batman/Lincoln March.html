He had made the pin for her at school in ceramics. It was a little heart with one side bigger than the other side. Both of his parents died in a car accident where the other driver was drunk. After that, he was hopeless. After school he went to college and "Gotham saved him".

   When Batman finally catches up to Lincoln in Gotham's abandoned Children's Hospital, Lincoln reveals that the court rescued him from the children’s hospital, not due to his natural talents, but rather his family blood line. Lincoln reveals that in fact he is Bruce Wayne's younger brother Thomas Wayne Jr., explaining that when Bruce was three years old, a pregnant

As a result, the Wayne’s placed Lincoln into the best hospital money could buy. When Lincoln was 4, he made Martha the heart shaped pendant that she is wearing in the painting hanging above Bruce's fireplace. However, the very next year,

Once it was under new, corrupt management, Lincoln and all the other patients were subjected to abuse, malnutrition and neglect.

  <p key="0515501b-baaf-4196-aa7f-194b7c09f5b1">
   Lincoln has placed the blame of his parent’s death squarely on Bruce's shoulders, vowing to avenge their deaths by killing Bruce and taking his rightful place as a Wayne.  Additionally, Batman noted that without a proper DNA analysis, it is impossible to know if March's claims about his lineage are actually true.
