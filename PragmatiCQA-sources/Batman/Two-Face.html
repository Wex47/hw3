  </h2>
  <p key="78aabc40-150f-4ebf-8038-446146550f60">
   Harvey Dent's childhood consisted of hardship. Growing up under an abusive father, he developed repressed mental-illnesses of his own, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. His hard work ethic, however, allowed him to rise up to become Gotham City's youngest district attorney at the age of 26.
  </p>
  <p key="a25aa9a3-10da-4419-91e5-37ed93cf060a">
   Dent was nicknamed "Apollo" by the media due to the fact that he was charming, good-looking, and seemingly untouchable. He was dedicated to his job of upholding law and order, and became one of the first supporters, allies, and even friends of Batman.
  </p>
  <p key="cbadbd10-420c-4d6b-b4ea-f6481e041f77">
   At the time of his job as a district attorney, the worst criminal threat in Gotham City was
   <a href="Carmine Falcone.html" key="af4f73df-02b0-435a-b7eb-76d08adf7936" title="Carmine Falcone">
    Carmine "the Roman" Falcone
   </a>
   . He forged a triumvirate with Batman and
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Commissioner Gordon.html" key="bc1780c0-213f-4fe1-987c-3f73bc070232" title="Commissioner Gordon">
    Commissioner Gordon
   </a>
   to bring the man down within the law, no matter what the cost. His slightly angrier temperament led Batman and Commissioner Gordon to develop a slight distrust for him, believing that it was slightly possible that he could be the vigilante dubbed "
   Holiday
   ." The alliance ended tragically when Sal "Boss" Maroni, believing Dent to be responsible for the death of his father, threw acid in his face during a trial. Dent was horribly scarred on the left side of his face.
  </p>
  <p key="ee055caa-beea-4634-8672-61e5070a29f5">
   Dent escaped from the hospital and descended into madness. He became obsessed with duality and opposites, and developed a second persona, the villainous Two-Face, to compliment the law &amp; order obsessed Dent. As Two-Face, his trademark was crimes involving the number two. His obsession even shows in his clothes, which are usually composed of two halves made out of very different materials. At all times, he carries a double-sided
   <a href="Two-Face's Coin.html" key="42166516-3168-4d79-960e-489259c61131" title="Two-Face's Coin">
    coin
   </a>
   with one side defaced, which he constantly flips to make any choices. Two-Face flips the coin at critical junctures: The scarred side would usually result in a crime, but the clean side would allow Two-Face to do the right thing, such as returning his loot or refraining from a murder.

    Early career
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="85f7dd29-2698-4ac8-b285-1f0abb7208a1">
   After his first few encounters with Batman, Two-Face attempted to abandon all ties with his own past life, including his loving wife
   Gilda
   . This, however, proved too much for the good side of his personality, and he began attempting to visit Gilda, claiming he had regained his face through plastic surgery. Gilda, however, soon saw through the fabrication, and this unhinged Dent even more. Finally, he was apprehended by Batman, with the help of his partner,
   <a href="Dick Grayson.html" key="59f1fdf6-764b-462c-b59a-99471ce1a53d" title="Dick Grayson">
    Robin
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p key="96372356-f50f-4f8e-9ace-5f0cc87ee1b6">
   Shortly after, a certain Dr. Ekhart performed plastic surgery on Dent's face, seemingly repairing it for good. While the facial reconstruction managed to partially heal Two-Face's fractured mind, Ekhart's assistant, Mr. Wilkins, began to place suspicion on Harvey Dent once more by committing crimes disguised as Two-Face. Batman, however, saw through the disguise and helped Two-Face clear his name. For two years, Dent led a normal life until actor
   Paul Sloane
   , scarred in the same manner as Dent had once been, was driven mad, beginning to think he was really Dent as Two-Face. Batman arrested Sloane for several attempted robberies and had his face restored, in the same manner Harvey Dent's had once been.
  </p>
  <p key="b7ffa864-0c3c-4130-932f-21b3c7abb78d">
   Dent, however, was caught in an explosion a few years later, which undid the plastic surgery and scarred his face once again. Maddened again, the revived Two-Face hired the
   Crime Doctor
   to kidnap Paul Sloane and scar the actor's face again, to mirror the transformation that had occurred in Dent. Although restored as Two-Face's twin, Sloane proved more fortunate, and had his face repaired again after being rescued by Batman. Dent, meanwhile, was brought to justice again and placed behind bars, with his renewed mental and physical scarring seemingly more permanent this time.

   Two-Face is not consistently evil; every time he contemplates a crime, he flips his two-headed coin. Only if the coin came up scratched-side did Two-Face go ahead and commit the crime, never questioning the result of the toss. This compulsion is a compromise between Dent's evil "Two-Face" personality and his former, law-abiding self. Over the years, he has been shown to rely on the coin to different degrees. Sometimes to decide whether or not to commit a crime, sometimes to decide whether or not to do something good, like save someone. He will even go out of his way to do good deeds if the coin mandates. Since Two-Face is hideously scarred on the left half of his face, he plays up to it with clothing that is differently styled and materialized on one side. Two-Face also carries his obsession with the number "two" in his choice of weapon, twin .22 automatics, with which he is extremely skilled and intelligent. His psychotic obsession with duality and his designing crimes around the number two often leads to his downfall. In the questionable "

With the die, instead of only good and evil, he is given six different options, and with the tarot, 78. Two-Face is shown to be completely dependent, and is unable to even decide to go to the bathroom before sorting through the cards. However, he did end up getting his coin back, and also showed a rare case of giving a different fate than the coin foretold: He set Batman free despite the coin landing bad side up. During Countdown, when he is being deported to the "Hell Planet" along with the other villains in Salvation Run, Pied Piper and the Trickster offer to break him out of Belle Reve after defeating his escorting guards. Two-Face flips the coin, and it comes up un-scarred, so he declines, and instead simply waits patiently in the middle of the hallway for more security guards to show up.

    He was replaced by
    False Face
    in the 1960s television series of "Batman" because Two-Face would have been too gruesome. However, in 1968
    Harlan Ellison
    wrote a Two-Face episode, supposedly Clint Eastwood was cast for the role, but before it could go anywhere the show was cancelled. Interestingly, Eastwood's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" co-star
    Eli Wallach
    played
    Mr. Freeze
    in the same show.

      Two-Face became the main villain of "Batman '66: The Lost Episode", a comic that's part of the comic book continuation of the series. His origin is similar to the mainstream version but the character was altered to fit the world of the comic.

    In K.A. Applegate's young adult book series, Remnants, a female character named 2face appears. Like Harvey Dent, this 2Face had half her face severely burned. At the beginning of the series, she is one of the main characters, and tries to survive; however, she later becomes more of a villain. The author has stated that 2face is indeed based on Two-Face from the Batman mythos.

    All of Two-Face's incarnations followed a certain design scheme when it came to the scarred left half of his face. The left eye always appeared to be bulging, sometimes due to the fact that the eyelid was burned away, while the teeth were exposed due to the lips also being burnt away. The only Two-Face to break this pattern was the one played by Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever. This incarnation's left eye was not bulging, while the teeth were not exposed.

    Although the giant penny is considered to be canonically known as an item that Two-Face attempted to use to crush Batman; it was in fact first used by the
    Penny Plunderer
    , a villain who has since been ret-conned out of Batman's rogue gallery.
