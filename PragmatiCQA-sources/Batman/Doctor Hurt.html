   to swear allegiance to him in order to save Grayson's life. However, Grayson and Damian had already anticipated his attack, Grayson surviving Doctor Hurt's attack relatively unharmed while Doctor Hurt's attempts to open the box that Bruce Wayne left in the past revealing nothing but a Batarang and a note saying "Gotcha!", the room subsequently filling with smoke as another Batman appears, marking Bruce Wayne's return to the fold. In the subsequent confrontation, Doctor Hurt attempts — and fails — to trap Bruce Wayne in a prison in the Batcave, but nevertheless escapes through the cave's water access while Bruce is busy rescuing Alfred. Having escaped to a graveyard, Hurt is confronted and defeated by the Joker. The Joker doses Doctor Hurt with Joker venom and buries him alive, claiming that he proved to be a disappointment as a "new" archenemy. The Joker claims that he has "taken care" of Doctor Hurt, but Bruce Wayne is not quite willing to believe that the Doctor is truly dead.
