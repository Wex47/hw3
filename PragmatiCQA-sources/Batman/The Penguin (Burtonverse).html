  </h3>
  <p key="ffd25c09-7bf7-428e-bbc1-cc817b3761e4">
   Oswald was born to privileged Cobblepot family. His father,
   Tucker
   , was a prominent District Attorney and his mother,
   Esther
   , was active in the
   DAR
   . Esther gave birth to Oswald in the halls of
   Cobblepot Manor
   on a snowy December night. Oswald's parents and the doctor reacted in shock and horror at the monstrously deformed baby boy.
  </p>
  <p key="6bb4bbd9-0bd0-450b-93eb-4926c5adfd5c">
   In the following days, Oswald displayed unusual strength, coordination, and aggression for a newborn. Because Oswald was uncontrollable, Tucker and Esther locked him in a iron box, where he showed his first sign of homicidal tendencies when he grabbed and attacked the family cat from behind the bars. Ashamed and frightened, Tucker and Esther ventured out on Christmas Eve into the
   Gotham City
   Central Park, near the Old Zoo. At a small bridge, they dumped Oswald's carriage in a drainage stream. Eventually, Oswald washed up onto the shore at
   Arctic World
   where he was discovered by a group of large Emperor Penguins.
  </p>
  <p key="69b62de4-861a-488f-9045-1798bc4f2680">
   Not much was known of Penguin's early life from then on, except that he basically ran off to join the Red Triangle Circus. His parents died at a relatively young age, under mysterious circumstances.
   What became of their mansion and fortune was unknown. Eventually, the circus returned to town for two weeks and featured newly added attractions to their freak-show: the
   Poodle Lady
   , the
   Fat Clown
   , and an Aquatic Bird Boy. The circus's two week stay was put to an end early because while guests were at the circus, their children went missing. One of the freak-show performers vanished before he could be questioned, and some said that it was the Aquatic Bird Boy. By that time, Oswald was nicknamed 'Penguin' by his fellow freaks due to being born with flipper-like hands and a beak-like nose.
  </p>
  <p key="98343a52-0081-4fdd-bdfe-9b56476db3e8">
   The Penguin then retreated to the abandoned Old Zoo, in order to hide from the
   GCPD
   . That was where his nickname was put to use rather literally. He then went back to Arctic World. Penguin was able to track down fellow members of the Red Triangle Circus and swayed them to crime after they were disgraced and were out of work. After he occupied society's lowest level, Penguin became obsessed with spying on the upper class by sorting through their waste and learning their secrets. Penguin used a
   Duck Cart
   from a sky ride at the Old Zoo to get around the massive labyrinth of Gotham's sewers easily. Batman and the

   brought a new level of lunacy to criminality of the city, and in the midst of their battle, the mob control of the city crumbled following the deaths of
   Carl Grissom
   ,
   Vinnie Ricorso
   and
   Antoine Rotelli
   . After he was likely influenced by their recent deeds, Penguin began to fashion his own theatrical gadgets and frightening masks for his gang at the age of 30.

  <p key="52d01792-fef4-413b-81fe-ecde829e6b02">
   Thirty-three years after his birth, Oswald set his sights on a multimillionaire named Max Shreck, who, after the fall of the
   Grissom
   Mob, had become the most powerful man in city, but by seemingly "legitimate" means. To arrange Shreck's kidnapping, Oswald had the Red Triangle Gang attack
   Gotham Plaza
   . Penguin observed the onslaught from the safety of a sewer grate, where he watched Max flee from his henchmen. Oswald then ran to another area where Max stood above one of the gang's secret sewer vent doors. Penguin caught Shreck, knocked him unconscious. and brought him to his lair. Oswald then told Shreck that had he desired to "reemerge" in society and went on a disingenuous spiel: Oswald claimed that he wanted to learn his name and find his parents. Although Max seemed to form a slight empathetic expression, he bluntly asked exactly why he should help him. Penguin then blackmailed Shreck with incriminating evidence of his more dubious activities, such as the toxic waste from his "clean" textile plant, documents that proved that Shreck had owned half the firetraps in Gotham (which Shreck had shredded, but with a little patience, the Penguin had carefully taped them back together), and his ex-partner,
   Fred Atkins
   ' hand (Max told everyone that Fred was on paid vacation). That then prompted Shreck to agree in helping Penguin gain acceptance from the public.

   Shreck arranged for the Penguin to "rescue" Mayor
   Roscoe Jenkins
   '
   Son
   from an
   Acrobatic Thug
   . The plan worked, and Penguin became a hero to all, with the exception of a suspicious Bruce Wayne. After he found out his original birth name of Oswald Cobblepot (as well as the names of Gotham's first born sons), Penguin went to visit the cemetery where his biological parents were now buried and placed roses on their grave out of respect, telling Gotham's citizens that he forgave them for their abandonment (whether he truly did has never been revealed).

   After he encountered Batman and

   while he took a walk around his future constituency at night, Penguin was contacted by Catwoman the following day, who noted that she and Penguin shared a hatred for Batman. Although Penguin stated that he already planned to sabotage the
   Batmobile
   , Catwoman noted that Batman would have more power as a martyr, and that the only way to truly destroy him was to frame him and turn him into one of the criminals that he despised.

   When the subsequent plan was put into action, Batman was framed for kidnapping and murder of the
   Ice Princess
   and found himself trapped in the Batmobile under Penguin's remote control. However, Catwoman and Penguin's alliance fell apart when she rebuffed a sexual advance from him, and Penguin tried to kill her himself with the use of his umbrella-copter, which locked her in a choke hold far above the city. Unknown to Penguin, Catwoman eventually ripped free directly above a greenhouse, and, once again, narrowly escaped certain death.

   The Penguin's campaign to oust the Mayor was quickly destroyed when Bruce played selected comments that Penguin made that insulted the people of Gotham when he controlled the Batmobile at one of Penguin's speeches, the most prominent phrase: "

   " The people of Gotham got angry and threw eggs and produce at Oswald. When Oswald looked back at Max, Max simply shrugged and abandoned him on stage. Penguin then reacted with rage, opened fire on the crowd with his machine gun umbrella, and the GCPD chased after him. Oswald made his way to Gotham Central Park and exchanged gunfire with the GCPD all the while. As fate would have it, Oswald came upon the same old bridge and stream that his parents had dumped him and dove in. After he used his arcane diving and swimming skill, Penguin swiftly escaped the GCPD's gunfire and found the Duck Car where he had left it in the sewer. Penguin then traveled back into the Old Zoo, and revealed his original plan: kidnap and kill the first born sons of Gotham's most prominent families in revenge (comparable to the Pharaoh killing the first-born Hebrew babies in the beginning of the Book of Exodus in the Bible) and drown them in the waters of his lair, which he poisoned with the toxic waste that was taken from Shreck's textile plant for the occasion. Penguin then sent his best henchman,
   Organ Grinder
   , to drive the
   Red Triangle Circus Train
   while the rest his troops fanned out across town, in order to place the children in animal cages.

   After he realized that Batman was closing in on him, and, after he saw the rest of the Red Triangle Gang flee, Penguin rushed over to his duck boat. He grabbed one of his umbrellas along the way, on his vehicle he activated its surprise amphibious capability, as a set of dix off-road tires took the duck vehicle directly up a staircase. As he turned the corner of the Arctic World entrance, the colossal

   Penguin then quickly scuttled out and hid under the Batskiboat. Batman emerged and surveyed the wreckage, but Penguin managed to elude the Dark Knight briefly and attacked him from behind. After he choked Batman with his umbrella, Penguin unsheathed a blade from the tip. Batman then took out a remote control from his

Cobblepot fell for Batman's simple tactics after he became enraged, breaking his blade against his duck wreckage after side stepping and guiding Penguin toward it. After Penguin gawked at his broken weapon he knocked the remote from Batman's hand, not noticing that he was now holding completely still, allowing him do so. Batman followed up by quickly taking the umbrella from Penguin, knocking him toward the remote with it.

   Penguin picked up the remote with triumphant glee, pressing the blinking red button which caused the Penguin Commandos' missiles to fire. Then, the Batskiboat released a flock of bats which surrounded Penguin. While he tried to avoid them, Penguin fell backwards through the large window of his lair and into the poisoned water below. Batman was unable to save him, much like the Ice Princess. Meanwhile, the Penguin Commandos continued to fire their missiles, which destroyed most of the zoo surface.

   Later, following the final confrontation between Catwoman, and Shreck, which culminated in Catwoman killing Shreck with an
   O-Mega Taser
   and a high-powered electric cable from Penguin's generator, the unmasked Batman desperately looked through the debris for Catwoman. In a vulnerable state, when he had just awoken from a daze, a mortally wounded Penguin emerged from the water and was eager to kill Batman. Penguin then lumbered toward his umbrella barrel and struggled to breathe. By the time that Bruce sensed Penguin's presence, it was too late and rose to face him.

    , had re-imagined the character not as an eloquent gentleman of crime, but as a physically deformed lunatic with a childhood trauma. While that Penguin retained a number of trademarks, particularly the variety of trick umbrellas and the use of a monocle, he was given a huge visual makeover: His hands were flippers, with a thumb and index finger, and the remaining three fingers were fused together. Where the comic version varied between a full head of hair and varying degrees of thinning, that Penguin was bald, with his remaining length of hair long and stringy. Instead of a tuxedo, he wore a more Gothic, Victorian-style outfit, with a jabot as opposed to a bow tie. Other instances showed Penguin in black boots, a bib-like cloth around his neck, and something akin to a child's blanket sleeper, or the old long john-style underwear of the 1800's. Combined with his long dark coat, the full white front of the bodysuit gave Penguin an even more penguin-like appearance. One visual aspect that remained fairly intact in that re-imagining was the familiar top hat. Another new touch was his large yellow Duck Car, which had the triple functionality of being a boat, a car, and an elevator-like lift.

Strick pitched an alternative approach, that was inspired by the Moses parallels of Waters' prologue, in which the infant Oswald Cobblepot was bundled in a basket and thrown in the river where he floated helplessly until he's saved (and subsequently raised) by Gotham's sewer denizens. He then came up with Penguin's "master plan" to kill the firstborn sons of Gotham. Both the studio and Burton were impressed with the idea, though Strick claimed that the toy manufacturers were worried.

    Universal's Stage 12 housed the Penguin's underground lair, an enormous tank that was filled with half-a-million gallons of water and a simulated ice floe island. In order to create Penguin's bird army, a combination of techniques were utilized including men in suits, computer-generated imagery, robotic creatures and real life penguins. Everyone involved was required to sign a document guaranteeing that they would not specifically hold interviews with news sources. About midway through filming, however, a few test shots of DeVito in costume found their way into an American entertainment magazine. Warner Brothers then hired a group of private investigators to track down the source, though the ploy ultimately failed.
