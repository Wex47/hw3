        The midwinter day was warm enough
that Celaena Sardothien didn’t bother with gloves when she set out into
Rifthold.

      <p key="87079929-d44f-4b2d-b45d-c6bdb5ad6e38">

        Princess Nehemia however, was
thoroughly miserable. Still, she declined Celaena’s repeated offers to take a
carriage to the most fashionable avenue of the capital city. Traveling by
carriage would only make the day go faster, the princess said. And since they’d
claimed the day solely for enjoying each other’s company, neither young woman
was in much of a hurry to see it quickly end.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="345b86d6-d902-4ab8-9f62-a39bee3507cc">

        So they walked through Rifthold,
dressed as finely as they could while still being warm—and remaining relatively
unnoticed. They took their time crossing the city, though they had an unspoken
agreement not to venture near the docks, warehouses, or anywhere they might run
into any living proof of Adarlan’s empire—and brutal conquest of the continent.
       </span>

        Having spent a year as a slave
herself, and not particularly inclined to discuss the topics of slavery, war,
and the general hellishness of the world, Celaena was more than happy to stick
to the broad, clean streets where they could pretend to be two young women on
their way to spend obscene amounts of money.
       </span>
      </p>

        Nehemia had already toured much of
the city and disliked almost all of what she’d seen, but still indulged Celaena
in a detour to walk past the Royal Theater, in going into her favorite bakeries
and sweet-shops, and popping into a few bookstores. Unsurprisingly, by the time
they reached Kavill’s, the finest clothier in Rifthold, Celaena had spent a
good chunk of her monthly salary as King’s Champion.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="b288fa0c-ec87-4d1f-8ed4-5c596aba4179">
       <span key="2a2e30f6-aa6a-471b-82a4-3f771f246666" style="color: black">
        That was another topic they’d agreed
to ignore for the day.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="f55546a2-cdc1-4786-af0f-284c56b73637">

        The two young women paused outside
the front of the shop, and Celaena ran an eye over the gilded woodwork
wreathing the glass window. Two dresses were displayed—one a somewhat
traditional blue ball gown, edged with gold and splashes of turquoise; the
other a daring work of red velvet, long-sleeved and accented with midnight
lace.
       </span>

        “Kavill’s,” Nehemia read on the
ornate shop sign swinging in the breeze off the Avery River. The princess
frowned at Celaena. “It’s very… fancy,” she said in Eyllwe.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="e1dbdf34-9187-4344-9768-4169a9465b7b">

        Indeed, beyond the glass and the
display, Celaena could see a cluster of well-dressed women offering advice to a
companion showing off a potential purchase.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="a01cb7f9-5e0c-4b1b-9c82-cb01e211d916">

        Celaena hid her own frown. They were
supposed to have a private appointment. Not just for the safety of the
princess, whose personal guards trailed behind them, but also to put
Nehemia—who hated shopping and playing dress-up and anything ‘useless’—at some
degree of ease.
       </span>

        “We’re a few minutes early, I
think,” Celaena said. Nehemia was still frowning at the storefront. “We could
pop into a tea shop if you want and—”

        “No, no. My hands are frozen
through,” Nehemia said, her gloved fingers curling into fists. “Let’s just go
in and wait.”

      <p key="82299573-7d1d-4531-aa41-761f6e532bc3">

        It had been a month since Celaena
had been appointed King’s Champion—a month during which she’d had to face all
the hardships the position presented—but somehow the thought of walking into Kavill’s’s
with an already ill-tempered Nehemia made even Celaena’s nerves fray. She
already pitied Lee Kavill himself…and the other customers inside.
       </span>

Eyllwe as Nehemia walked to the green-painted door, “I’m Lillian Gordaina and I
am just some—”

        “Heiress in Rifthold, I know,”
Nehemia finished without looking back at her, and walked inside.

        Celaena followed after the princess,
giving Nehemia’s two personal guards a nod as they moved into position: one by
the storefront, the other going around the block to take up a spot by the back
door. Once the appointment began, no one went in or out.

        Familiar, for in the years Celaena
had lived in Rifthold, this had been her preferred clothier. Foreign, for the
year she’d spent in Endovier and the months that she’d been in the glass castle
had made everything from that past life into something strange and unknown.

        Lee Kavill, whom Celaena had already
visited twice since becoming the King’s Champion, was standing by the gaggle of
women before the dressing room curtains, his signature plain leather notebook
in his arms and a glass pen in hand.
       </span>

        In his forties, Kavill was a
decent-looking man, his clothes simple and elegant, despite some of the
extravagant offerings in his shop. He was also quiet. Not shy, but calm.
Balanced. He didn’t fuss, and didn’t push, and had an artist’s eye for colors
and cuts and changing trends.

        But those very eyes went a little
wide at the sight of them, darting between the gathered women and his one
o’clock appointment.

        Nehemia stopped just inside the
door, but Celaena went a few steps further into the red-carpeted shop. Kavill
was already before them by the time Celaena smiled and held out her hands.
       </span>

        “We’re a little early,” she said by
way of greeting, “but we’re more than happy to wait.” She inclined her head to
the green-and-gold circular divan in the front of the room—a place usually
reserved for ladies-in-waiting, patient husbands, and bored children.
       </span>

        Kavill took her hands with a smile.
His fingers were just as calloused as hers, though his calluses and scars came
from years with needles and pins, not blades. “Marta said my one o’clock was an
important guest, but I had no idea I’d receive such an honor.” As he finished,
he looked to Nehemia and bowed. “You are most welcome.”
       </span>

        Of course he’d recognize the
princess. While it was fairly easy for Celaena to blend in, there was no hiding
who Nehemia was. Not because of her creamy dark skin, but because Nehemia carried
herself like a princess.
       </span>

        No matter where they went or how
they were dressed, Nehemia always had that angle to her head and a glint in her
eye, as if she’d come out of the womb knowing royal blood flowed in her veins.
As if she always wore an invisible crown. Celaena still wasn’t sure if she
envied or pitied the princess for it.

head—as much respect as Kavill deserved, if not more, given that he’d come from
peasant stock and worked his way up.

        “I can offer you my office to wait,
if you’d prefer,” Kavill said quietly, especially as some of the women by the

ultimately gave him away—gave away what he was trying to shield from them. And

        The girl could have been from
Fenharrow or Eyllwe with her tan skin, but it was the twin gold

        Nehemia just stared at the

the manacles, so horrifyingly beautiful, gleaming in the warm light…

        So Kavill went back to his
customers, the soft-spoken Marta came to take their cloaks and gloves and
replaced them with jasmine tea, delicate cookies, and a selection of the day’s
papers.

        “Such service,” Nehemia said when
Marta had slipped away to assist Kavill in taking down his measurements and
seeing to the needs of their customers. The princess ran an eye around the
gilded walls, the racks of sample gowns, the displays of jewelry, shoes, hats,
and parasols. “Such wealth, too.”
       </span>
      </p>

        Celaena, who had been watching one
of the women debate whether a quarter of an inch would make her neckline too
daring, glanced at the princess. “If it makes you feel better, he’s turned down
positions as the royal tailor several times.”
       </span>

      <p key="2622264d-776b-4d93-97fc-c71c6041953b">

        Nehemia raised a well-groomed brow,
the gold jewelry she wore glinting in the light of the lily-shaped glass
sconces. “I don’t mean to be…difficult,” Nehemia said in the common tongue, any
trace of her fake, thick accent gone.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="52fca7d0-61c2-4b7f-8a40-a0f13b79a0ee">

        The accent, Celaena had learned, was
just to deceive the royal court—to get them to think she was dimwitted, and
make them speak more freely when they thought she couldn’t understand. But
Nehemia spoke better than the most refined of them. And she had been using the
knowledge she’d gleaned to uncover any tidbits of maneuverings that might help
the plight of her enslaved people.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="9272a7d6-913e-4218-9e48-a0a7e1e6efdc">

        It was why they had gone shopping in
the first place: to find gowns that Queen Georgina would approve of—gowns to
enable Nehemia to cozy up to the queen and her inner circle, to see if she
might help Eyllwe by winning over the King of Adarlan’s wife.
       </span>
      </p>

        “Let’s just enjoy ourselves,”
Celaena said, taking a long sip of her jasmine tea, almost groaning at the
sheer perfection of it, then adjusting the folds of her forest-green gown. A
piece that had been made in this very shop—a fact that she was certain Kavill
had already noted.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="79d8f077-ad7a-4247-a7f8-7ccdd0bfd45b">

        The five other customers cast only a
few curious glances their way before they finally left the shop in a flurry of
fur cloaks, kidskin gloves, and moans about the endless winter. The slave girl
never once looked up, and Celaena could have sworn that Nehemia’s hand twitched
when she walked by—as if the princess had contemplated reaching for the girl,
and then thought better of it.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="565724e9-2151-48b4-aec8-d5abcf33f949">

        When they were at last gone, Marta
shut the curtains on the front window, lit a few more sconces, and escorted
them to the silk couches before the dressing room curtains. Kavill himself
bought them another ornate pot of jasmine tea, and then refilled both their
cups.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p key="d5f0e5c9-6490-4395-b4b4-b4b4b87ebc24">

        After Celaena explained that Nehemia
needed at least four dresses, two of them to be ball gowns, and all fit for
Adarlanian royalty, Kavill crossed his arms behind his back and paced as he
inquired after the colors and fabrics that Nehemia preferred or hated, about
her feelings toward low or high necklines, how much mobility she desired, and
on and on until Celaena started wondering if Nehemia would snap.
       </span>
      </p>

        But the princess just smiled at the
slender man, answering him with the thick, hesitant accent she used for
everyone but Celaena. And then she patiently sat through Kavill and Marta’s
presentation of color, cloth, beading, and stitching. It wasn’t until Kavill
and Marta went into the back—to get a sample of the blue ball gown in the
window—that the princess sagged slightly.
       </span>

        “I think I prefer just having the
royal dressmaker bring me something,” she said quietly. “This is truly what
you—you enjoy doing?”

        Celaena winced, but smiled. “When
the mood strikes me, yes.” And now that she had the king’s gold burning a hole
in her purse, she was more than happy to spend most of it. “I’ve always liked
pretty things—dresses, jewelry, shoes… I suppose it’s easy to dismiss it as
frivolous, but a gown like the ones Kavill makes is art. It’s art, and
mathematics, and economics.”

display.

        “That gown in the window—think about
how Kavill had to first come up with the design, then get the measurements just
right to match the image in his head, then find the right vendor to supply the
perfect red velvet and black lace. Think about where that velvet and lace came
from—the velvet from the port in Meah, the lace from Melisande, the thread that
holds the whole thing together from a spinner in Fenharrow. Think about where
the dyes for the red and the black came from, too—think about all the people
and places that had a hand in that dress coming together. It’s like a map of
the continent, and every part of it tells a story, and—” Celaena trailed off
and snorted. “Well, map and story aside, it’s also pretty as hell.”

everyone else, my friend.”

        Kavill and Marta came back out a
moment later, and Marta ushered the princess into the dressing room to try on
the blue ball gown. Getting Nehemia out of her clothes and into the sample gown
would take a few minutes, so Celaena browsed the selection of gowns displayed
in the shop.
       </span>

        A lavender gown trimmed with white
lace caught her eye—and she paused to run a hand over the silk. “Such a
gorgeous color,” she murmured, more to herself than Kavill, but he stepped up
beside her.

in Endovier.

        In the castle, she didn’t need to
pretend to be a courtier anymore, and certainly wasn’t ashamed of any of her
scars, but… they did attract attention. And questions. Sleeves and high backs

assassin—if only to avoid those questions. Or pitying looks.

        She knew Kavill well enough to
understand he wouldn’t ask about the scars, no matter what he might suspect.
She’d always wondered if he’d known who and what she really was—wondered about
her relationship with the red-haired man who’d once accompanied her in here,
keen to dote on his most talented pupil.

life anymore, and the first time she’d come here since being appointed King’s

It was why she’d decided to bring Nehemia to him, fine dresses aside. Kavill
didn’t gossip—or pry.

Celaena thought of the night Nehemia had come into her rooms after learning of
the massacre of five hundred Eyllwe rebels. How the princess had wept for her
people, for their helplessness, for their enslaved world.

        Celaena didn’t think Kavill or Marta
would notice the name the princess had given her—but she glanced at them nonetheless.
They were now just watching, faces bland but pleasant. Willing to get the
jewelery and accessories at a moment’s notice. Nehemia turned to them and said
in her perfectly false accent, “Show me your jewelry.”

        And just like that, they went
through another presentation of necklaces and earrings and bracelets, then
gloves and brooches and hair ornaments. And when they had decided what looked
best, Nehemia was measured and pinned some more, and then ushered into the next
gown. And the next, and the next.

        The clock was striking four by the
time they’d decided on the gowns, jewelry, and accessories Nehemia would
purchase. Marta had long since brought out steaming cups of tea to Nehemia’s
guards outside. She’d come back looking a little pale-faced and shaken, but at
least the teacups had been empty. Nehemia’s guards weren’t a chatty sort—and
were nothing short of lethal.

        Nehemia was shoveling cookies down
her throat as Celaena again strolled through the shop, taking in the dresses.
She’d already ordered the lilac and lace gown, and since Kavill had her most
recent measurements, she hadn’t bothered to try it on, save for holding it
against her torso to make sure she really did love the color and fabric.

        She paused in front of the red
velvet dress in the display, running a finger down the skirts. There were no
petticoats with this sort of dress, no corsets—she’d never seen a dress like
it, actually. Never even heard of a gown like it, with the open back coated in
midnight black lace, the plunging neckline, and form-hugging bodice. It left
little to the imagination—and would surely turn heads.

shoulder. “He’s not my concern.” Though she could almost imagine Chaol’s face
at the sight of the gown: tight-lipped, wide-eyed, a bit confounded and more
than a bit angry. She could almost hear him, too, the claims he’d make about
the King’s Champion spending such exorbitant sums on little more than scraps of
cloth, the reputation she had to uphold now that she was employed by the king…
Oh, she should buy the dress, if only to piss Chaol off.

        Celaena was about to open her mouth,

did a good job of hiding the gruesomeness of her scars, but this close, it was
easy to see the mangled flesh beneath.

the scars beneath the black lace. After a moment, she said, “No.” Celaena

        Celaena was standing at the polished
wooden counter, filling out directions on how and where to deliver Nehemia’s
new clothes, and paying for her own purchases. She decided to take the red
velvet gown, daring and scandalous as it was. If only because not buying it
felt like some sort of defeat, some irreplaceable loss that cut her every time
she thought about it.

from her purse and set it on the counter, behind which Kavill stood, counting.

piece of gold. “Do you have any special occasion in mind?”

who remained by the door, already looking miserable at the oncoming cold.
Celaena herself wasn’t too keen to leave the warmth of the shop. She should
have brought gloves—and a warmer cloak. “I’m sure I’ll find some use for the
dress before summer.”

        Nehemia was quiet for a long moment,
her eyes distant, as if she beheld some far-off land, warm and vibrant, its
grasslands undulating under a hot summer sun. “It is my most selfish wish and daydream—to
be normal, to be ordinary, to be free of my burdens.”
