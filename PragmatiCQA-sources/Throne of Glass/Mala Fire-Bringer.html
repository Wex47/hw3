   After being trapped in Erilea via the broken wyrdgate, Brannon Galathynius, a bastard-born child of Doranelle, earned Mala's gaze. She blessed him with her mighty gifts, offering him her

   of the Fae, the goddess offered him another gift. She bound her entire being into a mortal body, and then offered him the gift of her heart. They loved each other fiercely, and Mala bore Brannon many children, including Elena. She is the reason Aelin bears her gift of Fire and why her well of magic has immense depth.

   Brannon Galathynius stole and rehabilitated Mala's sacred sun stags from her temple near the Cambrian Mountains to his founded kingdom of Terrasen.

   , the Gods and Goddesses made a deal with Mala and Brannon. They would be sent home through the broken wyrdgate, and then the three wyrdkeys would be sealed shut in the gate - forever rendering the gate unable to open for armies and to destroy worlds. The returning offer that stood between them was that they would take the Dark King Erawan, including his armies, and tear him apart in their homeworld. The cost of the Lock, though, was enormous. Mala was required to give up her mortal body and her life with her mate and children.
  </p>
  <p key="6d90e061-cad7-4506-b4b1-bba1d163c929">
   Rhiannon Crochan
   created the basis of the Lock: the symbol of the Three-Faced Goddess in an amulet - a warped metal with two overlapping circles, with a rendering of the goddess' "Heart of the Darkness" in the middle. Rhiannon crafted a witch mirror in the middle eye, which was capable of absorbing immense power. The amulet then had been called the Eye of the Goddess.
  </p>
  <p key="fa1b448f-17e7-4f2b-898a-872ee87f534d">
   With the help of Rhiannon Crochan, Mala cast her entire mortal being, her full Fire-Bringer gifts, and her whole essence into a small blue witch-mirror in the Eye of the Goddess. Though she had given up her life to forge the Lock, she was still able to live on as a goddess.

  <p key="77a04e00-2e79-4061-ab43-9afc2c66dc50">
   Approximately ten years after Mala gave up her life for the Lock, Erawan's armies had nearly gotten full control of the continent. Brannon's gift was dimming as he was close to the Passing of the Fae into the Afterworld.
  </p>
  <p key="4a986140-312c-4aa1-a027-ce4e7be76369">
   In a desperate attempt to seal Erawan and stop the spread of his darkness and pain across the world, Elena Galathynius stole the Lock from her father and used it to seal Erawan in a tomb in Morath. She did not know the Lock's purpose or that her father bore the wyrdkeys. Upon ruining the bargain between the Gods and Brannon, the Gods showed their rage; however, Mala Fire-Bringer paused in her wrath as if trying to remember Elena.
  </p>
  <p key="92523bec-8f14-4eee-9a78-c272416f5a17">
   The Gods and Goddesses proposed that a new Lock would need to be forged by a scion of Mala blessed with her same Fire-Bringer gifts, who would have to give up their life to seal the wyrdkeys into the wyrdgate. They informed her that their original bargain still held: they would destroy Erawan in their homeworld. And so Elena was tasked to lead Aelin to find the wyrdkeys, forge the Lock and give up her life to seal the gate shut.

  <p key="35d9eec2-fbc2-4c7f-a7d9-9a10fee462c6">
   As time passed to Aelin's childhood, the King of Adarlan became possessed by a Valg Prince after unlocking Erawan's tomb with a wyrdkey he found in Elena's tomb - alongside Duke Perrington, who became possessed by Erawan himself. While trying to keep the demon at bay, he learned that Aelin's fire could cleanse his possession and free him from its control. When the demon learned what Aelin was capable of after displaying her power at Orynth, it decided to wipe the Galathynius line. As such, the royal family of Terrasen was slaughtered, with Aelin barely escaping her attacker, thanks to Marion Lochan. As Aelin tried to flee, she almost drowned in the River Florine. The third wyrdkey (Amulet of Orynth) managed to save from that threat, and the Gods and Goddesses decided that this moment would be perfect for Aelin to complete their bargain. And so they combined their powers and reformed Elena Galathynius in a body to aid Aelin. She was unaware that the real danger to Aelin would be the freezing cold conditions, which caused Aelin to die. Elena then became fire and warmed Aelin's body, bringing her back to life. She also convinced Arobynn to take Aelin away unconsciously. As a result of disobeying the Gods and Goddesses and defying them, they promised her that she would not be able to access the afterlife, and she would merely disappear after Aelin completed her task, never seeing

   When Aelin and Dorian re-forged the Lock, Mala was there. Aelin was about to be burnt out and die forging it, but Mala gave her another piece of her power, giving her possibly even more power than before. However, Aelin had to use up almost all of this power also. Aelin forced all of the Gods, including Mala, into the Valg world, where they presumably died.
