   Yrene Towers
   has been training and healing with her magic at the Torre Cesme for two years.
   Hafiza
   calls for her. She’s heard Yrene is leaving them soon to head home to help heal the injured on the battlefield in the war they all know is coming.
   Adarlanian
   soldiers had killed her
   mother

   Hafiza wishes she would stay and continue her training. She passed her final test with the highest marks ever, so Yrene knows she’s prepared. Hafiza asks one last thing of Yrene: to heal a special guest of the khagan. It will be a long healing process that will delay her departure. Hafiza thinks healing an enemy will heal the old wound in Yrene. Yrene agrees to assess him.

   Yrene is late for her evaluation of Chaol. She’s ruder than she’s ever been to a patient because he served the king who had her mother killed. She’ll send word when she’s decided whether she can and will heal him.

  <p key="e38b146e-2e45-42c3-9aa9-971d5812a7f7">
   Yrene is embarrassed and speaks with Hafiza about her assessment. Her mentor says to do better next time. Chaol is different than she expected an Adarlanian soldier to be. The dark magic tangled in his spine will make healing tricky.

   Yrene arrives at the royal dinner and intentionally doesn’t look at Chaol or Kashin. Kashin talks to Chaol about Yrene. Chaol hears his ‘territory claimed’ tone. Chaol is worried and furious when Nesryn gets home late from her visit with her family late into the night.

   Yrene studies ancient books in a desolate part of the library and finds one about the
   Valg
   . She feels like she’s being watched. When she’s almost back to the main area, she finds someone murdered. The girl looks much like Yrene. She can hear someone behind her but gets away.
  </p>

   Yrene is late the next morning, so Chaol begins working through some exercises on his own. She looks terrible when she arrives and sends
   Kadja
   on a false errand immediately. She tells Chaol what happened. It sounds like a Valg demon murdered the girl. He apologizes for bringing the demon to Antica as surely it followed them here. But one might have murdered Tumelun, too, which would mean they were already here. He wants Yrene to be very careful. Yrene asks him to help teach a self-defense class to the young healers. Yrene has a special contraption that will allow him to ride a horse to the Torre.
  </p>
  <p key="37571560-6303-4b5c-b4fb-516b2f0cdf6e">
   Yrene thinks she needs to push the magic down and repair the injury for Chaol to be healed. It’s torture, but he’s willing to endure it to be healed. They need to discuss the darkness in his psyche that is feeding the magic for healing, too. He says it’s none of her business.

   Nesryn is in the aerie early one morning. Sartaq offers to let her ride
   Kadara

   Both Yrene and Chaol are exhausted after their first magical healing session. She didn’t have much luck in her first go but saw visions from Chaol’s past and heard words like ‘
   Morath

   Nesryn goes into the city to investigate how the Valg demon got into the Torre and runs into Sartaq. They search the city together for them but find nothing.

   Yrene oversleeps the next morning due to her exhaustion from her session with Chaol. Chaol didn’t wait for her and is mounting his horse with the help of a few guards and the brace. They ride to the Torre. Chaol loves being on a horse again and seeing the city.
  </p>
  <p key="a56fd8c7-a085-4552-80fb-7becff7a21f2">
   A crowd of girls have gathered in front of the Torre for their lesson. They are excited to see Chaol. Yrene tells the girls about Chaol’s injury and his brace. She asks girls to volunteer to help him dismount and into his chair. He helps Yrene teach the self-defense class.
  </p>
  <p key="f7643adc-6efc-43d6-bbbd-a1b5c0e5038d">
   Kashin greets them in the palace courtyard. He tells Yrene he has put guards in place at the Torre to try to keep them safe. She thanks him but cuts the conversation off before he is ready. Back in his room, Yrene finally drags out of Chaol why he’s angry: the fact that she put him on display. She’s sorry.
  </p>
  <p key="ebbffad1-aed0-43d2-8a28-91fd64c4fbf5">
   Yrene attacks the black magic on his back again. Chaol sees painful memories about how his

   treated him. Yrene ends up with a bloody nose from the strain of the session. She saw Morath and its armies. Chaol orders her to rest before she leaves. Chaol’s toes begin to move.

   Nesryn visits her aunt and uncle, which is both wonderful (to be around family) and hard (to miss and worry about her father and siblings). She tells them of the attack at the Torre and how she fears it’s because of her and Chaol’s presence in Antica. She’s afraid they might target her family to try to get to her. Her aunt and uncle say they will take precautions but aren’t too concerned.

   Hasar
   calls Yrene to her, and they discuss Chaol, Kashin, and the war on the northern continent. Hasar asks Yrene to try to get information about Aelin from Chaol. Hasar thinks maybe the Torre attack was orchestrated by Chaol and Nesryn to get her family to relent and join their war. Yrene silently disagrees. Hasar threatens to never let Yrene leave Antica if she doesn’t play the spy for her. Yrene reluctantly agrees.
  </p>
  <p key="cbbd151e-0836-4b77-959b-333566e63c6f">
   Yrene doesn’t show up on time the next morning, so Chaol mounts a horse (with a little help) and heads toward the Torre. Hafiza sees him in the Torre courtyard. Yrene is still in bed, exhausted from yesterday’s session. Hafiza tells him it is a natural process for a healer.
  </p>
  <p key="ff2f90e7-e32e-49a2-8fa4-ada676e065c6">
   Chaol is already in the courtyard—on his horse and with one for her—when Yrene finally rises the following morning. She puts him through a few exercises right there in the courtyard while he’s on the horse. She needs to check on a couple patients before they begin Chaol’s full session at the palace. He goes with her. They decide not to do a session today, so Yrene gives him a tour of the city by horseback.
  </p>
  <p key="1173bd76-9849-4923-9712-de9e6f287ce4">
   That night, Chaol and Nesryn go to a royal party together. Hasar tells Nesryn to move to make room for Yrene. No one’s sure what to do. Finally, Sartaq asks Nesryn to come join him. Chaol assumes whatever Yrene was keeping from him earlier goes hand in hand with this display by Hasar. Chaol and Yrene keep their conversations professional because they know everyone is listening.
  </p>
  <p key="e7fb7c92-52e1-4551-9074-1dc73c76f8d9">
   After dinner, the party really begins with music, dancers, and incense laced with opiates. Chaol sees Nesryn walk to a place to view the festivities without being hindered by the smoke with Sartaq. He sees Kashin lean over to invite Yrene with him, so Chaol beats him to it with an invitation of his own.
  </p>
  <p key="7520d258-3384-470c-92ff-c263dd6dd4c9">
   They move to a couch and speak to each other in code. The opiates begin to affect them. Yrene tells Chaol she needs some small thing to take to Hasar, like a possible place to search for Aelin. Chaol has to act like he’s entranced and willing to give her intel. It’s hard for them to tell what’s real and what isn’t between them. Chaol comes back to his senses. He gives the location of
   Skull's Bay
   for Yrene to take back to Hasar because he doesn’t think Aelin would ever return there.
  </p>
  <p key="9b303d14-a0c5-4656-a22d-184c845266b2">
   Nesryn tells Chaol she’s tempted to go with Sartaq when he flies to his people to see if they have any information on the Valg. Chaol asks Nesryn to tell him all about her time with her family. She knows what passed between him and Yrene at the party was real but stays and talks to him until they’re both asleep.

   Yrene finds Chaol and Nesryn asleep in his bed the next morning. She rushes out. Chaol rushes to her. He explains nothing happened. Yrene is embarrassed that she feels relieved. Chaol’s attention snags on a new scroll she’s brought because
   Wyrdmarks
   are on it. He tells her to hide all of it immediately. She puts the scrolls in a spare pair of his boots. She tells him of something new she read in the library. There are two other kings besides

   Yrene asks about Chaol’s scars. He won’t share about the one Aelin gave him, but he tells her about the one from his father. When they begin his session, Yrene taps into a related memory, when Chaol’s dad threw him out of their house. Yrene’s mind travels to a memory of her mother. At the end of the session, Chaol can feel and move his whole foot. She tells Chaol of her journeys after her mother died.
  </p>

   Sartaq finds Nesryn with Kadara. He asks her to accompany him when he goes to visit his people. He’ll be gone a few weeks. She decides to go with him without even asking Chaol or telling him goodbye. She sends a note to him instead.

   Yrene and Chaol do further research in the Torre library. He eats dinner at the Torre afterward and stays the night in a room there. Yrene has a meeting with Hafiza the next morning, so Chaol travels back to the palace with

   Yrene is confused when Chaol’s in a bad mood during their next session. She tries to get the reason out of him. She learns from Hasar that Nesryn left with Sartaq. That evening Yrene goes back to see Chaol. She feels something following her. They barricade Chaol’s door. The creature pounds on it. It whispers Yrene’s name. They hear palace guards in the hallway. Prince Kashin arrives because Yrene sent for him. He orders more guards to be stationed throughout the palace. She stays because she feels safer with Chaol. She sleeps in his bed. He’s in his chair, keeping watch.

   Borte challenges Nesryn to see how good her archery is. She hits her target again and again and impresses Borte. Borte is training to be the next hearth-mother and must learn many things besides fighting, so she asks Nesryn to teach her archery.

   Nesryn always believed the spiders were myths. Falkan has proof they’re real: a piece of cloth made from their unusual silk. He bartered 20 years of his life for pieces of spidersilk, but now he wants them back. Houlun wants Sartaq to help search for the spiders.

   Houlun dismisses Falkan and asks Nesryn whether the darkness is starting again. She asks if the khagan knows. Sartaq says he’s too wrapped up in his grief. He wants to know what else Houlun knows. She wants to rest first. She tells them to prepare for a storm because she barely beat one home.

   Chaol and Yrene head back to the Torre library to determine how those books and scrolls ended up there. Nousha, the head librarian, doesn’t know.

   Nesryn and Sartaq fly to the watchtower to look for the spiders (kharankui). They enter the tower and quickly discover it’s booby-trapped. They maneuver through the traps safely and make it to the dungeon. A kharankui bigger than a horse descends on them. A giant grey wolf rescues them. Kadara attacks and kills the spider when the wolf lures it outside. Falkan is the wolf; he’s a shapeshifter.

He will use the four trunks of priceless treasure as payment. He wants to show how lucrative the war could be if Aelin continues to buy weapons from Antica. The khagan asks the guards to escort Chaol back to his rooms.
  </p>
  <p key="ab626cc5-5959-4a73-91f5-0a8e8b7b1d30">
   Chaol’s still in a foul mood from the meeting when Yrene arrives. He initiates a fight with her just because he’s spoiling for one. The whole time Yrene is beckoning him to take a step. He takes one, then another and another until he pushes her against the wall and kisses her.
  </p>
  <p key="046917df-102b-4221-85f8-57a210b1aa07">
   They kiss again on the castle grounds the next day after one of Chaol’s training sessions and are caught by a servant. Yrene keeps her distance after that because acting unprofessional like this could jeopardize her job.
  </p>
  <p key="ea6d0a5a-fcfb-408e-9709-99b5d316799d">
   Yrene tells Chaol she’s convinced Hasar to take them on an overnight excursion to Aksara to celebrate Yrene’s birthday.

   Sartaq and Houlun study the Dagul Fells maps for a week before they decide to go. They make Borte stay behind. Nesryn asks Sartaq why he’s never married as they fly. Nesryn mentions how much harder it will be to ask the rukhin fighters to join Aelin now that she knows the riders and their families.
  </p>
  <p key="0ba04c57-56b6-435f-a9b5-6a4fed824285">
   Dagul Fells is covered in webs. They fly high over the area to investigate. They see a ruk hatchling. They end up tangled in a web as Kadara flies in to rescue it. It was a trap. Sartaq takes the brunt of the impact for Nesryn. They scramble toward the web Kadara is tangled in. The hatchling is injured. Sartaq begs Kadara to fly away. Spiders descend. Nesryn shoots the one closest to them. Kadara flies away. Nesryn and Sartaq run further into the mountain pass.

   The group from the palace leaves for Aksara. The royals ride ahead. Chaol and Yrene race on their horses.
  </p>
  <p key="70218e7a-2279-47ed-8ec9-863ee2826ab8">
   Yrene and Chaol act embarrassed to join the scantily clad royals in the bathing pools to give themselves a chance to roam the grounds and search for the lost city. They finally come across old pillars leading below, displaying men, animals,
   Fae
   , and the Valg. It’s a Fae burial site. Chaol never thought Fae settled anywhere besides their own kingdom and
   Terrasen
   . He wonders if they bred down here on the southern continent to produce healers gifted in magic. If they can find someone to interpret the scrolls they have, would they possibly describe something the healers could do to help defeat the Valg? They decide to ask Hafiza.
  </p>
  <p key="097f8e9c-6da8-4873-a1ec-9f83089add7e">
   They return and get dressed up for the evening party. Hasar tries to provoke everyone. She says maybe they would join the war if Aelin would come down here and marry one of her brothers, maybe Kashin. Chaol explains that Aelin will soon marry
   <a href="Rowan Whitethorn.html" key="6439e269-36ec-4e88-8d88-b226c773134c" title="Rowan Whitethorn">
    Rowan Whitethorn
   </a>
   , a Fae prince they’ve all heard of. When they’ve all imbibed way too much, Hasar makes a comment about Chaol’s chair. Yrene flips Hasar’s chair, and she falls into the pool behind her. Yrene’s afraid she’s dead. Everyone is quiet for a long time. Then
   Renia
   and Kashin begin laughing. Hasar just says she wondered when Yrene would grow a backbone.
  </p>
  <p key="5929f6ee-2354-4180-858f-d05a7d7fe883">
   Yrene asks about Aelin and if the things Chaol said about her at the party were true. She feels him out to see if he still has feelings for Aelin or Nesryn. He assures her he doesn’t. She says she’s glad. He presents her with a locket as her birthday gift. He wants her to be able to keep whatever she’s been fingering in her pocket inside the locket. They are intimate. Yrene tells Chaol of the note that now lies in her locket. It’s from the woman who taught her how to fight and left money for her to travel to Antica.

   Nesryn, Sartaq, and Falkan climb the mountain pass, trying to find the way out of the trap the spiders laid for them. A slide happens. Sartaq gets stuck. Nesryn can’t pull him free. He tells her he loved her before he even met her from the stories he’d heard. She and Falkan leave with a plan. It lands Nesryn and an unconscious Sartaq in the spider’s lair covered in spidersilk. Falkan is behind Nesryn slowly chewing away her trap. A kharankui comes in. The spider says she’s waiting for the Queen of the Valg to arrive.
   Maeve
   .
  </p>
  <p key="08a4e28a-81fc-4442-bb8f-54deae7f145c">
   Nesryn asks to hear the story. The spider tells of three powerful dark kings who conquered their world a lifetime ago. They all three fell in love with a dark queen. She married Orcus, the oldest and most powerful. Maeve was curious about what else is out there and found a way into Nesryn’s world. The spiders came with her and stayed in this spot to guard the gate between the two worlds. Orcus found a way to control these gates. He made three keys, one for each king. They went from gate to gate, conquering realm after realm as they searched for her.
  </p>
  <p key="6e445327-b71c-40da-b1bc-b53d21de3b1e">
   Meanwhile, Maeve had found the Fae land, ruled by two queens. She got into their minds and convinced them they had an older sister. She got into the minds of everyone in the realm and convinced them there had always been three. When the dark kings arrived, they did not recognize her in her Fae body. She defeated them and took their keys. She sent the first two back to their world. Before she could send Erawan back,
   <a href="Brannon Galathynius.html" key="30a4a21d-7847-4a0f-974c-bfd2721dba93" title="Brannon Galathynius">
    Brannon Galathynius
   </a>
   arrived and took the keys from her. He wasn’t sure what she was but could sense the darkness in her. Maeve greatly feared Brannon’s fire, as all Valg do. He left. Maeve built her kingdom with many powerful defenses in case Erawan rose again.
  </p>
  <p key="bb96dc40-911e-4a72-ab35-9824887ac8a8">
   Another spider comes in to warn that twenty ruks are approaching. While the spiders are gone, Falkan chews both of them free. They grab their weapons and flee. Sartaq was awake and heard it all. He’s unsteady on his feet from blood loss. Since the spiders hate fire, they shoot fiery arrows at them. Falkan shifts into a spider like them to stay behind and fight. He asks Nesryn to search for his niece, possibly a shapeshifter, who he’s been looking for. He leaves his fortune to this niece.
  </p>
  <p key="3f06b6fa-39be-4d54-ad55-38c310bf1d45">
   The spiders descend on the three of them. They begin to fight. A ruk sweeps in to help. Its rider is Borte. Yeran’s there, too. Ruks pick up Nesryn and Sartaq and fly away. Dagul Fells burns behind them.
  </p>
  <p key="827f1ce4-e3c3-4d9f-8fa7-8627da4e0b5f">
   Chaol and Yrene leave Aksara ahead of everyone else. He arrives at the palace to find his room trashed. The only thing they didn’t find were the scrolls they had stuck in Chaol’s boots.
  </p>
  <p key="e635791e-3f7b-493c-ba60-8fd97edadece">
   Chaol asks Yrene to go to the Torre where it’s safe. That’s part of his purpose, but he also knows Nesryn is due back soon. He needs to properly end things with her. Yrene discusses the scrolls with Hafiza. She tells her how they think healers might be involved and how the Fae started their civilization here long ago. Hafiza has a locked trunk full of Wyrdmark books. Her predecessor told her they weren’t for human eyes, but she didn’t know what they were. Yrene wants to take them with her to the person Chaol knows who can read Wyrdmarks.
  </p>
  <p key="65bed99d-3fd9-4b60-bc9f-bd83720dc02b">
   Yrene says she’s ending this today. She’s going in and conquering the darkness in Chaol’s spine. It’s hard, but it works. He ends up fully healed. Chaol and Yrene express their love for each other.
  </p>
  <p key="65bcdcdf-b02e-4809-9498-79c37fce8d1a">
   Sartaq and Nesryn sleep away their first day back. They gather with the clan so Sartaq can fill them in. Nesryn then tells them the full history of Erawan and Maeve. Nesryn tells Falkan she might know his niece and asks if he will come north with them if the clans decide to join the fight. He agrees. A messenger rushes in with a note from Chaol. He requests their presence back in Antica immediately.
  </p>
  <p key="e56e3216-dac4-4d88-bee6-b94705a92d8d">
   Chaol tells Yrene his full story, starting with when he first met Celaena until now. He tells her how Aelin’s fire burned the Valg demons out of Dorian and his father. This makes Yrene think that the Valg are parasites. She thinks her healer gifts could treat those infected by the Valg with much greater success in saving the host. Powerful people like Aelin and Dorian would have to hold them down while Yrene works. This is probably why Erawan’s minion is hunting her: because they know what her powers can do.
  </p>
  <p key="43ad4777-0e68-420f-991c-f9294c963ca8">
   Hasar tells them that Aelin’s group defeated Maeve’s fleet. Aelin called in debts to many people: the
   Silent Assassins
   of the
   Red Desert
   ,
   Wendlyn
   , and of course Antica. She promises Hasar a better world if they join her.

  <p key="ff91c5e5-2d7e-457b-a64f-0ee764ef244b">
   When they make it to the Torre to look at the ancient texts, Hafiza is nowhere to be seen. They find her iron key wedged under her door. They search the Torre and end up in the lost tunnels beneath the library. They find her bound and gagged by
   Duva
   , the khagan’s youngest living daughter. She’s possessed by a Valg demon. She killed her younger sister when she got suspicious. She says Maeve has been hoarding healers. Erawan wants Yrene for his own. Duva threatens to hurt Hafiza if Yrene doesn’t come with her.
  </p>
  <p key="ac98893d-7e21-4aa0-96a2-5b4110161361">
   Hafiza knocks her chair into Duva. A fight ensues. Yrene stays behind to try to heal Hafiza. Duva begins to fight Chaol. He eventually uses a mirror to rebound a blast of darkness onto Duva. It knocks her out. Yrene and Chaol worry about the baby in her womb. She was faking and blasts power at Yrene. Chaol pushes her out of the way and takes the blast directly in the back. Chaol’s feeling begins to vanish once again. Yrene throws Chaol’s sword at Duva and runs. Duva chases her, trying to get a Valg ring on Yrene’s finger. Yrene gets Chaol’s dagger and is about to kill her. Chaol begs her not to. Nesryn and Sartaq arrive. Hafiza breathes sleep over Duva.
  </p>
  <p key="8d2f8f36-3229-4f1b-9325-2feca0974287">
   Yrene can feel death imminent on Chaol and tries to heal him. There’s too much damage to repair. She feels her ancestors moving in to help. The Torre healers line up behind her, each with their hands on the shoulders of the one in front of her. This eventually heals Chaol, even the old scar on his cheek. Yrene pays the price to bring him back. She bound his life to hers. His legs will only function properly when Yrene’s power is at its fullest, acting as a brace. When her power isn’t full, he will have to use a cane or even a chair.
  </p>
  <p key="e57e38a1-6a17-41ed-80a7-b67d443a3c42">
   Chaol sees the new bond between Nesryn and Sartaq. They have a silent exchange and a quiet understanding of their new relationships.
  </p>
  <p key="2d6cace5-1c1b-4e19-886b-ff9fdfab732c">
   They take Duva to the khagan, show him the ring, and tell him how Erawan lives in Perrington and has enslaved her to him with this ring. Arghun tries to argue. Hafiza shuts him up by asserting this is the truth. Kashin begs Yrene to fix Duva. She says she’ll try. Chaol talks to the khagan about what his country has to offer in the war against Erawan.
  </p>
  <p key="ff5c4b3f-105e-4878-b659-72e0027163f6">
   The demon in Duva is even worse than what was in Chaol. Hafiza tries to keep her under a sleeping spell while Yrene works. She goes into Duva’s consciousness and fights the demon with light. It’s hard work. Duva begins vomiting until the demon finally pours out in black smoke. The khagan says he will give Yrene anything for saving his daughter. She has one request.
  </p>
  <p key="0dc23a0f-5514-4623-94bc-123f0e82a3cb">
   Chaol and Yrene meet with Nesryn and Sartaq to catch up on all they’ve learned in their time apart. They will join Aelin and help her mount her defense. Hasar will join them, too.
  </p>
  <p key="06bfbc81-ddfa-49a8-ab08-3edcd8de34b5">
   Nesryn finds a two-week-old note from her uncle and rushes to his house. Her father and sister are there. Sartaq shows up a couple hours later, landing Kadara right by the ruk Nesryn rode. Sartaq meets her family and then takes Nesryn on a walk. He told his father he’s following the woman he loves into battle. His father appointed him Heir.
  </p>
  <p key="463d58b1-90d5-41b7-bebf-3e28c361eafe">
   Chaol and Yrene set off northward on a boat. They were married before they left Antica. Yrene declares she’s found her courage and doesn’t need the note anymore. She takes it out of her locket. Chaol cannot believe he recognizes the author’s handwriting. He can’t believe Aelin saved his wife’s life so long ago. He tells Yrene to keep it a little while longer. There’s someone he knows who would like to see it.
