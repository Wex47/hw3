   Millennia ago, when the Valg broke into the world, witches did not exist. It was the Valg, and the Fae, and humans. But the Valg wanted the world for their own, and they thought a good way to get it would be to ensure that their offspring could survive there. The humans weren’t resilient enough to breed with, but the Fae were stronger, and the Valg began kidnapping them to breed with. Their offspring became the first witches.

   . It is unclear whether the Ironteeth were excluded from this arrangement, but five hundred years later the three Ironteeth Clans united to overthrow
   House Crochan
   and take over the
   Witch Kingdom
   . Their victory was short-lived however, as the land was cursed by
   Rhiannon Crochan
   prior to her death, and became unusable for the Clans to live in. The Matrons then forced the Clans into exile, and for the next 500 years the Ironteeth would hunt the Crochans across the continent, looking for the one that could break the curse.

   Over time the Ironteeth lost faith in their alliance with Morath, even more so after the breeding programs started and the Blackbeak heir,
   Manon Blackbeak
   , defected from her clan. They eventually split into different factions; those who remained on Morath's side, and those who defected to join Manon when she united the Crochans and Ironteeth against the Valg. The Ironteeth who fought with

   Ironteeth witches greatly resemble human women in shape (as they are all female), and many are beautiful. However, they are immortal and predatory in every other sense. Ironteeth blood is blue, like all witches, and they have a retractable set of iron teeth and nails. As the Ironteeth were known to fly on enchanted ironwood brooms, they also have a retractable clear eyelid to protect their vision from the wind as they fly. This eyelid slightly blurs their vision. Ironteeth are immortal and stop aging when they reach maturity. Their senses are also stronger than that of humans, and they have increased speed and strength.

   Some Ironteeth witches can see the future the way an oracle can, and it is rumored that for the Ancients, the past, the present, and the future bleed together. The Blueblood Clan claim they have the power but

The cost is that she is incinerated in the blast, her body yielded to the Darkness. As the Ironteeth witch yields life to the Darkness, its power fills her and unleashes from her in an ebony wave, a manifestation of what lies in their souls.

   The Ironteeth society is ruthless and rigid; their culture is based around raising their witchlings to be heartless, loyal, and bloodthirsty warriors. Centuries ago, only some witches became warriors, called sentinels. However, since the witch wars, every witch born has been trained in violence. Their culture is hierarchical; each clan is ruled by a High Witch called the Matron and the Matron’s appointed heir; every witch of the clan belongs to a Coven, there is no such thing as a lone witch. Within each coven, there is a hierarchy, first a leader, and then the leader’s Second and Third. It is the duty of the Second and Third to defend their leader against all threats, even if it means sacrificing themselves. While the bonds between the witches of each coven are stressed upon, the leaders of the covens are raised to see their subordinates as expendable, and if they ever become insubordinate, they are to be dismissed.

   Among the Ironteeth witches, witchlings are rare and sacred; from conception to the age of sixteen, they are protected. For a witch to harm a pregnant witch, their unborn witchling, or their daughter is the greatest crime imaginable, and they are punished with enormous suffering in a long, long execution. There is no greater pride than to bear a witchling for the Clan; and no greater shame than to lose one.

   To the Ironteeth, humans are seen as only good for two things; rutting and bleeding, for Ironteeth witches drink the blood of mortals like mortals drink wine. While witchlings are prized by the Ironteeth, relationships with mortal men are seen as a weakness. However, affairs with human men are very common and encouraged. Bearing a witchling is not only honorable but extremely difficult, and they need all the chances they can to conceive. Witches will use the man for pleasure and then murder him and dine on his blood. Witches also have intimate relationships with each other, for example,

   Ironteeth, like the Crochans, worship the Three-Faced Goddess or the Three-Faced Mother, each representing an aspect of woman; mother, maiden, and crone. They call the
   Eye of Elena
   the Eye of the Goddess; the outer circle representing the crone, the interior circle representing mother, the bottom circle represents the maiden, and the eye inside is the “Heart of Darkness within her.” Because of this the Matron or high witch of each clan is seen as each aspect, the Blueblood Matron a young beautiful maiden, the Blackbeak Matron a woman in her prime and the Yellowlegs Matron an aging crone.

  <p key="234be88a-6625-4371-955a-35bac83c49a0">

  <p key="b8d1d025-eb46-445d-8bd3-74a9ab6a1cf6">
   Ironteeth legend has it that all witches were gifted by the Three-Faced Goddess with iron teeth and nails to keep them anchored to this world when magic threatened to pull them away. The barbed iron crown the Blueblood Matron wears is supposedly proof that the magic in the Blueblood line ran so strong that their leader needed more iron and pain to keep her tethered in this realm.
