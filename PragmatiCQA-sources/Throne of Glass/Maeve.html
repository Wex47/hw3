   </h2>
   <p key="0a4918b0-2d4c-45c3-bf47-1bc8a988a89f">
    Tens of millenia ago, the realm where the Valg originated from was plagued by wars and suffering. Then came the mighty war, waged by the three Valg Kings—
    Orcus
    ,
    Mantyx
    and
    <a href="Erawan.html" key="17ec6cff-3dc2-409f-962e-148738b4e5c4" title="Erawan">
     Erawan
    </a>
    —against whatever forces hindered true ownership of their land. As the three Kings became victorious, they turned their realm into one of eternal darkness, cold, ice and wind. A paradise for the Valg demons.
   </p>
   <p key="d245e28c-7e7b-4615-ad95-62288cc0e1d7">
    The Valg Kings ruled equally in power for the next thousand years. They bred their royalty through various lines, creating Valg Princes and Princesses to ensure their land remained conquered in their ownership. They ruled in peace until Maeve, a Valg Queen with tremendous dark power, who bore many gifts, appeared before the three Kings. They each desired the Queen for her beauty, cruelty, and power, but Maeve would only ally with one of them, despite their pursuing and wooing.
   </p>
   <p key="84d7eca9-c95e-4f08-ab75-5f4956ccc80a">
    Queen Maeve married King Orcus, the oldest and strongest Valg King.
    But it was not enough for her, she was not content. She was restless to leave, to witness and conquer foreign realms, and to rule unchallenged. So she used her gifts to look through the world, at tears between it, separating realms;
    <a href="Wyrdgates.html" key="61679a77-afad-4380-a89e-2c56abc7e431" title="Wyrdgates">
     Wyrdgates
    </a>
    . By piercing the veil, the Wyrdgate separating the Valg realm and another realm, she saw
    <a href="Erilea.html" key="0d3fa0a7-c65d-4168-871b-2670ecf37f28" title="Erilea">
     Erilea
    </a>
    , a world full of light, green and singing. So Maeve waited in the Valg Realm for an opportunity to leave.
   </p>
   <p key="74d93d7d-b72a-4757-bd0f-cd171bb99049">
    Queen Maeve had learned that Wyrdgates naturally open and close, at random times. So when Orcus left to see his brothers, a Wyrdgate opened in the Valg realm. Maeve left immediately and arrived in Erilea—in the Dagul Fells mountains of the
    southern continent
    . She brought the
    <i key="d80af4f7-f9d2-4322-adb7-b5e713cb8bd0">
     kharankui
    </i>
    with her—her beloved handmaidens, the
    Stygian Spiders
    . After their arrival, the Wyrdgate rapidly closed. Maeve ordered the Stygian spiders to guard the mountains surrounding the vanished Wyrdgate, in case the rip between worlds ever appeared, because the Kings would arrive, and they would look for their Queen, and Maeve did not wish to go back.
   </p>
   <p key="3fa6a49a-aca4-499b-861f-9d5503edc369">
    Maeve left for the western continent,
    Wendlyn
    . There, she found the
    Fae
    , the oldest inhabitants of Erilea. And then Maeve saw that all the faeries, the Fae included, were ruled by two Fae Sister-Queens: the fair-haired
    <a href="Mab.html" key="2f001bdc-1cc6-459b-9b92-8f176452f952" title="Mab">
     Mab
    </a>
    , the youngest, who bore the shape of a white swan, and cunning
    <a href="Mora.html" key="a43754f4-3cd6-45a8-95fc-6c2c4c20d31c" title="Mora">
     Mora
    </a>
    , who bore the shape of a great hawk.
   </p>
   <p key="1c846e45-5be8-46d6-a916-8e4920e57cd0">
    So Maeve bound her essence into a Fae body, and hid her darkness, her true Valg form, beneath her skin. She used her gifts to rip into the minds of the two Queens, and made them believe they had an older sister. She took the name of Queen Maeve of the Fae, and when the "three" sisters returned to their palace, she altered the minds of every creature she encountered, until all beings in the realm of Erilea knew that Wendlyn and
    Doranelle
    were, and always had been ruled by, the legendary three Fae Sister-Queens. Those that resisted her power, she found ways to end them.
   </p>
   But the Valg King Orcus discovered how Maeve had left through the Wyrdgate, and used his knowledge and power to extract three slivers of the realm doorway—three
   Wyrdkeys
   , to control the opening and closing of the Wyrdgate at will. Each Valg King bore one key, and they opened the Wyrdgate, going through fruitless searches in countless realms for their Valg Queen. After ravaging those realms, they finally reached Erilea—alongside their countless armies of horrors and the Valg. Continuing their search, they only found the Fae of the continent, in Wendlyn, ruled by the three Fae Sister-Queens, to stand against the three Valg Kings. The Valg armies fought against the extensive armies Maeve and her "sisters" had collected. But the Valg Kings did not recognize Maeve—for she was disguised in a Fae body. She used her knowledge of the Valg armies, how they worked and defeated their armies.
   <p key="b306eea8-faeb-423a-ac50-6535985a84b4">
    But then Maeve learned of the Wyrdkeys, and planned to steal them from the Valg Kings, and then kill or banish them to their original realm, using the keys then as she saw fit. Accompanied by a small band of Fae, Maeve infiltrated the Valg war-camps, using her knowledge of their armies, and stole the keys. She made it seem as though the knowledge was passed by from the Spirit World which she could commune to, a lie she made those who questioned her believe. Upon stealing each Wyrdkey from the Kings, she banished Orcus and Mantyx. It was at this moment that
    <a href="Brannon Galathynius.html" key="28f47dfc-f073-4c74-935a-8ffdcfdcd4e6" title="Brannon Galathynius">
     Brannon Galathynius
    </a>
    suspected that Maeve was not who she is —that perhaps, she was Valg — upon discovering that she feared
    Mala Fire-Bringer
    's flame, which he wielded. So Brannon stole the Wyrdkeys from her, and Maeve was unable to banish Erawan.
   </p>
   <p key="f26b0bea-5aa6-4882-9067-224d6c0bcd0f">
    In her
    Fae
    form, Maeve had never mated before. It is unknown whether she actually desired
    Athril
    , or simply wanted his protection from
    Silba
    and the ring she forged; the golden ring of Silba which would provide the bearer immunity from the Valg, their possession, and their power. Brannon took the unforged
    Amulet of Orynth
    from
    Mala Fire-Bringer
    's temple in the Fae lands, along with her sacred immortal sun stags. As he fled to
    Terrasen
    , Athril covered for Brannon, and battled Maeve. Maeve desired Silba's ring of Valg protection, for her final defence against the Valg Kings. But Athril hid the ring in
    Goldryn
    —the sword blessed by Mala—and even after Maeve killed Athril, she could not find the ring.
   </p>
   <p key="a131cd29-45aa-4f16-aeca-610c2767a7fc">
    But Maeve still prepared for the inevitable arrival of the Valg Kings. She hoarded a stronghold of Fae healers and stationed them between the now-mortal lands of Wendlyn and Doranelle. Not to give mortals their healing salvation, but a defense against the Valg because it was Silba’s healing magic that could rid a man, woman, or Fae, from Valg possession. It could remove the demon-like an infected parasite, and then its true demonic form would wither and die in the sunlight, which they greatly fear.
   </p>
   <p key="4d8764fd-0c5c-45b9-b8ef-c5c4d78afe9d">
    In her empire's stronghold, Queen Maeve sought out the gifted Fae, bearing magic and might, and who had powerful beasts lurking beneath their Fae forms. The strongest of them she had swear the blood oath to her, so that she could command them to anything—total submission to her whims. Maeve had these Fae, her
    Cadre
    , oversee the armies she had been building. At some point in time, she had the fortress
    Mistward
    created for the
    Demi-Fae
    that wanted to cross to Doranelle. The gifted Demi-Fae who could shift, or bore strong magic, were sent to Doranelle like the other Fae. She kept an extremely gifted healer of Silba, who’s secondary Fae form is a white barn owl, as her absolute last line of defence.
   </p>
   <p key="5cd3d285-1117-457e-9c81-21d167696573">
    After gathering her forces, Maeve retreated to Doranelle, where she built up her final defense against
    <a class="mw-redirect" href="Aelin Ashryver Galathynius.html" key="ee2a5baa-2b90-4b25-a6c8-98f18de441ed" title="Aelin Ashryver Galathynius">
     Aelin
    </a>
    . The three Fae-Queens' former palace and settling was abandoned to the City of Rivers in Doranelle. She created a palace of stone smack atop a river basin, so that if Brannon's heir came after her, she would be safe. She did not search for the Wyrdkeys, because she learned through her gifts that Aelin, the heir of
    Mala Fire-Bringer
    , would lead her to them. So she took the measures to have her niece brought to her, forcing Aelin's mate
    Rowan
    to love
    Lyria
    , then breaking him by killing Lyria. This was so that when
    <a class="mw-redirect" href="Evalin Ashryver.html" key="c42d3f35-a7db-48c3-9a1c-4d8a80ae4fc5" title="Evalin Ashryver">
     Evalin Ashryver
    </a>
    brought Aelin to Maeve, she would at last be in her clutches, and give Maeve anything, including the Wyrdkeys, which Brannon made sure only Aelin could retrieve.
   </p>
   A thousand years later, when Terrasen was attacked, Maeve denied help to the kingdom as punishment for keeping Aelin from her.

   Doranelle

   Maeve shows interest in Aelin's powers and wants Aelin to show her what had become of them. She tells her that Evalin hid her from Maeve for years, and she wanted to stifle Aelin's power when Maeve only wanted her to submit to it. She also tells Aelin that she didn't help Terrasen because Evalin did not uphold her promise but lied. Maeve comes to the point, informs her she has learned that Aelin wants answers about the
   Wyrdkeys

   Though it takes a great deal of time for her to be able to shift between her human and Fae forms, and learn control over her gift, Aelin manages to do it. Not long after, she, along with Rowan and his

   Maeve suspects that Aelin may know where the third key is, and she begins to have the cadre whip Rowan to force Aelin to divulge the information. She only halts when Aelin calls on her power to encircle the city, stating that even if it is made of stone, its people aren't. She then bargains with Maeve: A ring from a long-dead lover then traitor—
   Athril
   —in exchange for Rowan's freedom from his blood oath. Aelin does not realize at the time the ring's true power, and Maeve accepts the offer. Once Rowan is released, he swears a new oath to Aelin.

   Once they emerge from the Witch Mirror, Maeve manages to transport them both before her. She forces Lorcan to hold Elide, and overpowers her enemy in a duel of magic. Aelin's magic was depleted from putting out the fires and destroying the ilken, so she has almost nothing left.

   After Gavriel and Fenrys return to their queen, Gavriel offers to take Aelin's punishment, but Maeve refuses. Since he failed to kill Lorcan, she strips him of the blood oath for dishonor, severely weakening him. She magically disarms Aelin and reveals that she knew about Gavriel's son, and the Lock Aelin must die to recreate. Maeve has no intention of letting that happen because she wants the Wyrdkeys for herself. The Valg Queen also reveals that she saw Aelin and Rowan as mates in the future and decided to leash them to her. Maeve used her powers to make Rowan fall in love with
   Lyria

Maeve forces Aelin to bow, then take off her shirt, which she does. The Dark Queen orders Cairn to whip Aelin but orders Aelin to count. Cairn starts over repeatedly at Maeve's command, stopping only when one of the Fae warriors holding Aelin spots Rowan approaching. Maeve straps an iron to Aelin's face, and her warriors chain the assassin and put her in an iron box.

Despite claiming that he stole the ring and betrayed Aelin all for Maeve, the queen states she has no use for a warrior she can't trust. She takes back her kill order but also strips him of the blood oath without honor. She departs afterward, and her ship vanishes.
