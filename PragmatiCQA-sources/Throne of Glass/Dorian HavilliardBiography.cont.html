During this encounter, Dorian informs Celaena of his plans for her: his father has made the decision to host a tournament to determine the new royal Champion of Adarlan, and she is to compete as Dorian's competitor and to win the contest, therefore officially becoming the royal Champion. If Celaena wins and serves

He then storms out of the conference room and heads down a hall to cool down. Finally, in a secluded hallway, Dorian's rage boils over, and he punches the wall. He is stunned when the stone cracks under the blow and the nearby window shatters, but he is left untouched; he vomits in shock.
