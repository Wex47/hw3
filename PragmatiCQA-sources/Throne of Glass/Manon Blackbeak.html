   , Manon's mother
   Lothian Blackbeak
   , and
   Tristan Crochan
   fell in love with one another, and Lothian became pregnant with Manon. During labor, Lothian revealed Manon's parentage to
   Mother Blackbeak
   , saying that she believed that Manon's mixed blood could be the key to breaking the curse on the Ironteeth. Manon was told that her mother died birthing her; in reality, Mother Blackbeak killed her own daughter after Manon was born. Tristan never ceased loving Lothian and his daughter, and he continued to diligently search for them. Mother Blackbeak tracked him down; she taunted him, informing him that she had killed his lover and that she would turn Manon into a monster before slaughtering him.
   Rhiannon
   , Manon's paternal half-sister, assumed the search in her father's stead.

They rummage around her house, searching for valuables and calling for her to come out, though Manon knows they just wanted to steal from her and then kill her because the people of the village are afraid of her. When two of the men exit Manon's room, she slips out of the dresser in which she hid, sneaks up behind the lone man, and disembowels him. A second man walks in on Manon drinking the first man's blood and runs, but Manon quickly catches and kills him. When the third realizes that his friends are dead, he flees into the field by the cottage; Manon tracks him and murders him as well.

She names it

Manon asks the duke why they are doing all of this, and he replies, “Because we can. And because this world has too long dwelled in ignorance and archaic tradition.
