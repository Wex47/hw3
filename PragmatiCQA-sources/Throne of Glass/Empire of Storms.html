   Elide and Lorcan go to several taverns for news of Aelin. Some of their carnival companions give them away. Lorcan hears them coming. The two escape on a boat. Lorcan kills the captain, which makes Elide furious. Something triggers Lorcan, and he examines the amulet Aelin gave him. He realizes it’s a fake and roars in anger. He steers the shop towards Eyllwe, the best lead they got at the taverns as to where Aelin is.

Aelin thanks Lorcan for bringing Elide and tells Manon she claims her. Manon bristles at that, as does Lorcan and Elide. Rowan notices a difference in Lorcan, that he is softer.

   Maeve tells Aelin she knew Aelin would lead her to all three Wyrdkeys. She saw it all. She saw Aelin's mate, Rowan. She knew their children would be powerful enough to rule the world. She knew how to get Aelin to hand over the wyrdkeys when she was strong enough to get them all. Maeve tricked Rowan into believing
   Lyria

   Maeve explains that when they met, they were both so broken they didn’t immediately recognize each other as mates. Aelin has known it since the battle with Manon at

   Maeve makes Aelin bow before her and take off her shirt for Cairn to give her ten lashes. She orders Aelin to count each lash. Aelin refuses. Maeve starts the ten lashes over and over again.

Elide tells Rowan that Aelin is his mate and about the whipping and the box. They’re mad that Lysandra knew all along. But Aelin had asked for her help that day she was sick on the boat. She had told Lysandra that she suspects that she is the price to seal the wyrdkeys in the gate and banish Erawan forever. She asked Lysandra to shift into Aelin’s form after Aelin dies and be married to Rowan, fathering the heirs with Aedion so they will be able to pass as royals.
