   Chaol often finds himself chaperoning the two girls. Aelin is excluded from the festival of

   Tired of being excluded from another celebration, Aelin sneaks into the masked ball held to celebrate
   Yulemas
   . Chaol recognizes Aelin immediately, and although he is fuming with anger at her insubordination, he agrees to let her stay. Frustrated that no one will ask her to dance, Aelin chides Chaol for glaring away all of her would-be suitors. When Chaol claims to be doing no such thing, she asks him to dance. He refuses, stating that it would be dangerous for them to dance. Just in time, Dorian arrives and asks his champion for a dance, and at that moment, Aelin realizes that she might have feelings for the prince.

   Kaltain makes a point of trying to find out the truth about Aelin and even goes so far as to poison Aelin with bloodbane at Duke Perrington's request during the final battle against Cain. Cain seems to know about Aelin; not only her true identity but also about events that he could not possibly have witnessed. He uses this knowledge to break Aelin's spirit. Despite this, however, Aelin fights the effects of the poison with the help of Elena and a moment of tender encouragement from Chaol. Cain, however, is more than he seems; it's as if he is possessed. Evil entities appear, clawing at her, but Elena appears and fights them off. A strange mark appears on Aelin's forehead during the fight, later revealed to be a

They share a tender moment of understanding and embrace until Dorian walks in and the two break apart. Aelin decides to break up with Dorian, concluding that it would not fit for the Crown Prince to carry on a relationship with the King's Champion. She asks him to remain her friend. Dorian seems quite disappointed but agrees. After breaking it off with Dorian, Chaol returns, and Aelin remarks that it is unusual—she is pleased that she gets to see him twice in one day. Aelin tells Chaol that she is ending things with the prince. He joins her in dinner, and they raise a glass, Chaol toasting Aelin.

   Elena visits Aelin again and tells her that she has more work to do and that even though she has defeated Cain, there is more evil ahead. Upon signing the contract to be the King's Champion, the King threatens that should Aelin betray him or not return from a mission, he will kill Chaol and Nehemia's family. Aelin admits to Chaol that she may have just signed away her soul; however, the two walk arm in arm as the Captain and the King's Champion.

   Rhiannon Crochan
   - who cast Mala's essence into the small blue witch-mirror to unleash it's massive power just once. As Elena called to her mother, Mala looked away from her. Anneith orders Elena to release Erawan, to repay her betrayal and punish the mortals. Hellas calls Elena a fool for wasting their Lock to temporarily seal Erawan, when all could have been solved at once. Elena begs to let another generation inherit the war, where they will be well prepared. Farnor calls her a coward to shove the burden on another. But Mala said that since they have waited this long to return to their realm, they may wait and watch Erilea a little longer. The Three-Faced Goddess proceeds to warn Elena that they will wait, but there will be a price, and a promise. That Mala's bloodline will bleed again, and her descendant with her Fire-Bringer gifts will re-forge the Lock, send the gods back to their realm alongside Erawan and his armies, where the gods will destroy them. Once the gods leave, Mala's scion must seal the three wyrdkeys back to the wyrdgate, completing it and holding it intact forever, yielding every last drop of their life force - something Brannon was prepared to do originally.

   Elena appears and apologizes to Aelin, as she is the one who must now pay for her mistakes. Aelin realizes Elena saved her that night when she should've died years ago so she could die later on. She had enough strength back then, but Elena couldn't bear to let her die just yet. She revives Aelin and awakes Arobynn Hamel from his nearby home to come to rescue her. Elena pays for this with her soul. She will not get to spend eternity with her husband or her children. Aelin asks why. Elena wanted her to grow up, be strong, and experience love, even briefly, with the man who had unknowingly been waiting for her for so long in Wendlyn.

Lorcan uses the opportunity to kill the guards and rescue Elide. He wants her to run. She doesn't want to be a coward. Maeve's darkness lashes at Aelin. Maeve only stands a chance because Aelin's magic is depleted. Elide begs Manon to help Aelin as Maeve gains the upper hand. Fenrys and Gavriel arrive. All of Aelin's magic is gone.

She knew their children would be powerful enough to rule the world. She knew how to get her to hand over the keys when she was strong enough to get them all. Maeve tricked Rowan into believing Lyria was his true mate—she let him fall in love, let her get pregnant, and then killed her while she was with child. She ensured their paths would cross when Aelin was of age. She knew Aelin would give her whatever if she pulled the right strings.

   Maeve explains that they were both so broken when they met that they didn't immediately recognize each other as mates. Aelin has known it since the battle with Manon at Temis's temple months ago. She kept it from Rowan since then. She tells Aelin she would've had a thousand years with him, and she's probably five years from settling into her immortal Fae form. Maeve calls for Cairn. Maeve says Aelin must come willingly. If she struggles, she'll bring Elide along with them, too. Maeve orders Lorcan and Fenrys to be perfectly still through the blood oath. Aelin surrenders. She gives Elide messages to give to Aedion and Rowan. Maeve makes Aelin bow before her and take off her shirt for Cairn to give her ten lashes. She orders Aelin to count each lash. Aelin refuses. Maeve starts the ten lashes over and over again. They hear others approaching, so they stop the beating to leave. They put Aelin in a metal box, chain her with iron, and put an iron mask over her face. They carry the box towards Maeve's boat. Maeve is not aware that Aelin slipped the Wyrdkeys into Manon's pocket as she walked past her. Manon knows she needs to get the others and Elide far away from Maeve.

Rowan kneels on the beach in the pools of Aelin's blood for a long time before swearing to Aedion that he will find her, shifting into his hawk form and flying into the horizon.
