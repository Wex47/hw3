    Rolfe

   , Lord of Pirates. Sam expresses annoyance with Celaena's snooping around Rolfe's office, but she continues to do so and even sits in Rolfe's chair. Sam introduces himself before Celaena launches into a tirade against Rolfe, in which she accuses him of being involved in the attack against the assassins. When Rolfe opens Arobynn's documents and reveals that the documents demand no retribution for the deaths of the assassins but rather is a slave trade agreement, Celaena immediately assumes that Sam knew about the contents of the documents but concealed the information from her anyway. Rolfe tells Sam and Celaena that there are two rooms prepared for them, and Sam chuckles when Rolfe misinterprets Celaena's reason for insisting that only one room is necessary.

  <p key="c06226d1-af76-4651-9a8b-cde26707d219">
   Upon their arrival in their room, Celaena turns to Sam to scold him about the slave trade agreement, but Sam informs her that he didn't know anything either until Rolfe opened the documents. Celaena hypothesizes that Rolfe lied about the contents of the documents, but Sam points out that there was no reason for him to. He then asks if he can bathe first, causing Celaena to throw her cloak at him and declare that she will go first.

  <p key="11c84c69-db77-4ebd-8c07-6278bb9e2347">
   At dinner, Sam spends a great deal of time mocking Celaena. He listens with fascination as Rolfe recounts the story of his tattoo. Then he asks how Rolfe became the Pirate Lord; Rolfe replies that he killed every pirate better than he was, before advising Celaena to be cautious around Sam, who laughs in response. When he and Celaena retire to their room for the night, Sam continues to lightheartedly tease her.
  </p>
  <p key="db85de7c-4d4b-46a7-a30b-ef0598846d45">
   The following morning, Celaena half-jokingly asks if her breakfast is poisoned; Sam responds by inquiring whether she thinks the food was poisoned by him or the pirates. Sam then presses her about her discussion with Rolfe earlier that morning, and he demands that she be honest with him when she dodges the question. In an attempt to evade answering Sam's questions about what she wants from Rolfe, Celaena suggests that perhaps she can't resist Rolfe's good looks, causing Sam to go tense. He opens the window because he is warm and frustrated with Celaena, but she shuts the window and shutters before tossing his cloak over the window. Irritated, Sam tells Celaena that he tires of the melodrama revolving around her mask and cloak and of her bossing him around. Sam grips her wrist and reminds her that she still answers to Arobynn; Celaena threatens to cut his hand off if he touches her again.

   Despite being an assassin, Sam had a strong moral compass. Due to the death of his mother at the hands of a jealous client, Sam was sympathetic to slaves and courtesans and had a particular fondness for children, making him well-liked among Madame

   Rifthold
   . This outrage compelled him to aid Celaena in her plot to free the slaves. One way that is certain to always get onto Sam’s nerves is to mention selling children into slavery and selling them to a brothel. When his mother was 8 years old, she was sold to a brothel and had to claw her way up to the top.
