  <p key="44530452-ce24-4de1-8417-fa8c26c7054f">
   Yrene grew up in a small village in southern
   <a href="Fenharrow.html" key="974b4068-3101-4989-8a64-8d895034cebd" title="Fenharrow">
    Fenharrow
   </a>
   , learning the healing arts alongside her prodigiously gifted
   mother
   . Blessed by the goddess of healing,
   Silba
   , her mother never charged for healing as she simply thought it was her duty, a value that her daughter, Yrene, inherited. When Yrene was eleven years old, following the
   <a href="The Fall of Magic.html" key="47bbf91d-5944-40a2-8e1d-709c364066a0" title="The Fall of Magic">
    Fall of Magic
   </a>
   and the subsequent purge by the
   Kingdom of Adarlan
   , soldiers came to seize both Yrene and her mother, despite the non-violent nature of their magic. Her mother killed one of the soldiers and distracted the others so that Yrene could escape, fleeing into
   Oakwald Forest
   . She watched from the shadows of the forest as her mother was burned alive.
  </p>
  <p key="83d93257-4875-448f-b1e9-6379b1664df7">
   Following her mother's death, Yrene went to live with her mother's cousin in another Fenharrow village, posing as a non-gifted, distant relative. Although without her magic, she still dreamed of being a healer, like her mother and grandmother before her. Shortly before her eighteenth birthday, Yrene left her cousin's house with a plan to sail to the
   Southern continent
   , where she could enroll at the
   <a href="Torre Cesme.html" key="7e219911-ab1f-40e8-890b-750dc99512ae" title="Torre Cesme">
    Torre Cesme
   </a>
   , the Academy of Healers and Physicians. However, by the time she reached the port-town of Innish in
   Melisande
   , she had run out of money and began working at the White Pig Inn in order to save for her travels. Her increasing worry about money gave her the excuse to continue working at the inn, regardless of its squalor and less than desirable clientele, especially as the owner of the inn,
   Nolan
   , kept raising her rent.

  </h3>
  <p key="2921f5a9-d3a7-46d6-9b93-02bed9db4768">
   Working at the White Pig Inn for a year, Yrene encounters the mysteriously hooded
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Celaena Sardothien.html" key="fb6ed712-ff01-4b9f-b4b1-22fd50fc6dbc" title="Celaena Sardothien">
    Celaena Sardothien
   </a>
   , whom she worries will be attacked by the thieves present.
   While she is taking out the trash, Yrene is attacked instead by four mercenaries, hoping to rob her of the night's earnings; Celaena witnesses the attack and kills three of the four men. Hoping to return the favor, Yrene tends to her injuries while sharing the story of her life. Worried about the young woman in such a dangerous town, Celaena decides to teach Yrene basic self-defense so that she might be able to protect herself in the future.
  </p>
  <p key="f05eac6a-4d1c-42ea-9955-6c3d2ff10e41">
   However, they are soon confronted by the fourth mercenary, who brought comrades in his quest for revenge. When Celaena refuses to lower her weapons on the threat of Yrene's life. At first, Yrene is terrified, but once she uses her newly acquired skills, she incapacitated her captor while Celaena dispatches the others; it is revealed that Celaena was merely using the men and their attack as training for Yrene. After Celaena's departure, Yrene returns to her room to find a coin purse, full of money and a golden brooch, to aid her in reaching the Southern Continent. Elated, Yrene leaves Innish behind and boards a ship sailing south.
  </p>
  <p key="bff1477c-3075-4712-8482-a7822bdb31f6">
   After arriving at the Torre Cesme, Yrene confronted the Healer on High,
   Hafiza
   , and placed a bag of gold on her desk as payment for tuition at the Torre, begging her for admittance. Hafiza told her to take the gold back to her humiliation, and Yrene was so mortified that she considered jumping out of the window. Unbeknownst to her, tuition at the Torre is free, and her gold was not needed. Overwhelmed, Yrene broke down, and Hafiza held her as she cried.
  </p>
  <p key="1c8405e0-0de3-4658-b088-4531bb9520bd">
   Over the next two years, Yrene rose swiftly in the ranks due to her immense knowledge and work ethic; those years spent learning from her mother guaranteed that she already knew much more than the other students. She also met and became friends with
   Hasar
   and
   Kashin
   , two of the
   khagan's
   children. Kashin developed feelings for her, though she rebuffed him due to his royal status.

   , and Hafiza explains that she has decided to send Yrene in her place to help him. Yrene blatantly refuses, due to the fact that Chaol is from
   Adarlan
   and served the man who had her mother killed. She argues with Hafiza about it, until the old woman says that she is disappointed as she hoped for Yrene to one day take her place. She says it will be Yrene's final test before she leaves the Torre to return to Fenharrow and aid in the war. Yrene reluctantly agrees.

   present, she coldly asks Chaol questions about his injury while ignoring those he poses to her, pretending to write down his answers on a piece of paper. In actual fact, she writes her mother,
   Josefin's
   , name down over and over again. Hasar interrupts the assessment to say hello to Yrene, whose mood lifts as they joke around. Yrene lightly hints that Hasar should leave so she can continue, horrifying Nesryn, but Hasar only quips about cutting Yrene's tongue out and leaves. Yrene continues her examination of Chaol's back and asks a few more questions, before leaving herself. She is startled by the malevolent magic that surrounds his injury.

   Yrene returns to the Torre and immediately goes to Hafiza while mulling over Chaol and how young he is compared to what she expected. She discusses the assessment with Hafiza and tells her of the rotted feeling from Chaol's injury. She tells Hafiza that she thinks she can heal him; Hafiza asks if that means that she will help him. Yrene admits that she is missing information about his life, and that doesn't absolve him of the sins of Adarlan but she decides to help him. She makes plans to go to the library and research spinal injuries.

They leave the Lord to his loneliness and are taken to their rooms.

   Sartaq and Nesryn arrive the next morning with a contingent of ruks, having scouted ahead for news of the approaching army. The outlook is grim. Yrene organizes the healers and sets up a medical station, and also sets about evacuating families on the lake-side of the Keep who might be endangered by catapults. The Valg army arrives, and the onslaught begins. For the next five days, Yrene is occupied with healing the injured soldiers and ruks of the Anielle and the khaganate while worrying about Chaol. On her way to the next patients she is stopped by
   Eretia

Yrene express her gratitude for the help she gave, and Aelin is moved to tears when she realizes that Yrene and Chaol are married. Introductions are made, and information is shared. After the meeting ends Yrene finds Chaol rubbing down his horse and tells him she's pregnant, though to her dismay he already knows thanks to his father's careful observations.

   Chaol is left with the unenviable task of introducing Aelin to his father; Yrene would very much like to see that conversation, and goes with him. Surprisingly, they find that Lord Westfall has already found out about Aelin and meet him on his way to her. Chaol reluctantly introduces him, and Yrene quietly watches while the show begins, enjoying every moment of it. Aelin deals with the Lord in her usual bittersweet manner, taking great pleasure in telling him that Chaol is hand to the

She expresses concern over Yrene's health when she witnesses the healer throwing up after cleaning out a wound. Yrene assures her she's fine, just ill from the pregnancy. She offers to heal Elide's ankle, and examines it for her before laying out her options. For her to heal the ankle she would have to re-break all the bones that healed improperly and set them correctly, which would take months of work and be agonizingly painful even with help from magic. Elide would be unable to walk for a while as well. Alternatively she could give her salve to use that would numb the pain to a point, but Elide would develop arthritis and eventually the salve wouldn't work. Elide chooses to wait before deciding.
