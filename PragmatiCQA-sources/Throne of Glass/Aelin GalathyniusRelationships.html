   Ansel

   Silent Assassins
   . The two girls had a great sympathy for each other since both had been victims of treachery and were forced to escape their homelands. However, Ansel was

   's spy, and wanting to avoid Aelin getting killed in the slaughter, she had put her to sleep with a sleeping potion and abandoned her in the middle of the Red Desert with a fake letter from their master. Aelin, however, returned to the fortress and found out the truth about Ansel—Ansel had given her a chance to escape. Because of Ansel's treachery, Aelin promised that she would shoot an arrow after twenty minutes, giving Ansel a chance to escape. Aelin actually fired the arrow after twenty-one minutes, as otherwise, she would have killed Ansel. We also find out that while Caelena (Aelin) was in
