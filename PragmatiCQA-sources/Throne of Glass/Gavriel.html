   Gavriel first appears at night time while it is raining, in his mountain cat form. Rowan goes to meet him, and it is revealed that Gavriel is grieving for his fallen men. So they both go to Rowan's room to have the names of his fallen men inked onto his flesh. Aelin, however, interrupts the moment with food, claiming that Rowan forgot to eat. She catches Gavriel in a moment of weakness as he is sprawled out on top of Rowan's table with ink. She then later leaves after Rowan yells at her, but before she goes, Gavriel sniffs the air, smelling her scent and most likely recognizing her bloodline.

   He finds Rowan and helps him keep the invaders back, but Rowan finds out that Aelin is not in good condition and rushes out to help her. Not wanting his friend to die, Gavriel chases after him and tackles him to the ground, stating that it is a lost cause to try and help Aelin now, as she is currently being trapped and devoured by the princes. However, Rowan is not deterred and continued to struggle against Gavriel who holds the mighty warrior down with his strength and using protecting

   Later on, as it is revealed that Aelin will make it, Rowan breaks free from Gavriel, who is in shock at seeing Aelin's burst of fire, and watches as Rowan gives Aelin his magic to borrow and defeat the princes' once and for all. With the battle won, all the others leave without another word, but Gavriel stays behind to say goodbye to Rowan and Aelin. He is puzzled and asks how old Aelin is, to which she replies that she is nineteen. He is then relieved, most likely because she couldn't have possibly been one of his former lovers, as she bears a striking resemblance to Aedion's mother. He then departs with the others.

He had no facial expression, having been through this before. After the Doranelle encounter, he wasn't seen again.

This is a theory for why Gavriel asked Aelin how old she is, for the striking resemblance she bears of Aedion's mother. However, Gavriel has no such knowledge of having a son.

   . They agree, saying Maeve never said a specific time when ordering them with the blood oath. Later on Skull's Bay, Gavriel meets his son, Aedion. Aedion is angered and confused, yet Gavriel never stops trying to earn his son's approval. Gavriel helps in many battles and even refrains from killing Lorcan to help. During the altercation on the beach with Maeve, he offers to take whatever punishment was meant for Aelin, because he knew how much Aelin means to Aedion and if he lost her again it would break him. He later pays for this when Maeve breaks the blood oath and marks him dishonorable forever. This way of breaking the blood oath is viewed negatively because it marks a person as dishonorable. At the end of the book Gavriel volunteers with Lorcan and
   Elide
   to help Rowan track down his lost mate and get her back from Maeve.

   Gavriel helps Rowan to find Aelin, with the help of Lorcan and Elide. He also braces Elide's ankle since she won't allow Lorcan to do so anymore. When he finds out Maeve is a Valg queen, Gavriel is appalled and in shock like the others. In

Aedion runs towards Gavriel to stop him, but he is too late when he sees Gavriel's dead body. Aedion promises to bury him in the royal graveyard, and also adds Gavriel's name to the tattoo over his heart. Aelin has Gavriel swear the blood oath, despite his death.

   Rowan used to be one of Queen Maeve's cadre, but left for

   to go after Aelin. Their relationship shows that they greatly trust one another, as when Rowan offered to tattoo Gavriel for him. Though Rowan would never admit it out loud, their bond is that of trust worthy comrades, and Gavriel would do anything to keep his friend safe. As such, when Rowan called for him to help when the Valg attacked Mistward, he came right away.
