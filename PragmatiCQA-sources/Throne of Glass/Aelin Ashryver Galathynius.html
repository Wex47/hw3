    heritage manifested itself at an early age. She could shift between forms quite easily, though her fire control was less than exemplary. Her lack of control led to a deep-seated fear of her own powers, which was so intense that she considered it a relief when magic fell and she no longer had to fear herself. As a child, Aelin also encountered

   Aelin meets with Arobynn's inner circle of assassins late at night. Arobynn announces that
   Gregori
   's mission has failed, resulting in his capture and incarceration in the castle dungeons. Aelin suggests that the assassins poison him before he leaks any information to the authorities, as per protocol, but Sam expresses horror to this proposal. She then inquires about Ben, as she has noticed that he is not present, and Arobynn reveals that Ben was killed during the mission. Outraged, Aelin demands why the others did not retrieve his body. Sam replies that there were too many guards and that the retrieval could potentially lead the guards to the Assassins' Keep. Furious, Aelin stalks out of the room, vowing to recover her friend's body.
  </p>
  <p key="e12e18d7-f0ee-4e97-be90-0701c5fcffdf">
   Two months later, Aelin and Sam travel to
   Skull's Bay
   to meet with
   Rolfe
   as Arobynn's emissaries, in order to exact retribution from the Lord of Pirates for the murders of three other assassins by pirates. Aelin expresses indignation at Rolfe's tardiness and roots around his office, much to Sam's irritation. Rolfe arrives and demands that Aelin remove herself from his chair.
  </p>
  <p key="a6d1dd40-b57b-4360-85de-9c37a319d053">
   She rises, sits beside Sam, and then accuses Rolfe of being involved in the death of three assassins who died in Bellhaven, citing the tattoos spotted on the attackers. The Pirate Lord argues that the tattoos would not be spotted since there are no streetlights at the docks, but the incident occurred during a full moon. She and Sam hand Arobynn's letter to Rolfe; he finishes reading it, then reveals that he will not be compensating Arobynn in gold, but rather—much to Aelin's horror—is brokering a slave trade agreement with him. Although she was unaware of the true content of the letter, Aelin acts as if she knew exactly what the message was.
  </p>
  <p key="74c21ef9-d0a9-40af-90ea-469c73b93908">
   Rolfe sends Aelin and Sam to their lodging. Initially, Rolfe plans to provide two separate rooms for them, but Aelin insists that only one room is necessary. Rolfe raises his eyebrows suggestively, prompting Aelin to clarify that she wishes for two beds in one room.
  </p>
  <p key="163252a4-2584-43d2-a609-2d47e71a2f65">
   Alone in the room with Sam, Aelin turns on him, believing that he had prior knowledge of the letter's contents, but he denies her accusations. Aelin rants, baffled as to why Arobynn would deceive them and dispatch them to reprove Rolfe for a crime he was not involved in. Sam says that Arobynn has his reasons, but Aelin presses on, expressing disgust at the idea of trading slaves. She asserts that the
   guild
   does not need the money, but she wonders if Arobynn is not as wealthy as she believes and has been spending money that he does not have, or if he simply wishes to become more affluent. Sam asks if she is going to bathe or if he can go first, and Aelin storms off to take a bath.
  </p>
  <p key="44cd2d86-fa00-4326-befb-a0b52250151c">
   Rolfe taunts Aelin at dinner, urging her to remove her mask to partake in the meal, but she refuses. When he questions her about her past, Aelin shoots back a gibe about the map tattoo, implying Rolfe did not work for his position as she did for hers. Rolfe then tells her that the map has been immutable for the past eight years, which unnerves Aelin, and that he did have to toil and kill to earn his title. Once again, Rolfe remarks on her arrogance and cites Sam as an example of discretion in choosing when to speak. He warns Aelin to be wary of Sam, as he could be waiting for a chance to eliminate her. Aelin snaps at Rolfe to mind his own business.
  </p>
  <p key="a6fb8de6-c9b6-4b33-9cc9-57e92ac8b155">
   Back in their room, Sam pokes fun at Aelin, who threateningly suggests that perhaps he should not sleep that night. He asks if she really cannot tolerate teasing, to which she replies that she cannot when it involves her life. He nervously asks if he should be concerned about sleeping that night, but she laughs to herself and reassures him that he need not worry—for tonight, at least. He falls asleep, and Aelin listens to his breathing as she keeps watch.
   Aelin does not sleep well that night because the situation with the slave trade frustrates her. She thinks Ben would be appalled by the deal, too, because he was the kindest person she knew. Disgusted with the immorality of slaving and Arobynn's choice to involve her in his deal, Aelin decides to rescue the slaves and convinces Sam to assist her.

   After disarming the guards of the two slave ships, disabling seven other ships, and starting a city-wide brawl, the two assassins successfully help the two hundred slaves escape and secure a contractual agreement with Rolfe, effectively ending both Arobynn's and Rolfe's involvement in the slave trade and establishing
   Skull's Bay
   as a safe haven for escaped slaves. Their collaboration blossoms into a tentative—if somewhat awkward—friendship between the rival assassins and they return together to face the wrath of Arobynn.

   Following her abolition of the Skull's Bay slave trade and the severe beating from Arobynn as a result, Aelin is sent to train with the
   Silent Assassins
   as further punishment. After spending two days waiting for her ship to the Red Desert, she is in a combative mood and expresses some disappointment that no one has attempted to rob her.
   Yrene Towers
   notices Aelin, although she does not know her by name. She observes that the mysterious girl can drink quite a bit and keeps to the shadows. When she brings dinner to the girl's table and the girl speaks to her, Yrene notes her manner of speaking, which marks her as an educated person, and remarks mentally that she is wise to eschew the stew. Aelin watches Yrene move about the White Pig, admiring her deft avoidance of the grasps of handsy customers. Her thoughts turn to her own restlessness, as the room she rented from Nolan is foul, the town is too isolated to offer any decent entertainment, and she has already read her books more than once.

   Itching for a fight, Aelin sneaks into the alley behind the inn after closing only to find four mercenaries attack Yrene in the hopes of stealing her meager earnings. After killing three of the four men, Aelin allows a shaken but grateful Yrene to treat her wounds while the young woman shares her heart-wrenching story, revealing her past as a gifted healer. Aelin gruffly questions Yrene as to why she, the daughter of a healer, is in Innish working as a barmaid; she admonishes her for not pressing on and at least being penniless in

   instead of miserable in Innish and criticizes her for allowing herself to waste away in the awful town for the sake of a clean conscience. When Yrene doesn't answer, Aelin asks how long it has been since her mother died and acknowledges the hardship of being a gifted healer—especially one from

   to help those in need of healers. The barmaid tries to offer Aelin something to treat the injuries on her face, but Aelin refuses, saying that they are meant to be a reminder for herself. Instead of leaving, Aelin—out of fear for Yrene's safety—offers to teach her to defend herself.

   Aelin coaches Yrene on the most effective self-defense moves. When Yrene murmurs that she should impart Aelin's tips to Jessa, Aelin urges Yrene to share what she has learned with any female who bothers to listen. The time for Aelin's departure nears, and she realizes that she does not want to remain in one place out of uncertainty and resignation like Yrene. Yrene inquires whether Aelin has needed to use the self-defense moves before; Aelin admits that she has—usually as the hunter.

   However, they are soon interrupted by the fourth mercenary, who returns with his comrades to exact revenge. When Aelin refuses to lower her weapons on the threat of Yrene's death, Yrene incapacitates her attacker while Aelin quickly dispatches the others, revealing that Aelin was simply using the attack as training for Yrene. With her ship scheduled to depart in the morning, Aelin feels a tug of fate toward the healer and leaves her money and a ruby brooch in the hopes that Yrene can finally afford to travel to the
   southern continent
   to train as a healer. Without another word, Aelin boards the ship to the Red Desert.

   Conceding to her punishment given to her by Arobynn, Aelin journeys through the crimson dunes of the Red Desert to the fortress of the Silent Assassins, to train with the
   Mute Master
   and gain his approval within a month's time. Upon arrival at the fortress, her skills are tested but she is deemed worthy enough to train with the other acolytes, among them
   Ilias
   , the son of the Mute Master, and
   Ansel of Briarcliff
   , who becomes a fast friend. Training vigorously with the other acolytes and running daily to the oasis, she aids in the defense of the fortress against the silent attack of

   During her stay in the fortress, she even has a relationship with Illias, which soon comes to an end because she remembers Sam. Ansel gets mad at Celaena for almost kissing Ilias, and they get in a fight. Then Ansel pretends to apologize to Celaena, but instead, she drugs her and leaves her in the desert with the instructions to leave, but Celaena goes back. Then, she finds out that Lord Berick’s men have attacked the fortress and killed many assassins, including Mikhail, an assassin that Ansel had faked a relationship with, and almost Ilias. The Mute Master isn’t dead yet, and Celaena finds out Ansel has betrayed them all and has been working with Lord Berick because he promised her an army to take back Briarcliff. Celaena beats Ansel, of course, and she saves everyone. She tells Ansel she will kill her if she isn’t gone by twenty minutes, but she actually doesn’t shoot at her until after twenty-one minutes because Ansel used to be her friend.

   Aelin is very passionate about many things, and especially so with the people she loves. When she cares for someone, she cares for them deeply and has experienced enough loss in her life to never want to feel it again. Aelin's passionate nature also often extends to her interests, including books, sweets, and music. Aelin can often be called rude or even evil, but she obviously loves her homeland and friends very much.

   Aelin feels things both strongly and deeply. While she is often teasing, witty, and carefree when she is happy, Aelin's most immediate reaction when angry or sad is to channel her darker emotions into a barely-contained rage or killing calm. This gets her into trouble more often than not, such as when she is captured due to her rash actions and desire for vengeance after the murder of
   Sam Cortland

   Aelin also has a strong moral compass. Though she often tries to suppress the memories of her tumultuous past, her experiences have shaped her into the woman she is, and that is a woman who does not tolerate injustices. Aelin absolutely loathes slavery and unnecessary cruelty, as is evidenced when she allows her contracted targets to go free while acting as the King's Champion and when she freed the slaves at Skull's Bay with the help of
   Sam Cortland

   Aelin is described as being particularly beautiful, with long golden hair that shines in the sunlight, which is quite long because the healers at
   Doranelle
   left it to grow and her hair has grown down to her navel as a result. She also possesses Ashryver eyes—bright turquoise eyes with golden rings around the pupils, which serves as the major giveaway to her true identity since they are so distinctive and only run in her family. In her Fae form, she has pointed ears and elongated canines. Her body also becomes taller and leaner in this form. Standing at 5’7”, Aelin’s body is lithe and toned, and nevertheless, she is blessed with impressive curves and well-formed breasts. She has many scars, including those on her back which she received from whips during her time in the Salt Mines of

   , but these were erased. She also has five tattoos that each describe the stories of how she lost her loved ones, these include Lady Marion Lochan, her mother, father and uncle, her people of Terasen, Sam Cortland, and Princess Nehemia of Eyllwe. All her scars later disappeared in
   Kingdom of Ash
   because of
   Doranelle
   's healers' ministrations. 
In Queen of Shadows, she dyed her hair red for a while as a cover to become less recognizable, and fortunately, it worked. Nesryn admitted she would have found Aelin earlier if her hair appeared golden.
