   Nestled between the crimson sand dunes of the Red Desert, the fortress of the Silent Assassins is made of red sandstone topped with battlements and encircled with lush green trees. Snaking rivers run along the floor, the expansive courtyard contains numerous pools and wildlife, leading to open-air training rooms and various hallways. It also has a large dining hall, stables, a private receiving chamber, communal baths, and countless sleeping quarters.

   , they develop a variety of skill sets although emphasize unnervingly quiet movements. In addition to daily meditations and drills, most individuals participate in the daily run, a six mile round-trip run to the nearest oasis, hauling two buckets of water; scaling the sand dunes is notoriously difficult. Cleaning the rooms of the older assassins is part of the training for younger acolytes, in order to teach them responsibility and humility.
