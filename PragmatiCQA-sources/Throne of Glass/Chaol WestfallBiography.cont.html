   He and Celaena go out for dinner for his birthday. Celaena had meant the dinner to show how much she appreciated him, and she wanted him to feel cherished. Chaol even said no one had ever done something like this for him, and Celaena thought how long has it been since he had felt cherished. Celaena then tells him that she has not been killing the people the king had sent her to but helping them escape and change their identities. This leads to a discussion Chaol and her have in which she says that she plans to run away to a place where she can forget her life as an assassin and King's Champion. Chaol says that he will abandon his title as Captain and go with her.

   They both think about each other a lot in the days that follow, but an unexpected and unfortunate event leads to an enraged Celaena attacking him and getting locked up in a cell in the dungeons. Though the misunderstanding is cleared up later, Celaena tells him about her difficulty in trusting him again. Dorian takes a back seat for a while as he has become even more entangled with the court, and Chaol is more focused on Celaena. Even though he and Chaol remain friends, at the very end they break off their friendship due to Chaol’s involvement in the king’s decision to send Celaena to

When word spreads of Aelin Galathynius taking part in a battle against men sent by the King of Adarlan to

   's palace for an audience. Tasked with gaining Antica's support for the war against

   , Chaol pleads their case and attempts to flatter the Khagan with jewels provided by Aelin. The Khagan examines the treasure and dismisses it, and reveals to Chaol and Nesryn that Rifthold has been invaded and is under Valg rule. Chaol fears for Dorian, who has disappeared and cannot be located by the Khagan's spies, nor that of his five children. The Khagan also reveals that his youngest daughter is dead. Chaol realizes how callous his request for aid seems during the time of mourning, and apologizes.
  </p>
  <p key="c9fd1aa2-7736-4ddf-bc4b-074df8eefe17">
   The Khagan has Chaol and Nesryn shown to their rooms in the palace and arranges for a healer from the Torre Cesme to examine him the next day. True to his word, a gifted healer named

  <p key="f7ef2512-16ef-40e2-b184-9e88018d7022">
   Over the next few weeks, Yrene attempts to heal Chaol. At first, they have a hateful relationship, with Chaol not understanding that she hates him for his former position as Captain to the King of Adarlan's guard. Their relationship improves over time as they get to know each other.
  </p>
  <p key="e4cb83bb-ebf8-4879-a2d3-a013b85f2e84">
   Initially, Yrene is unable to help Chaol as she discovers a knot of black magic resting in the location of his injury that resists her healing magic and causes him excruciating pain when she attempts to touch it. The two spend hours trying to work past it, with each session leaving Yrene weak and exhausted and Chaol wiped out from the pain he has to endure. While they continue their sessions, Chaol is approached by one of the Princes,
   Kashin
   , who is in love with Yrene and frustrated by her rebuffs. Following a murder of one of the healers at the Torre, Chaol becomes concerned that the Valg have infiltrated Antica and are trying to kill Yrene for helping him. He and Kashin exchange information and Kashin enlists Chaol's help in searching for anyone with outward signs of Valg possession.

  <p key="be732b54-a46c-42ec-ab11-3023d21ed025">
   At one point, Chaol agrees to help teach Yrene's self-defense class. Having ordered a custom saddle built to allow him to ride, Yrene and the former captain ride to the Torre, and Yrene instructs her interns to help Chaol down from his horse. The ensuing situation angers Chaol greatly, as he is bitter about his helplessness and the way he is handled by the interns makes him feel like a toy. Despite his anger, he teaches the class.

   After many failed sessions Yrene makes a breakthrough when she pushes past the dark magic inside him and manages to move it further down his back, giving him the ability to move his toes. Further sessions allow him to move his ankles and feel his legs to some degree. Yrene shows Chaol the texts she used to learn about the Valg, and they learn that there are actually three Valg kings,

   During a party thrown by the Khagan's children where opiate smoke is pumped into the room, Yrene and Chaol share an intimate moment and almost kiss, though Chaol pulls away after remembering that Nesryn is present. Feeling guilty, he makes a point of asking after her family that night and listens to her talk all night. Yrene walks into his room at dawn for their session and mistakes Nesryn sleeping in his bed for a sign that they slept together. He rushes to explain the situation.
  </p>
  <p key="a0131a10-9f67-43c8-a2d2-fb26cb5a8f4e">
   Nesryn realises that Chaol doesn't love her and leaves with Prince
   Sartaq
   on a long journey to the
   rukhin
   nests, leaving Chaol a blunt note about not holding him to any promises. After reading the note Chaol becomes upset as he feels guilty and treats Yrene harshly, throwing her out of his room when she admonishes him for his behavior. To cope with his guilt he pushes his body to the limit with exercises.
  </p>
  <p key="8e39ea79-ef9f-4dc9-9a50-607dc0812d81">
   Yrene returns to his room later on to yell at him, and is followed by the Valg who murdered the healer at the Torre. She runs to Chaol's room and they barricade the door, with him keeping her calm as she panics. Kashin and his guards arrive and the Valg leaves, and Yrene chooses to stay with Chaol as he makes her feel safe.
  </p>
  <p key="2963cbb6-cc8d-43bc-b91a-fbfcc9bfda95">
