   Wyrdstone is a smooth, obsidian stony material. A strong magical conduit, it can cause headaches in those with magic in their blood.
   Jewelry made from it can lodge Valg; donning such an item allows the Valg to possess the wearer. The size of the jewelry seems to determine what rank of Valg can inhabit it. For example, a Wyrdstone ring can hold a lesser Valg, but only a collar is capable of containing a Valg prince. The
   Wyrdkeys
   themselves are also hewn from Wyrdstone because of its magical conductivity.

  <p key="39a3e5f5-4926-4cf5-8297-1d0716be7e9b">
   The rings were simple black items that allowed the possession of humans by lower-ranked Valg demons, whereas the collars, described as black torques, contained Valg Princes of considerable strength and power. Removal of the Wyrdstone items was enough to weaken the demon within a person and banish them, however possession by Valg Princes and Princesses required additional banishment by a healer.

Wyrdstone hearts were a mixture of Wyrdstone and iron, and were used in special cases to create stronger soldiers and assassins without using a Prince.
