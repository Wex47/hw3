   The city is protected by large, white walls and floored with cobblestone streets. The Avery River flows through Rifthold, with the harbor opening into the Great Ocean. The harbor contains warships, merchant vessels, and fishing boats. A large lower class occupies the slums, giving the city a constantly dirty and spoiled odor. It also contains a shopping district.

   One of the notable places in Rifthold is
   The Vaults
   , a subterranean pleasure hall in the slums. It is a place for dark dealings and other things that people want to keep from the king

   Another notable place in Rifthold is the Shadow Market. It has operated along the banks of the Avery for as long as Rifthold has existed, maybe even longer. Legend claims it was built on the bones of the god of truth so that it would keep the vendors and would-be thieves honest. It's a place where anyone can find anything. Contraband, illicit substances, spices, clothes, flesh: the market catered to any and all clientele, if they were brave or foolish or desperate enough to venture inside.
