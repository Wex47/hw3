  <p key="5aadac19-59ca-42db-a4fe-4cbb2a46aecb">
   Manon looks for Elide and rescues her from the dungeons. She knows there will be consequences for defying Vernon. Kaltain helps them escape. She blows up the mountain of Morath and sacrifices herself in the process. The Duke survived the blast and has new battle plans for the witches. Manon tells Elide on her own to head north.

   Aelin slipped Athril’s ring on Dorian’s finger as he stabbed her, enabling him to fight the demon. The demon uses Dorian’s power to send ice daggers at Aelin, but her power has returned. She counters with fire. They continue to fight. Aelin’s wound has healed. Dorian finally sees through his own eyes and sees Aelin.

   Rowan, Aedion, and Lorcan are trying to fight their way past the Valg. They think it’s hopeless, but then a ghost leopard appears. It is Lysandra in a new shapeshifter form now that magic is freed. She helps them fight their way out.
  </p>

   Aelin’s magic is building, and the demon inside Dorian begins fighting her again. The king shows up and says Chaol put up a good fight but is gone. Chaol’s death and the flashing ring on his hand bring Dorian fighting out of the demon’s hold. He snaps the collar from his neck. Aelin and Dorian fight together against the king. Aelin nears burnout. The two clasp hands, and their magic intertwines. They fracture the king’s power. When it is drained, they hear him speak in a foreign voice…his own. He says everything he did was to keep Dorian safe from Duke Perrington. When they were young, the two of them opened a crypt in Morath, and Erawan took over the Duke’s body. Erawan’s minion took the king’s body.

  <p key="cafab175-8b01-40ba-8795-bb378c8ae3da">
   The king says he sensed Dorian’s power as soon as he was born, so he built the towers to protect him. He suspects it didn’t work on Dorian because his blood was used in the spell. He asks Aelin to kill him for all he’s done. He tells them Chaol is injured but survived. She is glad she slipped the Eye of Elena in his pocket to protect him when he stayed back to fight the king.

   Dorian delivers the killing blow. The glass castle shatters at Dorian’s battle cry. The bridge they’re standing on explodes, and they fall. Aelin uses every last bit of power to prevent the glass from pummeling Rifthold. She feels wind (magic from Rowan) come up beneath her and give her a soft landing onto the grass. She passes out, and when she wakes up, Dorian is beside her. And beside him is Chaol.
  </p>
  <p key="39b68912-2109-43a7-ab42-cd7b94e34be3">
   Aelin moves to the edge of the castle grounds to tell the assembled people that their king is dead, but the prince lives. She says he is in mourning but will emerge as their leader soon. She makes threats to keep the city safe from looters until Dorian is ready to rule.
  </p>
  <p key="a29e6d35-4ee1-4909-94cf-db3a2b6e3315">
   Aelin, Dorian, and their companions hole up in the castle to rest and recover. Lorcan visits Rowan and says he knows Aedion’s father is Gavriel and says that the battle is far from over.
  </p>
  <p key="9037eb97-105f-4aae-b1a7-43753078b726">
   When Aelin awakes, she visits Dorian. He is struggling with the things he did while wearing the collar and the weight of his new responsibilities as king. Aelin says she will be there for him when he needs her. Their kingdoms will be allies.
  </p>
  <p key="5d9e1548-0221-41d8-b6ae-c79a790ed260">
   Dorian is beside Chaol’s bed when he wakes up. He is paralyzed. Dorian thinks he should go to the healers at the South Continent. Dorian names him the King’s Hand. Chaol and Nesryn talk about making the journey to the healers. Aelin appoints Chaol as Ambassador for Terrasen to the Southern Continent. She wants him to try to woo them to join with Terrasen and Adarlan while he’s there.
  </p>
  <p key="db3f0e45-e5c8-4393-916d-010aac19a955">
   Aelin, Rowan, Aedion, and Lysandra say their goodbyes and leave the castle to begin their journey. After three weeks, they set foot on Terrasen soil. And at long last, Aelin Ashryver Galathynius is home.
