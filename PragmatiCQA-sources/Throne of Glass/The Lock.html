   . They would be sent home through the broken
   Wyrdgate
   , and then the three wyrdkeys would be sealed shut in the gate - forever rendering the gate unable to open for armies, and to destroy worlds. The returning offer that stood between them was that they would take the Dark King Erawan, including his armies, and tear him apart in their home world. The cost of the Lock, though, was enormous. Mala was required to give up her mortal body and her life with her mate and children.
  </p>
  <p key="d08d04c0-946b-4439-8b01-39fa9bcc7eab">
   Rhiannon Crochan
   created the basis of the Lock: the symbol of the Three-Faced Goddess in an amulet - a warped metal with two overlapping circles, with a rendering of the goddess' "Heart of the Darkness" in the middle. Rhiannon crafted a witch mirror in the middle eye, which was capable of absorbing immense power. The amulet then had been called the Eye of the Goddess.
  </p>
  <p key="848ad358-f741-4418-8118-d15b72d257b0">
   With the help of Rhiannon Crochan, Mala cast her entire mortal being, her full Fire-Bringer gifts, and her whole essence into a small blue witch-mirror in the Eye of the Goddess. As a result, the witch-mirror glowed intensely with cobalt fire, ripe with Mala's power. Though she had given up her life to forge the Lock, Mala was still able to live on as a goddess.

  <p key="fa63f2ea-3258-4089-b7e6-efc1a74613a7">
   The Lock was only to be used once, its power capable of sealing anything the bearer of the amulet wished.
  </p>
  <p key="c6edd3ac-e3ad-49ab-98fc-0a9ce29141ba">
   Approximately ten years after Mala gave up her life for the Lock, Erawan's armies had nearly gotten full control of the continent. Brannon's fire magic was dimming, and he was said to be only decades from the Fading.
  </p>
  <p key="e2483d63-a0e7-4601-ae71-9a7edc3d95c0">
   In a desperate attempt to seal Erawan and stop the spread of his darkness and pain across the world, Elena Galathynius stole the Lock from her father and used it to seal Erawan in a tomb in Morath. The Lock crafted a dark sarcophagus from Morath's mountains, used to physically contain Erawan, effectively locking him after displaying green wyrdmarks across the sarcophagus. This act utilized every ember of Mala's mortal essence, leaving the witch-mirror dimming from its intense cobalt fire to a pale flicker of blue light. Elena thought she had saved Erilea from the Valg's threat forever. However, the Gods' and Goddesses' furious descent entailed that the Lock was promised to them, and she had just wasted it. She did not know the Lock's purpose or that her father bore the Wyrdkeys. Upon ruining the bargain between the Gods and Brannon, the Gods expressed their rage; however, Mala Fire-Bringer paused in her wrath as if trying to remember Elena.
  </p>
  <p key="6d9b7d6c-dff6-4297-80f5-de3e8a27c033">
   The Gods and Goddesses proposed that a new Lock would need to be forged by a scion of Mala blessed with her same Fire-Bringer gifts, who would have to give up their life to seal the Wyrdkeys into the Wyrdgate. They informed her that their original bargain still held: they would destroy Erawan in their homeworld. And so Elena was tasked to lead Aelin to find the Wyrdkeys, forge the Lock, and give up her life to seal the gate shut. And when Elena brought Aelin back to life after she died in the Florine river, she was given an additional punishment - she would never be able to access the Afterlife; she would merely disappear after Aelin completed her task and never see Gavin or her children again.
