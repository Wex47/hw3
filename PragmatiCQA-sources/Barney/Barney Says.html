The static appears again to change to the episode snapshots. After the narration of the episode's topic, Barney appears on-screen and says his closing line and the last snapshot of the episode cuts to purple static and then out to the front of the TV showing the credits (or in some cases, a purple construction paper background showing the URL to the Barney &amp; Friends website on PBS Kids airings) or the credits followed by the production company logo and the purple construction paper background showing the URL to the Barney &amp; Friends website).
