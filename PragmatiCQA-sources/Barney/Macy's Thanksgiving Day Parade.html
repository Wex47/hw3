    Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
   </b>
   is an annual parade held every Thanksgiving Day in New York City in the United States. Originally called the Macy's Christmas Parade, it was first held in 1924 and has been cancelled only twice due to rubber shortages during World War II. The two and a half mile parade features large balloons of well-known characters alongside floats and marching bands, ending with a float of Santa Claus upon his sleigh, marking the start of the Christmas season.

   tore its side on a lamppost. However, it was repaired for the next parade, and in
   1997
   (The year where most of the balloons were destroyed), due to very high winds, the Barney balloon let free from its balloon handlers, crashed into a nearby lamppost and had to be stabbed by the NYPC so it could stop flying. Due to the popularity of Barney and his movie,

   parade, and over the next 4 years, Barney flew without problems.

   In
   2003
   , a new Barney balloon debuted, featuring him with a trumpet and a bandleader hat. He led the parade that year (for some reason, the Barney Float was not near the balloon, and the balloon behind the Barney float that year was the Peanuts character Charlie Brown). In
   2005
   , Barney only appeared as a balloon, he almost flew away, and ended up getting his foot ripped apart by a lamp post. The balloon was retired after that parade.
