      Dubbed as the "blue dog" costume, and internally dubbed as B-001, this is Barney's first design, which is a far departure from later Barney designs. Resembling more of a tyrannosaurs-Rex, the body was made with reticulated foam and sprayed with a royal purple dye. Due to the fabric of the foam, it made the costume not pleasant to touch, which made it have the same feeling as sandpaper, as described by

      Internally dubbed as B-002, Barney gets drastically redesigned, with his eyes becoming larger and wider, his belly and legs becoming rounder, his color becoming a magenta purple, and his mouth becoming smaller. The Barney costume now has a new foam body and is fleeceless. His snout no longer flops. Also, this version tends to bobble and shake a lot more while talking. He now has his current number of spots (five spots on his back and three on his tail). His voice goes up a notch to make him sound friendlier than he did before.

      Internally dubbed as B-1, the costume is now made out of Antron fleece. The mouth mechanism is rare here, almost not present. Unlike the previous two suits, Barney no longer has a tongue. The pupils are also smaller. Barney's stomach has no foam base near the bottom, and his tail gets a little shorter. His feet are given a redesign and the top of his head is lifted even more. Barney's costume is now performed by

        This costume would undergo repairs for seasons one and two, including having a blinking mechanism. The bottom of Barney's stomach comes to a triangular point at the bottom, matching up with the seams at the top of the hips. The body also is rounder. In some episodes, his voice sounds similar to his dry BYG voice.

        In season two, the costume went through several tummy tucks &amp; even had his green belly replaced due to the green fabric was yellowing at the arm pits. The antron fleece used here is fuzzier. (Possibly not shaved as much as the last suit.) Barney's snout is also slightly shorter, and his feet are rounder. Barney's top tooth strip is taller. His voice sounds similar to his season one voice, but a little higher-pitched and sillier. This costume is very nimble.

      Internally dubbed as B-6, this was the first costume to have Barney's arms permanently attached. In this costume, Barney becomes smoother again and brighter. His jaw and his nuzzle are square-shaped as well as his teeth, especially with the bottom row becoming larger, and his body appears rounder. His tail gets a little less curly, making it a little shorter. The bottom of Barney's stomach also gets to a triangular point at the bottom again. The eyes appear much less sunken than the previous costumes, while the blinking mechcanism remains. The toes on the feet appear larger than the costumes used previously and also appear shiny.

      This version of the suit is a double of many to be used during this season. Barney's tail becomes less curly at the end than that of the costumes before it. Barney's eyes become bigger and pull closer together. He almost never blinks during this season. Barney's stomach becomes a bit rounder at the bottom. In addition, his feet become a lot less square, his toes come closer to the rubber soles, and his hips and the top of his head become rounder. Starting in Season 3 onward, Barney's voice gets even higher and more cheerful.

This costume was always used on the Barney Says segments from Seasons 4-6.

      Barney's eyes become a little downward. His toes are separated and his feet appear longer and much boxier than the costumes that preceded it. Barney's appearance gets smoother and more put together than the previous iteration and he gets a lighter shade of purple/magenta. His teeth get much taller and his mouth overall becomes rounder in comparison to the previous costume
