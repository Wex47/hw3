      This is the very first Baby Bop costume from 1991. She is taller than the kids at about 5'7'. Her mouth is not moveable, and the illusion of three-dimensional eyes was achieved by using flat materials for the whites and pupils and placing them behind clear plastic in the shape of hollow half-spheres. Her head and arms are separate from the body, and her arms are split further by a prominent seam in the middle. Her frill is also quite large. She was performed by

       In 1994, she gained darker magenta spots. Her nostrils also became bigger. The perfomer must lean her head down for the whole face to be visible, like the previous costume. This is also the first time

      Baby Bop grew ever smaller, and her eyelashes got curved up. In addition, her bottom lip became movable by the bobbing of the performer's head. Her eyes were made to be fully half-dome shaped, are pushed into her head more, and are moved closer to her forehead. Her nose was made shorter, but more portrudent than previous costumes.

      Baby Bop's eye lashes are shorter and are closer to the top of her eye. The springs in her mouth are slightly loosened, making her mouth much more movable. Her upper muzzle is also much smaller. Her tuft of hair not only appears behind her bow, but slightly in front of it as well. Her ears also become a brighter color and become smaller. Her nose also becomes more square. Her stomach, spots, bow, and slippers are given a lighter shade of magenta. This costume adheres to the shape of the new female actress,
