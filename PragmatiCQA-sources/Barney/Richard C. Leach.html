   Upon graduation Dick, at age nineteen, joined his father as a full-time employee in the family owned and operated printing business. In 1949, following the death of George Diederich, Joseph Leach became the sole owner of Argus Press and formed a partnership with Richard Leach. Two years later Joseph Leach moved his operations from Ravenswood Avenue to a small old converted dairy at 3505 N. Ashland Avenue in Chicago, from which he conducted business, maximizing his limited resources, a characteristic Dick would adopt for himself throughout his life. At that time Argus Press expanded its printing capabilities. During the 1950s Dick became the company's General Manager. He was responsible for sales and added many advertising agencies and publishers as clients of Argus Press. After ten years of experience in all aspects of the printing field, Dick was given full responsibility for the business.

   In 1962 Dick committed his experience and assets to foster the work of the Catholic Church. Dick, an avid follower of the events of Vatican Council II (1962-1965), recognized the need for better communication within the Catholic Church about the Council and its work. After discussing his vision for spreading the work and message of the Council with the president of Loyola University Press, Leach in 1964 launched his work of promoting Vatican Council II by partnering with the Archdiocese of Chicago and producing Study the Liturgy, a set of three audiotapes containing six lectures explaining the liturgical renewal initiated by the Council. Producing and distributing the tapes would eventually lead to other Leach-owned and funded publishing enterprises.

   In the mid-1970s government funding for special education led to the rapid growth of DLM, Inc., and it became the nation's largest publisher of special education materials. In 1983 DLM, Inc. acquired Teaching Resources, the second largest publisher of special education resources, from the New York Times. When the government began to emphasize the theme of "back to basics" in the early 1990s and was vigorously promoting the mainstreaming of children with special learning needs, Special Education publishing was seriously undermined. As a result Developmental Learning Materials was sold in 1992 to enable it through its new owners to continue developing quality products for special education educators and the children they served. DLM, Inc. was also the first to publish educational software during the advent of personal computers (PCs) in the 1980s.

   In 1980 Leach's businesses, which now also included a sales office and warehouse in the United Kingdom, reached a new level of growth and need for expansion. After searching the Chicago area for facilities that would accommodate the expansion proved futile, Leach moved his companies in 1981 from Niles, Illinois, to Allen, Texas; a city located about twenty miles north of Dallas. The goal of the relocation was the combining of all Leach's printing and publishing businesses, including printing, editorial, administrative, manufacturing, and warehousing operations, in one facility. To facilitate this expansion, Leach sold Argus Press and his operations in the United Kingdom to key employees.
