   A plausible reason why cell phones cannot be used to exit the Matrix involves a real-world technology used to prevent cell phone calls from being intercepted;
   encryption
   of the call so that only the caller and the answerer can hear the content of the call. It is possible that an exit must be on an unencrypted line, unlike a cell phone.

   Another plausible reason to require a hard line phone is that conventional telephones within the Matrix are wired into the infrastructure of the city (and, logically, the main communication algorithms of the Matrix proper). It appears (based on the scene in
