   Neo entered the guarded building holding Morpheus first. Neo entered the building's main floor security check-in holding a zipped-up duffel bag. He walked past the two standing guards and placed his bag on the conveyor belt for it to be scanned for any metal materials. Neo walked past the metal detector and as he did, the machine went off.
  </p>
  <p key="323ee8e2-3872-4048-984a-679a4233bd66">
   One of the security guards walked to Neo and ordered him to remove any metallic items he was carrying. Before the guard could finish his demand, Neo opened his coat and revealed that he had many different pistols and sub-machine guns attached to his body and belt by holsters and slings. The guard looked up at him cursing out of shock and before he could make a move, Neo attacked him with a palm strike.
  </p>
  <p key="594a4d24-b6a9-4992-add7-f4a3c79ec308">
   The attack's impact caused the guard to fly backwards away from Neo. Immediately after the guard flew back, Neo took out two MP5k sub-machine guns from and aimed them crisscross at the three guards, two on his left side and one on his right side. After the were shot and killed, one guard hid behind the nearby pillar for cover and to call in backup.
  </p>
  <p key="f21377bf-3549-43e4-ab69-237f6c250122">
   After his call for backup, Trinity entered the building. Wielding an Micro uzi sub-machine gun, she fired at the security guard until her weapon was out of ammunition. Trinity then picked up the duffel bag and she and Neo walked down the lobby towards the elevator.
  </p>
  <p key="7acc9cef-83f7-4780-8a7c-1160a29a748a">
   After taking a few steps down the lobby hallway, a unit of
   soldiers
   armed with M16 assault rifles and SPAS-12 shotguns entered the lobby from the side doors near the elevator and pointed their guns at Neo and Trinity and ordered them to stop. Neo and Trinity looked at one another and then ran to opposite sides of the lobby to begin a shootout.
  </p>
  <p key="8eaa010e-4253-4de8-844f-cbd19cc268bf">
   Neo ran to the left side of the lobby from the entrance and Trinity ran to the right. While Neo was running to the left side, he was wielding duel M9 pistols and was firing at the special forces team.
  </p>
  <p key="fe25a106-08e2-48fa-a1c9-676766c869bd">
   Neo eventually ran to the wall and retreated to the nearby pillar to take cover from the rain of fire from the tactical force team. While taking cover, Neo, after running out of ammunition for his M9 pistols, took out two Skorpion vz 61 submachine guns from his holsters and waited for the team to cease fire.
  </p>
  <p key="3372bfff-9672-475b-95fa-5aaa182c2628">
   While on the opposite side, Trinity was progressing to make it towards the elevator. While dodging the incoming fire, Trinity ran past pillars to advance. Two soldiers were in front of Trinity and began to fire their assault rifles at her. Trinity then started to run on the wall to dodge their bullets and flip-jumped off the wall and hid behind a pillar to wait for the men to reload their weapons.
  </p>
  <p key="bf052c96-0bb7-492f-a67e-b8d772ab60e2">
   One of the shooters stood next to Trinity's pillar and began to reload his weapon. Trinity then moved from the pillar and kicked the rifle away from Trinity's sight and immediately performed one front snap kick to the soldier's chest and a roundhouse kick to his neck, causing him to fall to the ground. The other soldier finished reloading his weapon and resumed fire at Trinity before she ran back to the pillar for cover.
  </p>
  <p key="a04cb14b-9cd5-4a82-b5f9-170a2f62e619">
   Back on Neo's side, Neo was still taking cover from the bullets that were hitting the pillar that Neo was hiding behind. After the bullets had stopped for a moment, Neo moved away from the pillar and charged towards the soldiers while firing his sub-machine guns. Neo killed two of the three soldiers that were in his way and Neo was still charging down the pathway.
  </p>
  <p key="5c674db0-f405-427a-927a-e0718f6f38e7">
   On Trinity's side, three soldiers noticed Neo's advancement and began to focus their fire on him. Realizing Neo has many shooters firing at him, Trinity moved away from her pillar and ran towards the nearest soldier firing at Neo with a SPAS 12 pump-action shotgun. Trinity ran beside him and performed a front snap kick on the weapon, causing it to flip behind the shooter for Trinity to take.
  </p>
  <p key="8b11421c-a2a7-40e8-8b83-d28bf5e5fb6b">
   As soon as Trinity got a hold of the weapon, she shot and killed the wielder of the shotgun and fired at another soldier shooting at Neo before taking cover once again at the nearby pillar to avoid the third shooter's fire.
  </p>
  <p key="9fb7669d-9e2c-4e22-9888-7761bc9ef8f2">
   While Neo was charging up the pathway, he managed to kill the last of the three shooters in his way. Two soldiers from Trinity's side and three soldiers in front of the elevator were all firing at Neo. Neo, after running out of ammunition for his sub-machine guns, charged towards the end of the left side pathway and performed a cartwheel to dodge the incoming fire and pick up one of the dead soldier's  M16 assault rifle from the floor.
  </p>
  <p key="a0b41c67-0bb5-4926-8eec-7ff434aecbf2">
   With the assault rifle, Neo performed another cartwheel and while upside down, he fired at the three soldiers using the assault rifle. After regaining his footing from the cartwheel, Neo hid behind a nearby pillar and pulled out two micro-uzis from his holsters and left the pillar to march towards the two shooters from Trinity's side.
  </p>
  <p key="5258a9e2-a1f7-4299-b189-1b39bb72a8fb">
   Neo managed to kill one of the shooters with his weapons before running out of ammunition. After realizing this, Neo, with a quick reaction, jumped towards the final shooter and performed a jumping roundhouse kick to the soldier's face, causing him to fall to the ground.
  </p>
  <p key="835b2b83-dd6c-418d-8d5f-35713e394c34">
   Neo and Trinity regrouped after all the soldiers were down. Trinity retrieved the duffel bag and she and Neo entered the elevator going up to the roof after viewing the now destroyed lobby. At this time, Agents Jones and Brown were aware that something was wrong and came to the conclusion that members of the resistance were coming. They then arrived back into the room where Smith was interrogating Morpheus and noticed he was missing his earpiece, causing them to realize he doesn't even realize what had happened aloud, causing Smith to put his earpiece on just in time to learn of the attack's aftermath.

   Once inside the elevator, Trinity unzipped the bag and it was revealed that a bomb was within it. Trinity took out the bomb and placed in within the elevator while Neo opened the ceiling hatch to get their zip line ready for escape. After Trinity set the bomb in place, Trinity held onto Neo to prepare herself for the outcome. Neo, recalling

The bomb's explosion was powerful enough to completely engulf the main lobby, cause a blackout in the suite that the Agents and Morpheus were holed up in, and activate the emergency sprinklers. As they were being pelted by sprinkler water, Smith bluntly ordered Jones to "locate and destroy [the intruders]."

   After arriving on the roof, one of the soldiers within the cockpit of a B-212 helicopter contacted the agents via radio and informed them that they are under attack.
  </p>
  <p key="e6a66c4f-09f1-489e-9542-3271c9c2eee0">
   During the fight on the roof of the building, Neo, while holding an M16 assault rifle to prevent it from the barrel being in front of Neo, was fighting two soldiers side-by-side. Neo attacked the soldier to his right with a knee strike with his left leg and with the same leg, Neo performed a side kick to the soldier on his left. Neo repeated this technique twice before the soldier on his left fell to the ground.
  </p>
  <p key="f769842d-f373-452b-8869-c88575796238">
   Behind Neo, Trinity was fighting one of the guards and eventually caused him to hit the floor. Another soldier appeared near Trinity and aimed his assault rifle at her. Neo defeated the other soldier beside him by grabbing his M16 assault rifle at striking him with it from the chin. Neo then turned around to shoot at the soldier behind Trinity, killing him. At the same time, the soldier near Neo was about to fire at him, but Trinity drew out her knife and threw it at the soldier, stabbing him in the head.

   However, Jones managed to graze Neo twice, once near his shoulder and another on his shin. Neo fell on his back and Jones approached him and pointed his weapon at Neo, declaring Neo was "only human" with contempt. Before he could kill him, Trinity approached Jones from his left side and shot Jones in the face while daring him to dodge, killing him temporarily. Trinity also admitted she was impressed with Neo's dodging Jones' attack, as until then no one was able to dodge bullets like an agent.

   After noticing the helicopter on the roof, Trinity called Tank and asked him to imprint a program on piloting at B-212 helicopter. After doing so, Trinity told Neo that it was time to go and resume the mission.

   While in the interrogation room, Smith and the other agents realized that the Resistance entered the Matrix to rescue Morpheus. But before any of them could act, the helicopter appeared outside the interrogation room window with Trinity as the pilot and Neo aiming the mounted minigun at the agents. Smith seeing this ended up coldly saying "no" in shock at this turn of events.
  </p>
  <p key="11b41b9b-6d67-448a-83cf-e94879fd9100">
   Before any of the agents could run, Neo opened fire at them, instantly killing Brown. Jones returned fire with his

   , but was eventually killed by Neo's minigun. Smith tried taking cover from the ground as he returned fire as well, but Neo managed to temporarily kill him as well.
  </p>
  <p key="aa0f7be7-a1d8-4dd0-a7d7-b6892d6d47e2">
   After all the agents were destroyed, Morpheus realized what was happening and regained consciousness. He then awoke and broke free from the chains that bind him and began to ran towards the helicopter outside the window. Meanwhile, outside the room the agents possessed the guards outside. Smith, after reappearing in the hall outside the interrogation room, began to shoot at the wall to have the bullets try to hit Morpheus.
  </p>
  <p key="a20f5035-d466-4652-8393-91b44204b679">
   Before Morpheus jumped out the window, one of Smith's bullets hit Morpheus just bellow the knee and caused Morpheus to perform an incomplete jump.
  </p>
  <p key="498a34c0-4d17-420a-86e5-b24f037b5679">
   Neo sees this and and quickly attaches himself to the rope that is chained to the interior of the helicopter and jumped off the mechanism to catch Morpheus. After catching Morpheus in midair, both of the men were hanging from the rope outside the helicopter. Trinity then started to pilot the helicopter towards a nearby rooftop of a building to let both of the men off safely.
  </p>
  <p key="ce14c094-f359-4ad4-b779-fd20a39480b1">
   After Morpheus let go from Neo, he landed on a building's rooftop and Neo landed on the roof as well while holding the rope. While in the main building, Smith began to fire at the helicopter, causing it to lose speed and altitude. After Neo landed, he saw Trinity was falling down due to the helicopter losing power.
  </p>
  <p key="48a97f71-89db-456a-9928-d5bd4a33c215">
   Within the helicopter, Trinity noticed that it was going to collide with the building. Trinity then held onto the chained rope with one hand and shot off the chain with her pistol in the other. As the chain detached from the helicopter, Trinity held onto the rope and swung out of the helicopter before it collided and exploded into the next building's window.
  </p>
  <p key="c3c9ddba-d1da-4d96-ad0e-1680eeb6f886">
   Neo then reeled Trinity up to the rooftop of the building and looked at each other and Morpheus as they became relieved that their captain was safe and the rescue mission was a success.
