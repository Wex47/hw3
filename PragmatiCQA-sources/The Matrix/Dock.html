   docked for recharging and repair. The Dock (and Zion itself) had a single entryway for her ships, which opened up to a long corridor filled with gun turrets and other weapons in the event of attack. When open, at least one
   APU
   was on guard while the defensive systems stood down as hovercraft entered or left the area.

   Standing in the center of the Dock was a large, cylindrical tower housing Zion's traffic control and defense headquarters. The tower was many hundreds of feet tall and had dozens of long bridges that branched out to the edges of the Dock, leading to Zion's living quarters, energy production machines, the Temple and the Council Chamber. The tower was also fortified with heavy gun turrets, used extensively during the
   Battle of Zion
   .

   During the Battle of Zion, the Dock was the primary assault area of the Machines' army of 250,000

   . Large drilling machines burrowed their way into the Dock through it's high ceiling, crashing to the lower levels, a successful strategy that enabled them to avoid Zion's tunnel defenses. The Sentinels swarmed in seconds later and quickly gained the upper hand in the battle. Finally, the Dock was temporarily saved when the

   , killing the Sentinels, but also frying the defense systems. It was quickly overrun by the second wave, but was liberated when the Machine Army left.
