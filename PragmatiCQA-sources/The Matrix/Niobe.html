   Due to the number of outcalls being made to all of the captains, Niobe suggests that they use the airport telephones within the Matrix so that the Machines cannot trace them. When they finish calling all of the captains, Niobe receives a call from
   Jax
   , the operator onboard the
   Vigilant
   , informing her that

    Captain Soren
   </a>
   and the rest of his crew went to find him but were cornered by Agents attempting to do so. Meanwhile, the other Agents are moving Axel to the tarmac and fears that, in the eventuality that the plane takes off, he will have to kill Axel. Niobe orders Ghost to help Soren with the Agents while she tries to find Axel.
  </p>
  <p key="88d4b459-595d-4144-b5b7-2eece7cea4c2">
   Sparks calls Niobe to tell her that Axel is being taken to the hangar by the Remote Terminal. When Niobe is in the tunnels of the airport, she encounters

   and successfully evades his pursuit. She continues to the hangar where she encounters
   S.W.A.T.
   guarding the plane. Niobe dispatches the S.W.A.T. and gives chase to the jet already moving out of the hangar.
  </p>
  <p key="d24fede5-cab8-451f-a973-b04104dabbea">
   She is unsuccessful in her attempt to catch the jet and heads back in the tunnel to try and intercept it. Niobe calls Ghost and tells him to shoot out the tires of the plane to buy her some time. While Ghost manages to shoot out the tires and stop the plane, Axel is already being moved to a police car and is driven away to another hangar before Niobe can catch them.

   She pursues them in another car, arrives at the hangar, and knockes out the S.W.A.T. at the door. However, even more S.W.A.T. are guarding Axel as he is being carried along and she engages them in a firefight. Unfortunately, she is again late to catch the next plane Axel is on and tries to catch up with him in another car. Meanwhile, Axel is being injected with some sort of drug on the plane. As Niobe drives toward the plane, Agent Johnson opens the hangar and tries to shoot her. She is able to drive on the ramp and into the plane, ramming the Agent into a wall. The large crate that falls on top of the Agent kills him. Before the car is thrown from the plane due to its momentum, she busts out the front mirror and latches onto the door of the hangar just before the car plummets to the ground below.

   Before she helps Axel, Niobe goes into the front of the plane to retrieve some parachutes. After freeing Axel and putting his parachute on, Agent Johnson throws Niobe to the wall and tries to close the hangar doors. Before they shut completely, Axel is able to escape. Niobe reopens the hangar doors and leads the Agent toward the edge, finally knocking Agent Johnson off of it. While parachuting down, Niobe calls Ghost to come pick her up when she lands. With no pilot, the plane crashes below her in the city.

   Axel is in the backseat of the car that Ghost obtained and the three of them drive to an exit. Before leaving the Matrix, Axel thanks them and promises to inform Soren that the meeting will be held at midnight. Just after Ghost leaves,

After Morpheus arrives, she tells them of the plan to return to Zion. Morpheus asks for a volunteer from one of the captains to remain at broadcast depth to await contact from the Oracle.

   The Keymaker is eventually caught by the Merovingian and reimprisoned.

   Niobe and Ghost meet the Keymaker again in his dungeon and he gives them a key that will get them out of the Chateau. The key leads them into a garage where
   the Twins

   Niobe and Ghost, each armed with a detonator, will try to reach the core of the power plant individually and destroy it. Inside the power plant, Niobe makes her way toward the core with assistance from Ghost, who helps snipe from above. They meet up just before a pit lined with pillars and filled with snipers perched on top of high ledges. Niobe tells Ghost that she'll draw them out along the path so that he can get a clear shot at them.

   The plan is successful and she continues to move deeper into the power plant. They meet up again on a catwalk. Sparks tells Ghost to plant his detonator in the augmented radioactive waste area and Niobe to head toward the Logistical Control center to unlock the area for Ghost. Once she accesses a control panel in the tower, Ghost is able to continue. Sparks tells her that her bomb should be placed in the generator room, which she also unlocks.

   Inside the generator room, Sparks tells Niobe to find a generator marked number one and place the detonator there. Once she places the bomb on the generator, she heads for the Core Control room, where Ghost is waiting for her. She hands him a grenade and calls Sparks for the next phase of the plan. Niobe informs Ghost that she will reach the top of the reactor while Ghost covers her and keeps the control room clear.

   When she reaches the top, Ghost will use the controls to open the core so that she is able to place her bomb inside the core casing. Then, Ghost will have to drag up the control rods while she evacuates the area.

   the Machine War

   When Niobe arrives at the doors of the room containing the core, Ghost opens them and she is able to set up the bomb. As she is leaving the power plant before the blast consumes it, Niobe runs into Agent Johnson, who opens fire. Avoiding his bullets, she throws a grenade his way and a grenade at her blocked path. She momentarily stuns Agent Johnson who pursues her through the hole that she made.

She says that Niobe will have to make a choice whether to help Neo or not. The Oracle also explains that Neo separated his mind from his body and is trapped in a place between Niobe's world and her own.
