    Agent Pace
   </b>
   was a female Agent who succeeded
   Agent Skinner
   as
   liaison
   for the Machines. Agent Pace was designed with this purpose in mind and, as such, spoke with as much emotion as she did on purpose. To enhance Pace's communication skills, she was programmed to utilize Italian in order to further humanize her, often referring to

   Following common Agent fashion, Pace's default attire is a slight variation on the male standard that accommodates her gender: a dark green business dress; a white button-up blouse underneath a dark green business blazer and mini-skirt over black stockings with black high heels. Accessories include a gold necklace, a white dove brooch, cell framed glasses (originally clear lenses but after her restoration the lenses became dark) and an ear piece like all Agents. Her hair is tied back into a bun with a large fringe sweeping to the left.

   Pace was often involved in field operations. She provided assistance to Machine operatives against
   Mammon
   , diplomatically handled the impasse of shared mainframe access between Machine and Zion systems, and was tasked with forging the Machines' alliance with the

   Ghost
   , acting as a symbol of strong Zion-Machine relations.

  <p key="d1d78f80-595c-4f56-a354-81ae0d2a50c1">
   It was during the crisis against

   The Merovingian

   . Although she survived the ordeal and returned to service as a liaison, her empathy programming was notably altered. As retaliation for assisting

  <p key="bf5b384a-6959-4a2c-8463-a2dba1dd9cc9">
   With the end of the Truce, Pace took up general Agent duties as well; locating and fighting Zion operatives who entered the

   as well as observing and maintaining
   Bluepills
   . As a liaison for the Machines, Pace became involved in handling the
   Intruder
   , eventually arranging talks between Halborn and Machine representatives and later opening talks with
   Carlyne
   , another Intruder. Agent Pace was also seen handling more mundane system administration tasks, such as handling bluepill crowd control and taking care of business issues with corporation alliances.

   Pace was the first Agent to encounter the

   Designed to be the first 'redpill friendly' Agent for Truce conditions, Pace was programmed to feel and understand human emotion while still carrying the calculating, businesslike persona of an Agent of the System. However, after suffering an attack from The Merovingian, her empathy changed and she took on a colder, Machine-like stance more associated with her kin. She is considerably more patient and understanding of human operative behaviors and, before the attack, was more than happy to provide a supportive role for her operatives. After the attack, she expressed chaffing in her supporting role and became more involved in front-line work.
  </p>
  <p key="1cd06df0-2a4d-4924-a454-3b549b2b0ae8">
   A notable trait is her tendency to use Italian words and phrases while speaking. Pace had an Italian accent, as well, in stark contrast to the rigid American accent of fellow Agents. This use of language and accent was designed to humanize her and make her more appealing to redpill operatives.
