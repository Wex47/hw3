    The graffiti could be a pictogram that encodes a simple program (rotate all point symmetric glyphs) which is used to encrypt

     and
    </i>
    decrypt a hidden message: The letters M, U and A show mirror symmetry. The numbers 2, 5 and 1 have no symmetry at all. Only Z and 9 are point symmetric. The peculiar "u-turn" swirl on Z implies a rotation of 180° around its center. The result is identical: Z. Do the same to 9 and you arrive at 6.

    It is arguably an allusion to Mosiah 25:16 (!) in the Book Mosiah, a part of the Book of Mormon, which pretty much sums up Smith's situation: "And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all those that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them."

    Another interpretation is that Muza in quite a few east european languages means "Music". By inference, you can get to the book of Psalms in the Old Testament ("Psalms" literally means 'Songs'). Psalms 25:19 reads: "Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred."
