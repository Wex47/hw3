   APU ammunition is reloaded by hand with the help of a special crane located on the back of each unit. To reload the cannons, a runner with a cart loaded with ammo will have to run out in the middle of the battle to jam the boxes of ammo into the APU. This is extremely dangerous for both the pilot and the runner, as the pilot cannot defend himself or the runner during the reload. To protect the exposed gunner and reloader, a small escort of infantry is send along with the reloader to provide protection, however, the job remains highly dangerous for all the people involved. After the reload process is finished, the ammunition will be loaded to the gun via a flexible belt feed. When the ammo has run out the pilot is trained to pack their gun into their holster, allowing the belt feed to reattach automatically once the ammunition becomes available.

   APU armor is ironically minimal, favoring speed and firepower over bulky protection. The reason being that in all likelihood armor would only mean a slower death for the pilot if machines disabled his APU, aside from Zion's limited industrial capacity. The armor originally used on APUs, as seen on the UN version, would do very little to defend against machines who've proven many times to be capable of cutting open or slicing quite quickly through the toughest armors Zion can produce. To some people, this separation of man and machine with a lacking cockpit is also symbolic of who is in control and who is not.

   The APUs used by humans during the first war were more "advanced" than those used in Zion, the cockpit was located in the center of the exoskeleton, in the "chest" of the APU and unlike the Zion model, this version was piloted when the operator placed his legs and arms in the exoskeleton joints, and not by means of controls, ensuring their grip, in addition to being secured by bolts grip that maintained it, making the pilot not lose control of the APU in case of strong impacts in the middle of the fighting, the hatch was equipped with a visor that provided the only possibility to the outside, although this was due to the sealed design of the Suit itself, it seems that the visor is adjusted to a predetermined height and it is not possible that they are not modifiable, which could indicate that the APU could only be operated by individuals or pilots of a certain height.

   Likewise, the suit was heavily armored, in addition to having incredible mobility in straight-line races, reaching extreme speeds, likewise, the APU weapons were directly connected to the exoskeleton arm, but unlike the Zion model, mobility was very limited. , more because the weapon was mottled together possibly with the ammunition, the weapon was mounted on one side of the arm, which ended in a kind of flat fist, but not as a weapon, like this in the later model of Zion, which made that the angle of fire was seriously limited, being more commonly accepted that the mobility problem was due to its objective of frontal lightning attacks and attacks of falling from the sky, not for combat against enemies by air (something that would play against them in subsequent years).

   Even with all this, the result was that the pilot could not take off the exoskeleton if the central hatch that covered the chest was torn off, in addition, the extremities, both arms and legs were effectively tied to the extremities, making the operator unable to escape. causing him to be trapped. This was a failure that the UN model had throughout the conflict, a weak point that would be constantly exploited by the machines, the

These propellants would later be used to a great extent in the withdrawals that human forces suffered during the war, when the APUs were about to be surrounded or cornered, they escaped using them, although this could end the fuel that in the long run. It would end up leaving the exoskeleton sold before the machines, because the collectors and sentries could surround these models and then destroy them. Even with this, the APU would be used in large quantities by human forces, although to a large extent they had become enormously ineffective against the machines, even more so when the enormous amount of these could immobilize them, more still the shortcomings that these models had shown were still launched against the legions of machines, which they simply destroyed by launching the sentries from the rear or from above.

   and Pyramid Towers of 01 when the war turned in favor of the machines, these models caused havoc before them, in addition, an enormous limitation that This APU model returned more inefficient was the little flexibility of the arms, which resulted in the pilot having very few chances against the fast sentries of 01, since being designed for the frontal attack and not defending against enemies that came by air (if it did not activate its thrusters), they could easily be attacked from behind by a sentry which would have the facility to shoot down the exoskeleton knowing that the arm of the same would not have a sufficient angle of fire to damage it, so these models Forerunners would have to go in pairs or triangles of fire to avoid attack from the rear.

   forces of the time were multifaceted; featuring enclosed cockpits, reinforced armor, some flight capability and a targeting system interface. A drawback to this design was it didn't seem to have as much arm movement as a Zion APU and appeared very restrictive in its shooting as the enclosed cockpit and targeting system limit its line of sight. The first APUs fought against

During this time, the APUs used by the UN were involved in crude and destructive combat against the machine armies of 01, during which time this APU model eventually became a mass production variant (such as that used in Zion centuries later), being distributed by the UN forces all over the planet.

   It was on the European continent where these APU units would be used, being used in the Ardennes where using their flight capabilities they made lightning attacks against the forces of 01, but only delaying the advance until the human forces withdrew from the continent thus leaving the fall. from Europe at the hands of the machines, the human forces would use these exoskeletons in the confrontations that took place in the United Kingdom, before the territory was completely conquered by the machines, the British and American forces together with the continental European remnants made a use Extensive of the APUs in the campaign, although eventually they would be defeated, the human forces would finally withdraw to Greenland where an enormous number (hundreds of thousands is theorized) of these units were used in the defense of the human fortress on the island.

   They were also used in the defense of the United States and Canada respectively, during the invasion of the west coast, more especially Utah, the American forces used these units extensively, having a poor success in the best of cases, despite the iron and steel industry. Desperately tough human resistance, during the decisive battle in Central America between the combined armies of the United States and the American countries where thousands of APUs were destroyed by the Machines, being seen in action for the last time during the fall of the human fortress in Greenland, where the armies that had managed to repel the forces of 01 would be destroyed (having lost their supply line when Canada was taken) thousands of these were used by the defenders, although with little success during this same battle.

    In the defense of the dock the pilots seem to operate in squads of three to four APUs back to back, allowing all arcs of fire to be covered. According to the artists working on the APUs, a cockpit would make practical sense but they decide that it would be a lot easier to identify characters such as Captain Mifune without one. The three man formation also enables faster response on 360 degree sign and survivability as the ammo recharging process can be guarded by the remaining APUs in the squad.
