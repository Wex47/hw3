   Exiles
   can seek shelter in a construct, but Agents have no such recourse. Those trapped in the system during the reset were literally turned inside out as their code was deconstructed and recompiled with a vicious error-checking routine.

   When dealing with humans, he uses many euphemisms, as he has found that humans often prefer not to say what they really mean. Death is "cessation of awareness." Stealing is "expeditious acquisition." He addresses humans by their gender title and bluepill last name (e.g. "Mister Anderson"), and seems to have a foolproof way of knowing this information about every human he speaks to.

   Though Gray resented his assignment greatly at first, he has come to appreciate the fact that he is better at dealing with humans than most other Machine Agents. Although he does not enjoy interacting with humans, the fact that he is efficient at it gives him a sense of pride.
