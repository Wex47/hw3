Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here, before you now, truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? No, I stand here without fear because I remember. I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me. I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines.

Tonight, let us send a message to that army. Tonight, let us shake this cave. Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel, and stone, let us be heard from red core to black sky.

   Morpheus took to the mount inside the temple and used the opportunity to tell Zion that the rumors of a machine attack were true, but that he was not afraid - because he recalled that the machines had sent their armies before, and Zion had survived. The speech was received well by Zion, and a rave ensued. After Morpheus left the mount, he was approached by Niobe, who recalled that Morpheus used to dance well. Morpheus answered by saying that some things never change, however before he could invite Niobe to dance, they were interrupted by Lock. After the Zion rave concluded, Morpheus bade Zion a good night.

   and headed for broadcast level so that Neo could meet with her. Following Neo's meeting with the Oracle, Morpheus realised Neo had been joined by somebody, recognising Smith's code on the monitors - despite Link saying that whoever it was didn't read like an Agent. Morpheus could only watch, not knowing what was happening to Neo as Smith attempted to assimilate him. Neo succeeded in stopping the assimilation, but fled the ensuing fight upon realising that he was vastly outnumbered. When he awoke in the real world, Neo confirmed to Morpheus that he had faced Smith, and that there was now a lot more of him. Neo stated that Smith had somehow found a way to copy himself. Morpheus questioned whether that was what Smith was doing to Neo, to which Neo stated that he didn't know what Smith was doing, but it felt like dying.

The meeting did not go as they had hoped: the Merovingian refused to give up the Keymaker and instead told them to return to the Oracle with a warning that her time was almost up. When Neo said that their meeting could have gone better, Morpheus stated that the meeting happened the way it had to, and the proof was that they left it alive. They were met by
