   Originally consisting of old run-down buildings, it is now degenerated into a den of vice, with a multitude of bars, seedy hotels, adult book stores and strip clubs. Any of the few citizens left in the neighborhood know better than to walk the street at nighttime. The local dominant gang is the all-female gang known as the
   Bells
   . The gang was originally a companion group to the more powerful
   Blackwoods
   gang, who live in the neighborhoods
   Mara
   and
   <a href="Magog.html" key="9791f3f4-9e35-47c0-bf4c-769bddab0c05" title="Magog">
    Magog
   </a>
   . Although the two gang's reactions are tenuous at best, the Bells would not hesitate to request for aid.
