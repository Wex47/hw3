         I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us, you're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end, I came here to tell how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries; a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

   software company. Aside from his professional life, Anderson worked as a hacker selling contraband programming, under the alias Neo, which became his common-use name after he was freed from the Matrix.
  </p>
  <p key="d39df705-628e-41a9-9bb2-08f2f94f2ae9">
   One night, while waiting for a client to pick up contraband software, Anderson was conducting an extensive online and periodical search for Morpheus when he fell asleep. A message interrupted the search, blanking out his screen: "The Matrix

   Not making sense of the message at first, Anderson tried to restore his computer to its normal operating mode. A final message read: "Knock Knock Neo". His client,

  </p>
  <p key="67ff5e9e-708b-4cae-afe0-1bffe347f172">
   Anderson made the transaction, taking two discs containing unrevealed programming from his secret stash, a hollowed-out copy of

   . Choi thanked Neo, saying, "Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ." This is one of many allusions to Neo's ultimate messianic destiny as The One that appears in the

   film trilogy. Apparently looking tired and lonely, Choi invited Neo along for a night of partying at a nearby club. Neo refused initially--until he spotted the tattoo of a white rabbit on Dujour's arm, as hinted by the message on his computer. Anderson decided to tag along.
  </p>
  <p key="7756ad04-1e9a-4d52-8cf6-8a8f3940e53e">
   At the club, Anderson met the mysterious message sender. She introduced herself as

   </a>
   , a name that Anderson recognized as a famous hacker that cracked the
   IRS D-base
   long ago. Surprised that the infamous wizard-class hacker was a woman, Trinity confirmed that most guys tend to think as Neo did. She confirmed his suspicions about the world, alluding to the

   , and adding more clues and confusion to his search for the truth.
  </p>
  <p key="ec1aaace-fff6-4bd3-bbfa-854cf1c51603">
   Anderson awoke the next day late for work.  He would receive a reprimand from his boss,

   </a>
   . The phone immediately rang. Answering it, Anderson found himself speaking to Morpheus, the man he'd been searching for. Without much formal introduction, Morpheus warned Anderson that the authorities were coming to arrest him, and offered his help to get him out of the building.
  </p>
  <p key="b068c5cd-bc60-4e81-952c-00c6b6b8c9ec">
   Anderson followed his advice and made it out of the building without being seen. However, as he was about ten stories off of the ground, he refused to negotiate a path which took him outside office walls. Fearing for his life, Anderson turned himself in.

He refused and demanded his phone call per the usual rights of the accused. Smith replied, "Tell me, Mr. Anderson... what good is a phone call... if you're unable to speak? " Anderson's mouth began to seal shut, blocking his screams of shock, outrage, and later pain as the Agents dropped a

Backed up by Trinity, Neo runs through the lobby, brandishing pistols, SMGs, and rifles to kill anyone who stands between them and Morpheus. They succeed in clearing the room and leave through the main elevator.

   Trinity sets a bomb and climbs on top of the elevator with Neo, who disconnects it and allows it to drop to the bottom floor, destroying the lobby and simultaneously turning on the emergency fire sprinklers.

   With help from Tank, Trinity appropriates a military helicopter and flies to the window where Morpheus is held. Neo clears the room of Agents with a Gatling gun on the chopper. Morpheus then regains his senses, frees himself from his handcuffs, and jumps out of the building, but a bullet wound to his leg caused by gunfire from a returning Smith causes him to stumble. Neo jumps out to catch his leader, now both hanging from a safety line, as Trinity moves the chopper away.

   Unfortunately, Smith damages the chopper, which begins to lose power rapidly. Trinity drops Neo and Morpheus on a rooftop but is forced to bail as the chopper flies into a nearby building. Neo senses Trinity's danger faster than anyone and grabs the safety line just as Trinity snaps the line away to swing away from the crashing chopper. Neo pulls her to safety, resulting in an awkwardly silent gaze between the two. Morpheus is convinced Neo is The One and asks Trinity for the same confirmation. The trio contact Tank, who directs them to a hardline nearby.

   They sat and Neo refused a drink offer, prompting The Merovingian to enter into a speech on time, wine, and cursing with the French language. During the conversation, the party discussed The Keymaker, why they came, and the essence of control. Morpheus stated "everything begins with choice", prompting The Merovingian to express his ideals on control: "Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without." Referring especially to Neo, the program pointed out a woman who was being served a slice of chocolate cake for dessert.

   Using his ability to see what others could not, Neo saw the dessert's code to be corrupted. The following reaction which took place inside her body's code exemplified The Merovingian's thesis on causality, leading the program to leave without helping the trio with their goal. They were led out of the restaurant feeling as if something didn't work. At the end of their elevator ride, Persephone appeared before them, asking them to follow her.

Choosing to run, the guard left the room, allowing Persephone to open the secret door behind the bookcase. The trio followed her into the secret hallway, where she pointed to The Keymaker's cell. Neo proceeded to open the door, therefore freeing The Keymaker.

Grabbing hold of Morpheus, Neo flew into the newly accessed room, with The Keymaker closing the door just in time. Turning around, Neo noticed The Keymaker had been shot several times. As the old program began to pass on, he gave Neo the key to the Source. As Morpheus took his leave, Neo inserted the key into the proper slot, opening the gateway to the Machine Mainframe.

   Upon realizing his choice, Neo confronts the three captains and asks for a ship. Roland is extremely against the idea of handing Neo a ship, while Niobe is solemn. Captain Niobe chooses to give Neo her ship, The Logos and justifies her choice as believing in Neo. Morpheus is astonished at her decision, and it seems Neo already knew that something like this might happen. The crew urges Neo to bring some weapons, some form of defense and try to reconvince him explaining the 01's abundant defense systems. Neo declines and Trinity tells him that she is coming along - and that he probably already knew she was coming along. Before the three captains leave aboard the Hammer; Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, and Link have a final farewell.

   Neo was stunned temporarily by the attack. He weakly tries to get up. Smith asks him why does he continue. Neo answers him, "Because I choose to." He manages to punch Smith through the crater. Smith suddenly emerges and punches him. Smith then remembers a vision and tries to fulfill it quoting The Oracle saying "Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.", this leads to Neo understanding that to balance the equation, neither of them can exist and thus he allows Smith to duplicate himself through Neo's chest.

   Smith asks the Neo/Smith clone "Is it over?" The new Smith clone nods confidently. Suddenly, the clone's eyes begin to shine with a bright white light and explode. As Smith starts to panic, repeating "NO, NO IT'S NOT FAIR!" over and over again, the rest of the Smiths begin glowing and disintegrate.
  </p>
  <p key="b0db9bd1-259e-42d8-9b80-bbfcbb47d8bd">
   When Smith says, "Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo", The Oracle speaks through Smith. The Oracle allowed Smith to assimilate her because she knew when the time was right, she would have to tell Neo this, so he would know that he has to sacrifice himself.
  </p>
  <p key="7f30c3e0-cd90-4f5c-84b5-381e252df2f1">
   Also, the reason why Smith is deleted is because just before he assimilates Neo, Neo makes the decision to be deleted, and Smith doesn't know that Neo's jacked into the Machine City, so when Smith takes Neo over, he gains the decision of wanting to be deleted. He cannot "change his mind" because the Machines know of Neo's decision to be deleted as soon as he chooses, thus tricking Smith.
  </p>
  <p key="b07eb49c-adac-45b6-a409-a795a05555eb">
   Some theories suggest Neo's decision to sacrifice himself was possibly due to The Oracle's cookies, the belief that The Oracle put codes into the cookies to determine Neo's decision when the time is right, as it was proven that data can be transferred through food when Neo sees The Merovingian's cake at the restaurant. It is also possible that Smith's deletion was due to the fact that he had completed his objective, defeating Neo was his purpose, and his base programming allowed him to exist until that objective had been completed.
  </p>
  <p key="1ecaff3d-24d0-49a5-9e8d-d52430633192">
   Another theory about Smith's ultimate demise originates during Neo and Smith's conversation at the park before engaging in the

   " This was in reference to the actions of his defeat as an Agent when Neo, realizing he was The One, leapt into Smith and destroyed him from within.
  </p>
  <p key="6193d890-0f87-4dd0-927f-41138d8c87a9">
   Though he says it's irrelevant at that point, Smith's theory to their connectivity could be grouped with the "fulfilled program purpose" and "balanced equation" theories quite soundly. After his ties to being an Agent were destroyed, his program attached to Neo's existence, hardwired even. By assimilating Neo and erasing him, Smith essentially erased their shared code (severing their connection) and defeated himself by a self-inflicted act of erasure. Smith simply could not exist without Neo existing.

The Machines' human power supply remained intact, and they called off their genocidal attack on Zion as per Deus Ex Machina's truce with Neo, which in turn led to an uneasy peace between the Machines and Zion. Neo's body was taken away by the Machines to the Machine City, leaving his fate unknown, but he is rumored to be alive in the

   . The machines analyzed his source code in an effort to discover what made him tick, finding that he and Trinity held no particular value individually, but discovered that when bonded together they were dangerous. During the rebuilding process, Neo and Trinity managed to blow up the machines attending to them in their brief moments of lucidity.

  <p key="b31d4dfd-f3f3-430a-9b46-78dbb252eb1d">
   The Analyst placed Neo and Trinity in the Anomaleum, suppressed their memories, and reinserted them both into the Matrix as a means of controlling the rest of the bluepilled humans, exploiting their unconscious bond to keep the others docile and unwilling to escape. Neo was given his Thomas Anderson persona, this time with memories of a videogame designer of an award-winning game trilogy called The Matrix, while Trinity was given a false life of a wife and mother named "Tiffany". They were placed in each other's social orbit, close enough to frequent the same coffee shop but not for anything closer as mandated by the Analyst.

   Inside the Matrix, Neo was seeing the Analyst to discuss feelings he had been having. As Thomas Anderson, he had a psychotic break, had trouble distinguishing his video game Matrix from reality, and attempted to walk off a high rise building ledge during a work-related publicity event. He was given medication called Ontolofloxin to keep his mind from being opened up as it had been in years past.

   s source code known as the Prime Program. This gives him the ability to freely manipulate the simulated reality of
   <i key="4ea37f8a-4b4d-47da-8f4d-412a43dffd0a">
    The Matrix
   </i>
   , similar to the authority a system administrator has over a given system. He manifests these abilities as various superhuman powers.
  </p>
  <p key="cf78bec7-ef27-4fc4-b19a-e4cc9d7541f2">

   through will alone. By focusing this ability upon himself he can fly at amazing speeds and jump great distances. Whilst his speed is never specified, he flies from The Merovingian's mountain manor to the highway "500 miles due south" in a very short time.
  </p>
  <p key="b9daf212-05be-4d83-bb4a-866a37bb4702">
   His high-speed flight is further exemplified by his ability to escape explosions, and the sonic boom left in his wake has the power to overturn and two rows of heavy vehicles and debris. His sonic boom almost destroyed a city block while catching Trinity. He has used this ability multiple times to stop several bullets in mid-flight, first against the Agents and then again against The Merovingian's henchmen.

  <p key="ecc1618b-d7ed-4d2c-b320-e3f284426809">
   Further, Neo possesses superhuman strength and agility and is invulnerable to many attacks. His reflexes are great enough to dodge bullets. Although he could block a sword with the edge of his hand, he received a small cut, indicating (as The Merovingian pointed out) that he was still human, despite his powers. His endurance is also finite: when confronted by masses of Smith clones, Neo was forced to escape rather than continue fighting, and upon exiting

   In addition, Neo (like most redpills) utilizes the Resistance's combat programs, which grant combat abilities equivalent to a martial artist with decades of experience. Neo is able to run an unprecedented number of these programs simultaneously; he is therefore a master of every known martial art and fighting styles, including Kung Fu and Kempo styles, Jujitsu, Karate, Eskrima, Drunken Boxing, and Taekwondo (the

While fighting the Merovingian's Exiles, a resurrected Neo discovers that he still retains these implanted martial arts abilities, commenting that "I still know Kung Fu" during the fight. In training for the series, Keanu Reeves' fighting arsenal, as well as the entire cast's, emphasizes Wushu.

   </i>
   . It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from". Apparently, because of his status as The One, he has a direct connection to the Source, and can, therefore, affect everything connected to it. After he is blinded in the fight against Smith/Bane, Neo begins to perceive everything connected to the Source, including the Machine City itself, as silhouettes of golden light.

   , his aging process is significantly diminished. Despite 60 years passing since his demise, has has displayed only very minor changes and his physical health remains at its peak. During the rediscovery of his true nature, Neo's powers slowly returned to him over time, although he initally lacked the ability to use them all, such as failing to achieve flight when he tried it. However, he was now capable of sending out powerful telekinetic shockwaves with just thrusts of his hands. While he could still stop bullets, his telekinesis in that area appeared to be weaker with it taking Neo more effort than before. By the time that Neo and Trinity confront the Analyst again, Neo's powers appear to have fully returned, including his ability to fly on his own, as he is seen flying alongside Trinity across the sky.
