And though initially believing the Machines to be benevolent carers of humanity, and feeling specially superior because of this misunderstanding, she would later understand through another vision that the Machines were, in fact, closer to the role of caretakers.

   Inspired by the vision, she became an artist of nightmarish sculptures that captured the likeness of the Somnicultos. Her work became controversial and she had many exhibitions which scared off the viewers, her sculptures being both familiar yet uncanny, giving viewers sleepless nights or nightmares, and eventually gaining her fame and fortune.

  <p key="1518ba09-01d7-4dae-9fb9-91986cbc1559">
   During an interview at
   Hednet Gallery
   , in one of her exhibits, she expressed how she did not care that her work scared her audience as she was simply an artist. Is fact, she welcomed the raw reactions as they were sure to promote her work. She also expressed how she wanted to capture how beautiful and caring the somnicultos appeared to her after getting asked about her inspiration by one of the women from the audience. But when that woman also worried about the uncanny fear her work instilled into people, Raven got annoyed and regarded the woman ignorant.

   , somewhat out of place, curiously looking at her exhibit. Asking him what he thought about her exhibit, the sculptures, as if given life, just started to move and ravaged everything around them. With everyone around her getting killed by the Somnicultos, she ran off, terrified, into the streets.

   The destruction soon followed her as the Machines spilled out into the city. Near her, a phone booth suddenly rung. She picked up, not knowing what else to do, when a sentinel destroyed the booth and sent her hurtling to the ground. Yet still, she continued to hear a cryptic message from the disconnected phone warning her that she lacked understanding of her beliefs. Confused, she asked back what it was she was supposed to understand when the broken walls before her opened up a path to an endless graveyard.

   She closed her eyes, understanding what this meant, and realizing that the Machines were more akin to "caretakers" of sleeping graves more than anything else. When next she opened her eyes, she was back at her exhibit, feeling foolish and sorry. Asked by the woman from her audience if she was alright, Raven admitted she was not, and apologized for her actions.
