   In the old system, the Machines used a relatively small number of super-powered Agent programs, who could "body hop" between the shell of any bluepill human already plugged into the Matrix - making them simultaneously "no one, and everyone". Killing an Agent only killed the current body it was overriding, causing the body to revert to normal while the Agent downloaded again into a new one nearby. There were still a few drawbacks to using Agents, however: while they could

    potentially
   </i>
   turn into any bluepill, they couldn't be everywhere at the same time, and their super-powered abilities made them somewhat conspicuous (even in their token guise as some sort of high-ranking government secret agents).

   society, thus making it more easy to control (with iPhones, social media, etc.). Embodying this shift in staregy, Bots are camouflaged as normal bluepill humans in the Matrix, living alongside the coppertop humans. There are so many thousands of disguised Bots in the new Matrix that there are essentially always a few in most public places (and even private places such as individual businesses), making it all the more easy to spy on the real humans in the simulation. Some Bots, called

   Seraph
   was a former Seraphim who not only survived as an Exile, but eventually sided with the Oracle against the system. The Bots are, in effect, a continuation of this trend: individually weaker Programs who can fit in better with humans, to draw less attention to themselves until force is needed.

  <p key="4da42875-1fe9-4b6b-a080-e29235b8b1ad">
   According to the Analyst, Bots are not only less conspicuous than Agents, but simply cheaper: he says that "cloning Agents over a coppertop" isn't as effective as just "saturating a population" with Bots interspersed everywhere. Apparently having Agents body-hop between different coppertop humans (who are themselves an energy source) simply wasn't as energy efficient.

   Bots operate on the strategy of permeating the new Matrix with thousands of disguised bots to spy on the humans within it. If a genuine threat appears such as members of the Resistance, all of the dormant Bots in a large area can be activated - switching to "Swarm mode" - instantly transforming into a literal army at a moment's notice, attacking in waves like a zombie horde. Activated Bots' eyes turn black, and fill with glowing green

   Bots operate on a more "quantity over quality" strategy than Agents did, and camouflage over raw power, resulting in several trade-offs. Individually they aren't as fast or powerful as Agents, nor are they as well-armed (they can't just carry around guns all the time in their fake lives), but they make up for this with numbers and the ability to hide in plain sight. Military and police Bots do carry guns, but they are less common.
  </p>
  <p key="4a82dafd-c48c-4b13-b60d-ffb4951db95a">
   Another distinction is that Bots cannot body-hop the way that Agents did: they actually do have their own scripted lives, which they act out all the time, instead of shifting to other people. As a result, when Bots die they die permanently, and their bodies simply dissolve into Matrix code (in contrast, bluepills who die in the Matrix, including those possessed by Agents, will leave a corpse behind when they die). It's possible that this was intended as a safety feature after Agent Smith went rogue and modified his body-hopping ability to start

   himself like a virus. Even the revived Agent Smith discovers that, while he can still body-hop, he can no longer copy himself like a virus - further indication that the reformatted Matrix as a whole has been reprogrammed to remove this ability.
