   Once a thriving home to billions of lifeforms, Earth has become a barren wasteland which lacks vegetation. It has become inhospitable for human habitation after decades of ongoing warfare around the early 22nd century.

   Earth formed by accretion, when excess matter from its parent stars' genesis began clumping together into planets and moons. Its basalt crust cooled soon after its formation and collision with the protoplanet Theia. Its gasses appeared via outgassing, where volcanoes produce volatile gasses such as oxygen and nitrogen.

   Its extensive bodies of water were produced from comets and other water-rich bodies crashing down on its surface. Life first appeared by abiogenesis, when the chemicals necessary for life began to fuse together and under the right conditions it turned into the first self-replicating molecule.

   Life has proliferated over billions of years, until the sky darkening operation in attempt to block the energy source of the Machines. Eventually almost all life became extinct, resulting in a mass extinction bigger than the one that occurred during the Permian.

   Though it seems some plants and animals survived, as plants like trees, grass and shrubs are shown growing on the surface in The Miller's Tale, despite the scorched sky. Perhaps the clouds thickness isn't uniform and in some regions, the shroud is thin enough to allow photosynthesis to take place. Alternately these plants could have evolved to conduct photosynthesis at very low light levels or photosynthesize with different wavelengths of light that humans can't see.
