   with his two friends. While the two friends thought of it as a terrific movie, Johnny says he did not get any of the movie. Amazed by his admission, the three go into
   the Tin Hat Tavern

   tries to explain the basic gist of the movie while the other friend tells James not to bother. But, asking too many questions, the two friends shortly give up on explaining the rest of the movie to Johnny. Johnny starts to leave while the two friends continue to assure him that plenty of others surely would not have also understood the movie.
