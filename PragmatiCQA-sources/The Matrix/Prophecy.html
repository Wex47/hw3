   Actually, the Prophecy is an invention of the machines, told to Zion operatives by the Oracle; the Prophecy is designed to manipulate the humans into leading The One to meet the
   Architect
   and not the Source itself. The One learns the truth and is forced into
   reloading
   the Matrix under the consequence that the Matrix will crash and all of humanity will die if The One does not comply.

   Neo, once enlightened and manifest in his powers as The One, finds himself confused as to what to do to save humanity six months after his transformation. The Oracle points him to find The
   Keymaker
   , a program that will help him locate the Source. While Neo successfully enters the door to the Source, he meets the
   Architect
   . The Architect explains that the Prophecy was a control to direct The One into saving a portion of humanity to rebuild

   , changes the equation and stops the cycle. He defies the Architect and returns to the Matrix to save Trinity from death. When this event happened, Neo initially believes the Prophecy to be false until the Oracle later sets him again to meet the Source--not the Architect, as before, but The Source located in the
   Machine City
   . When Neo barters a peace with the
