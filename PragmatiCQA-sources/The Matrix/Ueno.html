    Ueno
   </b>
   was a neighborhood in the
   International District
   . It was located on the left side of international and was next to
   Murasaki
   . The residing
   exile
   contact was
   Mr. Bishop
   , while the residing gang were the
   Shurikens
   , who are led by
   Jiang
   .
   The Shurikens
   were highly protective of this neighborhood. If anyone were seeking something that is not native to the city, Ueno is the place to go. It was also the home of some of the largest importing companies, including the Chotte Brothers Imports.
