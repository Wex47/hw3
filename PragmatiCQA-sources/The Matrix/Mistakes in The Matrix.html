   When Neo is on the window ledge hiding from Agent Smith, the traffic below him appears to be going the wrong way down the road below, as the arrows marking the direction of traffic on the road are pointing in the wrong direction. The film was made in Australia which drives on the left, so the filmmakers reversed the direction of traffic in the film to make it appear like it was in the US, but left the arrows in the clip.

When messages begin appearing on his screen, he tries to stop them by hitting various keys, but the close-up of the keys show keys from a standard keyboard that are clearly not the keys on a Natural Keyboard Pro.

   : The physical effect of Neo's lifetime in a pod are understated, as his body would be much more severely atrophied from use. However with this error in place, he would not be as helpless as a "newborn baby". The physiology required to walk, comprehend vision and sound, control bowel movements, speak etc. is well-developed by birth, with the later development taking place in the brain as the child matures. Therefore it's a reasonable (if speculative) suggestion by the movie that these mental abilities would be retained by someone who first learned to do them in a "simulation" hooked into his brain, even if he had not made use of them. Note particularly that even intravenously-fed individuals have to defecate and urinate, which given that Neo doesn't have any "plugs" for a colostomy or catheter means these functions of his body would have had plenty of practice.

The useful energy extracted from the humans would necessarily be equal to or less than the energy expended in keeping them alive, even before we consider the energy expended in running the Matrix. An alternative is provided in the novelization and the spin-off short story "Goliath": the machines use human brains as computer components, to run "sentient programs" (the Agents and various characters in the sequels) and to solve scientific problems. Fans continue to debate the discrepancy, but there is no official explanation.

   : Cypher discusses handing over Morpheus with Agent Smith at a restaurant in the Matrix. However, it's taken for granted someone would have had to jack him into the Matrix and back out of the Matrix. He or she would have also known that Cypher was conversing with an Agent by reading the Matrix code. Cypher's betrayal would have become known. Although the movie doesn't make it clear, Cypher was able to set up the system to jack himself in and leave again automatically. This is what he's doing when he's interrupted by Neo, which is why he shuts off the monitors immediately.

   :Smith shoots Neo at room 303, his Desert Eagle fires about 12 or 13 shots. In reality his model of the Desert Eagle, .50, only carries 7 rounds. While this could be explained by the fact that the Agents can do whatever they want, Smith's Desert Eagle goes empty in the subway, disproving that they have an infinite number of rounds.

   :During the chase scene at the end of the movie, Neo steals a phone from a man in a black suit. As he runs off, the man starts shouting and pointing at him. When we see the man from behind, although he's still shouting in the same voice, the actor is clearly Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, with his gray suit and different hair cut. The sound effect to indicate the transformation into Agent Smith isn't played until quite a few seconds after the change of actor and costume.

   Continuity mistake: In the beginning of the movie when Neo gets the FedEx envelope, he is shown at his desk opening the envelope and then pouring it out. As he is pouring the phone out, with the green packing label on the top, the shot cuts "seamlessly" to a close up of the phonebeing poured out the rest of the way. However, the envelope is now flipped over. The FedEx logo is now on top (the packing label is facing down).
