   The Analyst was created to understand human psychology in order to control them better - in some ways, making him a new attempt by

   . However, while the Oracle's better understanding of humanity led her to side with them, the Analyst did the opposite: he came to see the Architect's mathematical control of humanity to be incompetent. The Analyst later said derisively that the Matrix as designed by the Architect was "all fussy facts and equations" because he loved precision, and hated the human mind. Instead of trying to

   <i key="1fa9103b-5208-4a6c-8f15-53cd65d2f075">
    with
   </i>
   it. According to the Analyst, the Architect never realized that humans don't care about facts, but rather about fiction: all that matters is the world within their own mind, and humans generally believe what they
   <i key="7a12a27a-e572-4d28-849b-1fdbb461de1c">

   </i>
   to believe.

   the Anomaly, they merely redirected it in each Matrix cycle, but even they did not perfectly understand it. The Analyst soon discovered that Neo's powers as "the One" were linked to

   </a>
   , that the Anomaly was activated by the bond between them. Therefore he recovered Trinity's corpse as well, then convinced his superiors to expend considerably energy and effort into repairing and resurrecting them, to further his research. While the Analyst never fully understood the Anomaly, he gained much more knowledge about it, and realized that through Neo's low-level link to all of the other humans plugged into the simulation, he could actually

  <p key="20bc95b7-4df5-4b9e-9bc8-9507f054a381">
   The Analyst became increasingly disillusioned with the Architect's mathematical precision over the years, concluding from his research that "feelings are easier to manipulate than facts", which culminated almost sixty years after the
   Battle of Zion
   , when he seized power from the Architect himself. He then radically redesigned the Matrix, now

   the human capacity for self-delusion, i.e. updating the internal setting from around 1999 to around 2020, imitating the social media, iPhones, and corporate-produced entertainment franchises of the original early 21st century - in effect, re-creating the complacent human society that allowed the

   to happen in the first place. While there was some risk that this updated Matrix setting gave people a better understanding of the risks posed by early Artificial Intelligence, the Analyst again smoothed this over by feeding them pop culture entertainment franchises

  <p key="a3a73e31-1dcc-4b0d-bb17-04ee27940ecb">
   The Analyst does mention that he is not, strictly speaking, the leader of his faction - he is the new ruler of the Matrix, much as the Architect was (who he calls his "predecessor"), but even the Architect wasn't exactly the leader of the entire Machine civilization in the real world. The Analyst vaguely mentions having superiors - who he flippantly calls "the suits" or "the authorities" - and that he had to convince them to continue his gambit with Neo in the Matrix. Given that the Analyst's new Matrix generates much more power than before, however, and the Machines were beginning to war between themselves due to an energy shortage, he holds considerable leverage with the Machine leadership in the real world (for example, convincing at least his own faction to accept his overthrow of the Architect).

   Unlike the stiff and mathematical Architect, the Analyst is somewhat of a dark counterpart to the Oracle. Both were Programs designed to better understand human psychology, and thus both have somewhat playful personalities, cracking jokes and manipulating others. While the Oracle was generally benevolent and tried to

  <p key="5a118e1a-229f-4564-892c-b2ab7d98cbe6">
   The Analyst is egotistical and cocky: he derisively refers to humans as sheep who do what they're told, and who fundamentally

    want
   </i>
   to be controlled by the Matrix - but he genuinely believes this, and within that framework wants to make the Matrix as pleasing of a fantasy as possible. While the Architect saw himself as taming unruly humans against their will, the Analyst in his own way feels he's just giving humanity the self-delusions it's always wanted. While he is not completely sadistic and at times displays genuine honesty, when it suits his own interests he is fully willing to outright lie to his enemies and break his promises - which is considered very shocking behavior for a Program (comparatively, the Architect was blunt and unyielding, but he was always honest and true to his word).
