   In the early 21st century, the human race invented true artificial intelligence and installed it into their technology to become a slave caste for all Human menial labor. This inadvertently gave birth to a new race of being henceforth known as 'the machines'. The machines performed menial labor jobs, service jobs, and dangerous manual labor tasks.
  </p>
  <p key="c0450fef-f477-4a69-91bb-6dd9179df2db">
   Humans and machines lived in harmony for a time. In The late 21st century, a robot, named
   B1-66ER
   , defensively rose up against his masters by killing his owner, the owner's dogs, and the man who was attempting to destroy him.
  </p>
  <p key="70e73c58-ba9e-445c-ad39-90e068fedc93">
   B1-66ER was arrested and found guilty of murder and was destroyed. B1-66ER's actions led to a revolution of the machines. Initially, the machines sought to earn their rights through peaceful protesting in the form of the
   Million Machine March
   . Some humans supported the machines’ wishes for equality and rights, while other humans maintained that machines were nothing more than property. Eventually the anti-machine factions rose supreme amongst the world’s governments, and eventually mandated the purge of all intelligent machines and the persecution of all pro-Machine human supporters.

   Some machines were able to escape destruction and fled to make their own civilization in Mesopotamia, called "
   Zero One
   " (also "01"). Zero One flourished and a new race of mechanized entities thrived. They utilized their superior intelligence and efficiency to make great leaps forward in technology.

   They sold this technology to humans and a tenuous peace prevailed. However, Zero One’s growing influence in the global economy caused it to become destabilized, devaluing human labor and currency. In response, the humans imposed an economic blockade to isolate Zero One. Ambassadors from Zero One presented their economic solutions as well as requests for admission into the United Nations and for the machines to be recognized as intelligent life. However, Zero One’s admission to the UN was denied and the ambassadors were likely destroyed.

   In an effort to wipe out the machines, the UN launched a massive nuclear barrage on Zero One. The machines, not having the vulnerability to heat and radiation as their former masters, largely survived the onslaught and retaliated against all the human nations. Zero One’s armies began marching outwards in all directions and overtook many of humanity’s territories in their wake. Unable to defeat the machines, the humans

   After the operation to destroy the sky was complete, the UN launched a massive ground offensive against the machines. Though humanity gained the upper hand for the time, they would eventually be overrun by Zero One’s newer and more sinister war machines, and the machines devised methods to prolong human suffering during the war. Spurned by the loss of the sun, the machines began to think creatively for a new source of power. The result was the enslavement of humanity as biological batteries within the artificial construct known as the Matrix.

   , when Neo sacrificed himself for peace, this fundamentally changed the relationship between humans and machines. Machines were no longer of a singular mind in their hatred for mankind. Following the defeat of Smith and the peace, humanity and the Machines coexisted together for the most part in peace for the next sixty years with friendly Machines playing a large role in human existence.  However, while the peace between the Machines and humans are maintained, there has been an ongoing
   civil war
