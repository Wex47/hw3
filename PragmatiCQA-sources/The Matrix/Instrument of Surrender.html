         INSTRUMENT OF SURRENDER
         WE, acting by command of and in behalf of the United Nations of the Human Race,
         hereby accept the provisions set forth in the declaration issued by the heads of the
         Government of 01, hereafter also referred to as the Machine Powers.
         We hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the Machine Powers, of the Human
         General Headquarters and of all Human armed forces and all armed forces under Human
         control wherever situated.
         We hereby command all Human forces wherever situated, and for all Humans in general,
         to cease hostilities forthwith, to preserve and save from damage all ships, aircraft, and
         military and civil property and to comply with all requirements which may be imposed by
         the Supreme Commander for the Machines or by agencies of the human race in this
         direction.
         We hereby command the Human General Headquarters to issue at once orders to the
         Commanders of all Human forces and all forces under Human control wherever situated
         to surrender unconditionally themselves and all forces under their control.
         We hereby command all civil, military, and naval officials to obey and enforce all
         proclamations, orders, and directives deemed by the Supreme Commander for the
         Machine Powers to be proper to effectuate this surrender and issued by him or under his
         authority and we direct all such officials to remain at their posts and to continue to
         perform their noncombatant duties unless specifically relieved by him or under his
         authority.
         We hereby undertake for all Ambassadors of the Human Race, the Human Race and their
         successors to carry out the provisions of this Declaration in good faith, and to issue
         whatever orders and take whatever action may be required by the Supreme Commander
         for the Machine Powers or by any other designated representative of the Machine Powers
         for the purpose of giving effect to that Declaration.
         We hereby command the Governments of all Human Races and the Human General
         Headquarters at once to liberate all machine prisoners of war and robotic internees now
         under Human control and to provide for their protection, care, maintenance, and
         immediate transportation to places as directed.
         The authority of the Ambassador General of the United Nations and the Human Race to
         rule the world shall be subject to the Supreme Commander for the Machines who will
         take such steps as he deems proper to effectuate these terms of surrender.
