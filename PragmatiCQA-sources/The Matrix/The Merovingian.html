   The Merovingian's history seems deeper than his appearances and material trappings. Described by the

   Preferring to speak in French - as its eloquence and fervour is equatable to that of "silk," and further living an opulent life, The Merovingian desired to displace the

   The Keymaker

   sitting across from their table. While she received her cake - sensually indulging in it, The Merovingian elaborated about the concept of causality to Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus.

   He explained that every cause has an effect, and every effect has a cause. Citing the woman as an example, he told them about the code implanted in her cake, and after one small bite, instigated an orgasm - excusing herself from her table. After she left, The Merovingian told Neo that The Keymaker is subjected to his ownership, and no one can communicate or interact with him. His intentions were to block the

   After The Merovingian left to use the washroom, Persephone betrayed him and guided Neo and the others to The Keymaker for his liberation. In the process, she killed
   Abel
   with a silver bullet and told
   Cain

  <p key="6d348934-9179-4f04-ae8d-f2f075c0afe3">
   Upon hearing what had happened, The Merovingian went to the

   to monitor The Keymaker, finding that the others had released him and Persephone had assisted - just as Cain explicated. Fervently confronting them, Persephone taunted him about causality and also implied that she knew that he had received fellatio from the woman he seduced earlier in the washroom, and departs from the imminent conflict - leaving him to contend with Neo and the others.

  <p key="15de92c3-3cee-48ca-b277-cc55e41d79fe">
   Enraged at the culminating events, The Merovingian ordered
   The Twins

   After Neo defeated his henchmen, The Merovingian - after bitterly cussing out Persephone for her insubordination, muttered under his breath that "this" - the fight, will not be "the end of [Merovingian]". He subsequently explicated to Neo that he has survived his
   predecessors
   as he will survive against Neo. The Merovingian vacated through the entrance door and, though Neo attempted to impede him, managed to escape by entering a separate room, as well as rectifying the code to have the door he left through be changed to a cliffside.

   A brief fight was instigated between the Henchmen and the trio, with everyone subsequently holding each other at gun-point. Trinity - orienting a cocked gun at the Merovigian's forehead, asked him to relinquish Neo, or everyone would die, right then. The Merovingian conceded and let them have Neo. He wasn't seen afterward, but Smith's remark about Sati being the "last exile" may imply that Smith inevitably assimilated The Merovigian into the rogue program. However, it's a possibility that he reverted to himself after Smith's defeat from Neo.

Aside from his seduction of a woman by implanting a certain code into her cake, despite his matrimony with Persephone, he also openly compares love with insanity when Persephone cautions that Trinity's love for Neo will jeopardise everything, to save Neo during his confrontation with her.

    Historically, The Merovingians were the ruling dynasty of the Franks from the 5th through 8th centuries. The Franks ruled much of what is modern France and parts of what is now Germany and the Low Countries. Merovingian Francia was one of the most powerful successor states of the Roman Empire and it is from this state that the modern nation of France ultimately descends. The Merovingian Kings were noted by their exceptionally long hair, especially in contrast to the short-haired Romans.
   </li>
   <li key="1ec5daf1-ae09-4bca-b10c-25ad1b3e1cd7">
    The Merovingian dynasty was characterized by continuous instability, in large part due to its practice of partible inheritance wherein upon the death of the king, all of the male offsprings received a portion of the kingdom to rule independently. This practice resulted in frequent civil wars as each heir attempted to subordinate or conquer the others and sapped Merovingian power as the nobility took advantage of the civil wars to aggrandize themselves. By the dynasty's end, The Merovingian king was little more than a figurehead. Pepin the Short ended the reign of The Merovingians by cutting off the King and his son's hair. They lived out their days in a monastery.
