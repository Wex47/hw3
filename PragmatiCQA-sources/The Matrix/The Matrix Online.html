   Combat is divided into two separate parts: Free-fire and Interlock. Free-fire mode allowed for large gun battles to take place, while Interlock is often broken down into bullet-time-affected martial arts moves. There were three main classes in the Matrix Online: Coder, Hacker, and Operative. Coders create special simulacrum that fight for them. Hackers manipulate the code of the matrix to affect friends or enemies from a distance, either damaging them, downgrading their combat abilities, or healing them and upgrading their powers.

   Operatives are the soldiers seen from the movies- Martial Artists, Gunmen, and the spy class, which revolves around stealth fighting and knife throwing. When taking or dealing damage, the players damage influences are pitted against the other players resistance influences of the same damage type. Higher resistance versus lower damage means that the defending player will not take as much damage. when attacking or defending against attacks, one players accuracy influences are pitted against another's defense influences of the same attack type.

This virus was designed to reveal the underlying code, showing the bluepills the true nature of the Matrix, causing them to reject it as real, and possibly crashing the system.

The Corrupted were designed to destabilize the Matrix upon death, and by releasing them en masse, the Assassin hoped that players killing them would completely destroy the Matrix.

Pace actually smiled on occasion, and behaved almost benevolently toward human redpills under her authority. "Pace" is Latin for "with peace", commonly taken to mean that no offense is intended by the speaker.

Realizing his imminent doom is quickly approaching, the Assassin split himself into multiple, weakened copies, which all spread out across the Megacity to do as much damage as possible, in the hopes of destroying the Matrix before he was deleted. As battle raged across the city, the Redpills managed to destroy all but one copy of the Assassin, of whom Niobe and an unnamed operative chased down and destroyed.

   The 7.1 Cinematic revealed a wet return from the river for Seraph. Emerging from the

   , without provocation. As MoonAvatar fell to the ground, Seraph performed what could only be described as a 'code exorcism', placing his foot on the neck, his hands over the body and extracting some unknown code from the victim.
  </p>
  <p key="08fdffac-de5e-4b7b-8c34-8d0a272cef7e">
   So began Seraph's spree of attacks across the Megacity, both Red and Bluepill, without a word to anyone. Each victim would recover eventually, and would not remember the past few months. Although Seraph his attacks seemed random, after a few days a group of redpills managed to approach him and asked him for his reasons behind the attacks. Seraph, who now sported a dirty coat, and a yellow code aura around his head, stated that he saw a 'dangerous deception' something that he could see because a 'veil had been lifted from his eyes', and that he had a new, more important purpose than guarding the Oracle.
  </p>
  <p key="2b00b4f9-7d79-40f6-8f21-3beb96a080fb">
   The attacks still continued, but with surprising results. The Cypherites, with their leader, Cryptos, were approached by Seraph whilst on their way to a bluepill that had been attacked. Without warning, Seraph attacked Cryptos, knocked him down, and escaped.
  </p>
  <p key="8f72e5e3-b9b6-4ca4-8f76-e742432ea186">
   Cryptos began to act strangely, with his glasses and trademark bluepill knocked off, his eyes became black, only showing yellow code on his eyeballs. Blind, Cryptos began to lose control of his speech, calling for fellow Redpills and Veil, the other Cypherite leader. As the Redpills around him tried to aid their leader, he began shouting 'INPUT ERROR, RUNTIME ERROR, OPTIC ERROR'. As Veil ordered her crew in the real to pull his jack, it became clear that he had been a machine from the start, although who he was originally working for is still unclear. It turned out that Seraph only attacked operatives and bluepills that were over-written by the Machines sometime in the past (similar to the Smith virus). Apparently, as a result, Zion is slowly became distrustful of the Machines.

   On the Merovingian's side of things, his organization is attempting to get kill-codes to the Oracle's shell once again. His new-found ally, the General, has stated that a cheat code vial is required as an ingredient, and only an Exile called
   the Apothecary
   can manufacture the kill-code with the vial. After recovering a vial from a bluepill named
   Jason Hernandez
   , looking for the Apothecary was problematic, as the Machines held the Apothecary inside a construct that only the
   Trainman
   can reach. As a result, the Merovingian had his operatives search for the Trainman.

  <p key="b25fc267-8425-4ea5-b421-fa19abba29c3">
   It was discovered that the Machines had, since the Truce, been using an ability to over-write thoughts and minds (an ability they discovered was possible after Agent Smith's use) and place programs of their own writing in their place. They hoped that by exhibiting a degree of control over peoples' thoughts and actions, they could better control and thus maintain the stability of the Matrix.

  <p key="22084fa0-a9ab-401e-9327-d9952b6a92a9">
   The Machines' plan is nulled, however, with Seraph's permanent return when Zion performs scans on all of their redpill operatives for any indication that they have been "overwritten". It is discovered that a large percentage of Zion's operatives have been "overwritten" by the Machines.

To counter the delay, Agents began tracking down and eliminating the General's systems of communication within the Matrix and disrupted his movements.

   The Merovingian completed the construction of the kill code intended for the Oracle, using Agent Pace as a practice target to ensure its lethal capabilities. Agent Pace was severely wounded in the attack, but repaired quickly and returned to active duty with a much colder and calculating personality, more similar to the standard stereotype of an Agent as had ever before been observed. The Merovingian, however, was quickly side-tracked by the General's position as he lost base after base, Commando after Commando at the hands of Zion and Machine operatives. With the aid of the Trainman, who had earlier assisted the Merovingian with the transportation of the kill code, the Merovingian began shuttling the Commandos into constructs.

As the Commando fired the single shot which would herald the Oracle's permanent deletion, the Kid jumped into the path of the bullet, preventing it from hitting the Oracle; (The Kid had not reported any adverse reactions to absorbing the kill code meant for the Oracle). Frustrated, the Merovingian saw it only fitting that he take control of both the General and his men, in exchange for their inability to carry out the assassination on the Oracle by activating override routines secretly implanted in both, during the transfers.

    Another Liaison officer,
    TaeCross
    from the EPN's Recursion instance, was rumored to be working with Morpheus a full year after his last known sighting. After poor dealings with the Machines and repeated setbacks, TaeCross acted out in a Morpheus-like attack of code bombs on the city. It was strongly rumored that since the code bomb technology hadn't been seen since Morpheus' disappearance, TaeCross got this technology directly from Morpheus himself. TaeCross unleashed a final set of 8 code bombs simultaneously at the steps of the First Union Church in Camon Central. His final whereabouts were left unknown. It is also of note that TaeCross is an anagram of
    Socrates

The Merovingian sends a specially-equipped commando to kill the Oracle, but he is stopped by the Kid and EPN. Zion finds out about Cypherite spies in their city. The Merovingian hides the General in his white hallways, and stores some of the commando programs away in hidden constructs.
