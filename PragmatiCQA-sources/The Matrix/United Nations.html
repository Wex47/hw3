   The United Nations was originally founded as an international organization to bring together the world's nations in a forum where current global issues would be discussed and solutions would be voted on. It was founded in 1945 at the signing of the United Nations Charter by 51 countries, replacing the previous "League of Nations."

   By the early or mid-21st century, the United Nations became something much more. By arrival of the
   Second Renaissance
   , the United Nations became strengthened beyond its original intent over the decades. It appeared to be the main representative body of humanity, and held influence over commerce and the military. The latter of which was apparent as the UN was in control of every aspect of the

   Before the Machine War began, when
   Zero One
   petitioned to become a member of the United Nations, the leaders of the United Nations, as well as their constituents, did not think very highly of robots because human economies were losing money for one thing, and for another they simply viewed the machines as something detastable, utterly incompatible with their arrogant norms and foolish ideology – with heed to their reaction about the two 01 ambassadors as they stepped before the UN as “a man and a woman” believing to please the UN by it. The United Nations, and humanity (in fact represented/constitued by mankind only) however decided to wipe Zero One off the face of the Earth instead of negotiating with it. It is also theorized that the United Nations, through some of its subordinate organizations, had a hand in the trial and execution of

   But, as the Machine War was going badly for mankind, the United Nations became increasingly powerless until its capital of New York, which was one of humanity's last standing cities untouched by the war, was finally destroyed in 2199, bringing about the destruction of human civilization.
