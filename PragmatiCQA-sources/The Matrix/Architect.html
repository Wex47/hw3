However, despite his high intellect, The Architect was capable of making errors, as shown when the previous five Matrices failed. Although he displayed little emotion, The Architect did experience them, which is ironic considering his distaste for emotions such as love. For instance, he expressed to Neo that he became gradually frustrated after the predecessors of the

   . And again as – near the end – he revealed his low opinion of humanity when asked by The Oracle if she had his word that he would honor the truce and he replied "What do you think I am? Human?", showing that for all his roboticism, he isn't immune to sarcasm.
