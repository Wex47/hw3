   Each cylindrical tower contains up to hundreds of thousands of
   pods

   Meanwhile, each pod generates bioelectric energy and neural processing power that, collectively and combined with nuclear fusion, is used by the Machines to power

   , nuclear fusion was the primary power source of the Machines, while the minds of the pod-humans are also combined as a form of a massive biocomputing neural network. Each human mind within the Matrix also worked as a sub-processor for the virtual world.

   Each pod is tended to by a
   Docbot
   , a Machine entity that ensures each human stays asleep and is working properly. Each pod is connected to a waste chute. Many human bodies that have died are recycled into a gelatinous nutrient that is fed back to other pods.

   In the case of some bodies (such as Redpills), the Docbot may be commanded to eject a human from the pod, where the body falls into the remains of the ancient sewers, conduits and other tunnels from the old, dilapidated human cities which cover the scarred surface of the Earth.
