   A woman wakes on the surface and hears her
   Operator
   greet her through her headset. She tells him she's awake and, when he urges her to get moving to the
   fetus fields
   , crushes one of the small spider-like maintenance

   crawling over her which had just bitten her neck, shouting that she's awake back at him again.
  </p>
  <p key="caac45b8-4979-4393-b105-0a15fe4e4882">
   Sitting up, she reminds herself that she needs to remember why she's doing this;
   <i key="0bf00707-9f64-41aa-9673-076375531a54">
    [she starts walking]

   not for
   <a href="Zion.html" key="b7ece3d9-cb2a-4bd5-ab59-d37ede054a40" title="Zion">

   or their scientists;

    [now reaching the fetus fields, she stops and looks over them]
   </i>
   but for the children;
   <i key="3a8ec400-027d-447b-bcf4-cca6b16ca74a">
    [as she reaches one of the
    pods
    she wipes the surface clear to look at the baby inside]
   </i>
   and herself.
  </p>
  <p key="1a7bc30b-be24-4f3e-a20e-44481a8abc5a">
   She cracks the fetus pod free while holding it in a carrying bag, and hugs it, saying "he's perfect!". Suddenly, she looks around to see the searchlight of a
   <a href="Harvester.html" key="38d661b7-e714-4c2c-b902-08fcd9d24ac0" title="Harvester">
    Harvester
   </a>
   blazing down on her and screams "Oh God! No!", desperately running away between the rows of fetus pods and demanding a way out of there immediately. The operator lets her know that they are tracking and tells her to go to the
   waste funnel
   , saying they will meet her at the
   bottom
   .
  </p>
  <p key="64ba3c6e-1e2c-416b-b227-967395a3c411">
   The woman leaps into the giant funnel with the Harvester close behind her and, as she slides down with the Harvester's tentacles following, she catches on some tubes and almost loses the pod she is carrying, just grabbing it by the carrying bag's handle. Quickly the tentacles are almost on her, and she slips, the pod falling away and the tentacles finally closing in and impaling her with their claws.
  </p>
  <p key="2de3b87b-9d17-4d71-bac0-8928c33eacea">
   Lying strapped to the chair, the

   ends, and she returns to consciousness in the

   . The operator calms her while he unstraps her from the chair, saying that she's okay and out of the simulation now. He remarks that he's not surprised it failed, saying that they obviously need a male to secure the infant, but is cut short by the woman grabbing him by the neck, shouting at him and insisting that she is not giving up.
  </p>
  <p key="2e256131-7c48-4a14-a293-84c37c887a05">
   A child cries out "…mama?!" and again less worriedly as the woman approaches the doorway the child is standing in. She asks if it was a bad dream and picks him up, telling him that she's fine as she hugs him, and as she reassures him, saying "I've got you now", we see the child's
   headjack
   , an indication that she has by now successfully completed the real mission.
