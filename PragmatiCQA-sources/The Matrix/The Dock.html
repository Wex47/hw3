   Standing in the center of the Dock was a large, cylindrical tower housing Zion's traffic control and defense headquarters. The tower was many hundreds of feet tall and had dozens of long bridges that branched out to the edges of the Dock, leading to Zion's living quarters, energy production machines, the Temple and the Council Chamber. The tower was also fortified with heavy gun turrets, used extensively during the

   . Large drilling machines burrowed their way into the Dock through it's high ceiling, crashing to the lower levels, a successful strategy that enabled them to avoid Zion's tunnel defenses. The Sentinels swarmed in seconds later and quickly gained the upper hand in the battle. Finally, the Dock was temporarily saved when the
