   Not only did the leaders of humanity refuse to negotiate the resolution of the economical downturn, but also chose to exterminate the Machines from existence. Then an all-out barrage on 01 by the humans began, intended to put an end to the machine menace once and for all. Unfortunately for mankind, nuclear attacks weren't particularly effective against the machines. Only the electromagnetic pulses produced by the bombs proved harmful to the machines, but although most of Earth's nuclear weapons were used in the initial attack, it was not enough to permanently damage their essence, which they quickly regenerated.

   But the robots anticipated such a move and stored great quantities of their power, enabling them to fight under blackened skies. With no sunlight, humans ran out of food faster than the robots ran out of their stored energy. While the lack of solar power would eventually force the machines to pursue other energy sources, Operation Dark Storm failed to turn the tide in the humans' favor.

   Meanwhile on the surface, the war continued, horrifically, with excessive brutality on both sides, until, inevitably, the machines claimed victory.

   was designed to be a perfect human world, where none suffered and everyone was happy. But it was a disaster. No one would accept the program because it was unbelievable. Countless human minds disconnected themselves from the program, accidentally killing themselves.

  <p key="8b04983d-e513-4724-aca4-51490f01bdc7">
   Entire "crops" were lost. So the machines decided to redesign the Matrix into what the real human world once was. Filled with suffering and pain. This worked for a while, but still too many humans would not accept the program. Especially because they didn't believe the over-dramatic, unconvincing and too often farfetched "soap operas" being played out around them that were engineered and staged by the AI's vision of how they presumed human life should look like. They got better at this over time, but eventually wisely decided that the best way was to leave the humans to play around by their own and shape their own, more convincing settings of life. But still many humans somehow sensed that there was something wrong with the world and instinctively tried to reach beyond it, causing fluctuations and disturbances in the Matrix.
  </p>
  <p key="ab758edb-57cb-4aeb-89b5-5419c3692c71">
   The machines almost decided to clone other warm-blooded animals, to replace humans with organisms that would be less aware of minute errors in the program. But they needed humans, because they could use the spare processing power of the human brain to control their nuclear fusion reaction (which produced the basic energy that was the beginning of the chain in the whole energy generation process). The machines were using the human brains to enhance their own processing power. In fact, much of the Matrix was dependent on the collective memory and processing power of the human brains themselves (that's why the humans were able to affect and reshape the reality of the Matrix). The spare processing power of the human brains was used to stabilize the cold fusion reaction that took place in the power plants.
  </p>
  <p key="ed180844-29ea-44e3-b9ae-f36a81350620">
   The energy from the fusion reactions was combined with recycled organic molecular structures, recharging them in a photosynthesis-like fashion and turning to chemical energy, consumed by the human body and moderately released in the form of heat and electricity that the human body generated naturally, thus producing a temperate, stable energy release rate, that the machines could absorb with ease without having to store great quantities of energy. Electromagnetic waves harmed their systems if not handled through an organic tool like the human body. So using human hosts as batteries was the perfect solution for the machines. As an energy source, humans were easily renewable and completely recyclable, the dead liquefied and fed intravenously to the living.
  </p>
  <p key="619d2b5f-41c2-4bec-880f-a4a0f729a340">
   All the materials from which humans were built were constantly recycled. Every dead human was liquefied and fed to newly grown humans. The whole system was essentially a self-recycling, self-sustaining cybernetic cold fusion reactor. The intense EM bursts generated by the cold fusion were absorbed by the system's biological components as they were harmful to mechanical systems. Due to the constant

   bombardment, organic processors were needed to control the reaction, as artificial processors could not work under such conditions. As such, the machines would be unable to generate energy in this fashion without working, healthy, human minds.
  </p>
  <p key="0be69ca0-4009-40ea-a84e-3a31c9fa6f37">
   Further to the nutrients provided by the liquified dead, the machines had only to provide water into the system. Hydrogen from the water powered the cold fusion reaction, and oxygen allowed the humans to breathe and burn their chemical energy and convert it to a form of energy the machines could absorb. To increase efficiency, the human metabolism was altered by the machines' genetic engineering, to increase heat production to far exceed the normal level of heat produced by human bodies in nature. Thus the human bodies were forced to burn all the chemical energy that was input instead of spending it on growing useless tissues like hair or nails.
  </p>
  <p key="db309282-3e71-46e9-8bf0-2caedab49ed0">
   The hydrogen was also mixed with carbon dioxide and other human waste products, and used to recharge the molecular structures until they were again full with stored chemical energy and fed back into the humans. This was an inexhaustible cycle creating energy. All that was lost from the process was the mass of hydrogen (essentially the same process that took place in the sun only in colder form). With enough hydrogen in the water on Earth to last the machines for millions of years, there was more than enough for them to spread beyond Earth's atmosphere.

   So the Matrix was once again reconstructed, now with a measure of free choice that humans were aware of. But this opened the gate to a dangerous new anomaly. This was actually the embodiment of a known mathematical anomaly, which caused fluctuations in even the simplest equations. This anomaly grew in the elaborate Matrix of mathematical precision and threatened the system itself. It came in the form of a man, who could not only shape his own destiny, but the fate of the entire Matrix as well. This forced the Architect of the Matrix (an AI program which created, maintained and controlled the Matrix world) to find a way around this anomaly.

   Meanwhile the small group of people that managed to elude the machines and take refuge in Zion, finally managed to get the station fully operational. Defenses were built and the band of exiles began to plan for the emancipation of their fellow humans. With the use of the station's hovercrafts they were able to take stealthy trips to the surface utilizing the vast underground sewer systems of the giant mega-cities. In the ventures to the surface they discovered the hellish nightmare that now enshrouded mankind. With even a stronger resolve the group began to steal technology from the machines.

   They adapted their ships to allow them to hack into the AI's false world and began to battle the AI on its own ground. But they soon discovered that it was harder than they first thought. Whenever their digital selves were injured inside the Matrix, their bodies were harmed in the real world as well, as a result of a psychosomatic response. In essence, when the brain thought the body was injured, the injury turned real. While connected to the Matrix people had been known to alter their blood pressure, lower their body temperature, even manifest tumors as a result of the psychological stimuli.
  </p>
  <p key="54c0dd63-c84d-4e72-b3da-b094e42d86c1">
   And these stimuli could definitely cause more serious injuries. Although they couldn't spontaneously break a bone, they could certainly stop their hearts or burst a key blood vessel in their brains. Therefore those that were killed inside the Matrix died in the real world as well. It was difficult at best to survive and many were lost as the AI developed sentient search programs that sought out the early rebels. But nature has a way of adapting a species to exist and mankind was no different. The brains of the humans connected to the Matrix started to mutate, grow beyond the passive state they were in, giving the humans in the artificial reality psychic powers.

   The Matrix, being the largest and most advanced program in the universe (with the number of calculations per seconds greater than the estimated number of particles in the universe) was an important center of the Machine society. All the AI nodes were linked together through the Matrix. Therefore what happened in the Matrix had direct effect on the machine world. Much of the AI collective existed in the Matrix, in the form of programs simulating humans. This way if and when the rebels tried to destroy the AI's nodes in the Matrix, these characters responded almost immediately to stop them.

  <p key="7ff362c0-e379-4700-af38-60d2808a897d">
   In a sense the machine world was under the control of the Matrix. All the connection nodes intersected in the Matrix, as if it was some sort of processing center - a focal point where all the "ideas" and "instincts" of the AI entity were first expressed in some form, like imagination. The Matrix was filled with metaphoric imagery. Like a daydream, it did not make literal sense, but symbolically it had logic to it. In this post-apocalyptic world, the battle was not for the future of the Earth (that had already been lost) but for the future of the human souls trapped in the Matrix. It was just as was foretold in ancient texts. But those prophecies were only a warning. It didn't have to happen in this way. It was only one possible time line.

"The One" is actually systemic in nature; the utilization of the equations which run the matrix allow for almost all humans to be maintained within the simulation indefinitely. At the same time, the code is not 100% effective, and allows for a few humans to have the potential to "self-substantiate" (free themselves) without outside assistance. In addition, those who are free can continue to hack the matrix wirelessly and free other minds.

   One of the worst errors that can be caused by this non 100% code is an anomaly referred to as "The One". "The One" is essentially the culmination of the worst errors created by the matrix's own inadequate code. Because there has always been inherent error in the code, there has constantly been other "One"s in the past. However, the architect of the matrix for a time compensated for this error by giving the other "One's" two choices; Either inject their unique code into the matrix (which allowed for an increased chance of keeping other humans under after the reboot) and select a specific amount of people who would survive OR return back to the matrix, resulting in the human race being destroyed.
