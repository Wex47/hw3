   They were tasked with picking up the dead and incapacitating live humans in order to study them. In addition, the Machines initially relied on sentinels to maintain their
   power plants
   before eventually replacing the sentinels in that capacity with
   specialized medical hoverbots
   . After the conclusion of the war in the machines' favor, the sentinel units were further upgraded, and now patrol the sewers of the dead human cities of old, where they search for wandering Zion vessels or humans unlucky enough to be walking through them at the time.

  <p key="9aec689e-69fe-445f-bf64-3bd0e48638ec">
   A sentinel appears as a multi-tentacled creature with multiple sensors that moves effortlessly through the air, probably using an advanced internal form of
   pad
   technology; one can easily catch up to a fully-powered human hovercraft. A sentinel's frightening appearance reminds many humans of squids, where they get their nickname of "squiddies". They tend to fly in swarms like insects, that can range from a few to thousands.
  </p>
  <p key="9aa98473-629f-4ea5-b9d2-58aa1e4318e3">
   In addition to their powerful, clawed tentacles, sentinels are armed with a continuously firing laser beam that can slice and weld metal structures with ease, including a ship's hull. They are equipped with multiple audio and visual sensors, which look like satellite dishes and eyes. Sentinels are capable of electrical signature detection, such as generated by a fully-powered hovercraft, and will relentlessly follow that signal to its end.
  </p>
  <p key="07ee6c5c-c01b-4753-bc80-11f68519df51">
   Sentinels are also armed with

    tow bombs
   </a>
   , tiny  machines that seem like a sentinel's larvae, but are actually guided explosives that will tear through and destroy a hovercraft with ease. A sentinel will deploy such a bomb by grasping it in a single tentacle, spinning very fast and releasing it with great velocity toward its target.
  </p>
  <p key="d9b18692-da6c-4eef-8d10-def98f3ebb4a">
   The sentinel's multiple appendages can be used as an ablative armor, deflecting projectiles like bullets from the vital "heads" (where programming data is stored) of close-by sentinel allies, explaining the swarm tactic.
  </p>
  <p key="40ec49ce-9435-4339-b72b-3b0e45087c30">
   There is no negotiating or reasoning with a sentinel. They only receive orders either from within the Matrix by
   Agents
   , or by the
   <a href="Deus Ex Machina.html" key="97b62acb-be5c-419b-be13-52c42ea2fbee" title="Deus Ex Machina">

   While hovercraft are normally needed to stop an attacking sentinel, a lucky human armed with a
   lightning rifle
   may be able to destroy one. A human in command of an
   APU
   can also deal sufficiently quick damage to approaching sentinels, but are at the sentinel's mercy if their APU is within close range, as the APU can be pushed over or the sentinel's ripping claws can tear the relatively unprotected human controlling the APU.
