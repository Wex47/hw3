   Soon enough, Rocket's whole team were killed leaving him the sole survivor. And though Rook managed to destroy the sentinels before getting killed himself, Rocket had already sustained a broken leg from the attack and, with Rook and all possible operators gone, was stranded inside the

  <p key="464459ca-f502-443d-9bc3-ab08de488c4a">
   Rocket contacted the Resistance for help and was given a safe house back in nearby
   Scottsdale
   , Rocket's own home town. For days, Rocket awaited rescue in his safe house, all the while resisting with his mind, trying to withstand the pain from his physical body's injuries, and growing weaker due to the lack of real-world sustenance.
  </p>
  <p key="b19bcf39-be85-499b-a0d8-58fd8db988e2">
   During these days, he was often visited by a Resistance operative,
   King
   , who was relaying news of the real-world search for him. And to help keep Rocket occupied, King started a conversation about their
   bluepill
   pasts. And when they tackled Rocket's love life, King made him realize that his previous life as a bluepill was not at all fake or meaningless, simulated though it may be. This lead Rocket to reconnect with
   Mona Thomas
   , who used to be his bluepill girlfriend.
  </p>
  <p key="29808b57-b7aa-4580-b5af-d3227d9290fb">
   After a romantic night with Mona was interrupted by Rocket's worsening leg, Rocket, considering the possibly of soon dying, immediately started to distance himself. Fleeing to a
   diner
   , he instead got into a scuffle with his old gang. Getting into a frenzy, he killed the gang leader,
   Larry Little
   . Also, while in his manic state, he revealed some truths about the

   to the spectating diners. This anomaly tipped off the

   to Rocket's activities.
  </p>
  <p key="26e818ba-6807-46a3-82da-f397679777d0">
   Soon, news came to Rocket from King that he would soon be rescued. Given new hope by the news, Rocket wanted to meet Mona once more but King advised him to prioritize leaving first, warning him of the threat of Agents. But just then,
   Agent Brown
   appeared.
  </p>
  <p key="7f166593-de9c-451e-a5a4-e73dd2ed40bb">
   King managed to kill whoever the Agent had possessed but knew that the Agent would not stop. After giving Rocket a gun and instructions to the exit, he lead the Agent away from Rocket.
  </p>
  <p key="95ac86e2-3ac6-4fed-aa80-ab1c8f121e1a">
   After Rocket found the

   location, he called Mona, asking her to quickly meet with him. She immediately went, meeting Rocket at his location. He then informed her of his need to disappear but also promised to come back for her. Mona promised to wait, and also promised to join Rocket wherever they needed to go upon his return.
  </p>
  <p key="e91c57ca-e308-4935-8e76-a8c7d4023bc4">
   Then the phone rang. Tragically, Mona was suddenly possessed by Agent Brown. Rocket hesitated to shoot Mona and allowed the possession to fully take place. By then though, all was too late. Agent Brown already had Rocket and proceeded to kill him.
