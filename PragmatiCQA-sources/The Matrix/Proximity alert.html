   , activate the ship's
   Electromagnetic pulse
   destroying all machines in the area and killing all jacked in crew, or be forced to wait and hope that the ship is not detected. Many ship Captains would find fleeing or powering down a more effective way of survival than risk using shipboard weaponry.
