Bringing him into an interrogation room, Smith read from Neo's file, stating that it appeared Neo had been living two lives - one of Thomas A Anderson, an employee at a respected software company who seemed to be an average person. The other life was that of his hacker alias Neo, in which Smith claimed he was guilty of every computer crime they had a law for. However, in an effort to appeal to Neo's better nature, Smith removed his glasses and offered Neo a choice: he would have his slate wiped clean, with all charges dropped, if he aided the Agents with information that would lead to the capture of Morpheus, a man Smith claimed to be the most dangerous man alive. Neo acknowledged that was a good deal, but nevertheless rejected it, disappointing Smith. Neo demanded a phone call in accordance with his rights, to which Smith stated: "Tell me, Mr. Anderson: what good is a phone call, if you're unable to speak?" Neo's mouth sealed itself and Neo bolted from his chair in terror. Jones and Brown held Neo down as Smith placed a tracking bug in Neo.

Smith taunted Morpheus in an attempt to break him, stating that he had figured out that humanity operated not like mammals, but instead they spread until every natural resource was consumed - like a virus. He also stated that humans had their time, and that the future belonged to the Machines. In exasperation upon realising that their serum was not working, Smith ordered Brown and Jones out of the room, so that Smith could interrogate Morpheus alone.

   Smith removed his sunglasses and earpiece - severing his connection to the other Agents - and told Morpheus that he hated the Matrix because of the 'stink' of humans - fearing he was somehow being infected by it. He then grabbed Morpheus' head and demanded Zion's mainframe codes, stating that he needed to be free of the Matrix and destroying Zion would be the key to that goal. However, Morpheus resisted still, and Jones and Brown re-entered the room, finding Smith about to crush Morpheus' skull. Because Smith had removed his earpiece, he had been unaware of Neo and Trinity entering the Matrix in a bid to rescue Morpheus, storming the lobby of the govermnent building and killing the police that stood in their way.

   After Jones failed to kill Neo and Trinity on the roof, the Agents were confronted by the pair in a helicopter, with Neo manning the mounted gatling gun. Smith expressed angry denial upon realising that he couldn't hope to avoid the incoming barrage of gunfire. The Agents attempted to fight back, but all three were swiftly cut down, allowing Morpheus time to break free of his restraints and make a run for the helicopter. The Agents took new hosts, and Smith opened fire on Morpheus, attempting to prevent his escape. Smith succeeded in hitting Morpheus' leg through a wall, though Neo jumped from the helicopter to catch him. As the helicopter flew off, Smith shot at it, scoring several hits that caused it to malfunction and crash, though not before Neo, Trinity and Morpheus escaped. Tracking their phone call to Tank to a rooftop several blocks away, Smith and the other Agents appeared too late to stop them from escaping. Smith ordered the Sentinel strike.

   A homeless person spotted Morpheus using the Exit in a subway station, alerting Smith to their location. Smith took possession of the homeless man and destroyed the phone as Trinity used it. Trinity escaped, but with the phone destroyed, Neo was trapped with Smith. Neo stood his ground against Smith instead of running. They opened fire at each other as they rushed each other, catching them in mid-air. Both Neo and Smith emptied their guns' clips. Smith attempted to hit Neo with his gun as Neo flipped to his feet. Discarding their guns, Neo and Smith engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Though Neo appeared to be evenly-matched to Smith, Smith soon gained the upper hand, expressing enjoyment in Neo's future death. Smith knocked Neo back several feet, and Neo assumed a 'come on' stance, angering Smith further. Neo held his own against Smith in the second round, before Smith threw him into a wall and pummeled him. Hearing an approaching subway train, Smith dragged Neo, tossed him onto the tracks and held him in a headlock. Despite gloating that Neo was about to die, Neo summoned enough strength to propel both him and Smith into the station's ceiling. Neo flipped off the tracks, and Smith was hit by the train.

Smith, enraged that his victory had been taken from him, rushed Neo, but Neo's responses to Smith's punches was too fast. Neo knocked Smith back and charged at him, diving into Smith and destroying him from the inside-out.

   Agent Smith initially appeared to have been destroyed by Neo, but made a calculated return with greatly altered abilities and complete liberation from his prior restrictions as an Agent. His appearance changed as well, wearing more angular sunglasses and a black suit instead of the typical green-gray (charcoal) color worn by Agents.
  </p>
  <p key="b56fff34-18c2-4dea-9008-3011d1868936">
   Smith also lacked the characteristic earpiece worn by Agents, showing he is now "unplugged". No longer an Agent of the system, Smith lost his ability to travel by

  <p key="a7973803-a294-42a6-899d-e18785ed6bf9">
   Instead, Smith gained the ability to infect and assimilate anyone, whether program or human, inside the
   <i key="de22ae8c-5d55-47bb-9251-a143105a34e0">

   . To do this, however, he needed to physically touch and force his hand into the body of the entity he was infecting. The assimilation takes a few seconds but, once completed, will completely convert the infected into a copy of Smith himself, allowing him to replicate in much the same way as a computer virus. It is unknown whether his ability to dodge bullets was retained after being "unplugged", although his reaction when Morpheus threatens to shoot him with his gun indicated that any protection against physical damage was made redundant by his ability to replicate himself. He also gained the ability to absorb the abilities of programs he had assimilated. Two examples of this were The Oracle and

  </p>
  <p key="5c0cafb5-587e-446a-bacf-033acff6888c">
   As a result of being entangled with The One, Smith also began to exhibit stronger, more virulent human behaviors and emotions such as unpredictability and dry humor, which was a clear departure from his original stern demeanor. He made the claim that Neo has set him free, indicating how he not only obtained the vision but also the ability to break free of the Machines' control, existing as a singular being.
  </p>
  <p key="a288c2ca-4f0e-4528-b996-061a533dd834">
   He was then allied with no one else but himself, rendering him an outlaw to not only the

   but also the humans who inhabit it and, by extension, an enemy to the rebels of Zion. Even free of Machine control, however, Smith was still compelled to feel crushed by the weight of purpose.
  </p>
  <p key="3916ea4f-ab6a-4de0-8ef4-6d2d7213668b">
   Largely because of Neo's role in "freeing" him, he also began to set the pieces to unveiling his return. Driving towards the building where the

   was occurring while deliberately parking in front of the door with the headlights operating at full blast to obscure his identity, he then anonymously made contact with the doorman,

   , inquiring if Neo was inside. When Corrupt claimed ignorance, Smith then supplied a package (his discarded earpiece) intended for him, cryptically stating that it was to return the favor for "setting [Smith] free" before departing just as Agents Johnson, Thompson, and Jackson raided the area. He and another Smith clone then proceeded to secretly observe the ensuing fight, having apparently predicted Neo would ultimately win against the upgraded agents. One of Smith's clones also proceeded to ambush

  <p key="2968b8fb-dbbb-4b30-9c88-64e6b574d8b5">
   Eventually, Smith encountered Neo at the park shortly after the latter had met with the Oracle, his presence causing the crow-like programs to disperse. After revealing he was the anonymous deliveryman that arrived at the Crisis Meeting, he then revealed his survival and his status as no longer an agent of the system, and thus no longer bound by it. However, he and his clones then tried to kill Neo via assimilating him, citing that he nearly took away his purpose, although this ultimately failed, resulting in
   <a href="Burly Brawl.html" key="c885e80f-04e5-4ca0-ac00-c18010f2cfcc" title="Burly Brawl">
    a massive brawl in the park
   </a>
   that, combined with Smith's constantly replicating to give himself more of an edge against Neo, forced his quarry to escape. However, he and his clones were undaunted, simply going back through the city due to anticipating they'll encounter each other again.
  </p>
  <p key="fd0f98f1-d917-4835-aaea-bb29c2000f0d">
   True to Smith's predictions, he encountered Neo at the hallway immediately preceding the source and blocked the doorway just as Neo, Morpheus, and Keymaker were about to arrive. He also makes clear he had been expecting Neo's arrival contrary to Neo, and also cryptically implies his desires were aligned with Neo's, or more specifically, that he "wants everything." When Morpheus sarcastically asked in a threatening manner if a spent bullet from his gun counted regarding "everything", Smith cooly encouraged Morpheus to go ahead and shoot him, citing that his best feature at this point is that there's "so many of [Smith]." As if on cue, all the doors burst open and unveiled several Smith clones, with Smith taking the opportunity to deck Morpheus. His various clones also attempted to assimilate Morpheus while quoting the adage "can't beat them, join them", although Neo interfered and prevented them from doing so. After the power went out thanks to Trinity hacking the power grid, the Smiths, infuriated at this turn of events, attempted to use their Desert Eagles on the three as Neo flew Morpheus and Keymaker into the Source room. Although Neo successfully closed the door on them, the Smiths ultimately succeeded in killing the Keymaker. Presumably afterwards, Smith and his clones spent his time assimilating various programs and bluepills, including Exile programs.

   Continuing to reenact his vision, Smith then called Neo by his redpill alias and not by his bluepill name of "Mr. Anderson", which he normally used.

   His own thoughts then caused Smith to recoil in fear, exclaiming how it was a trick since he, at least partially, immediately realized what Neo was about to achieve. Neo, seemingly accepting how he would soon die just as Smith foresaw, simply responded in deference to Smith's proclamation of the end. Smith, in an act of almost human irrationality, dealt his finishing blow to Neo, assimilating him.

  <p key="150ea9e8-c771-4f95-b4a6-7e9b9cf3531a">
   The assimilation was not one-sided, however, with neither force completely overtaking the other. Rather, there was a union of opposites, of thesis and antithesis, leading to the synthesis of the new beginning, in which the

Taking on a new outer shell in order to avoid deletion, Smith was found by the Analyst, who turned Neo and Smith's bond into a 'chain' in which Smith would become amnesiac in the same way as Neo, and while Neo remained tethered to the system, so too did Smith. The now-amnesiac Smith became Neo's buisness partner. He would refer to Neo as 'Tom'. His tenacity translated into an eye for the bottom line, something that his business partner lacked.

This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline-related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionite redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the Agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.

This quickly led to a small-scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives.

   Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practicing their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterward.

   The most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third-anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from The Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The only person to kill the main Agent Smith virus was the Machinist Trilateral, originally of the Iterator server, on Recursion server after the server merge, being the first person in game to earn the perpetual flame virus award. The nature of this form was never revealed.

   , the final boss is the MegaSmith. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because although the Wachowskis thought the martyr approach suitable for film, they believed that for an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals) it was "Lame. Really lame".
  </p>
  <p key="ff307056-92e7-439f-8126-85eb2649fbac">
   So, described by the Wachowskis as, "A little Hulk versus Galactus action", this character was created to be the more appropriate "final boss" of Path of Neo. The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the "spectator Smiths" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.

   After Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level "Aerial Battle", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car that flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile.

   A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up.

Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. He smirks, then the fight begins.

  <p key="b3b8afe1-8cc9-414d-a063-c2edbbc1e5b5">

   While interrogating Morpheus, Agent Smith went as far as comparing humanity to a virus; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and inevitably destroys its environment, only to move on to another and repeat the process. Although since this was stated in the presence of the other Agents, he may have just been reiterating his fellow Agents' general apathy towards humans while toning down his own excessive hatred towards them. Ironically, Smith himself would later manifest as a self-replicating virus which spread throughout the

  <p key="26d9500b-2920-4358-b43a-066c4b0131cf">
   It is notable that during the interrogation, Agent Smith sent his colleagues out of the room and then removed his sunglasses, his sign of "getting personal." He followed this up by removing his earpiece, thereby severing his communication with his fellow Agents, before proceeding to express, with palpable bitterness, how he secretly despised humanity and the

   and of all its inhabitants, though this was unlikely to be literal. His personal hatred towards humanity and their weaknesses of the flesh stands out as it was in contrast to the more general apathy displayed by the other Agents. Later, during his final battle with Neo, he also grudgingly ridicules how only humanity could have ever conceived of love.

   As an Agent of the system, and despite his general hatred for humanity, Agent Smith's behavior still remained pragmatic when dealing with bluepills, seemingly keeping casualties to a minimum. An example of this being when he ordered a

   After becoming an Exile who was free from the system, Smith felt an unusual attachment and desire to kill Neo.

   After his resurrection, Smith appeared to be less nihlistic than before and even seemed to have something of a genuine fondness for Neo. His main motivation was to not going back to what he was before because Smith liked the new world he lived in. Unlike his previous interactions with Neo, Smith chose to call him Tom rather than Mr. Anderson - a carry-over from when he remained unaware of his past and acted as Neo's business partner. The only time that Smith called Neo "Mr. Anderson" again was in the moment after he recovered his memories. Unlike before, Smith didn't see conflict between the two as necessarily inevitable and simply asked Neo to stay out of his way as he sought revenge against the Analyst which Neo had no problem doing as long as Smith let him rescue Trinity. When they fought, Smith even complimented Neo's returning powers and contemplated their similarities. When he was about to kill Neo, Smith claimed that he truly was sorry that he had to do it, stating that Neo was the one to set him free again and that Neo more than anyone understood why he couldn't go back to what he was. Smith later came to Neo and Trinity's rescue rather than letting the Analyst kill them, stating that the real difference between the two of them is that anyone could've been Neo while Smith has always been everyone. As Smith left, he stated their alliance had ended, though did not suggest they would be enemies again the next time they met.

   Despite his relative cunning when hunting redpulls and his more subtle actions after his resurrection, in actual combat Smith tended to rely purely on brute force to subdue his opponents. When fighting Morpheus and Neo as an Agent, his combat style was little more than powerful, fast punches, while as an Exile he relied on his copies to overwhelm particularly troublesome foes such as Neo and Morpheus. Although he was able to fly like Neo, he only demonstrated this ability after he saw Neo do it, demonstrating a relative lack of imagination although some of this could be that he lacked this power until he absorbed

His strength was lesser with Neo's returning abilities allowing him to disable Smith for a time with a telekinetic shockwave, although they fought fairly evenly most of the time. When confronted with Neo's armed allies, Smith chose to retreat from his host body rather than continuing to fight, indicating that he was more vulnerable now. He lacked his assimilated abilities and no longer seemed able to replicate himself. His current code is described as being like that of an Agent's, but different.

   The manner in which Smith speaks is similar to that of the late Carl Sagan.
   There are also noticeable pauses at odd places in his sentences. Oddly, he doesn't really use this manner of speaking when he tells Sati he is "not such a bad guy" (perhaps to convince her he is not intimidating).

  </h2>
  <p key="ecc88f32-2377-4e84-9f0d-6c86a6f9cb6d">
   The dialectical opposition between Smith and Neo is a strong indication of what their respective characters represented. Smith was pitiless and single-minded, focused on finality, conformity, purpose and inevitability. As such, Smith represented determinism and fatalism. By contrast, Neo, with his unpredictable, emotional human nature, represented unbounded free will and the power of choice. Neo's solitary role as The One was also further contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes 'the many'. When Neo asked The Oracle about Smith, The Oracle explained that Smith was Neo's opposite and negative.

    Though Smith speaks with an American accent, in the first Matrix film, he pronounces two words out of line with an American accent (probably due to Hugo Weaving slipping up on the accent). Both of these can be heard in the scene in which Smith compares humans to viruses. First, he pronounces "mammals" and "mammal" with a harsher sounding "ah" for the "a" instead of the softer "aa" as is heard in American accents. Secondly, he clearly enunciates the "n" in "environment", which is often not heard very clearly in American accents.
