Her calm demeanor and unwillingness to run both confuses Smith and makes him afraid and uncertain. He then copies over her, creating a new Smith who laughs as he receives her power. She is one of the only people that Smith showed even a modicum of respect to, looking down on everyone else he meets.

   This proves to be a challenge, as the Smith who now has the abilities of The Oracle also seemingly gained powers similar to Neo's, finally putting Smith on equal footing with The One. The two have an epic fight on and above the streets of the damaged Mega City, but Smith's powers from the assimilated Oracle prove too strong for Neo to counter. Upon his imminent defeat, an exhausted Neo listens to Smith proclaiming victory, telling that, with The Oracle's powers, he can already see his victory. Neo may have remembered The Oracle's conversation about choice on the apartment playground days before:
