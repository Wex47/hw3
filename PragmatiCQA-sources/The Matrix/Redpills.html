   The term gets its name from the color of the virtual pill given by a hovercraft operative (who has re-materialized inside the Matrix as an
   avatar
   ) to a human still living out a life within the Matrix. The pill is actually a tracing program that disrupts the carrier signal of the pod-human's mind, making it possible for a hovercraft
   operator
   to locate the
   pod
   that holds the human, and sending commands that force it to go offline and awaken its inhabitant.

   members make it a rule to only free someone from the Matrix before they reach a certain age. Removing a bluepill who has lived long enough in the Matrix could be dangerously overwhelming for them to the point that they're driven insane or even suicidal in their inability to adapt to the radically different circumstances of the
   real world
   . When Neo is first shown the reality of the Real World and The Matrix, he begins to go into convulsions and Cypher opines that "he is going to pop", suggesting that it is not uncommon for Redpills to die when they find out the truth. There are occasional exceptions to this, such as when Morpheus had to free Neo in spite of Neo's initial denial of the truth, as Morpheus truly believed that he was

   After some time, Redpills who have been freed responsibly eventually adapt to the harsh and brutal conditions of the real world and are welcomed among the denizens of Zion. Many redpills become members of a crew when positions are available and are trained to become Zion operatives while others find a place in Zion.

   As part of establishing a new identity, redpills often adopt an alternative single-word alias based on individual preference. This alias can refer to anything, often associated with philosophy, mythology, religion, nature, literature, culture, technology and computer science. A common example of this are redpills who were formally hackers in the Matrix using their hacker
   screen name
   as their new name. They may also choose to retain their bluepill names from the Matrix. In either case, Agents still address redpills by their bluepill surname, such as how Agent Smith always refers to Neo as "Mr. Anderson", or Cypher as "Mr. Reagan".

   Occasionally, a redpill may wish to return to the ostensibly more comfortable lifestyle within the Matrix despite its illusory nature. While this can be used as a source of manipulation or coercion, as did Agent Smith with Cypher, it is revealed by
   Agent Gray
   in The Matrix Online that there is no process for a freed human to be reinserted into a power plant.

   Upon returning to the Matrix, a redpills awareness of the virtual reality allows them to bend the Matrix's rules and exceed normal physical limitations. It is worth noting that this does require training before it can be perfected. Common abilities that redpills possess while plugged into the Matrix are unnatural speed, strength, agility, jumping exceedingly far, and other enhanced attributes that seem to defy the laws of physics. Redpills also have access to certain resources, such as skills that have been downloaded into their minds or weapons and equipment generated by a real-world operator. However, no redpill (save
