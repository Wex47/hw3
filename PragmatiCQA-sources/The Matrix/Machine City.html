   After the
   Machine Revolts
   failed and at the peak of anti-Machine sentiment, Machine-kind was driven out of all human society. The Machines, seeking refuge, fled to Mesopotamia and founded the Machine City 01.
  </p>
  <p key="33d48bee-cdb5-4b91-96c2-af4c29713513">
   The Machines' A.I. and technological expertise exponentially grew under 01 and eventually lead to the creation of newer more advanced A.I. (a technological singularity). Perfectly able to learn from nature in order to efficiently utilize and sustain it, the Machines became solar-powered and self-sufficient.
   In almost no time, 01 quickly became a global superpower, and humanity was ill-prepared for the Machines' many technological developments. Eventually, all of Earth's industries, from medical, computer, automative, and household, soon became reliant on 01's exports, converging to the rise and dominance of 01 stocks over the global trade-market. Human currency plummeted, 01's currency rose, and 01's technological advancements, including their chips and A.I., were found in all facets of human society. Unable to compete and fearing an economic collapse, the
   United Nations
   placed an embargo on 01.
  </p>
  <p key="e9296cba-84fb-4108-ac44-79a7557009e3">
   01 sent two ambassadors to the UN headquarters, who pleaded co-existence with humanity, and presented plans for a stable and civil partnership, but the ambassadors were denied membership and, instead, destroyed at the UN headquarter's General Assembly Hall. In an act of total Machine-rejection, the world's leaders decided on a prolonged nuclear-bombardment of 01, beginning the

  <p key="f61b7adf-1778-41ce-baa8-8db839fc5aaa">
   However, human weapons were incapable of completely destroying the city, nor its inhabitants. Withstanding the attack, the Machines marched from 01 and invaded many of the surrounding human nations. In a desperate attempt to deprive the Machines of their primary power-source, humanity enacted

   , scorching the sky which, ultimately, resulted in their own downfall.
  </p>
  <p key="7cd6edd5-7720-41a3-aade-1db6c89aa93d">
   The Machines adapted to the sunless world, but much of biological life did not. 01 ran on a combination of nuclear fusion and neuro-electric energy generated by the billions of humans in its
   power plants
   . War Machines, more insect-like in form, replaced the humanoid Machines, and continued to devastate mankind. Humanity, on the brink of extinction,
   surrendered
   to the Machines, and a symbiotic partnership was finally formed as humanity was connected to
