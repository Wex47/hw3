   As the Machines tunneled toward Zion, Lock devised a strategy where the hovercrafts would be scattered in an attempt to use the ship EMP devices in a combined attack to disable most, if not all of the digging machines and Sentinels all at once. However,

   By the end of the first wave of the Machine attack, Zion would have fallen were it not for the arrival of the hovercraft

    Hammer

   activated their EMP, disabling all Machine forces. Although the Machines' progress was momentarily halted, Lock was displeased that the Hammer's EMP had also knocked out most of Zion's defenses, saying that they had just handed the dock to the machines "on a silver platter"- despite the fact that the dock was already more or less lost.
  </p>
  <p key="b3e814f6-2c8d-4d2c-843c-5dc322114f50">
   When the Council asked his advice as the Machines commenced their attack, the only course of action was continuing with his original back-up plan; gathering Zion's citizens in the Temple and making a last stand at the Temple gates. However, Lock and his forces never had to make the stand. Neo, who successfully arrived in the Machine City, had negotiated with the Machines: he would defeat Agent Smith if the Machines withdrew from Zion.

   After the War, Lock plays an important role for new
   redpills
   as they gain reputation for Zion. Among the important things, Lock promotes the redpills to Captain so that they can have their own crew. Other than that, Lock praises the Zion-affiliated redpills job-well done in pre-recorded messages held by Niobe and
   Ghost
   .

   During renewed warfare with the Machines after the collapse of Neo's
   Truce
   the human citizens of Zion were relocated to a safer location deeper within the earth, referred to as
   New Zion
   . Lock stayed in Old Zion with a skeleton crew of Zion military personnel after the rest of the city was evacuated. Unfortunately,
   Cypherite
   spies compromised the security of Old Zion before it was completely abandoned, allowing Sentinels to overrun the city. Lock was not among those rescued from the
   Sentinels
   ' attack, and remained missing. Given the devastating nature of the attack on Old Zion, chances seemed slim that Lock could have survived. Captain
   Roland
   was promoted to succeed Lock as the Commander of Zion's military.
