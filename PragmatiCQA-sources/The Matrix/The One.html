   The mechanisms by which The One appears are rather simple and arranged in the Prime Program process: when the anomalies in the Matrix reach a certain threshold and begin to pose serious problems, a random human is selected by the machines to be born with a special code (the Integral Anomaly) that, as said before, ties and attaches all of the anomalies within the Matrix to the programming of this human. The Oracle, who is aware of The One's existence and purpose because it is her duty to guide humanity to find The One, will enlighten him to his true nature and lead him towards the Source where he fulfills his purpose of reinserting the Prime Program and resetting the Matrix. She does this by predicting the return of The One to the people of Zion to aid them in freeing humanity from the Machines' grip. The Architect, as creator of the Matrix, is also well aware of The One's existence and purpose, referring to The One as an "eventuality".

    Neo
   </a>
   learns a surprising truth about the Matrix. The Matrix is much older than the humans of Zion think. The Architect explains that, in addition to two
   unstable versions
   of the Matrix, there have been five iterations, or cycles, of the Matrix. In each stable iteration, an incarnation of The One has appeared. Neo is The Sixth One to appear in the sixth Matrix iteration in which the trilogy takes place.

   In each iteration, The One is guided by the Oracle and then the
   Keymaker
   to a holding room of sorts where The One gains an audience with the Architect. The Architect explains the origin and history of The One to them as well as their purpose, after which he presents The One a choice: enter the door leading to the

   The One is subtly blackmailed by the Architect to enter the Source door by being informed that Zion is going to be destroyed, as happens approximately every 100 years,
   and therefore, if The One enters the Source door, they may pick twenty-three humans from within the Matrix to rebuild and repopulate Zion, thus saving humanity from extinction. If The One fails to enter the door to the Source, the Architect warns that the

  <p key="138e8a00-8bd3-40da-82aa-6d63cfcd74b8">
   Neo, as with his predecessors, discovers that the Oracle's

    prophecy
   </a>
   is a fabrication: a form of control by the Machines in order to steer The One to the Source (or, in the case of the Architect, a representative of the Source) in order for him to procure the Prime Program and reboot the Matrix to stabilise it at 100% perfection. Neo then deduces one of two things from this discovery: either no one told him the truth of The One's and humanity's fate, or nobody knows, because The One never returns to inform humanity of the truth of the destruction and rebuilding cycle every century.
  </p>
  <p key="ccbf4e0f-4fe7-4aad-82cd-7f9033cd4c17">
   However, the Oracle during Neo's iteration as The One has decided to end the cycle. She does this by subtly altering The One's pre-conditioned attachment to humanity, necessary for the "Messiah" purpose, by focusing this attachment on a particular individual instead, with the goal of ensuring The One

  </p>
  <p key="b93a6abe-9859-4f97-8cd5-0635e6ff709c">
   The Architect, upon explaining Neo's background and purpose as The One, also acknowledges the altered attachment of The One to humanity by revealing to Neo that Trinity entered the Matrix to ensure he would meet the Architect, despite Neo requesting her not to in order to try and save her from death as he had foreseen, and comments on how "interesting" it is to watch Neo's reaction.
  </p>
  <p key="745acce6-ec94-47de-b6bb-7002ed86ba09">
   When Neo chooses to rescue Trinity rather than humanity in general, the Architect, as representative of the Machines, shows a hint of desperation over the possible failure of the plan to reset and stabilize the Matrix. He then reattempts to convince Neo to choose the Source door. However, Neo refuses and he proceeds to rescue Trinity.

   . He argues that Smith, who has completely taken over the Matrix by then, will eventually cause the Matrix to crash. This would kill all of humanity and would thereby deprive the Machines of their power source, wiping out both species from existence. He then states that he can destroy Smith and save both species, and all he wants in exchange is peace between the two races.
  </p>
  <p key="f1b58ad1-caa8-4ca1-a0e8-bba7e2e6b707">
   The Deus Ex Machina agrees to the terms and plugs Neo into the Matrix to fight Smith. With his new powers gained from taking over the Oracle, Smith appears to be stronger than Neo and he manages to seemingly defeat him, but while he gloats over his supposed victory, he repeats the Oracle's words, "Everything that has a beginning, has an end, Neo", a statement that makes Neo realise that he had been going about Smith's defeat all wrong and that his own defeat is actually the way to defeat Smith, his opposite, and he allows himself to be copied over by Smith.
  </p>
  <p key="0f7b3b96-7c20-4bb3-8564-01aba73deee7">
   This action gives the Machines an opportunity to destroy Smith through direct access to him via the new Neo-Smith clone, a chance the Deus Ex Machina does not hesitate to take by sending a power surge through Neo's body that destroys the Neo-Smith clone as well as all the other Smith clones, including the Oracle clone.
  </p>
  <p key="f00e1932-a4be-4884-a825-9ca41261e2ae">
   After Neo sacrifices himself and Smith is defeated, the Machines uphold the terms of the truce that Neo proposes, and the Machine War ends, with Zion saved from the brink of destruction, and the Matrix successfully reloaded, thus ensuring survival of both humanity and the Machines.

He also displayed this ability during the fight with the Smith clones and the Merovingian's henchmen, where he fought several opponents at once with ease.

     Superhuman Stamina:
    </b>
    The One can exert themselves for extended periods without tiring at all far more than anyone else within the Matrix can. Neo displayed this ability by being able to hold a fight against several Smith clones for a long time without tiring, retreating only because he was outnumbered beyond what he could fight off. However, even this ability had its limits, as Neo ended up completely exhausted after a period of fighting Oracle-Smith.

    The One can handle physical damage that would kill a normal Redpill. Neo demonstrated this ability by stopping a sword strike with a hand, suffering only a small cut in the process. He also survived being slammed into the ground from a high altitude by Smith, an action which a normal Redpill would not have survived. Even before awakening as the One, Neo showed at least some degree of superhuman durability, as he continued to keep on fighting even when suffering severe blows from Smith that were potent enough to force him him vomit up blood, as well as narrowly survive lightning-fast and repeated punches late into the battle, both of which would have killed an ordinary man.

     Inner Sight:
    </b>
    The One has a kind of "inner sight", which gives them the ability to see the Matrix in its true form, that of green, luminous lines of code, enabling them to see things others would not ordinarily see, such as hidden explosives. This also allowed The One to sense hidden ambushes well before they occur. This was best demonstrated during the Crisis Meeting, where Neo abruptly left the meeting due to sensing an arriving presence (heavily implied to be Smith), as well as him sensing Agents Thompson, Jackson, and Johnson just outside the door and barely warning Corrupt and Wyrm of their arrival and ordering for an end to the meeting as a result just before they kicked down the door.

    , which Neo demonstrated by stopping bullets in mid-air as well as when he drew Sais to him while fighting the Merovingian's henchmen. The One can even destroy Agents using this ability, as Neo did to Agent Smith in

   Mobil Avenue
   . He also demonstrates an enhanced "inner sight" that extends to the Real World, allowing him to see Machines, Machine-built landscapes and other entities endowed or empowered with Machine programming in a yellow, luminous light. He displays this ability after being blinded by
