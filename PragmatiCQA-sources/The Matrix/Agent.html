   Agents typically appeared as Caucasian males with brown hair, and dressed formally to greatly resemble and appear to possess governmental authority similar to
   Secret Service
   ,
   FBI
   ,
   NSA
   , or
   CIA
   government officials. Their general attire were dark green suits with gold lining, dark green ties, communication earpieces, square sunglasses, and white dress shirts. This created an ordinary, if somewhat out-of-place, appearance.
  </p>
  <p key="12f602e7-20af-40bb-80a7-7ed80e518115">
   Agents appeared to be human but collectively lacked a substantive personality, and so normally worked in trios where one Agent had a more defined personality for discussions with or interrogations of

   They do not carry badges or identification of any kind, and seem to just automatically and naturally inherit authority in any situation and from the perspective of any bluepill.

  <p key="92c60496-a210-481f-b124-815ae77af55b">
   The Agents were also assisted by a hidden system, through the eyes of numerous programs and bluepills alike, that continuously monitored the
   <i key="1310f5cd-975a-4969-a7cb-0e0e208ec49f">
    Matrix
   </i>
   for aberrations and anomalies. An example of this tactical advantage was when a homeless man spotted Morpheus

   . The homeless man's heightened reactions alone were enough to trip the system, tipping off Agent Smith of their whereabouts. Another example was when an Agent, without being in proximity of the anomaly, was alerted by the hidden system about a "haunted" house which, in truth, had a programming glitch which skewed and suspended the laws of physics.

   and who, therefore, could not be directly possessed. Zion operatives who were discovered by an Agent usually only had the option to flee, with it being common knowledge that death awaited anyone and everyone who tried to stand their ground against an Agent. An Agent's programming also allowed them to bend or break the laws of physics just like trained redpills, but to a much greater degree. And should a redpill be fortunate enough to defeat an Agent, the victory would only be short-lived as the Agent would simply possess another body within the

   to resurrect. When an Agent possessed a new body, their sidearm, clothing and general appearance were all carried over as well,
   a procedure continued with the replication of each Smith clone.
   And considering how Agents could freely call upon their comrades, they cultivated a fearsome reputation as relentless and nigh-invincible killers.

  <p key="433bf564-6fcf-44c4-99ae-9a887bdc9753">
   An Agent's primary sidearm was usually the Desert Eagle chambered in

   . Their aim was incredibly accurate, demonstrated when Agent Smith was able to track and shoot

   to an even greater degree than the original Agents, possessing increased stamina and speed, greater strength, and much faster reaction times. Neo immediately realized the nature of upgraded Agents when Johnson was able to block one of his punches. Though, even with their enhancements and while proving to be significantly more powerful than their previous iterations, the upgraded Agents were still completely outmatched by The One and seemed to not present any more of a threat than their predecessors. For example, just as Agent Smith failed to hit Neo upon realizing he was The One,
   so too did Agent Johnson fail to land any attack on Neo.
   In both cases, Neo blocked all of the respective Agent's attacks, countering their blows without any real effort, and all with one arm behind his back.

   However, upgraded Agents significantly proved to be even more serious threats to all other redpills. Trinity, while trying to save Neo and Morpheus, was outmatched and nearly killed by Thompson until Neo himself ultimately saved her. Even Morpheus, despite his best efforts and his elite fighting abilities, was eventually overpowered by Agent Johnson.

    In addition to their superhuman abilities, Agents were automatically programmed with astounding martial arts skills in a wide variety of forms. Compared to their redpill opponents however, Agents do not utilise their martial arts skills very often, preferring to rely on their superior physical attributes to gain the edge in hand-to-hand combat. That said, Agents will readily use advanced martial arts moves against their more stubborn and skilled opponents who refuse to back down such as in the case of Agent Smith and Neo. The Upgraded Agents take this to new heights as they demonstrate a more flawless and equally balanced blend of both martial arts moves and superhuman physicality in their confrontations with Neo and Morpheus.
