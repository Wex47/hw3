   is a device that is implemented as an extravehicular component granting the capability of flight and agile maneuverability.

   A hoverpad typically consisted of a circular, domal platform which presumably generated an electromagnetic field strong enough to suspend an object above ground causing flight. Hoverpads, when activated, would emit a fluctuating humming sound and produced luminous electrical currents along its surface.

   . It was a completely new technology which took the world by storm as it practically eliminated the need for wheeled and winged transportation. The humans used these hoverpads in their
