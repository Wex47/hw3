   as a training simulation. The program allows
   redpills
   to explore their ability to manipulate certain parameters of physics (rules) within the Matrix. The Jump Program is similar to the
   Sparring Program
   in that trainees can explore the rules of physics, but a psychological barrier of the fear of falling has been added.Certain physical constants such as gravity, density and velocity are maintained, but other physical laws are altered to make the program suitable as a training environment.  The street floor is programmed to negate high-speed impact, making failure a painful - but not fatal - experience.

   The  Jump Program is a simple urban city consisting of high-rise buildings separated by paved city streets to allow the user(s) to practice jumping from building to building.
