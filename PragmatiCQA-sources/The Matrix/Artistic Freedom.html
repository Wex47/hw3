   Raven, sporting a dark gothic look, was unbothered by the effects her creations had on people. In fact, she seemed to enjoy seeing people react to her work and excused herself as merely being an artist, having no responsibility to hold the hands of those who were disturbed by her work.

   Kitt promptly reported her closing bits and how that night's opening was by invitation only. She then shoved her very own pass in front of the camera for the world to see. At this point, the talented young boy extended his hand towards the TV screen and, magically, was now holding Kitt's ticket. The segment ended with the shocked correspondent looking at her now empty hand.
  </p>
  <p key="7eceaa62-5a26-4c2a-9b16-7c589ec58500">
   The boy carefully examined the pass. And then, closely placing it in front of him, read through its underlying
   code
   . Then the next moment, the boy was standing in front of Hednet Gallery, staring towards the entrance.
  </p>
  <p key="943acae6-d050-4adf-b447-e7ae074ed54b">
   The boy then entered the gallery, presenting the pass to the guard at the entrance. Inside the gallery, the frazzled Kitt was still searching for her disappearing ticket while her cameraman, already wanting to move on and get some appetizers, was telling her not to worry about it. Likewise, the mother and child who were interviewed earlier, with the child still crying, pleading her mom to take her home, were ready to move along and were heading for the exit. Raven, standing before one of her works, a massive and life-sized sculpture of a
   docbot
   , was commenting about how she liked such honest responses as they were sure to promote her work. And among the audience standing behind the sculpture, a woman was raising her hand poised to ask Raven a few more questions.

  <p key="380fc457-91ae-419d-a186-29ee0a0021c3">
   The woman asked about the Machines Raven called "Somnicultos", or sleep guardians, and the inspiration behind them. And thus Raven started telling everyone about her

   connected to a brightly lit

   . Of how she smelled the hot machinery, and how she saw the Somnicultos caring for her and many more humans sleeping in similar pods like hers, all connected to the power plant. Then moving to a smaller yet still massive sculpture of a

   Eyeing the young boy who was carefully assessing her works, Raven approached to ask his thoughts about it when, suddenly, a clanking sound was heard behind her. Looking back, she was surprised to see her sculptures coming to life, their machinery humming. The Somnicultos, now able to move, started killing Kitt and her camera man, then the woman from the audience, and then everyone else. Raven, terrified, sprinted to the exit and out towards the streets and where the destruction quickly spilled. Not knowing what was happening as the surrounding people, vehicles, and buildings were all razed, she hears a nearby phone booth ringing. She picked up only to hear some warning. It said that it was not enough to believe what she saw but that she also needed to understand it.
