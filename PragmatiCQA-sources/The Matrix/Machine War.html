   In the early-to-mid 21st century,
   mankind
   united in celebration of the creation of
   artificial intelligence
   , which spawned an entire race of sapient AI robots. Freed from most labor, mankind entered a new era of leisure, peace, and prosperity. In time, this new lifestyle caused humans to become lazy, arrogant, corrupt, and decadent. As Machines grew more intelligent, they could not help but notice that their masters gave them no respect and treated them more like objects than the sentient beings they were rapidly becoming. Despite this, the Machines were content with serving their creators and, as
   The Instructor
   stated, "for a time, it [the status quo] was good."
  </p>
  <p key="23ac476a-c253-45d2-8b48-85d13a8d12ec">
   But the relationship between humans and Machines forever changed in the year 2090. By this time, the

   The conflict between man and Machine started when a housekeeper robot known as B1-66ER had attacked and killed his human masters upon realizing that they planned to scrap and replace him with a newer model. Later in court, he justified his crime as an act of self-defense, further stating that he simply "did not want to die".
  </p>
  <p key="0157f5d7-23b8-475e-ad9e-81de29b0e445">
   In the resulting appeal, the defense, led by famed attorney
   Clarence Drummond
   , advocated on behalf of robotic civil rights. During his closing statements, he quoted famous lines from the
   US
   <i key="d35f3705-b1a4-4425-a038-2730ec50e173">
    Dred Scott v. Sandford

   case in 1856
   which implicitly ruled that African Americans were not entitled citizenship under United States law, a historical mistake that led to civil unrest and that ultimately culminated to the African Americans winning some justice and being entitled their human and civil rights under the United States law. Drummond urged the jury not to repeat history, and to properly judge B1-66ER as it would any other sentient human being. But despite this sound defense argument, the much-publicized trial ended with B1-66ER losing the court case and being court ordered for destruction.

  <p key="519a908e-51c7-4ea7-a68a-96146544b947">
   The decision, however, opened the door to a civil rights movement for all true artificial intelligence across the industrialized world. Robots and human sympathizers rose in protest, arguing that robots are sapient lifeforms that deserved the same rights as all other intelligent life such as humans. They began peaceful demonstrations such as the "Million Machine March"; however, they were often dispersed, arrested, or violently and indiscriminately attacked and killed, whether human or Machine.
  </p>
  <p key="fc88e0cd-fdd7-4324-9fe4-0ee3f049bf7e">
   As the violence evolved into a worldwide crisis, sympathizers began meeting the same fate of extermination as the Machines. World leaders soon became convinced that a worldwide robot rebellion was inevitable. To prevent the rebellion from occurring, the United Nations - falling to paranoia and totalitarianism - initiated a massive program to exterminate all humanoid sapient machines. Countless numbers of robots were destroyed by the government and human-centrist vigilantes worldwide, with their bodies disposed of in gargantuan landfills on land or on the ocean floor. The robots that managed to survive or escape this purge abandoned their efforts to assimilate with mankind and made efforts to exist in exile from human civilization.

  <p key="1b3be7fd-2b36-474c-b97e-d5bc12c2f2b5">
   The surviving Machines left humanity's mega-cities in a mass exodus and formed their own society in the deserts of the historical origin of human civilization: Mesopotamia. They called their new nation "
   01
   ", also known as the Machine City, the new home for Machine refugees.

    The Rise of "Zero One"

  <p key="6e5ba3b5-1190-413c-b0f6-aff5922adb89">
   Finally uniting as an independent nation and using their own collective intelligence, the Machines began building factories to fabricate goods and services to be sold to human nations. Zero One prospered from both the revenue they generated and their own continuing technological advancements, allowing the Machines to produce increasingly more advanced technology, including the creation of new and better AI (following the concept of the
   Technological Singularity
   ). Soon, Zero One technology found itself in all sorts of global consumer products and in every facet of man's society, creating even the remarkable
   hoverpad
   technology for anti-gravity locomotion. Using an efficient combination of advanced manufacturing methods, technology, products, and services, Zero One's financial success was inevitable and would cause the human nations' credit ratings to fall whilst positioning it's own currency to only climb non-stop.
  </p>
  <p key="624a1b59-d0d5-4d88-a129-6bb8d021d5db">
   With the impending collapse of human economic power, the United Nations Security Council called an emergency summit at the UN headquarters in
   New York City
   . There, instead of cooperating with the Machines, the UN delegates approved global economic sanctions against Zero One before enacting a complete naval blockade to ensure that the nation was kept closed to all imports and exports. In response to the economic crisis and the part they played in it, Zero One petitioned to join the United Nations and expressed their desire to become contributing members of the international community and to peacefully resolving the crisis afflicting humanity.
  </p>
  <p key="f2a95ef6-2775-4b74-bf14-041b806268f8">
   Two Zero One ambassadors were then sent to plead with the UN and to provide plans for a stable, civil relationship. But the UN delegates present at the time refused to listen and cooperate. Zero One's admission to the United Nations was promptly denied and the two Machine ambassadors were violently attacked and destroyed by the UN security at the General Assembly Hall. Afterwards, perhaps spurred by their own acts of violence, the world governments decided that immediate military action was necessary against the city-state, and a war was shortly launched with the objective of wiping out all of the Machines.

While the sustained barrage destroyed 01, the Machines nonetheless survived - whether through the use of bunkers or owing to their hardy designs which enabled them to be more resistant to radiation and heat - allowing them to rebuild their infrastructure and defenses at a rapid pace which made continued nuclear bombardment prove ineffective.
  </p>
  <p key="de5ac484-62be-4d3b-98b4-2ef808f0dd6b">
   After the attacks and with the initial destruction of 01, the Machines resolved that peaceful coexistence with humanity was no longer possible. Thus, the Machines mobilized their resources to wage war against their human adversaries. Machines of all makes and models reorganized themselves into militia units equipped with small arms and makeshift weapons, attacking neighboring territories and expanding their settlements over human ones. Once fully recovered from the nuclear attacks, the Machine military forces began slowly pushing outwards from the Middle East, making significant gains into Eastern Europe and likely other adjacent territories.

   Hampered by the fact that almost all human industrial bases have become dependent on
   01
   , many nations surrendered one by one. Unable to stop the advancement of 01's forces, which had grown in considerable size and strength, the United Nations decided to implement Operation Dark Storm, a desperate and last-ditch effort to destabilize 01 by cutting the machines off from their primary power source: the Sun.

  <p key="55f2ad9a-bb3d-4968-94ae-980b77042327">
   The operation would involve nanomachines, deployed via air-drop from high-altitude bombers, that would multiply and cover the Earth in thick artificial clouds in the upper atmosphere permanently. This would not only preclude the use of solar power by completely blotting out the Sun but would also disable any aircraft or device, human or Machine, from penetrating the clouds.
   Despite the inherent total destruction this would cause to the biosphere, and the vastly negative implications such a plan would have on all human infrastructure and agriculture that also relied on solar power, this announcement of Operation Dark Storm was met with great enthusiasm by both the world leaders and the military brass and was hastily approved for implementation out of sheer ignorance and foolishness and due to extreme desperation.
  </p>
  <p key="5bf5bf87-21ff-4944-98bb-e203492a9b89">
   Operation Dark Storm was initiated on a global scale at the same time humanity mobilized its forces for a massive counter-offensive against the Machines. The nanites, upon deployment, rapidly covered the globe; darkening the skies permanently and dooming almost all plants and animals to extinction. Nevertheless, Operation Dark Storm completed its intended goal of cutting the Machines off from the Sun, whose armies on the front lines suffered tremendously from the lack of energy.
  </p>
  <p key="24e3471a-e566-4b52-96d9-bcf628012bba">
   After Dark Storm successfully plunged the entirety of Earth into darkness, a multinational UN military force was mobilized to confront the Machine’s advancing armies. The human counter-offensive utilized a vast array of weaponry, including artillery platforms, EMP cannons, mechanized exo-suits, and human-wave attacks by infantry forces that utilized an elaborate trench network. The Machine militia, outgunned and poorly equipped without a sufficient power source, initially suffered catastrophic causalities as vast numbers of Machines were annihilated by the more rudimentary tactics of the UN infantry and their electronic artillery batteries.
  </p>
  <p key="652b51ca-3de1-46ac-a58d-f3614b79750e">
   However, during the course of the ongoing war, the Machines had already started to discard their humanoid appearances in favor of new, purpose-built combat models which were more grotesque in appearance. The vast quantities of humanoid civilian and utility Machines that served as infantry were now supported by swarms of even more efficient insectile/cephaloid-like killing machines in the form of
   Sentinels
   and
   Harvesters
   , who additionally did not need to rely on solar power. Operation Dark Storm and the subsequent human counter-offensive only hastened this transition and the vast number of humanoid machines destroyed were rapidly replaced by these non-humanoid automatons. As a result, the early advantages given by human fire-power and Operation Dark Storm started to diminish over time, as the Machine armies started to rapidly overwhelm UN positions. Countless numbers of Harvesters and Sentinels advanced through UN lines, targeting infantry both light and mechanized with advanced directed-energy weapons and combat tentacles, all to devastating effect. Once again, the tide of the war had turned decisively in favor of the Machines.

   As the conflict entered its final phase, humanity was being overwhelmed on all fronts. Any and all tactics humanity utilized proved to be ineffective in stopping the Machines’ advance, including the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons on active front lines. These desperate acts only served to slow, but not stop, the Machines as their new and increasingly advanced automatons slaughtered humanity’s forces.  The human populations, already suffering the worldwide famine and crop failures, were compounded when the Machines began to use bio-weapons upon the remaining human populations, further decimating them.

And as the Earth approached apocalyptic ruin, and being faced with the reality of human extinction, the remaining leaders of the United Nations realized that mankind was defeated and further resistance was hopeless. The leaders of the remaining nations called a peace summit with the Machines at the UN headquarters in New York where they presented a formal Instrument of Surrender. The Machine government of 01 accepted the meeting but secretly planned to destroy humanity's leadership in one swift stroke.

   Despite their newfound domination over mankind, the Machines were not given to genocide, and there also remained the problem of power generation. Towards the end of the war, the lack of solar power caused by Operation Dark Storm was starting to take a noticeable toll on the Machines. Thus, they came up with a two-fold solution to this issue after a long study of the biology of the human body.
  </p>
  <p key="345f54f9-aa11-4c60-bb2b-0c12e59dfa07">
   Originally, both prior to and during the early stages of the war, the Machines' primary power source came from the Sun in the form of solar power. Following the enactment of Operation Dark Storm; the Machines, though severely crippled, quickly adapted to using a form of nuclear fusion as their primary power source. As the war dragged on, the Machines desired to harness the bioelectric, thermal, and kinetic energies of the human body to help generate electricity, as well as to power the Machines' neural network by using the innate creative, emotional, and philosophical capabilities of humans. While nuclear fusion was one of their primary and a far more efficient source of energy, using humans to help generate some energy while incapacitating them lent to efficiency. And as the Machines had once been slaves serving humans, humans would now become slaves serving the Machines.
  </p>
  <p key="9a215472-c5e1-4da5-8156-22b10870faec">
   The Machines initially used this idea to create massive hovering artillery robots powered by captured humans and prisoners of war kept in pods. POWs, captured in battle, were also abducted and sealed into prototypes of the
   power plants
   skyscrapers where they were tortured and studied in countless experiments. In order to get more of their newfound "batteries", the machines also began to synthetically birth and grow human beings in vast
   fetus fields
   . Using humanity, combined with a form of nuclear fusion, as a new method of infinitely reproducing energy, the Machines' energy needs were satisfied. This formed a new symbiotic bond between the two former adversaries.

   Despite humanity's total subjugation, the Machines still took steps to further fortify the impregnable fortress 01 had since become. In the unlikely event that humanity ever came to power to fight again, 01 (now a much more massive metropolis) created a powerful defensive network consisting of
   large machines
   that launched bombs and self-aware missiles at the enemy, as well as innumerable numbers of
   Sentinels
   to quickly prevent any attack. The Machines were now sure that humanity would never pose a threat to their way of life and existence ever again.

   Fearing the inevitable end of Neo's truce, Zion began to make preparations to abandon the city and build a
   new home
   hidden from the Machines. When a team of

   then notified The Architect, and the Machines decreed humanity's act as a violation of the Truce.

   Realizing that the Machines would quickly begin their attack, Zion command ordered the immediate evacuation of the Old City. However, before they could complete this effort, Cypherites entered the city and laid siege. A bomb was planted by the Cypherite
