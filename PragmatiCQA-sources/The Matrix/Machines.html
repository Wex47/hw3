   In the early 21st century, the human race invented true artificial intelligence and installed it into their technology to become a slave caste for all Human menial labor. This inadvertently gave birth to a new race of being henceforth known as 'the machines'. The machines performed menial labor jobs, service jobs, and dangerous manual labor tasks.

   They sold this technology to humans and a tenuous peace prevailed. However, Zero One’s growing influence in the global economy caused it to become destabilized, devaluing human labor and currency. In response, the humans imposed an economic blockade to isolate Zero One. Ambassadors from Zero One presented their economic solutions as well as requests for admission into the United Nations and for the machines to be recognized as intelligent life. However, Zero One’s admission to the UN was denied and the ambassadors were likely destroyed.

Though humanity gained the upper hand for the time, they would eventually be overrun by Zero One’s newer and more sinister war machines, and the machines devised methods to prolong human suffering during the war.
