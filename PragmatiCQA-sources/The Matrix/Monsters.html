   Based on the comments and behaviors of the Architect, Persephone, and the Merovingian, it is strongly suggested that the Architect used virtual monsters to frighten the inhabitants of the earlier versions of the Matrix. Given that the Merovingian has kept these monster programs with him and in check, it is probable that the Merovingian may have had some part in the creation of the second failed attempt at a stabilized Matrix, or at least was around at the time of its activation. The Merovingian's age ("One of the oldest of us") is confirmed by the Oracle as part of her instructions to Neo on how to retrieve the Keymaker
