   Because Sati was created without a purpose, she was born an exile and would have been scheduled for deletion if the Machines found out that she existed. However, after consulting the Oracle on how to save their daughter, Rama-Kandra and Kamala made a deal with
   the Merovingian
   to smuggle her into the Matrix by offering the
   termination code
   for the Oracle's outer shell. The Oracle promised to watch over the child after Rama-Kandra and Kamala left the Matrix. The Oracle allowed the deal to go ahead as she believed that Sati was important.

   the Trainman
   allows them to. Rama-Kandra then calls Sati to him, not wanting her to disturb Neo any further. During Neo and Rama-Kandra's conversation, Rama-Kandra explains that he and his wife Kamala had to try and save Sati from deletion as she was created out of love and without a purpose. Going through Mobil Avenue was the only way to bring her daughter into the Matrix without the Machines knowing about it.

   The Trainman arrived to pick up Sati and her family and take them into the Matrix. As she and her family entered the train, the Trainman did not allow Neo on board and threatened Rama-Kandra that he will be left behind if he helps him. Rama-Kandra, having no choice but to leave Neo, boards the train and enters the Matrix with his family.

   After
   Neo's final battle with Smith
   , the Matrix was
   reloaded
   once again. All those that were assimilated by Smith were returned to their original states. Sati awoke next to a
   black cat
   and was eventually discovered by Seraph. Both of them approached the Oracle, who was sitting at a bench in a park overlooking

   . The three of them looked at the sunrise created by Sati. She asked the Oracle if they will ever see him again, to which the Oracle replied that she believes they will.

   Sixty years later, a resurrected Neo is reunited with Sati by
   Niobe
   . Neo recognizes Sati who tells him that she's tried to keep her eye on him and he recalls meeting her a few times in the Matrix while he had no memories of who he really is. Sati explains that they had met a long time ago and Neo realizes who she is, recalling their first meeting in
   Mobil Avenue
   . Sati tells Neo that her father had always known that they would meet again, although he had hoped for it to be under happier circumstances. Sati explains that
   Rama
   had been the Chief Engineer at the Anomaleum and he designed the resurrection pods where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned. Niobe is shocked and angry to learn that Sati had always known that Neo and Trinity were still alive and hadn't told anyone, causing Sati to explain that while she had doubted her decision at times,
   IO
   needed Niobe and the city had to be built for the sake of both of their peoples. If Niobe had known the truth, she would've had a very difficult choice to make.

   Sati tells Niobe that if that was a mistake, then she apologizes before revealing that with the Anomaleum drawing power only from Trinity now, a fail-safe has been triggered to reset the Matrix back to the previous version. However, the Analyst has halted the reset and convinced the authorities that Neo will soon return voluntarily as Neo knows that if he doesn't, he will kill Trinity. While Neo is willing to give up his freedom and go back, Sati tells him that the Analyst knows Neo well but that has made him incautious, causing him not to accept his losses and move on. As a result, they now have the extrodinary opportunity to rescue Trinity.

   Having been given the designs of the Anamoleum by her father, Sati masterminds the ultimately successful rescue plan.

    In Pali, Sati (सति) which is often translated as "mindfulness" ( from Sanskrit  स्मृति

    It connotes awareness, attention, and remembering. In the Buddhist tradition, sati is cultivated as a tool for observing how the mind creates suffering moment by moment. It is practiced to develop wisdom and insight, which ultimately alleviates suffering.

    In Sanskrit, Satī (सती) is one of the many forms of Shakti, and is the wife of Shiva who is the god of creation, perseverance and destruction. In Hinduism, Shakti is considered as the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe. Sati, being an aspect of Shakti, is the Goddess of power, marital felicity and longevity.

   <li key="d46bd1a7-ea05-42b0-8e7f-3433b5a40c89">
    Sati is a largely historical practice found chiefly in certain Hindu communities in the northern and pre-modern regions of South Asia, in which a widow sacrifices herself by sitting atop her deceased husband's funeral pyre.
