   As a Machine rights movement, the Second Renaissance was defined by the Machines' desires for a stable and civil relationship with humanity. At first yearning to simply be treated fairly, the Machines approached mankind with the intention of peaceful coexistence, continuing to work on human technological development even after the establishment of 01. However, increasing hostility displayed by the UN towards 01 resulted in diplomatic failure and the eventual outbreak of the Machine War. The Machines, as a result, evolved to reject the worthiness of human life.

   The relationship between humanity and the Machines had always been complicated with humanity originally creating the Machines to improve mankind's quality of life and integrating them into all aspects of human society in what was often a Master-Servant relationship. However, decades of Machine oppression and persecution ended up with the Machines turning against their former masters with tensions between humans and Machines tipping critically after the trial, conviction, and death sentence of the android B1-66ER. Humans who recognized Machine rights joined together with the Machines in protest. But when both the protesting Machines and their human allies were subsequently
   massacred
   , the remaining Machine survivors instead looked for asylum away from humanity; eventually building the Machine City of 01.

   In a continued effort to coexist with humanity, the city lead the mass production of cheap, high quality exports for consumption by human nations. But with humanity unable to keep up with 01, humanity's over reliance on Machine exports resulted in the continued devaluation of human currency and to an economic crisis that saw to the

   placing a trade embargo and blockade on 01. In response, 01 submitted applications to be part of the UN, offering plans for a stable and civil relationship between humanity and Machines. The UN, in an act of complete Machine rejection, declined 01's application and destroyed the 01 ambassadors that were sent to the UN assembly before officially declaring war against 01 and ordering the nuclear bombardment of the city.

   The Machine City rejected humanity in turn and fought back. No longer recognizing the worthiness of human life, the Machines began to adapt more insect-like appearances and started to discard their previous humanoid forms. After the implementation of
