   are virtually placed into a coma, having no awareness of any events during the possession. Bluepills left alive after a possession are simply confused after returning to consciousness, sometimes badly injured.

   Should an avatar be killed while possessed, only the bluepill originally owning the avatar dies, leaving the corpse to revert to its original RSI. The Agent previously possessing the avatar simply jumps to possess another body.

   began to use a method of possession that may have been derived from his old Agent ability to possess bluepills. His method was much more direct; a Smith avatar would force its hand into the RSI of his intended victim, and release a black substance that would slowly overtake the victim RSI and, once completely covered, convert the avatar into another Smith.
