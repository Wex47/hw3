    Union Hill
   </b>
   was a neighborhood located on the north-eastern side of
   <a href="Downtown.html" key="a063e167-1e58-4d23-b8c5-eab3fd6064f9" title="Downtown">
    Downtown
   </a>
   . It was located next to
   Baldwin Heights
   and below
   Stratford Campus
   . It was the oldest neighborhood in this district, which originally housed a fort, which has already disappeared. Despite the local gang, the neighborhood had a reputation for being a decent place to live. However, no ambitious worker would want to be caught dead living there, for its addition reputation for being a second rate address.

   The residing contact is
   the Auditor
   , while the local gang call themselves The
   Hellions
   .
