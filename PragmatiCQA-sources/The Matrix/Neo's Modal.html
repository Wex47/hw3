    Neo's Modal
   </b>
   is a modal experiment created by
   <a href="Neo.html" key="ce0f6bde-5454-44b8-9b29-20d4ed079060" title="Neo">
    Neo
   </a>
   , based upon his suppressed memories. The Modal recreates part of
   <a href="Mega City.html" key="e8a854f2-9b63-4c04-bf3e-277e331870fa" title="Mega City">
    Mega City
   </a>
   and several of its inhabitants, though it does carry some distinct differences: a key shop is present in the Modal that leads to
   backdoor
   access to four areas within the Modal, and several of its inhabitants display slight to significant differences with their original counterparts.

   Neo's Modal was created as an experiment by Neo, based upon a scenario in which several elements of the original attempt to capture
   <a href="Trinity.html" key="3ce0e2c8-cc38-4402-b22b-c93d64276b37" title="Trinity">
    Trinity
   </a>
   at the

    Heart O' The City Hotel
   </a>
   have been changed - some elements are small, while some are much more significant. For instance,
   Agent Brown
   has been replaced with
   Agent White
   , and
   Agent Smith
   has been reinterpreted as an amalgam of
   <a href="Agent Smith.html" key="1092a654-c36f-46ef-8d4d-521ffbb82021" title="Agent Smith">
    Agent Smith
   </a>
   and
   <a href="Morpheus.html" key="2e317cb1-a7e5-4f5f-a5be-278628151006" title="Morpheus">
    Morpheus
   </a>
   . The Modal contains only a few key areas from Mega City: the Heart O' The City Hotel, the
   Lafayette Hotel
   , a theatre, Thomas Anderson's Apartment, and a key shop.
  </p>
  <p key="947b5c5f-c8bc-48ff-b569-75c36280aee2">
   The Modal is discovered by
   <a href="Bugs.html" key="6c785377-b1a4-46d7-91da-4a26809f5cf7" title="Bugs">
    Bugs
   </a>
   and
   Sequoia
   , and Bugs infiltrates it. Inside the Modal, the events surrounding the attempted capture of
   <a href="Trinity.html" key="9335a28f-b50c-4773-85c4-2e7ddd406584" title="Trinity">
    Trinity
   </a>
   unfold differently. Trinity successfully defeats the SWAT team as the original events dictated, but Trinity is unable to escape the Agents as they lay a trap to ambush her during her attempted escape. Bugs is spotted by Smith, who orders the police to kill her. Bugs escapes into the Key Shop to evade the Agents, but Smith is able to use the backdoors to ambush and drag Bugs into Thomas Anderson's apartment, where it is revealed that, despite Thomas Anderson's apartment existing, no other evidence of his existence is present within the Modal. Smith declares that he knows something is wrong with the world, and delcares himself to be Morpheus. Morpheus takes the Red Pill, and he and Bugs escape the Modal before the Agents can kill them by diving into an exit situated in the Lafayette Hotel's skylight.

   Neo spots an intruder in the modal and investigates but can't find the perpetrator. Later, Neo's Modal is wiped, alongside all data and assets within it, presumably by
   the Analyst
   . Bugs later realizes that Neo had purposefully left the Modal open so that someone could find and free Morpheus from it.
