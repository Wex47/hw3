   Also interesting is the Smith-assimilated Seraph's exclamation, "Cookies need love like everything does" (Although this is quoting Sati, she has learned of cookies through The Oracle) (Perhaps that phrase is pronounced by Smith-assimilated Sati, instead, it's more logical). This is of interest in that cookies were believed to be important in the relationship between The Oracle and Neo, or The One. Food is known for its transfer of information in the

   and it is believed that The Oracle's cookies were used for transferring important information to Neo, possibly the programming which makes Neo 'The One'.

   Furthermore, in support of Seraph's possible previous incarnation as The One, it is known that particular humans can be rebirthed in the

   that both she and Neo (and discernibly all other The Ones) were an accumulation of decades of Machine research into translating human DNA perfectly into Machine code, allowing them to interface directly with technology without the need for simulated interfaces. This program was called The

   In compliance with the above information, it is implied that Seraph once worked for The Merovingian, which would be fitting if he was reborn in the

   through TBI, Seraph would have 're-materialized' at Mobil Avenue (the train station), the departing from which reaching was only possible by riding the train. The train was run by the train master and the train master was under the control of The Merovingian. Ultimately, Seraph would have been led to The Merovingian, leading to his working for The Merovingian.
