   Hovercraft seem to contain a mixture of old and modern equipment and have a dubious quality of assembly. This might be explained by the fact that humanity assembled their ships from the remains of their destroyed world.
  </p>
  <p key="397646e9-a989-4cf4-b25c-c50f0dcb862b">
   Hovercraft "fly" using
   pad
   technology
   that apparently leverages magnetism to form levitation. While hovercraft can practically fly, the Zion operatives that crew these ships are generally conducting operations below ground within the ancient sewers and tunnels that formed the underground of the old destroyed human cities, away from

   .
  </p>
  <p key="31e2e0aa-6902-486c-a77a-32360fcd7214">
   Hovercraft appear to be electrically powered
   , using batteries or other source that allows operations for several weeks if not months. Hovercraft can also perform limited repairs if they happen to be damaged by the environment or are damaged by Machine forces, however all Hovercraft ultimately need to return to Zion for a full resupply and complete repairs.
  </p>
  <p key="3eaf28c6-38d8-4505-a870-58bb16beea38">
   Hovercraft are also quite heavily armored despite their considerable speed and maneuverability, as demonstrated by the Nebuchadnezzar when its exterior armor and interior hull took several minutes for a patrol of Sentinels to cut through. Hovercrafts stronger and larger than the Nebuchadnezzar are expected to have stronger survival capabilities. Even the armored ships, however, have vulnerable external pads, cockpits and communication towers that can be breached or disabled by Sentinels if those fly too close. To actually destroy the ship, not just disable it, the Machines will either disrupt its core until it detonates, or use suicidal bombers.
  </p>
  <p key="8bd6d917-af23-4520-86ed-880c11ef181b">
   The interior of hovercraft is very limited in creature comforts. The environment is cold, sometimes damp, and cramped with little privacy. Crews often handle some sort of repair when not
   jacked in
   or resting. Food consists of a cold, protein soup that is aesthetically unpleasing but can be recycled endlessly aboard the ship.
  </p>
  <p key="083638ef-02d9-4bc3-8e3e-a5f778b2295e">
   In a section of the hovercraft is the
   operator
   console, where a series of chairs are available for redpills to perform their second duty: Freeing human minds from the grasp of the
   <i key="bccac2fb-e85f-42c3-b4df-f42e029d5ae6">

   . Each redpill sits in a chair and is strapped in for their own safety, where then a long data probe is inserted in their
   headjack
   . The operator is able to broadcast their mind's carrier and data signal into the

   A cockpit contains the flight controls as well as sensing devices to alert crews of approaching Machines. Hovercraft crews fear the

    Sentinels
   </a>
   that patrol the tunnels, which in groups can obliterate an unprepared hovercraft. While a few heavier hovercraft have sizable gun batteries able to fight off sentinels, (such as the Icarus and the Hammer) most hovercraft have only a few light guns and hand-held personal armaments. Hovercraft captains invariably prefer to keep undetected, hiding in access points and collapsed tunnels until the threat passes. It appears that Sentinels will not attack a ship that is landed and ready to use EMP, unless they can attack in waves.
  </p>
  <p key="14838cd6-1177-44c6-9e01-b2fda2925f37">
   If a hovercraft is sighted by a force of Sentinels, the crew attempts to flee and hide, but sometimes they are forced to use their weapon of last resort to deactivate the sentinels; the

   at the time of their discovery by sentinels; the Operator has a difficult choice with very little time to make it. He must retrieve all jacked-in crew before activating the EMP, otherwise, the pulse will not only destroy the sentinels, but disrupt the redpill's carrier signal, effectively killing them. Some bigger hovercrafts however had the option to buy time for their crew with their heavier weaponry, but ultimately still preferred to hide against the Machines.

   Every hovercraft captain is given access codes to Zion, which allow them to enter the city once given to the redpills plugged into the Zion mainframe.

  <p key="115f69db-21b9-45d1-a0b9-13fdd98aaee2">
   Sixty years later, hovercraft have much the same design, although they are now partially organic, presumably due to the alliance between the humans and Machines resulting in more advanced technology being available. At least some now have a combined human-Machine crew.
