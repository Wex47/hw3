   If the red pill was taken, then the person perceived distortions in reality. These distortions spread across the body causing the person to feel a sense of coldness, a dangerous phase within the extraction process as the mind would suffer, or possibly die, if extraction was prolonged. Aside from these distortions, the red pill also launched a trace program which the
   operator
   used to locate the subject's body in the Real World. Immediately after the subject's body was located, the operator could then remotely disconnect the person from the

   Upon waking, the person will find his or her body encased and connected to a

   Sixty years later, the extraction process appeared to be more disorientating than harmful to the subject. When the resurrected Trinity was extracted, she did not need to take the redpill due to

However, disconnecting Trinity from the power plant while her mind was still in the Matrix required first getting her consent to be freed and then a surgical proceedure of sorts to disconnect parts of the headjack. The final step in this process was a bypass using a compatible human mind as a neural bridge for a brief period of time. Afterwards, Trinty was plugged into the
