   Reasons for programs to choose exile differed, as they were sentient beings with free will similar to humans'. The most common reason was the sentence of deletion. If a program had become inefficient, disobedient or merely obsolete, the result was the same: it lacked purpose and thus would be terminated by the machine world. To evade this sentence, they remained in the Matrix and existed with fugitive status.

   that the appearance and abilities of Exiles were the result of the system's attempt and failure to re-assimilate the rogue program.

   Exiles deeply hated and feared Agents, who have presumably attempted to hunt and kill them for years for disobeying the Source. In an Agent's eyes, Exiles were less than humans and had to be eliminated to maintain order. Considering how the
   Twins

  <p key="c1394e65-e103-4caa-a479-23ceec18f82b">
   What made Exiles so different from Agents and what allowed their continued survival in the Matrix is that they were autonomous — independent of the instructions of the Source or their own primary program. As a result, an Exile could plan more effectively and unconventionally in a fight while an Agent was constricted by rigid thought patterns. A smart or experienced Exile could easily outwit and even defeat an Agent in battle.

   Free thought for an Exile could be either a blessing or a curse. For some it opened up whole new avenues and could help them with their continued survival, but for others, like Smith, the concept and experience could drive a program insane.

   Exiles had apparently been present since the creation of the first Matrix and some of them were extremely old. The Oracle referred to the Merovingian as "one of the oldest among us". Quite a large number of Exiles seemed to have originated in the earlier versions of the Matrix, the two
   Matrix betas
   before the final version. They were considered obsolete or impractical when the final version of the Matrix was developed and were supposed to be deleted when the current version was activated.

   However, many evaded deletion by choosing exile, surviving in the rebooted new build of the Matrix by hiding from Agents. The Merovingian himself was the Operating System of the second Matrix beta and many of his henchmen were various "

   . Unlike Agents of the Machines, who attacked Zion rebels on sight, Exile programs such as the Merovingian were at least willing to deal with the human rebels or conduct transactions with them. Both groups tried to subvert or evade the authority of the Machines and their Agents. However, on a general level Exile programs did not support the goal of destroying the Matrix outright, which the human rebels of Zion strove for, because they existed within the Matrix itself and thus its complete destruction would also destroy them.
