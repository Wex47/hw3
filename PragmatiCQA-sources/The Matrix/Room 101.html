   The number 101 also represents the customary Masonic lodge number. This number in Masonry represents the Temple of Solomon's two pillars, Baoz and Jachin, (1's) accompanied by the central Brazen Sea (0). Forming the "101", which literally symbolizes the entrance to the Holy of Holies, or figuratively signifies the beginning of one's esoteric and gnostic journey to self-actualization.

   101 can also be seen as a
   binary number
   , the 0s and 1s used by computers to store information. 101 is the binary representation of the number 5 (which, in computing, is the sixth number, as counting begins from 0). Some see symbolism in this, as the three films are set in the sixth iteration of the Matrix. Neo is the sixth person to be the One, Zion has been destroyed 5 times before, and so on.
