The game was released in Japan on December 14, 2006 and in North America on October 9, 2007, in addition to an Australian release on February 28, 2008 and a  European release on February 29, 2008. Although the anime outside Japan had not yet reached this point in the series, the game was a direct port of the Japanese version for American and European consumers, similar to the US release of the game.

   Players utilize the Wii remote and Nunchuck for this game. Although the player may utilize the Wii remote only, some abilities are unusable without the Nunchuck. Characters move around freely in a 3D environment and can move faster while holding the C button (initiates flash step movement applicable to some characters- Arturo, Yoruichi, Ichigo and Byakuya will zoom around the stage, appearing to almost teleport, because of their high speeds). As with traditional fighting games, the characters' health is represented by a gauge. A winner is decided when one of the gauges depletes completely. Below the health gauge is a
   <b key="90fddc4c-cfaf-48e5-9a86-b4137d356f21">
    Stamina Gauge
   </b>
   , which determines how often the player may attack. The gauge decreases as attacks are performed. If the gauge is depleted, no more attacks can be utilized, though it automatically refills itself fairly quickly.
  </p>
  <p key="65013b52-800f-40f9-88fb-3dc6db79a33c">
   Players attack by waving the Wiimote in various directions, which are split into three types: Slice (horizontal), Slash (vertical) and Stab (forward) Stronger attacks, known as
   <b key="3a3f0bb5-12ca-40b1-b585-284ff082e03a">
    Critical Attacks
   </b>
   are performed by holding down the A button whilst attacking. If two Critical Attacks clash together, then a
   <b key="1beae619-2d09-49f4-acff-1e0182f1d984">
    Clash

   occurs with a janken/rock-paper-scissors mini-game occurring, with the three options being the three basic Wiimote motions (Slice taking precedence over Slash, Slash over Stab, and Stab over Slice).
  </p>
  <p key="52c4798b-9a7e-40d5-bdc4-ab5460b2fe26">
   Whoever wins the most bets out of 5 unleashes a special attack, and its strength differs on how many bets are won. Additionally, if a player does not make their move for the clash at the correct time, they will automatically lose that bet unless the other player fails to do so as well, in which case the bet is a tie. Failing to move at the correct time renders the motion the player made irrelevant.
  </p>
  <p key="9b716af5-fe30-42f4-b9e8-29043f5bedf2">
   Special attacks are performed when holding the B button while swinging the remote. Each character is assigned to three different special attacks according to slash, slice and stab. Some attacks are melee-oriented while others serve as projectiles. However, special attacks deplete more of the Stamina Gauge than normal attacks, thus reducing the risk of spamming attacks.
  </p>
  <p key="e066667f-5ba6-4239-9028-b3213d5af2c7">
   At the bottom of the screen is the Bankai gauge. When the gauge fills up along with the ignition of the corresponding flame, the Bankai is ready for use. The gauge can be filled up by taking and receiving damage, or it can be charged up be shaking the Nunchunk repeatedly. The Bankai is activated upon shaking it once more. Depending on the character, new abilities and attacks will be granted to the player, including a super attack. Some characters however, gain a speed increase and special attack only due to the game's development at the time, thus characters such as Grimmjow or Shūhei do not gain special abilities upon activation but rather they temporarily gain a decent increase in their abilities and a couple of new attacks.

   After three more opponents he finds Ichigo, who is collecting the shards to return to the Human world, and defeats him. Still unsatisfied, Kenpachi sees that there is almost no one who will "quench [his] thirst" for fights, until Arturo appears, who challenges him. Kenpachi defeats Arturo, who dies.

   After that, Yamamoto took away all of the shards, reverting everyone's spiritual energy back to normal and leaving Kenpachi upset. However, Yachiru tells him that he doesn't need a power boost and that she liked his strength the way it is. He agrees to this, saying he will just have to find stronger opponents to fight.

  <p key="bbf69c01-6106-409d-8bb1-5036ed5999fa">
   Kuchiki then ignored all his injuries and remorse and feels that his purpose is clear. He encounters Kenpachi, who has a shard and is out to fight other Shinigami with the shards, but defeats him along with three other opponents. After defeating the third opponent, Suì-Fēng arrives and tells Kuchiki that Yoruichi ordered her to collect the Sōkyoku shards and to stop him. He defeats her and three other opponents before finding Yoruichi, who tells him to go home to rest and to leave the Sōkyoku shards he collected with her. Byakuya, believing she started the activity and wants the shards for herself, challenges her and defeats her.

  <p key="ac0158dc-c3c2-44bf-ad59-7fd75efa15da">
   He starts to question her, but his wound starts hurting again. Arturo appeared, absorbs the shards, and ironically states that one of the Shinigami who sealed him away was a Kuchiki descendant, and now he was "freed by another Kuchiki". After Kuchiki defeated Arturo, the latter says "Curse you Kuchiki. Curse you and all your family forever," and dies. Kuchiki returned and reported all details to Yamamoto, who remembers Arturo from a thousand years ago. Kuchiki went to his parents' graves, saying that he fulfilled his duties by defeating the ghost of his families' past.

   Hanatarō defeats Kenpachi, and is then confronted by Arturo, who reveals his plan. Hanatarō becomes angry after realizing that it's Arturo's fault that he was chased by multiple other Shinigami, and vows to defeat him. After Arturo is defeated and killed, Unohana praises Hanatarō for taking care of such a big threat to the Soul Society. Just then, Zaraki, Ikkaku, and Yumichika appear in front of him, disgusted that they had lost to him earlier, and give chase.

Next, she ran into Captain Hitsugaya, who sought the shards for the life of Hinamori. After defeating him and three more opponents, she finds Byakuya Kuchiki, who argues with her over the activity, and defeats him. She calls to Arturo to reveal himself and he does so.

He then meets Ichigo, and notes that he does not even bear a division insignia on his Shihakshō.
