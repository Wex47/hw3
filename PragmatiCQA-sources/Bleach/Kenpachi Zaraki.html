   with a wild and aggressive appearance, which fits his personality. He has a long face with pronounced cheekbones, and pronounced, hairless brow ridges. He has green eyes and long, stringy black hair.
   A noticeable trait in his appearance is a long, thin scar running down the left side of his face and across his left eye, inflicted on him by

   In addition to the standard Shinigami uniform, he wears white bandages across his midsection and a sleeveless captain's

   (which belonged to the previous captain and was taken after his defeat), which has a ragged look to it.
   He styles his hair into stiff strands during his baths, attaching small bells at its tips, and wears a

    special black eyepatch

   over his right eye. During his first battle with Ichigo, the eyepatch is more elegant, having a gold-like lining and a chain as one of the straps. He also wore a black choker necklace. Later, he removed the choker and gave his eyepatch normal straps.
  </p>
  <p key="01e590d1-97c5-44fe-8b1b-037f84ddf4f3">
   17 months after Aizen's defeat, Kenpachi's hair has grown out past his shoulders. He no longer has the bells in his hair. His eyepatch's design has changed again, as it is now a single piece covering his right eye.
   The eyepatch is black with a grey outline.

    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="9f0431c2-b198-4e1c-ad60-f450bde88df1">
   Although he is known to be a violent fighter, Kenpachi's actions tend to be for the best. Kenpachi lives for battle, and enjoys a good fight more than anything. He even holds back in an effort to make any fight last longer. He claims injury and death are nothing but the price one pays for a good fight. Despite his tendency to be brutal, Kenpachi usually stops a fight if his opponent is too injured to fight back, claiming he is not interested in fighting "weaklings who can't fight anymore", and he does not feel obligated to deal a death blow to anyone who cannot fight any longer. However, he will unhesitatingly kill his opponent if they refuse to end their fight, such as during his battles with
   Kaname Tōsen
   and
   Nnoitra Gilga
   .
   He also takes his title as Kenpachi seriously, telling
   <a href="Gremmy Thoumeaux.html" key="7316c6e0-aa4a-4675-b6ee-7e8197fd356b" title="Gremmy Thoumeaux">
    Gremmy Thoumeaux
   </a>
   that there is nothing the latter can create that he cannot cut because the power his title implies is not to be taken lightly.
  </p>
  <p key="0b48e3a4-4b71-4c7a-baf8-aa7e89b66372">
   Kenpachi's unique hairstyle is partly due to his habit of taking a bath every day before going to sleep, which is a necessity to him due to his strong perspiration. During these baths, he usually washes his hair with soap, making it stiff. He enjoys doing so because it is easy for him to set his hair to his preferred style. He once tried a hair treatment recommended by
   <a href="First Division.html" key="3829e104-d785-4be5-8a2a-0f8466e017b7" title="First Division">

    Chōjirō Sasakibe
   </a>
   , but his hair became too silky and was impossible to set for a while. Since then, Kenpachi has greatly disliked the lieutenant.
   Kenpachi attaches the bells to his hair himself, which takes a while to accomplish. The highest bell in particular takes him several hours to attach, as the tip of his hair is just beyond his reach. He refuses to get help as he thinks it is weird for someone else to style his hair.
  </p>
  <p key="7acc55fa-1ffe-4eb6-a38f-58c52dbb67f2">
   On multiple occasions, Kenpachi has shown great respect to those who can defeat him in a fight and those who can push him to his limit. Ever since
   <a href="Ichigo Kurosaki.html" key="d7652fcb-16c6-4a36-a206-f94b04c59810" title="Ichigo Kurosaki">

    Retsu Unohana
   </a>
   (though Ichigo considers their fight a loss for him), Kenpachi has considered the latter a member of his Division. Despite Ichigo's refusal to engage in a rematch with Kenpachi as he considers him an ally, Kenpachi constantly expresses his desire for it every time they meet. He also aided Ichigo in his fight against the
   Bount
   , doing so as it would make Ichigo stronger for "their anticipated fight". Kenpachi also holds great respect for Unohana, the only person he ever admired, as she was the first person to make him experience the thrill of battle.
   He readily acknowledges that the two of them are very much alike,
   and is brought to tears at the thought of being unable to beat her before he dies.
   Upon inadvertently killing Unohana, Kenpachi was reduced to screaming and begging for her to not die.
  </p>
  <p key="95085c1e-18eb-4053-8a73-fd2173281bfa">
   Kenpachi sometimes contradicts his own logic in fighting. On the one hand, Kenpachi wishes to increase his own personal power. On the other hand, he conceals his strength to enjoy a fight for as long as possible. Although he thrives for battle, Kenpachi does have emotions. Kenpachi and his lieutenant, Yachiru, have been close ever since they met, and have a father-daughter-like relationship, making Yachiru one of the few people he cares for. However, he has stated if his subordinates interfere in his fights, he will "cut them up first". Aside from Yachiru, Kenpachi deeply gives meaning to his name. Following his fight with Ichigo, Kenpachi talks about the pain of not having a name, as he lived his early years without one. This causes him to feel guilty his sword is not acknowledged by its own name.
   Since then, he has strived to learn its identity.
  </p>
  <p key="1989e229-6699-4fcd-9312-03ec0087b5d3">
   Kenpachi strongly believes fun comes before working. One example is when Kenpachi sends his 5th seated officer, Yumichika, to fend off the Bount in
   <a href="Karakura Town.html" key="e1e49ac2-e372-4b49-9054-9019b4af92ff" title="Karakura Town">
    Karakura Town
   </a>
   , as he is the only high-ranking officer who is not busy, or rather, busy having fun, as Yachiru was snacking and Ikkaku was napping. During his free time, Kenpachi always takes his afternoon nap. He does not have a particularly favorite dish, but he particularly hates
   nattō
   .
  </p>
  <p key="cf8e3a0e-93f8-4ea6-a7af-06747b8adb4a">
   After killing Unohana and finally learning the name of his Zanpakutō, though he retains his desire to battle and is not overly interested in the details,
   Kenpachi became somewhat calmer and more focused. He is more willing to listen to reason, having backed down from searching for his missing lieutenant on his own when
   <a href="Nanao Ise.html" key="d64d1dec-05fd-4274-9cd7-a4a5782673ce" title="Nanao Ise">
    Nanao Ise
   </a>
   explained it would be more practical to have his division conduct the search.
   Likewise, he shows far more concern for Yachiru than previously; when he discovers she is missing, Kenpachi frantically orders his men to begin looking for her.

        Not having a name to go by for as long as he could remember, he eventually chose to take his surname from the district he once resided in, Zaraki, which was District 80 of the North Alley of Rukongai. District 80 was the worst, most lawless region of Rukongai, full of thieves and murderers (whereas area #1 was the most orderly and law-abiding). As a young boy living in the streets of the Rukongai, Zaraki, coming upon the dead body of a
        <a href="Shinigami.html" key="284e5877-c36d-4ca0-bcf6-a42ae75f3257" title="Shinigami">

        , took his Asauchi, later imprinting his soul upon it to make his own Zanpakutō.
        During that time, he eventually became proficient in swordsmanship, and killed numerous opponents. Sometime during this, he, coming upon
        Yachiru Unohana
        , fought with her. The fight was the first time he felt fear, and subsequently the first fight he ever enjoyed, having been bored slashing anything else. He subconsciously sealed his power to allow them to fight longer and consequently lost to her. After their fight, he began to admire her, and wanted to fight like her.
       </p>
       <p key="1b3af642-eecf-4861-8c21-ffb64cd432e5">
        Sometime later, as a young man, Zaraki, coming upon a young girl, named her Yachiru, in remembrance of the only person he ever admired, after she showed no fear of his sword. Yachiru came from District 79, Kusajishi, where her parents were murdered, seemingly not too long before Kenpachi arrived. On that day, he took on a name: Kenpachi, the title bestowed upon the strongest Shinigami in every generation, the one who has slain the most enemies and won the most battles.

        . Yachiru warned Ikkaku messing with Kenpachi while he was in a good mood was a bad idea, though Ikkaku did not take the warning seriously. When Kenpachi and Ikkaku meet face to face, the latter immediately became alarmed by the former's Reiatsu, but was happy to finally have a real challenge. Kenpachi attacked with enough force to create a crater in the ground under Ikkaku, which somewhat alarmed Yumichika. Due to Kenpachi's strength, Ikkaku was forced on the defensive, holding off Kenpachi's relentless strikes. As the two continued to fight, Ikkaku tried to overwhelm Kenpachi, though he failed in doing so, only succeeding in increasing his own wounds while his opponent remaining untouched by his blade. While Kenpachi mentioned he was having fun, he decided to finish Ikkaku with one quick strike, resulting in his loss of the fight.

        Ikkaku became mad Kenpachi would just walk away without finishing him off. Kenpachi, plainly telling him he had no interest in weaklings who could not fight, noted he did not have any obligation to finish Ikkaku off. Ikkaku, thinking he was toying with him, demanded Kenpachi kill him. Kenpachi, losing his patience, grabbed hold of Ikkaku and asked why he was screaming for death if he loved to fight so much. Kenpachi explained to him a philosophy to follow for people like them: "
        <i key="d9513275-7191-4de2-b22e-877e63927971">
         Don't admit defeat and seek death. Die first, then admit defeat. When you lose, but don't die, it just means you were lucky. At those times, think only about survival. Survive, and think only about killing the guy who failed to kill you
        </i>
        ". Kenpachi, smiling at him, stated it was not like he went easy on him; he was just lucky to escape death. He said Ikkaku should live, come back, and try to kill him again. As Kenpachi went to leave, Ikkaku, asking him his name, is told he is Kenpachi from Zaraki.

        Sometime later, Kenpachi killed

        , in a single blow in front of over two hundred members of the Division. As per the 3rd Captain Qualification Trial, Kenpachi became the new captain of that division.
        By killing the 11th Division captain, he became the official and uncontested holder of the title, Kenpachi, as well as becoming the 11th person to hold the title.

        The following day, during Kenpachi's first addressing of his division, he was greeted by Ikkaku and Yumichika, who had already become Shinigami and joined the division. Ikkaku told Kenpachi he had come back just as he suggested, causing Kenpachi to smile. Later, they were present at the battle of the division against a caterpillar Hollow. While initially the division lost, Ikkaku showed up to fight it, but was stopped by Kenpachi, who decided to kill it himself. After the Hollow was dispatched, more came, prompting Ikkaku and Yumichika to join in the fight. Though at first he was against it, Kenpachi was persuaded upon realizing the two had similar fighting traits, and, as such, would like to fight by his side. After this, Kenpachi allowed them to participate in his fights.

        Shortly after joining the Gotei 13, Kenpachi was forced by
        Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
        to learn Kendō because he had not learned any formal swordsmanship training, having bypassed those normally necessary qualifications due to the way he attained his position.
        Central 46
        ordered Yamamoto to stop the training after one day, as they became concerned that if Zaraki realized his full potential and rebelled, he could become an unstoppable force.
        Kenpachi hated using Kendō because his battles would end too quickly with it, so he only used it if his own life was in danger.

        run through the Seireitei, they feel Kenpachi's tremendous Reiatsu. As he tries to discern who among the three is the strongest, he finally realizes it is Ichigo. Introducing himself, he tells Ichigo he has come to kill him.
        As the others, trying get away from his strong Reiatsu, cannot get far, Kenpachi confronts Ichigo. Kenpachi is determined to fight Ichigo no matter what the issue may be, showing himself to be unconcerned with his friends or Rukia's fate.
        Kenpachi, seeing Ichigo's battle stance, compliments him on it, though noting it has openings, and admits he likes his spiritual pressure. Kenpachi, acknowledging he understands why Ikkaku lost to him, notes Ichigo is still weaker than him, so he decides to give Ichigo a fighting chance. Kenpachi, baring his chest, tells Ichigo to cut him anywhere and not hold back. When Ichigo refuses to attack an unarmed opponent, Kenpachi, while commending him, states it is simply a handicap, and while he appreciates the thought, Ichigo should save his sympathy for someone else. Kenpachi tells him to either kill or be killed.

        Ichigo, attacking Kenpachi's exposed chest, causes no injury, much to his confusion. Kenpachi, disappointed, begins to unsheathe his Zanpakutō, and, telling Ichigo it is his turn, asks him to not die too quickly.
        When Ichigo's hand starts to bleed, Kenpachi, asking him why he is surprised his sword cannot cut him, pushes Ichigo back, using his arm against his blade. Kenpachi, explaining why Ichigo's sword cannot scratch him, takes out his own sword and tells Ichigo he should try, at the very least, to place a dent upon his sword.
        Ichigo, trying to run away from Kenpachi, cannot seem to shake him, and ends up running into him at every turn. Eventually, Kenpachi, growing bored of chasing after him, sits down. When Ichigo confronts him, he, finally seeming happy, asks if Ichigo is preparing to die or if he is surrendering. Ichigo refuses to do either and, attacking, finally succeeds in injuring Kenpachi.
        Kenpachi, extremely excited Ichigo can actually injure him, telling Ichigo to keep his spiritual pressure up and not relax, attacks Ichigo.

        The two clash and the battle continues, with Kenpachi, while having the upper hand, happy to see Ichigo improving. When Kenpachi comments on how Ichigo is using the sounds of his bells to determine his position, Ichigo asks if he is underestimating him, as he has not released his Zanpakutō. Kenpachi explains his Zanpakutō has no name and, having never had a seal on it, is currently in its true form. As Ichigo, relieved to hear this, attacks once more, Kenpachi, stopping him, further explains his Zanpakutō's state. He, thrusting his Zanpakutō through Ichigo's, breaking right through it, stabs Ichigo in the chest. Kenpachi tells Ichigo he warned him not to relax his spiritual pressure, and it has become weak because he saw a chance to win. He, frustrated the battle was so easy and is now over, retracts his sword.
        Eventually, much to Kenpachi's surprise, Ichigo gets up, accompanied by a large burst of spiritual pressure. Ichigo, attacking Kenpachi, surprising him further, deals him a serious injury to the left side from his shoulder down the side of his torso. Kenpachi, deflecting Ichigo's next attack, stabs his sword into a nearby building. Kenpachi, beginning to laugh, becoming extremely excited, says now the fight is just getting started, noting they should drag out the fight. He, lunging at Ichigo, lets his face get cut by the blade just to get close to Ichigo. As the battle escalates even more, Kenpachi, despite his injuries, continues to fight, teaching Ichigo the drive behind his personality.

        Kenpachi, realizing both he and Ichigo are evenly matched, enjoying the feeling and euphoria of the moment, takes off his eyepatch, noting he considers Ichigo a worthy opponent, so it only makes sense to fight him at full power.
        Kenpachi's spiritual power skyrockets as he removes his eyepatch, prompting Ichigo to wonder what is going on. Kenpachi, explaining to him what the eyepatch does, takes out his Zanpakutō and, cutting a nearby building in half with a single slash, tells Ichigo he will use all his power to kill him.
        When Ichigo, increasing his power, greatly impresses Kenpachi, Ichigo, explaining he can do so by borrowing Zangetsu's power and fighting side by side with him, states he will never lose to someone like him, who only fights by himself. Kenpachi asks if Zangetsu is Ichigo's Zanpakutō, fighting side by side with it and borrowing its power, as he finds it ridiculous. He believes Zanpakutō are just tools of war, and fighting side by side with one are words for weak losers who are afraid to fight on their own. They, both releasing their spiritual pressure, run at each other to make a final strike, releasing enough spiritual pressure to collapse all the buildings around them. The battle ends in a draw, with Ichigo falling first apologizing to his friends as Kenpachi looks down on him. With blood shooting out his shoulder, Kenpachi questions Ichigo's apology, calling him stupid as he gives him the victory of the fight before falling down shortly after.

        Kenpachi, battling Captain Komamura and Captain Tōsen, easily fends them off, leading him to goad them into releasing their

        When Tōsen releases his Bankai, Kenpachi learns he cannot see, hear, and sense spirit energy. However, he fights off Tōsen with the sense of touch, as he can feel when the blade makes contact with his body. However, Kenpachi, becoming frustrated with this style of fighting, lets Tōsen impale him with his sword. Kenpachi, grabbing hold of Suzumushi's hilt, figures out only by grabbing Suzumushi can he see and hear Tōsen. Before Tōsen can attack him, Kenpachi, grabbing Suzumushi once more, gravely wounds Tōsen, which dispels his Bankai.

Kenpachi, revealing he never cared what Komamura looked like (though he was curious), proceeds to fight against him once he releases his Bankai. However, the battle doesn't last long; Komamura, sensing
        Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
        fighting, abandons his fight with Kenpachi.
        Later, Yumichika tells Kenpachi the result of his battle. Kenpachi, in turn, tells him Komamura ran off. Kenpachi, surprised to see Yumichika with no signs of injury after fighting against Hisagi, begins to question him, but, much to his annoyance, Yumichika begins to talk about beauty.

     Later, when Yamamoto orders Ichigo's capture, he, like most Shinigami, is reluctant to go after him, saying he "is not in the mood".

        As the two opponents continue to fight, Kenpachi, getting close to dealing a fatal blow to Nnoitra, cannot cut through the Espada's skin with his sword. Nnoitra, cutting Kenpachi on his left shoulder, laughs, telling him his
        Hierro
        is unsurpassed by any current and former Espada. He tells Kenpachi his blade will never cut him.
        Kenpachi, undeterred, continues to fight Nnoitra with even more ferocity, much to the Espada's surprise. After Nnoitra dodges an attack, Kenpachi deduces it must have been dangerous for him to dodge it. Dismissing it as a reflex, Nnoitra continues the battle until Kenpachi, saying he has never met an opponent whose eyes and neck cannot be cut, stabs Nnoitra in the eye hidden by his eyepatch. However, Nnoitra, unaffected, reveals the remains of his Hollow mask and hole hidden under his eye patch. The Espada, moving closer, stabs Kenpachi in the chest.
        After the two argue over Nnoitra's inability to be cut, Kenpachi keeps trying to slice up his opponent. Eventually, Kenpachi cuts Nnoitra, and, fighting fiercer than before, cuts him again, this time cutting off a part of Nnoitra's Zanpakutō. Kenpachi states he has finally gotten use to the strength of Nnoitra's Hierro. The battle carries on until Kenpachi's eye patch is knocked off.

        After Kenpachi explains the nature of his eye patch, Nnoitra, in a rage, releases. When Nnoitra asks how it feels to see an Espada release their Zanpakutō for the first time, all he gets in response to his question is a smile from Kenpachi, who tells him he has nice Reiatsu, and it is like the Reiatsu itself is sharpening his blade. Kenpachi, wasting no time, goes on the offensive, but he, surprised when his attacks are blocked, is dealt a grievous wound across his chest. Nnoitra sends Kenpachi flying away from him as he mocks him.
        Noticing there is no movement from an unresponsive Kenpachi, Nnoitra sets his sights on Yachiru, but Kenpachi, recovering, cuts off one of his arms. When Nnoitra comments on Kenpachi playing dead, Kenpachi says since Nnoitra will just block his attacks with his many arms, he just has to cut them off. However, Nnoitra, mocking Kenpachi, regenerates his arm. Kenpachi, grabbing Nnoitra, slams him into the ground, prompting Nnoitra, reveal his two hidden arms, to stab Kenpachi in the chest.

        Gotei 13
        , but he never liked it. When he asks Nnoitra if he knows a sword is far more powerful when you use two hands instead of one, Nnoitra, becoming bored with the conversation, charges at Kenpachi, who, gripping his sword with both hands, swings it down. Kenpachi lands a very powerful blow, dealing Nnoitra a lethal wound to his chest, severing a few of his limbs, and almost cutting him in half. Surprised the Espada is still alive, he turns to walk away. When Nnoitra yells at him, asking where he is going as the fight is not over, Kenpachi explains he does not know what he is talking about, as the blow finished him and he is not about to be bothered with finishing someone off who cannot fight back. Undeterred, Nnoitra, getting up, tells him the fight is not over, taunting him to come back and continue fighting. As Nnoitra moves to attack him, Kenpachi, giving in, lands another blow to his chest, and Nnoitra falls to the ground.
        Kenpachi, standing over Nnoitra's corpse, victorious, thanks him for the good fight.

        When Ichigo notices Ulquiorra near Orihime, he, reminding Kenpachi of their earlier conversation, informs him he is wrong. Telling Kenpachi his job is not to protect Karakura Town, but instead to protect his friends, Ichigo takes off, leaving Kenpachi behind.

When Byakuya states he will not, as a savage like him is better suited to the task, Kenpachi takes offense, but before he can do anything about it, Yammy, making his presence known by confirming he is not down for the count yet, slams his large hand down in between the two.

     When Byakuya states he just blew everyone away, Kenpachi plainly tells him he has no intention of fighting any of them anyway. The two begin to battle, though Byakuya is not really interested in doing so. When they cross swords, Byakuya releases his Shikai, though Kenpachi effortlessly deflects it. Feeling disappointed, Kenpachi, increasing his Reiatsu, sends it at Byakuya, who, blocking it, proceeds to use

     . Much to Byakuya's surprise, Kenpachi effortlessly blocks the attack, asking if Byakuya actually thought he could not follow his Shunpo. Byakuya counters, asking Kenpachi if he thought his sluggish speed could catch him. As Kenpachi goes on the offense, Byakuya uses Shunpo to move out of the way, prompting Kenpachi to state it looks like Byakuya's speed is only good enough to dodge him. When Byakuya appears behind Kenpachi, the latter can only react by placing his arm up, causing his forearm to be slashed by Byakuya's attack.

     When Byakuya tells him he cannot be caught by Kenpachi, he, taking the statement as a challenge, lunges at Byakuya, who, dodging the two attacks, is surprised when Kenpachi catches his blade with his bare hands on the third attempt. Kenpachi, stating he caught him, slashes him, but Byakuya moves enough so the wound is not fatal. When Byakuya asks why he had taken such a risk, Kenpachi states if he had not, he would not take the fight seriously. Byakuya, using his Shikai again, tires out Kenpachi, who seemingly deflects it again. Byakuya tells Kenpachi to leave him be, or, in his next attack, he will truly kill him. Kenpachi, laughing at the notion, tells Byakuya to try, as he always wanted to fight with him in a battle to the death. Once Byakuya resolves to continue the fight, the two face off.

     As they continue fighting, with neither side having an advantage, Reigai-Kenpachi grows even more violent, striking down whomever he sees. As Kenpachi becomes annoyed by these interferences, the lieutenants arrive to aid their captains. When Ikkaku and Yumichika offer to fight with Kenpachi, he tells them to keep the "small fries" out of his way.

While not entirely liking the idea, Kenpachi admits it might be nice to have someone have his back once in a while.

Praising him for removing his eyepatch at the start of their fight, Unohana cannot help, but note this also means he is fighting at his limits by doing so. She, continuing to wound Kenpachi with a hidden knife, calls him weak, saying those who only fight with one hand, without using the other for anything else, do not look like they enjoy fighting to her. Kenpachi, degrading her for using tricks she had not used in their last fight, states she has changed from the time he used to look up to her. Knocking Kenpachi's sword from his hand and pinning him against the wall, Unohana tells him she did not change; he just had not given her the chance to use those tricks when they fought each other last.

When he temporarily loses consciousness, something catches Kenpachi's attention and wakes him. Unohana, noticing this, asks him what happened, as it looked like he lost consciousness for a moment. Disregarding her question and whatever had caught his attention, Kenpachi continues the fight against her.

He realizes he was previously only reacting to her sword, but is now doing so reflexively.

Recovering from Unohana's onslaught, he delivers a powerful vertical slash.

Kenpachi, gradually overwhelming Unohana, stabs her through the chest.

        Being asked by Isane Kotetsu where Unohana is, Kenpachi answers he has killed her and confirms that he has inherited her name. Gremmy raises the ground, thus setting up a stage for their battle. After Gremmy reveals his epithet Kenpachi charges at him, but his blade is stopped. Hearing Gremmy explain how he can stop it by imagining his skin is resistant enough, Kenpachi proceeds to cut him and declare he can cut through anything Gremmy can imagine.

        As Kenpachi notes the noise made by his subordinates, Gremmy reveals he's healed and then begins attacking Kenpachi through imagining lava. Stating Gremmy's power is illogical, Kenpachi says he doesn't dislike illogical things and then charges, cutting away the lava and telling Yachiru to get away. After hearing Gremmy revealing what Yachiru's bones are now made of, Kenpachi asks what a cookie is and, hearing the answer, again attacks. Kenpachi is surrounded by water and falls down a fissure in the ground which then closes. He breaks free and, carrying Yachiru, again tries to cut Gremmy, but he is blocked. Noting that Gremmy's power doesn't seem to work on Yachiru anymore, Kenpachi speculates that it is because he shifted his attention away from her.

        After cutting through the beam blocking his sword,
        Kenpachi tells Yachiru to have Isane heal her arm. As Yachiru gleefully scurries down the side of the structure, Gremmy notes Kenpachi figured out how to disable his power. Confirming this, Kenpachi asks Gremmy if he wants to fight and reminds him of his claim of being the strongest Quincy. Kenpachi reasons that Gremmy would want to destroy the strongest fighter out there because of this status before proclaiming this will not be a fight if Gremmy is distracted so easily by things that aren't Kenpachi. As Kenpachi lunges forward, Gremmy surrounds him with dozens of rectangular columns, which he easily cuts through. Eventually, a joyous Gremmy creates several dozen sub-machine guns around himself and has all of them fire at Kenpachi, who emerges with only minor injuries and notes his sword is finally beginning to enjoy himself.

        Kenpachi continues to attack Gremmy, each time taking advantage of Gremmy's lack of reaction to slash him again and again while cutting through his constructs as well. After slashing Gremmy in several areas, a confused Kenpachi asks him if he is imagining his own death. Healing his wounds, Gremmy thanks Kenpachi for pointing this out to him and state he will reveal his strongest technique before creating a clone of himself. When Kenpachi attacks the clone, Gremmy reveals they will not die and points out a huge meteorite hurtling toward the Seireitei. As Gremmy proclaims this attack will obliterate Kenpachi and the entire Seireitei, Kenpachi tells his sword that it is great to find something he has not slashed yet and refers to it as

        Gremmy calls him a monster for being able to destroy a meteorite with a single attack, prompting Kenpachi to state he can simply cut through anything. Surrounding Kenpachi with more clones of himself, Gremmy proclaims this means he will simply have to kill Kenpachi with something that has no form and encloses him in a large pocket of space. Kenpachi begins to spew liquid from his mouth and eye and screams in pain as Gremmy explains how he will die a slow and painful death in the vacuum of space, but he bifurcates one of Gremmy's clones, cutting himself out of the void in the process. As the other clones grab onto him, Kenpachi is engulfed in an enormous explosion, which he survives with a moderately burned and scratched body. Noting this as proof of Kenpachi's monstrosity, Gremmy proclaims he shall simply become stronger than Kenpachi and rushes toward him as his veins pop out, only for his body to begin tearing itself apart in midair due to his muscles and tendons growing too quickly for it to contain. As Gremmy falls to the ground below, Kenpachi criticizes him for imagining Kenpachi to be a monster and losing because of it.

        Heavily injured, Kenpachi approaches the defeated Sternritter. Hearing Gremmy's explanation of his own loss and his real body, a surprised Kenpachi watches as the Quincy dissolves and perishes. After the stage collapses, Kenpachi calls out to Yachiru and notices her empty clothes on the ground. When his subordinates arrive, he orders them to search for her. He is soon surprised when the low-ranking 11th division members are struck by thunder. He then sees

As the four Sternritter slaughter dozens of 11th Division members around him and wonder how they should kill him, Kenpachi notes he cannot move and wonders if this is the end as an explosion occurs overhead.
        When Ichigo arrives and moves to him, Kenpachi asks him what he is doing here, prompting Ichigo to proclaim he is here to save him.
        When Ichigo asks him if he can stand, Kenpachi laughs and tells Ichigo to look out for himself instead of worrying about him.

Kenpachi asks Urahara where Yachiru is, and upon learning that his division is currently looking for her, he attempts to leave despite Urahara asking him to stay. When Urahara stops him with a Kidō barrier, an angry Kenpachi begins moving toward him, only for

Hitsugaya attempts to intervene, but Kenpachi smashes him to the ground below and tells him to stay out of this, with Byakuya agreeing, prompting Hitsugaya to point out how Kenpachi considers Gerard enough of a threat to have already taken off his eyepatch. As Kenpachi and Gerard continue clashing, with Kenpachi slowly but surely being overwhelmed, Gerard points out the waning power behind his strikes before smashing him into the ground. Suddenly, Yachiru appears before Kenpachi and tells him that the fun has only just started.

    Highly Perceptive Combatant
   </b>
   : Despite his seeming disregard for any strategy and his self-admitted aversion to thinking, Kenpachi has regularly displayed more understanding than one would expect. Even Byakuya was impressed by Kenpachi's ability to understand things he has no personal experience with.
   He is very adept at finding and exploiting weaknesses in his opponents' techniques, and likewise at adjusting to his opponent's attack patterns and battle methods to better counter them. This was demonstrated when he was subdued by Kaname Tōsen's Bankai, leaving him with only his blade and sense of touch, which prompted him to let Tōsen strike him simply so he could catch his opponent.
   He is also deceptively insightful, able to notice subtle traits in people and see what drives a person's actions; he correctly singled out Kaname Tōsen and Gin Ichimaru as the only captains who are afraid to die.
   He possesses sharp intuition towards incoming danger, which allowed him to repeatedly dodge Tōsen's assault while still affected by his Bankai. While claiming not to have any common sense, Kenpachi can still theorize, as he deduced that Gremmy Thoumeaux's

    Supernatural Strength
   </b>
   : Kenpachi possesses a very large degree of physical strength, most commonly displayed by his ability to push back his opponent's attacks with a single arm, even if the opponent's weapons and attacks are gigantic in size.
   He can carry three full-grown human corpses on his shoulders without any apparent effort.
   When
   Pernida Parnkgjas
   began warping and damaging his arm, Kenpachi ripped it off effortlessly.

   <li key="ca1431e8-0100-49d4-8a5a-ce93eeef0281">
    In his various battles, he has performed superhuman physical feats, such as launching full-grown men through buildings with a kick and slamming his opponents over his shoulder, as well as grabbing Ichigo's large sword to reel him in for an attack.
    He can also ram clear through a solid wall
    and launch his opponents back during a weapons clash.
    He also managed to block the stomp of an enormous

    and throw him back a tremendous distance,
    and even succeeded in tripping up Gerard with just one arm when the Quincy was even larger.
    With just his bare hand, Kenpachi grabbed and deflected the Cero of the fifth Espada,

    His sword attacks can easily cut through an Arrancar's Hierro, which is harder than steel, including

    His extreme cutting strength is also evident from how he sliced apart a skyscraper with a mere flick of his wrist. Against Gremmy's imagination powers, Kenpachi claims that the Quincy's powers cannot come up with anything that he cannot cut, proving so by slicing through Gremmy's self-proclaimed harder-than-steel body.

   , Kenpachi displayed deceptively fast physical speed for his size and build. Thanks to the tremendous raw strength in his legs, Kenpachi's natural acceleration more than made up for his lack of Shunpo, allowing him to move fast enough to instantly close a huge gap of space between him and his opponent,
   and even seemingly disappear from sight. In battle, he can strike with incredible speed in rapid succession, making it highly difficult for his opponents to find an opening and counterattack. During his short battle with Byakuya, Kenpachi manages to keep up with his opponent's incredibly fast Shunpo, a feat which shocked and impressed Byakuya.

    Supernatural Endurance
   </b>
   : His physical prowess is equally shown by his resilience. Kenpachi often ignores most of the injuries he sustains in battle, not suffering any debilitation despite having multiple slash wounds in his body and rarely any signs of pain (much like a berserker). He allowed himself to be stabbed during his fight with Tōsen just to grab Tōsen's blade to dispel his Bankai's effect. During his battle with Nnoitra, he suffered numerous slash wounds, even impaled and almost beheaded with no visual impairment of his fighting performance; Nnoitra noting most people would have already been dead by then.
   Even after receiving grievous injuries which left him in a comatose state, he healed enough to return to training only days later, showing a high recovery rate as well.
   Despite having his arm mangled by Pernida's

    Supernatural Durability
   </b>
   : As resilient as Kenpachi is, he is just as hard to damage. During his battle against Yammy, while Kenpachi was focusing his attention on Ichigo, Yammy delivered a powerful blow with his massive fist, launching Kenpachi several meters and smashing him into a large pillar. Despite the impact, Kenpachi quickly emerged unfazed, claiming it was only a "decent punch" but was still unimpressed.
   During his battle with Gremmy, Kenpachi remained unharmed after being fired upon by dozens of firearms and having missiles thrown at him,
   and later withstood the cold vacuum of space and having several clones of Gremmy self-destruct at point-blank range with only moderate injuries.
   Even after Kenpachi suffered severe organ damage from these attacks, it took the combined effort of four Sternritter to finally take him out of the battle.

   Originally, Kenpachi was the only person in the history of the Gotei 13 who did not know the name of his Zanpakutō before becoming a captain, nor could he perform either of his blade's released states. After his fight with Ichigo, Kenpachi wished to learn more about his Zanpakutō because he wanted to become stronger and he could identify with the pain of not having a name. Zangetsu noted Kenpachi's disharmony with his sword caused the two to damage each other's powers; consequently, Kenpachi could not hear the cry of his sword. Their disharmony left
