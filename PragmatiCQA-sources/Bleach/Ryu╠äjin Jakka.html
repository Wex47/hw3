   Yamamoto is a fair-skinned man of average height. The oldest captain in the
   Gotei 13
   , he has aged into a elderly man with a bald head, visible wrinkles, hooked nose, and pronounced cheekbones. He has red eyes,
   long eyebrows, long mustache, and a hip-length white beard secured by a purple band crossing down it. He has many scars on about torso, with the two most prominent being a pair of long scars crossing above his right eye, one of which was left by his battle with his lieutenant.
   In addition to the standard

   draped over his back instead of actually wearing it, with its size being greatly exaggerated. Despite his old and frail demeanor, often standing in a hunch, he in fact has a very muscular and well-defined built, which he only reveals when serious for battle, something which
   Shunsui Kyōraku
   claims is not seen too often. After his brief confrontation with

  <p key="59115b65-5689-4509-8ba6-00ec7bd5cda9">
   When he was much younger, Yamamoto had black hair on the sides of his head, and was bald on top. He had a tuft of hair sticking up at the back of his head in a topknot. He had thick but more manageable eyebrows and mustache with no beard. He had a single large scar on his forehead, which earned him the nickname "

   to the letter, and expects the same of others. He is not a man to tolerate insubordination, and is vocal with those who attempt to act in such a manner. He is quick to anger in the face of possible betrayal and can be quite aggressive in combat. He has a habit of referring to those he faces in battle as "

   ". When in a state of peace, he carries himself with an air of frailty, to the point where he fell asleep standing while awaiting
   Shunsui Kyōraku
   's arrival for a meeting. Due to years of experience, Yamamoto very rarely shows any sign of distress or surprise, usually responding by opening one or both of his eyes, which are partially closed slits for the majority of the time.

   Yamamoto is very loyal to Soul Society, and takes his duties very seriously, expecting the same from the rest of the Gotei 13. His loyalty is so great, he is willing to sacrifice himself and the Gotei 13 in order to defeat Aizen, believing it to be their duty to lay down their lives for the sake of the Soul Society if necessary.
   Yamamoto becomes visibly angry when Shunsui,

   noted 1000 years ago, Yamamoto was a demon himself, using any necessary means to defeat his enemies, and treated Humans and his own subordinates alike as expendable pawns; it was only after defeating the Quincy and attaining peace did Yamamoto live with honor and justice that led him to hesitate in sacrificing people heedlessly.

        Jūshirō Ukitake

During one of his visits, Chōjirō told Yamamoto he wished to be his right arm and compensate for anything which Yamamoto could not do. When Yamamoto told him to become his disciple, he declined. At Yamamoto's behest, Chōjirō tried to defeat him with his Bankai. Though he failed to defeat him, he left a permanent scar on Yamamoto's forehead, crossing his earlier scar. Others began to refer to him by a different name due to the new scar, but Chōjirō refused to use this new name. As a result, Yamamoto decided to call himself Genryūsai.

He stated it had appeared at a time when Soul Society was facing a difficult situation, and the monster's appearance had made the situation worse. Yamamoto stated it was unlikely to return, but if it did, its return would mark Yamamoto's last day in Soul Society.

He states if he were mad at the Gotei 13, it would be for making the barrier around the Fake Karakura Town so hard to get through. When Shinji states if he had not found Lieutenant Chōjirō outside the barrier, they still would be on the outside of it, Chōjirō apologizes to Yamamoto for allowing them in, saying he thought it was necessary given the circumstances, but before he can finish, Yamamoto, forgiving his actions, asks Shinji if he is right to assume they are allies. Telling him it is obvious they are not, Shinji states the Visored are not on the Gotei 13's side, but they are against Aizen, and they are Ichigo's allies.

Aizen states though he has finally shown himself, he is too late: as of now, he is the only one left to be counted as manpower. Aizen notes if he falls, the Gotei 13 will crumble, and states Yamamoto has lost his chance. When Yamamoto asks Aizen if he really thinks he can cut him down with this much power, Aizen states he does not have to cut him down, for he already has. Before an enraged Yamamoto can react, Aizen appears behind him. As Yamamoto turns to face him, Aizen stabs him through his stomach with his Zanpakutō.

When Aizen tries to trick him into questioning whether or not he has caught the real Aizen, Yamamoto, calling his bluff, states if he only relied on his eyes or skin, he would say yes, but he instead only needs to rely on sensing the Reiatsu of Aizen's Zanpakutō, which is impaled into his stomach.

Noting he would use his subordinates to set such a trap, Aizen expresses admiration at his cunning. Stating he plans to die with Aizen in the flames, he tells Ichigo to get back, for he is not part of the Gotei 13 and he should not have to endure their fate. When Aizen asks if he would really risk killing the other combatants to try and destroy him, Yamamoto states they are all prepared to die to destroy evil, which is the true spirit of the Gotei 13.

Stating if he cannot break one bone, he will result to tactics which bring more pain, he removes his top.

As Wonderweiss screams, other arms, appearing from his shoulders, attack Yamamoto with an onslaught of punches. As he grabs Yamamoto's arms, the tops of his shoulders explode, revealing a multitude of arms, which pummel Yamamoto with an even greater magnitude of blows. Once he has stopped, an unfazed Yamamoto, asking him if this is all he has got, rips off Wonderweiss' arms.

When he tells Yamamoto the only inhuman one is him, for he just crushed a soul with purpose, Yamamoto states he has no intention of entering into a pointless argument with the likes of him, for it will all soon be over.

Stating sealing the blade makes it impossible for it to create new flames, Aizen asks what happens to flames already produced, for Yamamoto had flames already in effect before Wonderweiss showed up. As he asks him where those flames were sealed, Yamamoto realizes those flames are sealed in Wonderweiss' body, and since he is dead, they will explode. As Yamamoto jumps on the body, it erupts in a large area, destroying buildings around it. Aizen approaches as the flames subside to reveal Yamamoto, who has been injured by the explosion. Aizen states he is truly worthy of the title of Captain-Commander, having reduced the damage of such a large explosion, and had he not suppressed the explosion with his body, the flames would have vaporized the barrier around the Fake Karakura Town, and an area greater than the size of the town would have been turned to ashes. Thanking Yamamoto for protecting his world, he, moving close to him, unsheathes his Zanpakutō, telling him he cannot afford to spare his life as he did with the other shinigami he subdued, for Yamamoto is the history of Soul Society, so at the very least, he must finish him off with his own blade. Grabbing Aizen by the ankle, he, telling him to not make him say it again, calls Aizen naive.
        Yamamoto takes advantage of the damage inflicted by Wonderweiss' explosion to use his own charred body as a catalyst for the sacrificial spell,

He is furious to learn that not only did Captains Shunsui, Byakuya, and Kenpachi lose their respective captain haori, but that they care very little about it. He proceeds to scold the three for their lack of care for the symbol of their station.

     battle
     with their various techniques, with Yamamoto marveling at how similar the Reigai are to his original students. All three receive injuries from their attacks.

After a brief skirmish, Ichigo warns the captain of Inaba's Shikai, prompting Yamamoto to state he is already aware of it. While thinking of how to handle Inaba, Nozomi offers to be a distraction, allowing for an opening to attack. Before she attacks, Yamamoto secretly gives some of his Reiatsu to Nozomi's Shikai. She attacks Inaba, who dodges her attacks. Finding the opening he needs, Yamamoto attacks with a powerful fire blast. As Inaba, seeing it, reacts, Ichigo launches an attack of his own. As the explosion settles, Inaba, emerging unharmed, reveals since he could not negate and copy their attacks at the same time, he instead copied Nozomi's absorption power and used it to counter Yamamoto and Ichigo's attack. When Inaba unleashes all the collected energy against Yamamoto, Nozomi, appearing in front of Yamamoto, attempts to absorb the blast.

The colliding blasts erupt and launch them both to the ground. Badly injured, Nozomi asks him why he saved her after voicing his disapproval of her as a Mod-Soul. Stating his pride will not allow him to be saved by a child, Yamamoto collapses. Later, Inaba emerges, hurt, but still able to fight. As he attempts to take Nozomi, Yamamoto, regaining consciousness, launches a fire blast at him, giving Nozomi a chance to retreat. Inaba goes after her, but Yamamoto is too weak to follow.

As he moves to attack, he is blocked by a wall of skeletons. Yamamoto tells him to stop talking and look closer. Looking closer at the undead skeletons, Yhwach is shocked to see the faces of his former subordinates. When Yamamoto starts to leave, Yhwach asks where he is going.

He asks Yamamoto if he used his power to fight his decoy. When Yamamoto begins to initiate Bankai, Yhwach, steals it with a medallion. Yhwach explains how it was not that they could not take his Bankai, but it is that his power is too enormous for anyone but Yhwach himself to handle. Stating this is why he ordered Royd to not do anything until he returns, he goads Yamamoto by asking him if he should use his Bankai and call forth dead Shinigami to attack him. As Yhwach waves his sword, a large sword made of spiritual energy falls from the sky. Bidding Yamamoto farewell, Yhwach attacks him.

He says that Yamamoto had gotten weak over time, and that he was only truly a threat 1,000 years ago.

   without much effort at all, using only the blunt end of his cane. With a single hand, he stopped one of Ayon's strikes and overpowered it, despite it having enlarged its arm and increased its strength several folds.
   With one punch, he put a large hole through the chest of

   He tore off Wonderweiss' arms, with his bare hands, with little to no effort.
   With a single double-fisted strike, he shattered Wonderweiss' entire body into pieces.

    Immense Durability
   </b>
   : Yamamoto possesses remarkable durability. He took an onslaught of punches from Wonderweiss' multiple arms twice, and came out completely unfazed by the assault, with no more than simple scratches.
   He sustained an explosion of flames which had the power to incinerate all of Karakura Town and a great area around it.
   In his younger years, he challenged Chōjirō to defeat him with his newly achieved Bankai, and in the end only suffered a light scar on his forehead.
   2000 years later, he would take on a barrage of powerful lightning strikes from Chōjirō's fully-mastered Bankai and only be singed by its power, though he stated it became weaker from

   He can easily deflect a giant

   : Despite his old age, Yamamoto can fight for extended periods of time, even when outnumbered, with no visible signs of exhaustion. He can take direct attacks from others unfazed. He can endure being impaled on a sword without so much as flinching from the perceived damage, even when the blow is dealt by the likes of Aizen, a powerful opponent.
   Even after being bifurcated by
