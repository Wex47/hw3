   Orihime is a teenager of average height. She has brown eyes
   and long, waist-length, burnt orange hair. Her most noticeable physical trait is her slender yet curvaceous figure for a teenager, especially in terms of her large breasts. She wears her hair in bangs tucked behind her ears with hairpins, which she only removes to sleep
   , as they are worn in the memory of her brother.
   Orihime initially wears her hair with a full but parted fringe before pulling most of her bangs behind her ears as she was ready to leave for Soul Society, a change noted by Tatsuki.

   Orihime is independent, friendly, humorous, optimistic, sensitive, caring and kind. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school.
   She studies hard because when her grades drop, she receives less financial support from her relatives.
   She is a member of the Handicrafts Club
   and likes to invent very ridiculous sports to play with
   Tatsuki
   (such as "base-cer," a combination of baseball and soccer).
   She tends to zone out with her mouth open and loses track of what she was thinking or dreaming about. She has an over-active imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as portraying herself as a futuristic and highly destructive robot in an assignment asking a student "How do you see yourself in the future?".

  <p key="17c90032-ee66-4b37-ac07-52c143249b3e">
   Orihime likes Asian flower print clothing and comedies. While she does eat some normal food, Orihime cooks and eats unusual meals, which other people often find unappetizing. Her favorite food is red bean paste and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes.
   She enjoys cheese and butter most of the time.

   Orihime has demonstrated that she is perceptive when it comes to people's mental and emotional state, especially in regards to Ichigo, as she is able to tell what kind of driving force is pushing someone. She additionally has a crush on Ichigo and later falls in love with him.
   She has exhibited traits that appear to have some connection with Ichigo, such as the ability to detect Ichigo by scent,
   sense his

   17 months after Aizen's defeat, Orihime has gained a much firmer resolve in combat; when Ichigo was training with

   , Orihime was entirely willing to injure Ginjō if he attacked without her permission. She and
   Sado
   have sworn that they would be strong enough to not burden Ichigo when he finally regains his power to fight, which is reflected in her development of a
   technique
   that acts as both offense and defense.

   For nine years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her unusual hair color. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. That day, Sora died, and Orihime began wearing the hairpins every day since. After Sora's death, Orihime prayed for him every day. A year after Sora died, Orihime met

When Ichigo notices the wrappings around her arm and asks her about it, Orihime casually replies that she was run over by a car, to Ichigo's shock and concern. Rukia notices an odd wound on Orihime's left leg and realizes it was caused by a Hollow. When Orihime realizes she needs to leave, Ichigo offers to walk her home but she hastily declines. On her way home, she thinks about actually wanting to say yes, calling herself stupid.
   Later, Orihime has Tatsuki over for dinner, revealing more of her crush on Ichigo. Tatsuki tries giving advice on how to claim him, to Orihime's embarrassment. She later becomes distracted by a daydream of her and Ichigo on a date in a park, which later becomes a racing contest with another athlete, leading to Orihime imagining herself as a successful boxer and warning her imaginary self to run before she could be shot, much to Tatsuki's confusion.
   Shortly after Orihime notices her teddy bear Enraku fall with a rip in it, she and Tatsuki are attacked by

   After battling Ichigo briefly, Acidwire then reveals to Orihime that he is Sora, which prompts Orihime to ask why he would hurt Ichigo and Tatsuki. He reveals he grew angered by Orihime praying for him less and less over the years since his death due to his sister forming a friendship with Tatsuki and gaining a crush on Ichigo. Acidwire asks Orihime to remain with him, but she claims that her brother would never do such horrible things. Enraged, Acidwire tries to kill Orihime before being interrupted by Ichigo.
   As his fight with Ichigo continues, Orihime places herself between the pair, resulting in Acidwire wounding her. She embraces him
   and apologizes to her brother for causing all this. Sora, feeling great remorse over his actions, breaks his mask and then purifies himself with Ichigo's

   However, Tatsuki soon falls under Numb Chandelier's control and is forced to turn on Orihime. Seeing Tatsuki in tears brings back old memories of the days when Orihime was bullied for the color of her hair and when Tatsuki saved her, thus Orihime decides it is time for her to protect Tatsuki in return for their friendship. This desire forces her powers to manifest for the first time.

Orihime is shocked when the little Arrancar begins to berate her for not cheering him on and reminds her how Ichigo gained the power to protect his friends and now was in an all-out battle just to save her life, needing her support in the process. Orihime remembers why she came to Hueco Mundo and how she was happy that they had come for her; part of her was afraid that the mask meant he actually had ulterior motive for being in Hueco Mundo. She then summons strength and cries out for Ichigo not to get hurt anymore.

        to catch his falling body. Before she can reach him, however, Ulquiorra appears before her, saying that Ichigo can't be healed, even by her powers. Uryū intervenes, buying enough time for Orihime to get past him to Ichigo. Despite using her Sōten Kisshun on Ichigo, the hole doesn't appear to be close, and she begins to blame herself and panic. Her desperation only worsens when Uryū flies past her, having lost his left hand at the hands of Ulquiorra. He is then defeated by Ulquiorra and she shields him from the Espada while still panicking over and over about what she should do.
        Distraught, Orihime cries out for Ichigo to wake up, not noticing the change in his appearance.
        The sound of her voice triggers a change in Ichigo as

        Orihime and Uryū watch as the Hollow almost effortlessly defeats Ulquiorra, though the latter survives.
        Uryū, in an effort to stop Ichigo from killing Ulquiorra in cold blood, restrains him with his hand, but is stabbed through the stomach while Orihime screams out in panic. Ichigo's inner Hollow then turns to Orihime at the sound of her voice and begins to stutter that he will help her. Startled, she starts to blame herself because she knows this has happened because of what she said to the unconscious Ichigo. Just then, the Hollow begins to charge a

        The explosion shatters the Hollow's mask, restoring him to normal.

        Under the stunned gaze of Ulquiorra, Orihime rushes towards Ichigo, trying to wake him up. They watch as the hole in Ichigo's chest miraculously heals, unable to comprehend what has happened. Ichigo awakens, unaware of the events that have occurred. He attempts to finish his fight with Ulquiorra, but injured Espada begins to fade. After asking Ichigo to kill him, the dying Espada turns to Orihime, once again asking if she was afraid of him. He reaches out for her, and she does the same, telling him that she wasn't scared just as he fades away.
        After the fight, Orihime stays on top of the dome to tend to Uryū's wounds.

She cries in relief upon seeing that Ichigo is fine, commenting that due to Ichigo's changed appearance she thought she was seeing things. She rushes towards Ichigo with the others, just as the latter suddenly collapses mid-sentence while replying to her.
        About one month later, she is in Ichigo's room with Rukia, Chad, and Uryū as he wakes up. She screams his name in joy, only to be embarrassed for being the only person to do so.

As Uryū wonders why Inaba would constantly try to kill Ichigo first, Orihime guesses it was because Ichigo was always protecting Nozomi. Kisuke, however, surmises that it was because of Ichigo's Hollow powers and Inaba was uncomfortable allowing a being he could not create a Reigai of live, even to the point of using the Kōtotsu to swallow Ichigo. From this, Kisuke believes that they can restore Ichigo's power from the remaining Reiryoku still inside the Kōtotsu. As Ichigo is the only one who can do this because he has no Reiatsu at the moment, everyone is forced to wait for him, much to Orihime's concern. Orihime is present when Ichigo returns from the Dangai with a sample of his Reiryoku.
     Afterwards, Orihime and the others agree to act as diversions through the Dangai while Ichigo and Kisuke sneak into Soul Society.

        Orihime is admired by other students as she walks down the school hallway, before she sees Ichigo and Tatsuki out the window and calls out to them, almost falling in her excitement. She grabs a drainage pipe and slides down it, being admonished and hit on the head by Tatsuki for being so silly. She discusses her inability to sing the song of her life, the

        , but is advised she cannot do so because she has matured. She is then reminded that she needs to go home and get ready for work as Tatsuki leaves for her job as well.
        On her way home, Orihime catches up with Uryū, initially believing Ichigo to have been kidnapped before informing him that she's felt something different about him in the last number of days before she rushes home to get ready for work.
        Orihime goes to the

As the two talk, Orihime asks him if something had happened or if he was being followed, saying that her intuition led her to believe that to be the case. After Ichigo denies this, Orihime says that her intuition was wrong and that she allowed it to get her worried.

       <p key="e34440a4-3ce2-48f8-ace1-5ea2fae0d286">
        At her apartment, Orihime notes that her face is still red and expresses her surprise that Ichigo had invited her inside, idealizing what actually happened. She says that Ichigo is so nice for telling her to pick out the bread she liked to bring it home. Spinning around, she becomes dizzy and falls, knocking over her picture of Sora. She picks up the picture and apologizes before affirming that Ichigo is hiding something. Her phone rings, startling her. She answers, finding that it is Uryū.
        Ichigo arrives at Karakura Hospital to find Orihime already there. He asks after Sado, but Orihime tells him that he did not answer his phone. Seeing that she called Ichigo, Uryū says that she is taking things too far. After they and Ryūken talk about his injuries, Uryū tells them that he cannot tell them anything and asks them to go home. When Ichigo offers to walk Orihime home, Ryūken tells him that he will drive her home. Ryūken tells Orihime that Ichigo does not seem to able to help and informs her that he examined the Reiatsu left in Uryū by the attacker. He reveals that the attacker was not a Hollow or Shinigami, but rather was something that he had not encountered before. He theorizes that the assailant was a Human with powers, similar to Orihime and Sado. Noting that Quincy broadly fall into this category, he warns her that she or Sado might be in danger.

        At school the following day, Orihime asks Ichigo if he knows anything about Sado's condition. Ichigo inquires if he is sick. Orihime tells him that she went to his class to inform him about what had happened to Uryū, but it seems that Sado has not been in school lately. She tells him that she was planning to take a get well present to him after school and invites Ichigo, who declines. She tells him that it is too short notice and that she will let him know about Sado condition. Ichigo thanks her and walks off. At Sado's home, Orihime finds that Sado is not in. She remembers Ryūken's warning, but quickly dismisses such negative thoughts and leaves some bread and prays for him.
        Orihime remarks that Ichigo and Chad still haven't returned to school before being challenged by

        Orihime attempts to use her powers when Tsukishima turns away, however, he appears behind her and seemingly cuts her from her left shoulder down through her chest.
        However, when Sado and Ichigo arrive, she is unharmed despite being sure she had felt the cut from the sword. Concerned for Ichigo, whom she thinks is powerless, she brushes off his concern while deciding to text Sado with the information later. For a moment, she believes that Tsukishima is her friend, making her wonder what she was slashed by.

She says that she does not understand it and rather than mistaking him for a friend, it felt like an old memory, leaving Sado shocked. Orihime tells him to be careful as she believes that Tsukishima's power is scary. She then gives him her attackers' names, though she mistakenly says Shishigawara's name as

When she arrives he apologizes for his brash attitude last time they spoke and asks that she heal his injuries because he senses the change in Ichigo's Reiatsu. Orihime confirms that she senses it as well, but has decided to let Ichigo tell her when he's ready before informing Uryū that she was attacked by the same person who attacked him.

She further says if Ichigo needs her help, she will use her powers to help him, no matter what. Riruka then asks Orihime what she'd do if he is hurt beyond her abilities to heal, and Orihime says she'll never allow that and will heal it all, no matter how hopelessly injured he gets.

She pleads with him to wait, but he declines, asking Ichigo if he's ready. When Ichigo says yes, Kūgo rushes him. Orihime steps in front of Ichigo, erecting a barrier. Ichigo calls out, asking her to stop, while Kūgo mocks her attempt to stop his Cross of the Scaffold Fullbring with Santen Kesshun.

She tells him that over the seventeen months he was without his spiritual abilities, both she and Chad had been constantly improving. She claims that they knew Ichigo would eventually regain his powers, and that neither of them would let themselves fall behind again. Ichigo says he understands, thanks Orihime and moves to combat Kūgo.

Orihime replies that there are no walls or pillars to lean on. Riruka demands that Yukio quickly create a table and chairs for her and Orihime. He refuses, but when Orihime politely asks for a chair for herself, he accedes to the request. As she is eating her doughnuts, Riruka notices Orihime staring longingly at them. Initially refusing to give her any, she soon relents. Orihime wolfs down the whole thing, leading to Riruka criticizing her and wondering how her parents cope with her. Orihime reveals that Sora took her away when she was a baby because he feared they would kill her. Riruka asks if he supports her, but she tells him that he died and that a distant relative supports her financially. Riruka says that she is no fun to talk with and starts to leave. She tells Orihime that there must be something wrong with her to be able to talk so nonchalantly about it. However, Orihime replies that she has already been saved and that she can talk as she had been doing because of Ichigo. When Orihime points out there are still some doughnuts left, Riruka tells her that she can have them instead. Orihime thanks her and tells her that she is really nice.

        When Kūgo slashes Ichigo's eyes, Orihime tries to help him, but Kūgo stops her. He tells her to watch and notes that when Ichigo lost his powers he also lost his resolve. He tells Ichigo that he will bring that back to him.
        Yukio traps her inside a cage at Kūgo's behest. He tells Orihime that her voice cannot be heard from outside the cage and that it cannot be broken due to the game's rules. He then notices that he cannot hear her either.
        After Ichigo completes his Fullbring, Orihime awakens in a house inside of Yukio's Fullbring. She gets up and brushes her teeth before looking out the window at Ichigo's training. Riruka comes in and brings her breakfast without knocking first and Orihime tells her that she came in before she said alright. Riruka tells her to shut up and gives her her breakfast. Orihime excitedly asks Riruka to join her, but Riruka says she just had doughnuts. Orihime grabs her hot dog and says that Riruka eats a lot of doughnuts before taking a bite.

        Orihime heals Tsukishima's arm then and he compliments her abilities much to Ichigo's annoyance.
        Orihime asks Ichigo if he has forgotten about how Tsukishima saved Rukia and how he stopped Aizen, showing that her and Sado's memories have been altered by Tsukishima's abilities.

She notes that Tsukishima has always been there for her and that she has known him longer than Ichigo. She asks why she feels so much pain when Ichigo cries. She spots Ichigo and is relieved to see that he is not crying. She also notices Rukia, Renji and Hitsugaya and assumes that they are there to stop Ichigo. However, Sado notes that they look as if they intend to help Ichigo and kill Kūgo. Tsukishima abruptly appears behind the two, sensing their uncertainty, and attempts to alter their memories further. As a result, she is nearly pushed to the brink of mental breakdown before she is knocked out and rendered unconscious by Urahara.
        She and Sado are brought to Urahara's shop and after Tsukishima is defeated, they become stable. They are left in the care of Tessai and Isshin.

Riruka asks about Tsukishima, but Orihime says she doesn't know who that is - an unwitting confirmation that Tsukishima was killed. In the revelation, Riruka starts tearing up. Despite her denying it and Orihime telling her not to, the two end up shedding tears together.

She calls Sado to see Ichigo, but their conversation is soon cut off by a voice demanding to see Ichigo. Orihime and Sado frantically attempt to keep the person away from the tent they are in.
        After some time passes, Orihime travels across Hueco Mundo's desert. Arriving at the Negal Ruins, the young woman muses about how Chad and the others must be doing while devouring a snack, before calling out to her nearby companion, Pero. Remembering Urahara's words about Pero being there to alert him in case she found herself in trouble, Orihime still comments how despite the dangers she faced he never actually showed up. From behind, Chad emerges and reveals that everyone has arrived.

She then wishes that it could go on forever, with everyone helping each other and protecting their worlds without any bloodshed occurring.

Believing Ichigo will think she is an exhibitionist, Orihime explains how Urahara told her Ichigo would be very happy if she wore these clothes and tries to cover them up, only for Yoruichi to arrive and scold Ichigo for not understanding Orihime's situation.
        As they are propelled towards the Palace, Orihime reminisces about how their situation resembles their attempt to rescue Rukia, except Uryū is not on their side this time. She asks if Uryū will come back, prompting Ichigo to say that he will force him back if necessary.

    ): is Orihime's defensive technique. It repels attacks by placing a shield between the enemy and target.
    The incantation arranges Hinagiku, Lily, and Baigon into a triangle which has the ability to repel the "outer shield".
    Because the barrier rejects negative events, it can also function as an airbag of sorts, allowing Orihime and anyone else nearby to survive a potentially lethal fall unharmed.
    Orihime is later able to shape Santen Kesshun into a dome-shaped barrier large enough to easily hold herself and other individuals.

    It rejects, reverses, and reconstructs phenomena that have occurred, even phenomena that Orihime hasn't witnessed.
    The incantation summons Ayame and Shun'ō to form a half-oval barrier around whatever or whomever Orihime wishes. Their ability is to repel the "inner shield." The shield placed inside means that they repel the damage within a limited area. In other words, they return a subject covered by the shield to the state that they were in before taking damage.

     I was proud of my hair color that my brother admired. I was happy to be told such things, so I grew my hair out ever since I was little. Soon after I entered middle school, 3rd years said they didn't like my hair color and cut it. I had no choice but to cut the rest short to even it out. I couldn't tell brother.'I felt like changing it', is what I said to dodge the question. Then my brother died soon after. I became alone. I stopped talking, even at school, and became more alone than ever before. The one who stopped me from being that way was Tatsuki-chan. Tatsuki-chan yelled at me for backing down and she looked out for me. I could grow my hair out again thanks to her. I will never have short hair again, because my long hair is proof of my faith in Tatsuki-chan.

     It's not frustrating at all. It's just... it's going to be lonely, not being able to fight alongside everyone. But being lonely isn't nearly as bad as being in the way. If I'm just going to be a hindrance to Kurosaki-kun, to everyone, then it's far better to be lonely

     Kurosaki-kun, you know I had a lot of things I wanted to do... I want to be a teacher... I also want to be an astronaut... and also make my own cake shop... I want to go to the sweets bakery and say 'I want one of everything'... Ohhhh, I wish I could live life five times over. Then I’d be born in five different places, and I’d stuff myself with different food from around the world... I’d live five different lives with five different occupations... and then, for those five times... I’d fall in love with the same person...

     Kurosaki-kun... doesn't assure us he is going to win for that reason. Kurosaki-kun is a kind person. Whenever he uses strong words, it's like he's making a promise. I believe that, he makes a promise to himself. I think that he expresses his feelings in words so that he will follow through. So that's why it's okay. When Kurosaki-kun says he is going to win, he'll win for sure. So...so that's why we should wait and believe in him.

     Maybe it's impossible to feel exactly the same way as another person, but it's possible for people to care about one another and to place their hearts as close together as they can manage. I'm sure that's what it means to make your hearts as one.
