        Ikkaku came from the streets of
        Rukongai
        . At some point, he met
        Yumichika Ayasegawa
        , and the two became friends. The two would frequently go from village to village, looking for opponents for Ikkaku to face in combat.

        They had an encounter with
        Kenpachi Zaraki
        and
        Yachiru Kusajishi
        before they entered

        . Yachiru told him messing with Kenpachi while he was in a good mood was a bad idea, but Ikkaku did not take the warning seriously. When face to face with Kenpachi, he, becoming alarmed by his

        , was happy to finally have a real challenge. Kenpachi attacked with enough force to crater the ground under Ikkaku, which somewhat alarmed Yumichika. Due to Kenpachi's strength, Ikkaku, forced on the defensive, held off his relentless strikes. The two continued to battle, with Ikkaku trying to overwhelm Kenpachi, though unable to wear him down, only succeeding in receiving wounds while Kenpachi remained untouched by his blade. Stating he was having fun, Kenpachi decided to finish Ikkaku with one strike, resulting in Ikkaku losing the fight.
        As Ikkaku became mad Kenpachi would just walk away without finishing him off, Kenpachi, telling him he had no interest in weaklings who cannot fight, states he did not have any obligation to finish Ikkaku off. When Ikkaku, thinking he was toying with him, demanded Kenpachi kill him, Kenpachi, losing his patience, grabbed hold of Ikkaku. Asking why he was screaming for death if he loved to fight so much, Kenpachi explained to him a philosophy to follow for people like them: only admit defeat after death, and when you survive, consider yourself lucky and only think about killing the man who failed to kill you. Smiling at him, Kenpachi stated it was not like he went easy on him; he was just lucky to escape death. He said Ikkaku should live and come back to kill him. As Kenpachi left, Ikkaku, asking him his name, was told he was Kenpachi from Zaraki.

        Afterwards, when he had rehabilitated from his wounds, Ikkaku, searching everywhere for Kenpachi in order to challenge him, could never find him, until one day when Yumichika came to him with some news. He had heard Kenpachi had beaten the captain of the

        of the
        Gotei 13
        in a single blow, which made him the new captain of this division. Taken aback by this revelation, having seen protecting others as not really Kenpachi's style, Ikkaku set out to find his old opponent.

        During an address to his division, Kenpachi was greeted by Ikkaku and Yumichika, who had become Shinigami and joined the division. Ikkaku told Kenpachi he had come back just as he had suggested, which prompted Kenpachi to smile. Later, they were present when the division battled a caterpillar-like

        . After the division lost several members, Ikkaku, showing up to fight it, was stopped by Kenpachi, who decided to kill it himself. After the Hollow was dispatched, more came, which prompted Ikkaku and Yumichika to join in the fight. Initially against it, Kenpachi was persuaded upon realizing the two had fighting traits similar to his.

After Renji stated he had someone he wished to surpass, they continued to train well into the evening, advancing as far as using their

Telling Renji his name, he instructed him to remember it, for the next time they fight will be to the death. Explaining to him why he gives his name to his opponent, Ikkaku left as Renji thanked him.

After resolving why Ichigo did not run away as well, Ikkaku

Spinning the bladed end, he advances, prompting Ichigo to yell at him to put it away, having already lost. Refusing, Ikkaku states he will only lay down his weapon when he is dead, and he will never walk away from a fight like a coward. The two collide, resulting in

Realizing he does not really pray to any god, he decides it does not matter, for he will just pray to the Arrancar's god. Poww retorts that this shouldn't be a problem, for their god and king knows full well he is no match for him.

When Iba, saying Komamura's Bankai is amazing, notes the difference between the captain's Bankai and his is like night and day, a shocked Ikkaku looks on as Iba, asking him if he did not think he would notice, promises not to tell his captain. Scolding Ikkaku, he tells him his job was to protect the pillar, and yet it was destroyed. Telling Ikkaku this happened because he wants to hide his strength, Iba states he does not care if Ikkaku dies because he wants to hide his strength, but he should not disobey orders to do so. Noting Ikkaku's stubbornness has cost them in battle, Iba tells him as long as he is in the
   Gotei 13
   , he must obey orders, even if it means crushing his stubbornness and pride. When Ikkaku tries to explain himself, Iba punches him in the face. As an irate Ikkaku, trying to fight back, is pushed to the side, Iba asks him why he would attack head-on in his condition, for there is no point in coming at him head-on if he is just going to get crushed. When he notes he has to win, even if it means running away or sneaking up from behind, Ikkaku states it is something a coward would do, and he is no coward, which prompts Iba to tell him to get stronger and win, even at the cost of his life.
   As Ikkaku notices Komamura standing behind Iba, he, wiggling his ears, tells them not to worry, for his ears appear to be failing him today.

     Later, the Shinigami who stayed in the Human World hold a meeting in Ichigo's room regarding the current status of the captains who are in Soul Society. When
     Marechiyo Ōmaeda
     suggests they are all dead, an angry Ikkaku, stating his captain would not have been defeated so easily, reveals he would rather fight the Reigai than protect Nozomi. While she is training with Ichigo and his friends, Ikkaku, watching quietly from the side, is approached by Yumichika. Confronting Nozomi as she is washing her face, he tells her to start taking the training seriously and hit back just as hard as she is getting hit. When Reigai-Kenpachi
     enters the Human World
     , Ikkaku confronts him in order to buy time for Nozomi to learn the name of her Shikai, refusing the help of other Shinigami in the process, and is soundly defeated. As Reigai-Kenpachi prepares to cut him down, Nozomi, arriving, uses her powers to blast the Reigai away. Marveling at her power, Ikkaku collapses.
     As the unfazed Reigai-Kenpachi is engaged by Yumichika, Ichigo retreats with Ikkaku so he can be healed by Orihime.

     Later, Ikkaku, making a near-full recovery, boasts his remaining injuries are nothing. Returning to Soul Society with his fellow Shinigami, he finds Kenpachi fighting his Reigai counterpart. When Ikkaku insists on helping him, Kenpachi tells him to worry about the "

     When the Reigai corner the Shinigami,
     Byakuya Kuchiki
     realizes the Reigai share the same trait of self-preservation, and will not attack first out of fear of being outnumbered. Hearing this, Ikkaku and Yumichika join Kenpachi, having resolved long ago to die by his side regardless.
     Later, the resurrected

   Yumichika Ayasegawa
   , Ikkaku was the 2nd strongest man in the 11th Division when he was the 3rd Seat.
   He uses a fighting style noted to be rough, but powerful, and complex movements which allow him to lunge with his sword from the left and defend with his sheath at the right, though he is ambidextrous and can switch between the two techniques. Ikkaku commonly fights with his sword held in a normal grip and the sheath held in reverse grip, showing his mastery of the two variations of sword-fighting. He uses misdirection in his attacks, and even though doing so allows for holes in his defense, he can make up for it with surprise attacks.
   His mastery of this skill is great enough for
