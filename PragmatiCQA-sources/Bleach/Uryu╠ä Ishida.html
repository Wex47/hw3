   Uryū Ishida is a bespectacled teenager of average height and slender build. He has straight, chin-length black
   hair framing both sides of his face, and is fair-skinned with blue eyes. In school, Uryū wears the respective school uniform along with a tie. When confronting Hollows, he typically dons white Quincy clothes, with blue stripes representing the Quincy cross, and a mantle.

   Uryū is generally quiet and solitary, but tries harder to act cool when other people are around. Uryū is a member of the handicrafts club at Karakura High School, and is highly skilled at sewing. While Uryū does not mind stitching things for his friends, his sense of design forces him to add unexpected designs. For example, when he makes new clothing for Chad and Orihime, he replaces the single red line of Chad's original shirt with a red cross, saying that it was

   </i>
   , and since he could not copy the three white dots on Orihime's shirt, he instead adds frilly lace and two flower-like buds at the bottom.
   Uryū has low blood pressure and hates procrastination.
   The other things he hates are quite odd: buttons (despite being an expert in sewing)
   and the word "haphazard." His favorite food is homemade
   mackerel
   miso
   stew.

   He loves wearing a mantle, even though it serves no purpose other than to make him feel cooler, despite the fact that it hinders his movement, even keeping a spare with him. He has a tendency to say things melodramatically. Uryū has proven to be gullible at times. During an omake, he starts getting irritated at the fact that a weapon (a Zanpakutō in this case) has a will of own; Ichigo tricks him into thinking that Ginrei Kōjaku has actually materialized, to which Uryū sheds a happy tear.
   Uryū operates on a moral ethic known as the "Pride of the Quincy" and has a strong sense of justice. He is very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly, leading him to attempt to defend

   As a child, Uryū mostly interacted and trained with his grandfather, Sōken Ishida. His father, Ryūken Ishida, was less than enthusiastic about being a Quincy, claiming that it was not a profitable occupation. They do not appear to be on very good terms as a result, given Uryū's casual use of his father's given name. Sōken understands Ryūken's reasoning, since being a Quincy is more about justice than material rewards, and Ryūken has a family to support. Sōken told Uryū that he would someday understand his father's motives, but thus far this is not the case. This was compounded as Uryū would watch Ryūken dissect Kanae's dead body, and he begged his father to stop. That day, he decided he would never become a doctor.

        Michiru Ogawa
        hands him a ripped doll to fix. He then takes a sewing set out and easily (but with great drama) repairs the broken doll. As he heads home, he spots Ichigo following him. He mocks Ichigo for not being able to hide his spiritual pressure, and for his inability to sense others with high spiritual pressure. He tells Ichigo that since the day he entered school, he knew of his high spiritual pressure, when he became a Shinigami, and even Rukia's true identity. Uryū then draws out something called Reiraku, and states that it is something that compresses and visualizes the spiritual aura in the atmosphere. He again mocks Ichigo's ignorance, and, grabbing hold of Ichigo's Reiraku, points out that the Reiraku of Shinigami are colored red. He then tells him that he is a Quincy, and that he holds the power to kill Hollows. He asks Ichigo to fight him to show the difference in their strength.

        Ichigo tells him that he will give this competition a shot and enters his Shinigami form, with

He declares that whoever kills the most Hollows within twenty-four hours is the winner. However, Ichigo protests against this idea, as the people in town will be put in danger, but Uryū tells him that caring for others is unnecessary, and that he should be confident enough to save them all.

        Hollows begin breaking into Karakura Town, and Uryū shoots the first one down. As he is doing this, Ichigo grabs him and tells him to bring the town back to normal. However, Uryū states that it is too late, and that instead of focusing on him, he should be focusing on the Hollows so he can save as many people as possible. He tells him that Hollows have a tendency to go after people with high spiritual pressure, and Ichigo realizes his family is in danger. He immediately runs off to save his family, missing what Uryū tries to tell him as he leaves.
        Uryū begins shooting Hollows from the high vantage point of a bridge, reaching up to eleven kills.
        After killing many Hollows, Uryū's shots begin to get weaker, and he realizes that the numbers should not be this high. He decides not to complain and remembers his mentor, telling him he has not made any mistakes and that he will avenge him.

Uryū comments on their current location being safe, which prompts Kon to question him, saying that it is because of Uryū starting the fight that the town is danger. Uryū addresses Kon, admitting that while he did start the fight, he will not allow anyone in the town to die, even if Ichigo dies. Suddenly, the weak Hollow returns to attack. Uryū prepares to shoot the Hollow, only for it to be swiftly killed by Ichigo as he arrives at the scene.

Ichigo then insists that it is a battle between him and Uryū, and that the amount of Hollows they beat is irrelevant. Before Uryū can respond, Kon points out a large crack forming in the sky, and Uryū notes that the Hollows are converging upon it. Uryū begins to fire arrows into the group of Hollows and charges towards it, shouting that the last Quincy will be their opponent.

Uryū says that he must prove the strength of the Quincy to the Shinigami. Ichigo points out that his sensei's wish was to work together, not to prove the Quincy's strength, and asks if he will do that now, saying that fighting back-to-back is the best way to deal with the situation.

Ichigo tells Uryū that there is no way they can figure out how to fight such a monster, and that they will have to simply cut it repeatedly until it succumbs to its injuries. He charges towards the Menos, calling for Uryū to accompany him, despite Uryū's request for him to wait.

He then checks on Ichigo's status, and asks what was he thinking. In response to Uryū's questions, Ichigo tells him that he is alright, and that he thought he could cut its feet off and work his way up to the head, killing it that way. Uryū complains about his way of thinking and places his hand on Ichigo's Zanpakutō.
        Uryū notices that Ichigo's power is flowing into his bow. Thinking about the differences between the fighting styles of the Quincy and Shinigami, Uryū comes up with an idea to make use of Ichigo's large amount of power. Ichigo is shocked to see the increased size of Uryū's bow, and as he asks what happened to it, Uryū tells him his idea.

Ichigo blocks the Cero with his Zanpakutō, and Uryū notes Ichigo's power increasing as he resisted the Cero. Ichigo repels the attack, injuring the Menos in the process.
        As the Menos retreats from the Human World, Ichigo yells "Victory", and asks Uryū whether he is going to thank him for his help before collapsing. Uryū notices Ichigo's Zanpakutō beginning to lose its form. The energy released from Ichigo and his Zanpakutō causes Uryū's bow to grow again. Noting that it will explode, Uryū begins to fire arrows into the sky to release the excess power and stabilize Ichigo, injuring himself. Ichigo tells him not to overdo it, as he will lose his arm. Uryū tells him to make sure that he lives so that he can beat him later. Uryū realizes his mistake of misunderstanding his sensei and being so useless, asking to be forgiven for his mistake.

Yoruichi accepts his apology, insulting Uryū for making a fuss over a talking cat.

Thinking that there is no point in dealing with someone with no desire to go to Soul Society, Yoruichi beckons both Sado and Orihime to leave, and the three of them take their leave.

Uryū and Orihime answer that they are from the 11th Division, but Aramaki, unable to recognize them, checks Orihime's uniform. He becomes suspicious, asking them why they are wearing 12th Division uniforms and why they were walking without their Zanpakutō. Aramaki, however, is knocked out by members of the 12th Division, who claim that they have to protect those in the same divisions. As Orihime talks with them, Uryū realizes how strange it is for them to rescue the pair, as Aramaki's reasoning did make sense. He rushes to get Orihime away as the 12th Division members are blown up by

        Orihime is saddened by the deaths of the 12th Division members, and Uryū tries to comfort her. He turns his sights on Mayuri, who is now interested in studying Orihime because of her shield. Uryū suddenly moves next to Mayuri, pointing a bow at him, but is noticed by him, who tells Uryū that he is pretty fast for a Quincy. Mayuri states that they are a rare breed, and that he has not seen one alive for many years, but he notes that he has no interest in the Quincy, as he finished studying their kind some time ago. When Uryū questions who he is, Mayuri is taken aback at the idea that Uryū and his friends would invade Soul Society without researching their enemy. Mayuri gives his name, rank, and position. Uryū, realizing what they are up against, tells Orihime to run for it as he takes on Mayuri. Orihime refuses, so Uryū forces Aramaki to get her out of harm's way. Not about to lose a test subject, Mayuri extends his arm to catch Orihime, but it is shot off by one of Uryū's spiritual arrows.

        Uryū is angered by Mayuri's callous disregard for his own lieutenant. Mayuri reveals that he created Nemu, and mocks his sympathy as part of the meaningless "Quincy pride" they speak about until their last breath. He recalls the last Quincy he researched, who kept on calling out the name of his student, and shows Uryū a photograph, which depicts his own grandfather. Uryū states that he is thankful Orihime is not there to witness their fight, and swears on his "Quincy pride" that he will kill Mayuri.

Kneeling down next to her, Uryū finds it and tells her to drink first. Nemu states that she is made in the same way as Mayuri, and is thus unaffected by the poison. Uryū questions her intentions, but she explains that he is already dying, and it is in gratitude for not shooting her father and creator in the head, which would have been fatal. Uryū says that he intended to kill him, claiming that he missed, and takes the antidote. Leaving Nemu, he finds his way up the stairs to the Shishinrō.

   Back in Karakura Town, Uryū is attacked by a
   Menos Grande
   . He attempts to use some Quincy equipment to defeat it, but is ultimately unsuccessful.
   It is not until the arrival of his father, Ryūken Ishida, that the Hollow is vanquished. Disappointed by Uryū's weakness, Ryūken offers to restore his Quincy powers, on the condition that Uryū never associate with Shinigami again.
   Uryū agrees, and trains with his father in
   Karakura Hospital's secret training ground
   whilst Arrancar continue to attack Karakura Town. Before the third Arrancar Invasion begins, Uryū regains his powers, ending his training.

Uryū and Renji watch the battle between the two scientists and witness Mayuri's ultimate victory over Szayelaporro.

     Uryū dodges Inaba's Kidō, with the latter deducing he is a Quincy. Uryū explains that his motive for restricting their passage is to prevent trouble in the town, instructing Inaba to leave at once. Uryū states he has already determined Inaba to be an enemy, who tells his subordinates to stand down. Uryū fires a multitude of arrows at Inaba, all of which are unable to hit him due to his Shunpo. He fires another arrow at him, only for it to be deflected by his cane. Inaba then explains the secret behind Uryū's abilities, to which Uryū comments upon his deductive reasoning, comparing his attire to that of

Uryū walks away, commenting that if he hadn't been their enemy, they would have gotten along well. However, Inaba's voice reverberates through the area, and Uryū turns back, noticing that his body has vanished. As Uryū looks upwards, Inaba appears on the side of a building, completely uninjured.

Inaba apologizes for rendering his powers useless, stating that he'll end Uryū's suffering. He attempts to use Kidō on Uryū, but Orihime promptly intervenes with

As Ichigo joins the Gotei 13 in a meeting, Uryū helps set up a barbecue for Nozomi. When Kon eats some chili powder and goes berserk from the heat, Uryū pins him to a wall with his arrows. During this time, Nozomi escapes. Uryū and the others split up to save her. After finally rescuing Nozomi, Uryū enjoys the barbecue with all the others.

     Later, Urahara retrieves information on the events happening in Soul Society. Uryū is surprised he is able to do so, but Urahara says it would be to their disadvantage not to be able to. As Ichigo asks to go to Soul Society, Kon begins saying that if he were to leave, they would have no one left to fight and repeatedly calls Uryū four eyes, noticeably perturbing him. As Nozomi heals Ichigo's Reiatsu, she grows tired; Uryū speculates that it a result of having not used her Shinigami powers in a while.

     Kon tries to convince Ichigo to stay once more and asks if the others can help. Uryū says they could try, but it would do nothing, as he is too stubborn.
     Uryū sits down as Urahara gathers information on Soul Society. As he looks over at Nozomi, Kon yells at him and Uryū grabs him, taking him outside to talk. Uryū asks Kon if he noticed anything strange about Nozomi, because Inaba is after her. Uryū reflects on the conclusion the others came to that something is hidden within Nozomi, and wonders what could be hidden within her. He voices this to Kon, but he just imagines her naked and gets embarrassed. He asks Uryū why he asked, and Uryū says it is obvious Kon likes her. Kon tries to say he does not and leaves Uryū, heading inside.
     When Urahara informs everyone that Ichigo's Reiatsu has vanished, Uryū asks what he means, and Urahara says it is exactly as it sounds. After Nozomi worries about Ichigo, Kon says it will take more than that to kill Ichigo, and Uryū agrees.

After Urahara picks up a signal of Ichigo's Reiatsu, he tells Uryū and the others to accompany him.
     After Ichigo wakes, Uryū and the others greet him. While Urahara explains the improbability of Ichigo's survival in the Dangai, Uryū listens intently. He explains the reason behind Inaba's Dangai research, prompting Uryū to ask Urahara how he knew this.

     Uryū comes across Ichigo, in his Human form, trying to evade the attacks of a Hollow. He kills it, saying that it is lucky that he was passing by. Ichigo thanks him and invites him to dinner, saying that Kon lacks energy and needs to be cheered up. At dinner, a very energetic Kon, in Ichigo's body, irritates Uryū, who wishes he had a little less energy.

After accidentally firing on Nozomi, who quickly absorbs his attack, Uryū realizes that Nozomi's blade can absorb any kind of spiritual energy. He suggests that everyone focus all their energy on Nozomi, so she can use it for one final counterattack. They launch their attacks on Nozomi, who directs the accumulated energy at the Reigai, defeating all except for the Reigai-Byakuya, who counters with a blast of his own, knocking out everyone except for Ichigo and Nozomi. Yamamoto arrives, and quickly defeats the last Reigai.
     Shortly afterwards, the Reigai of Kyōraku and Ukitake appear. As Uryū and Sado recover, they are told to take the unconscious Shinigami to Orihime so they can be healed.

While Ichigo puts up a tough facade about losing his power, Uryū can see how much it is hurting his pride. While discussing how to act next, Uryū brings up a question that has been plaguing him; why was Inaba so concerned by Ichigo's presence. Urahara deduces that Inaba is unable to produce a Reigai of a being with Hollow powers. Concerned about Ichigo, Inaba resorted to using the Kōtotsu to get rid of Ichigo. Uryū listens as Urahara theorizes that they may be able to restore Ichigo's Reiatsu by acquiring the Reishi swallowed by the Kōtotsu. After Ichigo collects the Reishi, Uryū and the others act as a diversion in the Dangai while Ichigo and Urahara sneak into Soul Society.

When Ichigo arrives sometime after her, very worried, Uryū scolds him rather harshly for coming, attempting to keep him from getting involved. Ryūken enters the room shortly after, commenting that Uryū talks too much. Uryū asks him if he is allowed to have visitors, as they might have a bad effect on his wounds. Ryūken reminds him that he himself did the surgery, and that his wounds will not worsen. He further comments that Uryū, who was cut down, should not be ordering around his doctor. Upon hearing Ryūken's words, Ichigo asks Uryū what had happened to him, and if he could not handle it himself, then he should have gotten help. Uryū says nothing in response, prompting Ryūken to state that sharing information is important, and he should not let his kindness go to waste. Uryū tells Ryūken to be quiet, and asks Orihime to go home. Orihime complies and leaves the room along with Ichigo and Ryūken.

        Later, Uryū is visited in the hospital by Orihime. He apologizes for the sudden call and thanks her for coming. She asks if it is alright for him to be up, and he says it is fine for this. She offers to heal his wounds, saying he will be up in no time if she does. He replies that he knows, and that he was out of sorts when he initially refused. He wanted to get away if he was the true target, but the situation has changed, and he now wants her to heal him. Orihime asks what he means, and Uryū responds that Ichigo has come into contact with his attacker, which shocks Orihime. He says that there has been a shift in his Reiatsu, but it is definitely Ichigo, and asks Orihime if she has felt it too. Orihime confirms this, saying that Ichigo has chosen not to tell her anything so far. She states that whoever attacked Uryū and Ichigo is the same person who attacked her, shocking Uryū.
        Uryū tries to think about the nature of this, but comes up short. Orihime says that the attacker called his ability

Uryū tells him that the man that attacked him was the one standing behind him, Kūgo, surprising Ichigo. Uryū fires his arrows at Kūgo, but he blocks them and cuts Ichigo down. Uryū tries to assist him, but Tsukishima attacks Uryū from behind, wounding him.

        As Tsukishima and Kūgo are about to leave, the Shinigami arrive and use a Reishi-enhanced katana to restore Ichigo's Shinigami powers. They explain that they restored Ichigo's powers, not only as thanks for his past services, but also to deal with the original Substitute Shinigami turned traitor; Kūgo himself.
        As Ichigo prepares to face off against Kūgo, Uryū reveals himself, saying that Rukia healed him. He says he needs to apologize to Ichigo, saying that when they returned from Soul Society and Ichigo received his substitute badge, he had assumed there were others before Ichigo. He thought that if the previous one was alive, they would have told him, and if he was dead, they would say why. Having not said either, he assumed that Soul Society did not know either. He says he should have told this to Ichigo sooner, but Ichigo simply kicks him. Ichigo says it doesn't matter, there was nothing they could have done, and he would have forgotten in a few days anyway. The two friends insult each other, before Uryū begins to think that the worst case would be if none of the scenarios he thought of were applicable. Ichigo tells him to clean his glasses, as he thinks the possibility of it is unlikely, but it is not something Ichigo needs to know.

Kūgo dismisses this, instructing Uryū to fire an arrow at him, and begins talking about Ichigo's Substitute Shinigami Badge. He states that the story about Substitute Shinigami who are acknowledged being awarded the badge is a lie; something Uryū had suspected. Kūgo states that all Substitute Shinigami are given a badge regardless, which shocks Uryū. Kūgo goes on to say that the badge's true purpose is to observe and restrict Ichigo as a Shinigami. Kūgo says that this whole scheme was designed to control Substitute Shinigami, and that

        After Yhwach completely absorbs the Soul King, Haschwalth informs Uryū and the others of this fact, to their surprise, before bringing them to the Soul King's chambers, where they find Yhwach oozing darkness. When Yhwach turns around to reveal that he has gained several more eyes, Uryū and the others are shocked. As the top of the palace shatters due to Yhwach's immense power, Uryū watches as Haschwalth asks Yhwach to lead them.

        Uryū later returns to Yhwach's palace, and is greeted by Haschwalth, who says that he looks like he has a lot on his mind. Uryū reciprocates that, and Haschwalth reminds him that when Yhwach falls asleep, his powers switched with the emperor's. Haschwalth states that seeing Uryū's future worries him, and Uryū attempts to keep calm and convince him that nothing is happening, but Haschwalth will not say what he saw in the future. Haschwalth brings out little objects that Uryū scattered around

Uryū says that he has the wrong idea, and Haschwalth decides to prove whether Uryū is a traitor or not as he attacks the Quincy. Uryū dodges the strike and tells Haschwalth to wait, when he is suddenly face to face with Ichigo.

Uryū shoots two arrows at Ichigo, which the Shinigami dodges as he and Uryū clash head-on. Ichigo asks Uryū what he is trying to do as Uryū forces him flying back and shoots an arrow into the ground right in front of Ichigo, creating a large hole. Ichigo asks Uryū why he is siding with the Quincy, but Uryū says that telling him accomplishes nothing. Uryū tosses out his

Ichigo shouts at Uryū that there was no need to do this and all they needed to do was destroy Yhwach, but Uryū replies that there is no way to defeat him and that this was something only he could do. The destruction chips were passed down to him from his master, meaning only his Reiatsu could activate them, and this would be their only way to win. Uryū tells Ichigo to move before Haschwalth notices, but Haschwalth steps forward, reminding Uryū that he knew what the Quincy was going to do.

Ichigo argues, but Uryū assures his friend that he will not die. As Ichigo, Orihime, and Sado run off, Uryū asks Haschwalth why he is not chasing them. Haschwalth replies that he knows they will perish, and Uryū says that fate could be changed. Haschwalth expresses his surprise at the change in Uryū's demeanor, and Uryū smugly remarks that Haschwalth failed to foresee this change and that he has yet to fully grasp

As morning breaks, Uryū states that Haschwalth missed his chance to take him down before the sun rose, but Haschwalth is incredulous about that, comparing Uryū to a tamed animal. Uryū takes the comparison as a compliment, but Haschwalth says that his powers are more suited to combat as he fires a blast of energy at a shocked Uryū.

When Haschwalth reminds him that he has already seen a future where all of Uryū's allies die, Uryū states that this is subject to change as he proved earlier, prompting Haschwalth to admit that this is true before revealing that

        Uryū manages to dodge Haschwalth's stab at the last minute before noting Haschwalth's comparison of him to his friends. Admitting that he has tried to remain calm and weigh his actions on scales up until this point, Uryū states that he cannot help but follow Ichigo's lead because he will help someone without question, which he notes is also true for Orihime, Sado, Renji, and Rukia. When Uryū claims that he would feel great joy if he began to resemble any one of them, Haschwalth dismisses his emotions before explaining that he was referring to Uryū's growth, as the single moment where Yhwach granted him power gave him far more growth than all the years he spent with his friends, and that it is more logical for him to side with Yhwach because of this. However, Uryū states that he chose to side with them not because it would benefit him, but because they were his friends. Angered by this, Haschwalth notes that Uryū never expected to give up anything in return for being taken in by Yhwach before declaring that Uryū will give Yhwach his life, only to be interrupted when an

        Haschwalth collapses and, upon seeing a concerned Uryū looking at him, claims that he does not feel betrayed by Yhwach because the latter chose to take his power over Uryū's, which means only he can be an asset to Yhwach. When Uryū begins to walk away, Haschwalth asks him to come back so he can transfer Uryū's wounds to himself, shocking Uryū. Noting that he will die regardless of how wounded he is, Haschwalth reminds Uryū of how he puts everything on his scales because he might come to regret everything if he merely follows others without considering the consequences of his actions before telling him to save his friends.

       , greatly increasing his abilities. In this state, his Kojaku is solid, and is covered in an intricate pattern. It is attached to his glove by a series of thin struts. This new bow allows Uryū to fire several shots simultaneously. By removing the glove, Uryū attains the Quincy: Letzt Stil. This gives him a vast increase in power, enough to defeat a captain class Shinigami with Bankai in only one shot. All the extra energy collects on his right shoulder, much like how a quiver is worn. As a result of removing the glove, however, the Quincy: Letzt Stil uses too much power for Uryū's body to handle, causing his body to block his Quincy powers completely after it wears off.

     She knows that if she tries to help, she'll just be in the way. Plus, even if she is able to help Kurosaki wouldn't want her to.

     "You think I...am similar to Ichigo and the others? All this time, I have always stayed calm and collected... balancing each decision on the scales that you speak of... but Ichigo is a fool, so he can't do that. When he wants to save someone, he goes to save them. Orihime-san is a fool too, and Sado is a fool. Rukia is a fool, and Abarai is a fool. If I seem to you in any way similar to that bunch of fools...that makes me very happy."
