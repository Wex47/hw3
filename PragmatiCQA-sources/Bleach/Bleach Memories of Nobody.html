As the Hollow jumps from tree to tree, the curious Humans watch from the ground despite being unable to see it.

Despite this, the Hollow continues to charge, but Ichigo stands in its path and effortlessly blocks its subsequent attack with

As he clutches his side in pain, Rukia grabs Kon and forces his lips to Ichigo's, causing them both to gag. Rukia reminds Ichigo he has Kon and states she is tired of him tossing his body all over the place while leaving her to take care of it. When Ichigo asks why, Rukia demonstrates how someone would react if they saw his body lying on the ground.

A bemused Rukia says she told him so as Ichigo frantically runs towards his body. Returning to his body, Ichigo bolts up, shocking the people around him, and says he is fine. When the doctors try to restrain him, an exasperated Rukia uses her

Ichigo continues to attempt to get her attention, only for Senna to point out his body lying on the ground with three police officers next to it, one of which is reporting to the police station. As a shocked Ichigo notices Kon's pill on the ground, Senna states she has to get going, but Ichigo grabs her by the arm and pulls her along while Rukia calls him a fool.

   Stating this dimension grew bigger and bigger until it connected to both worlds, Urahara details how it now acts as a lens, leading to the Human World appearing in the sky above Soul Society, and notes it resembles a mirage more than anything. Hitsugaya reveals they sent the Onmitsukidō in to enter the new dimension, but the mission ended in complete failure, and asserts the only option left to them was to investigate the influx of new spiritual waves into the Human World before revealing he is in charge of this mission, which is why he and Rangiku came here.

After confirming Ichigo is still with him, Urahara reveals the figures Ichigo saw are known as Blanks, Souls which have been separated from their memories.

When Ichigo asks if this is really so out of the ordinary, Hitsugaya compares this to two stars being connected and says both situations are equally unusual before theorizing someone is doing this intentionally. Hearing this, Kon hops down from Ichigo's shoulder and recounts seeing the mysterious man in the midst of the Blanks.

Saying she cannot do so yet because she has not kept her promise, Ichigo sees Jai struggle to his feet and sarcastically apologizes for cutting off his arm.

As Ichigo asks why she is here, Senna reveals her family is buried here, and when Ichigo tells her to quit with the stories, Senna insists it is true and claims she can remember it all. Asserting that they are memories from when she was still alive, Senna says her house used to be around here and promises to help Ichigo tomorrow before preparing to leave, only for Ichigo to stop her and ask if she is going to ignore how she was just attacked.

Recalling Senna stating she has memories from when she was alive, Ichigo asks Urahara if it is common for Shinigami to retain their memories from their Human life, but Urahara notes it is exceedingly rare before asking Ichigo what this is about, prompting him to say he was just wondering.

While Senna complains about it being boring, Ichigo notes there are many more people here than usual, and as Senna walks away, he states it is usually quiet around this time. Upon recalling how sensed something at the mall, Ichigo tells Senna to stay close to him. When he does not receive a response, Ichigo sees Senna is no longer there and begins frantically calling for her.

   Suddenly, Senna appears at the corner behind him and calls him over. Running over to her, Ichigo tells her to not just run off before seeing a crying Plus. As Ichigo asks what is wrong, Senna stops him, introduces herself to the Plus, and asks what his name is. When the young Plus reveals his name is Tomoya, Senna asks him to tell her what is wrong, and when he says his father is gone, Senna asks if he was with him. Confirming this, Tomoya states they were driving to a festival when he fell asleep, but when he woke up, his father was gone.

When Senna and Tomoya head off, Ichigo sighs in exasperation and follows them. As they walk all over town and up a hill in search of Tomoya's father, Ichigo carries Tomoya on his shoulders and asks how long they will do this.

   When Tomoya calls to her, Senna asks him what is up and runs over as Tomoya pulls her into an enclosed area. Running after them, Ichigo enters the enclosed space and sees a traditional festival in the pavilion, to his surprise. Tomoya points out his father is not here, but Senna tells him to not worry and states they will keep looking. As they walk, Senna says she is glad the festival is still here and claims that she came here a lot when she was a kid. Ichigo begins to say something, but they are suddenly interrupted upon hearing a man calling Tomoya's name.

Noting Senna has not noticed, Tomoya's father reveals the souls gathered here led him to this place.

As Ichigo sees Senna in her Gigai clothes and expresses confusion, Senna points out that Ichigo would also disappear if the world ended and declares that she does not want this to happen.
  </p>
  <p key="1b9d8526-5217-4d40-994f-2c7c401a1357">
   As she does this, Senna begins to glow. When Ichigo tells her to stop, Senna admits that she would rather sacrifice herself than let him die. As Senna is enveloped by a whirlwind, Ichigo yells her name and reaches for her, only to be enveloped by the wind as well. A green column of light grows brighter as Rin reveals they have reports of countless spiritual explosions in the Dangai, and the Human World and Soul Society are both stabilizing because the fusion has stopped.

  <p key="48eadadc-e95a-42c1-917f-081a1efd1dc8">
   Some time later, as Senna informs him that she has a favor to ask, Ichigo carries her on his back next to the river to the graveyard where they first met the Dark Ones days ago. While Ichigo carries her through the rows of gravestones, Senna reveals that she wants to check her family grave because they were here yesterday and states that she knows she once lived in this town. Claiming that she had parents and was alive, Senna asserts that her name must be on the gravestone. Stopping in front of one of the gravestones, Ichigo asks her if this is it, prompting Senna to clarify that it is four stones from the end.
  </p>
  <p key="e6d39d0c-4633-4117-bf6b-36c40d50d4b3">
   When Ichigo arrives at the gravestone, Senna asks if there is a name on it and claims to have something in her eye, but Ichigo sees two names on the gravestone, neither of which are hers. However, when Senna asks if her name is there, Ichigo calmly tells her that it is. Standing up, he assures Senna that she used to live in this town and had a family. Crying, a smiling Senna says she is happy to have learned this. As she begins to fade, Senna states she feels warm and asks Ichigo if she will see him again, and Ichigo promises her that she will.
  </p>
  <p key="7bc6cf07-0957-4771-a943-5cb50b5d265a">
   Settling in Ichigo's arms, Senna fades away completely. As Ichigo kneels, Rukia approaches him and states the Blanks' energy is about to run out, and when it does, everything related to Senna will disappear from their memories because one cannot remember something which should not have existed in the first place. Getting up, Ichigo says even though it may only last for a few more seconds, he can still hear her voice. Later, on the bridge, a strong wind causes the pedestrians to stop in their tracks. Walking along, Ichigo sees a red hair ribbon floating in the wind.
  </p>
  <p key="0deb2258-27f6-4a44-a17a-9d5ddfd5e39c">
   As Ichigo grabs the ribbon, he realizes something while a girl tells her friend to shut up and states it will be the same either way. As her friend says they will be late, the girl says she will pass and runs past Ichigo while bearing a striking resemblance to Senna. Smiling, Ichigo continues walking.
