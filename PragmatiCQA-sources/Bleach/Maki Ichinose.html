   A generally stoic and reserved man, at his core, Ichinose believes strongly in justice and the duty of those with great power to use it to help others instead of pursuing their own selfish desires, a principle instilled in him by his captain,
   Kenpachi Kiganjō
   .
   When Kiganjō was killed by

   , a distraught Ichinose refused to accept the results and was outraged at the meaninglessness of a battle between two individuals who only sought strength, which only intensified when he later challenged Kenpachi to a duel and failed to even scratch him before Kenpachi disarmed him with a single slash, leaving Ichinose with a deep grudge against Kenpachi and a feeling that he had died at that moment
   which ultimately caused him to leave the
   Gotei 13
   altogether due to his belief that his captain would always be Kiganjō,
   followed by him accepting the idea of death until a fierce encounter with a

   made him realize he did not want to die.
   By Kenpachi's analysis, Ichinose is like ivy that cannot live without clinging to trees in that he cannot stand on his own and needs someone else to give him purpose, evidenced by how he became fanatically loyal to

   Ultimately, Ichinose is closest to Kariya and acts as his right-hand man, willing to follow any order given to him and even act in his stead,
   but begins acting distracted upon entering Soul Society with the Bount,
   and when given an opportunity to finally take revenge on Kenpachi at the cost of allowing

   and his friends to pursue Kariya in direct violation of the last order given to him by the latter, Ichinose puts his own goals above Kariya's and chooses to fight Kenpachi while Ichigo's group escapes, where he firmly blames Kenpachi as representing the injustice of Soul Society which Kariya is combatting and unleashes all the wrath that had built up within him; however, Kenpachi exposes Ichinose's reliance on abstract ideals and lack of agency when he points out that the latter's stated desire to wipe away all shadows with his light is not even possible and questions if any of his supposedly noble goals are not just tasks assigned to him by someone else.
   Through this, Ichinose remembers his desire to improve the Gotei 13 and the Seireitei by even the slimmest margin, and after learning from a newly-
   empowered
   Kariya that all of the other Bount were dead, Ichinose stops fighting Ichigo and takes it upon himself to urge Kariya to use his new power to rebuild the Seireitei, having learned from experience that nothing beneficial can come from seeking revenge and seeing himself as the only one who can stop Kariya from going down the same path.

      "Before, if you told me to destroy the Seireitei, I would've had no choice but to obey you. I abandoned this place long ago, and I would not mind seeing it all disappear...at least, that's what I thought. When I looked at you, I thought I was reminded of the captain I once revered and respected. That's the reason why I fought by your side in the first place, but it was during my battle with Kenpachi that I remembered something I had forgotten. Back then, I wanted to change things. I wanted to make the Gotei 13 into something better. That was my desire. My captain and I had the same beliefs; that's why I worked so hard by his side and why I felt my ideals would never change, even if he wasn't there anymore. But when he was killed, the sheer emptiness of his death changed my ideals into a desire for revenge. So tell me: you have the power now to change Soul Society, Kariya. If you will use that power to rebuild the Seireitei - to make it the way it should be - if you promise this, I shall kneel before you once more. But if not, if you choose to use your power only for destruction and revenge, then I will stop you! Nothing can be born of vengeance. Now that Koga and all the others are dead, the only one left who can stop you...is me. So what's it gonna be?"
