   Masaki tells Ichigo that he should walk on the other side of her, but Ichigo refuses and asserts that he will walk next to the road so he can protect Masaki. Laughing at this, Masaki stands up and calls Ichigo her hero as Ichigo asks her if he can hold her hand, which Masaki says she was hoping he would ask while extending her hand. As he takes his mother's hand, Ichigo thanks her and begins walking over a bridge with her, only to suddenly stop upon seeing
   a girl
   standing next to the overflowing river several dozen meters away as he notes that she does not have an umbrella.

   Ichigo belligerently asks Rukia when he will be strong enough, prompting her to note that slaying Hollows is an excellent way to increase one's power before informing Ichigo that he will need to undergo training in order to tame his Reiatsu. As Rukia asks him to accept his fate, Ichigo swears off fate and begins to leave before turning around to ask Rukia if he can get his clothes back. That night, as Ichigo walks into the Kurosaki Clinic and announces his return, Yuzu comes downstairs and asks him if he knows where her pajamas are, leading Ichigo to ask her why he would know as he walks upstairs.

   Entering his room, Ichigo turns on the light and opens the door to his closet, where he is shocked to find Rukia lying on a makeshift bed in pajamas. As Rukia indignantly asks him why he is barging into her room like this, a dumbfounded Ichigo asks her what she is doing in here wearing Yuzu's pajamas, only for Rukia to point out that she has no home or clothes of her own before reminding Ichigo that he needs her help to become a Shinigami. When Ichigo states that he will happily pass this up, Rukia asserts that he cannot run away from it and needs to accept it.

   Suddenly, Isshin barges into Ichigo's room and demands to know if he has someone in here, prompting Ichigo to slam the closet door shut and nervously stand in front of it. When Ichigo claims that nothing is going on here, Isshin chops him in the chest, knocking the wind out of Ichigo, and opens the closet door while asking who is in there, only to find it seemingly empty aside from a pillow, which confuses him. Sheepishly closing the door, Isshin warns Ichigo to not try sneaking any girls into his room and leaves as Ichigo brushes him off and asks Rukia if she is still there while addressing her as Shinigami.

   As Ichigo pulls the closet door open again, Rukia reminds him that her name is Rukia Kuchiki while Ichigo states that they are done here and asks her if she can leave him alone now. Asserting that there is nothing Ichigo can do about their fates being joined and that he should just accept it, Rukia tells him to not get any funny ideas just because they are cohabiting before slamming the door shut as a confused Ichigo protests her terminology before giving up. The next morning, the blanket is ripped off a sleeping Ichigo, causing him to curl up while cursing his father before seeing that it was actually Rukia's doing.

   Throwing Ichigo's clothes at him, Rukia tells him to come with her, to his confusion. Shortly afterward, underneath a bridge, Rukia aims a pitching machine at Ichigo, who narrowly dodges two high-velocity baseballs while holding a bat before demanding to know what Rukia is doing. As she pelts Ichigo with dozens of baseballs while he protests, Rukia declares that this is basic Shinigami training, only for Ichigo to assert that this is not training before being hit in the face by the final baseball. Angered by this, Ichigo throws down the bat and storms off with his bag as Rukia tells him they are not done yet.

   Later, at Karakura High School, as Ichigo walks into his classroom, Keigo comes up and excitedly inquires if he and Rukia are dating, which Ichigo flatly denies. While Keigo sits down with Ichigo and teasingly asserts that he does not waste any time, Tatsuki sees Orihime looking dejected and reprimands Keigo for not realizing that Ichigo is just showing Rukia around. This prompts Keigo to lewdly ask Ichigo what he is showing her, only to be silenced when Rukia appears and coldly states that she and Ichigo are nothing more than classmates before cheerily asking Ichigo if she can talk to him.

   When Ichigo asserts that he has better things to do than this and declares that this is enough, Rukia knocks him to the ground with a wooden sword that she tosses next to him. As Rukia pulls up her own wooden sword, an irritated Ichigo gets to his feet with the sword she gave him in hand and agrees to keep training before rushing at her. Ichigo flails wildly at Rukia, who swiftly dodges each of his slashes and moves behind him as she strikes his arms, legs, and head in rapid succession. Clutching his head, Ichigo swings at Rukia again, only to be struck several more times from behind.

   As he curses at Rukia, Ichigo resumes his assault. Some time later, a visibly exhausted Ichigo continues to fight against Rukia under a tree near the river, where Rukia continues to outclass him. After taking a few seconds to catch his breath, Ichigo resumes clashing with Rukia and manages to match or evade her strikes until Rukia outmaneuvers him and holds her sword to his neck. Noting that Rukia does not have a lot of friends, Ichigo tauntingly states that he can see why, prompting Rukia to flip him onto his back with a strike to the legs before pinning him down with her sword.

   When Rukia asserts that a Shinigami cannot be friends with a Human, Ichigo claims that he was only kidding before throwing Rukia off of him and holding her down as she places her sword back at his throat. Rukia declares that she does not need friends because she lives by the Shinigami code, confusing Ichigo, before they are interrupted by the arrival of Orihime, who asks Ichigo what is going on. Getting to his feet alongside Rukia, Ichigo bashfully claims that it is nothing as Orihime greets Rukia, who returns the greeting in an overly formal manner.

   Ichigo quietly asks Rukia why she is speaking like this, and when Rukia reveals that she got it from his book, an incredulous Ichigo realizes that she has been reading his manga as Rukia claims that it is how modern people speak, which prompts Ichigo to clarify that they do not do so in this century. As she watches this, Orihime apologizes for interrupting and walks away while Ichigo notes that this was awkward because Orihime is definitely going to believe they are a couple. When Rukia tries to resume their training, Ichigo states that this is enough for one day.

Rukia closes the door while telling Ichigo that they resume training in the morning, but Ichigo opens it again and asks if this is a joke as he reminds Rukia that she has dragged him into a mess that he does not want to be in, only for Rukia to close the door again as she asserts that he needs more training.

Meanwhile, in his captain's quarters in the Seireitei, Byakuya asks Renji if he is certain of this, prompting Renji to assert that Rukia would come out to protect Ichigo if a Hollow threatened him as Byakuya picks up his Zanpakutō and departs with him.

When Byakuya asserts that she needs to take her power back from Ichigo so she can be pardoned for her crime, Rukia explains that Ichigo may die if she attempts to initiate the transfer in his current state, but Byakuya dismissively tells her to let him die.

   Looking at Ichigo, Rukia states that it was not Ichigo's fault that she gave him her powers and asks if a Shinigami's job is to let innocent men die, only for Byakuya to condescendingly note that she feels compassion for a Human.

Byakuya tells Rukia that she has until the full moon to do so and walks away with Renji as Rukia protests. After telling Renji to take the Hollow to the west, Byakuya disappears along with his lieutenant.

Pulling out a canister of liquid, which she begins rubbing on Ichigo's wounds as he grimaces in pain, Rukia asserts that Ichigo will surely die in both body and soul if they do not heal his wounds before they return him to his body. However, while Rukia keeps rubbing the liquid into his wounds, a visibly scared Ichigo asks her what they will do, which Rukia has no answer for.

In the present, having been dreaming about this event, Ichigo wakes up in his bed to find himself wrapped in bandages with Isshin sleeping in a chair next to him. When Ichigo gets his attention, Isshin opens his eyes and expresses relief that Ichigo is awake as he notes that he was in quite an accident before revealing that one of his classmates dragged him home.

When a shocked Orihime asks him if Ichigo is alright, Keigo melodramatically claims that Ichigo was killed instantly, only for Ichigo to immediately correct him as he stands nearby.

While Ichigo trains with rubber cords restraining him to a tree and pulls Rukia behind him on a tire attached to a rope, Rukia explains that Grand Fisher is a Hollow that the Shinigami have been pursuing for 54 years because it is far more powerful, agile, and deadly than any Hollow they have ever encountered.

Looking at Rukia's rabbit-like drawing, a confused Ichigo asks her if this is Grand Fisher, leading an embarrassed Rukia to admit that it is not an exact recreation.

Stating that no one could know this but Ichigo, Rukia explains that Grand Fisher sightings are rare and no one can agree on what it looks like.

Catching up to Ichigo, Grand Fisher stabs a tendril through the windshield of the car and another through the windows toward Ichigo, who is forced to dodge and climbs to the roof of another car that Grand Fisher promptly throws into the air. As he lands on his back on top of a third card, Ichigo rolls onto the ground just before the second car crashes into the third, where he promptly blocks one of Grand Fisher's claws with his Zanpakutō.

   While Rukia runs into the pavilion, Grand Fisher sinks one of his talons into Ichigo, who grunts in pain before proclaiming that he must win this fight no matter what as he begins pushing Grand Fisher back with great effort. Suddenly, a

   Grand Fisher turns its attention to Uryū and begins sending its fur tendrils at him, prompting Uryū to leap off the car and run down the street while firing more

   in rapid succession, Grand Fisher easily dodges or blocks them with his tendrils, leading Ichigo to begin advancing while deflecting or cutting through the fur tendrils Grand Fisher lashes at him with. Sliding underneath Grand Fisher, Ichigo lands a large slash on its underside, causing Grand Fisher to collapse.
  </p>
  <p key="f1030cea-c773-4604-94db-0ca0b3136a3a">
   As Grand Fisher gets to its feet and curses him, Ichigo stands back-to-back with Uryū and asserts that he has it covered now, only for Uryū to claim in turn that he needs Ichigo alive for the day he challenges him, causing Ichigo to smile. Suddenly, Grand Fisher throws a car at Ichigo and Uryū, forcing them to separate and dodge, and the two are surprised when the wind begins to pick up as Grand Fisher stands up on its hind legs and roars. Grand Fisher's fur tendrils begin whipping around the area at high speeds, causing debris to fly around as one slams into Uryū.

  <p key="0c3e3c42-ed5a-4fd9-aa75-fc4c03faf002">
   Dodging another tendril, Ichigo leaps through the windshield of a nearby bus into its interior and gets to his feet as Grand Fisher declares that his time has come. When Grand Fisher's tendrils begin stabbing into the bus through the windows, Ichigo begins blocking and deflecting them, but finds his movement hampered by the cramped space around him. After shaking one of the tendrils off his Zanpakutō and ducking to avoid another, Ichigo has his wrists bound by two tendrils despite his struggles and is lifted off the floor when two more tendrils wrap around his ankles.
  </p>
  <p key="8f6fc51d-578a-4cd6-9148-5d27af1bcf95">
   While Ichigo struggles to free himself, two large tendrils of fur encircle the bus through the interior and lift it into the air as Grand Fisher rotates it to face perpendicular to the ground. Seeing this, Uryū prepares to fire a

  </p>
  <p key="d1be2f81-a3d7-47bf-a40a-c15c37d75eeb">
   However, as Rukia looks at the destruction, she is shocked to see Ichigo riding a piece of debris up to Grand Fisher's head, where he jumps into the air with his Zanpakutō held facing down in front of him while screaming. Recalling how he promised to protect his mother as a child, Ichigo sinks his Zanpakutō into Grand Fisher's forehead up to the hilt, causing the Hollow to scream in agony as energy begins pouring out of the wound, before leaping off while smoke spews from Grand Fisher's forehead. As it falls to the ground, Grand Fisher's body disintegrates into smoke.

   Ichigo lands on his hands and knees near another bus, which he sits back against as he watches Grand Fisher's body completely disappear into a point of blue light. Running over to Ichigo, a concerned Rukia frantically asks him if he is alright, only for Ichigo to smile at her before looking at Uryū, who walks over to them with his

  </p>
  <p key="79aa4880-c830-4ad8-9fd7-a0ff493bc05c">
   As Ichigo and Rukia look on in shock, Renji stands up behind Uryū and admits that he did not think Ichigo could really destroy Grand Fisher as Ichigo angrily tries to get to his feet. Uryū collapses, leading Renji to pull his Zanpakutō out of him and note that the worst thing for a Zanpakutō is Quincy blood before cleaning his sword with a slash. While Uryū coughs up blood on the ground, Renji tells Ichigo to die and points his Zanpakutō at him, and as Rukia tries to convince him to stop, Byakuya appears and tells her to stop pretending to be a Human.
  </p>
  <p key="fe5381a4-38ca-4557-be88-5d3b349fc993">
   Walking toward Rukia, Byakuya asks her what happened to the Shinigami she strived to be and asserts that a Shinigami should not get emotionally involved with a Human before ordering Rukia to kill Ichigo. When Rukia does not respond, Byakuya states that he will not ask her again, and as she continues to remain silent, Byakuya claims that she is past being cured and orders Renji to kill them both before turning away. As Renji steps in, Ichigo gets to his feet and demands that Byakuya keep his word as he assures Rukia that he will protect her when she expresses concern for him.
  </p>
  <p key="465986e5-bf65-4ec8-91c4-50ec0eae80eb">
   Though Rukia tells him to run, Ichigo asserts that he will be staying right here, prompting Renji to charge at him. Renji begins fiercely attacking Ichigo, who is immediately forced on the defensive as he blocks Renji's swift strikes with his Zanpakutō pointing toward the ground. As Renji pushes him back with several more strikes and tries to attack Rukia behind him, Ichigo manages to block his attacks on her at the last second by spinning around to reach them as Rukia retreats, leading Renji to send Ichigo smashing into a nearby car with a particularly powerful slash that he blocks.
  </p>
  <p key="a3f993fa-0d95-4aa3-905c-76d00ef64646">
   However, though Rukia is visibly worried at this development, Ichigo merely lowers his Zanpakutō from his face and grins while claiming that Renji is somewhat slow. As an irritated Renji proclaims that he will soon be dead and charges at him, a yelling Ichigo runs forward with his Zanpakutō dragging on the ground before attacking Renji in unison. Though the clash propels him back, Ichigo flips over and regains his footing as he dodges Renji's subsequent aerial strike. Moving back, Ichigo continues to block Renji's rapid attacks, even when the latter forces him to his knees with a kick to the shin.
  </p>
  <p key="de1653d5-e60a-4e6c-92c2-e53a581069b8">
   As Ichigo and Renji spin away from this clash, Renji runs toward Ichigo nearly parallel to the ground and resumes his assault, which Ichigo manages to block or evade while successfully forcing Renji to block two attacks of his own. Spinning around Ichigo while leaning back to avoid a horizontal slash from him, Renji nearly cuts his hand, forcing Ichigo to let go of his Zanpakutō, which Renji sends spinning toward Ichigo with a powerful slash. Ichigo manages to grab his Zanpakutō out of midair and attack, but Renji meets this with a thrust of his own that forces Ichigo to his knees while blocking it.
  </p>
  <p key="101abd3e-1aa8-44e3-bef0-ad707bc5c7bf">
   Asking Ichigo if he is kidding him, Renji knocks Ichigo into the air before shoving his Zanpakutō forward with his free hand on the blade, which sends Ichigo skidding back as he blocks it. When the top of his Zanpakutō catches on a car door lying on the ground, Ichigo flips over it and regains his footing, only for Renji to run up his Zanpakutō and prepare to stab him. Ichigo manages to swing his Zanpakutō over his head, sending Renji flying behind him, where he bounces off the ground and slams feet-first into an overturned truck before landing on his hand and feet as he looks up in surprise.
  </p>
  <p key="8be4fade-a642-4242-ad44-f4d5107b19e5">
   As Ichigo rears back to attack, Renji rushes forward and meets him in a sword cross that propels Ichigo into the air, where he kicks Renji in the back. Stumbling forward, an angered Renji dodges Ichigo's followup attack that cracks the ground and kicks his Zanpakutō to the side before slamming Ichigo's head into his knee. With Ichigo flying back from the impact of this, Renji leaps into the air above him and slams him to the ground with his foot on Ichigo's face. Renji attempts to finish Ichigo off, but Ichigo manages to shake him off and attacks him with a spinning slash.

   Flipping over Ichigo's attack, Renji slashes at Ichigo when he leaps into the air in response, sending him skidding along the ground between two buses. While a coughing and wheezing Ichigo gets to his feet, Renji demands to know if this is all Ichigo has got and holds out his Zanpakutō as he asserts that it is his turn. Renji declares that Ichigo is two thousand years too early to be his equal and holds his free hand up to the base of his Zanpakutō, which begins to glow red and transform into a large, segmented, toothed blade which Renji refers to as his

Ichigo sees Byakuya slowly approaching him and declares that it is Byakuya's funeral and charges at him as he prepares to strike, only to suddenly stop short and look back in shock to see Byakuya effortlessly holding his Zanpakutō in place with two fingers near the tip as he asserts that Ichigo is slow.

   Ichigo pulls his Zanpakutō out of Byakuya's grip and spins around to slash at him once more, but Byakuya ducks and unsheathes his own Zanpakutō before slashing through Ichigo's side in a single fluid motion. As Byakuya resheathes his Zanpakutō, a stunned Ichigo collapses while Rukia calls out to him in concern. Visibly afraid, Rukia watches as Byakuya approaches her, only to stop when Ichigo tells him to wait. Seeing Ichigo getting to his feet, Rukia warns him to run because he is no match for Byakuya's strength, but Ichigo instead charges toward Byakuya while yelling.

   However, Byakuya merely unsheathes his blade, stops Ichigo's Zanpakutō in midair with the tip, slashes it down to embed Ichigo's Zanpakutō in the ground, and slashes through Ichigo's side again in a swift motion, leading Ichigo to fall over once more as Byakuya resheathes his Zanpakutō behind him. As Renji emerges from behind some wreckage, Byakuya tells Rukia that it is time for her to wake up and begins approaching her once more, but stops in visible confusion and surprise when Ichigo declares that he will protect her while getting to his feet yet again.

   While Byakuya watches in mild shock, a badly wounded Ichigo asserts that he is not finished yet and begins stumbling forward while grunting in pain and dragging his Zanpakutō on the ground behind him. With Rukia staring in concern and awe, Ichigo makes his way to Byakuya and stops several feet away from him, prompting Byakuya to narrow his eyes before rushing forward and slashing upward through Ichigo's chest. As blood falls on a stunned Ichigo's face and Rukia cries out to him, Byakuya resheathes his Zanpakutō for the third time while Ichigo falls over behind him.

   However, as Byakuya begins to walk away, Ichigo grabs onto his robes, causing his mouth to twitch as he looks down. Byakuya frees himself from Ichigo's grasp and continues walking away, only for Ichigo to reiterate that he is not done yet and begin getting to his feet yet again, prompting an impressed Renji to note that he will never give in. When Ichigo asks him where he is going, a smirking Byakuya declares that he is pitiful and draws his Zanpakutō before holding it out to stab Ichigo, who continues to stare at him defiantly for several seconds.

   Byakuya moves to stab Ichigo, only for Rukia to suddenly run in and kick Ichigo away.

As Ichigo tries to get up again, Rukia rushes over and pins him against a car with her foot, where she stares at him for several seconds before releasing him. Walking over to Byakuya and kneeling before him, Rukia claims to have awakened and begs to be redeemed for her sin.

   When Byakuya asks her if she means this, Rukia pauses for several seconds before affirming this, and after several more seconds of silence, Byakuya resheathes his Zanpakutō and accepts this as he tells Rukia that they will return together. Rukia agrees and picks up Ichigo's Zanpakutō before kneeling in front of him and demanding that he return her powers to her. Telling a barely conscious Ichigo that he can return to the normal life he has always wanted when he does so, Rukia reveals that the process will cause him to forget everything that happened since they first met.

   While she struggles not to cry, Rukia claims that she has had enough of Humans and criticizes Ichigo as being grumpy, childish, and totally reckless before placing his hands on the hilt of his Zanpakutō. Holding the blade of Ichigo's Zanpakutō up to her chest, Rukia tearfully bids him farewell before shoving it into her chest, causing a bright light to shine around them both. As the light fades, Rukia stands before Ichigo in her Shinigami robes and sheathes her Zanpakutō before walking away with Byakuya and Renji. With tears in his eyes, Ichigo notes that he was protected once again before passing out.

   The next morning, a healed Ichigo wakes up in his bed and slowly sits up before walking downstairs, where Karin and Yuzu sit at the dining table while greeting him and noting that he slept in late. When Ichigo explains that he had a very long dream that he cannot remember, his sisters look at each other and begin laughing, which prompts Ichigo to smile as Isshin appears behind him and claps him on the shoulder. Commenting on Ichigo finally joining them, Isshin begins setting down food while telling his son to live well, eat well, and age well until his hair falls out.
  </p>
  <p key="885b4253-9f66-4ef3-9ccc-54b1f92af033">
   As he tosses around an apple, Isshin tells Ichigo to die smiling and make his life worth living before clapping him on the shoulder again and walking away, leading Ichigo to look at the shrine of Masaki on the wall. Later that day, at Karakura High School, Keigo asks Orihime and Tatsuki if they saw what the tornado did to the train station before claiming that Ichigo was present, prompting a concerned Orihime to ask him if Ichigo is alright. When Keigo sits down and prepares to lie about him being killed instantly, Ichigo immediately tells him to not even start as he stands nearby.

  <p key="3f429203-8f79-4819-a396-2bbd355c7ec4">
   While Keigo asserts that he knew Ichigo would be okay, Orihime greets him as Tatsuki observes that he looks somewhat different, which Keigo believes is Ichigo having grown taller. Ichigo dismisses this and begins to walk to his desk, only to stop when Uryū passes and greets him. Telling Uryū to stop, Ichigo asks him if they have ever spoken before, leading Uryū to state that he does not believe so before smiling and telling Ichigo that it is good to know him, which Ichigo affirms as Uryū walks away. While the rest of the students enter the classroom, Ichigo sits down at his desk.
  </p>
  <p key="004a7775-90fe-4599-a584-5d3a829cc80b">
   Looking at Orihime, who smiles at him, Ichigo turns to face the desk where Rukia used to sit as his teacher tells the class to turn to page 196 in their textbooks. Upon doing so, Ichigo sees Rukia's warning to not make a scene from when she first appeared as a student, causing him to express confusion before he smiles knowingly.

    Rukia and Byakuya make multiple references to a Shinigami code, which includes the tenets of not transferring one's power to a Human, protecting all innocent lives equally, and not living with a Human in the Human World; in the manga and anime, the first is a law set by
    Central 46
    , the second is a conviction asserted by Rukia while convincing Ichigo to take up her Shinigami duties in her stead, and the third is never stated or implied.

    Renji reveals that both he and Rukia were adopted by the

    , whereas in the manga and anime only Rukia experienced this due to her relationship to

   <li key="00ef4805-6e79-4459-8867-115dab23106e">
    There is a mix of bargains and demands between Byakuya and Rukia/Ichigo. Byakuya commands Rukia to retrieve her powers from Ichigo or be executed, and gives her until the next full moon for her to accomplish this. Ichigo interrupts their next meeting and demands that in exchange for defeating
    Grand Fisher
    , Soul Society absolves Rukia from her crimes, which Byakuya agrees to do, though he later reneges on this deal. In the manga and anime, there is no negotiation and Grand Fisher is defeated before Renji and Byakuya arrive.

    Ichigo trains hard and hones his skills in order to refine his power so he can defeat Grand Fisher and return Rukia's Shinigami powers to her, whereas in the manga and anime he does not take his training seriously and only intends to protect those close to him, instead learning to fight through his multiple battles.
   </li>
   <li key="ee6526df-0ce2-45d8-b478-4cfb8605522a">
    Byakuya and Renji scheme to have Ichigo lure out Grand Fisher and die so Renji can purify it and kill Rukia for growing too close to Ichigo; in the manga and anime, Grand Fisher being purified is not a focal point for the Shinigami, and Byakuya is firmly intent on taking Rukia back to be formally executed by the
    Gotei 13
    for her crime.
