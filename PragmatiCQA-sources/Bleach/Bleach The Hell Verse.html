When Ichigo does not answer them, one of the teenagers moves to attack him, but Ichigo nonchalantly kicks him in the face and forces him to the ground, shocking the other two teenagers, who call him crazy. Ichigo demands to know what happened to a nearby basket of flowers that had been knocked over and asks the teenagers if they know why the flowers were put there. When one of them guesses that they are for a boy who died last week, Ichigo confirms this while kicking him in the face.

   Ichigo asks them to tell him why the flowers are knocked over, prompting the last teenager to admit he and his friends thought it would be fun to knock it over. Agreeing with this, Ichigo declares that they owe the boy an apology and indicates an area next to him, only for the teenagers to react with confusion at him pointing at empty space. When Ichigo angrily demands that they apologize, the terrified teenagers swear to never do it again and beg Ichigo to not hurt them before running away in terror when Ichigo stomps his foot.

   When Ichigo states that it was not nice of the teenagers to knock over the flowers that the boy's mom and dad set out for him, the boy is surprised to learn that Ichigo saw his parents, prompting Ichigo to say that it is clear how much they love and miss him before noting that this must be why the boy has not yet moved on, which the boy confirms. Ichigo tells the boy that he cannot stay in the

   The following morning, when Ichigo enters the living room of the
   Kurosaki Clinic
   , his father
   Isshin Kurosaki
   attempts to greet him with a spinning kick, but an annoyed Ichigo merely slams him into the wall with his bag. Isshin compliments his son's strength, but criticizes his choice to repel him instead of pinning him to the floor and immobilizing him before attacking him once more, only for Ichigo to stop him with a foot to the face while demanding that Isshin stop bugging him. As Ichigo sits down to eat with his sisters,

   When a confused Ichigo asks if Isshin is going somewhere,
   Karin Kurosaki
   reveals he is attending a medical conference and will not be back until tomorrow. Promising to bring back souvenirs for his daughters, Isshin tells Ichigo to look after them before tearfully proclaiming he will be home very soon to the memorial poster of
   Masaki Kurosaki
   , prompting an exasperated Ichigo to ask him to stop talking to it. As Isshin leaves, Yuzu asks Ichigo what he would like for dinner since Isshin will not be there to decide, only for Ichigo to say anything is fine. However, Karin emphasizes that he has the chance to pick anything, so Ichigo requests curry.

  <p key="971232fe-8959-4ae4-a0bc-c8f23f9b0865">
   Yuzu is disappointed by this since they eat curry every other night, but Karin decides that she also wants it, leading a flustered Yuzu to claim that she could make something fancier. As Karin says that Yuzu's curry is really good and is now on her mind so she has to have it, Ichigo looks at both of them before smiling. Later, Ichigo approaches the memorial site of the dead boy and wonders if he moved on before replacing the flowers in the basket. Suddenly,

   Upon learning that they only just arrived, Ichigo asks why they did not tell him in advance, prompting Rukia to apologize and note it was an urgent matter before asking what brings Ichigo here in the middle of the day. As Ichigo details how he brought flowers for a dead boy who may have moved on, Renji berates him for losing track of a Plus despite his job being to help them move on in Karakura Town and demands to know if he is losing focus, much to Rukia's exasperation. When Renji claims that it will be Ichigo's fault if the boy becomes a

   As Ichigo and Renji butt heads, an equally irritated Rukia shoves them apart and calls them both morons before asking if every meeting between them has to be so aggressive. Upon being reminded that they did not come to Karakura Town to play games, Renji acknowledges this and says the mission comes first, prompting Ichigo to ask what this mission is. Rukia tells him to not worry because it is nothing they need his help with, but Ichigo wonders why he is not involved if it has to do with the Human World, prompting Rukia to admit her brother
   Byakuya Kuchiki
   told her to keep Ichigo out of it so he does not get ahead of himself, which annoys Ichigo.

   Reminding Ichigo that Byakuya knows what he is doing, Renji promises to help the dead boy cross over if they find him. As Rukia tells Ichigo to concentrate on his studies, she and Renji walk away, prompting an irritated Ichigo to claim that is all he is good for. Shortly afterward, Ichigo arrives at

   Minutes later, inside one of the classrooms,

When a distracted Ichigo asks Keigo if he said something, Mizuiro teasingly states that he probably did not miss anything important, prompting a shocked Keigo to begin arguing with him about what conversations can be deemed important. During this,

   Later that day, Ichigo and his friends stand in front of the debris, with Sado noting he does not sense any unusual
   Reiatsu
   . Affirming this, Ichigo notes that the way the scaffolding collapsed was still odd, and when Orihime wonders if it could have been an accident, Uryū expresses doubt as he can sense something minuscule that he has never felt before. When Sado asks what he means, Uryū details that it is not a Soul, Hollow,

   Elsewhere, as they stand on a roof, Rukia and Renji sense the Reiatsu coming from Karakura High School. As Renji moves to confront it while noting it cannot be an accident, Rukia stops him and asks if he can sense the other strange presence in the town. When Renji confirms this, Rukia tells him to go on ahead to the school while she investigates the other presence. Renji agrees with this, but tells her to be careful as this could be dangerous, and Rukia returns the sentiment before the two move away with

Suddenly, the group feels the same intense Reiatsu once more, and as part of the ceiling caves in, Ichigo unsheathes

Kokutō clarifies that they are Togabito who have been in Hell for a long time and have thus lost will to fight.

When Ichigo asks where they are, Kokutō states that all they need to do is pass through this level to reach the area Shuren is using as a hideout. As Ichigo expresses his hope that Kokutō is right about Yuzu being there, Kokutō notes that this is the best time for them to strike since most of the Togabito are fighting their friends elsewhere, which can only be good for them. Suddenly, a Kushanāda bursts out of one of the pools of acid below and reaches for Ichigo.

Ichigo states that he has gotten used to it, but is startled when Kokutō begins grunting and groaning in pain from his injuries. When Ichigo tries to help, Kokutō bluntly tells him that he cannot do anything and that this sort of pain is experienced all the time in Hell before asserting that Ichigo needs to focus all his energy on rescuing his sister.

Kokutō affirms this and reveals he had a younger sister whom he loved before claiming that he was responsible for her death because he was worthless and powerless. Stating that nothing mattered after she died because she was everything to him, Kokutō asks Ichigo to promise that he will save Yuzu because she cannot be forced to go through the same terror his sister endured.

When confronted by Taikon, Kokutō slashes at him, only for Taikon to intercept and trap the blade of his sword with a mouth on his chest while wondering why a Togabito like Kokutō would be friendly with a Human. Suddenly, a shadow appears above them as Garogai crashes into Kokutō.

   Calling out to Kokutō once more, Ichigo quickly moves to a different finger pillar as Shuren attacks him with a javelin of flame. As he declares that he will keep Ichigo company, Shuren destroys the pillar he is standing on and lands on another, prompting Ichigo to leap to that one and clash with him. After knocking Ichigo into the stone walkway nearby, Shuren forms a fire bolt and begins launching them at Ichigo, who runs along the walkway to avoid them. Flying next to Ichigo, Shuren asks if he is ready to give into his demands, only for Ichigo to deny this as he attacks Shuren.

When Gunjō sends another tentacles at him, Kokutō cuts through it before slamming into the finger pillar Gunjō is standing on and falling down with a groan. Upon seeing Gunjō sending several more tentacles hurtling toward him, Kokutō stabs his sword into the ground and uses it to push himself away, narrowly avoiding being impaled by the tentacles as they stab into the ground, before slashing through a blast of violet energy fired at him by Taikon.

   A few dozen yards away, Ichigo dodges more flame blasts from Shuren before leaping up to a nearby finger pillar. When Shuren throws a flame javelin at him, Ichigo slashes through it before intercepting an attack from the side by Shuren with a flame lance. After Ichigo's strike dissipates his lance, Shuren forms another and clashes with Ichigo before performing a strong overhanded strike, which Ichigo blocks, only to be sent crashing into the finger pillar behind him by the lance's subsequent explosion. Shuren fires dozens of fire arrows into the resulting dust cloud, only to smile when Ichigo emerges unscathed.

As Ichigo falls to the ground, Kokutō is grabbed by one of Gunjō's tentacles, and though he cuts through a few of them, he is quickly impaled by several more, to Ichigo's shock. Landing near Gunjō, Taikon tells Kokutō to give up because there is no way he can win now.

As Taikon laughs, Kokutō pulls on an invisible chain attached to the hilt of his sword, causing a surprised Taikon to be pulled along with it into the lava behind Kokutō as he screams in fear. While Gunjō reacts with confusion to Taikon's death, Kokutō tells him to say goodbye and jumps into the lava, which pulls Gunjō by his tentacles into the pit as well, causing Ichigo to scream his name.

   On the Lowermost Level, Kokutō sits on a rock as he notices lightning crackling above him. As he stands up, Kokutō sees Ichigo plunge through the smoke above and grins while noting that Ichigo has come back to him. Diving toward the tower Kokutō is standing on, Ichigo lands beside the skull-shaped rock as Kokutō admits he was considering going to the Human World to get him before stating this is much better. When Kokutō asks if he has come to avenge Yuzu, Ichigo reveals that she will be fine, which surprises Kokutō before he asks why Ichigo actually came back.
  </p>
  <p key="2c7b38d9-6f7f-4bf7-9ba4-b93c675493ae">
   Ichigo declares that he came back to rescue his friends, but Kokutō scoffs at this and mocks Ichigo for still not understanding Hell before claiming that the chains of Hell have trapped Ichigo's friends here forever. When Kokutō indicates the branches of the nearby tree, Ichigo sees Renji and Uryū hanging from them as decrepit corpses and calls out to them as Kokutō explains that they are still in the process of rotting, but should be ready very soon. Kokutō goes on to note that Rukia is just about ripe as a plume of smoke and fire rises from the lava near him, to Ichigo's surprise.
  </p>
  <p key="4d94d592-f169-47b7-9aa2-f4757c8635b8">
   As the lava bubbles, a naked Rukia bursts out of it and falls to her hands and knees as a white

   manifests itself on her body. Seeing Ichigo, Rukia asks why he came back, only to be interrupted when Kokutō yanks her to her feet by her Chain of Fate and reminds Ichigo that those in Hell will revive indefinitely but be unable to leave as long as their chains remain intact. When Ichigo declares that he will simply have to find a way to break those chains, Kokutō mockingly praises him as gallant and asks if he will break Kokutō's chains as well, which Ichigo denies.
  </p>
  <p key="76fd24d1-8b1c-4800-852e-b84adfa6d3d3">
   As the wind swirls around him, Ichigo declares that he will instead destroy Kokutō and stores a

   in his blade before disappearing. Throwing Rukia aside as Ichigo reappears in front of him, Kokutō effortlessly blocks his subsequent attack and forces him back before pursuing him to the tree branches. Ichigo and Kokutō begin clashing repeatedly, with Ichigo dodging Kokutō's slashes as he moves between branches before attacking Kokutō with another

  </p>
  <p key="f31e33e7-3525-4d3f-b40c-29a9dafd1ff3">
   Grabbing Ichigo by the throat in midair, Kokutō calls him a fool for thinking he can win without his Hollow mask and throws him into the skull below. After bouncing off the skull onto the ground below, Ichigo blocks several subsequent attacks from Kokutō, who declares that Ichigo cannot defeat him until he Hollowfies no matter how strong his feelings are before sending him flying back with a powerful slash. As he flies over the edge and falls toward the lava below, Ichigo infuses his blade with a large amount of Reiatsu before firing a powerful

   away from him and diverting it toward the top of the tree, where it makes a sizable explosion on impact. While debris rains down, Rukia gets up and crawls to the edge of the skull. As he lands on the ground before Kokutō, Ichigo suddenly has his Hollow mask begin to form over his right eye, forcing him to dispel it with considerable effort as Rukia expresses concern. Asking Ichigo what the matter is, Kokutō reappears beside him and asks what Ichigo is afraid of.
  </p>
  <p key="86b3e000-c484-4455-8e3b-25fdf2dcb084">
   As Ichigo slashes at him, Kokutō appears behind him and puts his hand on Ichigo's shoulder while wondering if he is afraid of destroying everything should he lose control again. Kokutō proclaims that Ichigo should not have come back here if this is the case and pulls Ichigo around before sending him flying with a kick. Catching up to Ichigo, Kokutō locks blades with him and reminds Ichigo that Yuzu was only saved because he turned into a monster before declaring that Ichigo cannot even save himself without that power as he hits Ichigo with a beam of blue energy, which send him crashing into the skull.
  </p>
  <p key="26a375ff-e69a-4ecd-ba52-9e3f10ca79b4">
   The impact of Ichigo hitting the skull sends a wave of lava washing over the top as Rukia trembles. Below, as Ichigo lies in the rubble created by his impact, Kokutō walks up and stomps on his shoulder while claiming that the only thing that keeps people strong in the face of all obstacles is hatred. Stepping on Ichigo's face, Kokutō states that his desire for revenge is the only thing that gave him purpose before stepping back upon seeing a trickle of lava approaching Ichigo. As Kokutō asks Ichigo what is wrong, the lava washes over his left wrist, causing Ichigo to scream in agony.
  </p>
  <p key="eaead7af-82c8-4aee-9055-570226a4010e">
   While Kokutō laughs maniacally, more lava bursts out of the rocks in front of him in a fiery explosion, sending Ichigo hurtling away. Landing before Ichigo with his right arm on fire, Kokutō tells him to hate him more because it is the only thing that will save his life. With the fire having burned away his sleeve to reveal his arm is also scarred and burned, Kokutō begins attacking Ichigo once more, and when Ichigo tries to roll away, Kokutō wraps one of his chains around his leg and smashes him into a nearby stalagmite before slamming him into the ground further away.
  </p>
  <p key="1fe40ab8-baac-48f6-a7e1-6f0fe4dcb9f8">
   Leaping toward Ichigo with a manic expression, Kokutō stabs him in the abdomen and stomps him back down to the ground before asking why Ichigo still cannot summon his Hollow power. When Kokutō asks if he needs to kidnap Karin and Yuzu again, Ichigo looks at him in fury and exerts his Reiatsu with tremendous force, causing a surprised Kokutō to leap back as Ichigo's Reiatsu flares up around him. Ichigo stands up and glares at Kokutō with Hollowfied eyes, only to be taken aback when a gray substance bursts from his mouth and abdomen. As it begins to wrap around him, Ichigo tries to fight back the substance.
  </p>
  <p key="31f40b6e-e471-4379-8add-92ccb0ed4143">
   Noting that Ichigo should Hollowfy easier this time since he has already lost control before, Kokutō claims that Ichigo can never suppress his Hollow power and proclaims that it is hopeless no matter how much he struggles. As the substance begins wrapping around Ichigo's face to form sharp teeth and a mask, Rukia screams out his name, prompting Kokutō to move behind her and grab Rukia by her Chain of Fate while ordering her to be silent so Ichigo's transformation is not disturbed. Suddenly, a horn sounds in the distance, leading Kokutō to inform Ichigo that the Kushanāda are emerging.
  </p>
  <p key="05b4ef7e-377c-4c8a-8143-1e8ac7b127f2">
   Kokutō reveals that they are doing so because of the change in Ichigo's Reiatsu as the Kushanāda begin to walk out of the nearby towers of lava by the dozens and head toward Ichigo. Laughing, Kokutō declares that Ichigo will have to Hollowfy in order to survive, but notes that even if he does not, he will come back to life anyway. As Zangetsu fully takes over Ichigo's body, Kokutō asks if he is ready to crush Hell and points out that the cycle will continue endless if he does not. While Kokutō moves to the top of the tree with Rukia, the Kushanāda arrive at the tower to devour Ichigo.
  </p>
  <p key="a040175c-4e1e-4df1-b914-462e2cb6d777">
   As Kokutō notes the Kushanāda are almost here, Ichigo declares it is not going to happen, shocking Kokutō. Proclaiming that he will not let it happen, Ichigo breaks off his left horn and tells Kokutō that taking revenge on everyone because his feelings were hurt is a waste of energy. With his Hollowfied form breaking off of his body in pieces, Ichigo states that blaming one's pain on others and refusing to take responsibility for one's actions is childish as he steadies himself on his blade before asking Kokutō how long he believes he can run from his pain before it consumes him.
  </p>
  <p key="61c38c07-0044-43ba-be13-a84f3fd52201">
   While the Kushanāda continue to advance and climb up the tower, Ichigo reminds Kokutō that he came back to Hell to save his friends before refusing to sacrifice those around him in order to do so. When a Kushanāda rises up behind Ichigo, Rukia frantically tells him to run away now, but Ichigo stands his ground and declares that he will fight for his friends with this solemn vow and his soul as the last fragments of his Hollowfied form disappear. Looming over Ichigo, the Kushanāda slams its hand down on top of him as Rukia screams out his name and Kokutō smiles.
  </p>
  <p key="4a6a2182-1a5a-4120-99a0-862c457c8f34">
   Suddenly, a golden light shines from underneath the Kushanāda's hand, causing the Kushanāda to begin unraveling into golden threads of light that coalesce around Ichigo. Laughing maniacally, Kokutō assumes that Ichigo lost control after all and tells him to destroy the Kushanāda, but is shocked upon seeing Ichigo is being covered with a golden substance by the Kushanāda. As the rest of the light coalesces around Ichigo, a surge of golden Reiatsu erupts from him, freeing Rukia from Kokutō's grasp and sending her flying away as the remaining Kushanāda kneel.
  </p>
  <p key="3f624c37-0f00-40c8-b335-e98b2abb3023">
   The Reiatsu vanishes and kicks up a huge dust cloud, which Ichigo leaps out of before cutting through the chains holding up Renji and Uryū as he catches Rukia and lands on the ground below. As the dust settles, Rukia sees her Chain of Fate has been cleanly severed and clutches at its former location on her chest before looking up to see Ichigo has been clad in golden, skull-patterned armor. When a confused Kokutō asks what this form is and what Ichigo has done while landing before him, Ichigo responds by asking Kokutō if his sister really wanted him to get revenge for her death.
  </p>
  <p key="75b0a023-c8fa-4b52-a06b-68d81c9f7725">
   As Kokutō expresses confusion at this, Ichigo asks if Kokutō's sister wanted him to build up a body count and continue this endless bloodshed before declaring that he cannot end hatred with hatred and has only dragged his sister into a never-ending cycle of suffering. Leveling his blade at Kokutō, Ichigo reveals that he was empowered by Hell not to exact revenge, but to stop Kokutō, and proclaims that Hell is willing to ask him for help just to prevent Kokutō from escaping. While Ichigo glows with golden Reiatsu, a stunned Kokutō asks if he means Hell is really cooperating with a Human.
  </p>
  <p key="abfd9d08-9e53-4b5d-a29a-dbc5be62b8cf">
   Kokutō angrily declares that this is impossible and claims he and Ichigo are the same before leaping toward him while screaming. Confirming this, Ichigo states he is just another Human like Kokutō before slashing at him, which unleashes surge of golden energy that breaks Kokutō's last chain and cuts him deeply across the chest before sending him flying back. The golden energy cuts a deep trench into the tower and flies out of it in a crescent shape before dissipating, and as the dust clears, a badly wounded Kokutō gets to his feet and begins to walk as he bleeds.
  </p>
  <p key="b3e5cfa9-f5f7-4ddf-892f-a24fbba3daf5">
   When the manacle on his left wrist falls off, a stunned Kokutō clutches his arm and feels his chest as he realizes all of his chains are gone. Loudly declaring his freedom, Kokutō laughs, only to stop as the ground begins to rumble. Suddenly, thousands of chains burst out of the trench in the ground and begin snaking toward Kokutō, who is bound and impaled by them while screaming in terror. As Ichigo declares that this is Kokutō's punishment for the sins he committed while trying to escape and that he will spend eternity repenting, the chains glow before pulling a screaming Kokutō even deeper into Hell.
  </p>
  <p key="f6f4a044-8e99-4d3c-9089-4aa8ab4cfd35">
   As the rest of the tower is destroyed by the chains, Ichigo takes Rukia to safety at the top of the skull and sets her down as he sees the Kushanāda bowing before him while daylight breaks through the clouds above. Noticing her black

   are back, Rukia looks up at Ichigo, who realizes that he won and it is over, causing him to cheer loudly. Rukia stands up and congratulates Ichigo before pointing out that they still need to find Renji and Uryū, prompting Ichigo to note that he broke their chains and released them when he was granted this power before wondering where they are.
  </p>
  <p key="d9d5f2c2-0f42-46af-9bf2-731f15d9198c">
   Calling out to Ichigo and Rukia, Renji emerges from the rubble below as Uryū does the same and states that his entire body is sore, which Uryū affirms while noting that he feels rigid. When Rukia tells them that they should not expect anything else after having been rotting, a confused Renji asks her what she is talking about, leaving Rukia confused on where to start. As Uryū observes that it seems to be over, Renji asks about what happened to Kokutō, prompting Ichigo to reveal he was dragged down to the depths of Hell and is gone, which Renji admits means that Ichigo did win.
  </p>
  <p key="ce1e3c7c-68f3-4d5a-93a1-1f9b7cdf5109">
   However, Renji and Uryū are shocked upon seeing Ichigo's appearance, and Renji asks what is up with his outfit, only for Ichigo to admit he is not sure himself and state that it came from the Kushanāda helping him before asking if it looks weird, which Renji confirms. As Uryū teases Ichigo for always being on the cutting edge of fashion, Renji asks if it is permanent or if he can change back, prompting Ichigo to dispel the armor as a pondering Rukia tries to tell him that removing the armor might make the Kushanāda attack them again. Suddenly, the Kushanāda begin to loom over them.
  </p>
  <p key="aa5dd6fb-2be4-49a9-91eb-b6a0888b0a23">
   As Renji notes this is not good, a Kushanāda slams its hand down on top of them, prompting the group to begin running away as it crushes the ground behind them. Dodging more Kushanāda hands, Ichigo and his friends jump on top of another Kushanāda that tries to crush them and use it as a ramp to go up through Hell and reach the surface.

At the last minute, Ichigo and his friends leap out of the Gates into the air as Orihime runs onto the ground below. When Ichigo and his friends begin falling, a shocked Orihime catches them with

   Later, Yuzu wakes up in bed and yawns, prompting Karin to bolt awake in surprise. As Yuzu greets her, Karin frantically checks her body for the Chain of Fate she had, much to Yuzu's confusion, before hugging her and proclaiming how glad she is that Yuzu is alright, causing Yuzu to wonder why she would not be. Meanwhile, Isshin walks in the door downstairs and announces his return before tearfully asking why no one is greeting him despite having brought gifts.
