   brought by Yūshirō, the pedestal constructed by Mayuri, and the massive amount of spiritual power resulting from having all the captains and lieutenants together in one place.
   Soon afterward,
   Jūshirō Ukitake
   completes his treatment of the wounded Shinigami and emerges from the treatment room with them.
  </p>
  <p key="30af5b8d-40ac-4fe4-9283-d4abbe4a4d50">
   An incredulous Shinji points out that Ukitake should be one of the people being healed, but Ukitake states that he was feeling well enough to apply his great knowledge of healing techniques. When Ukitake claims that everyone except Kenpachi has been healed to the point where they can move about, Kenpachi emerges from the treatment room and demands to know whom Ukitake is claiming cannot move before asking Urahara where
   Yachiru Kusajishi
   is. When told that the rest of the
   11th Division
   is out looking for her, Kenpachi attempts to leave, but Urahara blocks his path with a

  </p>
  <p key="9545e651-c3fe-4216-bb82-3649a8e0ca98">
   When Kenpachi tells her to move, Nanao firmly tells him that there is no time for the Shinigami to fight among themselves and states that it is far more efficient to have a full squad of Shinigami search for Yachiru than for Kenpachi himself to do so before claiming that no amount of regular Shinigami can do what they need Kenpachi here for. Upon being told that his duty should take priority here, Kenpachi stares at Nanao for a moment before admitting she is correct and backing off, to the relief of Nanao and Urahara, who decides to get begin the procedure before Kenpachi changes his mind again. Urahara begins handing out orbs to the Shinigami present while instructing them to stand on the pedestal and fill the orbs with their
   Reiatsu
   . Opening the ceiling hatch, Urahara notes it is going to get somewhat wet within the laboratory.
   However, the Shinigami present are shocked when
   Hiyori Sarugaki
   ,
   Love Aikawa
   ,
   Lisa Yadōmaru
   , and
   Hachigen Ushōda
   arrive, with Hiyori carrying a large, teapot-shaped container and asking the Shinigami if they are ready for this.
  </p>
  <p key="f5021c49-3337-49e6-80ff-9d7d96d0e089">
   A shocked Shinji asks Hiyori why she is here, prompting Hiyori to proclaim Shinji gave them all the hard work after becoming Urahara's servant, which Shinji claims he does not understand. After telling Shinji that she will be ignoring him from now on, Hiyori begins pouring a clear substance out of the container into the pedestal as Rukia notes it does not feel wet despite resembling a liquid. Urahara clarifies that it is a substance created in the distortions present between the realms that they will use to facilitate their travel to the palace. Stating that they will be fusing it with the Reiatsu of the captains, Urahara tells the Visored to change into the

  </p>
  <p key="a2e09408-18c4-4f9d-9b0a-bb3aa4e5a807">
   When Kenpachi asks him if they are going to fly to the palace once their orbs are charged, Urahara reveals they will be creating a doorway to the palace instead and notes this method can only be used because of how Ichigo destroyed the barriers between the Royal Realm and Soul Society. Urahara notes there may be no way back and apologizes for revealing this so late, but Suì-Fēng berates him for thinking they might hesitate upon learning this and claims he should know better than to doubt them as a former member of the Gotei 13. As Ukitake states they all carry the same pride as members of the Gotei 13, Kenpachi admits he does not care about these things as long as he can fight the Wandenreich. Smiling, Urahara states they are right before noting it is time they began.

   Ichigo tells Yhwach they have come here to stop him, prompting Yhwach to note that he has seen them trying to prevent him from killing the Soul King. When Ichigo questions what he means, Yhwach explains that he saw how Ichigo and his friends revived Ichibē and were told to come here by him before revealing they are too late to save the Soul King. Shocked by this, Ichigo leaps forward and grabs the sword embedded in the Soul King's chest.

   The bottom half of the Soul King falls to the ground as Ichigo falls to his knees. As Yhwach tells him once more that he was destined to kill the Soul King himself upon coming here, Ichigo wonders why the sword he is holding will not let go of his hand, prompting Yhwach to explain how

Meanwhile, in the Seireitei below, Urahara watches as the ceiling of his laboratory begins to crumble, causing the other Shinigami to wonder if it is an enemy attack. However, Urahara realizes that the Soul King has died and theorizes that the Royal Guard fell and Ichigo arrived too late. As Urahara notes Soul Society,

Noting that his parents were very superstitious, Ukitake reveals that they carried him to Mimihagi's shrine and offered his lungs as a sacrifice when the local doctors were unable to help him, which saved his life and allowed him to join the Gotei 13. When Ukitake coughs up blood, Rukia calls out to him, but Ukitake tells her to stay back because his internal organs are being offered to Mimihagi through the process of

In the Soul King Palace, those present express shock upon seeing the shadowy Mimihagi grabbing the two halves of the Soul King. Noting that Mimihagi must be part of the Soul King if it managed to escape his eyes, Yhwach angrily demands to know if Mimihagi developed some sort of affection for Soul Society after protecting it for so long as Mimihagi's eye begins to close. In the laboratory, Suì-Fēng asks Urahara how long Ukitake will survive and points out how this balance will only last so long as Ukitake remains alive, only for Urahara to admit he has no way of estimating how long this will last.

However, Shunsui states that he simply believes their interests will coincide on this particular matter, leading Aizen to ask him if he is going to breathe the fresh air of a Soul Society being crushed by Yhwach. Meanwhile, in the palace, Yhwach attempts to grab Mimihagi, but is stopped by a dark barrier. Noting that he did not expect Mimihagi to stand in his way, Yhwach wonders if it is no longer aligned with the will of the Soul King before deciding to destroy both of them, only for Ichigo to grab his arm to prevent him from doing so.

   , Yoruichi reveals that the Valleys of Screams somehow continue to exist despite the instability of the Reiatsu present in the Garganta. Yoruichi states that Urahara sought out Riruka and Yukio to exploit this; by using their individual powers, he put a small Valley of Screams into a box and modified it into a room and rails, which will allow them to sneak into the palace without exerting any Reiatsu. Meanwhile, in the palace, the

   As the modified Valley of Screams begins moving toward the palace, Yoruichi reveals to the others that she placed a stake near the Soul King when she saw the barrier set up around him collapsing, so they should be able to sneak in undetected if no one has noticed it yet. When Sado asks her what powers Pernida has because he and the others were too far away to see it clearly, Yoruichi admits that she only knows her arm was broken before cautioning them to keep their distance from it. Orihime notes they should have asked Ichibei about the powers he witnessed when they had the chance, but Riruka scolds her for being depressed about things that have already happened. When Ichigo asks Grimmjow why he is helping them, Grimmjow claims he will not be able to kill Ichigo if Yhwach destroys all the realms.

   that Yhwach has finished absorbing the Soul King before claiming that a new world awaits them. As the Quincy approach Yhwach, who is oozing darkness, an unnerved Askin notices the darkness covering the floor and wonders what it is, only to be shocked alongside Uryū, Lille, and Gerard when Yhwach turns around to reveal he has gained a mask of eyes. Askin tries to back away, but is stopped by Haschwalth, who tells him to calm down. Asking the Quincy if they are afraid of him, Yhwach states they will soon become accustomed to it before noting he never expected to have too much power as the top of the palace shatters.

However, Haschwalth kneels before Yhwach and praises his power before noting that the world can no longer exist without him. When Haschwalth asks him to lead them, Yhwach addresses him as his first son and states he will begin with remaking their nation as the buildings in the Wandenreich city that replaced the Seireitei begin to crumble.
