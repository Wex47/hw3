   As the 28th Head of the Kuchiki Clan, Byakuya acts in an aristocratic manner. He always seems serene and apathetic towards other people, even while actually deeply conflicted. He is notably calm, even in battle. He generally acts indifferent, bordering on arrogance, to most situations he is faced with, and rarely views his opponent as being worth his time. Byakuya is easily offended if his name is not used properly. As such, he views

   with disdain for always referring to him improperly. When Byakuya talks with Ichigo, he calls him by his full name. Byakuya is very perceptive, fully aware of the limits of his abilities, and anything he states in comparison to an opponent is usually justified. Despite consistently stating himself to be far stronger than opponents like

   , Byakuya retains a formal tone, always using "watashi" which is a formal way of referring to oneself. When he was younger, he was quick to anger and very hot-headed, as noted by his grandfather.
  </p>
  <p key="274076f2-8f7d-47f3-b171-5ce84acd637c">
   Byakuya strongly believes in law and order. As a captain of the Gotei 13 and head of one of the great noble families, he works hard for a peaceful society. He feels that if someone in his position does not follow the rules as a good example, no one else will. He believes that to maintain the order, all law-breakers must be punished, even if it goes against his own wishes. Byakuya feels that "part of a captain's responsibilities is to make sure that the lieutenant's responsibilities are taken care of".

  <p key="ba54741e-23aa-4ebc-9689-ae6ebcf614e3">
   During the years between Rukia's adoption and her death sentence, Byakuya's pride and calm demeanor made her believe he never cared about her because he had never once looked at her. In spite of his icy and regal manner, Byakuya cares for and protects those important to him. This holds especially true to Rukia as he loved Hisana dearly and unconditionally, having promised Hisana he would protect Rukia no matter what. After the events of the Aizen incident, he admits law isn't perfect, and becomes more lenient towards Rukia. Although, he tries to maintain a balance between following orders and breaking the law by exploiting loopholes in his orders. In addition, he also provided Rukia and Renji with safety cloaks to protect them against Hueco Mundo's rough terrain.
  </p>
  <p key="3cb38bf1-3001-4465-9913-d99dd5f2d0d8">
   Because of his promise to Hisana, Byakuya smothered Rukia despite his pride by making sure she would never become a seated officer because of the risks that involve missions for such positions.
   He also comes to learn about his mistakes of keeping his feelings to himself and becomes more open about how much he cares for Rukia and others that are close to him such as Renji.

   Byakuya is popular among the female Shinigami of Soul Society, and was voted number one in the "captain we desire to release a photo book for" poll taken by the Shinigami Women's Association. He likes Japanese cherry blossoms, night-time walks, spicy food, and bananas, but does not like sweets. Byakuya excels in

   . Upon seeing Yoruichi, he attacked and insulted her. Yoruichi playfully teased him, complaining about his greeting after coming all the way there to see him. Byakuya, expressing his displeasure at seeing her, stated he would be the head of the Kuchiki Clan soon enough, so he had no time to waste on her. Yoruichi, stealing his hair tie, exclaimed that if the head of the Kuchiki Clan could get his hair tie stolen by a girl at play, she is worried about its future. She used Shunpo to escape from him, leaving an angry Byakuya, claiming his superiority, promising to make her see the error of her ways.

   Shortly after Renji defeats Ishida, Byakuya, bearing witness to the arrival of Ichigo, watches as Renji engages him. When Renji is almost hit by Ichigo, Byakuya tells his lieutenant he is being too careless, but Renji simply states Ichigo is nothing to worry about. Byakuya explains he knew Ichigo looked familiar, as 33 hours ago, Special Forces obtained his image after he fought a Menos Grande, giving it a scar.

   Eventually, Ichigo gains the upper hand against Renji. As he prepares for a finishing strike, Byakuya cuts Ichigo's sword in two, and subsequently inflicts a grievous wound on his chest.
   Byakuya asks Renji if something is wrong, who tells him there was no need for him to directly attack Ichigo, as he could have finished him. Byakuya tells him not to be like that, for if he is always the spectator, his skills may degrade. When Rukia runs to Ichigo's body, Byakuya asks her if she would still go to Ichigo's side after all that has just happened, and tells her he understands, as he does resemble

He states Ichigo should die from his injuries in a half hour, and if he does survive, his Shinigami powers will be gone. He has Renji open a

Knowing the only way to stop the Gillians is to seal the Garganta, Byakuya decides to use his spiritual energy, reinforced by Senbonzakura's, to seal the portal. Their allies, upon realizing what they are attempting, join in and add their own Reiatsu, eventually closing the Garganta.
     After finishing off the last of the Gillians, Byakuya and the other Shinigami watch as the dome collapses, revealing Ichigo and a dying Muramasa. After Muramasa dies and apologizes for his mistakes, Byakuya, approaching Ichigo, sincerely thanks him for all he has done.

Byakuya uses his clan's connections and money to greatly speed up the repairs to Seireitei, and allows his Division to celebrate at his mansion.

They immediately enter the office of Captain-Commander Yamamoto, presenting him with the Substitute Shinigami Badge of Ichigo Kurosaki, which they found in the Dangai.

     As the skirmish goes on, Byakuya is forced to fall back. As the Reigai's Shikai pursues him, it proceeds to cut him multiple times, much to his surprise. Later, as Byakuya perches atop a tower, his Reigai counterpart states his wounds are too severe to allow him to fight any longer. Byakuya continues to fight, releasing his Bankai,
     and defeats the Reigai. He rejoins the other captains as they confront Inaba. Byakuya, pulling back as several Reigai appear before them, uses his Bankai to surround the Reigai, which creates an opening for the other Shinigami to attack, as he tells them to follow through.

     Byakuya and the other Shinigami watch as Mayuri fights Inaba. As Inaba releases the Reigai's true power, Byakuya and the other Shinigami prepare to fight them. As the Reigai jump down to attack the captains, Byakuya dodges their initial blows, coming face-to-face with the remade Reigai-Byakuya.
     Eventually, Byakuya and the other captains are forced to retreat.
     They return in time to help Ichigo and Kisuke against the Reigai.
     Determined to settle things once and for all, Byakuya, facing his Reigai counterpart, insists on proving who is the true head of the Kuchiki Clan.

     As the battle continues, the Reigai, increasing in numbers, become much more dangerous, attacking whomever they see. The lieutenants arrive and aid the captains, which allows Byakuya to save Yoruichi from a surprise attack by Reigai-Shunsui, despite becoming injured in the process.
     As the battle progresses, Byakuya realizes the Reigai value self-preservation the most, and will not attack first in fear of being outnumbered. Byakuya deduces these ideals of relying on nobody and never truly trusting even their allies are traits the Reigai acquired from Inaba. While Reigai-Hitsugaya is surprised by the captains fighting together, Byakuya states they will do what they must to protect Soul Society.
     Later, Byakuya watches as the Reigai help stop

   The attack destroys Gerard's head, and Hitsugaya finishes off Gerard by freezing and shattering his torso. Byakuya then catches Hitsugaya as he collapses, noting that the captain pushed his body to its limits in Bankai. Suddenly, Byakuya and Hitsugaya become engulfed in energy rising up to regenerate Gerard.
   As this happened, Renji and Rukia emerge and talk to Hitsugaya. Unable to recognize him, Rukia states that he is Hitsugaya's older brother, which Hitsugaya does not attempt to deny, and Byakuya notes that he is not even trying.

When Rukia begins to protest, Byakuya tells her to not think too highly of herself and proceeds to block another strike from Gerard with his Bankai before claiming that he has no need for either of them here, prompting Rukia and Renji to thank him before leaving. Byakuya appears next to Hitsugaya and claims that he carefully chose his words so Rukia and Renji would see the underlying meaning when Hitsugaya points out that they noticed his concern. Listening as Hitsugaya explains how the Shin'o Academy teaches Shinigami to fight for their friends and humans, Byakuya notes that deciding what is right and wrong is a very Shinigami-like teaching.

   However, the Shinigami receive information of Yhwach's Reiatsu manifesting in the West 55th Block, and Byakuya races there. Suì-Fēng accompanies Byakuya and tells him that Rukia left Soul Society, but Byakuya is fine with Rukia taking a break and says that he will deal with the problem himself. Byakuya and Suì-Fēng then reach Mayuri and see the remnants of Yhwach's Reiatsu and brace for an attack. However just as the Reiatsu grows in strength it randomly vanishes without a trace, shocking the three captains.

    Immense Spiritual Power

   : Byakuya can exert an immense amount of
   Spiritual Pressure
   , which, in addition to his already admirable combat skills and finesse, makes him one of the most formidable captains. His spiritual pressure can be felt from a great distance, and it has the tendency to make people perspire in fear.

    Enhanced Endurance

   : While not having the most imposing appearance compared to other Shinigami, Byakuya is a very resilient fighter. During his fight against Ichigo, despite gaining severe injuries, Byakuya continued fighting effectively, even ignoring his wounds to the point where he seemed unfazed by them. At the end of the fight, he was able to remain standing and performed an impressive Shunpo to leave,
   and later survived being impaled by

   , taking the blow in Rukia's place.
   During his fight with the 7th Espada Zommari Rureaux, Byakuya willingly damaged himself to escape from his enemy's possession attack, and continued to fight as though unaffected, eventually obtaining victory.
   During his fight with Tsukishima, he had his entire left arm mutilated by Senbonzakura, and used that same arm to catch its blades and thrust them at the Fullbringer, ultimately defeating him.
   Byakuya managed to survive a multitude of devastating injuries during his battle with Äs Nödt, including having his stomach ripped out
   and being viciously attacked by his own Bankai.

    ): Byakuya's Bankai is a much larger version of Senbonzakura's Shikai. To activate it, Byakuya drops his sword straight down; the sword does not have to be completely intact for Byakuya to activate his Bankai, as he can simply drop all the pieces at once with both hands.
    The sword phases into the ground, as though it were a pool of water. Energy ripples expand out, turning the surrounding area dark, and within seconds, two rows of a thousand giant blades rise up from the ground. Those thousand swords scatter, and countless flying blades pierce the enemy. No one knows the exact number of blades generated, and no one can dodge or even see the movements of these blades.
    The number of blades is great enough that Byakuya can simultaneously use them for offense and defense. He commonly forms them into large masses to obliterate opponents instantaneously. As they move through the air like torrents of waves, they give the appearance of cherry blossoms flowing swiftly along the wind.
    Senbonzakura Kageyoshi's defensive use allows Byakuya to cover himself entirely in these tiny blades, forming a body shield.
    Unlike his Shikai, his Bankai is mentally controlled. While Byakuya can control the blades with his mind alone, using his hands allows him to do so more effectively, making the blades move twice as fast.
    Similar to his Shikai, its attack is triggered with the phrase

   explained, the trick to avoid Senbonzakura's blades is not to retreat, but to get closer.
   Although Byakuya can compensate this weakness by allowing the blades to enter the Hurtless Area, since it is the range in which he can safely react and redirect missed attacks, by increasing the speed of the blades
