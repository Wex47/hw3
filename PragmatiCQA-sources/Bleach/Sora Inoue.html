   from the day she was born, considering her a daughter more than a sister, and did his best to shield her from their abusive parents, eventually fleeing with Orihime when he turned 18 to care for her on his own.

   As the Hollow Acidwire, Sora retains his love and affection for Orihime, but it has been twisted by the corrupting nature of Hollowfication. He seeks to take Orihime with him so they can live together once more and initially explains his motivation to her instead of taking her by force,
   but he is also willing to harm both Tatsuki and Ichigo to get her back because he believes they are trying to tear him and his sister apart,
   and whenever Orihime resists his attempts at reunion, he grows violently angry with her,
   eventually attempting to devour her soul so no one else can have her.
   However, after Orihime embraces him during his attempted lethal attack and reveals that she was telling him about her happiness in life so he would not be sad, and after Ichigo reveals she has been wearing the hairpins Sora gave to her every day since he died, Acidwire experiences a moment of clarity about his actions and voluntarily purifies himself with Ichigo's

   When Sora was fifteen, his sister Orihime was born. The siblings were raised by a drunken father and a prostitute mother who always argued and beat their children; Sora did his best to shield Orihime from their wrath. Fearing that their parents would kill Orihime, when he turned 18, Sora ran away with Orihime and raised her from then on.
   When Sora was twenty-seven, he and Orihime had an argument over the hairpins he had bought for her. The next morning, Sora left for work, but did not speak to Orihime.
   That day, he was injured in a car accident and he died in the
   Kurosaki Clinic
   .

   Shortly afterward, he goes to Orihime's apartment, where he separates her soul from her body. As he attacks and pins down
   Tatsuki Arisawa
   , Orihime pushes his arm off of her. As Orihime pleads with Tatsuki to get up, Acidwire tells her that Tatsuki cannot hear or see them, prompting Orihime to ask how he knows her name. Angered by Orihime having apparently forgotten his voice, Acidwire tries to attack her, but Ichigo arrives and blocks his attack, prompting Acidwire to ask if Ichigo believes he can stop him.

   When Ichigo wonders why he can see two Orihimes, Acidwire explains that he is looking at her soul and proclaims that she is dead before attacking Ichigo, who is sent flying outside the apartment and into the street below. Turning his attention to Orihime, Acidwire shows her the part of his face left exposed by his damaged Hollow mask, which leads her to recognize him, and claims that Tatsuki and Ichigo were tearing her away from him. Acidwire explains how Orihime praying for him initially helped him rest in peace and how her befriending Tatsuki and Ichigo, whom she started talking to him about instead, made him grow lonely and bloodthirsty. After pinning Ichigo against the wall when he re-enters the apartment, Acidwire asks Orihime to come with him once more, Orihime asks why he hurt her friends instead of telling her and declares that her brother would never do this. Enraged, Acidwire begins crushing Orihime in his grasp while blaming her for his condition and threatening to kill her, only for Ichigo to cut off his arms and most of his tail before lecturing him on what it means to be a big brother, leading Acidwire to demand to know why Ichigo stands in his way.
