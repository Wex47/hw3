   Hiyori is a very short, brown eyed, blonde-haired girl who wears her short hair in spiky pigtails with her bangs clipped together by three clips. She wears a white shirt and a red jogging suit, the latter with white lines running down from the shoulders and decorated with the first

   of her name, as well as yellow flip flops. Hiyori carries her ZanpakutÅ over her back. On each cheek, under each of her eyes, she has three freckles.
   She has an overly long fang protruding from the upper left side of her mouth. This physical characteristic has caused both Ichigo and Shinji to call her "snaggletooth". She appears more haggard and not as sharp as she did during her days in Soul Society, with tired lines under her eyes.

   , whom she frequently abuses, usually by smacking him with one of her sandals or kicking and punching him in the face. She has made it a reflex to use him as a human shield when necessary, and shows him an obvious lack of respect, a gesture which he seems to return. This behavior dates back to her time as a lieutenant, despite Shinji outranking her back then.

   She shows very little respect to the majority of people around her, easily losing her temper and getting into fights. Having viewed her former captain
   Kirio Hikifune
   as a motherly figure, Hiyori was very hurt by her departure, and initially refused to accept Urahara as her replacement, even treating him with her trademark violence and disrespect, despite his attempts to be her friend. When Kirio Hikifune was in charge of her, Hiyori was very respectful to her old captain as a sign of respect and trust, but still smacked everyone else around. Hiyori seems to harbor a hatred of both Shinigami and Humans. As a result of her thorny disposition and possible insecurities, Hiyori never displays much emotion besides anger, and always appears to be frowning.

        Later that day, when Urahara formally introduced himself to the 12th Division and Hiyori, she, flat out telling him she would not accept him as her captain, slapped away Urahara's hand, which shocked him. Stating she already could not stand that Captain Hikifune left without a moment's notice and now they had to deal with a 2nd Division member as their captain, she noted he was from the

        When the other 12th Division members tried to tell her she was going too far, Hiyori stated she was only saying what they were all thinking, though the other 12th Division members refused to side with her opinion. When she confronted Urahara, trying to get a rise out of him, he, laughing it off, told her he has already been made the captain of the 12th Division. He explained he had already decided the role he would play would be their captain, and no longer a member of the 2nd Division. Urahara told Hiyori if she had a problem, it was hers to change. Hiyori, kicking him in his crotch, ran off, only succeeding in injuring her foot.

        While walking around the 12th Division barracks, Hiyori, becoming irate when she found the division moving Urahara's vast amount of personal items, got into another confrontation with him when he tried to be of aid to her. The following day, at a division meeting, Urahara revealed he had decided to change the policy of the 12th Division, but had yet to determine what course of action he thought would be a good role for them. Becoming increasing angry upon hearing he was still thinking about it, Hiyori attacked him. Later, she was walking around the 12th Division barracks when she was confronted by Shinji. They got into a small argument, and Hiyori attacked him for saying something Urahara commonly said which she could not stand. Confronting Urahara, she challenged him to a fight, which he accepted, but asked that they fight hand-to hand. As they prepared to fight, Urahara told her to attack him from any angle. Hiyori, running at him, kicked him square in the face.

        Hiyori ran off, and at the entrance to the division headquarters, she realized Urahara, seeing through her attack, moved out the way and back in place so she would hit him. She became confused as to what drove this action.
        The following morning, she arrived at the captain's chamber. As Hiyori became enraged at how Urahara had changed the room from its former state, he, trying to calm her down, told her in getting to know him, he would get to know her. Undeterred, Hiyori attacked him, but he, brushing it aside, asked her to accompany him to the
        Nest of Maggots

        grounds, where he proceeded to explain to her the purpose of the detention unit and what truly happened to those found under their jurisdiction. He further explained what the Nest of Maggots was and what function it entailed. Upon entering the facility, Urahara, telling her the inmates were not permitted to leave, but they were still free within the facility, warned her to be careful, as the inmates could become violent. When Hiyori asked what they did, Urahara told her "nothing", causing Hiyori to question the methods, but Urahara explained to her the dangers these inmates could bring and why they were imprisoned, making note of the true dealings of what happened to those who withdrew from service in the
        Gotei 13
        . Urahara explained though the people in the facility were possibly dangerous, he had always felt that, given a suitable outlet, they could channel their power into something more productive.

        When one of the inmates tried to attack Hiyori, she realized she could not fight, as she had left her ZanpakutÅ behind. Easily stopping the inmate, Urahara apologized, as he had noticed she had left her ZanpakutÅ behind and had chosen to say nothing. He made note that in the facility, they were not allowed to carry weapons, so hand-to-hand combat mastery was the key.
        When this prompted the other inmates to attack, Urahara, easily defending himself, took out all his attackers, much to Hiyori's surprise. Eventually, one of the inmates, trying to take Hiyori hostage, was quickly overwhelmed by her as she demonstrated her own capabilities in hand-to-hand combat.

        Shinigami Research and Development Institute

The two got into an ongoing argument about who was in charge, prompting Hiyori to call in Urahara. He explained to her that, with the disappearances occurring, he had created a new type of Gigai.

Saying Hiyori took sixty-nine minutes and 2 seconds, Kensei tells her Ichigo is up to sixty-eight minutes and 44 seconds. When Ichigo's Hollow form begins to destabilize, Hiyori yells to Hachi to get Love out of the barrier.
        Later, after gaining control over his body once again, Ichigo trains with Hiyori, the pair using their Hollow masks while fighting.
        When Hachi becomes alerted when he detects someone has slipped inside his barrier, the other Visored are surprised. Orihime, showing up, is revealed to Hachi and the other Visored to be the culprit. They are quite shocked a simple Human could perform such a feat.

        Upon returning to the warehouse, Hiyori spars with Ichigo again.
        As they continue to fight, Hiyori, maintaining the upper hand, brutally beats Ichigo and continues to taunt him. When Kensei announces dinner is ready, they take a break from the training. Shortly after eating, when Shinji asks Hiyori how the training is coming along, she says it is not, as Ichigo is nothing special.

Admitting she is right, Hitsugaya tells her he is sorry; he just panicked. Instead of letting it go, Hiyori starts an argument with Hitsugaya, who remains silent until she, questioning his position as a captain, insinuates he is a kid, which prompts Hitsugaya to yell back at her, causing the two to get into a big fight. Becoming annoyed, Lisa attacks Harribel by herself.

        As Hiyori sets her sight on Aizen, her Hollow mask dissipates. Appearing near her, Shinji tells her and the others it would be best not to be too quick to go near him, explaining that with Aizen's ability, one would be done for before it begins if they do not have a plan in mind. When Hiyori tells him they know that much, Shinji, saying he specifically talking to her, tells her to stand down. Taunting them, Aizen states regardless of what they do, the ending will still be the same, as their fates have already been decided. As Shinji tells Hiyori to not listen, as he is only trying to provoke her, Aizen states they have nothing more to fear, seeing as they all died that night over 100 years ago.

Screaming to Hiyori, Shinji catches her top half as she falls. Now seemingly fatally injured, Hiyori tells Shinji she is sorry, as she just could not control herself. Shinji calls to Hachi, but upon realizing he only has one arm, he, remembering

   : Skeletal in appearance, her Hollow mask sports a prominent horn centered on the forehead and a row of diamond-shaped markings over the eyebrows. Upon donning her Hollow mask, the sclera of her eyes turn black, though her irises remain brown.
   She took the longest to defeat her inner Hollow out of all the current Visored (excluding Ichigo, who took about the same amount of time) at 69 minutes and 2 seconds.
   When angered or provoked in some way, the mask's power increases due to her emotions ruling her.
