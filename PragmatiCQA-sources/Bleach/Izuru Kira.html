   Izuru has blue eyes; and, shoulder-length, blond hair that is combed into three points, with two in the back of his head, and a third combed to cover his left eye. He also wears the standard Shinigami robes, and the third division's lieutenant armband on his left arm.
   When he was a student at the
   Shinigami Academy
   , his hair was shorter, and shaggier, with his bangs hanging just above his left eye; and, he wore the standard blue uniform for the males.

   Seventeen months after Aizen's defeat, Izuru's hair is shorter. He maintains the bang of hair over his left eye, with it reaching just below his eye.
   After being grievously wounded by
   Bazz-B

   Mayuri Kurotsuchi
   , Izuru retains a large hole in the right side of his chest, which is propped open by thick rods, and has altered his

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="e93a8202-7986-4bdd-9c31-32ee2f0c3216">
   Izuru is a gloomy and introspective person, not easily able to socialize with others. He generally appears weak and indifferent, leading many to believe he lacks the ability to be a leader. As an officer, he does not tend to inspire confidence or boost morale the way other lieutenants do. However, Izuru is loyal to both his friends and his duties. Despite the close friendship he shares with Momo Hinamori, Izuru shows that his loyalty to his former captain knows no boundaries when he defends his captain while she is in a grief-induced rage from her own captain's apparent death.
   Despite this, he calls himself a "monster" afterwards for raising his sword against her.
   Izuru considers the essence of war to be despair, as exemplified by the symbol of his Division, the marigold. He also hates to fight unless prompted to or given orders. However, in combat he shows ruthless determination. Izuru has shown himself remorseless with this, beheading
   an opponent
   who was pleading for mercy.
  </p>
  <p key="a0bd8eb8-3603-44b1-ba05-d5c3f4a86910">
   His personality flaws are also assets: his introspection coupled with his tendency to worry makes him indecisive, but it also makes him sensitive to unusual behavior. His loyalty to his division inspires him to great efforts in their defense, as seen when
   Momo Hinamori
   attacks
   Gin Ichimaru
   and again when
   Makoto Kibune
   's attacks endanger other members of the 3rd Division.
   Izuru's current personality greatly differs from his days in the
   Shin'ō Academy
   where he was shown to be much happier and slightly cocky after noting that Shūhei Hisagi had failed his entrance exam twice, whereas Izuru passed at the top of his class, giving him the idea that his talent was greater.

  <p key="37aabaf9-b8ca-49b6-b5f1-07f575d54f53">

   His dislike for dried persimmon (a huge difference between him and his former captain) sheds some light on the background of the poem. He likes agar-agar instead. He also writes a serial novel titled "I Want to Apologize to You." It runs in

   Izuru Kira was born into a family of lesser nobility, his parents having been dead since he was young. On the day he first entered into the Shinigami Academy, he visited his parent's grave. It is there that he met fellow student

While the two were resting underneath a tree Renji and Izuru introduced themselves and struck up a friendship with each other; it was also on this day that 5th Division Captain

  <p key="2e5ce97f-eb72-447e-a449-48fadf5007e5">
   Two months later, the class was given leave to go to the World of the Living for a training session in
   Konsō
   .
   The training session was to be lead by 6th year student
   Shūhei Hisagi
   and two of his classmates,
   Hotaru Kanisawa
   and
   Aoga
   . The fact that Hisagi was leading the mission caused a ruckus, which prompted Izuru to explain to Renji why Hisagi was so famous. Izuru then noted that he himself, as that year's top student, probably had more talent than Hisagi. The various students were then placed into three-person teams, Izuru and Renji were placed with Momo. The class then set out for the World of the Living to begin their training mission.
  </p>
  <p key="57603e75-6da7-4fe4-9f9a-ee46b667dd23">
   As the training session was coming to a close, the class was surprised when a

   attacked them and killed Kanisawa. When Aoga saw this he went to fight the Hollow, but was almost killed. Hisagi then called for all the students to fall back and run for their lives, while he held the Hollow off.
   When Momo stopped running, Izuru asked her why, to which she responded that she didn't understand why they were fleeing, despite Izuru and Renji trying to reason with her she went back to attack the Hollow and save Hisagi. Realizing there was no getting through to her, Izuru and Renji decided that they had to try and help her. Much to the surprise of Hisagi, the three of them appeared just in time to block the attacks of the Hollow. Izuru asked for forgiveness in not following Hisagi's orders, and then congratulated Momo when she used Hadō #31

Momo asks him how can he say that, but she is stopped by Izuru, who apologizes to Byakuya before a reluctant Momo does the same. He then leaves with his captain after he suddenly appears and promises to contact the Fourth Division.

Izuru explains the power of his Zanpakutō and tells her how it has affected hers, noting her inability to carry the increased weight. Rangiku explains that if her Zanpakutō is too heavy she just won't carry it. Rangiku then reveals that his weight-affecting

        One week later, Izuru visits Rangiku in the 10th Division barracks to apologize. The two get drunk and comment on how they don't need Gin, in an effort to remove the feeling of betrayal that they both felt; the events of the week before have most likely forgiven.

Realizing that Izuru has disappeared from view into the building below, Abirama decides to attack the building itself attempting to bring Izuru out by force. When Izuru realizes the attacks will bring the building down with him in it, he leaves and decides to try to evade the Arrancar out in the open. Abirama decides to end the battle and invigorates himself thus increasing his power, he then proceeds to attack Izuru and tears apart a corner of the building in doing so. Izuru plays possum so that he can get in close enough to use his Zanpakutō on the Arrancar's wings, causing him to crash through the building due to his tremendous weight. Izuru then explains to him the special ability of his Zanpakutō. When Abirama calls his ability underhanded, Izuru explains to him that war is 'depressing' and that there's 'nothing exciting about it', where as Abirama believed war to be 'fun and honorable'. He explains how his Zanpakutō represents the philosophy of his division the most, out of all Zanpakutō. Izuru then explains why his Zanpakutō is shaped the way it is, and uses it to behead Abirama.

     When Ichigo arrives in Soul Society, Izuru and other senior Shinigami arrest him as a material witness relating to the time gap in the Dangai.

     Izuru participates in a meeting in Ichigo's room, where he listens to

He then asks what to do with Nozomi. Later, when the Reigai of Kenpachi Zaraki breaks out of Urahara's trap and arrives in the Human World, Izuru and the other lieutenants arrive to help Ikkaku fight him. However, Ikkaku dismisses then, saying that they have their own opponents. When more Reigai arrive, Izuru leaves to fight the new arrivals.

Despite combining their efforts, they quickly overwhelmed by the Reigai captain, ultimately being pushed back to join their allies. Seeing how bad the situation, it is suggested they rely on Nozomi's newly acquired Shikai and its ability to absorb and redirect spiritual energy. They launch their attacks on Nozomi, who then directs the accumulated energy on the Reigai, defeating all except for the Reigai-Byakuya. The Reigai counters with a blast of his own, knocking everyone except for Ichigo and Nozomi out.

     Later after being healed, Izuru joins the other lieutenants in facing the Reigai. While still initially being overwhelmed, Byakuya Kuchiki then realizes the truth behind the Reigai's battle style: they value self-preservation the most and won't attack first in fear of being outnumbered.

Izuru asks if anyone had investigated beyond District 50. Yachiru reports that members of her Division went to District 64. Izuru learns from her that the footprints left behind were a mixture of bare feet and sandals. He states that living standards in Rukongai decline sharply beyond District 50 and statistics from the previous 550 years indicate that nobody wears sandals beyond District 59. He concludes that the sandal footprints were likely left by Shinigami. He notes that this is unusual and that the Reishi Investigation Team from the
   SRDI
   would usually participate in the investigation in such cases, but this did not happen. He asks
   Nemu Kurotsuchi
   what her captain is hiding. She states that she was not informed and Izuru replies that he is going to inform Captain-Commander Yamamoto.
