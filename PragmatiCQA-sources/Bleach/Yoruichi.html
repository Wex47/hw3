   Yoruichi Shihōin is a slender and well-endowed woman of average height. She has dark skin, golden irises, and black hair.
   Her hair is waist-length and kept in a ponytail with chin-length bangs framing the sides of her face.
   Her standard attire consists of a black, backless, sleeveless undershirt, an orange over-shirt with two white straps on each shoulder, a large beige sash around her waist,
   and black stretch pants with a pair of lightweight brown shoes,
   which allow for stealth and easy use of Shunpo.
   She previously wore a beige neck warmer, which she pulled up to cover her face in order to hide her identity, but seems to have forgone its use.
   She occasionally wears long beige wrist and leg warmers, each secured by bands.
   During the
   Quincy Blood War
   , Yoruichi wears a short dress, arm warmers and thigh length boots.
  </p>
  <p key="3ea7cf6a-e92d-4f46-98f7-469247ba4137">
   Unlike any other known Shinigami, she can transform into a small black cat for long periods of time. In this form, she has a distinctive male voice and golden eyes.
  </p>
  <p key="01b482aa-4bf9-48d3-89e9-5279f00b476a">
   110 years ago, during her time as a captain, she wore the same sleeveless and backless Onmitsukidō uniform, with long black wrist guards which Suì-Fēng wears now, but had a black ribbon tied around her neck.
   She wore a long-sleeved captain's

   . Her hair was much shorter, cut in a style similar to
   Suì-Fēng
   's current hairstyle, but without the braids.
   At some point prior to this, she wore the white Onmitsukidō uniform of the correction corps.

    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="a6460f8f-6aad-4df6-ab14-58e7dda19dad">
   Yoruichi is intelligent and witty, holding an intimate knowledge of Soul Society and its workings, as she was the former leader of the Onmitsukidō and the Second Division's captain. Although of noble birth, she acts differently from most other nobles, very much like
   Kaien Shiba
   . For instance, she instructed Suì-Fēng to refer to her without using honorific suffixes, but reluctantly settled for being called
   <i key="b8684946-878c-4a59-9d4c-d5f13d057f59">
    "Yoruichi-sama"
   </i>
   . On several occasions, she transforms into her Human form directly in front of Ichigo just to see his reaction to seeing her naked, which she teases him about. In addition, she speaks in a dialect used by elders, such as identifying herself as
   <i key="d7c2f9ea-db1c-42ee-a7e6-a3aee30a53f3">
    "washi"
   </i>
   (a term usually used by old men to define themselves with), instead of more feminine terms like
   <i key="d2c5e238-590b-457d-961d-151c73d7e6e7">
    "watashi"
   </i>
   , in both her Human and animal forms.
  </p>
  <p key="0f674c2f-56c2-4b3c-ab4d-38722700f281">
   While it is unknown how she obtained her cat transformation, she appears to prefer spending most of her time in it. Upon showing her Shinigami form to Ichigo, she forgot to put on clothes, as she had grown used to not needing them; due to being in cat form for so long. She especially takes delight in transforming in front of people to see their shocked reaction, due to her cat form making her sound male.
   Her love for her cat form extends to great anger should someone harm it or insult its appearance, as seen from how upset she got after her tail was damaged.
  </p>
  <p key="b4173a80-53c5-4dc9-98b8-efb799157d39">
   Although relatively calm and mature when a situation calls for it, Yoruichi is quite laid-back and playful, often teasing or flirting with those younger than her, such as

        Later, Yoruichi became the Corps Commander of the Executive Militia of the Onmitsukidō while serving as the 22nd generational Head of the Shihōin Clan, becoming the first woman to ever hold the position.
        Some time later, she would serve as Commander-in-Chief of the
        Onmitsukidō
        , as the position is traditionally held by the heads of the Shihōin Clan. She eventually rose to the position of captain of the 2nd Division of the
        Gotei 13
        , further uniting the formerly separate military arms together, as this was also traditionally done by her family.

       <p key="02669fb8-9a2f-4ec6-a2e8-153ab0759eaf">
        Some time later, she decided to change her role in the Onmitsukidō from being the Corps Commander of the Executive Militia, which is the position traditionally held by the Commander-in-Chief, to being the Corps Commander of the Corrections Corps.
        While Yoruichi was Onmitsukidō Commander, she took in Suì-Fēng as a personal bodyguard. Recognizing her talent, she became a mentor and friend. She taught Suì-Fēng most of the techniques she knew. During her time in Soul Society, she created many techniques which involved
        Shunpo
        , and taught some of them to Byakuya.
       </p>
       <p key="a12c5364-3289-4870-b20e-76969c4157a4">
        About 110 years ago, Yoruichi recommended that Kisuke Urahara, her 3rd Seat, be appointed to the recently opened position of Captain of the
        12th Division
        after the former captain,
        Kirio Hikifune
        , was promoted.
        Prior to presenting Urahara with the news of the open position, Yoruichi had a sparring session with him at the Sōkyoku Hill training space. Before retiring to the 2nd Division barracks, Yoruichi informed Urahara she had recommended him for the position. Suì-Fēng confronted Yoruichi, concerned that she was overestimating Urahara's capabilities, and proceeded to explain she believed it had been a mistake to appoint him as Corps Commander of the Detention Unit. Suì-Fēng continued by stating he was undeserving of such a position. While Yoruichi readily admitted that Urahara was not really a hard worker, she dismissed Suì-Fēng's criticisms, playfully insinuating that her focus on him must have romantic connotations, which Suì-Fēng denied.
       </p>
       <p key="556d9792-d6a2-4f70-a854-c0d39f73ab89">
        After spending the day following Urahara around Soul Society taking notes, Suì-Fēng returned to the 2nd Division barracks to show Yoruichi her evidence of Urahara's lack of competence in his position, only to find Urahara already there talking with Yoruichi. Suì-Fēng is told Urahara would be taking the captain proficiency exam, to which she stands in disbelief. Yoruichi, confirming it, further requested Suì-Fēng attend the exam as well. She explains that normally only captains are allowed to attend, but she had asked special permission to allow Suì-Fēng to attend. Suì-Fēng was at first confused about why she should attend, but Yoruichi told her there was no need to keep secrets, as she knew she was attracted to Urahara, which Suì-Fēng again denied. Yoruichi explained she knew all about how Suì-Fēng had been following Urahara around all day.
       </p>
       <p key="1205d014-9a03-44a9-8baa-4dd0496752b3">
        Suì-Fēng admitted she was following Urahara around, but stated it was to prove he was lazy, incompetent, and unworthy of Yoruichi's praise. Suì-Fēng handed her notes to Yoruichi, who, reading them, commented on how detailed they were. When Urahara didn't deny any of the information in the report, Suì-Fēng was shocked he would be so honest about his seemingly unprofessional actions. An unsurprised Yoruichi, stating Urahara never changes, praised Suì-Fēng for her intelligence gathering skills. Suì-Fēng, happy at first, realized Yoruichi regarded the notes not as intelligence information, but rather as a love letter.
       </p>
       <p key="d1a230ad-948f-4ea4-b349-584a6c127a3a">
        Suì-Fēng was reasonably distressed, and Yoruichi, laughing it off, told her to loosen up, as she wasn't serious. They were interrupted by the arrival of a squad member, who delivered a message that the people Urahara had been looking for had been found. Suì-Fēng replied that if he didn't return in time, it would put a strain on the 2nd Division's reputation and Yoruichi's. Yoruichi, dismissing this, told Urahara to hurry off to his duty, and told Suì-Fēng to help prepare for Urahara's Captain's Proficiency Test.
        Yoruichi was present with the other captains awaiting the start of the ceremony. Upon Urahara's arrival to the 1st Division barracks, where he was formerly introduced to the other captains, he was chastised by Yoruichi for being so reluctant. She told him he was already a captain, so he should stand tall.
       </p>
       <p key="f9a6256d-29bc-48b4-af95-f8703a894b54">
        A day or so after Urahara took over the 12th Division, Yoruichi was told by an Onmitsukidō member that Urahara had entered the Detention Unit property, claiming he had been given approval to go. Yoruichi couldn't recall when or even if he asked for permission or whether she granted it, but when asked if she wanted him removed, she nonchalantly told her division members not to bother and to allow him to go where he liked. When asked if she remembered the incident in question, Yoruichi plainly said no. Suì-Fēng, becoming distressed, prepared to voice her disapproval, but Yoruichi told her to calm down, as it was Kisuke they were talking about, stating he must have had an idea of some kind.
       </p>
       <p key="6c6e096b-375c-4732-90ab-6b5d045f32ee">
        Yoruichi appeared to be on good terms with the members of the Kuchiki noble Clan as she would often visit the Kuchiki Manor to play tag with a teenage
        Byakuya Kuchiki
        . On one such occasion, she was asked to train Byakuya by his grandfather
        <a href="Ginrei Kuchiki.html" key="ca603d18-2519-4c58-a2f4-ae60d0d0fde7" title="Ginrei Kuchiki">
         Ginrei Kuchiki
        </a>
        , the Head of the Kuchiki Clan and the 6th Division captain. Upon seeing the arrival of Yoruichi, Byakuya swung his sword at her, calling her a were-cat. Yoruichi, laughing, began to playfully tease him, calling him "Little Byakuya". She complained about receiving such a greeting after coming all the way there to see him. Byakuya yelled at her, saying he didn't want to see the likes of her, and he would be the head of the Kuchiki Clan soon enough, so he had no time to waste on her. While asking if that was the case, she stole the ribbon holding his hair back. Byakuya, quickly turning, swung his sword at her, but she easily dodged it.
       </p>
       <p key="be4956cc-466f-4f12-a661-7ce3aa868ab1">
        Yoruichi, laughing at him, exclaimed that if the head of the Kuchiki Clan could get his hair-tie stolen by a girl who is just playing, then the future of the Kuchiki Clan had become bleak, though this was just a ploy to entice him into another game of tag. Not to be defeated so easily, Byakuya told her not to move an inch, but before he could finish, she, telling him he couldn't catch her, used Shunpo to begin the chase. Byakuya stated he could see she wished to incite his wrath, and he promised to make her see the error of her ways, further claiming his Shunpo was far superior to hers.

       <p key="74cd268d-13f2-408c-88b8-17fe077cd43f">
        9 years later, Yoruichi attended an emergency meeting of the captains of the Gotei 13, where
        the Captain-Commander
        was giving an intelligence report on the disappearances of the 9th Division Captain
        Kensei Muguruma
        , Lieutenant
        Mashiro Kuna
        , and the other high-ranking members of their division, stating they had previously been sent out to investigate the disappearance of other division members, and declaring he will choose 5 captains to form an investigation team. When a very winded and frantic Urahara showed up to ask that he be allowed to go with the investigation team, as he had previously sent his Lieutenant
        Hiyori Sarugaki
        to the site of the disappearances, he was summarily told no by Captain-Commander Yamamoto. When he protested, he was chastised by Yoruichi, who told him he was acting pathetic and that he should get a grip on himself. She further stated he sent Hiyori himself, and for him to lose his composure like that only insulted her. The Captain-Commander continued naming the members of the investigation team, telling Yoruichi she was to standby for further orders.

        . It immediately became evident they had been set up by Aizen, but were given no right to defend themselves and prove their innocence. As a result, they were quickly given their sentences. For "committing crimes against researching and invoking forbidden phenomenon" and "deceiving and inflicting grievous injury to fellow Shinigami", Urahara was sentenced to become Human and to be exiled to the Human World. For "using forbidden Kidō techniques", Tessai was sentenced to life imprisonment in a Level 3 detention area.
        Before either of their sentences could be executed, a masked Yoruichi, entering the building, knocked the guards unconscious and rescuing the disgraced former captains, bringing them to a
        secret underground area
        .

        In this secluded area, she expounded how mad she was at them for excluding her from their plan. She revealed she had brought the eight Hollowfied Shinigami and the prototype Gigai Urahara was working on. With that epiphany, Urahara resolved to make ten Reiatsu-blocking

        When she left Soul Society, she left behind her titles and positions, and was thus relieved of her high status. She was succeeded as 2nd Division Captain and Commander of the Onmitsukidō by her protégé, Suì-Fēng, at a later date.

Orihime tells him, knowing he will be skeptical, their trainer has been standing next to him the entire time. Uryū is surprised, explaining that there can't be a Human that stealthy. Yoruichi speaks up, telling Uryū it is she who will be training them. Uryū predictably freaks out at the notion of a talking cat. After regaining his composure over the issue, Uryū calmly states he can't believe there is such a thing as a talking cat. Yoruichi tells him the issue is not about him, but about the necessary training in order to save Rukia from Soul Society. Though coming around to the idea, Uryū declines to train with them, as he has plans to train on his own, and, rather than saving Rukia, he just wishes revenge on the Shinigami who previously defeated him. Yoruichi resolves that he has no desire to go to Soul Society, and that they must go and train before it is too late.

        Yoruichi proceeds to train Chad and Orihime in an abandoned warehouse, but they can't call on their powers. Yoruichi exclaims that at this rate, no matter how long they train, they can't go to Soul Society. She states that if they can't find their powers and freely call upon them, they are as good as dead in Soul Society. Urging them both to remember the first time their powers manifested, she reaches the conclusion that their powers were activated when they were put in a position to protect others. Therefore, in order to activate their powers, they should think back on what they were trying to protect at the time. It is through Yoruichi's words that Orihime comes to understand that she wishes to protect Ichigo; this realization brings forth her powers in the form of the "

        Shortly thereafter, Chad, gaining access to his power, uses its ability to punch a huge hole in the wall, much to Yoruichi's surprise. Both Orihime and Chad are glad to have gained free use of their abilities, thus allowing them to go to Soul Society. Yoruichi tells them they have no time to celebrate, as they just damaged property and need to get out of there before they attract attention.

Once Urahara explains to them the dangers of using the passage, Yoruichi states only those who know what their hearts think will be able to follow him. When Ichigo states everyone gathered is determined to go, Yoruichi reminds him that if he loses, he will never return. Ichigo is firm in his resolve to win, and Yoruichi applauds his response. It is from this point on Yoruichi acts as a guide through the journey in the

        Jidanbō
        , one of the elites in Soul Society and guardian of the west gate. She tells everyone that it won't be easy to get past the guardian and they should prepare a plan, but she is ignored by Ichigo, Chad, and Orihime.
        Yoruichi and the others witness Ichigo's unlikely victory over Jidanbō. As per the rules, Jidanbō lets Ichigo and his friends pass through the gate, but is surprised by the unexpected arrival of
        Gin Ichimaru

        Before Ichigo can react, he, along with Jidanbō, is pushed out the gate by Gin's Shikai.

        After it is determined Ichigo is alright, he apologizes to Yoruichi for allowing the gate to close. Yoruichi says there is no need to blame himself, for if they had made it through the gate, the results would have been the same; he would still have to face Gin, so in turn he should be happy he is alive. The souls who live in the Rukongai come out of their dwellings. Yoruichi explains that anyone who is not guided into Soul Society by a Shinigami is considered an intruder, making Ichigo and his friends troublemakers in the eyes of Soul Society. As such, the souls were hiding because they were afraid.
        While resting among the citizens of Rukongai, Yoruichi discusses his plan to enter into the Seireitei without using the gate. Yoruichi asks Elder-Dono, the citizen whose house they are occupying, where they can locate

Yoruichi tells the group that even though the location of the house changes constantly, the house is always the same style and easy to identify. Not long after, they come upon the house. Before arriving, they are stopped by twin guard/servants
        Koganehiko and Shiroganehiko
        , who refuse to allow them to pass. After noticing Yoruichi, however, the twins, allowing them passage, lead them underground into the house. Inside, Kūkaku happily greets Yoruichi, who asks Kūkaku if she can help them. Yoruichi explains the situation and plan to Kūkaku, who agrees to go along.

        After undergoing the necessary training to use Kūkaku's Fireworks cannon to enter the Seireitei, the group prepares to leave. Ichigo asks if they will have to use the orb technique he learned to get through and if Yoruichi, being a cat, can achieve the same results. Yoruichi, telling him to place the orb on the ground, climbs on top of the orb and creates a seamless barrier, stating this sort of thing is like breathing to him. As Kūkaku prepares to shoot the cannon, the group enters the cannon. While inside, Yoruichi tells them to not wander off by themselves once they reach the Seireitei, and they are to run if they encounter a captain-class enemy, as their objective is to rescue Rukia and not to engage in unnecessary risks.

        The team succeeds in penetrating the barrier protecting the Seireitei, but the destabilization of the spiritual energy powered cannonball causes them to split. As the team begins to separate, Yoruichi assures Ichigo they will find a way to survive, but he must worry about himself first. The group breaks up in four separate directions, with Yoruichi left all by himself. She maintains this way is probably better.
        Yoruichi finds herself hurtling toward a group of waiting Shinigami, but she bounces back and onto the top of a nearby building before she can be caught.

Ichigo, eventually waking up, thanks Yoruichi for saving his life, but, realizing the urgency of helping their friends, gets up too fast, reopening his wounds. Yoruichi, pushing him back down, assures him they all are fine. Yoruichi tells Ichigo that he needs to rest, and that if it were not for the Hollow mask he wore at his torso, he would have sustained a serious injury. Ichigo, surprised at the broken Hollow mask, explains that he had thrown away the mask previously. Yoruichi, surprised, tells Ichigo he will take it for safe-keeping, but Ichigo states he wants to keep it. Yoruichi, becoming angry, demands he give the mask over to him. Ichigo states he is surprised by how strong Yoruichi must be, running around carrying Ichigo all this time without getting hurt. Yoruichi states it was no real problem once she returned to his original form.

She quips how she loves transforming into her true form, as it always leaves everyone surprised. Taking out an object, she tells Ichigo she will explain how she carried him there, but before she can proceed, Ichigo, becoming frantic, tells her to put on some clothes. She teases Ichigo about him being so innocent, embarrassing him. She shows him the object she used to get him to the secret underground area. She reveals its function and how to use it, claiming it is a unique item in Soul Society. Ichigo, intrigued by Yoruichi's identity, asks who she really is. Before she can answer, they both sense an intense Reiatsu, which Ichigo identifies as belonging to

The two engage in a test of speed using Shunpo, Yoruichi managing to stay a step ahead of Byakuya despite carrying an unconscious Ichigo. Yoruichi perches upon Byakuya's outstretched arm. She states he can't catch her with that level of Shunpo, and quickly moves to the top of a nearby building. She yells down to Byakuya that in three days, she will make Ichigo stronger than him, and until then, the fight between the two will be on hold.

Yoruichi calmly tells him not to think so highly of himself, for no one there, not even Ichigo, would have survived a fight against Byakuya. She adds that to remain able to outrun Byakuya, one person is all she could carry. Yoruichi states she brought him back because, with some training, it may become possible for Ichigo to defeat Byakuya. Yoruichi tells Ichigo that aside from Byakuya, Ukitake was also there; even though Ganju is an intruder and Hanatarō is a traitor, Ukitake will not let them die because they were trying to save Rukia, who is one of his subordinates. She further assures him not to worry because in three days, she will make him strong enough to defeat Byakuya and save everyone.

        Before they begin training, Yoruichi explains that all Zanpakutō have two levels of release: the first one is called Shikai (initial release), and the second is
        Bankai
        (final release), and one must achieve both to become a captain. She adds that every captain in the
        Gotei 13
        , with the exception of Kenpachi Zaraki, can release Bankai.
        Moving on, Yoruichi explains to Ichigo that the power and forms of Shikai and Bankai are dependent on the Zanpakutō. They vary according to the wielder's strength and training, but in general, by learning Bankai, one's power can grow 5 to 10 times greater. She explains that even the most gifted Shinigami need at least 10 years of training to master Bankai. Ichigo tells her that he doesn't have that much time, but Yoruichi interrupts him, telling him she is fully aware of that; she will use a different, but more dangerous method to make him achieve Bankai in 3 days.

        Yoruichi, bringing out a large white doll, states it is a Tenshintai, a rare artifact of the Onmitsukidō, which can forcibly materialize the spirit of a Zanpakutō. Yoruichi goes on to explain what is required in order to achieve Bankai. She notes that materialization means the opposite of entering the Zanpakutō's world; instead, one must summon the Zanpakutō's spirit into the real world. She explains how to use the artifact: Ichigo must stab the doll with his

Before they start, she warns him that the time limit is three days, and he only has one chance at this. Before time is up, he must force Zangetsu to submit. Ichigo stabs the artifact, causing Zangetsu to materialize. Yoruichi asks Zangetsu if he heard her conversation with Ichigo, to which he responds he has. She tells him he will choose the method of combat, and asks if they can begin immediately. Zangetsu, telling her he will, prepares to battle.

They get into an argument until she enters in her cat form. While resting, Ichigo tells Yoruichi the underground area they're in is similar to the one under Urahara's shop. Yoruichi tells him the one under the shop was most likely modeled after the area they are in now. She states the underground area was built when she and Urahara were young; Urahara dug the place in secret for their combat training. When they got older and she joined the Onmitsukidō and Urahara joined the

        While Ichigo warms up for another day of training, Yoruichi ponders the possibility of extending his training, noting that Ichigo growth is far faster than a normal Shinigami's, though only his combat techniques are improving while his spiritual energy remains the same. She decides that if his spiritual energy does not increase within the next day, she will go with whatever state Ichigo has developed. She reasons that there isn't enough time for an extension, and it would be too dangerous at that point of training.

        Yoruichi is present when the secret underground training area is breached by Renji, who tells her and Ichigo Rukia's execution has been moved, taking place at noon the following day. Yoruichi is surprised by this new information, thinking there is no way Ichigo can attain Bankai in that small amount of time. Ichigo, refusing to give up, tells Yoruichi this training method was her idea, and she shouldn't give up before anyone else.
        Renji, eventually finishing training, asks Yoruichi if Ichigo will make it. She states she is not worried, for she is certain that Ichigo possesses the instinct necessary to learn Bankai.
        To help Ichigo in rescuing Rukia, she lends him the Tentōken, a cape which allows its user to fly by inserting some spirit power into it.

        Landing in a forest, they engage in hand-to-hand combat before putting some distance between themselves. Suì-Fēng comments that even though they have not seen each other in a long time, Yoruichi has not gotten any stronger. Yoruichi states that, on the contrary, she thinks Suì-Fēng has gotten weaker. Suì-Fēng states the Tenshiheisonban, the Shihōin Clan, has fallen, for if Yoruichi helping the Ryoka is revealed, her clan name will surely be removed from the list of the 4 great families.

Suì-Fēng warns her not to get cocky and think she is still better than her after all these years. Suì-Fēng states both the Onmitsukidō and the Executive Militia are now under her control, as Yoruichi's era ended long ago. Taking out her Zanpakutō, she proceeds to drive it into the tree she is standing on. Suddenly, Yoruichi is surrounded by a cadre of Executive Militia members. Before any of the Executive Militia can react, Yoruichi uses Shunpo to take out every Executive Militia member in the area within seconds.

Appearing behind Yoruichi, she attempts a second strike, but Yoruichi uses Shunpo to escape. After gaining some distance, Yoruichi turns around and goes on the offensive, attacking Suì-Fēng with knives hidden in her boot. Suì-Fēng blocks the incoming knives and manages to land a second strike on Yoruichi, asking her if she now understands Suì-Fēng is stronger than her. Suì-Fēng reveals her new technique, which combines Kidō and Hakuda, exclaiming she has never used it in battle and has only recently invented it. Yoruichi, however, tells her it has a name:

Suì-Fēng, yelling that she should have been able to surpass Yoruichi in all these hundreds of years, continues to attack her, but Yoruichi dodges her attacks effortlessly. Yoruichi stops the attacks by initiating a Shunkō powered punch, but stops short of actually hitting Suì-Fēng. Upset and unwilling to fight anymore, Suì-Fēng breaks down and cries, asking why Yoruichi did not take her with her. She bows down to Yoruichi in defeat.
