   When Urahara reveals Ichigo is currently fighting Quilge in Hueco Mundo, Akon, wondering how Ichigo noticed Quincy activity in Hueco Mundo before they did, notes he is extremely unpredictable. When Akon asks how the battle is progressing, Urahara states Ichigo is pressing Quilge. As Ichigo attacks Quilge, Urahara comments on how Quilge seems to want to seal Ichigo's Bankai, but it is not working, so he is losing. Stating Akon must know the enemy's level, Urahara reveals he knows there was a trespasser in Soul Society, stating it must be quite a situation the Shinigami have got on their hands if they have to contact them, and asks once again how they are doing.
   As Akon begins talking directly to Ichigo,
   Hiyosu tells the technicians to inform the 13 divisions they succeeded in reaching Ichigo, who is heading to Soul Society.

   As Rin thinks to himself Ichigo will definitely save Soul Society, Ichigo is informed of the casualties and damages the battle has generated so far. When Ichigo asks if their Reiatsu vanishing means they died, Akon, stating they cannot be sure, confirms the vice-captain whose Reiatsu vanished was neither Rukia nor Renji. Describing the appearance and power of the Sternritter, Akon reveals the Wandenreich have had no losses, and the Shinigami have not won a single battle. When Ichigo asks what the enemy's abilities are, Akon, confirming they know nothing except they are Quincy, reveals the enemy can steal Bankai. When Ichigo asks how this is possible, Akon states the information comes from the captains of the 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 10th Divisions, who all had their Bankai stolen. Connecting to Urahara, Akon has him explain

Noting he does not know how it works, Urahara states the important thing is Quilge was unable to steal Ichigo's Bankai, and though he is not sure why, it seems the enemy waited until Ichigo was in Hueco Mundo to invade Soul Society. Before Ichigo can enter Soul Society, he is trapped there by Quilge, who uses his ability to snare him in a cage and close the way to Soul Society.

   Receiving the message, a Riteitai states since they cannot transmit messages to captains who are fighting, they will just leave transmitter swords in every battlefield and leave, and when they are ready, they will be able to send messages directly. As they do so, one of them is shot down by Shunsui's opponent. Telling all the captains and lieutenants to listen, Rin reveals Ichigo is heading to Soul Society, and the enemy is unable to steal his Bankai. As the Shinigami react to this news, Akon notes Ichigo's Reiatsu has vanished. As Ichigo continues to try to break the prison, Akon tries to talk to him. When Ichigo tells him he is stuck, Akon is unable to hear him. Realizing something happened in the Garganta, Akon sends the Ritei team to investigate what happened.
