   Kariya is a tall, fair-skinned man with a lithe but muscular body. He has crimson eyes with thick black eyebrows that sharply arch upward as they progress outward from his brow with pointed tips that extend off of his face, a flat mouth, and a thin vertical scar on the left side of his chin that widens near the bottom, as well as white hair that is both shaggy and neatly cropped short as it flares upward and outward, with a horn-like tip sticking out on either side of his head. Kariya wears an asymmetrically-designed dress shirt: the right half and the left sleeve and breast are red, but the flared collar and the left half of the torso are black, with the black portion of the left side rising diagonally at the front to terminate near Kariya's collar and doing so near his shoulder blades at the back; over this, he wears an orange tie whose end is completely flat instead of pointed.
   After his battle against

   , Kariya dons a variant of this shirt where the non-black portions are instead gray, substituting a red tie with the same flat end as the orange one.
   Over this, Kariya wears a predominantly dark blue, ankle-length coat with the cuffs, upper strips of the sleeves, lapels, collar, and shoulders instead being light brown, as well as dark brown-red pants with a zipper at the front and black dress shoes.

   and stretching over his deltoids with two flowing lines on either side to terminate in points behind his shoulders.

   , Kariya, then known as Eugene, had large dark blue eyes with normal brown eyebrows, a small mouth and nose, and shaggy brown hair. He wore a pale green hooded robe with black cuffs and a light-brown middle section, as well as black sandals;
   his eyes turned red and his hair turned white after gaining

   which persisted through his marriage to

  <p key="d5ea783b-02eb-4fb9-a2f3-2f862d0a69c7">
   Kariya is a calm and self-assured man whose confident demeanor rarely ever falters, even when facing powerful opposition,
   dealing with unexpected or unwanted developments,
   or knowing that he is about to die,
   with his absolute conviction in himself and his worldview informing all of his decisions no matter how extreme
   and leading him to never change his mind about his course of action no matter what is presented to him,
   only ever wavering or expressing true shock when dealing with
   <a href="Yoshino Sōma.html" key="d8790b40-294a-4324-a624-1ac22c88a682" title="Yoshino Sōma">

   or
   Ran'Tao
   .
   At the same time, he knows the limits of his own power
   and rarely underestimates the strength of others.
  </p>
  <p key="ab039b37-18d0-43e9-8e13-7292b4b2f247">
   However, though he generally puts on a charismatic air of affableness and geniality without overt aggression when speaking to others, even in the middle of combat,
   Kariya has an undercurrent of hatred and anger that often rises to the surface; as noted by
   Gō Koga
   , he is as kind as he is cruel,
   and Ran'Tao observes that he is more emotional than he looks and more short-tempered than he sounds.
   This wrathful side of Kariya emerges when someone disagrees with his vision and plan for the
   <a href="Bount.html" key="67d35254-b879-4789-9791-322e593bab46" title="Bount">
    Bount
   </a>
   ,
   when faced with Ran'Tao, whom he believes is responsible for all the suffering of him and his tribe,
   when someone acts as though they understand him,
   and when faced with an opponent who either insists on trying to change his mind
   or refuses to accept his worldview.
   This friendliness was not always a façade: Kariya was genuinely cheerful as a child,
   and even after
   <a href="Soul Society.html" key="d009d98d-7873-40df-8e51-8c35c58d8f4f" title="Soul Society">

   turned on his tribe, he was still compassionate toward his fellow Bount,
   but centuries of tragedies, hardship, and suffering drastically embittered Kariya to the point of cynical, bitter jadedness.
  </p>
  <p key="630b19b1-f37b-438a-9f68-6f41920a1fca">
   In line with his underlying anger, when dropping the pretense of reasonability and restraint, Kariya displays great bloodthirst, ruthlessness, and sociopathy; he has no qualms about consuming living
   <a href="Human.html" key="363b6ceb-386e-4bca-8fe5-f2fec5806958" title="Human">

   </a>
   , being one of the few Bount to do so, and is enraptured by the process to the point of resembling a feral beast.
   This darker side of Kariya first emerged after he merged with
   <b key="95986ccf-1ec7-4b92-b11e-37d3443f6917">
    Messer
   </b>
   and slaughtered the Hollows attacking him and his fellow Bount, only intensifying over time,
   and extends to his allies, whom he is more than willing to sacrifice or kill when he feels they are no longer useful
   or when they firmly disagree with his plan.
   He will unhesitatingly attack those who are already incapacitated and no threat to him just to demonstrate how much he looks down upon them
   and once got into a fight with an entire gambling hall of Kusajishi denizens who stood no chance against him just to have some fun.
   In order to lure out
   Byakuya Kuchiki
   to test his power, Kariya had

   </a>
   , knowing her suffering would drive Byakuya to seek revenge and not caring about the pain inflicted upon her.
   Though Ran'Tao once saved his life at great personal risk and expense, Kariya holds nothing but contempt for her and repeatedly attempted to kill Ran'Tao when she tried to appeal to him, refusing to accept that she had tried to help him and had nothing to do with his subsequent torment.
   He also cannot comprehend the idea of caring about the wellbeing or fate of someone who is an enemy.
  </p>
  <p key="80ab6481-4f2f-466e-b8b5-11aef11f2bd6">
   Likewise, Kariya is incredibly arrogant and brazen; when confronted about how he was violating the sole law of the Bount tribe against consuming living Souls, Kariya simply proclaimed that he was the new law of the tribe,
   and when seeking to test his
   <b key="39af1051-bb1f-41cd-bfa8-bfe99886a042">

    </a>
   </b>
   -enhanced power, Kariya provoked Byakuya, whom he knew to be one of the most powerful captains in the history of the
   Gotei 13
   , primarily because he felt the latter would be a fitting challenge that he could overcome, even electing to fight him completely barehanded.
   During his final battle against
   <a href="Ichigo Kurosaki.html" key="2f748f04-f352-4af9-bbec-2a35da2e70cb" title="Ichigo Kurosaki">
    Ichigo Kurosaki
   </a>
   , Kariya moved the battle to

    Sōkyoku Hill
   </a>
   solely because he believed the location would be a fitting place to end his campaign with its history in Soul Society.
   With this arrogance, Kariya is obsessed with attaining great power at any cost, both because he believes that he deserves it and because he views it as the best way to achieve his goals,
   and will not heed or even acknowledge any proposals to use that power to an end other than destroying Soul Society.
   He also staunchly believes people naturally hate those who are superior to themselves; due to this, he could not fathom Ichigo protecting those weaker than he is simply because they were his friends.
  </p>
  <p key="346d72e0-99b4-44b9-b22d-549dd74c2e0f">
   Additionally, Kariya is an intelligent and analytical man who is both predictive and manipulative of others; he frequently tricks both allies and enemies into furthering his goals by faking weakness,
   mistakes,
   or mercy
   while planning his next moves around anticipated actions taken by those around him that he is sure will come to pass and always do, due to his keen understanding of others.
   He is often philosophical when expressing his outlook on life,
   most commonly when ruminating on the Bount
   and the nature of conflict.
   Kariya frequently uses his literal view of the world as a metaphor to express his feelings on it, such as considering
   <a href="Karakura Town.html" key="c816bff2-2fb6-455e-8bfb-2f7c4b4e3ad8" title="Karakura Town">
    Karakura Town
   </a>
   to look most beautiful at night due to being covered in darkness,
   believing that the world looks more colorful instead of ashen gray as his plan begins to progress,
   and believing that Ichigo would not be able to color his world at his current level of strength;
   though he once had an appreciation for the actual beauty of the
   <a href="Human World.html" key="1d9ac3c6-5047-42af-8ff3-ea52970d502c" title="Human World">
    Human World
   </a>
   as well,
   Kariya became disillusioned with it and only regained this point of view upon entering Soul Society, where he felt free for the first time in his life
   and frequently commented on how nice each day felt
   or simply smiled up at the clear sky.
  </p>
  <p key="6eefdc55-f3a5-4e4b-b9b4-29e7fdb12abe">
   Regarding the Bount, Kariya once cared for his tribe, even as they pushed him away due to his violent and extreme tendencies,
   and did his best to nurture young and inexperienced members into potential comrades by having Koga mentor them, believing in their tribe's glory,
   but following repeated massacres of the Bount and his tribe not heeding his advice to establish a civilization in the Human World, Kariya grew bitter and spiteful toward them, eventually considering all the ones who had died to have been too weak to stand alongside him anyway.
   In the present, he is highly cynical about both the potential
   and future of the Bount,
   but still elects himself the leader of the few remaining members of his tribe, whom he claims he will lead out of the shadows of history.
   However, while genuinely pained by the death and suffering his fellow Bount have experienced over centuries of oppression and indignity,
   Kariya merely uses this as a pretext for his genocidal plan and to motivate the remaining Bount into following him:
   he is amused to the point of maniacal laughter by
   <a href="Hō and Ban.html" key="d5d48061-2a05-40ff-8d3a-787e21334622" title="Hō and Ban">

   </a>
   dying in the process of carrying out his orders,
   violently silences any opposition to his methods,
   sends the other Bount out to achieve lesser goals while he stays behind or works elsewhere instead of providing support,
   and ultimately considers all of them to be completely disposable pawns, not grieving their deaths in pursuit of his endgame
   and even admitting he believes they should all end up dead
   and erased from history.

  <p key="cae0cc0c-db6e-47ed-8b47-5dfaf1ff39ba">
   Despite this, Kariya does have a more vulnerable and Human side; when waiting for Yoshino to return to his mansion, rather than focusing on the fight ahead or his larger plan, Kariya instead elected to fix a broken grandfather clock he found in the wreckage
   and used it as a metaphor for the plight of the Bount, only resolving to go through with sacrificing Yoshino for his plan after repairing the clock and speaking with Koga and
   Maki Ichinose
   about the situation.
   He also enjoys gambling
   and smoking,
   and is attached to his regular shirt-and-coat outfit.
   When facing opponents who have impressed him with their strength and tenacity, Kariya is more than willing to make them offers to avoid further fighting, such as consuming their Soul so they can experience everlasting glory alongside him
   or permitting them to fight alongside him as equals.
   Kariya is genuinely friendly with

   like the Bount did and believes they are destined to walk the same path;
   however, though willing to let Uryū change his mind on his own instead of forcing him to do so
   and genuinely grateful when Uryū ends up helping the Bount enter Soul Society,
   Kariya is not above mocking him for his powerlessness rendering him useless to the Bount and his friends
   and genuinely cannot comprehend why Uryū would ever side with the Shinigami instead of the Bount.
   He also has some measure of mercy underneath his ruthlessness: when declaring that the Bount no longer needed the residents of Kusajishi, Kariya was willing to let them leave unscathed and only attacked them when they attempted to assault him in outrage,
   and when Koga turned on him after learning of his true intentions, Kariya merely incapacitated him with a wound Koga could heal with

   instead of killing him outright out of gratitude for Koga staying by his side for so long.
   Additionally, he is willing to explain his plan and intentions to those whom he believes are about to die solely so they do not do so uninformed.
  </p>
  <p key="fe1d0e91-831e-4630-a107-ea5e1edc31b5">
   Kariya's relationship with his former wife Yoshino is highly tense and troubled: when the two first met during Yoshino's suicide attempt, Kariya truly cared about Yoshino and promised her that his love was endless, but over time this faded in sincerity as his darker side and instincts intensified, culminating in Yoshino abandoning him upon witnessing Kariya ferally consuming a man's Soul.
   While Kariya still cares about Yoshino's wellbeing,
   he only does so due to her maternal

   being crucial to his plan
   and has no qualms about harming and imprisoning her when Yoshino's actions irritate him.
   Though he was uncertain about doing so at first, Kariya fought and eventually sacrificed Yoshino to create the

  </p>
  <p key="a93a4ad1-64ac-47f1-b10c-090112de8b59">
   Kariya holds Ichinose as his right-hand man and places a great deal of trust in the latter,
   often praising him for his competence
   and treating Ichinose like an equal by consulting him about philosophical matters
   and the Bount under Kariya's leadership,
   even trusting Ichinose implicitly to protect him
   and act in his stead.
   This relationship began back when Kariya and Koga saved Ichinose from a

   of a young boy from, with Kariya being impressed by Ichinose's resolve and assuring the latter that his weakness was not to be ashamed of.
   However, this relationship began to fray when Ichinose caught up to Kariya during his fight with Ichigo, where Kariya callously informed him that all of the other Bount were dead and refused to heed Ichinose's warning that using the power of the

  </p>
  <p key="99b55ca0-0799-4a90-8e0c-1fff9cf5fdd0">
   Despite Ichinose being his confidante, Kariya is closest to Koga, whom he has known for centuries and entrusted Cain to for mentorship; prior to this, the two believed that Bount should live alone and independently, but his tragic passing led them to decide that the sadness of their existence was too painful for Bount to bear in isolation.
   Though he has been with Koga ever since
   and is considerably forgiving of
   and trusting in him,
   Kariya does not always listen to Koga
   and or fully inform him of the current stage of their plan.
   Eventually, Kariya revealed his complete lack of empathy for the rest of the Bount and his intention to destroy all of existence to Koga, and when the latter turned on him over this, Kariya simply incapacitated him and left out of gratitude for how much Koga had assisted him over the years, though he refused to even consider Koga's proposition that he use his newfound power for something constructive and instead mocked it as him being unusually serious.

  <p key="82f1fad3-9f7d-4d18-b914-c52ccf93412d">
   Though Ichigo originally had nothing to do with his plan and he only knew of the former as an acquaintance of Uryū's, Kariya began developing an interest in Ichigo after watching him fight and witnessing his considerable power,
   though he was disappointed when Ichigo failed to match him in combat and decided Ichigo would not bring color to his world.
   However, even though he was further unimpressed by Ichigo during their second battle and saw him only as someone to test his

   and welcomed him to follow the Bount to Soul Society.
   This continued into their third encounter, where Kariya was further enamored by Ichigo's raw power and speed,
   and their fourth fight, where Kariya saw that Ichigo had grown strong enough to counter his techniques,
   culminating in their fifth and climactic battle where Ichigo became the first person Kariya ever fully and honestly explained his worldview to in an attempt to make Ichigo understand him, only to be confused and angered when Ichigo refused to accept or agree with Kariya's actions. Out of respect for Ichigo's tenacity and resolve, as well as understanding they were more similar than either of them would willingly admit, Kariya allowed him to win their final clash and expressed genuine regret at not being able to see whether Ichigo would walk down the same path he did, even trying to tell Ichigo something heartfelt before being cut off by his body turning to ashes.
  </p>
  <p key="6d1e81f6-8414-4cd5-a0cb-612564f1b9dc">
   In combat, Kariya is brutal, remorseless, and cruel;
   he enjoys utterly overwhelming opponents
   and flaunting his great physical strength in order to prove himself superior.
   He also has a notable sadistic streak, demonstrated when he decided that it would be most fitting to kill Ichigo with his partner and the source of his power,
   <b key="fabea12f-185b-4d19-8c37-dca33db35086">
    Zangetsu

   .
   Kariya constantly seeks genuine challenges to his might, both to test himself and to inspire fear in others by triumphing.
   While aware of his physical limits, Kariya also prides himself on his extensive lifespan giving him the fighting skills necessary to overcome those with attributes he cannot otherwise match, such as Ichigo's hyperspeed when using Bankai.
   In line with this, Kariya considers the power of his

   , to be virtually invincible and unlimited, since it uses the most common resource in existence to fight and is difficult to even perceive when attacking;
   however, he is also overconfident in its ability to defend him in tandem with his own tactics and was surprised when both Ichigo and Byakuya managed to push through his defense and injure him.
   He also prefers to keep

    Messer
   </b>
   unsummoned when in combat,
   only properly manifesting it to opponents he considers truly worthy of being defeated by its full power.
   When it comes to his opponents, Kariya is generally amused by their strategies and powers,
   but will readily admit when he is impressed by a sufficient display of might.
   Conversely, Kariya becomes even more aggressive and patronizing than usual if a foe disappoints him by not living up to his expectations.
  </p>
  <p key="71cd6f09-58b1-4672-8130-21390281d47a">
   Ultimately, while he claims to desire revenge against Soul Society and Shinigami for creating and oppressing the Bount,
   to the point of wishing to strike terror into the hearts of the Seireitei's residents,
   and refuses to compromise on his goal of obliterating all of them along with every living being in existence,
   after centuries of witnessing and experiencing suffering, torment, abuse, poverty, and the existence of his tribe only ever degrading and growing worse,
   Kariya simply wishes to die, firmly believing that he has been cursed by being born a Bount and that he was the only sane man in a completely crazy world, and the true goal of his complex plan to acquire power and invade the Seireitei was to be killed in combat by someone who both understood his plight and was strong enough to face him at full power; to this end, he eventually let Ichigo kill him before he could unleash the power of the

   Following this, Eugene found
