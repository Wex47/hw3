   Yamamoto is a fair-skinned man of average height. The oldest captain in the

   long eyebrows, long mustache, and a hip-length white beard secured by a purple band crossing down it. He has many scars on about torso, with the two most prominent being a pair of long scars crossing above his right eye, one of which was left by his battle with his lieutenant.

   When he was much younger, Yamamoto had black hair on the sides of his head, and was bald on top. He had a tuft of hair sticking up at the back of his head in a topknot. He had thick but more manageable eyebrows and mustache with no beard. He had a single large scar on his forehead, which earned him the nickname "

   noted 1000 years ago, Yamamoto was a demon himself, using any necessary means to defeat his enemies, and treated Humans and his own subordinates alike as expendable pawns; it was only after defeating the Quincy and attaining peace did Yamamoto live with honor and justice that led him to hesitate in sacrificing people heedlessly.

During one of his visits, Chōjirō told Yamamoto he wished to be his right arm and compensate for anything which Yamamoto could not do. When Yamamoto told him to become his disciple, he declined. At Yamamoto's behest, Chōjirō tried to defeat him with his Bankai. Though he failed to defeat him, he left a permanent scar on Yamamoto's forehead, crossing his earlier scar.

Stating if he cannot break one bone, he will result to tactics which bring more pain, he removes his top.

As Wonderweiss screams, other arms, appearing from his shoulders, attack Yamamoto with an onslaught of punches.

When he tells Yamamoto the only inhuman one is him, for he just crushed a soul with purpose, Yamamoto states he has no intention of entering into a pointless argument with the likes of him, for it will all soon be over. Telling him he makes light of his words, Aizen states he should remember his previous words: Wonderweiss' Resurrección,

Stating sealing the blade makes it impossible for it to create new flames, Aizen asks what happens to flames already produced, for Yamamoto had flames already in effect before Wonderweiss showed up. As he asks him where those flames were sealed, Yamamoto realizes those flames are sealed in Wonderweiss' body, and since he is dead, they will explode. As Yamamoto jumps on the body, it erupts in a large area, destroying buildings around it. Aizen approaches as the flames subside to reveal Yamamoto, who has been injured by the explosion. Aizen states he is truly worthy of the title of Captain-Commander, having reduced the damage of such a large explosion, and had he not suppressed the explosion with his body, the flames would have vaporized the barrier around the Fake Karakura Town, and an area greater than the size of the town would have been turned to ashes. Thanking Yamamoto for protecting his world, he, moving close to him, unsheathes his Zanpakutō, telling him he cannot afford to spare his life as he did with the other shinigami he subdued, for Yamamoto is the history of Soul Society, so at the very least, he must finish him off with his own blade. Grabbing Aizen by the ankle, he, telling him to not make him say it again, calls Aizen naive.
        Yamamoto takes advantage of the damage inflicted by Wonderweiss' explosion to use his own charred body as a catalyst for the sacrificial spell,

        Ten days after Aizen's defeat and subsequent capture, Yamamoto returns to Soul Society, where his injuries are healed, save for his lost left arm. He is furious to learn that not only did Captains Shunsui, Byakuya, and Kenpachi lose their respective captain haori, but that they care very little about it. He proceeds to scold the three for their lack of care for the symbol of their station.

As the explosion settles, Inaba, emerging unharmed, reveals since he could not negate and copy their attacks at the same time, he instead copied Nozomi's absorption power and used it to counter Yamamoto and Ichigo's attack. When Inaba unleashes all the collected energy against Yamamoto, Nozomi, appearing in front of Yamamoto, attempts to absorb the blast.

When Ichigo arrives at the First Division, he meets with Yamamoto and most of the other captains. Yamamoto starts to say Ichigo had fought an arduous battle, but Ichigo states he came to take back Kūgo's body so he can bury it. After Ichigo explains his reasons to Shinji, Yamamoto states he believes Ichigo thought carefully about it before making his request.
   He eventually approves his request, and Ichigo tells him to inform other Shinigami about his Substitute Shinigami license, for he will resume his former position.

   : With his millennia of experience as a teacher and warrior, along with being the commander of the entire Gotei 13, Yamamoto is a very intelligent man. He can quickly adjust to new developments and make quick decisions accordingly. He has great tactical acumen, proven by his preparations for the battle in the Fake Karakura Town. As noted by Aizen, Yamamoto is very cunning, setting up a trap to kill him while Aizen was focused on the Visored and the rest of the Gotei 13.
   He is a very perceptive man, easily deducing Captain

    Immeasurable Spiritual Power

   : Being the most experienced Shinigami, Yamamoto possesses an extremely massive and powerful Reiryoku. Its sheer strength is powerful enough to effortlessly break free from four overlapping and high-level Bakudō spells restraining him.
   Even Aizen openly acknowledges Yamamoto's power (via his Zanpakutō) as being so superior that if he were to fight directly against it, it would overpower him.
   Yamamoto has served as the Captain-Commander of the Gotei 13 for over 1,000 years because there has not been a Shinigami stronger than him in all this time.

    : Yamamoto can exert his Reiatsu to induce fear in captain-level combatants, and can physically paralyze and possibly even choke combatants of lieutenant-level and lower simply by gazing in their direction.
    Yamamoto's spiritual pressure has the same effect as his Zanpakutō, for it is the elemental representative of fire. He tends to glow with a fiery aura,
    which has the potential to burn and set his surroundings on fire without the use of his Zanpakutō. It is the formidable pressure of his Reiatsu which makes the Reiatsu itself look like flames.
    When Yamamoto is enraged, his Reiatsu is powerful enough to be felt all around Seireitei with tremendous force.

   He sustained an explosion of flames which had the power to incinerate all of Karakura Town and a great area around it.
   In his younger years, he challenged Chōjirō to defeat him with his newly achieved Bankai, and in the end only suffered a light scar on his forehead.
   2000 years later, he would take on a barrage of powerful lightning strikes from Chōjirō's fully-mastered Bankai and only be singed by its power, though he stated it became weaker from
