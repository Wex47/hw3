   Yamamoto is a fair-skinned man of average height. The oldest captain in the
   Gotei 13
   , he has aged into a elderly man with a bald head, visible wrinkles, hooked nose, and pronounced cheekbones. He has red eyes,
   long eyebrows, long mustache, and a hip-length white beard secured by a purple band crossing down it. He has many scars on about torso, with the two most prominent being a pair of long scars crossing above his right eye, one of which was left by his battle with his lieutenant.
   In addition to the standard

   draped over his back instead of actually wearing it, with its size being greatly exaggerated. Despite his old and frail demeanor, often standing in a hunch, he in fact has a very muscular and well-defined built, which he only reveals when serious for battle, something which
   Shunsui Kyōraku
   claims is not seen too often. After his brief confrontation with

  <p key="e09fa643-76f4-48ef-bdfb-23ce45592fa2">
   When he was much younger, Yamamoto had black hair on the sides of his head, and was bald on top. He had a tuft of hair sticking up at the back of his head in a topknot. He had thick but more manageable eyebrows and mustache with no beard. He had a single large scar on his forehead, which earned him the nickname "

   " due to its shape. He had prominent crease on his forehead and beneath his eyes, and shallow cheeks. He wore the typical black outfit of a Shinigami, with the addition of sleeveless captain's haori worn appropriately.

   As the Captain-Commander of the
   Gotei 13
   , Yamamoto is highly respected by most of the Shinigami, most notably
   Sajin Komamura
   , who views Yamamoto as a benefactor who saved his life. The embodiment of conviction, Yamamoto follows the laws and regulations of

   to the letter, and expects the same of others. He is not a man to tolerate insubordination, and is vocal with those who attempt to act in such a manner. He is quick to anger in the face of possible betrayal and can be quite aggressive in combat. He has a habit of referring to those he faces in battle as "

   ". When in a state of peace, he carries himself with an air of frailty, to the point where he fell asleep standing while awaiting
   Shunsui Kyōraku
   's arrival for a meeting. Due to years of experience, Yamamoto very rarely shows any sign of distress or surprise, usually responding by opening one or both of his eyes, which are partially closed slits for the majority of the time.

  <p key="4b7e5fdf-45af-412a-aba3-8c3b413c57a0">
   Yamamoto is very loyal to Soul Society, and takes his duties very seriously, expecting the same from the rest of the Gotei 13. His loyalty is so great, he is willing to sacrifice himself and the Gotei 13 in order to defeat Aizen, believing it to be their duty to lay down their lives for the sake of the Soul Society if necessary.
   Yamamoto becomes visibly angry when Shunsui,
   Byakuya Kuchiki

   lose their

   Despite his stern and steadfast personality, it is not to say he has no compassion and admiration, even for his enemies, as he was reluctant to strike down
   Wonderweiss Margela
   for his childish form and personality (only managing to get through this when Wonderweiss'
   Resurrección
   makes him no longer look like a child),
   and felt pity for him that

   for their bravery of attacking him with only one arm each, and struck them down without killing them.
   Yamamoto felt particularly furious when

  <p key="c7345b57-9180-4f5d-a11c-4dfd80d15c1f">
   Yamamoto was apparently shameful of his past actions. He once referred to a painting of his past self as a monster that brought the Soul Society further turmoil when it was in a period of instability.

   noted 1000 years ago, Yamamoto was a demon himself, using any necessary means to defeat his enemies, and treated Humans and his own subordinates alike as expendable pawns; it was only after defeating the Quincy and attaining peace did Yamamoto live with honor and justice that led him to hesitate in sacrificing people heedlessly.

        Yamamoto was himself a teacher at this academy, and personally instructed
        Shunsui Kyōraku
        and
        Jūshirō Ukitake
        . He admits to being rather proud of the two. When they became captains, he boasted about them as though they were his sons.

        ", a reference to the large scar on his forehead, despite knowing it annoyed him. He insisted it would be wrong to use Yamamoto's real name. During one of his visits, Chōjirō told Yamamoto he wished to be his right arm and compensate for anything which Yamamoto could not do. When Yamamoto told him to become his disciple, he declined. At Yamamoto's behest, Chōjirō tried to defeat him with his Bankai. Though he failed to defeat him, he left a permanent scar on Yamamoto's forehead, crossing his earlier scar. Others began to refer to him by a different name due to the new scar, but Chōjirō refused to use this new name. As a result, Yamamoto decided to call himself Genryūsai.

        On various occasions, Yamamoto would catch the young

        sneaking into his room. On one particular instance, he scolded the boy for doing so. When Shunsui asked about a painting of a dark silhouette within a field of fire, Yamamoto explained how the painting was of a monster which appeared in Soul Society a long time ago. He stated it had appeared at a time when Soul Society was facing a difficult situation, and the monster's appearance had made the situation worse. Yamamoto stated it was unlikely to return, but if it did, its return would mark Yamamoto's last day in Soul Society.

        Yoruichi Shihōin

        10 years later, Yamamoto called an emergency meeting of the captains of the
        Gotei 13
        , where he gave an intelligence report on the disappearances of
        9th Division
        Captain
        Kensei Muguruma
        and Lieutenant
        Mashiro Kuna

As he stated he would choose 5 captains to form an investigation team, a very winded and frantic Urahara showed up to ask permission to go with the investigation team, for he had previously seen his lieutenant,
        Hiyori Sarugaki
        , go to the sight of the disappearances. Declining to grant this, Yamamoto, continuing with the meeting, selected

        Yamamoto ordered Unohana to prepare her relief stations for casualties. When Unohana insisted she should tend to the wounded at the site of the disappearances, Yamamoto stated he could not send healers without knowing the full extent of the situation. Upon the arrival of the captain of the
        Kidō Corps
        ,
        Tessai Tsukabishi
        , and his lieutenant,
        Hachigen Ushōda
        , Yamamoto, asking Tessai if he had heard the news of the disappearances, told him he wanted the two of them to head to the campground as well. Interrupting, Shunsui asked if it was a good idea to send both the captain and lieutenant of the Kidō Corps when they had no idea what was going on. When Yamamoto asked what he would suggest, Shunsui told him they should send his lieutenant,
        Lisa Yadōmaru
        . With the squad formed, Yamamoto sent them out to investigate the disappearances.

Pointing out how he had taken action without permission, Yamamoto stated his quick actions kept casualties low and damage to a minimum, and therefore he would not punish Isshin. As Isshin turned to leave, Yamamoto, suspecting Isshin was leaving out information, asked if there was something else worth mentioning, which Isshin denied.

        Yamamoto appears somewhat surprised at the arrival of the

        When

        approaches Yamamoto to greet him, Yamamoto asks if he has come for revenge. Shinji tells him if it is against Aizen, they have, but as for the Gotei 13, he could not care less. He states if he were mad at the Gotei 13, it would be for making the barrier around the Fake Karakura Town so hard to get through. When Shinji states if he had not found Lieutenant Chōjirō outside the barrier, they still would be on the outside of it, Chōjirō apologizes to Yamamoto for allowing them in, saying he thought it was necessary given the circumstances, but before he can finish, Yamamoto, forgiving his actions, asks Shinji if he is right to assume they are allies. Telling him it is obvious they are not, Shinji states the Visored are not on the Gotei 13's side, but they are against Aizen, and they are Ichigo's allies. Yamamoto muses to himself about the statement of the Visored being Ichigo's allies.

        After the last combatants are defeated by Aizen, Yamamoto makes his presence known by drawing Aizen's attention with a huge pillar of fire. Aizen states though he has finally shown himself, he is too late: as of now, he is the only one left to be counted as manpower. Aizen notes if he falls, the Gotei 13 will crumble, and states Yamamoto has lost his chance. When Yamamoto asks Aizen if he really thinks he can cut him down with this much power, Aizen states he does not have to cut him down, for he already has. Before an enraged Yamamoto can react, Aizen appears behind him. As Yamamoto turns to face him, Aizen stabs him through his stomach with his Zanpakutō. Grabbing Aizen's arm, Yamamoto, pulling him in closer, proclaims he has caught him. When Aizen tries to trick him into questioning whether or not he has caught the real Aizen, Yamamoto, calling his bluff, states if he only relied on his eyes or skin, he would say yes, but he instead only needs to rely on sensing the Reiatsu of Aizen's Zanpakutō, which is impaled into his stomach. Revealing he has laid a trap for Aizen, Yamamoto initiates his

Noting he would use his subordinates to set such a trap, Aizen expresses admiration at his cunning. Stating he plans to die with Aizen in the flames, he tells Ichigo to get back, for he is not part of the Gotei 13 and he should not have to endure their fate. When Aizen asks if he would really risk killing the other combatants to try and destroy him, Yamamoto states they are all prepared to die to destroy evil, which is the true spirit of the Gotei 13. A released Wonderweiss appears behind Yamamoto, who, sensing his presence,

Stating there has not been a

Stating if he cannot break one bone, he will result to tactics which bring more pain, he removes his top.

        As Wonderweiss moves to attack, Yamamoto, dodging, asks Wonderweiss if he is unable to adapt and learn, or if all he is capable of is regeneration. When an arm, extending itself from out of the back of Wonderweiss' shoulder, tries to attack him, Yamamoto, grabbing it, tears it off. As Wonderweiss screams, other arms, appearing from his shoulders, attack Yamamoto with an onslaught of punches. As he grabs Yamamoto's arms, the tops of his shoulders explode, revealing a multitude of arms, which pummel Yamamoto with an even greater magnitude of blows. Once he has stopped, an unfazed Yamamoto, asking him if this is all he has got, rips off Wonderweiss' arms. Telling him if this is all, he is glad the Arrancar is no longer in child form, for he is not going to hold back and will blast him to death, Yamamoto uses

        As the blow utterly destroys Wonderweiss, the screaming Arrancar shatters. When Yamamoto laments Wonderweiss' existence as pathetic and inhuman, Aizen, questioning his words, notes the very nature of being a Hollow means they, as creatures, serve no purpose and only exist to devour souls, and he gave them a purpose. When he tells Yamamoto the only inhuman one is him, for he just crushed a soul with purpose, Yamamoto states he has no intention of entering into a pointless argument with the likes of him, for it will all soon be over. Telling him he makes light of his words, Aizen states he should remember his previous words: Wonderweiss' Resurrección,

        . Stating sealing the blade makes it impossible for it to create new flames, Aizen asks what happens to flames already produced, for Yamamoto had flames already in effect before Wonderweiss showed up. As he asks him where those flames were sealed, Yamamoto realizes those flames are sealed in Wonderweiss' body, and since he is dead, they will explode. As Yamamoto jumps on the body, it erupts in a large area, destroying buildings around it. Aizen approaches as the flames subside to reveal Yamamoto, who has been injured by the explosion. Aizen states he is truly worthy of the title of Captain-Commander, having reduced the damage of such a large explosion, and had he not suppressed the explosion with his body, the flames would have vaporized the barrier around the Fake Karakura Town, and an area greater than the size of the town would have been turned to ashes. Thanking Yamamoto for protecting his world, he, moving close to him, unsheathes his Zanpakutō, telling him he cannot afford to spare his life as he did with the other shinigami he subdued, for Yamamoto is the history of Soul Society, so at the very least, he must finish him off with his own blade. Grabbing Aizen by the ankle, he, telling him to not make him say it again, calls Aizen naive.
        Yamamoto takes advantage of the damage inflicted by Wonderweiss' explosion to use his own charred body as a catalyst for the sacrificial spell,

        Ten days after Aizen's defeat and subsequent capture, Yamamoto returns to Soul Society, where his injuries are healed, save for his lost left arm. He is furious to learn that not only did Captains Shunsui, Byakuya, and Kenpachi lose their respective captain haori, but that they care very little about it. He proceeds to scold the three for their lack of care for the symbol of their station.

Later, while receiving treatment from Unohana, he asks Renji about the situation. Stating they have lost contact with the other captains, Renji, saying it is hard to believe the captains were defeated so easily, suggests the signal Urahara had received may have been incomplete. Telling the lieutenant there is no need to comfort him, Yamamoto points out the only battle-ready people are the lieutenants and Ichigo's group in the

Stating this is due to the power balance between Soul Society and the Human World being disrupted, Yamamoto tells Renji protecting the Human World from Hollows is important, but they must not give

Though Yamamoto insists everyone stay back, Nozomi, determined to not let anyone else get hurt because of her, charges forward to fight the Reigai, prompting Ichigo to back her up. While Yamamoto watches and is annoyed at their reckless behavior, Reigai-Unohana, appearing, ensnares Yamamoto with multiple high-level

After a brief skirmish, Ichigo warns the captain of Inaba's Shikai, prompting Yamamoto to state he is already aware of it. While thinking of how to handle Inaba, Nozomi offers to be a distraction, allowing for an opening to attack. Before she attacks, Yamamoto secretly gives some of his Reiatsu to Nozomi's Shikai. She attacks Inaba, who dodges her attacks. Finding the opening he needs, Yamamoto attacks with a powerful fire blast. As Inaba, seeing it, reacts, Ichigo launches an attack of his own. As the explosion settles, Inaba, emerging unharmed, reveals since he could not negate and copy their attacks at the same time, he instead copied Nozomi's absorption power and used it to counter Yamamoto and Ichigo's attack. When Inaba unleashes all the collected energy against Yamamoto, Nozomi, appearing in front of Yamamoto, attempts to absorb the blast.

Stating his pride will not allow him to be saved by a child, Yamamoto collapses. Later, Inaba emerges, hurt, but still able to fight. As he attempts to take Nozomi, Yamamoto, regaining consciousness, launches a fire blast at him, giving Nozomi a chance to retreat. Inaba goes after her, but Yamamoto is too weak to follow.

        Bisected from his shoulder to his waist, a dying Yamamoto falls down. As Yhwach, berating him, attempts to walk away, Yamamoto grabs hold of him. Cutting off his arm, Yhwach, calling Yamamoto foolish, explains why he never listed him as one of the war potentials. He says that Yamamoto had gotten weak over time, and that he was only truly a threat 1,000 years ago. He states Soul Society will die soon, but that Yamamoto never understood that the Gotei 13 died 1,000 years ago along with the Quincy. Unleashing an onslaught of

    Master Swordsman
   </b>
   : As the founder of the Shin'ō Academy and a warrior with over two millennia of combat experience, Yamamoto is the most powerful swordsman in Soul Society.
   Few would hope to come out alive from a fight with him. Yamamoto fought two of the strongest captain-level Shinigami in history, Shunsui Kyōraku and Jūshirō Ukitake, simultaneously and emerged without any sign of injury.
   His skill in swordsmanship is great enough to take down his opponent with a single precise strike.

    Master Strategist &amp; Tactician
   </b>
   : With his millennia of experience as a teacher and warrior, along with being the commander of the entire Gotei 13, Yamamoto is a very intelligent man. He can quickly adjust to new developments and make quick decisions accordingly. He has great tactical acumen, proven by his preparations for the battle in the Fake Karakura Town. As noted by Aizen, Yamamoto is very cunning, setting up a trap to kill him while Aizen was focused on the Visored and the rest of the Gotei 13.
   He is a very perceptive man, easily deducing Captain
   Mayuri Kurotsuchi
   was hiding knowledge on the Bounts.
   His skill at battle tactics is undeniable: as captain-commander, he commonly sends the captains and divisions out to engage in battle, be it to relatively small or large threats, and has done so for a number of centuries.

    Immeasurable Spiritual Power
   </b>
   : Being the most experienced Shinigami, Yamamoto possesses an extremely massive and powerful Reiryoku. Its sheer strength is powerful enough to effortlessly break free from four overlapping and high-level Bakudō spells restraining him.
   Even Aizen openly acknowledges Yamamoto's power (via his Zanpakutō) as being so superior that if he were to fight directly against it, it would overpower him.
   Yamamoto has served as the Captain-Commander of the Gotei 13 for over 1,000 years because there has not been a Shinigami stronger than him in all this time.

     Masterful Reiatsu Control
    </b>
    : Yamamoto can exert his Reiatsu to induce fear in captain-level combatants, and can physically paralyze and possibly even choke combatants of lieutenant-level and lower simply by gazing in their direction.
    Yamamoto's spiritual pressure has the same effect as his Zanpakutō, for it is the elemental representative of fire. He tends to glow with a fiery aura,
    which has the potential to burn and set his surroundings on fire without the use of his Zanpakutō. It is the formidable pressure of his Reiatsu which makes the Reiatsu itself look like flames.
    When Yamamoto is enraged, his Reiatsu is powerful enough to be felt all around Seireitei with tremendous force.

   : In addition to his surprisingly muscular physique for his age, Yamamoto possesses tremendous physical strength. He easily and swiftly put a large hole into the chest of the monster
   Ayon
   without much effort at all, using only the blunt end of his cane. With a single hand, he stopped one of Ayon's strikes and overpowered it, despite it having enlarged its arm and increased its strength several folds.
   With one punch, he put a large hole through the chest of
   Wonderweiss Margela
   while he was in
   Resurrección
   and sent him flying back several city blocks.
   He tore off Wonderweiss' arms, with his bare hands, with little to no effort.
   With a single double-fisted strike, he shattered Wonderweiss' entire body into pieces.

    Immense Durability
   </b>
   : Yamamoto possesses remarkable durability. He took an onslaught of punches from Wonderweiss' multiple arms twice, and came out completely unfazed by the assault, with no more than simple scratches.
   He sustained an explosion of flames which had the power to incinerate all of Karakura Town and a great area around it.
   In his younger years, he challenged Chōjirō to defeat him with his newly achieved Bankai, and in the end only suffered a light scar on his forehead.
   2000 years later, he would take on a barrage of powerful lightning strikes from Chōjirō's fully-mastered Bankai and only be singed by its power, though he stated it became weaker from

    Immense Endurance
   </b>
   : Despite his old age, Yamamoto can fight for extended periods of time, even when outnumbered, with no visible signs of exhaustion. He can take direct attacks from others unfazed. He can endure being impaled on a sword without so much as flinching from the perceived damage, even when the blow is dealt by the likes of Aizen, a powerful opponent.
   Even after being bifurcated by
