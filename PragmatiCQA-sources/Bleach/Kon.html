   Kon occupies the body of a small stuffed lion for most of the time. The doll has a light tan body with seams running up and down the entire thing. The arms and legs each have four white, flat claws which serve as his fingers and toes. A button is placed in the center of the body where his belly button would be. He has two beady black eyes and small ears with pink inside of them. His head is surprisingly flat when viewed from the side and he has a brown, spiky mane atop his head. Hanging from his lower back is a small tail.

   Kon has strong views on the
   sanctity of life
   . Because he spent many years in the form of a pill, fearful that one day he would be discovered and disposed of, Kon has developed a moral stance that prevents him from killing anything. He will also risk his own life in order to save even the lowliest of creatures,
   and is angered to see people who belittle their creations and dispose of them off-hand.

     The next morning, Kon wakes to find that the girl is missing. He races down to the living room, and finds her watching television. Kon tells her not to leave the confines of the room, as there is no telling what the family will do. Later, Kon opens the door at the Kurosaki Clinic to find

     Nozomi Kujō

     After Nozomi temporarily incapacitates the two Shinigami, Kon meets up with her at an abandoned facility, but is quickly subdued with Inaba's Kidō. Kon watches helplessly as Inaba strikes Nozomi in the gut with his cane.
     However, Uryū comes to their defense. When he asks Kon whether Ichigo allowed him to walk out on his own, Kon replies that Ichigo is not his master. After Uryū is cut down by Inaba, he states that he will eliminate Kon, who is just a mere Mod-Soul. Kon tries to free himself, but Uryū staggers up, distracting Inaba. Kon then watches as Inaba declares that he will take over the Human World as well as Soul Society, once Nozomi is in his possession.

     The next day, as Nozomi recovers from her ordeal, Kon asks her why Inaba was so interested in her. As they engage in a heated argument, Ichigo tells him to let it go. Kon later arrives at a welcoming barbecue for Nozomi at the Urahara Shop. Kon goes over to talk to her, but after a while Nozomi wanders off. Kon finds her walking by the riverbed and questions her motives behind this, which she ignores. Rangiku Matsumoto then appears before him, telling him that she will sort things out with her. After he leaves them, Kon encounters the real Rangiku. Not realizing this, he asks her where Nozomi went, but is told that she hasn't seen her all day. Realizing what happened, Kon runs back to Nozomi's location. As the impostor of Rangiku prepares to attack her, Kon and the others intervene. As they regroup back at the Urahara Shop, Kon is glad that Nozomi is okay, gratefully handing her a skewer of meat.

     The next day, Ichigo finds Kon tied up inside his closet.
     He tracks Nozomi down as the others search as well demanding to know why she keeps running away before she slams him into a tree. Nozomi reveals that she has to go somewhere, but doesn't know where. She also informs Kon that coming to Karakura Town is part of her plan to save Ichigo.
     At the Urahara Shop, Ichigo asks Urahara to send him to Soul Society. Kon protests, saying that if he were to leave, there would be no one left to protect them. He tries to get him to stop, but Nozomi helps Ichigo by healing his Reiatsu. Kon tries once more to stop him and asks the others for help, but Uryū tells him it would not matter as Ichigo is stubborn. Giving up, Kon makes him promise that he will return safely.

     Kon then goes to sit with the others as Urahara gathers information on Soul Society's situation. As Uryū looks over at Nozomi, Kon yells at him and Uryū grabs him, taking him outside to talk. Uryū asks Kon if he noticed anything strange about Nozomi because Inaba is after her. Uryū reflects on the conclusion the others came to: that something is hidden within Nozomi. He wonders what could be hidden within her. He voices this to Kon, but he just imagines her naked and gets embarrassed. He asks Uryū why he asked and he says it is obvious that Kon likes her. Kon tries to say he does not and leaves Uryū, heading inside. As he enters, Nozomi crushes him in the door. He asks why and Nozomi says just because.

     Urahara tells everyone that Ichigo has disappeared, and Nozomi blames herself, though Kon reassures Nozomi, stating that it would take a lot more than this to kill Ichigo. She remains silent, which Kon interprets as a sign that she doesn't trust what he says. Kon then tells Nozomi to trust him and wait patiently, prompting her to stare unnervingly at him. Nozomi asks him why he has so much faith in Ichigo, stating that the two of them are always arguing. Kon starts to blush, instantly denying that he ever had faith in Ichigo's abilities.
     When Urahara reports that he still cannot locate Ichigo, Kon tries to cheer everyone up, but Rukia stops him.
     As Ichigo awakens back at the Urahara Shop, Kon sits with the others at his side. When Urahara explains that Inaba was after Mod-Soul data in the Dangai, Orihime asks what a Mod-Soul is and Kon tries to explain before Rukia takes over. Ichigo tells Rukia that she is ruining things with her drawings, but Kon tells her to continue. After Nozomi reveals that Inaba created Mod-Souls, Kon curses him and can't believe that Inaba created him, but Nozomi says he didn't, when questioned, she reveals to everyone that she was the first Mod-Soul.

     When Ichigo goes to fight a Hollow, he places Kon in his body. Outside the Kurosaki Clinic, Kon is spotted by Sado and Orihime, who ask if Nozomi is home. Kon tells them that she is probably bored and asks them to keep her company before walking off. Kon walks through Karakura Town, recalling Nozomi's revelation that she is a Modified Soul. As he wonders what he can say to her now, he is given a lion charm as a promotional offer, but its mane comes apart. Kon goes to throw it away, but stops, commenting that if it is not going to be made correctly, then it should not have been made in the first place. He returns home to find Ichigo waiting impatiently for him in his Shinigami form. He asks him to swap back to their normal bodies. Kon watches Nozomi and Orihime cooking before walking off without changing forms. Later, Nozomi walks into Ichigo's room, where Kon is sitting. The two struggle to say anything to each other. Later, a much more energetic Kon, in Ichigo's body, has dinner with Nozomi and the others. He compliments Orihime on her cooking and urges the others to eat all of their meal, before misspeaking to Nozomi.

Kon finds her being attacked by a Hollow and urges her to hurry up as the Hollow attacks. Nozomi's Zanpakutō appears and she fights the Hollow in Shinigami form , quickly dispatching it. Kon reminds her that she said she did not have a Zanpakutō and asks why she was outside. She says that she is a burden, but Kon tells her not to let them being Mod-Souls stop them from living. Kon then gives Nozomi his defective lion charm as a gift, which she ties to her sheath.

Nozomi agrees, agitating Kon, who claims that it is going overboard. She dismisses his concerns and continues fighting. Eventually the constant pressuring on Nozomi allows her to awaken her Shikai, who then rushes off to aid the Shinigami battling.
     Eventually, the Reigai's collective strength proves too great for the Shinigami, forcing everyone to rely on Nozomi and her energy-absorbing Shikai. They fire their attacks at her, and she in turn launches the energy at the Reigai to defeat them. Kon, seeing the display, runs to Nozomi to congratulate her. However, his praise is premature as the Reigai-Byakuya emerges, having saved himself with the "

This greatly angers Kon, who openly states his disapproval of Yamamoto's treatment to Nozomi. Before they can talk further, the Reigai of Shunsui Kyōraku and Jūshirō Ukitake appear. Ichigo and Nozomi quickly fight them. Kon notices how weak Ichigo has become and is worried about him facing such powerful enemies. Before the fight can conclude, Kagerōza appears and tells the Reigai to retreat while he takes over. Ichigo and Nozomi are then joined by Yamamoto, but Kagerōza also copies Nozomi's energy-absorbing ability and finally overtaxes Ichigo. Kagerōza then launches an attack from the accumulated energy on Yamamoto, only for Nozomi to appear in front of the blast and greatly worrying Kon.

Yamamoto intervenes, but he is greatly injured while Kagerōza is battered but still able to fight. Despite his current body, Kon resolves to fight with Ichigo, Rukia and Renji to stop Kagerōza. Kagerōza begins to laugh at how they act like they understand Nozomi, which Kon finds annoying at how easily amused Kagerōza is. Kagerōza explains that he and Nozomi are in fact created from the same Reiatsu of a Shinigami, but split into two. Kon asks Nozomi if this is true, which she doesn't respond to, but instead looks away with guilty demeanor. Ichigo and the others attack Kagerōza, but are quickly defeated. Kon then latches himself onto Kagerōza, trying to give Nozomi a chance to escape, only to get beaten off and stomped on until his pill form is pushed out of his stuffed toy body.

Seeing his pain, Ichigo tries to comfort Kon and insists that he is not powerless. As Ichigo prepares to enter the Dangai with a Reishi-collector, Kon gives Ichigo Nozomi's lion charm for good luck. Once Ichigo finds the Kōtotsu and is swallowed, communication is momentarily cut off, causing Kon to panic for Ichigo's safety. Soon after though, communication is restored and Ichigo tells Kon to be quiet. Ichigo ultimately succeeds in collecting his Reishi and upon returning, he thanks Kon for his help. While Kon is confused, Ichigo explains how he almost lost the Reishi-collector, but narrowly got it back thanks to the charm Kon gave him. While happy that he was able to help, Kon instead acts indifferent.

     Later, as Ichigo and Kisuke prepare to go to Soul Society, Kon insists on joining them as he wants to help save Nozomi. While knowing he may not be much help in his stuffed lion body, he is surprised that Ichigo agrees on letting Kon join as he has a personal involvement in this as well. Showing his support, Ichigo gives Kon back Nozomi's charm for good looks. Kon joins Ichigo and Kisuke through the natural Dangai Nozomi had previously attempted to use. Upon arriving in Soul Society, they sneak into the
     Shinigami Research and Development Institute
     and locate Inaba's lab. Using the Gikon technology, Kisuke begins rebuilding Ichigo's Reishi in the form of a Mod-Soul. However, the system self-destructs. Kon emerges from the explosion relatively unharmed except for a tear in his arm. Before the explosion, however, Ichigo swallowed the Mod-Soul and was able to restore his Reishi. However, the process was unstable and causes Ichigo's inner Hollow to begin raging out of control. Following Kisuke, Kon and Ichigo seek Inaba's backup data to stabilize Ichigo. They are cut off by several Reigai captains, but are then saved by the arrival of Yoruichi and the captains.

     Yoruichi and the captains engage the Reigai, allowing Kon and the others to escape. Along the way, Ichigo quickly becomes exhausted and affected by his Hollow again before finally fainting. After Ichigo awakes, Kisuke insists that he stay behind to be safe. While Ichigo initially refuses, Kon insists that he let him handle it. Accepting the request, Ichigo agrees and hands him the Reishi-collector. Kon then follows Kisuke back to the S.R.D.I. Once inside, Kisuke takes a quick look at the data before leaving for the library, not explaining himself. There, Kisuke again does a quick study and leave with no explanation, this time for the 10th Division headquarters. Tired of Kisuke's secrecy, Kon demands an explanation. Kisuke says that he came to the conclusion Nozomi and Inaba were originally a Mod-Soul created from the Reiatsu of the Mod-Soul creator, but split in two. Furthermore, unaltered data from the library showed a Shinigami from the 10th Division was transferred to the 12th Division. At the 10th Division headquarters, Kisuke and Kon discovered the identity of a man named
     Ōko Yushima
     who fits the time frame. Kisuke concludes that he was currently confined to the
     Nest of Maggots
     . There, they were confronted by two Reigai, one of which chases Kon around. With a well-timed maneuver, Kisuke quickly defeats the Reigai. They then find Yushima, who is in a comatose state.

Inside, Kon eventually finds the main lab and Nozomi submerged in a tub with pink fluid next to Inaba in the same state. Kon manages to wake her up by knocking on the glass, and she quickly tells him to leave before she is fused with Inaba. Nozomi explains that Yushima developed a great hatred for the Soul Society for denying his accomplishments and swore revenge. Inaba is the embodiment of Yushima's rage and ambition, while she represents his self-control. Because of how corrupt and deranged Yushima's mind has become, there is a good chance that Inaba's negative traits will overwhelm and erase Nozomi once they fuse together. However, Kon still refuses to leave, determined to save her. Seeing Kon's resolve, Nozomi finally admits that she sees Kon as a dear friend. As the merger process nears completion, Nozomi gains some of Inaba's memories. She then instructs Kon on how to operate the controls. Listening to her, Kon insert's Ichigo's collected Reishi and begins reforming it. However, the Reigai-

     Kon later awakens to find himself in the body of Reigai-Nemu thanks to Kisuke. After getting over being in a woman's body, Kisuke gives Kon a complete Mod-Soul pill of Ichigo's Reishi and tells him to give it to Ichigo. Taking advantage of the resurrected-Ōko Yushima calling earlier for medicine to stabilize his fusion body, Kon impersonates Reigai-Nemu long enough to get close to Ichigo. He then kicks Yushima away before bragging about his performance. Deeply disturbed by this sight, Rukia removes Kon from the Reigai and places him back on the stuffed toy. Kon then gives Ichigo his Reishi pill, restoring Ichigo's Shinigami powers. Proud to have kept his promise in helping Ichigo, Kon throws Ichigo the charm again for good luck. Yushima degrades Kon as a pathetic Mod-Soul, but Kon insists he is better than Yushima's puppet Mod-Souls. While forced again to simply watch, Kon is determined to save Nozomi from her loneliness and cheers Ichigo on as he actives his Bankai.

     While Ichigo manages to fight evenly against Yushima, Kon cannot stand doing nothing, insisting to the others that they can help Ichigo. While their group attacks are easily defeated by Yushima, it gives Ichigo an opening to land a powerful blow. Still wanting to save Nozomi, Uryū theorizes that if they destroy Yushima's "

Using this information, Ichigo strikes while Nozomi regains control over Yushima, but Yushima breaks free in time to block. After a final clash between Ichigo and Yushima, Ichigo ends the fight, causing the fusion to break down and restore Nozomi and Inaba. After Inaba dies and vanishes, Nozomi also begins to vanish. Kon is very sad about this, but Nozomi is alright because she wasn't alone thanks to her friends. She gives Kon a final hug and calls him a pervert one more time before completely vanishing.
     Later, Kon and the others prepare to return home. Before leaving, Ukitake arrives and offers Kon a small Shinigami badge as thanks, but Kon proudly turns it down, preferring the charm he got back from Nozomi.

     Right after I was born, Soul Society ordered the mod souls to be destroyed... and the day after I was born I was already chosen to die! Everyday while I was in that pill I was afraid. As I watched my friends disappear each day. Even after I got lucky and escaped the storage among other pills, I feared being discovered and killed. As I trembled in fear I would think... life isn't something that should be taken from others. I was born like this! I should at least have the right to live and die freely! Whether it's humans or insects... or even us... it's the same. That's why I won't... kill anything.
