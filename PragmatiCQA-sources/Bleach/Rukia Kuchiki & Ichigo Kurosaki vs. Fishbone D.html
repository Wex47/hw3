   Pulling out a sketchbook and marker, Rukia explains that there are two types of spirits in the world:

   , evil spirits that attack both the living and the dead to devour their souls, both of which she illustrates. When Rukia asks him if he has any questions so far, Ichigo sarcastically wonders why her drawings are so bad, prompting Rukia to draw a mustache on his face with her marker, to his horror, before continuing. Rukia details how Shinigami have two jobs: the first is to send Pluses to Soul Society with

   When Rukia confirms that there is a Hollow wandering around, Ichigo tells her to hurry up and get rid of it, only for Rukia to admit that she has not been able to sense it recently and theorizes that there is a powerful force obstructing her senses. However, having heard Fishbone D roar, Ichigo demands to know if she cannot hear the bloodcurdling howl and if this is not the Hollow she is after, prompting a confused Rukia to state that she does not know what Ichigo is talking about before stopping in shock as she suddenly hears Fishbone D's roar as well, which she identifies as definitely belonging to a Hollow.

   calls out to Ichigo and stumbles through the hall before falling in front of Ichigo's door. Reaching out to Ichigo, Karin reveals something attacked Yuzu and their father and tells Ichigo to run as she collapses. While kneeling down to check on Karin, Rukia confirms to Ichigo that she is alright and merely passed out, only to stop upon seeing Ichigo straining against his bonds.

   Despite Rukia's warning, a yelling Ichigo manages to shatter the spell restraining him. With Rukia left shocked by a Human like Ichigo breaking through a spell with his own power, Ichigo grabs a baseball bat and runs downstairs, where he finds his injured father lying in the damaged living room before seeing Fishbone D. As a frightened Ichigo admits that he thought it would look like a normal Human and attempts to calm himself down, he sees Yuzu in Fishbone D's hand, prompting him to run toward the Hollow while screaming in rage. However, Fishbone D merely punches Ichigo away, shattering his baseball bat in the process, before attacking him once more.

  <p key="e66834dc-85ec-42be-82cf-7cfcdd3e0cf5">
   Suddenly, Rukia appears and cuts into Fishbone D's arm, causing it to scream in pain as it drops Yuzu, whom Ichigo catches. As Ichigo calls out to Yuzu and asks her if she is okay, Rukia tells him to compose himself because Fishbone D has not yet devoured his sisters' souls, to his surprise. When Rukia notes that even his father has not yet had his soul devoured, Ichigo wonders why Fishbone D attacked his family if not to devour their souls, prompting Rukia to elaborate that Hollows are drawn to high levels of Reiryoku and attack opportunistically before bringing up Ichigo's feats of spiritual power as evidence that Fishbone D is actually after him.

  <p key="00acf88c-c01e-4e86-84c4-d0215842c51a">
   A stunned Ichigo asks if it is his fault that his family is lying on the ground bleeding, which Rukia tries to dissuade him from thinking, only to be punched away by Fishbone D from behind. As she crashes into a wall, Rukia chastises herself for not guarding her flank, only to be shocked upon seeing Ichigo standing in front of Fishbone D, whom he asks if he is after Ichigo's power before demanding that the Hollow fight him one-on-one. A roaring Fishbone D extends his neck to devour Ichigo, only for Rukia to intercept the attack with her body, damaging Fishbone D's mouth in the process. As Fishbone D rears back in pain, Rukia falls to her knees while blood trails behind her.

   Berating a shocked Ichigo for not realizing he would be no match for Fishbone D, Rukia asks if he thought everything would be over if he gave the Hollow his soul before stating that they will all become food for him at this point. As Fishbone D recovers and narrows his eyes, Rukia pulls herself to a nearby pole and asks Ichigo if he wants to save his family, which Ichigo immediately confirms before asking if there is a way to do so. Affirming this, Rukia leans against the pole and points her Zanpakutō at Ichigo before declaring he must become a Shinigami himself and detailing how Ichigo must run her Zanpakutō through his body so she can give him her powers.

   While Fishbone D continues to roar, Rukia admits that she does not know if this will work before asserting that there is nothing else they can do. As Fishbone D begins to walk toward them, Ichigo tells Rukia to give him her Zanpakutō and addresses her as a Shinigami, prompting Rukia to tell him her name. With Fishbone D charging toward them, Ichigo grabs Rukia's Zanpakutō by the blade and introduces himself in turn before pulling the blade into himself as Rukia pushes, resulting in a powerful surge of energy that releases waves of force in all directions. Pushing through the force, Fishbone D suddenly has his left arm cut off by Ichigo.

While Rukia states with disbelief that she has never met a Human with enough Reiryoku to confuse her senses, enough strength to break through a binding spell, and enough power to make a Zanpakutō as large as their own body, Ichigo cuts off Fishbone D's right leg and declares that he will pay for hurting his family before slashing through the Hollow's mask, causing Fishbone D to disintegrate.

   The following day, Ichigo wakes up in his bed and discovers he and his family are uninjured, while the damage to the
   Kurosaki Clinic
   is claimed by his father and sisters to be the result of a truck crashing through the wall. Believing Rukia went back to Soul Society, Ichigo is shocked when she appears at his school in the guise of a student and tells him that he must take up her Shinigami duties.
