   Muramasa is a tall, thin man with pale skin and shaggy, dark brown hair, two bangs of which cross over the bridge of his nose. His turquoise-colored eyes are circled by spiked purple ovals. He possesses long fingernails, but they were much shorter before his long separation from his master.
   Muramasa wears a long, white, robe-like coat. The collar of the robe is covered with a thick fur, featuring a purple
   ascot
   fastened by a ruby brooch. Muramasa wears a wide sash at his waist, decorated by a purple stripe. He wears boots with pointed tips, and has purple manacles on his wrists. His fingers make a clacking sound whenever he curls or uncurls them.

   , the countless Hollows which Muramasa absorbed converge and slowly tear him apart from the inside, gradually causing various physical effects to his being.
   In earlier stages, his eyes shed tears of blood,
   but later glass over, filled with blood completely.
   In more extreme cases, he becomes physically sick and weak, even becoming transparent at some points.

   He admits he did not intend to become so invested in a single Shinigami when he began his mission, and is fascinated by the bond between Ichigo and Zangetsu being the source of Ichigo's strength.
   He later claims he and Ichigo are linked to one another.

   to death for getting in his way. However, when Orihime points out how he is burdened with a great sadness, Muramasa momentarily lets his guard down, revealing how tired and sad he really is, though he almost immediately regains his composure and is angered by Orihime trying to understand him. He admits his only wish is to free Kōga.
  </p>
  <p key="f9810945-3b34-40e2-86dc-44e0e033aa7d">
   Before Kōga was sealed, Muramasa was very supportive of him, and would frequently encourage Kōga when he doubted himself or his power. He asserted their power came from their trust in each other, and would often remind Kōga of how powerful he was. When Kōga was arrested on false charges, Muramasa encouraged him to use his power to change the world in order to suit himself.
   Once Kōga obtained his revenge, Muramasa encouraged him to leave the past behind and create a better world. However, as Kōga slid further and further into madness, Muramasa began to question him and his actions, leading to their bond deteriorating over time. Despite this and Kōga's abusive actions toward him, Muramasa states he would have come to Kōga's aid had he heard his voice, which he was unable to hear, and spent years working toward freeing him.
   Even after Kōga betrays him and tries to kill him, Muramasa is still willing to fight for Kōga. It is only when Kōga snaps his sealed Zanpakutō in two and proclaims he does not need him that Muramasa finally loses control and allows his despair to overwhelm him.
  </p>
  <p key="721329a8-bc8d-4822-ba17-2ab6c264572b">
   Rukia notes Muramasa put his very existence at risk for Kōga's sake by absorbing so many Hollows. However, Muramasa is strong-willed enough to fight the Hollows within him and momentarily regain control of his body after transforming into a Hollow hybrid in order to maintain his Zanpakutō identity, which he takes great pride in.
   Even after Kōga dies, Muramasa continues to fight Ichigo within Kōga's inner world in order to absorb Ichigo's power and nourish himself with it. He eventually reveals he is still fighting because he was incredibly proud of Kōga and his power, and because he wanted Kōga to appreciate him at least once. However, Muramasa admits his goal of having Kōga appreciate him was hard to attain and would not have lasted for very long had he achieved it. Eventually, Muramasa realizes he can hear Ichigo's voice, and considers it ironic that he can do so. After being defeated, Muramasa finally experiences the happiness of having someone truly connect with and understand him.

When Muramasa finally succumbs to the Hollows, Ichigo engages and seemingly defeats him.

Knowing he has a limited amount of time until the Hollows which he absorbed destroy this world, Muramasa decides to finish his fight with Ichigo. When Ichigo points out how there is no point for Muramasa to fight him because Kōga is gone, Muramasa merely states he will continue to fight for as long as possible. Muramasa uses his

   Eventually, Ichigo notes Muramasa is so bitter because he was deprived for so long of the simple desire to communicate with Kōga. While Muramasa refuses to listen, Ichigo states Muramasa's true goal has always been to make  Kōga appreciate him at least once. When Muramasa admits it was a lofty goal, Ichigo insists he not let Kōga's views on him control his life. Afterward, Muramasa and Ichigo clash for the final time. Falling into the ocean, Muramasa is surprised by Ichigo diving in to save him and take them both out of the structure safely. Outside, Muramasa admits to his mistakes, prompting Ichigo to tell him he can make up for it. Apologizing for the harm which he caused, Muramasa fades away, happy to have finally found someone who was willing to connect with him.

    : Muramasa can create invisible spiritual threads with hands on their ends, which he can manipulate to bind and immobilize his target.
    He can also use these threads to strangle his opponent.
    While invisible to the naked eye, these threads can be seen in reflections, such as those of windows or water. If the reflection is distorted, the threads will disappear.
    Additionally, the threads will dissipate if Muramasa loses his focus on his target, as demonstrated when they disappeared due to him coughing violently.

    Additionally, they cannot affect a target if they are blocked by another force, such as Orihime's

    Zanpakutō Spirit Manifestation

   : Muramasa can enter the inner world of a Shinigami and bend their Zanpakutō Spirit to his will. This is done by removing the energy stability between a Shinigami and their Zanpakutō Spirit, who is left confused and has its negative emotions forcibly released by Muramasa.
   A manifested spirit of a weaker Shinigami is typically a tangible, shadowy figure,
   but manifests with greater individuality and power from stronger Shinigami.
   Initially, a Shinigami whose Zanpakutō Spirit has been manifested is left unable to release their

   though they can overcome this by strengthening their resolve.
   However, as long as their Zanpakutō Spirit is manifested and under the influence of Muramasa's brainwashing, a Shinigami cannot perform

   until their Zanpakutō Spirit returns to them.
   The only way for a manifested Zanpakutō Spirit to be freed from Muramasa's brainwashing and return to its Shinigami is for its owner to defeat it.
   However, if someone other than the manifested Zanpakutō Spirit's owner defeats them, they will revert to their sword form, which will snap in two afterward, and remain unable to manifest, effectively dying,

   Yamamoto likens this power to a tapeworm.

     Methods

    : Though he can manifest several Zanpakutō Spirits at once by emitting purple energy from his eyes, which causes nearby Zanpakutō to glow blue and release their spirits,
    Muramasa can also personally draw out a Zanpakutō Spirit from a Shinigami by reaching into their chest and pulling out a thread of their Reiatsu while speaking directly to the Zanpakutō Spirit in question, after which the Zanpakutō Spirit will manifest in the real world. This process will cause a Shinigami wielding their Bankai to instantly revert to their Shikai.
    Additionally, while inside the inner world of a Shinigami, Muramasa can draw out their Zanpakutō Spirit by trapping the Shinigami within an illusion in which they see Muramasa's

    extending from a hole in their chest. When the Shinigami's resolve breaks from the perceived pain of this illusion, their Zanpakutō Spirit will manifest within their inner world while wearing a black cloak, which crumbles away. After this, Muramasa can proceed with brainwashing the Zanpakutō Spirit.
    The latter two methods are both very painful to the Shinigami in question.

   However, Muramasa notes his body is not accustomed to absorbing Hollows with large amounts of Reiryoku, such as

      "Zanpakutō spirits are individual souls that are born within the hearts of Shinigami. They draw their power from the same source as their Shinigami, and are intertwined with their master's soul. Shinigami must reach deep into their own selves in order to find the power hidden within. They commune with their Zanpakutō spirit, bond together, and harness their power by learning their names. What's more, a few chosen Shinigami can gain even more power by manifesting an incarnation of their Zanpakutō spirit and controlling it. They wield the mighty Bankai. You and the captains have done this. But, living alongside Shinigami is not the only way for a Zanpakutō spirit to exist. I'm saying that every Zanpakutō spirit has free will, just like you do. Zanpakutō spirits are not dependent on Shinigami. We are separate entities. Two distinct beings, no one greater than the other. Is that so hard to believe? More proof of how arrogant you Shinigami are. Your blindness is why I'm here."
