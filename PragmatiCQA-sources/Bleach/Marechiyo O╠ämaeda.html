   Ōmaeda is a large man (almost twice the height of his captain, and just over four times her weight). He claims that he is

  </h2>
  <p key="022822e9-d7f5-4eac-ae6a-310cd71805c1">
   Ōmaeda is an arrogant and dull man. He is cowardly, loud, vain, elitist, snobbish, greedy and sluggish. However, he is exceedingly loyal to his captain to the point that he is willing to fight along with his captain against enemies much stronger than himself. His willingness to take an attack aimed at his captain, act as a temporary decoy and cut off Suì-Fēng's arm at her request shows that Marechiyo holds a great deal of loyalty to her. Despite his arrogance, Ōmaeda is deceptively sharp in combat enough to catch his opponents off-guard. Ōmaeda likes to eat fried rice crackers (Abura senbei) wherever he is and his captain is known to beat him up when the crumbs from the crackers fall on her hair. However, he does not like fish.
  </p>
  <p key="220ee0cb-1d24-4f3a-9ec6-62d59b058566">
   Marechiyo comes from a rich family. His father is named
   Marenoshin
   , his mother is Mareka, his older sister is Maremi, his younger brother is Marejirōsaburō, and his younger sister is Mareyo. With the exception of Marechiyo's younger sister, all the other family members closely resemble him. Mareyo is more normal looking and sweet, which shocks

  <p key="d1303a21-b0ea-4984-bd37-5c523a91d8fa">
   Marechiyo's specialty is making bracelets, as he can craft gold. All the jewels he wears are made by himself. He owns a factory named "Ōmaeda Gem-Precious Metals Factory", which makes jewelry. He fires any slacking workers with his yet unknown ability, the "Marechiyo Chop".
   Being rich, he was able to install the 2nd Division quarters with floor heating, automatic doors and cooling and heating systems.

   Despite his arrogance and cowardly front, he can be motivated to action and do his duty if his siblings are in distress.
   He is very protective of his family, and will become enraged if they are attacked.

Ōmaeda denotes that he understands, before Suì-Fēng promptly tells him that the same goes for him as well.

Ōmaeda asks what kind of subordinate he would be if he didn't look after his captain if she is being defeated. He then resolves that they should fight Ggio together, Suì-Fēng dismisses the idea calling him a disgrace and goes back to fighting.
   Ōmaeda takes note that Ggio looks as though he is keeping up with her and wonders if they are truly evenly matched.
   He realizes that he should make an attempt to help, but realizes that Suì-Fēng would not welcome it so he decides to allow the battle to play out as it will, he is then surprise attacked by Nirgge once again. Ōmaeda goes flying into a nearby building causing it to fall down on top of him. Nirgge gloats saying Ōmaeda got what he deserved, but is surprised when Ōmaeda frees himself from the rubble with only a few scratches on him.

He then is caught up in paying too much attention to Suì-Fēng's fight with Ggio instead of his own, allowing Nirgge to wrap his trunk around his ankle and throw him around into nearby structures. Ōmaeda once again decides to help Suì-Fēng, but realizes that first he must take out Nirgge, or risk getting attacked from behind. Nirgge begins to power up a

   Suì-Fēng then tells him that his opponent is still alive as Nirgge begins to get up again. She then tells Ōmaeda to go and finish the Arrancar and then come and join her. Ōmaeda runs from an enraged Nirgge who continues to attack from a distance, Ōmaeda realizes he can't get close, but he trips and falls. When Nirgge proceeds to land a devastating blow, Ōmaeda uses Shunpo and gets away, he appears up above the Arrancar once again. Ōmaeda states that he now understands Suì-Fēng's words, but takes it even further by addressing that opportunity doesn't only come when an ally falls, but also when one is in a desperate situation. He then sends his Shikai flying down to crush Nirgge once and for all.

Believing that Suì-Fēng is holding back because of the captain's seal, he begins bragging, but Suì-Fēng explains that the seal has not been placed on the captains this time and she is fighting at full power. Ōmaeda is shocked by this revelation.
   Baraggan then takes out his Zanpakutō and begins to swing it at Ōmaeda and Suì-Fēng, who dodge the attack. Suì-Fēng tries to attack him with a kick, but he grabs her leg and throws her into a nearby building, causing Ōmaeda to scream out to her. Suì-Fēng tells him that she is fine and not to worry about it. Ōmaeda listens as Baraggan explains how he is able to counter the two and how the Espada represent the aspects of death.

As they can't get near him, much less touch him, Ōmaeda wonders how they can defeat him if they can't even attack him, but then he realizes the situation is worse than that, seeing that if he could get Suì-Fēng then no one can escape his attacks. Suì-Fēng then calls him to get his attention, she proceeds to tell him that she needs him to act as a decoy. Ōmaeda is somewhat confused, but Suì-Fēng assures him that all he has to do is keep him busy for a while as she has a plan. Ōmaeda becomes increasingly nervous and afraid stating to do anything would be impossible and no plan would work, as their only solution is to get away. Suì-Fēng tells him plainly to just make sure that he keeps his right arm, as he has to be able to cut of any parts that get turned to bone, she then leaves. Baraggan then rushes at him, prompting Ōmaeda to run for his life so Suì-Fēng can execute her plan.

When the pieces of rock disintegrate without even touching Baraggan, Ōmaeda almost gives up, realizing how useless fighting him is and becomes frustrated that his Zanpakutō can't use fire or ice or some form of Kidō. Then he gets the idea that he can use Kidō as it most likely will get the better of Baraggan. Ōmaeda turns and gets ready to take the offensive, but then he recalls he's not really good at Kidō and decides to simply use Bakudō #21.

Coming to the conclusion that this was all the power his opponent had, Baraggan calls forth his "Gran Caída" and seems to be closing in on Ōmaeda to finish him off with the technique. Baraggan then notices the surge of energy from Suì-Fēng's Bankai being released and turns around to face her. Ōmaeda is surprised to see Suì-Fēng's Bankai as he himself has never seen it. He comments on its shape and wonders how she can fight with it. He then notices she has wrapped a Ginjōhan around her waist, wondering why she would use that as it decreases mobility. Ōmaeda then witnesses her explanation on why she doesn't use her Bankai and the explosion following its use against Baraggan.

     reporting on the situation in Soul Society. Marechiyo asks if they really think the captains are dead, provoking an angry response from Ikkaku. When he asks where they are if they are not dead, Ikkaku threatens to kill him. Later, when the Reigai of Kenpachi Zaraki breaks out of Urahara's trap and arrives in the Human World, Marechiyo and the other lieutenants arrive to help Ikkaku fight him. However, Ikkaku dismisses then, saying that they have their own opponents. When more Reigai arrive, Marechiyo leaves to fight the new arrivals.
     He ends up fighting the Reigai-Byakuya. Despite his effort, the captain Reigai easily proves to be too powerful. After he begs and attempts to bribe the Reigai, Marechiyo is struck down by Reigai-Byakuya.

   Later Marechiyo bears witness to the swift and complete invasion of Soul Society by the Wandenreich.
   While Ōmaeda wonders what has just happened, he admits to himself that he is scared and curses the fact that it happened while his captain is away. His sister pleads with him to stay, but he explains to her that he has to go so that he can protect them, as is the duty of a member of the Gotei 13. However, before he can leave he is confronted by the same Sternritter that took Captain Suì-Fēng's Bankai,

BG9 asks its question again, threatening to do harm to the remainder of Ōmaeda's family. However, in an extreme rage, Ōmaeda instead attacks the Sternritter, demanding it to let her go. BG9 simply ignores his attacks and takes out a mini-gun. Ōmaeda curses his bad luck, but eventually Suì-Fēng rescues him, destroying part of the mini-gun.

   Ōmaeda retrieves his captain's body from BG9 and gives her the Shin'eiyaku, telling her that it should enable her to use her Bankai again, despite him not fully understanding Urahara's explanation. Following Suì-Fēng's orders, Ōmaeda holds her steady as she fires her Bankai at BG9, defeating the Quincy.

Soon afterward, Renji and Rukia arrive and are startled to find Shinji there, prompting Marechiyo to explain how they survived Bazz-B's attack before being hit by Suì-Fēng for being too loud.
   After Kenpachi agrees to leave the search for his lieutenant to the rest of his division, Urahara gives Marechiyo a sphere to charge with his Reiatsu.
