   Kōga is a well-toned man with piercing green eyes, shoulder-length black hair, and a long ponytail of red hair, with bangs hanging on the right side of his face to frame it. When he was a member of the
   Gotei 13
   , he wore a standard Shinigami
   <i key="3468eb84-908d-4727-8e88-35458af578f9">

   </i>
   with the addition of a long red scarf, a light lavender obi sash, and a beaded necklace with a pendant. He also wore an intricate white headpiece called
   <i key="f33e124c-16ca-44e3-9fcc-6127074dafc9">
    kenseikan
   </i>
   , which symbolized his nobility, on the left side of his head to hold his ponytail in place with red tufts of hair sticking out, though he later cut it off to relinquish his status as a Kuchiki.

  <p key="9803607b-2208-473f-9c11-df4fcde4aa51">
   While originally his appearance was youthful and fit, after being sealed away for several hundred years, Kōga's physical form has been reduced to a withered and malnourished version of his former self. While he was imprisoned, he was adorned with a mouth mask and gauntlet-like shackles around his wrists. These remained on him after his jailbreak, but the mask was cut, with only the part on the bridge of his nose remained. While his scarf and necklace remain, his

   Originally, Kōga was a very headstrong man, willing to rush headlong into battle at any moment in order to turn the tide. He had a habit of referring to his father-in-law,
   <a href="Ginrei Kuchiki.html" key="a6de82aa-eddd-48a2-9545-00ff62084d09" title="Ginrei Kuchiki">
    Ginrei Kuchiki
   </a>
   , informally during battle, but was apologetic about it when Ginrei pointed it out. He was confident in his own power, and was confused by Ginrei reprimanding him for this, but was usually humble about his actions. Kōga believed strongly in his mission of achieving peace, and was willing to lay down his life in order to see his goal realized. He frequently went to
   Muramasa
   for counsel on his affairs. Deep down, Kōga wished for Ginrei to openly acknowledge his achievements, and was saddened and angered when he did not. Despite his pride, Kōga prioritized the pacification of Soul Society over recognition, as he reprimanded his comrades for their over-flattery and comments of their increasing fame. He also possessed enough self-control to listen to reason, surrendering to the
   <a href="Onmitsukidō.html" key="7fde5274-0061-44ed-ab19-4dd6b3f3efea" title="Onmitsukidō">
    Onmitsukidō
   </a>
   instead of fighting back when he was framed for murder. However, his overconfidence eventually led to Kōga being betrayed by allied officers, and his resulting imprisonment and announced punishment led Kōga to believe that Ginrei did not have faith in him. Kōga was convinced by Muramasa that he should use his power to change the world, but asserted that he was the master and would not be controlled by his
   Zanpakutō Spirit
   , marking the start of his downward spiral into madness.
  </p>
  <p key="62cd7ad9-fb57-4776-8b0f-46cc942209ca">
   After being freed from prison, Kōga is much more ruthless, mercilessly attacking and killing the conspirators who put him in jail. However, he still retained enough morality to give them the benefit of the doubt and believe they may have been misguided, though he was proven wrong upon finding them laughing at his imprisonment. Additionally, Kōga initially regrets his violent actions because he realizes it did not change anything, and is horrified to learn he can no longer prove his innocence before a tribunal. However, Kōga's conversation with Ginrei proves to be the tipping point for his sanity, and he begins to believe everyone hates him and is jealous of his power, leading to him renouncing his ties to the
   Kuchiki Clan
   by cutting off his
   <i key="01410cac-168f-4f57-8e26-4d615f861e0a">
    kenseikan
   </i>
   ; he even makes a baseless accusation of Ginrei creating a fake friendly front to get Kōga to drop his guard out of jealousy. Initially, Kōga only kills those who attack him on a principle of kill or be killed, but eventually begins slaughtering helpless

   denizens, which he justifies by claiming he is sending a message of hopelessness to

    Soul Society
   </a>
   . Additionally, Kōga's paranoia and hatred lead to his bond with Muramasa slowly degrading over time, which is further worsened when Kōga physically abuses him over a perceived insult, leading to Kōga being unable to release his Zanpakutō at all. Kōga comes to enjoy despair, and claims it unleashes his true power by making him realize there are no ideals in the world. He believes power maintains all order in the world, and asserts that his evil will become good if he is the most powerful. Kōga firmly believes a Zanpakutō is simply a tool for killing, and should not be treated on an equal level to its master, a belief which he follows when he attempts to kill Muramasa.
  </p>
  <p key="dbd7b06e-80b1-4503-b1b1-df61bb89b65f">
   Even after Muramasa frees him from his
   seal
   several hundred years later, Kōga is very disrespectful, making light of the event of Ginrei's death to his grandson,
   Byakuya Kuchiki
   , and frequently referring to Byakuya as "
   <i key="5e8af0e4-b528-428f-829b-2b71d3365114">
    youngster
   </i>
   ". He holds a particular grudge against the Kuchiki Clan, agreeing to fight Byakuya solely because he is the current Head of the Kuchiki Clan and claiming the clan is full of arrogance. Additionally, Kōga's own confidence grows to the point where he intentionally severs his bond with Muramasa because he believes his own power is enough to handle Byakuya. He believes Zanpakutō are simply tools for which there are countless replacements, and accused Muramasa of being too unstable to be of any use to him. Kōga is incredibly proud of his own power; he claims his illusions are more than simple illusions, and believes that he is the most powerful

   , participated in a battle between the loyalist and rebel factions of Soul Society, winning a decisive victory for the loyalist side by himself. For his performance, Kōga was given much praise and many accolades from Captain-Commander
   Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
   himself.
  </p>
  <p key="f9eb2506-0ab8-4269-b9e8-779c914862c5">
   Ginrei grew increasingly concerned about Kōga's overconfidence in his powers, and made a point to address how he needed to control himself. Kōga took this in stride, but could never understand why Ginrei never acknowledged any of his achievements. He would frequently speak to
   Muramasa
   about this, but Muramasa's reassurance only increased his overconfidence. As he engaged in battle after battle, winning each one with ease, Kōga was given a special position by Yamamoto for his efforts, making him the captain of a special force directly under his authority that was completely dedicated to wiping out the remaining rebels.
  </p>
  <p key="b9484c32-5d6b-4d6e-8f1a-2ccaab84c510">
   When it became clear that Kōga might very well be the key to winning the war, three elites from a rival faction, who feared Kōga would take the glory away from them, came up with a plan to frame him as a traitor. They achieved this by having their own men attack Kōga, whom they knew would easily dispatch them, and then charging Kōga with murder and having him arrested. Ginrei arrived to see what happened, and remained skeptical when the elites framed Kōga based on the scene of the crime, but upon a fallen soldier's claim that Kōga killed them to show off, Ginrei had no choice but to allow Kōga's arrest until he could determine a way to clear his name. While Kōga tried to explain his side of the story, the
   Keigun
   ignored it and moved in to make the arrest, which led him attempting to retaliate. Ginrei immediately persuaded him to stand down for the moment and go quietly, which Kōga did reluctantly.

   Ginrei visited Kōga in jail, and detailed that his punishment had been handed down: Kōga was to be suspended from his seat in the 6th Division, and

   would be neutralized because its powers were too dangerous. Admitting he did not believe any of it, Ginrei revealed higher-ranking official had a problem with Kōga's Zanpakutō and its ability, and explained that they were not afraid of Kōga, but of Muramasa getting out of control. After Ginrei left him there to learn patience as he went to rectify the situation, Kōga was freed by Muramasa, who inspired him to take control of his life again.
  </p>

   That night, Kōga killed the elites who framed him. Upon hearing of this, Ginrei went in search of Kōga, and found him in the outskirts of Soul Society. When Ginrei confronted him about his actions, Kōga explained how he had hoped that deep down, the officials would regret their choice to frame him, but he had killed them when he found them laughing. Kōga admitted that even after killing them, he was still filled with anger for what they had done to him and the humiliation he had endured.
  </p>
  <p key="e7b87e8c-ea43-4316-a8c8-99633dd4de70">
   When Ginrei remarked that any chance at proving his innocence was gone and that his rash decisions now put him in line to be executed, Kōga suffered a breakdown and accused Ginrei of being like all the others and being jealous of him. Kōga decided to stage a personal revolt against Soul Society and all his enemies; before departing, he cut off his

   and rudely threw it back at Ginrei, severing his bond with the family. As he killed more people, Kōga's instability grew. When Muramasa noticed that Kōga's heart has become turbulent, he tried to tell Kōga to forget the past and focus on the future, but Kōga became too obsessed with the idea that everyone hated him and that he could not understand why.
  </p>
  <p key="cf869e17-d49a-4e20-b3bc-2ad46821778d">
   While fighting against a group of Shinigami, Kōga attempted to release

   and found there was no response, though Muramasa appeared when he tried again. Eventually, Kōga escalated to killing innocent civilians in

   . While Kōga sitting alone in a cave, Muramasa appeared and asked him why he would kill innocent bystanders, which prompted Kōga to claim he was teaching Soul Society a lesson for exiling him from their world. Soon, Kōga was even abusing Muramasa when he was anything less than absolutely obedient. This disharmony between them gradually caused Kōga to lose his ability to communicate with Muramasa, or even access his power.
  </p>
  <p key="6b7ad397-67ce-4180-8362-827dd83fc95b">
   Eventually, Yamamoto and Ginrei confronted Kōga, and after an exchange of words, they realized that they could not get through to him. They engaged in a minor battle, and Kōga tried to release Muramasa with no results. The two captains decided to take advantage of the situation, and
   sealed
   Kōga away when they realized he had lost total access to Muramasa's power.
   Kōga's revolt was never recorded in Soul Society's history.

   when he fights. He is powerful enough to clash evenly with both Ginrei and
   Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
   , who were the only ones with enough power to confront him at the time.
   Several centuries after being sealed away, Kōga still possesses a huge amount of Reiryoku, and managed to blow

   Kōga is powerful enough to fight evenly against and wound
   Byakuya Kuchiki
   , one of the most powerful captains of the
   Gotei 13
   and the strongest Head of the
   Kuchiki Clan
   to ever live, and nearly killed him at one point. Uniquely, because of his power, Kōga cannot be killed unless his attacker opens their heart to him; otherwise, he can only be sealed away.
   His Reiatsu is blue.
   Like Muramasa, Kōga can use his Reiryoku for two unique abilities, which he claims he gave to Muramasa:

     Spiritual Threads
    </b>
    : By pointing one of his halberds at his opponent, Kōga can create spiritual threads and manipulate them to immobilize his opponent. Though these spiritual threads are invisible to the naked eye, they can be seen in the shadows cast on nearby surfaces, and Kōga states they work by capturing his opponent's shadow instead of simply their reflection, preventing them from being easily destroyed by a reflection being distorted.

     Illusions

    : By sending his Reiryoku into his opponent, Kōga can confuse all five of their senses. This allows him to fake oncoming attacks, create clones of himself to avoid attacks, and make himself appear to be further away than he actually is in order to perform surprise attacks at close range. Kōga claims these are far more than illusions, which he considers "

    Enhanced Strength

   : Kōga possesses a considerable amount of physical strength. He sent four Shinigami flying back with a single slash of his sword,
   and sent Ginrei flying away with a single kick.
   Even in his physically withered state, Kōga is strong enough to shatter the remainder of his Zanpakutō with a single downward chop.

   ): Kōga's Zanpakutō takes the form of a normal katana with a dull red sheath, a purple hilt, and a guard consisting of a circle with a pentagon-like shape in the center and three evenly-spaced points protruding from the edges. Muramasa is an illusion-type Zanpakutō.
   As Kōga descended into insanity, his harmony with Muramasa deteriorated more and more, leading to him losing access to Muramasa's powers.
   Eventually, Kōga shattered the blade with his bare hand, permanently severing his bond with his Zanpakutō.

   Muramasa's ability works by intruding onto the opponent's heart. The only way to combat its power is by understanding how the Zanpakutō works and sealing one's heart against it. However, in addition to remaining able to fight in this state, one must have incredible Reiryoku and mental fortitude in order to block the attack itself.

    Deteriorating Bond:

   As Kōga suffered a mental breakdown, his bond with Muramasa weakened overtime, leading the Zanpakutō spirit unable to hear Kōga's calls. During one battle against a group of Shinigami sent to kill him, he had to call twice for Muramasa to appear. The bond between the two degraded further when Kōga started to directly abuse Muramasa, leading his voice to unable to reach him at all.
   Eventually, Kōga permanently severed his ties with Muramasa by breaking the sword, forever losing his Zanpakutō.
