   Haschwalth is a tall young man with a thin build and long blonde hair, which descends past his shoulders, and blonde eyelashes.
   His usual attire is a variation of the Sternritter's typical white uniform, consisting of the order's signature hooded-cloak, a calf-length trench coat (thigh length in the first attack on Soul Society
   ) commensurate of his rank with dark green fur running down from his left collar to the front of the coat, a green belt with a golden belt buckle,
   along with white trousers and shoes.
   When informing Yamamoto of the coming war, his cloak had been exchanged with a hooded-cape, which featured a black mask and a thin black sash diagonally encircling his body from the cape's left epaulette.
  </p>
  <p key="7ff6c88b-df0f-4bf6-a48a-760f6bd69c25">
   As a child, Haschwalth wore a light-colored dress shirt and carried a bow and arrow for hunting. His hair was also much shorter, only reaching his chin.
   As a teenager, Haschwalth wore a sleeveless black shirt and light-colored pants, as well as white gloves. He carried a medium-sized double-edged sword in a black sheath at his hip.
   After joining the Sternritter and becoming the captain, Haschwalth wore a dark-colored cape and a standard Wandenreich cap.

   While speaking in a much more casual manner to

    Yhwach
   </a>
   than some, Haschwalth still retains a highly respectful tone.
   He is very loyal to Yhwach, preventing
   another Sternritter
   from recklessly entering Yhwach's chambers in outrage of his chosen successor and calmly stating it is Yhwach's decision to name the successor, not his own,
   as well as believing that he (and everyone else) is prepared and willing to live and die for Yhwach's continued existence.
   When he realized that
   <a href="Uryū Ishida.html" key="bc698073-92bd-4b4d-8ad1-e52932eebd28" title="Uryū Ishida">
    Uryū Ishida
   </a>
   was not willing to sacrifice anything to gain power from Yhwach, Haschwalth flew into a rage and attempted to slaughter the young Quincy.
  </p>
  <p key="d0ad52c8-a965-4932-b3fb-130dd16be97a">
   Haschwalth is quite confident in his abilities: when the Wandenreich invades Soul Society for a second time, Haschwalth confronts Captain-Commander
   Shunsui Kyōraku
   and declares they will instantly exterminate the enemy army.
   Haschwalth is a man who firmly believes in balance, implying that a fight must be fair and that if one's life is saved by good luck, it will be terminated with an equal amount of misfortune. He acted on this and attacked a
   fellow Sternritter
   despite the disadvantages it posed in doing so on the battlefield.
  </p>
  <p key="9c1aea9a-3968-468b-9e71-7d1c9e9b165a">
   He is perceptive to figure out Uryū's reason of joining the Wandenreich simply to avenge
   his mother's
   death, and seemed rather displeased when Uryū showed shock at being informed that he drank Yhwach's blood and attained a piece of the Father of the Quincy's soul.
   While in possession of Yhwach's power at night, Haschwalth is much more emotional and blunt than usual.
  </p>
  <p key="cb11d2f1-a48c-467c-ae87-96c42f59974c">
   As a child, Haschwalth was very calm and unflappable, even when dealing with an outgoing and pompous boy like Bazz-B. He lacked confidence in his own abilities, having agreed with Bazz-B's assessment of him as a loser, and felt uncomfortable around his uncle, who would beat him if he did not bring home at least one rabbit every day for food. However, he formed a strong friendship with Bazz-B when the latter decided to take him under his wing.
   As a teenager, he remained somewhat timid, having been disturbed by Bazz-B's enthusiastic reaction to learning about the
   Sternritter
   and attempting to convince him to leave after they were initially denied entry into the group.
   However, after learning of his nature as Yhwach's other half and joining the Sternritter, Haschwalth became the cold and firm man he is today.
   Despite severing ties with his former companion, he always held onto Bazz-B's emblem as a token of their friendship.

   As a young boy,
   Bazz-B
   followed Haschwalth when the latter was hunting rabbits, one of which he shot with his Spirit Weapon after Haschwalth failed to do so himself. Bazz-B criticized Haschwalth's skill, and when asked who he was, told Haschwalth to introduce himself first while inadvertently revealing his own name, prompting Haschwalth to introduce himself in turn. Noting Haschwalth's cunning in getting him to introduce himself first, Bazz-B explained that he has been following Haschwalth because he did not think the latter could hunt anything himself. However, Haschwalth noted that he could not even form a

   like Bazz-B could yet, which prompted Bazz-B to claim no one else could do it because he is a genius, which was why Haschwalth should not feel bad. Admitting this was true, Haschwalth asked Bazz-B to stop calling him Jugo before revealing that he lived with his uncle. Haschwalth explained how he needed to catch at least one rabbit and began to walk away, but Bazz-B threw the rabbit he killed at Haschwalth's head and claimed he was not hunting for sustenance anyway before tossing his shield away. Climbing up a tree, Bazz-B told Haschwalth that he would teach him whatever he wanted to know and that they would be the strongest Quincy around before leaping away. Afterward, Haschwalth was found by his uncle, who scolded him for going so deep into the woods.
  </p>
  <p key="8405eadd-e276-4741-85e2-2a5bcaeafc71">
   Half a year later,
   <a href="Yhwach.html" key="6f114b77-d463-40be-a4d6-a9b6d5f64ec8" title="Yhwach">
    Yhwach
   </a>
   began conquering the northern lands where Bazz-B's village was located, during which he burned down Bazz-B's village and the nearby forest. Afterward, Bazz-B told Haschwalth that they would kill Yhwach, but when Haschwalth questioned whether he had to come with him, Bazz-B pointed out how Yhwach also burned down his forest before telling him to live with his uncle if he was okay with this, only for Haschwalth to reveal his uncle died in the fire as well. Bazz-B and Haschwalth used the money they found in the remains of the village to survive and train for five years in order to kill Yhwach.
  </p>
  <p key="d763d09c-a6c3-4edd-8383-8b4f5456571c">
   Despite his best efforts, Haschwalth was unable to develop his skills as a Quincy, to the point where he was unable to even collect Reishi in order to form weapons; Bazz-B theorized that he was the rumored Quincy born once every few decades who was "incomplete". To compensate for this, Haschwalth worked hard at honing his skill with his sword and his bow. Eventually, Yhwach's personal guards came to a nearby village to announce the formation of the Sternritter. Witnessing this, Haschwalth noted that they were lucky to have learned about this while chasing the Wandenreich's flag, but was disturbed by Bazz-B's expression upon hearing this news. When Bazz-B tried to sign both of them up to join the Sternritter, Haschwalth tried to stop him, and was later shocked when Yhwach himself arrived and selected him to be his right-hand man, as Haschwalth was his "other half".
  </p>
  <p key="8996d284-48f8-4b12-be14-c6f4693e5697">
   Yhwach declared that Haschwalth was to join his Sternritter and prepared to leave, but Haschwalth claimed he had made the wrong decision. Despite Hubert's warning, Haschwalth pointed out how he lacked skill with his Quincy abilities before stating that Bazz-B would make a much better right-hand man for Yhwach, but Yhwach merely noted that this was just as he had foreseen before revealing that Haschwalth was a Quincy who shared his ability to empower others. After explaining how he was the true source of Bazz-B's prodigal powers, Yhwach told Haschwalth that he needed him by his side, and when Bazz-B fired a

   at Yhwach in an attempt to kill him, Haschwalth caught it with his hand.
  </p>
  <p key="c1477196-cd60-4abd-b08b-aa045a406791">
   Soon after, Haschwalth joined the Sternritter, and at some point became the captain. 3 years after first meeting Yhwach, Bazz-B joined the Sternritter as well and began challenging Haschwalth to combat multiple times, only for Haschwalth to refuse every time because doing so was punishable by death. On one such occasion, Hubert, who had been watching, noted it must be annoying to be pestered by a new recruit before wondering if Haschwalth does not seem influential enough. After Haschwalth stated he would follow his example, Hubert offered to teach Bazz-B a lesson and claimed Yhwach would not know if no one saw, only for Haschwalth to remind him that he was watching.

   Identifying the captain, Haschwalth listens to how each was killed and states that Kenpachi is indeed a monster, but his comment is ignored as Kenpachi declares his intent to kill Yhwach.
   Haschwalth watches as the captain is defeated and held aloft by his throat, just before the arrival of Captain-Commander
   Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
   .
   As the battle between Yamamoto and Yhwach ensues, Haschwalth continues to watch despite his concern.

   Haschwalth steps forward, but is stopped by Yhwach, who ultimately decides they are left with no option other than to crush Ichigo. With Ichigo quickly subdued, Haschwalth acknowledges Yhwach's order to bring him back to their castle, where they could recruit him into their army.

   When Yhwach tells the Sternritter that Uryū will be his successor, Haschwalth stops

   from stepping forward to object to Yhwach's decision.
   Afterwards, when Bazz-B tries to go to Yhwach's chambers to object, Haschwalth stops him once more. When Bazz-B says Haschwalth should have been Yhwach's successor, Haschwalth states it is Yhwach's decision and tells Bazz-B to calm down. Bazz-B declares that he's perfectly calm, and suddenly they are interrupted by
   Askin Nakk Le Vaar
   . He confirms that Bazz-B is calm as he didn't attack Haschwalth right away, and states that a fight would only bring to nothing, especially for Haschwalth.
   Returning to his chambers afterwards, Haschwalth finds an attendant waiting for his return. When his attendant comments on how he must feel after Yhwach's decision about his successor, Haschwalth says he understands their leader's intent to use the discontent within the Wandenreich ranks in order to control Uryū's actions.

   Quickly moving to the captain's room, Haschwalth approaches the newly appointed Captain-Commander
   Shunsui Kyōraku

When Nanao admits they do not, Haschwalth states that she should have perfected the spell so everyone else could master it, as they would have gone down fighting instead of being executed.
   Haschwalth and Shunsui exchange comments on how the battle is progressing, leading to Haschwalth stating he is there to tip the balance in favor of the Wandenreich. After the wall behind Shunsui is destroyed, Haschwalth reveals that he had gradually absorbed the Reishi on his side of the barrier, although this took him longer than he expected, and says it is a splendid technique.

   As a new wall appears, Nanao reveals she created a new barrier while Haschwalth was absorbing Reishi. When Haschwalth notes this wall appears to have been made with a different technique, Nanao confirms this and explains how the wall is comprised of smaller hexagonal plates joined together. She asks him if it appears to be weaker because it is not a single wall, and Haschwalth confirms this. Wary of a trap somewhere, Haschwalth states he will resort to a more violent method, only to stop in surprise when the Wandenreich symbol appears behind him. He reveals that he received an order to return to Silbern, and excuses himself. When Shunsui asks him if he is leaving already, Haschwalth states that

Haschwalth states that the scales of the fight must be fair, and that their good luck will be balanced by the same amount of misfortune, and strikes Cang with his sword. However, the blade is stopped by Cang's ability,

   Later, as Yhwach is sleeping, Haschwalth questions Uryū about why he's trying to enter Yhwach's room. Haschwalth states that only when Yhwach is asleep does he return to being the father of the Quincy and stores his power, thus no one may disturb his sleep. Haschwalth repeats his question, only for Uryū to say that he doesn't have to tell him what he's going to ask Yhwach. Uryū continues by noting that Haschwalth seems different from how he was during the day, prompting Haschwalth to say that he and Yhwach are different sides of the scale, and that when Yhwach becomes the 'Father of the Quincy', Haschwalth is given the 'Mask of the Ruler', stating that all Quincy and Yhwach are connected.

Saying that Yhwach has already carved an initial into Uryū's soul, Haschwalth moves forward and pins Uryū to the wall. Stating that there is no way back for Uryū, Haschwalth notes that even though he probably only joined the Wandenreich to avenge
   his mother
   he didn't have any way back from the beginning. He then elaborates on how Yhwach is empowered by anyone who dies in the battle, stating that Yhwach must continue to fight, otherwise he would revert to his previous state. All the Sternritter live and die for the sake of their king. As the sun begins to rise, Haschwalth notes morning is coming and the emperor will soon wake up.

   Uryū manages to dodge Haschwalth's stab at the last minute before noting Haschwalth's comparison of him to his friends. When Uryū claims that he would feel great joy if he began to resemble any one of them, Haschwalth dismisses his emotions before explaining that he was referring to Uryū's growth, as the single moment where Yhwach granted him power gave him far more growth than all the years he spent with his friends, and that it is more logical for him to side with Yhwach because of this. However, Uryū states that he chose to side with them not because it would benefit him, but because they were his friends. Angered by this, Haschwalth notes that Uryū never expected to give up anything in return for being taken in by Yhwach before declaring that Uryū will give Yhwach his life, only to be interrupted when an

   Haschwalth collapses and, upon seeing a concerned Uryū looking at him, claims that he does not feel betrayed by Yhwach because the latter chose to take his power over Uryū's, which means only he can be an asset to Yhwach. When Uryū begins to walk away, Haschwalth asks him to come back so he can transfer Uryū's wounds to himself, shocking Uryū. Noting that he will die regardless of how wounded he is, Haschwalth reminds Uryū of how he puts everything on his scales because he might come to regret everything if he merely follows others without considering the consequences of his actions before telling him to save his friends. Shortly after transferring Uryū's wounds to himself, Haschwalth lies alone on the ground and notes that living life according to one's convictions and without any regrets is compelling as he dies.
