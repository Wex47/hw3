Rukia asks if Senna knows anything about the spirits, but she is distracted by her reflection and states that the yellow ribbon in her hair doesn't suit her. Annoyed by Senna's actions, Ichigo attempts to question her again, however, Senna points out to Ichigo that

   As Ichigo and Rukia are questioning her, Senna realizes that there is a Ferris wheel nearby. She turns back to Ichigo and Rukia, forgetting what they were asking her. Rukia asks Senna which Division she is in, but Senna replies that she forgot. Rukia argues that if Senna knows how to use Shikai, then she is a Shinigami, and that there was no way she could forget which Division she's affiliated with. Senna states that she can't remember, but doesn't see it as an issue. Ichigo asks if she knows what the spirits were, but she replies that she does not know and only attacked them because she felt that they were hostile. Rukia eventually departs, leaving Ichigo to keep track of Senna on his own. Senna runs from Ichigo and tries to get him to play a game of tag with her.

   Ichigo returns to the mall in the evening to talk to Senna once again. Senna greets him, surprised that he actually returned after being gone for so long. He tries to question her again, but she tells him that she'll answer anything he asks once he catches her and runs off again. Ichigo tries to find her, but he loses track of her. He then finds Senna standing on top of the roof of one of the stores and watches as she balances herself on one of the overhead wires lighting the area. Senna suddenly loses balance and falls off, alerting the entire crowd, but vanishes before she even hits the ground. She appears behind Ichigo and gets the attention of the crowd gathered in the area, who applaud her. She tries to get Ichigo to join her, but he grabs her and runs away from the crowd.

Senna tries to get more information as to why the group is looking for the Shinenju, as well as what the Shinenju is, but Ichigo is unable to tell her either, as he does not know. Senna tells them their only option is to wait for the Blanks to return in order to get a lead on what they're up against, and that she would help him if he takes her onto the Ferris wheel. Ichigo notes that Senna likes high places, and she tells him it is because things that look confusing become clearer when seen from above. Ichigo realizes that Senna has a red-colored ribbon and she tells him that she tried it on in a store, but forgot she was wearing it. Ichigo gets up and tells her they're going back to the store, but she reminds him that he needs to pay the bill for their food.

   Ichigo and Senna find the shop Senna took the ribbon from. Ichigo pays for the ribbon and gives it to Senna, who goes elsewhere to put it on. As she heads back to meet with Ichigo, she sees the river outside the window, causing her to think of memories of her father. She ends up leaving the mall to visit a cemetery, but upon her arrival, she is ambushed by group of Blanks, as well as a large man named
   Jai
   . Jai tells Senna to come with him, as his leader,
   Ganry≈´

Senna attacks Jai, but he blocks her strike and restrains her. However, before Jai and his group can leave, Ichigo arrives and cuts off Jai's arm, which frees Senna. Jai and his group then retreat before the fight can escalate.

Ichigo tells her to stop making up stories, but she assures him that she's telling the truth, as she remembers the cemetery from when she was alive, so she wanted to check it out. She tries to leave, saying that she will help Ichigo the next day, but Ichigo stops her from leaving, noting that she was just attacked.

Ichigo asks her if something is wrong, but she denies it. He decides to ask her what the people who attacked her wanted.

   Senna and Ichigo return to the area where they first encountered the Blanks. Senna asks if Ichigo is sure that they would show up again. Ichigo, however, replies that it was the only place the Blanks had appeared on their own, so it was the only clue they had to act on at the moment. Bored from waiting, Senna wanders off and finds a child

   named Tomoya, who is looking for his father. Senna decides to help him, much to Ichigo's reluctance. As they search for Tomoya's father, Ichigo eventually asks Senna why she insists on finding him, and she replies that because he doesn't have much time in this world left, she would like his last memory to be a happy one. They then arrive at a festival, where Tomoya's father is waiting for them. He thanks Senna and Ichigo for reuniting them. They both bid Ichigo and Senna farewell before vanishing.

However, as she tries to explain more information about herself, she becomes confused. Renji is not surprised by Senna's confusion, knowing that her head is full of inconsistent memories, and Ukitake clarifies that Senna is indeed the Shinenju. Hitsugaya further explains that the Valley of Screams appeared to Soul Society twenty-four hours ago, and that the Gotei 13 has concluded that the leader of the enemies, Ganry≈´, seeks to destroy both the Human World and Soul Society by using the Shinenju to do so. He then tells her than they will proceed to detain her indefinitely. Ichigo, however, disapproves of the Shinigami's actions, explaining that Senna still experiences anger, happiness, and pain, but by disregarding her as a living being, their actions aren't anymore justified than the enemy's, and because of this, he refuses to let them take Senna.

Ganry≈´ tells her that 1,000 years ago, his clan was exiled from Soul Society into the Dangai. They eventually discovered the Valley of Screams and learned how to manipulate and control the Blanks. He further explains that the Blanks gathered in large numbers and eventually generated the Valley of Screams. He also states that the memories of the Blanks merge into one object: the Shinenju, which is Senna. By placing Senna in the center of the Valley of Screams, the Blanks begin to swarm towards her, which would eventually constrict the dimension, causing the Dangai to collapse, and causing the Human World and Soul Society to be drawn together in a collision, destroying both worlds.

While Ichigo fights Ganry≈´, he is restrained by the Dark One. Ganry≈´ asks why Ichigo insists on trying to save Senna, as she is only a being consisted of memories of multiple people. Ichigo retorts that Senna is still a living being, and that despite being an innocent girl, Ganry≈´ still wishes for her to die. Ichigo declares that he swore to protect her. Senna senses the surge in Ichigo's power and then realizes her connection to the Blanks. Ichigo breaks free from his restraints and continues fighting Ganry≈´, eventually killing him.

   Senna tells Ichigo that she's afraid of what's about to happen. She reflects upon her time in the Human World and expresses that she doesn't want to let it be destroyed, nor let Ichigo die. She then tells him that she will return the memories to the Blanks, which will bring them peace, and that she will use their energy to restore the barrier separating the Human World and Soul Society. Ichigo tries to stop Senna from sacrificing her life to save him, but Senna follows through on her plan, expressing that she can't let Ichigo die instead of her. By returning the Blanks' memories to them, Senna stops both worlds from colliding and restores them to their original positions.

   Senna still remains after returning the memories to the Blanks, but she realizes that she won't last for much longer and asks Ichigo to take her to the graveyard. She tells him that she wants to see her grave, insisting that she was once alive and lived in

   . Ichigo approaches the grave that Senna points out to him, but her vision begins to fade, so she can't see. She asks Ichigo if her name is on the grave, and he replies to her that it is; that she did exist, and she did have a family. Senna begins to cry, happy to have heard that she once lived in Karakura. As Senna's body begins to fade, she asks Ichigo if they will ever see each other again. Ichigo replies that they will see each other again, and Senna then fades away. Rukia approaches Ichigo shortly after and tells him that the energy from the Blanks is dissipating, and once it is completely gone, nobody will remember anything about Senna, as she never existed. Ichigo replies that he knows she'll be gone soon, but he can still hear her voice.

   One day, as Ichigo is heading towards school, he catches a red ribbon blowing through the wind. As he looks at the ribbon, he becomes surprised. He then hears a few school girls come from behind him, and he sees a girl who resembles Senna running past him. Ichigo smiles and continues to head towards his school.
