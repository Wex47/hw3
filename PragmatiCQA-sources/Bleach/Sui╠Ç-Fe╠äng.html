   Suì-Fēng is a relatively petite woman with gray eyes and black hair which she wears short with two long braids bound in white cloth, each ending in a large golden ring.
   110 years ago, Suì-Fēng's hair was shoulder-length and had a softer look to it. She wears a traditional

   and a yellow obi tied around her waist.
   Underneath her standard Shinigami captain's uniform, Suì-Fēng wears the uniform of the commander-in-chief of the Onmitsukidō, which has no sleeves and doesn't cover the back, though she does wear long black arm bands.
   Instead of wearing the standard Shinigami sandals with

   Seventeen months after Aizen's defeat, Suì-Fēng's hair is similar to her younger age 110 years ago.
   Sometime before the Wandenreich's invasion of Soul Society, Suì-Fēng removes the two long braids.

    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="5ae0f0f6-25f4-4076-aec2-07ab418938bd">
   Suì-Fēng is staunchly loyal, firm, and unbending in her beliefs. She is a hard worker and takes a strong moral stance — she particularly believes in following orders. She is generally reserved and truly not arrogant in any manner like her lieutenant, though she is not above mocking/joking around with her opponents or smirking while in combat, a trait shared with her
   predecessor
   . She will not hesitate in the slightest to strike down even her subordinates if they stand in her way. She chooses to ignore all her subordinates, including her lieutenant Ōmaeda, believing that personal struggle builds character.
   Suì-Fēng, like most female Shinigami, is a member of the
   Shinigami Women's Association
   .
  </p>
  <p key="1672dafd-d901-4799-bbc0-efb8915c7ff7">
   Suì-Fēng likes fish but dislikes other meat.
   She also seems to be quite obsessed with Yoruichi, and often spends her free time dreaming about the days when they fought together and practiced Shunpo.
   At one point, she even tried to give Yoruichi a heart-shaped box of chocolates with little success. She seems to love anything that resembles a black cat, which is Yoruichi's alternate form, and she has a large collection of black cat shaped merchandise. At one point, Suì-Fēng is given a black cat plushie by Rangiku, who has just returned from a mission in the Real World.
   It is also known that since Yoruichi's reappearance, she began to collect cat accessories and had the 2nd Division quarters installed with floor-heating (the expenses were covered by her lieutenant).
   Suì-Fēng once seems to be affectionately admiring pictures of Yoruichi.
   Later, as part of the photo collecting project of the Shinigami Women's Association she attempts to take nude photos of Yoruichi while she is distracted, but fails miserably.
   When the Shinigami Women's Association is tasked with designing a new cellphone for Shinigami ladies, she submits a design featuring a black cat's head with a bee body (the cat representing Yoruichi and the bee representing herself), with a private line that would allow her to talk to Yoruichi as much as she wanted. The request was denied.
   When Yamamoto commands the Gotei 13 captains to design a Shinigami video game, Suì-Fēng proposed a game with her and Yoruichi as the protagonists. Her lieutenant, Ōmaeda, tells her plainly that she is the only person who will play such a game.
   This attitude towards Yoruichi also extends to her little brother,
   <a href="Yūshirō Shihōin.html" key="f11254b3-4ab4-4116-bffc-62d5bb85bfab" title="Yūshirō Shihōin">

   , whom Suì-Fēng compliments and offers pocket money while visibly blushing upon meeting for the first time in several years.
  </p>
  <p key="94ce98f1-7553-43d2-90bb-ee5642324ae3">
   Suì-Fēng is a person of incredible resolve, not hesitating to do whatever it takes to complete a mission and defeat her enemy; such as during her battle with the Segunda Espada, after being exposed to an attack she orders her lieutenant to remove her arm without hesitation. Very rarely will Suì-Fēng show signs of desperation or emotion on the battlefield, except when it concerns her former master. Despite her cold demeanor and constant attack towards her lieutenant, she has displayed a certain level of faith in him (trusting him to act as a distraction while she carries out a plan). Her stubborn attitude is so great that even now she still seems to hold a degree of dislike for

   be it because Yoruichi used to tease her about him, or she found his lazy demeanor undisciplined or that she still blames him for her mentor's abandonment over one hundred years previously. This is shown when she asks
   Hachigen Ushōda
   to place the shop owner in a barrier for a month in exchange for using her Bankai a second time in one day.

        as was tradition in her family. Upon joining the militia, she dropped her given name, Shaolin Fēng, and inherited the code name that her great-grandmother used, Suì-Fēng. Out of her five older siblings, two died on the first mission, then two more on the second. The last one died on the sixth mission.

       <p key="4ea4ccbd-8903-4112-a720-9e71a1646257">
        As a member of the militia, Suì-Fēng trained intensely in order to become as strong as the corps-commander,
        Yoruichi Shihōin
        , the person she had come to adore. Seven years later, her efforts finally paid off when Yoruichi took notice of her talent and promoted Suì-Fēng to become one of her personal guards. Initially, their differing personalities seemed to clash due to Yoruichi's laid back nature, however, Suì-Fēng dedicated her life to her master, happy to put her life on the line for her. In turn, Yoruichi took Suì-Fēng under her wing as her protégée, and they developed a close relationship as student and mentor.
       </p>
       <p key="63a3c097-b194-413a-baf4-7188a13505a8">
        Over 110 years ago, Suì-Fēng, in her capacity as a head of the guard, was highly protective of Yoruichi as well as her honor. She had a short temper when it came to

        toward Yoruichi's intention of putting him up for promotion to be the new captain of the 12th Division because all she saw was his carefree attitude; being lazy and doing bad at his job. Suì-Fēng confronts Yoruichi, concerned that she is overestimating Urahara's capabilities. She explains that she believes it was a mistake to even appoint him as Corps Commander of the Detention Unit, and goes on to say that he is undeserving of such a position. While Yoruichi, without hesitation, admits to the fact that Urahara is not really a hard worker, she dismisses Suì-Fēng's criticisms and playfully insinuates that her focus on him must have romantic connotations, though Suì-Fēng denies it entirely and stalks off.
       </p>
       <p key="32e375f3-85dc-46c7-bbcd-9785cc757a17">
        After spending the day following Urahara around Soul Society while taking notes, she returns to the 2nd Division barracks to show Yoruichi her evidence of Urahara's lack of competence in his position. Suì-Fēng arrives to find Urahara already there talking with Yoruichi. Suì-Fēng is then told that Urahara will be taking the captain proficiency exam, to which she stands in disbelief. Yoruichi confirms it and further asks that Suì-Fēng attend the exam as well. Yoruichi explains that normally only captains are allowed to attend, but that she has asked special permission to allow Suì-Fēng to attend. Suì-Fēng is at first confused about why she should attend, but Yoruichi tells her there is no need to keep secrets as she knows Suì-Fēng is attracted to Urahara.
       </p>
       <p key="a198684d-4ade-47c3-8faf-7aa592d56ad6">
        Suì-Fēng denies this, so Yoruichi explains that she knows all about how Suì-Fēng having followed him around all day. Suì-Fēng admits that she was following Urahara around, but tells her it was to prove that he is lazy, incompetent, and not worthy of Yoruichi's praise. Suì-Fēng hands her note to Yoruichi, who reads them and comments on how detailed they are, when Urahara doesn't deny any of the information in the report Suì-Fēng is shocked that he would be so truthful to his seemingly unprofessional actions. Yoruichi unsurprised quips that Urahara never changes as well as praising Suì-Fēng for her intelligence gathering skills.

       <p key="bf66aac2-e5db-4610-8ba4-a86925d98e8a">
        At first Suì-Fēng was happy until she realized that Yoruichi regarded the notes not as intelligence information, but rather as a love letter. Suì-Fēng is reasonably distressed and Yoruichi laughs it off and tells her to loosen up as she wasn't serious. They are then interrupted by the arrival of a squad member who delivers the message that the people Urahara has been looking for has been found, though Suì-Fēng comments on if he doesn't return in time that it will put a strain of the 2nd Divisions reputation as well as Yoruichi. To which Yoruichi simply dismisses tell Urahara to hurry off to his duty and telling Suì-Fēng to come along to help prepare for the captain's proficiency test. She follows Urahara and his men to a remote area where

        , Yoruichi is told by an Onmitsukidō member that Urahara has entered into the Detention Unit property with claims that he was previously given approval to be there. Yoruichi can't seem to recall when or even if he asked for permission or whether she granted it, but when asked if she would have him removed seeing as she can't recall she nonchalantly tells her division members to not bother and to allow him to go where he likes. When asked if she has remembered the incident in question, Yoruichi plainly says no. Suì-Fēng becomes distressed and prepares to voice her disapproval, Yoruichi tells her to calm down as its Kisuke they are talking about, stating he must have had an idea of some kind.

As a result, she trained herself in order to surpass Yoruichi and take the titles she abandoned. She ultimately unified the Onmitsukidō as well as the Punishment Force after Yoruichi disappeared.

        . All that get in her way are her enemies and all enemies must be slain. Ōmaeda denotes that he understands before Suì-Fēng promptly tells him that the same goes for him as well. She explains that he should know where his loyalties lie and should he get in her way he will become her enemy. Ōmaeda smirks and states that he will remember that.

        Suì-Fēng engages Yoruichi in hand-to-hand combat before the two put some distance between themselves up in the trees of the forest they landed in. Suì-Fēng comments that even though they have not seen each other in a long time, Yoruichi has not gotten any stronger. Yoruichi quips that on the contrary she thinks that Suì-Fēng has in fact gotten weaker. Suì-Fēng notes that the
        Tentōken
        , that Ichigo was wearing had the emblem of the
        Shihōin
        Clan, she asks if Yoruichi gave it to him. Yoruichi plainly admits it as she states that flight was necessary to rescue Rukia at the time. Suì-Fēng states that the Tenshiheisonban, the Shihōin Clan, has also fallen. She notes that the fall of a noble family is not a pretty sight at all. Yoruichi asks why Suì-Fēng is talking so much, maybe she is excited to see her old mentor or is she blowing off steam from her position as Commander-in-Chief of the
        <a href="Onmitsukidō.html" key="cd1990fe-49ff-4a87-ab7e-9441a8192dc9" title="Onmitsukidō">

        . She asks Suì-Fēng if it is stressful being her successor. Suì-Fēng tells her to not get cocky and think that she is still better after all those years. Suì-Fēng states that both the Onmitsukidō and the Executive Militia are now under her control, as Yoruichi's era has ended a long time ago and she proceeds to take out her

        Immediately Yoruichi is surrounded by a cadre of Executive Militia members. Suì-Fēng asks if she remembers that when the Corps-Commander of the Executive Militia draws her sword the execution begins. Everyone who opposes the Corp-Commander will be executed, even if that person was the Corps-Commander once and has since given up on being the Corps-Commander. Before anyone can react, Yoruichi uses her great skill in Shunpo and takes out every Executive Militia member in the area in under a minute, stunning Suì-Fēng. Yoruichi tells her to stop looking down on people so much, as she did give up her role as leader, but there is still one title that she still did not give away. Suì-Fēng takes off her haori and tells then she will take that title from her.

        Yoruichi comments on Suì-Fēng's attire, noting that she is wearing the battle suit of the Corps-Commander of the Executive Militia. Suì-Fēng attacks Yoruichi and they begin to fight once again. Suì-Fēng notes that they have reached a draw both gaining a hit on one another. Yoruichi comments on what kind of outfit is Suì-Fēng wearing as it seems to prevent her from seeing her movements. Suì-Fēng asks her if she really thinks it is some trick and uses Shunpo to appear behind Yoruichi and holds her Zanpakutō up to her throat as she releases her Shikai. Yoruichi uses Shunpo to get away, but Suì-Fēng catches up to her and lands an attack. They move apart once again and Suì-Fēng tells her to admit that she is stronger as it may not occur to her that she is holding back. She states that she has become stronger than Yoruichi, and with her death and will make her pay the price for staying away from battle for a hundred years.

        . Suì-Fēng asks her what she is talking about. Yoruichi asks her if she knows why the Executive Militia's leader's outfit has no cloth on the back or shoulders, explaining because it is meaningless. Yoruichi then uses the same technique, but at a more advanced level than Suì-Fēng's, explaining what the technique does in detail to her former protégée. Yoruichi further states that she wasn't planning on using this against her, but warns Suì-Fēng to be careful as even she can't control it perfectly yet as she sends a wave of condensed Reiatsu toward her.

       <p key="12443bf0-cd72-4935-940c-6bab4ce728bb">
        When the smoke clears, the land between them is torn and scorched. Yoruichi asks Suì-Fēng if she now understands why she never showed her this technique, as it is too dangerous. Suì-Fēng goes to attack her, but Yoruichi nullifies it with Hanki, and tells her to stop as it is too soon for her to be using the technique. Suì-Fēng begins to attack Yoruichi again yelling at her that she is stronger and that she should have surpassed her, that Yoruichi should have weakened all these hundreds of years and that she should have grown stronger. She asks how it is possible that Yoruichi is still so far above her after all this time. She then relays all of her pent up feelings at being disappointed, betrayed and abandoned by her former mentor, when she left all those years ago. All the while, Suì-Fēng continues to attack as Yoruichi moves effortlessly out of the way. But then Yoruichi stops the attacks by initiating a Shunkō powered punch, but stopping short of actually hitting Suì-Fēng. Upset and unwilling to fight anymore, Suì-Fēng breaks down and cries, asking Yoruichi why didn't she take her with her.

Suì-Fēng then goes after Ichigo, who is unable to convince her without any evidence. After some swordplay she discards her haori and easily dominates the battle with Hakuda and then releases her Zanpakutō, but before she can attack Rukia uses her Hakuren technique, cutting her off from any further attacks as they make their getaway.

     Shortly, while debriefing her men on the situation, she is approached by

        Suì-Fēng is thrown away by Ggio's attacks and sent flying into the side of
        Nirgge Parduoc

        Ōmaeda goes to check on Suì-Fēng, but she berates him for acting weak and tells him that he is never to turn his back on an enemy. Suì-Fēng then calls him a disgrace and goes back to fighting.
        Ggio takes the upper hand in the fight again and pins Suì-Fēng to the side of a building with his fangs. He then proceeds to finish her off, but Ōmaeda jumps in and blocks the attack with his Shikai. He then grabs the Arrancar in a bear hug and tells his captain to attack. As Ggio prepares to blast Ōmaeda with a Cero, Suì-Fēng kicks him away, revealing she had been feigning her loss in order to study the Arrancar's Resurrección. After knocking Ōmaeda back with a punch to the face, Suì-Fēng tells him if he sees an ally losing to attack the enemy from behind or stand aside if the foe is too strong instead of stepping between them.

        Baraggan then takes out his Zanpakutō and begins to swing it at them, but they dodge the attack. Suì-Fēng tries to attack him with a kick, but he grabs her leg and throws her into a nearby building. This causes Suì-Fēng to wonder about Baraggan's ability as every time she goes to kick him her attack suddenly slows down. She notices that it is not due to his spiritual energy, but that her own body is getting slower. Noticing that she is wondering about his powers, Baraggan tells her that the
        Espada
        each embody an aspect of death, and that his aspect is old age, which in turn gives him power over time. He then shows her by using

        The explosion is powerful enough to not only push Suì-Fēng back, but also her lieutenant. Suì-Fēng's sash rips apart, but she's safely caught by Ōmaeda as they look on at the large cloud caused by the explosion.

Hachi pleads with her that he knows she doesn't want to work with them because of their connection to Urahara, but he reminds her that this is not the time for grudges. Suì-Fēng continues to be uninterested in teaming up with him, to which Hachi relents and tells her he will make a deal with her.

        Hachi goes on to explain that Baraggan used his aging on Suì-Fēng's Bankai and made it explode far away from him so that he escaped the explosion. Hachi then deduces that if Baraggan is somewhere where he can't escape the explosion and the explosion is too close to him, then his powers won't be fast enough to keep it away from him.

She explains that normally she can only fire her Bankai once every three days, but here she was able to do it twice in one day. She reiterates that she wants her payment from Hachi.

     As
     Gonryōmaru
     is attacking the Shinigami, the 2nd Division captain goes on the offensive, attacking the Zanpakutō Spirit. She effortlessly dodges a fire blast from
     Tenken
     and is nonplussed at the idea of fighting two powerful (lieutenant and captain level) opponents at once. Gonryōmaru attacks Suì-Fēng with electricity, but she dodges and lands a solid kick on him, launching him into a wall. She continues by dodging attacks from Tenken. After briefly ribbing Gonryōmaru, the latter summons a dark cloud that hovers over her.

     Suì-Fēng continues to taunt Gonryōmaru and Tenken before taking them both on using Shunkō. The battle is going her way greatly when she is interrupted by
     Suzumebachi
     . Suzumebachi manages to get a Hōmonka on her and says that she was close to getting a second sting as well. Suzumebachi then berates Suì-Fēng's sense of style and tells her she sounds stupid when she goes around saying "Yoruichi-sama" this, "Yoruichi-sama" that. To cap things off, Suzumebachi tells her to get a new wardrobe and a boyfriend. Suì-Fēng is shocked at Suzumebachi's personality and questions whether that really is her Zanpakutō. Suzumebachi tells her that if she doubts her then just wait and see what happens when she is stung a second time.
     Worried that she will not be able to keep up with Suzumebachi's speed in the current area, Suì-Fēng tricks Suzumebachi into following her elsewhere.

     As Suì-Fēng continues to run she is attacked by Suzumebachi though she perfectly dodges so that she does not get hit in the same spot a second time, resulting in a Hōmonka appearing on her shoulder. Suzumebachi congratulates her on her tactics, but notes that the Hōmonka seals are starting to add up, as she now has a total of three. Suì-Fēng begins to ponder why their speed is not the same until Suzumebachi explains that because she is smaller than Suì-Fēng, that regardless of them having the same speed she has more dexterity and therefore she has the advantage and that is the reason why she can attack Suì-Fēng, but Suì-Fēng cannot land a single hit on her. Suzumebachi then begins to taunt Suì-Fēng by talking about Yoruichi causing Suì-Fēng to become upset and strike out at Suzumebachi. Suì-Fēng then tries again to slash at Suzumebachi, who dodges the attacks with ease. Suzumebachi the attempts to sting Suì-Fēng in the eye, but using Shunpo she dodges the attack, resulting in her getting hit on her cheek, where a Hōmonka appears.

     Suzumebachi laughs at Suì-Fēng as she tries to determine where to strike her next, flying around Suì-Fēng using her amazing speed to confuse Suì-Fēng. Suzumebachi decides to attack the Hōmonka on Suì-Fēng's cheek but just as her stinger makes contact she is repelled by Suì-Fēng's Shunkō. Suì-Fēng takes her sword and strikes Suzumebachi down. Thus regaining control of her Zanpakutō. Although victorious, the fight has exhausted her and just as Suì-Fēng is about to collapse she is held up by Yoruichi who carries her back to meet the others. Suì-Fēng is present when Yoruichi reveals that she has found where Muramasa is keeping Captain-Commander

Hitsugaya convinces her to instead focus first on taking care of the Menos Grande. As the number of Gillian grows due to the open Garganta, Suì-Fēng and the others combine their Reiatsu to seal the Garganta, preventing more Gillian from arriving.
     After Suì-Fēng and the others finish off the remaining Gillian, Ichigo emerges from the collapsed down the victor with a dying Muramasa who apologizes for his actions.

   "): An advanced technique that combines hand-to-hand combat and Kidō. She fights by surrounding her back and arms with pressurized Kidō. The keisen uniform has no back or sleeves because they will rip apart when the technique is activated.
   The technique takes the form of wind currents and its incomplete form is concentrated around her right arm. She has enough control to release the Kidō energy as a directed blast that can cause considerable damage to the surrounding area.
   She can use the technique to a greater degree later on, using it to block a devastating lightning blast and dissipate it, and block a blade attack as well as push it back with only her bare hand, using the energy of the technique as a barrier.
   She can focus the technique's pressurized Kidō onto specific areas of her body, making the protection exceedingly more concentrated.
