  <p key="5d2f7315-5674-48f7-8108-fe823f2259e8">
   Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end. He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to wear slim fitting clothes.
   He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number.
   Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin.
   When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami attire, with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.
   It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.
   Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including
   Jūshirō Ukitake
   , to note a similarity to
   Kaien Shiba
   , the former lieutenant of the
   13th Division
   .
   After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends.
   After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.
  </p>
  <p key="0be1b841-cbfd-4869-bbe7-4acbd589277b">
   Seventeen months after defeating Aizen, Ichigo's overall appearance does not change, but he becomes taller again and grows sideburns.
   After regaining his powers, seemingly caused by remaining energy from his Fullbring,
   Ichigo's Shinigami attire consists of a thicker strap across his chest. He has four black vertical lines on his forearms and black, tattoo-like bands crossing over his chest, wrists, and ankles. Similar bands, but with white ends, lie around his neck as collars.

   , but with some notable changes: he has two white shoulder plates crossing his chest in an X shape that hold his Shikai blades in place, with the first plate on his left shoulder having three sections adorned with red scales, the second plate having three sections adorned with red scales on his right waist,
   and a white cloak with black markings tied around his waist.

  <p key="a66c9e9e-f3eb-477f-a159-7954743b4b5b">
   When he was younger, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world, always smiling when he was with Masaki and regularly holding her hand.
   Despite crying whenever he lost in a match at the
   dojo
   he attended, Ichigo started to smile again as soon as he saw Masaki when she came to pick him up.
   At a very young age, Ichigo heard his father saying his name means "to protect one thing," which instilled in him a desire to protect his mother. When his sisters were born, he began attending a dojo for the sake of protecting them. Since then, the number of people he wishes to protect has continued to grow, causing Ichigo to risk his life to protect both the people close to him and complete strangers.
  </p>
  <p key="e6b330cd-3f12-44a5-813e-85a29c1343e8">
   As a teenager, Ichigo is stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive.
   Despite claiming not to care about what other people think about him, he attempts to maintain a detached and "cool" image.
   He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together.
   His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. He coldly refers to his teachers as "instructors".
   He is genuinely compassionate and empathetic towards others, promising to bring a

   or soothing others when they become upset.
  </p>
  <p key="dec9f90d-2e03-4027-a93e-5f1715a29762">
   Ichigo is a capable student, ranked 23rd in his year at school, who studies regularly and does not neglect his schoolwork.
   He works as hard as he does to overcome the misconceptions many have about him based on his hair color and fighting.
   Ichigo hates fortune telling, horoscopes, feng shui, psychics, and anyone whose trade involves taking money from people for things they cannot see.
   He has difficulty remembering people's faces and names.
   However, Ichigo can remember the names of noticeable individuals even when they did not directly tell him their names.
   Ichigo becomes extremely shy and uncomfortable around nude or immodestly dressed women, a fact both
   Yoruichi Shihōin
   and
   <a href="Rangiku Matsumoto.html" key="687ae7cb-8899-4564-bfd5-8b512dd93586" title="Rangiku Matsumoto">

   have teased him for.
   Ichigo is often disrespectful when talking to those older than himself, calling
   Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
   "gramps" and referring to several of the Shinigami captains by their given names without using honorifics.
  </p>
  <p key="90d2a28b-775f-4794-8052-89a7876ded87">
   When it comes to fighting, Ichigo has a complex sense of honor; he regularly seeks to exact revenge for the cruel actions of his opponent, such as instilling the fear of being murdered in
   Shrieker
   and cutting off the right arm of
   Yammy Llargo
   in retaliation for him ripping

   </a>
   's right arm off.
   He often taunts and belittles his opponents when fighting, sometimes attacking without warning.
   Ichigo has a strong desire to win his fights, but in what he views as a legitimate manner.
   To this end, he has often refused the aid of his inner Hollow, even when knowing it would allow him to win.
   Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, which can impede his fighting prowess, and goes into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major battle or lets a friend down.
  </p>
  <p key="768e6969-2e1f-420a-b481-3cf372bd8cec">
   Ichigo despises those who mistreat their allies in any way, even if they are his own enemies. He was disgusted when Yammy calls
   Ulquiorra Cifer
   ,
   Nnoitra Gilga
   , and
   Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez
   "trash".

   Tatsuki Arisawa
   . Though Tatsuki beat Ichigo in every match they had, she would help Ichigo if he was being picked on by bullies and cheer him up if he was upset.

   for as long as he could remember.
   He could see them so clearly, as a child, he could not tell the living from the dead. This resulted in him appearing to other people to be looking at deserted places and talking to himself. This caused people to say he could see ghosts, though when Tatsuki asked him about this, he denied being able to see them.

   Starting the day after Masaki's death, Ichigo repeatedly skipped school to go to the riverbank where Masaki died. Tatsuki found him there, where he would stay from morning until night, wandering along the bank as if searching for his mother, squatting down if he was tired and then wandering some more.

When Orihime asks what happened between Ichigo and Uryū, Ichigo dismisses it as no big deal.
        After school, Ichigo follows Uryū as he leaves. Asking him if he intends to follow him home, Uryū notes he had noticed him spying on him from the classroom doorway. When Ichigo applauds him, Uryū states it is due to Ichigo's inability to restrain his spiritual power, and he lacks the ability to sense
        Reiatsu
        , as evidenced by him not noticing Uryū until that day. Revealing he noticed Ichigo's unusually high spiritual power and his acquisition of Shinigami powers, Uryū, inviting Ichigo to fight him, says Shinigami are unnecessary in the Human World.

        Though Ichigo ridicules the idea, Uryū succeeds in convincing him to fight him, and he uses Kon to free his Shinigami form. Using some Hollow bait to cause Hollows to gather in Karakura Town, Uryū states the one who defeats the most Hollows within twenty-four hours wins. When Ichigo, angered by this, demands to know why he is exposing the town's residents to such danger, Uryū tells him not to worry, as they will kill all the Hollows.
        As Ichigo tries to make him undo it, Uryū tells him Hollows will soon flood the town, and he should try to protect as many people as possible. When Uryū tells him Hollows tend to prefer people with high spiritual power, Ichigo runs off to find Karin.
        After slaying his third Hollow and saving a pair of Pluses, Ichigo, struggling to remember where Karin is, sends Kon to get Rukia's Denreishinki to aid in reacting to the Hollows.
        Defeating the Hollows between the Kurosaki Clinic and the last place where he saw Karin, Ichigo thinks it should be safe for her now.

        Having found Uryū, Ichigo bickers with Kon when he arrives. Unable to attract their attention by shouting, Uryū fires an arrow at Ichigo, who, blocking it, insists it is a battle between him and Uryū, and the amount of Hollows they beat is irrelevant. As Kon points out there is a large crack forming in the sky, and Uryū begins firing arrows into the group of Hollows, Ichigo tells him there are too many, and they need to come up with a strategy. Asking him if he is afraid, Uryū charges towards the Hollows. When Rukia explains the fall of the Quincy at the hands of the Shinigami, Ichigo, running after Uryū, attacks several Hollows around him.
        When Ichigo, telling Uryū he does not know or care about whether the Shinigami or Quincy were right, expresses frustration at his methods, Uryū tells him he thought the Shinigami were correct until his
        sensei
        was killed in front of him. Telling Ichigo of his sensei's attempts to convince the Shinigami to work together with the remaining Quincy and how he died fighting a group of huge Hollows without achieving that goal, Uryū says he must prove the strength of the Quincy to the Shinigami. Pointing out his sensei's wish was to work together, Ichigo, asking if he will do that now, says fighting back to back is the best way to deal with the situation.

        As the two begrudgingly work together, Ichigo, telling him his approach to their fight is endangering the people he wants to protect, says he will not forgive him for that. They agree to beat each other up after the Hollows have been dealt with, but as they prepare to attack a horde of Hollows, a
        Menos Grande
        appears. As

        Tessai Tsukabishi

        Jinta Hanakari

        Seeing its size, Ichigo, questioning if it is in fact a Hollow, is shocked to see it eating the nearby Hollows. Saying there is no way they can figure out how to fight such a monster and they will have to simply cut it repeatedly until it succumbs to its injuries, Ichigo, charging towards the Menos, attacks its leg, but is knocked back by the unfazed Menos.

        Noticing Ichigo's power flows into his bow when he touches it, Uryū, planning to fire an enlarged arrow at the Menos, tells Ichigo to increase his power to maximum. Stating he never controls his energy output, Ichigo says it must be at maximum all the time. When the Menos starts to charge a
        Cero
        , Ichigo, rushing towards it, blocks the Cero with his Zanpakutō. His power increasing as he resists the Cero, Ichigo repels the attack, injuring the Menos in the process.
        As the Menos retreats, Ichigo, claiming victory, collapses as his Zanpakutō begins to destabilize. Noting it will explode, Uryū begins to dissipate the energy by absorbing it and releasing it by firing arrows into the sky, injuring himself. Uryū tells him to make sure he lives so he can beat him later.
        The following day, when Rukia tells Ichigo not to pay attention to Uryū's injuries, Ichigo denies being worried. Later, when he overhears Keigo telling Mizuiro he saw Uryū talking to himself the previous day, believing it to be related to a theater, Ichigo is thankful Keigo is an idiot. Asking Uryū to join them for lunch, Ichigo later regrets it, due to the atmosphere which prevails over their meal.

        That night, Ichigo, taking the leftovers from dinner to give to Rukia, finds she is gone.
        At 2:00 a.m., Ichigo, wondering whether she is going to return that night, notes it would be nice not to have Shinigami duties to carry out for once. Hearing a muffled noise, Ichigo finds Kon gagged and tied to the back of the toilet bowl. When Ichigo asks why he was tied up, Kon, saying Rukia is in big trouble, shows Ichigo a note she left on his desk. Confused by the message, which tells them she has to leave and they should go into hiding instead of looking for her, Ichigo decides to change into his Shinigami form and find her. Realizing he cannot change form without Rukia, Ichigo demands a reluctant Kon change him into a Shinigami. Appearing at the window, Urahara changes him into his Shinigami form.

Realizing he is the Human who took Rukia's Shinigami powers, Renji, attacking him, asks Ichigo what the name of his Zanpakutō is. When Ichigo, stating he has not named his sword, asks if they actually give them names, Renji activates his
        Shikai

As Ichigo attempts to end the fight, Byakuya severs his sword's tip, leaving Ichigo stunned. As he prepares for Byakuya's subsequent attack, Byakuya, appearing behind him, stabs him.
        Falling to the ground, Ichigo, wondering whether he was attacked from the front or from behind, is stabbed again by Byakuya.
        As Byakuya and Rukia talk about Ichigo, he, grabbing Byakuya's leg, tells him not to talk about him as if he is dead. As Byakuya tells him to let go, Ichigo instructs the captain to look at him when he is talking so he can hear him. Kicking Ichigo's hand away from her brother, Rukia, telling him he should know his place, tells Byakuya she is ready to leave. As Ichigo protests, Renji tells him to stop making things worse. When Rukia tells Byakuya there is no point in deliberately killing Ichigo, as he will soon stop breathing on his own, Ichigo asks if this is a joke, prompting Rukia to state if he tries to follow her, she will never forgive him. As she tells him to conserve what energy he has left so he may live a moment longer, Byakuya, acquiescing to Rukia's request, states Ichigo should die shortly due to his injuries, but if he does survive, he will no longer possess any Shinigami powers. As they leave, Ichigo, noting he cannot move or speak, reflects upon how he came to protect Rukia, but instead she protected him again.
        As Ichigo contemplates his injuries in the rain, Urahara approaches him.

        When Ichigo awakens in Urahara's shop, Urahara tells him his wounds are not yet fully healed, and if he moves too much, he may die. When Ichigo asks him about Uryū's condition, Urahara states Uryū's injuries were treated on the spot, and when he left, he was worried about Ichigo, stating Ichigo was the only one who could beat the Shinigami and save Rukia. When Ichigo says he cannot do anything, as Rukia has been taken to Soul Society and he cannot follow, Urahara reveals he can send Ichigo there if he trains with Urahara for the next ten days, revealing Soul Society typically allows a grace period of one month before executions. Saying Ichigo will die if he goes there in his current condition, he reveals he purposely allowed Ichigo to fight Renji and Byakuya so he would realize this after having fought them himself. He states it will take seven days to open the gate to Soul Society, leaving Ichigo with thirteen days in Soul Society to rescue Rukia. Though unsure if he can become strong enough in ten days, Ichigo agrees to Urahara's deal.

        Giving Ichigo some pills to take every hour, Urahara, saying he will recover from his injuries by dinnertime, sends him to school for the final day of the term. At school, Ichigo notes how nobody appears to remember Rukia. As

        dismisses the class for summer, Ichigo, noting Uryū's absence, thinks he would remember Rukia. As he walks home after dismissing Keigo's invitation to spend the holiday with him, he meets Orihime, who, asking him where Rukia is, notes everyone has forgotten about her, but she believed Ichigo would know. Explaining the situation to her, Ichigo is surprised she can see his Shinigami form. Noting Ichigo has already made up his mind to rescue Rukia, Orihime, telling him to go save her, insists she does not want her friend to die either. Thanking her, Ichigo, going to the

        Ururu Tsumugiya
        attack Ichigo, and she lunges at him, creating a large cloud of dust and debris.
        Emerging from the dust, Ichigo runs away from Ururu after another near miss. Realizing he is able to run away from her, Ichigo attempts to dodge her attacks directly. Successfully dodging, Ichigo attacks Ururu by trying to hit her headgear lightly, believing the weight difference will do the rest. When he hits and cuts her face, Ururu kicks him into a rocky outcropping. Catching Ichigo before he hits it, Tessai cushions him from the impact.

        Congratulating him on clearing the lesson, Urahara asks if Ichigo is still having trouble breathing or moving, which he is not. As Urahara says he has successfully recovered his spirit energy, and the soul tends to gain the Reiryoku faster when it is in danger of being destroyed, Tessai, cutting Ichigo's
        Chain of Fate
        , pins him to the ground.
        Telling him the chain has already begun to corrode from the severed end, Urahara states if it reaches his chest, Ichigo will become a Hollow, but he can avoid this by becoming a Shinigami instead. The point of this lesson, which Urahara calls "
        Shattered Shaft
        ," is to restore Ichigo's Shinigami powers. Dropped to the bottom of a shaft, he is bound with a

        Revealing there is a gas at the bottom of the shaft which speeds up the corrosion process to at most 72 hours, he tells Ichigo to become a Shinigami and climb out of the hole before that, or else he will become a Hollow, and they will destroy him.

        After the corrosion of the chain's fifth link, Ichigo notes the process alternates between a few minutes of painful corrosion and a few hours of dormancy. Only able to attempt to escape during the dormant phases, Ichigo unsuccessfully tries to run up the wall. Asking him if he is hungry,
        Jinta Hanakari
        explains a soul feeling hungry is a sign they will soon become a Hollow. Later, as Ichigo wonders how long he has been in the hole for and how he can get out of it, Jinta runs down the shaft's wall with a platter of fruit for him. When Ichigo, denying he is hungry, says the chain is still long, Jinta reveals it has been seventy hours since he entered the shaft, and the final corrosion phase is stronger than the earlier ones. As the remaining length of the chain begins to corrode, a hole opens in Ichigo's chest, and a mask begins to form over his face.
        Urahara explains the mask forming before his body reforms shows Ichigo is resisting the transformation.

Revealing the first stage of loss brings intense pain, loss of consciousness, and a reverse flow of the time his body experienced in the Dangai, she further explains he lost his Shinigami powers at that point. In the second stage, his remaining Reiatsu stabilizes, he wakes up, and the remainder of his spiritual power completely disappears. Saying he expected this to happen, Ichigo, asking if he can go outside, notes he can no longer sense spiritual presences any more, and it is becoming harder to see Rukia. As Rukia starts to fade before his eyes, Ichigo, asking her to give his best regards to everyone, says goodbye and thanks her.

Telling Ichigo he cannot access his Zanpakutō's true power because it resides with Zangetsu, his inner Hollow offers to lend him his power as long as Ichigo agrees not to use his mask. As they fight, Ichigo learns Zangetsu wants to see how strong Ichigo can become, and if it is enough to defeat him. Using his inner Hollow's power, Ichigo defeats Zangetsu. After Muramasa disappears, Zangetsu, assuring Ichigo he has returned to normal, reveals Muramasa can forcibly unleash one's deepest instincts and warp them so one cares only about those desires, regardless of the consequences.

Shrugging off Riruka's complaints, Ichigo, saying he does not even understand the situation yet, asks how this will help him regain his Shinigami powers, and how he can suddenly use a power he has never used before. The yakuza says if he does not kill Ichigo within fifteen minutes, he will be trapped there permanently. After giving a brief explanation of Fullbring, Riruka leaves Ichigo, who, reflecting on what she said, thinks about how Kūgo transformed his pendant into a sword, concluding he should focus on something he regularly has with him. Arriving, Sado tells Ichigo to use his Substitute Shinigami Badge. Telling him he had just thought of it too, Ichigo holds his badge as the fifteen minutes expire and Mr. Pork, entering "Mad Beast Mode," grows in size.

        Sado tells Ichigo it was pride which allowed him to use his Fullbring. When Ichigo thinks of times he was proud to be a Shinigami, his badge begins to take the form of Tensa Zangetsu's tsuba.
        When Kūgo explains the badge recorded every battle Ichigo ever fought, a shocked Ichigo, testing out a variety of ways to use this new power, successfully launches a large amount of energy shaped like a manji at Mr. Pork, which defeats him. Ichigo wonders if the power will help him get his Shinigami powers back.
        At Ichigo's behest, Riruka restores him to his normal size. Briefly hearing a voice coming from the badge which he recognizes as Rukia's, Ichigo wonders what is happening.

When Ichigo asks if he is to stay for further training, he is told Fullbring puts more strain on the body than can be felt. Kūgo advises him not to push himself, as his body will fall to pieces if he wears himself out. Saying a few more days without his powers should be bearable after all this time, he promises to call him when he has recuperated. As Sado and Ichigo walk to Sado's home, the latter tells Ichigo Orihime has been bringing him leftover bread everyday lately. Ichigo tells him she is worried about him, and he should call her.

        Arriving to find Orihime kneeling in front of her door, they ask her if she is alright. Grabbing her shoulder, seeming distracted, Orihime, noticing Sado and Ichigo, asks why they are there. Hearing their explanation, Orihime tells them nothing happened, and she was with a friend before going into her apartment. As they leave, Ichigo asks Sado about Orihime.

        both suspect it is
        Shūkurō Tsukishima

        When they did so, he, killing the Shinigami and those who gave him their power, disappeared. Showing Ichigo a Substitute Shinigami Badge, he tells him he believes Tsukishima wants to keep Ichigo away from them, and is using his attacks on Uryū and Orihime to get his attention. He tells him to go home until they are ready for the

When they leave, Ichigo, contemplating Kūgo's warning about Urahara, wonders if he should follow them, but decides not to.

Ichigo fires an energy blast at her, only for Jackie to easily shatter it. Revealing he knows his attack's weakness, Ichigo uses Fullbring to increase his speed and attacks her. After being asked who taught him to fight, Ichigo explains he first learned from Urahara, but he learned from his battles as time went on, saying even though he was only a Shinigami for a brief time, he probably has more experience in battle than Xcution.

When Jackie says they will abort the training, as Ichigo's Fullbring is going berserk in a way she has never seen before, Ichigo is adamant in continuing. As Jackie calls for Kūgo to retrieve Riruka to end the training, Ichigo, pinning her to the ground, says his Fullbring is not going berserk and has always been like this. He believes this is his badge's way of telling him to hurry and get his Shinigami powers back soon. Believing it is too dangerous to continue, Jackie decides to stop him by force.

Stating if Tsukishima wanted to harm Xcution, he could have kept going, but it seems his objective is Ichigo, Kūgo tells Yukio to help with Ichigo's training.

Activating his own Fullbring, Kūgo, saying it would be great if they had rules like a video game, requests Yukio give them six HP each, prompting six crosses to appear above their heads. When Kūgo asks if Ichigo needs a tutorial, he, saying he understands, activates his Fullbring, and they charge at each other.

He notes while Tsukishima did not look at him, he felt his killing intent. He wonders if he cannot feel anything because they are not using Zanpakutō, or if it is because he does not fully trust Kūgo.

Kūgo explains when Ichigo lost his Reiatsu, a tiny portion accumulated in a single location inside of him over time, which is why they used the Reiatsu flowing from his badge to jolt that awake. He says all that is left to do is to beef up his new body and powers, and his Fullbring and Shinigami powers will fuse, giving Ichigo a power transcending that of a Shinigami. Taking his badge, Ichigo, trying out his new Fullbring, leaves Yukio's Fullbring, thanking him. Yukio states only 90 minutes have passed, thanks to his Fullbring's abilities.

As Ichigo makes yet another charge, Yhwach surrounds him in dark energy and states that Ichigo's powers are not rightfully his and it is time they return to their progenitor.
        With Ichigo continuing to rush into his torrent of dark energy, Yhwach wonders why Ichigo is not revealing his true power and notes that he will destroy both Soul Society and the Human World if not stopped.

As Ichigo lands on top of a pillar, he is stabbed by long shadowy blades from the wall behind him, causing him to grunt in pain as he falls to the ground below while wondering what is happening. Yhwach reveals that Ichigo made a miscalculation by believing that the future is linear and explains that it diverges in countless directions from a given point in time like grains of sand in the wind. As Yhwach tells him to keep fighting and not give in to despair, Ichigo decries the idea of falling into despair after he has broken through it so many times in order to reach this moment before activating his Bankai.

    Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant

   : Physically, Ichigo's Human body is in top form. Ichigo has been trained in martial arts since he was a small child, both professionally and by his father. He has repeatedly shown great agility and coordination in his attacks. In addition to having powerful kicks and punches, Ichigo is proficient in counterattacks, takedowns, and body locks. He has repeatedly caught an opponent's weapon strikes with a single hand.
   He effortlessly defeats multiple bullies and gangsters on a regular basis, and is a better martial artist than

   , who is officially ranked the second strongest fighter of her age group in all of Japan despite her fighting with a broken arm. Combined with his speed, he effortlessly knocked out three lieutenants in rapid succession, while bare-handed, with a single strike each before the first lieutenant even touched the ground.
   While he has stopped training, constant attacks from bullies and his father keep his skills fresh.

   : Even before learning Shunpo, Ichigo is a very fast and agile fighter. Ichigo possesses great reflexes, dodging a strike with no wasted effort and immediately counterattacking.
   He can strike quickly, without warning, and in rapid succession.
   His speed allows him to follow the movements of faster opponents to better analyze their movements, and block otherwise fatal strikes.
   Even when struck by surprise by

    Advanced Growth Rate
   </b>
   : According to both Aizen and Urahara, Ichigo's most astounding ability is his growth rate; he grasps the basic control of advanced techniques in days where it would take several years for even the most gifted Shinigami. Shortly after gaining Shinigami powers and with no previous training, he began learning advanced spiritual energy sensing techniques by sheer instinct. While it takes most Shinigami at least 10 years to achieve Bankai, he did so in two-and-a-half days (albeit with the assistance of a special device invented by Urahara which was originally intended for
   <i key="6ff2a06b-b6f4-48aa-b386-50b20ff09315">
    three
   </i>
   days).
   He gains considerable experience in the use of Shunpo while training with Yoruichi, which was done over the same period as his Bankai.
   Besides his improvements in his Shinigami abilities, Ichigo greatly increased the time he could maintain his Hollow mask, from eleven seconds to considerably longer amounts of time. During his first fight with Ulquiorra, he is instantly incapacitated by one Cero blast, even with his Hollow mask (which broke within a second), but only a few hours later, he withstands another Cero from Ulquiorra without undergoing Hollowfication, and can analyze Ulquiorra's movements much better than before, when he had "felt like [he] was fighting a machine or a statue" and failed to predict and counter his attacks.
   His latent abilities have been recognized by the

    Keen Intellect
   </b>
   : Despite his somewhat punkish attitude, Ichigo is analytical, perceptive, and deductive. In his high school, Ichigo's grades are almost always near the top, despite his work as a Substitute Shinigami. Aside from that, Ichigo can determine the pattern of his opponent's battle methods and form a proper counter-strategy to defeat his opponent's attacks.

    Immeasurable Spiritual Power
   </b>
   : Ichigo has been noted on several occasions to have tremendously vast levels of spiritual energy, well-beyond most other Shinigami.
   His spiritual power is noted to be heavy, which surprised Renji Abarai.
   Ichigo constantly gives off Reiatsu at the level of a captain.
   Even when worn-out in battle, he can continue fighting effectively while still using
   <b key="50ca84f4-a8e5-490e-afde-ce681164d148">
    Getsuga Tenshō
   </b>
   and his Bankai.
   Even at less than half strength, his spiritual energy is comparable to a captain-level fighter.
   His energy is strong enough to hold back the Sōkyoku, a halberd with the destructive force equivalent to one million Zanpakutō combined, using only his Zanpakutō.
   Even before his Dangai training, his spiritual energy was strong enough for him to be able to sense Aizen's increased Reiatsu as a result of his Second Fusion with the Hōgyoku while fighting Gin from a considerable distance away, despite his father, Urahara, and Yoruichi, all former
   Gotei 13
   Captains, being unable to do so themselves while fighting him directly.
   His Reiatsu is golden yellow in color.
   After his training at the Soul King Palace, Ichigo was able to overwhelm four Sternritter simultaneously
   and then calmly fight on par with a Sternritter using
   Quincy: Vollständig
   using just his Shikai and eventually overpower his foe.

    Spiritual Awareness
   </b>
   : Since he was a child, Ichigo has had an innate ability to clearly see spiritual beings and sense their presence. After becoming a Shinigami, his senses have continued to improve with time, learning various advanced sensing techniques, such as using a spirit ribbon to find Yūichi Shibata (in bird form).
   Even from a considerable distance, he can detect the condition of a being with spiritual power. During his intense fight against Kenpachi Zaraki, he clearly sensed and recognized Sado's energy signature even as it weakened, despite the considerable distance between them.

    Master Swordsman
   </b>
   : In terms of fighting style while in his Shinigami form, Ichigo relies mainly on swordplay. Aside from his initial training with Urahara, he is essentially on a "learn as you go" training regimen; thusly, his skill has developed by fighting rather than formal instruction, becoming even more capable with every fight. His overall skill allows him to fight evenly against sword masters of Byakuya Kuchiki and Kenpachi Zaraki's caliber. While usually fighting right-handed, Ichigo appears to be ambidextrous, as he is proficient in wielding Zangetsu in his left hand.
   Since attaining the true form of Zangetsu, he has displayed great skill at wielding both blades at once without any trouble.

    Shunpo Expert
   </b>
   : Though not particularly versed in its various techniques, Ichigo is proficient enough in the technique itself to keep up with and even surprise high-level Shinigami with his speed. Byakuya Kuchiki, one of the most proficient users of Shunpo in Soul Society, complimented Ichigo's growing mastery of the technique.
   During his first demonstration of this skill, he knocked out three lieutenants and grabbed his Zanpakutō before any of them hit the ground.
   After returning from the Soul King Palace, Ichigo has refined his skill in Shunpo, moving several miles in a single leap while simultaneously bypassing the perception of multiple Sternritter.

    Enhanced Strength
   </b>
   : When he is in his Shinigami body, Ichigo's already impressive strength is greatly enhanced. He has knocked out three Shinigami lieutenants with a single punch each, one of which shattered one of their Zanpakutō at the same time.
   His strength is great enough to easily stop repeated axe blows from
   Jidanbō
   before shattering Jidanbō's axes in a single swing, and hurl Rukia a dozen meters into Renji's arms and send them both skidding several meters more, achieving both feats with a single hand.
   With a single kick, he can break down and launch a large chunk of a stone wall.
   After regaining his Shinigami powers, one swing from his Zanpakutō produced a shockwave powerful enough to overwhelm

   When fighting Quilge Opie, Ichigo grabbed one of his Heilig Pfeil with his bare hand without sustaining any damage, despite the considerable explosion it caused when Ichigo threw it back.
   After returning from the Soul King Palace, Ichigo has increased in strength, allowing him to throw four Sternritter into separate buildings in rapid succession without any visible effort.

    Immense Endurance
   </b>
   : When in his Shinigami form, Ichigo's endurance is strengthened to the point where he can continue fighting effectively after receiving many injuries, and can survive attacks which would easily kill normal Humans. It was stated by Rukia that a Shinigami's life force is their spiritual power. As such, Ichigo can withstand attacks which would be fatal to most Shinigami.
   Uryū once stated Ichigo was a monster in this regard,
   and Aizen commented on his ability to continue moving despite grave injuries.

   : Ichigo becomes much more durable in his Shinigami form. During his last fight with Kūgo Ginjō, he withstood a direct hit from the Getsuga Tenshō created by his opponent, and the damage was only done to one of his arms and part of his face.
   When fighting Quilge Opie, Ichigo withstood the impact of several Heilig Pfeil fired at him, unharmed, despite the powerful explosion each one caused.
   Tenjirō Kirinji, a member of the Royal Guard, was amazed at Ichigo's ability to endure the unique healing properties of his

    , but instead wields one formed from his inherited fusion of his Shinigami/Hollow powers. Later, Zangetsu is personally reforged by
    Ōetsu Nimaiya
    , using an actual Asauchi. In his inner world, Ichigo, coming to terms with his heritage and powers, gains access to his true Zanpakutō, which had been suppressed all this time. His actual Zanpakutō takes the form of two separate, purely black
    blades. One is the size of his previous sword, once again in the shape of a khyber knife, with the grip at the base of the blade and a handle extending back from this about roughly the width and length of Ichigo's forearm. There is a thin, hollowed-out portion running along the back edge of the blade from the base to the middle of the blade. The second blade is relatively small, about the size of Ichigo's arm, and is similar to the first blade, but resembles a trench knife more than a sword. Unlike its counterpart, it has an enclosed handle, with a portion acting like a hand guard. Both blades represent a different facet of Ichigo's powers: the larger blade represents his
    inner Hollow
    (the manifestation of his Shinigami/Hollow powers) and the smaller blade represents "
    the old man
    " (the manifestation of his Quincy powers).
    After gaining his new Zanpakutō, Ichigo wraps the hilts of both swords in cloth, and now carries the larger blade on his back and the shorter blade on his right hip.

      ): When Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakutō was very similar in appearance to Rukia's sealed Zanpakutō
      but oversized, with an equally-oversized brown sheath hung by a strap across his back and over his right shoulder. It had a rectangular bronze tsuba with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short sides. The hilt's handle had a red wrapping and two light blue tassels attached to the handle's base, which was decorated with a flame design on its short sides. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he did not know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It could upturn the ground with a single strike.
      Because of the weak nature of its spiritual energy,
      Byakuya Kuchiki
      easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo, and

      subsequently sliced it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form. This sword is a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of Ichigo's own power.

        : The Shikai form of Zangetsu resembles an oversized
         khyber knife
         instead of a formal katana. It has no tsuba and no proper hilt; what Ichigo holds is the cloth-wrapped tang. The sword is about as tall as Ichigo is,
         and has a black blade with a silver edge. The cloth wrapping on the tang seems to react to Ichigo's will, changing length at a thought or twining about the blade in an impromptu sheath. When in combat, the cloth falls away when necessary, shrinking back to a manageable size.
         The cloth can be used to swing the weapon like a
         flail
         and to toss it at opponents for mid-range combat,
         as well as bandage wounds,
         but these are done rarely. Ichigo has, on more than one occasion, used Zangetsu's wide blade as a shield from incoming attacks,
         and for deflecting energy attacks.
         Unlike most Zanpakutō, which can be sealed into their original form, Zangetsu is always in its Shikai form.

        ): Ichigo points his Zanpakutō in a straight direction, using either a single hand or both of his hands, with the cloth of his Shikai surrounding his arm and tightening during the activation. His spiritual power surges, with the smoke obscuring his being.
         It is considered completely out of the ordinary for any Zanpakutō. Unlike most Bankai forms, which usually create some sort of massive creature or effect, Ichigo's Bankai shrinks his sword down to a
         daitō
         (Japanese long sword) with a black blade instead. The cross guard has four prongs bent out to form the shape of the manji (which is the kanji for "ban," meaning "full," as in "full release"). The blade itself can endure even the strongest of attacks, making it quite effective in blocking and deflecting incoming attacks.
         It can withstand getting crushed by force.
         The blade is strong and sharp enough to cut clean through

         Commenting on the blade's strength and durability,
         Gin Ichimaru
         claimed it felt like his was about to break from hitting it.
         Instead of the cloth his Shikai form had, a short length of chain with a broken link at the end dangles from the base of the hilt. In addition to his sword, Ichigo's robe is replaced with a long-sleeved, ankle-length black coat (or shihakushō) with red lining, which is closed at his chest and left to flare out into ragged ends, much like that of Zangetsu himself.
         This coat is part of Ichigo's Bankai, and the damage it can take is directly proportionate to the remaining strength and level of Ichigo's Reiatsu.

       Initially, Ichigo's Fullbring powers focused on changing the form of his Substitute Shinigami Badge.
       By recalling the memories of his pride as a Shinigami, Ichigo causes the badge to release black Reiatsu in the shape of the tsuba of

       Like a tsuba, the weapon is used primarily for defense, particularly to block attacks. It can absorb most of the impact from a much larger opponent's attack.
       Like a real tsuba, it has no cutting power, and if Ichigo releases his hold on the badge, the Reiatsu dissipates.

       Later, his Fullbring powers evolve so they change his appearance, covering his whole body in a black Reiatsu, and produce a dark blade, forming over his arm.
       His abilities are classified as a Clad-Type Fullbring because Ichigo is shrouded in his own power, which resembles a Shihakushō, much like his former Bankai.

       After Ichigo's Fullbring is completed, it transforms into a solid outfit. It becomes a white armor covering his chest, arms, shoulders, and feet, with a stripe running across his face. Underneath this, he wears a completely black bodysuit. The badge grows a medium-sized, black, machete-like blade, with a silver edge, round hilt, simple white cloth-wrapping, and flat base. The badge itself becomes the guard, with a new black cross marking on it. It is hung across Ichigo's back in a white sheath.

        .
        By charging up this attack, the tsuba becomes bigger and more jagged, with six bars, before launching a larger blast.
        The attack is flawed, due to its inconsistent power. Its power is determined by the number of blades in it, six being the maximum. If fired in succession, the number of blades decrease, with the attack becoming more fragile with each one it loses. If the attack has anything less than three blades, it can be shattered with ease. Ichigo and
        Jackie Tristan
        both conclude if he fires three shots in a row, he leaves himself wide open to attack.
        With his completed Fullbring, Ichigo can produce the Reiatsu tsuba from his sword's guard-badge and fire a barrage of these blades with a single swing, with each one apparently retaining full power, as none lose any blades. Similar to

        Ichigo can draw on the souls of concrete and solid air in order to propel himself higher and at faster speeds.
        With his complete Fullbring unleashed, Ichigo's speed is enhanced even further, as he got behind Tsukishima and cut off his left arm before he could even attack him.
        Similar to his Bankai, Ichigo's speed is great enough to produce dozens of afterimages to confuse his enemy.

       Because Ichigo's inner Hollow took a new form while facing
       Ulquiorra Cifer
       ,
       Ichigo's mask has changed again. Where his mask once had a series of thick red stripes which covered almost the entire left half of his mask, there are now only two thick vertical black stripes, each on one half of the mask, which are interrupted by the widened eye-holes and the jaw.

      <p key="a2bce92f-61ff-4261-b6c1-93429316f895">
       The Hollow mask was originally a sign of Ichigo's possession by his inner Hollow, but after his training with the Visored, it merely indicates he is utilizing his Hollow powers. To access his inner Hollow's power, Ichigo must summon the mask onto his face. He normally does this by placing one of his hands over his face, and concentrating spiritual matter on it in order to manifest the mask (previously, it had appeared on its own before he mastered the Hollow within him), summoning the mask in a "ripping" fashion. With the mask in place, Ichigo's eyes irises become yellow, and he has black sclera and pupils. His voice has a slight Hollow echo to it. With the mask, he gains access to increased physical enhancements. Strangely, though most of the other Visored have been able to shift the position of the mask while apparently still retaining the abilities of their Hollowfied state, as well as using general Hollow abilities, Ichigo has never done either.

         Hollow Combat

        : When Ichigo fights with his mask on, his fighting style becomes more instinctive than practiced. The Hollow mask makes Ichigo more ruthless, akin to the battle style of
        Hollow Ichigo
        . Throughout the duration of the Hollowfication, Ichigo displays less concern for injuries to his person, even ignoring grievous wounds to continue fighting.
        Ulquiorra Cifer stated Ichigo in this form resembles an

         Increased Mask Duration
        </b>
        : After subjugating his inner Hollow, Ichigo can use his Hollow mask while retaining his personality, but could originally only wear it for four seconds at a time.
        After
        training with the Visored
        , the limit increases to eleven seconds.
        His time limit and Hollow powers greatly increase during his
        third battle with Grimmjow
        . The reasons behind Ichigo now being capable of fighting entire battles with his mask currently remain unknown. Grimmjow speculated Ichigo's improvements came from a subconscious need.
        It is unknown if the time limit of his new mask has changed, though the mask began deteriorating immediately after he fired a

         Mask Re-Summon

        : He can call his mask out a second time after it shatters. When used for the first time, the mask immediately broke apart.
        Later, this is no longer a problem. In his first fight with Ulquiorra, though unseen, it was used to help defend against Ulquiorra's Cero,
        and again during his most recent confrontation with him, after he enters his released form.
        Once Ichigo's mask changed in his battle with
        Yammy Llargo
        , he noticed his mask felt different, as if it was heavier, and he was unable to re-summon it for a brief period of time.
        Tensa Zangetsu
        states the oddities of the new mask come from Ichigo's fear of the Hollow form he took to defeat Ulquiorra, where his sanity was overwhelmed by its power, and he cannot Hollowify properly.
