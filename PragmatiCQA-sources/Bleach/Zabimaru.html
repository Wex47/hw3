   Renji has brown eyes and long crimson hair, which is usually kept in a high ponytail. As a child, Renji's hairline was leveled. Later, he styled it in a large widow's-peak. His upper body is covered in tribal tattoos, which have increased over time, starting from his early days as an academy student
   to covering his entire back, much of his chest, his extremities, and even much of his forehead.
   He wears a standard Shinigami outfit, though he usually includes some sort of headgear, usually expensive glasses, or a white headband when he is saving up to purchase some new glasses. Despite being of appropriate rank, Renji does not wear his Division's lieutenant badge. While out of uniform, Renji often wears a white kimono-like type of night clothing, with pink floral patterns on it, and a dark grey sash tied around his waist. It has also been said "that the women within his Division do not mind that he usually walks around in his night clothing."
  </p>
  <p key="2c3e4a35-e13c-427a-93d6-f2c04212cb94">
   Seventeen months after Aizen's defeat, Renji's hair has grown longer and he wears a maroon colored bandanna covering all of the tattoos on his forehead.
   He also wears long dark straps on each wrist with bandages over his arms.
  </p>
  <p key="c9ceaabb-12ba-41e8-9a1f-93d2df123e53">
   Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Renji's hairstyle changes drastically. He now sports a long braid instead of a ponytail.

  <p key="e2502dd9-63bc-4af0-bc3e-970f9bc0362c">
   Renji is quite dynamic. His personality varies from smug and cocky to disquieted and depressed after a major defeat, but shows himself to be an incredibly serious and determined fighter when confronted with an actual threat. Willing to fight, kill, and die for whatever he believes in, Renji is a dangerous man to those who stand in his way.

   .
   Renji is determined to surpass his captain,
   Byakuya Kuchiki
   , and it's this determination that drives Renji to grow stronger. Renji likes
   taiyaki
   (a popular fish-shaped pancake usually filled with sweet bean paste), and has a dislike for spicy food.
   Renji also likes
   futsal
   , and in his free time works on assembling a team from the 6th Division, with success, more or less. The current members are himself,
   Rikichi Yuki
   , and the 4th, 8th, 13th, and 20th seated officers.

   All of Renji's sunglasses are purchased from
   Seireitei
   's popular
   Gin Tonbo
   store and cost half a year's worth of his pay check. However, every time he wears a pair, they are broken in one way or another.
   On these occasions, he replaces them with a tied white bandana, until he can purchase a new pair of goggles. His dream is to wear a pair that he himself designed at least once.

        tripped the adult and urged Renji's group to follow her to avoid losing the water. Rukia joined their group and they lived together as a family. They all hated Inuzuri and the people there. Renji disliked the fact that Rukia had spiritual power like he did. Ten years after Rukia joined their group, with all of their friends dead, Rukia proposed that they become

        with ease, where they struggled to prove their worth among those from
        noble families
        .
        The night before the welcoming ceremony for the new students of the Academy, Renji slept in a tree, against Rukia's advice. The following morning, he fell out of the tree and landed on a headstone where a startled

When Momo joined them, Renji kicked Izuru because of how he greeted her, saying that he should not let his emotions show so easily. While in the Human World, Renji remarked that Konsō was a lot easier than he had imagined. He then lost his temper with the constantly fidgeting Izuru and punched him.
        As Shūhei called an end to their field trip, the group was attacked by a

When a second Huge Hollow appeared, Momo stopped and questioned why they were running away. Renji reminded Momo that the Hollow had just killed two sixth year students. When Momo rushed back towards Shūhei, Renji and Izuru followed her and helped to block the second Hollow's attack on him. When more Huge Hollows showed up, they were saved by the arrival of

        Having passed an important exam, Renji rushed to find Rukia to tell her. However, when he found her, she was with several Shinigami, including
        Byakuya Kuchiki
        . As they left, Renji noted Byakuya's power, causing him to wonder who he was. Renji asked what they wanted and congratulated Rukia when she told him that they want to have her adopted into the
        Kuchiki Clan
        , have her graduate immediately and assigned to the
        13th Division
        . Rukia thanked him and left. Renji told himself that Rukia finally had a family and that he should stay out of it.
        After Rukia left, Renji trained every day in a bid to beat Byakuya, but he was unable to defeat him even once.

        Forty years after Rukia's adoption into the Kuchiki Clan, in mid-April, Momo and Izuru presented Renji with a letter stating that he was to be promoted to lieutenant of the 6th Division. He formally accepted Momo's words, which caused her to tell him not to be so uptight. Ikkaku told him that he was now a step closer to Rukia and that his will has been strong for forty years, but now that he was a lieutenant, they should return to the type of relationship that they once shared. Izuru informed Renji that Rukia was leaving on a mission to the Human World that afternoon. When Momo urged him to hurry, Renji told her that he would wait until his promotion was made official a month later, and that when she returned, he would surprise her with it.
        On the 19th of July, Renji was sent alongside his captain to arrest Rukia and return her to Soul Society.

While she is distracted by Byakuya, Renji attacks her, but lets her escape, saying that giving her powers to a Human is a very serious sin for a Shinigami and that they have been appointed to kill the Human. Renji tells her not to try to protect the Human and that his next attack will be serious, but he is interrupted by

He ridicules Ichigo for showing up when Rukia was trying to protect him. Ichigo uses the moment to attack Renji, cutting his chin. Byakuya chastises him for being careless and reveals that according to their undercover forces, Ichigo had inflicted a scar upon a

Ichigo instead gets up and continues to fight, becoming more powerful, much to Renji's surprise. Ichigo quickly defeats Renji and as he tries to deliver a finishing blow, he is struck down by Byakuya.
   Awed by Byakuya's abilities, Renji wonders how Ichigo became so powerful so suddenly. Renji stops Rukia from running to the defeated Ichigo's side, telling her that there is no point in her getting into more trouble over a dead person. Rukia protests that it is her fault that he is dead, surprising Renji. When Ichigo grabs Byakuya's leg, Renji is stunned that he is still alive.

   Byakuya later returns and reveals that Central 46 has decided that Rukia will be executed in 25 days time, stunning Renji. After Byakuya leaves, Rukia tries to cheer Renji up by saying that she is alright, as it only makes her more determined to escape and makes fun of his tattooed eyebrows, angering him. Renji leaves, truly saddened and noting that it is not possible for her to escape and that she will be executed. He wonders if this is truly okay with Captain Kuchiki.

As Aizen looks around the room, he notes that they have not spoken since Renji's transfer to the 11th Division and asks if he is now in the 6th Division. Renji inquires what it is that he wants to talk about. Aizen reveals that he is aware that Rukia and Renji were close friends and asks if he thinks that she really deserves to be executed. He then reveals that there are a number of unusual aspects to her arrest and execution, claiming that there is a conspiracy. Shocked, Renji asks what he means, but they are interrupted when Aizen is called to an emergency captains' meeting.

        That night, Renji and the other lieutenants are shocked to hear an alarm announcing that there are intruders inside Seireitei.

        Ichigo barely dodges Renji's finishing blow,
        and grabs Zabimaru. He tells Renji that he is sorry for keeping him waiting as his Reiatsu begins to increase dramatically. Renji is hit by a point-blank unnamed Getsuga Tenshō which breaks Zabimaru and badly injures him.
        Renji, wondering what happened and how he lost, grabs Ichigo and admits that getting Rukia back is an impossible dream for him. He also admits that not only was he wrong for blaming Ichigo but also that the one he truly blames for Rukia's impending death sentence was himself for inadvertently pushing her towards that path because he was too focused on her happiness of getting a real family.

        After Aizen's escape, Renji is treated by the Fourth Division.
        A week later, Renji waits in the hospital with a recovering Byakuya. When Byakuya asks if Renji wished that he was dead, Renji replies that he does not, and that if he were to die, then he would no longer have a reason to become stronger.

        At some point after the defection of Aizen, Gin, and Tōsen, Renji asks Ikkaku to become a captain, but he refuses. Renji tries to convince Ikkaku that he is the only one who can fill the void left by the loss of the three captains and that he should replace one of them as captain. Ikkaku reminds Renji that he once told him that he did not want anyone other him and Yumichika to know about his Bankai. Ikkaku tells him that just as he wishes to surpass Byakuya, Ikkaku's wish is to fight and die under

He admits to avoiding Renji so that he did not have to answer his questions and proposes that if Renji does the chores at the shop for three months, he will answer any questions that Renji has.

As they continue to train, Urahara tells Orihime that she should stay out of battle, as Renji tells Sado that Urahara is correct, stating that the

        The following day, Renji and the others gather in Orihime's home where they learn of her disappearance from Captain Ukitake. When Captain-Commander Yamamoto states that Orihime has most likely joined Aizen's side of her own free will, Renji stops Ichigo from protesting, saying that he will only make it worse. He requests permission to for the team to travel to Hueco Mundo to retrieve Orihime. Yamamoto, however, denies this request and orders them to return to Soul Society. Renji is surprised to see Byakuya and

        After breaking through the wall, Renji notices that there is wind coming through the hole. As the group run through the breach, Renji uses Kidō to illuminate the area, but he is only able to produce a small light, prompting taunts from Uryū, Rukia, and Ichigo. To Renji's dismay, they emerge at a junction of five pathways. When Ichigo disagrees with Rukia's suggestion that they split up, saying that they stand a better chance against the
        Espada
        if they stay together, Renji tells him to be quiet, insisting that showing concern for a warrior's life in battle is an insult to the warrior. As they prepare to split up, Renji decides to recite a chant before they go any further. Saying that it is a Gotei 13 tradition that is falling out of fashion, he insists that it is appropriate and that they should do it, despite thinking that it is lame. After swearing that they will meet up again, they each go their separate ways.

Startled, Renji asks what he is doing there. Dondochakka replies that he was searching for Nel, prompting Renji to say that he is a lost child, and that if Nel went after Ichigo, she is safer than anywhere else. The two start to bicker with each other as Renji continues to run from him.
        Upon sensing Nel's Reiatsu, Dondochakka throws Renji over his shoulder and then slams him into the ground head first. Dondochakka then notices that Pesche is not with him. Renji tells him that Pesche has not been with him since the start, correcting him when he misunderstands what Renji meant by this.

As Szayelaporro talks to them, Renji interrupts him, saying that he came there to fight Szayelaporro and his allies. Renji activates his Bankai, but it explodes. Szayelaporro explains to a stunned Renji that he cannot use his Bankai in this room as he had set up a mechanism that would prevent its activation, using information from his brother,
        Yylfordt Granz

        When Szayelaporro neutralizes Uryū's bow, Renji blocks an attack aimed at him and asks the Quincy if he can find any way to counter Szayelaporro's abilities. When Uryū replies that there is, Renji beats back one of the Fracción and tells Uryū that he will trust him.
        At Uryū's request, Renji attempts to hold Szayelaporro's attention by wrapping himself and Szayelaporro with Zabimaru, tying the two together. Explaining that Kidō is not one of his strong points, Renji uses Hadō #31,
        Shakkahō
        at point-blank range, injuring them both. Szayelaporro staggers into a trap laid by Uryū
        and is engulfed in an explosion. As Uryū and Renji exchange pleasantries, Szayelaporro emerges from the smoke and eats one of his Fracción to heal himself, stunning his opponents. Szayelaporro then leaves the chamber to change clothes, much to Renji's surprise.

        After explaining that he rearranged the corridors, Szayelaporro uses his
        Resurrección
        and creates quasi-clones of his opponents.
        As they struggle to tell the quasi-clones apart from the originals, Renji dodges an attack from Dondochakka and rebukes him for it, only to be kicked by Pesche. Uryū stops the three from bickering and reveals the differences that he has noticed between the replicas and themselves, leaving the three stunned that they had not noticed the large differences. Renji notes that it is a big mistake and questions Szayelaporro's intelligence, but the Espada hears him and explains the reasons for these differences. While listening to this, Renji fends off an attack by one of his duplicates and tells Uryū that the chamber is too small to fight with so many opponents. Realizing that the quasi-clones are mimicking his attacks, Renji activates his Bankai, a move which his duplicates replicate, destroying the structure. After Uryū compares him to Ichigo, Renji remarks that it does not sound like praise when Ichigo's name is mentioned. Uryū comments that he was actually insulting him, but Renji simply states that Dondochakka and Pesche should be alright, but to watch out for Szayelaporro, who duly emerges and destroys the duplicates.

        Renji comments that it does not feel good seeing himself explode, even if it is a fake. Following Uryū's example, Renji tries to attack the Espada, but they are blocked by two of his Fracción. As Uryū is ensnared by Szayelaporro's wings, Renji notices the Espada producing a doll of the Quincy. Renji is stunned when Szayelaporro uses the doll to inflict injuries on Uryū and tries to attack, but is also caught by Szayelaporro's wing.
        Szayelaporro uses his newly-created Renji doll to crush several of Renji's internal organs, before the lieutenant finally collapses when his

     Encouraged by this, he blocks an attack from the snake end of his Zanpakutō. Zabimaru is surprised, and Renji states that his current weakness is irrelevant, because he will get stronger no matter what it takes. Renji says "Howl Zabimaru," and surprisingly, his Zanpakutō goes into Shikai state.

Being surprisingly crafty, Renji begins relying on Kidō despite his limited control on rapid usage. Renji then takes advantage of Zabimaru's overconfidence by using his Shikai's special attack to finally defeat his Zanpakutō and return them to normal.

     Following Muramasa's defeat, the Shinigami are given a day off to recover and party. Renji, although happy his captain has returned, decides to let Byakuya do as he pleases. Renji also notes to how much the Seireitei has already been repaired, to which Rukia proudly stated it was thanks to Kuchiki Clan.
     The fun is short-lived, however, as several rogue Zanpakutō Spirits, called "
     Tōjū
     ", begin attacking Soul Society. After several of them escape to the Human World, Renji is one of the Shinigami sent to take care of the problem. To increase their numbers, Renji has the spirits of Zabimaru remove their chain to move independently. However, the childish Hebi half becomes too interested in having fun in the Human World to be of any help against the Tōjū. When Hebi decides he does not want to return to being a normal sword for Renji (after being tricked by a Tōjū), he runs off. While the Saru half of Zabimaru is worried, Renji insists that Hebi should be allowed to deal with this on his own. Later, the same Tōjū attacks Hebi. Renji arrives in time to save Hebi and deal with Tōjū.

     After forcing Inaba to flee, Renji initiates the Gotei 13's meeting in Ichigo's room in which they discuss Inaba. When Kon races to find out where
     Nozomi Kujō

     Reigai
     counterpart of Rangiku is about to finish off Nozomi, Renji intervenes alongside Rukia and Ichigo, forcing her into a retreat. He then joins the others at the barbecue.

     Renji, along with the other lieutenants, searches for Nozomi when she goes missing once more.
     He comes across Sado and the Reigai version of himself battling and decides to get involved. Using their teamwork, the two are able to defeat Reigai-Renji so that he reverts back to a red pill. Renji comments that he feels odd defeating himself and that the pill is no ordinary Gikon.
     Later, Renji joins the others as Urahara gathers information on the situation in Soul Society.
     After Ichigo disappears, Sado asks if they should go to Soul Society, but Rukia and Renji say they should trust in the captains.

     When Urahara says that he still cannot detect Ichigo's Reiatsu, Renji asks if it means he is dead, but Urahara says that he cannot say. As everyone worries, Renji says he is the most worried, prompting a fight. Later, when Urahara detects Reiatsu like Ichigo's he asks Renji to accompany him.
     Renji goes with Urahara into the Dangai where they find Ichigo and bring him back. As Ichigo awakens, he yells out, only to find Renji and the others sitting before him. Ichigo asks Renji if he was the one who rescued him, but Renji says no.

     Renji participates in a meeting with the other Shinigami and Ichigo's friends where they are updated on the situation. Later, he reports to Ichigo, Sado, Rukia and Uryū, who are training Nozomi that the enemy is attacking. He states that they need to bring Nozomi to somewhere safe, but she tells Renji that if the Reigai are coming, then there is no safe place and she needs to regain her Shikai. Seeing that the others agree, Renji reluctantly decides to help too. Eventually, their efforts help Nozomi release her Shikai.

     Afterwards, Renji joins the battle. There, he is aided by Rukia as they face the Reigai-Byakuya. Despite their combined efforts, they are easily forced back by their opponent and they regroup with their allies. Seeing how bad the situation is, it is hesitantly decided to rely on Nozomi's Reiatsu-absorbing Shikai. They all launch their attacks at Nozomi, who then uses the collected energy to defeat all the Reigai, except for Reigai-Byakuya who uses the "

     Unable to get up, Renji is forced to watch as Nozomi and Ichigo fight the captain Reigai and later Inaba. This effort costs Ichigo too much energy, causing him to plummet to the ground. Renji manages to get up and catch him.
     Determined to stop Inaba, Renji joins Rukia and Ichigo. As Ichigo voices his refusal to let Inaba take Nozomi as she doesn't want to go with him, Inaba states that it is laughable they act like they understand her. He declares that he and Nozomi are created from the Reiatsu of the same Shinigami. Renji joins Ichigo and Rukia in charging at Inaba, only to be quickly defeated in their weakened state.

     Ultimately, Inaba succeeds in capturing Nozomi, and in the process destroying the remainder of Ichigo's powers. After getting his wounds treated by Unohana, Renji insists that they attack Inaba while he is still injured. Unohana, however, voices that they cannot attack so reckless with several high-ranking Shinigami, including Yamamoto, currently incapacitated. Later, Renji joins Rukia (in his Gigai) to check on Ichigo. While Ichigo tries to act calm about losing his powers, it is clear how pained he is by this. Renji and the others then go to Urahara's to discuss the situation. Renji listens as Kisuke theorizes that they can restore Ichigo's power by using the remaining Reishi instead the Kōtotsu, which shocks him. Renji is present when Ichigo successfully returns from the Dangai.

     Afterwards, Renji and the others agree to act as diversions through the Dangai while Ichigo and Kisuke sneak into Soul Society. Inside the Dangai, they are confronted by two Reigai, who realize that they are decoys and withdraw.
     Later while waiting for news from Kisuke, Renji and the others become concerned. After some convincing from the Tessai and the healed Shinigami, Renji and the others decide to go to Soul Society. There, they find that Ichigo has again transformed into a Hollow and has been subdued by
     a man
     who bares a resemblance to both Inaba and Nozomi. The man, Yushima, quickly displays his incredible power by completely overwhelming Renji and the others.

She then stomps the ground, causing the rock formations nearby to topple, while telling Renji that he'd better drawn his sword.

He then accepts Ichibē's offer to be personally trained by him.
        During his training with Ichibē, the Royal Guard member reveals that Zabimaru has only partly acknowledged Renji and has not shared the true name of its Bankai to him, leaving Renji surprised. Determining Renji to now be strong enough and worthy of wielding Zabimaru's true Bankai, Ichibē teaches him its name.

   Before becoming a lieutenant, his skills were great enough to fight on par with Ikkaku's Shikai and earn the rank of 6th Seat Officer in the 11th Division. Renji is able to hold his own against captain-level fighters, and is one of the only lieutenants to have attained Bankai.

     Whip Mastery
    </b>
    : What makes Renji so effective in battle is the unique method in which his Zanpakutō operates; Zabimaru is an amalgamation of a whip and a sword. Renji is a versatile fighter because of this, and to effectively wield it is a testament to his skill.
    Renji has stated that Zabimaru is an extension of his body, like his arms and legs, and he has used it in a variety of ways. He can use its extension ability to attack an opponent from behind, or either the left or right, without giving away the variation of his attack until it is too late. He has considerable skill in using his extension capabilities to constrict opponents, surrounding them from various angles and then retracting Zabimaru in order to crush his adversaries.

   : Knowing that Zabimaru's Shikai attacks leave him open to counter-attacks, Renji has become very proficient in Shunpo to compensate for this weak point.
   Renji can even keep up with captain-level Shinigami for an indeterminate amount of time. He knows enough to be informed on their higher level techniques.

   , Renji showed poor skill in Kidō.
   Later, he is skilled enough in the use of the level 31 Shakkahō spell without incantation, but has difficulty using it in rapid succession, as some will explode on him indiscriminately.
   He also uses a low-level Bakudō spell to restrain multiple targets (albeit they were all unseated officers).
   Renji also has enough knowledge of Kidō to manipulate it for purposes other than fighting, such as using his Shakkahō spell to illuminate the dark corridors of Las Noches. However, he is only able to create a small light without reciting the full chant.

    Great Spiritual Power
   </b>
   : Being a lieutenant of the Gotei 13, Renji originally possessed high spiritual energy. Upon learning Bankai, this power increased on a scale from 5-10, with Rukia commenting that it was so high, she could not recognize it until it decreased by the end of Renji's fight against Byakuya, which caused it to become more familiar to her.
   This spiritual power significantly increased again when
   Kirio Hikifune
   provides him with her Reiatsu-induced food, with her noting that his power is completely different from what it was before.
   This is proven when Renji overpowers Mask, a captain-level combatant who previously defeated Renji soundly,
   with his Shikai alone during their second encounter.
   His Reiatsu is light red in color.

    Enhanced Strength

   : Renji possesses great physical strength. When he swings Zabimaru toward Ichigo in their second fight, he easily tosses him into the air, and subsequently pushes him through an entire building about a dozen meters away with relative ease.
   During the fight with Szayelaporro's unique

    Fracción
   </a>
   , Renji protects Uryū from a direct punch from one of the stronger Arrancar, using both hands, before throwing him aside.
   Later, by spinning Zabimaru above his head, Renji creates enough force to generate a whirlwind, blowing all of Szayelaporro's Fracción several yards away, despite their massive size. Szayelaporro stated this was a result of Renji's "brute force."
   Later, after seventeen months of training following Aizen's defeat, Renji's raw strength allows him to nonchalantly block Jackie's strongest Fullbring-enhanced strike, which had enough force to unearth a large portion of the ground with the shockwave, with just the back of his wrist, and effortlessly knock her out with a simple blow to her stomach using the hilt of his sword.
   After training with the Royal Guard, Renji's strength increased to the point where he created a large crater by elbowing
   Mask De Masculine
   in the back of the head
   and stopped Mask's

   : During his fight with Byakuya, Renji is hit directly by every blade from Senbonzakura Kageyoshi, and when he continues to fight he is pierced by five more blades.
   Even after such terrible damage, he makes a last ditch effort attack, almost piercing Byakuya with Zabimaru, and finally falls defeated.
   He had enough confidence in his resiliency to use a full-power Hadō #31 on Szayelaporro at point-blank range, willingly taking damage as well,
   and later withstood having several of his internal organs crushed by Szayelaporro's

At will, Renji can extend a large blade from the snake’s mouth. Renji also gains a large cowl of green fur that hangs down from his left shoulder.

     We at this moment head into the decisive battle. Have faith that our blades will not shatter. Have faith that our hearts will not waiver. And even if our paths should diverge, we all share a heart of iron. Swear that even if the ground beneath us should be rent asunder we will live and return to this place again.

     Listen. I'm only going to say this because you're the only one here to hear it. All this time, for almost as long as I can remember...decades at least, Rukia and I were separated by a distance so great, we couldn't even glimpse one another. But the one who brought us back together was you. That's why I decided. Whenever you found yourself unable to go on, I'd take you onward myself. Carry you if I had to. That's what I've done up to now, and I'll keep on doing it. Forever, until the day you die.
