   Ukitake is a tall man with a somewhat emaciated appearance, caused by an illness which occasionally causes him to cough up blood. Because of his illness, he often spends his time recuperating at Ugendō, his family's estate. During one of his attacks when he was much younger, his hair turned white over a three-day period. This is why his eyebrows are black, the color his hair used to be.

  <p key="a0c80c24-e5fa-4d13-91b3-b3445afb4534">
   110 years ago, he wore his hair in a long ponytail. Currently his hair is worn long, almost reaching his waist. He wears it parted on the left side with one long piece that tends to fall over his right eye. He has green eyes.
   Ukitake wears the standard Shinigami uniform with a long sleeved captain's haori, and a crimson lining. He wears a narrow white obi, in which he secures his Zanpakutō.

   He refuses to give up when he believes something is wrong and will break a rule to do what is right.
   He is also quite perceptive, as seen when he analyzes the various disturbances caused in Soul Society,
   and has the ability to correctly judge people's character, as noted by Yamamoto, and knows when they are lonely. He observes that, before meeting

   Due to his long-standing position with the Gotei 13, Ukitake is one of the most proficient combatants in Soul Society and always maintains a level of honor and integrity when engaging in battle, much like his best friend Shunsui. He refuses to fight with a child or even in the presence of a child, even if that child is an Arrancar.
   He always maintains a semblance of respect for his opponent and is polite in combat situations. He also has a high measure of mercy, never taking the chance to kill Lilynette, but rather actually try to teach her how to be a better fighter, even though she was an enemy.

        . However Kaien continued to fight the creature with his bare hands. Eventually, the battle started to turn against Kaien, causing Rukia to try and assist him. Jūshirō stopped Rukia from assisting, explaining that Kaien was fighting for his honor. The Hollow's abilities allowed it to possess Kaien and Jūshirō began to fight it, but his illness got in the way and allowed the Hollow to attack Rukia. But at that moment, to both Jūshirō and Rukia's horror, Kaien took control and impaled himself upon Rukia's sword, thanking the captain for understanding the value of his honor and that of his wife's.

    After hearing of the execution date being moved up, Jūshirō tries to convince Byakuya to do something, but the noble seemed uncaring that his sister is dying sooner rather than later, and in the stress of the situation, Jūshirō shortly succumbs to his illness.
    Jūshirō decides to help save Rukia and tries to request a hearing with Central 46, but upon being turned down, sets out to help using other means.

He tells her that he understands that she's in a rush to get there, but in times like these it's good to be patient. Rukia tells Orihime that she will go ahead and wait for her and leaves.

         Ukitake then tells her as she is just a child, she has no place in the battle, which enrages Lilynette to the point where she screams at him and says Arrancar don't have ages. Ukitake explains that he can't fight since she looks like a little kid to him. He further tells her if she tries to fight him, he will force her to leave, and that she should "

        Lilynette feels Ukitake is patronizing her and proceeds to draw her Zanpakutō. She then tells him she will fight him. Ukitake appears somewhat annoyed at this.
         Ukitake blocks Lilynette's attacks with his Zanpakutō while looking fairly unamused at her futile attempts.
         She then blasts him with a

        , which he just blocks with his forearm. He then comments on how he has seen many Cero blasts in his time, and her's is immature at best and not even on par with a Menos. He then tells her to go home, as he doesn't wish to fight her any longer.

        They continue fighting until Ukitake manages to steal her Zanpakutō. He continually avoids her attempts to recover it, all the while chiding her for not putting her heart into her attacks.
         When Starrk finally calls back Lilynette, so as to release his true form, Kyōraku, sensing that the true battle is about to begin, throws his kimono to Ukitake and informing him that they were now "fighting for keeps". Ukitake then watches in shock as the Primera releases his true power and Kyōraku releases his own Zanpakutō.

        After watching the battle unfold between Shunsui and Starrk, Ukitake releases his Shikai and jumps in front of Shunsui. He uses a huge energy blast to negate Starrk's Cero Metralleta. Starrk side steps the blast and wonders if it was a Cero.

        Shunsui begins to speak, but Ukitake cuts him off explaining that he shouldn't complain because the Arrancar are double teaming him and his coming to his aid is only fair. Ukitake then comments that besides that Shunsui doesn't seem to want to use his Bankai. Shunsui assures him that he will eventually. Ukitake, however, retorts that it would be best to not reveal his Bankai in front of everyone.

       <p key="c9cb2e45-90fa-4754-b882-04f4d3b47ea4">
        Ukitake continues by saying that in any case his powers are better suited for this sort of fight. Starrk interrupts by asking Ukitake how he fired a Cero. Ukitake plainly says "who knows, maybe he'll figure it out if he does it again." Determined to figure out Ukitake's power Starrk fires again much to Lilynette's loud protest that it's most likely a trap. No sooner does he fire a large Cero, that moments later, it comes right back at him, to which Starrk dodges. He fires again and notices the same result. He uses Sonído to get closer to Ukitake and then explains what he has learned of his ability. Ukitake is surprised that he figured it out after only three attacks. Starrk then expresses that he is glad that Ukitake's power isn't to reflect any and all attacks back at his opponent. Starrk surmises that if Ukitake has to absorb the attack first, there has to be a limit to what can be absorbed. He then tells Ukitake that he doesn't think he'll be able to absorb the attack if he fires 1,000 shots at once.

        Before Starrk can fire, Shunsui appears behind him and tries to cut off his head, but Starrk dodges and fires a large Cero which Shunsui also dodges. Then seemingly out of nowhere a Garganta begins to open, surprising the three combatants. Ukitake asks Shunsui if it's someone new. Shunsui responds by asking if Ukitake thinks it's someone who could back up the top three Espada, as he hopes it isn't. When the Garganta is fully open,

Seeing this, Shunsui goes to attack the Arrancar, but is quickly shot at point blank range in the back by a Cero from Starrk. They are both seen falling out of the sky to the city below.

        Later, after Aizen is captured, Ukitake recovers and eavesdrops alongside Sentarō and Kiyone on Yamamoto scolding Shunsui, Byakuya, and Kenpachi for losing their respective captain haori. Ukitake notes that 10 days have past since the battle, Yamamoto has lost his left arm, but it looks like his stamina has returned, which is a relief as Soul Society still has yet to see a being capable of replacing the man.

     Ukitake admits that the Badge was the one he had given to Ichigo, but he still does not believe that Ichigo could be involved with the disappearances within the Dangai World. Kyōraku agrees with him. They are then informed that Ichigo has been broken out of confinement by Rukia.
      Along with at least Kyōraku, Yamamoto, and Unohana, Ukitake is one of the captains that have not been replaced by a

     Ukitake then appears before Central 46, in order to plead Kyōraku's innocence. They inform him that no captain can dispute their judgement, as he leaves the chamber. He comments upon their pig-headedness, as Unohana appears before him. She states that the mastermind behind this incident will not reveal himself easily, as Ukitake undergoes his own secret investigation into the matter, prompting Unohana to wish him luck in his task. Later, Ukitake appears before Kyōraku's cell, immobilizing the Shinigami guarding it.

     Ukitake states that they are to attend a summons by the Captain-Commander, in order to determine the cause of the incident. Kyōraku comments upon the uncomfortable nature of his cell, prompting Ukitake to berate him for not realizing the seriousness of the events. As Kyōraku resolves himself, Ukitake hands him his katana, as they proceed to head to the 1st Division barracks. However, Ukitake is dealt a critical wound to the chest by Kyōraku, who reveals that he was a Reigai. He comments that it was too easy to defeat him, as Ukitake slumped to the ground, incapacitated. As he prepares to deal the final blow, however, the Reigai counterpart of Ukitake intervenes, telling him that they have more pressing matters to deal with at the moment.

He proceeds to charge at Inaba, but stops when the Reigai jump down and protect Inaba. The Shinigami then face off against the Reigai, with Ukitake fighting against Reigai-Retsu Unohana with Kyōraku.

      Ukitake demands to know how Inaba managed to purloin the Mod-Soul information from the Dangai, to which Inaba reveals he was responsible for the development of the Mod-Souls. Ukitake states that his research was too dangerous to be continued, and the Project Spearhead was terminated by Central 46. However, Ukitake states that the true reason his research project was terminated was because they saw the technology as a threat to the peace.

     Inaba states that he could not forgive those who disallowed his research, prompting Ukitake to ask whether this is why he wants to resurrect Project Spearhead. He confirms this, promptly breaking the Limiter Bracelets upon the Reigai's forearms, as several more Reigai surround Ukitake and Kyōraku. Ukitake tells Kyōraku to prepare for battle, as the Reigai charge at him. He dodges a blow from Reigai-Shūhei Hisagi.
      Eventually, Ukitake and the other captains are forced to retreat.
      Later, they return in time to help Ichigo and Kisuke against their Reigai pursuers.
      Ukitake quickly teams up with Kyōraku to dodge a blow from Kyōraku's Reigai and then to battle Reigai-Sajin.

      Despite this assistance, the Reigai still pressure the Shinigami. Byakuya Kuchiki then realizes the truth behind the Reigai's battle style: they value self-preservation the most and won't attack first in fear of being outnumbered.

Before the Shinigami can act, the Reigai step forward, saying that they will stop their fellow Mod-Soul's chaotic plan as their goal has always been to protect the Soul Society in their own way. Reigai then destroy the technique at the cost of their own lives.
      Later, with war won, Ichigo and the others prepare to return home. Before they leave, Ukitake returns Ichigo's Shinigami badge. He also offers
