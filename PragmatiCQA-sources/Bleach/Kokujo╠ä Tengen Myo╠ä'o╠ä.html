   Komamura is an anthropomorphic wolf, although he is often mistaken for a dog.
   Initially, he was very self-conscious about his appearance, so he wore gloves with bracers, as well as a helmet, to conceal his entire body. However, he later gains enough confidence to go on without his helmet after
   Kaname Tōsen

   . He is the tallest captain of the

  </h2>
  <p key="a00da63d-2bc9-44d4-a7e8-00fc19dd2766">
   In contrast to his imposing physical stature, Komamura has a heart of gold, as well as being a loyal and grateful subordinate to Captain-Commander
   Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
   , to whom he owes great gratitude for taking him in; so grateful that he would even die for him.
   The betrayal and subsequent departure of his close friend,
   Kaname Tōsen
   , may have adversely affected his self-confidence and view of himself, since Tōsen was the first person to have accepted him for who he is and not what he is. Sajin is a very forgiving person even if his friend is corrupt, or how evil they are, no matter how many innocent people they've killed, and even if they're about to kill him.
   This adverse effect is evident when he describes himself to
   Choe Neng Poww
   as "a meager worm" (he may have been speaking in sarcasm, however, as Poww previously referred to him and his opponents as "worms").
  </p>
  <p key="431e5793-68e4-4021-ad8c-3eac07f9f5c6">
   Komamura is also a very serious man, deeply scarred by the times when he was spurned by Soul Society for his appearance. He is not tough or cruel to his Division, preferring to lead them with impartiality. His favorite food is meat, but he dislikes carrots, supposedly because his father once told him that carrots were "
   <i key="3bb5df39-dbad-4c53-abd6-f4c9fcd75524">
    not for their kind.
   </i>
   " Komamura tends to growl when angered. Despite being a gentle person, he is cold, ruthless and calculating when fighting. Once he is done fighting, however, he reverts to his gentle, giant self.
  </p>
  <p key="0ec55fdd-ac05-4f80-a85c-2b814ed219da">
   Komamura is pleased with

   He also likes dogs, especially ones of mixed breeds, and even keeps one, whose name is 'Goro', in his Division's quarters. During his free time, he takes Goro for strolls.

  <p key="069e2b40-5450-4c1a-beda-70fbb3d13f7b">
   Some time before joining the Gotei 13, Komamura left his family, ashamed of living in the shadows.
   Although it is currently unknown where Komamura originated, Yamamoto gave him the opportunity to join the Gotei 13 even though he wasn't Human.
  </p>
  <p key="c4f4373e-736a-42bb-b4c3-9cec427a62ed">
   One day, while sitting on a grassy area, Komamura was sensed by Tōsen, who didn't know where he was (due to his blindness). It was only when Komamura spoke that he realized he had talked in the wrong direction. Complimenting Komamura’s ability to hide his presence very well, Tōsen noted that he had never been able to not feel someone’s presence before, even though his eyes cannot see. Komamura was highly touched, for this was the first time that he wasn't looked upon as an outcast.
  </p>
  <p key="c9ec46e8-4ad3-4b71-9d82-fcec62c95f64">
   Komamura met Tōsen again during their time in the Gotei 13, and Aizen was introduced to Komamura through Tōsen.

        Later, Komamura, Iba, Tōsen, and 9th Division Lieutenant
        Shūhei Hisagi
        stop
        Kenpachi Zaraki
        and his men in an open courtyard from aiding the Ryoka. After an exchange of words, Komamura and Tōsen deal with Kenpachi while their lieutenants take on the 3rd and 5th Seats of the 11th Division.
        Komamura, getting tired of Kenpachi's arrogance, unleashes his
        Shikai
        , while Tōsen follows up with his own, but neither are able to inflict more than superficial injuries.
        Kenpachi then sneers at Komamura and demands that he release his

       <p key="001ac964-4595-4dca-a8dc-0e46ced64eb6">
        Although Kenpachi defeats Tōsen, Komamura stops Kenpachi from killing his friend by deflecting Kenpachi's blade with his left arm and helmet. As a result, Komamura's helmet smashes into pieces and falls into the ground, revealing his true appearance: Komamura is a wolf.
       </p>
       <p key="f3895b16-9616-4616-b865-acfb97de7d4c">
        Komamura finally releases his Bankai to face Kenpachi and "satisfy" the latter's lust for fighting.
        However, sensing Yamamoto's Shikai, he later leaves Kenpachi to rush to his benefactor's aid.

       <p key="d09c00bb-cb78-4ef2-92c8-1d0f52186e6b">
        Before reaching Yamamoto, Komamura hears the message of Aizen and Tōsen's betrayal and rushes over to
        Sōkyoku Hill
        to intercept the real traitors.
        Upon arriving at the hill, Komamura immediately attacks Aizen with his Shikai, but he quickly moves and gets up close to Komamura and stops his blade with one hand. Aizen calmly mentions that it has been quite a while since he last saw Komamura's face. Komamura gives a response of his own by angrily interrogating Aizen on how he can still smile, stating that he will never forgive him for betraying Soul Society. He again tries to strike him with his Shikai to which Aizen quickly moves out the way.
       </p>
       <p key="8b697ae3-6ab3-4feb-b05d-7d17a3d97e60">
        Angered at Aizen's treachery, Komamura then turns to Tōsen and demands an explanation for his own actions. Receiving no answer, Komamura attempts to release his Bankai. However, he is caught under the hypnosis of Aizen's

       <p key="9cf0448c-b862-45f8-a989-142a6aab6b67">
        Komamura regains consciousness at the time of the three leaving, shouting for Tōsen to get back down. "Why did you become a Shinigami?" he asks. "Was it not for your friend who died? Was it not for justice?" Tōsen replies that he had told Komamura before that "all that is reflected in these eyes is the path of least blood. The path I walk is justice."

        A week after the incident, Komamura visits the grave of Tōsen's friend, asking what the latter would have said to stop Tōsen. Hisagi later joins and asks Komamura of Tōsen's possible return. "Without a doubt," he replies. "By our own hands, let us open his eyes."
        He, along with Renji, Unohana, Rukia, and Ukitake, see off Ichigo and his friends when they return to the World of the Living.

     When the

     manage to invade the Seireitei,
     Shūhei Hisagi
     reports to Komamura about the large numbers of Shinigami that are attacking other Shinigami. He elaborates that this unusual phenomenon is being cause by the special ability of the Bount
     Mabashi
     and his
     Doll
     Ritz. Komamura asks if there is a way to break the control the Doll has over the Shinigami but Hisagi replies that it is extremely difficult to remove Ritz from whomever she possesses unless it is done when the person is dead. Komamura, alongside Hsagi, decides to go out and combat those Shinigami who have been possessed by Ritz.

     When a group of the possessed individuals are defeated, Komamura suggests to his subordinates that they move them to the
     Fourth Division
     barracks as if anyone knows what to do it would be Captain Unohana. He continues to battle other crowds of possessed Shinigami, using his
     Reiatsu
     to knock out many of them at once. Despite this, one of the Shinigami manages to stab him in the chest causing many members of his squad to worry abut his safety. Komamura easily pushes the Shinigami away and tells his subordinates to focus on keeping themselves protected.
     Along with Kyōraku and Unohana, Komamura reports to Yamamoto after Mabashi's defeat. They discuss the growing numbers of casualties within the Seireitei but how many of the formerly possessed Shinigami should recover with time.

     which can potentially be disastrous for the Seireitei. Komamura insists that given that the information came from a known criminal named

     When only Kariya remains as the last threat from the Bounts, many of the captains are sent out to diffuse the other Jōkaishō. Hitsugaya wonders where Komamura is and

     . Upon Amagai's arrival Komamura notes to himself that his Zanpakutō is a Kodachi. Komamura asks
     Shunsui Kyōraku
     , who he thinks observed his captain's proficiency exam, his opinion on the new captain. Shunsui plainly states it doesn't really matter, as they should be happy that the
     Gotei 13
     have one less position open.
     Suì-Fēng
     interjects despite that Amagai will have to prove himself. Later that day, Komamura stands with Iba at the grave stone of Tōsen's dead friend. He remarks that the 3rd Division is going to take action at the recent incident of Hollow incursion. He tells Iba that the Seireitei may be moving toward change, when Iba looks at him confused, Komamura explains that someone from one of the patrol units has suddenly become a new captain. He maintains that it has never happened before. Iba says that it may be true, but he wonders who the other two captains who tested him were. Komamura tells him he doesn't know, but he knows that something new is coming.

        Poww, however, is immediately back on his feet, unscathed, and is also unfazed by the captain being an animal. Poww then proceeds to punch him for several miles and releases his Zanpakutō.
        Komamura returns and stops an attack from the released Arrancar, who was attempting to attack his lieutenant and Ikkaku, and proceeds to throw the him over his head and in to the ground.
        Poww, unharmed, says the hit made him "yawn", which is actually him building up a
        Cero
        . Komamura then calmly releases his Bankai.

After recovering, Poww proceeds to grapple with the giant, while simultaneously firing another Cero. This has seemingly no effect on it. The giant subsequently forces the Cero down Poww's own throat with his hand. The counterattack throws the Arrancar back and he falls to the ground. Komamura then kills Poww with a single blow from the giant's sword.

        Komamura wiggles his ear, and Iba and Ikkaku immediately notices he was standing right next to them (again referencing the fact that he's great at hiding his spiritual pressure). Komamura says not to worry, and that it seems he has something in his ears. This possibly hints that he overheard Iba and Ikkaku's conversation about how Ikkaku can use Bankai, but he chooses not to reveal anything.

        He is suddenly brought out of thought by Kira, who tells them that he and the fallen lieutenants will be fine and that he should go as even if he stays and protects them, what would be the point if all the others died.

        As Tōsen sets himself to attack

        , he intersects the attack, Shinji asks if he should be helping them and Komamura just says that he is going to help and will not take no for an answer.
        Komamura then tells Tōsen that he never thought he would be protecting someone from him. As Tōsen tells him that their battle was inevitable,
        Shūhei Hisagi
        appears and asks that he be allowed to fight as well.
        When Tōsen remarks that he will release his full power now that Aizen has joined the battle, Komamura believes Tōsen means his Bankai, and says he will release his as well. Tōsen retorts,  saying that he has a power greater than Bankai, shocking Komamura.

        As Tōsen raises his hand to his face, here is a release of Reiatsu that Hisagi and Komamura shield themselves from, with Komamura yelling to Tōsen, asking him what made him fall so low. When the smoke clears, Tōsen stands before them with a Hollow mask, causing Hisagi to ask him if that is
        Hollowfication
        to which Tōsen confirms. When Hisagi asks why, he is surprised as Tōsen appears in front of him and slashes him, causing Komamura to release his Shikai. Tōsen effortlessly blocks the attack much to Komamura's surprise, and is kicked to the side sending him crashing down into the town below. Tōsen then comments to Komamura that it's ironic that the
        Gotei 13
        ally with Ichigo, a Shinigami-Hollow hybrid just like him. He then asks Komamura to explain why his power has become despicable just because he has chosen to wield it. Komamura explains that
        <a href="Ichigo Kurosaki.html" key="f2c03477-b734-4cd0-86b3-aee1f56c42b1" title="Ichigo Kurosaki">
         Ichigo Kurosaki

        did not choose to undergo Hollowfication. He, on the other hand as an elite Shinigami, had no need for such a thing, and chose it of his own free will. He then states that Tōsen has been corrupted by that power. Tōsen questions this explanation, and asks how flirting with his inner Hollow would prove anything of the sort. He states that Komamura only speaks in that tone because of his antiquated sense of dualism regarding Shinigami and Hollows. Komamura yells at him stating that is not what he meant, in fact referring to the way Tōsen threw away his friends and subordinates simply to gain forbidden power. Komamura makes note that is where his corruption has led him astray.

        Tōsen goes to speak, but is cut off when a chain wraps around his neck, pulling him back and slamming him into the roof of a nearby building. He enters into a small conversation with Hisagi before he impales him on his blade and throws him off the side of the building. Tōsen then states that his fear for the past 100 years is that he would assimilate with the rest of the

        Tōsen scoffs at Komamura's Bankai as he releases it, saying that after the 7th Division captain had seen his power, fighting him with a mere Bankai is foolish.
        Tōsen attacks the giant's right arm, injuring Komamura in the process. Komamura counterattacks and the giant's left arm hits Tōsen several blocks away. This attack breaks Tōsen's left arm, leaving it mangled. Tōsen makes the observation that Komamura's Bankai is linked to his body and that injuring the giant corresponds to injuring Komamura. Tōsen makes the comment that Komamura probably never considered the possibility of failing to defeat the enemy in a single strike or receiving a counterattack.

       <p key="a6f47396-78c2-4b9a-b5df-f851d64d3b28">
        Tōsen uses high-speed regeneration to fully restore his arm. Komamura tells Tōsen that he has truly abandoned his Shinigami nature. His reply is that those words are nothing more than excuses for his own defeat. Tōsen repeats Komamura's words about him debasing himself, deceiving his friends in order to gain power. But then he asks Komamura "Joining an organization for the sake of revenge, yet in the course of one's peaceful life, they're forgetting that objective and serving that organization happily, would you not call that debasement?" As he speaks, his mask begins to crack and form a mouth. Tōsen then tells Komamura that the latter is more debasing than the former, shouting revenge. He asks Komamura if he thought it was strange "that a man whose greatest friend was killed would join the same organization as the killer?" Komamura answers that he thought his goal was justice, that he believed in his friend's ideals and wanted to fulfill them himself. Tōsen says that Komamura is correct. Tōsen states that justice is his goal, but asks what justice is, and that goodness and justice are not the same. He says that living out his peaceful life and not avenging his friend would be evil.

        Komamura says that he had misjudged Tōsen completely and that they will never meet eye-to-eye. Tōsen ask if Komamura will strike him down, saying that it's laughable. Komamura replies if their core beliefs are incompatible, then attempting to use words is meaningless, saying that for the sake of

Tōsen is slightly put off by this, telling him not to speak as though he were a god, saying that he had already forgiven him. Tōsen tells him that he didn't ask for forgiveness and that if Komamura wanted to strike him down, he should do so if he is able to say that after witnessing his

        Tōsen is enveloped in darkness as he transforms into a large winged bestial type creature. When the darkness clears, he opens his large eyes and comments that he can see Komamura. He becomes ecstatic yelling he can finally see and comments on seeing the sky, blood and the world. He tells Komamura that he is far uglier than he had imagined. He then rises up to attack his former friend, as he does, Tōsen details that he fought for justice because of his friend and when he became a Shinigami that day, he pledged to follow her path. Komamura evades his attack and recalls that on that day he detected a small lie in Tōsen's words. Noting that Tōsen spoke often of the world that she loved, but didn't once say a word about loving the world himself. Komamura admits that he understood this as anyone had the right to feel that way when a loved one was taken from him. He even respected that Tōsen never acted like a saint and claimed he did love the world. Komamura had resolved that he would become a true friend to Tōsen taking his sadness and giving him joy and being there for him as a true friend would.

Tōsen comes over to Komamura and asks him if they should end the fight. He then says that justice is not something that can be expressed in mere words as he charges his Cero. Komamura then apologizes to Iba, Hisagi and Tōsen, as he could not strike his former friend down. As Tōsen prepares to finish him off, they are both surprised as a blade goes through the top of Tōsen's head. He then watches as Hisagi stands upon Tōsen's back with his Zanpakutō impaled in his spine, which he then releases, impaling him further with one of the blades coming out of Tōsen's mouth.
        When Tōsen, who has returned to his normal form, regains consciousness, Komamura reminds Tōsen about him saying that he knew the two would cross blades eventually, and that he too knew this would happen, as did Hisagi. He tells Tōsen that he does not expect him to stop being angry, but that he should not focus only on vengeance until he loses himself. Sajin tells Kaname that like when he lost his friend, his heart would be empty if he lost Tōsen. Kaname thanks him for his words and tells Hisagi that he wants to see his face, and that he can see in his Hollowfication form. Tōsen explodes, splattering blood across the rubble. Komamura then yells at Aizen.

        Just as Ichigo is about to break down by Aizen's words, Komamura steps in and warns him not to be taken in and lose himself, for he will lose his life as well. Komamura then reveals that everyone fighting in the Fake Karakura Town understood why the captains in Hueco Mundo sent him here, and they all vow to fight and protect Ichigo.
        Before joining the attack on Aizen, Sajin tells Ichigo that he is grateful to him for attacking Aizen at that moment, as he was about to attack Aizen himself, out of anger over Tōsen. He then joins Tōshirō in fighting Aizen.
        When his Shikai proves ineffective against the renegade captain, Sajin releases his Bankai, but Aizen easily severs its blade and left arm at the middle of the forearm and cutting the side of its torso, causing similar damage to Sajin, who screams in pain. Despite this, Sajin makes a final attack with his broken blade, but is blocked by Aizen, who then gives him a decisive blow to the chest which sends him hurtling down to the town below.

He manages to reach a stalemate with her, resulting in both of them utilizing their Bankai. Komamura's Bankai proceeds to destroy Reigai-Suì-Fēng's missile fired from her Bankai, resulting in her defeat. He then attempts to go and help out Yamamoto, but collapses from severe exhaustion.

     Despite this assistance, the Reigai still pressure the Shinigami. Byakuya Kuchiki then realizes the truth behind the Reigai's battle style: they value self-preservation the most and won't attack first in fear of being outnumbered. Learning this, Sajin directly teams up with his lieutenant, voicing that such tactics won't defeat them.

   When he senses that Yamamoto is moving onto the battlefield, he lets out a roar. He then tells the fallen members of his division to stand up, as it is shameful to lay down while the Captain-Commander is standing and raises their morale.

Before their infighting goes any further, Shunsui comes in to calm everyone down.

   Komamura addresses the creature as his great-grandfather, and states that he wants to learn the family secrets. After being rebuked for hiding his face, he states that society has changed in a way that he no longer has to hide, and that that society is now on the verge of crisis. His great-grandfather states that the world's bearers are the ones changing and that they should lay low. Komamura presses on with his goals, which prompts his great grand-father to say he has to crush him. Komamura sees his resolve and prepares to battle him.

   is performed by momentarily removing the chains that bind them, recovering the forms they once held before they were cursed to live as beasts, and obtaining great power in the process. Komamura then asked how he can learn the technique, and his grandfather answered that he had to rip out his own heart. Komamura hesitated, but explained that he couldn't stand living in the shadows, which caused him to abandon his clan. Yamamoto took him in, and because of that, he is in debt to him. However, as Yamamoto was killed by the Quincy, Komamura became determined to clear away that shame and tears out his heart for his great-grandfather.

Regardless of his explanation, Bambietta still doesn't understand what he means and states that Bankai have no life and that she, having possession of it until recently, knows all about his symbiotic connection to it and makes use of the weakness by exploding a hole in

She becomes irate, stating that throwing your life away is pointless if you're already dead, thus removing the point of winning. He corrects her and states that he didn't throw his life away; he placed it at stake just as Yamamoto had done and that he already left his life behind when he stepped into the fight in the first place.

     Divine Retribution, Black Ropes of Ruination
    </b>
    "): Komamura brings forth the entire giant, a Bankai of living armor.
    Standing at about a hundred meters tall, the giant resembles an armored samurai. It wields a sword with a guard similar to Komamura's, but with a different blade and a string hanging from the hilt. Komamura also retains its form as a regular katana. While in use, Komamura and his katana maintain a glow of spiritual energy.

    Symbiotic Link (Bankai)
   </b>
   : Komamura's Bankai possesses a critical weakness: a powerful bond exists between Komamura and Kokujō Tengen Myō'ō, causing any harm inflicted on the Bankai to be reflected onto its master. This essentially makes Komamura a larger target to a sufficiently powerful opponent. However, this same bond allows Kokujō Tengen Myō'ō to be restored if Komamura's wounds are healed, making it unique among Bankai.
   According to Tōsen, it has such immense destructive power that Komamura has never considered that he might not defeat an enemy with a single strike, let alone receive a counterattack.

    Komamura appears in most Bleach games. He is a decent character that moves slowly, but displays nearly unmatchable strength in close range combat, such as throws and high defense, making him difficult to be defeated. His alternative costume in most games includes his signature helmet with which he originally appeared. Most games give Komamura and his Bankai some degree of independence from each other to make it function better as a game mechanic.

     "That is why I swore to myself that I would become a true friend to you. If you bore great sadness, I would take it upon myself. If I obtained great joy, I would share it with you. If you strayed from your path, I would scold you. If you made terrible mistakes, I would forgive you. If the world scorned you, I would be your shelter. Somehow, I would give this man who had lost his love for the world the power to love it once more."

That man, to whom I owe the greatest debt, has had his own life cut short at the hands of these Quincy. I have a duty...to avenge this humiliation!!"
