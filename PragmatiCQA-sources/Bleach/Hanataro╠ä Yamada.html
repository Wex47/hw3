   Hanatarō's birthday is April 1, April Fools' Day. People spend the whole day tricking him as a result. According to

   offices. It was during that time that he was assigned janitorial duty there that he met her and they became acquaintances. From that point onward he would show up everyday as he enjoyed his time there and he and Rukia would have conversation where she spoke of mostly Ichigo. He further detailed that she has a lot of faith in Ichigo even after only knowing him for 2 months and that if not for her coming into his life it had changed drastically and caused him great pain for which she could never make up to him no matter what she does. Ichigo then further resolves to save Rukia.
   As the group makes its way out of the sewer Hanatarō gives the all clear and explains that there is no way to go under the tower as the courtyard they are currently in is as close as he can get them. The group is then confronted by a new opponent.

   As Ichigo and Renji converse, Ganju asks who he is as his Reiatsu is different than any of the guys they have previously encountered. He then notices Hanatarō is noticeably shaken by the arrival of this new Shinigami. Hanatarō explains that the person in front of them is the lieutenant of the 6th Division,

Ganju questions whether Ichigo can defeat such an opponent, but Hanatarō assures him that Ichigo has a chance as Ichigo has put Renji on the defensive in a short amount of time. Renji eventually gets the upper hand sending Ichigo through nearby buildings and causing Hanatarō and Ganju to panic.
   After Ichigo has put Renji through a wall a surprised Ganju and Hanatarō look on, prompting Hanatarō to state that it's amazing that Ichigo can take a direct hit from Renji's

   and still stand. The two continue the fight with Ichigo gaining the upper hand much to Hanatarō's surprise.
   After Ichigo wins the battle he falls down from his wounds. Hanatarō and Ganju run to his side, he marvels that Ichigo could defeat a lieutenant and wonders what kind of super-being he is. He then sees a group of people coming in the distance, and Ganju determines that they can't handle anymore fights as he picks up Ichigo. He then suggests to Hanatarō that they get somewhere deserted quick.
   The group retreats back into the sewers where Hanatarō explains to Ganju the power of healing the 4th Division excels at as he attempts to heal Ichigo's injuries, stating he only needs one night and he will have healed him completely.

   Ichigo wakes up as Hanatarō is healing him in the sewer. Hanatarō tells him not to get up since his wounds aren't healed yet. Ichigo remembers that he was fighting Renji, he gets right up and tells Hanatarō that he's okay, despite Hanatarō's protest. But just when he is about to leave, Ganju knocks him out with a punch, saying if Ichigo can't take a punch like that then he's not okay and he'd better lay down like a good boy until he's healed. Hanatarō comes to take Ichigo away and complains that now he has another injury and Ganju is so brutal. Ganju says that is how he does things and at least he stopped Ichigo. Hanatarō is wondering why the wound on Ichigo's left torso is so shallow, as it should have been a fatal wound. It was the mask that was hidden inside his robe that saved him. Hanatarō wonders what that mask is made of because it blocked an attack from Renji, but also why it looks so much like a Hollow's mask.
   Later Ganju wakes up to find Hanatarō drooling on him. He pushes Hanatarō away, who continues to sleep. Ichigo informs Ganju that Hanatarō is so exhausted because he healed Ganju after he was done healing Ichigo.

   Hanatarō takes a pill to revitalize himself and although he claims that it is working, Ichigo and Ganju are not convinced. Regardless, they return to the surface and find it strange that no guards had been posted. However, Hanatarō suggests that they most likely did not think they could return so soon after yesterday. Ganju wonders if the others are alright. Ichigo replies that they are, saying Orihime and Ishida are a thousand times smarter than them and as such would never pick fights with people they could not defeat. When Ganju asks about Chad, Ichigo replies that he is even less of a worry as not only has Ichigo been feeling Chad's Reiatsu since coming to Soul Society, but that Ichigo can't even imagine Chad losing.
   Ichigo, Ganju and Hanatarō run up the many steps leading to the Senzaikyū. When they get to the top, Ichigo comments on how lax security is when they suddenly feel a massive amount of Reiatsu.
   They try to run from the Reiatsu, but fall short of doing so as Hanatarō collapses, prompting Ganju to carry him.

   jumps out of Kenpachi's back and steps on Ichigo's shoulder to look at Hanatarō, making Ichigo furiously chase her off. Yachiru says he's angry and Kenpachi tells her it's her fault. Ichigo tells Ganju to take Hanatarō to go rescue Rukia first while he stays there to stop Kenpachi. Ganju doesn't agree at first, but he knows he can't do anything so he takes Hanatarō and runs off.
   Hanatarō wakes up while still being carried by Ganju. He asks where Ichigo is and Ganju says he's still back there. Hanatarō says they have to go back. Because no matter how strong Ichigo is, he can't win. Because that man is the 11th Division captain,

   Hanatarō wakes up to find himself being taken away from the fight between Ichigo and Kenpachi by Ganju. Hanatarō tells Ganju to let him go, saying that if they don't help Ichigo, he will die. Ganju reminds him that they were paralyzed just from Zaraki's Reiatsu, therefore they cannot in reality do anything to help Ichigo. Ganju goes on to say that Ichigo has the best chance of beating Zaraki out of the three of them and that they have a job of their own, as Ichigo entrusted them to save Rukia. Motivated, Hanatarō heads towards Rukia's cell with Ganju.

Hanatarō asks Ganju if he knows her. Ganju says that he does and that she's the Shinigami who killed his brother.

   Kuchiki Clan
   is the head of the four noble families, and Byakuya is said to be the strongest master in the clan's entire history, and is also the most famous captain of the Gotei 13. Ganju says it's bad that he appears at a time like this. He says that they have no chance of winning and they should just beg him to spare their lives. Hanatarō says that they should just run away and take Rukia with them. Ganju says there's no way to run since the bridge is the only way out. He asks if Hanatarō wants him to defeat Byakuya and run, throwing his life away in the process. He asks if Hanatarō wants him to throw away his life for Rukia. Ganju says that Rukia killed his brother, and that there's no way he would give up his life for her. Hanatarō then says that he understands that it can't be helped since there was never any reason for Ganju to rescue Rukia, he has no right to force Ganju to do it, but at least Ganju can take Rukia with him when he runs away. Hanatarō says that he will stay and try to hold Byakuya here.

   Both Ganju and Rukia are surprised by that. Ganju asks if Hanatarō knows what's going on. Hanatarō says that he believes he knows, how Ganju feels, he wouldn't give up his life to save someone he hates, he would do the same if he was in Ganju's shoes. Ganju says that's not what he's talking about, this guy's Reiatsu is as strong, or even stronger than Zaraki, and asks how someone like him could possibly beat him. Hanatarō says he knows that, but he came here to rescue Rukia, so he can't just run away without doing anything. He thanks Ganju and says goodbye. Then he heads out to the bridge. Rukia tries to run after him, but Ganju stops her. Ganju then thinks that Hanatarō is an idiot, what can he do if he doesn't even have his Zanpakutō. He's still shaking, he must be scared to death, why is he bluffing so much when he's so obviously weak. Then Ganju lets go of Rukia, goes to the wall, shouts really loud and beats his head against the wall. The shout scares Hanatarō, he turns back and Ganju is behind him, telling him to move. Then Ganju kicks him aside, confronting Byakuya himself.

And more important, although extremely clumsy, they were trying to save a member of his division, so he can't just stand there and watch them die.

Hanatarō says that he can't save Rukia no matter how hard he tries so he asks Renji to save her. Renji says yes.

   : As a member of the 4th Division, Hanatarō possesses remarkable healing powers. Instead of his Zanpakutō, he often carries around a 4th Division medical pack on his back. Presumably, it contains medical supplies, including a salve, bandages, and rejuvenation pills. One of the known items in this pack is

   , a green liquid which can knock out anyone with weak
   spiritual power
   with one drop (although it was still potent enough to knock out Yumichika, who is as strong as a lieutenant). It is presumably for use as an anesthetic. He is also known to carry a type of large pill with a skull symbol, which is a supplement exclusive to the 4th Division that restores stamina. While the pill given to other 4th Division members works as intended, Hanatarō's is merely a flour-filled placebo given to him as a prank by his upper-classmen, although it appears to be genuine.
