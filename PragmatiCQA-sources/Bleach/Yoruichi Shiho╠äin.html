   Yoruichi Shihōin is a slender and well-endowed woman of average height. She has dark skin, golden irises, and black hair.
   Her hair is waist-length and kept in a ponytail with chin-length bangs framing the sides of her face.
   Her standard attire consists of a black, backless, sleeveless undershirt, an orange over-shirt with two white straps on each shoulder, a large beige sash around her waist,
   and black stretch pants with a pair of lightweight brown shoes,
   which allow for stealth and easy use of Shunpo.
   She previously wore a beige neck warmer, which she pulled up to cover her face in order to hide her identity, but seems to have forgone its use.
   She occasionally wears long beige wrist and leg warmers, each secured by bands.
   During the

  </p>
  <p key="273a878a-2205-4ea8-991a-ff4befb034f4">
   Unlike any other known Shinigami, she can transform into a small black cat for long periods of time. In this form, she has a distinctive male voice and golden eyes.
  </p>
  <p key="95ceda74-7fcb-4a3a-90d7-d3f6dfc05a40">
   110 years ago, during her time as a captain, she wore the same sleeveless and backless Onmitsukidō uniform, with long black wrist guards which Suì-Fēng wears now, but had a black ribbon tied around her neck.
   She wore a long-sleeved captain's

  <p key="b06bb986-e04f-485f-bff3-be1ef476de93">
   Yoruichi is intelligent and witty, holding an intimate knowledge of Soul Society and its workings, as she was the former leader of the Onmitsukidō and the Second Division's captain. Although of noble birth, she acts differently from most other nobles, very much like
   <a href="Kaien Shiba.html" key="d2e546d6-2e3d-4261-97d4-683b9ebe6cce" title="Kaien Shiba">

   . For instance, she instructed Suì-Fēng to refer to her without using honorific suffixes, but reluctantly settled for being called
   <i key="d0df96b5-2f54-4024-93d0-0f346083c1b1">
    "Yoruichi-sama"
   </i>
   . On several occasions, she transforms into her Human form directly in front of Ichigo just to see his reaction to seeing her naked, which she teases him about. In addition, she speaks in a dialect used by elders, such as identifying herself as
   <i key="6f4f844e-6948-4dfa-86c4-0a395b54650c">
    "washi"

   (a term usually used by old men to define themselves with), instead of more feminine terms like
   <i key="36c417e7-a84b-46b9-bb73-660bbbdba53d">

   </i>
   , in both her Human and animal forms.
  </p>
  <p key="c93246ac-8917-4e9a-ac53-ac08db3a8fc1">
   While it is unknown how she obtained her cat transformation, she appears to prefer spending most of her time in it. Upon showing her Shinigami form to Ichigo, she forgot to put on clothes, as she had grown used to not needing them; due to being in cat form for so long. She especially takes delight in transforming in front of people to see their shocked reaction, due to her cat form making her sound male.
   Her love for her cat form extends to great anger should someone harm it or insult its appearance, as seen from how upset she got after her tail was damaged.
  </p>
  <p key="3635ac52-c368-4e04-8ef1-89d28ff16195">
   Although relatively calm and mature when a situation calls for it, Yoruichi is quite laid-back and playful, often teasing or flirting with those younger than her, such as

        Later, Yoruichi became the Corps Commander of the Executive Militia of the Onmitsukidō while serving as the 22nd generational Head of the Shihōin Clan, becoming the first woman to ever hold the position.
        Some time later, she would serve as Commander-in-Chief of the

        , further uniting the formerly separate military arms together, as this was also traditionally done by her family.

        Some time later, she decided to change her role in the Onmitsukidō from being the Corps Commander of the Executive Militia, which is the position traditionally held by the Commander-in-Chief, to being the Corps Commander of the Corrections Corps.
        While Yoruichi was Onmitsukidō Commander, she took in Suì-Fēng as a personal bodyguard. Recognizing her talent, she became a mentor and friend. She taught Suì-Fēng most of the techniques she knew. During her time in Soul Society, she created many techniques which involved

       </p>
       <p key="6ac7b4b1-515c-46f2-946e-67dca12028d9">
        About 110 years ago, Yoruichi recommended that Kisuke Urahara, her 3rd Seat, be appointed to the recently opened position of Captain of the
        <a href="Twelfth Division.html" key="d346b930-ed8b-4aa5-aa19-6ff8d05eccb7" title="Twelfth Division">
         12th Division
        </a>
        after the former captain,
        Kirio Hikifune
        , was promoted.
        Prior to presenting Urahara with the news of the open position, Yoruichi had a sparring session with him at the Sōkyoku Hill training space. Before retiring to the 2nd Division barracks, Yoruichi informed Urahara she had recommended him for the position. Suì-Fēng confronted Yoruichi, concerned that she was overestimating Urahara's capabilities, and proceeded to explain she believed it had been a mistake to appoint him as Corps Commander of the Detention Unit. Suì-Fēng continued by stating he was undeserving of such a position. While Yoruichi readily admitted that Urahara was not really a hard worker, she dismissed Suì-Fēng's criticisms, playfully insinuating that her focus on him must have romantic connotations, which Suì-Fēng denied.
       </p>
       <p key="d1d5958f-7f9e-436f-8f57-822d65146e92">
        After spending the day following Urahara around Soul Society taking notes, Suì-Fēng returned to the 2nd Division barracks to show Yoruichi her evidence of Urahara's lack of competence in his position, only to find Urahara already there talking with Yoruichi. Suì-Fēng is told Urahara would be taking the captain proficiency exam, to which she stands in disbelief. Yoruichi, confirming it, further requested Suì-Fēng attend the exam as well. She explains that normally only captains are allowed to attend, but she had asked special permission to allow Suì-Fēng to attend. Suì-Fēng was at first confused about why she should attend, but Yoruichi told her there was no need to keep secrets, as she knew she was attracted to Urahara, which Suì-Fēng again denied. Yoruichi explained she knew all about how Suì-Fēng had been following Urahara around all day.
       </p>
       <p key="72a90f0c-a59b-49fe-9b43-38a5f96bb00c">
        Suì-Fēng admitted she was following Urahara around, but stated it was to prove he was lazy, incompetent, and unworthy of Yoruichi's praise. Suì-Fēng handed her notes to Yoruichi, who, reading them, commented on how detailed they were. When Urahara didn't deny any of the information in the report, Suì-Fēng was shocked he would be so honest about his seemingly unprofessional actions. An unsurprised Yoruichi, stating Urahara never changes, praised Suì-Fēng for her intelligence gathering skills. Suì-Fēng, happy at first, realized Yoruichi regarded the notes not as intelligence information, but rather as a love letter.
       </p>
       <p key="bbba4869-a4eb-4671-be01-ae260b247517">
        Suì-Fēng was reasonably distressed, and Yoruichi, laughing it off, told her to loosen up, as she wasn't serious. They were interrupted by the arrival of a squad member, who delivered a message that the people Urahara had been looking for had been found. Suì-Fēng replied that if he didn't return in time, it would put a strain on the 2nd Division's reputation and Yoruichi's. Yoruichi, dismissing this, told Urahara to hurry off to his duty, and told Suì-Fēng to help prepare for Urahara's Captain's Proficiency Test.
        Yoruichi was present with the other captains awaiting the start of the ceremony. Upon Urahara's arrival to the 1st Division barracks, where he was formerly introduced to the other captains, he was chastised by Yoruichi for being so reluctant. She told him he was already a captain, so he should stand tall.
       </p>
       <p key="f862dd9c-6ade-49bb-8c66-d9d942ae457a">
        A day or so after Urahara took over the 12th Division, Yoruichi was told by an Onmitsukidō member that Urahara had entered the Detention Unit property, claiming he had been given approval to go. Yoruichi couldn't recall when or even if he asked for permission or whether she granted it, but when asked if she wanted him removed, she nonchalantly told her division members not to bother and to allow him to go where he liked. When asked if she remembered the incident in question, Yoruichi plainly said no. Suì-Fēng, becoming distressed, prepared to voice her disapproval, but Yoruichi told her to calm down, as it was Kisuke they were talking about, stating he must have had an idea of some kind.

        Yoruichi appeared to be on good terms with the members of the Kuchiki noble Clan as she would often visit the Kuchiki Manor to play tag with a teenage
        Byakuya Kuchiki
        . On one such occasion, she was asked to train Byakuya by his grandfather

        , the Head of the Kuchiki Clan and the 6th Division captain. Upon seeing the arrival of Yoruichi, Byakuya swung his sword at her, calling her a were-cat. Yoruichi, laughing, began to playfully tease him, calling him "Little Byakuya". She complained about receiving such a greeting after coming all the way there to see him. Byakuya yelled at her, saying he didn't want to see the likes of her, and he would be the head of the Kuchiki Clan soon enough, so he had no time to waste on her.

Not to be defeated so easily, Byakuya told her not to move an inch, but before he could finish, she, telling him he couldn't catch her, used Shunpo to begin the chase. Byakuya stated he could see she wished to incite his wrath, and he promised to make her see the error of her ways, further claiming his Shunpo was far superior to hers.

When a very winded and frantic Urahara showed up to ask that he be allowed to go with the investigation team, as he had previously sent his Lieutenant
        Hiyori Sarugaki

When he protested, he was chastised by Yoruichi, who told him he was acting pathetic and that he should get a grip on himself. She further stated he sent Hiyori himself, and for him to lose his composure like that only insulted her. The Captain-Commander continued naming the members of the investigation team, telling Yoruichi she was to standby for further orders.

For "committing crimes against researching and invoking forbidden phenomenon" and "deceiving and inflicting grievous injury to fellow Shinigami", Urahara was sentenced to become Human and to be exiled to the Human World. For "using forbidden Kidō techniques", Tessai was sentenced to life imprisonment in a Level 3 detention area.
        Before either of their sentences could be executed, a masked Yoruichi, entering the building, knocked the guards unconscious and rescuing the disgraced former captains, bringing them to a

Urging them both to remember the first time their powers manifested, she reaches the conclusion that their powers were activated when they were put in a position to protect others. Therefore, in order to activate their powers, they should think back on what they were trying to protect at the time. It is through Yoruichi's words that Orihime comes to understand that she wishes to protect Ichigo; this realization brings forth her powers in the form of the "

        Ichigo is stopped by a giant, who Yoruichi says to be the Seireimon Gatekeeper
        Jidanbō

        Before Ichigo can react, he, along with Jidanbō, is pushed out the gate by Gin's Shikai.

        After it is determined Ichigo is alright, he apologizes to Yoruichi for allowing the gate to close. Yoruichi says there is no need to blame himself, for if they had made it through the gate, the results would have been the same; he would still have to face Gin, so in turn he should be happy he is alive. The souls who live in the Rukongai come out of their dwellings. Yoruichi explains that anyone who is not guided into Soul Society by a Shinigami is considered an intruder, making Ichigo and his friends troublemakers in the eyes of Soul Society. As such, the souls were hiding because they were afraid.
        While resting among the citizens of Rukongai, Yoruichi discusses his plan to enter into the Seireitei without using the gate. Yoruichi asks Elder-Dono, the citizen whose house they are occupying, where they can locate

Before arriving, they are stopped by twin guard/servants

Ichigo asks if they will have to use the orb technique he learned to get through and if Yoruichi, being a cat, can achieve the same results. Yoruichi, telling him to place the orb on the ground, climbs on top of the orb and creates a seamless barrier, stating this sort of thing is like breathing to him. As Kūkaku prepares to shoot the cannon, the group enters the cannon. While inside, Yoruichi tells them to not wander off by themselves once they reach the Seireitei, and they are to run if they encounter a captain-class enemy, as their objective is to rescue Rukia and not to engage in unnecessary risks.

As the team begins to separate, Yoruichi assures Ichigo they will find a way to survive, but he must worry about himself first. The group breaks up in four separate directions, with Yoruichi left all by himself. She maintains this way is probably better.

Yoruichi, pushing him back down, assures him they all are fine. Yoruichi tells Ichigo that he needs to rest, and that if it were not for the Hollow mask he wore at his torso, he would have sustained a serious injury. Ichigo, surprised at the broken Hollow mask, explains that he had thrown away the mask previously. Yoruichi, surprised, tells Ichigo he will take it for safe-keeping, but Ichigo states he wants to keep it. Yoruichi, becoming angry, demands he give the mask over to him.

Yoruichi calmly tells him not to think so highly of himself, for no one there, not even Ichigo, would have survived a fight against Byakuya. She adds that to remain able to outrun Byakuya, one person is all she could carry. Yoruichi states she brought him back because, with some training, it may become possible for Ichigo to defeat Byakuya. Yoruichi tells Ichigo that aside from Byakuya, Ukitake was also there; even though Ganju is an intruder and Hanatarō is a traitor, Ukitake will not let them die because they were trying to save Rukia, who is one of his subordinates. She further assures him not to worry because in three days, she will make him strong enough to defeat Byakuya and save everyone.

        Before they begin training, Yoruichi explains that all Zanpakutō have two levels of release: the first one is called Shikai (initial release), and the second is
        Bankai
        (final release), and one must achieve both to become a captain. She adds that every captain in the
        Gotei 13
        , with the exception of Kenpachi Zaraki, can release Bankai.
        Moving on, Yoruichi explains to Ichigo that the power and forms of Shikai and Bankai are dependent on the Zanpakutō. They vary according to the wielder's strength and training, but in general, by learning Bankai, one's power can grow 5 to 10 times greater. She explains that even the most gifted Shinigami need at least 10 years of training to master Bankai. Ichigo tells her that he doesn't have that much time, but Yoruichi interrupts him, telling him she is fully aware of that; she will use a different, but more dangerous method to make him achieve Bankai in 3 days.

        Yoruichi, bringing out a large white doll, states it is a Tenshintai, a rare artifact of the Onmitsukidō, which can forcibly materialize the spirit of a Zanpakutō. Yoruichi goes on to explain what is required in order to achieve Bankai. She notes that materialization means the opposite of entering the Zanpakutō's world; instead, one must summon the Zanpakutō's spirit into the real world. She explains how to use the artifact: Ichigo must stab the doll with his

        </a>
        and it will forcefully materialize the spirit, while Yoruichi will use her power to keep it materialized. Before they start, she warns him that the time limit is three days, and he only has one chance at this. Before time is up, he must force Zangetsu to submit. Ichigo stabs the artifact, causing Zangetsu to materialize. Yoruichi asks Zangetsu if he heard her conversation with Ichigo, to which he responds he has. She tells him he will choose the method of combat, and asks if they can begin immediately. Zangetsu, telling her he will, prepares to battle.
        As Yoruichi watches the battle between Ichigo and Zangetsu unfold, she thinks about Ichigo's improvement in fighting, noting his amazingly fast growth.

        As the first day of training ends, Zangetsu returns to Ichigo, who relaxes in a hot spring. He becomes agitated when Yoruichi tells him she is going to join him. They get into an argument until she enters in her cat form. While resting, Ichigo tells Yoruichi the underground area they're in is similar to the one under Urahara's shop. Yoruichi tells him the one under the shop was most likely modeled after the area they are in now. She states the underground area was built when she and Urahara were young; Urahara dug the place in secret for their combat training. When they got older and she joined the Onmitsukidō and Urahara joined the
        Gotei 13
        , they would train in the secret underground area in order to help each other get stronger. Before she can finish, Ichigo interrupts her, having finally realized Urahara is a former member of the Gotei 13, making him a

        While Ichigo warms up for another day of training, Yoruichi ponders the possibility of extending his training, noting that Ichigo growth is far faster than a normal Shinigami's, though only his combat techniques are improving while his spiritual energy remains the same. She decides that if his spiritual energy does not increase within the next day, she will go with whatever state Ichigo has developed. She reasons that there isn't enough time for an extension, and it would be too dangerous at that point of training.

        Yoruichi is present when the secret underground training area is breached by Renji, who tells her and Ichigo Rukia's execution has been moved, taking place at noon the following day. Yoruichi is surprised by this new information, thinking there is no way Ichigo can attain Bankai in that small amount of time. Ichigo, refusing to give up, tells Yoruichi this training method was her idea, and she shouldn't give up before anyone else.
        Renji, eventually finishing training, asks Yoruichi if Ichigo will make it. She states she is not worried, for she is certain that Ichigo possesses the instinct necessary to learn Bankai.
        To help Ichigo in rescuing Rukia, she lends him the Tentōken, a cape which allows its user to fly by inserting some spirit power into it.

        Landing in a forest, they engage in hand-to-hand combat before putting some distance between themselves. Suì-Fēng comments that even though they have not seen each other in a long time, Yoruichi has not gotten any stronger. Yoruichi states that, on the contrary, she thinks Suì-Fēng has gotten weaker. Suì-Fēng states the Tenshiheisonban, the Shihōin Clan, has fallen, for if Yoruichi helping the Ryoka is revealed, her clan name will surely be removed from the list of the 4 great families.

Suì-Fēng warns her not to get cocky and think she is still better than her after all these years. Suì-Fēng states both the Onmitsukidō and the Executive Militia are now under her control, as Yoruichi's era ended long ago.

They move apart once again and Suì-Fēng warns her to not underestimate her, as it may not have occurred to Yoruichi, Suì-Fēng would use all of her power against her.

Appearing behind Yoruichi, she attempts a second strike, but Yoruichi uses Shunpo to escape. After gaining some distance, Yoruichi turns around and goes on the offensive, attacking Suì-Fēng with knives hidden in her boot. Suì-Fēng blocks the incoming knives and manages to land a second strike on Yoruichi, asking her if she now understands Suì-Fēng is stronger than her. Suì-Fēng reveals her new technique, which combines Kidō and Hakuda, exclaiming she has never used it in battle and has only recently invented it. Yoruichi, however, tells her it has a name:

Yoruichi stops the attacks by initiating a Shunkō powered punch, but stops short of actually hitting Suì-Fēng. Upset and unwilling to fight anymore, Suì-Fēng breaks down and cries, asking why Yoruichi did not take her with her. She bows down to Yoruichi in defeat.

She smashes into his back with such force that it destroys the surrounding area, and lands a direct punch with even more force, causing damage to an entire block. Urahara yells for Yoruichi to move away. Aizen quickly recovers, and before Yoruichi can fully dodge his counterattack, he destroys the armor on Yoruichi's left leg. As Aizen emerges from the rubble with his new form severely cracked, he asks them if this is all they have, stating that they better hurry up and make the next move, as he plans to crush them all, one by one, into tiny fragments, down to the very last remnant.

   When Urahara expresses his surprise at how the armor he created was destroyed by Aizen with one blow, Yoruichi tells him off for not building the armor properly. Urahara warns Yoruichi to keep away as they prepare to face the next attack, but she remarks that she will be fine as long as Aizen does not attack her exposed leg. Aizen's next blow takes her completely by surprise.
   Managing to escape Aizen's assault at the cost of her right arm-guard, Yoruichi complains to Kisuke when he asks if she is alright. She tells him she was able to block the attack because of the "half-finished" armor, but she would have simply dodged it without the armor. After they stop arguing, Kisuke launches a Kidō blast at Aizen. Yoruichi, taking advantage of this, attempts to attack Aizen, but he, anticipating their ploy, blocks her attack. She follows up with a Shunkō assault, knocking him to the ground, but Aizen blocks her next attack. Urahara interrupts by immobilizing Aizen with Benihime.
   Yoruichi, along with Kisuke and Isshin, are defeated by Aizen, who leaves for the real Karakura Town in Soul Society.

   ): An advanced technique which combines Hakuda with Kidō. This technique surrounds her back and arms with pressurized Kidō based on the element of lightning. The keisen uniform has no back or sleeves because they will rip apart when it is activated. Apart from enhancing her arms and legs for combat, the technique allows her to instantly neutralize an opponent's movement. The Kidō itself can be controlled and fired at opponents from her body, which creates massive explosions. Yoruichi's version of the technique was developed and studied by her a century ago; therefore, the technique is complete and the compressed Kidō is visible.
   While using this technique, her Reiatsu takes the form of white lightning.
   Her skill and control in its usage has progressed to the point of activation taking the form of a pair of lightning wings generated from her back.
