   The majority of ghosts peacefully move on to the Soul Society after their death. However, some stay in the living world to fulfill certain goals, such as looking after a loved one, protecting a particular location, or pursuing a grudge from beyond the grave.
   However, with only limited abilities to interact with the living, and by definition tied to their goals, many ghosts find they are unable to cope when their loved ones move on or old enemies forget them. At this point, some will become dangerously obsessed with fulfilling those goals, even if the means to fulfill them renders the soul empty: for example, killing anyone who comes near a loved one in order to keep them from hurting that person. In doing so, the ghost warps into a Hollow and, ironically, often makes the focus of their obsession into their first victim, such as what

   The process by which a soul becomes a Hollow usually takes months to years to complete, reflected by the length of the soul's
   Chain of Fate
   , which usually resides in the center of their chest, and connects to their bodies, if present.
   The Chain of Fate slowly corrodes over time, coinciding with the degradation of the soul's ties to the living world. The process can be accelerated under certain conditions, such as being attacked by a Hollow, giving into extreme despair, or using certain spiritual powers. When the chain completely decays, they become a Hollow when a hole opens up on their chest where the chain was attached, signifying they have lost their heart.

   Once a soul becomes a Hollow, it is driven by an eternal and insatiable hunger to devour other souls, living or dead, to fill the void caused by its descent. While their former obsession often becomes their first target, most Hollows will eventually become mindless creatures concerned only with finding the most potent souls to devour. Stronger and more evil Hollows are often able to retain some of their intelligence in Hollow form, making them more dangerous than the average Hollow. While most Hollows are evil, or at the very least mindless, at least a few are not, as is the case with
   Nel Tu
   and her Hollow companions. They are at least partly capable of camaraderie and loyalty, as seen with
   Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez
   and his companions while they were still Hollows; Grimmjow's subordinates voluntarily sacrificed parts of their bodies for the sake of Grimmjow's growth.

   All Hollows wear masks, which are formed from the hearts they had lost as Humans.
   This mask protects the naked instinct which is left in a being after the loss of its heart, and obscures the original identity of the Hollow.
   The masks of different Hollows can differ greatly in shape and form, but are always white and skull-like. The mask can be shattered, temporarily allowing the Hollow to regain its original identity, but it will regenerate after a short period once the Hollow takes over again.

Hollows vary in size, though it tends to be fairly consistent among the various classifications of Menos. In Hueco Mundo, some Hollows are no larger than common pets.
   Most common Hollows are about twice the size of an adult Human, though it can vary to a degree. Significantly large Hollows that tower over

  <p key="707be9fc-f429-4ace-a65d-8db0fa6fc2f7">
   Menos are created when the void within an ordinary Hollow's heart becomes so substantial Human souls are incapable of sustaining it, at which point it begins devouring fellow Hollows. These cannibal Hollows are attracted to one another, and a mass inter-devouring follows, resulting in a Gillian. Following this transformation, the Gillian can evolve twice more, first into an Adjuchas and finally into a Vasto Lorde, provided certain conditions are met.
   Menos evolution is not only contingent upon the Menos eating other Hollows, but also upon the Menos' ability to avoid being eaten. If another Hollow succeeds in devouring even a part of their body, evolution becomes impossible for the one who was wounded this way.
   Menos-class Hollows are considered so dangerous Soul Society sends only highly trained Shinigami teams to handle them.
   These incursions seem to be rare, however, as Menos rarely leave Hueco Mundo unless attracted by large sources of spiritual power or encouraged to by other forces. There are three categories of Menos: Gillian, Adjuchas, and Vasto Lorde.

   The process for the creation of a Vasto Lorde is unknown.
   Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez
   and his
   Fracciónes
   hypothesized that an Adjuchas can become a Vasto Lorde by devouring large amounts of Hollows; however,
   Shawlong Koufang
   and his group found this method to be ineffective.
   After devouring three thousand Hollows, Shawlong speculates that a Vasto Lorde is determined upon an individual's birth as a Hollow, or perhaps before that.

   Like Shinigami, Hollows have a multitude of combat skills and abilities, most of which are usually unique to specific Hollows. The more powerful Hollows, however, have access to a range similar techniques of greater power or use than their own unique skills. Hollows usually acquire energy to power their abilities by devouring souls, but smaller ones can ingest energy from the atmosphere when in realms with a high concentration of spiritual energy, such as Hueco Mundo.

     Soul-Body Separation
    </b>
    : Two middle class Hollow,
    Shrieker
    and
    Acidwire
    , have used this ability. This technique allows a Hollow to forcibly extract a living spirit from his/her body. It is usually not used because Hollows tend to go after Pluses, who have no physical or living body to speak of. Acidwire used this on his younger sister, Orihime, so she could see and converse with him.
    Shrieker used it for more sinister means, causing the young boy
    Yūichi Shibata
    to be trapped within the body of a parakeet for three months while the Hollow chased him.
    The soul is still attached by the Chain of Fate and can be saved.
    , but if it is broken (in Yūichi's case), the soul can prevent the
    Encroachment
    so long as he/she is placed inside a soulless body or animal.

     Acidic Touch
    </b>
    : Many Hollows, like
    Shrieker
    and
    Acidwire
    , have displayed this ability, although Rukia implies all Hollows possess this power. When a Hollow grabs a Human with their hands, the spot where the person was grabbed is burned as if acid were poured onto it. This occurred when Orihime was grabbed by the leg,
    , and when Chad's back was wounded.
    These wounds seem to allow the Hollow's Reiatsu to seep into the person, causing great pain to the victim. The wounds can heal if given enough time, and it is unknown if this ability works on Shinigami or other spiritually powerful beings.
