   Yuzu's appearance is a stark contrast to her sister's. Yuzu has short light blonde hair.
   ,with short bangs hanging over the right side of her forehead. She also wears a red hair clip on the left side of her head. Her eyes are dark brown and appear much softer than Karin's. Yuzu dresses more girlishly when compared to her sister. She frequently wears a green hooded sweatshirt, and an apron when cooking. After 17 months, Yuzu's hair is shoulder length and usually styles it in two pigtails tied with pink cherry bobbles behind her ears, with her hair clip on the right pigtail. She now wears a
   sailor fuku
   for school.
  </p>
  <p key="b2d1aaa6-7a24-403b-8af2-7ccae6cd3ccc">
   Ten years later, Yuzu's hair is more akin to her younger appearance, with no pig tails. She has a small bust.

    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="46afe9eb-6218-4deb-afb2-056b487dda4a">
   Compared to Karin, Yuzu is more soft-spoken. She is also the more empathetic of the two girls. She takes care of the housework, such as cooking meals and tidying up the living space, on a daily basis. She also regularly cuts Ichigo's hair.
  </p>
  <p key="73ade5da-ffe4-424e-85ea-0302a098d758">
   Unlike her siblings, Yuzu is only able to see faint outlines of spirits as she is able to inform Ichigo that another ghost is present while they are about to sit down to dinner
   Both girls help out in the family's clinic. Yuzu greatly admires her brother and looks up to him a lot. It was the image of Yuzu in the arms of a
   <a href="Hollow.html" key="2af6a5c0-8b49-466b-8373-d2bcfbac9718" title="Hollow">
    Hollow
   </a>
   that initially shocked Ichigo into action despite the fear he'd been feeling at the time having never seen a Hollow before.
   She tends to get very worried and upset whenever Ichigo disappears for any period longer than a day due to her mother complex. Unlike Karin, Yuzu has maintained a much more emotional side than her twin, not holding back when displaying upset tears of worry or cries of joy when the time arises, while Karin would remain almost aloof to most things outside of soccer or her father's annoyances.
  </p>
  <p key="12cd81a5-7bfa-472b-8678-6b13d5177f9d">
   Yuzu has a very playful side to her as well, despite the increased responsibility she takes on when regarding the housework and looking after her family after the death of their mother. She has discovered
   Kon
   , although she hasn't discovered his true identity. She likes to play with him, calling him "Bostov", and this often involves her dressing him in feminine clothes and gluing on unwanted accessories, much to his chagrin. During these times, the childlike and girlish aspect of her personality can be seen in contrast to the responsible side that is usually present. She is also quite gullible due to her empathy, such as when she is moved by
   Rukia
   's false tears and allows her to stay at their house.
   She is very close to her father, probably the closest out of his children, both of them often being chastised by
   Karin
   when they are nosy about Ichigo and his new friends.

  <p key="63ba859e-0837-41b7-82b9-d4b176f434ab">
   Little is known about Yuzu's history. She was born, along with her twin sister Karin, to
   Isshin
   and
   Masaki Kurosaki
   eleven years ago,
   the younger sister of
   <a href="Ichigo Kurosaki.html" key="01011b00-3963-4ced-ace0-2a03b213c126" title="Ichigo Kurosaki">
    Ichigo Kurosaki

   . She was born without the power to see ghosts that the rest of her siblings possess.
  </p>
  <p key="cd470bf6-9c99-4e65-b2db-d947796a5ec8">
   When she was little Yuzu lost her mother to the Hollow known as
   Grand Fisher
   when he attacked Masaki and Ichigo as they left the dojo where Ichigo had been training at the time.
   Despite only being four years old at the time, the Kurosaki twins were forced to mature much faster than usual for girls their age. Yuzu decided to become the mother figure in their household and began to take care of all the menial jobs around the house, becoming an exceptional cook by the time she was eleven years old in the current timeline.
   She also takes the time to help her father out at the Kurosaki Clinic along with Karin taking the role of nurses that are absent.

    Ichigo Kurosaki
   </a>
   returns home from helping a
   ghost
   find peace. When he enters the house his father,
   Isshin Kurosaki
   , kicks him across the room. They begin fighting with each other and Yuzu tells them to stop it since their food is getting cold. Her sister,
   Karin Kurosaki
   simply tells Yuzu not to bother them and asks for more food. Yuzu then notices a
   ghost
   behind Ichigo and tells him that he already has another person to help. Ichigo then begins complaining about having to help ghosts all the time and Karin tells him it must be tough to have the ability to see ghosts. Yuzu then states that she's envious of Ichigo for being able to see ghosts as she's only able to see a blur. Karin tells her that she isn't envious of Ichigo as she doesn't believe in ghosts but Yuzu points out that she's able to see ghosts as well. However, Karin tells her that even if you can see ghosts, if you don't believe in them then it's the same as them not existing. Karin then decides to change the subject and states that she thought of a new project about frolicking with the ghosts in the winds of early summer during May. As Yuzu tells Karin that last month the project was to go look at flowers, Ichigo yells at Karin for thinking of ways to make money by using him. Isshin then shouts that he's found an opening and kicks Ichigo yet again. Ichigo decides to go to bed and Yuzu yells at him to come back.
  </p>
  <p key="c8c577da-5424-430a-8b74-08b695923ee0">
   Karin then states that he's gone and tells Isshin that it's all his fault, which ends up surprising him. Yuzu then tells Isshin then Ichigo's been having a hard time since more and more ghosts have been coming and Isshin is shocked that he talks to Yuzu about things like that. Yuzu then states that she's going to take dinner to Ichigo's room later.
   Isshin decides to go up to Ichigo's room and the two get into another fight, causing Yuzu to take care of his injuries.
   Later, Yuzu, along with the rest of her family, is attacked by a huge

    Hollow
   </a>
   .
   After the Kurosaki's are defeated by the Hollow, Yuzu is picked up and taken outside by it. As she's about to get killed, Ichigo yells out at the Hollow and attacks it with a bat. He is easily knocked back though and just as the Hollow is about to finish him off,

  <p key="b9d2dd1e-63de-45bf-a2ea-695b93663861">
   The next day, Yuzu is all healed and her memory is wiped of the whole incident believing it to have been a truck accident along with the rest of her family.
   Later she enters her brother's room and asks him if he's seen her dress. However, he isn't in there and Ichigo appears behind her, telling her she shouldn't open the door to his room without knocking first. Yuzu notices that he took a bath and complains that she wanted to go in too, and Ichigo tells her that she should learn to go by herself already. She states that Ichigo's become colder since he entered high school, but Ichigo tells her he hasn't and then states that he hasn't seen her dress.

   Later when Ichigo returns home from school, Yuzu and Karin frantically run around the house trying to help patients. Ichigo asks Yuzu what's happening and she tells Ichigo that there was a car accident at the intersection.
   Another person then arrives and Yuzu attempts to pick him up but can't. Isshin then runs over there stating that a big guy has arrived and he tells Ichigo to come over and help pick him up. However, when he gets there he identifies the person as
   Chad
   , Ichigo's classmate. They bring him into a room and Yuzu notices that his back is badly wounded. Isshin attempts to help him but Chad tells him he's all right. However, as he attempts to leave, he collapses and Isshin tells Yuzu and Karin to get a bed for him.

   The next day Yuzu tells Ichigo that it's time for breakfast and Ichigo wonders where Karin is. Yuzu tells him that she didn't want any breakfast and notes that she wasn't feeling too good. As Ichigo states that Karin not feeling well is a rare occurrence, Isshin enters the room and tells them that Chad has disappeared from his hospital room.
   Yuzu then goes to school and decides to go to the bathroom to check up on Karin. However, when she goes to the bathroom stall Karin is hiding in, she simply yells at her to go back to her classroom. A student named
   Midori Tōno
   then goes up to Yuzu and asks her how Karin is doing. As Yuzu begins to explain Midori tells her to forget about the question since she already knows the answer. Yuzu then notices that she has stopped yelling, and Karin leaves the bathroom stall she was hiding in. She then states that she's leaving early and tells Yuzu to get her stuff.
   Later, back at home, Yuzu sleeps together with Karin.

   During school, Yuzu sees "

However, she immediately sees "Ichigo" jumping on top of the walls and as Yuzu calls out to him, Karin covers her mouth. She tells Yuzu that there is no way that person is Ichigo and that he can't be human. She then warns Yuzu not to tell anyone about this as he already stands out enough as it is. However, Midori spots "Ichigo" and Karin threatens her, convincing her that she didn't see anything at all.
   Yuzu then overhears three kids (
   Ino
   ,
   Hashigami
   , and
   Kaneda
   ) claim that someone with orange hair broke their video game and Karin tells her that this should be enough evidence to convince her that this person isn't really Ichigo.

   Yuzu enters her brother's room and as she begins to tell Ichigo something she notices that he's hiding something in his closet and asks what he's up to. He states that he isn't doing anything and asks her what she wants with him so early in the morning. Yuzu tells him it isn't that early, and explains that
   Mizuiro Kojima
   has been waiting for him. She then tells him to just apologize to him for making him wait from his window.
   After school is over, due to the anniversary of her
   mother's
   death tomorrow, Isshin has a family meeting about what they'll do the next day but claims that because he's their dad he'll get final say in everything. Karin claims that this isn't a meeting then and Isshin tells her to raise her hand when she wants to speak. He then explains that Yuzu will be the lunch staff and that Karin will be the luggage carrier. After the meeting is over, Yuzu and Karin go to sleep.

   The next day Yuzu and the rest of her family head to the site of Masaki's death. As they head up a hill, Yuzu complains about how steep it is and Isshin begins to cheer for her and then goes up the hill on just his hands. Karin simply tells Yuzu to ignore him since he'll never stop if he is encouraged. However, Isshin states that he'll never stop even if they don't look and begins to fight with them. Karin eventually kicks Isshin all the way back down to the bottom of the hill. Yuzu and Karin then notice

He worriedly says that he doesn't and Karin states that she doesn't know the person either. Ichigo then shouts that he remembers the person from middle school and states that he's going to talk to her alone. As he leaves, he tells Yuzu and Karin to visit Masaki's grave first. Yuzu is confused by this and Karin tells her that they should just leave him alone.
   Later, Yuzu and the rest of her family make it to the grave and Isshin decides to have his annual "Ba-Dum Kurosaki's family's tombstone domino rally" and explains the rules to his game. Yuzu tells him that if he doesn't stop then he won't have any dinner.

   After a little while, Yuzu begins to cry about her mother's death and Karin tells her she shouldn't cry every time they come here. Karin then hears Isshin blow his whistle for a family meeting, and the two of them head over to him. However, as they go there, Karin notices a female ghost and decides to talk with her.
   She doesn't return though and Yuzu yells for her to come back. As she heads towards her Karin yells for her not to come any closer.
   Karin is then attacked by a

   She is then put by a rock along with an unconscious Karin.

   After that day, Yuzu's memories are erased and she goes back to her home along with the rest of her family. One day, she notices a
   stuffed animal
   and wonders if it's Karin's.
   She then tells the stuffed animal that she'll give him a bath. After she cleans him she puts the stuffed animal in a dress and places it next to two other stuffed animals called Melon and Cookie, whom she states are the stuffed animals parents. She tells the stuffed animal to listen to them and then puts a flower on it so she could mark who the child of the family is.

   Later, Yuzu and her father watch a TV show they love about a spirit medium called
   Don Kanonji
   . As they're watching, it they do a weird pose and Ichigo asks them what they're doing. Yuzu explains about the show she's watching but Ichigo states that what he really meant was what the pose they did was. However, they ignore him and do the pose yet again.
   She then tells Ichigo about how amazing he is and tells him that he can see spirits. Ichigo tells her that he doesn't know about that, but Yuzu begins yelling at him, forcing Ichigo to change his opinion. Yuzu then states that she wants to see ghosts like Don Kanonji and begins watching him again. She then screams all of a sudden and Ichigo asks her what's wrong. Yuzu tells him that next weeks episode is going to take place in

   Because of this, the Kurosaki's go to watch Don Kanonji live.
   Isshin then yells to Yuzu that the show is about to start and Yuzu tells him to be quiet.
   As the show goes on, Ichigo gets tackled by security and Yuzu wonders what's happening. As Isshin attempts to imitate him, Yuzu yells at him not to do anything.
   A little while later, some glass breaks and Isshin protects Yuzu and Karin from the glass. After he asks them if they're all right, he collapses, stating that he is satisfied to die for their sake. Yuzu simply ignores him and yells out for Ichigo.

   Later, Ichigo takes some leftovers of food and Yuzu complains about this. Ichigo states that this is his midnight snack and Yuzu tells him that she's not going to care when he gets fat.

   After returning from a fire works festival from a neighboring city, Yuzu, Karin, and Isshin see Ichigo and they all happily tackle him. Yuzu tries to give Ichigo a chocolate banana but he declines. She then begins shouting at him and Ichigo asks her if she's drunk. Isshin confirms this and states that Yuzu got drunk when they bought some wine that they mistook for juice. Isshin then states that it doesn't matter anymore and tells Ichigo and his friends that they saved a seat at the opposite bank at 7:00 a.m. They all then leave for their destination.
   A little while later Yuzu and Karin pass out, and Ichigo is forced to carry them.
   Later at night, while Yuzu and Karin are asleep, Ichigo tells them that he's leaving.
