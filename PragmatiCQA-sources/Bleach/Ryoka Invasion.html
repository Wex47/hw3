Though an astonished Rukia begins to believe that he might be serious, Gin reveals that he was just joking and walks off, leaving Rukia to scream in despair over the resolve she previously held in the face of her impending death being shattered. Meanwhile, at the pavilion, Kenpachi overpowers both Komamura and Tōsen with his raw physical strength, and when he demands that they at least use their Bankai before dying, Tōsen agrees to do so.
