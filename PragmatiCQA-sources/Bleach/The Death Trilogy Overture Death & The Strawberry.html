After pulling Ichigo outside to speak in private, Rukia reveals she has lost all her power and asserts Ichigo must take up her Shinigami duties until she regains it. Ichigo initially refuses, but Rukia takes him to a park where
   Hexapodus
   is chasing the
   Soul of a young boy
   and forces him to not intervene as she explains that he must be willing to help everyone equally. However, Ichigo turns Rukia's logic back on her due to her intervention the previous night and

   Sora Inoue
   who died three years ago. That night,
   Acidwire
   appears and attacks Ichigo. Though he lands a blow to Acidwire's mask, Ichigo does not purify him and instead sees Sora's face underneath before he escapes, forcing Rukia to reveal Hollows are former Humans.

   At her house, Orihime eats dinner with
   Tatsuki Arisawa
   and discusses her romantic interest in Ichigo. Suddenly, Orihime finds that her teddy bear
   Enraku
   has been torn, and when she picks it up and finds blood seeping out, Acidwire pushes her Soul out of her body. While Ichigo leaps over the rooftops toward the house with Rukia filling him in on how Hollows are formed, Acidwire wounds Tatsuki and bears down on her. Though she is not sure what is happening, Orihime intervenes and tries to get Tatsuki's attention, only to learn that she cannot see or hear either Orihime or Acidwire. Angered by Orihime not recognizing him, Acidwire attacks her, but Ichigo manages to arrive in time and intercepts Acidwire's blow with his Zanpakutō.
  </p>
  <p key="242dd8c0-a051-4286-88cc-5d50f5d3cace">
   As Ichigo sees that Orihime's Soul is outside her body, Acidwire declares that she is already dead and slams Ichigo into the ground outside the house. Acidwire turns his attention back to Orihime and reveals that he is her brother before explaining how lonely and sad he has been ever since Orihime stopped praying for him after meeting Tatsuki and Ichigo. Despite Acidwire's plea for her to come with him, Orihime only asks him why he hurt her friends, and when an enraged Acidwire proclaims that he will kill her, Ichigo severs his hands and berates him for saying such a thing to his own sister.
  </p>
  <p key="127cee7a-53c6-4480-9c40-b9d4cbb95210">
   Acidwire recalls how he raised Orihime almost from birth after fleeing their abusive parents and asserts that she can die for him if she will not live for him before attempting to devour her. However, Orihime responds to his attack by wrapping her arms around his head, shocking Acidwire, and explains that she only stopped praying and started telling him about her friends because she wanted him to share in the happiness she experienced in her life rather than the sadness. Experiencing a brief moment of lucidity due to this, Acidwire allows Rukia to begin healing Orihime and uses Ichigo's

   The next day, after learning that Sado is missing from the Kurosaki Clinic, Ichigo asks around for him at school, but is unable to find him there. At her elementary school, an ill Karin vomits in the bathroom and decides to go home early. As he runs around Karakura Town, Ichigo is informed by Rukia that the Hollow cannot be located until it comes back to the

   to detect the location of Yūichi himself. In an abandoned factory, Sado continues running from the Hollow with Yūichi and promises to save the latter's mother. Upon encountering Karin, Rukia has Ichigo take her home while she goes after Sado alone, but as she leaves, Karin reveals that Yūichi saw his mother get murdered as a boy.

   As she chases after Sado, Rukia is confronted by

Realizing that Rukia is a Shinigami, Shrieker reminisces about the two he has already devoured during their attempts to save Yūichi, leading Rukia to conclude that he is the one pursuing Yūichi. Setting down Yūichi in order to help Rukia, Sado runs back and punches Shrieker away from her, though Shrieker quickly observes that Sado cannot actually see him. When Shrieker takes to the air in order to avoid further punches, Rukia informs Sado of where he is as he breaks off a telephone pole and slams it into Shrieker.

   detonates them with his tongue

  <p key="8d3417bc-0190-4b36-84fe-4a7607ac1df3">
   As Sado approaches with Yūichi in his arms, Ichigo, having been
   pushed
   out of his body by Rukia, outmaneuvers Shrieker's attacks and corners him with his Zanpakutō against the Hollow's neck, where he demands to know if Shrieker killed Yūichi's parents. While Yūichi blames himself for all this because he just wanted to bring his mother back to life, shocking Rukia, Shrieker reveals that he was a serial killer in life whom Yūichi inadvertently killed after he killed Yūichi's mother and explains that he made a deal with Yūichi to bring his mother back to life if he could successfully flee for three months, though he did not actually have the ability to do this. Enraged by this, Ichigo shoves Shrieker's leeches back in his mouth and rips out his tongue.
  </p>

   With Shrieker reeling from this, Ichigo drives his Zanpakutō into the Hollow's leg in order to make him feel the same helplessness as his victims before

At the Kurosaki Clinic, Ichigo finds Kon, who tells him Rukia has run away, and reads Rukia's letter, which warns him to go into hiding and not come after her.

   Urahara continues training Ichigo for the next five days,
   teaching him useful combat strategies like determining how many attacks an opponent can perform in succession and exploiting the limits of their techniques.
   At one point, Urahara begins pushing Ichigo during their sparring in order to press him into learning how to use his

Though Ichigo is not certain that this is possible due to the circumstances of his first conscious usage of it, Urahara continues pushing him and denies his crew the opportunity to tend to Ichigo's injuries. Upon being told by Urahara that his blade is filled with the fear of death and that he should instead focus on killing his enemy and keeping himself and his loved ones alive, Ichigo finds the resolve to kill and succeeds in firing a

   On August 1st, the day after the conclusion of Ichigo's training with Urahara, he reunites with Keigo and Mizuiro as they get together to watch the fireworks that night. After Tatsuki arrives with Sado and Orihime, where she explains how she lost the final match of

   due to a broken arm, the group walks through Karakura Town for a few hours. Upon learning they are still not at their destination, Tatsuki proposes they simply sit on the riverbank and watch, but a drunken Isshin arrives with his daughters and reveals he has been saving seats since 7 A.M. for the fireworks. When his family and friends run off, Ichigo notes he should follow them and does so, leaving Orihime and Tatsuki to discuss Orihime's upcoming trip. That night, as he carries his sleeping sisters home on his back, Ichigo steels his resolve to go to Soul Society.

However, upon close examination, Hiyosu and Akon are shocked by the level of skill used to produce it, with Akon claiming such skill would be grounds for permanent banishment from Soul Society. On August 8th, at 1 A.M., Ichigo and his friends receive a message from Urahara telling them to meet in front of his shop. After being given a protective charm by Isshin, Ichigo meets up with Orihime, Sado, and Uryū, the latter of whom justifies his presence by claiming he is coming along for a rematch with the Shinigami after his training. Greeting the group, Urahara requests they move inside so he can explain the details.
