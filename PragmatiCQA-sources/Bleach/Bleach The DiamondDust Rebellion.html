When the scores for the students are posted, Kusaka observes that seeing Hitsugaya's score confirmed that he was a genius. Hitsugaya and Kusaka cut through dummies in combat training while Kusaka asserts that he is not going to let Hitsugaya beat him next time.

When Kusaka steps in view at the other end of the alleyway, Shunsui demands to know who he is, but Kusaka does not answer, leading Shunsui to claim that it is rude of Kusaka to not introduce himself. Identifying Shunsui by name, Kusaka observes that his cavalier attitude disguises his keen intellect and shrewd disposition.

Rukia calls out to Ichigo as the dragon crashes into the ground, creating a large amount of purple ice, which Ichigo is left frozen inside of. While Rukia stares at this in shock, Kusaka notes his power is growing stronger and puts his mask back on before telling Yin and Yang that he will leave the rest to them as he departs. Rukia charges towards them, and Yang clashes with her while Yin slashes at her with her whip.

   Telling Rangiku to stay back, Hitsugaya asserts that this is his fight while Kusaka demands to know what the meaning of this is and claims that the Shinigami are the ones Hitsugaya should fight. When Hitsugaya tells Kusaka that he is evil and it was never his intention to be on his side, Mayuri wonders why Hitsugaya deserted his post if he did not intend to betray the Gotei 13 and Suì-Fēng wonders why he attacked them when they tried to arrest Kusaka, who asks Hitsugaya if he wants to fight him and if killing Kusaka once was not enough for Hitsugaya.

While Hitsugaya and Kusaka clash, Rukia notes that she thinks she understands and recounts how Kusaka was once a noble man who swore his loyalty to Soul Society. Rukia asserts that he would have been a great Shinigami if it were not for the twin Zanpakutō, but because of his duel with Hitsugaya, he lost his honor and his life in addition to

   Confirming this, Ichigo observes that Hitsugaya blames himself for everything which has happened and Rukia explains that Hitsugaya could not bear the thought of destroying him again because he had attained everything Kusaka wanted by becoming a Shinigami captain. While Rukia notes that it was too painful, Ichigo theorizes that seeing Kusaka again must have been devastating and Hitsugaya was so racked with guilt that he deserted his post and went after him in an attempt to settle things, knowing that he would be accused of treason and that it could cost him his life.

   While Hitsugaya calls out to Kusaka, Ichigo appears before him and asserts that there is no need for him to suffer by himself anymore, but Hitsugaya merely tells him to move out of his way. Ichigo tells Hitsugaya that he has to let them help because he is not the only one affected by this, he is not the only one who has suffered, and he is not the only one who feels pain. When Hitsugaya says he is no longer a captain, Ichigo punches him in the face, knocking him down, and criticizes him for having tried to endure all of this alone and refusing to let his friends help.

   Ichigo asks Hitsugaya if he has thought about how this makes them feel, and as Hitsugaya looks up, Ichigo admits that he also used to think he was being strong by refusing to depend on others like him once. In the past, as a young Ichigo asks Yuzu and Karin why they are so excited while standing on a riverbank, Yuzu begins to cry as Karin asks him why he is smiling and reveals that they were worried sick about him, leading Ichigo to wonder why. Crouching down, Isshin pats Yuzu and Karin on the head, prompting them to run and cry into his shirt, and assures Ichigo that he knows he is trying to be strong before explaining that sometimes he has to share his feelings with them.

Tearing up as well, Ichigo hugs his father. In the present, Ichigo explains that he learned people just become weak if they keep their emotions inside of them. Getting to his feet, Hitsugaya wipes the blood off of his mouth and looks around before telling Ichigo to prepare to fight because he is coming. The tornado around Kusaka dissipates, revealing he has transformed into a humanoid dragon composed of purple ice.

As Ichigo calls after him, a laughing Kenpachi stabs Kusaka's midsection, destroying it, to the surprise of the other Shinigami. Disappointed, Kenpachi wonders if this is it before Kusaka grabs his Zanpakutō and generates a large amount of ice, which shatters as a cackling Kusaka flies off the edge of the hill, bringing Kenpachi with him. Kusaka asserts that Kenpachi's attacks have no effect on him and he is invincible, only for a chuckling Kenpachi to claim that he is starting to like him.

As he calls Kenpachi a nuisance, Kusaka fires a barrage of ice projectiles after him, which embed themselves in the ground below, and flies away while laughing. Kusaka lands on a post as the area underneath him is encased in purple ice, which grows larger, and his legs merge with the ice as his wings grow in length and size.

Reaching the top, Ichigo attacks Kusaka, who fires a powerful beam of yellow energy at him, stopping his attack. With Ichigo trying to push through the beam, Hitsugaya's ice dragon breaks through the ice platform and constricts Kusaka before biting deep into his neck.

   A pillar of blue light extends from Kusaka's neck into the sky as the rest of his body shatters. As the blue light begins to erode the dome, Yoruichi realizes that Ichigo did it as Yang finally shatter. The surrounding Gillians dissolve while the ice tower begins to break apart. Moving to Ichigo, Hitsugaya deactivates his Bankai, and as the dust clears to reveal a panting Kusaka, Ichigo tells Hitsugaya to take it from here. Assuming a battle stance, Hitsugaya declares that it is over, prompting Kusaka to pull his Zanpakutō out of the ice before assuming a battle stance as well.

As Kusaka begins to disperse into blue energy due to having been impaled, Hitsugaya tells hims that they will always be friends, and Kusaka thanks him as he states that he needed to know this before dispersing completely. While Hitsugaya bids Kusaka farewell, the blue energy rises into the sky.

With light breaking through the clouds, Ichigo asserts that Kusaka stayed true to his feelings before noting that he put all of them through a lot of trouble, causing Hitsugaya to chuckle. When Ichigo tells him that they should head back, Hitsugaya agrees and looks at him before telling Ichigo to address him as Captain.

When Hitsugaya notes that they should head back, Rangiku protests this and asks Hitsugaya if they can call it a day before revealing that she knows of a great hot spring nearby.
