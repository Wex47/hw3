   with high cheekbones, grey eyes and long wavy brown hair. His hair is tied in a long ponytail and has long bangs that frame the left side of his face. He also has a noticeable amount of body hair on his chest, feet, and arms. He wears a Sugegasa straw hat and a pink, flowered lady's kimono, which he drapes across his shoulders and over his captain's uniform. Although his haori and obi sash are cheap, his pin-wheel hairpins are very expensive. He does not wear tabi with his sandals. He has thin facial hair around his mouth and on his cheeks. Over a hundred years before

   's defection, Shunsui only had facial hair on his upper mouth. After the battle with the Wandenreich, Shunsui wears an eyepatch over his right eye that was damaged during the conflict. The top half of his right ear is sliced off at a slight tilt with a scar along his right temple.
  </p>
  <p key="dddae7e1-8007-40e5-b276-fcc9e839878d">
   As a child, Shunsui had shorter and messier hair. He wore a flower patterned kimono.

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="8b60df15-a55d-4bde-ae2f-da2980ba2af1">
   Shunsui is a laid-back and flamboyant man, evident in his style of dress and general attitude, and is usually smiling. In his off time, he often drinks sake in bars and naps. He likes steamed buns that go with sake, but dislikes
   powdered green tea
   . Other times, he likes to chase after women; particularly his lieutenant, Nanao Ise, whom he calls "my Nanao-chan" (Lil' Nanao in the English Dub) and his former lieutenant,
   Lisa Yadōmaru
   . Shunsui tends to use a more casual speech style than many other captains. He generally refers to his fellow captains and Shinigami by their first name followed by an honorific. He wrote a romance novel titled "Rose-colored Path", which runs in
   <a href="Seireitei Communication.html" key="920f4d74-341c-4566-adc4-d9943c77825f" title="Seireitei Communication">
    Seireitei Communication
   </a>
   , but is very unpopular. Shunsui does not receive a single fan letter or gift for his birthday from his readers, but he is not bothered by this at all.
  </p>
  <p key="2882ce90-ad1a-4fef-a9ee-579cfca23dde">
   Shunsui is a peace-loving man who will always try to talk his way out of battles, though he does not wish to insult opponents by refusing to fight. He has a great distaste for fighting, telling
   <a href="Love Aikawa.html" key="877a6798-3742-418e-a39b-bd4f41846b72" title="Love Aikawa">
    Love Aikawa
   </a>
   that "it doesn't matter whether you owe someone or they owe you; as soon as you start fighting, you are in the wrong either way."
   The slightly eccentric Shunsui also seems to like making an impression on opponents.
   Though Shunsui tries to talk his way out of a fight, he will fight when the situation demands it, such as in his battle with
   <a href="Coyote Starrk.html" key="ca4ecba0-1e5b-4da3-bea4-a3803ab840bb" title="Coyote Starrk">
    Coyote Starrk
   </a>
   . When Starrk asked that they only pretend to fight, he declined the offer, though noted that he prefers to do the same.
   Shunsui maintains a level of honor and integrity when engaging in battle. He refuses to fight with children or even in the presence of a child.
   He also dislikes taking the life of innocent people, as he left Chad alive when Nanao offered to kill him.
   He always maintains a veil of respect for his opponent, is polite in combat situations
   and prefers to fight one on one.
   When fighting powerful opponents, like Starrk or Aizen, Shunsui rarely loses his cool, going as far as to make small talk and joke around with his opponents.
  </p>
  <p key="445e73ec-68f6-4360-8d25-6da7f372d8c4">
   Despite being one of the strongest and oldest captains, Shunsui retains a level of humility and is not overly arrogant about his strength, acknowledging that
   Tōshirō Hitsugaya
   has the potential to become stronger than himself given enough time.
  </p>
  <p key="634570a2-92b0-4e49-8955-6dee498553cd">
   However, Shunsui also harbors a deep sense of guilt over the misfortune that has afflicted those close to him, such as the death of his brother and the execution of Nanao's
   mother
   , and considers it a burden too heavy for him to carry alone.

  <p key="755aecf7-84d4-4288-a0fd-a20800fc2ed3">
   Shunsui is the second son of the high-ranking noble Kyōraku family. While Shunsui was still a young boy, his older brother married the head of the
   Ise Clan
   who would eventually become
   <a href="Nanao Ise.html" key="f673e9f4-d78f-4bd6-a50f-cedb894f864d" title="Nanao Ise">
    Nanao Ise
   </a>
   's
   mother
   . Though Shunsui and his brother did not really get along, living with his brother became more comfortable, and Shunsui would visit him often. At one point, Shunsui found his brother receiving a hairpin from Nanao's mother and noted that he has mellowed out in his old age, only to be informed that this was the kindness of Nanao's mother at work.
   After his brother died, during which he was entrusted with hairpins that formerly belonged to Nanao's mother,
   Shunsui was entrusted with the Zanpakutō of the Ise family by his brother's widow, and his

   Shunsui was assured by Nanao's mother that he would not suffer from carrying

  </p>
  <p key="8314cb29-969e-46db-967a-0c6aebb282be">
   Despite being of such old and prestigious lineage, he disliked studying and training, and preferred to chase the ladies, although being told by Captain-Commander
   Yamamoto
   that he was able to see the truth and was wise for his age. Because of this, he was sent against his will to the
   <a href="Shin'ō Academy.html" key="c4af2700-8360-469f-9eb0-b67839d2a714" title="Shin'ō Academy">
    Shin'ō Reijutsu Academy
   </a>
   (Shinigami Academy). At some point in Shunsui's Academy days, Shunsui trespassed into Yamamoto's room. After being chastised by Yamamoto, he asked about the painting in his room, and Yamamoto replies that it was a monster that caused strife when it was around.
   While there, he came to know
   Jūshirō Ukitake
   , who would become his best friend and fellow captain. He, along with Jūshirō Ukitake, was one of the first Shinigami to become a captain through the Shinigami Academy. Furthermore, he was personally trained by Yamamoto.
   He and Ukitake are the oldest captains among the
   Gotei 13
   , with the exception of

    Retsu Unohana

   and Yamamoto himself. It was stated that the four of them have been captains of the Gotei 13 for at least 100 years, as of 110 years before the current time.
  </p>
  <p key="12333ae4-6ad3-4586-bfdb-0fa10ba47399">
   At some point during his academy days, Shunsui was informed by Ukitake that Nanao's mother had been executed for losing one of the cared treasures, which prompted him to admit that he preferred to learn of such things sooner rather than later.
  </p>
  <p key="b84aea4f-98c2-4a9b-8cc3-232cc7a0119b">
   110 years ago he had a unique relationship with his Lieutenant
   Lisa Yadōmaru
   : in contrast to his relationship with his current Lieutenant

   , Lisa was more outgoing and perverted in a way much like his own personality, but he found that his position required him to be the "adult" in the situation.
   He was also the first to casually mention, to a curious Lieutenant

   9 years later, Shunsui was present at an emergency meeting called by Captain-Commander Yamamoto. He decided to create an investigative team to locate the missing
   9th Division
   squad members. When he gave out the orders, Yamamoto ordered Shunsui to guard the
   <a href="Seireitei.html" key="da827bdf-bd3a-41a5-9722-d2fd2652060b" title="Seireitei">

   When Yamamoto decided to send both Kidō Captain
   Tessai Tsukabishi
   and Kidō Lieutenant
   Hachigen Ushōda

   , telling him not to worry about his lieutenant,
   Hiyori Sarugaki
   , who was sent to help the 9th Division, because she was strong, though not as strong as Lisa.
  </p>
  <p key="3713b7cf-ffd5-4209-a0ef-da2bdeea43d5">
   During his time on guard, he met up with some squad members that were also on guard and congratulated them for keeping watch on the Seireitei. He also noticed Lieutenant

   taking a night walk, muttering to himself that he was maybe over-thinking things before leaving. Later in his barracks he was addressed by a very young
   <a href="Nanao Ise.html" key="13494cd9-6c6a-4b0e-adb4-9c26e06aec39" title="Nanao Ise">
    Nanao Ise

   , who had come to see his lieutenant,
   Lisa Yadōmaru
   . Shunsui then remembered that Nanao always came to him around the first of every month to have Lisa read to her. Nanao confirmed this, only to be told that Lisa was away on a mission, but would be back soon.
   Soon afterward, Shunsui changed his attire by removing his hairpins and switching his kimono. He was present to greet newly-inducted members of the 8th Division, whom he informed that he was cordial toward young ladies and indifferent toward men.

        After his flashy appearance Kyōraku sits down and tells Chad that he dislikes fighting and offers him something to drink, something Chad responds to by a violent "No" because it is forbidden for minors to drink, something Kyōraku also realizes is a problem.

        Chad politely asks the captain to move out the way as he himself would also like to avoid the fight. However, once Chad engages him, he deflects Chad’s first attack with one arm, and then proceeds to dodge all of the subsequent attacks.
        Trying to stop Chad from going further, he asks Chad why he continues to fight, and for what reason. Despite his attempts to stop him both through speech and action, Chad continues to come at him.
        Seeing his determination, Shunsui decides reluctantly to wound him, though he tells Chad that he plans to kill him, having no choice. Taking out his two swords, he watches as Chad runs towards him, then dodges Chad’s attack and slashes him.

Stopping her, Shunsui states that the Ryoka might be the killer, but they don't know for sure, so they should instead interrogate him. He then asks her to send for people from the 4th Division to heal Chad.

        Later, right before Rukia’s execution, a harried Nanao finds Kyōraku on a rooftop, chewing on a blade of grass. Asking him to hurry up, Nanao is irked when Shunsui again tries to joke with her as usual. Then, getting serious, he asks her what he should do. She then replies that no matter what, he will still do what he wants. All she can do is to keep right behind him and stay out of trouble. Shunsui gives a sigh and says, "Then it will again be me that will get into trouble with Yama-jii (Yamamoto)."

        Yamamoto gravely states that what they have done is beyond mere punishment and that they are not ignorant of what that means. Shunsui, realizing what's about to happen, grabs Ukitake and runs away first, with Nanao in close pursuit. Ukitake then asks Shunsui to release him as he wanted to save his subordinates. Shunsui asks him not to worry, as on the one hand, they had to take the fight elsewhere, or else Yamamoto's power would most likely cause more casualties, and on the other hand,
        someone else
        was coming to help.

        When Shunsui explains why, Starrk further notes that Shunsui is obviously ambidextrous and that he is stronger with his left hand than his right, therefore Starrk does not quite believe his excuse for his supposed lack of using his short sword. Shunsui is somewhat impressed at Starrk's observations and comments on how he thought he had corrected his strength difference. Shunsui then proceeds to attack Starrk which the latter then dodges. Afterwards, Shunsui then surprises Starrk by switching hands in mid attack and correcting his swing, making his right hand strength match his left. After Starrk comments on the change, Shunsui asks him whether he will take the fight seriously if he were to unsheathe his short sword, to which Starrk comments that Shunsui is already strong enough and he would not want him using his short sword.

Shunsui then replies that while he is uncertain of it, in a hundred years or so, it is possible that Hitsugaya might become more powerful than himself. Starrk then deduces that, currently, Shunsui is the strongest; realizing what Starrk is going to do, Shunsui throws his pink kimono to Ukitake. When Ukitake wonders what Kyōraku is doing, Shunsui replies by saying that he believes Starrk finally wants to fight for real, something Starrk confirms by saying that he wants to see Shunsui's Bankai.
        He then sheaths his Zanpakutō and calls Lilynette over. He explains that he and
        Lilynette
        are in fact one. While other Hollows split their power into their sword and body, they split into two bodies instead. He also reveals that once they are one again, their full power would be released. With that, Starrk releases his Resurrección form while Shunsui releases his Zanpakutō's Shikai.

        Shunsui proceeds to attack Starrk while he is talking, to which Starrk moves back with ease. Starrk begins to comment on how Shunsui would attack while he is talking, but before Starrk can finish talking, Shunsui uses his

        technique. Starrk parries the attack and fires a large Cero from one of his guns. Starrk then tells Shunsui he seems a little panicked and that is not at all like him. Shunsui responds that he meant to kill him with the first blow, but his release must be really something if he could parry it. He then deduces that Starrk's gun fires Ceros. Starrk confirms, but completely denies it can do anything else when Shunsui asks whether it's capable of more. Shunsui accuses Starrk of being a bad liar, to which Starrk says the same of Shunsui. Starrk then tells him he made him release his "pain in the ass

        at Shunsui, to which he flash steps away. Starrk fires again and tells him that he can't escape. Shunsui dodges, exclaiming how that attack is unfair. Ukitake jumps in front of Shunsui after unleashing his Shikai and negates the multiple Ceros with a blast of his own.

       <p key="f28cfd25-9eac-4f6f-9616-10c66c2da13e">
        Shunsui begins to speak, but Ukitake cuts him off explaining that he shouldn't complain because the Arrancar are double teaming him and his coming to his aid is only fair. Ukitake then comments that besides that, Shunsui doesn't seem to want to use his Bankai. Shunsui assures him that he will eventually. But Ukitake says that he shouldn't use it out in the open where anyone could see it.
        Ukitake continues by saying that, in any case, his powers are better suited for this sort of fight. Starrk interrupts by asking Ukitake how he fired a Cero. Ukitake plainly says that he may figure it out if he does it again. Determined to figure out Ukitake's power, Starrk fires again, despite Lilynette's protests that it's most likely a trap. They engage in a few mutual attacks, then Starrk uses

        to get closer to Ukitake and explains what he has learned of his ability. Ukitake is surprised that he figured it out after only three attacks. Starrk then expresses that he is glad that Ukitake's power isn't to reflect any and all attacks back at his opponent. Starrk surmises that if Ukitake has to absorb the attack first, then there has to be a limit to what can be absorbed. He then tells Ukitake that he doesn't think he'll be able to absorb the attack if he fires 1,000 shots at once.

        Before Starrk can fire, Shunsui appears behind him and tries to cut off his head, but Starrk dodges and fires a large Cero which Shunsui also dodges. Starrk comments on how such actions aren't like him, to which Shunsui responds that he shouldn't make judgments as he is the one not acting like himself. Starrk's simple reply is that he thought they both were alike. Then seemingly out of nowhere, a

        begins to open, surprising the three combatants. Ukitake asks Shunsui if it's someone new. Shunsui asks in response if Ukitake thinks there is someone who could back up the top three Espada, because he hopes it isn't. When the Garganta is fully open,
        Wonderweiss Margela
        walks through. Ukitake and Shunsui both question who he is, while Starrk says his name, just as surprised to see him here being accompanied by

        While Ukitake's attention is on Hooleer, Wonderweiss attacks him from behind, impaling him in the back and out through his chest with his hand. Seeing this, Shunsui goes to attack the Arrancar, but is quickly shot at point blank range by a Cero to the back by Starrk, with both captains falling down to the buildings below.
        However, Kyōraku appears to be largely uninjured as pointed out by Lisa Yadōmaru, who stomps on his head and demands to know how long he was planning on playing dead.
        . Kyōraku then proceeds to compliment Lisa and says he is glad that she is all right.

        Just as Starrk is about to finish off Love and Rose, Kyōraku stabs him from the shadows. Kyōraku was actually hiding in the shadows thanks to the ability of his Zanpakutō.
        He then proceeds to explain the abilities of his Zanpakutō, denying Starrk's charge that he was hiding his powers; stating that his Zanpakutō was not in the mood for that game before and that though he loves his sword, it is very selfish and he doesn't like playing with it because it jerks him around.
        He then proceeds to fight Starrk using a new color-based game that ends with Kyōraku fatally wounding Starrk, targeting his black Hollow hole after calling the color

        As the dying Starrk falls, Love appears behind Shunsui and thanks him. Shunsui responds by saying that he is just glad they are safe. Love then tells him that he never changes; always butting into other people's battles and that he has no style. Shunsui returns his Zanpakutō to its sealed state and tells Love that "only underlings get caught up in matters of style" and that a captain can't afford such indulgences. He then goes on to state that "If you owe someone or they owe you, the moment you start to fight you're in the wrong either way".

        Shunsui later joins the remaining unoccupied Shinigami and Visored in planning to protect Ichigo Kurosaki from Aizen and his Shikai.
        As Hitsugaya attacks Aizen, Kyōraku attacks his flank with his Shikai, but hits a barrier, which cracks slightly. When Aizen tells Hitsugaya that it is good that he is not attacking alone, Shunsui accuses him of calling Tōshirō a coward.
        Shunsui later attacks Aizen as he is conversing with Hitsugaya, but Sōsuke evades the attack and complains that he interrupted their discussion. Kyōraku responds that he is not very good at hearing when a man is talking, as just listening is boring. When Hitsugaya activates his Bankai and states that he intends to violently cut and crush Aizen, Shunsui tells him not to be hasty.

        Aizen then critically injures and dispatches Love, Komamura, Rose, and Lisa. Shunsui is then confronted by Suì-Fēng, who creates clones of herself and charges. When Aizen tries to attack, he finds his arm encased in ice. Suì-Fēng is able to hit Aizen with

        As they fall into the town below, Aizen states that he will not kill them and that they are to watch the outcome of this battle.

        Ten days later, after Aizen is captured and Shunsui is fully healed, he is called with Byakuya and Kenpachi to discuss the loss of their captain's haoris with Yamamoto. While the Captain-Commander is furious at the loss, the captains are indifferent to the matter. Shunsui's only complaint on the matter was thinking of the haori as being nothing more than stylish, which makes Yamamoto all the angrier.

Komamura questions the strange man on what he has done with Yamamoto, but receives no reply back. As Komamura moves to attack, his Bankai turns on him, much to everyone's surprise. Shunsui notes that such a thing is impossible. Upon a release of Reiatsu, a large being appears before Komamura and fights with him, easily dispatching him as all in attendance look on in complete shock.

     The mysterious man talks briefly with Ukitake before Shunsui interrupts, stating the he is taking this whole thing seriously, but is more concerned on Captain-Commander Yamamoto's whereabouts. The mysterious man exclaims that Yamamoto has been sealed away as his Zanpakutō Ryūjin Jakka was unwilling to join forces with them. He then states that he had

     Fourth Division

Ukitake is happy that they have found a way to finally get their Zanpakutō back, but Shunsui notes that it is going to take a while for everyone to track down their own Zanpakutō and beat them in battle, since their opponents are not going to simply wait for them.

     Kyōraku decides to join Ukitake, Kenpachi, Yachiru, Ichigo, and Yoruichi on a mission to find and rescue Yamamoto. The party finds the cave by tracing Yamamoto's Reiatsu. The party splits up; Shunsui accompanies Ukitake to a distant corner of the cave, where they encounter the spirits of their Zanpakutō. Shunsui tries to use his charm to persuade Katen Kyōkotsu to come back to him, though she is not easily swayed, stating they both are tired of having to deal with such a decadent man. Shunsui notes that she has said "we", realizing that the Reiatsu that he felt since the start of the rebellion was that of her counterpart.

During the battle, Shunsui deduces from his Zanpakutō spirits' battle tactics that they are in a defensive stance that makes it impossible for him to go all out on them. He then realizes that this is merely a ploy that allows them to stall for time. After realizing that Muramasa wishes to use Ichigo's power for something, Shunsui manages to get past the spirits and attempts to stop Ichigo from being used. Upon sensing a huge explosion originating from Ichigo's power, Ukitake rushes to the location to find Yamamoto freed, but greatly troubled. It is then revealed that Yamamoto was not imprisoned as Muramasa claimed, but rather Yamamoto produced the barrier to protect himself from Muramasa's plans to use Ryūjin Jakka. When Muramasa says that he has no need for the other Zanpakutō Spirits any more, Katen Kyōkotsu and Sōgyo no Kotowari attack him, but end up having their physical forms destroyed by Ryūjin Jakka. Muramasa makes his escape, while Yamamoto reveals to the others that Muramasa intends to destroy the Gotei 13 with it.

     are playing a card game. Kyōraku wonders how many Tōjū are present in Seireitei, as Ukitake speculates that there should be numbers equating the casualties lost in battle. Ukitake states that they incorrectly assumed that their Zanpakutō would return back to their swords, as
     Sōgyo no Kotowari
     and
     Katen Kyōkotsu
     play next to them. Ukitake says that they cannot ignore the Tōjū as a serious threat, as Katen Kyōkotsu claims victory in the game.

Hitsugaya tells him that he finished the report upon Karakura Town's return to the Human World. Kyōraku explains that Nanao told him it would be finished on the day, much to Hitsugaya's surprise.

Kyōraku later attends a meeting in Yamamoto's office, listening to Mayuri's explanation that the S.R.D.I. monitors the Dangai 24 hours a day. Hitsugaya implies that he must have missed something, angering Mayuri, which prompts Kyōraku to intervene, saying nothing is known as of yet. Nanao and Rangiku are then brought before them. Despite being unaccounted for since the previous evening, the pair claim that only three hours have passed since they were ordered to return to Soul Society. Kyōraku then attends an emergency captains meeting, where Mayuri explains the presence of a time gap between the Soul Society and the Human World, which is gradually expanding.

     Despite this assistance, the Reigai still pressure the Shinigami. Byakuya Kuchiki then realizes the truth behind the Reigai's battle style: they value self-preservation the most and won't attack first in fear of being outnumbered. Pleased at some good news, Shunsui suggests a battle of wills.

        However, Shunsui retorts that such logic won't work with Yamamoto, just as an enormous explosion occurs in the distance, much to the Sternritter's surprise.

Calming them down, he reminds everyone present that the Gotei 13 was not created to mourn those lost, but to protect Soul Society.
        Shunsui and the other captains later gather outside Seireitei. When Ichigo Kurosaki asks where the Royal Guard usually is, Shunsui explains that they typically stay in the palace of the Soul King.

        The Central 46 are outraged as they fear Zaraki's power becoming far too great, pointing out the devastation that could be unleashed on Soul Society if he revolted. They also remind Kyōraku that even Yamamoto tried to teach him and stopped after one day, fearing his potential. Undeterred, Kyōraku then asks them what other options they have as Soul Society in its current state won't survive another invasion, and asks them if they are capable of protecting themselves. Kyōraku takes the Central 46's silence as a confirmation to proceed with his intended action. He then calls forth Captain

        When Keigo asks if he is trying to scare them again, Shunsui states he is not here to make jokes, and confirms Keigo's worries about Soul Society getting Ichigo involved in their affairs once again. Upon being asked by Mizuiro as to why they will have to part with him, Shunsui states that Ichigo is in a special place within Soul Society, and though he is sure he will come back safely from there, he is worried about the kind of power he will come back with, as it might affect the Human World. Angered by this, Keigo grabs Shunsui by the front of his robes, expressing outrage at them keeping Ichigo in Soul Society after he went there to save it. Shunsui states they will do it if it is necessary, however he also comments that the odds of it happening are 1 in 10,000 or less, saying it being a remote chance would be more accurate.

        When Tatsuki asks why he came here if it is such a low chance, he states he did so because even if it is a low chance, not saying anything to Ichigo's friends would be unfair to him. Giving Ichigo's friends several Soul Tickets, Shunsui tells them that in the event of Ichigo remaining in Soul Society, they could use them to travel to Soul Society and see their friend. Assuring Tatsuki that he had already sent them to Ichigo's family as well, Shunsui promises that when Ichigo returns, he will tell him to go home right away and get some rest before the battle.

As Shunsui moves in front of Nanao, the wall behind them is destroyed as Shunsui admits he had almost forgotten how Quincy can steal Reishi.

        Asking Aizen if he is unwilling to converse with his Reiatsu, Shunsui reveals that he possesses a set of keys to Aizen's seals and states that he has been permitted to use three of them before deciding to unseal Aizen's mouth first.

Aizen states he never asked Shunsui to free him and asks him why he brought the keys with him, prompting Shunsui to reveal he has the key to Muken stored within his heart and that he could only unlock three parts of Aizen's body. Aizen realizes he will be trapped here forever if he kills Shunsui for the other keys as Shunsui asks him to get in the chair behind him so they can go to the surface. When an attendant attempts to bind Aizen, Shunsui attempts to warn him and watches as the attendant's hands are partially destroyed by Aizen's Reiatsu. Shunsui tells Aizen that he is only freeing him because they are in the same predicament.

With the other Shinigami silent, Shunsui is asked by Aizen to take off the rest of the seals. Shunsui, saying he doesn't have permission to do that, notes Aizen can use his Reiatsu.

Shunsui notes that this is how he can keep fighting even after it is broken before appearing behind him and slashing, prompting Lille to duck as Shunsui states that losing sight of him means Lille could be tricked by an illusion.

After stating that this is merely the prologue, Shunsui shifts to the second level of his Bankai, which causes black spots to appear all over Lille's body, and relates a story of a man wounded in battle whose grief turned into illness before using the third level of his Bankai, which engulfs both him and Lille in water, as he reveals that they will both remain there until one of them has their Reiatsu run out.

Shunsui states that he will cut this thread for Lille and notes that this is the last act before cutting Lille's throat. As he coughs up blood, Shunsui falls back into Katen's lap and notes with perversion that he should enter his Bankai more often if it means doing this, only to be forced to dodge a jab at his eye from Katen, who states that they both look and act very similar before noting that they have won.

Kyōraku usually swings with more strength in his left hand than his right, however, he can easily switch or balance the strength between his two hands, allowing him to surprise his opponent. Kyōraku states that he only uses his wakizashi in situations where his katana is too difficult to use. He claims that he does not use them together on a regular basis. The best example of Shunsui's prowess is his ability to fight on even grounds with an unreleased Starrk, the 1st Espada, with only his sealed Zanpakutō, while other captain-level Shinigami have required at least their Shikai to fight against an Espada.
   Shunsui's fighting style involves evasion and attacking an opponent either in the front or back, using the element of surprise to overwhelm them.
   His two swords move at a different pace, something he takes advantage of while fighting. While the enemy is at the mercy of his wakizashi's speed, his tachi swoops in for the final blow, which is the most common use of swords like his.

   : Despite his laid-back attitude, Shunsui has repeatedly shown himself to be a perceptive and insightful man. According to Yamamoto, even when he was younger, Shunsui has always had an eye for seeing the true character of anyone he meets.
   Shunsui easily saw through Kurotsuchi's attempt to hide being used by the Bounts. He was also one of the few people to suspect that Aizen was hiding something.
   In battle, Shunsui has proven to be very adept at noticing and understanding details in an opponent's skills or attack patterns. During his battle against Chad, he quickly determined the basics behind Chad's Reiryoku blasts, warning him about those kinds of techniques, and even explaining that his energy blasts would eventually use up his life energy.
   Shunsui has also proven himself very persuasive. Shortly after becoming Captain-Commander, he was able to convince Central 46 to agree to all his new requests.

   He is not overwhelmed by the Reiatsu of Captain-Commander Yamamoto, though most people would be in such a situation.

He usually keeps them sheathed through his waist tie at his left side; however, during battle, the swords have been placed on both sides of his sash. Like other Zanpakutō, Katen Kyōkotsu has a personality of her own. However, unlike other Zanpakutō, this personality shines through in battle and prevents Shunsui from fighting at full power until Katen Kyōkotsu is in the mood for it. Because of this, Shunsui does not like to "play" with "her".

Thusly, they still exist as a daisho sword pair, with the wakizashi being slightly smaller in size than the tachi.
