   Love is a tall Visored with brown eyes and a thick black spiked afro which adds further to his above average height. Love sports a green jogging suit and wears mirrored sunglasses at all times. When he was a captain, 110 years ago, his hair was in a classic, rounded afro style with long sideburns. He wore a standard Shinigami uniform with a sleeveless captain's haori and a pair of dark-lensed sunglasses.

   or some of Lisa's erotic manga in his spare time, more often than not, spoiling a piece of the story by quoting lines and explaining what the character meant by it in a dramatic, tough-guy demeanor, almost as if he was an actor rehearsing movie lines. As with most Visored, Love's attitude switches from serious to carefree within a moment's notice. During his time as a captain, Love believed in respect and maintaining the peace, quick to uphold those standards when no one else will.

   . True to his more carefree side, right before starting his battle against Starrk, Love makes a manga reference in response to Starrk questioning what happened when Loves' mask dissipated.
   Despite his comparatively friendly attitude, Love is a rather brutal and merciless fighter, not letting his opponents make a move against him and using his Shikai's special ability mixed with his mask right at the start of his battle with Starrk.

        Approximately 110 years ago, Love was the captain of the 7th Division of the
        Gotei 13
        . He was first seen knocking
        Hiyori Sarugaki
        on her head for attacking

Hiyori yelled at him and asked him who he thought he was, smacking law abiding lieutenants who didn't fall under his jurisdiction. Love calmly replied that seeing as her captain was not there, someone had to keep her under control otherwise she would just run amuck.

       <p key="d7c1632f-8dfd-4aeb-99a5-61655c889a80">
        After the incident Shinji asked Love who had shown up for the meeting the captains had been called to, to which Love replied that almost everyone was already there. Shinji stated that he saw no one from the 11th Division show up. Love explained that was his way, as he did what he wanted. Shinji said just because he was the 10th 'Kenpachi' no one had the guts to keep him in check. He went on to say that he couldn't understand why they let such a loose cannon like him become captain. Love tried to ease him explaining that there was no use getting upset over it, as the chosen 'Kenpachi' had always held the position of the 11th Division captain, as it was a sort of legacy and it wouldn't change anytime soon. Love went on to say that if Shinji wanted to complain about anything then he should complain about the fact that the previous Kenpachi's ineptitude made it possible.

Shunsui stated that he had no idea what Love was talking about as he was always on time. Love then bore witness to the conversation between Shunsui and Ukitake about who had been captain the longest and what had happened to the previous 12th Division captain,

        Love was the second to show up at the site of the disappearances after Shinji, immediately asking if Hiyori was alright, he then noticed a Hollowfied Kensei and was greatly surprised at his current state. He immediately asked what was going on, to which Rose denoted that while the Reiatsu was clearly similar to Kensei's he had a Hollow mask and he wondered if he was a Hollow. Shinji stated that he didn't know if it was Kensei, but that if they didn't draw their swords they were as good as dead. Love went to attack the Hollowfied Kensei, but was caught off guard by his speed as he easily appeared behind him.

        Kensei hit him with a powerful punch that produced a lot of smoke in its wake, which attracted the attention of Rose and Lisa. Though Kensei went for a second attack, Love blocked it with his sword. As the smoke cleared Love had managed to withstand the attack despite a significant part of his garment being destroyed and him suffering some burns. Love calmly admitted that he was strong therefore it was obviously Kensei.
        After Kensei and

        Unfortunately, it ended up as a failed process, not having the desired effect Urahara expected.

Hachi states he is not sure, but from the impression he got from examining her Reiatsu up close it felt that she has barrier abilities similar to his own. He deduces that's how she came about being able to find the warehouse and slipping inside, but he finds that her being a Human with those abilities is a little hard to believe.

Love then dons his mask; he then uses his Shikai special ability only for Starrk to escape the attack. Love is confused as to where the Espada got to and Rose points out that he's up above him. Love looks up to see Starrk with a large pack of wolves.
        After Starrk orders his wolf pack to attack, Love tries to beat them away with his club, while also using his mask.
        Upon seeing Rose's whip go through the wolves he comments that the wolves are like flames.
        When one of the wolves explodes near him, he deduces that the wolves are in fact Cero-based and tells Rose not to let them explode in close combat.
        However, just as he says this a wolf appears behind him and explodes.

        As he and Rose are trying to recover their breath Starrk informs him that the wolves are fragments of his and Lilynette's soul and that just Cero could not have severely injured people as strong as them. Love then rejects Starrk's offer of retreat.
        . He stares in shock as Starrk is attacked from behind
        and as Kyōraku rises from the shadows to reveal that it was he who attacked Starrk.

        The battle ends with Starrk's death, and Kyōraku is approached by Love and Rose. Love sarcastically thanks him and states that Kyōraku has not changed and accuses him of having no style, such as by interfering in other people's battles. Kyōraku tells Love that only underlings get caught up in matters of style and lose the battle, and that captains do not have such indulgences.
        Love is then seen reacting to the Aizen's taunts, but was told by Shinji not to be provoked.

        Love is among the several unoccupied captains and Visored who try to protect the newly arrived Ichigo Kurosaki from Aizen and his Shikai.
        After Shinji explains that protecting Ichigo is important and that the battle is all of theirs, Love charges at Aizen with Shinji, Rose, and Lisa.
        He is then seen along with Komamura and Rose as they attempt to attack Aizen at once, but their attacks fail to hit their mark.

        Love falls from the sky after the attack. He survives the battle and is later seen with his injuries patched up, being informed of Hiyori's status and is also surprised that Unohana would refer to the Visored as allies although they had never referred to themselves as such.
