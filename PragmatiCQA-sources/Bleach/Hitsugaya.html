   Hitsugaya is generally mature and serious, in contrast to his free-spirited lieutenant, Rangiku Matsumoto. Despite their personality differences, he and Rangiku seem very close. Tōshirō is easily annoyed by others goofing off or drawing unneeded attention to themselves, such as when he leads a team of Shinigami into

   's school.
   Hitsugaya hates anything that he deems childish as well as being described as something close to a child, such as an elementary school child. He is overly protective of Momo Hinamori, due to the fact that they were old childhood friends. Hitsugaya dislikes summer and warm weather in general.

   . During his childhood in West Rukongai, he was so skilled with spinning tops that he became the local undefeated champion. He works very hard, but his motive seems to be that if he finishes quickly, he can return to his afternoon nap. He believes in the saying "children who sleep well, grow well," and hopes to grow quickly, a wish shared by his subordinates. Naturally, they do not voice this fact in front of him, for even regularly practicing this adage for so long, he did not really grow in height.

   Hitsugaya is usually joked about by many of the other Shinigami in Soul Society as well as by his enemies, he tolerates these jokes and goes on with his duties. Hitsugaya has developed a cold attitude toward most people. Although he becomes angry towards jokes, he doesn't take action against whomever insulted him unless they are his enemies. The only thing he cannot tolerate is not being addressed as "Captain Hitsugaya," or an inappropriate use of his name, as he worked very hard for the title. He does not address any other officer with their title, only their last names. The only person that actually calls him by his given name is Ichigo, who he constantly reminded to address him properly, and Hinamori, who is the only person allowed to get away with not addressing him properly. Hinamori tends to call him "Hitsugaya-kun" and both she and Ukitake occasionally use "Shirō-chan" (シロちゃん) — a nickname meaning "Whitey" (Snowy in the English manga) in reference to his hair — in both cases without any repercussion. In addition, Karin and her friends call him by his first name and they are never given any rebukes for it. to his chagrin he often receives candy and other foods from

        Hitsugaya comes from the province of Junrinan in the 1st District of West

        . As a young child, Hitsugaya was a bit of a brat who liked to eat watermelons and poke fun at Hinamori. She called him "Shiro-chan" and he retorted by calling her "Bed-wetter Momo." The two were close friends and Hitsugaya, despite being younger and much shorter than his friend, always felt that he needs to protect her.

       <p key="92a8b9f9-a81a-4ee4-9dcf-eae39fd8c7d8">
        Even at a young, untrained age, Hitsugaya could hear the calling of his Zanpakutō spirit, Hyōrinmaru. Despite this, he never told anyone and couldn't accurately determine what was happening other than to assume it was an ever recurring dream.

        When Hinamori left to become a

        , he portrayed himself as happy to see her go, though it was more of an act than his true feelings. Her next door friends were scared of him, even though he had never done anything to them. His grandmother, "Granny," and Hinamori were the only ones in the district that weren't afraid of him. His personality was supposedly "cold as ice" or at least thought to be, and he often wondered if it was due to his appearance or attitude.
        When Momo had been in the

        for 5 years, he began to notice how he hadn't grown an inch. He noticed that Hinamori's hair grew longer and she visited less often, seemingly having a goal in her life now. He also noticed that "Granny" was getting skinnier.

        , who yells at the shop keeper for being rude to Hitsugaya and reproached him for his poor customer skills. When Hitsugaya turns around, he is knocked down by bumping into Rangiku's bosom. She then yells at him for "lying there and crying about it and not standing up like a man," although it was she who had knocked him down in the first place. He then shakes her off and runs away.
        Later that night, he has a vivid dream of a gigantic, icy blue, serpentine dragon with large wings and an echoing voice. This dream is markedly different from the previous ones, where he had only experienced sensations, but nothing substantial to what the meaning might be. This time, however, the reason behind the dreams not only materializes, but tries to tell him its name. Hitsugaya cannot hear him, however, as his voice is muffled by strong winds. He then wakes up in a cold sweat.

       <p key="1eca155c-646b-44e8-b27b-be7e88710a44">

        everywhere and to get some sleep. She further explains that his grandmother looks pretty cold, which causes Hitsugaya to notice for the first time that the room is exceedingly cold and affecting his grandmother. Rangiku then tells him he should become a Shinigami, stating that kids with power as strong as his need to learn how to bring their power under control. She explains that if he stays the way he is, his power will end up killing his grandmother. At first, Hitsugaya isn't sure what she is talking about, but she calmly places her hand on his chest and asks him if he hears a voice calling out to him. She explains to him that once he has found that voice, he'll understand how to control his power. She then notes that for that to happen he must become a Shinigami.

       <p key="84722a30-2025-4551-9cb2-d388afbe01db">
        Soon after, he tells his grandmother of his intentions of becoming a Shinigami. Much to Hitsugaya's surprise, she is happy for him. She tells him that she had always felt that he holds everything in because he didn't want to leave her, but doing so was only hurting him and in turn, seeing him that way, hurt her. Hitsugaya then leaves to follow his own path with his grandmother's blessing.

        With Hitsugaya's natural talent, he quickly entered the Shinigami Academy and graduated early despite his age. Hinamori continued to call him "Shirō-chan" out of habit and felt she needed to protect him. Because of a promise she had made, she only began to call him "Hitsugaya-kun" after he had achieved his Zanpakutō's
        Shikai
        and was recognized as a Shinigami.

        Naruki City
        died two months ago. Isshin was aware of the situation, having knowledge that the
        Gotei 13
        was investigating the incident. Hitsugaya then informed him that two more individuals died in the past month, while investigating the cause. Concerned, Isshin decided to investigate the cause himself. Rangiku tried to go to assist him, but Hitsugaya stopped her, informing her that they were not strong enough to assist him.
        Afterwards he was also present to witness Rangiku's rage towards their captain for returning to the Living World, seemingly on a whim.

Hitsugaya surmises they had been dead for at least 2 days, but he is concerned about the exact time, as Soul Society had been under martial law and their Headquarters had been locked down since Renji's defeat. Further, the 13 seals of protection was still active and there was no signs of intrusion. Hitsugaya then realizes that the only possible scenario is that they were killed before they were sealed in and that all the recent orders that had been given were fake. He then realizes that such a plot would be far too elaborate for Gin to carry out by himself. He then is interrupted by Kira and he and Matsumoto give chase. When he asks Kira if he was behind the Central 46's death, Kira tells him no and that he arrived just after he did. He also informs Hitsugaya that instead of chasing him, he should be protecting Hinamori. He then goes on to explain that she escaped the 10th Division Barracks, explaining that Hinamori excels at Kidō and that breaking his barrier from the inside would be easy for her. Realizing that Hinamori has been following him and Matsumoto the entire time, he turns back and orders Matsumoto to handle Kira.

Extremely confused at this point, he is surprised to find Gin and Aizen together and referring to the forces of Soul Society as the enemy. Hitsugaya discovers Hinamori injured and asks Aizen when he and Gin became comrades, to which Aizen explains that they have always been comrades. Ever since he had been a captain, the only one he ever thought of as his subordinate was Gin. Hitsugaya then states that he has been deceiving everyone from the start. Aizen then explains his reasoning behind the deception, detailing that he was being compassionate and states that he would teach Hitsugaya that

        Tōshirō's Shikai freezes the Espada, but only for a moment. Yammy comments that the cold attack felt "refreshing." At this point, Tōshirō realizes even his Shikai at 100 percent is not enough to injure the Espada.
        Their fight is cut short by the new 6th Espada,
        Luppi Antenor

        Though initially unable to defend against Luppi's attacks, as he was knocked to the ground in a single hit from the Espada, Hitsugaya comes back with his Bankai renewed and explains its ability. Luppi's inattentiveness gives him ample time to build up a finishing move, using his Sennen Hyōrō technique - just in time to save his subordinates. Luppi escapes death due to Negación, having only been incapacitated by the ice, and promises to kill Hitsugaya in turn.

Hitsugaya and his division are given the task of watching over the gate to the Kasumiōji Manor. Though Ichigo is hiding, Hitsugaya can still sense his spiritual power and tells him to come out. Though Rukia pleads with him to let them explain, Hitsugaya assures her he will, but only after he has taken them to the Captain-Commander. No sooner than that conversation happens, Captain Amagai comes out and Hitsugaya is surprised to see him on Ichigo's side. Amagai takes out his Zanpakutō and attacks Hitsugaya, who blocks and asks him to pull back, but Amagai refuses. Hitsugaya tells him because he is a captain, he cannot hold back on him and releases his Shikai and attacks, but Amagai releases his Shikai as well and counters causing a stalemate.

        Tier Harribel
        and her Fracción. While being surrounded, Matsumoto offers her captain to take on all three Fracción, so that Hitsugaya can fight Harribel alone and undisturbed.
        After Hinamori arrived, Hitsugaya has a flashback of when she asked him to help Aizen, while Harribel asked why his Reiatsu became disordered. He answered her, saying that he doesn't know, though he was wondering why Hinamori was here.

        Hitsugaya's match against Harribel seemed to have taken a new turn when the latter sensed her Fraccións' defeat. Harribel forces Hitsugaya back with sheer power from her blade swing and unzips her jacket, revealing her rank as the 3rd Espada which is tattooed on her right breast. Hitsugaya is shocked to find out that Harribel is only 3rd despite her strength. When Harribel taunts Hitsugaya that she has yet to fully demonstrate her strength, Hitsugaya quickly uses Bankai in an attempt to match her very sudden and large increase in power. Harribel rushes him and begins her attack as they come together and lock blades.
        Harribel knocks Tōshirō to the ground as she mocks him, questioning "whether this is the full strength of a captain". She then promises to end the battle and proceeds to release her Zanpakutō. After releasing, Tōshirō comments to himself that her appearance hasn't changed as much as he predicted, but underestimating her would be a fatal mistake. Harribel proves to be in a different league then the young captain slicing the right side of his body from his shoulder before he even realizes it.

        Believing that Hitsugaya has been defeated, Harribel turns her attention to Captain-Commander Yamamoto, though before she can take any action toward him, she is attacked by an unseen assailant. Harribel dodges out of the way only to see that it is an unharmed Hitsugaya, she just as quickly countered his attacks. Noticeably confused as she had seen him cut down, she turns and sees that she has only struck down an ice clone. Hitsugaya claims that it was a one time technique that he was waiting to use for later in the battle, but Harribel's considerable increase in power and speed as of her release was unexpected. He then comments to her not to underestimate a captain's strength.
        As their fight ensues, he tells her that he can use any water around him, telling Harribel that she will never reach him. Hitsugaya then attacks Harribel. She reciprocates the situation by melting his ice and stating the iron law of battle. She finally attacks him with his melted ice.

        Their exchange of attacks continues and Hitsugaya tells her another law of battle. To which Harribel releases a Cero blast at him, which Hitsugaya comments on it being weak. He concludes that the reason her Cero was so weak, as both of them are waiting for the battlefield to become filled with condensation, from this he states that when that happens Harribel will use the opportunity to finish him off with one blow. Hitsugaya grows tired of waiting and states that he has never tried a particular ability in Bankai mode before, to which Harribel asks what he is talking about. Hitsugaya then explains that he doesn't have to wait for water, as Hyōrinmaru is the most powerful ice-based Zanpakutō, and all water is his weapon and all heaven is under his command.

        He then reveals his never before seen power: Hyōten Hyakkasō. Hitsugaya then asks her name, to which she replies; Tier Harribel. Hitsugaya then tells her his name and rank before attacking again. As the sky darkens, snow begins to fall from the sky. Harribel attempts to melt the snow with her Hirviendo ability, but the moment her sword touches the snow, ice flowers begin to bloom on her body. Hitsugaya then calmly states that once one hundred flowers have bloomed, her life would have ended. He then states that she won't be able to avenge her underlings after all.

        Seeing the huge creature emerge from the Garganta with Wonderweiss, Hitsugaya looks on at the events taking place. Wonderweiss lets out a huge wail that cracks the ice pillar Harribel is trapped in. Hitsugaya looks surprised as the ice pillar begins to fall apart from around her, and once free, she gazes at him.
        Hitsugaya is alerted to Aizen's presence when the giant Hollow creature blows out the fire prison that he, Gin, and Tōsen were trapped in.
        When the
        Visored
        arrive, Hitsugaya is bewildered as to who they are.
        Hitsugaya is later shocked at the large amount of Gillian-class Menos pouring forth from the giant Hollow creature's mouth.
        After the Visored reveal their mask and easily defeat the numerous Gillians, Hitsugaya comments on how powerful they are.
        While he was contemplating Komamura's declaration that he intends to fight alongside the Visored, Harribel attempts to attack him while his back is turned. Sensing this, Hitsugaya's hand goes to his Zanpakutō. However, the Visored
        Lisa Yadōmaru
        and
        Hiyori Sarugaki
        intervene and deflect the blow before Hitsugaya has a chance to unsheathe his sword. Following this, he comments on how there doesn't seem to be time to worry about whether the Visored are friends or foes, essentially agreeing to fight alongside them.

        Espada
        as he wants to go and fight Aizen. Hiyori yells as him, asking him if he is crazy as the

        have come here to kill Aizen as well and that Hitsugaya was already having trouble when they arrived, so what makes him think he can take Aizen. Hitsugaya realizes that he was acting irrationally and that he panicked. Hiyori yells at him some more until he apologizes, and she then berates him further and questions his status as a captain. When she calls him "shorty," Hitsugaya grabs Hiyori and screams at her, telling her she is shorter than him. They continue to fight until they are distracted by Lisa, who is rushing off to fight

Hitsugaya gathers with the unoccupied captains and Visored planning to protect

        Tōshirō is the first to attack Aizen, claiming that if nobody attacked, then the battle would not start. He dismisses Aizen's taunt about him being reckless, saying that causing opponents to miss their opportunities to attack is one of Aizen's specialties. Hitsugaya compliments Aizen for not using his Shikai to evade the initial attack. As Captain Kyōraku attacks Aizen's flank, Sōsuke compliments Tōshirō for being wise enough not to attack him alone.

        Hitsugaya asks him about what he previously stated about swords devoid of hatred being like eagles without wings, and tells him that placing responsibility alone in their blades is what it means to be a captain. Captains do not swing their swords out of hatred, and tells Aizen that he does not have what it takes to be a captain. Aizen retorts that it is amusing to hear such words from him, as due to what happened to Hinamori, he bears more hatred than any of the captains. As Shunsui attacks Aizen again, Hitsugaya activates his Bankai and admits that his blade is filled with anger. He tells Aizen that he came to Karakura Town to kill him.
        After his admittance of his hate-filled blade, Hitsugaya declares his motive: "I don't care if I lose my position as a captain, as long as I can kill you". He warns Aizen to prepare himself and proceeds to attack him, but to no avail. After his failed attempt, Komamura and Love step in and attack Aizen simultaneously. Komamura apologizes to Hitsugaya for their intervention, but Hitsugaya tells him he had no intention of fighting Aizen one-on-one.

        After Aizen is attacked by Suì-Fēng and Shunsui, Hitsugaya tells Aizen it is over and rushes at him. Aizen notes to himself that Hitsugaya is so young, as he sees his chance and takes it without planning ahead. That is his biggest failing. Just then he notices off to the side that Shinji is standing to the side holding up his

        When Ichigo shouts at the Shinigami, questioning what they are doing, Tōshirō realizes that it was not Aizen that he has just stabbed. Shocked at the sight of Hinamori impaled on his blade, he cradles her for a moment. After he hears her ask "Shiro-chan...Why?" he lets out a yell of rage before he lunges at Aizen. As Shunsui tells him to wait, Aizen takes complete advantage of Hitsugaya's blinding rage, cutting through Hitsugaya's Bankai and injuring him and the surrounding captains.
        Hitsugaya loses his left arm and most of his left leg from the attack and begins falling down into the town below. As this is happening, Aizen tells him and the other defeated Shinigami that he won't kill them and that they will watch the outcome of this battle.

     Hitsugaya then goes back to destroying the remaining Gillians. Afterwards, Muramasa's dome collapses, with Ichigo emerging the victor.

     To recover from the chaos caused by Muramasa, the Gotei 13 is given a day off to relax and party. Much to Hitsugaya's annoyance, his division gets a little out of control, resulting in many of them passing out from too much drinking. Hitsugaya watches over the party, held at the behest of

He turns to leave, advising Rukia that he is leaving it to her to see that the lights are turned out and the party is her responsibility. When he leaves, he is followed by the drunken Rangiku who tells him she wants to drink some more, agitating him further.

     Later, Hitsugaya is ordered to go to the Human World to deal with the Tōjū that have escaped there. After meeting up with Ichigo and explaining the situation, they go off to search for the berserk swords. To his annoyance, Rangiku decides to follow him to help (and exploit the chance to have fun in the Human World). Later, Hitsugaya finds Ichigo fighting a Hollow-like Tōjū. While Ichigo holds off its Cero, Hitsugaya finishes it off by freezing and shattering it. Afterward, Hitsugaya notes the Tōjū was different from before, somehow having merged with a Hollow into a much more dangerous form.

     A month after Aizen's defeat, Hitsugaya meets Kyōraku and Ukitake outside the
     1st Division
     buildings, telling them that he was reporting on the cleansing of the area around Karakura Town following its transportation to Soul Society. Hitsugaya is surprised to hear that Nanao had told Kyōraku that it would be finished that day and complains about Rangiku slacking off, as it was the 10th Division's responsibility. He asks them to report that and leaves. He later contacts Rangiku via her
     Denreishinki
     and criticizes her for not making regular progress reports. When she informs him that they are finished, he orders her to return, further complaining about her behavior. The following evening, Hitsugaya tells
     Akon
     that he has not been able to contact Nanao and Rangiku since they stated that they were returning, requesting to see if there is a record of them passing through the Dangai.
     Inaba
     reveals that there is no record of the pair returning through the Dangai.

     Along with Ukitake and Shunsui, he informs Yamamoto of the situation. When Mayuri suggests that they must be in the Human World, Hitsugaya remarks that it is hard to believe they would stay without contacting them, suggesting that the
     SRDI
     missed something. The meeting is interrupted by the news that Nanao and Rangiku have returned, who insist that only three hours have passed since their disappearance. In a captains meeting later, Hitsugaya listens as Mayuri reveals that there is a time gap between the Human World and Soul Society. Mayuri requests that a detailed study be carried out and Hitsugaya is ordered to assist, along with
     Byakuya Kuchiki

They bring an item that they found near the rendezvous site to Yamamoto. Later, when Ichigo arrives in Soul Society, Hitsugaya and other senior Shinigami arrest him as a material witness.

     Later, Hitsugaya arrives in the Human World with other members of the Gotei 13 to help in the fight against Inaba. He knocks the Reigai of Nanao Ise off of a platform before grabbing the unconscious
     Nozomi Kujō
     and taking off with her.
     After fending off Inaba and forcing him to retreat, Hitsugaya joins other members of the Gotei 13 as they hold a meeting in Ichigo's room.
     Hitsugaya, Byakuya, Kenpachi, and Komamura decide to return to the Soul Society in order to confront Inaba. Hitsugaya confronts Kenpachi about being late before they enter the Senkaimon. While there, Inaba speeds up the restrictive current forcing Komamura to stay behind using his Bankai. The remaining three captains split up and head towards the
     Twelfth Division
     barracks separately.

She looks up at him with a sweet smile using his nick name 'Shiro-chan' she then goes on to explain of how she woke up in the 12th Division to find everyone gone and appears to be very vulnerable and scared. Hitsugaya states that she should keep safe from the battles that are going on around them she reassures him she is okay before stumbling. Hitsugaya manages to catch her before she falls off the roof and Hinamori apologizes before drawing her sword. Hitsugaya swiftly blocks it and notices her bracelet. She asks him if he is going to try and kill her again, bringing back memories of
     the battle against Aizen for Hitsugaya
     . She stabs him in the stomach before chasing after Hitsugaya as he refuses to attack her or protect himself. Soon, another Hinamori appears claiming that it was unforgivable to hurt Shiro-chan. Hitsugaya watches as they fight each other. Confused as to which is the real Hinamori, Hitsugaya steps between the two of them and is stabbed by both of them. He realizes that they are both Reigai and as both raise their sword whilst apologizing, they are attacked and defeated by Yoruichi's Shunkō technique. Hitsugaya thanks her before he takes off.

     An injured Hitsugaya later enters a building and notices Kenpachi arriving behind him. As they comment on the fate of the other captains, Inaba confronts them. Hitsugaya informs him that they have destroyed most of his invading force and demands to know just who he is. As Inaba releases his Shikai, Hitsugaya notices that he cannot sense any Reiatsu from it. Kenpachi charges in, much to Hitsugaya's annoyance. Hitsugaya joins in the fight, telling Kenpachi that he will not allow him to fight Inaba alone. Shortly after the fight starts, Hitsugaya stands back and contemplates the situation. When Kenpachi charges at Inaba, Hitsugaya yells at him that the scientist is waiting for something. Inaba creates a portal to the Dangai between him and Kenpachi. Hitsugaya uses his Shikai to attack from range, but Inaba creates another portal to block the attack. Hitsugaya surmises that he creates portals that should not exist and seals his opponents inside the Dangai, claiming that the power of Inaba's Zanpakutō is to manipulate space.

     When Hitsugaya switches to fighting from a distance, Inaba opens a portal from which Hitsugaya's own ice attacks emerge, knocking him down. Inaba reveals that he can record and recreate any space. He states that he earlier recorded Hitsugaya's attacks. As they fight, Hitsugaya soon figures out how Inaba is using his Zanpakutō and counters it by preventing him from twirling it to the right in a bid to prevent him from recording space. However, Inaba spins his blade to the left to recreate one of Kenpachi's attacks, which injures Hitsugaya. Hitsugaya is spared another attack when Suì-Fēng arrives with other members of the Gotei 13. Despite the arrival of several Reigai, they engage in battle. During the fight,

     As Hitsugaya listens to Mayuri and Inaba's conversation, he witnesses Inaba attacking one of his Reigai allies. From its remains, Inaba picks up a red pill. Hitsugaya asks if it is a

When Inaba releases the full power of the Reigai and more Reigai appear, including those that had already been defeated, Mayuri explains that as long as their core form, the pill, is preserved, their bodies can be replaced. The captains are attacked by the Reigai, with Hitsugaya once again being attacked by the Reigai of Byakuya.

     Later, Hitsugaya along with Yoruichi and the other captain return in time to aid Ichigo and Kisuke from their Reigai pursuers. Hitsugaya quickly confronts his Reigai counterpart. It is quickly made clear that the Reigai has the advantage over the young captain as Hitsugaya is a forced back hard. While Reigai-Hitsugaya surmises that Hitsugaya won't retreat as a matter of pride, he tells the Reigai he won't because it is his duty as a captain of the Gotei 13.
     Despite his strong resolve, Hitsugaya is still pushed back. Eventually, the Shinigami lieutenants return and aid their respective captains with Rangiku aiding Hitsugaya.

     Despite this assistance, the Reigai still pressure the Shinigami. Byakuya Kuchiki then realizes the truth behind the Reigai's battle style: they value self-preservation the most and won't attack first in fear of being outnumbered. Realizing this to be true, Hitsugaya begins mocking them, asking the Reigai if they are willing to strike at anyone first in fear of group counterattack.

Before the Shinigami can, the Reigai step forward, saying that they will stop their fellow Mod Soul's chaotic plan as their goal has always been to protect the Soul Society in their own way. Reigai then destroy the technique at the cost of their own lives.

However, Renji calls out to him then and reveals the presence of himself and other Shinigami, including Hitsugaya, who are observing the situation from the side. Renji explains that everyone of them had given some of their Reiatsu to the sword before Rukia had stabbed Ichigo, thus allowing him to regain more of his powers.

        After Ichigo learns of how Yamamoto ordered that the Gotei 13 captains and lieutenants to help restore his powers, Hitsugaya says that Yamamoto would not have done that in the past, but Ichigo changed that. He says the power Ichigo received is the result of the way he changed Soul Society by fighting and that he should accept these new powers proudly. Hitsugaya then explains there were to two reasons why Yamamoto decided to give Ichigo's powers back; the first was to help Ichigo who had saved the Gotei 13, and the second reason was to stop Kūgo Ginjō. He says that long before Ichigo appeared, Kūgo Ginjō was the first Substitute Shinigami, revealing that he gave up the position and disappeared.
        When Ichigo asks how Kūgo could be the first Substitute Shinigami, Hitsugaya reminds Ichigo of when Ukitake gave him his badge. He says the Substitute Shinigami law was created solely because of Kūgo. Captain Kuchiki interrupts him and Hitsugaya says that he'll leave the details for later and they need to focus on Kūgo.

Yukio says that Hitsugaya is good and if he wants bonus points for that to which he says no thanks. As Yukio separates everyone into chat rooms, Hitsugaya is paired with Yukio himself.
        Hitsugaya quickly finds himself trapped in Yukio's video game realm and is attacked by several digital missiles. While he handles them with ease, he voices how annoyed he is to fight someone so "tiresome".

        He ultimately reaches Yukio, who congratulates him for arriving unscathed. Yukio explains his Fullbring's power to Hitsugaya, bragging how it makes him god of this space. He then creates giant monsters, setting them to relentlessly pursue and attack Hitsugaya. Hitsugaya begins dodging them with relative ease, only for Yukio to mock him saying that as a captain he must have had a loving, elite family. Hitsugaya surmises from Yukio's attitude that he was probably abandoned as child and questions him about it. As Yukio furiously explains how he left his parents and caused his father to kill himself, Hitsugaya sneaks up on Yukio and freezes his legs and controllers. Hitsugaya reminds him that he had set the monsters to attack him relentlessly, as they surround Hitsugaya, who is standing next to Yukio, he tells him that it'd be best if he deactivated them.
       </p>
       <p key="5c4fa60c-07a2-4fbd-9165-911046b8b9d4">
        Hitsugaya destroys the monsters before they touch Yukio. While Yukio was surprised that Hitsugaya saved him, Hitsugaya tells him that he didn't show him mercy; he simply saved him because there was no guarantee the dimension would disappear if Yukio died. He proceeds to freeze Yukio's body save for his right arm and head, telling him that in exchange for disabling his Fullbring within 5 minutes, he will spare his life.
        Subsequently, Yukio shuts down the chatrooms, and Hitsugaya meets with other Shinigami, taking a trapped Yukio with him. Upon seeing Byakuya with an unconscious Rukia, Yukio tells him that he doesn't know what happened to

        Along with the other captains, he looks on as Ichigo breaks apart the last remaining pocket dimension with his Bankai.

        As Hitsugaya and the others turn to leave, Byakuya reminds Rukia that they were only tasked with observing Ichigo and his decision. Hitsugaya tells her that the captains knew that if a new Substitute Shinigami ever appeared, Kūgo would take an interest in them and that they had agreed to use that Substitute to lure out Kūgo and get rid of them both. But when they encountered Ichigo, Soul Society changed and they restored his powers and went to watch over him instead. He reminds Rukia of her reaction to being told to observe Ichigo and acknowledges that she was correct. Hitsugaya states that he is glad Ichigo is the one that followed Kūgo.
        When Ichigo subsequently goes to Soul Society to seek the return of Kūgo's body, Hitsugaya is informed of his arrival and is among the captains present to hear Ichigo's request.

        After the Wandenreich retreat, Hitsugaya is present with several other captains, mourning the loss of the Captain-Commander. Despite the fighting between the others, Hitsugaya remains silent throughout the ordeal.
        Hitsugaya and the other captains later gather outside Seireitei to witness the arrival of the

        .
        Realizing that he can't lament over the loss of his Bankai and that he must move forward, Hitsugaya attends a dojo to retrain himself in the basics of swordsmanship.

       <p key="a08cb11f-1252-4b37-bc6b-f4f9b7297902">
        Later, upon the Wandenreich's return, Hitsugaya appears on the battlefield alongside Matsumoto just in time to protect several Shinigami from
        Bazz-B
        's fire-based attack, using his own ice-powers to create a protective barrier.
        Bazz-B recognizes Hitsugaya and notes that he had his Bankai stolen by Cang Du. He introduces himself as "The Heat," and notes how nice a match it is for them to face each other. Hitsugaya and Rangiku begin to battle, but Bazz-B has an easy time melting Hitsugaya's thin ice. However, after he and Rangiku initiate their strategy, Bazz-B is rendered unable to melt the ice walls entirely. Hitsugaya explains how he managed to do that to a confused Bazz-B. Hitsugaya then uses the ice to slash and wound Bazz-B.
        However, as Hitsugaya and Rangiku turn to leave, he is shocked that Bazz-B, who taunts them on leaving so soon, is still alive and able to fight.

       <p key="10d8e0d0-0690-4110-bf8c-a363c6d29efa">
        Hitsugaya attempts to fight back, but to no avail. He is then shocked by Bazz-B's elaboration on his powers and how he was strong enough to protect himself and two other Sternritter from Yamamoto's flames. Hitsugaya continues the attack, but realizing that Bazz-B is too powerful, he orders Rangiku to retreat while he holds off Bazz-B. Hitsugaya sets up a barrier made with fine ice, but Bazz-B easily breaks through it and blasts a hole through Hitsugaya.

       <p key="78ad179b-5051-4891-9829-d288901661de">
        Hitsugaya attempts to fight off Bazz-B, but fails at every turn. He tries another trap, but is shocked to see Bazz-B quickly break free from it. Much of his upper body is then blasted away by Bazz-B's attack.
        Cang Du
        then arrives to finish Hitsugaya off.
        Hitsugaya then watches in shock as Cang lays down a severely wounded Rangiku in front of him. He then witnesses Cang activating his own Bankai. Hitsugaya then receives a
        Shin'eiyaku
        , which he takes, causing his Bankai to break and wound Cang.
        As this happens Cang checks his medallion only to determine that it is working normally, so he is further confused as to why Hyōrinmaru is starting to return to Hitsugaya. As he regains part of the ice wing that Cang lost, Hitsugaya states he doesn't know, and that maybe his Bankai just wants to come back to him.
       </p>
       <p key="eb6870e3-ec3f-4ced-92e7-d3b2bb2d688b">
        Cang begins to attack and points out that the Sternritter are taught to control the Bankai they have stolen. He attempts to attack Hitsugaya with ice but it redirects itself before reaching him. Hitsugaya tells him not to overdo it as it can't attack itself. As he continues to attack Cang notes that Hitsugaya has used the tactic as well previously and should stop talking as if Bankai have a soul. Hitsugaya questions this way of thinking before he suddenly hears the voice of Hyōrinmaru, to which he remarks that its been a while since he heard him and welcomes him back. Hyōrinmaru fully returns to him, taking on some darker manifestations, reflected in the ice armor. Hitsugaya states that he thought Hyōrinmaru's face was a pain but then he remembered that the Bankai Hollowfied for a few seconds, so he'll have to deal with it for the time being. Cang attempts an attack but much to his surprise Hitsugaya counters the attack stating that the cross-shaped flower is Hyōrinmaru's crest. As Cang is encased in a giant cross-shaped flower, he apologizes for not making it a pentagram.
        After defeating Cang Du, Hitsugaya tells Rangiku to wait as he starts moving, but quickly collapses.

        during her battle with
        Mayuri Kurotsuchi
        and his team of revived Arrancar, having been turned into one of her zombies.
        Hitsugaya unleashes a wave of ice, which freezes Ikkaku's right leg solid before stabbing him through the chest. Hitsugaya slashes him across the back before attacking again, only for Yumichika to block his sword. However, Hitsugaya creates a spike of ice on his kneecap and knees Yumichika in the abdomen before slashing him across the chest. When Mayuri comments on how his body is moving the same way it did when he was alive, Hitsugaya slashes at him, but Mayuri moves behind him with Shunpo.
        Charlotte Chuhlhourne
        appears before Hitsugaya and states he is cute before proclaiming he is glad to have gotten Hitsugaya as his opponent. However, Hitsugaya merely slashes him across the chest in response. When he tries to attack again, Mayuri blocks his slash with a Kidō barrier.

       <p key="44f85f8d-e642-4945-93c3-1e87b2a36123">
        After Mayuri suggests that Hitsugaya help him test some medicines, the two captains exchange blows. Mayuri manages to parry all of Hitsugaya's strikes, claiming to have installed a sensor in his Zanpakutō that allows him to parry all incoming blades. Hitsugaya responds by trying to knee Mayuri, but he blocks this. As Mayuri suggests that he had been goading Hitsugaya in to such an act, he injures the young captain's leg. Hitsugaya then activates his Bankai and cuts Mayuri down. However, a confused Hitsugaya finds himself back at the start of their battle, with Mayuri again commenting that he will use his medicine on him. He attacks Mayuri again and quickly uses his Bankai to kill Mayuri, only to find himself reliving the encounter once again. When he questions what is happening, Mayuri explains that he is under the effects of his medicine, which is allowing him to see the future. Every time he kills Mayuri, he will return to a set point in the past. The only way Hitsugaya can avoid repeating this forever is to not kill him. Mayuri notes that the drug is incomplete and has serious side-effects after ten rounds, leaving him without a sense of balance for about thirty seconds. Mayuri then asks when he administered the medicine and swings his blade down on Hitsugaya, saying he should find out on his next trip back in time.

        Mayuri impales Hitsugaya with his Zanpakutō and releases his Shikai, paralyzing him, before preparing a drug. As Mayuri explains it causes him discomfort to use such a drug on a defenseless foe, Hitsugaya screams for him to stop, prompting Mayuri to state that it makes it easier to see him fight back with words. He begins to inject and administer Hitsugaya with the drug, which makes his skin blacken and causes him to scream in agony, prompting a zombified

        Following his victory over Giselle, Mayuri takes an injured Hitsugaya and, along with Rangiku, places him in a special container that will allow them to de-zombify and recover from the battle. This comes at a cost of shortening their lifespans but the scientist decides that the cost is worth getting their lives back. When the rest of the surviving Shinigami travel to the

        Gerard breaks free of the ice, forcing Hitsugaya to come up with another plan. Gerard attempts to attack Hitsugaya, but his strike is blocked by Byakuya, who states that Hitsugaya could not hope to take on the Quincy alone. Hitsugaya attempts joking with Byakuya, but gets annoyed as his fellow captain only half-heartedly reacts. Gerard attacks them again, but Kenpachi arrives and severs his arm, to Hitsugaya and Byakuya's dismay.
        After Gerard regenerates his arm, Byakuya explains the power of his

When Kenpachi attempts to attack Gerard again, Hitsugaya intercepts his strike while berating him for not considering what might happen to the Seireitei below if Gerard falls on it from such a height. Interrupted by Gerard stomping on them, Hitsugaya is shocked to see Kenpachi easily block and throw back the giant, and is further surprised when he releases his Shikai.

Kenpachi then jumped up and batted Hitsugaya into the ground, causing Hitsugaya to angrily ask what his problem was. Kenpachi tells him that he needs to stand down, and Byakuya silences Hitsugaya before he can retort. Hitsugaya says that he cannot leave Kenpachi on his own, as Gerard was not someone he could take on alone as evidenced by the Shinigami removing his eyepatch. Hitsugaya notes that his ice petals are starting to melt away and that they were all at their limits. He then tells Byakuya that he will look for an opening and use all his power to freeze Gerard to the bone, after which Byakuya should smash him to pieces with

        After watching Kenpachi bisect Gerard, Hitsugaya states that they should probably keep their distance, which Byakuya agrees with. Hitsugaya is shocked as Kenpachi flips through the air and lets out a guttural roar, and he and Byakuya turn back to Gerard to see him reforming back into one piece.

However, Hitsugaya refuses, saying that he never said that his Bankai ended once the petals were gone. Revealing that his Bankai reaches full maturity once the last petal disappears, Hitsugaya transforms into an adult with ice covering his forearms, shoulders, and lower legs.

Hitsugaya then collapses but is caught by Byakuya, who notes that Hitsugaya pushed his body to the brink with his Bankai, which Hitsugaya affirms. Suddenly, energy begins forming around Gerard as he regenerates, which bewilders and angers Hitsugaya.
        Renji and Rukia then emerge and are overwhelmed by Gerard's new form, and Hitsugaya notes aloud that they are still alive. He tells the two that the Quincy they faced before does not compare to the monster in front of them now, but the two Shinigami do not recognize him in his matured state. Rukia states that he must be Hitsugaya's older brother, which Hitsugaya reluctantly affirms.

        After Byakuya sends Rukia and Renji away, Hitsugaya welcomes his return, and begins explaining that the true duty of a Shinigami is not to fight for their superiors or family, but to protect their friends and Humans. Hitsugaya then surmises that it would be most appropriate for Rukia and Renji to go to where Ichigo is, regardless of whether it's a contravention of duty or not.

   : Perhaps the most astonishing trait of Hitsugaya is his intellect and natural talent. He is the most gifted prodigy the Soul Society has had since

   , entering the Shinigami Academy on his first try despite his young age, graduating from the academy in a single year with the highest written and performance scores in each of his classes, joining the Gotei 13 shortly afterwards, and then becoming the youngest Shinigami to ever reach the rank of captain. He has been called many things due to this. Renji and Iba have called him a child genius, and Ichimaru has called him the embodiment of the "heavenly white angel that blesses Soul Society once a century". In terms of intellect, Hitsugaya is equally impressive. He was the first to suspect Ichimaru of treason, and saw that there was more to Rukia's execution than what was being said. Shunsui, one of the strongest Shinigami in history, states that because he is a genius, within 100 years, Hitsugaya could surpass him.

     Expert Strategist &amp; Tactician

    : Despite his age, Hitsugaya has great instinct and intuition in battle. He is generally aware of everything in his presence, and is also able to see through most deceptions. For example, he discerned that Gin Ichimaru was more than he seemed, although he was not yet sharp enough to realize it was all part of Aizen's plot. He is also a keen analyst, able to deduce the basic mechanics behind an opponent's attacks, and quickly figuring out its strength and weakness to better counter it.
    As a captain, he is a capable leader. He is given missions from Captain-Commander Yamamoto to lead teams into the Human World many times to deal with threats. For example, Hitsugaya led the team sent by Soul Society that reinforced Ichigo's group against the Arrancar.
    In battle, he has great instincts against incoming danger, such as from his reaction to Harribel's initial attack after releasing.
    After losing his Bankai to the
    Sternritter
    , Hitsugaya was forced to come up with several creative and unorthodox methods of using his limited Shikai capabilities, such as combining his Zanpakutō powers with Matsumoto's

    Master Swordsman

   : Hitsugaya is masterful at swordsmanship, capable of utilizing his size to effectively counter and outmaneuver his opponents. His skill in swordsmanship is evident in the fact that he is the youngest Shinigami captain; he is therefore one of the youngest Shinigami to achieve Bankai. His skill in swordsmanship is great enough that he rarely uses even his Shikai in battle, at which he has great proficiency with. Instead, he relies on Hyōrinmaru's sealed form, only using its Shikai or Bankai when things get tough.

    Immense Spiritual Power
   </b>
   : Tōshirō's spiritual power has the same effect as his Zanpakutō, as it is an elemental representative of ice. His
   Spiritual Pressure
   is said to be very large and "cold". Even before he became a Shinigami, his spiritual pressure was immense and uncontrollable, like Ichigo's, and caused people around him to freeze, namely his grandmother, who lived with him at the time. This cold spiritual power of his reflects his attitude as well. He is also the youngest Shinigami to ever achieve their Bankai. He even had visions of Hyōrinmaru's spirit before he attained it or entered the Shinigami academy.
   He is able to hide his presence well; on several occasions he manages to surprise Hinamori and Matsumoto with his sudden appearances, which leads them to complain about him "sneaking up" on them.
   His Reiatsu is white.

   with the exception of the guard, which is in the shape of a four-pointed bronze-colored star. Its hilt is light blue, and sheath dark blue. The sheath completely dissolves when he draws his sword. The sword is somewhat longer than most Zanpakutō, at about 1.4 meters long. This makes it taller than Hitsugaya, preventing him from wearing it at the hip. Because of this, Hitsugaya instead carries it on his back by his green sash over his right shoulder.

   Hyōrinmaru is the strongest of all ice-element Zanpakutō in Soul Society. As such, Hitsugaya doesn't need water to be present in order for him to use its abilities.
   Hitsugaya's control over Hyōrinmaru's power is great enough to use some of its Bankai techniques while in Shikai, though it can backfire and affect him as well.
   The difference in ability between Hyōrinmaru's Shikai and Bankai is very small; the true difference lies in the quantities of ice each form can create, with the Shikai only being able to create comparatively small quantities.

    "): Hitsugaya's Bankai causes ice to flow from Hyōrinmaru onto Hitsugaya, starting at his right arm, which ice forms onto in the shape of a dragon's head around his sword hand, encasing the sword up to the hilt, which also changes from the shape of a four-pointed star to that of an eight-pointed star. The ice continues forming up over his shoulders, with two large wings sprouting from his back and a long tail. The ice forms down his left arm and encases his hand, which ends in a claw. Hitsugaya's feet are encased in ice in a similar manner to his left hand, as they also end in claws.
    These new ice limbs are movable, and can be used as an extension of himself to aid in battle. During some appearances of his Bankai, three flowers of ice form floating behind him, each consisting of four purple petals shaped like diamonds.
    These flowers melt away, petal by petal, as Hitsugaya's battle progresses, leading

    Following the final battle against Aizen, Hitsugaya trained and strengthened his Bankai considerably, completing its development after eighteen months of hard work.
    Sometime later during his battle against
    Gerard Valkyrie
    , Hitsugaya states that Daiguren Hyōrinmaru reaches completion when the last petal of his ice flowers falls.
    He claims that his power was not mature enough to use his Bankai to its fullest, but he managed to age himself to an adult body when it reached completion in order to achieve its full potential. As an adult using his Bankai, Hitsugaya is tall and lanky, and has ice covering his shoulders, forearms, and knees.

     I can't say I expected your speed and range to increase so dramatically the moment you released. It's a good thing I played it safe. This little trick is a one-time deal, so I didn't really want to have to use it quite so early. Don't underestimate it. The power of a Shinigami.

     Since you were kind enough to lecture me, allow me to tell you something. You are in the greatest danger when you execute a flawless strategy. That, too, is the way of battle.

     Wielding one's blade out of duty alone is what it means to be a captain. Wielding one's blade out of hatred is nothing more than petty violence. That is not what we would consider battle.

     You've got it exactly right, Aizen. I wield this blade out of hatred. I didn't come here to do battle. I'm here to slice you to pieces as a sheer act of violence!

I must cast aside that which I have lost. I don't have time to be fruitlessly hoping for its return. I must keep moving forward. Moving forward..."
