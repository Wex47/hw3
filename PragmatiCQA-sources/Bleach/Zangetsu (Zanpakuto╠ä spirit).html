   Zangetsu appears to be virtually identical to Ichigo, except inverted in color. He is a fairly tall and lean-built being with white skin and hair. His eyes consist of black pupils, white irises, and black
   sclera
   .
   He has black nails. While Ichigo wears a standard black Shinigami

   Zangetsu's most distinguishing features are his maniacal laughter and psychotic smiling. He is brutal, arrogant, disrespectful, murderous, and sadistic. Though he taunts Ichigo as being a weak and unsuitable counterpart of himself,
   he relishes the idea of Ichigo growing stronger as he also grows stronger as a result.
   Unlike Ichigo, he battles like a berserker, ignoring injuries and overpowering his enemies with brute strength and force.
   He protects Ichigo's body when he is about to die because if Ichigo dies, he will as well.
   He seems to respect

   </a>
   to a certain extent, at one occasion referring him as "Zangetsu-san" and play along with his lie.
   Additionally, both manifestations claims to prefer more lush, natural surroundings, like bright, sunny skies, green forests and animals than one of tall glassy skyscrapers as Ichigo's inner world.
   Due to his status as a Zanpakutō spirit, Zangetsu doesn't get much opportunity to fight and gets really excited on the rare occasions he does get to fight.

   , he tells him he will no longer be the servant of someone weaker than him, and now he will be in control. Gaining his will, Ichigo grabs the sword in his stomach and transforms it into his black version.
   Pulling out the sword, Ichigo attacks the now defenseless Zangetsu by impaling him through the stomach. As Zangetsu's clothes become black like Ichigo's, he begins to disintegrate into the wind. Before Zangetsu totally disappears, he reminds Ichigo he concedes to his control only for now, and one day, given the smallest opening, he will take control and destroy Ichigo. He tells Ichigo if he truly wants to master his power, he must stay alive.
   It was later revealed this was all planned by Zangetsu and the manifestation of Ichigo's Quincy powers in order to teach Ichigo how to properly utilize Bankai.

As Ulquiorra states he cannot believe he was defeated by a Human turned Hollow, Zangetsu steps on Ulquiorra's head and begins charging a Cero.

When Ichigo asks him why his appearance changed, the manifestation informs him he took this form when he killed Ulquiorra and states Ichigo fears this form, for the destructive power overwhelms his heart to the point where he cannot even Hollowfy properly. When Ichigo concludes he has to fight Zangetsu and win, the manifestation tells him this is incorrect, for Ichigo is going to fight both of them in a one-on-one fight. They begin to fuse together, much to Ichigo's confusion, and take on a new form. Upon fusing, they take on a hybrid appearance: Zangetsu's white Bankai coat, black horn mask remnant, white-colored hair, and left Hollowfied eye, alongside Tensa Zangetsu's appearance and black Bankai sword.

   in more versatile and effective maneuvers, such as using his Shikai as a flail, with which he has demonstrated tremendous aim and control of where and how it strikes. While Ichigo fights in a deductive and logical manner, Zangetsu fights in a style more akin to a berserker, relying on instinct with little to no regard towards his own well-being.
   Despite this, he is a keen strategist, using his speed to attack Byakuya from two sides with Getsuga Tenshō and then appear above him to keep from escaping by jumping above the two sided attacks. He also claims to have more experience with Bankai than Ichigo even when they both awakened it only hours before utilizing it against Byakuya.

    Zangetsu uses the cloth on his blade to swing his Zanpakutō and toss it at opponents for mid-range combat. The blade moves very fast when thrown, and its impact can damage a building. If the person dodges the attack, Zangetsu can use the cloth to manage the sword's direction and try to hit the target once more. By gripping the cloth, he withdraws the blade and swings it to attack again.

He quickly realizes mistakes in Ichigo's battle tactics and corrects them, and almost instantly adapts to his opponent's battle tactics to perfectly counter them.

It covers Ichigo's entire head, and its markings are different, for it has four spike-shaped marks, two of them stopping by the forehead and the other two stretching past the eyes and teeth, going past his chin and joining with the marks on his chest. There are small marks resembling a heart, but with the top and bottom open, extending from the inner corners of his eyes. The mask features two long forward-pointing horns, with black strips extending from their center towards the tips.
   Zangetsu has his own version of this form, with the opposite colors alternating black with white and vice versa.

    the manifestation of Ichigo's Quincy powers

   are both the source of Ichigo's power and share the same spiritual body in Ichigo's inner world, the stronger presence retaining more control (and overall appearance) of their body. Zangetsu takes the form of an all-white (clothes and being), somewhat deranged version of Ichigo's Shinigami form with a strong desire to take control of Ichigo's body and power for himself.
   Zangetsu originally used a black Zangetsu obtained from the manifestation.
   However, after he becomes the dominant spirit inside Ichigo's mind, Zangetsu carries his own white version of Ichigo's Zanpakutō.

    : The Shikai form of Zangetsu resembles an oversized
    khyber knife
    . It has no tsuba and no proper hilt; what Zangetsu holds is the cloth-wrapped tang. The sword is as long as Zangetsu is tall (1.75 meters),
    and has a silver blade with a black edge. The cloth wrapping on the tang seems to react to Zangetsu's will, changing length at a thought or twining about the blade in an impromptu sheath. When in combat, the cloth falls away when necessary, shrinking back to a manageable size.
    The cloth can be used to swing the weapon like a
    flail
    and toss it at opponents for mid-range combat,
    and can wrap up wounds.
    The wide blade can be used as a shield from incoming attacks.
    Unlike most Zanpakutō, which can be sealed into their original form, the blade is always in its Shikai form.

    ): It is considered completely out of the ordinary for any Zanpakutō. Unlike most Bankai, which usually create some sort of massive creature or effect, Zangetsu's Bankai actually shrinks his sword down to a
    daitō
    (Japanese long sword) with a white blade, crossguard, and handle instead. The crossguard has four prongs bent out to form the shape of the manji (which is the kanji for "ban," meaning "full", as in "full release"). The blade itself is durable enough to withstand even the strongest of attacks, making it quite effective in blocking and deflecting incoming attacks.
    It can withstand getting crushed by force.
    Instead of the cloth Zangetsu's Shikai had, a short length of chain with a broken link at the end dangles from the base of the hilt. The chain can be used to spin the sword with one finger.
    In addition to his sword, Zangetsu's robe is replaced with a long-sleeved, ankle-length white coat with black lining which is closed at his chest and left to flare out into ragged ends.
    Zangetsu wore a black

   pulls Zangetsu out of Ichigo during the latter's Dangai training, the two spirits merged into one form, which combined aspects from both spirit's appearances; Zangetsu's white Bankai coat, black horn mask remnant, white-colored hair, and left Hollowfied eye alongside the manifestation's appearance, right blue eye, and white Bankai sword, though the sword's tsuba is black like Zangetsu's.
   In this form, the manifestation explains he and Zangetsu were technically two parts of the same being, with both of them together representing all of Ichigo's spiritual powers.
   Ichigo claims if this merged spirit really wanted to, he could have defeated him from the start of their battle, further stating they were this far apart in power.

If their form, ability and power were exactly the same, why is it that one becomes the king and controls the battle, while the other becomes the horse and carries the king?! There's only one answer. Instinct! In order for identical beings to get stronger and gain the power they need to become king, they must search for more battles and power! They thirst for battle, and live to mercilessly, crush, shred, and slice their enemies! Deep, deep within our body lies the honed instinct to kill, and slaughter our enemies! But you don't have that! You don't have those pure, base instincts! You fight with your brain. You try to defeat your enemies with logic! And it doesn't work! You're trying to cut them with a sheathed sword!
