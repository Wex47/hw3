   Rukia's favorite foods are cucumber, eggs, and rice dumplings.

        Sentarō Kotsubaki
        , who tried to encourage her.
        Kaien mentored Rukia, teaching her how to fight.
        Their first training location was Mount Koifushi of Hokutan, the 3rd District of West Rukongai, where Kaien taught her about the concept of the heart.

        She offered to go first in order to scout out its abilities, but Kaien asked to face the Hollow alone. When its special ability destroyed Kaien's Zanpakutō, Rukia attempted to help, but was stopped by Ukitake. He told her Kaien's fight was one of honor rather than a fight for his life. If she were to help, Kaien's life would be saved, but his honor would be forever damaged. After protesting about this, Rukia reluctantly obeyed his order. However, the Hollow, entering Kaien's body, possessed him.

        The Hollow attempted to attack Rukia, but Ukitake, blocking it, sent Rukia away as he fought it. Afraid to fight it, she obeyed, but she came back because she wished to help Kaien and was afraid to face her cowardice in future. As it leaped at her, she noted it was no longer Kaien. Unable to bear seeing him like that, she stabbed Kaien. He thanked Rukia and apologized for dragging her into it. Kaien died in Rukia's arms.
        Rukia brought the corpse to the Shiba family estate, but was afraid to apologize out of guilt from her role in Kaien's death.

        When they find the Hollow, they find Kon is already fighting it. After it is defeated, Urahara arrives to reclaim Kon. Rukia tells him she is content with her purchase, and he does not have to worry about it. Later, Rukia and Ichigo see a news report about the incident on TV. Ichigo asks what they should do, but gets no reply.

        She, transforming him into a Shinigami, carries his body. Finding Ichigo's sisters, she sees Ichigo being confronted by Grand Fisher. Rukia, telling Ichigo about this infamous Hollow, berates him when he recklessly attacks it. As she realizes Grand Fisher killed his mother, Ichigo, stopping her from helping him with Kidō, tells her to stay out of the fight.

        When Grand Fisher escapes, Rukia tries to calm the heavily wounded Ichigo, insisting that the fight is over. When Ichigo collapses, she begins healing him.
        Rukia uses up most of her strength healing Ichigo's major wounds, so she returns him to his body before he is fully healed, reassuring him over the outcome of the battle. Rukia listens as Ichigo talks with Isshin. Afterwards, Ichigo asks Rukia if he can remain a Shinigami for a while longer.

She reveals she does not know what the "festival" is about. Ichigo explains it to her, but she still does not understand. He asks Rukia if there really is a spirit there, thinking the Shinigami would have dealt with it. She states it is likely a

Ichigo asks her if they should perform Konsō on the Jibakurei, but Rukia tells him it takes months to years for one to turn into a Hollow. Believing it would be trouble if there was a struggle with so many people there, she states they will do the Konsō after the show and seeks to reassure him. However, Don Kanonji jams his staff into the hole on the Demi-Hollow's chest.
        Rukia condemns Kanonji's actions. When Ichigo is pounced on by security after attempting to stop Kanonji, Rukia, trying to change him into a Shinigami, is caught as well. Urahara frees Ichigo, prompting Rukia to ask what he is scheming. Urahara, claiming he is there because Ururu and Jinta enjoy the show, frees her. After Urahara knocks the guards unconscious with a blast, Rukia berates him for using Soul Society's tools so freely.
        When the spirit disappears, Rukia, realizing its body is about to reform into a Hollow, searches for it with her Denreishinki. She yells at Ichigo to look above him,
        attracting the attention of some security guards.

Rukia finds Shū and Ichigo in a similar situation inside a secret part of the manor. She takes Shū through the forbidden rooms until they find a secret passage where Rurichiyo was taken.

Captain Amagai, appearing, kills Kumoi and takes Rurichiyo with him, to the complete surprise of those present.

Hoping to stop this problem quickly, Rukia, Sode no Shirayuki, and Senbonzakura search for them. Much to Rukia's annoyance, the two spirits' best ideas to find the Tōjū are to either create more destruction to lure them out or throw a big party. After the latter plan fails, Rukia talks with Sode no Shirayuki, who admits to how weak and foolish she feels for falling to Muramasa's control. Rukia assures her spirit she has always been of great help and importance to her. Soon afterwards, they encounter a Tōjū.

Rukia and Ichigo later arrive at an area where another high school girl was just attacked. Rukia tries to track the Tōjū's Reiatsu, but she is unable to.

When Äs claims she is unable to move because she has been struck by fear, Rukia stands up, unaffected by his power, and asks Äs what he fears before wondering if he is afraid of encountering someone he cannot defeat with fear.

As Rukia experiences intense fear, Byakuya cuts through the eyes, saving her.

        Rukia warns Byakuya to avoid eye contact with Äs as he unleashes his power again. However, the attack is easily deflected by Byakuya. While observing Äs running wild with rage, Byakuya compliments Rukia on becoming stronger, an acknowledgement which leads Rukia to shed a tear. He further encourages her by stating that she has nothing to fear, and with that, leaves the fight to her. Rukia unleashes her Bankai, and a blinding pillar of white emerges.
        As Äs is frozen solid and fades away, Rukia stands in her Bankai form as a crack appears on the back of her hand. Stepping forward, Byakuya tells her to slow down while returning to normal temperature. While complimenting her Bankai, Byakuya proceeds to tell Rukia it requires delicate control to prevent herself from getting harmed as well and reminds her that a blade wielded with the cost of the wielder's life will not be able to protect anything. She obeys Byakuya and moves on with him.

   She can use high-level Kidō in rapid succession without incantations and still retain considerable control and power. She has great skill in using various spells in unique combination, even using multiple spells at the same time. However, she requires incantations when using high-level spells simultaneously.

   . While in this form, instead of her own Zanpakutō, she has a gigantic, double-edged scythe, which she easily wields with one hand. Her outfit appears to be completely different, and she is barefooted. Her deep black hair is now lavender, as well as her eyes. While in this alternate state, her powers have been augmented and she fights in a much different manner than she does in her normal state.
