   Rangiku has long and wavy blond hair, blue eyes, full lips, and a beauty mark located under the right side of her mouth.
   She is well known for her curvaceous figure; of which her most distinctive trait is her very large breasts. She dresses in the garb typical of

   Seventeen months after Aizen's defeat, Rangiku sports a new hairstyle. It is shorter, stopping short of her shoulders and curling near her chin, the left side of which hangs over her face.
   Her shihakushō also has a split in it, which runs along the length of her right leg.

  <p key="01cd16c7-a555-480c-a3d4-3da2f6a99726">
   Rangiku tends to be a slacker who dislikes paperwork and loves to drink. She is not the slightest bit modest about her appearance, frequently referring or complaining about her large breasts in normal casual conversation, much to the embarrassment/amusement of anyone around at the time. She is not above using her considerable feminine charms to get her way, as shown when she tries - albeit unsuccessfully - to bribe
   <a href="Ichigo Kurosaki.html" key="29ac14ec-7bb8-4e7b-9664-765565e3a3bd" title="Ichigo Kurosaki">

   into letting her stay at his house.
   In fact, she would even consider stripping naked if no one compliments her on her outfit, regardless of how skimpy it may be.
  </p>
  <p key="02a97d25-55b9-49ea-b412-7f2aa2fc2b77">
   Her easy-going and free-spirited personality makes a sharp contrast to the serious Hitsugaya, but the two seem to be quite close regardless. Rangiku met the young boy prior to him utilizing his power and encouraged him to enter the
   Shinigami academy
   . As a lieutenant, she is extremely casual around him, almost constantly by his side and showing deep loyalty to him on several occasions, even though her laziness frequently annoys him.
  </p>
  <p key="589f473b-1c38-4321-a0c1-ac0b00016153">
   While she seems somewhat self-centered, she is sensitive to the feelings of others, evident when she sees the concern Hitsugaya has for
   Momo Hinamori
   , the guilt
   Izuru Kira
   shares with her when
   Gin Ichimaru
   is revealed as a traitor, and when

   feels depressed about her role in Ichigo Kurosaki's life. Despite her lackadaisical image, she can be extremely serious when needed and is a capable fighter and strategist, best-shown when she uses clever teasing to manipulate
   the third Espada
   's Fracción into squabbling among themselves long enough to drop their guard and leave them open for an attack.
  </p>
  <p key="5c288ff1-5983-4fa4-a76a-ef6664fbaad1">
   Rangiku's favorite food is dried persimmon, just like that of Ichimaru. She also shares Orihime's very strange taste in food. She dislikes bamboo shoots because she finds their taste too strong and their texture unpleasant. She likes Japanese dancing, and in addition to her shihakushō robes, she enjoys buying superfluous amounts of clothing from various department stores in the Human world. When she feels like drinking, she finds free people and invites them to come out with her, and then has them treat her to drinks, so that she wouldn't have to spend any money. She is drinking buddies with
   Shunsui Kyōraku
   and
   Shūhei Hisagi
   .

        Not much is known about Rangiku's prior history, except that she came from
        Rukongai
        . As a child, she was saved by
        Gin Ichimaru
        from starvation. He found her by the roadside and told her that if she has collapsed from hunger she must have spiritual power. She recognizes that he must have spiritual power too; Gin confirms that he too has spirit power and proceeds to introduce himself. Rangiku found his name weird.
       </p>
       <p key="241419f8-48bc-48ac-ab9d-d5d4701f3a0d">
        Following their meeting, they became best friends and began to live together. Gin often left without telling Rangiku where he was going, usually leaving her upset.
        It was during this time that Gin asked Rangiku when her birthday was. Rangiku replied that she did not know as she never counted days until she met him. Following the revelation, Gin told her that, that would mean that the day they met was her birthday.
       </p>
       <p key="db593eee-fdfa-4517-993e-2a8623310f49">
        One day, Gin met up with Rangiku as he wrapped a shihakushō around himself. She asked what he was doing with Shinigami clothes and where he got them. Gin simply replied that he had decided to become a Shinigami and change things, so that they would end without making her cry.
        Rangiku joined the
        Shin'ō Academy
        at the same time as Gin.
        It is unknown when she graduated.
       </p>
       <p key="a813e7f0-7443-4953-ba2f-6ea1fee09514">
        While out at the market, she met
        Tōshirō Hitsugaya
        . As she yelled at a shop keeper who was being rude to him, Hitsugaya turned around and was knocked down by bumping into her bosom. She then yelled at him for "lying there crying about it and not standing up like a man", although it was her who knocked him down with her large breasts in the first place, but he shook her off and ran away.
        Later that night, Rangiku followed Hitsugaya home and was there when he woke up. She immediately told him to stop leaking his
        Reiatsu
        everywhere and to get some sleep. She further explained that his grandmother looked pretty cold, which causes Hitsugaya for the first time to notice that the room was exceedingly cold and affecting his grandmother. Rangiku then told him he should become a Shinigami, stating that kids with power as strong as his need to learn how to bring that power under control. She explained that if he stayed the way he was that his power would end up killing his grandmother pretty soon. At first, Hitsugaya wasn't sure what she was talking about, but she calmly placed her hand on his chest and asked him if he heard a voice calling out to him. She explained to him that once he has found that voice, he'll understand how to control his power. She noted to him that for that to happen he must become a Shinigami.
       </p>
       <p key="c1b6a6b5-0cc9-437f-9f13-dff7a3595085">
        Rangiku worked her way up to the lieutenant of the
        10th Division
        where she served under Captain
        Isshin Shiba
        . She would regularly chastise him for neglecting his paperwork. One day, after pummeling him for his perverted comments, they met with Hitsugaya, who was at the time the 10th Division's 3rd Seat. Isshin praised Hitsugaya for finishing his paperwork, calling him worthy of being the next captain. This offended Rangiku, who felt that she should be next in line. Hitsugaya then pointed out that two more people have died recently in
        Naruki City
        . Isshin decided to investigate the situation personally, despite Rangiku insisting that he must report first to
        Yamamoto
        . Hitsugaya stopped her from following by pointing out that they would only get in the captain's way at their current level.
       </p>
       <p key="fb0100af-8fd4-4793-aae6-0ea07c1cff39">
        Later on after work had seemingly returned to normal once more, Rangiku attempted to persuade Isshin to do her paperwork while she went to a dango store for an 'important' mission, only to find he had left a note asking her to cover for him while the captain revisited the
        <a href="Human World.html" key="5a084295-0488-4abc-8e98-3381be694df8" title="Human World">
         Human World
        </a>
        . Tearing up the note in anger, Rangiku rants about him taking work too lightly, with Hitsugaya there to remind her of her own attitude.

She details that the reason that there are so few in attendance at the emergency lieutenant meeting is due to all the captains and lieutenants being scattered around Soul Society on their respective missions. She notes that it will take at least half a day to unite everyone. Rangiku then mentions that she can't find her captain anywhere, which prompts Renji to ask who is her captain.
        When the report is made that intruders have invaded the Seireitei Rangiku is among the others gathered at the meeting who are informed of those missing in action. When
        7th Division
        Lieutenant

Rangiku makes note that had her captain not found it the letter would have been taken in as evidence and Momo would have never seen it. Rangiku explains that she doesn't know what is in the letter but as a lieutenant she thinks it is a great honor to be a receiver of a captain's final words.

She then tells Gin to put away his sword, as if he doesn't, she will be his opponent.

Hitsugaya surmises they have been dead for at least 2 days, but he is concerned about when as Soul Society has been under martial law and their Headquarters had been locked down since Renji's defeat. Further than that, the 13 seals of protection were still active and there were no signs of intrusion. Then Hitsugaya realizes the only possible scenario is that they were killed before they were sealed in and that all the recent orders have been in fact false. It is then that he realizes that such a plot would be far too elaborate for Gin to carry out by himself. He then is interrupted by Izuru and he and Matsumoto give chase. Asking Izuru if he was behind the
        Central 46
        's death, Izuru tells him no and that he arrived just after he did. He also informs Hitsugaya that instead of chasing him, he should be protecting Momo. He then goes on to explain that she escaped the 10th Division Barracks and how she accomplished it. Realizing now that Hinamori has been following him and Matsumoto the entire time he turns back and orders Matsumoto to
        handle

        When Izuru realizes that Rangiku is now after him and Hitsugaya has gone he stops running. When Rangiku asks him if he was done running, he explains that he has a mission to keep her there. When she asks who gave him that mission he tells her that Gin did. Rangiku tries to reason with him, but Izuru refuses to answer her further. He then tells her that the reason he refuses to answer her is because she is about to die. He then releases his Shikai.
        He asks Rangiku if she knows about his Zanpakutō's special ability. Rangiku plainly tells him that she doesn't and she assumes no one does as he has never spoken about it. Izuru explains that in fact his former classmates Renji and Momo know of it, but he assures her she will now know it as well. The two face off and Rangiku realizes that her

Rangiku explains that if her Zanpakutō is too heavy she just won't carry it. Rangiku then reveals that his weight-affecting Zanpakutō is rendered useless by her Zanpakutō's ability to dissolve into ash.

     She also tries to cheer up Sado when he blames himself over Ururu's capture. When informed about Noba and his special Bount-detecting abilities, she removes him from his injured Gigai and forms a plan with him in his plush form. After combining her

        After the pillars that keep the real Karakura Town in Soul Society are successfully defended and four of
        Baraggan Louisenbairn

        Rangiku gets into verbal warfare with
        Emilou Apacci
        and
        Franceska Mila Rose
        causing them to argue among themselves as
        Cyan Sung-Sun
        criticizes them for taking her bait. She then tells the trio they should have surrounded her when they had the chance, but now that they are all in one spot they have lost any advantage that they had.

        Rangiku then releases her Zanpakutō, enveloping the three Arrancar in a cloud of ash. When some settles onto Apacci's arm and cuts her Rangiku explains the power of Haineko, to which she then encloses the ash all around them forming it into a twister. She informs them that they should watch out as the ash will cut anyone it touches, but the three tell her that she has underestimated them and combine their
        Cero
        to blast their way through, much to Rangiku's surprise before she tries to attack them again.
       </p>
       <p key="cd7f9acb-2788-4f9e-85f5-800b8abc307b">
        Apacci makes the statement that she should take a break as the three of them are obviously too much for Rangiku to handle by herself, prompting her to use Shunpo to get in close, but she is caught by Apacci who throws her away. She then uses Haineko to attack the Arrancar from a different angle, but Apacci blocks the attack with a Cero blast, then proceeds to attack Rangiku one on one, but she is interrupted when she is blasted by a fireball from
        Momo Hinamori
        's Zanpakutō.

        Rangiku is surprised at her arrival though Momo tells her not to worry, as while she may be wearing the 5th Division's lieutenant armband, it is only a symbol of her role as leader of the
        5th Division
        , not as Captain Aizen's subordinate, as he is now an enemy of Soul Society. Even though Rangiku tells her that she understands, she slightly worries as she still addresses him as 'Captain'. They are soon interrupted as Apacci throws her Zanpakutō at them from the cloud of smoke, prompting Rangiku to pull up a shield of ash to block the attack. The three attack all at once, but are soon caught in a "Kidō net", confusing the Arrancar completely. Momo then details to them and Rangiku how she managed to sneak up on Apacci and how she placed the net all around Rangiku, though never thinking she would catch all three in it. Momo then uses her Zanpakutō to ignite the Kidō net causing a massive explosion.

        After the attack Rangiku asks Momo if she is okay, to which she states that she is and that she has never done that before. Rangiku then notes that she used #12

        as she never has seen such a large and complicated one before. Rangiku remarks to herself that Momo made the spells her own and wondered when she got that strong, though she is happy that she is doing better. Unfortunately, the Arrancar escape Momo's attack, and use their
        Resurrección
        to heal themselves and then combine their powers to counterattack. Each of them sacrifice their left arm and use them to form a creature with an ability they call

        Apacci states that the creature is their pet and it's made from each of their left arms, and that its name is "
        Ayon
        ". Rangiku becomes frightened staring into the eyes of the creature and remarks that it's like staring into a deep hole you can't see the bottom of. The creature charges at her as she calls upon Haineko to counter it, but it tears through the right side of her abdomen, severely injuring her as Momo screams out to her.

Momo then notes that the creature has taken out everything under her ribs on the right side and she can't breathe like that, but the creature attacks Momo as well, taking her out with one punch to her stomach sending her flying. Momo is then saved by the timely arrival of
        3rd Division

        Yamamoto
        arrives and easily burns Ayon into oblivion with his Shikai. In response, Apacci, Mila Rose, and Sung-Sun then attempt an attack on Yamamoto, only to be burned effortlessly by his Shikai.
        Rangiku, still wounded, is eventually taken into a barrier set up by Izuru, lying unconscious, along with the other wounded officers.

        Tatsuki Arisawa
        , but Rangiku blocks his strike from hitting Aizen and saves him, remarking that she made it in time.
        She tells Kanonji that she will handle Gin and Aizen and that he should take the girls and run. When he tries to protest she threatens him with bodily harm if he does not leave, which he does. Aizen asks Rangiku if she meant that she was in time to save the Humans who just escaped or to stop the destruction of Karakura Town and creation of the Ōken, claiming she is wrong either way.

        Gin tells Aizen that he will talk to her and grabs Rangiku. He takes her some blocks away, until Rangiku tells him to let her go, sending her flying down to the roof of a building, landing without injury. Gin asks her why she is there, to which she explains that once his Reiatsu disappeared she went ahead to the

When Gin points out he did not ask how she got there, but why she came with such a shaky body, Rangiku asks him isn't it obvious, she came because he is here. She then asks him straight out why he is working under Aizen and why he betrayed Kira despite him believing in him so much. Gin responds by asking her whether she is seriously asking him this. He then asks if Kira really said 'I believed in him, yet he betrayed me,' surprising Rangiku. Gin touches her necklace and asks why she has really come as he moves in close and points his blade at her face, telling her she is in the way.

        Rangiku later awakens feeling out of breath and immediately identifies that Gin used the
        Hakufuku
        Kidō spell to knock her out.
        Rangiku arrives to seen Gin's fallen body and screams out his name. She holds him in her arms; as she realizes he is dying, she cries. Aizen closes in on them as Rangiku grieves for Gin, but Aizen's attention is drawn away from them as Ichigo arrives with his unconscious father to confront him.

        12th Division
        Headquarters undergoing organ restoration, but before she can see her, she leaves without a word. She is later seen standing in the shadows as Hitsugaya arduously trains to get stronger. Rangiku thinks of how everyone is moving on, as she recalls how neither Hisagi nor Renji were at their divisions' headquarters; she figures they are both off training somewhere. She notes that she is moving on as well, recalling that whenever Gin disappeared he'd leave her nothing to remember him by and she hated him for that. She then notes that had he left her something then she would probably be stuck in that spot forever and she is sure that he knew that about her. She then silently thanks him as she loved that part of him.

     Senbonzakura
     throw a party to try to lure out a rampant
     Tōjū

     Later, Rangiku decides to follow her captain to the Human World to help him, but not without having some fun first. Later, she along with Orihime and Haineko are attacked by a Tōjū that has transformed by fusing with a Hollow. During its attack, Rangiku loses her
     Soul Candy

     While searching for Tōjū with Haineko and members of the
     10th Division
     , Matsumoto helps defeat several Tōjū. When Haineko returns, she tells her that she found and killed a Tōjū. Later, Haineko asks Rangiku the possibility of having someone's Tōjū status revoked. Rangiku says it cannot be done, as based on a report from the
     12th Division
     ; most Tōjū will eventually lose control and attack. When she asks why Haineko brought it up in the first place, she nervously claims that it was just out of curiosity. Hitsugaya and Hyōrinmaru inform Matsumoto that supplies have been disappearing from the Division. Matsumoto denies knowing who could be behind it. However, she is suspicious that Haineko is behind the thefts, and so asks where Haineko was at during all the times she was not in Seireitei. Haineko says that she was simply "out". Unable to get a clear answer, Rangiku tells her of how a thief has been stealing supplies and asks if Haineko knows anything about it. Unconvinced by Haineko's denial, Matsumoto states that it is kind of scary, prompting Haineko to leave almost immediately.

     Matsumoto follows Haineko to a hut, where she finds the Zanpakutō with the Tōjū
     Narunosuke
     , who is suffering from painful migraines. She tells him that he is losing control and becoming a Tōjū. She asks why Haineko chose not to tell her. When she does not receive a reply, she reminds her of the position they are all in; as a Shinigami and Zanpakutō, they are obligated to kill any Tōjū for the safety of Soul Society's residents, and tells Haineko to get away from him so that she can kill him. As Haineko refuses, Narunosuke's pain and anger quickly transform him into a Tōjū. He destroys the hut, forcing all of them to flash-step away from the wreckage. He remains on the ground in pain, enabling Haineko to challenge Matsumoto, stating that she will have to kill both of them as Tōjū. When Haineko and Matsumoto attack each other with their Shikai, Narunosuke, now a fully-transformed Tōjū, knocks Matsumoto away and attacks Haineko, but is blocked by Matsumoto, whom he knocks away once again. Haineko envelopes herself and Narunosuke in her Shikai and kills him. Later, Haineko explains to Rangiku that the reason she kept quiet about it all was due to her crush on Narunosuke, which Rangiku says she already knew about. Still concerned for her Zanpakutō's well-being, Rangiku asks if Haineko would be alright later on. When Haineko confusedly asks what she means by that, Rangiku claims that it was nothing, prompting Haineko to state that Matsumoto is just teasing her. When Haineko says that she's "kinda glad" that she's still young, and Rangiku asks her why, Haineko playfully stats that she still has "plenty of time until I become an old hag", prompting Rangiku to warmly smile at her in response.

     In the Human World, Rangiku and Nanao complete their share of the cleansing of the area around Karakura Town. They had been setting up barriers for the past month. Rangiku suggests that they celebrate, prompting Nanao to note that Rangiku has seemed somewhat depressed recently. She receives a call from Hitsugaya on her Denreishinki, with her captain criticizing her for not making regular progress reports. When she informs him that they are finished, he orders her to return. Nanao opens a Senkaimon and the pair enter the Dangai, noting that while it is the designated path, it is creepy. As Rangiku notices something odd, their

     After fending off Inaba and forcing him to retreat, Rangiku joins other members of the Gotei 13 as they hold a meeting in Ichigo's room. Later, Kon runs into her on the street and realizes the Rangiku he had seen earlier was a Reigai. Rangiku arrives later to defeat her Reigai copy by releasing her Shikai.
     Rangiku is then confronted by Izuru's Reigai at a construction site in Karakura Town. At first, Rangiku feels overly confidant, given how she easily negated Wabisuke's effects in their previous encounter. However, Rangiku drops her weapon after only a few strikes and the Reigai reveals that his abilities increase the weight of an object by tenfold instead of just doubling it like the original. Unarmed, Rangiku is forced to evade the Reigai's attacks as he moves too fast for her to use Kidō while she tries to get near enough to pick up Haineko. Eventually, she is able to trick the Reigai by covering a metal pole with her scarf so that the weight increase traps his weapon while Rangiku rushes towards her weapon and unleashes her

     After Rukia Kuchiki's battle with the two Reigai, Rangiku Matsumoto appears, noting that the battles have now ended. Rangiku agrees with Rukia's statement that they should search for Nozomi Kujō, walking alongside Nemu Kurotsuchi. However, Rukia comments that they are full of openings, prompting Rangiku to turn back. She gets slashed across the chest area, as Nemu sprawls onto the ground. Rangiku is surprised that she was a Reigai all along, locking blades with Reigai-Rukia Kuchiki. Eventually, both Rangiku and Nemu are overpowered, falling to the lake below them.
     They are found by Orihime, who proceeds to heal her comrades.
     Later, Ichigo overlooks Rangiku's healing process.

Later, when the Reigai of Kenpachi Zaraki breaks out of Urahara's trap and arrives in the Human World, Rangiku and the other lieutenants arrive to help Ikkaku fight him. However, Ikkaku warns them to stay out of his fight. Rangiku criticizes him for this, but he tells her they have their own opponents. When more Reigai arrive, Rangiku leaves to fight the new arrivals.
     Rangiku joins Iba and Sado in facing the Reigai-Komamura, but they are easily overwhelmed and forced back. Upon rejoining their allies, it is decided to rely on Nozomi's energy-absorbing

They all direct their energy into Nozomi's blade, who then launches a powerful blast that defeats all the Reigai, except for Reigai-Byakuya, who retaliates with a blast of his own that knocks out everyone except for Ichigo and Nozomi. Before Reigai-Byakuya can finish them off, Yamamoto arrives and quickly defeats the Reigai.

     After recovering, she joins the other healed Shinigami in returning to Soul Society, where they assist the captains in facing the Reigai. Rangiku faces off against her own counterpart.
     Despite evening out the numbers, Rangiku and the other Shinigami are quickly pressured by the Reigai. Byakuya Kuchiki then realizes the truth behind the Reigai's battle style: they value self-preservation the most and won't attack first in fear of being outnumbered. The lieutenants then team up.
