As Ichigo asks Byakuya if he has noticed something strange is going on, Byakuya's attendant sees him from afar and moves away. When Byakuya asks Ichigo what is talking about, Ichigo tells him to not play ignorant and affirms that Rukia is Hisana's sister, which Byakuya should know very well. While Byakuya says Rukia's name, Ichigo details how she is his younger sister-in-law whom he tried to protect even if it meant breaking the rules.

Elsewhere, at a park, Byakuya sits and recalls his past with Hisana. In the past, Byakuya and Hisana walk over a bridge. When Byakuya asks if Hisana went to Rukongai again today, Hisana confirms this and apologizes, but Byakuya clarifies that he is just concerned about her health. Apologizing, Hisana states she feels she has to do this before suddenly breaking into a coughing fit.

Byakuya asserts that she is not and that she needs to get some rest, but Hisana merely smiles at him and states that she must continue her search, no matter how far she pushes herself. In the present, Byakuya notes she was searching everywhere but he does not remember what she was searching for. Getting up, he pulls back a panel to reveal a bookshelf, where he pulls one of the books out and reads through it before expressing surprise at something.

When Homura asks Shizuku why he is worried because they are invincible, Shizuku admits that he believes they may have gone too far, prompting Homura to express surprise. Shizuku observes that Rukia might never remember their names because they took so much of her memory and that this would be horrible, but Homura tells him that they must make sure that Rukia never remembers what occurred on "

As Homura states that they will go, she and Shizuku vanish in a burst of dark Reiatsu.

As Suì-Fēng recognizes her, Yoruichi asks the other captains if they have not forgotten something. Ukitake wonders what this might be and Shunsui admits that he would like to know as well because this commotion is keeping him up at night and he is hoping Urahara and Yoruichi will be able to enlighten them.

When Ichigo asks him if he is referring to the two people with the large scythe, Urahara notes that Ichigo has seen them and that they had better hurry.

While Ichigo asserts that Rukia is the reason he is standing here today, Yamamoto demands that Urahara explain what happened to them. Urahara reveals that a portion of their memories has been erased and recounts how he was conducting the study of a certain Hollow shortly after establishing the SRDI that he notes was a very unusual creature because it lived parasitically in the souls of others.

   As he details how the Hollow eventually took over the consciousness of its host, Urahara notes that it moved onto another host when its current host became debilitated and reveals that it could use its sickle-shaped tentacle during the parasitic stage to shear off its host's memory. Urahara theorizes that this parasite may have come into contact with Rukia and sheared off all memories of her life as a Shinigami, causing everyone else to forget about her in the process. When a shocked Ukitake claims that this is not possible, Urahara agrees with him.

When Shunsui asks him if this could happen should a separate power join up with it to provide this strength, Urahara confirms this and states their memories are connected to each other, but those bonds can be broken if someone shears away a person's memory completely, which he reveals would cause every past event related to this person to disappear from the collective memories of the people around them.

   However, Urahara notes that there was a single exception this time, and when Hitsugaya asks him if he is referring to Ichigo, Urahara confirms this and reveals that they all forgot about Ichigo as well because his Shinigami powers originally belonged to Rukia. Yamamoto declares that a transfer of Shinigami powers is a first-class capital offense, which Urahara states is correct before asserting that it is only right for them to find a way to overlook this crime because they owe Ichigo a debt of gratitude. Urahara expresses amusement that they forgot about Ichigo out of all the people they should not forget.

   Admitting that he had forgotten about Ichigo as well, Urahara reveals that he had kept a log, which allowed him to overcome this lapse before the situation became critical. When Hitsugaya points out that there is still a problem and asks Urahara why they still have memories of Mayuri if he was attacked, Urahara notes that this is very astute of Hitsugaya and admits that this was puzzling him as well. Urahara observes that Mayuri has always been a very odd person, which led him to wonder if Mayuri had done something to protect himself against this possibility.

As the tentacles fire more streams of ooze, Rangiku notes that the monster will completely swallow the Seireitei at this rate. Calling out to her, Hitsugaya appears behind them and reveals that they are regrouping. As he asks if they are alright, which Rangiku confirms, Yamamoto, Yoruichi, Chōjirō, Suì-Fēng, Ukitake, Shunsui, and Urahara appear behind him.

Urahara concludes that the only way to stop it is to destroy this device and turns around as he reveals Ichigo and Renji are already inside.

   Thanking Ichigo, Rukia notes that it appears he has saved her once again. Ichigo tells Rukia to not forgot it was her who originally saved him and theorizes that the first time they met might not have really been the first time if death is not the end before claiming that they might have been connected from long before this. Asserting that a bond cannot disappear once it is formed, Ichigo tells Rukia that they will be connected again even if they forget everything. While wind blows around them, Ichigo states that this will be true for Rukia, Shizuku, and Homura as well.

   Rukia agrees as Ichigo notes he should head back, and when he refers to her as Shinigami, Rukia tells him to not do so before asserting that she is Rukia Kuchiki. As the wind picks up, the letter is torn from her grasp. Later, Kon calls out and asks if anyone is there. Calling for help, he asks if anyone is going to come and rescue him. As he wonders if Ichigo has forgotten about him, Kon asserts that Rukia did it and now he has as well. Cursing, he breaks free from the ooze and expresses anger at them forgetting about him.
