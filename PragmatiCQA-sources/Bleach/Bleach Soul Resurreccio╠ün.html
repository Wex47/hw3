     The health bar at the top of the screen regenerates slowly as time progresses. The more damage a player takes, the less health they can regenerate. The pressure bar regenerates quicker so long as the player is not dashing. Dashing also does mild damage. With each hit, a streak bar is refilled. The higher the streak, the higher the soul points multiplier is. 100 for a 2x multiplier, 300 for 3x multiplier and 1000 for a 4x multiplier. Getting hit does not end the streak. At the end of a level, players are given a grade and extra soul points based on the amount of points collected, difficulty played on, clear time, enemies defeated and Ignition attacks used. Once a level is over, the player can head to the level up menu and use the soul points they earned to learn new abilities and power up. The player is placed on a grid and can only buy upgrades next to ones they have already unlocked. Paths to different grids will be locked until a certain character reaches a specified level. One level equals buying one upgrade.

Ichigo is overwhelmed by his failure to stop Aizen, but Isshin encourages his son to fight on. Isshin takes Ichigo to the Precipice World and tells Ichigo that there is one last hope to defeat Aizen…the Final Getsuga Tenshō.

      Meanwhile, in Soul Society, Gin betrays Aizen, seemingly defeating the ex-captain. Unfortunately, the Hōgyoku revives Aizen, and Aizen evolves yet again. Aizen easily overcomes Gin. Suddenly, Ichigo appears in Karakura Town. Having completed his training, Ichigo vows to defeat Aizen once and for all. After seeing Ichigo's newfound strength, Gin is confident that Ichigo will win, and the ex-captain passes away. Ichigo and Aizen take their battle elsewhere, and the final fight begins.

      Upon his arrival, Aizen transforms once more into a grotesque form. Aizen converses with the Hōgyoku and “understands” that he cannot be “second” to a “mere human.” In response, Ichigo demands that the two finish their fight, and Ichigo declares that their battle will be brief. Aizen states that his new form transcends both Hollows and Soul Reapers, and that Ichigo will be the test subject for his newfound abilities. After awhile, Aizen asks the substitute Soul Reaper if he is “really Ichigo Kurosaki.” Ichigo is confused by Aizen's remarks, and Aizen clarifies himself. Aizen states that if Ichigo is who he says he is, then he is a great disappointment. Aizen further remarks that he can’t feel any of Ichigo's spiritual pressure and that Ichigo has “failed in his evolution” by wasting the “last chance” that he had given the boy in becoming stronger. In one final insult, Aizen states that he has become bored with Ichigo and that he will now die at the hands of a “transcendent” being.

      Ichigo transforms into his Final Getsuga Tenshō form to a startled Aizen. Ichigo explains that the Final Getsuga Tenshō will cost Ichigo all of his Soul Reaper powers and releases his final attack…Mugetsu. Aizen is easily overpowered and is defeated by Ichigo. Ichigo's powers finally begin to fade away and Ichigo looks towards the sky, finally bringing an end to Aizen's war.

   Mission mode allows players to take on 28 different missions in different environments with the character of their choice. Missions can range from the standard travel through the level and defeat the boss to taking out a certain amount of enemies. Missions are unlocked after defeating all the previously unlocked ones. Once unlocked, missions do not need to be played in order. Higher level missions require certain letter ranks on lower missions.
