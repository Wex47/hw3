  </h2>
  <p key="189e19e1-24a9-4dfc-8297-7a15b8ed5298">
   Aura Michibane was born from a Fullbringer father and a

   </a>
   mother. While Aura was still in the womb, her mother was attacked by a
   <a href="Hollow.html" key="551bea01-171e-48d7-a0a7-61ce143c17eb" title="Hollow">
    Hollow
   </a>
   , and though her father managed to repel the creature, her mother was gravely wounded. While she survived to give birth to Aura, the injuries resulted in her dying during the childbirth. Since then Aura's father believed it was his powers that attracted the Hollow in the first place and kept trying to rid himself of his Fullbring and feared that his daughter would suffer the same tragedies as him.
  </p>
  <p key="c95be3ca-33db-44bd-89a2-fcb5e37bcd3b">
   Around a dozen years later, Aura's father approached her with news that a
   Substitute Shinigami
   named
   <a href="Kūgo Ginjō.html" key="4c5b7fec-a742-4343-b86d-62dbfcbc80e2" title="Kūgo Ginjō">
    Kūgo Ginjō
   </a>
   was gathering all the Fullbringers he could find in order to extract the Hollow powers out of them, rendering them normal Humans. However, Aura did not understand it, and started to contemplate what it meant to be "normal". This is due to the fact that her father left her locked up in a basement for her entire life. While Aura's father did love her, he felt an obsessive need to protect all he had left from his late wife, and has isolated her completely from the outside world. All he did was teach her in basic reading, writing, and physics, and train her Fullbring powers to defend herself.
  </p>
  <p key="07edab60-d7c6-4a8d-b9af-b34eace80bc2">
   The day after her father brought the news about Ginjō, he left and never returned again. When Aura was dying from hunger in her isolation, her Fullbringer powers first manifested and tore open the walls, allowing her to escape. However, due to her lack of attachments to any item at all, she never developed a specific Fullbring. Fortunately for her, she was quickly found by the police and placed under protection.
  </p>
  <p key="76656304-f937-4818-aa81-250e1bce575a">
   Eventually, she was taken in by relatives of her late mother, the Michibane family. For several years Aura slowly integrated into the outside world, but she remained apathetic to the rest of the world due to her lack of attachment. Her father, the only person she knew and trusted growing up, was constantly slandered by people for his horrific actions.
  </p>
  <p key="5bb31e84-2f2b-4148-b03b-23776b6f604f">
   At some point in her later life, Aura was approached by a mysterious Shinigami after she killed several Hollows in self-defense. The Shinigami revealed himself as
   Tokinada Tsunayashiro
   , and the one who killed Aura's father on his family's orders.
  </p>
  <p key="903735a9-6bc5-497c-8fe8-b82b39db111c">
   When Aura revealed her apathy towards the world, Tokinada decided to recruit her for his plan to create a new world, revealing to Aura that she is the host of the
   <b key="d9624c22-df8e-43c9-ae28-f321b49e4a26">

    Soul King
   </a>
   .
   Not having any motivations or the will to offer resistance, Aura decided to ally herself with Tokinada, and from then on blindly followed his orders, starting with fighting Hollows to train her Fullbring powers.
  </p>
  <p key="32ef63f4-8ec1-49d0-ab0b-b4953b634336">
   Eventually, Aura stole the

    Tenkai Kecchu
   </i>
   prototype from Urahara on Tokinada's orders, after which the noble mass produced them and decided he needs thousands of followers. Thus, Aura formed the XCUTION cult by converting people with "miracles" she performed by using her Fullbring powers. Afterwards, Tokinada ordered her to use her powers to construct a massive, floating castle in the
   Valley of Screams
   .
  </p>
  <p key="ea7d39e4-d94b-4a0f-847f-4f22cf6b947b">
   An intrigued Aura asked Tokinada who the followers, castle, and throne were for, and the noble responded she would know soon enough. Eventually when the

   attackers. Afterwards, Tokinada put his grander plan into motion and explained to Aura that he wanted her to create
   a body
   for "the King".
  </p>
  <p key="900c936a-a7f5-43cb-b667-4986abfb7b06">
   Thus, Tokinada granted her access to the corpses of countless Shinigami, Quincy, Humans, and Fullbringers that he has collected, and told her to use them however she saw fit. He explained that she does not need to worry about the brain, as they already found
   a suitable one
   . Finally, he explained that that as long as the Saketsu and Hakusui are functional, the body can be kept alive under any circumstances.

  <p key="15865217-04f9-497e-8e3c-2419953991df">
   When Hisagi asks Aura if she is a Fullbringer like Yukio, she acknowledges this, and to Hisagi's shock addresses him by his rank while saying "Exacta"; a word that was often uttered by an opponent of his named
   Findorr Calius
   . While Aura intitially tries to use her charm and beauty to placate Hisagi, Urahara's voice snaps him out of it, causing Aura to expresses her disappointment that she failed at using her charm to avoid conflict. She then introduces herself to the two Shinigami, declaring herself a "maid for the gods who govern death".
  </p>
  <p key="898f6f84-7e53-4f4c-ab8f-28274fbedf8e">
   When Aura's cultists attack them again, Hisagi declares to Aura that he now sees her as an enemy; to which Aura merely replies that if Hisagi swears not to be an obstacle to them she will cease her attack on him at once. Hisagi proceeds to ask her why she is attacking them in the first place, but Aura reveals that this is merely a "preparation". When Hisagi inquires further, Aura mentions that Karakura Town is the greatest Jūreichi in the world. Alarmed, Hisagi asks if they are planning on forging an
   Ōken

  <p key="133ac39b-2b18-4b83-9398-8e05cf50212f">
   When a shocked Hisagi utters
   Hikone Ubuginu
   's name, Aura's calm demeanor falters and she demands to know how Hisagi knows that name. Hisagi replies by asking if Aura is a subordinate of
   Tokinada Tsunayashiro
   , which she confirms. Urahara then interrupts them and cryptically reveals  that he knows what the masked cultists actually are, to Aura's surprise. Aura asks if Urahara discovered her special abilities and he replies that he knows it is the opposite; Aura is a Fullbringer who has no special abilities.
  </p>
  <p key="7d50a8f9-5be5-4cf6-b3a7-4139f886db67">
   Aura admits surprise and intimidation that Urahara managed to discern so much about her from so little information. Urahara replies that he could not ignore the sudden rise of the XCUTION cult shortly after the Quincy war, and he already knew that Aura was the cult's leader. Aura says she expects as much from the man who created the
   Hōgyoku
   , and emphasizes they want Urahara on their side at all costs.
  </p>
  <p key="cb5b3821-cd2b-46e1-9c17-923d4717bcc3">
   When Hisagi demands to know what the Hōgyoku has to do with anything, Aura threatens to remove him by force if he keeps interfering. In response, Hisagi has his

   at Aura's throat before she can even react and threatens her instead, to her shock and admiration. Aura says that she expects as much from a Shinigami whose sense of justice is strong enough to cut down his own mentor. However, Hisagi is not baited, saying that compared to Aizen, she cannot provoke him so easily. Aura asks if Hisagi wants to join them instead, but he says that the only reason he has not killed her yet is because he wants her to lift the barrier first.
  </p>
  <p key="a6961b2e-5c43-4f12-a582-0b6956123030">
   Aura proceeds to change the subject, and confirms that she has indeed been assembling a religious organization; she says that most of their followers were not initial believers, but rather "heathens" who converted. Saying that the XCUTION cult has over seven hundred and seventy thousand followers, Aura asks Hisagi how he thinks they managed to grow so quickly in such a short time. When Hisagi does not speculate, Aura impales herself on his Zanpakutō and decapitates herself, to his shock.
  </p>
  <p key="bf7690e6-571a-453c-8ae3-fc982c775492">
   As Aura's head falls, it says that she merely preformed miracles in front of the people, before her body catches her head and reattaches it. Hisagi asks if she is a form of Hollow with

  <p key="77724120-81c7-4f14-9089-0b9e462a9bad">

   As Urahara explains, while Aura is indeed a Fullbringer, she does not possess a specific Fullbring; rather, she only has access to the generic powers all Fullbringers have, but magnified to far greater degrees, and compares Aura to a Shinigami without a Zanpakutō that can use

   Urahara asks how much Aura actually knows, to which she responds by saying they should not speak in front of the confused Hisagi, as he is still a reporter. After speaking to Hisagi, Urahara returns his attention to Aura, who uses her Fullbring to turn the moisture in the atmosphere into a giant water dragon, while simultaneously creating a dragon made out of magma. As both elemental dragons converge upon Urahara and Hisagi, Urahara casts

   Sometime later, Aura meets up with Tokinada inside the Valley of Screams, to which he explains to her what a Valley of Screams is exactly. As Tokinada muses about how the Valley of Screams was once used by the Five Families to exile the
   Ryōdoji Family
   , Aura openly wonders what Tokinada would have done had the same happened to him. When he asks Aura if she would want to make an enemy of the Gotei 13, Aura responds no, as she saw what Kisuke Urahara alone was capable of. She then proceeds to mention Hisagi's presence during the encounter, causing Tokinada to relish the chance to kill the late Kaname Tōsen's protege.

While Yukio remotely confirms that he helped Aura isolate Karakura Town, Ginjō wants to know Aura's end goal, to which Aura asks Ginjō if he still desires to get revenge on the Shinigami. When Ginjō assumes that Yukio told Aura about his past, Yukio reveals that it was the opposite - Aura came to him with information. Aura reveals to Ginjō that her father was the Fullbringer Tenshiyo Agata, and she sincerely thanks Ginjō for giving her father hope.

   While Ginjō disagrees with this statement because he blames himself for the deaths of the Fullbringers at that time, he asks Aura why she works alongside a Shinigami like Tokinada. Aura replies that Tokinada wants the Fullbringers on his side to create a new world, a world where they can be "predators" again. Before they can continue, Tsukishima takes advantage of the situation to use

   Shortly afterwards, in the throne room of the fake palace, Aura finds Hisagi present trying to find a way out; and tells him there is no way to escape by himself. When Hisagi draws his Zanpakutō and demands to know where Urahara is, Aura assures him that Urahara is completely unharmed, so Hisagi instead demands to be let out. Aura explains that only her, Hikone, and Tokinada can freely exit or enter the throne room, leading Hisagi to ask if she still plans to use the Hōgyoku to make Hikone the Soul King. While Aura only confirms that this is Tokinada's wish, Hisagi compares them to Aizen's attempt to overthrow the Soul King with the Hōgyoku. While Aura is confused for a moment, she quickly realizes that Hisagi has no idea what the Soul King truly is. Hisagi asserts that he knows enough, that
   Mimihagi
   saved the worlds after Yhwach killed the Soul King, but admits that he does doubt that truth and asks Aura if there is more he should know.

  <p key="62040e6f-512d-4c29-8bc4-c00e7c960c35">
   Aura only responds that Hikone would keep the worlds more stable than they were before, leading Hisagi to declare that he will stop Hikone even if they want to become the Soul King. Hisagi points out how Hikone is still ignorant of everything and only knows what Tokinada taught them, and asserts that he would not say anything more and would be prepared to fight Hikone if they still wished to continue after experiencing the totality of the world. Hisagi decides that he must meet Tokinada himself, both as a journalist and as a Shinigami.

   Hearing this, Aura retorts that knowing the whole world will not guarantee Hikone happiness and that some people would prefer living isolated from the outside world, but Hisagi notes that while he initially thought Hikone was like that, he knows now that the child does have their own will. In response, Aura smiles and walks towards a confused Hisagi before whispering something in his ear, before vanishing and leaving an open doorway for Hisagi to leave through.
