   Kisuke is a tall, lean man with light skin and gray eyes. His hair is messy and light-blond (almost pale), with strands framing the sides of the face and hanging between his eyes, and he has chin stubble. He wears a dark green Shihakushō without an undershirt. Over this, he wears a black haori, which sports a white diamond pattern along its bottom half, reminiscent of an inverted captain's haori. Urahara carries a fan, which he occasionally uses to hide his face. He usually wears traditional Japanese wooden sandals (

   ) and a striped dark green and white bucket hat (which usually shadows his eyes),
   which has earned him the nickname "sandal-hat" (ゲタ帽子,

   During his earlier years in Soul Society, he had a clean-shaved face and wore the standard Shinigami uniform. In his more casual events, he usually wore his geta.
   He later wore a long-sleeved captain's

   Though usually a laid-back, optimistic, jovial, humble and eccentric man, Urahara shows a deceptively cunning and serious side when the situation warrants it. He commonly uses idle conversation and outward concern to distract his opponents.
   Despite his care-free attitude, he always speaks politely, but is sometimes sarcastic.

   Approximately 110 years ago, Urahara's personality was slightly opposite of what it is in the present. During his earlier years as a captain, he was viewed as a nervous, flustered, and quiet person. Somewhat unsure of himself, he lacked confidence in his ability to be a good leader. In addition, he was occasionally confused with how to deal with his division. Despite being uncomfortable in his role, he seemed relatively at ease in his previous position at the

  <p key="62108995-9794-468a-a1a4-016ad511e150">
   Urahara can usually be found near the scene of an important event, but he rarely intervenes in situations, preferring to stay on the sidelines. He often knows more information than he lets on, and despite being a major player in the situation, he acts only as a catalyst, having others do the work for him. Urahara is often manipulative, tricking people into doing what he wants them to.

        Urahara was told of this by Yoruichi after a sparring session. After being informed, Kisuke wanted to prepare for the upcoming captain's ability test. Urahara spent the day wandering around Soul Society, interacting with the citizens as he sought information on Shinigami defectors. Returning to the 2nd Division Headquarters, as he was talking with Yoruichi,

Yoruichi told Urahara to hurry off to his duties and sent Suì-Fēng to help prepare for his captain's proficiency test. Urahara and his men proceeded to the remote area where the defectors were hiding. Urahara, telling his men to wait, entered the building by himself and single-handedly defeated all the defectors with

        After successfully passing his exam, which was overseen by Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto, Retsu Unohana and Ginrei Kuchiki,
        he became the captain of the 12th Division
        and gained Hikifune's lieutenant,
        <a href="Hiyori Sarugaki.html" key="31d3ca60-40fd-4d4c-98b6-db0378195bf8" title="Hiyori Sarugaki">
         Hiyori Sarugaki
        </a>
        , as his own. Later that day, Urahara formally introduced himself to the 12th Division. He encountered some resistance from Hiyori, who, refusing to accept him, cited her displeasure with Captain Hikifune's sudden departure and his status as a former 2nd Division member. Urahara, laughing it off, told her he had already been made the captain of the 12th Division, and that he had decided this was the role he would play from then on. He was no longer a member of the 2nd Division, and if she had a problem, it was hers to change. Hiyori proceeded to kick him in his crotch, which did not affect him at all.
        The following night, Captain

        , approached Urahara, telling him why Hiyori was giving him problems, and then gave him advice on how to best go about being a captain. He stated he could tell Urahara was not the type who does what other people tell him. Shinji explained that he felt Urahara was a type just like him, so he should just meddle in his own business.

       <p key="0739686a-cae6-4d7c-8577-8c17c8541b8a">
        At a division meeting, Urahara explained that he had decided to change the policy of the 12th Division, but had yet to determine what course of action he thought would be a good role for them. Hiyori, becoming increasingly angry upon hearing he was still thinking about it, attacked him. She challenged him to a fight, which he accepted on the condition that they fight unarmed. Hiyori tried to kick him in the face, but Urahara showed her he could evade the attack. However, he allowed her to hit him so as not to embarrass her in front of the other division members.
        The following morning, Hiyori, arriving at the captain's chamber, became enraged at how Urahara had changed the room from its former state. As he tried to calm her down, Hiyori attacked him again. Brushing it aside, he asked her to accompany him to the
        <a href="Nest of Maggots.html" key="e7672137-c998-4bf5-82e2-866c4454245a" title="Nest of Maggots">

        On the way to the Nest of Maggots, Urahara explained to her about the Detention Unit, what happens to those under its jurisdiction, and the function of the Nest of Maggots. Inside the facility, Urahara told her those detained within could not leave, but that they were still free within the facility. He warned her to be careful, as the inmates could become violent. Urahara explained that though the people in the facility were possibly dangerous, he had always felt, given a suitable outlet, they could channel their power into something more productive. When one of the inmates tried to attack Hiyori, Urahara stopped him bare-handed, noting that weapons were not permitted within the facility.
        This prompted the other inmates to attack, but Urahara easily took out all his attackers.
        Afterwards, the pair went to the cell of
        <a href="Mayuri Kurotsuchi.html" key="99604aaf-11e0-4e22-b13c-6d07a26d4951" title="Mayuri Kurotsuchi">

        Urahara explained that in his capacity as the captain of the 12th Division, he had decided to make an organization, the
        <a href="Shinigami Research and Development Institute.html" key="2d2cce3a-0c17-4be7-9e89-a8c7276ab8eb" title="Shinigami Research and Development Institute">

        Nine years later, Urahara was told by Shinji and Lieutenant

        was investigating.
        Urahara later set about making a new type of Gigai to stabilize the disappearing souls. When explaining this to Hiyori, they were interrupted by the arrival of
        Tōdō Izaemon
        , who relayed Captain

        Later that night, when he hears that the

        They arrived just in time to stop Aizen from killing Captain Hirako.
        Urahara questioned Aizen about what he was doing there, rejecting his initial explanation. Urahara noted there were no injuries on the victims, and that they were infected with "

        After Aizen and his followers got away, the duo tended to Shinji and the rest of the victims, who were deep in the process of Hollowfication. Urahara said he could possibly help them at his lab, so Tessai used a forbidden Kidō to transport them there. In his lab, Urahara tried to reverse the process using an item he had created, the "

        secret underground area
        . There, she berated him for keeping her out of the loop, then explained that she had brought the

He then said that to save Masaki, Isshin must enter a Gigai that would attach his soul to Masaki's. In doing so, Isshin would be unable to return to his Shinigami form so long as Masaki was alive. Isshin quickly agreed to this solution, which surprised Urahara and Ryūken. After listening to Isshin's resolve, Urahara began working on the solution.
        Ultimately, the operation was a success. Later, Kisuke helped Isshin establish his new life in the Human World.

Rukia, snatching Kon back, says he is not defective and she is happy with the merchandise. Urahara states that they will deny any involvement or affiliation if there is any trouble with Kon.

   Urahara eventually decides to have Renji train him, saying his Bankai is not fit for training or lending power to others. Urahara, observing their training, muses on how fighting against a Bankai will increase Chad's powers, and expresses concern about the nature of Chad's powers.

He asks her to stay out of the upcoming battle because, with Tsubaki having been destroyed by Yammy, she has no means of attack, and thus should not participate in the battle. Chad disagrees, saying she helped in Soul Society and her healing and defensive abilities are more important than attacking. Urahara reminds him that Orihime is still a Human, and that the 4th Division will be on the front line, as they possess both healing and combat abilities.

Urahara, glaring down at Aizen, admits it is true that he was unable to master it in the past. Aizen tries to attack him, but Urahara, using a portable Gigai as a decoy, uses the opportunity to bind Aizen with multiple Kidō spells. Urahara attacks with "

        Aizen tells Urahara there is no need for him to be on guard, as the Hōgyoku is strengthening his abilities. Urahara states he was not talking about dodging the Kidō, but rather that in the past, Aizen would have never come into physical contact with him twice without a plan. Urahara reveals he placed seals on Aizen to block off the Reiatsu vents which all Shinigami have in their wrists. As Aizen is enveloped in a column of light, Urahara tells him he will be incinerated by his own Reiatsu from the inside out.
        However, Aizen emerges unscathed and further transformed, commenting that Urahara used a level-90 Kidō as a decoy while placing the seal. Aizen states the Hōgyoku Urahara created was beyond his comprehension. Urahara attacks Aizen as Isshin comes at him from behind, but he easily blocks both of their attacks. However, this is revealed to be yet another trap, as Urahara and Isshin have entangled Aizen, forcing him into an awkward position. As Aizen demands to know what is going on,

        After Urahara and Yoruichi get into two minor playful arguments about the quality of the armor, Aizen states it is all part of Urahara's plan. Urahara replies that he thought Aizen was no longer cautious, but Aizen counters, saying it is just observation, as Urahara is the only being within

Urahara reveals it is a seal developed specifically for Aizen, as he figured that if he fused with the Hōgyoku, it would most likely become all, but impossible to kill him. As the seal begins to take hold and the power Aizen obtained from the Hōgyoku begins to fade, Urahara states Aizen's loss of power is the will of the Hōgyoku.

        Later, Ichigo asks Urahara where everyone went, to which Urahara replies that they went home. He further states it seems as though they wanted to speak with him, but coming over and talking to him seemed like an equally difficult task to all of them. Ichigo asks him if he wiped their memories, but Urahara tells him he did not this time. Urahara reveals Aizen's seal structure was transported to Seireitei, and the details of his disposal will be immediately decided by the Central 46 Chambers. Ichigo gets a solemn look on his face, prompting Urahara to ask why. Ichigo states he does not really know himself, causing Urahara to remind him he risked his life protecting the world and everyone's lives, and defeated Aizen. He further states that Ichigo did the right thing. Ichigo recounts his thoughts about Aizen to Urahara.
        After Ichigo collapses, Urahara explains the loss of Ichigo's Shinigami powers to Rukia.

     Later, Inaba captures Nozomi and destroys Ichigo's remaining powers. After Urahara treats Ichigo's wounds, everyone gathers at his shop to discuss their next move. Uryū wonders why Inaba repeatedly tried to kill Ichigo first. Kisuke explains that it is probably because Inaba cannot create a Reigai of a being with Hollow powers, and thus found Ichigo to be a dangerous variable. Kisuke theorizes about how to restore Ichigo's powers. He states that by acquiring the remaining Reishi of Ichigo still in the Kōtotsu, they can use it and the Reigai technology at the SRDI to help Ichigo. Since Ichigo is currently without Reiatsu, he will be able to move freely in the Dangai, making him the only one who can get the Reishi. Kisuke, giving him a Reishi collector, puts Ichigo into the Dangai. Ichigo later emerges unharmed with the Reishi he collected.

     Kisuke asks the others to enter the Dangai first as decoys while Kisuke, Ichigo, and Kon take an alternate entrance, as Kisuke's Reiatsu-concealing cloak and Ichigo's lack of Reiatsu will allow them to move undetected. Successfully infiltrating the SRDI, they set to work restoring Ichigo's powers. Urahara notes he will not be able to restore Ichigo's Hollow powers, and since he is not a Reigai, it may create a strain on Ichigo's soul. Before the process is completed, the system begins to self-destruct. Ichigo, swallowing the Mod-Soul, partly restores his Reiatsu. However, Kisuke notes the process is unstable, causing Ichigo's inner Hollow to begin going wild. Kisuke is certain Inaba has a back-up facility elsewhere which they can use to stabilize Ichigo. With the aid of Yoruichi and the captains, they escape the SRDI as it is surrounded by the Reigai.
     As they search for Inaba's facility, Kisuke decides Ichigo must stay behind, due to his inner turmoil, and binds him with a "

After she answers, he tells her to let him know if anything were to happen, and he will prepare "something".

Isshin says he is getting annoying, asking how many times Urahara needs to ask that. Urahara replies it is a matter of whether or not a parent robs his son of his future, so it is common sense to confirm it several times. Isshin says he knows and he is sure. Urahara says they will make their final move, and an unidentified figure, stepping forth, tells Urahara to do it.

Mayuri then tells Urahara that he suspects that the grudge the Quincy carry towards the Hollows isn't due to tradition, but due to primordial fear of something that threatens their lives, which Urahara confirms. He then explains that everything regarding a Hollow is like poison to a Quincy, and that if they are eroded by a Hollow, their own souls would be destroyed, and as such, a Quincy would not be able to survive Hollowfication. Additionally, Urahara explains that the Shin'eiyaku will briefly Hollowfy a Shinigami's Bankai, causing it to become poison towards a Quincy.

Without this invention, achieving Bankai takes at least ten years, plus the many years of combat experience needed.

   : Urahara has proven himself to be the most intelligent being both within and outside of Soul Society. Much of his intellect is seen in scientific inventions, deduction of situations, and combat tactics. Aizen himself acknowledges that Urahara's intelligence surpasses his own immense intellect.
   Even after a century of exile, the SRDI still holds great respect for his talents.
   He is very insightful of other people, allowing him to see through a person's demeanor and determine what they are thinking.
   Also able to read well into the situation, he can seemingly predict anything well in advance. After Orihime inadvertently revealed her powers to Ulquiorra, Urahara correctly deduced Aizen would try to capture Orihime to use her against Soul Society, and had already prepared to send Ichigo to Hueco Mundo before he even had a chance to ask.
   Kisuke is a highly capable teacher. In only five days of unorthodox training, he conditioned Ichigo into an experienced fighter on par with lieutenant-level Shinigami.
   His knowledge has given him an innate understanding of the abilities of others and what happens when independent variables are entered into an equation. It was for this reason why Kisuke was chosen as one of the

     Master Scientist &amp; Inventor
    </b>
    : As the founder and former head of the SRDI, Urahara is a talented inventor and scientist, having created a number of devices and techniques to aid him in battle or otherwise. His intellect in this field is evident, having created the most amazing things in Soul Society's history. As he has been inventing and creating things before becoming a seated officer in the 2nd Division, he can create his inventions in rather short amounts of time.
    He modified a simple plushy doll into a two-way monitor to speak between dimensions, greatly intriguing Kurotsuchi.
    Urahara figured out how to restore Ichigo's Shinigami powers seventeen months after losing them.
    He is even able to determine the true mechanics behind a new advanced power and how to disrupt it, even the ability of the Quincy to steal one's Bankai.
    He is a highly adept chemist, having recreated the unique healing properties of both the "White Bone Pond" and "Blood Hell Pond" in his own hot spring.
    Urahara also has highly capable medical skills, regularly healing Ichigo and his friends when battle-worn.
    He also has a very detailed understanding of the Hollowfication process and has determined how to stabilize a victim of it, as seen with the

    : Despite his aloof and unkempt appearance, Urahara is a very insightful and cunning man. He possesses great intuition, quickly becoming aware of any incoming danger and reacting to it in time.
    Urahara has an undeniable talent for thinking things through well in advance, making decisive and accurate decisions quickly in battle, and seemingly perceiving any situation at hand. He is a crafty tactician, easily deceiving both allies and enemies. In battle, he regularly uses cunning and deception to catch his opponents off-guard.
    He is a very analytical man, quickly seeing through an opponent's power and attack patterns to ultimately make them useless against him. He easily outmaneuvered and tricked Aizen repeatedly in his fight with him.
    Urahara stated that he goes into situations expecting many possible scenarios just so he is never caught by surprise and making it possible for him to be ready for any that might occur.

   : As a former member of the Onmitsukidō, he received considerable physical conditioning. During his time as commander of the Detention Unit, he effortlessly stopped a punch from a giant man with a single hand.
   He stopped a kick from the immensely strong Ururu, blocking most of the impact which would have otherwise killed Ichigo.
   During his training with Ichigo, his strikes possessed enough power to create large craters and launch the younger fighter several meters through solid rock.

   : While normally laid-back, Kisuke is an immensely agile fighter. In battle, he can effectively use the battlefield to his advantage, flipping and jumping from wall to wall to keep his opponents unsure of his attack patterns. Offensively, his agility grants him great balance and dexterity in battle, attacking his opponent from various angles with great accuracy and force.

He can take large amounts of punishment. His durability caused Hiyori to be more careful about how she would hit him if she did not want to hurt herself instead.

   : During his time as a captain, he would regularly be assaulted by his then-lieutenant Hiyori Sarugaki. Each time, he would take the assaults indifferently, if not laugh about it, with little to no adverse effect on himself. Against Askin's "The Deathdealing", despite showing great exhaustion from the Quincy's poisonous power, Kisuke was still able to move about with considerable agility, surprising Askin.

He can completely hide his presence, remaining undetected until he intentionally reveals himself.
   During his battle against Yammy, he repeatedly caught his opponent completely off guard and effectively took advantage of it.
   Even the perceptive and intuitive Aizen was caught by surprise.

   (a blade hidden inside a cane) with a curved handle and silver base. As the blade resides in a cane, the cane's handle is still the hilt and the shaft is the sheath, allowing it to still operate like other Zanpakutō.
   The shaft's base bears a skull and blue flame mark on the bottom, which can separate souls from bodies by pressing the mark to it.
   Back when Urahara was still in the Gotei 13, Benihime was sealed in an average-sized katana form, with a black sheath worn under Urahara's sash. It had an oval-shaped tsuba, with a snowflake-design embossed in it, and a black hilt-wrapping.

    "). Its Shikai takes the form of a sleek, medium-sized sword. The hilt's grip, which has a gentle black-decorative wrapping, bends forward at the end, with a pommel shaped overlap three times, and a crimson tassel dangling from its base. Instead of a tsuba, there is a U-shape guard covering three inches of the blade, with a flower petal design. At the base of the guard is a red string wrapped thrice around the hilt, with a three-loop bow on the back side and a folded paper decoration on the front side. The blades' hamon is straight, colored black with a silver edge, and is somewhat thicker than the cane-sealed state. It remains straight and slim with a somewhat short size, with the tip ending in a slanted razor-like edge instead of tapering to a point.
