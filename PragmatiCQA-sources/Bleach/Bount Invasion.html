Past the doorway, the group finds themselves in a tiled room that seems to repeat indefinitely in each of the four directions visible through its doorways, forming a labyrinth. After his suggestion of escaping by returning to the main hall through right turns fails due to another room being there when they arrive, Uryū deduces they will have to solve some sort of puzzle in order to escape as the group enters a room without any lights on.

That night, Koga finishes healing the wound left by Kariya and moves out to track him down, only to encounter a squad of Tenth Division Shinigami and incapacitate them all with

Thanking Koga for not killing his subordinates, Hitsugaya begins battling

   defeats him with a single slash across the torso

   After returning to his division's barracks and requesting that his subordinates find Koga's body in order to give it a proper burial, Hitsugaya discovers Ichigo's group in his office, having brought Uryū there to be healed. Though Uryū wishes to return to the fight as soon as possible, his friends convince him to rest for the night while the others search for the Bount. In the First Division barracks, Yamamoto is informed by 8th Division Lieutenant

   in an attempt to kill him, exposing the Bount crest on his body. An astonished Ran'Tao realizes that Kariya is Eugene Currier, the Bount she gave a special amulet to awaken his powers when he was a young boy during the massacre of his tribe at the hands of the Shinigami, and attempts to convince him that the modern Gotei 13 does not remember the days of the Bount enough to continue oppressing them. However, Kariya refuses to even consider forgiving the Shinigami for the suffering he has endured and decides to kill Ran'Tao here and now for her role in it.

   Despite his desire to kill Ran'Tao, Kariya suddenly remembers his past as a Bount, where he inadvertently awakened his Bount powers during a Hollow attack and had his proposal to abandon Soul Society and the Shinigami rejected by his tribe, causing him to grow bitter and hateful toward the weaker Bount who perished over the years and formulate a plan to take revenge on the Seireitei with the Bount strong enough to stand by his side. Before he can kill Ran'Tao, Kariya is attacked by Uryū, who reveals his battle with Yoshi showed him how to use the

   Uryū proceeds to demonstrate his new level of control by rapidly attacking Kariya to the point of overwhelming his defense and wounding him several times, only for Kariya to heal himself with Reishi and exploit the growing instability of Uryū's attacks to brutally injure him. Suddenly, Ran'Tao uses a second Bount amulet to temporarily channel the power of the

   Back on Sōkyoku Hill, upon being told all of the other Bount are dead, Ichinose holds his Zanpakutō to Kariya's neck and reveals his fight with Kenpachi has changed his perspective on seeking revenge against the Shinigami now that he has remembered the ideals which he and Kiganjō once strove for.

Upon being asked by Ichigo why he intends to destroy everything, Kariya reveals his hatred of the Bount for letting the great power they were born with go to waste and of the Shinigami for exploiting his tribe, which has led him to desire to drag everything down with him.

Despite barely being able to move, Ichigo is saved from Kariya's lightning strike by Ichinose's Zanpakutō, which acts as a lightning rod and disintegrates in the process.

As Koga learns he has been saved by Ran'Tao so he can share the story of the last Bount with her, Ichigo muses on Kariya's power consuming him in the end and discusses the latter's desire to break the vicious cycle of history through force with Ukitake.
