   Baraggan has the appearance of an elderly man, with a left olive green eye, a white mustache and white hair. His face is lined by large scars on the left side of his chin that goes down to his neck and across his right eye. Despite his aged appearance, Baraggan is quite stocky and muscular, and when standing (albeit with the slouch of an elderly person), he is of a fair size. He wears a regal white leather coat with black fur lining, short sleeves, and three black fur stripes running along the bottom. He wears a golden wristband on both wrists, and a belt consisting of three thick chains attached to a large metal disk with a sun emblem. Overall, he resembles a barbarian lord (of
   Viking
   origin). The remnants of his Hollow mask take the form of a five-pointed crown just above his forehead.
   The location of his Espada tattoo is unknown. His Hollow hole is in the center of his chest.

   As the

   He states everything which can exist for a lifetime cannot exist forever: even the word "forever" is meaningless, for it was born out of the fear of death.
   This philosophy makes Baraggan quite merciless against his enemies, which he refers to as "

   "
   that he could rot the flesh from their bodies.
   Despite all of Baraggan's bragging,
   Hachigen Ushōda
   suggests that Baraggan is simply another life form that fears old age and tried to escape it; Baraggan himself claimed that he will never die.

  <p key="d2dc9534-1b29-4205-91d5-5a7bfddb1e7a">
   For all his pride and power, Baraggan is easily enraged when he is outmatched or injured. Whenever this happens, he flies into a blind rage, and starts cursing at his opponents.
   He will go completely all out in trying to attack the offender and anyone else in the way, even against all odds.
   Baraggan has held a grudge against Aizen (whom he begrudgingly refers to as "

   Tōsen states that it was interesting that Baraggan called a place without walls or a ceiling a palace, asking if it was a joke on his part. Baraggan replied that he had no need for a ceiling, for he was a king, and that the very sky of Hueco Mundo was the roof of his palace. Unsheathing his

He went on, asking if Baraggan ever felt that this place was not where he should be. Aizen then stated that if he wanted to rise even higher, then he would aid Baraggan if he followed him. When he claimed if he did so, he would give him more power and a new world, Baraggan laughed at the notion, declaring that he was the King of Hueco Mundo, and that there was no one higher than him and no new world for him. Baraggan, no longer amused by the intruders, ordered his army to crush them all. However, Aizen released his

   Choe Neng Poww
   ,
   Ggio Vega

   Abirama Redder
   pull out a throne for him to sit upon, he decides to take control of the situation himself, and tells Starrk he had better not have a problem with this. As Starrk allows Baraggan to take over, Baraggan details how the town under them is a fake created as a replica by

   Noticing his opponents are tired from their last battle, Baraggan notes how they have not budged him. When Ōmaeda says to release the limiters, Suì-Fēng tells him they are already at full strength.
   Baraggan takes out his Zanpakutō and swings; Suì-Fēng notes how she can barely dodge the attack. Revealing the Espada's aspects of death and how he represents old age, Baraggan, demonstrating his ability, touches her left arm, causing the bones to break. As this noticeably shocks her, Baraggan releases his Zanpakutō.
   As Baraggan walks towards them in his released form, Suì-Fēng realizes that each step he takes on the roof causes it to rot and crumble. As she screams at Ōmaeda to run, Baraggan activates

   Baraggan then rushes at Ōmaeda, prompting him to run for his life.

   barrier
   to ensnare Baraggan. Stating he has seen what Baraggan can do, which is why he came to

Hachi deduces if Baraggan is in a place where he cannot escape the explosion, his powers will not be fast enough to divert the force of the attack away from him. As the pinwheel section of the barrier partially opens, Suì-Fēng, inserting

Pointing at Baraggan, who asks what he is doing, Hachi states he gave it to him. As Baraggan's chest glows, he asks what is happening, prompting Hachi to explain how Baraggan stated only his power is absolute. As the barrier placed in Baraggan's stomach is revealed, it, beginning to dissipate, reveals Hachi's deteriorating right arm, which was held inside it. Beginning to deteriorate extremely fast, Baraggan realizes Hachi, having cut off his arm inside a barrier, transferred it to his stomach. Hachi states that if Baraggan's power is truly absolute, then even he cannot stand against it. Hachi notes it was only a guess, and he is glad he was not wrong. As Baraggan becomes infuriated at this, Hachi states that in Soul Society, there are no gods other than the Shinigami, the Gods of Death, so anyone who is not a Shinigami cannot understand the seriousness of his words. As Hachi asks for Baraggan's pardon for their lack of belief, Baraggan disintegrates even further, with almost the entirety of his body destroyed.

The battle axe has a pair of rounded blades that are black with silver edges. There is a red slit-eye pendant in the middle of the focal point holding both blades together. The focal point is attached to a long handle, which has 3 white raised studs in a row on all four sides of its base for a total of 12 studs. The end of the handle is wrapped in a gold. During the battle in the fake Karakura Town, he initially kept it hidden in his throne.

Afterwards, Baraggan's body becomes draped in a purple cloak, with a pitch-black tattered fur collar around his neck area and the fringes of his cloak, which gives him a macabre appearance strongly reminiscent of a

    . Several lengths of golden chain, originally worn like a belt around his waist, now dangle out of his armbands. The eye from his Zanpakutō is now worn at the center of his chest near his neck as an elegant pendant. The sandals of his uniform become white, pointed-toe boots. His crown-like mask fragment turns into a full, extravagantly decorated, bejeweled crown, with a chain running downward on the left side. He retains the scar present on his right eye from his previous form, visible now as an apparent crack in the same location.

The ten different paths that can lead a human to death. This is reflected in their individual abilities, their ideologies, and forms the basis of their existence. Isolation. Sacrifice. Emptiness. Despair. Destruction. Intoxication. Insanity. Avarice. Rage. And the form of death over which I hold dominion is 'age'. 'Age', that is to say, 'time'. The greatest, and most absolute form. The death that inevitably awaits all things.

     Insects, insects, insects! Shinigami, humans, Hollows, Arrancar, all of their differences and strife, will, freedom, beasts, plants, the moon and stars and sun - all of it is meaningless! There is but one absolute in this world, and that is my power! Everything outside of that is as tiny and meaningless as an insect! It is only natural for I, wielder of the ultimate power over all, to hold dominion over the world!! Among a number of competing powers, equality can never be found. But observe! In these hollow eyes of mine, the lives you bear are no greater than those of mere ants!

     How tedious this all is. There is nothing more meaningless than an army with no enemy to fend off. Do you not agree? My subjects. Though, little point asking when none of you would dare but concur.
