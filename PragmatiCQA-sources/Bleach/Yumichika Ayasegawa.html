This is connected to an orange sleeve on his right arm under the much looser fitting sleeve of the uniform. Yumichika has colorful feathers on his right eyelashes and eyebrow. He has shiny skin, purple eyes,

After a speech given to them by Kenpachi about surviving a battle and living to kill the one who failed to kill them, Yumichika brought the news to the still recovering Ikkaku. He had heard of Kenpachi becoming a captain and the two decided to join the 11th Division to serve under him. Both of them would prove themselves to Kenpachi and eventually became seated officers, Yumichika choosing the 5th seat as he found the number four to be an unattractive number and Ikkaku had already taken the third.

   Ikkaku comments on Kenpachi's fight with Ichigo, to which Yumichika states that their captain is on the losing side. Angered by this, Ikkaku scolds Yumichika by saying that Zaraki is the strongest captain in the Gotei 13 and that is why he follows him, also stating that Zaraki could never lose.

     Renji decides to fight Gesell on his own, insisting that both Ichigo and Yumichika stay out of the battle. Ichigo shows numerous protests even during the battle, but Yumichika reveals to him that Renji used to belong to the 11th Division; and most members of the 11th Division fight to the death on their own, Renji being no exception (even after he was transferred). After Renji defeats the Doll, he can no longer continue. Yumichika urges Ichigo to continue on, telling him that he would look after Renji, so he wouldn't have to worry about him.

   The noise interrupts Hitsugaya and Ikkaku, who are also trying to talk to their swords, so Hitsugaya yells at them to be quiet, saying that he'll kick them back to Soul Society if they don't.

   He later corrects himself after releasing his Zanpakutō, saying that it is really 4-on-8, referring to eight limbs created by his Resurrección. From that point on, Captain Hitsugaya takes over the battle with Luppi.

     Yumichika, along with all other Shinigami who had learned their Zanpakutō's name, is called to Sōkyoku Hill under the belief that Captain-Commander
     Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
     called them. This is proven to be a trap set up by a rogue Zanpakutō Spirit named
     Muramasa
     , who called them and had captured and sealed Yamamoto. To make matters worse, Muramasa somehow "frees" all the Zanpakutō Spirits from their spiritual bond with their Shinigami partners.

     Yumichika is among the Shinigami that arrive at the 6th Division Barracks to surround some of the rogue Zanpakutō Spirits and Captain
     Byakuya Kuchiki
     . He then lures away his Zanpakutō Spirit,
     Ruri'iro Kujaku
     , to a secluded place so that no one sees the true power of Ruri'iro Kujaku. He and Ruri'iro Kujaku talk, with Ruri'iro Kujaku complementing Yumichika on his looks. This annoys Yumichika, who proceeds to provoke Ruri'iro Kujaku by calling him Fuji Kujaku. They prepare to fight each other with Ruri'iro Kujaku swearing to kill Yumichika for calling him Fuji Kujaku.

     Yumichika is left in a bad condition by their battle, with a triumphant Ruri'iro Kujaku smirking nearby. After remarking that he is unafraid to use his true power, the Zanpakutō prepares to unleash his Shikai. Yumichika panics, still more afraid to be kicked out of the 11th squad than to die; even after he is caught by the Ruri'iro Kujaku's Shikai, he stubbornly calls his Zanpakutō Fuji Kujaku. As Ruri'iro Kujaku's power continues to drain away Yumichika's energy, he mocks Yumichika by calling him a coward, saying he claims to value his self-perceived vision of beauty and expresses it to all, yet he hides his true power from the others in fear of being ridiculed.

     After using some improvised Kidō to escape, Yumichika tricks Ruri'iro Kujaku by playing on his ego to use his powers again, finding an opening to counter and win. Before striking down his Zanpakutō, Yumichika explains that despite his reluctance to show his true powers to others, he chooses to do this not out of fear of ridicule, but because he has true pride as a member of the 11th Division. After winning the fight, Yumichika faints from having lost so much energy from Ruri'iro Kujaku's power. He is later found by the 4th Division and treated.
     After recovering, Yumichika goes to the Human World with several Shinigami, ready to face Muramasa.

At Ichigo's house, Yumichika, Renji and Ikkaku tell Ichigo that they wish to question her. Ichigo asks them if it is not enough that he protects her. Yumichika tells Ichigo that the Gotei 13 captains were defeated by Inaba's invasion force and Ikkaku says that they will now have to face that army in Karakura Town. Yumichika remarks that it is ironic that the Modified Souls were meant to reduce Shinigami casualties, but now many Shinigami have been injured protecting Nozomi. Ichigo tells them that as long as someone is born into the world, they have a right to continue existing.

     Yumichika participates in a meeting with the Shinigami and Ichigo's friends where they are updated about the situation. Nozomi states that her Zanpakutō can counter Inaba's abilities, but Yumichika notes that she does not sound certain. He asks her what power she has. Later, while Nozomi is training, Yumichika arrives and thanks Ikkaku for waiting. He asks him if something is wrong and if he is interested in joining Nozomi's training. Ikkaku denies this, saying that he is worried about when the Reigai will arrive. When the Reigai of Kenpachi arrives in the Human World and begins to fight Ikkaku, Yumichika warns the others not to waste time, as Ikkaku is delaying the enemy for them. Yumichika asks them how much longer they will fight like that, suggesting that he hit her with a much stronger amount of Reiatsu. Yumichika tells Ichigo that they are both unintentionally holding back and instructs him to attack her with real power, filled with killing intent.
     After his suggested proves correct, allowing Nozomi to awaken her Shikai, Yumichika goes off to find Ikkaku. He finds Ikkaku defeated saved by Nozomi, having used the accumulated energy in her "

Yumichika then engages the Reigai so Ikkaku can be taken away to be healed. He is quickly driven back to join his allies and ultimately struck down by Reigai-Kenpachi.
     With the arrival of Captain Unohana, Yumichika and the others are taken to the Shinigami's temporary base where she treats them. However, she states Yumichika's condition is very uncertain.

     Soon, the Reigai corner the Shinigami. Byakuya then realizes that based off Inaba's own personal nature, the Reigai share the same trait of self-preservation and will not attack first in fear of being outnumbered. Hearing this, Ikkaku and Yumichika join Kenpachi, having resolved long ago to die by his side regardless.

They both notice that the footprints are either bare foot or sandals. Yumichika concludes a Hollow is not responsible, while Ikkaku orders they continue searching for clues.

   When Ikkaku tells the Sternritter to die if they want the Shinigami to leave, Yumichika notes this does not make much sense.
   After all of the combatants are separated by a massive explosion, Yumichika and Ikkaku confront

   Yumichika and Ikkaku are forced to flee from Bambietta's exploding abilities. Ikkaku wonders if she will run out of bombs soon but Yumichika surmises that they are not bombs but the spheres cause other things to explode when they touch them. Thus, they cannot deflect the spheres as usual as their weapons would then explode. Ikkaku decides to evade the spheres and slash the zombified Bambietta herself. Yumichika backs Ikkaku up by using

   Daichi Tenyō
   to levitate rocks around them and fling them into the oncoming spheres thus clearing the way for Ikkaku, who stabs Bambietta. Despite this attack, Bambietta touches Ikkaku's face but Yumichika quickly slices her arm off before she can cause him to explode. Giselle picks up the arm, informing them that attacking Bambietta is pointless since she is already dead just as the zombie causes the area around Yumichika and Ikkaku to explode, injuring them. Giselle laments that having to kill Bambietta caused her to get aroused but Yumichika again insists she is a male. In response, Giselle bites her finger, so that blood pours out, and prepares to turn Ikkaku and Yumichika into zombies but, upon hearing about her abilities,
   Mayuri Kurotsuchi

   As Mayuri brings out four zombified Arrancar in response to this, Yumichika recognizes
   Charlotte Chuhlhourne
   among them and is riled up by the latter proclaiming he does not remember the names of ugly people.
   When the Arrancar begin attacking the zombified Shinigami, a shocked Yumichika notes that most of them are 11th Division, only for Mayuri to state how those who go against the Seireitei must die before pointing out how those are

   Alongside his captain, Ikkaku and Hanatarō, Yumichika follows Mayuri and Nemu through the gate whenever they close it and reopen it in a location separate from the rest of the active members of the Gotei 13. While Hanatarō nervously cries about being left to travel with the two captains and their entourage, Yumichika wonders how much longer Kenpachi plans to continue arguing with Mayuri and Ikkaku suggests they should move out without them.
   After Kenpachi recklessly attacks
   Pernida Parnkgjas
   , resulting in a mangled arm, Ikkaku laments that they had lost their chance to jump in on the fight. In response to this, Yumichika yells at Ikkaku, insulting his intelligence before reminding the 3rd Seat that the last thing they want to do is cause the two captains to get mad at them for doing something wrong and Nemu agrees with him. He watches, speechless, as Pernida proceeds to twist Kenpachi's arm, forcing him to rip it off as it folds into nothing but a pool of blood.
   To prevent himself from going deaf, he covers his ears, with Nemu's advice, when Mayuri uses

   When Mayuri gives Pernida a new name as a test specimen, Ikkaku worriedly wonders if Mayuri really said that, which Yumichika grimly affirms. Yumichika reacts in shock as Pernida uses its nerves to inhabit the ground, and as Mayuri is sent falling to the ground, Yumichika warns him to not touch the ground as Pernida's nerves are there.

   After Mayuri defeats Pernida, Ikkaku and Yumichika return and help him release the de-zombified Hitsugaya and Rangiku from the containers they were in before placing Mayuri in one of the containers. After placing Kenpachi in the other one, Ikkaku and Yumichika promise to come back for him soon before thanking Mayuri and leaving.

     I'm a member of the Eleventh Division - the Gotei 13's specialized combat division. It's full of idiots obsessed with putting their lives on the line. Thanks to the style of our Division, there's always been a kind of unwritten rule that all our Zanpakutō have to be direct-combat types. Just having a Kidō-type Zanpakutō is enough to get a guy labelled a coward. I don't want any of my fellows in the Eleventh Division to see this Zanpakutō's ability. Especially not Ikkaku or my captain. That's why I had to thank you when you concealed us within the barrier. If you had not used that technique, then no matter what happened in this battle, I would never have released my Zanpakutō. Even if I were to lose and die at your hands.
