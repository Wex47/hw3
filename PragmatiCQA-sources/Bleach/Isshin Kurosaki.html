   Isshin is a tall, muscular man with spiky black hair and brown eyes. He has thin facial hair around his mouth and on his cheeks. As a doctor, Isshin usually wears a white lab coat over his otherwise more casual shirt and trousers. He has the appearance of a man in forties, as noted by his daughter, Karin.

   Isshin typically acts in a goofy, energetic, and fun-loving manner. Loud voice, big smile and a wide range of facial expressions are his trademark features. He's prone to attack his son all of a sudden for every reason, from being late for a dinner to simply waking him up. Like he claims, it was all to make Ichigo stronger, which actually paid off.
   Sometimes Isshin can be the life and the soul of the party such as during the festival in
   <a href="Karakura Town.html" key="d6420c1a-8afa-4379-a62c-7447208251e5" title="Karakura Town">

   During his time in
   Gotei 13
   Isshin was a lazy and carefree captain who often tried to make his subordinates do his work for him. For this reason he was on bad terms with

   who was often forced to call him back to order. Isshin was delighted seeing how diligent
   Tōshirō Hitsugaya
   was doing all the paperwork and, on the spur of the moment, saw the future of his division in him.
  </p>
  <p key="3bd205a2-8973-4d89-9478-bf858a8ce12c">
   Isshin also has a perverted and lecherous side. He commented on how Rangiku's boobs were shining from sweat and pointed out to Ichigo that his sisters, who were piggybacked by him, weren't wearing underwear.
   However, when he encountered a naked Masaki, he blushed and demanded her to not act casually while looking like that.

        One day, about twenty years ago,
        Hitsugaya reported the death of a Shinigami in
        Naruki City
        two months ago, and Isshin expressed knowledge of the incident, fully aware the
        Gotei 13
        was already investigating the incident. When Hitsugaya further reported two more individuals had died within the past month alone, Isshin, concerned with the disappearances, decided to investigate them alone, knowing Rangiku and Hitsugaya were not strong enough to assist him.

        Making his arrival known to his division members, Isshin sent them away so he could take care of the mission himself.
        As Isshin patrolled the area waiting for any sign of danger, he felt the presence of something. Witnessing it killing the members of his division he had previously told to leave, he came
        face to face

        Cero
        between its horns. Stating it cannot be a Hollow, as that is not how a Menos fights, Isshin, lunging at the creature, asked it who was pulling the strings to prevent Soul Society from knowing of its existence. Stating he does not care, Isshin released his

        someone
        interrupted the fight. Watching on, Isshin stated the Hollow's new opponent was an "

        Watching as the girl defeated the Hollow, he saved her when it began to self-destruct. Afterwards, he and Masaki introduced themselves, with Isshin taking a liking to Masaki. Later, he returned to Soul Society to report to
        Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
        about what happened. Though Yamamoto overlooked his violation of rules because he kept the damage and casualties to a minimum, Yamamoto suspected Isshin was hiding something, which Isshin denied.

        After saving her, Isshin was forced to remain in the Human World. With Urahara's help, he was able to properly adjust to this new world and ultimately open his clinic.

As the two argue about being able to see spirits, Karin interrupts. As Isshin uses the opportunity to pin Ichigo to the ground, Ichigo, shrugging him off, goes up to his bedroom. While Karin blames Isshin, Yuzu explains how Ichigo has been seeing more ghosts lately. Surprised that Ichigo talks about such things to her, Isshin talks about how Ichigo does not tell him any of his troubles, prompting Karin to say that even she would not talk about her problems with a father who is over forty but has child-like communication skills. Turning to the poster of Masaki on the wall, Isshin, saying their daughters are very cold towards him, blames adolescence.

When he sends Ichigo to find the girls, Ichigo refuses and says it is tiring and he should go himself. Isshin grabs Ichigo and asks if his little sisters are not precious to him. He decides that they should split up to search for them. Telling Ichigo to search in one direction, he says he will stay there, prompting Ichigo to kick him.

As a result, he smokes at her graveside every year on the anniversary of her death.
        Isshin tells Ichigo not to look so sad. When Ichigo asks why nobody blames him for Masaki's death, Isshin, asking why he would blame Ichigo, says if he blamed her death on him, Masaki would become mad at him.

        After Aizen's defeat of the Shinigami captains, Aizen begins to reveal to Ichigo everything he knows about him. He is interrupted by Isshin, who, appearing with his Zanpakutō drawn on the battlefield between his son and Aizen, states Aizen "

        As Ichigo calls out to him, Isshin, turning to his son,
        headbutts
        him with enough force to send him flying over to a building, where he, almost falling off the roof, grabs hold of the side just in time. Moving to kick Ichigo off the side, Isshin, looking back at Aizen, retreats with his son. After getting enough distance and finding a place to hide, Isshin holds Ichigo down to keep him quiet, prompting Ichigo to kick him in face. As Ichigo explains how he knows enough to keep quiet - he just could not breathe - Isshin assures his son he is seeing correctly, and he knows he must have a lot of questions, but they need to wait until later. Ichigo surprises Isshin by stating he has no questions and assuming if he kept this secret, he must have had his reasons to do so. When he decides to not force the issue and allow Isshin to explain when he wants to, Isshin compliments his son on talking so competently. Ichigo tells him to think nothing of it because someone else told him something similar, which helped at the time. He thanks his father for bringing him back into a mood to handle the current situation. As Ichigo moves to

        attacks Aizen

        As their battle progresses, Isshin, noticing Aizen panting and becoming less sharp, asks him if he is already at his limit. When Aizen states he has reached his limit as a Shinigami and his soul is being reformed, Isshin asks what he is talking about. Aizen states the will of the

        As Aizen elaborates, Isshin states it still sounds like nonsense to him. As Aizen shocks Isshin with his claims, their conversation is interrupted by Gin smashing Ichigo into a nearby building. When Isshin tries to say something to Ichigo, he tells his father to not talk to him and stay out of his way because he nearly has Gin. When the

When Isshin states he had been thinking to himself he had no idea what was going on when Ichigo flew past them, and he still does not know, Ichigo says he should know because he had been fighting him, prompting Isshin to state he should ask Aizen, who is attacked from behind by Urahara.
        Shocked, Isshin and Ichigo watch as Urahara and Aizen battle.

        After Aizen transforms, Isshin attacks him from behind as he is talking to Urahara. When Aizen kicks his sword away, Urahara and Isshin, attacking him simultaneously, entangle him, allowing
        Yoruichi Shihōin
        to attack Aizen from above.
        After the attack fails when Aizen easily breaks the armor Yoruichi is wearing, Urahara and Yoruichi argue about how the armor, made by Urahara, had failed while Isshin awkwardly looks on.
        After the fighting resume, Urahara uses the special abilities of

        As the dust settles, Isshin notes Aizen's Reiatsu was unreadable, and it was like Aizen was not even really there. Emerging with a large crack in his form's face, but otherwise unfazed, Aizen, stating he understood that attack, declares they will now come to understand his power. After Aizen defeats the trio, he, along with Gin, leaves for Soul Society to destroy the real Karakura Town. Managing to get back on his feet, Isshin, going to a shaken Ichigo, tells his son to open a

He reveals it is thanks to Urahara's technological prowess Ichigo's group was only thrown back in time a few days when they went to Soul Society to rescue Rukia rather than hundreds of years. Telling Ichigo he will suppress the Kōtotsu, Isshin embeds four implements, which are attached to his wrists by cord, into the wall of the Dangai. He says that he will use his own Reiatsu to hold back the current, which he believes he can do for around two thousand hours, nearly three months.

Bracing himself on the window, Isshin, yelling at his son for letting him go through the window, asks what he would do if he fell and died.

    Immense Spiritual Power
    :
   </b>
   As a former captain and head of one of the Five
   Noble Houses
   , Isshin possesses a considerable amount of spiritual energy, but he used to have a greater amount of it before losing his powers.
   Ichigo and Shinji are able to sense its strong presence from miles away. Kon was stunned by the level of Isshin's power when he watched Isshin kill Grand Fisher with one swing of his sealed Zanpakutō.
   Using his Reiatsu, he can fixate the Kōryū in the Dangai by himself for up to two thousand hours (roughly three months) before it runs out, something which lower-echelon Shinigami come in by the dozens to do under normal circumstances.
   Masaki Kurosaki
   described his Reiatsu as "

    Isshin's dialogue was censored in the official English translation of the manga by Viz. In the original Japanese manga, in a scene where
    Ichigo
    is carrying
    Yuzu
    while she sleeps, Isshin informs Ichigo with a conspiratory smile that Yuzu is not wearing any panties under her yukata. This causes Ichigo to be furious at Isshin. In the Viz translation, Isshin says this instead: "Enjoy making your brother work like a mule!", with no reference to Yuzu's underwear.

    Isshin cutting down
    Grand Fisher
    was toned down in the anime. In the manga, he sliced Grand Fisher vertically in half, before the latter dissipated.
    In the anime however, Isshin slices Grand Fisher horizontally across the chest, nearly bifurcating him, before the latter collapsed and dissipated.

     Let me teach you the basics. All captain class Shinigami control the size of their Zanpakutō, otherwise everyone would be swinging around swords the size of skyscrapers like yours.
