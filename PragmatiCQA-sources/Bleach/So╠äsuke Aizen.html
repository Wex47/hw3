   When he was a member of the Gotei 13, Aizen appeared as a mild-featured man with brown scholarly hair enhanced by square glasses, along with soft brown eyes. He wore the standard Shinigami uniform with a captain's haori.

   , Aizen loses all of the physical changes made by his transformation and returns to the physical form he had prior to transforming.
   While imprisoned in Muken, he wears an almost entirely black outfit with white trimming, a large black eyepatch over his right eye and black boots. A tattered white rag is wrapped around his shoulders.

  <p key="fb66287c-a028-49da-a6ad-78676c558a6a">
   Aizen is a polite, soft-spoken intellectual, often addressing his subordinates by their given names.
   He rarely shows any sign of alarm or distress, and often has entire situations planned out well in advance. Whenever confronted, Aizen is casual and uncaring, attempting to draw out a conversation and make small talk, which often infuriates those he is talking to.
  </p>
  <p key="c34f4799-fc25-4016-a1bb-9d86b7730391">
   Aizen initially appeared to be a very kind, well-respected captain and was looked up to by many, especially his lieutenant,

   .
   However, this was just a mask to disguise his manipulative, and very dangerous, nature.
   In truth, he cares very little for his underlings, and is willing to use almost everyone around him as pawns to achieve his goals. He is willing to stop at nothing to further his ambitions, including manipulating or killing anyone if he deems it to be necessary.
   He frequently toys with his underlings for amusement.
  </p>
  <p key="a1a7626a-1943-4a1f-8a55-588d2e7560f3">
   During his time as a captain, Aizen liked

   . Aizen admits his new powers allow him to let his guard down.
   Due to this newfound power, Aizen has developed an arrogant and overconfident attitude, often not even thinking his attacks or defense through any longer like he used to, or even bothering to find out the effects of his opponents' and his own attacks. In his newest form, he has developed a severe superiority complex, believing he is now above both

Noting his disapproval, Aizen commented on how scary a person Shinji was, prompting Shinji to say that Aizen was the scary one.

Stating he could have always refused to be Shinji's lieutenant, Aizen revealed he decided against this action because his captain's skepticism made the position ideal to carry out his plans.

        When Aizen asks Renji to put Rukia down, Renji refuses. Commenting on Renji's stubbornness, Aizen says that it is acceptable if Renji wishes to hold on to Rukia, but he will have to leave the arms he is holding her with behind. Drawing his sword, Aizen attacks Renji, but Renji is able to draw his sword in time to dodge Aizen's attack, leaving only his right arm damaged. Applauding his ability to dodge, Aizen expresses happiness with the improvements in Renji's skill because he was one of Aizen's subordinates. Telling Renji he does not want things to be harder because while he finds it difficult to hold back his strength, Aizen states he finds it unbearable for a subordinate to die.

        Challenging this assertion, Renji asks Aizen why he killed Momo. When Aizen states it was an act of compassion because he has trained Momo so she could not live without him, Renji says Aizen is not the captain he knew, prompting Aizen to state he was the same man, but neither Renji nor anyone else had realized what he was. When Renji attacks Aizen with his Shikai, Aizen blocks it with his bare hand and easily cuts the segments of the blade apart while also cutting up Renji. When Renji refuses to give up Rukia, Aizen prepares to kill him, only to be stopped by Ichigo.

Listing various important occurrences in Ichigo's development, Aizen claims they all happened as he desired.

Revealing he was lying back then, Aizen begins to say why he thought Ichigo would be perfect, but is interrupted by the arrival of Isshin, who states Aizen has said too much.

Claiming it has brought about the events surrounding Ichigo, Rukia, and Urahara, Aizen states Urahara misunderstood the nature of the Hōgyoku because the breakdown of the barrier between Shinigami and Hollow was his own desire. Claiming Ichigo, Sado, and Orihime all got their powers from the Hōgyoku, Aizen explains more about it before being interrupted by Gin knocking Ichigo into a nearby building.

        Later, after the death of the Soul King, Kyōraku visits Aizen in his underground prison and asks Aizen to respond to him.
        Upon hearing no response, Kyōraku determines that either Aizen is against conversation, or the seals placed on him restrict his ability to speak. He then begins using keys that can unlock his seals, noting that he can only use up to three of them, and he starts by unlocking the seal over his mouth.
        After unlocking the seal over Aizen's mouth, Kyōraku states that most people who have had their mouths sealed for two years wouldn't be able to talk right away, but it would not be the same case for Aizen. Aizen verbally agrees with Kyōraku, and proceeds to walk towards him. Kyōraku is shocked to find Aizen removing other seals on his own, despite the one over his mouth being the only one unlocked, and Aizen notes that he still has two keys left to use.

        When Shunsui unlocks his left eye and ankles, Aizen notes he has not changed at all, which Shunsui decides to take as a compliment. Aizen states he never asked Shunsui to free him and asks him why he came down here with keys if he had no intention of doing this, prompting Shunsui to reveal he had to store the keys within his own body and could only use three of them. Hearing this, Aizen realizes that Central 46 predicted he would attempt to take the keys by killing Shunsui, which would trap him in Muken forever. As Shunsui asks Aizen to get in the seat behind him so they can go to the surface, an attendant attempts to bind Aizen once more, only to have his hands partially destroyed by Aizen's Reiatsu. Aizen explains how the binding only limits his Reiatsu's range instead of sealing it completely before asking Shunsui if he intends to have Aizen lend his power to the Gotei 13. When Shunsui states they are simply in the same predicament, Aizen wonders what kind of fresh air he could breathe if Yhwach is already done with Soul Society.

        Soon afterward, as black creatures begin pouring into the Seireitei, Aizen is brought to the surface, and the other Shinigami notice his presence as his Reiatsu begins crushing the creatures. Aizen mocks the Shinigami for trying to destroy the creatures with their Zanpakutō before instructing them to crush them with Reiatsu as he is doing.
        Upon seeing the shocked faces of Rukia and Renji, Aizen mockingly greets them and congratulates Rukia for being promoted to the role of lieutenant within the 13th Division, suggesting it was good that her abilities were finally being recognized. When Rukia becomes enraged about his presence, he calmly reveals that Kyōraku had released him.

        When the argument between the other members of the Gotei 13 subsides, Aizen politely asks Kyōraku to undo the seals binding him to the chair but Kyōraku insists that he cannot do that, which causes Aizen to query why he won't. When Kyōraku reminds him that he is only permitted to remove three of Aizen's seals, the former Captain sighs, commenting that he is expected to stop Yhwach from a chair, suggesting that he won't have the power to do this while restrained. Kyōraku asserts that he knows Aizen can do something about the monsters attacking and in response, Aizen uses

        Aizen gathers a dense amount of his Reiatsu around himself and shoots it towards the Soul King Palace, panicking many of the Shinigami, but the attack dissipates randomly about him. Kyōraku reveals that the chair was created to cap his Reiatsu. Mayuri comes forward, revealing that he created the chair, and other technologies like it, in order to keep criminals who currently can't be killed in check. He shows Aizen the object that he uses to control the chair, mocking him for thinking he could defeat the chair specifically designed to keep his power in check. Upon learning that the researcher is in control, Aizen challenges Mayuri in pitting his technology against Aizen's power to see which would win. However, Aizen is soon interrupted by the arrival of

        Five minutes later, Aizen recovers and converses with Shunsui about the Sternritter helping the Shinigami access the Soul King Palace. Upon realizing that those who stopped him are going to get to the palace before he can, Aizen notes Ichigo is a man who is hard to forgive.
        Having been left behind in Seireitei by the Gotei 13, Aizen watches with interest as fragments of

        Soul Society. Yhwach destroys Aizen's chair, releasing him of his bindings, and Aizen remarks on the amount of trouble Ichigo gave Yhwach in combat up in the Soul King Palace. Yhwach replies that Aizen was the one who was defeated by Ichigo, and Aizen thanks him for freeing him from his chair, as he now has the means to stop the Quincy Emperor. Yhwach questions why it would be in Aizen's interests to defend Soul Society, and Aizen replies that this has nothing to do with interests, but is only him repelling those who would try to rule over and control him. Their conversation is then suddenly interrupted as Ichigo and Renji Abarai attack Yhwach from behind.

        After Yhwach begins attacking Ichigo, Aizen attacks him while disguised as Renji with his Bankai active, only for Yhwach to sever his left arm while deciding to crush him with his own hands. Returning to his normal form with his Zanpakutō intact, Aizen seemingly protects Renji from Yhwach, who ridicules him for this, before using

        Ichigo defeats Yhwach soon afterward, and Aizen is later imprisoned again and bound in another chair. Ten years later, Aizen senses that the last remnants of Yhwach's Reiatsu have disappeared. He recalls Yhwach's final words about how his defeat meant the continuation of death and the fear accompanying it, but reflects that in such a world people would never have the hope and the courage that kept death at bay.

      Your Ryūjin Jakka is indeed the most powerful Zanpakutō in existence. There is no doubt about that. Were I to fight against it directly, it would likely overpower even me. However, if one abandons all other abilities and focuses his strength entirely on a single specialized skill, then he can overcome even the greatest of powers.

      Cruel? Once a soul has become a Hollow, it holds no meaning. It is a being with no purpose beyond idly consuming its fellow souls. Where do you see cruelty in my giving purpose to such a being? Surely the true act of cruelty was your tearing that soul to pieces.

      I suppose it is only to be expected. You have my pity. There is no such thing as 'truth' or 'lies' in this world; there never has been. There is only plain, hard facts. And yet, all beings who exist in this world take only those 'facts' that are convenient to them, and take them to be the 'truth'. They do so because they know no other way to live. However, for those powerless beings that make up the majority of this world it is those 'facts' that are inconvenient for their own self-affirmation that make up the real 'truth'.

      The Hōgyoku is able to manifest the desires of those around it. However, this manifestation will not be successful unless the possessors of those desires have the strength to carry it out. In a way, its ability might be better termed a 'guiding force'. However, it is a peculiar quality of living beings that when it comes to achieving those petty desires that their crude hearts enshrine, they tend to have remarkable levels of success.

      Why not be careless? I no longer have any need to take care. I can feel it. Now that my body has subjugated the Hōgyoku, it has begun to far surpass even the capacity that I once possessed - a capacity that already held no equal in Soul Society. There is no longer any need for me to evade even a Kidō ranking in the nineties!
