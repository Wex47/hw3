   Yoshino is a tall woman with chest-length brown hair that parts over her forehead in a large, leftward-facing bang, pale violet eyes, and thin eyebrows. She wears red lipstick and a faded green dress with a popped collar encircled by a red tie ending in a flat edge and purple frills lacing the bottom; the dress is divided into two halves gently curving away from each other at the front of her midsection and is colored maroon in a bra-like portion over her breasts, with the section below this being colored orange-gray instead. Underneath this, Yoshino wears a short, dark shirt that leaves her midriff bare, blue-gray pants with a light gray arrow pointing downward at her crotch at the front of the waist, and plain brown shoes.
  </p>
  <p key="ed81c8b7-85e3-43a7-890e-1a4e67706f21">

   Soul
   of an innocent security guard and referring to it as a man and a woman simply having a good time when
   Yoruichi Shihōin
   stopped her,
   and later attempting to repeat this with an innocent woman walking down the street. However, when confronted by

   </a>
   over this, Yoshino expressed a desire to avoid fighting him if possible and criticized him for not possibly being able to understand her goals.
   Moreover, unlike the rest of the
   Bount
   , she has a hostile relationship with her ex-husband
   Jin Kariya
   and refuses to accept his "forgiveness" for her actions, due to her adversity to taking orders from anyone.
   She can also be very blunt, having told
   <a href="Uryū Ishida.html" key="9d482dd3-6f67-41bd-9fc3-b948bc4f6757" title="Uryū Ishida">

   Souls are not appetizing and that his in particular smells even worse due to his lack of powers, as well as teasing him about his self-pitying nature.
  </p>
  <p key="5d99f945-0a8a-4b0e-af0d-9f6658ebe2b5">
   Eventually, Yoshino reveals her true colors when she rescues Uryū from an attack by
   Ryō Utagawa
   and treats him with slightly cold compassion while explaining her motivation: she believes strongly in the one rule of the Bount that prohibits them from consuming living Souls since it would grant them immense power and allow them to affect space, disturbing the balance of the worlds, and plans to stop Kariya's ambition now that he is openly breaking this rule for his own ambition; to this end, she attempted to consume living Souls herself in order to gain the power necessary to fight him, but eventually found that she no longer wanted to break the rule after being thwarted and instead resolved to fight him with her current level of power, as well as to protect Uryū, who would be crucial to Kariya's plan as the Last Quincy.
   Though she once truly loved Kariya with all her heart, Yoshino grew to hate him for constantly trying to control her actions
   and cut ties with him entirely upon seeing him ferally devouring a living Human's Soul in the streets,
   which is part of what led her to comprehend the destruction that Kariya would bring to both the Bount and
   <a href="Soul Society.html" key="02d4a2e7-8f64-4be9-ae7c-76d8d9d45587" title="Soul Society">

   </a>
   where no one else could.
  </p>
  <p key="3a9affff-35c2-4f58-b764-3bc788b80812">
   Ultimately, Yoshino lives in a state of quiet depression from her unwantedly-long life causing her to be ostracized from normal Humans and wants nothing more than to finally die; she has come to hate how the passage of time both plants foolish ambition in the Bount and ruins the fleeting dreams that result from it, and because of her inability to live among normal Humans, Yoshino feels a crushing loneliness and resides in an otherwise-abandoned apartment building so she can watch people go about their lives on the street below and not feel lonely. Having been saved from committing suicide out of despair at her agelessness in the past by Kariya, Yoshino has come to believe that only normal Humans can be happy and believe in the concept of eternal love because they only live for a few decades instead of endless centuries like the Bount do; furthermore, she believes that simply living for centuries has stripped away most of her humanity and is firm on maintaining what little she has left by refusing to forgive Kariya for his monstrous actions. However, Uryū observes that Yoshino lives next to a large clock whose ringing shakes her entire apartment despite hating time and theorizes that, despite her claims of wanting to die, she is still expecting something to happen that will make her want to live; furthermore, he believes that there is a small ray of hope within her lonesome eyes and that she has not completely fallen into despair because she still seeks out hope, something which Yoshino does not deny.
  </p>
  <p key="ca7b24c0-e292-4d13-b0bd-91ec29d8d478">
   During her time with Uryū, Yoshino develops a close bond with him
   and confides in him about her guilt over having attacked living Humans and her self-loathing for being a member of a race that can only die without growing in number, where she learns about the concept of pride in one's own power and decides that she has some left, ultimately leaving Uryū with a kiss on the forehead so she can settle things with Kariya.
   Due to her maternal power, she also has a much closer relationship with her

   was broken instead of immediately dying. When death finally came for her, Yoshino was content to pass away in Uryū's arms and thanked him for showing her compassion.

   that altered

   in the cycle of rebirth, Yoshino was born many centuries ago with the facial features of
   Ran'Tao
   and grew up in a European city, where she made friends and led a peaceful life, only to feel a growing sense of isolation as she stayed young while those around her grew old. With her former residence left in a desolate state of disrepair and the normal

   of the city believing her to be a witch because of her agelessness, which caused them to pursue her as a mob, Yoshino fled to an abandoned church and prepared to end her own life with a shard of glass out of despair at being left behind by time.
  </p>
  <p key="d6ce609d-8153-45a6-b859-9f00b5571599">
   However, before she could do so,
   Jin Kariya
   entered the church and revealed himself to be a fellow immortal
   Bount
   as he asked her to live with him. Eventually, the two of them fell in love and got married, and Yoshino was happy for a time, but had her tranquility shattered when she witnessed Kariya consuming the Soul of a living Human, breaking the one law of the Bount tribe. From there, Yoshino realized that Kariya's ambition and desire for revenge against

   and so began working to subvert his plans and stop him, specifically by refusing to follow his orders like the rest of the Bount did and increasing her own power.

   However, Uryū realizes Yoshino has a spark of hope in her mournful eyes and promises to help her achieve her goal however he can to help her find hope, which Yoshino is genuinely touched by.
