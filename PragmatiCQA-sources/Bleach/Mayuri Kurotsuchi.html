    Appearance

  </h2>
  <p key="c7393558-d8e9-4e76-835c-3ecb37684dd6">
   Mayuri's appearance has a skeletal look to it with a skull-like visage. His face is painted entirely white with the inner portion of his face painted black with the exception of his nose. His eyes are a golden color and he constantly bares his teeth giving the appearance of him constantly smiling. Both his ears are seemingly replaced with stubbed golden cones. His fingernails are blue and, with the exception of the fingernail on his right middle finger, are all short. The one long fingernail is as long as the finger itself. He also wears a white hat with two ends that point to his right and a large purple scarf around his neck. His whole body, even his face and hands, has been painted black and white. He repaints his make-up every morning, as he always removes it before going to bed.
  </p>
  <p key="ad45a25f-39c7-4773-a053-279adacee892">
   Without his makeup, Mayuri has blue hair and honey gold eyes. He has small, slatted portcullises with multiple earrings in place of where his ears would be, and his body is covered in scars.
  </p>
  <p key="c613c8ff-c49e-4606-b86d-042fc65de4e7">
   Upon entering Hueco Mundo, Mayuri reveals a new look: his face paint had changed with him creating a black cross upon the center of his face covering everything but his nose and a small portion of his lower chin. His ear attachments have become shorter and rounder but wider, his chin has a long golden attachment reminiscent of an Egyptian Pharaoh beard, his teeth have become a golden color, and he no longer wears a hat as there is a golden frame around his face. His hair is also styled into "horns," that slope down from the top of his head and frame his face, which when viewed from the front looks much like a Pharaoh's crown.
  </p>
  <p key="967c7ca9-9127-4845-9c39-d10370ba9630">
   17 months after Aizen's defeat, Mayuri displays another new look. The black face paint covers much of his face, leaving thin white lines going up his face and a white nose. He wears a long, golden headdress which curves back to his mid back. Underneath his chin are two opposite facing strands from the mask. On the backside of the headdress the Twelfth Division symbol is painted.
  </p>
  <p key="67bb9035-9719-453d-869f-a23c65ae14a4">
   Following the first invasion by the

   , Mayuri dons a bright white overcoat with many ridges on the front. The overcoat also has a hood that has many protrusions that give the appearance of a sun. The shoes he wears have changed to be a plain white pair with the shoes splitting into opposite points at the toe.
  </p>
  <p key="0fbb9dfb-ab03-4d18-b1a0-e8e8a22c5485">
   Under this outfit he has styled his hair into three loops, and his ears are covered by three large golden tubes that wrap around the sides of his head.
  </p>
  <p key="e47c425c-c3aa-4c94-821e-166ff43837ef">
   10 years after Yhwach's defeat, Mayuri's face is painted to resemble a white-and-black mask, with the white portion circling his forehead and covering his upper lip and nose, while the black portions consist of his lower lip, chin, and most of his forehead as well as the area around his eyes. He now wears a large golden headpiece resembling a pair of ram's horns curling backward behind his head.
  </p>
  <p key="8a083131-8945-482f-a50c-a9275b2e46f1">
   12 years after Yhwach's defeat, Mayuri's face is largely painted black with white, serrated-like fringes on either side. He has returned to wearing the golden cones over his ears and now dons a wide headdress styled like a pair of horizontal insect antennae, as well as a vest sectioned into multiple petal-like pieces with large black dots in the center.
  </p>
  <p key="e4718cca-2bc1-4d42-b684-9d66008a2172">
   110 years ago, Mayuri's appearance was similar to his current appearances, but with minimal details. He was still largely painted white except for the black paint which was arranged around his eyes like a large domino mask. He had gold cones covering his ears and blue hair combed back on the top of his head.
  </p>
  <p key="3260c4f7-50db-4e21-b596-77950b058b2f">
   While developing the Nemuri Project, Mayuri's makeup consisted of black, geometrical shapes covering the area of his face above his nose and mouth, with thick lines extending to his jaw, and he retained the gold cones on his ears while donning an oddly-shaped hat.

   Mayuri Kurotsuchi is a researcher and personifies the stereotype of the mad scientist. By his early actions during the Ryoka Invasion, he is displayed as sadistic and cruel. He sees everyone and everything not as a living being, but as an object to be researched—including himself.
   He has little respect or regard for most others, and was even willing to turn his own men (who were not aware of his plans) into living bombs in an attempt to capture

   from the other Shinigami in order to capture one as a research subject for himself.
   However, while he usually shows disregard for life, he has been known to warn people of possible dangers when they present themselves.
   As a scientist, Mayuri despises perfection, as he believes that achieving such a state leaves him with absolutely nothing more to strive for — namely imagination, knowledge and improvements — which would result in nothing but despair; because of this, he derided

  </p>
  <p key="43f286fa-55b8-41fc-afa6-028bcbe332f0">
   It is known that Mayuri's favorite food is pike fish, and that he does not like onion. One of his free-time activities is reading every character published in
   <i key="13211af4-b608-4e72-b13e-c3ecb2a8c34c">
    Seireitei Communication
   </i>
   . He himself publishes a serialization in the journal, titled "Effective Medication for the Brain", which apparently contains detailed instructions on preparation of medicine and their application. Surprisingly, it is highly popular among the readers.
  </p>
  <p key="af580e0a-1ca5-4580-814f-59a55979f50b">
   In battle, Mayuri likes to toy with his opponent, torturing them little by little until they can hardly stand. He did this in both the fight with Uryū and his Espada counterpart Szayelaporro. Every time he fights he uses it as an experiment testing himself and his opponent little by little. He also uses it as an opportunity to implant microbes or other things in case they get away. Before engaging, though, he will make extensive research on his possible opponents to tilt the chance of winning in his favor.
   Before the Winter War, he is busy reading in the library with a note on the door saying, "Enter and Die."
  </p>
  <p key="8a4d1efc-a126-4539-8afa-4d2b0c5dddbf">
   Mayuri's utter disregard for life even extends to the rest of the Gotei 13, believing that all members of the organization are to be prepared to give up their lives in order to protect the Seireitei. To this end, he would gladly cut down any former comrades, even if they are under the enemy's control,
   test many of his experimental drugs on such comrades for the sake of his research which he believes to be the sake of the Seireitei,
   and even force his zombified fellow captains to become his minions to fight to their last breath for the sake of Gotei 13 and Soul Society, as opposed to killing them out of mercy.
  </p>
  <p key="bbf35ec0-42ef-48c9-8cb1-fe72b21dc05f">
   Despite his disregard for most life, Mayuri is very obsessive about creating it, and it is his dream to create a soul out of nothing.
   This led to him being overjoyed when the seventh test of the Nemuri Project was successful.

   Little is known about the early history of Mayuri, except that 110 years ago, he was the only prisoner in the
   Maggot's Nest
   who was considered dangerous enough to necessitate confinement in a small prison cell, chained to the wall by his ankle. He would, however, one day be visited by

   who was seeking his genius to become vice-president in the newly thought-of
   Shinigami Research and Development Institute
   , a request that would automatically get him out of there. At first Mayuri refused since he is quite content with his life down in the Nest, until Kisuke began teasing him with the fact that he had nothing to tinker with down there and that, as vice-president, he would inherit everything should something happen to Urahara.
  </p>
  <p key="a82ae0ab-0b03-440f-86d4-326d78fedcab">
   At some point, Mayuri read a book detailing the functions of the arms of the

   . Mayuri expressed distaste for Shinji as he refused to call Mayuri by his full name and only called him by his first, which was too familiar for Mayuri's liking. He acted uninterested in the conversation between Urahara and Aizen who was explaining that the 9th Division had been sent on a special investigation to find out what was happening with the disappearances in the Rukongai.
  </p>
  <p key="a00011e2-0ab8-4f36-aa62-3bfd4030ad12">
   During her brief time as a member of the institute, Hiyori served as a lab manager, which resulted in clashes with Mayuri, who was then 3rd Seat &amp; Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute, over who had more authority under the captain. The two constantly got into an ongoing argument about who was in charge, prompting Hiyori to call in Urahara. He explained to her that with the disappearances occurring he had created a new type of Gigai. Before Hiyori could respond they were interrupted by the arrival of
   Tōdō Izaemon
   , the 6th Seat of the 9th Division. Urahara agreed to send a researcher over to the investigation site as per the request of Captain

   of the 9th Division. Urahara elected Hiyori to go to the site, to which she became irritated and asked why he couldn't send someone less important, referring to lab assistant
   Akon
   . He questioned if she should continue being a lieutenant prompting Hiyori to attack him, though he simply dodged her. Though reluctant, Hiyori gave in once Urahara explained that she was the only one that he could trust with the task.

   After an incident that got Urahara and

        Gotei 13

He then tells Uryū not to dare try and tell him how to treat her, but Uryū still screams out in protest only to realize that his arm is paralyzed. Mayuri proceeds to tell him what the special ability of his Zanpakutō is, and then stabs Uryū in his arm once again causing him to scream out in pain. Mayuri then tells Nemu to kill him, but then realizes that she is paralyzed because of the attack as well and stomps on her again. Before he stabs her again with his Zanpakutō, Uryū screams that he should stop, prompting Mayuri to question whether his philosophy has to do with the

He sneers that before dying they would always swear on the pride of the Quincy. Uryū listens on in absolute shock as he hears of the butchering of his people. Mayuri then offhandedly reveals that he was the one who orchestrated the death of Uryū's grandfather,

        Mayuri then takes out his hidden Kusarigama and resolves that since he is starting to find Uryū interesting, he will keep him alive to study as well. But much to Mayuri's surprise, Uryū removes his

        Mayuri is utterly surprised as he has never seen this technique before and is unsure of what even happened. He then notices that Uryū is absorbing the surrounding structures, then deduces that since everything in Soul Society is made of Reishi, he is absorbing them and turning them into strength. Mayuri tells Uryū that he has gone far beyond the limits of Humans, but Uryū's only response is the creation of a complex bow construct, from which he fires a spiritual arrow, which Mayuri dodges. To his surprise, Uryū appears above him and shoots him, causing a large explosion. Uryū offers to spare Mayuri if he begs for mercy and never appears in front of him again. He threatens to shoot him with a spiritual arrow three times stronger than the last shot if he does not. The previous arrow grievously injured Mayuri, having destroyed his left arm. Now enraged, he chastises Uryū for his arrogance and declares that he could match his power, and laughs. After doing so, he releases his Bankai. Mayuri explains that the poison his Bankai releases would surely kill him, though Uryū states that his arrow will reach Mayuri long before his Bankai's fatal poison can be released. Mayuri sends his creature charging at Uryū, who fires his arrow, splitting it in half and shooting a hole through Mayuri's abdomen.

        Later, he hears of

   Szayelaporro then takes Nemu captive, but Mayuri releases his Bankai and devours Szayelaporro with it. Szayelaporro uses the rebirth power of his Resurrección to recreate himself inside Nemu, but in doing so is affected by chemicals contained inside Nemu's body.
   Mayuri is highly intrigued by this new power, and requests to see what other powers his opponent has. To give him what he asked for, Szayelaporro uses his possession ability to control Mayuri's Bankai, but Mayuri already had countermeasures set in place for just that possibility; his Bankai self-destructs, reverting to its sealed state.
  </p>
  <p key="e5b5ea70-5778-4e46-a102-2111210f8dfa">
   Mayuri, disappointed at Szayelaporro's lack of any further abilities, explains that by recreating himself inside Nemu, Szayelaporro is now dosed with one of many special drugs placed inside her body. The one he just absorbed is a sense-enhancing chemical that he instantly names a 'superhuman drug', as it were. The drug increases Szayelaporro's senses to the point that his body falls grossly behind and cannot move, paralyzing him as seconds become centuries. Mayuri then berates Szayelaporro for his statement as a scientist that he was the perfect being. He then proceeds to pierce Szayelaporro's hand and continues to slowly thrust his Zanpakutō through to Szayelaporro's heart, wishing him a pleasant eternity, before breaking off the blade as the ultimate torture for Szayelaporro and also as punishment for his Zanpakutō striking at its master.
  </p>
  <p key="8da0992c-5f42-42b5-866a-e1dd1e3c9452">
   After searching for Szayelaporro's laboratory throughout the rubble, he realizes that he cannot ask Nemu for help. Musing that she is such a "pain in the ass", he revives Nemu with rather odd and possibly very explicit means and has her dig out Szayelaporro's laboratory, within which are a pair of bodies suspended from the ceiling.
   After this he continues to heal Uryū and Renji, the latter being healed first so he could go and help in the other concurrent fights.
   Once he is finished healing Uryū, he gives him an anti-Arrancar mine that he invented.

He then notes how Ichigo used no honorifics to address him, but muses about the fact that he was better than Byakuya and Kenpachi, whom Ichigo would only address using their given names.

   Byakuya takes notice of his unusually lenient mood and asks if it has something to do with the wagon behind him. Mayuri confirms this and tells him that he is in a good mood because, not only has he found some "spoils of war", but at the same place he was also able to analyze the structure of the Garganta. When Ichigo questions his statement, Mayuri begins to rant about what he had learned and orders Nemu to make preparations to send the substitute Shinigami to the Human world. When Ichigo further complains, Mayuri explains to Ichigo that this process was an experiment, and that Ichigo is "Test Subject Number 1" and therefore, he has no right to refuse or to accept.

   then arrives and says she'll accompany Ichigo back. Mayuri is surprised that she'd offer to be a test subject too, but she smiles and says that she has faith in him and that she believes the experiment will be a success. Besides that, if Mayuri failed to make a Garganta, even after analyzing information found in Hueco Mundo, then Urahara would laugh at him. Mayuri reminds her that he could close the Garganta during the transfer, which she merely acknowledges as being true. Unohana only says that she expects no less. He then opens the Garganta to let both Ichigo and Unohana through.
   Before Ichigo leaves with Unohana, Ichigo tells Mayuri how he is similar to Kisuke, which infuriates him. After Ichigo leaves, Mayuri comments to himself how fascinating Ichigo is and how he will formulate a plan to torment Ichigo.
   Byakuya then asks Mayuri why he didn't go to the Human World as well. Mayuri merely replies that there are multiple more interesting specimens in Hueco Mundo and will simply use the Garganta after the war to study the Living World more. Byakuya then suggests that Mayuri has faith in Ichigo's abilities to end the war.

   Mayuri oversees the checking of the pillars to determine if they are all free of anomalies. As check is completed he initiates the activation of the world shifting bond posts. He is interrupted by one of his subordinates who tells him that he needs to wait as there are Shinigami in the town and a material world transfer without the aid of a Senkai gate is dangerous. Mayuri decides that he will give them time and count to ten as his subordinate calls for every Shinigami to get out of town before they are killed.
   Later, Mayuri begins doing regular research in Hueco Mundo.

     After Inaba flees, Mayuri joins other members of the Gotei 13 in Ichigo's room for a meeting. Mayuri states that Inaba is the 7th seat of his division and the head of Dangai research in the S.R.D.I. He then explains that Inaba manipulated the Kōtotsu so that it would intercept them as they entered the Dangai in order to confine them while he replaced them with Reigai. He outlines the danger Inaba presents to the integrity of the Gotei 13, as Ichigo speculates why Inaba tried so desperately to capture Nozomi. Mayuri presents the conclusion that he may have placed something inside her body, akin to the Hōgyoku previously sealed inside Rukia's Gigai.

He then posed as the Reigai through the use of contact lenses and a Reigai bracelet, infiltrating Soul Society. As he stabs Inaba, a though process interrupting drug is injected into his system. Mayuri uses his extendable arm to grab his neck and tie him up. Inaba manages to free himself from Mayuri's arm, prompting Mayuri to praise his combat ability. Mayuri reveals that he was stalling for time and offers to keep his eyes closed as he walks towards Inaba so that the later may attack him.

He forces Mayuri back and the Reigai return to his side. Inaba claims that he was the one who developed the Mod-Souls, which Mayuri dismisses as a lie. Inaba angrily decries this and reveals how advanced the research into Modified Souls was. He destroys the Reigai Reiatsu-limiters, prompting them to release their full power as several Reigai that had already been defeated appear. Mayuri explains that as long as their core form, the pill, is preserved, their bodies can be replaced. Inaba tells Mayuri that not even he could create Reigai that could withstand such Reiatsu. The Reigai engage in a grand melee with the captains. Mayuri is then intercepted by the Shikai of Reigai-

Giselle confirms this and explains how those who are zombified before death can be completely controlled because they have no free will. Mayuri asks her what fun there is in controlling someone with no free will, only for Giselle to state she does not know because she is not a sadist. When Charlotte confronts Hitsugaya and attacks him, Mayuri yells for him to get back, only for Hitsugaya to slash Charlotte across the chest. However, Mayuri protects Charlotte from Hitsugaya's next attack with a Kidō barrier and states he will punish him for attacking someone he could not defeat by leaving him on the verge of death.

Turning to Pernida, Mayuri claims that it should donate its body to him for experimentation in order to honor Kenpachi's sacrifice, but is surprised when Pernida rips apart its hood to reveal it is the left arm of the Soul King. After Pernida gains the rest of its body in the form of a large arm, Mayuri reveals that its Reiatsu is similar to that of
        Mimihagi
        and admits that it is not very odd for the left arm to have been on its own somewhere if the right arm was too. When Pernida attacks him with more shadowy tendrils, Mayuri defends himself with an unusual shield before claiming that his happiness outweighs his curiosity as to why the left arm of the Soul King is working for Yhwach. Ikkaku tells him to run and demands to know how he can be happy about this, but Mayuri enthusiastically states that he has a completely new subject to study and could not possibly be unhappy about it. As Pernida unleashes a barrage of tendrils, Mayuri tells it to show him more.

As Nemu successfully injects the agent and paralyzes Pernida and one of its clones, Mayuri informs the remaining clone that this is the end, but is surprised when it simply rips off its infected thumb and informs him that this is not enough to kill it. Noting that it sounds like Kenpachi, Mayuri realizes that Pernida can evolve by absorbing information from objects which it touches with its nerves and deduces that Nemu's speed will not be enough to outpace Pernida if it has evolved to Kenpachi's level. Mayuri yells for Nemu to get out of the way as Pernida sheds its infected skin like the modified

Surprised by Nemu claiming that she is following her mission to protect him, Mayuri angrily states that her mission is to evolve, but Nemu merely states that she can best show the results of her growth by protecting him before throwing Mayuri onto a nearby building.

Snatching Nemu's brain away before it can be eaten, Mayuri repels one of the clones' nerves with his Reiatsu alone before telling them to keep eating before it dies as one of its fingers enlarges. As the other fingers follow suit, Mayuri explains how he replaced Nemu's regenerative cells with cells that multiply at high speeds and reveals they are controlled by the brain alone before revealing that the clone will die from excess regeneration as the clone's tissue is grossly expanded.

As he and Rangiku emerge from the containers and begin walking away, Hitsugaya thanks Mayuri, who is helped into one of the pods by Ikkaku and Yumichika. After placing Kenpachi in the other containers, Ikkaku and Yumichika thank Mayuri for saving Kenpachi before leaving as well.

Byakuya addresses the point that if Mayuri is already there it must mean their information is accurate, to which Mayuri states that whether the information is right or wrong they will all see for themselves soon enough. They then see the remnants of Yhwach's Reiatsu in front of them, and brace for an attack. However, just as the Reiatsu grows in strength it randomly vanishes without a trace, shocking the three captains.

         "): A drug injected into the nerves of an organism which forcefully freezes any organs connected to those nerves; open eyelids will remain open, hearts will not expand or contract, and mouths will become unable to shut. The blood of the organism also coagulates, effectively killing the target. Once the drug begins to take effect, the victim's skin becomes dark in coloration. However, this can be countered if the target's skin is divided into multiple layers, which allows it to simply shed a damaged one and remain unaffected, as with

He can move around and speak in this form. He reforms after a few days, but without any of his previous body modifications.
    This ability is a result of the extensive amount of experimentation he has performed on himself.

He relies on those abilities, or his pre-planned strategies, rather than actually engaging in melee combat with his opponent. Mayuri seems to be ambidextrous, as he wields his Zanpakutō in his right hand and his scythe-ear in his left (often simultaneously). During the

      There is nothing in this world that is truly 'perfect'. Though it may be a rather large cliche, it is still the truth. It is the ordinary people who look up to 'perfection' as an ideal and seek after it. But in truth, what is this idea of 'perfection' truly worth? Nothing. Not a single thing. I detest 'perfection'. To be 'perfect' is to be unable to improve any further. There would be no scope for 'creation', not a single gap in one's knowledge or one's ability. Do you see now? To true scientists like you and I, 'perfection' is tantamount to 'despair'. We aspire to reach greater levels of brilliance than ever before, but never, NEVER, to reach perfection. That is the paradox through which we scientists must struggle. Indeed, it is our duty to find pleasure in that struggle. In other words, the second you allowed yourself to spout a ridiculous word like 'perfect', in truth, you had already been defeated. That is, if you wish to be treated as a scientist.
