  <p key="da88a8ed-31b7-4bdf-9299-cc9b069be8d0">
   As the 28th Head of the Kuchiki Clan, Byakuya acts in an aristocratic manner. He always seems serene and apathetic towards other people, even while actually deeply conflicted. He is notably calm, even in battle. He generally acts indifferent, bordering on arrogance, to most situations he is faced with, and rarely views his opponent as being worth his time. Byakuya is easily offended if his name is not used properly. As such, he views

   </a>
   with disdain for always referring to him improperly. When Byakuya talks with Ichigo, he calls him by his full name. Byakuya is very perceptive, fully aware of the limits of his abilities, and anything he states in comparison to an opponent is usually justified. Despite consistently stating himself to be far stronger than opponents like
   Zommari Rureaux
   , Byakuya retains a formal tone, always using "watashi" which is a formal way of referring to oneself. When he was younger, he was quick to anger and very hot-headed, as noted by his grandfather.
  </p>
  <p key="23d01fe4-f12c-43aa-9f33-1a5f70549da0">
   Byakuya strongly believes in law and order. As a captain of the Gotei 13 and head of one of the great noble families, he works hard for a peaceful society. He feels that if someone in his position does not follow the rules as a good example, no one else will. He believes that to maintain the order, all law-breakers must be punished, even if it goes against his own wishes. Byakuya feels that "part of a captain's responsibilities is to make sure that the lieutenant's responsibilities are taken care of".

  <p key="d65892c7-e3e4-4520-8a1c-59e9eaa323cf">
   During the years between Rukia's adoption and her death sentence, Byakuya's pride and calm demeanor made her believe he never cared about her because he had never once looked at her. In spite of his icy and regal manner, Byakuya cares for and protects those important to him. This holds especially true to Rukia as he loved Hisana dearly and unconditionally, having promised Hisana he would protect Rukia no matter what. After the events of the Aizen incident, he admits law isn't perfect, and becomes more lenient towards Rukia. Although, he tries to maintain a balance between following orders and breaking the law by exploiting loopholes in his orders. In addition, he also provided Rukia and Renji with safety cloaks to protect them against Hueco Mundo's rough terrain.
  </p>
  <p key="35d913a0-558d-4d8e-851c-1deb4f8aa295">
   Because of his promise to Hisana, Byakuya smothered Rukia despite his pride by making sure she would never become a seated officer because of the risks that involve missions for such positions.
   He also comes to learn about his mistakes of keeping his feelings to himself and becomes more open about how much he cares for Rukia and others that are close to him such as Renji.

   Byakuya is popular among the female Shinigami of Soul Society, and was voted number one in the "captain we desire to release a photo book for" poll taken by the Shinigami Women's Association.

   . Upon seeing Yoruichi, he attacked and insulted her. Yoruichi playfully teased him, complaining about his greeting after coming all the way there to see him. Byakuya, expressing his displeasure at seeing her, stated he would be the head of the Kuchiki Clan soon enough, so he had no time to waste on her. Yoruichi, stealing his hair tie, exclaimed that if the head of the Kuchiki Clan could get his hair tie stolen by a girl at play, she is worried about its future. She used Shunpo to escape from him, leaving an angry Byakuya, claiming his superiority, promising to make her see the error of her ways.

Byakuya explains he knew Ichigo looked familiar, as 33 hours ago, Special Forces obtained his image after he fought a Menos Grande, giving it a scar.

Byakuya tells him not to be like that, for if he is always the spectator, his skills may degrade. When Rukia runs to Ichigo's body, Byakuya asks her if she would still go to Ichigo's side after all that has just happened, and tells her he understands, as he does resemble

He states Ichigo should die from his injuries in a half hour, and if he does survive, his Shinigami powers will be gone. He has Renji open a

     Along with several other Shinigami, Byakuya apprehends Ichigo.
     Some time later, upon arriving in the Human World, Byakuya saves Ichigo from

     The next day, Byakuya and the Shinigami hold a meeting about the current situation in Ichigo's room.
    </p>
    <p key="36f0f06c-9e48-4901-9f48-5bd306f1acc2">
     Along with
     Komamura
     , Hitsugaya, and Kenpachi, Byakuya decides to travel back to Soul Society in order to take out Inaba. He deduces that the
     Kōtotsu
     will appear any time a Shinigami enters the Dangai, a theory Urahara agrees with. While the captains are running behind the Kōtotsu, the
     Kōryū
     closes in on them, forcing Komamura to stay behind and unleash his Bankai so the others can complete their journey. The remaining three captains split up in order to infiltrate the
     Twelfth Division
     's barracks.
     Byakuya encounters the
     Reigai
     counterpart of Hitsugaya. The two battle intensely, and Byakuya is forced to use his

     technique to defeat the Reigai.
     He is then confronted by a Reigai copy of himself."
    </p>
    <p key="19602c34-5a8c-4980-98ef-e329ce7e7d09">
     As the skirmish goes on, Byakuya is forced to fall back. As the Reigai's Shikai pursues him, it proceeds to cut him multiple times, much to his surprise. Later, as Byakuya perches atop a tower, his Reigai counterpart states his wounds are too severe to allow him to fight any longer. Byakuya continues to fight, releasing his Bankai,
     and defeats the Reigai. He rejoins the other captains as they confront Inaba. Byakuya, pulling back as several Reigai appear before them, uses his Bankai to surround the Reigai, which creates an opening for the other Shinigami to attack, as he tells them to follow through.
    </p>
    <p key="904c413e-b86a-4497-83db-d6771d32c9d9">
     Byakuya and the other Shinigami watch as Mayuri fights Inaba. As Inaba releases the Reigai's true power, Byakuya and the other Shinigami prepare to fight them. As the Reigai jump down to attack the captains, Byakuya dodges their initial blows, coming face-to-face with the remade Reigai-Byakuya.
     Eventually, Byakuya and the other captains are forced to retreat.
     They return in time to help Ichigo and Kisuke against the Reigai.
     Determined to settle things once and for all, Byakuya, facing his Reigai counterpart, insists on proving who is the true head of the Kuchiki Clan.
    </p>
    <p key="90a17b2b-7238-41ef-a47b-c79816c30486">
     As the battle continues, the Reigai, increasing in numbers, become much more dangerous, attacking whomever they see. The lieutenants arrive and aid the captains, which allows Byakuya to save Yoruichi from a surprise attack by Reigai-Shunsui, despite becoming injured in the process.
     As the battle progresses, Byakuya realizes the Reigai value self-preservation the most, and will not attack first in fear of being outnumbered. Byakuya deduces these ideals of relying on nobody and never truly trusting even their allies are traits the Reigai acquired from Inaba. While Reigai-Hitsugaya is surprised by the captains fighting together, Byakuya states they will do what they must to protect Soul Society.
     Later, Byakuya watches as the Reigai help stop
     Yushima

   As

   Tsukishima

   Byakuya says he is lucky he is the one fighting him, as Ichigo is too lenient and he cannot imagine Ichigo killing Tsukishima. Byakuya, blocking Tsukishima's attack with his Shikai, states he despises the way Tsukishima fights, stealing the bonds of camaraderie and torturing opponents, which he views as the height of cowardice.

   Acknowledging defeat, Tsukishima asks Byakuya if he has any remorse for killing the man he claims he is thankful to before he can repay him. Byakuya admits he regrets not being able to repay him, but has no remorse for Tsukishima, as he is Ichigo's enemy. He later finds the unconscious Rukia.

Äs Nödt asks Byakuya if he realizes he is experiencing fear, which is what is making it hard for him to mount an effective attack or defense against him. He further details that this fear is a result of a unique ability administered by its

Byakuya attempts to strike the Quincy, but Äs, dodging the attack, counters by impaling his hand through Byakuya's chest, grievously wounding him. The Quincy explains that this fear is real and not based on reason, and therefore it is not something one can overcome. Byakuya moves to strike Äs, but he, moving out of the way, activates his medallion, bringing forth a ring of blades from "

   Äs states there is nothing Byakuya can do, as there is no way he can win against his own Bankai using his Shikai. Renji attempts to intervene using his own Shikai.
   While Renji attacks, Byakuya attempts to use his Shikai against the Quincy, who counters with a storm of blades. The storm of blades is so powerful, it sends Byakuya crashing into a nearby wall.
   As Byakuya asks Renji and Rukia to forgive him, his Zanpakutō breaks into pieces, and he passes out from his wounds.

Knowing he will succumb to his wounds soon, Byakuya admits to Ichigo he is ashamed of letting the enemy invade Soul Society, and regrets letting them kill many Shinigami, causing them, their subordinates, and their families to suffer. Despite Ichigo being a Human, who should not be involved in the affairs of Soul Society, Byakuya asks Ichigo to protect Soul Society.
   After Ichigo leaves, Byakuya thinks about the Substitute Shinigami's lack of a reply, noting that it is typical of him and he understands. He drops his Zanpakutō, which disintegrates.

   He takes the longest to heal among all who visited there, as well as the longest anyone has been in the hot springs, according to Kirinji.

   Äs begins mocking Byakuya for his previous defeat at his hands. Äs then unleashes his attack on Byakuya, only for the captain to repel with a more solid construct of his Shikai. When Äs believes it to be Byakuya's Bankai, he corrects the Quincy, explaining that during his loss of Bankai, he sought to obtain a deeper and more refined understanding of his Zanpakutō, and Byakuya thanks his opponent for it. Taking this as an insult, Äs becomes infuriated and determined to drive Byakuya into the deepest levels of fear, transforming yet again. Byakuya calmly turns his attention to Rukia, applauding her for growing so strong. Insisting that fear is only a choice, he helps Rukia overcome her immobilizing  fear and entrusts Rukia with finishing Äs.

   When Hitsugaya unsuccessfully tries to assist Kenpachi, Byakuya tells him that taking part in that clash is pointless. However, Hitsugaya replies that Gerard was not someone Kenpachi could take on alone as evidenced by him removing his eyepatch.

   Kenpachi suddenly activates Bankai and undergoes a transformation, which creates a large blast and startles Byakuya.
   Byakuya and Hitsugaya watch him in awe, with Byakuya noting that Kenpachi did not even seem to have a conscious demeanor. Byakuya and Hitsugaya see Kenpachi jump far away, and they look behind them in shock to see Gerard reforming himself into one piece again. Byakuya and Hitsugaya are nearly hit by a blast from Gerard's sword

   The attack destroys Gerard's head, and Hitsugaya finishes off Gerard by freezing and shattering his torso. Byakuya then catches Hitsugaya as he collapses, noting that the captain pushed his body to its limits in Bankai. Suddenly, Byakuya and Hitsugaya become engulfed in energy rising up to regenerate Gerard.
   As this happened, Renji and Rukia emerge and talk to Hitsugaya. Unable to recognize him, Rukia states that he is Hitsugaya's older brother, which Hitsugaya does not attempt to deny, and Byakuya notes that he is not even trying.

   Soon afterward, when Gerard attacks Renji and Rukia, Byakuya grabs them and moves them to a safer location before telling them to join Ichigo in his battle with Yhwach. When Rukia begins to protest, Byakuya tells her to not think too highly of herself and proceeds to block another strike from Gerard with his Bankai before claiming that he has no need for either of them here, prompting Rukia and Renji to thank him before leaving. Byakuya appears next to Hitsugaya and claims that he carefully chose his words so Rukia and Renji would see the underlying meaning when Hitsugaya points out that they noticed his concern. Listening as Hitsugaya explains how the Shin'o Academy teaches Shinigami to fight for their friends and humans, Byakuya notes that deciding what is right and wrong is a very Shinigami-like teaching.

   However, the Shinigami receive information of Yhwach's Reiatsu manifesting in the West 55th Block, and Byakuya races there. Suì-Fēng accompanies Byakuya and tells him that Rukia left Soul Society, but Byakuya is fine with Rukia taking a break and says that he will deal with the problem himself. Byakuya and Suì-Fēng then reach Mayuri and see the remnants of Yhwach's Reiatsu and brace for an attack. However just as the Reiatsu grows in strength it randomly vanishes without a trace, shocking the three captains.

    ): Byakuya's Bankai is a much larger version of Senbonzakura's Shikai. To activate it, Byakuya drops his sword straight down; the sword does not have to be completely intact for Byakuya to activate his Bankai, as he can simply drop all the pieces at once with both hands.
    The sword phases into the ground, as though it were a pool of water. Energy ripples expand out, turning the surrounding area dark, and within seconds, two rows of a thousand giant blades rise up from the ground. Those thousand swords scatter, and countless flying blades pierce the enemy. No one knows the exact number of blades generated, and no one can dodge or even see the movements of these blades.
    The number of blades is great enough that Byakuya can simultaneously use them for offense and defense. He commonly forms them into large masses to obliterate opponents instantaneously. As they move through the air like torrents of waves, they give the appearance of cherry blossoms flowing swiftly along the wind.
    Senbonzakura Kageyoshi's defensive use allows Byakuya to cover himself entirely in these tiny blades, forming a body shield.
    Unlike his Shikai, his Bankai is mentally controlled. While Byakuya can control the blades with his mind alone, using his hands allows him to do so more effectively, making the blades move twice as fast.
    Similar to his Shikai, its attack is triggered with the phrase

   Shūkurō Tsukishima
   explained, the trick to avoid Senbonzakura's blades is not to retreat, but to get closer.
   Although Byakuya can compensate this weakness by allowing the blades to enter the Hurtless Area, since it is the range in which he can safely react and redirect missed attacks, by increasing the speed of the blades
