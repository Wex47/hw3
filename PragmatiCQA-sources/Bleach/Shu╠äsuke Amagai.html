   While under the guise of being an ally, Amagai is a rather friendly and easy-going individual.  While he seems rather loyal and law-abiding, he is willing to bend or break the law if it means helping someone find the truth.
   Decisive, charismatic, and ethical, he quickly proves to be a capable leader and earns the respect of his subordinates, most notably Lieutenant

  <p key="1091eeb0-b62a-433f-9439-d5715d4431b1">
   Amagai has a very low alcohol tolerance, collapsing even after eating sake-flavored pickles and acting irrational after smelling the scent of sake in the air.
   Although he is initially looked down upon by his fellow division members, Amagai's methods and ethics eventually earned their respect. Amagai also favors teamwork and coordination between individual fighters. He used these methods in the Patrol Corps and teaches them when training his squad.
  </p>
  <p key="43e2424a-867e-4950-b0e2-831334e71d6a">
   Amagai's true nature is more deceptive and ruthless. He manipulated all the events that transpired behind the entire Kasumiōji ordeal with an almost callous disregard for the lives of the people involved. He displays a determined, almost stubborn, desire to kill Captain-Commander
   Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto
   for murdering
   his father

   For many years Amagai trained in order to take his revenge upon Yamamoto. During those years, he also gained the trust of the Kasumiōji Clan and was given his Bakkōtō by
   Gyōkaku Kumoi
   . He eventually made his way into the
   Patrol Corps
   and rose through their ranks.
   After Gin Ichimaru's defection from Soul Society, Amagai eventually took over the position as captain of the 3rd Division. During his captain's exam, he fought Captain

        During an official Captains' meeting, Amagai is introduced to his new peers as the new 3rd Division captain, where Captain
        Jūshirō Ukitake
        tells Amagai that he can ask him for advice anytime. After leaving the meeting, he heads over to meet his new subordinates and introduces

        , and asks Izuru Kira if it would be alright to make him 3rd seat. Though the squad members have difficulty accepting him, he states that as long as he is their captain, he will always protect them. Later, Amagai attends a welcome party for him and Kibune. Izuru pours him a drink of sake and suggests that Amagai make a toast. Amagai reluctantly downs his drink, becoming drunk before passing out shortly afterwards. Kibune explains Amagai's low alcohol tolerance and that he likely drank it to help break the tension between him and the division.

       <p key="706b6eaf-f3f1-4cc6-99d0-bbd66985aee1">
        Later, after his squad has already left to deal with a threat in the

        , Amagai appears and destroys the cleaner with his tuning fork weapon. Afterwards, he ponders what might have reactivated the seizing currents, as he believes that the

        would not have made that mistake. He then congratulates Izuru on his leadership, stating that he was expecting those actions from someone who managed to keep his squad together for so long without a captain. He then passes out again, still drunk from the party.
        Some time later, Amagai has the division doing some labor and chores around the

        After the meeting ends, Amagai returns to the 3rd Division's headquarters and is greeted by Izuru, who reports that he saw Kibune entering the Kasumiōji Clan's manor and that he already asked Kibune about it. He states that Kibune denied having any interaction with the clan and also that Kibune acts suspiciously. Amagai is surprised by Izuru's report, stating that he was not aware of this behavior. When Izuru links the timing of Ichigo's arrival and Kibune's recent actions, Amagai cuts him off, saying that even if Kibune does have ties with the Kasumiōji Clan, it does not necessarily mean there is a link between him and Ichigo's intrusion on the Kasumiōji Clan's manor. However, he agrees that the timing seems peculiar and wonders if something greater is occurring behind this incident. He orders Izuru to watch Kibune closely. Afterwards, they meet up with the rest of the 3rd Division and move out to capture Ichigo and Rukia.
        The 3rd Division is later ordered to remain on standby, and Amagai rejoins them. The next day, Izuru reports that Kibune went missing, as well as
        one of their guards

        Amagai finds Ichigo and Rukia outside the manor. Unable to talk their way out of the situation, Ichigo prepares to fight Amagai. The captain orders his subordinates to stay out of the battle, as he is interested to see Ichigo's strength first-hand. They skirmish briefly, , but before the fighting can grow dangerous, Shū Kannogi steps in and pleads for them to stop fighting. Amagai asks why Shū is protecting his kidnappers, to which Shū explains that he actually went with Ichigo and Rukia willingly. He further states that they saved Rurichiyo's life and that the Kasumiōji Clan is in trouble. Amagai agrees to stop and orders his division to stand down. After listening to their story, Amagai informs them that they need a starting point in order for the Gotei 13 to become involved with the Kasumiōji Clan. Ichigo states that they do have a lead: the Bakkōtō. He also tells them that they've been trying to rescue Rurichiyo, as the one at the wedding was an impostor, and that they are trying to convict Gyōkaku Kumoi. Amagai offers to help them search for Rurichiyo and orders his subordinates to inform Izuru of the recent turn of events.

        Amagai and a small contingent of the 3rd Division assist Ichigo, Rukia, and Shū in searching ares of Seireitei associated with the Kasumiōji Clan.

He explains that he'd rather deal with him himself instead of getting the other squads involved.

Amagai's presence surprises Kumoi to the point that he lowers his blade from Rurichiyo's throat. Seeing that Kumoi is distracted, Rurichiyo makes her way over to Ichigo. However, before she can reach him, Amagai stabs his Zanpakutō between them and blocks their path. As Kumoi attempts to retake his hostage, Amagai cuts him down. Shocked by Amagai's behavior, Ichigo asks Amagai why he did this and Rukia states that with Kumoi dead, they would be unable to uncover his true intentions. Amagai gathers the nuclei of the Bakkōtō within the room. He thanks Ichigo for his assistance and throws the papers tucked in his uniform, causing a green sphere of energy to form.

Yamamoto then unleashes his Zanpakutō and proceeds to engulf the entire area in flames but Amagai stabs his weapon into the ground, dissipating the flames. Amagai explains that his Bakkōtō's power negates a Shinigami Zanpakutō's special abilities, before activating his Bankai, destroying the building around them. As Rurichiyo, Enryū, and Kenryū emerge from the rubble, Amagai threatens to go after Rurichiyo first.

Amagai explains that he spent years training to defeat Yamamoto, eventually obtaining a Bakkōtō from the Kasumiōji Clan, and finally worked his way up through the ranks to become captain.

Before doing so, he apologizes to Izuru for all the trouble and tells him that he enjoyed his time with him and the 3rd Division. As a form of memorial, his Zanpakutō and captain's haori are placed on a hill overlooking the Seireitei.
