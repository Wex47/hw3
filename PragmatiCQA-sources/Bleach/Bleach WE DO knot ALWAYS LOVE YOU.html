   Renji and Rukia invite their close friends to a restaurant at the eastern end of the Noble District and announce that they're going to get married. Everyone congratulates the pair, but Renji and Rukia are bewildered that no one seems to be surprised by the announcement. Everyone, except

   notices the excessive design interior around them, and the waiter explained that Byakuya instructed that the interior design be altered despite Rukia having only made reservation this morning, shocking them. At the same time, Renji and Rukia realized how Byakuya fully blessed their marriage as opposed to his seemingly indifferent attitude when they first informed him of their intention to marry, making the couple feel relieved.

   One week after the marriage announcement, Rukia informs Byakuya that she and Renji will go to fill the marriage registry. However, Byakuya has their maid, Chiyo, explain that in cases of marriages involving the four noble clans it is compulsory to submit a document to the Kinnin noble assembly and several other complicated procedures, leading Rukia and Renji to visit various places to submit their marriage documents.

   Before going to the Noble Assembly, Rukia and Renji are invited by Byakuya to have breakfast with him at the banquet hall. Renji feels nervous since the hall is so quiet. The tension is lifted once Rukia tasted the food served for her, prompting Byakuya to tell her that she is welcomed to eat here at anytime she wants. When Rukia expressed her gratitude, she and Renji are shocked to see Byakuya smiled before Byakuya left after he was done affixing his seal on the documents.

   After breakfast, Rukia and Renji are led to adjoining room for adjustment for the wedding clothes. To Renji's confusion, the servants also tell him to enter and is presented with a kuromontsuki and haorihakama, which were ordered by Byakuya. Rukia remembers that on the evening when they informed Byakuya about their intention to marry, Byakuya asked if Renji has ceremonial suit to wear. Since Rukia expected Renji doesn't have one and told Byakuya about it, Byakuya prepared one for Renji.

   Checking the montsuki, Renji notices a camellia crest, which represents the 6th Division attached on it. The servants explain that Byakuya had them to use the crest because Renji doesn't have a family crest. Rukia thinks that Byakuya is being considerate of Renji, but Renji corrects her, saying that Byakuya prepared the clothes while hoping that Rukia won't get awkward walking next to him, emphasizing how Byakuya does everything for her.

   At the Noble Assembly, Rukia and Renji finally submitted their marriage registry and received certificate of marriage acceptance, officially becoming husband and wife with Rukia's surname changed to "Abarai". Despite the change in her name, Rukia declined to change her Gotei soldier registered name as she thought there was a real danger that her mind would get distracted if person after person that encountered her called her 'Abarai.’ Byakuya, who accompanies them, asks Renji to take care of Rukia. Before Renji can give a proper reply, Byakuya reveals he has made arrangements for them to announce their marriage at the captains' meeting in the afternoon, shocking both Rukia and Renji who immediately afterward return to the

   At the captain's assembly hall, Rukia and Renji once again announce their marriage to the captains who all are already aware from various sources. While congratulating the newly wed couple, Shunsui mention about the ceremony, confusing Rukia and Renji since they haven't made any plan, only to learn that Byakuya has already made preparation without consulting them. Byakuya reasoned that he knew how complicated the marriage procedures for the four noble clans were due to his experience with his late wife,

   continue sewing the veil. Karin comments that Yuzu seems like she's having fun, which Ichigo agrees with. He then asks how Karin feels, to which she answers that she's also happy since Orihime quite reminded her of their mother. They are interrupted when Yuzu and Orihime have finished preparing dinner, which is Orihime's handmade potato salad omelette gratin hot-pot. Ichigo and Karin are hesitant to eat it, but once the whole family and Orihime proceed with their dinner, it was said that the pot of food was immensely delicious.

   On the wedding day, the ceremony is held at the Kuchiki clan's ceremonial shrine. Orihime is nervous attending the ceremony since she's afraid that she may act discourteous as she doesn't know Soul Society's customs, but Uryū assures her that most people in attendance also know nothing about ceremony. As the ceremony begins, Rukia enters with Byakuya. Orihime is touched when seeing Rukia wearing the veil that she and their friends made, causing her to be unable to hold her camera properly, which leads to Ichigo taking over for her to take photos. As Byakuya and Rukia reach Renji, Byakuya whispers his wish for her to be happy before giving her to Renji, which brought Rukia to tears. The priest recited the ritual, and after the couple exchanged sake cups, all the marriage rituals were completed.

Shunsui adds that he didn't give the haori until today because he was waiting for Rukia's heart to grow and be ready to bear the responsibility of taking leadership over a division. Before leaving, Shunsui also gives Rukia his own celebratory gift.
