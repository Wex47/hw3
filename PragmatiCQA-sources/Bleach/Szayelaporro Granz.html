   Szayelaporro is a tall and thin male Arrancar. He has shoulder-length pink hair with bangs on the right side of his forehead, with two thin lines missing hair on the left side of his head and amber eyes. The remains of his

   Even after having the entire upper half of his body exposed, no number tattoo is visible.
  </p>
  <p key="272e0ae4-ea29-467d-87d0-8d1f8fca8c79">
   His clothes differ from the original Arrancar uniform. Instead of a normal jacket, Szayelaporro wears a long shirt that covers his entire torso up to the top of his neck. He has three stripes on his uniform, each starting at his collar with two running to each side of his chest and one down the middle. He wears the regular pants with a slight length taken away. He also wears white gloves. His face is the only part of his body that is exposed in this uniform.
   After he changes his clothes, he sports a cape-like garment.

  <p key="655864ba-6186-4a55-8049-e66afe4c2745">
   When he was demoted from the Espada sometime in the past, his appearance was slightly different. His hair was messier and all three lines on his uniform dropped to his right hip, instead of to the left, right and middle.
   His outfit extends to his ankles, resembling a lab coat.

   , Szayelaporro's appearance was dramatically altered. His left eye and mask fragments are missing and his Hollow hole has moved outside his body to form a ring behind his back, while his left arm has been reduced to charred black bones emanating a dark, smoke-like substance. Four thin vertical lines fall across his left cheek below his eye socket while chain-like tattoos wrap around his head and torso, with one of the links encompassing a new hole in the center of his chest. His body is dripping with darkness in various shapes around and below the waist, and he wears half of a cloak covering his right side, with the rest being clothed in the same darkness, as well as black boots. At will, he can also sprout a curving pair of ram-like horns from either temple of his head, drawing blood in the process.

  </h2>
  <p key="8dca8c8b-2be6-48c7-abcf-3d0ec0369566">
   Szayelaporro is a meticulous intellectual, the "scientist" of the Espada. He is highly narcissistic and extremely flamboyant, tending to make lewd, disturbing comments about his opponents. Szayelaporro is quite ruthless, cruel, and sadistic, viewing others as little more than research material. He thinks poorly of non-Hollows, hoping Aizen will someday wipe all non-Hollows out of existence. He thinks of himself as an actor, treating his battles like theatrical performances, especially when toying with his victims.
  </p>
  <p key="ae7cdde0-217a-4edc-af7a-3a75764a599c">
   Szayelaporro is rather cocky and somewhat unstable, as he has a tendency to laugh maniacally whenever he has the upper hand in a battle. In addition, he removed the seal on the powers of his opponents when he believed that they had no chance of winning.
   He also changed the appearance of his opponents' clones to better suit his idea of 'beauty', despite this action allowing his foes to easily distinguish the clones.
  </p>
  <p key="b3bf81f5-f2f4-4d2d-8e33-aa556d66ef82">
   He seems to have had a less-than-positive relationship with his older brother, Yylfordt. While he did try to heal him after his battle with Renji, he refers to Yylfordt's death as Renji merely breaking a box of parasites, saying he would not be so childish as to be upset over that.
  </p>
  <p key="e3f4cfab-18d2-41f8-9145-2f1aa33c19e7">
   He rather arrogantly boasts he is a "perfect being," since he can reproduce himself in another person's body and thus views himself as immortal.

  <p key="f66a1753-1b02-4a63-9d72-e9696997e397">
   Sometime in the past, Szayelaporro helped
   Nnoitra Gilga
   perform a sneak attack on
   Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck
   . In order to help him do this, Szayelaporro used a device that created an illusion of Nnoitra which distracted Nelliel's attention. By exploiting the opportunity, Nnoitra attacked Nelliel and she was hit from behind, causing a wound to her head and her mask to break on the front left side. The attack scarred her forehead and left her unconscious.
   He took her unconscious body and stated that she would probably call this an act of a beast, but it didn't matter any to him. He was approached from behind by Szayelaporro, who asked if there was anything else he could help him with, to which Nnoitra responded that his job was already over. Szayelaporro asked him if he needed to be so cold as they worked as partners, for that he should at least be allowed to admire their end. Nnoitra detailed that he doesn't remember being his partner and that they just happened to have the same motives. Nnoitra threw Nelliel off the side of
   Las Noches
   so that he could increase his power by the time she returned.
  </p>
  <p key="d07cce36-c6e6-4285-8b8f-dd82169e9f76">
   Nnoitra told Szayelaporro they were going, but Szayelaporro told him that he would appreciate it if he lost the presumptuous tone. Nnoitra reminded him that he wasn't an
   Espada
   anymore. Szayelaporro stated that if not for the equipment that he prepared Nnoitra wouldn't even have had the chance to attack Nelliel and then asked if he should really be speaking to him that way. Nnoitra looked over the side of Las Noches at Nelliel and her Fracción's prone bodies and was surprised as she reverted into a child. Szayelaporro noted that he had not anticipated this and he had never seen anything like it before. He deduced that her Reiatsu was leaking out of the wound on her mask, causing her spiritual body to shrink as a result.

Renji threateningly looks at him and Szayelaporro tells him to calm down, explaining that he doesn't have high combat abilities despite the fact that he's an Espada. He then goes on to explain exactly who he is until Renji tells him that he doesn't want to hear his life story and that he came here to defeat his enemies.

   Renji tries to activate his Bankai, but it disappears as Szayelaporro says he knows everything about it and is able to nullify it. Renji is confused, not knowing how Szayelaporro could know his Bankai, but Szayelaporro explains his brother is
   Yylfordt Granz
   , shocking Renji. Szayelaporro thanks him for remembering his brother, but then goes on to explain that the reason he targeted him isn't for revenge. He states that he put spirit recording insects on Yylfordt, allowing him to know everything that he knew. He then tells Renji that he has no way to win and he unsheathes his Zanpakutō. He explains that he's excited since this is the first time he has fought a Bankai user and he tells him to keep his body as intact as possible.

   Renji tries to attack again, but Szayelaporro stops it, saying he is now bored with Renji and sends his
   Fracción
   out and explains that he modified them.
   As
   Medazeppi
   throws Renji around, Lumina and Verona ask to join in, but Szayelaporro tells them not to interfere. Renji finally manages to hurt Medazeppi and Szayelaporro commends him for lasting this long, but states that now things are going to be problematic as there's no controlling Medazeppi now. Medazeppi goes on a rampage and Szayelaporro states that it's a shame that by the end of this Renji's body won't be in perfect condition.

Szayelaporro states his full name and rank to him, but Uryū doesn't believe he's a threat due to his low number. Szayelaporro counters by saying that he's still stronger than him, but then asks Uryū who he is. Uryū states that he's a

   he would be shouting "suerte" right now. As this is happening, Uryū immediately appears behind Szayelaporro and tells him that he feels like shouting "suerte" as well because he has gotten to fight an opponent who is full of openings. He then shoots a
   Seele Schneider
   at Szayelaporro.
   The Seele Schneider pierces his throat, but soon disappears as Szayelaporro laughs maniacally, telling Uryū that he used the data on his fight with

Szayelaporro manages to get up and back away, however, Uryū appears behind him and states that he noticed Szayelaporro's habit of putting distance between him and his opponent. Szayelaporro counters him, saying that Uryū has a habit of attacking people from behind. Szayelaporro then asks him if he thinks he's won and Uryū tells him he has. Five Seele Schneiders surround Szayelaporro, holding him in place. Szayelaporro says that Uryū's Reiatsu should have been sealed, but Uryū states that not even Szayelaporro knows everything and activates

He then grabs Lumina and begins to eat her, to which Verona complains, but Szayelaporro tells him to be quiet. Healed, he begins to walk off, saying he is going to change his clothes. He tells Uryū to think of a plan as he will be thinking of one too.
   After Renji and company unsuccessfully try to run away, Szayelaporro greets them, having changed and come back.

A black liquid spews forth from Szayelaporro, causing clones of his opponents to appear when they touch it. Szayelaporro explains that these clones contain all of their abilities and that the limits on their powers have been removed.
   As they battle the clones, they notice there are differences between the clones and originals, but Szayelaporro says he did it on purpose as he did not like any of their styles. Renji activates his Bankai and his clones follow suit, resulting in the destruction of the room they are in. Szayelaporro appears and tells them that the person who has to report this to

   Uryū and Renji both attack Szayelaporro with their full power at the same time, but two large Hollows appear in front of Szayelaporro, guarding him from the blows. Szayelaporro then consumes Uryū with one of his wings before spitting him out. He then thanks him for the meal as one of the strands of his wings becomes engorged and bursts with purple liquid, creating a small doll of Uryū. Szayelaporro holds up the doll and states that this will now be Uryū. He then touches the doll's head, which Uryū feels, and Szayelaporro explains that he has control over all of his senses now. He then flicks the doll's head, slightly injuring Uryū. Szayelaporro decides to then rip the doll in half and Renji begs him to stop. However, he does so anyway, but with no effects to Uryū. Szayelaporro tells him that he's foolish in thinking that something would happen if he ripped the doll in half. He then shows that what he really wanted to do was to get to the body parts inside the doll. He takes out a small piece that reads "stomach" on it and breaks it, causing Uryū to cough up blood. As Renji angrily attacks him for what he did, he too is eaten by one of Szayelaporro's wings. He continues saying that Humans, Shinigami, and Quincy are all the same and if there's any reason for them to be killed by Aizen, it would be because of their inferiority.

   Mayuri Kurotsuchi
   arrives and Szayelaporro asks him who he is. However, Mayuri feels that he doesn't need to answer this question and is more excited about the Arrancar and Espada living in Hueco Mundo.
   Szayelaporro tells Mayuri and Uryū to stop arguing with each other and asks Mayuri who he is again, but decides he does not need to know. However, Mayuri tells him that not being able to hear his name puts him in a difficult situation since he won't be able to properly label him when he bottles him up. Szayelaporro simply laughs at this statement.

   Later, Mayuri is panting heavily and seemingly losing the battle.
   Szayelaporro holds a Mayuri doll and crushes his organs, sending Mayuri to his knees in pain. However, Mayuri suddenly stands up and says "gotcha". Szayelaporro continues to destroy body parts, but to no effect. He asks Mayuri how he can stand his attack and Mayuri reveals that he had been monitoring Uryū and shortly before leaving for Hueco Mundo, he replaced his organs with dummies. Szayelaporro says this is impossible as he only just revealed his ability, but Mayuri says if it were impossible, he could not have done it. In retaliation, Szayelaporro grabs Nemu and he tells Mayuri that he's a fool for letting his underling get captured, but Nemu tells him that capturing her doesn't make her a hostage. Szayelaporro begins arguing with her and Mayuri is annoyed by all the noise going on. Mayuri decides to activate his Bankai,

   Szayelaporro explains to Mayuri that he will always be able to resurrect himself and that death has only become another part of his life cycle, making him the perfect being. He tells Mayuri that no matter what he does there is no way for him to win. Mayuri simply walks past Szayelaporro and goes up to Nemu. Szayelaporro thinks that Mayuri is saddened to see his subordinate dying, but Mayuri simply smiles at him and says he has an interesting ability. He then mocks Szayelaporro asking if that's all he can do. Szayelaporro then has

   Afterwards, the 12th Division captain remarks that it is time to check out his new drug. Szayelaporro gets into a battle stance, but Mayuri tells him that there is no need as the "drug" has already taken effect. He explains to him that he has placed several drugs within Nemu's body in case her body was ever eaten or invaded. The place where Szayelaporro was reborn from had a drug he calls the superhuman drug. He tells him that everything should feel as if it's going incredibly slow right now and asks if it looks like his blade has stopped. He then tells him that one second should feel like a century and that his non-superhuman body will fall terribly behind his superhuman senses causing the movements of his flesh to be left behind. Mayuri then stabs Szayelaporro's hand and says that the pain should last for over a hundred years. He continues bringing his Zanpakutō closer to Szayelaporro's heart as he looks on.
   After experiencing centuries worth of time, Szayelaporro wonders how much longer it will be until the Zanpakutō pierces his heart and begs for his death to come quickly. The Zanpakutō then goes through his heart and he dies.

Wrapping a chain around Renji's foot, Szayelaporro inquires about whether Renji needs to leave already since he came all the way out here just to see Renji on this momentous day. While Szayelaporro admits that he was just flattering Renji by claiming this and muses that Uryū and Mayuri are not here either, something he decides to not take as a slight, Renji hides his daughter
   Ichika Abarai
   behind his legs and questions if Szayelaporro looks different now because he is dead. In response, Szayelaporro confirms that he was cast into Hell and explains how it has let him cast aside his Hollow yoke so his hole is no longer bound to his flesh and his hate and suffering can pour out of his brain like tears, punctuated by two curving horns growing out of his temples.

Szayelaporro resurrected himself with Nemu’s body, using his Gabriel technique, but in the anime, it was completely redone so that it could be toned down. Instead of him laying his egg inside of her and emerging head first from her mouth, he is resurrected from an embryo that emerges from Nemu's mouth and develops into him. Also, Nemu does not end up looking as dried up or decrepit as she does in the manga.

     "Do you understand what I am telling you? Using this ability, I am able to impregnate myself into my enemies, and thus I can be ever reborn into a new body. Just as the Phoenix, the immortal bird, engulfs itself in flames once it reaches old age and is reborn, its life begun anew, from the midst of those flames. Do you realize now? Immortality. This is its most absolute form. One does not attempt to escape death, but accepts it as one's due, and allows life's cycle to continue, not allowing that death to bring an end to one's own existence. Eternally repeating that cycle of death and rebirth, an existence such as this... truly, mine is what may be called a 'perfect existence'! For one such as me, the concept of 'death' as an end to life simply holds no meaning. You may kill me, but in defiance of the finality of death, I will simply arise once more. Now do you understand? It is impossible for you to truly kill me. As such, you have no means to achieve victory in this battle."
