  <p key="da98e0eb-f98d-4710-91bb-5c6e093fb386">
   Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end. He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to wear slim fitting clothes.
   He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number.
   Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin.
   When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami attire, with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.
   It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.
   Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including

   .
   After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends.
   After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.

   Seventeen months after defeating Aizen, Ichigo's overall appearance does not change, but he becomes taller again and grows sideburns.
   After regaining his powers, seemingly caused by remaining energy from his Fullbring,
   Ichigo's Shinigami attire consists of a thicker strap across his chest. He has four black vertical lines on his forearms and black, tattoo-like bands crossing over his chest, wrists, and ankles. Similar bands, but with white ends, lie around his neck as collars.

   and a white cloak with black markings tied around his waist.

  <p key="7cc730ce-79d5-44dc-9cdc-ce1bc474f9b4">
   When he was younger, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world, always smiling when he was with Masaki and regularly holding her hand.
   Despite crying whenever he lost in a match at the
   dojo
   he attended, Ichigo started to smile again as soon as he saw Masaki when she came to pick him up.
   At a very young age, Ichigo heard his father saying his name means "to protect one thing," which instilled in him a desire to protect his mother. When his sisters were born, he began attending a dojo for the sake of protecting them. Since then, the number of people he wishes to protect has continued to grow, causing Ichigo to risk his life to protect both the people close to him and complete strangers.

  <p key="0f785862-060c-45ee-a914-3efb0bdc2ca6">
   As a teenager, Ichigo is stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive.
   Despite claiming not to care about what other people think about him, he attempts to maintain a detached and "cool" image.
   He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together.
   His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. He coldly refers to his teachers as "instructors".
   He is genuinely compassionate and empathetic towards others, promising to bring a

   Ichigo is a capable student, ranked 23rd in his year at school, who studies regularly and does not neglect his schoolwork.
   He works as hard as he does to overcome the misconceptions many have about him based on his hair color and fighting.
   Ichigo hates fortune telling, horoscopes, feng shui, psychics, and anyone whose trade involves taking money from people for things they cannot see.
   He has difficulty remembering people's faces and names.
   However, Ichigo can remember the names of noticeable individuals even when they did not directly tell him their names.
   Ichigo becomes extremely shy and uncomfortable around nude or immodestly dressed women, a fact both

   Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, which can impede his fighting prowess, and goes into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major battle or lets a friend down.

        When Ichigo, at Masaki's grave, apologizes for not being able to avenge her, Isshin notes the time has gone by quickly, and it has already been ten years since Masaki died. When Ichigo corrects his error, Isshin states he was "so close". When Ichigo loudly complains about this, Isshin says Masaki can rest easily if she sees him being so lively. When he starts smoking a cigarette, Ichigo says he thought he quit smoking when Karin and Yuzu were born. Isshin explains he smokes on this one occasion, as the only time Masaki complimented his looks while they were dating is when she saw him smoking.
        When Ichigo asks why nobody blames him for her death, Isshin, dismissing the suggestion, says Masaki would be mad at him, and she would gladly die to protect her child. Reminding Ichigo he is the one the woman he loved gave her life to protect, he, telling him to live his life well, leaves. Asking Rukia if her powers are returning, Ichigo asks her to allow him to remain a Shinigami for a while longer regardless. He says he wants to become stronger so he can defeat Hollows, protect those who are targeted, and defeat Grand Fisher; otherwise, he will not be able to face Masaki.

When she tells him to complain later, as there is a Hollow, Ichigo tells her he will not forgive her if it is not there this time, but they find nothing.

When Ichigo, angered by this, demands to know why he is exposing the town's residents to such danger, Uryū tells him not to worry, as they will kill all the Hollows.

Later, as Ichigo wonders how long he has been in the hole for and how he can get out of it, Jinta runs down the shaft's wall with a platter of fruit for him. When Ichigo, denying he is hungry, says the chain is still long, Jinta reveals it has been seventy hours since he entered the shaft, and the final corrosion phase is stronger than the earlier ones. As the remaining length of the chain begins to corrode, a hole opens in Ichigo's chest, and a mask begins to form over his face.
        Urahara explains the mask forming before his body reforms shows Ichigo is resisting the transformation.

As the world crumbles around him, he instructs Ichigo to find it.

Urahara starts the third lesson, which is simply to knock the hat off of Urahara's head. As Ichigo proposes a five minute time limit, Urahara draws a blade from within his cane.

        After completing Urahara's training, Ichigo has a relatively normal summer holiday while waiting for the gate to Soul Society to be opened. On the first of August, Ichigo and his friends gather for a fireworks festival, where they catch up. Isshin and the twins, running up to Ichigo, knock him down a bank. When Ichigo asks if they are drunk, Isshin reveals a juice seller used wine to dilute their juice instead of water. Telling the group they saved a seat on the opposite bank of the river that morning, Isshin heads off with the girls and several of Ichigo's friends.
        Later that night, after complaining to a drunken Isshin about having to carry his sisters, Ichigo tells him he will be leaving soon, and he might not be back until the summer vacation ends.

        Seven days after completing his training, Ichigo is summoned to the Urahara Shop. As he leaves, Ichigo says goodbye to his sisters. Isshin lends him an amulet, which he claims Masaki gave to him, stating it will bring him good fortune. On his way to Urahara's, Ichigo meets up with Orihime. Revealing he did not know she was going until Urahara mentioned it, Ichigo asks her if she is sure about it. When they arrive at the shop, they find Sado waiting for them, and Ichigo, asking where Uryū is, says he had heard he was coming too. When Uryū, arriving in a Quincy outfit, promises to show Ichigo how powerful he has become, Ichigo criticizes him for walking the entire way there wearing that outfit. Interrupting them, Urahara invites the group inside.

In the second stage, his remaining Reiatsu stabilizes, he wakes up, and the remainder of his spiritual power completely disappears.

As he calls Ichigo an anomaly, saying since he cannot create a Reigai of him he is getting rid of a variable, Ichigo, swallowed by the portal, is trapped inside the Dangai.

Later, Ichigo talks with Renji, Ikkaku, and Yumichika, who want to question Nozomi, as they know too little about her. When Ichigo asks them if it is not enough that he protects her, he is told the Gotei 13 captains were defeated by Inaba's invasion force, which they will now have to face in Karakura Town.

Congratulating her, Ichigo, telling her to show it to Isshin, asks where he is.

As Ichigo glares at him, Kūgo reveals a Fullbringer is a person who had a parent who was attacked by a Hollow before their birth. Traces of the Hollow's powers remain in their mother's bodies and are passed on to them at birth. These powers are more like Hollow than Shinigami powers. He further explains Fullbringers do not enjoy their powers, similar to the way Ichigo hated his Hollow powers. Kūgo says he wants to erase his powers, and they have learned they can pass their powers on to someone who possesses both Human and Shinigami powers. Ichigo realizes he was not the first person born from a Shinigami and a Human.

Later, Ichigo is called back to Xcution's hideout, where Riruka uses her Fullbring to miniaturize and place him inside a doll house. Ichigo is confronted by
        Mr. Pork
        , a stuffed animal, which he is instructed to defeat by using Fullbring.
        Mr. Pork, which has a yakuza man trapped inside it, attacks, forcing Ichigo to take evasive action. Shrugging off Riruka's complaints, Ichigo, saying he does not even understand the situation yet, asks how this will help him regain his Shinigami powers, and how he can suddenly use a power he has never used before. The yakuza says if he does not kill Ichigo within fifteen minutes, he will be trapped there permanently. After giving a brief explanation of Fullbring, Riruka leaves Ichigo, who, reflecting on what she said, thinks about how Kūgo transformed his pendant into a sword, concluding he should focus on something he regularly has with him. Arriving, Sado tells Ichigo to use his Substitute Shinigami Badge. Telling him he had just thought of it too, Ichigo holds his badge as the fifteen minutes expire and Mr. Pork, entering "Mad Beast Mode," grows in size.

Ichigo wonders if the power will help him get his Shinigami powers back.

Kūgo advises him not to push himself, as his body will fall to pieces if he wears himself out. Saying a few more days without his powers should be bearable after all this time, he promises to call him when he has recuperated. As Sado and Ichigo walk to Sado's home, the latter tells Ichigo Orihime has been bringing him leftover bread everyday lately. Ichigo tells him she is worried about him, and he should call her.

        After Tsukishima and Kūgo leave, Ichigo is
        stabbed in the back by Rukia
        with a special sword containing the Reiatsu of the Gotei 13's senior officers and other Shinigami. Ichigo emerges from the resulting explosion with a new Shinigami outfit and a slightly altered Zangetsu, ready to
        fight
        . Greeting Ichigo, Rukia, momentarily berating him, reveals Urahara told her about Tsukishima's ability. Reassuring him about this, she explains about the sword Urahara made to restore Shinigami powers to Ichigo. Returning, Kūgo, disputing this, is cut off by the arrival of more Shinigami. Rukia tells Kūgo he only stole a small portion of Ichigo's power, which had Ichigo's Fullbring, and Ichigo's Shinigami powers well up from deep inside; he could never take that from him. Ichigo fires a

        before asking if it was a crime to transfer Shinigami powers to a Human. As Renji reveals Captain-Commander Yamamoto ordered all captains and lieutenants to put their Reiatsu into Urahara's sword to help bring back Ichigo's Shinigami powers, Hitsugaya tells him he did this because Ichigo was able to change Soul Society through his actions, and he should accept it proudly. As Ichigo notices Kūgo emerging from the dust below, Hitsugaya tells Ichigo Yamamoto also gave the order to stop the original Substitute Shinigami, Kūgo Ginjō.
        When Ichigo is confused about this, Hitsugaya, reminding him of when Ukitake gave him his badge, tells Ichigo the Substitute Shinigami law was created solely because of Kūgo before stating they need to focus on Kūgo right now. Thanking Ichigo, Kūgo says if he had not taken his powers, he would have been dead by now.

        After Kūgo grants the other members of Xcution part of Ichigo's Fullbring, Ichigo attacks them all. Using his Fullbring, Yukio, deceiving Ichigo, protects the Fullbringers from harm.

        is now able to influence the world outside his console.
        After Yukio uses his Fullbring to split everyone up into individual rooms, Ichigo and Uryū find themselves facing Kūgo in a replica of Karakura Town, an environment which Kūgo says he picked so Ichigo could fight easier. When Ichigo asks if Uryū is hurt, the Quincy, saying Rukia healed him, apologizes to Ichigo, saying when he first saw the Substitute Badge, he had thought there were other Substitutes before him. He thought if the previous one was alive, they would have told Ichigo, and if he was dead, they would have said why, leading Uryū to believe Soul Society did not know. Kicking Uryū, Ichigo tells him it does not matter, as they could not have done anything anyhow, and he would have forgotten in a few days. The two momentarily bicker before returning their attention to Kūgo.

        as well, surprising Ichigo. Uryū explains Kūgo, in addition to taking his Fullbring and Reiatsu, must have taken Ichigo's full abilities as well.
        As Kūgo and Ichigo continue to fight, Kūgo asks him what he is fighting for, which confuses Ichigo. Kūgo confirms Tsukishima is dying, and if a Fullbringer dies, all traces of their ability disappear. He asks Ichigo what he is fighting for, but when Ichigo does not answer him, Kūgo informs him of an enemy he

        When Ichigo dismisses this as an attempt to shake his resolve. Kūgo, stating the Substitute Shinigami Badge is given out whether the Substitute in question is beneficial to Soul Society or not, explains it has no authority, and its true purpose is to observe and restrict Ichigo's Shinigami powers while he has it with him. When Kūgo says this scheme was designed by Ukitake to control Substitute Shinigami, an enraged Ichigo releases his Bankai, which shatters the pocket dimension.
        Dismissing Kūgo's words, Ichigo says he knew Ukitake was not trying to mislead him. After Kūgo activates his Bankai, the two clash.
        Eventually, Kūgo's sword breaks, and he, badly injured, slumps to the ground, unable to continue. As Tsukishima tries to attack Ichigo, Riruka blocks the attack with her body instead.
        Sometime after the fighting ends, he is at Urahara's shop, waiting for Riruka to wake up so he can make sure she is okay. He tells Riruka none of the other Fullbringers have been found.

        Ichigo goes to Soul Society to acquire Kūgo's body so he may bury it in the Human World. Upon arriving at the First Division, he finds the captains waiting for him. He is told to go inside the building by Kensei, whom he is surprised to see in a captain's uniform. After informing Yamamoto of his request, he dismisses Captain Hirako's words about forgiving Kūgo, stating his friends and family are back to normal, and calls Kūgo a "mere Substitute Shinigami." Yamamoto notes he must have thought carefully about using that phrase. Afterwards, Ichigo is asked about his Badge, but he, stating he trusts them, keeps it.

        After being pushed back by an energy attack from Yhwach, Ichigo glares at him as Yhwach questions why he did not have Orihime heal him before he came here.

When Aizen successfully tricks Yhwach into believing he has killed him, Ichigo impales Yhwach from behind before unleashing a powerful

However, Yhwach is interrupted when Uryū fires the silver arrowhead through his chest, to the surprise of both him and Ichigo. Yhwach's darkness suddenly clears from his body as he briefly loses his powers, prompting Uryū to tell Ichigo to move now. With his cracked Bankai in hand, Ichigo leaps toward Yhwach, who is beginning to regain his powers and seemingly shatters the blade in his hand.

She replies that he is probably upstairs, and Ichigo wonders if Yuzu is fine with him being in her room, which she affirms. Ichigo then asks Rukia and Renji about their child coming, and after realizing she has disappeared, Rukia flippantly guesses that she is getting into fights.

   : According to both Aizen and Urahara, Ichigo's most astounding ability is his growth rate; he grasps the basic control of advanced techniques in days where it would take several years for even the most gifted Shinigami. Shortly after gaining Shinigami powers and with no previous training, he began learning advanced spiritual energy sensing techniques by sheer instinct. While it takes most Shinigami at least 10 years to achieve Bankai, he did so in two-and-a-half days (albeit with the assistance of a special device invented by Urahara which was originally intended for

   days).
   He gains considerable experience in the use of Shunpo while training with Yoruichi, which was done over the same period as his Bankai.
   Besides his improvements in his Shinigami abilities, Ichigo greatly increased the time he could maintain his Hollow mask, from eleven seconds to considerably longer amounts of time. During his first fight with Ulquiorra, he is instantly incapacitated by one Cero blast, even with his Hollow mask (which broke within a second), but only a few hours later, he withstands another Cero from Ulquiorra without undergoing Hollowfication, and can analyze Ulquiorra's movements much better than before, when he had "felt like [he] was fighting a machine or a statue" and failed to predict and counter his attacks.
   His latent abilities have been recognized by the

   : Despite his somewhat punkish attitude, Ichigo is analytical, perceptive, and deductive. In his high school, Ichigo's grades are almost always near the top, despite his work as a Substitute Shinigami. Aside from that, Ichigo can determine the pattern of his opponent's battle methods and form a proper counter-strategy to defeat his opponent's attacks.

   His spiritual power is noted to be heavy, which surprised Renji Abarai.
   Ichigo constantly gives off Reiatsu at the level of a captain.
   Even when worn-out in battle, he can continue fighting effectively while still using

   His energy is strong enough to hold back the Sōkyoku, a halberd with the destructive force equivalent to one million Zanpakutō combined, using only his Zanpakutō.
   Even before his Dangai training, his spiritual energy was strong enough for him to be able to sense Aizen's increased Reiatsu as a result of his Second Fusion with the Hōgyoku while fighting Gin from a considerable distance away, despite his father, Urahara, and Yoruichi, all former

   His Reiatsu is golden yellow in color.
   After his training at the Soul King Palace, Ichigo was able to overwhelm four Sternritter simultaneously
   and then calmly fight on par with a Sternritter using

    Spiritual Awareness
   </b>
   : Since he was a child, Ichigo has had an innate ability to clearly see spiritual beings and sense their presence. After becoming a Shinigami, his senses have continued to improve with time, learning various advanced sensing techniques, such as using a spirit ribbon to find Yūichi Shibata (in bird form).
   Even from a considerable distance, he can detect the condition of a being with spiritual power. During his intense fight against Kenpachi Zaraki, he clearly sensed and recognized Sado's energy signature even as it weakened, despite the considerable distance between them.

    Master Swordsman
   </b>
   : In terms of fighting style while in his Shinigami form, Ichigo relies mainly on swordplay. Aside from his initial training with Urahara, he is essentially on a "learn as you go" training regimen; thusly, his skill has developed by fighting rather than formal instruction, becoming even more capable with every fight. His overall skill allows him to fight evenly against sword masters of Byakuya Kuchiki and Kenpachi Zaraki's caliber. While usually fighting right-handed, Ichigo appears to be ambidextrous, as he is proficient in wielding Zangetsu in his left hand.
   Since attaining the true form of Zangetsu, he has displayed great skill at wielding both blades at once without any trouble.

   </b>
   : Though not particularly versed in its various techniques, Ichigo is proficient enough in the technique itself to keep up with and even surprise high-level Shinigami with his speed. Byakuya Kuchiki, one of the most proficient users of Shunpo in Soul Society, complimented Ichigo's growing mastery of the technique.
   During his first demonstration of this skill, he knocked out three lieutenants and grabbed his Zanpakutō before any of them hit the ground.
   After returning from the Soul King Palace, Ichigo has refined his skill in Shunpo, moving several miles in a single leap while simultaneously bypassing the perception of multiple Sternritter.

    Enhanced Strength
   </b>
   : When he is in his Shinigami body, Ichigo's already impressive strength is greatly enhanced. He has knocked out three Shinigami lieutenants with a single punch each, one of which shattered one of their Zanpakutō at the same time.
   His strength is great enough to easily stop repeated axe blows from
   Jidanbō
   before shattering Jidanbō's axes in a single swing, and hurl Rukia a dozen meters into Renji's arms and send them both skidding several meters more, achieving both feats with a single hand.
   With a single kick, he can break down and launch a large chunk of a stone wall.
   After regaining his Shinigami powers, one swing from his Zanpakutō produced a shockwave powerful enough to overwhelm

   When fighting Quilge Opie, Ichigo grabbed one of his Heilig Pfeil with his bare hand without sustaining any damage, despite the considerable explosion it caused when Ichigo threw it back.

    Immense Endurance
   </b>
   : When in his Shinigami form, Ichigo's endurance is strengthened to the point where he can continue fighting effectively after receiving many injuries, and can survive attacks which would easily kill normal Humans. It was stated by Rukia that a Shinigami's life force is their spiritual power. As such, Ichigo can withstand attacks which would be fatal to most Shinigami.
   Uryū once stated Ichigo was a monster in this regard,
   and Aizen commented on his ability to continue moving despite grave injuries.

   : Ichigo becomes much more durable in his Shinigami form. During his last fight with Kūgo Ginjō, he withstood a direct hit from the Getsuga Tenshō created by his opponent, and the damage was only done to one of his arms and part of his face.
   When fighting Quilge Opie, Ichigo withstood the impact of several Heilig Pfeil fired at him, unharmed, despite the powerful explosion each one caused.
   Tenjirō Kirinji, a member of the Royal Guard, was amazed at Ichigo's ability to endure the unique healing properties of his

    , using an actual Asauchi. In his inner world, Ichigo, coming to terms with his heritage and powers, gains access to his true Zanpakutō, which had been suppressed all this time. His actual Zanpakutō takes the form of two separate, purely black
    blades. One is the size of his previous sword, once again in the shape of a khyber knife, with the grip at the base of the blade and a handle extending back from this about roughly the width and length of Ichigo's forearm. There is a thin, hollowed-out portion running along the back edge of the blade from the base to the middle of the blade. The second blade is relatively small, about the size of Ichigo's arm, and is similar to the first blade, but resembles a trench knife more than a sword. Unlike its counterpart, it has an enclosed handle, with a portion acting like a hand guard. Both blades represent a different facet of Ichigo's powers: the larger blade represents his

      ): When Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakutō was very similar in appearance to Rukia's sealed Zanpakutō
      but oversized, with an equally-oversized brown sheath hung by a strap across his back and over his right shoulder. It had a rectangular bronze tsuba with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short sides. The hilt's handle had a red wrapping and two light blue tassels attached to the handle's base, which was decorated with a flame design on its short sides. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he did not know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It could upturn the ground with a single strike.
      Because of the weak nature of its spiritual energy,

      subsequently sliced it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form. This sword is a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of Ichigo's own power.

        : The Shikai form of Zangetsu resembles an oversized
         khyber knife
         instead of a formal katana. It has no tsuba and no proper hilt; what Ichigo holds is the cloth-wrapped tang. The sword is about as tall as Ichigo is,
         and has a black blade with a silver edge. The cloth wrapping on the tang seems to react to Ichigo's will, changing length at a thought or twining about the blade in an impromptu sheath. When in combat, the cloth falls away when necessary, shrinking back to a manageable size.
         The cloth can be used to swing the weapon like a
         flail
         and to toss it at opponents for mid-range combat,
         as well as bandage wounds,
         but these are done rarely. Ichigo has, on more than one occasion, used Zangetsu's wide blade as a shield from incoming attacks,

         It is considered completely out of the ordinary for any Zanpakutō. Unlike most Bankai forms, which usually create some sort of massive creature or effect, Ichigo's Bankai shrinks his sword down to a
         daitō
         (Japanese long sword) with a black blade instead. The cross guard has four prongs bent out to form the shape of the manji (which is the kanji for "ban," meaning "full," as in "full release"). The blade itself can endure even the strongest of attacks, making it quite effective in blocking and deflecting incoming attacks.
         It can withstand getting crushed by force.

         Instead of the cloth his Shikai form had, a short length of chain with a broken link at the end dangles from the base of the hilt. In addition to his sword, Ichigo's robe is replaced with a long-sleeved, ankle-length black coat (or shihakushō) with red lining, which is closed at his chest and left to flare out into ragged ends, much like that of Zangetsu himself.
         This coat is part of Ichigo's Bankai, and the damage it can take is directly proportionate to the remaining strength and level of Ichigo's Reiatsu.

       Initially, Ichigo's Fullbring powers focused on changing the form of his Substitute Shinigami Badge.
       By recalling the memories of his pride as a Shinigami, Ichigo causes the badge to release black Reiatsu in the shape of the tsuba of

       Like a tsuba, the weapon is used primarily for defense, particularly to block attacks. It can absorb most of the impact from a much larger opponent's attack.
       Like a real tsuba, it has no cutting power, and if Ichigo releases his hold on the badge, the Reiatsu dissipates.

      <p key="d27ebd30-9b4b-4bfc-8c4d-0d3f622e0f56">
       Later, his Fullbring powers evolve so they change his appearance, covering his whole body in a black Reiatsu, and produce a dark blade, forming over his arm.
       His abilities are classified as a Clad-Type Fullbring because Ichigo is shrouded in his own power, which resembles a Shihakushō, much like his former Bankai.

       After Ichigo's Fullbring is completed, it transforms into a solid outfit. It becomes a white armor covering his chest, arms, shoulders, and feet, with a stripe running across his face. Underneath this, he wears a completely black bodysuit. The badge grows a medium-sized, black, machete-like blade, with a silver edge, round hilt, simple white cloth-wrapping, and flat base. The badge itself becomes the guard, with a new black cross marking on it. It is hung across Ichigo's back in a white sheath.

        By charging up this attack, the tsuba becomes bigger and more jagged, with six bars, before launching a larger blast.
        The attack is flawed, due to its inconsistent power. Its power is determined by the number of blades in it, six being the maximum. If fired in succession, the number of blades decrease, with the attack becoming more fragile with each one it loses. If the attack has anything less than three blades, it can be shattered with ease.

        both conclude if he fires three shots in a row, he leaves himself wide open to attack.
        With his completed Fullbring, Ichigo can produce the Reiatsu tsuba from his sword's guard-badge and fire a barrage of these blades with a single swing, with each one apparently retaining full power, as none lose any blades. Similar to

        Ichigo can draw on the souls of concrete and solid air in order to propel himself higher and at faster speeds.
        With his complete Fullbring unleashed, Ichigo's speed is enhanced even further, as he got behind Tsukishima and cut off his left arm before he could even attack him.
        Similar to his Bankai, Ichigo's speed is great enough to produce dozens of afterimages to confuse his enemy.
        By focusing this power into a single leg, Ichigo can launch a much faster kick with much greater impact.

       Ichigo's mask has changed again. Where his mask once had a series of thick red stripes which covered almost the entire left half of his mask, there are now only two thick vertical black stripes, each on one half of the mask, which are interrupted by the widened eye-holes and the jaw.

       The Hollow mask was originally a sign of Ichigo's possession by his inner Hollow, but after his training with the Visored, it merely indicates he is utilizing his Hollow powers. To access his inner Hollow's power, Ichigo must summon the mask onto his face. He normally does this by placing one of his hands over his face, and concentrating spiritual matter on it in order to manifest the mask (previously, it had appeared on its own before he mastered the Hollow within him), summoning the mask in a "ripping" fashion. With the mask in place, Ichigo's eyes irises become yellow, and he has black sclera and pupils. His voice has a slight Hollow echo to it. With the mask, he gains access to increased physical enhancements. Strangely, though most of the other Visored have been able to shift the position of the mask while apparently still retaining the abilities of their Hollowfied state, as well as using general Hollow abilities, Ichigo has never done either.
