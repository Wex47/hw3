  <p key="e43214ac-0fe0-45fa-a02c-ea2d68516ade">
   Aizen is a polite, soft-spoken intellectual, often addressing his subordinates by their given names.
   He rarely shows any sign of alarm or distress, and often has entire situations planned out well in advance. Whenever confronted, Aizen is casual and uncaring, attempting to draw out a conversation and make small talk, which often infuriates those he is talking to.
  </p>
  <p key="9c99b3e3-67e0-4d15-bd17-80c8a014b930">
   Aizen initially appeared to be a very kind, well-respected captain and was looked up to by many, especially his lieutenant,
   Momo Hinamori
   .
   However, this was just a mask to disguise his manipulative, and very dangerous, nature.
   In truth, he cares very little for his underlings, and is willing to use almost everyone around him as pawns to achieve his goals. He is willing to stop at nothing to further his ambitions, including manipulating or killing anyone if he deems it to be necessary.
   He frequently toys with his underlings for amusement.
  </p>
  <p key="1a632095-fb32-4732-b00e-a17ca7b6302a">
   During his time as a captain, Aizen liked

   , but he disliked boiled eggs. In his free time, he often read, and he gave a special lecture of
   calligraphy
   at the
   Shin'ō Academy
   because he excelled in this branch of arts. This optional course was immensely popular among the Shinigami students, and many of them felt great sorrow at Aizen's sudden departure.

   Aizen keeps more rowdy individuals like
   Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez

   The Arrancar
   Aisslinger Wernarr
   claims the Arrancar follow him because he has no fear, something which beings born from fear and despair find inspiring.

   invasion
   by Ichigo and his friends and their successes within Las Noches, which Aizen himself confirmed,

   battle of Fake Karakura Town
   .
   In contrast,
   Kaname Tōsen
   has shown no such understanding, and has fallen victim to one of Aizen's more minor mind games when Aizen subtly manipulated him into punishing Grimmjow for him while Aizen himself kept up his appearance of benevolence.

   before he subdued the
   Hōgyoku
   . Aizen admits his new powers allow him to let his guard down.
   Due to this newfound power, Aizen has developed an arrogant and overconfident attitude, often not even thinking his attacks or defense through any longer like he used to, or even bothering to find out the effects of his opponents' and his own attacks. In his newest form, he has developed a severe superiority complex, believing he is now above both

        Aizen and his subordinates left an unconscious
        Rangiku Matsumoto
        a short distance away.
        Aizen eventually caught Shinji's attention, and was promoted to a lieutenant in order for Shinji to watch over him closely,

        110 years ago, Aizen made his way to the 5th Division living quarters of his captain. He and Shinji discussed style and trends before they made their way to the promotion ceremony being held at the
        1st Division
        headquarters. As they got there, he witnessed
        12th Division
        Lieutenant
        Hiyori Sarugaki
        attack his captain, and watched as the two got into a childish argument. He followed behind while the other captains congregated and had a brief discussion on the status of the
        Gotei 13

        8th Division
        Captain
        Shunsui Kyōraku
        mention that the previous captain of the 12th Division was promoted, Aizen interrupted and asked Shunsui what he meant by this. When Aizen initially conjectured that the promotion was to
        Central 46
        , Shunsui explained it had nothing to do with the Central 46 and revealed the previous 12th Division captain,
        Kirio Hikifune

        The following night, after Urahara's appointment as the new captain of the 12th Division, Shinji had a short talk with him about his new role as captain. While leaving, Shinji
        revealed
        Aizen, who had been concealed behind
        camouflage
        . Complimenting his captain, Aizen asked Shinji when he sensed him there. Stating he had known ever since Aizen was in his mother's womb, Shinji ordered Aizen to follow. Noting his disapproval, Aizen commented on how scary a person Shinji was, prompting Shinji to say that Aizen was the scary one.

When Shinji said he already made it known he had suspected him, Aizen reveals Shinji did not realize Aizen was not the one walking behind him for the past month. Explaining the power of his

        , Aizen informed Shinji he would have been able to see through Aizen's deception by picking up on subtle differences between Aizen himself and Aizen's double if he was as close to Aizen as other captains were to their lieutenants, but it was his lack of trust which kept them from getting close and allowed Aizen to fool Shinji. Stating he could have always refused to be Shinji's lieutenant, Aizen revealed he decided against this action because his captain's skepticism made the position ideal to carry out his plans. When Aizen stated Shinji was to blame for his current predicament and his comrades' plight, Shinji was provoked by this, triggering a speed-up in the Hollowfication process. Thanking Shinji for being so easily provoked, Aizen noted the observed connection between Hollowfication and agitated emotions. Ordering Tōsen to cut down 12th Division Lieutenant
        Hiyori Sarugaki
        , Aizen thanked Shinji for helping him and raised his blade overhead in preparation to cut Shinji down, only to be attacked by Urahara, who cut Aizen's lieutenant badge off.

        Aizen and Urahara had a brief discussion about what was transpiring, with Aizen acting innocent at first until Urahara noted the investigation team did not have simple injuries, but were in fact undergoing Hollowfication. Commending Urahara on his deduction, Aizen revealed himself to be behind the disappearances in the Rukongai. Leaving the scene of the crime with Gin and Tōsen, Aizen said that there was nothing more to do there. When Tessai fired

        He later made Gin his lieutenant.
        Continuing to experiment on Hollows to transform them into Shinigami, Aizen created Hollows which were close to Shinigami, such as
        Metastacia
        , and
        Menos
        capable of concealing their
        Reiatsu

        At some point during their captaincy, Aizen, Gin, and Tōsen secretly visited

        Las Noches

When Aizen asked Baraggan if he was happy in his position and if he would join him in a new world where he would be granted more power, Baraggan dismissed this notion and stated there was no power higher than his. Releasing his
        Shikai
        , Aizen showed Baraggan the decimation of his army, thus subjugating him in turn. This created great enmity between Aizen and Baraggan, who promised to seek Aizen's destruction for all eternity.

        Sometime after the Hollowfication Incident and during his and
        Isshin Shiba
        's time as captains, he, Gin, and Tōsen were still working on their Hollowfication experiments and attempting to locate Shinji's group. He told his co-conspirators to remain patient and reassured them everything would go as planned.

       <p key="5011ab8a-61ea-401c-b2ed-7cf7e326b503">
        Soon after this, Aizen and his two comrades watched the fight between Isshin and
        one of their Hollow creations
        on a monitor, with Aizen wondering why Isshin was present in
        Naruki City
        . When Tōsen stated Isshin did not report that he was going and Gin said this could cause them immense trouble, Aizen, intrigued by this interesting turn of events, referred to Isshin's arrival as an unexpected harvest and asked if it was possible for him to watch the battle at a closer distance. Later, when he arrives at the scene of the battle with Gin and Tōsen, the three of them wearing Reiatsu-concealing cloaks, Aizen cut down Isshin from behind.
        Commenting on the quality of Urahara's cloak and how simply kneading

        into it will let the wearer blend into the air, Aizen prepared to leave, stating that Isshin would not be able to use Bankai in his current state and that the Hollow experiment was a failure if a captain could take it out using only their Shikai. After Tōsen expressed his desire to call the sample "White" because this was their first experiment based on a Shinigami's soul, Aizen said it was ironic to call the Hollow "White" because of its inner whiteness while its outside was completely encased in black. After observing the fight for a time, Aizen and his cohorts noticed the involvement of
        a Quincy
        in the fight, which surprised the three of them. When Tōsen decided to eliminate her, Aizen stopped him from killing her and eagerly stated they should see what happens next.

        Following
        White
        's defeat and destruction, Tōsen expressed his shock and frustration at the events, calling it a failure. Calming him down, Aizen said that the results were interesting and expressed curiosity on how events would further unfold.

Drawing his sword, Aizen attacks Renji, but Renji is able to draw his sword in time to dodge Aizen's attack, leaving only his right arm damaged. Applauding his ability to dodge, Aizen expresses happiness with the improvements in Renji's skill because he was one of Aizen's subordinates.

When Renji attacks Aizen with his Shikai, Aizen blocks it with his bare hand and easily cuts the segments of the blade apart while also cutting up Renji. When Renji refuses to give up Rukia, Aizen prepares to kill him, only to be stopped by Ichigo.

   Calling the Espada to a meeting, Aizen invites them to have some tea.
   As they are drinking their tea, Aizen reveals to them the presence of Ichigo, Uryū, and Sado. When the Espada begin to dismiss the group as not dangerous, Aizen warns them to not underestimate the trio and reveals their exploits in Soul Society. When Aizen identifies Orihime as the missing member of their group and states they have come to rescue her, Grimmjow begins to leave and states he is going to go eradicate the threat in Aizen's name. Stopping him, Aizen resorts to intimidating Grimmjow with his Reiatsu when the latter hesitates to back down. As Grimmjow is brought to his knees by Aizen's immense Reiatsu, Aizen tells the other Espada to return to their palaces and wait patiently. Telling them not to be overconfident, Aizen says they do not to be afraid because no one can defeat them as long as they are with him.

Confirming this, Szayelaporro leaves. Following his departure, Gin, who had been present in with Aizen the entire time, asks Aizen if he is enjoying himself even though his subordinates are losing, prompting Aizen to confess the emotion he is feeling at the moment is akin to enjoyment.

Using this, Aizen reveals his true motivation behind the capture of Orihime to Ichigo and the others: by kidnapping Orihime, he inspired Ichigo and his friends to attempt a rescue, thereby depriving Soul Society of a valuable military asset, and when four captains assisted in her rescue, adding to the three which had already defected, Soul Society was left at half its regular strength, so he and his forces are now ready to attack.

Revealing he told them to come with him, but he has never told them to trust him and has told them to not trust anyone, including himself, Aizen laments there are not many strong enough to do that.

        , which ruptures the ground around them and forms a large energy dragon in the air above as he rushes forward. Despite this, Yhwach merely points out that Aizen's sword is cracked before sending him hurtling back with an energy blast. When Aizen, disguised as Ichigo, appears behind him with

        and blowing a hole in Ichigo's torso, Yhwach prepares to destroy Soul Society; however, Aizen, having been impaled by Yhwach's hand, merely notes that Yhwach's vision of Ichigo attacking him is interesting as the real Ichigo impales and attacks Yhwach.

        Ichigo defeats Yhwach soon afterward, and Aizen is later imprisoned again and bound in another chair. Ten years later, Aizen senses that the last remnants of Yhwach's Reiatsu have disappeared. He recalls Yhwach's final words about how his defeat meant the continuation of death and the fear accompanying it, but reflects that in such a world people would never have the hope and the courage that kept death at bay.

    citizens who bore Shinigami potential needed to be sacrificed to it, but it still was not satisfied. According to the experimental data, Urahara's Hōgyoku was also incomplete, so Aizen decided to steal this Hōgyoku and present it to his own.

    research, this Hōgyoku is what gave the

Those infected experience great sickness and fatigue until they vomit up a white liquid, which forms the beginnings of their Hollow mask before proceeding to transform their bodies and warp their minds. Other than this, all which is known is the process is accelerated by aggressive emotions.
    The conclusive result turns a Shinigami into a primarily Hollow-like humanoid, which is a highly unstable transformation causing mindlessness and aggression.

     Hollow Research and Development

    Aizen gave Hollow powers to a Shinigami, namely
