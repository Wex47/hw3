  <p key="9032a6ea-dcfa-4926-919d-98507c6f5e26">
   Aizen is a polite, soft-spoken intellectual, often addressing his subordinates by their given names.
   He rarely shows any sign of alarm or distress, and often has entire situations planned out well in advance. Whenever confronted, Aizen is casual and uncaring, attempting to draw out a conversation and make small talk, which often infuriates those he is talking to.
  </p>
  <p key="dcbf6858-bc5d-4c61-949b-0a8990d4e88b">
   Aizen initially appeared to be a very kind, well-respected captain and was looked up to by many, especially his lieutenant,
   Momo Hinamori
   .
   However, this was just a mask to disguise his manipulative, and very dangerous, nature.
   In truth, he cares very little for his underlings, and is willing to use almost everyone around him as pawns to achieve his goals. He is willing to stop at nothing to further his ambitions, including manipulating or killing anyone if he deems it to be necessary.
   He frequently toys with his underlings for amusement.
  </p>
  <p key="2d5fadb3-4b60-481a-a36c-8e12f3824c1d">
   During his time as a captain, Aizen liked

   , but he disliked boiled eggs. In his free time, he often read, and he gave a special lecture of
   calligraphy
   at the
   Shin'ō Academy
   because he excelled in this branch of arts. This optional course was immensely popular among the Shinigami students, and many of them felt great sorrow at Aizen's sudden departure.

   Aizen keeps more rowdy individuals like
   Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez

   invasion
   by Ichigo and his friends and their successes within Las Noches, which Aizen himself confirmed,
   and noting Aizen was surprised by the arrival of Momo during the
   battle of Fake Karakura Town
   .
   In contrast,
   Kaname Tōsen
   has shown no such understanding, and has fallen victim to one of Aizen's more minor mind games when Aizen subtly manipulated him into punishing Grimmjow for him while Aizen himself kept up his appearance of benevolence.

   before he subdued the
   Hōgyoku
   . Aizen admits his new powers allow him to let his guard down.
   Due to this newfound power, Aizen has developed an arrogant and overconfident attitude, often not even thinking his attacks or defense through any longer like he used to, or even bothering to find out the effects of his opponents' and his own attacks. In his newest form, he has developed a severe superiority complex, believing he is now above both

        Central 46

        The following night, after Urahara's appointment as the new captain of the 12th Division, Shinji had a short talk with him about his new role as captain. While leaving, Shinji
        revealed
        Aizen, who had been concealed behind
        camouflage
        . Complimenting his captain, Aizen asked Shinji when he sensed him there. Stating he had known ever since Aizen was in his mother's womb, Shinji ordered Aizen to follow. Noting his disapproval, Aizen commented on how scary a person Shinji was, prompting Shinji to say that Aizen was the scary one.

Stating he could have always refused to be Shinji's lieutenant, Aizen revealed he decided against this action because his captain's skepticism made the position ideal to carry out his plans. When Aizen stated Shinji was to blame for his current predicament and his comrades' plight, Shinji was provoked by this, triggering a speed-up in the Hollowfication process. Thanking Shinji for being so easily provoked, Aizen noted the observed connection between Hollowfication and agitated emotions. Ordering Tōsen to cut down 12th Division Lieutenant
        Hiyori Sarugaki
        , Aizen thanked Shinji for helping him and raised his blade overhead in preparation to cut Shinji down, only to be attacked by Urahara, who cut Aizen's lieutenant badge off.

        Aizen and Urahara had a brief discussion about what was transpiring, with Aizen acting innocent at first until Urahara noted the investigation team did not have simple injuries, but were in fact undergoing Hollowfication. Commending Urahara on his deduction, Aizen revealed himself to be behind the disappearances in the Rukongai. Leaving the scene of the crime with Gin and Tōsen, Aizen said that there was nothing more to do there. When Tessai fired

When Aizen asked Baraggan if he was happy in his position and if he would join him in a new world where he would be granted more power, Baraggan dismissed this notion and stated there was no power higher than his. Releasing his
        Shikai
        , Aizen showed Baraggan the decimation of his army, thus subjugating him in turn. This created great enmity between Aizen and Baraggan, who promised to seek Aizen's destruction for all eternity.

        Sometime after the Hollowfication Incident and during his and
        Isshin Shiba
        's time as captains, he, Gin, and Tōsen were still working on their Hollowfication experiments and attempting to locate Shinji's group. He told his co-conspirators to remain patient and reassured them everything would go as planned.

       <p key="a354dd40-c2ad-4189-bb73-fea14f363a82">
        Soon after this, Aizen and his two comrades watched the fight between Isshin and
        one of their Hollow creations
        on a monitor, with Aizen wondering why Isshin was present in
        Naruki City
        . When Tōsen stated Isshin did not report that he was going and Gin said this could cause them immense trouble, Aizen, intrigued by this interesting turn of events, referred to Isshin's arrival as an unexpected harvest and asked if it was possible for him to watch the battle at a closer distance. Later, when he arrives at the scene of the battle with Gin and Tōsen, the three of them wearing Reiatsu-concealing cloaks, Aizen cut down Isshin from behind.
        Commenting on the quality of Urahara's cloak and how simply kneading

        into it will let the wearer blend into the air, Aizen prepared to leave, stating that Isshin would not be able to use Bankai in his current state and that the Hollow experiment was a failure if a captain could take it out using only their Shikai. After Tōsen expressed his desire to call the sample "White" because this was their first experiment based on a Shinigami's soul, Aizen said it was ironic to call the Hollow "White" because of its inner whiteness while its outside was completely encased in black. After observing the fight for a time, Aizen and his cohorts noticed the involvement of
        a Quincy
        in the fight, which surprised the three of them. When Tōsen decided to eliminate her, Aizen stopped him from killing her and eagerly stated they should see what happens next.

        Following

When Renji attacks Aizen with his Shikai, Aizen blocks it with his bare hand and easily cuts the segments of the blade apart while also cutting up Renji. When Renji refuses to give up Rukia, Aizen prepares to kill him, only to be stopped by Ichigo.

As the wound he sustained from the attack closes up, Aizen reveals he has placed the Hōgyoku, which instinctively heals its master, in his chest. Complimenting Ichigo's Reiatsu, Aizen states Ichigo has grown as he had planned, surprising Ichigo. Listing various important occurrences in Ichigo's development, Aizen claims they all happened as he desired.
        When Aizen explains how he found Ichigo to be the perfect subject for his research, Ichigo says Aizen must be lying because of what he said in Soul Society. Revealing he was lying back then, Aizen begins to say why he thought Ichigo would be perfect, but is interrupted by the arrival of Isshin, who states Aizen has said too much.
        When Isshin moves Ichigo away, Aizen notes this was a smart move.
        When Aizen asks Gin how long he has been watching, Gin states he did not see an opportunity to help. Attacking Aizen, Isshin

        Saying the Hōgyoku possesses a will of its own and he only became aware of this after becoming its master, Aizen reveals the true power of the Hōgyoku is not removing of the boundaries between Shinigami and Hollow, but capturing and materializing the hearts around it. Claiming it has brought about the events surrounding Ichigo, Rukia, and Urahara, Aizen states Urahara misunderstood the nature of the Hōgyoku because the breakdown of the barrier between Shinigami and Hollow was his own desire. Claiming Ichigo, Sado, and Orihime all got their powers from the Hōgyoku, Aizen explains more about it before being interrupted by Gin knocking Ichigo into a nearby building. As Ichigo talks to Isshin, Gin asks Aizen if he interrupted his speech. As Aizen says he had reached the end of his speech, his body is enveloped by the Hōgyoku.

Questioning his statement, Aizen says he must be unable to admit defeat. Retracting the question, Aizen impales Urahara and tells him he has already lost the chance to command the Hōgyoku.

        Soon afterward, as black creatures begin pouring into the Seireitei, Aizen is brought to the surface, and the other Shinigami notice his presence as his Reiatsu begins crushing the creatures. Aizen mocks the Shinigami for trying to destroy the creatures with their Zanpakutō before instructing them to crush them with Reiatsu as he is doing.
        Upon seeing the shocked faces of Rukia and Renji, Aizen mockingly greets them and congratulates Rukia for being promoted to the role of lieutenant within the 13th Division, suggesting it was good that her abilities were finally being recognized. When Rukia becomes enraged about his presence, he calmly reveals that Kyōraku had released him.

        When the argument between the other members of the Gotei 13 subsides, Aizen politely asks Kyōraku to undo the seals binding him to the chair but Kyōraku insists that he cannot do that, which causes Aizen to query why he won't. When Kyōraku reminds him that he is only permitted to remove three of Aizen's seals, the former Captain sighs, commenting that he is expected to stop Yhwach from a chair, suggesting that he won't have the power to do this while restrained. Kyōraku asserts that he knows Aizen can do something about the monsters attacking and in response, Aizen uses

        Aizen gathers a dense amount of his Reiatsu around himself and shoots it towards the Soul King Palace, panicking many of the Shinigami, but the attack dissipates randomly about him. Kyōraku reveals that the chair was created to cap his Reiatsu. Mayuri comes forward, revealing that he created the chair, and other technologies like it, in order to keep criminals who currently can't be killed in check. He shows Aizen the object that he uses to control the chair, mocking him for thinking he could defeat the chair specifically designed to keep his power in check. Upon learning that the researcher is in control, Aizen challenges Mayuri in pitting his technology against Aizen's power to see which would win. However, Aizen is soon interrupted by the arrival of

        Five minutes later, Aizen recovers and converses with Shunsui about the Sternritter helping the Shinigami access the Soul King Palace. Upon realizing that those who stopped him are going to get to the palace before he can, Aizen notes Ichigo is a man who is hard to forgive.
        Having been left behind in Seireitei by the Gotei 13, Aizen watches with interest as fragments of

        Soul Society. Yhwach destroys Aizen's chair, releasing him of his bindings, and Aizen remarks on the amount of trouble Ichigo gave Yhwach in combat up in the Soul King Palace. Yhwach replies that Aizen was the one who was defeated by Ichigo, and Aizen thanks him for freeing him from his chair, as he now has the means to stop the Quincy Emperor. Yhwach questions why it would be in Aizen's interests to defend Soul Society, and Aizen replies that this has nothing to do with interests, but is only him repelling those who would try to rule over and control him. Their conversation is then suddenly interrupted as Ichigo and Renji Abarai attack Yhwach from behind.

        Ichigo defeats Yhwach soon afterward, and Aizen is later imprisoned again and bound in another chair. Ten years later, Aizen senses that the last remnants of Yhwach's Reiatsu have disappeared. He recalls Yhwach's final words about how his defeat meant the continuation of death and the fear accompanying it, but reflects that in such a world people would never have the hope and the courage that kept death at bay.

Those infected experience great sickness and fatigue until they vomit up a white liquid, which forms the beginnings of their Hollow mask before proceeding to transform their bodies and warp their minds. Other than this, all which is known is the process is accelerated by aggressive emotions.
    The conclusive result turns a Shinigami into a primarily Hollow-like humanoid, which is a highly unstable transformation causing mindlessness and aggression.

   Aizen can easily outmaneuver Ichigo's Bankai and Hollow mask-enhanced speed, to the point where he could casually lay a hand on Ichigo's chest and still dodge a point-blank attack.
   Aizen can dodge simultaneous attacks at close-range and evade Bankai-level techniques, even when being attacked from behind.

   Aizen's skill is of such a degree that he can fight against four captains (two of which used their Bankai) and four Visored (with three being former captains of Gotei 13) almost simultaneously and find openings to defeat them with one or two strikes each,

   : While preferring to finish his fights quickly with his Zanpakutō or Kidō, Aizen is a highly capable unarmed fighter. Repeatedly, Aizen has caught his opponent's weapons with a single bare hand.

      Cruel? Once a soul has become a Hollow, it holds no meaning. It is a being with no purpose beyond idly consuming its fellow souls. Where do you see cruelty in my giving purpose to such a being? Surely the true act of cruelty was your tearing that soul to pieces.

      I suppose it is only to be expected. You have my pity. There is no such thing as 'truth' or 'lies' in this world; there never has been. There is only plain, hard facts. And yet, all beings who exist in this world take only those 'facts' that are convenient to them, and take them to be the 'truth'. They do so because they know no other way to live. However, for those powerless beings that make up the majority of this world it is those 'facts' that are inconvenient for their own self-affirmation that make up the real 'truth'.

      The Hōgyoku is able to manifest the desires of those around it. However, this manifestation will not be successful unless the possessors of those desires have the strength to carry it out. In a way, its ability might be better termed a 'guiding force'. However, it is a peculiar quality of living beings that when it comes to achieving those petty desires that their crude hearts enshrine, they tend to have remarkable levels of success.

      Why not be careless? I no longer have any need to take care. I can feel it. Now that my body has subjugated the Hōgyoku, it has begun to far surpass even the capacity that I once possessed - a capacity that already held no equal in Soul Society. There is no longer any need for me to evade even a Kidō ranking in the nineties!
