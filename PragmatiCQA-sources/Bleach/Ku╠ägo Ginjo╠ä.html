   Kūgo is a tall and lean-built man with fair skin, brown eyes,
   and shoulder-length black hair that he keeps combed back, down to the nape of his neck. After being released from Tsukishima's Fullbring, Kūgo lets his hair become messy with strands hanging over his face. He wears black pants and a white sleeveless shirt, over which he wears a black jacket that has a fur-covered collar. He also wears a thin chain necklace that has an X-shaped pendant attached to it. After his fight with Tsukishima, he obtained a small vertical scar above his left eyebrow.
   When he was a Substitute Shinigami, his hair was much shorter and more unkempt.

   , intentionally doing so in front of Ichigo in order to get his attention.
   According to a member of his group, he is a charming individual that apparently talked them into following him. He claims that he carries ramen around with him because he likes it.
   He is very cautious and caring for his friends, as he warns them in the presence of a great danger,
   fights together with them and is ready to even sacrifice himself in order to save a comrade.
   He also appears to be very concerned about innocent people and in order to not involve them, he only picks the empty buildings if a battle were to occur.
   Sometimes, he can play the part of a bad guy for the sake of someone else's good, but he's far from being good at acting and instead ends up making a "cliched villain" out of himself.

  <p key="19ece2c3-dad7-4b73-8361-c593aedeee11">
   When not under the influence of Tsukishima's Fullbring, Kūgo is very malicious and sadistic, delighted at Ichigo's emotional and physical pain. He also becomes very arrogant, bragging about his accomplishments and underestimating his opponents,
   and ruthless, planning to kill a blindly loyal subordinate just because he has more potential than he knows and may cause a danger in the future.
   He becomes excited very easily, showing a psychotic smile whenever he is excited, and enjoys taking risks, such as leaving Ishida out of Tsukishima's victims to give Ichigo a chance of figuring out what was going on.
   However despite his cruel manipulations, he was willing to leave Ichigo alive after stealing his Fullbring
   , and later admitted he did not want to have to kill him after failing to recruit him.

Ichigo defeats the thief and returns the stolen bag to Kūgo, who thanks him and offers to buy him some ramen. Ichigo declines and leaves, prompting Kūgo to state how surprised he is of Ichigo's wariness as a Substitute Shinigami badge falls from his bag.
   Sometime later, Kūgo shows up at the Unagiya Shop asking whether
   Ikumi Unagiya
   or Ichigo would like some ramen.
   Despite both of them declining his offer, Kūgo sits down and eats the ramen anyway, enraging Ichigo with his boldness. He informs them that he actually is a customer looking for a shop that did odd jobs and says that him finding Ichigo there was just a coincidence.

   Ichigo later telephones Kūgo and they arrange to meet in Naruki City the following evening so they can talk. The next day, Kūgo greets Ichigo, who informs him that his friend was attacked and he wants his help, prompting Kūgo to inquire if Ichigo trusts him. When Ichigo mentions that he is probably not a normal Human, Kūgo says that he wonders about that and notes that Ichigo has nobody else to count on. After joking about his request to investigate Isshin, Kūgo reveals that he did that only to gain Ichigo's interest. Kūgo brings him into his group's hideout where the other members are waiting. He then informs Ichigo that they aim to restore his Shinigami powers.

When Riruka enters the room a surprised Kūgo asks if she found the person she was sent to look for. After a brief discussion about her inability to see well in the dark, Kūgo says he will introduce her once she and her companion are inside. As soon as she does this, Riruka's companion is revealed to be none other than

   When an agitated Ichigo demands to know what is going on, Kūgo tells him to calm down and explains the situation. Riruka demands to know if Ichigo is in fact the Ichigo Kurosaki they had been trying to recruit, but Kūgo tells her to wait. He asks Ichigo if he now understands what Fullbring is and explains that it is a power closer to Hollows than Shinigami. Kūgo states that they find this power troublesome and asks if Ichigo, having once had

He states that over the years of gathering Fullbringers, they realized that they can transfer their powers to a person who has the powers of both a Human and a Shinigami. By giving their powers to such a person, some of their old allies were able to become normal Humans. They want Ichigo to regain his Shinigami powers so they can become Human again. Kūgo explains that they found Chad, saying that he is one of them and he wishes to help restore Ichigo's powers. Kūgo assures Ichigo that his powers will return and they would add their own powers on top of them, resulting in Ichigo agreeing to help them.

   When Ichigo returns two days later, Riruka places him inside a doll house using her Fullbring.
   Kūgo listens as Riruka explains her ability. He accuses her of being unreasonable towards Ichigo and tells

   that he does not know if Ichigo will be alright.
   Once Ichigo awakens his Fullbring, Kūgo explains that, just like every battle Ichigo has had has been carved into his soul, they're also carved within the soul of the tool he holds. So in other words, the Substitute Shinigami Badge has had memories of each battle recorded in it as well, meaning that even though Ichigo lost his powers, the badge still remembers them.
  </p>
  <p key="2eb9b658-f500-4c78-8099-5cad9ba3d4af">
   After Ichigo is released from the Dollhouse, he asks if he is to stay for further training. Riruka tells him to leave and Kūgo backs her up, saying that Fullbring puts more strain on the body than can be felt. He advises Ichigo not to push himself as his body will fall to pieces if he wears himself out.
   When Ichigo returns for information, Kūgo explains the history Xcution shares with Tsukishima and why he might have attacked Uryū and confronted Orihime. He sends Ichigo home to rest and prepare for more training.
   When Ichigo is placed inside a fish tank to fight Jackie, Kūgo tries to stop an uninterested Riruka from leaving, as she is needed to disengage her Dollhouse ability. She tells him to come find her when the training is done, and then promptly leaves, despite Kūgo's request not to. Yukio then informs Kūgo that this is what he hates about Riruka.
  </p>
  <p key="1261f7af-6397-4f8b-a028-0875576aafce">
   Kūgo is then approached by Chad. He tells Chad that Ichigo is training against Jackie and Chad says that his timing is perfect then, surprising Kūgo. Chad asks what Tsukishima's ability is
   and explains about Orihime's circumstance, theorizing that suggestion or memory loss could be Tsukishima's ability. He tells Kūgo that keeping secrets is meaningless at this point and says he wants an honest answer.
   Kūgo gets up and says that he was not keeping secrets. He says if Tsukishima had an ability as troubling as what Chad had suggested, he would have already told him. He says that Tsukishima's Fullbring is a sword that can literally cut through anything, but that is all it can do. Chad suggests that maybe it changed since the last time that Kūgo had seen him, but Kūgo says that Fullbrings do not change with progress. Chad comments that his own abilities evolved, but Kūgo merely says that Chad was just at the initial stage of his ability and had not unlocked its true nature. He says that Tsukishima, along with all the other Fullbringers, had long since passed that stage. Kūgo then asks if Uryū has had any troubling memories. Chad says no and Kūgo tells him to check again because if he is that is a different problem altogether but if he is not, then that means the one who attacked Orihime was not Tsukishima. Suddenly, Tsukishima bursts in and greets Kūgo, who questions what he is doing. Tsukishima cuts the fish tank as Kūgo cries out, causing Ichigo to emerge from the tank in a new form.
  </p>
  <p key="d22d7c2b-ff09-4eae-9e0b-8e8317c0251d">
   Kūgo is shocked to see his new form. As Ichigo attacks Tsukishima, Kūgo stops Sado from helping, saying that now that Ichigo has activated his Fullbring, they can afford to tell him about Tsukishima. Sado worries that they don't know how powerful Ichigo's Fullbring is and telling him that Tsukishima attacked Orihime will hurt his performance. Ichigo then appears and thanks the two of them for looking out for him. He goes to attack Tsukishima but when Tsukishima tries to finish him, Kūgo blocks Tsukishima's attack.
  </p>
  <p key="88abd4a7-4ea2-4586-aab7-a14ed5204766">
   Tsukishima then mocks Kūgo for interfering, to which Kūgo says that Tsukishima is the one who is interfering. Ichigo tells him to step aside, but Kūgo knocks him to the ground and tells Ichigo to shut up and stay down. Tsukishima and Kūgo clash swords and fight. Kūgo unleashes an energy attack against Tsukishima. Tsukishima comes out from the dust unharmed and manages to cut Kūgo across the right side of his face. Tsukishima asks what would happen if he damaged a building that had people inside. Kūgo tells Tsukishima that he is only picking the empty ones to jump on. Their fight is then interrupted by Ichigo and later Yukio uses his Fullbring to contain Ichigo.

  <p key="9ee050fd-fc3b-4aa1-a01f-46b21aad9a95">
   After moving to Xcution's backup headquarters Yukio frees Ichigo, who asks about Tsukishima. Kūgo tells him that he has fled for now and that he is worried about Tsukishima's objectives. He states that rather than harming Xcution, Tsukishima's goal appears to be Ichigo. Yukio tells him that he is over thinking things though as Tsukishima would not have attacked while he held his console. Kūgo instructs a reluctant Yukio to help with Ichigo's training as his Fullbring shuts out Reiatsu completely. Ichigo asks if it will be a live battle and Kūgo says that is what seems to work best with him and that he will be Ichigo's opponent.
   Yukio loads them into his Fullbring, which Kūgo explains. After some banter, Kūgo asks Yukio to implement some rules for their training and the pair clash.

   An impatient Kūgo dives into an attack but Orihime puts up a shield. Kūgo asks if she really thinks he can be stopped by

  <p key="ed65ad2c-ea1b-4f5b-9acb-2cb008f0c3a4">
   Kūgo assesses Ichigo as they fight and notes that his movements are sharper and he thinks that he was right to have Orihime brought there and that he is stronger when he is close to a person he wants to protect. As they continue to fight, Kūgo concludes that Ichigo has too many random thoughts in his head and he slashes Ichigo's eyes. He then stops Orihime from helping him, telling her to watch. He states that when Ichigo lost his powers he also lost his resolve and that he will drag him back to the battle.

  <p key="b83ad2ed-a976-4256-b7a2-ec8a3677690c">
   Kūgo quickly overwhelms the blinded and confused Ichigo and impales him with his sword. Kūgo then tells Ichigo that he'll kill Sado and Orihime. Ichigo is surprised by Kūgo's words, but Kūgo tells him that he should have expected it since he is not a comrade. Enraged, Ichigo yells at Kūgo. Kūgo notices Ichigo's Fullbring changing and grabs Ichigo's materialized blade as it explodes with energy. Seeing that Ichigo's Fullbring is now complete, Kūgo tells Ichigo that he is proud of him and explains that someone has to stay close and control the outburst of energy as the torrent of energy released from the object of the Fullbring could ruin the user's body, which is why Kūgo wanted to be present when Ichigo's own Fullbring was complete. He then apologizes to Ichigo, saying that he made too much of a clichéd villain and welcomes him to Xcution.

  <p key="797b6fbf-c5de-4f05-b1f5-b339c21a881e">
   Kūgo later puts the recovered Ichigo through a regime of endurance training, making fun of Ichigo as he does so. Kūgo reveals that using Fullbring takes a massive amount of stamina, hence the training. Kūgo then asks if Ichigo saw something when he completed his Fullbring, surmising from his reaction that Ichigo's mangled eyes saw him bathed in reiatsu. He says that is why he cut Ichigo's eyes as that is proof that Ichigo is beginning to regain his Shinigami powers. Kūgo explains that when Ichigo lost his reiatsu, a tiny portion accumulated in a single location inside of him over time and that is why they used the reiatsu flowing from his badge to jolt that awake. He says all that is left to do is to beef up his new body and powers and then his Fullbring and Shinigami powers will fuse. Kūgo throws Ichigo his badge so he test out his new Fullbring. Kūgo comments on its appearance and tells him that his Fullbring needs a name.

  <p key="5891fe9d-ecf9-42ff-9fb2-f3fbb64d540d">
   Later, Kūgo calls for Ichigo as he runs through the street. He hastily informs Ichigo that Tsukishima has gotten to all members of Xcution.
   Kūgo takes Ichigo to a location that he claims no members of Xcution know about to discuss the events that transpired. He tells Ichigo that, thanks to information that Chad provided about Tsukishima's attack on Orihime and with what has transpired, that his ability may be placing himself into people's pasts by cutting them with his sword. The victims do not question Tsukishima as to them he has always been there. Ichigo then asks if killing Tsukishima would restore them to normal. Kūgo tells Ichigo that he does not know and asks if he could kill Tsukishima despite this. They are found by Yukio, who reminds Kūgo of his Fullbring's tracker. He says no one is mad at Kūgo and that they will have him back to normal in no time. He then leads them to Tsukishima's mansion.
  </p>
  <p key="7d97b29f-5deb-46df-9b8e-8c2eb4ff23de">
   Once there, Kūgo stops Ichigo from charging at Tsukishima, warning him that if he is right about his ability, then he cannot afford to be cut even once. They are invited inside, where Ichigo's friends and family are waiting. Kūgo watches as they greet Ichigo and urge him to apologize to Tsukishima for his previous actions. He tries to reassure Ichigo about their actions. However, Ichigo is unable to cope and runs upstairs, leaving Kūgo concerned. After Tsukishima follows Ichigo, Kūgo destroys the staircase and tells Ichigo that he can fight without worrying about the safety of his friends and family.
   As Ichigo fights Tsukishima, Kūgo tries to assist him. However,

  <p key="1cc4cd5b-f4cf-45af-96da-e21bfa6532b4">
   As Kūgo falls, Ichigo rushes to him and asks if he is okay. Kūgo tells Ichigo to worry about Tsukishima instead of him, informing Ichigo that he still sees Tsukishima as an enemy and Ichigo as his ally. He claims to be confused as to why Tsukishima's ability hasn't activated itself yet and they need to take him out before it does. Uryū Ishida arrives and tells Ichigo that Kūgo is the one who attacked him. Uryū shoots some arrows at Kūgo, but he blocks them and attacks Ichigo while Tsukishima cuts down Uryū. Ichigo asks if Kūgo was affected by Tsukishima's powers, prompting Kūgo to explain how they had deceived him by having Tsukishima cut him so that he believed that Tsukishima was an enemy and that the attack he had just received had returned him to normal. He then takes out a Substitute Shinigami's badge and merges it with his sword, telling Ichigo that he is relieving him of his Fullbring. Kūgo then stabs him with his sword.
   After Kūgo explains what happened when he attacked Uryū, Tsukishima said he only cut Kūgo because he was bad at acting and states that Kūgo started calling Ichigo "Kurosaki" again after he cut him again. Then after Kūgo takes Ichigo's Fullbring, the pair walk off. Once they start walking away, a burst of energy erupts behind them and Kūgo is surprised to see Ichigo in his Shinigami uniform.

   Faced with Ichigo's new power, Kūgo soon decides to retreat, but Ichigo stops him and fires a Getsuga Tenshō at him. Hitsugaya reveals that he is the first Substitute Shinigami as Kūgo emerges from the attack with a skeletal-like appearance.
   Hitsugaya explains further that the law of the Substitute Shinigami was created solely for Kūgo. Kūgo thanks Ichigo for his powers, as he would not have been able to survive Ichigo's attack without them.

   Chad and Orihime arrive soon after and Tsukishima tries to add in extra details about their pasts. Kūgo warns him not to do so, as he has broken many people before by doing that. The other members of Xcution arrive. Giriko and Yukio are both angry because Kūgo took Ichigo's power for himself even though he agreed to share it with the rest of them. Kūgo grants each of them part of Ichigo's power.
   Tsukishima asks if he's planning to give Moe any of Ichigo's power and Kūgo replies by telling him to kill Moe as his powers could be cause them problems if they were strengthened.
   Yukio then places Ichigo, Uryū and Kūgo into a pocket dimension using his Fullbring.
   Ichigo notices that their zone resembles Karakura Town and Kūgo explains that he chose that setting to make the fight easier for him.
   While Kūgo fights Ichigo and Uryū, they eventually begin hiding from him. Kūgo tries to goad them into attacking him and Ichigo eventually emerges. Kūgo asks if they came up with a plan, but Ichigo informs him that neither of them have one. Ichigo attacks Kūgo with another

   As the fight continues, Ichigo begins fighting on even grounds with Kūgo, which Kūgo comments on, but asks him what he is fighting for, saying that Tsukishima is dying and that if he does die, then the pasts he modified will return to normal.

   Ichigo dismisses Kūgo's words as an attempt to shake his resolve. Kūgo insists that he can easily take both of them and tells them that the true purpose of the Substitute Shinigami Badge is to observe and restrict the power of its owner. Kūgo says that this whole scheme was designed by

   Upon seeing Kūgo's Bankai, Ichigo comments that he forgot that he's also a Substitute Shinigami. Kūgo also reminds him that he also has Hollow powers, making him and Ichigo similar. They clash shortly afterwards.
   Kūgo wonders why Ichigo has not opposed his decision to fight against the Shinigami and notes that Ichigo is trying to understand him, denying him everything that he is. He then fires an energy blast at Ichigo. However, he blocks the attack and slashes Kūgo.
   They clash again, resulting in Kūgo's sword breaking and him being injured. Kūgo slumps to the ground, wondering what would have been if Ichigo had become a Substitute Shinigami before him.

   </b>
   : Due to his mastery of Fullbring, Kūgo can increase his speed and the height of his jumps by pulling on the soul of the concrete or air. Kūgo is quite fast, able to dodge successive attacks from Jackie, Riruka, and Giriko, all while they were using their Fullbring abilities.
   He is also able to get between a point blank attack by Tsukishima on Ichigo from a considerable distance, taking the attack himself in the process.
   He is capable of dodging Ichigo's incredibly fast and powerful sword swinging after the latter regains his Shinigami powers.

   ): Using Fullbring, Kūgo is able to transform the Saltire pendant on his necklace into a large, two-handed broadsword. The crossguard consists of a small red gem at the center and two straight ornate arms ending in simplistic version of a fleur-de-lis. The sword's handle runs through its guard, continuing on through a gold hollow space at the base of its blade. The handle is almost the same length of the blade itself.
   This part of the handle allows Kūgo to attack opponents at closer ranges.
