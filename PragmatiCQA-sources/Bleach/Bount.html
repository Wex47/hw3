   Due to the unique circumstances of their creation, the Bount were born with the ability to maintain eternal youth by consuming either living or dead Souls; this, combined with their fatal attacks on living Humans for their Souls, led to the myth of the vampire being created by Human society.
   In addition, the visible agelessness of the Bount caused Humans to persecute and hunt them down under the impression that they were witches and monsters;
   eventually, the Bount decided that they had no place in the Human World and sought to return to Soul Society, only to end up warring with the

   The affected Souls were born all around the Human World with powerful spiritual abilities and became known as the Bount; due to the Souls of the researchers being used as a base for the original Artificial Souls that the Bount were created from, some of the Bount were born as physical copies of those Shinigami templates, with

   looking nearly identical to Ran'Tao herself.
   Though the Bount tried to live peacefully among Humans, this did not last long due to Humans noticing their agelessness and persecuting them out of fear, causing some Bount to instinctively summon their

   When Soul Society learned of the high number of Humans being born with spiritual powers and the increasing number of incidents arising from Bount defending themselves, Ran'Tao and other Shinigami were sent to investigate these reports, where Ran'Tao witnessed the persecution of the Bount and felt guilt for her role in creating them. Deciding to help the Bount as best she could, Ran'Tao gathered them from across the land inside an elaborate cave system on the outskirts of what would become

   regarding the Bount, whom Central 46 had decided to bury alongside all evidence of the experiment that created them. Despite Ran'Tao's argument that the Seireitei had a duty to protect the Bount as their creators and not abandon them since it could lead to them growing incredibly dangerous, Central 46 ruled that they could pose a threat to the equilibrium between Soul Society and the Human World, which led a horrified Ran'Tao to realize that they intended to exterminate the Bount instead of simply hiding their existence, though Central 46 claimed that they would live with the burden of their mistake.
  </p>
  <p key="1c79c0b4-2871-440c-abb8-31ba6f2ba401">
   Despite this, Ran'Tao refused to give up on the Bount and returned to Human World without permission in order to save them. Following Central 46's decree, dozens of Shinigami mobilized in the Human World and raided the cave city of the Bount, whom they slaughtered in droves without offering any opportunity to surrender. Though most of the Bount had already died or fled by the time she arrived, Ran'Tao managed to find a young boy named
   Eugene Currier
   who had hid from the Shinigami and carried him to safety, where she gave him an amulet to draw out his dormant Bount powers and had him run away to find the other Bount. Following this, Ran'Tao was arrested and had her spiritual powers sealed as punishment for her defiance, but she continued working in secret over the subsequent centuries with the hope of helping any Bount who came to Soul Society.

   Eugene and the other Bount that escaped from the massacre in the caves wandered aimlessly and lived like vagabonds, a life that held much danger for them because their

  </p>
  <p key="d1afb918-a447-4c93-bd32-0da6f038e288">
   Eventually, the majority of the Bount decided to move their civilization to Soul Society, as most of them felt that remaining in the Human World was futile since they were an irregularity there and that living in Soul Society would be the best option for them. Eugene vocally opposed this decision and asserted that there was no need for the Bount to preserve their ties to the Shinigami when they could build their own paradise with their own strength, but he was ignored in favor of the majority.
   Though the Bount could create

  </p>
  <p key="df16814b-e3ab-4e95-bcd4-1d570e6dbdf7">
   However, the Quincy refused to help the Bount, resulting in the two factions going to war with each other. Seeing this conflict as an opportunity to finally eradicate the Bount once and for all, the Shinigami interrupted the battle and slaughtered both the Bount and Quincy who were involved. Incapacitated during this, Eugene was forced to helplessly watch as his comrades were massacred in front of him, and after the battle was over, Eugene decided that the Bount who perished were too weak and abandoned his idea of using his powers to create a paradise. After taking the name
   Jin Kariya
   , he decided to gather the strongest Bount together and destroy Soul Society for inflicting such misery on them.
  </p>
  <p key="6ea10658-7d0a-4dc0-a181-7e8aa3ea14dd">
