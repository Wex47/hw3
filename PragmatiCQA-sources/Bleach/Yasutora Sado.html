   Sado is a teenager of
   Mexican
   and
   Japanese
   descent. He is dark-skinned with pronounced cheek-bones and has wavy brown hair with bangs that generally hangs over his brown eyes. He is a muscular and extremely tall man and appears to be much older than he actually is. Sado has a tattoo on his left shoulder which reads

   He typically wears either his school uniform or flashy short-sleeved shirts with open collars. He also wears a dark, long-sleeved shirt with a rose emblazoned on the left sleeve. Seventeen months after Aizen's defeat, Sado has grown a small goatee on his chin.

  </h2>
  <p key="693b1387-8069-4f3c-aadc-a64ad8fd9bb1">
   Sado was born in
   Okinawa
   , Japan, but was taken to Mexico by his parents at a young age. After their deaths, Sado was adopted at the age of eight by
   Oscar Joaquín de la Rosa
   , a man believed to be his grandfather since Sado calls him
   <i key="c35499c7-ef36-4112-a4c9-e5e011a413d3">
    Abuelo
   </i>
   ("Grandfather" in Spanish).
  </p>
  <p key="dccaf224-a773-435f-90a4-09d106654538">
   During his early years, Sado was extremely violent; exploiting his advantage in size, he intimidated and hit any other children who annoyed him. Oscar Joaquín tried to teach Sado to be gentle, but was initially unsuccessful.
   One day, the fathers of the children Sado fought, seeking to punish him, attacked Sado. Oscar Joaquín stepped in between them, taking Sado's punishment without retaliation. Sado was inspired by this example to become a decent person. To commemorate this event, Oscar Joaquín gave Sado an old Mexican coin; years later, when Oscar Joaquín had died, Sado made a vow that he would never fight unless it was to protect others, as instructed — even if his own life was in danger.
   The coin would come to symbolize this vow, which Sado now claims to hold more value than his own life.

  <p key="1de790ed-e629-4eeb-8e33-005c33f1934e">
   Some time after De la Rosa died, Chad moved back to Japan and entered Mashiba Junior High School at Karakura Town. In the 8th grade,
   he helped

   when the latter was attacked by thugs. Chad was later attacked by two of
   Yokochini
   's gang members and, keeping with his vow, did not strike back or defend himself.
   Ichigo intervened and saved him and later learned from Chad a little about his past, the meaning of the coin and the vow he made. However, as the gang members fled they left a cell phone with an ongoing call to Yokochini, allowing him to spy on Chad and learn what might get a rise out of him. Yokochini later had Chad abducted and threatened him with the destruction of the coin. Ichigo stuck his neck out again, this time to protect not only Chad, but also the coin he held so dear. When the gang was defeated, Chad and Ichigo made a pact to fight for each other and protect one another.

   Because they were constantly involved with fights and brawls with thugs and delinquents, both Ichigo and Chad gained the reputation of hardened thugs themselves. Their reputation far exceeded that of violent youths as they were made up to be juvenile gangsters of sorts.

        Sado and Rukia are suddenly forced into the ground by Shrieker's "artillery", but Sado simply uses his brute strength to get them off. Sado then helps out Rukia just as Shrieker flies into the air again. However, Sado launches Rukia into the air, but she's stopped by Shrieker's miniature bombs. Shrieker then brings out Sado's cockatiel and threatens to kill the bird if Sado moves, so Rukia is forced to fight alone.
        Later, Sado notices that Ichigo's body is on the ground, but Rukia explains that Ichigo is in the middle of a battle and she tells him to take his body and the cockatiel away.

        Sado, being unable to see the Hollow, decides to have Karin help him by having her be his eyes. As the battle goes on Sado recalls that his fists are meant for protecting, and this causes armor to form around his right arm and allows him to gain the advantage.
        Sado, now being able to see the Hollow, kills his enemy immediately with his new-found power. Sado then collapses onto the ground and wonders why he gained this power, but decides it doesn't matter and is simply glad Ichigo's sister didn't get hurt.

     Again, Sado joins Ichigo and Orihime in searching for Nozomi when she goes wandering around Karakura Town a second time.
     While looking, he wonders, with Orihime, if Nozomi keeps leaving because she knows of a way to rectify the current situation.
     After Orihime senses the Shinigami losing, she and Sado go to help as Ichigo searches for Nozomi. They are confronted by Reigai-Renji whom Sado begins to battle as Orihime goes to heal their comrades. In his battle, Sado struggles and is soon aided by the real Renji. Working together, they manage to defeat the Reigai.
     Sado later joins everyone at the Urahara shop as they look up the news on the events in Soul Society.
     After Urahara informs everyone that Ichigo's Reiatsu has disappeared, Sado later questions Urahara again, but he simply repeats what he said. As Nozomi then blames herself, Kon says it will take more than that to kill Ichigo and Sado adds that it was Ichigo's idea to go so she cannot blame herself.

     Sado is present when Urahara states that he still cannot detect Ichigo's Reiatsu. After Urahara successfully picks up on a reading, he tells Sado and the others to accompany him.
     After Ichigo wakes up abruptly, Sado and the rest of his friends greet him. Later, Sado sits down alongside Urahara, who explains the reasoning behind Inaba's research into the Dangai.
     Sado then participates in a meeting in Ichigo's room, where he listens to

     Having succeeded in their goal, Sado goes off to join the fight. He finds Rangiku and Iba fighting the Reigai-Komamura. While Sado lands a powerful blow that launches the captain Reigai into a lake, he quickly emerges with his Bankai. Sado, Rangiku, and Iba are quickly pushed back, forcing them to regroup with the others. Sado notices that Ichigo's Reiatsu is fading again, quickly tiring him, forcing Sado to back him up and draw the Reigai-Kenpachi's attention. Seeing how grim the situation is, it is decides to rely in Nozomi's new Shikai, which has the power to absorb and redirect spiritual energy into a powerful blast. They launch their attacks on Nozomi, who then directs the accumulated energy on the Reigai, defeated all except for the Reigai-Byakuya, who then counters with a blast of his own, knocking everyone except for Ichigo and Nozomi out. Yamamoto arrives and quickly defeats the last Reigai.
     Shortly afterwards, the Reigai of Kyōraku and Ukitake appear. As Uryū and Sado recover, they are told to take the unconscious Shinigami to Orihime so they can be healed.

     After Inaba manages to capture Nozomi and destroy Ichigo's remaining Reiatsu, Sado and the others are forced to regroup at Urahara's. There, it is wondered why Inaba would constantly try to destroy Ichigo whenever the chance presented itself, even using the Kōtotsu. Kisuke surmises that it was because Inaba is unable to produce a Reigai with Hollow powers. Realizing that Ichigo was indeed swallowed by the Kōtotsu, Kisuke believes they can restore Ichigo's Reiatsu with his remaining Reishi still inside the Kōtotsu. Sado is present when Ichigo returns with a sample of his Reishi.
     Afterwards, Sado and the others act as diversions in the Dangai while Ichigo and Kisuke sneak into Soul Society.

He says Chad also has Fullbring powers and has agreed to help restore Ichigo's powers. Ichigo asks Chad if that's true and he approves it, saying he hasn't been able to look at Ichigo since the latter lost his powers. He tells Ichigo not to try and hide his passion to fight for others' protection. After hearing this, Ichigo agrees to help.

She asks if he is going to join in the complaints against her way of doing things. Sado removes the roof of the house and tells Ichigo to that his substitute Shinigami badge is the best thing he can think of to use for Fullbring.
        As Ichigo is fighting

He tells Ichigo to find a time when he felt pride as a Shinigami, and his heart will activate the badge. Sado then witnesses as Ichigo's Fullbring is released.

        Sado and Ichigo later walk back to his home. He tells Ichigo that Orihime has been bringing him leftover bread everyday lately. Ichigo tells Sado that she is worried about him and that he should call her. Sado tells Ichigo that she leaves him too much and that he will give half of it to Ichigo. But when Sado arrives at his door and reaches for the bread, he notices something is wrong with her Reiatsu and shouts at Ichigo that something happened to her.
        Sado warns Ichigo against calling Orihime in case the distraction causes her death.
        They arrive at her apartment to find Orihime stunned and alone, but unharmed. She frantically brushes off their concern with a bad lie that causes the two of them to be suspicious with Sado later silently agreeing with her precautions regarding Ichigo being vulnerable, and tells him not to worry about her.

        Orihime walks into a pole while talking with Sado on her phone. Sado, hearing the noise, asks if she is okay. She tells him that she is and apologizes. She tells him that she is certain she was cut, but by the time she came to, he and Shishigawara were gone and there was no wound. Orihime reveals that when Sado and Ichigo arrived on the scene she thought for a second that Tsukishima was her friend. She says that she does not understand it and rather than mistaking him for a friend, it felt like an old memory, leaving Sado shocked. Orihime tells him to be careful as she believes that Tsukishima's power is scary. Sado agrees and then asks for the two attackers' names and he tells him their names, though she mistakenly says Shishigawara's name as

        After speaking with Orihime, Sado meets with Kūgo at the Xcution headquarters. Kūgo tells him that Ichigo had already started his next training phase. Sado asks what Tsukishima's abilities are.
        Sado explains what Orihime told him and suspects that Tsukishima's Fullbring can alter the memories of those it cuts.
        Kūgo, however, says that he already told Sado everything he knew about Tsukishima's Fullbring, and if he already knew about it, then he would have told Sado already. He tells him that Tsukishima's Fullbring is called

        , and that it has an attack power so high that it can literally cut through anything, but it is the only thing that it can do. Sado asks if his Fullbring could have evolved since they last met, and Kūgo says that they cannot; Fullbring abilities cannot and will not change through growth. Sado argues that his Fullbring changed many times. Kūgo, however, explains that means that Sado simply could not access his Fullbring to its fullest ability until he reached a level that he could, and that the rest of the members of Xcution had surpassed that stage a long time ago. Kūgo also explains that Orihime's explanation worries him, because to the best of his knowledge, Tsukishima's Fullbring didn't cause Orihime's memory distortion. Kūgo then asks about Uryū's condition, surprising Sado. Kūgo reminds Sado that Uryū was attacked and asks if he has the same memory problems. Sado tells him that Uryū apparently did not suffer the same memory distortion as Orihime did. Kūgo tells Sado that they had better be sure, because if Uryū is suffering from the same memory distortion, then they need to be worried about Tsukishima's abilities. However, if Uryū is not suffering from the conditions as Orihime, then whoever attacked Orihime may not have been Tsukishima at all.

        However, Tsukishima breaks into the room telling Kūgo not to be so sure about his theory, surprising everyone in the room. Sado watches Tsukishima as he greets everyone in the room. Noting that Jackie and Riruka are not in the room, Tsukishima attack Riruka's Fish Tank causing Ichigo to emerge, cloaked in Reiatsu shaped similarly to his Shinigami shihakushō.
        Sado realizes that Ichigo reached a new stage of his Fullbring, and that it is similar to his Bankai, and to be cloaked in power is Ichigo's true self. Ichigo attacks Tsukishima and asks who he is. Sado realizes the dangers of not knowing who Tsukishima is and attacks him after he identifies himself to Ichigo. Sado lands on the roof and Kūgo scolds him, remarking that they can now tell Ichigo about Tsukishima. Sado remarks that it would be a risk, as they do not know how powerful Ichigo's Fullbring is yet, nor do they know how much control he has over it. He further explains that if they explain what he did to Orihime, then his performance might suffer. Ichigo, however, overhears this and realizes that they only avoided telling Ichigo anything because they were trying to protect him, which he did not realize. Tsukishima lands on the rooftop as well, causing Ichigo to attack him. As Ichigo fights, Sado notes that Ichigo progressed immensely on his Fullbring training. However, Tsukishima gains the upper hand in their fight, causing Kūgo to stop his attack with his own Fullbring.

        Sado later stops Ichigo from trying to interfere with Kūgo and Tsukishima's fight. Sado tells Ichigo that Tsukishima is way ahead of him and is impossible for Ichigo to win at his current state. But Ichigo does not listen to Sado and rushes off to fight.
        After their encounter with Tsukishima, Sado runs into Orihime. He asks her if she was just at the hospital and she replies yes and that she healed Uryū. He says he wanted to hear how Uryū was and she can tell him on the way. Orihime asks where they are going and he responds that they are going to Ichigo as he will need Orihime's powers in the next stage of his training.
        As they arrive at Xcution's back-up headquarters, Riruka jumps off the building and asks who Sado is with. He responds that it is Orihime and Riruka grins a little. Riruka talks to Orihime and says that Sado told them about her. Sado tries to get her to stop antagonizing Orihime, but she continues before Orihime points out Riruka's feelings for Ichigo and then says that she will heal Ichigo no matter what and they all continue on up to Yukio.

Sado enters and says that he did and that he knows Ichigo did not want to get her involved, but he will need her. Kūgo begins saying something to Sado but he interrupts saying that he did not come there to back up Ichigo. He says he had Yukio make him his own room where he can train, saying he cannot afford to sit around if he wants to fight Tsukishima again. Kūgo acknowledges this and tells him to do as he will. He enters the room and reflects on the encounter with Tsukishima and remembers that he was attacked by Tsukishima, but no one noticed he was stabbed. He says that everything is how Orihime described it and that Tsukishima's powers are a mystery and that he needs to gain more power if he is going to fight back.

Sado is confused by Ichigo's words and states that he's conflicted, not because they're the "same", but because they're "different". He asks Ichigo why he's attacking Tsukishima, and both him and Orihime tell him that he only saved Rukia and defeated Aizen because Tsukishima helped him. Tsukishima appears behind Ichigo and asks him if he understands, but Ichigo lashes out at him

Tsukishima then comes behind Sado and Orihime and asks them if they doubt their memories. Tsukishima asks Orihime who protected her from her parents and raised her, and he asks Sado who gave him his coin. He answers that he did both. Kūgo tries to stop Tsukishima from saying anything else, but then Sado and Orihime both feel strange. They are both knocked out by Urahara and Isshin shortly afterwards.

   This power is actually a product of

   .
   Upon entering Hueco Mundo, Sado felt the power inside him rustling, something he never felt while in Soul Society. The rustling increased the deeper he went into Hueco Mundo, and it was the beating he received from Gantenbainne that caused the rustling to settle down. Upon coming to Hueco Mundo, his power had been happily crying out like it had come home, and through the violent welcome of its brethren had reclaimed its sanity. Sado acknowledges that his power is less like a Shinigami's or Quincy's and more like that of a Hollow.
   This allowed him to fully tap into his powers, which manifest as armor on both arms, instead of just his right. Sado states that when he first used his power, it awoke because of the pride that had been instilled in his heart by
   Oscar Joaquín de la Rosa
   , and that the object that acted as the source of his Fullbring was the skin on his arms.
   Originally, he could only activate this power from his need to protect.
   Later, during his training under Yoruichi Shihōin, Sado learns to activate his powers at will.

His fingertips charge in the forms of five disks of crackling spiritual energy, and he forms a fist and punches his opponent. The blow is devastating, and upon contact, a huge skull shape is gouged into the surface behind the target. Those who are struck by it are like sacrifices crucified and offered to the devil.

        : Sado covers his right arm all the way up to his shoulder in a liquid which then solidifies into a form of armor. The shoulder fans out a bit into an upward extension, parallel to his height. It has an indentation at the top in the middle of the extension, stopping just where his shoulder begins, separating the upward extension into two. There are two wing-like protrusions on either side of his wrist. The arm is black, with a dark magenta strip running down the middle of the arm, tapering down towards a point that stops at the wrist. The dark magenta strip is outlined by a thin white line. These patterns are on the top as well as the underside of his arm.

   The extent of the injuries inflicted upon Sado have sometimes been downplayed in the anime, including the severity of injuries being toned down compared to the manga.
   The biggest example of this is Sado's injuries from his first encounter with Yammy Llargo were drastically toned down in the anime. In the manga, his armored arm was torn off and broken into two,
   while in the anime, his arm merely had several deep cuts in it.
   It has also reduced the extent of injuries inflicted by Sado, such as during his fight with
