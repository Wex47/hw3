   Shot fatally just days before his 26th birthday, Richthofen had only been shot down once before, in 1917, when he was stunned by a British bullet, which tore open his skull. The injury to his head affected his mental judgement, contributing to his death, by causing him to fly across enemy lines. His death was initially credited to the Canadian Royal Air Force pilot, Captain Arthur Roy Brown, but historians now believe that the fatal shot was fired from Australian troops (Cedric Popkin specifically) on the ground.
