   's other fantasies too. It is impossible to tell the difference between them, since they all look identical (with the exception of Raymond, who is shaded much darker). Despite this, Snoopy seems to be able to tell them apart. Like Woodstock, when they speak, it is shown as exclamation points, although Snoopy seems to be able to understand them.

   A running gag featuring Snoopy and the birds, is that Snoopy says something he thinks is funny but the birds do not get it, causing Snoopy to think, "Birds have no sense of humor". For instance, in one strip they go bird watching, Snoopy tells the birds that they should all watch each other but they do not appear to understand his joke.

   Due to the birds not being able to talk, it is hard to gain an impression of their personalities. However, they appear to share some personality traits. For instance, they can never understand Snoopy's jokes, always becoming very confused whenever he tells one. It is also known that although they often go on nature hikes, they do not care much for nature. On their hikes they are normally more interested in hot dogs than anything else. The birds never know what to do on their hikes, so they normally just copy Snoopy. They see that Snoopy sleeps on top of his tent, the same way he sleeps on top of

   With the exception of the strip from March 9, 1966, the birds' thoughts are not displayed in the form of thought balloons, therefore it is hard to differentiate the individual birds' personalities. However, there are some exceptions.
   Harriet
   , despite Snoopy denying this to be true since she is a girl, is much tougher than any of the other birds, and tires less easily than anyone else. She also likes making frosted angel cakes, which is the only reason Snoopy let her join the
