   lists her as one of the many girls who sent him valentines. The character is referred to again in the same context in the strip from
   February 16, 1971

   September 5, 1971

   Apparently, Amy's birthday is August 5 as the greeting "Happy Birthday Amy" appears in many August 5 strips. Sometimes this message is written on

Craig). She is married to John Johnson and now lives in Alpine, Utah, with a large and happy family, where she rides horses
and runs an LDS bookstore.

   On August 5 Schulz often penned the words "Happy Birthday Amy" somewhere into the strip, usually along one of the margins.

   Amy has several original strips, including those that mention her, tucked away safely in a vault.
