   and they would often appear together as a duo. In the early strips, Violet was often portrayed as an early school-aged Suzy Homemaker: making mud pies, playing "house," and imagining romantic scenarios involving her and Charlie Brown. On rare occasions, Violet was shown walking and keeping company with

   ). She would eventually be utilized as a straight woman to set up a punchline, almost similar to that of Patty's role in the strip. However, while Violet first appeared a few months after Patty, Violet would go on to become a much more prominent character. By the 1960s Violet rarely appeared in the same strip as Patty and was more often seen hanging around with her other friend Lucy, but by the mid-'70s both Patty and Violet essentially disappeared. Schulz spoke of such characters in a 1988 interview. "Some characters just don't seem to have enough personality to carry out ideas," he said, referring to Violet, Patty, and Shermy. "They're just almost born straight men."

   A good example has Violet setting up a toy farmyard, including a house, barn, tractor and tree which is suddenly hit by Charlie Brown's kite. Charlie Brown looks embarrassed but not so worried as he was when his kite had hit Lucy's hand in a previous strip. As the cast of characters grew, Violet was left with very little to do besides antagonizing Charlie Brown.

   Violet's most consistent personality trait is that she tends to be a bit of a snob, oftentimes being very self-conscious of her appearance and status. It is implied that her family enjoys a considerably higher class standing than the other characters. Both of her parents are college graduates and her father earns more money than

    "Pig-Pen"

   for his inability to keep himself clean. Violet often looks down on people who fail to meet her elevated social standards, especially towards Charlie Brown, to whom she flatly states in one strip, "It simply goes without saying that you are an inferior human being." His adroit reply to that was, "If it goes without saying, why did you have to say it?!".
  </p>
  <p key="e34add2d-343b-4eb6-9785-e76c6a04f766">
   Being supposed of an upper-class upbringing, Violet also makes it a point to frequently brag about her father. This sometimes leads driving Charlie Brown to the point of aggravation, to which Violet's boastings to him are always comparative; to wit, she says, "
   <b key="0d36ee75-7ada-43c7-b62e-754f4d84d8d2">

After telling her about how his dad always smiles at him no matter how bad of a workday he is having, an overwhelmed Violet walks away, but not before quietly wishing Charlie Brown a Happy Father's Day. Her bragging on her dad backfires again in another strip when

   Violet and Patty are best friends and they would often appear as a duo. They mostly talked about how much they disliked Charlie Brown, although in the early days, they talked about how much they liked him. They also ganged up on him and abused him verbally, sometimes under the lead of the more commonly seen Lucy.

  <p key="b7d8c942-61e4-4f4a-8ca4-c1e59fdb19f0">
   In the early years of the strip, Violet's relationship with Charlie Brown seems to change day to day. In some strips, Violet would tell Charlie Brown how much she likes him and be concerned about whether or not he liked her back. On other occasions, she would be mean and rude to Charlie Brown and try to annoy him and hurt his feelings. As her appearances became less frequent in the later years of the strip, her mercurial nature was, however, unchanged: sometimes she would use any excuse to bring Charlie Brown down or elevate herself above him; while other times the two were quite cordial, often spending the day together chatting.

  <p key="a23f4d85-d614-4c36-bfa4-906b984c3cb9">
   In the strip from
   March 17, 1963
   , Violet offers Charlie Brown a valentine in person, explaining that she felt bad about not having done so in the past, only to be upbraided by

  <p key="e1c84b8b-ba1d-4f14-90b2-911bb9add869">
   It may come as a surprise to many that Charlie Brown himself has initiated very unfriendly physical abuse against Violet before without any apparent provocation. Thus in the strip dated
   June 14, 1953
   , Violet offers Charlie Brown an ice cream cone for being ‘so nice to me’, but he answers in embarrassment that he has not in fact been nice to her, and then recalls that in the two previous days he did such things as pushing her off her tricycle and throwing an object at her. Violet decides she would still like to give him the cone anyway – stubbed onto his head.

  <p key="9c65aff9-92a9-42f4-b8a1-1e1f45ed02fb">
   A classic example of this is in the strip from
   May 3, 1961
   , in which Violet is seen lashing out at Charlie Brown, finishing him off with the line, "And I don't care if I ever see you again, do you hear me?!"

  <p key="0b883c9d-6653-4803-a12e-494162e8223d">
   Violet is also the first person to call Charlie Brown a 'blockhead', in the strip from
   August 16, 1951
   , a trait that would later be taken over by Lucy.
  </p>
  <p key="c48af529-14df-4436-a026-74eff5d24578">
   Another example shows Patty and Violet reciting a very mean-spirited poem, pointing out that "Boys are rotten filled with cotton" and that "Girls are dandy filled with candy!" They then walk away smugly, where Charlie Brown retaliates with the phrase, "Generalities!!!"
  </p>
  <p key="d901619b-c2e4-4326-8d5e-c1dd44ec40db">
   Still, another involves the two berating Charlie Brown (in front of Linus) about a wrong answer Charlie Brown gave to a teacher's question, both going so far as to call him "stupid" and then walking off laughing at him.

   Her verbal abuse was not only confined to Charlie Brown. One Sunday strip from 1959, shows Violet and Patty mocking “Pig-Pen”. At one point, during
   October 25, 1961

   While Lucy's insults tend to be fairly blunt—calling Charlie Brown names like "blockhead" and making sarcastic remarks at his expense—Patty and Violet prefer to use social exclusion as their weapon, sometimes going to the extremes of making him feel like an outcast. This can be seen as a caricature of the "in crowd" that exists at many elementary and secondary schools—a lording of their own status over peers who are not members of the "in." For example, in one strip from
   February 3, 1952
   , they invite him to join their "secret club," and then immediately reject him after he accepts. In an early Sunday strip, Patty and Violet put Charlie Brown and

  </p>
  <p key="81059dab-9033-4cab-96ca-d8332ddd0e30">
   On several other occasions, especially in the early years of the strip, Patty and Violet go out of their way—sometimes with unconcealed glee—to make sure Charlie Brown knows that they are throwing a party and he is not invited.  
However, Charlie Brown manages to get back at them on several occasions:

    In one strip from
    November 23, 1951
    , when they mention excluding Charlie Brown from their party, he lets it roll off his back saying he does not want to go to their "dumb ol' party" anyway. After he leaves, they wonder whether he meant it. Violet is convinced he did, so Patty suggests "In that case, maybe we'd better invite him."
   </li>
   <li key="b36d9350-d9ce-4161-bce8-9204853934de">
    In another similar situation, he replies to them saying if they do not like him they are better off not inviting him. Stunned to silence, the girls simply walk away, with Charlie Brown smiling after them.

Before she can throw a punch, Charlie Brown stops her and tries to reason with her, saying that there are better ways to solve problems than with violence. Unfazed, Violet ends up punching him in the middle of his speech, and in the final panel admits to Patty, "I had to hit him quick. He was beginning to make sense!"

In one strip, Violet attempts to shame "Pig-Pen" by making him look in a mirror. She asks him, "Aren't you ashamed?" to which "Pig-Pen" replies, "On the contrary. I didn't think I looked this good."
