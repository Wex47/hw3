   The character has a warm personality and is welcoming to strangers, as his family has agreed to host Peppermint Patty and Marcie on their farm as part of the student exchange programme. Although he speaks excellent English, Pierre commends Marcie on her French abilities, saying he is always grateful to foreigners who make an effort to learn his native tongue. Pierre is the antithesis of the film's antagonist, the Baron, who is antisocial to everyone, especially Americans.
