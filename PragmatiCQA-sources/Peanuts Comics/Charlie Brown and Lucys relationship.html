   In the early days of the strip, although Charlie Brown had a fairly better relationship with her than he did in the later days, he often became annoyed by her "fussbudget" personality, and became ever more annoyed when she took that as a compliment.

   However, even though Charlie Brown does not like Lucy's mean and crabby personality, he still cares for her and trusts her. In the early days, Charlie Brown would read stories to Lucy, and act as a parental figure to her. Charlie Brown clearly trusts Lucy, as, despite the fact that she always pulls away the football when pulling her famous prank on him, Charlie Brown still trusts her enough to try again the next year, assuming that she will not pull it away that time. He also trusts her enough to tell her his problems when she is in her

   Lucy often mocks Charlie Brown, and abuses him, calling him different insults, such as "dumb" and "weak", although all those insults are false and wrong. Lucy is often unable to realize she is hurting Charlie Brown even though it is completely obvious (an example is the above strip). Sometimes she also teases him on purpose. Although her abuse of him is normally verbal, she does sometimes use physical abuse, most notably with her infamous football gag. Lucy delivers mean remarks with the greatest of ease, usually showing no emotion whatsoever, then moving on with whatever she was doing. When Charlie Brown fails at something, Lucy is quick to point it out, as illustrated by a series of strips from

   , however, Lucy is shown to have an innocent crush on Charlie Brown. And even later in the strip's run she gives hints to marriage with Charlie Brown. For instance, in the strip from
   October 5, 1957
   , Lucy mentions to Charlie Brown that she may someday be the mother of his children, and in the one from
   June 8, 1960
   , she mentions to Charlie Brown that if he were to become the President of the United States, she would make a good First Lady.
