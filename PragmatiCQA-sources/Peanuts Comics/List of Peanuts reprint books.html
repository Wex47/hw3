   reprint books were published initially by Rinehart &amp; Co., Inc., and later by the merged entity it became part of in 1960, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. (HRW). The content of these books was re-issued in different editions in later years, so that they appear in the following formats:

    books were paperbacks measuring 5 inches by 8 inches (13cm x 20cm) mostly in "portrait" format, with 124 pages of strip content: two daily strips per page (each in a 2x2 panel grid layout) or one Sunday strip per page. The first three books that collected only Sunday strips were originally in "landscape" format, so full Sunday strips could be presented. The last two Sunday-only collections switched to "portrait" format like the daily collections, with each Sunday strip presented in a modified "Tabloid" layout, where the strip's top-right panel was included, but a like-sized portion of the top tier (usually the left-most) containing the title was omitted, so all "story" panels were included. After two such Sunday collections were issued, Sundays were subsequently mixed with dailies in single volumes. In late 1967 the three original "landscape" volumes were reformatted in the newer "portrait" arrangement, which paved the way for their inclusion in the later

    </b>
    books, beginning in 1962, were standard "pocket book" size paperbacks published by Fawcett, initially under their Crest imprint, and then in a few years simply as Fawcett Crest. Each contained 124 pages of content, with one daily strip per page, or a Sunday strip spread across a left and right page (two pages), in either case with the panels broken up to fit the page layout. These books republished the contents of earlier Original books, where each Fawcett volume could accommodate exactly half of an Original; thus, two Fawcetts were issued from each Original book. When the

        covers Sundays ostensibly from their beginning (which was
        January 6, 1952
        ), but its earliest strip actually included was from
        June 22, 1952
        . It continues up through
        April 1956
        , providing about 61% inclusion within its actual range of dates. The first two pages that would normally have reprinted Sunday strips are instead devoted to a "gallery" of the strip's nine characters, constituting a formal declaration of the dropping of

   In addition to the regular reprint line, HRW released five large-format hardback compilations, measuring 9 by 11 inches (23cm x 28cm), with approximately 200 pages. Each page had either five daily strips, or one Sunday strip. While the majority of the content had been previously reprinted, starting with the second volume there was a small percentage of strips not previously reprinted, and the Sundays were in color.

   . The books were all in "landscape" format, with the first four measuring 5 by 8½ inches (13cm x 21cm), the next three measuring 7 by 10 inches (18cm x 25cm), and the last one 8½ by 11 inches (21cm x 28cm). Each volume contained slightly more than the equivalent of three-quarters of an HRW "Original"; thus three Fawcetts were issued for each pair of these volumes, providing a little less than complete coverage. These were the final books from which Fawcetts would be issued.
