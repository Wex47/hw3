   She often calls him her "Sweet Babboo", the first time that she does so being in the strip from
   January 27, 1977
   . Her crush, and the nickname "Sweet Babboo" is a frequent source of embarrassment to Linus, but he endures it stoically for the most part, although he is sometimes driven to yell in exasperation, "I'm not your Sweet Babboo!". in one strip, Sally also refers to herself as Linus' "Sweet Babbooette".

   she has joined him to sit in the pumpkin patch waiting for the Great Pumpkin, only to become disappointed and angry with Linus when the gift-giver does not show up. She is also angry and disappointed that she missed Halloween (including trick-or-treating and the Halloween party). And finally, she furiously grabs him by the shirt and says he "owes her restitution".

That is, to which Sally furiously replies, "YOU'RE RIGHT! IT WAS ALL MY SWEET BABBOO'S FAULT!". Linus replies, "I AM NOT YOUR SWEET BABBOO!". In the strip from
   February 14, 1991
   , Linus tells Sally that if he ever got a valentine from her, he would throw it in the trash. But Sally retaliates by clobbering him with her lunch box. Using

   Originally, Linus had a slight crush on Sally. For instance, in the strip from
   June 10, 1959
   , a little after Sally was born, Charlie Brown sees Linus doing calculations. Linus says that the calculations are to figure out how many years it will be until Sally will go out with him. But Schulz thought it would be funnier to make Linus have a crush on

   , so Miss Othmar took the place of Sally. Then, Linus took on something of a "mentor" role to Sally, teaching her about the ways of the world, tutoring her in the New Math, and even, on one occasion, demonstrating to her how to use a security blanket.

   However, when Sally fell in love with Linus, and started following him around, it started bugging Linus. Linus just wanted to get rid of her. Linus does not appreciate her love for him, and really hates it when she calls him her "
