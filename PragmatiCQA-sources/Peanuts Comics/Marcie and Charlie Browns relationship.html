   for Charlie Brown, but unlike her best friend, she is more open about these feelings. She often goes over to Charlie Brown, and asks him if he likes her.

   Marcie seems to have fallen for Charlie Brown the first time she saw him, and has had a crush on him ever since. She shows her affection for Charlie Brown in many ways, for instance, telling him he is cute, asking him to hold her hand, calling him "Charles", sometimes kissing him, and even outright telling him she likes him and asking if he likes her back. However, despite all her attempts to get his attention, she never succeeds (though after one kiss he stood there wide-eyed in wonder with his hat hovering over his head), as Charlie Brown fails to recognize the feelings she has for him. Despite this, Marcie never gives up, and always tries to get him to notice her.

   when Charlie Brown is hospitalized with a mysterious ailment, Marcie announces to Peppermint Patty that she thinks Charlie Brown is "real neat", and that she would marry him if he asked her to. Marcie's affection for Charlie Brown has been an occasional source of tension between her and Peppermint Patty.

On one occasion, when Charlie Brown got a letter from her in camp, he wondered why she always writes to him. Sally was able to figure out she likes him and Charlie Brown asked "Why would she like me?" to which Sally answered, "That's a mystery. You and the Bermuda Triangle."
