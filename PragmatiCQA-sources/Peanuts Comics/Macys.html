   The first R.H. Macy &amp; Co. store was opened on Sixth Avenue between 13th and 14th Streets, New York City in 1851. Its proprietor was Rowland Hussey Macy, originally from Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. A star has always formed part of the Macy's logo because Rowland Hussey Macy got a tattoo of a star while working on board a Nantucket whaling ship as a teenager.
