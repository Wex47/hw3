   Olaf made his first appearance on
   January 24, 1989
   , but was first mentioned on January 16 of that year as a candidate for an "ugly dog contest", which he goes on to win.

   Many of Olaf's early appearances feature gags related to his ugliness. For example, Olaf says that he once belonged to a family whose car license plate read "Our other dog is a golden retriever".
