   Snoopy's doghouse was first shown on
   September 4, 1951
   . It appeared again on
   November 19, 1951
   , when Snoopy first got television. In these earlier days of the strip, Snoopy treated it more like a normal doghouse. He would be seen sleeping in the archway. However, on
   December 12, 1958
   , Snoopy slept on top of his doghouse, rather than inside it, for the first time. Thereafter, Snoopy was seldom seen to venture inside the doghouse, except to retrieve something, instead spending the bulk of his time sitting or lying on its gable roof. One strip ascribed Snoopy's ability to sleep there to his long floppy ears, which—like the feet of a perching bird – "lock" him to the top so that he does not fall. After a while of Snoopy sleeping on top of his doghouse, it just seems normal to him. In the strip from
   January 27, 1963
   ,

   even suggests for Snoopy to sleep inside of it, when Snoopy was cold at night, but everyone thought that was the most ridiculous thing they had ever heard.

  <p key="2797cdac-24ba-41d5-a17c-55a28e22181f">
   At this point, the side view of the doghouse became standard in the strip, which allowed the imagination of

   (and Snoopy) to expand this dwelling beyond the limits of a normal doghouse. The house's most unusual feature is that it has an enormous inside. Either the entrance leads to an expansive basement with a few other rooms and ample storage space or the inside is a fourth-dimensional tesseract space. Either way the inside is much larger than the outside and contains many objects.
