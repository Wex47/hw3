   Snoopy has no choice but to follow, and manages to get past the Baron's forces and free Lucy, Rerun, and Franklin. However, the Red Baron chooses to engage in a dogfight himself, and with Rerun and Franklin both stripped of their weapons, only Snoopy and Lucy can challenge him. The Baron makes quick work of Lucy, shooting her down. After this, he reveals that a Doodlebug was indeed finished, and it is launched at Allied turf, with Charlie Brown strapped on. Snoopy, unable to take down the bomb without harming his owner, does just enough damage for Brown to get loose and escape. He then defeats the Baron and shoots the bomb down, saving the mainland and winning the war.

   A giant robotic driller machine that is the fifth boss of the game. Snoopy and Woodstock fly after it in the Sopwith Camel through a tunnel in the Mines of Matterhorn. General Mayhem first activates it's robotic hands and throws electric balls at Snoopy and Woodstock and then tries to zap them with electric bolts. Snoopy though manages to shoot the machine's robotic hands and destroy them. After General Mayhem's robotic hands are destroyed. The Commander activates the driller machine's robotic arm that throws giant power saw blades like frisbees. Every time General Mayhem throws it's giant power saw blades to try to defeat Snoopy and Woodstock with them, Snoopy shoots at the robotic arm that throws them and destroys it, causing the machine's armor to crack, revealing it's not invincible. After General Mayhem's robotic arm that throws it's giant power saw blades is destroyed, the Commander activates the machine's robotic arms that look like excavator arms. General Mayhem then digs it's robotic arms into the ground, making balls of dirt fall from the tunnel ceiling. Then the driller machine makes a big ball of dirt as the Commander gets ready to squish Snoopy and Woodstock, but Snoopy shoots the robotic arms, making the machine drop it's big dirt ball and Snoopy keeps on shooting General Mayhem's armor. The Commander then turns the machine around, making it's giant mining drill face Snoopy and Woodstock, and the machine's drill starts drilling into the tunnel walls, making balls of dirt fly everywhere. After the driller machine's drill keeps trying to destroy Snoopy's plane, Snoopy shoots at the machine's left arm, making it spin out of control causing Snoopy to face it's now destroyed armor and Snoopy keeps on shooting at it. After Snoopy keeps shooting at the machine's armor, General Mayhem finally explodes and the machine is finally destroyed, leaving all that's left of it is it's caterpillar tracks.

   The sixth boss of the game. Snoopy flying the Sopwith Camel again pulling Woodstock on the Woodstock Glider, start flying around the aircraft carrier to sink it. First, the carrier unleashes Blue, Green and Purple Fighters to try to shoot Snoopy and Woodstock down, but Woodstock manages to shoot down all the enemy fighter planes first. While fighting them, Marcie can't find a weak spot on the ship, so Woodstock could just shoot anywhere. U-Boats also emerge out of the water on both sides of the ship while fighting the Blue, Green and Purple Fighters, which Woodstock could sink by shooting at them. After all the enemy fighter planes are shot down, two Bomber Reinforcements arrive at the aircraft carrier. But Woodstock manages to shoot both of them and destroy them in the process. After the Bomber Reinforcements are destroyed, the Commander activates the aircraft carrier's guns to try again to defeat Snoopy and Woodstock. While shooting at the ship's guns destroying them, Woodstock finds a weak spot on the carrier and shoots there to damage the carrier to sink it. After Woodstock keeps on shooting the ship's weak spot, the aircraft carrier finally takes damage and starts sinking. The carrier's stern rises up into the air and it sinks straight down to the bottom of the river. After the aircraft carrier is gone however, the Red Baron tells his flying circus to release his Flying Fortress. The Flying Fortress then emerges out of the water and flies off with the kidnapped pilots. Woodstock then tells Marcie what they're suddenly seeing and Snoopy and Woodstock fly after it.
