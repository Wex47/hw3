   While visiting Lucy at her psychiatric booth, she gives him a book on how to become a winner. Over a few days, Charlie Brown attempts to follow the book’s advice, only for his bad luck to interfere; he enters the school talent show after practicing his magic act relentlessly, only to give up his spot to help his little sister, Sally, after her act goes wrong. His next attempt is to practice dancing for the school’s Winter Dance, after seeing the Little Red-Haired Girl dance through her windows. At the dance, he is about to win the dance contest alongside the Little Red-Haired Girl, but a slip of his shoe causes it to fly off and hit the gym’s sprinkler system, ruining the dance and leaving Charlie Brown soaked and alone.

  <p key="ad5cd4ca-ab82-4dbd-b303-f00a970e7edd">
   The next day, the class is assigned to do a book report with partners, and Charlie Brown is assigned to work with the Little Red-Haired Girl, who is out of town to take care of her sick grandmother. He then decides to write the book report for the two of them while she’s away. Suddenly, the results of a recent school test show that Charlie Brown got a perfect 100%, much to everyone’s disbelief and Lucy’s denial. This soon causes Charlie Brown’s popularity to skyrocket, with the kids coming to him for advice, wanting his autograph, touring his home hosted by Sally, and even wearing matching outfits for his signature shirt. But Charlie Brown grows bothered by the popularity and focused on reading Leo Tolstoy’s War &amp; Peace for his and the Little Red-Haired Girl’s report throughout the weekend, completing it the night before it is due.

  <p key="3e51e076-566f-4667-92bf-f22444a143ce">
   The next morning, Charlie Brown is about to be awarded a pendant for his test score performance, but upon being handed back his test, realizes that his test was mixed up with his classmate, Peppermint Patty. In defeat, Charlie Brown announces to the whole school that there had been a mistake, and walks out of the auditorium in shame. Outside, Linus commends him for his honesty and attempts to cheer him up that things could get better once he turns in his book report, something the Little Red-Haired Girl overhears and asks about. However, an accident with the see-saw causes the report to launch in the air and become destroyed by a toy plane launched by Charlie Brown earlier in the film. With nothing left, Charlie Brown walks off with no motivation.

   This depressed state continues until the spring when after helping a little boy with his kite successfully, Charlie Brown grows hopeful again. On the last day of school, the class is assigned a Summer Pen-Pal Project, where the Little Red-Haired Girl volunteers to be Charlie Brown’s pen-pal, much to Charlie Brown’s shock and confusion. Later on, Linus tells him that it may be time for him to consider that he is a good person and that people do like him, but he’ll never know if he doesn’t ask. Motivated, Charlie Brown rushes to the Little Red-Haired Girl’s house, only for her mother to answer and inform him that the Little Red-Haired Girl is at school, getting on a bus for summer camp.

  <p key="5450b465-d894-4594-bd0b-a86e5e6b496c">
   Charlie Brown reaches the bus, where the kite gets the Little Red-Haired Girl’s attention by gently tapping on her foot. She happily greets Charlie Brown, who asks why she would choose him to be his pen pal. The Little Red-Haired Girl says that she sees the type of person that he is; helping Sally at the talent show, the honesty he showed at the assembly, being brave at the dance, and his compassion for writing the book report. To her, she does not see a failure in Charlie Brown. After the Little Red-Haired Girl boards the bus and leaves, the children applaud Charlie Brown, and Lucy arrives to say, “I really need to tell you something, you blockhead: You’re still full of surprises. Good Ol’ Charlie Brown!” The kids then lift Charlie Brown and celebrate his long-awaited success.

   In a post-credit scene, Lucy tries to convince Charlie Brown to kick the football once more. Charlie Brown is apprehensive, but Lucy tells him that she now understands that he is kind, compassionate, brave, and funny and that no one would pull a football away from someone with all of those qualities. Charlie Brown, convinced, agrees once more, only for Lucy to pull the football away and adds smugly that she forgot to say that he is gullible, causing Charlie Brown to smile.

He ends up acting out his adventure physically, pulling himself across a line of lights and imagining it as a rope across a broken bridge, and he comes across Charlie Brown and the gang several times along the way. Snoopy defeats the Red Baron and rescues Fifi from a destroyed zeppelin. When Lucy finishes reading, she calls it the dumbest story she has ever read, so Snoopy throws the typewriter at her in retaliation and kisses her nose, causing her to run away in disgust yelling that she has "dog germs".

    When Charlie Brown is learning to dance using the foot markers laid down by Snoopy, he counts; "1, 2, 3, 4" but as he says "4" he puts his left foot down on the marker that says "3". Of course this is what we'd expect from Charlie Brown ...

    Charlie Brown is forcefully towed by his kite across the frozen lake, even though there is zero wind (as shown by the gently falling snowflakes). However, this is essential in keeping with the style of how the snow was drawn in the original animation and comics and may be a deliberate choice by the filmmakers.

    Linus is a year younger than Lucy and Charlie Brown, and would not have been in the same class as them. This is because he skipped a grade, which was not an uncommon practice when the comics were written.

    The Red Baron's triplane lacks the Iron Cross symbols that the real plane had in both Linus's original model and Snoopy's fantasy sequences. Linus may have forgotten to include the Iron Cross symbols or had not yet painted them on, while the Red Baron's plane in Snoopy's fantasies was based on the model plane because it hit him while he was trying to climb into the classroom through the window.
