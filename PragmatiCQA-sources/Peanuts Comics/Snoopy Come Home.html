   have a wonderful time playing in the surf and building sandcastles together. At the end of the day, Snoopy promises to come back to the beach the next day to meet up with her again. While Charlie Brown and the others have gone home to play Monopoly, he notices Snoopy is late and begins to get frustrated at how independent Snoopy has become; coming and going as he pleases. But Charlie Brown has to stay home and fix Snoopy's supper. This is only made worse when he later cuts his thumb when opening Snoopy's can of dog food with a can opener. Now angry, Charlie Brown confronts Snoopy about how ungrateful the beagle has been acting. Despite Charlie Brown's reminders about how much work he has to put in to take care of Snoopy, Snoopy seems to simply shrug his owner off.

Upon receiving the letter, he immediately sets off with Woodstock to go see her, leaving Charlie Brown completely in the dark as to who Lila is. But when Linus decides to do some investigating, he discovers, to Charlie Brown's horror, that Lila is Snoopy's original owner. Charlie Brown promptly faints upon hearing this. When he regains consciousness, he begins to worry that Snoopy wishes he was still her dog instead of his, given how abruptly Snoopy left to see her.

   Charlie Brown falls into a depression while Snoopy is away, and Peppermint Patty tries to cheer him up by taking him to a carnival. This does not go well for Charlie Brown, as, in addition to failing miserably at every carnival game they play, he barely makes it through the turnstile in one piece, much to Peppermint Patty's confusion. Later, Peppermint Patty becomes flirtatious with Charlie Brown and asks him what he thinks 'love' is. She is disappointed when Charlie tells a strange and off-putting story about his father being locked out of his car by a 'cute girl' (possibly his mother).

   En route to see Lila, Snoopy, with Woodstock along, is forced to face the challenges of a world full of signs declaring "No Dogs Allowed" (including on a bus, train, and more, musically accented by the deep tones of Thurl Ravenscroft, except one brief line where a female singer adds "That goes for birds!", when Woodstock is ejected after Snoopy with one means of transport that had that sign as well), and they also face the perils of being the pets of an annoying girl named

   Snoopy finally arrives at the hospital but, again, no dogs are allowed in. To add further insult, the hospital does not allow birds to enter either. Snoopy is foiled in his first attempt to sneak into Lila's room, but he is successful the second time. He then keeps Lila company for the rest of the time she is hospitalized. Lila credits Snoopy with his visit, claiming that it helped her get better. She then mentions that when she gets better, she would like Snoopy to go home with her, but he has doubts about this idea.

   Lila tries to convince Snoopy to stay with her, but finally the two part ways. However, upon seeing her watching him tearfully from her hospital window, Snoopy's resolve cracks and he grudgingly runs back to her, which she takes as a sign that he wants to live with her. After this moment, he returns home to 'settle his affairs' and say goodbye. When Charlie Brown notices Snoopy has returned, he throws a flurry of questions about Lila, the trip, and even how Snoopy is feeling but is frustrated to get no answer. Snoopy then writes a letter that states that he is returning to Lila and that certain items of his will be given away: Linus is given his croquet set and chess set, and

   The kids throw Snoopy a large, tearful going-away party, each one bringing a gift. The kids closest to Snoopy get up to say a few words in his honor. But when it is Charlie Brown's turn to speak, he is overwhelmed to the point of silence. He finally bursts into tears with Snoopy doing likewise. The rest of the gang, even Lucy, eventually follows suit when Schroeder plays "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" on his piano after Snoopy opens his mountain of presents (every single one is a bone).

   When a depressed Snoopy arrives at Lila's apartment building the next day, he is overjoyed to see a sign next to the door that says "No dogs allowed in this building" before Lila comes to the door. Then he is reluctantly introduced to Lila's pet cat. Snoopy then interrupts Lila and, with a grin on his face, shows her the sign. Now released from his personal obligation by this discovery, Snoopy leaves Lila behind and joyfully returns to Charlie Brown and the others.

The kids also notice him and, in their delight, join in singing the song, holding him on their shoulders as they take him back to his doghouse. However, Snoopy, again through Woodstock's typewritten letter, demands back the stuff he gave to the gang before he left, much to their anger. The only exception is Charlie Brown, who, Snoopy points out, owes him nothing, because Snoopy gave him nothing. Lucy then snaps, "That does it, Charlie Brown! He's YOUR dog AND YOU ARE WELCOME TO HIM!" The gang then leaves Charlie Brown and Snoopy together, then Charlie Brown walks crossly away. The film ends with end titles being typed out by Woodstock as Snoopy dictates.
