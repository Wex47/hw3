   Rerun's appearances became rare. On occasion, he was simply shown sitting in the background, silently observing other characters. In one strip, he sits silently as Lucy declares that nothing that happened that day was her fault, then lifts his baby bottle to declare, "I'll drink to that." In another strip, he sits silently in his sandbox as Snoopy and his

   Infant Rerun appeared in several strips in
   November 1992
   , again riding on the back of his mother's bike, and unsuccessfully being taught by Lucy to count fingers. Starting in 1993, he started appearing more frequently, having grown beyond infancy, and as Schulz said, Rerun "took over" the comic by the mid-1990s. Initially, toddler Rerun was shown playing cards with an equally confused Snoopy and learning to tie his shoes from Lucy.

   By 1996, Rerun had aged to 5 years old and reluctantly entered kindergarten, so he was still younger than the other characters in

   A running gag featuring Rerun has him being too scared to go to kindergarten on some days, so he hides under his bed. Lucy tries to get him to move, but Rerun rarely does. Another running gag is that Rerun wants a pet dog. He frequently borrows Snoopy from Charlie Brown. In one storyline, starting May 16, 1996, Rerun convinces Snoopy to invite

Other characters often inform Rerun that his drawings do not resemble his intended subjects. At other times, Rerun tries to sell his drawings, including ones of Snoopy, door to door. In

   Schulz sometimes used Rerun as a successor to Linus in revisiting old storylines. In a 1973 strip, Lucy ruined Linus' first viewing of the movie

   July 28, 1994

In one strip he keeps missing the basket, puts the basketball in a closet and closes the door, saying, "You can come out when you learn to behave."

   Rerun also yearns to play baseball on Charlie Brown's team. Despite having been allowed to join the team as an infant, leading to the gambling scandal that cost the team a rare win, strips from the 1990s often show Rerun's request being rejected by Charlie Brown. After Charlie Brown bluntly refuses to let Rerun play because he is too young and too small, Rerun accuses him of discrimination and obtains a court order, signed by Snoopy the

   Rerun bears a strong physical resemblance to Linus. In appearances from the 1970s and 1980s, Rerun is virtually identical to Linus, though he is smaller, wore a plain T-shirt (it appears that he got many hand-me-downs from Linus, as he wore a long-sleeved shirt with Linus's shirt design), and his hair sprang up. Rerun's appearance evolved in the 1990s, as he aged beyond infancy. Rerun was mostly shown wearing overalls, and his hair was shown as shorter and flatter. While he continued to share Linus' facial features, Rerun's head also grew rounder and larger in proportion to his body. In his early TV appearances, he wears a green or white shirt with black shorts and saddle shoes. In

   As one significant example, Rerun is shown walking on his own in the spring of 1973.  In a series of strips

   After almost fifteen years in which Rerun was only shown sitting on the back of his mother's bicycle, or on the floor, a comic strip from May 9, 1987 showed that Rerun had reverted to crawling.  After Lucy tried to teach Rerun to snap his fingers while walking, Rerun proved unable to snap his fingers because he could only crawl.
