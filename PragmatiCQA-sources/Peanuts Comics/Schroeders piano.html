   . Lucy asks Schroeder to play "Jingle Bells". Schroeder plays it in the style of a conventional piano, then manages to generate the warm tones of a Hammond organ, but Lucy cannot recognize the tune until the now-irritated Schroeder plays it, off-key with one finger, in the tones of a normal toy piano. It's the only time in the history of the television specials that his toy piano ever actually sounds like a toy piano, with 'plinking' sounds. In 1966's

   Schroeder is normally a very passive character, content to play his music, but he can be angered quite easily, especially if his music or his idol Beethoven are insulted. In one short, Lucy points out to him the woefully inadequate single-octave range of a toy piano; an angry Schroeder yanks it out from under, causing her to conk her head on the floor. This became a frequent running gag in the strip's later years. On another occasion, Lucy asked if pianists make a lot of money, and Schroeder flew into a rage: "Who cares about money?! This is

   , you blockhead! This is great music I'm playing, and playing great music is an art! Do you hear me? An art! Art! Art! Art! Art! Art!" (the last five words punctuated by slamming his hands against his piano). However, when Lucy asks the same question in the movie

   special, Lucy tells Schroeder that Beethoven "wasn't so great". When Schroeder defensively demands an explanation, Lucy replies that Beethoven has never been on a bubble gum card and that one cannot be considered great without appearing on one.

   The musical notes Schroeder plays also seem to have substance; characters are able to touch them as they appear in the air. Snoopy, for example, once takes a handful of them, and roasts them over a campfire, and has on at least one occasion been seen dancing atop the musical staff containing the notes. And starting on
   October 9, 1989
   , the notes started falling off Schroeder's piano (although Snoopy always tries putting them back on). Schroeder also is seen using his notes to get rid of Snoopy and Woodstock, sometimes making a slide or cage that takes Snoopy or Woodstock out of his house. He also made a music note kick Woodstock once. Schroeder seems to have the ability to control his music notes.

   Lucy has often spoken of getting Schroeder to give up his piano, such as getting him to realize that married life has financial hardships and he may have to sell his piano in order to buy her a good set of saucepans. On two occasions, Lucy went so far as to destroy Schroeder's piano in an attempt to be rid of the "competition" for his affection, but all attempts failed:

    In a series of strips from
    January 1969
    , Lucy throws the piano into a tree, which is later discovered to be none other than a dreaded

    , which evidently doesn't distinguish between kites and toy pianos. When Schroeder orders a replacement in the strip from
    February 1, 1969
    , Charlie Brown asks if his piano was covered by insurance, to which Schroeder replies, "How do you explain to the insurance company that your piano was eaten by a tree?".

    In her second attempt, from an
    October 1974
    strip series, Lucy throws the piano into the sewer, from which Charlie Brown and Schroeder attempt to retrieve it. Schroeder is able to reach it, but it gets stuck, and then when it starts raining heavily the piano gets washed out to sea.

   One instance in which the piano is destroyed accidentally is in a series of strips from
