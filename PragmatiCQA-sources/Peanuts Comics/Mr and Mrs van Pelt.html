   In a

   story line, in which Lucy kicks Linus out of the house, Linus tells Charlie Brown that Mrs. van Pelt was not home to stop Lucy because she was in the hospital. Lucy is subsequently informed that their mother had given birth to a new baby brother, later named Rerun.

   Like most adults, Mr. and Mrs. van Pelt are not around much, and hardly anything is known about them. However, a running gag with Mrs. van Pelt is how she always puts Rerun on the back of her bike, and rides around with him. In strips from later years, Rerun is often shown unsuccessfully pleading with her to allow him to have a dog.

   , as they both confront an embarrassed Linus whose about to sell his crying brother, Rerun for a bicycle during the song "I Know Now". However, given that Schulz never considered the TV specials canonical, these couldn't be the actual appearances of the real characters.

After Linus is done reading his letter, he and Lucy both say "We really, really, really love you back! Happy Mother's Day!" and they both go to embrace their mother.
