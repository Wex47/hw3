   . Within a short time, however, he had aged to nearly the same age as the other characters. He initially had no notable characteristics, but

   eventually had the idea to incorporate his daughter Meredith's toy piano into the strip. He decided to give it to the strip's newest character, and thus the character as he is known to millions of fans was born. The origin of his name can be found in Schulz's 1975 book,

   "Schroeder was named after a young boy with whom I used to caddy at Highland Park golf course in St. Paul. I don't recall ever knowing his first name, but just 'Schroeder' seemed right for the character in the script, even before he became the great musician he now is."

Schulz once remarked that he had originally decided to depict Johannes Brahms as Schroeder's favorite composer, but decided that Beethoven sounded "funnier."

However, since Beethoven was a lifelong bachelor, Schroeder feels that he must emulate every aspect of his idol's life - even though it is insinuated that he reciprocates Lucy's feelings. In a story arc where she and the rest of her family have moved out of town, Schroeder becomes frustrated with his music and mutters disbelievingly that he misses her. Despite his constant animosity towards her, Schroeder would come to realize that Lucy has unwittingly become his muse and he cannot play without her. In the December 16, 1984 strip,
   Schroeder kisses Lucy on the cheek, but when Lucy turns around, she sees

Also, he will run through a list of complicated signals, only to end up with something to the effect of, "Just throw it down the middle. He'll hit it out no matter what you throw, anyway." He is also described as a good hitter, 'one of the best on the team' Charlie Brown said in one strip. He has also shown a love for hockey in some of the

   Schroeder has a contempt for popular non-classical music. On one occasion Lucy has Snoopy play polkas and waltzes on an accordion and says to Schroeder that, "That's the sort of music people like", whereupon Schroeder puts his hands to his ears and walks away, saying that he cannot stand it. On another occasion Lucy, while leaning against Schroeder's piano as usual, suddenly whispers to him, "Pssst... Hooray for Irving Berlin" — and had to quickly run away as an infuriated Schroeder throws his piano at her.

   Woodstock was known to play with the bars and notation of Schroeder's music on several occasions as well, and even compliment Schroeder's playing with his own singing. Apparently annoyed by his presence, Schroeder would often respond by making the bars and notation chase or throw Woodstock away, or ensnare him in various ways.

   . Lucy asks Schroeder to play "Jingle Bells". Schroeder plays it in the style of a conventional piano, then manages to generate the warm tones of a Hammond organ, but Lucy cannot recognize the tune until the now-irritated Schroeder plays it, with one finger, in the tones of a normal toy piano. It is the only time in the history of the television specials that his toy piano ever actually sounds like a toy piano, with 'plinking' sounds.

   Schroeder is normally a very impassive character, content to play his music, but can be angered quite easily if his music or his idol Beethoven are insulted. In one short Lucy points out to him the woefully inadequate single-octave range of a toy piano; an angry Schroeder yanks it out from under her and sends her flying. On another occasion, Lucy asks if pianists made a lot of money, and Schroeder flies into a rage, saying, "Who cares about money?! This is

   The musical notes Schroeder plays also seem to have substance; characters are able to touch them as they appear in the air. Snoopy, for example, once decorated a Christmas tree using a handful of them, and has on at least one occasion been seen dancing atop the musical staff containing the notes.

Schroeder ordered his replacement pianos from the Ace Piano Company. Along with his new piano, Schroeder received an autographed photo of
   Joe Garagiola
   . Another time Lucy destroyed both his piano and his bust of Beethoven; Schroeder calmly picked out a new piano and bust from a closet well-stocked with duplicate pianos and busts.
