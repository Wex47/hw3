   The film begins in France, at a bar in a village where live music is playing. A man departs the bar, getting into his car. As he drives home, it starts to rain and he passes some greenhouses. He arrives at a chateau, where a little girl (later revealed to be
   Violette Honfleur
   ) begins writing a letter and is seen with a US Army satchel stenciled with the name "S. BROWN".

   During the flight, Charlie Brown produces a letter he received that was written in French. Marcie, who has been studying French, translates it and says it is an invitation from a young girl, Violette Honfleur to stay at the Chateau du Mal Voisin (The Castle of the Bad Neighbour). Peppermint Patty asks who this Violette could be, Charlie Brown has no idea.

   The group first arrives in London and goes on a sightseeing tour downtown, while Snoopy and Woodstock play some tennis at Wimbledon. When Snoopy finds himself losing, he lashes out and gets thrown off the court. Snoopy and Woodstock head to the Victoria Railway Station and rejoin the rest of the group. The group looks at the English countryside while traveling to Dover, then finally arrive to briefly admire the White Cliffs of Dover before boarding a hovercraft that will cross the English Channel. They eventually arrive in France. Marcie uses her French skills to get a rental car for the group (resulting in some humorous scenes where she curses out other drivers during a traffic jam), and Charlie Brown buys some French bread. They drive to a farmhouse where Peppermint Patty and Marcie will be staying with

   . Pierre is a gracious host who appreciates Marcie making an effort to learn his native tongue, but Peppermint Patty thinks he must have an obvious crush on her. Pierre then gets worried that Linus and Charlie Brown went to the Chateau Malvoisin, as it must be some mistake as no one has ever stayed at the Chateau. When Marcie asks about it, Pierre says the Chateau is owned by the Baron, a vile reclusive man who hates everybody, especially foreigners. Pierre makes some phone calls in an attempt to find Charlie Brown, but no one has seen him and Pierre says he is afraid he cannot help Linus or Charlie Brown until they meet up at school.

   The next morning, Charlie Brown and Linus find that breakfast and warm blankets have been set up for them by some unknown benefactor. Meanwhile, at Pierre's farm, Marcie and Peppermint Patty help with Pierre's chores, while Peppermint Patty, oblivious to Pierre's attitude, tries to tell Marcie that he likes her. Peppermint Patty then experiences culture shock as Pierre's family eats soup and sausage for breakfast and that she and Marcie will have to wear a school uniform while back in the States she wore her own clothes to school. Marcie adopts a "When in Rome" attitude and simply tells Peppermint Patty that when one is a guest of a foreign land, one must respect their ways.

   When the gang meets each other at school, Charlie Brown produces the letter from Violette. Pierre says that she is a niece of the baron who owns the chateau; since the Baron is antisocial to his guests, it clearly must have been Violette who invited them to the Chateau. In a reversal of the first scene where Babette and Jacques were introduced to school back in the States, the teacher at the French school introduces Marcie, Peppermint Patty, Linus, and Charlie Brown to her class. The teacher is a nice woman who also says that while the four American kids are in class she will split the instruction between French and English to help teach her class some English words and to accommodate the exchange students. The class sits at tables; and Charlie Brown is made to sit next to Peppermint Patty, resulting in a brief humorous scene, consisting of Charlie Brown being angry at Peppermint Patty for criticizing him.

   That night, the baron leaves the chateau to go to the pub and instructs Violette not to let Charlie Brown and Linus in, even though she protests that they must be hospitable as their family was many years ago, but the Baron is adamant that the new arrivals are not to come in. Meanwhile, Charlie Brown and Linus take turns to stand and watch to identify the mysterious benefactor. During Charlie Brown's watch, he gets sleepier while one of the windows lights up, then Violette appears and sets out flatware for the boys. As she is returning inside, Linus awakens for his shift and is annoyed to see Charlie Brown snoozing. Linus then goes into the chateau to get to the bottom of this. Eventually, he finds Violette, who says her invitation was a mistake. Violette explains that her grandmother had told her the story of a wartime affair that she had with

   , Charlie Brown's grandfather, who was an infantryman stationed in France during the Second World War. Corporal Brown had helped the village and stayed at the Chateau Mal Voisin. Violette shows a photograph of her family, one of them being her grandmother posing with the American soldier. When Silas received his marching orders, he promised to write letters, which he did for some time but they eventually stopped coming. Violette's grandmother moved on, though she never forgot him. Linus remarks that Silas looks like a full-grown version of Charlie Brown.

   Meanwhile, at the pub, Snoopy and Woodstock are playing foosball and overhear the baron confide to the bartender that he knows about Charlie Brown and Linus and has tolerated them long enough, planning to do terrible things to them should they fail to leave by morning. The baron returns home to Violette's surprise, and in her rush to get Linus out of the room, she accidentally knocks over a candle which causes a fire throughout the chateau. Linus takes Violette toward a pair of casement windows, throws them open, and shouts to Charlie Brown for help. Charlie Brown wakes up and runs to the pub to call Snoopy and Woodstock. Snoopy and Woodstock rush off to the Chateau and Charlie Brown continues running to the farmhouse to call Peppermint Patty, Marcie, and Pierre. Pierre calls the fire department while Peppermint Patty and Marcie follow Charlie Brown to the flaming chateau.

   When Snoopy and Woodstock arrive at the chateau, it is engulfed in flames. Snoopy immediately heads to a shed and brings out an old-fashioned fire hose, while Linus throws his

   down to Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, and Pierre, which they use to catch Violette when she jumps out the window. Snoopy arrives with a barrel of water under Linus who also jumps to safety and later barks out instructions to work the hose, but the intense water pressure spins him around, splashing Charlie Brown. Woodstock pops out from the hose with a violin and begins playing along to the dramatic scene. While Snoopy is working with the hose, a fire truck arrives. Four silhouetted men use their hoses, and the fire is soon extinguished.

   The baron, who is thankful that the group saved Violette and the chateau, promises he will never be inhospitable again, and now hosts Linus and Charlie Brown inside the chateau like a proper host. Charlie Brown learns the whole truth behind the mysterious letter he received. Many years ago, a friend of Violette's family was touring the United States and needed his hair cut at one point, and the barber was Charlie Brown's father. This news about the location of the Brown family inspired Violette to write a letter inviting Silas' grandson to stay at the Chateau. As the group prepares to leave the chateau to return to America, Violette gives Silas' satchel to Charlie Brown. The film ends when the group says their goodbyes and gets into their beat-up rental car.

After showing a short clip from the movie (the scene on the plane with Snoopy eating and listening to headphones while hiding Woodstock in the ashtray every time the air hostess walks by) the first item offered is a three-piece set of American Tourister luggage. Following this, a week-long trip to London is offered. Then, after mentioning that Snoopy visits Wimbledon in the movie, Johnny Olson offers a set of two tennis rackets, a supply of tennis balls, and tennis outfits. Then, mentioning that the Peanuts gang goes to Paris on the last leg of their trip, a week-long Paris trip for two is offered. Following that Olsen notes that in Paris the gang rents a car which Snoopy drives - 'being the only one qualified to drive he takes them on the ride of their lives...and you'll have the ride of YOUR life in this new car from France!' - a 1980 LeCar. To top off the showcase a pass for the contestant and 24 of his/her friends to see a screening of the movie on the Paramount lot is offered.

    can be seen in the gaggle of children. Later on, she calls Charlie Brown to say that she is going with him to France as part of a joint effort with her school, implying that she and Marcie go to another school across town like in the strip cartoon.

    After dropping Peppermint Patty and Marcie off at the farmhouse, Snoopy and the boys apparently have to drive for a long time and distance to get to the chateau.

    When the rental car breaks down in the town near the bakery, Peppermint Patty has Charlie Brown go get bread and certain fixings to make sandwiches. One, Charlie Brown only buys the bread and nothing else, and two, even with him losing his share of the bread in the hood of the car, Charlie Brown should not have been left unable to eat at all due to the mysteriously appearing sandwich fixings. He could've eaten the meat and cheese rolled up or something.
