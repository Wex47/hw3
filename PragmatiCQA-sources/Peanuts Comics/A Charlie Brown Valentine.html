He says "I may not be the greatest guy who ever lived, but after all, who is? I'm just a nice type of guy who never gets to meet Little Red-Haired Girl." Just then, the Little Red-Haired Girl walks by, and drops her pencil. Charlie Brown notices it, picks it up, and sees it has teethmarks in it. He realizes this means she nibbles on her pencil, and is human. Charlie Brown decides to use the Little Red-Haired Girl's lost pencil as an excuse to talk to her while returning it to her, but unfortunately,

   , Linus suggests that Charlie Brown call her to invite her to the Valentine's Day dance. Charlie Brown says he can't because he is worried she might hang up in his face. Linus tells him that's the beauty of calling on the phone. If she hangs up on one ear, that is not considered the whole face.

   Later, Charlie Brown with Linus are seen on the phone. He calls the operator and says he would like to talk to a Little Red-Haired Girl. Charlie Brown says he has her number, but doesn't know what to say when she picks up. Then, Charlie Brown finally calls her. However, on the other side of the line, Marcie picks up. Charlie Brown realizes that he dialed the wrong number. He tells that to Marcie, who says she understands, and says he probably meant to call Peppermint Patty. She tells him that Peppermint Patty just happens to be at her house. She gives the phone to Peppermint Patty, who asks Charlie Brown if he called to invite her to his school's Valentine's dance, but before Charlie Brown can answer her, she accepts the offer.

   That night, Charlie Brown puts on a suit, because he has to go to the dance with Peppermint Patty. He invites Snoopy to come with him, and Snoopy puts on a bowtie and goes with him. When they arrive at the party, Charlie Brown is told that Snoopy can't come in because dogs aren't allowed at this party. Charlie Brown tells him, that Snoopy is really a person who came dressed as a dog because he thought it was a costume party, so Snoopy is allowed in.

  <p key="e75bf192-702a-4deb-9ed9-4156f69b9e52">
   At the party, Charlie Brown sees Linus, and Linus tells him the Little Red-Haired Girl is at the party, so he should ask her to dance with him. Charlie Brown decides Linus is right, and starts walking towards the Little Red-Haired Girl, getting more nervous with every step he takes. But before he could make it over to her, Peppermint Patty and Marcie find him, and start dancing with him, much to Charlie Brown's annoyance. When the two girls finally let him go, Charlie Brown realizes the Little Red-Haired Girl is already dancing with somebody else, and that somebody else is Snoopy.

   The special ends with Charlie Brown upset that he did not get the chance to dance with the Little Red-Haired Girl, and did not even receive one valentine. Just then, Snoopy brings Charlie Brown a valentine, and Charlie Brown becomes excited. Linus wishes him a happy Valentine's Day. The special ends there, and it is not revealed who the valentine is from.
