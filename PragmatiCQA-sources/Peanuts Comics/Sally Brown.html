   Since her older brother is the protagonist of the strip and she starts out as a baby, we initially view her through his eyes: she's a kid who needs protecting and guidance, who is too rambunctious, and who is undependable. As she grows into her own, Sally becomes a kind girl who is creative and sentimental. She shares some of her brother's worst tendencies to procrastinate but is more cheerful than he is. She is somewhat aimless but enjoys being a kid and tries to avoid the minimal responsibilities that entail. She's the classic little sister who is too immature for her eight-year-old sibling but she has a highly developed sense of what's just and cares deeply for her loved ones—particularly her

   that Sally wears a retainer, meaning she possibly has dental trouble. For swimming and going to the beach, Sally wears a bikini swimsuit. For bedtime and nighttime, Sally wears a nightgown.

   Sally is the complex younger sister of Charlie Brown. On one hand, she is good-hearted, funny, friendly, cute, sweet, silly and innocent. However, on the other, she can be lazy, ignorant, naive, slow, obsessive, dumb, greedy, insecure, and sometimes even self-centered and manipulative.
  </p>
  <p key="33776be6-6ed8-454b-a54d-4d0a511e5e89">
   Sally has a "take it easy" approach to life, preferring to slide by while doing as little work as possible. Her favorite pastime is sitting in her beanbag chair watching TV. In a series of strips from
   June 1982
   , Sally even goes to "beanbag camp" for the summer, which consists of nothing but lazing around in beanbags, eating snack foods and watching TV. Sally gets fat as a result and needs to exercise when she comes back from camp in order to lose weight.

  <p key="881671b4-321d-4dcf-9153-d0dded57cb36">

   Sally has a lot of trouble in school. For one thing, she has a problem with malapropisms, both in speech and writing. For example, she says "violins broke out" rather than "violence broke out," or "controversial French" instead of "conversational French". One of the strip's running jokes is the unintentionally humorous school reports she gives at the front of the class, which are frequently inspired by malapropisms and end with her feeling humiliated as all of her classmates laugh at her. Some of the more memorable reports she has given over the years include "Santa and His Rain Gear," "Footbidextrousers" people, "The Bronchitis" (a dinosaur which supposedly became extinct from coughing too much), and her report on the oceans of the world, in which she reports that there are no oceans in individual landlocked states in the U.S. She often struggles with homework despite Charlie Brown's patient efforts to help her, and she has a particular dislike for math, which she largely finds both intimidating and incomprehensible. However, she has expressed interest in becoming a nurse once she becomes an adult, although this is due to her interest in wearing white shoes, as opposed to the job itself.

  <p key="74189596-ae63-4a23-beb3-437bbde606a2">
   Sally also can be very ignorant. In one strip, she thinks her family is famous because their name appears in the telephone book. Another time, she is watching TV and wondered why

   Sally has wanted Charlie Brown's bedroom for years. Every time he either leaves home for a while (such as going to summer camp) or talks about leaving, the first thing she always wants to know is if she can have his room while he is gone. A few times, she has actually begun to move her possessions into her brother's room when she thinks he is never coming home, as in one incident from
   May 1976
   when Charlie Brown floats away on his pitcher's mound after a heavy rain (when Charlie Brown does come back, Sally tells him that she supposes that he wants his room back) when he fails to come after falling ill during a baseball game in the strip from
   July 10, 1979

   As a baby, Sally liked playing with empty baby bottles, which she used for everything from building blocks to bowling pins and being taken out for walks. The latter caused poor Charlie Brown no small amount of frustration when he had to miss an important baseball game to walk her around the neighborhood in her stroller. He ended up leaving her to return to the game due to the pleading of his

   September 5, 1962
   at the age of 5. Although the first glimpse of her new school made her run away screaming, she had a wonderful day once she got there. Unfortunately, her lack of aptitude for formal education quickly became apparent, as she nervously admitted in a later strip that she was sure they had made her go through kindergarten again because she had failed flower-bringing. Nevertheless, she did eventually complete kindergarten and settled in at about first or second grade age for the remainder of the strip's run. This makes her older than kindergartners like

In a strip appearing shortly after Sally's birth, Linus is seen scribbling calculations on a fence. when Charlie Brown wanders by, Linus asks him, "When I'm 22 and Sally is 17, do you think she'll go out with me?" When Schulz revived the joke more than a year later, though, it was a now toddler Sally who fell for Linus rather than the other way around. As the infant, grew older she was developing her own personality.

   Being Charlie Brown's little sister, she refers to him as "big brother", having called him by his full name only on very rare occasions (and usually only in her early years in the strip). Charlie Brown doted on her in the beginning and was usually very patient with her. Yet Sally has never developed proper respect for her big brother and invariably ends up disappointed in him when he fails to protect her from being teased, torments, harassed, or threatened by bullies. However, Sally constantly relies on Charlie Brown to help her with her homework, which usually results in him doing her assignments for her.
  </p>
  <p key="76a285e9-57f2-4643-82bd-ec87a2cbee26">
   For his part, Charlie Brown is often frustrated by Sally's laziness and her reluctance to do the right thing when she finds herself in a difficult situation. His attempts to lecture Sally usually either go over her head or simply fall on deaf ears. However, Charlie Brown still always helps her, when it comes to her homework, or bullies, even though Sally rarely appreciates what he does for her.

  <p key="1fba5551-853b-4edc-8ab1-77b1bc5d532c">

   In later years, Sally occasionally enlists Snoopy's help in school assignments - she even treated him to an ice cream cone (a very tall ice cream cone, with scoops of about a dozen flavors) when Snoopy helped her get an "A" on a report about "Our Animal Friends." Sally also once used Snoopy as a "weapon" to help protect her from bullies on the playground (Snoopy would bark loudly at anyone who threatened Sally, leading Snoopy to comment, "I feel like a can of mace!"), but this ended in disaster when Snoopy saw an old girlfriend of his and ran off to meet her, abandoning Sally and leaving her to get "slaughtered" by the playground bullies.
