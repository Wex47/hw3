   June 4, 1970

He sports a mullet-like haircut and, despite being smaller than most of the gang, he is surprisingly depicted as having sideburns in both his comic strip and TV appearances.

    Peppermint Patty

   ask Charlie Brown to come over and lend his baseball glove to a player on her team who does not have one. The player in question is Thibault. After the game, Thibault refuses to return Charlie Brown's glove saying instead, "I'll fight you for it" and later, "I know your kind. You come around here thinking you're better than us." Even after Peppermint Patty threatens to kick Thibault off her team if he does not return Charlie Brown's glove, Charlie Brown himself is delighted that anyone could imagine him as being superior in any way. He is so pleased that he allows Thibault to keep the glove and leaves happily, much to Peppermint Patty's lack of understanding and her outrage. Thibault tells her she sure knows some weird people, so she implies to him that

   play on their team, just because she is a girl. Ironically, he ignores the fact that Peppermint Patty is a girl, too. As a result, Peppermint Patty threatens to "shred him" if he says another word. In the strips which first appeared
   between August 1 and August 4, 1973
   , Thibault continually criticizes Marcie, especially for wearing glasses (as he thinks buying glasses for a girl is a waste of money), and finally, kicks dirt on her shoes. Marcie has Peppermint Patty call a time-out, and then the former threatens to "belt [him] right across the chops" if he says one word. When he says "Oh?", Marcie says, "That was one word!" and punches him. Peppermint Patty sarcastically responds with "Nice going, Marcie... You destroyed my second baseman!" Marcie says she is sorry, got carried away and was going to lecture him on the good qualities of women, but hit him instead. Finally she refuses to play anymore because she hates baseball.
