Charlie Brown is a terrible pitcher, and his efforts often give up tremendous hits which tend to knock him off the mound, leaving him with only his shorts on. However, he shows up for every game with very rare exceptions, and stays even when it starts raining causing everyone else on the team to go home.

   The rest of the team is also poor. It includes Lucy as the right fielder, who might just be the worst player in all of baseball. She almost always misses very easy catches before giving Charlie Brown a lame excuse as to why she missed it (But in the TV special

The team also includes Snoopy as the shortstop, who tends to fall asleep during the game; in at least one strip, a claim is made that he cannot throw, although he can catch the ball rather well using his mouth. The catcher, Schroeder, doesn't know how to throw, and he hides this inability by having something to say to Charlie Brown when walking to the pitchers mound to give the ball back. Although Charlie Brown was seen catching a ball from the direction of home plate in the comic strip on
   May 9, 1973

   playing, a fact that Charlie Brown finds highly dispiriting. In one comic strip both Charlie Brown and Snoopy are chasing a high flying ball-which comes down into Charlie's glove and drops out, only to be caught by Snoopy. Apparently the team wins the game, as the last panel shows the team holding Snoopy aloft in triumph while Charlie Brown is ostracized. This is in keeping with the general poor treatment Charlie Brown gets as the team blames all their failures on him.
