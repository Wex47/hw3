   Snoopy claims to have a "stomach clock" which goes off, when its 6:00, although in one strip the beagle is horrified when he finds that he has missed suppertime because of daylight savings time. When Charlie Brown comes even a little late, Snoopy gets worried. Snoopy also has a "supper dance" which he often does when Charlie Brown brings out his supper. When Charlie Brown sees Snoopy's dance, he says "Why can't I have a normal dog like everybody else?" In the strip from
   April 2, 1988
   , Snoopy calls his supper dance an immature childhood thing to do. In
   August 21 1997
   , Snoopy mentions to
   <a href="Andy.html" key="be62ba0c-b33c-4735-9bff-79ed8e0a4412" title="Andy">

   Snoopy especially loves his supper dish. In the strip from
   January 13, 1962
   , Snoopy wants to run away, but stops when he realizes he would miss his supper dish too much. It is even revealed that Snoopy has a catalog with a picture of every dish he has ever owned in it.

   Snoopy normally wants an earlier supper. He will often say that opening your mouth towards the front door makes suppertime come faster. However, when he tries that, he normally just ends up looking stupid.
