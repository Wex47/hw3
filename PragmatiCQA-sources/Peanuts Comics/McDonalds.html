    McDonald's
   </b>
   is the world's largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. It was founded in 1948 in San Bernadino, California by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald. In 1955, Ray Kroc opened a McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois. Kroc later took over the company from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its expansion worldwide. McDonald's now operates in 118 countries and territories, has 36,525 restaurants and employs more than 420,000 people.
