Peppermint Patty has a more light-hearted personality, while Marcie is usually serious. Because of these differences, the two of them, unlike most other friends in

   Peppermint Patty first met Marcie when she was her camp counselor and went on to become her closest friend. After Marcie became a major character, the two girls almost always appeared together. However, Marcie often irritates Peppermint Patty. At first, Peppermint Patty became annoyed whenever Marcie called her "Sir", and she would continually snap at Marcie, "Stop calling me Sir!" but, eventually by the 1980s, she got used to it, although she still prefers that Marcie

   call her "Sir". Peppermint Patty utters, "Stop calling me Sir!" one last time in the
   November 20, 1988 strip
   - in which Marcie harasses her by uttering "Sir!" seven times in a row, which leads to a fight in the classroom and ending up in the principal's office. Regardless, she still calls Peppermint Patty "Sir" at times, and the reasons for this nickname are unknown.

  <p key="a41bc814-76f2-4e61-b1c2-e12d5ad809d2">
   Marcie also continuously bothers Peppermint Patty by pestering her about doing her schoolwork. Marcie always makes sure Peppermint Patty reads her books or does her homework. Peppermint Patty hates how Marcie pesters her about it. In one storyline, Marcie continually reminded Peppermint Patty to do her book report, and then when the assignment came due, Marcie realized she forgot to do her own.

  <p key="86630439-052e-4524-aea1-42277ce790f3">
   Another thing that gets on Peppermint Patty's nerves is how Marcie knows nothing about sports. She is unable to catch a football or shoot a basket and even calls the Super Bowl the "Splendid Bowl". Marcie has shown some (reluctant) skill at baseball.

   because Peppermint Patty wants to hide her true feelings from him. In one strip, right before Marcie and Peppermint Patty went to camp, Marcie calls Charlie Brown to tell him she loves him, and that makes Peppermint Patty furious.

   Marcie, who is considered Peppermint Patty's sidekick, likes hanging out with Peppermint Patty, although she can get on her nerves too. It distresses Marcie how poorly Peppermint Patty does in school, and how she will never do her work. It also bothers Marcie that Peppermint Patty keeps
