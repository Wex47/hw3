   In strips from the early years, Linus loves his blanket, carries it everywhere, and is not embarrassed by it. He can not survive without it and really suffers when it is being washed. However, in strips from the later years, Linus seems to want to get rid of it, even though he knows he is a mess without it. In one strip he tries to get

   and Snoopy to take his blanket and not give it back no matter how much he begs for it. He is upset when Charlie Brown gives in and returns the blanket, and becomes a mess when Snoopy does not return it. However, when he realizes he is cured of dependency on his blanket, he is thrilled, and upset when Charlie Brown buys him a new one. In another storyline, beginning in the strip of
   April 11, 1983
   , Linus cures himself of the need for his blanket. He is so proud of himself, that he starts going door to door to tell everyone he is cured. He even opens up a
   clinic
   to help children get rid of their security blankets. His only patient is a child named "Randolph" whose head is covered by a blanket. When asked to remove the blanket, "Randolph" is revealed to be

Charlie Brown agrees, but gives it back to Linus as soon as he asks for it, which gets Linus upset.
