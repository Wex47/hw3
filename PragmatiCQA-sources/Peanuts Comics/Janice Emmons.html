   Janice is a new student at Charlie Brown and Linus' school, and has also befriended them. It's strongly implied that Linus has a crush on her. She likes to play on the school swings. However, after she becomes ill at school one day, she is diagnosed with
   leukemia
   , and has to go to the hospital. She loses her hair as a result of the treatment she receives, and has to challenge the teasing of a schoolyard bully (who is told off by Linus), as well as the resentment of her two sisters due to the attention she receives. At the end of the special, she has apparently recovered, her hair growing back longer than before. She has a notably optimistic and brave attitude toward her illness, hoping to eventually recover and return to her normal life, as she says when

   Linus and Janice are both very close friends enjoy each other's company; Linus enjoys pushing her on the swings during recess and spending time with her. Linus has a rather obvious crush on Janice. He is deeply heartbroken when she's diagnosed with leukemia and does whatever he can to support her. He and Janice share a hug when he and Charlie Brown visit her in the hospital. When a bully starts picking on Janice for losing her hair, Linus defends her by furiously telling the bully off and asking him how would he like it if he'd gone through what Janice had gone through with her chemotherapy.  When Linus goes to her house to give her a present for Christmas, her older sister complains about her getting more attention due to her cancer, Linus asks her if she doesn't really mean it, and the sister says she doesn't because she and her little sister feel left out due to Janice getting sick. When Janice returns to school, Linus is more than happy to see her again. When they get to school, Linus pushes her on the swing and to his surprise and happiness, Janice has grown her hair back. He and Janice both rejoice as Janice happily plays on the swings. In various cover art for the book and VHS tape, Linus is depicted of giving Janice a bouquet of flowers.

   Sally and Janice don't interact that much since Sally is too busy complaining about her personal problems, such as waiting for the school bus. When Janice is absent from school, Sally complains why everyone's talking about Janice when she's going to have a bad day at school. When Janice returns back to school, Sally asks her why would she go back to school when she could've stayed home and play, to which Janice responds how it's more fun to be with her friends and that she wants to be at school. It's possible that Sally is aware of Linus's crush on Janice and is jealous with how he spends so much time with her. Despite their issues, Sally is shown to be smiling at Janice when she grows her hair back, showing that she does indeed care for her as a friend.

   Like with his younger sister, even though the two don't interact as much, they're still good friends. Like Linus, he is shocked to hear about Janice's cancer diagnosis. Once Janice was done explaining, he asks her if she's going to die, to which Linus scolds him for asking such a scary question, causing Charlie Brown to blush with embarrassment. When Janice returns back to school, Charlie Brown is happy to see her back and is shown smiling by the swing bars when she gets her long hair back.
