Schulz was also shy and withdrawn. Schulz's "

After he drew his last strip, he looked up and said, "I just realized... that poor little boy is never going to

This has been taken away from me."

   The last original strip ran the day after his death. In it, a statement was included from Schulz that his family wished for the strip to end when he was no longer able to produce it.

As part of his will, Schulz had requested that the

    The characters Charles Schulz created are more than enduring icons. Charlie Brown, Linus, Snoopy, Pig Pen, and Lucy taught us all a little more about what makes us human. Virtually every day for a half-century, Charles Schulz has shown us that a comic strip can transcend its small space on the page. It can uplift; it can challenge; it can educate its readers even as it entertains us. ‘‘Peanuts’’ has done all of these things. I wish Charles Schulz a speedy recovery and a fulfilling retirement.
