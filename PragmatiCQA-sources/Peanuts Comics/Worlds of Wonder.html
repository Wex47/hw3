    Worlds of Wonder
   </b>
   was an American company that produced toys, consumer electronics and video games. It was founded in 1980 by former Atari employees. Worlds of Wonder filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988 and finally ceased all operations in 1990.

   The best-known product manufactured by Worlds of Wonder was Teddy Ruxpin, an animatronic talking  teddy bear which was the best-selling toy of both 1985 and 1986. The toy had an audio tape cassette player built into its back. Its mouth and eyes moved while it appeared to read stories. The rights to Teddy Ruxpin were later sold to
   Hasbro

   that would appear to help the Talking Snoopy to tell stories, functioning the same as the Grubby doll (made to accompany Teddy Ruxpin) and Goofy doll (made to accompany Worlds of Wonder's Talking Mickey Mouse) was also planned to be released, but due to Worlds of Wonder's bankruptcy it was never made. The cassettes were coded with lip sync for Charlie Brown, which will be noticed if a WOW companion doll, like Grubby or Goofy, is plugged in.
