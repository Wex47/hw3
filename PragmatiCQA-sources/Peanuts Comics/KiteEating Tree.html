   Charlie Brown constantly loses kites to the tree. He appears to be the only child who flies kites anywhere near it, therefore, as Charlie Brown notes in the Sunday strip from
   March 3, 1968
   , without him the tree would "starve to death." In a storyline from
   February
   to
   March
   of 1977, to take revenge on the tree, Charlie Brown takes a bite out of it. The tree later blows down in a storm. However, even after the tree blows down, it has made many more appearances, so there is most likely more than one Kite-Eating Tree.
