   Snoopy's life in the court is very realistic. He says he has bad days occasionally and, even though this usually all happens in his imagination, Snoopy loses every case he is given. It is so realistic, he even has to wait a few minutes if there is a recess.

   refuses to help Sally with her homework she threatens to sue him and employs Snoopy as her attorney (she no longer needs Snoopy when she finds out that Charlie Brown is doing her homework). In a series of strips from
   June
   and
   August 1992
   , after Sally's failed flight to Hollywood, she becomes angered when she receives a bill for $100.00 from
   Ace Airlines
   . When Charlie Brown suggests that she sue the airline, Snoopy appears, as his World Famous Attorney alter ego. (Upon reaching the courthouse steps, the World Famous Attorney is too scared to enter, realizing that he is in over his head and Sally refuses to pay for the flight knowing that the pilot would be laid off). Anytime Snoopy is employed as an attorney in real life, the side he is representing loses the case.
