   is convinced by Linus to wait for the Great Pumpkin, who, of course, does not show up. Peppermint Patty is very upset that she missed trick-or-treating. Charlie Brown expresses his disappointment that all he ended up with in his candy bag was a rock. Peppermint Patty says, "I sat in a pumpkin patch for a week, and I didn't get ANYTHING!" to which Charlie Brown replies, "Do you want my rock?"
