  <p key="772f11f6-f5bd-42e1-a74f-fa2adb470464">
   The cat clearly has considerable woodcarving skills and often has a weird sense of humor, that is seen when Snoopy insults him, causing him to slash odd-shaped holes in the doghouse. For instance, when Snoopy goads him by sarcastically asking why he missed his birthday, the cat slashes a hole shaped like a cake with candles.

   Occasionally, Snoopy will attack the cat "off-stage" if someone (such as his friend Woodstock) is in mortal danger. However, Snoopy's attacks usually result in him looking beaten up or scratched when he reappears.

   In a
   December 1974 storyline
   , Snoopy attempts to make friends with the cat in the spirit of the holiday season. He offers a handshake but is wearing a hockey glove—which the cat slashes to shreds. After having a "farewell dinner" for his hand, Snoopy attempts again without wearing a glove—and the cat responds by giving Snoopy a candy cane.
