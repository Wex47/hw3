   The storyline which introduces Truffles begins when Linus and Snoopy (the
   World Famous Truffle Hound
   ) decide to go hunting for the rare fungus
   truffles
   . They search on a farm, where they meet a girl, the granddaughter of the farm's owner, who tells them that they have found Truffles, since that is her name. As she explains in the strip from
   April 1, 1975
   , she was named by her grandfather, who says that she is as rare as a truffle. Linus, Snoopy and Truffles spend a pleasant afternoon together, sheltering in the barn when it begins to rain.

   After leaving the farm, Linus realizes that he has fallen in love with Truffles and is very keen to see her again. Unfortunately for the boy, he cannot remember the way back to her grandfather's farm. Snoopy has also fallen in love with the girl, writing a love letter to her in which he plagiarizes the
   Song of Solomon
   . Snoopy has no difficulty finding where Truffles lives again, visiting her on two more occasions, but refuses to help Linus by leading him back there.

In the strip from January 21, 1977, Linus sees Truffles again and, in the following day's strip, it is revealed that the boy has indeed come back to Truffles' grandfather's farm. Unlike in her previous appearances, Truffles actually seems romantically interested in Linus this time. However, her interest in him annoys
