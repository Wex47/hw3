   ﻿Miss Othmar was first mentioned on
   October 5, 1959
   and, from the start, Linus had a big crush on her.
  </p>
  <p key="b5a3c093-f2b6-484b-b81a-1fbd5909d57d">
   After an extended sequence where Linus repeatedly forgets to bring in egg shells for a class project, Miss Othmar quits her job to get married in the strip from
   February 5, 1960
   (Linus announces that he is going to give her the egg shells as a wedding present in the following day's strip).
   Now named "Mrs. Hagemeyer", she writes to Linus telling him that she misses all her students, but misses him most of all. Linus floats on air upon reading this.
  </p>
  <p key="158a9a43-8d52-4678-a81a-ba26134f536c">
   Miss Othmar returns to teaching a little over a year later. Although she is presumably still married, she uses her maiden name professionally. As Linus puts it, in the strip from
   September 2, 1961
   , "In real life, she's Miss Othmar!"
  </p>
  <p key="bed0fd71-2114-40f5-8608-46099bf29c44">
   In a series of strips starting on
   February 24, 1969
   , Miss Othmar goes on a teacher's strike. Exhausted from several days' picketing, she falls to her knees. Linus rushes to her side and picks up her sign. The next day, she is fired. Her replacement, Miss Halverson, meets with some resistance from Linus, who remains very loyal to Miss Othmar.
  </p>
  <p key="5486b295-2fb3-4af7-9f68-bf605331726a">
   Oddly, despite having been fired in 1969, Miss Othmar is used as the teacher's name (both times by Linus) in strips on
   September 11, 1973
   and
   November 16, 1990
   .

  <p key="23eadb79-abc3-4506-978f-7f6d0635fd18">
   Apparently, Miss Othmar goes on to teach music, because, in a strip from
   October 4, 1979
   , Marcie mentions that she is getting organ lessons from Mrs. Hagemeyer (once again using her married name).

   's teacher. In a strip from the mid-1960s, it is revealed that Charlie Brown's teacher's name is "Mrs. Donovan". However, Charlie Brown sometimes shows up in Miss Othmar's classroom (usually sitting behind Linus) in strips from the late 1960s onwards. In one series of strips, Miss Othmar continually selects Charlie Brown to pound the chalkboard erasers, filling his lungs with so much chalk dust that he exhales it for days afterward.

   Linus has a big crush on Miss Othmar. In the strip from October 8, 1959, he says he does not worship her, but is fond of the ground she walks on.
  </p>
  <p key="150b15f0-8850-4c02-a093-0ff06db260a7">
   Linus loves pretty much everything Miss Othmar does. One exception to this is, he does not like her opinion of his

   , "This means Linus is going to have to choose between his blanket and Miss Othmar, doesn't it?" Just then Linus walks by holding his blanket and says, "Who's Miss Othmar?"
   so it is clear which one he chose. However, when Miss Othmar is not talking about his blanket, Linus really likes her.
