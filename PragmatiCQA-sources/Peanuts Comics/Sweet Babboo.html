   's wife, Jean Schulz, who called her husband the same thing. Sally first calls Linus by the name in the strip from
   January 27, 1977

   This pet name seems to annoy Linus. Almost any time Sally mentions that Linus is her Sweet Babboo, Linus screams, "I'm not your Sweet Babboo!", whether or not he is visible in the strip or on screen. Once, when Linus was not around, Sally mentioned something to
   <a href="Charlie Brown.html" key="c19c724a-0a74-4104-8bea-ce32ce25e16c" title="Charlie Brown">

   In the strip from
   February 11, 1991
   , Sally refers to herself as Linus' "Sweet Babbooette", to which Linus responded, "I've never heard of a 'Babbooette'!" In the strip from
   February 15, 1983
   when Sally gets so annoyed about Linus ignoring her, she calls him, her "Sweet N' Sour Babboo".

   The only other character who called Linus "My Sweet Babboo", was

    Eudora
   </a>
   in the
   October 14, 1978
   strip, to which Sally called out, "He's not your Sweet Babboo!". Eudora calling Linus her Sweet Babboo, did not seem to annoy Linus that much.

    Rerun

   to deliver her Valentine to Linus, Rerun misreads it as "Sweet Baboon", to which Sally corrects him by saying "Babboo" and explains what a "Babboo" is.
