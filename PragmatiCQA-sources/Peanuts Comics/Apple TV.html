   It was founded in October 2019, and is intended to compete with existing services like Netflix in a medium that apparently is on its way to eclipse broadcast television in popularity. Originally, its content policy was to present only original commissioned productions, such as

   To that end, on October 19, 2020, Apple TV+ announced it would be making all the franchise's television specials available exclusively on the service, apparently ending the franchise's 55 year era on broadcast television. However, the service also announced that each of the major holiday specials would be made available as each American holiday approached, beginning with
