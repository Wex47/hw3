   often reread Snoopy's work, and give him suggestions how to fix the story. Snoopy does not make very good use of their suggestions. For instance, in one strip Linus says Snoopy's stories all begin the same way, and tells the beagle he should change that. Snoopy responds by writing, "It was a stormy and dark night." In another strip, Lucy says Snoopy's stories would be improved by having more of a "once upon a time" beginning. Snoopy then writes, "Once upon a time it was a dark and stormy night".

   Snoopy often sends his stories off to be published. Initially he meets with success, but that quickly fades, and the publishers begin hating his stories, sending him an endless series of rejection slips. Sometimes, the rejection slips are very cruel and personal. For instance, one says, "We regret to tell you that your story does not suit our present need. On second thought............ Actually we don't regret it at all." Another says "After reading your last story we just have one question. What did we ever do to hurt you?" In the strip from
   June 18, 1974
   , it is revealed that Snoopy has enough rejection slips for

Snoopy eventually manages to get a story published once again, in the strip from

   . However, nobody buys a copy of his novel.

When Charlie Brown reads this to Snoopy, the beagle immediately abandons writing the biography and starts playing at being the
