   gets on casually, only to get kicked off. Sally, after hearing her brother remind Snoopy that dogs aren't allowed on the bus, simply says "Woof." to try getting out of having to get on, only for her brother to order her on.

  <p key="24460783-0957-4044-8397-30125dae9dab">
   While getting on the bus, Janice accidentally hits her arm on the bus railing, causing it to bruise. Linus notices that Janice bruises easily, and she mentions that she never used to. When they arrive at school, Janice starts feeling so ill that she has to go home sick. Three days later, her classmates discover that she is in the hospital.
  </p>
  <p key="ab6902d4-8cc3-480d-a1d8-a2792b1c7953">
   After school, Linus and Charlie Brown decide to visit Janice in the hospital, where she tells them that she has leukemia. Charlie Brown asks if Janice is going to die, which upsets Linus for a moment, but Janice assures them otherwise. She explains what tests the doctors did to discover that she had leukemia and explains that while some of the tests were painful, not all of them were. She then shows them her
   IV line
   and explains her
   chemotherapy
   . Janice expresses her determination to recover from her illness, vowing to return to school and play on its swings once again. The news of his friend's illness hits Linus especially hard, and when he and Charlie Brown leave the hospital, Linus turns to him and asks, "Why, Charlie Brown, why?". He then goes home feeling sad and angry for what happened to Janice.
  </p>
  <p key="8bbcb021-32ec-45ff-94e3-ebe0b1681309">
   Once at home, Linus tells his sister
   <a href="Lucy van Pelt.html" key="e43c96aa-8ebc-4bc3-a73d-54219e1692d8" title="Lucy van Pelt">
    Lucy
   </a>
   about Janice's illness. Lucy at first does not seem to care, but when Linus mentions that he touched Janice's forehead when she felt ill at school, Lucy is immediately worried that Janice's illness might be contagious. Linus explains that cancer is not contagious, but then Lucy makes a rude remark about Janice, saying that she got the illness for being "a creepy kid". Linus, annoyed, explains to Lucy that Janice did not get the illness for doing something wrong. Lucy, however, refuses to change her ignorant (but fittingly childlike) attitude towards Janice's condition, and demands that Linus take back the glass of milk he handed her earlier, fearing that he might be transmitting the illness. Linus gets back at Lucy by refusing to accept the milk, so as not to get her "crabbiness".
  </p>
  <p key="6707fb35-8a1e-4082-9def-b471b183dfcb">
   Sometime later, Janice comes back to school, wearing a cap to cover her bald head, as she has lost her hair because of the chemotherapy. This attracts the attention of a
   schoolyard bully
   , who makes fun of Janice's baldness until an enraged Linus explains that she has cancer and asks the other boy if he would like to go through what she has gone through. The bully quickly softens and apologizes.
  </p>
  <p key="194c7863-5747-409f-b407-dfe8c2062594">
   As Christmas approaches, Linus goes to Janice's house to give her a present, but her
   sisters
   inform Linus that she is at the hospital again, receiving treatment. One of the sisters complains about the attention Janice has been receiving, but later admits she and her other sister feel excluded due to Janice's illness. Linus gives her the present and leaves.
  </p>
  <p key="1c18a9e3-3778-43a5-852f-912c2c19f1ed">
   By the beginning of spring, Janice returns from the hospital and tells Linus she has a surprise for him, and she reveals the surprise at the end of the special while playing on the swings: her long blonde hair has grown back even longer than it was before, marking the end of her chemotherapy and her apparent recovery and presumed remission from the illness. As the credits roll, her cap falls to the ground, and Janice laughs one last time.

    Originally planned as a 5-minute educational video to be shown to young cancer patients, Charles M. Schulz suggested that the project be expanded to a full half-hour special. CBS and producer Bill Melendez initially balked at the idea, but went ahead with it, due to Schulz's enthusiasm of the project. Schulz was touched by the idea, as his mother Dena succumbed to cancer on the night he was drafted for WWII. Schulz himself would later succumb to cancer on February 12, 2000, mere hours before his final strip appeared in newspapers worldwide.

    It is extremely unlikely that Janice's hair could regrow as long as it does in such a short time frame.
