  <p key="8ad17746-d8b0-4abc-8beb-c99bdbd64a97">
   The grandmother has featured in the strip's storyline a few more times over the years, and always tries to get Linus to give up his blanket. Linus always dreads her visits. Sometimes, she is successful in stealing Linus' blanket, but he always finds a way to take it back. Linus also uses tricks to prevent his grandmother from finding it, such as using a decoy blanket.

   In one storyline which originally ran between
   August 28
   and
   September 13, 1967
   , Linus says he will give up his blanket if his grandmother gives up smoking, which she does. After their grandmother keeps her side  of the bargain, Lucy hides Linus' blanket to prevent him from touching it. The boy sends a spy (

   ) to find out where the blanket is hidden but the beagle fails in his mission.
After Linus has been without his blanket for two weeks, Lucy declares that her brother is cured of his dependency on it and announces that she is going to burn it. Linus, however, rescues the blanket and tells Lucy that neither she nor their grandmother can part him from it.

   In the series of strips which originally ran from
   January 10, 1963
   , Linus' blanket is taken away after he makes fun of his grandmother for drinking thirty-two cups of coffee. After he apologizes, his blanket is returned to him.

   never has anything to do with his grandmother when she visits and tries to steal Linus's blanket. He always just stays out of the picture. However, Rerun seems to love talking to his grandmother on the phone, and tells her about kindergarten. It is possible that Rerun is talking to his other grandmother, and not the blanket-hating grandmother.
