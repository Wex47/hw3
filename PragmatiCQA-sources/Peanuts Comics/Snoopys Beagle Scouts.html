   The birds often take silly things with them on hikes, such as sundials and surfboards. Pizza is also often taken with them, but Snoopy favors Harriet's choice of angel food cake with seven minute frosting. The birds are often rather lazy, slacking off rather than obeying orders from Snoopy, such as one occasion where they play at a fair instead of set up camp. They can also be cowardly, panicking at the slightest scares. This is shown where when Snoopy is testing their responses to danger, they quickly fail when Snoopy gives a test alarm for "chicken hawk."
