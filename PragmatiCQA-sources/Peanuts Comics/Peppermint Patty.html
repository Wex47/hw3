   Peppermint Patty is well known for her identity as a tomboy; she often plays sports and is probably the jock of the Peanuts gang. Peppermint Patty can often be very lazy, especially when it comes to school. She is widely known for receiving a D− grade on every test or assignment in school (in 1999, the final full year of

   , her teacher presented her with a certificate placing her in the "D-Minus Hall of Fame"). In one comic strip, she got a Z-, which she called "sarcasm". She also finds patterns in her true-or-false tests, and often says her answers out loud ("True! False! False! True!") In a series of strips from 1984, Peppermint Patty is held back a grade for failing all of her classes—only to be allowed to return to her old class when her old desk in front of Marcie starts to emit snoring noises, leading children and faculty alike to suspect that the classroom is haunted by a "snoring ghost". Peppermint Patty's bad grades are possibly exacerbated by her tendency to sleep through class. This has been explained by saying that her father works late, and she is too insecure to sleep until he returns home.

   Peppermint Patty can be dimwitted; until
   March 21, 1974

   was a dog. Her realization came during a period when she refused to go to school and instead attempted to stay with Snoopy. During a scuffle with Marcie,

   (which she thinks is a “guest cottage”) is destroyed, and Marcie finally convinces her friend that Snoopy is a beagle, not a "funny looking kid with a big nose."
  </p>
  <p key="4eef5e60-9760-4692-8002-9189c8b4d6af">
   Peppermint Patty's obtuseness got even more pronounced such as when she applied to a school for Gifted Children with a big sack expecting to receive things until the school representative explained to her embarrassment the complete misunderstanding she had about the institution. Furthermore, Peppermint Patty enrolled into the Ace Obedience School at Snoopy's recommendation, took the curriculum with the other dogs and never seriously questioned why she was the only human participating in that manner. She later graduated and found out to her total humiliation later when the principal of her regular school explained what she had done. Furthermore, when Patty went after Snoopy for this fiasco, she was convinced that the ferocious cat next door,

   </a>
   , was Snoopy in disguise for absolutely no rational reason and attacked him, forcing Snoopy to come to Patty's rescue. Finally, Peppermint Patty exacerbates her stupidity from these mortifications by then stubbornly blaming everyone who tried to warn her and she blindly ignored to her sorrow.

   Peppermint Patty is a star athlete, especially in baseball, where her team regularly trounces

   </a>
   . In the first series of strips in which Patty appeared from 1966, she actually joins his team as its new pitcher, relegating Charlie Brown to the outfield. However, she quits in disgust after only one game; despite tossing a no-hitter and slamming five home runs, her new team loses, 37-5, because of their somewhat porous defense. In another strip she let Charlie Brown pitch the last throw of the game (Peppermint Patty pitched a no-hit, no-run game and were leading 50–0 on the 9th inning, 2nd out, 2nd strike), only to see Charlie Brown lose the game.

   One of Peppermint Patty's most troublesome traits, however, is her tendency to only hear what she wants to hear from others. Oftentimes, she will ask a favor or request of someone, and regardless of whether or not they even respond in the first place, will assume they have already agreed to comply, typically because she never gives them an opportunity to respond. Such instances include when in

   (which is based on a series of strips from

Despite her continuous declarations of the fact she has no idea how to sew, Marcie is strong-armed into trying to create a dress for Peppermint Patty, which turns out disastrous.

   While academics are Peppermint Patty's weak spot (D minus is her most frequent grade), athletics are her strong suit (despite wearing sandals, which might be expected to hamper her movement). In her first storyline, she helped out Chuck's baseball team, though she later got her own team. She also has appeared playing football, hockey, and figure skating. In strips from later years, she loves playing football in the rain to emphasize how tough she is.
