   Radim appears to be a tall slim and slightly muscular man, who is almost always seen wearing his trademark black sunglasses. He has relatively long spiked black hair.
  </p>
  <p key="cd2fe2d5-b3e7-43f3-a5b3-00995b3be791">
   During his involvement within the tournament's second round, Radim chooses to wear more formal clothing which is befitting of his title and role as official commentator, consisting usually of a simple white dress shirt, a brightly colored tie, and black pants.
  </p>
  <p key="499a48fa-485e-4133-80a7-46bf77093ebf">
   Like any of the other Patch Tribe Priests he also wears traditional Native American robes, however, he normally reserves these only for ceremonies and other special events. While in his Plant he does wears some of these robes but only a single element, in the form of loose pants. Radim's choice to not wear any form of a shirt is a conscious decision, as this alone reduces his weight, which is vital since his guardian ghost requires such a light load to move at high speeds.

   Unlike most of the other officiants, he tries his best to remain neutral calm, but at times has openly agreed that he doesn't approve of much of Hao's ideals. He is constantly making ridiculous odd comments and announcements during the fights and mostly he acts much like a coward when the larger over Souls appear, such as with the "Yamata No Orochi Go", or crying in fear that he was

   when seeing of Mephisto E.

   However, when Yoh and his friends met him in the Plant of the Lake, he showed his serious side and even said that it was sad that he had to fight them. But he still attacked them because of his sense of duty. Even though, he is still a kind person and even offered them to go home.

  </p>
  <p key="9438f51d-45ca-47be-93f8-0491ed41fd8b">
   Due to the high intensity of the Shaman Fights and the fact that he has to supervise every single one of them, his sunglasses are special made, to block of any kind of extreme light.
   During the battle he quickly analyses the weaknesses of his opponent and he can easily calculate the Furyoku consumption of his opponent Over Souls and attacks.
