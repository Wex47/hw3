   Kalim is a very tall and heavy muscular man. His face appears very rough looking which, according to Silva, scares the customers away and is the reason why they cannot sell anything. He has waist long black curly hair and wears a red native American headband beneath the hair with two feathers, on each side, in it.

While in battle, he removes his Patch Cloak to reveal a bare upper body with bracelets around his upper arms and gloves. In a neckless around his neck, he wears a chest armor made of long blue straws.

Although he is sitting on the streets with normal people around him, he still wears the bull skull on his crotch area. Like all the other Patch Priests, all of his clothes are handmade.

   He then proceeds to punch him in the gut believing he only got knocked out and calmly asks who is to fight him next, although, as he puts it himself, he normally wouldn't do, it is regulation. Horohoro who is still hanging in his fist, announces that he is because there fight had not ended yet. Kalim proceeds to throw him away to which Horohoro smirks, saying that now he could counterattack. However, before he could anything is he knocked out by Yoh. When Kalim asks if Yoh is his next opponent, Yoh denies this and then he fuses with Faust's spirit with his own to give Horohoro medical treatment.

As Horohoro calls himself pathetic after revealing this, he wants to know what Kalim now thinks about him now. Kalim only laughs and calls it quite cute, saying that thanks to him he can now fight with his full heart as well. This revelation, causes
