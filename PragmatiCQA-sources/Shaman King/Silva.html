   Silva has trained with the Patch Tribe for a long time and is, therefore, a strong shaman with enough Furyoku to materialize five nature spirits at the same time. At the end of the tournament when Yoh and the others invade the Plants, Silva appears and stops them on their way. During this time he reveals an enormous strength, having materialized his five totems on a higher plane and making them fairly even stronger. It was later revealed by Bron that they had "taught" him the true way of the Patch and that his devotion is what had made him stronger. Later on, Bron also revealed that his powers also come from the Patch Song, which gives more Furyoku and also focuses the mind.

Jaguarman, who is otherwise supposed to be the fasted Over Soul ever, and when Lyserg tries his luck in attacking he is stopped too and is caught by Silver Rod.

Ren then tells Silva that there is someone even more eager to fight him and points at Yoh. Yoh who has already created his Over Soul proclaims that ever since he faced Silva in the tests, he had always had a desire to fight him again and defeat him.
