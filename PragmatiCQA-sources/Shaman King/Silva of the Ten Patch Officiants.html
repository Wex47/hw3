   Silva is a tall and muscular man with long black hair that is braided into two large bangs on each side of his face. Like all the other members of the Patch Tribe, he wears a Native American cloak with a red headband. The headband has two large feathers on the side and a white pattern. Like many other Patch Priests, he wears a silver plate on his chest, resembling an eagle, a reference to one of his guardian ghosts, Silver Wing.

   He has five silver rings on his right hand, each shaped like one of his five totem ghosts, thus allowing him to materialize them on his hands, and in a leather sheath on his right leg he carries a handcrafted knife, used as a medium for his O.S. Totem Pole Cannon.

   His battle clothing consists of angle long black pants, and a blue top shirt tied together with strings in a cross pattern across his chest. Around his waist is a sash styled in the same way as his headband that holds a small silver scarf that is placed horizontally down his legs. Also attached to the sash are two brown leather straps, the right holding the sheath for his knife. His shoes consist of black cloth with a silver plating all the way around. He wears bracelets on his wrists used to hold the mediums for two of his spirits.

   Silva has trained with the Patch Tribe for a long time and is, therefore, a strong shaman with enough Furyoku to materialize five nature spirits at the same time. At the end of the tournament when Yoh and the others invade the Plants, Silva appears and stops them on their way. During this time he reveals an enormous strength, having materialized his five totems on a higher plane and making them fairly even stronger. It was later revealed by Bron that they had "taught" him the true way of the Patch and that his devotion is what had made him stronger. Later on, Bron also revealed that his powers also come from the Patch Song, which gives more Furyoku and also focuses the mind.

Yoh who has already created his Over Soul proclaims that ever since he faced Silva in the tests, he had always had a desire to fight him again and defeat him.
