   Ryu is a very muscular man with a unique appearance. He usually wears an exaggerated 70's white 3 piece suit with a purple shirt that has oversized collars and cuffs, while wearing a pair of white pointy shoes. He has an exaggerated goatee and sideburns that both end in a spike. While using his initial Over Soul, his collar would grow larger, more rugged, and spiked.

   His crowning glory is a

   During his first few appearances, Ryu acted like a typical delinquent who had no respect for anyone besides just only himself. However, once the series progresses it is seen that he is a very passionate and emotional person who deeply cares for his friends and is ready to sacrifice anything, even himself, for them. Ryu's most commendable trait is probably his sense of loyalty, which once lead him to take an attack for Yoh that completely froze him, only to prove that his passion was burning so much that it melted the ice. At one point, he even cried when talking about his gratitude for Anna`s harsh training.

  <p key="8bef3419-df85-44c3-9c2a-ea9c66bc5364">
   All of his life Ryu has been searching for a "Best Place". A passion shared by his gang and at the beginning of the series, the group would constantly be found looking for their very own best place. His reason for joining Yoh in the Shaman Fights is to find his best place, which he later believes is the world Yoh will create when he becomes Shaman King.

He tricks Amidamaru into attacking Harusame and fights back with a new technique called Tokage Kenpo (Lizard Style). After remembering how much Harusame was important. Amidamaru still breaks Harusame, and Tokageroh is left shocked. Yoh says that Tokageroh had already lost, because of Amidamaru's long-life commitment to his best friend Mosuke. He tells him that he should rest in peace and move on. Tokageroh refuses and says he will die and Amidamaru with him. Ryu's gang then attack him and say that they do not want Ryu to become a scumbag, and they will always be friends with Ryu no matter what happens.

   Soon after, Tokageroh pulls out a knife and tries to kill Ryu, but the painful stress of two souls in one body makes him unable to control Ryu's body. However, he discovers that if he does not leave Ryu's body, then Ryu will soon die, but Tokageroh felt pretty comfortable with that. Having no other option, however, Yoh offers Tokageroh to take his body, which he does.

Namari notes the Ryu is good but tells him that destroying his Over Soul once will not be enough and produces another one. Ryu agrees, saying that his intention was not to slice up the snake but to defeat Namari, before going to attack Namari's Over Soul. However, as Ryu travels closer, Namari reveals it to be a mirage, appearing suddenly behind Ryu and attacking him. Ryu reveals his knowledge of Namari's strategy, as the latter only attacked from a distance and wouldn't reveal it until the opponent jumped into his reach. Ryu voices his disappointment in "such a cheap trap" but that he was glad that Namari finally revealed it. He admits that he does not know if he could compete with it but consents with having let everyone know. Namari springs a surprise attack on Ryu but Ryu blocks it with great agility, surprising Namari, who realizes that Ryu had expected a trap since the beginning.
