   Asakura Yoh is 13 years old at the beginning of the Shaman King series and a normal teenage boy. He has neck-length dark brown hair and he is constantly seen wearing a pair of orange headphones behind or on his ears. He normally wears his school uniform with his shirt constantly open but when it gets cold he will button up his shirt, wear a necktie and the standard school uniform jacket.
  </p>
  <p key="abff9452-46c0-4e67-8ddf-5f79fd858a89">
   In combat, he wore a black vest and trimmed shorts with an orange lining, and wrap-up sandals. During the second round of the Shaman Fights, he is depicted wearing a shirt with a

  <p key="4fe11ae1-9c2e-41fb-97a0-ab62cb117cc8">
   In between the battles of the Second Round of the Shaman Fights, he wore a yukata, a blue robe tied together with an orange sash around the waist, where he keeps

   Around the age of 17 and when Hana was still only a baby, he began to dress in jeans pants, a short-sleeved white t-shirt and a plaid printed scarf. His hair was slightly longer and just past his shoulders. At the age of 22 Yoh's hair is now waist length and wavier. He no longer wears his orange-colored headphones and bear claw necklace and instead of an open shirt, he now wears a plain white t-shirt. Attached to his orange pants is one of Hao's star earrings and he now wears brown leather sandals.

  </h2>
  <p key="43d983c0-e86d-4dd5-b072-c8b8d121eaf8">
   As a slacker by nature, Yoh maintains a carefree, laid-back attitude about everything, even with achieving his goal of becoming Shaman King. Because he was alienated by everyone outside of the family he instead chose to bond with spirits and has decided that anyone who can see spirits cannot be evil.
  </p>
  <p key="e4958cce-562c-40c3-b7eb-639cf5fe2914">
   Although generally seen as lazy and uncaring to most things, Yoh holds wisdom well beyond his age as he thinks outside common norms and principles, with many people being unable to read his flexible and unique nature. While his comments and general demeanour give an impression of irresponsibility and lack of commitment which has often infuriated others, Yoh operates out of a sense of empathy. He does his utmost to help others (and himself) to stop carrying unnecessary burdens that wear oneself down, and potentially lead to self-destruction, something that is not initially perceived at first glance from his attitude, but has caused the many people he has met to start questioning themselves and the path they should follow. His signature phrase "Everything will work out"

   </span>
   is a means by which he believes things will eventually turn out for the better, without stressing oneself unnecessarily over the things they are able to handle. Despite not looking like it, Yoh acts seriously in mostly all instances, but always trying to keep true to himself.
  </p>
  <p key="2978e149-2882-4974-9986-88bb85043ec1">
   Because of his empathic nature, Yoh is rarely on bad terms with anyone and always decides to make friends with the people he meets. He cares deeply about his friends, even at one point quitting from the Shaman Fight out of a deal with

   . Although he deep down disliked the idea of abandoning the fight, he nonetheless resolved himself, as he could not be at peace with himself knowing his friend was dead while being able to do something. It is also as a result of his empathy that he is able to try and understand his opponents' reasonings and motivations, comprehending their stances, but also showing where such beliefs might be misplaced and downright damaging to others and themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="ec62c9f7-54c8-443c-a69a-7b3679d6cea2">
   Despite of this, Yoh is openly against senseless violence and indiscriminate murder, showing uncharacteristic rage when people's lives are lost. He vehemently disagrees with the idea of revenge, as he believes it is an endless cycle of mutual hatred that only causes harm and never brings any conclusion or satisfaction and even drag third parties into the struggle, which will subsequently seek revenge on their wrongdoers in a never ending pool of spilled blood and conflict. He nonetheless, understands that actions have consequences and that such displays of irrational hatred will find themselves reversed, although he doesn't personally approve of such outcomes full of misery. It is because of these beliefs, that Yoh does in fact hold a negative view of humanity as well, as it is their greedy, self-centered nature that has caused great harm to the world for no real reason, but nonetheless doesn't succumb to the same levels of extreme misanthropy as Hao.

  <p key="2a51d41f-b11e-46f5-9d1c-3bb01bf8a5bb">
   Even though it is rarely seen, Yoh truly loves Anna and has decided that, when he becomes Shaman King, he will make her life easy. Simply by seeing her face for the first time, it made him blush. Before he left for America for the Shaman Fight, Anna asked him "Tonight... may I sleep beside you?" and his response was "Yes."

   Ever since Anna became his fiancée, Yoh has constantly been submitted to exhausting and painful training which in turn caused him to gain a tougher and stronger body. During the battle, he is very flexible, intuitive, and completely relaxed and calm at the same time. It is due to this relaxed and calm attitude that he learns to negate

   and Yoh. Opacho commented that the Hao she knew wasn't here anymore and Yoh was able to deduce that Hao was controlling his body even though his spirit had already moved on as the Shaman King. Yoh then states that this Hao is nothing but a walking dead corpse and decapitates it.
   Hao, however, doesn't die most likely due to being omnipotent after his merge with the Great Spirit.

   After he grins, Yoh's soul and Amidamaru are seen being absorbed by Hao. When Yoh wakes up, he realizes he must be inside the Great Spirit and Hao appears, revealing that he's actually inside him and in the highest society of the Great Spirit, the society of the Shaman King where only people Hao wishes to enter may come. The two start a conversation during which Yoh reveals that he too dislikes humans because they really are destroying the Earth. But he also admits that he could never go as far as to kill them, so Hao orders him to leave. Somehow Yoh isn't banished and

Before Hao can destroy the Elemental Warriors with a black hole, the Soul Train appears to anchor the five. Yoh is able to calm down Hao and tells him that his late mother was always beside him as a spirit. After Hao recounciles with his mother, he lets everyone return to Earth but told Yoh that he still hates humankind, only will let them sort out their problems before he passes judgment, and not to be so impertinent.

   . She and Yoh begin traveling the world with their infant son, but while in the Middle East they were killed and ended up in Hao's realm in the Great Spirit. There Anna forces him to revive all three of them through blackmail. Hao does so while implanting Oni's into Hana to act as a fail-safe to prevent him from dying. Sometime after this Hana is given to Tamao to be raised under her care and after Anna and Yoh have been away for a long time, Hana comes to believe Tamao is his real mother. Anna was briefly seen in the Funbari no Uta walking with an adult Asakura Yoh, from the Funbari Hill station back to the Inn.

   When Yoh and Anna finally arrive in Funbari they get lost in the airport, something that greatly annoys Ren when he learns of it and calls for Ryu to pick them up. When Chocolove, Ren, and Horohoro discuss their last encounter with Hao, Yoh and Anna finally arrive and Yoh says his catchphrase that "

   Yoh is revealed to have grown very tall and his hair is extremely long. He then awkwardly tries to apologize for his and Anna's absence by saying that they had things to do all around the world and could not come back earlier. At first, Hana seems to be in tears and even stutters the word "

   As they return to the Funbari Inn, Yoh and Anna sit down at the shrine of their dead friends and family and make their prayers. Towards the end, Ryu prepares a feast and they are all seen having a party together and even Manta arrives at the joy of everyone except Ren who was attacking Horohoro.

   Later during the night, a parcel arrives from the Patch Village and Anna comes in to reveal it is a book over the Shaman Fights that had transpired in Tokyo. She says that their battle has not yet ended and that they should remember that the next Shaman Fights are only half a millennium away. When Yoh, lying in front of her, says that it was so far ahead in time that even the

She says that the next fight maybe five centuries away but she still wants one of the Asakura descendants to take the Shaman King crown, and orders Yoh to start reading it. She gives Yoh a death glare and says that he dare not forget the promise he made her.
