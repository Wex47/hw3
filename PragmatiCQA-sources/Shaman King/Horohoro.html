   Born Usui Horokeu on November 27, 1985. Horohoro is an Ainu from Hokkaidō, a prefecture in Japan. He was raised by his tribe to be the one that participated in the Shaman Fights to save their village. As part of this goal, he intends to plant a vast field of Butterbur. He was raised with the belief that the strongest prey on the weakest.

  <p key="1de22ae2-7f3b-41c2-af7b-79dd38596289">
   When Horohoro was a child, a new girl named Kurobe Tamiko moved to the small village he lived in. Her family had moved there because her father was constructing a dam that would eventually destroy everything in the area, making her shunned by all. Being lonely like Horohoro, she wanted to become friends with him and even gave him his nickname Horohoro. However, the Ainu tribe Elder forbade Horohoro to be with her. Horohoro stopped talking to her and Damuko did not know why. One year later, after following Horohoro into the mountains Damuko died by exposure to the elements through the rest of the village people believed that she died in an accident in the woods. Horohoro blamed himself for killing her and never forgave himself. Sometime later he met Kororo and made her his spirit ally.

   A few days later he has his snowboard fixed and Horohoro flies off a mountain, but with no Over Soul. He is found by the park ranger Bluebell and he spends the next three days unconscious. Horohoro wakes up and thinks he had a dream then he looks at what is around him and yells "

   Bluebell goes upstairs to sleep but Horohoro has other plans. He changes his battle clothes, grabs his new Prayer stick and goes out in the forest. Horohoro finds Apollo the bear that bluebell has raised from a cub. Bluebell arrives on the scene by hitting Horohoro in her car. She pleads with Horohoro to get in the car and pretend nothing happened, but Horohoro refuses and is smacked around by Apollo. Bluebell screams that he stop but Horohoro says that her screaming is upsetting Apollo more. He explains that helping other creatures is a good thing but there has to be a limit on wild animals. Apollo is so dangerous because he was marked with human scent and that could hurt since he could not go back to the wild or stay with the human population. Hearing this Bluebell understands her actions in the past.

   Horohoro pours a drink for him but Apollo is shot, killing the once noble creature. Poachers come to take their prize but they run at the sight of bluebell. Horohoro tells them to take the bear for food but the poachers say they did it for sport. Bluebell runs toward them with her gun loaded but Horohoro is faster, angered by the hunters' disregard for nature and for killing the bear. The poachers fire and hit Horohoro but he gets back up. The bullets are useless since Horohoro iced over his body and the bullets drop harmlessly to the ground. Horohoro preaches that an animal being killed without being put to good use existed for nothing and that they will pay. Horohoro activates his new prayer stick and freezes the entire forest behind them. He then leaves, thanking Kororo for the job done and spares the poachers from death.
