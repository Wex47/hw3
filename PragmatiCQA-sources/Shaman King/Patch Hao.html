   Being Yoh's older twin brother and ancestor, Hao is very identical to Yoh in many ways physically, as they both have dark brown hair and brown eyes. Differing from his younger twin, Hao's hair is much longer in length, reaching past his waist. He often wears a pale yellow poncho cloak that covers only his upper body, while wearing nothing beneath.

He also wears a belt embedded with the Five Point Star and the straps are lined with it as well. A five-pointed star pattern is also found in the medium-sized gauge stud earrings he wears.

   Hao is a complex and multilayered individual molded by a series of harsh circumstances during his life. In the Heian period he lived under the uncertainty of corrupted and uncaring nobility which drove the country into chaos and poverty. He saw the world as a grim and dark place until he met a small demon named

   Hao grew misanthropic over time, as his Reishi abilities became too strong and eventually went beyond his control. The negative emotions and thoughts of others were constantly overwhelming him and, since he was unable to turn his Reishi off, the deluge of negativity eventually created an "Oni" inside his own heart. The internal confusion and disorder that was created eventually led to his desire of creating the Shaman Kingdom on Earth and drove him to become the Shaman King in order to reach this main goal. Nonetheless it was the unjust death of his mother that caused that caused the initial spark on his hatred for humanity.

   In his third and most current incarnation, Hao is usually calm, cruel, and always smiles. The occasions when he is really angry is very rare and when he is angry with someone, that person is usually killed off and burned to death down to their soul by The Spirit Of Fire. He also likes to watch the Shaman Fights, particularly those that involve strong Shamans, and

  <p key="02923240-cb29-4c65-a00e-8f3ebc7f73df">
   Hao regards money as a primary reason behind the corruption in society. He refuses to use it and has his group follow the philosophy of being completely self-sufficient - even if it means stealing something to obtain it.
   When treating Yoh for coffee, Hao menacingly glared at the Patch in charge when asking about the bill, until the Patch relented out of fear of being killed.

   Hao is shown to be rather duplicitous as well. While generally polite and respectful towards his followers who all venerate him due to in large part because he saved many of their lives, Hao in fact cares very little for them and views them purely as a tool to achieve his goals. He has no qualms about even devouring their souls if it means getting more power as he once tried to with

   . Hao in fact, scorns the vast majority of his followers, knowing from his Reishi that they secretly fear him, an experience he has long endured even during his origins as the people around him were both afraid and hateful to him, which fuels his disgust. True enough, their faith on Hao collapsed once they learned that he could read their minds the entire time and never told them. The sole exception to this are Luchist and Opacho whom Hao views favorably. The former because of his tremendous mental fortitude as he stays by Hao's side despite knowing of his mind reading abilities. The latter because she is pure of heart and follows him out of genuine loyalty.

   This somewhat extends to the first anime series in which Hao is portrayed differently. In this continuity the majority of Hao's background (like his Reishi) is not explained, with his misanthropy being attributed to people fearing him like a monster, due to his Shamanic strength. Hao believes this to be caused by humanity's fragile willed nature, and thus scorns on humanity due to their mental and spiritual weakness, thinking it the source of conflict and discord and thus wishes to purge humanity and create his Shaman Kingdom to achieve his vision of peace. It is as a result of this that Hao is obsessed over Shamans he consider to be strong, even engaging in purging acts as he had the Spirit of Fire melt ice from atop a mountain to cause a flood to cull the strong from the weak. Nearing the end of this series, Hao bestowed a power up to his followers, and revealed to Manta that he cared very little over those that died as a result of the overload, as it would prove they were weak and thus useless to his vision. He even scorned on Opacho herself when his usually calm demeanor fell apart, exposing his hatred causing her to be afraid of him.

   In both the original manga and 2021 anime, Hao is portrayed in a far more sympathetic light, as it is revealed that despite his cruelty and his destructive acts, that he is in fact a deeply vulnerable person unable to move onwards due to his obsessions. Using an analogy, Anna described Hao as a "Princess who was caught by the Demon Lord of hatred" with the only means to defeat him being to save him from himself. Hao in fact, mourns his mother to this day and laments her loss and the lack of her company, something he keeps entirely to himself. When seen crying by X-Laws who attempted an attack on him, Hao erupted in a murderous fit of rage as it was a side of his that he did not want exposed. It was, ultimately thanks to his mother's spirit intervention that he ultimately desisted from his darker impulses.

However, the Spirit of Fire uses mostly physical attacks, and on occasion, its fire attributes have been used in combat. Since Hao is quite fond of the element fire, he is rarely seen using his taijutsu arts in both the manga series and the anime series. Nevertheless, the combination that his Onmyōdō abilities and the Spirit of Fire forms definitely gives him an Over Soul second in power only to one with the Great Spirit.

Hao then offers Ren a first chance to join his own group but he declines and promptly attacks Hao. but Hao blocks his attack so easily and quickly, reducing it into ash.

Before the match begins, Hao told both Opacho and Luchist to leave the area so he can face them all at once by himself. Knowing that they will lose, the X-laws decide to fight Hao one-on-one so that the other shamans can learn more about him. In a single attack, Hao quickly summons the Spirit of Fire and kills off two of the X-laws members. The third member is being crushed by the Spirit of Fire. Hao then later reveals that his shamanic medium is the air itself; he admits this to be the case as what else would be a better medium of fire. Marco is furious as this shows that Hao does not care if anyone knows his secret and he is shown mocking the sacrifices of the X-laws whom he killed off. However, Chris Venstar surprises Hao with a special grenade that can extinguish all oxygen in the area.
