The waistcoat has a high cut revealing his midriff and has a hole in the back showing a tattoo of the X-Laws sign, on his back.
   The holster of his colt is worn in the patterned shoulder strap. As Luchist puts it, the battle uniform is used to create a stronger spirit, and more perfect conditions for the

He also seems able to fence with a handgun, as seen when fighting with Marco with his colt and quickly gaining the upper hand. Hao taught him the Fumon Tonkō and combining it with his natural speed, Luchist can easily avoid his opponent's attacks and use it to attack from behind. Luchist can create the strongest condition possible for an Over Soul by using his battle outfit rather than his regular clothes.

It was Luchist who would be the one who raised him, as he, at that time was a reverend in a Catholic church-orphanage where Marco was brought in. Towards the present time, Marco is still grateful for his upbringing. It was because of Luchist, who allowed him to take ballet lessons and took him to car shows. He allowed him to go to the university and helped him create his own company. Marco was also grateful to Luchist for creating the X-Laws.
