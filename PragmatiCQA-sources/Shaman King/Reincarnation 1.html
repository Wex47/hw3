Yoh then calls out Amidamaru, the samurai appears behind him, Manta is surprised to see the ghost of the legendary samurai. Amidamaru thanks Yoh for helping him avenge for his earlier humiliation. Manta sees a chance if it's Amidamaru the legendary samurai that he can take the gang on, but since he is a ghost he can't do anything. Ryu sends out Apache and Space Shot to assault Yoh, Manta is scared and Yoh laughs at the two guys who are approaching him.
