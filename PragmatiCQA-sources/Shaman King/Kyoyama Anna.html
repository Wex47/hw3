   Anna has medium length blonde hair. Her eyes are black in the 2001 anime series while amber in the manga series and the 2021 Anime. She is almost always seen wearing a red bandana; the bandana is usually worn on her head, but she starts wearing the bandana around her neck like a scarf and sports a pair of black sunglasses after departing for the Patch Village in America. Anna wears a jet black minidress and around her neck area, she wears a blue rosary necklace used for her Itako rituals. She wears wooden sandals with red straps and around her right wrist she wears a blue bead bracelet.
  </p>
  <p key="1f28cf8e-96e8-49c6-afad-ae9b2ad00f5d">
   At approximately 17/18 years of age, Anna wore a long, black hooded coat with indie print in the sleeves and the bottom, a rosary was rolled that she wore as a bracelet in her right wrist, her hair was also longer, mid back.

  <p key="ebb54c61-cadf-47a3-b5ab-8a452c24c687">
   At the age of 21, Anna has let her hair grow long, almost knee length, and keeps it in place with a white band instead of her red bandana. Instead of her black dress, she now wears a long dress with white, red and purple rippled heart shapes.

Anna can be extremely possessive of Yoh, beating him up once when she thought that the Oracle Bell he brought home was another woman's pager. On several occasions, Anna shows little or no concern for Yoh when Yoh is participating in a battle, the reason behind this was later revealed to be because she truly loved Yoh and trusted him to succeed.

   Anna is unusually strong physically, something that most people do not suspect from her slim appearance. She has demonstrated several times that she is not afraid to use violence to subdue anyone, even those she cares about, making her "right hand slap" and "phantom left hand slap (幻の左)" (or "Legendary Left") somewhat infamous among Anna's group of friends, especially Manta and

   Anna's spiritual strength is so immense that she was able to seal and control Asakura Hao's two Shikigami Zenki and Goki, just by reading how to within a few seconds. She was also the only person able to significantly damage Hao in battle by reflecting his curses back at him.
