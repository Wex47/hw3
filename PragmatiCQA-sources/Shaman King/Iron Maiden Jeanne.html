   The Gate of Babylon is a portal to another dimension that can only be opened by Shamash. The ultimate purpose of the X-Laws is to open the Gate of Babylon to seal away Asakura Hao. Midway through the anime series, the Gate of Babylon was only mentioned to Yoh and his group, who were puzzled by its meaning. When Jeanne finally gathered enough Furyoku to open the gate, everyone present, including the X-Laws, Yoh's friends and Hao's followers were pulled into the gate. However, Hao breaks out of the powerful prison, as the Spirit of Fire grabs Shamash in with them and devoured Shamash, gaining his powers. The prison then proceeded to crumble, releasing all of its occupants and rendering her powerless.
