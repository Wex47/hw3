   Peyote is usually seen wearing a green and orange colored Mexican serape. He is commonly hiding his face with a sombrero, jet goggles, a yellow scarf and a long black veil over his mouth decorated with three bones and a skull head. He wears a pair of black boots and black rubber gloves, each with knee and knuckle plates that have "Hao" written on them. When not used he constantly carries his guitarrón guitar on his back on a brown strap.

   He sports long green hair on half of his head while the other half is clean bald.
   Later on in the manga series, he also grows a thin beard around his chin.
   When Bill Burton was first inducted into the group, his hair was braided and he had a full-grown beard.

   Years after his resurrection, Peyote wears the same clothes as he did during the Shaman Fight (albeit now with bullet-holes following an encounter with the police). He has neglected all personal hygiene and self-care, becoming greatly emaciated and losing several of his teeth.  His hair and beard have grown extremely long, except on the right side of his scalp, which bears a long scar. He has also acquired a number of new tattoos, including a half-sleeve image of Hao standing above the heavens on his left arm,

   Peyote was born on September 11, 1970, a shaman originating from
   Oaxaca, Mexico
   . His father was a Spanish exorcist and his mother was an Aztec priestess.
   He was once a part of a Mariachi band which was considered the best in the whole country and famous for the bad brawls they started.
   Apparently two of them were owners of a saloon. They were best friends and all of them acted like true men. However, all the members except himself were killed in a dangerous fight or gunned down to death because of an unhappy saloon customer.

   , while sitting in a bar and was apparently surprised by the child.
   At first he decided to follow him out of curiosity of his remarkable shamanic powers, but unknown to him he was drawn to the darkness of Hao's heart and a desire to fix himself, even if it meant dying.

  <p key="d665563b-382c-4ce9-8052-a633770b3861">
   About five years before the Shaman Fight, when Bill Burton is inducted into Hao's group. As Bill begins to complain about their lifestyle, Peyote proclaims that it was comfy and a lot of space once Bill gets used to it, saying they are not chained to society by not using money and being entirely self-sufficient, and notes that even the vase cactus he was holding was at ease.

   Not much is known about his First Round experience but he did qualify to enter the Shaman Fight by landing a successful hit on a Patch Officiant and won at least two matches to get to the Second Round. He was first seen with Hao's other followers when they interrupted their master from playing around with Yoh and friends so that they would not miss the Patch Jumbo that would take them to America.
   He would then sit among his allies on the plane, and later ride on the Spirit of Fire with Hao and the others when the inhabitants of the plane were drop out of it.

   in the first fight in the Second Round of the Shaman Fight. At first, Peyote stood back and allowed the BoZ brothers to do the fighting, however, they were swiftly defeated by Chocolove. Peyote cruelly kicked their unconscious bodies, to wake them up and attack Chocolove once again, this time using only their instruments as blunt weapons. It is then revealed by Ren that the BoZ brothers had been unconscious for some time and their bodies were now controlled like puppets by Peyote, something Peyote himself confirmed and introduced himself and his guardian ghosts Carlos and Juan.
   An angry Chocolove tried to attack Peyote, but a small Calavera doll appears from underneath Peyote's sombrero hat and punches Chocolove right in the face. Peyote explains that the doll is possessed by Antonio, who was the late leader of the Mariachi Band, and more dolls fall from Peyote's cloak and are possessed by the other mariachi players. Peyote then uses the BoZ brothers bodies and create cactus weapons on their arms to attack Chocolove. Not wanting to hurt or kill them, Chocolove struggled against his opponents, but eventually used his Ayers Rock technique to make their ghosts laugh, interrupting Peyote's O.S. With Chocolove losing too much Furyoku while passing out, Ren swiftly finishes a defenseless Peyote, wins the match and eliminates Peyote and his teammates from the competition.

Believing otherwise, Momamed mentions that despite him also failing to perform a task ordered by him, Hao greeted him warmly when he returned to report his failure. Questioning if Momamed was worried, he refutes this, simply saying Hao must not have any care into the world.

   Later after Lyserg brought an injured Horohoro to the hospital to rest with Yoh and the others, Peyotes O.S., the Grande Fantasma suddenly appeared and attacked the building, with the intent to kill them all. However, Ryu was able to stop Peyote from killing anyone, by restraining the giant's arm with the appendages from his Yamata no Orochi. As Mohamed used his Beam attack and destroyed the building, he and Peyote eventually cornered Ryu who stayed behind to allow his friends to escape. Mocking Ryu by claiming his friends abandoned him, Mohamed says it wouldn't have mattered either way as Peyote reveals Zang-Ching had hidden in the building to attack them without them knowing.

Mohamed reveals that he too has had the same thoughts. The two men face each other on the beach and Mohamed warns Peyote about his next words. Peyote defends himself and says that he only wanted to give them some thoughts on the subject and did not intend to start a huge argument. When Hang Zang-Ching ask them to stop because they were scaring him he is suddenly killed by Peyote's O.S. "Grande Fantasma".
