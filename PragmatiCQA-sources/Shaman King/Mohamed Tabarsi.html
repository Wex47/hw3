   although Brocken has claimed that he is the overall leader when Hao is absent.
   He seems to be fairly friendly with his allies, such as reassuring a hospitalized Peyote that Hao did not seem to be upset over their failures, as he seemingly greeted Mohamed's failure at killing Yoh previously with a smile.
   However he strongly believes Hao's men should not have any weaklings, and cruelly disregards Damayaji's death, saying it cannot interfere with their mission and no one would miss him anyway.
   He agreed with Peyote's claim that their living situation with Hao is not half bad; that it is like Heaven compared to the disputes in the Middle East; saying it allows him to dedicate himself to training.
