   Kalim is a very tall and heavy muscular man. His face appears very rough looking which, according to Silva, scares the customers away and is the reason why they cannot sell anything. He has waist long black curly hair and wears a red native American headband beneath the hair with two feathers, on each side, in it.

Although he is sitting on the streets with normal people around him, he still wears the bull skull on his crotch area. Like all the other Patch Priests, all of his clothes are handmade.

   He then proceeds to punch him in the gut believing he only got knocked out and calmly asks who is to fight him next, although, as he puts it himself, he normally wouldn't do, it is regulation. Horohoro who is still hanging in his fist, announces that he is because there fight had not ended yet. Kalim proceeds to throw him away to which Horohoro smirks, saying that now he could counterattack. However, before he could anything is he knocked out by Yoh. When Kalim asks if Yoh is his next opponent, Yoh denies this and then he fuses with Faust's spirit with his own to give Horohoro medical treatment.
