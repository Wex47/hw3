   Faust VIII has a number of physical traits that make him stand out from the rest of the characters in the Shaman King series. He had blue colored lips and dark bags underneath his eyes caused by lack of sleep. Another trait of his is the bone-like tattoo around his neck. He is also noticed being extremely thin due to malnutrition as ever since Eliza's death, he barely ate any food. He told Yoh during their first fight that he eats only the minimum necessary to stay healthy. Along with his height, these characteristics lend him an intimidating presence. Another noticeable trait is the skin-like grey piece sutured onto his chest and torso. This does not appear to inconvenience him in any way but only makes him look scary. According to

He usually wears his skeleton shaman medium in chains that would be attached to his arm and would be hidden underneath his overcoat. Eliza's original head skull is either chain to his lap or hidden under his hat. During the second round, there is a flag attached to his wheelchair which is another advertisement for the Onsen.

   Faust is usually a very detailed and patient person who thinks scientifically unless the matter concerned is his beloved wife Eliza. He does not tolerate interruptions while working. A good example is Eliza keeping the X-Laws at bay while he attempted to help Jeanne. Moreover, tolerates even less criticism, bad insults or bad threats directed at Eliza. Despite this, he does not get upset when someone insults him.
  </p>
  <p key="163f8ee2-a34e-4a38-9461-f97ad3443c58">
   Faust is the embodiment of dedication, he has given up everything for his late wife and is willing to do anything to protect and take care of her. It is this single-mindedness and selflessness that gives him his own great strength in the Shaman Fight. Beyond all the mental instability and emotional suffering, his greatest strength comes from his pure heart because he knows that he only lives to love and protect his late beloved wife Eliza.
  </p>
  <p key="1fce15ce-737d-4acb-b8f8-be0d2dcd4d09">
   Faust was also quite insane but incredibly brilliant medical doctor who delights in saving the lives of others. Naturally, his work reveals facets of his own personality. During the time in between matches, he is usually seen reading some medical books and feeds himself breakfast, lunch, and even dinner through an intravenous therapy IV lines.

  <p key="84951370-5b00-40d2-ab57-9d0a0cc85d9d">
   Necromancy, the art of reviving the bodies of the deceased, is Faust's most important shamanistic technique. He was able to animate large numbers of human and animal skeleton remains, but cannot by any means, arcane or scientific, bring back the dead. It was noted, though, that during the finals of the Shaman Fights, Faust does indeed master the art of resurrection, allowing him to actually revive the dead, as long as their bodies are not badly damaged or beyond repair.
  </p>
  <p key="a5858de3-9e38-4d45-a284-4885e6ea7fa2">
   To animate the remains, typically skeletons, he uses the skill Bone Dead Reborn, which calls nearby spirits to inhabit buried skeletons, which he can then fully command.
   By only supplying them with enough Furyoku to move, Faust can conserve energy while also extending his control to hundreds of skeletons and forcing his opponent to waste energy destroying them.
  </p>
  <p key="8fbb04ce-286d-4d52-8fe4-a590b44ecd14">
   His skeletons have a powerful vice grip, and each has the raw strength of an adult male. Even his opponent in the preliminaries, Asakura Yoh, could not break free of the grip
   until a surge of pure desperation gave him barely enough strength to escape.
   He is also able to use the bones lying in graves to create cages to encase opponents.
  </p>
  <p key="8e83914c-e549-4464-a586-df2f861f118c">
   Faust's mastery of the medical arts allows himself to patch up his own wounds in the middle of a fight. He can do (often very painful) things no normal doctor could do to themselves due to the fact he is a heavy user of morphine. Before every shaman fight, he pumps enough morphine into his body system to make him feel completely numb for a few hours, which allows him to repair any damage to his body without the feeling of pain. One instance of this was when Yoh broke Faust's leg during their fight, and instead of letting the bone heal on its own, Faust cut open his leg, ripped out the broken tibia, and had Eliza bring him another similar in size and blood type. Afterward, Faust replaced his missing leg bone and was able to stand within a few minutes.
   A second instance was when the shamans were dropped out of a plane to be tested on how they would survive the great fall. Faust passed by Horohoro, chuckling about how he had injected so much morphine that he would not die from the hard impact. He would just let himself fall, but stitch himself back up, and be on his merry way down.

As the only woman to care for himself, he, in return, slaved over his studies to find a cure for her, which he did find. After her recovery, they soon were married to each other and opened a clinic together. She and Faust had a happy life together, however, this was cut short, by a burglary. A robber broke into their clinic during the night and shot Eliza in point-blank in the head. As Faust grows stronger, she becomes more life-like. Although he was unable to revive her yet, Anna was able to summon her spirit back allowing Faust to communicate and see her more often. Because of this Faust's power became even stronger because of the fact that he now uses a real human soul for his Over Soul.

   and seriously injured the officiant who tried to intervene. This match's field, moreover, is obviously in any Necromancer's favor, for it is a graveyard. This is a great advantage to a shaman-like Faust himself. However, Anna adamantly turns down Silva's request, insisting Yoh will fight for sure.

  <p key="b2578ffc-00e9-434f-8266-5d2ff50beb96">
   When Anna and Silva arrive to watch the match, they are shocked to find out the fight has already started. Faust has summoned an army of skeletons to attack Yoh. Faust partially dissects Manta, leaving him in intense pain. Faust's actions trigger Yoh's rage. The younger shaman tries to break free of Faust's skeleton army, and succeeds, although doing so, along with destroying skeleton after skeleton, has depleted his Furyoku greatly.
  </p>
  <p key="d36ce0b6-8ade-495d-ab4a-19d3e1ab350a">
   Throughout the fight, as the horrific truth is revealed, Faust used less than one percent of his Furyoku on reanimating each skeleton. The reason given by Silva is that Faust uses very little energy to animate the skeletons. While Faust is still in mint condition for the match, Yoh has become extremely battle-weary, his energy used up, and his Furyoku burning down to just a small flame of energy above the hilt of his sword. To finish Yoh off, Faust's true spirit ally finally emerges as he transfers his attention to creating Eliza's form on her skeleton. Eliza, while far from being the strongest foe Yoh has ever faced, becomes formidable now that his energy is almost gone.

  <p key="3e3e7378-0b40-45bb-ac71-1008fdd57c4a">
   Yoh enrages Faust by calling Eliza a "doll" because she has no will of her own. This enrages Faust to a horrific level so that he appears an insane man. He starts to recklessly expend energy, leaving him weakened. Yoh focuses his remaining Furyoku at the tip of his sword, Harusame, and cuts the legs off of Eliza's skeleton. While this attack leaves Eliza complete useless in combat, it depletes the rest of Yoh's Furyoku. Amidamaru falls out of Harusame, and Yoh loses the match. Yoh breaks down crying at nearly losing his best friend, his life, and his dream. Amidamaru tells Yoh that his philosophy of letting things work themselves out and not worrying about the outcome of events is as much a form of courage as any other.

   Faust, out of pure blind rage creates a boneyard giant, a 20-ton "calcium giant" made completely out of skeletons, with the full intent of killing Yoh for damaging Eliza.

   While fighting the Team "Icemen" in the third fight, he is the first to be attacked because they see him as the weakest. Crushing his wheelchair he reveals his ability to stand up with the skeleton bones of his late pet dog Frankensteiny. He also reveals his new devotion to Yoh and Anna, and also reveals that he can use the skeleton bones of his late pet dog as replacement legs, that also have an incredible jumping power. He then reveals his new Oversouls and christens it "Mephisto E" ("E" from the initial of Eliza's name), a reference to the original Faust legend. However, he does apologize to Eliza every time he must put her in harm's way, even though she is still a spirit. Eliza then shrugs off the attack of the Icemen. Later on, he explains that the reason why he, nor Ryu has not attacked. its because Yoh has declared that he will defeat the Icemen with one blow.

   In the manga series, Yoh managed to cut through Eliza's knees. From the knee down, the bones were rendered useless. In an act that shows just how devoted he is, Faust actually replaces the missing portions of Eliza's legs with his very own legs, putting him in a wheelchair. After teaming up with Yoh and Ryu for Team "Funbari Onsen" and before fighting with them against the Icemen in the Shaman tournament battles, Faust Over Souled with his late pet dog Frankensteiny into a new set of legs.
