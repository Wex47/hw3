   Yosuke appears confident of his own abilities, assuring his companion that he is certain that he can create a wonderful new world for him. He is also rather arrogant and believes that money is power and so struggling to improve one's strength is pointless as one can just earn the power they need through wealth. In addition, he is rather blunt with his words and isn't one for subtlety.

   As a child, he was very disillusioned with the world believing the only talents or contributions to the world he had was his interest in the TCG, God-Hand Q. Even then, he contemplated suicide after realizing he wasn't too good at that, being eliminated in the first round of a God-Hand Q tournament.

   Yosuke's abilities are related to various different YVS cards he carries around. The cards are purchased from Yabisu, with costs ranging from ¥500 to several trillion. In addition, the cards are finite in use as Yosuke can only use each card once, though he can combine their various effects. However, he can purchase as many as he likes, so long as he can pay for them. The cost of the cards is little concern to Yosuke, who confidently asserts that he can use the cards themselves to win more money.

Lamenting that despite spending all of his allowance money to compete in it, he still lost in the first match of a Godhand Q tournament and felt that no matter what he'd never win, contemplating jumping off the large tower he was on, thinking he would be famous for it. However, before he could

   interrupted him and demanded him to give him money, saying that he was starving but money was like food to him and that Yosuke wouldn't need money if he was going to be dead anyway. Threatening him after being annoyed at his lack of reaction, he demands money once more at which Yosuke mentions he only has a measly 500 yen, Yahabe offers him his

   card, allowing him to jump forward or backward in time approximately 12 hours. Yosuke accepts, thinking he will reverse his loss at the tournament and puts his 500 yen coin in a slot on Yahabe, before boldly jumping off of the tower. Yosuke then wakes up at home, being alarmed at seeing Yahabe in his room. Yahabe questions what he thinks of its power, and explains how the cards and their mechanics work.

  <p key="e3c49ff5-e215-4b42-8eb9-9426124481a2">
   On his way to school, he encounters several of his friends who taunt him due to his low skill at the God-Hand Q game. As he was sent back in time with Yahabe's card, he recalls the exact words they had said to him as they taunt him. Later at the tournament, he uses another card he acquired from YVS, X-Ray 125 to help him defeat his opponent. In the middle of his next battle, YVS uses his card and notices that "they" are there and had already seen him. Panicking Yahabe flees with Yosuke, much to Yosuke's protests.
  </p>
  <p key="f1b890a7-d5c9-455a-9d14-750267310208">
   Eventually, Yosuke stops and reflects that Yahabe allowed him to relive that day, and despite his harsh words, he found something he could enjoy and vows to protect the world. Noticing his resolve, Yahabe asks him which card he wanted, to which Yosuke responded with one that would be able to drive

Yahabe tells him that it would be okay to take his time repaying him that, mentioning that he can't break their contract till his debt is repaid, bemusing that they were going to be great partners, as Yosuke sits on his bed with a blank look on his face.

   As Hana and Yohane are exploring a mall, Yosuke is seen with a telescope spying on them, commenting on how they seem to be having fun. YVS responds that he is not going there, as he hates crowds and mixing in with plebs to which Yosuke affirms that he has known him a long time and was already aware of this. Yosuke tells him not to forget that he was once one of those plebs before he had met YVS. YVS asks when he will set the trap, as he notes that once

   is incredibly dangerous, and in terms of Furyoku is the strongest of Team Hao. He reveals that he is out of their league, but now that he is separated from his parents, they might stand a chance. As they leave, he mentions to YVS how reckless they are and that they will probably die. Questioning why Yosuke just doesn't kill his enemies himself, he claims that they could make use of Hana's Dark Onis and that he'd end up being one of them.
