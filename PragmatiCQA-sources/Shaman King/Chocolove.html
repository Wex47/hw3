The dress and the accessories where all from a tribe in South America and was given to Chocolove by his master Orona.

   Chocolove likes to tell jokes to his companions a lot, the only drawback is that his jokes and puns are quite corny and make no sense most of the time. The others have the tendency to run after him or beat him up after telling a joke. This makes him typically another comedy relief in the 2001 anime, where he jokes at the wrong time which irritate others although Yoh occasionally lets out a light chuckle to them, while both Tamao and Pirika laugh hysterically. One time, Ren states that he is jealous of Chocolove's own courage to tell an obviously funny corny joke.

   His dream in life is to become the Shaman King and a great comedian because he was inspired by his late master. Both of them believe that laughter is the best medicine, so even if people do not believe that his jokes are that funny, he does not give up and he tries even harder to achieve his dream to give the world what it needs the most, is laughter.

   Chocolove is a supposed comedian but in reality is not really funny, although one of his jokes did save his friends. Most of his techniques involve making spirits and very rarely, humans laugh, leaving them a vulnerable target to attack. After going blind, some of his other senses seemed to have been increased as he is able to smell the position, of Yoh and the others. Chocolove also possesses the power of wind and he learns to use his Furyoku to erode anything in his vicinity.

The fact that Chocolove laughs at Orona's comment about using laughter to save the world and that Chocolove can see Mic forges a relationship between the two. The two lived together for some time until Chocolove's old gang appeared before the two and killed Orona, but not before Orona made a passionate speech that made Chocolove believe in saving the world with the winds of laughter.

   In the 2001 anime series, Chocolove first met Orona, on a snowy night when he was young after witnessing him subdue a robber with his comedy. as The robber laughed his head off as he was taken away by the police and the hostage rescued. This version of Chocolove portrays him more of a street orphan and removes his gangster backstory towards estimate of the show's toning down of the violence to appease the manga's shonen content.

   Unlike the manga and the 2021 anime series, where he joins Yoh's group upon arriving at the Patch Village, in the 2001 anime series, Chocolove is first introduced and joins the group before meeting

   Chocolove's jokes differ between the Japanese and American versions.
  </p>
  <p key="7d23db11-fe8d-4f17-9d06-44d1d425da60">
   Typically in the original Japanese version, Chocolove's jokes were puns on Japanese words with some visual effect to enhance it. (ex: The word "impossible" in Japanese is pronounced
   <i key="a0785f2c-0bee-443b-8713-5bdd8d895dbf">
    bakana
   </i>
   , which is played with the word and object "banana"). Since the jokes make less sense in the English translation, the English version have replaced the jokes with new ones, where he usually say words that are
   homonyms
   to things already said with a visual accompaniment. A good example is when Ren says, "No appeal," Chocolove says, "No a peel," and would hold up a partially peeled banana.

   The U.S. manga edits Chocolove's lips so that they match the other characters to avoid blackface stereotype. His lips remain unedited in the

   and
