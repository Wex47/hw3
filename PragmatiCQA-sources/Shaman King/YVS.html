After Yosuke jumps off of the tower and the card's power takes effect, Yahabe appears in Yosuke's room earlier that day, startling Yosuke. Becoming annoyed at having to repeat himself about his origins to Yosuke, he relaxes as he acknowledges he is grateful to Yosuke for ending his hunger, even if only for a measly 500 yen. He asks Yosuke about what he thinks about the power of his cards, before explaining the powers and details around his cards. He tells Yosuke to check his pockets as he returned his 500 yen, noting it was only fair as he had turned back time. He shows Yosuke his

   Later, as Yosuke had arrived to participate in the God-Hand Q Tournament, Yahabe laughs at how humans are so easily controlled by money, revealing it was a plot of the secret society to control everything, and noting that he did not want to be their tool so he fled for his on freedom. As Yosuke was battling his second opponent, Yahabe borrows back his card and panics as he notices that "they" had found him, before taking off with Yosuke in a hurry. As Yosuke stopped to confront them, Yahabe gives him his strongest card,
