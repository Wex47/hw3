   Yoh and Manta are at the cemetery enjoying the breeze of nature, while Manta still isn't used to get along with spirits. Yoh remarks that Manta should get used to it since its part of being a shaman, Manta asks Yoh why he came to Tokyo, Yoh answered back that a shaman needs a partner spirit and the rank of a shaman is determined by the spirit. Yoh explains that he came to Tokyo since at Tokyo there are a lot of great spirits. Manta acknowledges his coolness even though he is sometimes absent minded, Yoh then requests Amidamaru to be his spirit partner which shock Manta and Amidamaru, although appreciates but declines since he has no reason to be Yoh's partner. Yoh gets stressed and Manta grabs Yoh and drags him to the playground, Manta chides Yoh for being so reckless by becoming friends with the one who disobeyed his lord 600 years ago and who people calls him demon, although Yoh didn't sense any evil in him.

Manta is shocked by surprise and asked who he was. The ghost told his name to be Mosuke and his occupation to be a swords smith. Yoh asked some time of Mosuke to talk with him, Mosuke replied by saying that he waited for 600 years. Yoh asked if knew something about the sword, Mosuke explained that he was the one who killed Amidemaru, Manta and Yoh are surprised while Manta shouts that Mosuke killed

   A lord had taken them in seeing their skills, their time was at a war and that they needed a job of the lord so that they can take care for themselves. Mosuke is happy that they got accepted and will make the best sword for Amidamaru, later Amidamaru got the order from the lord to kill Mosuke, Amidamaru got distressed about this. The lord told his reason for the order to not let anyone get the same swords as the lord's, he wants Amidamaru to kill him since he is his best friend. Amidamaru confronted Mosuke and told him his order, Mosuke doesn't know what he should do. Amidamaru recommends that Mosuke flees, Mosuke replies what is going to happen to Amidamaru if Mosuke flees and suggests that they both should flee, Amidamaru explains his beliefs that he cannot kill his friend and that he can't betray the lord and stays.

Yoh is unimpressed by all this, which makes Mosuke cry in shock. Yoh exclaims that they are going to give it to him. Mosuke is surprised by what Yoh said, Mosuke turns around and sees Manta crying, because Amidamaru waited 600 years for him. Mosuke cries with over joy that Amidamaru still believed in him. Yoh suggests that they go see, Mosuke rejects it since Harusame is useless and is a ghost. Yoh tells him that he is a shaman and changes Mosuke into an Hitodama. Manta notice that Amidamaru changed into an hitodama as well. Mosuke asks what a shaman is, which Yoh explains that is someone that can bind the this world with the next. Yoh does an Hyoui-Gatai, Mosuke enters Yoh's body and asks Manta where the nearest blacksmith is.
