   Mikihisa had rented an apartment near the Heibu Ikeikebukuro station. His roommates of an unknown band were arguing and he went out. While singing, a girl throws a coin to his guitar case and asks him to sing her a song, introducing herself as Keiko and explaining that her boyfriend dumped her. Mikihisa finds Keiko his type and wonders why someone would dump a beautiful woman like her. Keiko explains she can see things normal people can't and states that Mikihisa had a ghost behind him. Mikihisa has the same gift, but as that brought him many troubles, he acts as if he doesn't know what she means. In the second part, Keiko brings Mikihisa to her temporary house, which surprises him at how big and luxurious it is and realizes Keiko is rich. She invites him inside for a coffee and eventually they end up marrying. Years later, his grandson wishes that he could meet Mikihisa.
