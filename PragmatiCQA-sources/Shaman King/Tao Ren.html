   Tao Ren was shorter than Yoh and most of his friends but he seems to look taller when the spike of his purple hair (a hair style called "Tongari") is added up. He has a relatively thin yet muscular build with visible abs. Ren's eye color is golden yellow in the anime series, however, in the manga colored pages series, they are usually gold, brown, or the same color as his hair color.
  </p>
  <p key="6e674269-c068-472d-ba50-3ff279f99911">
   His casual clothes were his school uniform; a pair of short black pants, a tucked-in, white dress shirt, a yellow school jacket, dark green tie and a pair of brown leather shoes. Like Yoh, Ren wears his school clothes as a casual outfit during the Second Rounds of the Shaman Fights.
   While traveling to America, Ren began wearing long pants and a yellow scarf and as his old jacket was worn out, his mother gave him a new similar one.
  </p>
  <p key="6ce2d292-653e-4eef-aeb8-5a58968df369">
   When he left for America, he also brought with him a new battle uniform, that is inspired by
   kung fu
   cloth. Both the pants and the vest are black and both have a triangular pattern with a yellow lining, and the pants are tied with a white silk belt. The vest also has an opening in the back outlining his Tao tattoo. Even though he brought it with him from before the start of the Shaman Fight, he never wore it during the fights in America because they were all so sudden, that he never had the chance to change.
  </p>
  <p key="17a9b820-eeab-44c1-a7a2-07b0f2cc24e4">
   In the seven years that passed, he reluctantly grew tall and his long hair was braided into a three-pronged Tongari. In his adult years, he commonly wears a black suit with a purple shirt and a yellow necktie.

   Ren is serious, logical, and quite aloof. He tries hard to maintain a tough and confident exterior, but deep down would risk his own life for his allies. Ren is a particularly impatient person with a short temper and isn't afraid to hurt the source of the anger. Because of how he was raised amongst dead corpses and spirits he began applying the survival of the fittest rule as a way of overcoming death.
   He also believed that his guardian ghost Bason, was only meant to be used as a tool and would to treat him as a friend would only result in the spirit taking highly advantage over him. Ren's anger and hatred came from his father

  <p key="2d508199-ab70-48de-9a2a-d70664ac6932">
   As the Shaman Fight progresses, Ren begins to trust others even more. Out of all his friends, his bonds with Chocolove and Horohoro seem to be the strongest even though Ren often fights with Horohoro. However, after Ren was fatally impaled by

He was later spotted by Manta and Yoh outside a restaurant surrounded by a gang that he had offended. The gangsters attack him but Ren demonstrates his immense strength by defeating them quickly with Wushu without the use of his guardian ghost. However, when one of the gangsters tried to run him over with a car, Ren unleashed Bason and performed Hyoui-Gattai, easily cutting the car in half and destroying it. Not as satisfied, Ren decides to kill the gangster but is stopped by Yoh, who told him "that was enough". Ren tells Yoh that humans deserve to die while cutting their hearts only seek pleasure and that when he becomes the Shaman King, he would purify the world. He adds that in order to do that, he needed many strong spirits and requests that Yoh give him Amidamaru. Yoh refuses too, stating that Amidamaru was his best friend, and Ren faces him in a battle. however, the fight is equal until Ren, excited at Amidamaru's strength, applies 100% acceptance, the ability to draw all of the strength of the spirit into the world, as Ren claims, and succeeds in landing a fatal strike on Yoh. Yoh, however, manages to get up after Ren stated that spirits were nothing but mere tools and that becoming friends with them would only make them take advantage of the shaman, telling Yoh that Amidamaru was his friend and further adding that he would rather send Amidamaru to heaven than give him to Ren, where he would be treated as a mere tool. This angers Ren and he charges at Yoh, determined to kill him, but Amidamaru shields Yoh with his body. Ren is surprised by this, however, he mocks Amidamaru's action and uses 100% acceptance again to strike Yoh. Yoh, however, also applies 100% acceptance, much to Ren's shock, and the two clash into battle, with Ren being beaten. After his defeat, Ren stays in an abandoned Chinese restaurant that he bought from its last owner, still angered at his first defeat and brooding over his loss in acquiring Amidamaru, which he believed was Bason's fault.

   Three months later, Ren and Yoh meet up again, ready to fight each other. Remembering his last humiliating defeat, Ren tells Yoh that he will soon become an obstacle but Yoh laughs at this and stated that he too, could not afford to lose. Ren gets off his horse and tells Yoh that shamans like himself are not even a fist's worth, but Yoh ignores this comment and points out that Ren had grown a little taller, further angering him. Believing that Yoh was treating him like a fool, Ren went straight in attacking Yoh with his new oversoul as soon as the battle started but Yoh shields the attacks. Ren commented on Yoh's new Over Soul and charge at Yoh with incredible speed. After surprising Yoh with his barrage of attacks, Ren goes behind Yoh and strikes him. Yoh, however, manages to block Ren's hit with his back turned to him, shocking Ren. Amidamaru reveals that Yoh could only do this because he had his eyes and Yoh hits Ren, sending him flying. Ren is uninjured and was revealed to have not even used 1/10 of his power. Ren rushes at Yoh and who just manages to defend himself but is sent towards the sky by the impact created by Ren. Ren then rode on his Over Soul and attacked Yoh in the air, which Yoh managed to block just in time. Ren scornfully asked Yoh if he had thought that his attack would end there and summons a gigantic fist from Bason, which slams Yoh towards the ground. Yoh uses his Over Soul to cushion the fall but Ren starts striking him over and over, breaking Yoh's Over Soul. Yoh deduces that he would have to make an oversoul that could overcome Ren's in order to defeat him but refuses to do so since he did not know how to. Amidamaru starts worrying but Yoh assures him.

   Angered that Yoh managed to counter his attack, Ren launches another Over Soul, but Yoh, at Amidamaru's words, slants to the right and goes right under him, succeeding in dodging the attack. This further irritates Ren and he attacks Yoh yet again, but Yoh dodges it again and appears behind Ren, asking him where he was looking before attacking and breaking Ren's Over Soul. Ren then asked Yoh how he managed to avoid all his attacks, but Yoh reveals that he had been hit and that including his earlier attack, it would have been four times for him and seven times for his Over Soul. Silva reveals that Yoh's Over Soul was able to defeat Ren because Ren was too distracted by his anger to notice that his attacks had been working. He adds that Ren, who had full confidence in his power, was unsettled by how Yoh remained calm even as he used up his power and attacked, and his confidence started crumbling, along with his Over Soul.

   Ren remembers his reason to become Shaman King and decides to end everything. He uses his full power and places the spirit of Bason's horse inside his personal horse, Hei-Tao, and places all of his spiritual power into Bason, completely materializing his entire upper body. He tells Yoh that the world he was aiming for and the weight he was carrying was something that he could not even comprehend. He prepares to strike Yoh and Yoh, knowing that he could not avoid it, does the same with Amidimaru, and the duo clashes, creating a huge cloud of dust that engulfs them. As the dust clears, Ren's Over Soul was revealed to have completely vanished and Ren realizes that he had indeed lost. Yoh, however, reveals that his Over Soul, too, had faded away long ago, prompting Ren to fall off his horse. The two start bickering and Silva step in to stop the argument, announcing that the fight had ended in a draw. Ren angrily demanded how they were to count the result of the fight and Goldva suddenly appears, declaring that both of them had advanced to the preliminaries.
