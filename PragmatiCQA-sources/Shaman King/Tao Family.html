   , a Chinese character often translated as "The way of nature". The concept of Tao is based upon the understanding that the only constant in the universe is changing and that one must understand and be in harmony with this change. To the Tao Family, the way of Tao also means that one has nature, a way of acting that is natural to them and that it should be followed at all times.

   However, Yúan only saw one side of the world. Being forced to carry the ancestors' souls, he did not gain the wisdom as intended, instead, he received their sadness. It is because of this that he lost all trust in humanity and shamans outside the family and he ended up teaching his children the same thing.

   As the doctrine of Tao reflects upon the family's nature, they have also used the symbol as their family symbol, even tattooing it onto their backs, while Ren had his tattoo made forcefully.

   2000 years in the past they used their skills to assist and guide the people of China and their power spread across the country. In order to govern the entire mainland of China the Tao Family had other shaman clans cooperate and follow them while exiling those who acted unlawfully.
   As time went on, they become ostracized for their abilities and hunted down, forcing them to retreat to the outskirts of China.

   After being forced to live on the frontiers of China for many years, the Tao Family experienced a revival of sorts when Yúan, a member of the branch family, married Tao Ran, heir to the main branch, and became head of the family. He decided it was his responsibility to engrave the Tao Family’s name into history once more. At the same time, Yúan also saw it as his duty to carry the souls of the ancestors with him and therefore took on an armor of memory tablets that would later be used as a medium for his oversoul, Daidouho.

   When his two children were born, he merely saw them as tools for the Tao Family to use to regain their lost honor. Because of this, he made his son Tao Ren undergo unusually harsh training to become Shaman King. He also taught Ren about the cruelty of humanity and that he shouldn't trust anyone outside the family. Tao Jun learned how to become a Dàoshì from her mother so that she could support Ren. Yúan believed that by making Ren Shaman King he would be able to restore the former glory of the Tao Family. However, besides giving Ren a strong body and shamanic abilities, the legacy that Yúan passed to Ren was one of hatred of everyone and everything, a conquer or die philosophy. Because of this, Ren never cared for his family and made it his goal to become Shaman King only so that he could kill every person in the world.

   The corpses can be improved in many ways, such as replacing limbs with animal parts or weapons, in order to create even stronger warriors.
   As long as the bodies are not destroyed too much, they can be repaired and improved over and over again.
   As later shown with Pyron they can also add mechanical parts to the body to increase power, in his case adding a piston to increase the power of his basic punch.
   They also create Jiang Shi to use as servants, horses, and other sorts of things useful in the house.

Kyo was a general for the Northern Qi Dynasty during the period of Southern and Northern Dynasties. Both were very handsome in life and Ran used special techniques to increase their handsomeness. Tao Yúan was supposedly very jealous when he first saw his wife's spirits but Ran just thought it was cute.

   In the 2001 anime series, after the defeat of Tao Yúan and their departure, the Tao family excluding Jun and Ren are not seen ever again, even though they in the manga series they follow Ren from the Patch Tribe in America to the Shaman Fight in Tokyo and cheers him on during his first fight. This also creates a large plot hole in why Asakura Mikihisa wanted to train with Ren and it is instead explained by the fact that Yoh's and Ren's teams have an argument about who is stronger. Also in the English version of the anime series, instead of believing in the doctrine of Tao Yúan instead teaches Ren to "

   In the 2001 anime series, Ren and Jun have a cousin named Ginny who was in the tournament with her younger siblings. Also, Yúan is referred to as their uncle to Jun and Ren instead of their father, whose death is the reason for Yúan's hatred towards humankind.
