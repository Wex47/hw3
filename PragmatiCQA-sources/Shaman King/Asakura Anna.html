   Anna has medium length blonde hair. Her eyes are black in the 2001 anime series while amber in the manga series and the 2021 Anime. She is almost always seen wearing a red bandana; the bandana is usually worn on her head, but she starts wearing the bandana around her neck like a scarf and sports a pair of black sunglasses after departing for the Patch Village in America. Anna wears a jet black minidress and around her neck area, she wears a blue rosary necklace used for her Itako rituals. She wears wooden sandals with red straps and around her right wrist she wears a blue bead bracelet.

   At approximately 17/18 years of age, Anna wore a long, black hooded coat with indie print in the sleeves and the bottom, a rosary was rolled that she wore as a bracelet in her right wrist, her hair was also longer, mid back.

Anna can be extremely possessive of Yoh, beating him up once when she thought that the Oracle Bell he brought home was another woman's pager. On several occasions, Anna shows little or no concern for Yoh when Yoh is participating in a battle, the reason behind this was later revealed to be because she truly loved Yoh and trusted him to succeed.
