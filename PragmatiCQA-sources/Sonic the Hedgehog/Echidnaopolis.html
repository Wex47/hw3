   While two of the city's top scientists,
   Jordann
   and
   Kayla-La
   , were observing and charting the stars, they discovered a massive comet, viz the
   White Comet
   , on a collision course with Echidnaopolis. To avoid destruction, the two scientists proposed a plan to lift their city into the air using the power of numerous Chaos Emeralds. In coherence with the plan the Echidnas launched a massive excavation of the planet in search of the Chaos Emeralds. Once enough had been obtained, the emeralds were placed within the deep caverns below the city, letting their energy resonate through the city's infrastructure, providing a lifting force to the surrounding area. Meanwhile, the
   Fire Ants
   dug the surrounding landmass free from the planet's surface separating Angel Island from Mobius. With every force contradicting the lifting force from the emeralds, save for gravity, removed, Echidnaopolis was lifted into the sky, just before the comet struck the planet. (

   Arakkis
   proposed the idea that those who wished would be given the opportunity to leave the city and return to Albion. While the High Council disagreed with Arakkis, they provided the defectors with supplies for their voyage and made sure that all inhabitants would be given the individual freedom of choice in the matter. The descendants of the defectors led by Arakkis would eventually become known as the

   Echidnaopolis hosted an election in the year of 3235 for the office of High Councilor, unexpectedly the High Councilor of that time stepped down to endorse a new candidate, the pro-Dark Legion candidate Benedict.

Benedict was ultimately destroyed after his campaigns headquarter was blown up by Knuckles being subjected to experiments. The election was rigged by Benedict and when he won, it enabled the Dark Legion to walk freely in the city. An important political topic for the election was the topic of Dingo housing construction, with some candidates believing that the Echidna construction teams worked to slow. (

A committee was instated by the High Council to lessen the gap between the legion and the other residents of Echidnaopolis.

   Angel Island, and thus Echidnaopolis, circled the planet travelling through many latitudes, therefore the city had a dynamical climate. Following from Angel Island's extreme diversity in biomes, Echidnaopolis is surrounded by both warm regions, such as the Sandopolis Desert, and cold, such as the Ice Cap Zone. During the most recent Day of Fury, the city experienced both extreme colds and heavy rainfalls. (

   Echidnaopolis was probably the largest city on Downunda when it still existed on the continent because of the other races still being far behind the Echidnas technologically prior the the ascension. The city consisted of nearly only Echidnas prior to it being transported back from its own pocket zone, because of the reason that immigration to the city was impossible at that time. (

   In the years prior to its destruction, the city saw a great increase in population, probably doubling its population. This was because of two major events that contributed to the cities population growth. The first being that the Dingoes from the Dingo City was incorporated into inhabitants of the city and the second being when the Dark Legion successfully joined the city. The Dingo immigration also resulted in the city becoming more inhomogeneous in the matter of race. When the city ceased to exist its inhabitants were scattered across the island, many being transported to Echidna Prison Camps while other found harbour in the Hidden Palace. The majority of the population of Echidnaopolis either died in prison camps or in the egg grapes, the remaining survivors were transported to Albion. (

   As of the year 3235 the largest group in Echidnaopolis was the Echidnas, followed by the Dingoes. Other Mobians, who immigrated after the city was transported back from its pocket zone, also lived in the city, but they were still minorities compared to the larger populations of the Echidnas and Dingoes. There lived no, or close to no, Overlanders or Humans in the city. The Echidnas were richer then other groups like the Dingoes, who were the working class of the city. (

    Hydroponic Gardens
   </span>
   of Echidnaopolis were large artificially constructed crop fields, utilizing the hydroponic farming technology to maximize the numbers of crops per area. The gardens consisted of crops being farmed under large glass ceilings. They were constructed because of the limited space in the Echidnaopolis pocket zone and it is unclear if they were maintained after the city was transported back to the island and more space became available around the city.

It was used to transport the various settlements on the island to their own pocket zones after the Dingo nuclear attack on Echidnaopolis and its effects lasted up until Echidnaopolis was transported back by the effects of the Ultimate Annihilator.

    Hawkings Personal Bunker

   was a bunker located under Echidnaopolis. It was used by guardian Hawking after the transport of Echidnaopolis to its own pocket zone. The bunker was connected to the EST Headquarter by a chute which led directly to a foyer which hosted several modern artworks. Connected to the foyer by a corridor was the inner sanctum which had a large screen and several smaller computers, the inner sanctum also had many log entries from Hawkings time as a guardian. The bunker also had a large statue of the two first guardians, Edmund and Steppenwolf depicted holding the island together. (

   Echidnaopolis hosts a slum where the poorer part, mostly dingoes, of the population resides. The houses are cheaply built and run downed by years of inproper care and the streets are filled with garbage. There where also large camps with tents in the slum where dingoes lived when echidna construction teams constructed houses for them. (

   The nuclear storages of Echidnaopolis was large storehouses which hosted the Echidnaopolis nuclear warheads. There were several nuclear storages across the island and they seemed to be surprisingly lowly guarded as the Dingoes managed to steal from these depots several times. It is unclear if these storehouses still exists or if the city even hosts a nuclear stockpile today. (

   The nuclear defense of Echidnaopolis protected the city from nuclear attacks, it was mainly constructed to repel such attacks by the Dingoes. The defense used laser technology to destroy incoming rockets with nuclear capacity, the lasers was situated on towers which was foldable. The defense system was used by guardian Hawking to prevent a nuclear missile attack made by the Dingoes against the city of Echidnaopolis. The city of Echidnaopolis had banned technology before the use of the defense system, therefore the system was stored away in the Grand Conservatorium in large storehouses. Much like the storehouses which hosted the Echidnaopolis nuclear stockpiles, it is unclear if the nuclear defense system still exists, it is possible that it was decommissioned by the government after the Dingoes were incorporated into the city.

      A possible explanation is the fact that Angel Island seems to be geologically active, supported by the existence of the Lava Reef Zone, this may rise the temperature of the island.

     <li key="6e109f4f-1935-4b0d-be5e-c446d3dfc620">
      Another explanation may be that some of the energy emitted by the Master Emerald is converted into heat energy, heating up the island.

    The size of the city vary greatly in different depictions of the island. In issue 34 of the main comic, Echidnaopolis is depicted to take up nearly all of the island but in most other appearances it only covers a small part of the island. Due to the geography of the island, one can assume that Echidnaopolis only takes up a fraction of the islands size.
