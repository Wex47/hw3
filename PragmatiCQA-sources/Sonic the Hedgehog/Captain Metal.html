   Anarchy Beryl
   in his throne. This allowed Scourge to transform into a stronger form;

   Metal Sonic and Shadow then ended up in the
   Sol Zone
   , floating above an ocean. Shadow tried to convince Metal Sonic to no longer obey Dr. Eggman, but Metal Sonic completely ignored Shadow's request and kicked him into the water before flying off to look for the zone's version of Eggman. Furious that he could not locate that zone's Robotnik, Metal Sonic began attacking
   Southern Island
   . Shadow,
   Blaze the Cat
   and
   Marine the Raccoon
   showed up shortly to witness the destruction Metal Sonic had caused. Blaze furiously attacked Metal Sonic, but the machine simply used its powers to reverse Blaze's attack. Neither Shadow or Marine could take down Metal Sonic. However, Shadow tried once again to convince Metal Sonic to work with him, but Metal Sonic simply pointed out they each had different goals, and his was to serve Dr. Eggman. Thus, Blaze set fire to Metal Sonic, and Shadow charged at him. The robot flew towards the
   Ocean Tornado
   , and Marine destroyed it with the ship's cannon. (

   One of these relics from the old reality was Metal Sonic v3.3, who was apparently salvaged and rebuilt from a bunch of damaged robotic remains by
   Doc Ratcheturn

   , the latter three having been transported to the Sol Zone at the same time as Bark and Bean. Blaze subsequently boarded his vessel, and the captain threatened to destroy her vessel if she didn't turn herself over to him. The Cat confronted him, not recognizing him due to the darkness and his new appearance, and demanded his surrender. In response, he used a laser cannon to destroy the crippled Ocean Tornado, and then watched as an enraged Blaze was knocked out by a member of his crew. Noting that Blaze had let her emotions get away from her, Metal Sonic voiced his intentions to take full advantage of his "second chance at life." Taking Blaze as a prisoner back to his island, he placed her in a cage made of tungsten carbide, which he had created to be especially flame-resistant. Taking her to his throne room on the island, he explained his intentions to use the Sol Emerald to power his new weapon, and offered her the chance to join him and provide the others as well. Blaze refused, and informed him that only she could utilize the power of the Sol Emeralds, only to be informed that the Egg O' War-which Metal proceeded to unveil-contained an environment in which the usual rules of reality didn't apply, meaning that he could use the power of the Sol Emeralds.

   with the Egg O' War, Captain Metal didn't notice Amy, Cream, Cheese, and Marine, who had survived the destruction of the Ocean Tornado. The trio from Mobius moved to rescue Blaze, but an angry Marine confronted Metal directly for destroying her beloved vessel. He responded by attempting to blast her, only for Cream to swoop in and carry her to safety. Undeterred, the Captain ordered Buckle to open a large door built into the floor, revealing a tank filled with water inhabited by his fearsome pet, the
   Kraken
   . He intended to let the beast destroy them, but then received a shock as he noticed that his Sol Emerald had vanished. He quickly discovered the culprits: Bark and Bean, attempting to escape with the gem. Enraged, he ordered Swash to see to the demise of the heroes while the rest of his crew pursued the thieves. However, another irritant appeared in the person of

When the Kraken was subsequently destroyed, Captain Metal was able to reclaim the Sol Emerald, and unveiled new crab-based parts as he confronted both sets of his enemies. (

   After revealing his new parts he, Blaze, and Captain Whisker became locked in combat. In the ensuing battle, Whisker fled while Blaze chased and cornered Captain Metal in the Egg O' War's engine room and fought him face to face. Just when he would have destroyed her, Amy, Cream, and Marine jumped in to help. With Captain Metal distracted, Blaze had the perfect chance to regain the last Sol Emerald and transform into Burning Blaze. With her newly gained powers, Burning Blaze destroyed Captain Metal's body by melting it. However, she was too late to destroy his programming and he managed to upload himself into the Egg O' War's mainframe, thus becoming the floating fortress itself. He proceeded to continue attacking Burning Blaze, but was no match. She partially destroyed him, and he sank to the bottom of the ocean proclaiming that he'd have his revenge on her. (

   Upon being rebuilt, Captain Metal's personality changed drastically. Apparently gaining a measure of free will, he also adopted various pirate mannerisms, particularly in terms of speech. Having gained something of a sense of mortality, he relished his renewed existence and became determined not to squander it on the activities that compelled other Sol Zone pirates. While he apparently developed a larger vision of what he could accomplish, he also became incredibly sadistic, perfectly willing to take lives and make others watch. He also appears to have gained the ability to lie, as well as justify his villainous actions.

He is an adept swordsman, as demonstrated by his victories over Boltbeard and other rival pirates. Furthermore, he has also been shown to have alternate robotic parts to replace his legs and right arm, the only known set being a set of crab-like legs with a matching pincer.  In this form, he was apparently heat-resistant, blocking a sword of fire Blaze wielded against him.  He could also channel electric shocks through his pincer, with which he subdued Blaze.  He also overwhelmed Amy and Cream even after being temporarily overwhelmed by them himself, and was only stopped by the fires of Burning Blaze.

    Since the multiverse had collapsed in on itself and rebooted due to the Super Genesis Wave, it's assumed the same thing had happened to the Sol Zone. However, it's not made clear as to whether or not the zone had been altered in the same way as Mobius Prime. Several elements of the zone would seem to indicate that it's the same version of the zone that appeared in previous issues. This is made evident by the presence of Captain Metal, supposedly a rebuilt version of the Metal Sonic that Shadow destroyed in SU#1, and by how everyone seems to be aware of the events of "Treasure Team Tango" (particularly conspicuous in the case of Amy, as it was later revealed she had no memory of the old world before Nicole restored them). It could be possible that the aforementioned events also took place in the new timeline in some form, but this has yet to be confirmed.
