    Metal Sonic
   </b>
   is the name applied to a powerful
   badnik
   based on
   Sonic the Hedgehog
   that was created by
   Dr. Eggman
   to serve as the ultimate match for the speedy hedgehog. This badnik has usually been loyal to Dr. Eggman to an extent and has proven to be an effective adversary against Sonic on occasion. Numerous versions of Metal Sonic have been produced by Eggman, as successive units are destroyed in battle against Sonic and other enemies. Nevertheless, each successive model became more dangerous to confront, and its threat potential only increased after being joined by other similar Badniks as part of the
   Metal Series
   .

   the robotic duplicate was defeated seemingly once and for all. Though destroyed by Knuckles, Metal Sonic survived due to its Power Gem core. Driven by revenge, the new and improved Metal Sonic kidnapped
   Miles "Tails" Prower

It was thought to have finally met its demise, but its core programming was later found to be part of the still functional Power Gem and the robot was rebuilt into the heroic
   Shard the Metal Sonic

   Metal Sonic and Shadow then ended up in the
   Sol Zone
   , floating above an ocean. Shadow tried to convince Metal Sonic to no longer obey Dr. Eggman, but Metal Sonic completely ignored Shadow's request and kicked him into the water before flying off to look for the zone's version of Eggman. Furious that he could not locate that zone's Robotnik, Metal Sonic began attacking
   Southern Island
   . Shadow,
   Blaze the Cat
   and
   Marine the Raccoon
   showed up shortly to witness the destruction Metal Sonic had caused. Blaze furiously attacked Metal Sonic, but the machine simply used his powers to reverse Blaze's attack. Neither Shadow or Marine could take down Metal Sonic. However, Shadow tried once again to convince Metal Sonic to work with him, but Metal Sonic simply pointed out they each had different goals, and his was to serve Dr. Eggman. Thus, Blaze set fire to Metal Sonic, and Shadow charged at him. The robot flew towards the
   Ocean Tornado
   , and Marine destroyed him with the ship's cannon. (

   The next Metal Sonic model appeared during Sonic and Sally's attempt to thwart Dr. Eggman's
   Operation: Clean Sweep
   aboard the
   Death Egg Mark 2
   . Soon after Eggman revealed his new
   World Roboticizer
   and a simulation of its devastating effects on Mobius, Sonic moved to attack the doctor when a new Metal Sonic swooped down from behind and charged him. Ranting on the latest model, Sonic battled his robotic counterpart as it worked in tandem with a damaged
   Silver Sonic v3.0
   from an earlier fight. (

   As the fight went on, it seemed Metal Sonic and his giant silver brethren would be victorious. A light then flashed from the Roboticizer as it activated; however, the device exploded due to a malfunction and destroyed the room, heavily damaging the Death Egg. Already being a robot, Metal Sonic was incompatible with the
   Roboticization
   process just like other mechanics, and it blew up into a robotic mess with its head severed. (

   Dr. Eggman deployed the eighth incarnation of Metal Sonic to destroy Shard, who had defeated his predecessor. Equipped with Eggman's last
   Power Gem
   , memories of all the defeats of his predecessors, and greater free will, it was initially opposed to the idea of going after Shard as opposed to Sonic. However, having learned from his previous attempts, Eggman had installed a soft-reboot defiance kill-switch, which quickly halted any inclinations of disobedience. Pleased with the device's success, Eggman lamented that he had been unable to fit Shard,
   Gamma
   , or Omega with such devices as well, not to mention the impossibility of using one on Snively. Metal Sonic soon arrived in New Mobotropolis, arriving so quickly and disrupting
   Nicole
   's systems by some means that left her unable to prevent its entry. It proceeded to
   Tommy Turtle Memorial Hospital
   , where it located Antoine and was about to finish what v3.5 had started when Shard arrived to confront it. Fortunately, Shard was able to goad Metal Sonic into fighting elsewhere and leaving the helpless Antoine where it had found him. The pair flew to the
   Great Wastes
   , which Metal Sonic chose as their battle site because it was "proof of robotic superiority" given the success of
   Mecha Sonic
   against the Freedom Fighters there in the past. Shard pointed out the irony that despite the apparent "inferiority" of organic lifeforms, some robots strove to become more like them, and pointed out Metal Sonic's own increased personality. (

   Metal Sonic claimed that it had been improved upon to the point of perfection, and to which Shard demurred, citing his own efforts to help the people of the
   Republic of Acorn
   gain a more positive impression of robots. Metal Sonic expressed its utter lack of care for Shard's attempts or his own actions, and the pair quickly engaged each other in battle. The battle was intense, each unit deploying their individual methods of attack and defense, but Metal Sonic soon gained the upper hand. Using memories of its predecessors' battles with various Mobians, it jammed Shard's laser cannon arm with a rock, deflected his
   Spin Dash
   before responding with its own, and vaporized the rock when Shard launched it from his cannon. Held in Metal Sonic's grip, Shard attempted to reason with it, telling him that he could become more than just a weapon, reminding Metal Sonic of Shadow's efforts to convince v3.3 of the same thing. However, the kill switch activated again, and Metal Sonic prepared to terminate Shard before moving on to New Mobotropolis. Determined to stop it, Shard retaliated with his adaptive arm, using its cannon feature again before turning it into a drill in an attempt to finish Metal Sonic off. Metal Sonic severed the limb with its shield, but Shard was determined to destroy it even when warned of the danger to himself. He went after the Power Gem core, and Metal Sonic realized the vulnerability of the feature and caused it to explode, consuming itself and badly damaging Shard. (

   Dr. Eggman created the ninth incarnation from the remains of the eighth incarnation after its battle with Shard. Retaining the previous version's memories, he reported Shard's apparent destruction and the loss of his Power Gem core. He then prepared to go after New Mobotropolis, but was informed that Tails Doll would handle that; he was also informed that, despite his desire to do so, he would not be sent after Sonic. Eggman deployed Metal Sonic to the
   Interdimensional Gateway
   to meet his new partner, whom he claimed Metal Sonic would like due to his status as a "base villain" like the robot itself. Metal Sonic accepted the assignment, and was informed by Eggman that it was his "undying, heartless weapon of misery and despair." Deciding that this was acceptable, it prepared to leave as Eggman, Mecha Sally,
   Orbot and Cubot

   Metal Sonic was created in the image of Sonic the Hedgehog, and is thus mostly built of blue metal. He has a yellow circular depression in his chest with a black center, mirroring the peach-colored fur on Sonic's chest. His head has metal fins resembling Sonic's quills, and a pair of triangular "ears." Metal Sonic has a muzzle, shoulder plates, and upper arms, legs, and fingers made out of silvery metal. His palms are black, while the backs of his hands are square yellow plates. His forearms and lower legs are blue metal like his head and torso, and he has red feet with white stripes designed to resemble Sonic's shoes. He has optic sensors with black sclera and red irises.

  <p key="b977e4af-2446-4724-a647-5d0ebc955779">
   In terms of personality, Metal Sonic has displayed little to nothing in the vast majority of its incarnations. Single-minded and unquestioning loyalty to Eggman was its function, as per its creator's design; having experienced previous failures with free will programming, Eggman didn't want to chance his prized creation turning against him. Despite attempts by Shadow to reason with one model, all versions of Metal Sonic v3.0 have remained devoutly loyal to Eggman. However, it is notable that the same model was also persuaded to join Sonic, Shadow,
   Amy Rose
   ,
   Rob o' the Hedge
   , and
   Silver the Hedgehog
   against Scourge. This may be more due to Scourge being a slightly greater yet easier to defeat target, though once Scourge went super, Metal Sonic deemed it a futile mission and went back to his original objectives.
  </p>
  <p key="824352c1-59ae-44d6-834d-ef02d0a36c6a">
   Metal Sonic is often viewed as cold and merciless, even mindless, and the majority of models have been silent during battle. For some, speech was not even an option: the fifth, sixth, and seventh models were voiceless, and the third model merely served as a radio mouthpiece for Eggman. The eighth model was equipped with a voice and more developed personality programming, which expressed cold outrage at the losses of previous models and and a single-minded desire to destroy Sonic. It also briefly expressed rebellious tendencies at the idea of being ordered to attack another enemy, but Eggman's safeguards quickly rendered it docile.

  <p key="aded4653-1cb3-41fd-90e4-dddcf6be4e62">
   Being a robotic clone of Sonic, Metal Sonic has access to many of Sonic's powers and abilities thanks to his equipment, including the rocket pack in his back that allows him to run at speeds possibly surpassing those of even Sonic himself. Metal's speed and power vary between the different models, the third one proving too much for Sonic or Scourge. In addition to Sonic's abilities, Metal has numerous other capabilities. He can fly by utilizing the rocket pack on his back and possesses impressive strength and moderately strong armor.
  </p>
  <p key="672e8051-5455-4df9-9926-2ab0a71a9ba3">
   Over time, the newer line of Metals began to get extra features and upgrades. The third Metal Sonic created by Dr. Eggman had some sort of energy cannon that it fired from out of the front air intake of its engine housing where his stomach would be. The fourth Metal Sonic had the same cannon design, which it used on Shadow, and was also able to teleport due to the SXSU-401 engine. The sixth and eighth Metal Sonics were equipped with a self-destruct mechanism, and it is likely that the other models also possess this ability. The seventh version of Metal Sonic can do a combo attack with Mecha Sally using a laser installed in its back.
  </p>
  <p key="7d6e4c11-54a3-46d4-b3e9-096742ae5310">
   After the seventh model's battle with Shard, Eggman determined that his decision to leave out a free will algorithm in Metal Sonic, which was done to prevent rebellion, made it weaker then the original. To correct his mistake, he installed his last Power Gem into the eighth model of Metal Sonic, containing the free will algorithm and all the battle data of the previous models battles, so it could think during a battle and learn from its mistakes. He also installed a soft-reboot defiance kill-switch to prevent it from rebelling against him like his predecessor. Unfortunately, the Power Gem was destroyed in Metal Sonic's subsequent battle with Shard, but the ninth model, rebuilt from the parts of the eighth, retained its free will and memories even without the Power Gem.

  <p key="3b78bd4f-eb07-4f52-bbca-7c8d4371b3a9">
   The eighth and ninth models also exhibited increased combat capabilities, including a variety of energy shields. One of these was a spherical defense mode, known as the Burst Shield. Another was first exhibited after the second

   , and was a diamond shaped barrier known as the Black Shield. Metal Sonic also displayed the V. Maximum Overdrive attack, which created a field of energy around him that allowed him to drive Mega Man through several barriers before dissipating.

    Interestingly, another Metal Sonic was seen being built in the background when
    Espio the Chameleon
    was sneaking through Eggman's lab. It can be assumed that this is the Metal Sonic that was later used to attack Scourge at Freedom HQ. (

    Before the introduction of v3.7, Ian Flynn purposefully made Metal Sonic v3.0 a machine without personality, being of the opinion that it makes him "more creepy" and that it would be redundant to portray him as obsessed with beating Sonic as his game counterpart is, given that several characters-notably Shadow-already exist with that agenda in the comic.
