Tails, watching from afar, sadly promised to rescue Sonic as the twins walked off with their captives. In the end, the twins were defeated, and both Sonic and Eggman were set free. (

After Tails realized where Eggman and Metal Sonic could be hiding, Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails made their way to Eggman's new flying fortress. After handing over their Ancient Gear in exchange for Amy thinking that Eggman didn't have the seventh (since Eggman specifically asked for the "last" Ancient Gear from Sonic after stealing the five from Tails), the team realized that Metal Sonic had the last Ancient Gear inside of it. After the three defeated Metal Sonic and saved Amy, Eggman and Metal Sonic fled the fortress. After taking a look at the database on the fortress, Tails realized that there was a deep sea base directly under where they were and that the airship was only for supply shipments, Sonic decided that before pursuing the villains they should collect the seven Chaos Emeralds, which had a habit of showing up when they needed them.

   After some time, the battle unexpectedly transitioned into Mega Man's world, where Sonic and Mega Man started arguing over who did what. Fearing that talking to each other would eventually lead to them discovering the deception, the two doctors ordered Tails Man to attack them. Sonic almost immediately recognized the Roboticized Master as his own best friend as Tails Man assailed him and Mega Man with powerful wind-based attacks. After saving some innocent bystanders caught in the mayhem, Sonic and Mega Man stunned Tails Man, allowing Mega Man to successfully use his copy ability on him, surprisingly de-roboticizing Tails in the process. Sonic rushed over to embrace his buddy as Tails explained the details of his kidnapping, clearing things up for his blue companions. (

   Shortly thereafter, Tails and his companions were forced to battle the last two Roboticized Masters, Knuckles Man and Rose Woman. The fight became more urgent as the two activated their self-destruct sequences in a bid to destroy the heroes. Mega Man was astonished by their raw power and asked Tails whether or not they had been modified, but Tails was quick to explain that Knuckles and Amy had always been rather formidable. Fortunately, Mega Man was able to stun Rose Woman and restore her to normal, and her Piko Hammer weapon helped him gain the edge on Knuckles Man. Tails then joined Sonic and Rush in a tag team attack on Knuckles Man, resulting in his return to normal. Tails was then sent with Knuckles to meet Proto Man and the Chaotix at the Wily Egg, near a teleporter pad they had discovered, while the others went to round up their various other allies. The group of heroes was then forced to face a massive army of Robot Masters who had been time-cloned by the doctors to oppose them. Tails proved as reliable as ever, rescuing Amy from

An unexpected encounter with a damaged NICOLE restored Tails' memories of the original reality while leaving those of the new one intact. Realizing that Sonic was right and that things had changed drastically, Tails stood in shock as the Tails Doll was about to flatten him. Sonic managed to get him out of the way and advised him to finish the battle first before dealing with the new problem at hand. The two succeeded in defeating Tails Doll and rescued King Acorn from his cell after Naugus fled the city. After talking with NICOLE, the pair determined that their best course in understanding what had become of their world lay in finding the other Freedom Fighters. (

Tails gave Nicole a Red Star Ring to allow her to fight Phage as Overclocked Nicole. However, the Sky Patrol's engines were destroyed by the Battle Bird Armada, sending the fortress downwards and Tails was unable to remove the Red Star Ring as it had produced very hot flames. Fortunately, the Sky Patrol's systems were brought back online, allowing it to achieve flight once more. However, as Sally, Antoine, Bunnie, and Sonic arrived in the engine room, a heartbroken Tails informed them that Nicole's handheld had overheated despite the fox's efforts to remove the Red Star Ring. Tails opted to help Nicole get the rest of the engines back online, while Sally contacted her father. Hours later, Sally would devise a plan that involved delaying the Death Egg, ridding the Dark Gaia Energy of Eggman's control, along with rescuing Chip and securing control of the Gaia Temples. (

   , holding the honor of being the second oldest hero character in the series next to Sonic himself. He was created by game designer Yasushi Yamaguchi during an internal contest held at Sega to design a sidekick for Sonic. Yamaguchi originally conceived the character with the name "Miles Prower", however, the rest of the creative team were not keen on the idea, and they instead went with the suggested name of "Tails". Unsatisfied with this decision, Yamaguchi, who handled the visual designs for Sonic 2's levels, snuck "Miles" into several parts of the games graphics, such as above Tails HUD icon, and as part of the neon signs in the Casino Night Zone. As a compromise, the team settled on naming the character "Miles "Tails" Prower", with "Tails" being the character's nickname.
