   On a bright day on the beach, Sonic was having a fight with
   Dr. Eggman
   in his Giga-Mech where he confidently taunted the doctor as they fought. Shortly after, Tails came to Sonic's aid and the two combated Eggman as Knuckles and Amy arrived and joined the fight. Once Amy had laid out a plan of attack, Sonic and his team attacked the Giga-Mech at critical points and brought it down, forcing Eggman to retreat. (

   No sooner, Sticks arrived at the beach in panic, who told them Tails' house had been robbed. Sticks took Sonic and the gang to Tails' house, and they discovered that the whole house was gone: what Sticks meant was that Tails' house had been stolen, and she explains that a "
   cyborg rock golem
   " rose up from the ground and left with Tails' house on its head. Suspecting it was one of Eggman's creations, Sonic thought of a vague plan to get Tails' house back (while dealing with Knuckles' difficulty with understanding the situation) when Sticks seemingly caught the scent of the robot and they followed her. Though it turned out Sticks was only smelling the grass, the group still found the Rock-cyborg by following its footprints and Sonic got his friends to set up an ambush while he lead the robot to them. With the Rock-cyborg hating his guts, Sonic was able to draw it into the ambush where the others made it fall over, allowing Sonic to destroy it and make Tails' house fall on its original foundation. Sonic then celebrated their victory though he told Tails that he did not have this in mind when he wanted to "crash at [his] place". (

   Not long after, Eggman returned in the Big Boy and Sonic, Tails, Amy and Sticks engaged the doctor. Amidst the fight, Sonic was knocked away and trapped in a small cage by Knuckles who claimed he was now working with Eggman because he was through with Amy criticizing him. Sonic's whole team was soon captured and taken into the Big Boy's cargo hold. While Sonic went stir crazy, Knuckles revealed he pretended to work for Eggman to fool him before going after the doctor to free them. Sonic was soon after freed by Sticks and in a rush over freedom, he broke the team of the Big Boy as Knuckles made Eggman retreat. After they had dealt with the stray

   For a climatic battle with the Big Boy, Team Sonic agreed to battle Eggman, only for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy to forget about it. Later, Eggman, Orbot and Cubt tracked them down in the Big Boy, where Sonic admitted their slip up, and Team Sonic fought Eggman, but found themselves at a disadvantage against the upgraded Big Boy. Coming to their aid was Sticks, who claimed she had found an all-powerful weapon: the
   Rock of Justice
   . Exasperated, Sonic did not believe a rock could help them and continued the fight. However, Sticks saved them with the Rock of Justice by throwing it at the Big Boy, causing it to ricochet into the mech and destroy it. After scaring off Eggman and his lackeys, Sonic congratulated Sticks and the Rock of Justice, only to hear that the weapon's power had been used up, and Sonic fell a tear at their loss. (

   In the
   Village Center
   , Sonic kept an eye on Dr. Eggman as he failed to sell a bridge and later gain the villagers' trust. As Sonic mocked him, Eggman called in his minions which Sonic and his team quickly beat, though Eggman got away. Later at
   Meh Burger
   , Team Sonic met Eggman again who asked for aid to operate his rides at the
   Eggtoberfest
   which Sonic complied to, if only to keep an eye on Eggman. Not long after, the villagers were attacked by Eggman's army which Sonic and his team destroyed, earning them the villagers' hailing. (

   Sonic's personality in this universe is close to his Prime Counterpart's. This Sonic has more control of his temper and is shown to be more flexible as at times he's shown to get along with his Reality's version of Dr. Eggman.

   counterpart, though he has several notable physical and clothing differences. This Sonic's spines are considerably messier, having a few thinner strands independent of his larger six. One of the most drastic differences in his physical appearance is his arms, which are covered in blue fur like the rest of his body, as opposed to being skin coloured. He wears white gloves and a differently designed pair of red sneakers, which lack the white straps and instead have a large, rectangular gold buckle on the top. Both his gloves and sneakers are covered in white sports tape, wrapped around his palms and lower half of his arms and legs, as well as the heels of his sneakers. Finally, he wears a dark brown scarf around his neck.
