   Lara-Le

   displayed signs in intelligence and far more advanced than those his age should normally be capable of, and Lara-Le soon realized something was amiss. By the time Knuckles was only three years old, Locke had already begun training him in rigorous mathematics and sciences, much to the dismay of Lara-Le, who felt Knuckles was too young to begin Guardian training, and felt he should have more freedom. As time went on, Lara-Le could not put up with the hardships of being the wife of a Guardian, nor could she stand to watch the manner in which Locke trained him. Thus, Locke and Lara-Le divorced, with Locke gaining custody of his young son. (

Instructing Knuckles not to follow him, Locke disappeared behind a mysterious wall of fire, leaving Knuckles to fend for himself as the new Guardian of the Floating Island.

   When all of the active Brotherhood members assembled in Haven to discuss various matters, Locke was present at the discussion table. When the issue regarding his son was raised, Locke angrily criticized Spectre when the latter reminded Locke of his objections of Locke's genetic tampering with Knuckles' egg. Locke reminded Spectre he had not been as loud in his objections at the time, though Spectre retorted his earlier objections were based on intuition while his present concerns were based on knowledge. Locke was still skeptical, though Sojourner pointed out if Spectre was concerned it gave reason for further investigation. The following day, after Haven's power blacked out, Locke discovered the cause was due to a fried circuit. He later set to work on constructing a replacement circuit. During the repairs, he informed his father it was possible someone had sabotaged the circuit, as only someone with a thorough knowledge of Haven would know which circuit could disable all of Haven. Sabre was shocked at such a notion, though Locke stated he was simply not ruling out any possibilities. After Haven's power was restored, Locke was happy to the peaceful status quo had been maintained during the blackout. (

   Locke was a tall echidna with bright red fur, like some of his ancestors he also sported a small beard. For most of his life Locke could be seen in a white lab-coat that signified his scientific skills, during Sonic's year in space and

   Locke had a marriage to
   Lara-Le
   for some time and the two eventually producing their offspring Knuckles. However, despite his love for wife and son Locke's priority of family tradition and custom took precedence over even that of his family. Due to the manner in which he raised Knuckles, his wife divorced him. In 3236 he made an effort to reconcile with Lara-Le, but this failed as she was happily engaged to Wynmacher at the time. Locke apparently had a bad history with women in general. Archimedes once pointed this out, stating

    "You and women have always been a bad combination!"

   . Even
   Deo Volente
   chastised Locke for being single for so long, claiming Archimedes was trying to hook Knuckles up with Julie-Su so he wouldn't end up a "swinging single" like Locke. (

   Locke was twice distracted by Rouge's flirtatious advances. The first instance, she managed to persuade him that she was interested in him, though Archimedes teleported her away when he felt Locke was getting too distracted. The next day, Rouge returned with Evil Sonic, and managed to distracted Locke again with further advances. However, as soon as he sensed danger to the Master Emerald, he left Rouge via the

   Like all Guardians, Locke possessed numerous abilities derived from Chaos energy. As a result of his genetic manipulation, he had enhanced abilities, both physically and in Chaos. The field he excelled the most at however, was history, well accustomed to long forgotten traditions and with considerable knowledge of past events. He was also a skilled technician and scientist.

    The Tumblr blog "A Moment of Archie Sonic", which pokes fun at the comic's more questionable artwork, had a meme of sorts concerning Locke irradiating Knuckles: "Had a bad dream; better microwave the baby." This may be the source of where Ian Flynn referred to Knuckles' old backstory being the "Hot Pocket of Destiny".
