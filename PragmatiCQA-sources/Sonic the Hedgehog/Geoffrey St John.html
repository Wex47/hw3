   Geoffrey established the Rebel Underground towards the latter end of Robotnik's dictatorship, determined to strike a blow for his kingdom, for his lost father, and for his new master: Ixis Naugus. The idea for this organization came from notes stolen from
   Armand D'Coolette
   , and he recruited former members of the

   , he ran into none other than Sally Acorn, who had just set an explosive device in one of Robotnik's facilities. Naturally suspicious due to his years of training, Geoffrey held her at crossbow point up until the bomb went off, knocking them both off their feet with the explosion. Realizing that the same facility he himself had been targeting was now gone, Geoffrey thanked Sally and introduced himself. Given the anonymity of his group, Sally was skeptical, but that didn't keep her from being intrigued. The two then came under attack by

   Geoffrey immediately gone on the wrong foot with

   Arlo
   ,
   Penelope Platypus
   , and
   Dylan
   —and announced that he would be joining them on their current mission. The nature of that mission: to knock out three energy substations providing power to the Robotropolis defense grid, leaving the city open to ground attacks. Joining in the attack on the first station, Geoffrey helped the team as they dealt with Robotnik's
   Orb-Bots
   , security robots armed with lasers that held the group pinned down. Fortunately, they managed to turn the tables and escape, with Geoffrey even rescuing Hamlin from being crushed by a falling robot. Despite this act, Hamlin remained suspicious, and the two continued to be at each others throats as time went on. (

   Hamlin soon approached Geoffrey for combat training, though he seemed more eager for a chance to beat the Skunk to a pulp. Geoffrey soon demonstrated his superior skill, only to have Princess Sally show him up in a similar contest. He then accompanied the group in the attack on the final substation, infiltrating the installation by using hang gliders. Landing, they made their way into the interior of the island holding the station, and had almost completed their task when an
   Octo-Pod
   robot attacked, grabbing Sally. Evading the attacker, Geoffrey planted the last of the group's explosives, including setting one on the pod, and then ran alongside the others in escaping. He then reported in to Dr. Robotnik, having apparently placed Sally in a stasis pod and replaced her with an
   Auto Automaton

   His absence from the group's following mission elicited further suspicion from Hamlin, which appeared to be well-founded. When they broke into the command center of the base they were attacking, Geoffrey was there waiting for them with Robotnik. Sally then held the group at weapon point before they could attack, and Robotnik revealed that the energy substations had been a ruse, and that Sally had been replaced by a duplicate he had created in order to lead the Freedom Fighters to their doom. However, when he attempted to Roboticize the "real" Sally in her pod, the process was halted by a feedback loop caused by the

   trying to Roboticize a robot. The Sally Robotnik had thought to be his creation turned out to be the genuine article, and Geoffrey turned out to have duped both Robotnik and the Substitute Freedom Fighters. Unworried, Robotnik activated his
   Stealth Bot
   sentinels and ordered them to attack, but Geoffrey's Rebel Underground arrived just in time, burrowing through the floor and disabling the automatons. Greeting his associates
   Fleming
   and
   Smiley
   , Geoffrey accompanied them and Sally's team in escaping Robotnik's self-destructing base. Afterwards, Geoffrey and Sally told the Substitute Freedom Fighters the whole story behind their deception, and how Geoffrey had told Sally of Robotnik's planned deception. By activating the robot prematurely, he had let it pose as Sally so he could figure out the specifics of Robotnik's plan, and then placed it in stasis while reawakening the real Sally. His mission done, Geoffrey took his leave, determining that it would be best for his group to remain separate from the Freedom Fighters. To remember him by, he left Sally with a kiss, and in doing so planted the seeds of a romantic rivalry for her heart between himself and

   Geoffrey and Sally crossed paths once again some time later, when both the Knothole Freedom Fighters and the Rebel Underground went after the same target: the robot
   Dynamac 3000
   , an adaptable combat machine being shipped to the western part of the continent both groups inhabited. The two ran into each other in the compartment of one of Robotnik's trains where the robot was being stored, Geoffrey proving as coy as ever by suggesting that they were more than just friends. While his men worked to stop the engine, Geoffrey had come after the robot itself, only for it to activate due to a fail-safe installed by Robotnik to work with the engines cutting out. In the course of the ensuing battle, Geoffrey met Sonic for the first time, and immediately assumed that he was another of Sally's Freedom Fighter trainees, much to Sonic's anger. Just as with Hamlin, Geoffrey found himself butting heads with the hedgehog as they struggled to defeat Dynamac. Not even trying to work together, each tried his own method to bring down the robot, but neither Sonic's speed nor Geoffrey's gadgetry prevailed. The robot was soon destroyed, however, and Geoffrey took the train for the use of his Rebel Underground, leaving Sally with yet another kiss as he went off. (

   along with Sonic to rescue King Max and plant the Neutralizer device to prevent the Zone from collapsing. Geoffrey insisted on going in alone as a means to save Ixis Naugus, not King Max. After arguing with Sonic about going in alone, Sally made the decision that she, Sonic, and Geoffrey would all enter the zone together. The trio made their way into the Zone and found themselves confronted with visions of King Acorn's past in the zone, and before they could make any progress the Zone began to collapse, dragging them down into a destructive vortex. Putting aside their differences as the King, his mind disrupted by his years in the Zone, attacked, Geoffrey took Sally to safety while Sonic stayed behind to confront the monarch. The Neutralizer proved effective, and Geoffrey and his friends escaped the Zone with the King in tow. (

When he persisted in his accusations of Uncle Chuck, Sonic attacked him, only to be defeated by Geoffrey's tactical skill. However, any satisfaction from that victory was short-lived as Geoffrey took a punch from

   Armand D'Coolette
   , as a precaution against King Acorn's enemies, but that it had never been put into place before Robotnik's coup. The two then continued fighting briefly until Sally stepped in to break them up, and Geoffrey left the group in as bad a temper as those he had angered. (

   Barely any time passed before Geoffrey was back, this time serving a seemingly restored to normal King Max. While Geoffrey still saw Ixis Naugus as the true king, he decided that serving the Family of Acorn for the time being was the best way to create a strong and stable kingdom before Naugus' return. Geoffrey would eventually act as King Max's agent in arresting Sonic for his alleged part in murdering Sally. Taking him into custody, he brought Sonic before the King to stand trial, and soon saw his rival being sent to
   Devil's Island Gulag
   for life imprisonment. Geoffrey was charged with escorting him to the transport that would take him to the prison, and took grim satisfaction in beating on the manacled Hedgehog.

   En route to the prison, however, the plane was shot down by SWATbots and Sonic escaped. Geoffrey and his men soon came in hot pursuit, determined to bring Sonic to justice. Having placed a bug in Sonic's restraints, Geoffrey soon caught up to him in a tunnel network, where the two fought a grueling battle. Fully convinced of Sonic's guilt, Geoffrey attacked him while professing his love for Sally, while Sonic replied with his own declaration. In the end, Sonic proved too powerful for Geoffrey but was then forced to dive off a cliff to escape him. Surviving through his quick thinking, Sonic was able to evade Geoffrey's pursuit long enough to enlist the aid of
   Dulcy
   , his dragon ally who flew him out of Geoffrey's reach-temporarily, at least. (

Humbled, Geoffrey redirected his efforts at an attack on Robotnik, which Sonic and Knuckles joined without hesitation. Together, the trio proved too much for Robotnik's minions, and Geoffrey kept up the fight while Sonic and Robotnik had their final showdown. In the end, everything turned out all right: Sally was revealed to have merely been badly injured and had recovered, Robotnik was dead, and Geoffrey was officially instated as the head of a new Secret Service by King Acorn, whose Auto Automaton duplicate had been the one to rule against Sonic. Around this time was also when Geoffrey met Hershey Cat for the first time. (

   After the defeat of Robotnik, Geoffrey sabotaged a probe that was sent into the Zone of Silence. Geoffrey's sabotage eventually freed Ixis Naugus allowing him to begin his takeover over the kingdom. Geoffrey however was displeased with how strong his master was imposing his will on the kingdom. He then continued his charade of only serving King Max, so that he could assist in salvaging the situation. Ixis Naugus apparently saw nothing wrong with Geoffrey's decision, and allowed Geoffrey to continue his charade. (

Following the theft of the Sword of Acorns by Sonic, and King Max's paralysis due to his injury, Geoffrey, desperate to bring order to what he viewed as a badly run kingdom, approached the inexperienced head-of-state; Elias, and manipulated his gullible nature to allow him to become his behind-the-scenes adviser. Using Elias as nothing more than a puppet, Geoffrey had Sonic's knighthood taken away, and as a child, confined to Knothole. (

   as the true king. He promised Mogul that the completion of his mission would lead to an increase of his business and, most importantly, would cause Sonic misery. He was soon allowed to use the emerald, which was able to restore Naugus' mind to normal. Naugus quickly reprimanded Geoffrey, grabbing him by the throat and showing displeasure towards Geoffrey's apparent lack of action all this time. Geoffrey escaped by turning to smoke and reappearing on the floor, gasping for air. Geoffrey insisted that everything he had done (or not done) in Naugus' absence had been necessary, and promised that he would ensure Naugus' rightful place on the throne if he were to follow his instruction.

   Later, one evening, Geoffrey and Naugus appeared in the empty upper section of New Mobotropolis' Coliseum where the
   Forget Me Knots
   were about to give a concert, having emerged from the shadows using magic (a technique Geoffrey found extremely uncomfortable). Naugus showed some displeasure in Geoffrey, but while the skunk admitted his magical skills were lacking, Naugus would still need his help if he wanted to take over the kingdom. The day before Naugus planned to finally make his move, Geoffrey secretly observed Sonic and Sally spending time together by the Lake of Rings; he glared, but then looked saddened before drifting back to Naugus.

   The next day, taking advantage of the fears of the people, Geoffrey stepped out into public and announced Naugus as the "true king" before a massive crowd. Sally immediately attempted to have him arrested, but, pulling rank as commander, he called off the royal guard. In order to keep the Freedom Fighters away from Naugus as he made his way to meet the Council of Acorn, St. John ended up engaging the group in battle. However, they distracted him long enough for NICOLE to create a nanite-made enclosure around him. To their surprise, St. John dissolved to smoke and escaped via the airholes; the Freedom Fighters were shocked to realize that St. John seemed to be an Ixis wizard as well. Sally demanded to know what Geoffrey's wife thought of his siding with Naugus; Geoffrey glanced away sadly and told her,

   During the battle, Sally accused him of murdering his wife, which shocked Geoffrey, who stated that he and Hershey were on separate missions and when she failed to report in, he went to investigate for himself. He went on telling the Freedom Fighters to think of him as they wished, but to not belittle his wife's sacrifice and then claimed that she went down fighting the Eggman Empire. Sally convinced him to stop the battle, that fighting would not help his cause. When the

   Geoffrey St. John was seated across from Amy Rose, his eyes glassy and his body lax. He finally seemed to be coming around, and after Amy asked Bunnie and Antoine if they were okay and Bunnie told Amy that she thought they were okay, Amy roughly prodded Geoffrey's boot with the handle of her hammer and warned him that he better not be up to something. Geoffrey gave her an impatient glare, and told her that he did not know what she was talking about. She sarcastically accepted his response and told him that Ixis Wizards are all about tricky stuff, but he retorted that he was an apprentice and that all he had was his meager wind magic. She then said that regardless, the quarters were pretty tight and hefted her hammer while giving him a warning glare, further stating that she would not miss. Geoffrey rolled his eyes but said nothing. The Freedom Fighter Special lurched to the side, and a moment later the hiss of laser-fire could be heard resuming outside. (

That plan also fell through thanks to Sally and Sonic, but Sally was roboticized in the process. After the Death Egg was sent packing, Geoffrey helped the people of New Mobotropolis invite Naugus as their new king, even swiping the crown from Elias' head and crowning Naugus. Sonic berated Geoffrey on this, but the skunk brushed it off, saying he had a mission to complete. Shortly after, Antoine arrested Geoffrey for treason and he remained in custody throughout the

Despite Geoffrey's actions being in the best interests of the now current King Naugus, he was found guilty by the court for acting against what was the current authority when his act of treason began. Using his power as king however, Naugus gave Geoffrey an official royal pardon, allowing Geoffrey to be proven guilty and free of all charges at the same time (

Their conversation had just ended when Geoffrey entered Naugus's quarters. Despite having been too late to discover his master's intentions, Geoffrey gave his master a suspicious look as they walked outside. (

During the battle, Metal Sonic latched on to Elias' vehicle with the intent to destroy it and its occupants; Antoine thwarted the robot, but was severely injured and rendered comatose by the resulting explosion. Upon learning of this, Geoffrey came to Antoine's room to pay his respects. He entered to see the departure of a newcomer,

Turning his attention to Antoine, Geoffrey gave a salute and, stating the fallen commander had "had him all along", asked him to come back as soon as possible so they could have a man-to-man talk. Geoffrey then left, though not before giving his sympathies to Sonic for the loss of Sally and stating that, while they may be on opposing sides, that doesn't mean he can't respect his enemies. (

Despite the team's best efforts to stop him, Geoffrey managed to trap his pursuers in the crypt and escape, despite being a little worse for the wear.

   Geoffrey arrived back to New Mobotropolis and ventured into the pit caused by the Armada. Inside, he reported back to Ixis Naugus, who, much to Geoffrey's shock, had been hideously deformed due to the spirits dwelling inside his body. After Naugus undid his mutations, Geoffrey presented the remains to his master. However, after hearing what Naugus planned to do with them, he snatched the remains back, arguing that Naugus was going too far with this plan. Naugus, though, retorted that Geoffrey was not one to lecture on "morality" when he himself had committed questionable acts in order to serve the crazed wizard. In addition, Naugus noted that Geoffrey could not defy him as no one would trust him for his treachery and he had no chance of taking on Naugus himself even if he wanted to. Upon this reminder, Geoffrey reluctantly returned the remains, horrified at what he had done. Later, Naugus dispatched him to search the bottom of the pit to for the bodies of the Secret Freedom fighters. There, Geoffrey found them alive and uninjured as they discussed Naugus' plans. He was surprised to recognize the power gem core attached to Shard and as the same one he retrieved from Mount Mobius with his former team. There was, of course, only one Mobian Geoffrey knew of who could have created such a unique Freedom Fighter group:
   Harvey Who
   . As that moment, he heard them plan on capturing and interrogating him. However, Agent Ace - in fact Silver the Hedgehog - suggested simply asking him, to St. John's surprise. Elias is quick to dismiss the idea, but Silver persists, thinking that he can appeal to Geoffrey's better nature. Elias starts on a rant, but is defused as Lyco advises him to listen to Silver. The Hedgehog continues, remarking that he has experience with going into a plan with good intentions only for it to fail, and he thinks that Geoffrey is the same way. Elias relents, deciding that they will approach him Silver's way, but that if that fails to work, they'll ambush him. Geoffrey, hearing the conservation, looks off wistfully at the psychics's understanding. (

   The next day, Geoffrey was approached by Silver at the Lake of Rings. After the skunk shocked the hedgehog by slyly addressing him as "Ace" (therefore having guessed his identity), he invited him to sit down and talk. All throughout, Geoffrey made no effort to put up resistance, as he had previously overhead the team agreeing to attack him if he did so. Silver, who was from the future, revealed that he had done a great deal of research on Geoffrey since he had arrived in the latter's time. With this knowledge, Silver had drawn the conclusion that Geoffrey never wanted to bring harm to the city or its citizens. After Silver brought up the subject of his wife (much to Geoffrey's displeasure), the skunk informed him that Naugus planned to cast a spell that night under the Royal Military Headquarters to enslave the citizens of the city and left the scene. Silver tried to convince him to help them, but Geoffrey solemnly said that it was "too late" for him; Silver had a future to save, while Geoffrey did not. (

   That night, Geoffrey unenthusiastically joined Naugus in his underground lair as he prepared to unleash his spell. The wizard asked his apprentice if he had found any traces of the Secret Freedom Fighters in the pit, to which Geoffrey lied, saying he had seen nothing of them, whilst secretly hoping they would thwart Naugus's plan. Seconds later, the Secret Freedom Fighters themselves - minus Joker (actually Larry Lynx) - burst into the room and attacked. (

   In the ensuing fight, Geoffrey was up against Agents
   "Queen of Diamonds"
   and
   "Queen of Hearts"
   . Though he admitted they had great form in their fighting skills, Geoffrey knew they were only distracting him. He thus turned his attention to Agent "King", who was setting explosives to destroy the chamber, and fired a crossbow bolt at him. King attempted to shoot back with his own crossbow, but Geoffrey disarmed him and the two then engaged in a brief but intense one-on-one brawl, ending with Geoffrey knocking punching off King's goggles, forcefully removing his mask, and throwing him against a wall to reveal none other than Elias Acorn. After taunting the dethroned ex-prince about his own callsign and the time when he had him "wrapped around his little finger", Geoffrey unexpectedly gave Elias his mask back; whether this was a gesture of respect is unknown. Geoffrey then prepared for "round two" - which was short-lived, as Shard destroyed Naugus's chalice and Ixis Vale's bones. Geoffrey told Elias he should have done that to begin with, but Silver telekinetically threw him into a wall, saying he did not get to judge them, allowing Elias to detonate the explosives. As the chamber collapsed around them, the Secret Freedom Fighters made their getaway and Geoffrey, shooting the beaten Naugus a dirty look, tried to follow them out, ignoring his master's cries for help. However, the enraged wizard trapped St. John and cornered him in the caverns in his mutated form. As he struggled to free himself, Geoffrey told his master that he was only trying to chase down the enemy agents, and suggested that Naugus play for sympathy in order to avoid suspicion from the Acorn Council. Buying the story, Naugus, again undoing his mutations, released Geoffrey and, commended him for his "good thinking", to which Geoffrey responded "Of course. I live to serve," with a stern look on his face. (

   and took the Sword of Light away from him when it caused him pain. He continued to follow Naugus during the day, overhearing him talking to his voices and searching for a vessel. Later, he escorted Naugus to attend Mina's concert with it being his last public appearance of the day. As Mina dedicated the concert to NICOLE, Geoffrey tried his best to have Naugus keep a good public image. When the concert started, Tails Doll caused the stage to collapse and Team Freedom rushed to save Mina and the Forget Me Knots. Geoffrey accused Naugus of causing the stage collapse, but realised that he was in pain. He helped escort Naugus out of the public eye to his thanks, but Geoffrey snapped with his true views of Naugus betraying the public. He tried to convince Naugus to ask for help and to accept that the citizens want to help as well. He believed that his message was helping Naugus, when Naugus revealed that Geoffrey was in contract with him and possessed his body. Using Geoffrey's body, he returned to the Council of Acorn, who were welcoming NICOLE back to the city. He pretended that Naugus gave his support with NICOLE and confessed that the king was sick-apparently dying-and needed their support to help him. (

   Geoffrey is a black-and-white skunk with blue eyes and white hair. In early depictions, he was often drawn with a somewhat thick, bulky build, though this has gradually lessened. His original attire typically consisted of bright purple boots, belt/bandolier, gloves and a beret (though the later was not a constant feature), as well as a green (sometimes teal or blue) neckerchief. He later wore a similar outfit featuring boots, gloves, and a beret in brown or olive green, with the additions of a closed blue/violet vest, a blue neckerchief and a clear visor. He's often been shown in a black tuxedo with a black bow-tie and red cummerbund. Artist J. Axer later redesigned Geoffrey, giving him a highly-detailed full-body combat suit in olive green, retaining the visor. However, following his betrayal, Geoffrey returned to his original attire; while possessed by Ixis Naugus, his irises have a slight red tint to them.

Eventually, though, he came to accept that Sally no longer had feelings for him as she had in the beginning, and so abandoned his romantic relationship with her.

   Geoffrey and Hershey met following Robotnik's death, and the two became fast friends before becoming members of the Secret Service. As Hershey continued to pass the rigorous tests Geoffrey set for her, he grew to be more and more impressed by her abilities, but was also more concerned when she went into the field alone than he might have been for others under his command. Presumably, his feelings of attraction towards her grew for some time following his breaking off romantic ties with Sally, but it wasn't until Hershey admitted her own love for him that Geoffrey responded in kind. She buoyed him up in the wake of losing both his team and contact with his master, Ixis Naugus. The two continued to work together for a year, and were finally married at the same time that Sonic returned to Mobius. Their marriage seemingly ended when Geoffrey learned that his wife died while on an undercover mission. In his grief over his apparent loss, he felt he had lost a direction in his life, which led to his return to Ixis Naugus.

   Hershey's body was not found however, leaving the possibility of Geoffrey's wife still being alive.

    Originally, Geoffrey spoke with an Australian accent, then switched over for a strong cockney one, common among those from London, England. Ian Flynn stated in his message board that he plans on going back to the Australian accent whenever he portrays Geoffrey.

    Geoffrey's absence from StH #247 and #252 was due to his being a creation of Ken Penders. As such, he never appeared since.

    According to former writer
    Ken Penders
    , Geoffrey was originally planned to have had a sexual relationship with Sally Acorn at some point, but no opportunity was made to include it into the story prior to Penders' departure from his writing role.
