   The second incarnation of Enerjak arose during the
   Forgotten War
   between the
   Order of Ixis
   and the
   Albion Knights of Aurora
   . Apparently a researcher like his predecessor, he sought a means for his people to defeat the Order, but in the course of his experiments he was corrupted by power and possessed by the spirit of the first Enerjak. So great was the threat posed by this Enerjak that the two warring factions temporarily put aside their hostilities in order to engage and destroy their common foe. Exactly how this Enerjak was overcome is unknown. (

Super Sonic’s invulnerability enabled him to hold up well against Enerjak's assault at first, and Knuckles’ limited imagination hindered him from using his full ability to be rid of the hedgehog with ease. All the while, Super Sonic taunted him and did his best to bring out Knuckles' old self, but these efforts proved futile as Dr. Finitevus had "locked" the hex placed on Knuckles, making it so that only the sacrifice of someone's life could break the spell. Julie-Su and Archimedes were both willing to do so, but it was a guilt-stricken Locke who finally took on the responsibility while the other two fought off Finitevus. With the spell broken, Knuckles was returned to normal and Enerjak ceased to be once again. (

Knuckles' regret even led to tension in his romantic relationship with Julie-Su, though he eventaully managed to come to terms with all this.

   and limited only to the imagination of the avatar. In comparison to most beings, anyone who assumes the mantle of Enerjak is a near omnipotent. Enerjak has been shown to be capable of teleportation, telepathy, mind control, levitation, control over matter and energy at a molecular level, becoming a giant and super strength. Knuckles' version of Enerjak also utilized Chaos energy in a fashion similar to Shadow the Hedgehog's

Like Chaos Knuckles, Enerjak is permanent so long as no extenuating circumstances -- such as death or being subjected to a magical artifact or siphon device -- result that drain Enerjak's powers and revert him to whomever he was before becoming Enerjak.

   When Dimitri initially became overloaded with Chaos energy, he simply glowed green; however, when he reappeared he had gained the more recognized Enerjak armour since the spirit had fully manifested itself by then. The ornate blue-and-gold outfit is somewhat Egyptian in appearance, resembling that of Egyptian pharaohs and gods, the faceplate in particular, and typically consists of a menacing mask covering all but the lower jaw bearing a red gem on the forehead, a chestplate, blue skirt, gold adornments on the arms and legs with blue clothing between, and boots with rounded gold toes. However, there are some variations in the design between Dimitri's version and that of Knuckles.    
As Enerjak, Dimitri's faceplate was open at the back, allowing his long, wrapped dreadlocks to flow out, while the version worn by Knuckles featured a studded partial helmet over the top of the head. Dimitri's had a round red gem; Knuckles, a more angular one. Dimitri's gloves had thin gold strings wrapped between the fingers; Knuckles retained his usual gloves (though sometimes coloured blue rather than white) and his boots featured rounded studs. He also gained two blue belt-like pieces ending in gold triangular pieces at the waist. Both carried a golden, eagle-headed staff sometimes used as a weapon.

   The original Enerjak was originally a benevolent scientist. However, like most of those who his spirit eventually possessed, he was corrupted due to coming into possession of immense power, which led to his downfall. When Dimitri was in the role of Enerjak, he retained his genius but displayed a clear lack of respect for any other intelligent beings. Others were simply there to amuse him, which he was quite willing to do on a regular basis. He felt completely justified in all his actions, and was also arrogant, boastful and vindictive to the extreme.

  <p key="d143d6c0-c68d-47e4-963f-1d785d8a4c86">
   The most recent Enerjak, his persona supplied by Knuckles, was similar to previous ones but with noticeable differences. While still brutal and unforgiving, he retained the feelings Knuckles had towards his closest friends and family-in particular, his love for Julie-Su and his compassion towards Remington, the latter of whom was first to be restored to a normal Echidna state in place of his Dark Legion parts, and restored his memory that was lost when he was trapped in the egg grapes. Rather than acting as a conqueror, Knuckles/Enerjak saw himself as a deliverer, a savior and bringer of peace to the people of Mobius,

  <p key="967db3b5-5d8f-4055-a49c-44cbd1a90f03">
   He also had Knuckles' general dislike of technology-no doubt born from years of living without it and fighting those who relied on it for power blown completely out of proportion. In addition, he thought himself to truly be of divine nature, and thus irrevocably in the right to do as he saw fit.
   Dr. Finitevus' hex
   appears to have had a disruptive effect on his sense of right and wrong: he had many of Knuckles' desires but seemed utterly uncaring how he went about achieving them or whether they were moral or not.
