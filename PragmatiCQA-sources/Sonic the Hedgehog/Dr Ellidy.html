   Ellidy was the father of
   Nikki the Lynx
   , a bright young girl whom he loved dearly and at whose suggestion he made the Mobotropolis Grand Archive into a public database. Unfortunately, Nikki's health began to deteriorate, and Ellidy set out to try and save her. His colleague

   progressed too slowly to save Nikki. In desperation, Ellidy began using his
   Digitizer
   device to try and preserve Nikki's mind in the
   Digital World
   . He succeeded in mapping basic neural pathways digitally, and created an A.I. intended to prepare the way for Nikki's mind to be copied into a computer. Dr. Ellidy later activated a handheld computer containing this program, desperately hoping for some sort of reaction. However, when the feminine artificial intelligence responded with an emotionless computerized voice and announced that she had no designation, Ellidy was devastated. (

   After years of service to the king, Ellidy decided that it was time to leave Mobotropolis, saying that there were "too many old memories" in the kingdom, and it was time for a fresh start. He was greeted by a young Princess Sally, to whom he gave the computer as a present, confessing that she would make better use of it than he would. He explained that it had a connection to Mobotroplis's Grand Archive and an advanced A.I. that would respond to Sally's commands and questions. Recognizing the A.I. as a "female", Sally asked Ellidy of "her" name. Surprised at this question, he tried to come up with a name, only to be emotionally affected upon trying to utter one. King Acorn stepped in to suggest one based on "a long-past queen of their line":
   Nicole
   . Dubbing the A.I. with the name, Sally thanked Ellidy for the present and promised to take care of Nicole. Ellidy then bid farewell to the king and princess before leaving the kingdom.

   During an expedition to the Digital World, Ellidy was attacked by
   strange creatures
   , and his path back to the real world was blocked by a firewall. With his strength failing he sent out a distress call, and was stunned when it was answered by his old creation, Nicole. After saving him from his attackers, Nicole led him back to the portal, where she swiftly disabled the firewall. Having noticed her Lynx appearance, Ellidy questioned whether Sally had caused her to take it on, and was informed that she had chosen it, something that made him thoughtful. The pair arrived back on Isolated Island just in time to greet Sally,

   The following day, Ellidy showed his guests a new discover: a
   Red Star Ring
   produced by the
   Lake of Rings
   on the island. Ellidy noted that the ring had the potential for much greater energy than a normal ring, but admitted to being ignorant as to what produced it, other than a vague theory about it being connected to the energies of
   <a href="Dark Gaia.html" key="5ddc5c46-3c79-4f5c-91da-18bc5e83e540" title="Dark Gaia">

   . He then informed the Freedom Fighters that the lake had gone dormant prior to producing the ring and had done so again, while his security robot no longer showed footage of the lake despite registering as active. Nicole then expressed her fear that someone was trying to take over Ellidy's system, which he reluctantly conceded was a possibility. While Nicole and Tails took up the task of checking Ellidy's software and hardware, the doctor provided Sally and Big with a vehicle to go check on the Lake of Rings Badnik. While helping Nicole, Ellidy questioned at what point she became self-aware, something that she had trouble defining. After Big and Sally returned with a second ring and reported that the Badnik had attacked them, Ellidy directed Big and Tails to his living room for sleeping quarters, apologizing for not having guest accommodations. That night, however, an irate Ellidy discovered Sally poking around his
   home
   and confronted her. (

   Questioned by Sally about a shrine constructed in Nikki's memory, Ellidy revealed that she was his daughter, and that Nicole was supposed to save her life. He then disclosed his attempt to save her, and how Nicole was "born" as a result. The two soon got into a heated argument, which Sally broke up upon realizing that they were being affected by

   that Phage had discovered on the island, Sally surprised Ellidy by giving him one of the Ring-Blades and then preparing to enter the Digital World via the Digitizer. Ellidy tried to dissuade her with the reminder that she was a princess, but Sally responded that her family existed to protect others and that, whatever Ellidy's feelings about Nicole, Sally wasn't willing to give up on her.

   Ellidy watched as Sally and Nicole desperately attempted to defeat Phage by luring her outside of his system and sealing her out, only for their efforts to flounder due to Phage's superior power. As her hijacked Badniks entered the lab, Ellidy was struck by inspiration and inserted one of the Red Star Rings into Nicole's handheld. This resulted in Nicole taking on the
   Super Transformation
   of
   Overclocked Nicole
   , which she used to banish Phage from the system, restoring control of the island to Ellidy. The Freedom Fighters soon prepared to leave, and Ellidy bid farewell to Sally and apologized for his previous harsh words against Nicole. She forgave him, since they had both been under Dark Gaia's influence, but suggested that he should be apologizing to Nicole. She acknowledged that while Nicole couldn't replace Nikki, Ellidy should still get to know her, which prompted Ellidy to wish that Sally had been able to meet Nikki. He then said that he needed more time to think about approaching Nicole; unbeknownst to him, his creation had learned the secret of her origins while fleeing Phage in his systems. As the Freedom Fighters prepared to leave, Ellidy surprised Nicole by giving her the other Red Star Ring, feeling that she would be able to analyze it while he was making repairs on his lab and asking her to send him her findings.

   Dr. Ellidy is very intelligent, but also rather reclusive and reluctant to accept help. While he typically appears cool and fairly collected, at times he also becomes highly emotional. Ellidy is fairly confident in his own abilities, and becomes somewhat irritable at the notion that someone might be able to work around his precautions. He deeply loved his daughter Nikki and mourned her death; the sight of Nicole in a Lynx form proved an unpleasant reminder of all that his daughter never got to do. Initially he is slow to recognize Nicole in the same way that her friends do, and seemed to think little of destroying her if it meant eradicating Phage as well. However, talking with Sally and seeing Nicole's personality firsthand helped him see that there was more to her than a failed attempt to save Nikki's life, and he began to open up to her.
