   appeared before Shadow and told him to bring him the Chaos Emeralds "as promised" before disappearing. Fueled with desire to seek out his past and find the truth behind Black Doom's words, Shadow sped off to obtain the emeralds. During his adventure, he provided some level of assistance to the invaders, which resulted in feelings of mistrust towards him from some citizens of Mobius. After successfully gathering all of the emeralds, Shadow was confronted by Black Doom, who commanded him to give up the emeralds so that they can begin the 'Ritual Of Prosperity'. Sonic and the others, including Dr, Eggman, then arrived and told Shadow not to listen to the alien leader. After it was revealed that Black Doom wished to harvest humans as an energy source, he took the Chaos Emeralds from Shadow and used Chaos Control to warp the Black Comet down to the surface of the planet. Black Doom then explained that he helped Professor Gerald create Shadow but only in return for the Chaos Emeralds, which were needed to bring the comet down to the surface. This revealed that Shadow was actually created using Black Doom's DNA. As Eggman was in disbelief that his grandfather would betray the planet, Black Doom paralyzed everyone with a special gas and left them to be devoured by his alien offspring. As the end seemed near, Shadow suddenly heard Maria asking for help and he broke through the paralysis. (

It was revealed that the only way to defeat the Black Arms was to destroy the Black Comet using the Eclipse Cannon, a powerful weapon built into the ARK. As the video ended, Maria stepped into the frame and gave Shadow the inspiration he needed to break through Black Doom's control. Black Doom escaped and prompted Shadow to use the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Shadow and fight the alien leader. Black Doom, now in his Devil Doom form, fought Shadow but was defeated. Shadow then used a super-powered Chaos Control to warp the Black Comet back into the planet's orbit and tear it apart with a blast from the Eclipse Cannon. Everyone below on Earth cheered in joy as the alien threat was destroyed seemingly forever. On board the ARK, Shadow looked at a picture of Maria and Gerald before tossing it away, remarking "Goodbye forever... Shadow the Hedgehog". (

   In the events of a timeline that was later aborted, Shadow and the other members of Team Dark became involved in a series of time-traveling battles with a villain known as
   Mephiles
   . After possessing Shadow's shadow in order to take on a form resembling the Ultimate Lifeform, Mephiles led them on a chase that ended with a horrible revelation. In the future resulting from that timeline, Shadow had been blamed for the catastrophe that had befallen Mobius, and hunted down by his own reprogrammed comrade Omega and imprisoned. However, Rouge vowed to stand by Shadow no matter what, and after he worked with

In the process, he awoke Mega Man, Sonic, and Tails' memories of the unaltered realities, and also disrupted the Skull Egg Zone. Shortly thereafter, the restored Amy and Sonic set out to find him in order to have him join their alliance against the doctors. (

Sonic proved an irritant to Shadow as usual during the fight, claiming that he had "teleported off in a huff", complimenting him for finding Omega, and assuring him that they would rescue Rouge. Shadow ended up racing

Despite the fact that Rouge (who had been de-roboticized by Mega Man earlier) and Dr. Light were now fighting with them, the exhausted heroes (now joined by Tails and Rush after the former was injured aboard the Wily Egg) eventually found themselves surrounded by the Robot Masters. Luckily, help arrived in the form of the original Robot Masters from Light Labs, allowing Knuckles, Proto Man, Dr. Light, and Rush to board the Wily Egg and rescue Mega Man and Sonic, who had been captured by Eggman and Wily. Shadow then watched with the others as the blue heroes defeated the doctors and used Chaos Control to restore their worlds. (

Shadow coldly refused, to Eclipse's disappointment and rage. Shadow gained the upper hand in the fight, but Eclipse retaliated by using his monster transformation to overpower Shadow. Shadow was nearly defeated until he used the Master Emerald to override Eclipse's ability to block his Chaos Control. Shadow used this moment to unleash a barrage of attacks and used Chaos Blast to send Eclipse flying out of his monster form and into the horizon. Once Knuckles' group returned, Shadow informed them that he take the Master Emerald to a secure G.U.N. facility so that they could protect it from Eclipse.

   , injuring Shadow's teammates and seizing the Master Emerald. Upon sensing this occurrence and being chastised by Rouge, the pair put aside their fight in order to track down Eclipse. Knuckles' knowledge of the island allowed them to reach Launch Base at roughly the same time as Eclipse, who had been delayed by the efforts of the others. Knuckles and Shadow's combined might proved too much for Eclipse and his Dark Arms, though
   Rhygenta
   's Sonic Cannon prevented them from finishing the job. Knuckles then defied both Shadow and his nemesis by shattering the Emerald and scattering its fragments across Mobius, ensuring that neither surviving representative of the Black Arms could claim it. Eclipse managed to escape, and Shadow and his teammates left the island, though Rouge was later instructed by Knuckles to inform the black Hedgehog that "He's a jerk." (

   While Knuckles went on with Nixus to reassemble the Master Emerald, Shadow headed to Amy and Rouge's rescue, both of whom were under attack by a crystallized version of Omega. After being informed by Amy that Nixus was actually Walter Naugus in disguise, the three set off and found Knuckles, only for Crystal Omega to suddenly attack them all. After much fighting and struggling, Shadow and his allies finally broke Walter's magical grip on Omega and were about to confront the vile wizard himself when he, having fully restored the Master Emerald, encased them in solid crystal. Delighted with himself, Walter fled with Amy and the Master Emerald in tow, although Shadow and his teammates were broken free by Knuckles, who had freed himself. The four caught up to Naugus and directly engaged him, while also keeping him away from the Master Emerald. (

   Very much convinced of the belief that he is the Ultimate Lifeform, Shadow is arrogant and stubborn, and upon making a decision is slow to change his mind or let anyone stand in the way. Behind his gruff exterior lies a heart with a genuine desire to protect the world, though at times he seems convinced that his is the only voice that matters in accomplishing this task. Very sure of his powers and abilities, he has the tendency to go off on his own or challenge forces he hasn't yet become acquainted with, and this often gets him into trouble. However, he is not above receiving correction-- particularly from his closest friends-- when the situation calls for it.
  </p>
  <p key="f336ed99-d5b1-43cd-85c2-49dce320b41a">
   Shadow was previously consumed with his past-- particularly during a period of his life in which he had amnesia-- and recognizes his kinship with the alien Black Arms. However, Shadow is also wise enough to recognize that the Black Arms are a race of predators and monsters and is determined to see them wiped out. While slow to smile or show warmth, Shadow does care for his friends and allies, even with the knowledge that his longevity may allow him to outlive them all. Most often, however, he puts on an attitude of cool indifference or businesslike precision, only rarely showing his more vulnerable side.

  <p key="e423a62e-eac7-4dd0-96e1-27800dfc6fca">
   Thanks to his hover-equipped shoes, Shadow is capable of matching Sonic's natural speed and many of his abilities. He also possesses an inherent connection to Chaos energy lacked by many of his allies, and can utilize Chaos power without the use of a Chaos Emerald or the Master Emerald, though using either heightens his abilities. Shadow can also increase his power by removing his
   Inhibitor Rings
   , which allows him to perform powerful attacks such as
   Chaos Blast
   ; however, he has the tendency to run out of energy more quickly by doing this. Shadow is also incredibly resilient, capable of taking a great deal of punishment but staying in a fight.
