The two evil scientists briefly argued over which of them had contributed more, but eventually agreed that whichever of their nemeses managed to survive longest would prove his world's superiority. With the Genesis Unit defeated and the Chaos Emeralds gathered, the pair decided upon a new use for their Roboticized Masters: to have them attack Sonic and Mega Man's party. (

As the army engaged the heroes-including all the restored Roboticized Masters-Wily and Eggman confronted Dr. Light once again, only to be presented with an impassioned plea to stop. Wily refused, claiming that Light had always been jealous of him and that he and Eggman were in complete control, only for Light to remind him of his failure to control Ra Moon and various other menaces from their altered reality. Wily and Eggman left to observe the battle, but Eggman left Wily's presence with a sinister purpose: to throw Light from the Wily Egg and eliminate him as a threat once and for all. (

   Eggman's actions did not go unnoticed, and Wily was furious with him for attempting to murder Dr. Light. Their friendship dissolving, the pair of doctors quickly resolved to eliminate each other at the first opportunity. Despite this, they remained determined to slow down the heroes long enough to accomplish their plan, and dispatched the

   put a hitch in their plans, as his battle with the Chaos Devil threatened to tear the Wily Egg apart and disrupt the Genesis Wave. However, the fight also kept him too occupied to face the doctors directly, which they took advantage of by completing the Egg-Wily Machine X. Using the machine, they captured the weakened Sonic and Mega Man and imprisoned them in the Genesis Reactor chamber, where their mutual respect for each other was briefly rekindled as they explained their plan: to use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to fire a Super Genesis Wave that would allow them to rewrite reality according to their every desire, whereas the first wave had been limited.

   Exulting in what they believed to be imminent godhood, the pair remained hostile to each other, particularly when Eggman revealed something to Sonic that he hadn't mentioned to Wily: that their tampering with the laws of reality had damaged their home universes to the point of near collapse. He quickly calmed Wily by explaining that all the damage would be undone by the Super Genesis Wave, but the pair were then faced by another problem: the sudden intrusion of Proto Man, Dr. Light, and Sonic's friend

   . While Light freed Sonic and Mega Man, the red heroes attacked the doctors, forcing them to make a desperate run for the Egg-Wily Machine X. As Wily powered the vehicle up, he was warned not to draw too much power from the reactor, prompting him to point out that Eggman had ascribed limitless power to the Chaos Emeralds. As the assault continued, each doctor discovered that the other had sabotaged his personal defense systems, forcing them to work together to undo the damage. The two agreed to a temporary truce, though each was still planning to eliminate the other, just as the Super Genesis Wave activated. However, the pair were then forced to contend with

   , which prompted them to unleash all their firepower. After an intense-and insult riddled-battle, the doctors were defeated, and the heroes prepared to restore their worlds. Wily, feeling utterly bested, decided that it was best just to give up, and wondered if he would even remember the events of his alliance with Eggman. His partner, nowhere near so calm in the face of defeat, managed to get a piece of their vehicle working and attacked Super Sonic. Unable to interfere, he could only watch as Eggman took off to attack Sonic, and was caught up in Super Mega Man's efforts to restore their world to its previous state. (

As they prepared to transform the heroes into new Roboticized Masters, Eggman's dislike of Wily got on his nerves to the point that he confronted Eggman about it. As a result, Eggman learned that Wily had no memory of their previous alliance, and took advantage of the situation to restore their previous rapport. He explained how they had joined forces in the reality altered by the Super Genesis Wave, and then claimed that Dr. Light had ruined their alliance by spreading a lie that Eggman had tried to kill him. Wily was somewhat astonished that Light would have pulled such a trick, but was quickly convinced that he had done so out of jealousy. The pair then transformed the heroes into

  <p key="f5002cd5-298b-4c83-a379-1b9561ce0a4b">
   Dr. Wily is arrogant, self-obsessed, treacherous, and immensely proud of his own genius, not to mention his mustache. Despite numerous experiences with attempting to control powerful forces only for them to threaten him as well as his enemies, he is constantly attempting to bend such forces to his will. These qualities, which Dr. Eggman shared, formed the basis of their friendship, but also led to conflict between the two. Furthermore, there existed a number of differences between the pair that proved to be the breaking point between them. Most of all, Albert in time came to realize that Eggman's rather extreme methods were not in harmony with his own somewhat dubious code of conduct.
  </p>
  <p key="02d02208-18e7-43c1-9843-097605988324">
   While he enjoys watching his creations bring about destruction and mayhem in his name, Wily prefers to humiliate his enemies-at least in the case of Dr. Light-rather than cause them any physical harm, whereas Eggman is all too willing to take lives. Wily also enjoys having minions with personality and free will, and didn't care much for the mindless obedience of the Roboticized Masters. Despite having numerous minions to perform tasks for him, Wily prefers to work on his most cherished projects personally, disdaining the idea of letting a machine do the work for him. Perhaps the greatest separation between the two villains was that Albert is willing to accept defeat, finding no shame in having been bested by a superior force, while Eggman was determined to do what damage he could even with his plans thwarted.
  </p>
  <p key="fffaca6f-50f2-461f-bce9-3d61140fe4ef">
   Wily's jealousy of Dr. Light is one of his greatest weaknesses, such that he's willing to believe just about anything negative about his old rival. He also shares the opinion with Eggman that building devices of conquest for someone else takes the fun out of it and makes the task grueling and tiresome.

A skilled inventor, designer, and technician, he rivals Eggman in terms of his proficiency with robots and weapons design. He is also a pilot of some skill, operating both his personal saucer transport and the Egg-Wily Machine X with great proficiency.

   Dr. Wily is an elderly human male, balding and gray-haired with a hairstyle that almost resembles wings sprouting from the side of his head. He also favors a mustache that is similar in arrangement to his hair, though its not quite as long or spread out as Dr. Eggman's. Wily wears fairly ordinary Earth attire: a white shirt with a tie, brown shoes and belt, and blue jeans, the only unconventional part of the outfit being his lab coat. During his time at the Lanfront Ruins, he wore stereotypical khaki shorts with a matching shirt and boots.
