   Simon
   and
   Floren-Ca
   as Luger had no parenting skills whatsoever. When Julie-Su's father was assassinated through the use of an
   Experimental Dark Legion weapon

   Julie-Su was then adopted by the Dark Legion couple

   , and was raised with no knowledge of her real parents or siblings. Lien-Da and Kragok attempted to have Simon killed off by sending him on raids with a poorly equipped troop detachment, but he survived and continued to assist in raising Julie-Su with his wife. However, Kragok eventually decided they could never be fully trusted, and after eight years of raising her, Julie-Su was taken from her adoptive parents, her memory of them erased. However, as a result Julie-Su was never firmly anchored in the Dark Legion, having no memory of her true connection to the group.(

   At the age of 13, Julie-Su became a support trooper in the Dark Legion and quickly adjusted to her mundane, day-to-day duties. The twin half-siblings ensured that Simon and Floren-Ca never revealed her true past or heritage, and she was constantly monitored by the two, especially during her shifts at the helm of the legion's
   Battle Cruiser
   where they sometimes contemplated doing away with her as well. (

She attempted to sneak up on him but, warned by Archimedes, he fought back and they had a brief scuffle, during which her hood was pulled off. Surprised to find his assailant was a girl, Julie took the opportunity to punch Knuckles and regain her tazer. Archimedes intervened, causing her to drop her taser and she soon stopped fighting. When asked why she was there, she eventually admitted that after seeing Knuckles in the complex,

   Julie-Su was mistrusted at first, but worked alongside Knuckles to discover the source of mysterious tremors on the island, which turned out to be caused by the zone fluctuations prior to the return of Echidnaopolis from its pocket zone. As surprised as Knuckles to find the city of their people, they both got involved in quelling the conflict between the Echidnas and dingoes. After this, Julie-Su and Knuckles developed an awkward friendship, but when Enerjak returned to the floating island and took control of the Legion, Julie-Su was returned to her former compatriots. While she told Kragok that she was glad to be back and only stayed with Knuckles out of convenience, she felt out of place among the Legion. She gassed the Chaotix when they attempted to escape, but finally she decided she no longer wished to be with the Legion, and during their invasion of Echidnaopolis, she betrayed Kragok, leading to his capture by the EST. As several witnesses put her as working with the Legion, she too was arrested despite her protests. (

Unaware of why he was attacking her, she managed to fend him off until he began strangling her, at which point she told him to simply kill her and get it over with. However, Tobor released her, realizing she had no ill intentions towards him. Tobor then explained his history to her, and she brought him back to Echidnaopolis on Thunder so he could talk to Knuckles. When Knuckles showed disbelief at Tobor's claim that he once was a Guardian, Julie-Su explained that she wasn't sure what to think of Tobor until she listened to his full story, thus convincing Knuckles to listen as well. After Knuckles left to interrogate Kragok about Tobor's story, Julie-Su accompanied Tobor to
   Lara-Le
   's house. After Tobor made an abrupt exit to help Knuckles, who he sensed was in danger, Julie-Su asked Lara-Le if it was always that way with Guardians, at which point Lara-Le stated the two needed to talk. She explained the hardships of being in a relationship with a Guardian, and told Julie-Su not to wish for more, to which she replied it was the furthest thing from her mind. Julie-Su and Lara-Le were overjoyed when Knuckles returned safely. (

   Meeting up later with the Chaotix and Knuckles, Julie-Su explained to them the
   Dingoes
   were beginning violent demonstrations in an effort to change the outcome of the upcoming election. The following day, Julie-Su and the Chaotix attended
   Benedict
   's first political rally to ensure the rally remained peaceful. Following that, the Chaotix was surrounded by a group of

   After Knuckles was taken away for experimentation by Dimitri, Julie-Su and Von Stryker were left upside down and forced to endure Xenin's tasteless and brutal sense of humor. After he struck the defenceless Von Stryker, Julie-Su sarcastically asked if he was always that funny, at which point Xenin held a pistol to her head and threatened to test it on her if she wanted to volunteer. When the Dark Legion base began to blow up from within due to its systems being overloaded by Knuckles, Julie-Su was left to die with Von Stryker by Xenin, who followed Dimitri's orders to evacuate the base but chose to leave them there to die. However, she and Von Stryker were saved just in time by Remington and Harry. (

   While Julie-Su and Knuckles discussed the matter of Benedict being a robot, Knuckles abruptly left to pursue his father, though Julie-Su was unaware of this. Due to Knuckles abandoning her so quickly, Julie-Su began feeling anger towards him, as her feelings for Knuckles were even stronger by this point. Frustrated by the sudden departure, Julie-Su later took out her rage by blasting a picture she had of Knuckles while wondering if he really cared about her. Realizing she needed to get out and do something with her day, she ended up being asked to lunch by someone she met while window shopping, a man named
   Raynor
   . After being taken home, Julie-Su still felt alone and upset. However, her feelings dramatically changed to joy when Knuckles asked her out on a date that night. (

Sally arrived and managed to convince them to remain behind, placating the angry Echidna with the promise that Sonic and Tails would go to look for Knuckles. Julie then watched through a
   probe
   sent by NICOLE as Enerjak defeated the
   Dingoes
   and the Dark Legion, and was the only Legionnaire-former or otherwise-who didn't have her cybernetic parts removed by Enerjak's power in the first wave, during which he also sent most of the transformed Legionnaires and the other Echidnas to Albion. (

   Enerjak then arrived in New Mobotropolis, by which point Julie-Su became convinced that Knuckles had died at his hands. She attacked in a rage, not caring what happened to her so long as she could avenge her love's demise. But then Enerjak revealed the full horror to her and the other defenders of the city: Knuckles couldn't have been killed by the new Enerjak, because he had become the new Enerjak. After he explained his plans to remove all technology from Mobius and thus establish peace, she tried to convince him to abandon his madness. Furious, he tried to force her to share his vision by restoring her body to a fully organic state, but was thwarted by the arrival of Sonic. She and the other Chaotix and Freedom Fighters were then caught in a pitched battle as first Sonic and then

   so that his power could be used by Dr. Eggman to fuel his own schemes. (

   Locke was still of the opinion that Knuckles had to be destroyed, but Julie-Su cut him to the quick by accusing him of hating his own son. Leaving him to ponder that shocking possibility, Julie went to confront Dr. Finitevus, intent on making him change Knuckles back. The mad doctor laughed at the suggestion, saying that he couldn't because his spell could only be undone by the sacrifice of a life. More than willing to die for her love, Julie-Su was about to attack, but was stopped by first Archimedes, and then Locke. After a brief battle with Finitevus, Julie watched as Locke made his way to the Emerald and undid the spell, promising Locke that she would tell Knuckles the reasons behind his actions and that Knuckles would understand why he had done what he had. With Knuckles freed and Finitevus fled, Julie and Sonic were both eager to return to New Mobotropolis-but Knuckles refused, saying that it was now his duty to watch over the Master Emerald, even if he had to do so alone.

   Julie-Su remained loyal to Knuckles despite his feelings of guilt, taking the Chaotix back to Angel Island to keep an eye on him and construct a bridge to connect
   Shrine Isle
   to the rest of the island. She was happily reunited with him after he received a pep talk from Rouge, but the pair soon found another problem to deal with: the

   , formed by the remnants of the Dark Legion swearing allegiance to Dr. Eggman in exchange for technology to replace that which they had lost because of Enerjak's actions. Despite Julie-Su's observation that Dimitri &amp; Lien-Da made the choice to sell out the Legion instead of being forced, they remained unswayed. Knuckles continued to hold himself responsible for his actions, regardless that Dr. Finitevus' spell had turned him against his friends and the rest of Mobius. This emotional state began to wear on Julie-Su as well and at one point they lashed out at each other over Knuckles' guilt and how it was affecting others besides him. Knuckles then took off to Shrine Isle and left Julie-Su in tears, but he returned a short time later with a cooler head and they reconciled, promising to work the situation out over time. (

Julie-Su then stated that they should not make a habit of saving each other, to which Vector agreed saying that they didn't want people to think they liked each other. After Mighty and Bunnie finished beating down the barricade, Julie-Su and the teams entered to see Eggman defeated and on the way back to New Mobotropolis, Julie-Su and Knuckles celebrated with a kiss.

   Helmut Von Stryker
   . Julie-Su was silent through the meeting, particularly as Stryker brought up the unpleasant events surrounding Knuckles' activities as Enerjak. Nonetheless, she showed no objections as the General offered to let the group go after Dr. Finitevus. After being dropped off in
   Sandopolis
   by their old friend
   Harry
   , the trio discovered a collection of ruins that they soon discovered had been built by Echidnas. However, they then fell victim to a booby trap hidden inside one of the structures. Julie-Su managed to slip out and deactivate the trap, allowing her teammates to escape. They then traveled through a Warp Ring they found to Downunda, where they found and engaged Dr. Finitevus. Chains appeared from Downunda's Great Crater to ensnare Angel Island, and Finitevus offered Julie and the others a chance to save Angel Island by working with him. (

   Knuckles was quick to accuse Finitevus of deploying the chains, but the doctor waved off his accusations with the logic that Knuckles had been attacking him when the chains had gone off. Julie-Su quickly leveled her weapon at him, asking him why he would care about Angel Island, to which he replied that he needed the Master Emerald. The group were then joined by Vector and

Julie initially objected to the arrangement, but Knuckles appeased her by asking her to watch his back, and praising her as the toughest fighter he'd ever faced. Her talents were soon put into service as she saved Knuckles from death at Finitevus' hands, enabling Knuckles to defeat his enemy. Afterwards, they shared a tender embrace, complimenting each other on their strength and promising to stay together. (

   Julie-Su called for Knuckles, and he looked to see her coming around the far side of the Master Emerald, blinking as if she had just woken from a dream. He told her that he was there and asked if she was okay. She replied, telling him that she was okay but she had a strange feeling like she was just back in the Twilight Cage. He nodded and told her that he felt that too and that it was like when he returned from the Chaos Force. She winced tiredly and wagged a finger at him, reminding him that he promised he would not bring that up, again. He smiled a little, then caught sight of Charmy flying towards him erratically. Knuckles asked if he was okay, and Charmy sleepily called back that he was okay and that he had just had the weirdest dream that he was a detective along with Espio and Vector. After acknowledging Charmy's response, Charmy went on to explain that they had their own office and everything. Knuckles then looked over to Julie-Su, who seemed to be studying her hands with concern. He asked if she was sure she was okay, but she absent-mindedly responded that she was fine and that she had a weird dream, too. She then apologized, explaining that she did not feel like herself.

As part of his atonement, Dimitri explained what had caused the disappearance of the Brotherhood: Dr. Finitevus had sent them to the Twilight Zone. Having been born in said zone, Julie-Su (and Knuckles) attempted to use a Warp Ring to access it, but it failed to function as it normally would; Julie later figured that there must be a special method used in order to use a ring to cross into different zones. She then attempted to comfort Knuckles, saying that even if the warp ring had worked, they had no idea what threats might be on the other side. (

Once there, the hedgehog asked to borrow the ring, explaining that Dr. Eggman had launched a new Death Egg, and that Princess Sally had been roboticized while putting a stop to one of its weapons. Thus, he wanted to use the ring to board the Death Egg and attempt to rescue her. Knuckles became enraged upon hearing this, and pointed out several flaws in this plan, and while Julie initially took their arguing for granted, she stepped in when Sonic said that Knuckles wouldn't hesitate to act if it were the Brotherhood at risk. Julie angrily pointed out that they had tried, only to meet with failure, and the point was reiterated: using the Warp Ring without knowing what they were getting into was too risky. Sonic, frustrated, left in a huff, and Julie asked Knuckles if he wanted to talk, as she knew that Sally had been a childhood friend of his. Instead, he decided that they needed to prepare in case the Death Egg moved towards Angel Island. (

   members, who generally rely on their natural abilities rather than weapons, Julie-Su carries with her a double-barrel, multi-purpose
   proton gun
   , attached to/inside one of her boots when not in use. This gun can be used for a great variety of tasks, the most notable non-lethal feature being the grappling hook, which is used to scale great heights. She lost this weapon during Thrash's ambush, and it was found by the Chaotix on Shrine Isle.

   Julie-Su is pink with violet eyes and purple-tipped bangs. As a former Dark Legionnaire, she bears cybernetic details; her left foremost dreadlock is fully robotic, and the others sport various metallic plates, rings and wires. Her gloves are mitt-like with the first finger on each separated. She wears a black tank top with teal padding on the left side, a yellow-orange belt and large, mechanical-looking teal boots. Her left arm is fully covered in metal rings; her right arm is often depicted as having similar rings on the forearm or lacking them entirely. Gradually, many of the smaller details of her initial design (including a thumb ring, a metal piece encircling her right leg, and teal bands around the cuffs of her gloves) were, for the most part, dropped. Her boots generally lost some detail and slimmed down greatly from their initial design. Depending on the artist, the length of her dreadlocks varies between shoulder- to knee-length. Her top and boots tend to shift between various blue and green shades depending on the colorist. Her eyes are often mistakenly colored blue and the darker tips of her bangs are often omitted. Sometimes her gloves are mistakenly drawn with full fingers.

   She has briefly appeared wearing the typical Dark Legion black hooded robe. On one occasion she sported a wide-brimmed sunhat embellished with roses and carried a brown purse. She’s been shown to sleep in a long white nightshirt. On two occasions she’s been depicted in more formal attire; a short black dress (with jacket) and a long, tan Echidna tribal gown with triangular grey and green trim (the latter designed by artist Tracy Yardley). As a child, she was depicted as wearing a padded shirt with layered sleeves; this, as well as her general character design, were both created by artist Patrick Spaziante.

    Romance

  <p key="1da0e771-7183-4737-abc7-26aac7edc011">
   Julie-Su is Knuckles's girlfriend and distant relative, both of them acknowledging each other as their ideal partners through the Echidna sixth sense called the
   Soultouch
   . Despite this connection, they initially treated each other as enemies, eventually becoming friends before finally developing romantic feelings for each other. Julie-Su once stated that Knuckles is her soulmate, the only being who makes her feel like she's more than a soldier. Recently, Julie-Su has found a rival for Knuckles' affections: none other than Rouge the Bat. Rouge has vowed to take Knuckles from Julie-Su, despite Julie-Su's warnings. However, Knuckles has not shown any interest in Rouge, and has repeatedly stated that Julie-Su is the only girl he will ever love. Also, since Rouge's interest in Knuckles is purely for her own gain, it is unlikely that she will be able to sway his opinion. Their relationship was later tested, however, by Knuckles' guilt over his actions as Enerjak. Fortunately, the two quickly reconciled and their bond proved as strong as ever; Julie-Su continued to stand by Knuckles' side through every challenge. Upon her capture at the hands of Thrash, Knuckles was enraged. (

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="0b801d4c-fb63-42ab-9c73-340644b32a75">
   Julie-Su is very similar to Knuckles in personality, acting tough most of the time while really being quite caring underneath. This similarity often caused them to butt heads, given that they were both stubborn and temperamental. She is an advocate of "girl power", serving as the only female member of the Chaotix until
   Saffron
   and later Rouge joined the group, though the latter did so only temporarily. Julie-Su is always willing to go into any danger, particularly when it involves saving Knuckles, whom she always attempts to aid despite his assurances that he doesn't need it.
  </p>
  <p key="b282574b-e97b-4c9f-ac96-c79c7eb65fa2">
   Julie-Su, known to her friends as Julie, Jules, or 'Su, prefers to go into battle with her friends rather than wait on the sidelines. She is also even more of a tomboy than Sally, and refuses to be seen in a dress, though she does wear them on special occasions. Despite this, she and Sally do share a number of feelings, including a deep desire not to see the men they care about-namely Knuckles and Sonic-get hurt. Julie's concern for Knuckles is one of the few things that gets her truly emotional, particularly when she sees that he is troubled or she believes that he is in danger.
  </p>
  <p key="45b7264c-b7db-4f46-bf4e-169a34cc0246">
   While she displays strong feelings whenever Knuckles is involved, at other times Julie-Su is more reserved, possibly as a result of her military training. Early on, she would show very little outward reaction to even the most surprising-and most likely upsetting-information. Being around the Chaotix has helped her to open up, to the point of showing concern for others, but she still remains rather disciplined. She does possess something of a temper, and is far from afraid to confront anyone who makes her angry.
  </p>
  <p key="1a43476f-eeb7-49b2-a2d4-0d697f01aec0">
   Julie-Su was also very fond of her foster parents, Simon and Floren-Ca, and regarded them as real family. Despite all they've done to her, Julie also still cares deeply for her family related by blood. Like Knuckles, she is also concerned for the welfare of the remaining Echidnas, though she doesn't appear to have the same interest in the history of their race. (
