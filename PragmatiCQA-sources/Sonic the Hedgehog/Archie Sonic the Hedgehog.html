  <p key="cb1f7acb-c58a-47e0-aeea-66da4fb492ec">
   The main focus of the comic's storyline was the title character, world-famous hero Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic is endowed with super speed and a hatred of oppression, which puts him at odds with the nefarious

   . Sonic is in many ways different from his game counterpart - in the comics, he is depicted as having important ties with his family and friends, a characteristic absent from other incarnations. He is also portrayed as having a deep sense of duty - in the games Sonic treats his ongoing conflict with Eggman as just an opportunity to have a fun time, whereas in the comic he holds a personal grudge against the Doctor and understands his ability to protect the world from this menace.

   and his legion of unquestioning, warlike robots. The basis of the original issues were designed to closely mirror Sonic SatAM, as well as the names and likenesses of Sonic's allies in the Freedom Fighters. Since then, the series has integrated many elements from the video games, which has led to ongoing story arcs involving,

   Initially, the series kept to a single continuity that lasted for the first 247 issues, as well as most spin-offs, before switching to an altered continuity from issue 252 onward. While the two continuities are completely different to each other at their core, they are still connected in terms of overall storyline, with an in-continuity reason for the switch.

Taking place in the year 4235, this dark version of the future reveals that the various members of the Knothole Freedom Fighters survived, while the rest of Mobius became uninhabitable due to Robotnik's victory (which costed him his own life). Thus the surviving Freedom Fighters left Mobius in space ships, each settling on a different planet, resulting in societies being born each looking similar to the Freedom Fighter that landed there. However, a violent race simply called "The Shark" began a war against their planets, and thus a member from each of the four races gathered together and formed the Freedom Fighters of the Galaxy.

  <p key="f526245d-14fc-4aa0-b2ee-7a4bf2b18f40">
   During the first two years, the comic consisted mostly of isolated stories. The continuity of the series was such, that only a few exceptions, the early issues could be interchanged with no noticeable effect. The only ironclad continuity during this period were the introductions of characters (such as
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Bunnie Rabbot.html" key="4103a690-3d3a-4f28-8811-b1b9a5047464" title="Bunnie Rabbot">

   ) that would become familiar and lasting faces as the series continued.
With little in the way of established character development, the team of writers had a largely free hand when it came to writing them. This resulted in a large amount of verbal and visual humor, with each issue built around Sonic and his allies constantly foiling Robotnik's plans- whether it be to tear down a forest or find the hidden location of Knothole Village or to build a robots of mass destruction. These stories often carried tongue-in-cheek environmentalist messages, with many of Dr. Robotnik's plans involving deforestation and pollution.

  <p key="027b5e80-36ac-4d70-8642-56d85f9d7747">
   During the third year of the comic's run, the issues started to gain of sense of continuity, as a number of ongoing story elements were introduced. This is most notable with the addition of the
   Mecha Sonic story
   in issue 39 and the
   <i key="5cda050b-d1d0-474c-9bec-f2a171217c97">

   roboticized
   in order to defeat Mecha Sonic.

  <p key="036b01ef-6121-49f4-8b4a-321968f83659">
   From here, the storyline would be further developed into what is now a fully continuous one. Following the defeat of Mecha Sonic, the Freedom Fighters come together in issue 46 to discuss ways to attack and defeat Robotnik once and for all. The loyalty of many of the Freedom Fighters comes into question, particularly notable in a feud between Sonic and

Just as thing appears to be going according to plan, Sally is hanging from a rope- in danger of falling- when Sonic appears. Just as it seems that he's going to rescue her, he takes a knife out and cuts the rope, sending her plummeting to the ground.

Issue #208 New Mobotropolis is taken over by the Iron Dominion after the Iron Queen takes control of NICOLE through her nanites, though in the next issue NICOLE regains control of herself and pretends to be controlled, through her Iron persona, so that Sally, Sonic, Tails, and Monkey Khan can defeat the Iron Dominion's forces after breaking their support lines.

While travelling to the Zone (and encountering Feist again), they succeeded in claiming a Chaos Emerald , only for Geoffrey to shoot Sonic in the back and take the Emerald for himself, leaving Sonic astray in the Special Zone. This act was none other then a ruse from Geoffrey to restore Ixis Naugus to sanity. Sonic managed to escape the Zone, but Geoffrey was nowhere to be found. While Naugus &amp; Geoffrey where preparing their plan to take over New Mobotropolis, Sonic &amp; the Freedom Fighters enjoyed some "peace", having no enemies around.

Sonic then brings the Freedom Fighters to Emerald Hill Zone to introduce them to his friend Tails, and after a new powerful earthquake, the group leaves to shut down Eggman's power sources, beginning with Chemical Plant Zone. After having a flashback from Sally being shot, Sonic decides to leave the group to confront directly Eggman (while Tails followed), so that all the others could be safe elsewhere. The rest of the Freedom Fighters went to Oil Ocean Zone to shut it down, being secretly spied on by Aquis. Sonic &amp; Tails went to Metropolis Zone for the final showdown with Eggman. In the meantime, we learned that the Death Egg Mark 2 had its energy drained because of the launch of Operation: Clean Sweep and that when recharged by the 7 Chaos Emeralds Eggman collected through unknown means, it will be able to roboticize the whole planet in one shot. The earthquakes that have been shaking the planet throughout the saga are a result of reality being stretched by Operation: Clean Sweep and fighting to snap back (Snively quotes this as the falling apart of all space-time continuum). Sally, Rotor &amp; Antoine manage to shut down Oil Ocean Zone, depriving Eggman's bases from fuel and power. Eggman escapes to the Death Egg Mark 2 with Sonic hopping on his shuttle. The two fight aboard the flying fortress with Eggman gaining the upper hand until Sonic uses the Chaos Emerald powered cables to transform into Super Sonic.

   Team Fighters began their journey when they travelled to and saved

   from Eggman's attack. They then followed the Death Egg to the
   Wolf Pack Nation
   , where they managed to prevent Lupe from being Legionized, and again to
   Feral Forest
   where Eggman's forces where deployed to go after Elias and his family. Eggman also took advantage of Sonic being away from home by launching an attack on New Mobotropolis, not counting on Team Freedom to take action. At the same time, Harvey Who's newly formed Secret Freedom Fighters had officially been formed, consisting of Silver the Hedgehog, Larry Lynx, the Wolf Pack twins Leeta and Lyco, who had been despatched to the city not long after Team Fighters visit to the Wolf Pack Nation, Elias, who had managed to escape the wrath of Eggman's forces in Feral Forest (not being spotted by Tails, who was sworn to secrecy), and the newly rebuilt

   and the exiled NICOLE where also in on the teams activities. The new group, unbeknownst to anyone else, also aided in Team Freedoms efforts to ward off Eggman's forces. The Secret Freedom Fighters would soon begin their main mission to keep tabs on King Naugus and his apprentice. It was revealed that Naugus was planning to enslave the city and rebuild the Order of Ixis, as well as the fact that he had began to mutate, making him more dangerous. Geoffrey, who was slowly beginning to realise the error of his masters true intentions, tipped off Silver about Naugus' plan to cast a spell over the Royal Military Headquarters, where the Council would be meeting to ratify the new constitution for the

   . The team successfully thwarted this plan, leaving Naugus's mutations to slowly become worse. He and his secretly treacherous apprentice later attended Mina Mongoose's latest concert, which she had put together in order to convince the citizens that the city needed NICOLE back, much to the corrupt kings dismay. The concert ended abruptly after the Tails Doll, in it's latest act of behind-the-scenes campaign of terror, causes the stage to collapse, however this event only supported Mina's case that NICOLE needed to be around to keep the Nanites stable, which would lead to the council immediately lifting her exile. Pushed to the edge over everything that's been happening to him, Naugus's mutations elevated to agonising proportions, leading Geoffrey to finally lashing out at his master over his recent evil deeds. To prevent his apprentice from breaking his contract, Naugus possessed Geoffrey's body, in order to sustain himself. Acting as Geoffrey, he continued to appear on the king's behalf, claiming him to be gravely ill. (#237-241, SU#41-44)

Thrash departed through his warp ring during Metal Knuckles attack, with Knuckles chasing after him, leading to a continuing tussle across several different areas on Mobius, all of which culminated on Shrine Island where Thrash had escaped, leaving only a drained warp ring behind.

With knowledge of where Team Fighters are heading, thanks to the tracker, Shard informs fellow SFF member, Silver, who, thanks to Harvey Who, now knows the identity of his "traitor", and that he's nearly too late.

   Team Fighters finally caught up with the Death Egg, docked at the
   Egg Bunker
   in the Northern Tundra, where they reunited with the
   Arctic Freedom Fighters
   and formulated a plan to storm the flying fortress. Soon, Silver the Hedgehog had arrived from New Mobotropolis, to the annoyance of Sonic, still ripe with the resentment at the time traveller for his previous accusation, and was about to fly off the handle once again after Silver identified Sally as the traitor, before Tails insisted that he allowed Silver to explain himself first. Based on the research conducted by Harvey Who, Silver explained that Sally's status as a "traitor" was only due to the obscured historical records from his future, and that in reality, Sally's act of treachery was not of her own free will due to being under Eggman's control as a robot, something that only came about due to her selfless act of inverting the world roboticizer on herself. With Silver promising that his objective has now changed, so that he now intends to rescue Sally, Sonic agrees to let him help them. Once the Freedom Fighter teams successfully infiltrate the Death Egg (avoiding an underwater run-in with the Arctic DEL in the process) Eggman dispatches his forces, including Mecha Sally, to deal with the intruders, before setting off to prepare for his latest plan with

   suspects that her new "inanimate friend" may be more than it appears to be, to which she alerted Team Freedom leader Rotor, who agreed that Cream may be onto something.

Realising the jig was up, "Operation: Deadly Cuddles" transformed into its true, monstrous form, it's murderous sights set on the team. Back at the Northern Tundra, Silver proved himself the hero of the hour, paralysing Mecha Sally with his psychokinesis, seconds before the former princess could finish off Team Fighters.

Meanwhile inside Castle Acorn, King Naugus (no longer in possession of Geoffrey St. John, the latter nowhere to be found) watched as the monster caused carnage outside, as he waited for Nicole (confined to her old handheld form) to finish creating a power ring that would restore his powers, which he had apparently lost at some point. Angered by the holo-lynx's snarky attitude, he grabbed her: leading to the corrupted King receiving a jolt that brought back memories of a different world. Spooked, he fled the castle, smashing through a window. In the ensuing mayhem, Tails discovered Nicole's handheld laying in the grass outside, and she appeared to be heavily glitching out. Tails reached towards her to examine her, only to be zapped with a jolt of new memories upon contact. After the duo finally disabled the Tails Doll, by taking of its power gem, Tails informed Sonic of what he's just experienced, finally realizing what Sonic's earlier confusion was about. Upon rescuing King Acorn, the two determined that their best course of action would be to find the other Freedom Fighters.

  <p key="45b14ed6-11a6-464a-80df-bf0e69a6bb2f">
   Sonic the Hedgehog was originally published as a four issue mini-series, with the first issue labeled as "issue 0" and the second as "issue 1" (despite the note on issue 1 that it was the "first issue"). At the end of issue 3 (the fourth issue of the series), it was announced that Sonic would return in a regular series, and the next issue was published as "issue 1" of the regular series.
  </p>
  <p key="808cbc32-86bf-44ef-b387-64a865509bbd">
   In addition to the main Sonic series, Archie Comics published various special issues. Longer than typical issues of the comic, these specials feature stories involving Sonic and other related characters. Several miniseries have also been published, featuring characters such as Sally, Tails and Knuckles.
  </p>
  <p key="32552e27-9f3d-41bb-b2ae-7071034dbba3">
   Because of the popularity of the specials and Miniseries featuring Knuckles, in 1997 Knuckles the Echidna became an ongoing series. Knuckles's stories featured its own cast of Characters, including the Chaotix and Knuckles's romantic interest, Julie-Su. Like the Sonic comic, Knuckles's comic is filled with background information about Knuckles's family history. Knuckles's family has split into two factions: the Brotherhood of Guardians and the Dark Legion. Knuckles is a member of the former, and Julie-Su used to be a member of the latter. Much of the conflict of the comic surrounds the relations between these two warring factions.
  </p>
  <p key="9ed44998-16b2-463f-a132-0b4e011c3c11">
   In 1999, the series was cancelled, but the stories were continued in the pages of Sonic the Hedgehog. After Knuckles's cancellation and until issue 125, a typical issue of Sonic included a Sonic story and a Knuckles story, sometimes even including a third story. This led to each story getting considerably less space than it previously had. Recently, Knuckles's appearances have been infrequent but his story continues within Sonic's stories.

   The creators also have a comic strip similar to those found in a newspaper at the end of some issues called Off-Panel. Off-Panel was in every issue for a long time and continues infrequently in the comic series. The strips parody the lives of the editor and the writers as they walk around the office and interact with characters from the comic in various ways. However, it has recently return in

  <p key="55a5a5ae-419d-40fd-bd35-faa8692b35bd">
   Sonic and other characters from the series have also made guest appearances in other Archie Comics publications. Sonic has appeared in three crossovers with the main Archie Comics cast (all of which are considered non-canon), the most notable of these being his crossover with

    The reason behind the comics reboot in 2013 can be attributed to several issues behind the scenes. One of the biggest, and arguably most infamous reasons, is due to the settlement that resulted from the long-running legal battle between Archie Comics and former Sonic writer Ken Penders, in which he copyrighted several of the characters and concepts he brought to the series, which made up sizeable chunk of the Sonic comic universe. This has rendered said characters and concepts unusable in new stories, making the original continuity impossible to work with since so much of it depended on Penders concepts.

     <li key="c8b35a0a-140c-4bc0-85ac-bd1e40a20e65">
      The reboot came at rather short notice for the comic. Ian Flynn has gone on to state that he had plans for the original continuity for as far as issue 300.
