   Anti Sonic first encountered Sonic the Hedgehog from the prime universe while the latter took a detour through the
   Cosmic Interstate
   . After getting lost along the way, Sonic wound up in the Anti Mobius universe. The two briefly fought one another until Anti Robotnik helped Sonic apprehend his evil self through an assault by the veterinarian's patients. Sonic then continued his trip along the Cosmic Interstate back to Mobius. Later on, Evil Sonic was summoned by
   Robo-Robotnik
   with the task of stopping all of his counterparts from recovering the hand of
   Giant Borg
   from the
   Neutral Zone
   . Evil Sonic gladly accepted the mission, and accomplished it with the aid of an army of
   Shadowbots

Evil Sonic would afterwards return acting as Dr. Robotnik's ally, fooling
   Anti-Knuckles
   into helping him steal the Chaos Emeralds from the Floating Island on Mobius Prime. Though the plan seemed feasible at first, Anti-Knuckles' overall good nature and the aid of the Freedom Fighters enabled Knuckles to trounce Evil Sonic, leaving him in his counterpart's care. (

   Not long after Scourge had escaped Shadow's wrath along with Rouge, a warp ring supplied by Doctor Finitevus led the duo to an unknown location where Finitevus stood asking if they were interested in joining him in his goals. Scourge was quick to oblige so long as it involved harming Sonic in any way, shape or form. Scourge served as Finitevus' right hand man, teaming up with the Destructix on various occasions. His most scathing blow to Sonic and the others came when he revealed that he had become romantically involved with

Fearing that Finitevus' plan might fail, he charged up his Warp Ring with energy from the Master Emerald, and was witness to Finitevus' tirade on how "corrupt" the world had become and his plan to "cleanse" (exterminate) all life in a wave of Emerald fire.

Knowing he had changed since his transformation, Scourge resolved to find answers to who he was now, and left with Fiona through the enhanced Warp Ring, to the places he could find them. Scourge promised Fiona, however, that it would be fun. (

Scourge then proceeded to battle Sonic, and in the midst of the battle, it was hinted he holds some unknown incentive that keeps the Squad loyal to him. Eventually the pitched battle between the two groups led the base dangerously close to collapse, forcing the Freedom Fighters to retreat, leaving Scourge victorious, though his taunting towards Sonic enraged him to the point he vowed to return for revenge.

Scourge was manipulated by Miles into ordering the Suppression Squad to allow himself to battle Metal Sonic, but soon found himself out-matched. Sonic saved him at the last second, and offered another temporary truce. Scourge told Sonic to save his sympathy, as he was happy to bust two Sonic heads. Metal Sonic felt the same way, and Sonic found himself battling both. During the fight, Scourge offered Sonic the chance to conquer Mobius himself, and then, together, take over the Multiverse. Sonic barely stuttered in response. Soon, Eggman dispatched reinforcements to deal with both hedgehogs in the form of

Sonic asked Scourge to reconsider a truce, but instead Scourge pointed out Sonic hadn't answered his question about conquering Mobius and then the Multiverse. Sonic didn't refuse, as such, instead insisting he was too preoccupied with the present right now. Grinning evilly, Scourge took that as a "yes". As the battle amplified, Scourge's temper began to flare, refusing to give the robotic duplicates any ground when the battle began damaging Freedom HQ. Scourge also insisted to Fiona that he could handle them, when she asked if she and the Squad should step in. In the end, however, he broke down and asked the Squad for help, leading to Metal Sonic and Metal Scourge's destruction.

Angry at Scourge for constantly abusing them, they attacked him alongside the Freedom Fighters. At first, Scourge and Fiona were getting the upper hand against both teams, but Sonic returned from his trip to Moebius and attacked Scourge.

Super Scourge then proceeded to defeat the combined might of the Knothole Freedom Fighters and Suppression Squad (minus Rotor and Fiona), who had returned to Moebius expecting Scourge to be defeated. While he seemed to be unbeatable, Sonic eventually realized the Anarchy Beryl would have a different (and negative) effect on Scourge to contrast the positive effect the Chaos Emeralds had on him once the transformation ended. Luring Super Scourge away from the others, Sonic managed to stall for time until Super Scourge reverted to his normal form. As Sonic speculated, the Anarchy Beryl drained him of what energy he had left in his normal form, leaving him vulnerable. Sonic subsequently defeated Scourge and captured him. (

   Scourge, when simply known as Evil Sonic, was essentially a doppelganger and so was identical to Sonic save for his attire, which consisted of a black leather jacket, boots and dark sunglasses. He occasionally passed himself off as Sonic by stealing and wearing the heroic hedgehog's shoes.
  </p>
  <p key="5afa9a0f-da20-4eb3-9715-e56512a31f8a">
   The character, however, was heavily reinvented so as to become more distinct; artist Patrick Spaziante provided the visual design. While Sonic is blue with green eyes, Scourge is the opposite. His ears also appear to be more angular than Sonic's. His leather jacket gained flame designs on the arms and his shoes are green, silver and black. He now sports red sunglasses and two large scars on his abdomen that Locke scarred him with. He also gained an exaggerated pointy-toothed grin. His fur varies somewhat between colorists, going from a bright green to a darker pine shade. The character has sometimes been depicted with fingerless gloves, but the standard white gloves are more common.

  <p key="5a3e93c6-2ba5-4f38-b380-4c2bc992a260">
   For a time, Scourge wore a crown of sorts; a three-spiked, grooved dark piece that rested on his forehead. While a Data-File initially mentioned a potential "golden" Super form, artist Tracy Yardley and writer Ian Flynn came up with multiple alternate design concepts; the final included an unusual Super form with purple fur, red eyes on black, and partially inverted colors on his clothing (purple shoes, blue sunglasses and blue flames on the jacket).

   Following his imprisonment he retains his usual green sneakers, but has been forced to wear an orange jumpsuit, and his spikes have been cut short; further distancing him from Sonic's appearance, who still possesses long spikes.

   Scourge is at his core similar to Sonic, but often these shared traits are twisted and amplified. Scourge shares his counterpart's ego, but lacks any sense of humility or modesty, making him extremely arrogant and conceited. He is also void of compassion and conscience. He's relatively easy-going but also petty and cruel, often taking satisfaction and amusement at the expense of others, and can also be immature and lazy. Where the fun-loving Sonic has a sense of duty, Scourge cares only for his own amusement. Often loud and obnoxious, he's shallow in terms of relationships, often playing with the affections of any number of girls, and his companions only stick together out of self-benefit or fear. After his transformation, his arrogance only increased.
  </p>
  <p key="1f905184-4ec0-47c3-aef2-4ad753adaaec">
   Misinterpreting Sonic's words, he eventually became fixated on becoming more than just an "Evil Sonic," becoming aware of his own incredible potential but deciding to apply it in negative, self-serving ways. He believes greatly in his own power and often brags or takes any opportunity to prove himself better than others, which in his mind means "stronger." Because he is also rash and impatient, he occasionally gets in over his head, his ego leading him to poor decisions. He hates the idea of having to rely on others and prefers to control and dominate through fear and intimidation. He is easily provoked and highly violent, especially when his ability is called into question.
  </p>
  <p key="c4dab9a7-a9dd-4163-973d-3c09ac30962c">
   After of his imprisonment however, Scourge had become a shadow of his former self. As his control collar had rendered him weak and almost defenseless, he became scared and paranoid. He allowed himself to be constantly physically abused in prison because he could not defend himself. He became enraged and panicked due to the fact the Destructix made it appear he was forming a gang and the only time he fought was when King Maxx told his goons to kill him. Despite all of this, Fiona was able to pull Scourge out of his funk and helped him to begin to plot his escape. He quickly regained his old arrogance, and a determination to follow his own path and prove himself the most powerful being in the multiverse.

   Scourge is a version of Sonic from an alternate universe and so his abilities are essentially the same as Sonic's. The hedgehogs can achieve the same speed and both can perform feats such as spin dashes.

   Following his transformation, Scourge seems to have acquired even greater strength and stamina than he had previously, as seen in #161, where he single-handedly defeats Sonic and Shadow at the same time. Scourge can also teleport using Chaos Control, though he requires an emerald to do so. Scourge is also capable of transforming into a
   Super form
   like Sonic's, but Scourge's changes in appearance are, predictably, the Anti-equivalent of Super Sonic's: his fur becomes a dark purple, the whites of his eyes become black, and his irises become red. His clothes take on a similar color reversal, with his sunglasses becoming clear with blue frames, his shoes becoming purple and black, and the flames on his jacket becoming blue and white. (

   Where Sonic is polite and respectful towards women (most of the time), Evil Sonic/Scourge is the complete opposite. He is the very definition of a womanizer, much in the opposite of Sonic's gentlemanly disposition. Unfortunately for him, Anti-Mobius was too harsh a world for such behavior; Anti-Sally broke up with him after he suffered multiple defeats, while Anti-Bunnie actually joined the Anti-Freedom Fighters out of vengeance, having been dating Scourge only to discover that he was also dating several other women at the same time (among them Anti-Penelope Platypus).
  </p>
  <p key="dcc3e078-5ca3-440a-9271-4142004fc3a2">
   Evil Sonic found things easier during his brief switch of identities with Sonic Prime. On Mobius Prime, he once again had multiple relationships at the same time, using his identical appearance with Sonic to take advantage of nearly every female character in the cast. Unfortunately, he found easy prey in the form of Sonic's crushing fangirl Amy Rose and the emotionally distraught Bunnie Rabbot, who was still upset over her apparent breakup with Antoine (engineered by Evil Sonic himself). Scourge also appears to have begun a relationship with Fiona Fox, who appears to have known all along that he was an imposter; unfortunately, she ended up falling for Scourge, and became more and more sinister as a result.
  </p>
  <p key="b5fa2bb7-14d8-4f77-afa0-82feee6b6522">
   Unlearned lessons repeated themselves, and Sonic's return prompted Scourge's exposure, forcing him to flee. His actions while impersonating Sonic left something of a mix-up between his heroic counterpart and the women he flirted with, though Sonic appears to have resolved this. Forced to flee, Evil Sonic was quickly drawn by Rouge the Bat, who not only had similar designs on the Master Emerald to his own, but who was also physically appealing to him. Rouge also appears to have flirted with him, though likely only to gain his help. Whatever relationship might have been between them was reduced to strictly business after he transformed into Scourge and she broke up their partnership.
  </p>
  <p key="d0b92fcc-426e-442c-b250-8df803ddbe23">
   Fiona later revealed that she liked Scourge all along, rather than Sonic. It's rather unlike Scourge to actually like someone, but it seems he is interested in Fiona for more than just the purpose of messing with Sonic. He has stated that, unlike the girls from his home zone who are "dark from the get-go", Fiona chooses to be evil- and Scourge thinks that is 'hot'. Later on when the Suppression Squad riots against him, Fiona flees to gain backup. After arriving in Zone Prison, she attempts to help him escape, and renews his confidence.

    Jet the Hawk

    Scourge is one of five characters in the series to be seen cursing (in this case, exclaiming a swear word which is changed to a bunch of random symbols, due to it being a kids comic). The only other characters known to do this is Nack the Weasel,
    Monk
    , Dr. Eggman and Sonic himself.

   <li key="016ccd40-7b9b-4240-95b2-4677472094c7">
    From the comic "Father and Son" it is shown that Scourge may have some guilt of what he's done in the past, and that he shows great jealously that he doesn't want to admit towards Sonic's relationship with his parents (more importantly his dad - Jules the Hedgehog).

   <li key="87c7f52f-4e51-419f-b228-280bd247bb74">
    As Scourge never spent a year in space like Sonic did, this would mean that Scourge is effectively physically older than Sonic by a year. This has never been confirmed however.
