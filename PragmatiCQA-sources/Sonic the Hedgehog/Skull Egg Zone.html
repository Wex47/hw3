   , in order for the two to meet and work on their plans to take over both of their worlds. To help them with this, they created the zone outside of the normal laws of space and time. This allowed them to accomplish hours worth of work in the zone while mere seconds passed in their home world. Additionally, they could use the zone's properties to create or recreate things-most notably robots-from their home zones such as the

The name of the zone came as a compromise: Wily wanted to call it the "Skull Secret Zone", while Eggman wanted to dub it the "Egg Pocket Zone." From within the zone, the two doctors continued their efforts to achieve dominion over both their universes, starting by kidnapping several of
