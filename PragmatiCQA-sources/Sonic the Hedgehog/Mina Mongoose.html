Mina finally agreed to leave with the group. (

   As Sonic's parents were also roboticized, Mina felt he was someone she could relate to, but still continued to feel lonely and even considered allowing herself to be
   roboticized
   if only to be with her mother. Confused and wishing she'd be caught and brought before Robotnik to get answers for his actions, she headed into the Great Forest again, only to be confronted by Sonic once more. While arguing over what each was doing there, they were attacked by a group of

   During the fight, Mina was caught only to be saved by Sonic a second time, but at the cost of losing the sword, and having her rescuer knocked unconscious. In the end, Mina got Sonic to safety when she discovered she had enhanced speed, which she attributed to her being a mongoose (a naturally quick creature), and allowed Sonic to recover before pursuing the Combots. While Sonic went after the sword, Mina stayed behind and ran into

They became close friends and began hanging out more with due to attending the high school that had been built as part of turning Knothole into a true city, though some, like Bunnie, didn't seem to appreciate Mina's advances on Sonic. With the discovery of Mina’s super speed, she and Sonic spent even more time together as he tried to improve her control at her request. After hearing him say she potential for being a
   Freedom Fighter
   , Mina attempted to kiss Sonic in thanks and was surprised by his shock and confusion. This also started an awkward period for Sonic’s relationship with

   Even though she knew she had strong feelings for Sonic, Mina found keeping up with him to be confusing and frustrating not only due to his speed but also from his personality. At one point she was approached by Sally and took the opportunity ask the Princess how she dealt with him (much to her surprise). Sally’s explanation that she was still trying to figure him out herself made it dawn on them they had more in common than they thought and Mina felt more encouraged to keep trying from her words. Deciding she'd taken the wrong approach, she asked her mother for advice, which through a slight misunderstanding of how Isabella met her
   father
   , resulted in her trying to catch Sonic's eye by donning a fancy outfit. While impressed, he soon left afterward on a mission, frustrating the mongoose. (

   Eventually she decided to become a Freedom Fighter herself, so as to spend more time with Sonic. While her mother was wary of this reasoning, Mina began training in various aspects with the core Freedom Fighters. However, when a
   giant robot
   sent by Eggman attacked, Mina attempted to save Sasha, Rory and Snaggle, only to be overwhelmed by panic; she froze in place. Having only been saved by Rotor's timely disabling of the machine, Mina realized that her priorities had been skewed; she had not joined the Freedom Fighters with the intent of defending others, only to impress Sonic. Mina then decided to resign from the Freedom Fighters, but finally caught Sonic’s attention with a skill even she didn’t expect—her voice. Mina proved to have quite a natural singing talent that impressed Sonic so much that he volunteered her to put on a stage performance with a local band called the
   Knothole Knuts
   to bolster her confidence. The plan worked and Mina came to enjoy her new-found voice so much that she started becoming quite popular with Knothole’s residents as a local celebrity, even catching Princess Sally’s attention. (

   Despite this, she still occasionally aided in missions, and with her priorities in order, became more efficient. When Sally was kidnapped by Nack the Weasel, Mina followed Sonic in an attempt to help out, and the two entered the weasel's hideout separately. Sonic found Sally first, and the two kissed. Mina walked in at that moment and realized that Sonic truly loved Sally. Extremely heartbroken, she turned away, only to notice Nack aiming at Sally with a gun. Using her speed, Mina rushed in to intercept the bullet, thinking to save Sally for Sonic's sake. As she collapsed in Sonic's arms, she told him she loved him. When she later awoke in hospital, Sally asked if she'd be okay. Tearfully thinking of her heartbreak, Mina replied that she'd get over it. Though still dealing with this hardship, Mina was able to recover by the time the

   During Sonic's year in space, when he was thought to be dead, Mina continued working with the Knothole Knuts as their lead singer and key figure, which caused her popularity to soar to pop-star status. She began to throw concerts to support the troops and became romantically involved with her manager,
   Ash Mongoose
   . Recognizing Ash's troubled past, which led to him finding comfort in her music, Mina was able to find and awaken his more sensitive nature. When Sonic finally returned from outer space, Mina was quick to introduce Ash to him, who informed the hedgehog that he was dating Mina, knowing of her past crush on him. Despite repeated efforts by Mina to get him to realize Sonic was in the past and that he had no reason to be insecure, Ash remained antagonistic towards Sonic with the two of them egging each other on at the slightest provocation.(

   Warp Rings
   , many had still been left behind. Feeling she needed to take a break from the city, she and Ash headed to Freedom HQ where Sonic told her she could stay as long as she needed since she had still been a Freedom Fighter at one point. As Ash tried to comfort her, she burst into tears-reiterating her fears of the city, NICOLE herself, and how she felt frustrated that the Freedom Fighters seemed unaware of the potential danger should the A.I. lose control again. As they talked, Ash suggested that Mina use her music to send a message to New Mobotropolis populace as a whole. Mina eagerly took to this idea, feeling that she had wanted a good opportunity to try a new direction for a while, and began to work on a new album. Later, the band met at Mina's house, not too happy with the mood change proposed in the new songs. However, Mina explained to them even their instruments were made of nanites and if Nicole would be compromised again, the very house could prove a threat. This convinced the others, and they began rehearsing for their next concert. (

   Right before the show three weeks later, Mina hyped up the other band members backstage, confidently telling them they were making a difference. Despite this, Mina admitted she felt she was about to throw up, though Ash assured her the people loved her music as much as herself, encouraging her to get out there and "blow them away." Once onstage, Mina met the roaring crowd with a strong, passionate performance, expressing a desire to live without fear and for the people to be able to "save themselves" when the heroes couldn't. After roaring applause, Mina thanked the crowd for their passion and motivation. While she rallied a call against fear and a cry for change, Mina explained it was up to the people to take care of things inside the city while the Freedom Fighters were busy protecting them from outside forces.

   After the concert, Mina made her way through the fans to the band's trailer with Ash, and found to their surprise Sonic and Sally waiting inside. The conversation quickly turned tense as Mina tried to explain to Sonic that she felt her message was one that needed to be heard—especially by him and the other Freedom Fighters. Concerned, Sally told Mina that she had to be careful with the influence of her popularity, but when she mentioned responsibilities, Mina heatedly retorted she felt Sally and the others were being irresponsible, citing Nicole's continued control of the entire city despite what had happened with the Iron Dominion. Growing angry, Mina pointed out they hadn't even been in the city during the occupation, and that while they were "talking politics" on the

   when they were gone, and done all she could to protect people without giving herself away while witnessing all the Legionization.

   In the time following the concert, Mina began to see an undesired effect of her new message. During dinner with Ash at
   Creme de la Creme
   one evening, she saw Sonic and Sally arrive on a date, but the atmosphere was spoiled as a waiter began to pester them over the issue of NICOLE, which soon lead to staff and patrons loudly bickering over the entire issue. Mina suddenly decided that she wanted to leave, saying she couldn't enjoy the meal with "that" going on in the background. The two left, Mina mumbling that this wasn't what she wanted her music to create. It was for this reason that Mina decided to hold a free concert in front of the community center in order to get the public to relax. While she hoped to lighten the mood she had created, her efforts were ruined when

   Preying off the artificially increased fear of NICOLE brought about by Mina's concert, Naugus succeeded in winning over the public and becoming king. Mina attended Geoffrey St. John's trial, where he was declared guilty of treason but immediately pardoned by the new king. Her unease towards the situation continued to grow from this as well as the loss of Princess Sally, and when public opinion eventually resulted in NICOLE's exile, Mina felt guilty; she had wanted to raise awareness concerning possible problems with NICOLE, but never intended for fear to take over the city. Eventually, despite her own concerns, she built up the courage to confront NICOLE directly. She became distressed upon seeing NICOLE's pain firsthand, and spoke of her own fears and failings, admitting that she hadn't fully understood NICOLE's situation in the path. With a lot of encouragement, Mina eventually convinced NICOLE to stop hiding from her problems, and begged for her forgiveness. She told NICOLE that she could count on her as a friend, and swore to attain her original goal of inspiring the people and set them on the right path. (

   Initially, Mina was depicted as shy and lacking in confidence. She was often somewhat depressed, as she had recently lost her mother to roboticization, and at a time considered letting herself be captured and roboticized so as to at least be with her. Eventually as she settled in Knothole, she became more cheerful, making friends and helping take care of a trio of orphans, and when her mother's free will was restored, Mina's mood improved greatly. As she developed a crush on Sonic, she remained shy but began to expand her abilities and become a bit more outgoing, hoping only to impress him, but eventually realized her methods were misguided. When it comes to love, she's passionate but somewhat conflicted and oblivious. She was unaware of the relationship between Sonic and Sally and, upon realizing their feelings for each other, suffered tremendous heartbreak. Deep down Mina is rather brave, having repeatedly put herself in danger for the sake of others, though she doesn't always handle pressure well. Despite her emotional hardships, Mina's confidence grew as her musical ability became apparent, and she developed into a happy, highly energetic individual with a heroic heart, using her singing talents to inspire hope, confidence and improved morale to the masses. Due to what happened during the Iron Dominion's invasion, Mina is currently suffering from
   PTSD
   , causing her to experience frequent nightmares.

   Mina has yellow fur and long, wavy lilac hair. Her eyes are green (though they’ve occasionally been miscolored blue). Created as a potential love interest for Sonic, she was designed by artist Patrick Spaziante specifically with a more SegaSonic-style in mind. In her basic design, Mina wears a simple black tank top, brown shorts, a black (sometimes green) hairband, and large green/teal boots and gauntlets/gloves. Her ears have several piercings and are usually adorned with silver hoops.

   's boots. She wears a black and purple tank top with matching pants/leggings; the latter were later replaced by a pleated skirt. She's occasionally been depicted in a more formal outfit designed by artist Jeff Axer; a red qipao patterned with a green dragon, long black gloves, ornamental hair pins and ornate gold jewelry, including gold hoop earrings with green tassels. On a single cover Mina was depicted in a typical Japanese sailor-style school uniform of white and purple with a pale teal backpack and white and pink sneakers. She once had a bright pink rain jacket. She was also shown wearing simple pale teal or yellow pajamas. Artist Dawn Best added a green star to Mina’s hairband. An unused redesign, also by Jeff Axer, featured capris, hi-top sneakers, puppy-themed socks and an artfully-torn sweatshirt with “Sonic” printed on the front.
