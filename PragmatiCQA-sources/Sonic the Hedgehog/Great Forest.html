   The Great Forest developed many centuries before Mobius' modern era, and many of its trees grew to be extremely large and long-lived. Within its bounds there existed a number of limestone caverns, many of which were later exposed by erosion to become the Great Valley, a large area hidden from view by the forest. The valley became the site of
