   With a longevity almost as impressive as that of the Guardians, Archimedes' ancestors had watched over and guided young Guardians as they sought their powers down through the centuries, beginning with Christopheles and
   Steppenwolf
   . Archy first took part in this practice to train
   Sabre
   , the son of

   , after Athair refused to return to Angel Island to resume his forsaken post as Guardian after the death of his mother
   Janelle-Li
   . This change was referenced to by Archy himself, who once commented to Locke-Sabre's son-that even his father, Semper Fidelis, had had trouble dealing with Athair. At any rate, Archimedes trained Sabre and then Locke, before years later taking on the role of instructing Locke's son and the most powerful Guardian yet by far, Knuckles. (

   In the beginning, following a pattern set forth by his ancestors, Archy played games with Knuckles' mind, leaving obscure clues to his existence such as his name burned into a rock. Eventually, Archy "abducted" Knuckles' friends, the

   Grand Conservatory
   of the Echidnas. There Archy revealed himself for the first time, telling Knuckles a part of the history between their two families. At that moment, Enerjak emerged from beneath the ruins of
   Mount Fate
   , swooping down on the Grand Conservatory to capture the Chaotix and banish Archy and Knuckles to
   Sandopolis
   , a vast desert region of Angel Island. Working together to overcome the obstacles in their path, they made their way to Enerjak's newly recreated city of
   Nekronopolis
   . Engaging the brainwashed Chaotix in battle, they defeated them and faced Enerjak. Locke intervened secretly at this point, sending Enerjak into outer space and temporarily ending his threat. (

   Archimedes is known for being rather opinionated, and doesn't like to waste time by being round about. He does his best to encourage his students, past and present, and isn't shy about telling them what they're doing wrong. Despite this, he cares deeply for them, particularly Knuckles, whom he often felt guilty towards for not revealing the secret of his father's continued existence. Concerned with the greater good, Archy is not above leaving his students to suffer through whatever lessons they have to learn themselves, and can be extremely blunt in his methods. No matter what the situation, though, he always stands by his friends. He has also shown sorrow in the knowledge that every Guardian he has tutored has come to face horrible trouble in recent years.

   Like all Fire Ants—at least of the line of Christopheles—Archy can breathe fire and teleport, as well as communicating with others telepathically. He can also transport others, though he must be in physical contact for this to work. A master of sleight-of-hand and various magic tricks, he often emphasizes his appearances and disappearances with puffs of smoke. He is well versed in the lore of the Guardians, teaching Knuckles and others the martial and spiritual skills needed to utilize their abilities to their fullest. He also can possibly heat up his body, as shown when Knuckles tried to eat him. Knuckles spit him out, due to Archimedes being to hot for Knuckles to eat. To which, after being spit out, he told Knuckles to "Not do that again!".
