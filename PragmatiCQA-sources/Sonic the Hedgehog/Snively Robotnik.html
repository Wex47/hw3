   Colin Jr. had a difficult upbringing ever since his birth. His mother died while giving birth to him, leaving him to be raised by a father with no parenting skills. Every friend he made as a young boy he lost, having found some reason to betray them to gain an advantage out of the relationship. As he got older, Young Colin developed an interest in technology and mechanics, finding himself using electronics far more than socializing. (

Upon their return to the planet, Snively went with the Freedom Fighters and helped to plant a computer virus in the computer systems so that Robo-Robotnik could not access the location of Knothole. After this, Snively and the Freedom Fighters went their seperate ways. (

He was placed in a jail cell for some time, only to receive a visit from Robo-Robotnik (now referred to as Dr. Eggman), who offered him a job and revenge on his father, which Snively eagerly accepted.

   Snively increasingly became disillusioned with Eggman Empire following the destruction of its capital city by Enerjak. With recent failures mounting, Eggman's verbal abuse against Snively continued to rise. This combined with the lack of respect shown by the Dark Egg Legion caused Snively to question his future in the Eggman Empire. Upon one of his routine check-ups over the

Following this, Dimitri explained how he'd discovered Snively's relationship with Regina and their treasonous plots, and that if Snively did not prioritize helping to protect the Dark Egg Legion he would expose this to Eggman.

Snively then explained Regina had given it to him as a gift, and the scent was particular to her region of the world. When Lien-Da stated she didn't know how he could stand the smell, Snively grudgingly stated it was something the "animals" could never understand. After telling Lien-Da to order the Dark Egg Legion to hold back the Freedom Fighters until Sonic was locked in a chamber with Eggman, he told Dimitri to wait for him on the landing pad of the Eggdome. Snively remained behind, content to watch as his uncle was defeated and the Eggman Empire collapse. (

   Soon after, Snively joined the Iron Queen in attacking New Mobotropolis while riding in Eggmobiles. Then the Iron Queen took control of

   and destroy it, allowing the Iron Queen to take control of Khan. After Sonic returned, Snively destroyed the Power Ring while the Iron Queen used Monkey Khan to fight Sonic. Although it entertained Snively, Sonic managed to get a new power ring for the simian and Regina told Snively it was time to go back to New Metropolis. While confused at first, Regina told him that it was enough victory that the others had lost faith in Khan. Soon after, Snively went to gloat in his uncle's face, before realizing he had escaped. After Snively called the Dark Legion and the Yagyu Ninja he bumped into the Iron King. After he was insulted by him and questioned on what was wrong, Snively told him Eggman had escaped. At first, the Iron King believed Snively to be betraying him, however Snively tried to explain the situation before they both heard a "thoom" and were there to witness Eggman's escape in the
   Egg-Tortoise
   . He then ran off to inform the Iron Queen. After she barked out for what to do, Snively told her her pod was prepared, hoping for some affection but getting only a cold shoulder in return.(

   Snively later participated in the search for Dr. Eggman along with a fraction of the Iron Dominion's army. He then watched with a hint of jealousy as the queen complimented the Iron King for subduing Sonic. However, the celebrations were cut short by the arrival of Sally and several Freedom Fighters. After a brief fight, he went after the dominion who was in pursuit of the Freedom Fighters. After catching up with them, he found them in retreat, having failed to penetrate the shield in New Mobotropolis. Later that night, Snively went to Regina's chambers to try to comfort her, but she coldly informed him he better find a way past the shields or he would never be allowed in her chambers again before slamming the door on him. When the Iron King failed to breach

The Iron King then explained to Snively about their take over of the Dragon Kingdom, that she became more harsh as time went on. He then lashed out on Snively since instead of cementing their control of the Dragon Kingdom, they came here and vented his fustration at Snively. Once he left to meditate, Snively muttered behind his back on how he'll become the Iron King when Regina rules the world and that Jun will be hamburger.(

   Nervously approaching Regina, he tried to sweet talk her in a good mood. She told him he had thirty seconds before she'd imprison him just like his uncle, so he quickly used the opportunity to explain that he'd found a solution to their problem concerning New Mobotropolis. Showing her holographic displays of the former nanite city, now New Mobotropolis, he explained that the entire city was made of nanites controlled by an AI (NICOLE) and thus should be directly vulnerable to her technomagic. Regina swooped in and swung him around happily, her mood immediately improved. Once they arrived at the outskirts of New Mobotropolis, he graciously helped her out of her craft, an action which Jun Kun found to overstep the boundaries of a mere steward, and stood by with the combined Dark Egg Legion and Yagyu Clan, watching as Regina confronted and overwhelmed NICOLE with her powers. As NICOLE allowed their forces access to the city, Snively made his way to the Detention Center to look in on his less-than-lucid uncle. Finding Dr. Eggman still in a state of delirium and unable to discern what period of his life he was in, Snively broke into a tyrade about how after everything his uncle did to him he was in charge now and the world would soon fall to him and Regina, giving him everything he ever wanted. To this, Eggman's reply was nothing more than the wonderment of how Snively had almost no hair left, effectively killing the mood. Later, Snively became puzzled when the Iron Queen started ranting to herself while staring into her staff, and when he enquired what she was doing, he was told to go away, and Lien-Da made it her business to tease him about it before giving in a status report.

   Soon after this, Snively was summoned by the insane Eggman while he was with Lien-Da. She asked why he even bothered to visit the rambling maniac, and he explained that he enjoyed seeing him as he now was. He then walked into New Mobotropolis's Detention Center, saying it was good to feel ten feet tall around his uncle. But he received the shock of his life when Eggman had revealed he'd become sane again. Eggman declared that he had finally figured out why he couldn't defeat Sonic, and told Snively to release him so his plans could start anew. However Snively laughed in his face, saying he was now in the top spot and had found love with Regina. Realizing he meant Regina Ferrum, Eggman had his turn to laugh, saying she was a manipulator who was only using Snively, and that Snively himself could never love anyone since all he cared for was himself. This brought Snively to tears, denying these accusations before storming off and telling his uncle to rot in jail. All Eggman did was laugh and say Snively would be back. Snively still pondered these words as he made ready to
   Legionize
   Rotor Walrus, who resisted momentarily before his back gave out on him, which was fortunate for Snively as the ex-Freedom Fighter was focused on him. Amy, Antoine and Geoffrey St. John then stormed the coliseum, breaking Snively's operation table. After a heated brawl between foes, Sonic, Sally, Monkey Khan and Tails stormed the city in the

In the midst of all this, Snively came face-to-face with Sally, who was more than a little disappointed with him at wasting all the chances she'd given him. Snively retorted that there were three other
   Clans
   in the Dragon Kingdom just waiting for the order to come to the city and help, but that went out the window when Monkey Khan revealed to the
   Yagyu Clan
   that their ties to the Iron Dominion were severed. With no one backing the Iron Queen, Lien-Da thought this was the perfect opportunity to seize power, but the Iron Queen used her Magitek powers to set off the bomb in her cybernetics. With no one leading them, the Dark Egg Legion demanded Snively to give them orders, but Snively was too overwhelmed by it all and ran for a hovercraft to free Eggman so he could fix everything, his panic intensified when he saw the Iron King get blasted through the city's dome. When he arrived at the Detention Center, Eggman was all smiles and mockingly asked about saving Regina. Snively said there was no time and pleaded for Eggman to save him. They went back to the pod and flew out of the city, and when Snively calmed down, he asked if they could go back and get Regina, but Eggman refused. (

   For the next week they remained hidden in the Eggdome's lower levels with the Dark Egg Legion back under their control since they saved Lien-Da by hospitalizing her. Snively continued to plead with Eggman to go to the Dragon Kingdom and rescue Regina, but he refused to waste his time and efforts. Snively then enquired about why they bothered to help the treacherous Lien-Da, but Eggman said it was for the same reason he kept around Snively himself; because it was more fun that way. He then pushed his finger down on Snively's nose so it sprung like a diving board and ordered him back to work while Sonic and Tails kept searching for them. (

   Later, Eggman and Snively used all the energy to the energy in Robotropolis to power a portal to the special zone in order to retrieve a Chaos Emerald from Feist. Feist made Eggman and Snively race each other for an emerald. Snively intended to win, abandon Eggman, take over the Eggman Empire and rescue someone not specified. Snively took the lead near the end, but Eggman shot him with a missile and took the emerald. Feist made Eggman choose between the emerald and Snively, which Eggman took the former without hesistation. Eggman left with the emerald, leaving the frighten Snively with Feist, but Eggman pushed a button that teleported Snively back to the EggDome. Eggman told dazzled Snively to quit lying around and it time to get the show on the road. (

The next day Dr. Eggman taunted and gloated at Snively (who had been imprisoned in a prison pod) and informed him that Regina was now in control of the Dark Egg Legion in Central City with an infiltrator of Snively beside her.

   Snively is a short Overlander, the size of most Mobians. He's mostly bald except for the individual hairs on the center of his skull that reach down to the back of his head. A total of 5 hairs (It should be noted though that in the begining of the series Snively had about 19 to 13 hairs on his head) however during the take over of Mobotropolis Snively originally had a full head of dirty blond hair. His most distinguishing feature, however is his long beak-like nose. As a running gag it is sometimes poked by Dr. Robotnik/Dr. Eggman and comically straightens out like a springboard.
  </p>
  <p key="80188c35-d39f-409b-a3a0-1b000385bf4c">
   Snively originally wore a blue sweater-like shirt with red pants and blue shoes. At the beginning of the Second Robotnik War, Snively's outfit was the same except for the colors. His shirt was now green, his pants tan-ish and his shoes brown. In his brief robotization he became metallic gray and his irisis turned orange-red. After his destruction, reconstruction, and Deroboticization, Snively is now more streamlined and leaner then before and now has five fingers instead of four like most Overlanders. Snively's current outfit greatly resembles Dr. Eggman's - minus the buttons. The color is different as well - being green instead of red. During the First Genesis Wave Snively got back his original appearance but still retained his five fingers.

   Quite possibly the best way to describe Snively is "devious". He is bitter, passive-aggressive, and self-serving (even when serving others). He has a deeply rooted resentment for those around him, and for many years only trusted his uncle, Julian. Since the coup, however, he has since closed himself off to anyone and anything other than his own personal gain. Snively spends a large portion of his time swallowing his pride in the face of humiliation and repressing the rage instilled in him. This leads him to occasionally snap in the form of physical tantrums or infuriated screaming (usually the phrase "I HATE YOU!"). These outbursts are rare, however, as muttering his grievances below his breath is much safer.
  </p>
  <p key="073a7b17-513b-4f02-b01d-06396b1bb0fd">
   During the times Snively is actually given an inch of independence, he tends to be very cold and calculating, and in the even rarer instances that he has power, he can be downright sadistic. He takes great pleasure in the pain and misfortune of those around him — especially those that are particularly hated, such as Dr. Robotnik/Dr. Eggman or Sonic The Hedgehog. Even when forming what appears to be an alliance, Snively never fully puts trust in anyone, and in fact is usually plotting a back-up betrayal plan in the back of his mind.
  </p>
  <p key="dfd9124b-3e33-4144-b8e8-159e73d0cb86">
   However, it would appear that Snively is not completely heartless, and appears to care for his half-sister Hope to some extent; during the destruction of Knothole, Snively persuaded Hope to escape to Station Square prior to the attack, and was reduced to tears when Hope expressed her shame towards him and her intent to redeem their family name.

   Snively was Dr. Robotnik's lackey and nephew and dealt with his uncle's abuse for ten years before killing him. After being kicked out by his father (due to Snively's treacherous nature) Snively went to the only person he felt he could trust Julian Kintobor, who would later on be known as Dr. Ivo Robotnik. For many years Snively only trusted his uncle and even showed sadness when he though Dr. Robotnik was killed by his renegade robot E.V.E. However during the last year of Dr. Robotniks reign Snively slowly grew to detest his uncle due to the constant abuse he received by him and his constant failing plans that were thwarted by the Knotehole Freedom Fighters. Snively would mutter to himself, often insulting Dr. Robotnik behind his back, and is responsible for some of Dr. Robotnik's plans being defeated by the Freedom Fighters, such as the time he purposely damaged the two way communication system so the Freedom Fighters can here Robotnik's plan to invade Flicky Island. During Operation EndGame,
(Which was Dr. Robotnik's final attempted to destroy his enemies) Snively had reprogrammed the Ultimate Annihilator to target only Dr. Robotnik's DNA signature erasing him from existence.

  <p key="8b5a4176-0752-412f-85fd-091ba20c6a09">
   It has been shown that Snively hated Eggman far more than even the original Robotnik. He was often annoyed when Eggman enacted plans that made little to no sense or ignored blatantly obvious solutions such as allowing Sonic to be destroyed by the Krudzu Hybrid Hydra. Eggman's arrogant decision to withdraw after Metal Sonic had knocked out Antoine--an action the Doctor would indeed later regret--finally pushed Snively over the edge, prompting him to turn against Eggman once and for all, even going so far as to try and kill him.

  <p key="259c63c9-1e98-4d56-a3cc-5fcc850d31db">
   During the time Mobius was reset by the first Genesis Wave, however, Snively instead idolised Eggman in the same way as he used to to idolise the original Robotnik, to the point that he would snap angrily at anyone who spoke ill of him.

   Snively found love with a Sub-boss by the name of Regina Ferrum during a routine surveillance check. The two corresponded with each other via the Egg Network and became close, even sending each other gifts. As Dr. Eggman increasingly lost his sanity, Snively planned to overthrow his uncle and rule the Eggman Empire with Regina. After Regina arrived in the ruins of New Megaopolis, the two were able to develop their relationship a bit, showing signs of affection when they were alone together, and sharing their life stories with one another in private.

   The relationship between two appeared to become strained however when Dr. Eggman escaped from the Eggdome and was then taken into custody of the Republic of Acorn, Sonic and the Knothole Freedom Fighters foiling the Iron Dominion's efforts to recapture him as well as take Sonic as a hostage. Following this defeat, Snively was seen visiting Regina's chambers only for her to coldly tell him that if he wished to enter her chambers again he would find a way to disable the shields over New Mobotropolis, then slamming the door in his face. They eventually reconciled after Snively found a solution to New Mobotropolis' shields. Once Eggman recoverd his sanity, Snively explained he would not return to him, stating that Regina respected him and that he found love. Eggman retorted that he was not in love because he could not love and that he was simply using Regina for his own personal gain, thus causing Snively to leave with tears in his eyes. Following the dissolution of the Iron Dominion and the betrayal of the Dark Egg Legion, Snively seemingly abandoned Regina to free Eggman just to save himself. While fleeing back to the Eggdome, Snively did express some hope of rescuing Regina during the confusion and the days that followed, indicating that he still had some devotion to her. (

   Eventually Snively demonstrated that he still cared for Regina to an extensive degree, going to the point of fleeing the Eggman Empire and rescuing her. Of course, some selfish motivation was evident, as Regina was a necessary ally in his continued rivalry with Robotnik. However, his feelings were eventually shown to be genuine, as he persisted in his efforts to rescue and reconcile with her even after she initially rejected him. Eggman evidently recognized this, to the point of replacing Snively with an Infiltrator and informing him of the fact after his imprisonment in order to make his defeat that much crueler.

    ), wearing an all white outfit. After this, Snively was almost always seen wearing a blue top and brown pants, as opposed to his SatAM counterpart, who always wore green. Despite Snively's introduction to the series relatively early on, the badnik Crabmeat would act as Robotnik's close lackey more than Snively for numerous issues, until the badniks were, for the most part, faded out of the storyline.

    Snively appears to have some built in cybernetics, as he not only had a switch operating a door on the back of his hand, but controlled his Eggbots with remotes resembling his thumbnails. One nail even has a communicator. Whether or not they remained after he was roboticized and derobotized is unknown. He also has GPS trackers in his last six hairs.

    Former writer Ken Penders revealed on his forum that in his post-#159 plans, he originally intended to kill off Snively in a heroic act while he attempted to shut down an unstable nuclear power plant with the help of the Freedom Fighters. Snively's death would have hit Sonic hard with grief and would have caused uneasiness between all his friends.

    The cause for Snively losing his hair was due to "male-pattern baldness" which afflicted the geniuses of the family, as he claimed to his father Colin, but in the animated series it was caused by a time traveling Sonic. Both series feature Snively being quite fond of his hair, and becoming vengeful upon losing it.

    Snively has many similarities to The Lord of the Rings character Gollum. In appearance both are short individuals, have long stringy individual hairs and bluish eye color. In personality both are snivilling, greedy, cowardly, and back stabbing individuals. It's possible that Snively was inspired by Gollum, but no evidence exists that this was intended.
