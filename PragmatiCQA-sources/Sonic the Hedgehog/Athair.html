   Athair was born the son of
   Janelle-Li
   , the only female
   Guardian
   in the history of the

    Brotherhood of Guardians

   Nemo
   died when he was an infant, leaving Janelle-Li to raise him alone. At some point Athair had even been to

   </a>
   . However, not long after his time as the island Guardian began, the Ancient Walkers appeared before him and informed the young echidna he had a higher purpose. After transporting him to witness the Lost Tribe of Echidnas, he was taken by the Walkers to Haven where he encountered his mother. Despite his objections, Janelle-Li took up Athair's position of Guardian for him, as she too sensed he had a higher calling. From there, Athair began learning from the Ancient Walkers, and became the
   Mitre
   of the Lost Tribe as they sought out Albion. (

Sabre urged Athair to tend to his mother and resume the mantle of Guardian, but Athair refused, deciding to remain with the Lost Tribe. His son, furious at him, took up the position at age 7.

Explaining the agony his great-grandson was suffering through, Athair convinced Merlin to summon Turbo Tails. After Chaos Knuckles quickly defeated Turbo Tails, Athair probed Tails' mind and discovered that this was a duplicate, the location of the real Tails unknown. Athair explained they should not inform the false Tails of this without knowing how the switch occurred or who was responsible, transporting the duplicate Tails to Knothole. (

   Athair is at times light-hearted individual, having long been freed from the responsibilities that have darkened the dispositions of so many of his family. However, he does have the horrors of his own past weighing on his mind, and takes seriously the burden of watching over Mobius. Sarcastic and prone to humor, Athair is given to talking in riddles, which confuse Sonic and Tails to no end and are often frustrating to Knuckles as well. Despite their occasional arguments, he and Knuckles do share a number of things, which eventually includes the idea that Angel Island's safety is no more important than the safety of Mobius at large. And oddly enough, him and his
   grandson
   aren't exactly close as the two rarely speak and when they do, they usually argue. Athair is usually reasonable, but can be harsh and unyielding when strained.

He wears what appears to be a fuzzy tan covering of sorts with simple brown sandals and white gloves (notably lacking spikes like most Guardians). He wears a necklace with two gourd-like objects and his long dreadlocks are adorned with large beads in greens, yellows, oranges and reds. The length of the dreadlocks as well as the size and number of beads often varies between artists. Some depict him with whiskers.

   As a trained Guardian and an acolyte of the Ancient Walkers, Athair has developed a strong connection with the Chaos Force that grants him many abilities. While he rarely displays most of his talents, he has shown a great proficiency for teleportation and telekinesis, traits often exhibited by other Guardians. Upon ascending to the Virtual Zone, his abilities increased dramatically, to the point where he became able to astral project himself-usually in the form of a disembodied head-to other locations and communicate with other mystically inclined beings.

    Athair was the only member of Knuckles' family to appear on a Sonic TV show, and in any media outside the comic series; he was featured in the saga "Chaos Emerald Crisis" of

    Apart from
    Edmund (P.X.E.)
    , Athair is the only comic-exclusive Guardian not to have been created by Ken Penders, but rather by Michael Gallagher, who created most of the characters introduced in the
