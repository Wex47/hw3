After Hawking solved the problem and brought back both Echidnas and Dingoes in Echidnaopolis, Remington and his forces found themselves on call to prevent fighting between the two species, particularly as the Dingoes felt that they were being treated unfairly.

   Moritori Rex
   without the knowledge of anyone outside the Legion but Tobor himself. Despite Remington's wish to protect the Guardian by providing him with officers for security, Knuckles refused, and as a result was the only one dragged into the

   The Dark Legion's efforts to seize Echidnaopolis through political means left Remington a captive of their android candidate,
   Benedict

Benedict hinted at secrets in Remington's past that would be revealed if he refused to cooperate with the new order, but Remington remained ignorant-whether by design or in truth is unknown. Escaping the Legion's clutches, he came to Knuckles' rescue with the help of a Dingo taxi driver named
   Harry
   , whom Remington would call upon at times for aid despite Harry's reluctance. Investigating an electromagnetic pulse that rendered several Legionnaires inert, he found Knuckles unconscious following

   Wynmacher

Unaware of this, Remington graciously agreed to help her get her bearings, but soon found himself facing an unpleasant surprise of his own: the Dark Legion approaching Echidnaopolis with an offer for reunification and Knuckles offering them his support. Whatever his views on the matter, Remington ran security for a meeting between Dimitri and the

   Lara-Su then returned to her own time, and Remington's next difficulty came when Mammoth Mogul took Dimitri prisoner and forced Knuckles to confront him. Together with Lien-Da, Remington was one of the first on the scene after a massive explosion of Chaos energy, and thus among the first to find Knuckles dead. As a result of this, Remington was among the most skeptical when Knuckles returned during the battle against the

   after nearly a year spent in imprisonment, Remington joined his old allies in hooking up with the Dark Legion, who had become the primary resistance to Dr. Eggman and the Dingoes on Angel Island. Remington was also the first to explain to Knuckles his role as the

Remington was also amongst the first to bow to Knuckles, having come to firmly believe that the Guardian was the Avatar.

With his typical sense of duty and aware of his birthright, Remington contested Lien-Da's control over the Dark Legion. This resulted in the Legion's schism, with those choosing to follow Remington becoming the

   Eventually, Dr. Finitevus contacted both Remington and Lien-Da with the knowledge that ninety percent of the Echidna population had been wiped out, convincing them to put aside their feud so that they could use the power of the

   and the Master Emerald's energy to turn Knuckles into the new Enerjak following a brief meeting in which Remington was addressed with unsettling familiarity by the Guardian. Joining forces, Remington and Lien-Da launched an all out assault on the new Enerjak, but their weapons proved woefully inadequate. Enerjak then seized the former EST Constable with his powers, and warped reality to restore Remington's mind and body to their original states, bringing back the goodly natured Constable. Remington, together with all willing Dark Legionnaires and former Echidnaopolis residents, was teleported to the city of

   A powerful presence as always, Remington soon took charge of the Echidnas in Albion as they began to build a new life amidst the ruins of the destroyed city. Early in the rebuilding, Remington found a recording device detailing the origins of Dr. Finitevus, which he played for Locke when the Guardian arrived unexpectedly. Thanking Remington for his help, Locke turned over the Echidnas' protection to his former subordinate, trusting Remington with the safety of their people. He would later watch with others from Albion as the battle between Enerjak and

   Remington took to his new task with a will, organizing construction efforts rapidly and in a way that brought some comfort to Knuckles as he watched them during a brief trip to the surface, observing the Echidnas with guilt over his actions as Enerjak. Many of the Echidnas were pleased to work under Remington, and even his old girlfriend
   Komi-Ko
   watched on with admiration as he led the reconstruction efforts. Eventually Lara-Le took command of the refugees and Remington formed a new version of the E.S.T. comprised of former officers and Dark Legionnaires. (

   Remington is a brown echidna with blue eyes. He has dark black/brown hair and slightly bushy eyebrows. Originally, as constable of the EST, he wore a green uniform jacket, tall blue boots, and a green or tan wide-brimmed hat with a green hatband and beaded tassel. He sometimes wore a helmet with a clear visor in lieu of his hat. Some artists occasionally omitted his hair and/or eyebrows.
  </p>
  <p key="f47d9235-a01d-4eb3-bd93-6bc0ed0dd558">
   He was later redesigned by artist Jon Gray; this rendition of Remington was meant to be iconic of the fate of the echidnas at the time. He was weary in appearance, wearing baggy green pants, orange and green gloves/shoes, a torn white shirt with a green insignia, wraps on his arms and dreadlocks, and manacles on his wrists and ankles. He was later corrupted mentally and physically changed to resemble his late father Kragok with the addition of a cybernetic right eye and left arm. At this time he also wore a dark cloak.
  </p>
  <p key="4f7b3775-c8f4-435f-8bb2-910091988d59">
   Remington's body was eventually restored and, adopting the simple clothing of the besieged echidnas, he now wears a simple green robe with a tan belt, white gloves with green and tan cuffs, and sandals. He also gained a new set of clothing apparently designed for combat.
