   Taking on their respective rivals, Bass and Metal Sonic once again proved to be a formidable combination. Bass attacked from a distance, though he wanted Mega Man to face him, and had Treble close in to attack directly. When this resulted in Treble being hit, Bass charged Mega Man in rage, and blasted Sonic off his feet. In an effort to confuse their enemies, the heroes switched opponents, but Bass' shots and Treble's attacks proved too much for Sonic, whom Bass sent flying with a devastating kick. He continued to blast at Sonic, until the heroes decided upon a new strategy: double-teaming him. Sonic came at him again, serving as a distraction that allowed Mega Man to employ the Chaos Cannon weapon he had acquired from

   's Piko Hammer soon took Bass out of the fight. He tried to refute Mega Man's claims that he was unable even to fuse with a limping Treble to continue fighting, but struggled even to speak. Following the heroes' capture, the battle-damaged trio struggled to get back on their feet, Bass cursing the doctors' plans and blaming them for his defeat. He had little time to gripe, however, as the Super Genesis Wave washed over the Skull Egg Zone, Mobius, and Earth, rewriting all reality in its path.

   Bass has shown a capacity for cruelty and a love of causing others harm.  He is obsessed with defeating Mega Man by any means necessary and proving himself as the most powerful robot in the world. This has, at times, caused him to rebel against Wily's authority, but seems content to do his bidding so long as he finds it entertaining.  Bass is shown to have a very short temper and is easily annoyed or angered, especially when facing someone with an ego to match his own (namely Sonic).  Despite this, he cares deeply for his dog Treble, and even stopped during a fight with Mega Man to make sure he wasn't hurt, becoming enraged when Mega Man attacked Treble in the first place.  Although he is quick to announce his superiority over other robots, he is not above working with others, shown by his constant companionship with Treble, as well as his partnership with Metal Sonic, which Bass seemed to enjoy.

  <p key="ac21a5ba-95d7-4893-b5bc-362ad1bfb6e8">
   Bass possesses a number of abilities similar to Mega Man's, including strength that enabled him to easily subdue Tails.  He is also capable of firing energy bullets in rapid succession, fast enough for even Sonic to have a hard time dodging them. He has great strength and impressive physical speed and reflexes as well, demonstrated by his ability to land a kick on Sonic that sent the Hedgehog flying, as well as being able to deflect a Spin Dash with one hand. According to Mega Man, he also has the ability to fuse with Treble for more power, though this form is apparently impossible to take while damaged and Bass never employed it in his battles with the heroes.

   Bass is a humanoid robot roughly the size of Mega Man with black, yellow, and white armor. He wears a large helmet with two yellow fins sticking out from the sides, and his exposed face is marked with purple stripes on the sides of his red eyes. A four-pointed star decorates his forehead, while a blue triangle is present on his chest. He has white hands and black gauntlets lined with yellow which-like Mega Man and Proto Man-he can convert into a buster weapon.
