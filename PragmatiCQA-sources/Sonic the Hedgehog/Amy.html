After Tails realized where Eggman and Metal Sonic could be hiding, Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails made their way to Eggman's new flying fortress. After handing over their Ancient Gear in exchange for Amy thinking that Eggman didn't have the seventh (since Eggman specifically asked for the "last" Ancient Gear from Sonic after stealing the five from Tails), the team realized that Metal Sonic had the last Ancient Gear inside of it. After the three defeated Metal Sonic and saved Amy, Eggman and Metal Sonic fled the fortress. After taking a look at the database on the fortress, Tails realized that there was a deep sea base directly under where they were and that the airship was only for supply shipments, Sonic decided that before pursuing the villains they should collect the seven Chaos Emeralds, which had a habit of showing up when they needed them.

Amy also briefly disputed with Rotor, who suggested stealing the Emerald rather than competing, and was backed up by Sally in her view that the Freedom Fighters couldn't afford to compromise their integrity. Amy and her teammates soon arrived in Casino Park, where they enjoyed a brief but tense interview with Breezie, before running into a far more thrilling new acquaintance from Amy's perspective: her favorite fashion designer Honey the Cat. Recognizing Amy's ensemble as one of her creations, Honey determined to release it as part of the "Rose Collection," something that thrilled Amy. After a disturbingly well-synchronized routine between the two of them, Amy introduced Honey to her teammates, and they explained their reasons for being in the tournament. Honey agreed to give them the Emerald in the event of her victory, though she hoped that the Freedom Fighters would all agree to model for her. (

Thunderbolt was alerted of the infiltration and attempt to stop them herself. Before the team could claim the Master Emerald shards, Thunderbolt attacked them.

Fearing he would not be able to recover the remaining seven shards before the Freedom Fighters found all the Chaos Emeralds and Gaia Keys, Knuckles was encouraged by Amy to not lose hope. And through the use of her Mystic Melody ability, she pinpointed a number of shards on
   Westside Island

After much fighting and struggling, Amy and her allies finally broke Walter's magical grip on Omega and were about to confront the vile wizard himself when he, having fully restored the Master Emerald, encased them all in solid crystal. Delighted with himself, Walter fled with Amy and the Master Emerald in tow, although Rouge and her teammates were broken free by Knuckles, who had freed himself. The four caught up to Naugus and directly engaged him, while also keeping him away from the Master Emerald. (

Amy could not bring herself to attack the image of her beloved friend, so she left the job to the hedgehog's fellow rivals to deliver the finishing blow for her. In the end, Shadow and his team parted ways with Knuckles and Amy when the two returned the Master Emerald to Shrine Isle, successfully defeating Walter Naugus and having him imprisoned in the process.

Though she loves fashion and is often quite cheerful, she also possesses a temper rivaling if not surpassing that of Knuckles.
