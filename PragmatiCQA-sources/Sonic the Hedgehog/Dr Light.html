   Dr. Light is an idealist whose greatest hope is that his robotic creations can make life better for humans. He is tremendously proud of his "children," caring for them with all the affection of a father for biological offspring, and expressing concern for them as well. Like Mega Man, he has been reluctantly forced to stand up and defend the world from the predations of Dr. Wily and other evils, typically doing so by aiding Mega Man from the sidelines. Despite the many betrayals Wily has dealt him, however, Light has never ceased his efforts to help his former colleague see reason, particularly when the latter takes a path of self-destruction that Light has seen him walk all too often.
