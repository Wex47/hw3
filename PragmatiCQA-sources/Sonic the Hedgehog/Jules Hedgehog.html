   Despite arriving in time for medical treatment, Jules' wounds proved mortal, and he would have died. With no other alternative to save his brother's life, Charles decided there was only one hope to save Jules: the Roboticizer, a machine he had desperately worked to develop after the war had ended. Unbeknownst to Charles, Warlord Julian had already tampered with the machine, and upon Jules' roboticization, he became little more than an obedient drone. Robbed of his free will, Jules was rendered seemingly lifeless, which Charles blamed himself for. The roboticized Jules' abilities were later studied secretly by Julian, and when Bernadette discovered them, Robotnik manipulated Jules into roboticizing his own wife. Worse, Jules remained fully aware of what was taking place around him, but was powerless to act against it. (

   his father
   , and how Moebius had been a peaceful place until ten years after the
   Great Peace
   when everything stagnated and went into decline, at which point Scourge "woke it up," furthermore implying that he had killed his own father. Scourge then proceeded to threaten Jules, but the Robian simply stood up to him, called the green hedgehog a coward, and pointed out he was a veteran of the Great War and would not go quietly, adding that while Scourge might not miss his father, he was certain that Sonic would not let the murder of

The young girl Hedgehog came to the family's home wanting to speak with Sonic, but ended up talking to the older couple instead and confessing her own overwhelming feelings as they listened sympathetically.

   Later, Naugus himself visited Jules and Bernie while Sonic was away, offering to use his magic to reverse Jules's Robian transformation and make him flesh-and-blood again just as he had with Bunnie if he agreed to a magical contract with him; in reality, however, Naugus simply sought to possess Jules and use him as a host body to cure the volatile mutations that had been plaguing him since Operation: Clean Sweep. Both of them, and Muttski, were unconvinced and argued against it since Bunnie didn't need to enter a contract. Bernie argued that he may have another motive and Jules could be injured in a process that can't be explained, while Jules stated that Naugus nearly drove Mobians and Robians to war, was the enemy of his mentor

   In his youth, Jules Hedgehog was very different from his mild-mannered brother: he possessed all the stubbornness and daring that his son Sonic would later develop. Despite this, he-like Sonic after him-was also a being of bravery and compassion. These qualities eventually won the heart of his wife, Bernadette. Following his Roboticization, however, Jules matured a great deal, and his status as a Robian-particularly after being forced to Roboticize his own wife and serve Robotnik's agenda-weighed heavily on him for some time.

  <p key="8cebd5be-9ac3-4dc7-9c58-5888262f4dc8">
   Calm and caring is the best way to describe the adult Jules: his family means the world to him. Despite being stuck as a Robian he remains in good spirit, choosing to get on with his life rather than brood over the downsides (a trait his son has inherited). He is less strict than his wife in parenting, having realized their son is a teenager now, not a little boy and allows accordingly more freedom.
  </p>
  <p key="8efeb131-1906-424b-aa42-7d7404e73c4e">
   Jules is also fiercely protective of his family, and has courage well-honed from his experiences in the Great War. He was quick to act to protect Sonic from an
   Auto Automaton
   that tried to kill him in is sleep, nearly losing his own life as a result. Additionally, when

    Former writer Ken Penders revealed on his forum that in his post-#159 plans, he would have Jules resenting his condition as a Robian, prompting Sonic to seek a solution to his father's predicament. In the end, Jules would still be a Robian, but would have resembled his organic form due to nanotechnology.

    In his very first appearance via flashback in Chuck's memories, Jules' roboticized form greatly resembled Sonic's design as Mecha Sonic featured in
    Sonic &amp; Knuckles: Mecha Madness
    , rather than a design similar to Chuck's own roboticized form. In his first appearance in the present however, Jules featured a completely new design with no visual callbacks to either Sonic or Chuck's roboticized forms, and maintained this design throughout his appearances.
