   Haven was built by the Fire Ant race for the use of the fledgling Brotherhood. The first Guardian brought there was Steppenwolf, shortly after the death of his father
   Edmund
   . For an unknown amount of time, he trained under Christopheles in physical, mental, and mystical fields until he emerged as a full warrior Guardian. Once he defeated the Dark Legion for the first time, Haven became his base of operations. As time passed, he was joined by his son
   Moonwatcher
   , his grandson
   Harlan
   , and finally his great-grandson
   Rembrandt
   before the tragic death of Rembrandt's son Aaron. When Aaron's younger brother
   Jordan
   began training as a Guardian, it was decided that Haven's existence would be kept secret from the youngest Guardian until such time as he was ready to make his own journey there. To ensure this, the Brotherhood instituted a rather cold-hearted rite of passage in which the parent Guardian would leave their nine-year-old successor on Angel Island and walk through what appeared to be a wall of fire but was actually a hologram concealing a portal to Haven. The younger Guardian would be left under the impression that their parent was dead, and wouldn't be persuaded otherwise until years later. (

   . Unfortunately, though Haven's security was tight, one enemy managed to slip through:
   Moritori Rex

Just prior to this, the Brotherhood were watching as the Dark Legion attempted to gain control of Echidnaopolis through politics, only to fail as their android political candidate,
   Benedict
   , was taken out by an EMP generated by Knuckles. Haven itself fell to them during this, but the escape of Locke and Spectre and their subsequent ambush of Moritori and his granddaughter,
