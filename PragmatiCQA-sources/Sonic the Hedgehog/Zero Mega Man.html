   Zero is a confident fighter and a noble warrior, but also possesses something of a temper. He is also not above intimidating others in order to accomplish the Hunters' goals. Zero's dedication to stopping Sigma is admirable, but at times borders on obsession, causing him to drive others onward even in the face of exhaustion and injury.

   Zero is a powerful warrior, and like his teammates can copy the abilities of enemies for his own use. He possesses both the Zero Buster, a cannon weapon similar to that wielded by X, and the Z-Saber, a powerful energy sword.

    As a Reploid is a robot modeled after X, Zero is not a Reploid. It is unknown just how similar Zero and X are in terms of the way they were built, as their respective creators were two different people. Being Dr. Light's rival and partner for a long time, it is possible that Dr. Wily matched schematics close enough for Zero to be superior to the Reploids created much later on.
