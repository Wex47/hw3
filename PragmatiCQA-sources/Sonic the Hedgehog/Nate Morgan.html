Upon reaching a point where the new energy was ready for testing, Nate felt tempted to wait until everything had been checked out, but went ahead with encouragement from his treacherous assistant Julian Kintobor, who would later become Dr. Robotnik. The result was an explosion that caused major damage to Megapolis and found Nate before his people on trial. Due to the absence of life lost, the Overlander leaders were lenient and allowed Nate to live freely, but banished him from their society forever. (

Due to the threat Nate's technology posed to the standing of magic, wizard Ixis Naugus vehemently opposed Nate, and soon enlisted Warlord Kodos as his ally in turning the Kingdom against the Overlanders. Arranging a battle between a party of Overlanders and a platoon of Mobians accompanying Nate and led by Kodos, the two accused Nate of revealing the Kingdom's location. Seeing the torment suffered by his adoptive nephew Max due to the controversy, Nate chose to go into exile himself, feeling that it was time that he should be apart from Overlanders and Mobians both.

Giving his friend the name Eddy, Nate worked with him to build a castle where they lived for many years, isolated from the rest of the world. (

   Nate's past came back to haunt him when Eddy returned to their castle one day with Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails in tow, both of them unconscious after a battle with Ixis Naugus earlier. Nate recognized that the two young Mobians could not be responsible for the disturbance, and so was ready to examine them for injuries when they awoke. Momentarily startled by Sonic's resemblance to his father Jules, Nate received another unpleasant surprise when Naugus materialized, having snuck into the castle by hiding inside Eddy's flame-thrower weapon. Naugus attempted to pass himself off as an innocent, stalked by Sonic and Tails across the planet before being captured by Eddy, but Nate was quick to see through his old enemy's ruse. As his new guests and Eddy were attacked by Naugus, Nate acted quickly and tricked Naugus into exiting the castle in pursuit of a holographic Power Ring, forcing Naugus to confront the fortress' many magical wards. With the reprieve, he introduced himself and Eddy to the young

   , telling his life story in the process. He then revealed the reason why Naugus wished to penetrate his fortress in the first place: a huge cache of Power Rings, enough to give Naugus total control over the fifth element and enable him to fuse Mobius with the

   , granting him omnipotence. Sonic had his own wishes for Nate's Rings, but Nate had no interest in participating in continued warfare, having long forsaken the Kingdom of Acorn. The Hedgehog tried to goad Nate by asking him why he refused to become a hero and make a difference as he had done in the past, but the world-weary Nate bitterly replied that it had always failed before.

   Political and ethical debate ceased as Ixis Naugus penetrated the Power Ring storehouse, intent on claiming his prize. He caused a cave-in which seemingly buried Sonic and Tails, but Nate and Eddy soon found themselves witness to a battle between
   Ultra Naugus
   ,
   Ultra Sonic
   , and
   Hyper Tails
   , all of them infused with seemingly unlimited power from the Rings they had absorbed. Protesting Naugus' rampage, Nate found himself blown away, only to be rescued by Tails just as the Fox and Sonic powered down. Falling unconscious in exhaustion due to the strain of using the rings, Sonic and Tails were unable to act as Naugus opened a portal to the Zone of Silence, intent on fusing it together with Mobius and making his power truly unlimited. Before completing his task, though, Naugus swooped in on Nate, intent on finishing him off-only to be blasted back into the Zone of Silence by a Power Ring hidden behind the special eyepiece attached to Nate's glasses. The effects of the battle soon tore the castle apart, and Eddy valiantly held up the crumbling structure as Nate carried Sonic and Tails to safety. Unfortunately, Eddy himself didn't survive, as the castle crushed him in its death throes. With nowhere else to go and a renewed desire for company, Nate agreed to return to Mobotropolis with his two new friends. (

With the artifact retrieved, Nate at last returned to his old home, only to find the city under attack by

   form, which were soon reversed. Nate remained long enough to remark that the sudden shifts between various versions of the present were too short-lived to be caused by Eggman, who never would have attempted such a thing unless he knew it would benefit him. Nate's fate was later discovered by Sonic when he returned to the city to warn the Overlanders of the toxic radiation poisoning. When Robotropolis was destroyed by a nuclear strike from Station Square's
   O.T.I.S.
   defense program, the roboticized and immobilized Nate perished in the blast. (

Despite his vows at times to leave the rest of the world to its fate and not get involved, he has intervened time and again to help others. Even with the suffering they had put him through, he also remained devoted to his Overlander brethren and the Mobians, putting his own life on the line to save them right up until the end.

    cartoon series, as found in the series' bible. Nate's appearance is described much differently being a tall, ancient black man with a toothy smile, a gnarled cane and had a pet parrot that once served as the environmental adviser to King Acorn. While ultimately not making it to the final version of the cartoon, Nate was eventually redesigned and retooled as a scientist for the comic series after comic staff had discovered his existence in the bible. It is highly possible that the original variation of Nate Morgan may be able to appear as Nate is essentially part of the SatAM universe.
