   was in the middle of researching the earthquakes that had recently began occurring across the planet. After showing his nephew samples of a dark gas that had been emitted from the cracks in the earth, another earthquake struck and Sonic had to rescue his uncle from falling into an opened crater. As he dashed back down to retrieve the gas sample, a stray piece of debris smashed a part of the container open, giving Sonic a face full of purple gas, nearly suffocating him. Upon returning to the surface, Sonic briefly displayed feral actions, which immediately passed, brushing off his uncle's suggestion of being checked over by a doctor. (

He made quick work of the Egg Army forces, but became unbalanced, his state distorting his perception. An attempt to eliminate Thunderbolt was halted by Mighty, whom Sonic through distorted vision and hearing felt was accusing and taunting him of being unbalanced and dangerous. The Werehog and the Armadillo engaged in a brief battle which was halted by Sally and Amy, who-though they too were initially distorted by Sonic's transformed senses-managed to talk him down from his rage. He later returned to normal when the sun rose the next morning, but-fearing the harm he might do if he transformed aboard the

   Sonic's lessons with Moss centered on him learning to accept that the Werehog was a part of him, to be embraced rather than controlled. Sonic soon mastered his lessons, and when night fall again he turned into the Werehog but retained his usual senses. He was then able to employ his new form to defeat a

   In Werehog form, Sonic is possessed of incredible strength, rivaling that of Mighty the Armadillo. He is also capable of stretching his arms to great length, useful for attacking enemies or moving through rough terrain. He can use powerful punches when in combat.

      It's been commonly pointed out by fans that the term "Werehog" is not an accurate terminology. The word "Were", as used in the term "Werewolf", is a Latin word meaning "Man", making the term literally translate to "Man-wolf", a man who becomes a wolf. This would make the literal version of Werehog into "Man-hog", implying that Sonic would've been a man that becomes a hog of some kind, which obviously is not the case.

   Sonic the Werehog first made an appearance in Sonic Universe 29's Off-panel, when
   Scourge
   said he was sick of being picked around and asked if there was any other altered Sonic in the prison; the Werehog proved to be the only other candidate. Sonic Universe 32's Off-Panel also included the Werehog, this time as the puppeteer behind a
   Horizont-Al
   and
   Verti-Cal
   puppet show. The Werehog eventually returned in StH #264's Off-Panel, with
