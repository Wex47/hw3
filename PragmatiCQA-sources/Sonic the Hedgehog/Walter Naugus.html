   . Knuckles was thrilled to met another echidna while Shadow questioned the convenience of his arrival and situation. Rouge then contacted Shadow and told him that she and Amy were under attack and needed assistance. However "Nixus" didn't want to risk damaging the shards by going into combat. Knuckles agreed with Nixus and decided to go with him to a safe location to restore the Master Emerald while Shadow goes to help the others. However, upon arriving in an empty chamber, Nixus double-crossed Knuckles, took his shards and crystallized the echidna. Nixus then revealed himself as Naugus and tried to assemble the Master Emerald but to no avail. He then came up with the idea of controlling Knuckles' mind so that the latter could tell him how to fix the Master Emerald. Instead, Knuckles broke out of the crystals he was trapped in and proceeded to attack Naugus. The wizard quickly reminded Knuckles that his comrades were still in danger which momentarily distracted the echidna and allowed Naugus to knock him out of the chamber. Walter then quickly sealed the entrance with crystals and started to hastily assemble the Master Emerald himself, as his foes fought Crystal Omega. (

   As the emerald slowly began to take shape, Naugus thought back to the numerous times he'd faced setbacks and how his attempts to regain his full powers with technology only made him suffer. Eventually, Naugus succeeds in repairing the Master Emerald and immediately uses its power to fully replenish his own. By the time Knuckles and his allies restored Omega to normal and break into the chamber, Naugus had seemingly regained all of his magical power, which was now further enhanced by the Master Emerald. Walter then proceeds to crystallize all his foes in a single energy blast, before using the emerald's power to contact his sister to gloat about about his victory. However, he was disgusted to find out that Wendy has joined the Eggman Empire and branded her a traitor before cutting the transmission.

   Not letting the news about Wendy dampen his high spirits, Walter took the Master Emerald and a crystallized Amy Rose three hundred feet below the secret chamber toward a
   Teleporter
   leading out of the caves. Naugus planned to come back for the others and turn them all into his own vanguard to use against his enemies. Unfortunately for Walter, Knuckles and Team Dark broke free from their imprisonment and caught up with the wizard before he could leave. Naugus tried to grab the Master Emerald but was knocked back by Shadow, while Knuckles frees Amy, who then stopped Naugus from crystallizing Omega again. In an effort to save himself from Amy's wrath, Walter changes into Sonic with the assumption that she wouldn't hurt the person she loves. But Amy, unimpressed by his attempt, lets Knuckles and Shadow beat on him instead. Without the Master Emerald to enchant his magic, Naugus was soon defeated and later incarcerated by

   Walter Naugus appears as a tall, gruesome troll with bat-like ears, a horn emerging from his forehead, a long white beard, a gloved lobster-like claw in place of a left hand, and a thick tail. Originally, he wore a purple suit with a long black cape, glove on his right hand, belt, and boots. He later adopted a new wardrobe that included a purple tunic, purple pants, gray gloves and boots, a cape, and a stereotypical wizard/witch hat with a large brim and a point that falls to one side.

    Naugus' new name of "Walter" and disdained nickname "Wally" are intended to be alliterative with relatives of Naugus' in the new reality, which was later revealed to be Wendy. The name is not intended to be a tribute to the late Walter "Wally" Marsh, an actor who provided additional voices for

    Furthermore, there was no intended connection between Naugus' new identity and Walter "Wally" West, one of the many characters to adopt the DC Comics superhero identity of the Flash; many fans believed this due to the Flash's heavy involvement in DC's "The New 52" and the Sonic reboot beginning with issue #252.

    Naugus was one of several characters featured in a "classic cartoon" depiction art gallery in

    Whereas the original continuity featured Naugus as a hideous amalgamation of three different Mobians, the new continuity explains his appearance as being part of the
    Troll
    race. This was hinted at in

    Unlike in the original continuity, Naugus now has a tail. This was an aspect carried from how he appeared in the SatAM cartoon, a design trait that was initially discarded for his comic debut for unknown reasons.
