   Determined to continue on, Sally soon had the team targeted on another Chaos Emerald, and led the D'Coolettes in while Rotor, Amy, and Tails waited in reserve. Sensing an obvious trap, Sally nonetheless continued, knowing how essential the Emerald was to restoring the planet. As expected, Eggman's forces were in place:

Luckily, the remaining crew aboard the Sky Patrol, led by Cream, flew in to rescue their beleaguered teammates. The group soon rendezvoused with Sonic, who was stunned by their battered appearances, and Sally berated herself for acting foolishly and not guessing that Eggman had learned of the stolen data. Sonic encouraged her, but both were unpleasantly surprised to learn that the next Chaos Emerald was in the hands of an old acquaintance:

Despite the urgency of the matter, she refused to condone stealing the Emerald, knowing that the world looked to them as heroes. When Sonic questioned how her father felt about her employing the kingdom's wealth as she had-paying the Chaotix to help locate Emeralds and attempting to pay off Breezie-Sally recalled the awkwardness of approaching her father for the funds, but would only tell Sonic that her father was "pragmatic."

When Ellidy reported that the Badnik assigned to monitor the lake was no longer sending footage despite reading as active, Sally volunteered herself and Big to go check on things. During the trip, Sally questioned how Big felt about Nicole, and the simple Cat responded that he liked her and it didn't matter to him whether she was a machine or not. The two arrived at the lake just in time for another Red Star Ring to emerge, but were then attacked by Ellidy's Badnik. After Big dispatched the robot, the two headed back to
   Dr. Ellidy's House

   The confrontation led to a discussion of Ellidy's behavior towards Nicole, something that Sally couldn't understand, and Ellidy revealed that Nicole had been created to save the life of
   Nikki
   , his daughter. The effort had failed, and he had thus erected a shrine to her on the side of his home on Isolated Island. Sally's exchange with him grew heated, but she eventually realized that they were being affected by the energy of Dark Gaia. Much to her horror, Dark Gaia's Minions and Ellidy's Badniks closed in to attack, forcing them to take shelter inside the house. Closeting herself and Ellidy in the lab, the pair were confronted by

Leaving the doctor a Ring Blade, she entered the Digital World and challenged Phage alongside Nicole. (

   Despite Sally's bravery, Phage merely saw her presence as an added bonus, and set out to devour the pair of friends. Sally encouraged Nicole to flee, but instead the Lynx A.I. attacked Phage, causing considerable damage. The pair briefly escaped, and Sally questioned why her friend hadn't left when she had told her to. Nicole responded by revealing that Phage had prevented her from returning to her computer, and further insisted that she wouldn't leave Sally. Sally then bemoaned that she couldn't use the abilities Nicole displayed in the Digital World, which Nicole reminded her was due to the Digitizer accommodating her own understanding of reality. Sally then hit upon a strategy-luring Phage to an outside system and having Nicole create a digital copy of one of Ellidy's
   Sling Rings
   so that she could pull Sally back into Ellidy's systems. The plan worked, and Nicole then tried to seal Phage out, but the virus proved too powerful until Ellidy inserted a Red Star Ring into Nicole's computer, transforming her into
   Overclocked Nicole

   Sally is a natural leader and tactician, serving as the strategist and organizer of the Freedom Fighters. She has a very logical mind, but has experienced enough that she readily accepts the mystical forces she encounters. However, her thought process does have it's drawbacks, such as limiting her physical abilities in the
   Digital World
   to what she's capable of in the real world.
  </p>
  <p key="d1969aa1-ab31-4bcc-a04e-e04c30313c09">
   For combat purposes, Sally employs her
   Ring-Blades
   , which were developed by Dr. Ellidy. These blades, projected from her bracelets, are strong enough to withstand Metal Sonic's claws, and can cut through solid substances such as metal alloys. Sally wields them with great proficiency in battle; in the Digital World, she could also conceive of them in other shapes such as a shield and sword.

  <p key="260986cc-3553-484c-93b5-b8c16f737bb4">
   Sally is strong-minded and is very opinionated. She is often logical and focused with a playful side and prefers to plan ahead in almost all situations. She often takes the role of a leader, not only in directing and organizing people en masse but also through mediation and offering suggestions or compromises to difficult situations.
  </p>
  <p key="e65c53f2-5499-441d-a1e8-2589a61123cc">
   Despite being a princess, Sally is a bit of a "tomboy", not hesitating to get into rough or messy situations if needed and does not typically dress regally or act as a damsel, but rather acts as a fighter.
  </p>
  <p key="d8c49296-8e5d-460c-aec1-c93520a8bec6">
   Sally is known to be kind but headstrong and has a tendency to put too much pressure on herself to react in the most wise way. She can be somewhat insecure at times and should she think herself to have failed or misjudged a situation in the past, she will often have tremendous self-doubts in herself at the frustration of her perceived inability.
  </p>
  <p key="2d34002f-3efd-4b0a-a913-a684b122d1c1">
   Sally's attitude towards her title of princess is one of duty; she is a firm leader with a strong sense of justice and a warm heart, and loves her people and strives to do the best she can for them. She is very caring as well and shows passion, bravery and determination, often remaining undeterred by setbacks, and goes out of her way to make sure her friends are safe and happy. While inwardly compassionate, she can often come off as confrontational, overbearing, hard, sardonic and condescending when stifled enough. When her emotions are open however, she is often only protective of her friends, constantly worried about their wellbeing in the field.

Each of her eyes has two medium-long eyelashes. Her clothes consist of black shorts with white rimming, dark blue boots with white outlines on the buckles, and white gloves with blue power bracelets that produce energy blades. She wears a closed blue vest with a black crop-top hidden underneath. Her tan-colored underbelly can be seen in the her midriff.

When she was slightly older, she started wearing her hair (now shorter) in a ponytail, and sported an open blue vest with a collar, with a black tube-top underneath, black sports pants held up by a white belt with a square, golden buckle, and wore a pair of grey and white sneakers.
