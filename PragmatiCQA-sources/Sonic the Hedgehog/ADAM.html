   Although he may seem at first to have a plain, overly proper manner, A.D.A.M. does have a sense of humor. Logically minded, the only way to beat him a contest of wits is to supply him with a conundrum that he cannot answer. Unlike his creator Eggman, A.D.A.M. seems equally prepared to use subtlety and brute force, using nanites to infect enemy technology while at the same time creating a city that nearly killed the

   A.D.A.M. also possessed a sadistic side, taking pleasure in causing pain to the Freedom Fighters and to others. He was without qualms about manipulating others in his plans, or even endangering his own "father" while furthering his agendas.

   Additionally, before his death A.D.A.M. had sought the respect he believed he deserved from Dr. Eggman, going so far as to have his sister
   Mecha
   framed for treason and executed so that Eggman would love A.D.A.M. best. This came from an instability in his programming that led to a juvenile need for Eggman's attention and approval. He went to great lengths to earn the respect of his parent, so far as creating his pseudonym and setting out to eliminate all the greatest powers on Mobius. (

He also controlled an innumerable number of nanites, which he could use to infect and control virtually any mechanical device. Upon taking possession of Tommy Turtle's body, A.D.A.M. gained all the bionic properties granted to Tommy by his shell being fused together with nanites, such as the ability to sprout metallic wings.
