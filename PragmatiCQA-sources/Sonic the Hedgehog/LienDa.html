   and the
   Twilight Zone
   opened, allowing the Dark Legion to escape confinement once again. However, when they emerged from the Twilight Zone, their mother became terribly ill. Despite returning to the
   Twilight Zone
   , their mother
   Merin-Da
   died from her ailments, scarring Lien-Da and her brother emotionally. (

   When Lien-Da was about sixteen years of age, her father met and fell in love with
   Mari-Su
   . Shortly afterwards the two got married, which deeply upset Lien-Da and her brother, who not only saw her as a threat to their own ambitions, but believed that they should have had a say in the matter; Lien-Da was especially indignant at the apparent nerve of her father. One year later, Mari-Su gave birth to Lien-Da's half-sister

   , though Lien-Da and Kragok never accepted her as family and completely ignored and shunned her. Sometime later, Lien-Da personally assassinated Mari-Su, though effectively staged it to make it appear as if her death was a tragic accident. (

   Not long afterwards, Kragok and Lien-Da met in secret to discuss the idea of killing their own father to secure their "birth right" and become the first joint-Grandmasters of the Dark Legion. While Lien-Da proved more than willing to carry out the task, Kragok showed some hesitance at the idea of killing their birth father. In the end, the two agreed to eliminate Luger, feeling that
   Moritori Rex
   had been more of a father figure to them. Using a
   powerful and experimental weapon
   provided by Kragok, Lien-Da targeted Luger while he was alone cataloguing a series of crates. The weapon did its job, but thanks to Kragok's sabotage it exploded, leaving Lien-Da in a coma. She awoke some time later in a body cast, at which point Kragok informed her that her mission was a "success", but that while she was unconscious he stood up and took the position of Grandmaster for himself. However, Kragok promised to keep Lien-Da as the Kommissar of the Dark Legion, a position Lien-Da was forced to remain in for years. This betrayal by Kragok caused Lien-Da to never fully trust her twin brother ever again. (

   After Lien-Da healed, she and Kragok had Julie-Su's
   Memory Neutralizing Chip
   activated, deleting her memories so she would never know of her relation to them and thus ensure they would not have to share their power with her. They forced
   Simon
   and
   Floren-Ca
   to take her in as her adoptive parents, as Floren-Ca had already been placed in charge of Julie-Su's well being by Luger. However, Lien-Da and Kragok continued to be paranoid that Julie-Su would one day learn the truth from her adoptive parents, and so eventually they forced Simon and Floren-Ca to give up Julie-Su, and once again had the latter's memory erased. Lien-Da's aggressive nature also terrified her sister-in-law
   Eli-Za

When Knuckles undid the effects of the Quantum Beam, Lien-Da was outraged that he had returned all life to Angel Island, ruining their plans. Dimitri however reminded her of Knuckles' untold power and warned her to watch what she said.

The plan failed when Knuckles took the hit, and her would-be assassin was apprehended. Hoping to salvage the situation and prevent her hired gun from talking, she had

Lien-Da was concerned Knuckles would not save Dimitri, but the dying Echidna told her he should have died a long time ago, making Lien-Da promise to follow in his footsteps should he die, which Lien-Da did. Despite her promise however, Lien-Da was planning a back-up operation in case the High Council did not approve of the unification plan. (

   Not long after the Xorda attack ended, the Dingo Regime, under the new leadership of
   Kage Von Stryker
   , allied with the Eggman Empire and together launched a successful takeover of Angel Island. Due to the Dingo persecution of all echidnas, Lien-Da used the Dark Legion as the primary resistance force on the island, providing shelter, protection and food to the civilian echidnas who fled to them or those they managed to liberate from Dingo-run concentration camps. Lien-Da's responsibilities increased dramatically after she was entrusted with the role of protecting the

   When Knuckles arrived at Angel Island following a distress call from what was believed to be Locke, he was surprised to find Lien-Da guarding the Emerald. Despite working together out of necessity, Lien-Da taunted Knuckles and Julie-Su, eventually getting into a bitter confrontation with the latter over the topic of their father.

   Unbeknownst to Lien-Da, Dr. Finitevus had not been captured by Hunter. Instead, he had used the opportunity to escape, and later rescued Remington from the Egg Grape Chambers, restoring him back to health and providing him with new memories (as his old memories had been lost thanks to his time in the Chamber). Finitevus then had Remington return to the Dark Legion, claiming title as Grandmaster, which resulted in the
   Dark Legion's civil war

   Flame Legion
   still loyal to Lien-Da and the

   Some time later, Lien-Da and Remington called a cease fire, after learning from Dr. Finitevus that ninety percent of all echidnas worldwide had been killed off. The two leaders were told that Finitevus could grant them the power of the Master Emerald to defeat their enemies and save the remaining echidnas, but this was merely a ploy to keep them complacent; while he considered both to be suitable candidates for his plans, he eventually decided that Knuckles would be more effective than either of them. When Finitevus had Knuckles become the chaos-demigod Enerjak instead of Remington or herself, Lien-Da swore revenge against Finitevus. Both she and Remington had the Dark Legion attempt to oppose the new Enerjak, but instead had all of their cybernetic enhancements removed. (

Angry and indignant, Lien-Da was approached by Knuckles, who pleaded with her to abandon her alliance for the sake of their remaining people. Lien-Da told Knuckles that his ancestors always believed to know what was best for everyone, and blamed Knuckles for their current situation as he was responsible for robbing them of their cybernetic parts. She then ordered the Dark Egg Legion to fall back. However, Lien-Da was surprised to see Dimitri arrive on the scene with a new, massive robotic body. Dimitri informed her he was taking command of the operation, which she begrudgingly accepted. (

The Legion was flanked and herded into an area where Tails remotely disabled their weaponry, leaving them helpless. Assistance later came in the form of Eggman in his new

Thus, she determined herself to become the Grandmaster, even if it meant taking it from Dimitri. After being called to Dimitri's lab, she learned from him that they could control the Dark Egg Legion by modifying one of the microchips provided by the Iron Queen. She then disabled his hover ball and rendered him temporarily unconsciousness. She proceeded to modify the single microchip and install it in herself, and after Dimitri awoke she explained her schemes before hiding Dimitri away so he could not be found.

When she revealed she had the microchips installed in the Dark Egg Legion, she was finally promoted to Grandmaster. (

   , who quickly engaged the Legionnaires. The battle quickly went in the Legion's favor as they reactivated a defense system that their cybernetics made them immune to, along with the arrival of Metal Knuckles. Additionally, Lien-Da revealed that Eggman had not only restored her to health, but also granted her improved cybernetics with the ability to produce energy whips. The battle was cut short when the defense system overloaded, knocking out the combatants. Then, while unconscious, Lien-Da and all her fellow Echidnas in the city were banished through a super-charged

   Lien-Da has a ruthless, femme fatale-style personality, and seems to care only for herself. Somewhat vain, she is extremely power-hungry and has no qualms about using underhanded methods if they serve her goals. Despite this, she actually cares deeply for the echidna people, and had once organized the Dark Legion to rescue and protect the Echidnas from the group of Dingoes who sold Angel Island to Dr. Eggman. She believes in Echidna supremacy, thinking that their use of technology to better themselves is only natural and finding the criticism of non-echidnas beneath her. She is judgmental, brutal, cruel and sadistic, needing little excuse to cause her enemies pain. She is also easily insulted, unwilling to admit fault and often attempting to deflect her problems onto others. However, she is clever, and is willing to take assistance when she needs it, even though it's ultimately to serve her own goals. For instance, she has gone to both Knuckles and Eggman for help when in difficult situations. Nevertheless, she has little regard for life, and is willing to kill to further her goals or simply eliminate those she dislikes. She does, however, show some uneasiness if children are among her targets. (

   Lien-Da has no apparent romantic interests. 
Her hatred of her half-sister Julie-Su seems to stem from her belief that her father showed more affection to Julie-Su than her. As a child, she showed annoyance that her father had not only remarried without her permission, but had had another daughter, with whom she refused to share power of the Legion or even acknowledge as a sibling.

  <p key="e4ee28ac-b59f-4316-a1bd-403e2fe744df">
   Lien-Da is a red echidna with red hair and blue eyes. She is often depicted along the lines of a femme fatale theme, and as such her designs tend to include a black leather-like appearance. Despite these general constants, the details of her design tend to vary widely from issue to issue and artist to artist. Generally, she wears a full black bodysuit with a belt and heavy black boots. She has on occasion been miscoloured pink rather than red and her tail is often forgotten. While usually given blue highlights to give the appearance of shiny leather, colourist Matt Herms often applies various purples and pinks to her outfit, giving them the appearance of a colourful sheen.
  </p>
  <p key="9441d420-2576-41e3-94b4-997a7ac026df">
   In her initial appearance, her hair was quite curly; later on it's more commonly wavy. Sometimes curls were stood up to give the impression of demonic horns. Artist Dawn Best tended to depict it sleek and straight-cut. While usually the same red of her body, her hair has sometimes been depicted as auburn or, more commonly, pink. Her dreadlocks were initially (and often) at least waist-length, though more recently they're considerably shorter. Like Julie-Su, she features a fully cybernetic dreadlock on her left; the others are usually adorned with crisscrossing white stripes similar to those on Lara-Le. However, they are also commonly depicted as decorated with horizontal rings instead; while both designs are usually white, they're sometimes black. Small metal plates and rings also appear on occasion.
  </p>
  <p key="9d4ea7d2-541e-414d-b4b8-2593a8b9fa4c">
   Though usually sticking with the general design as described above, her attire also features several variations. She was once depicted in a billowing yellow and green dress (though in terms of colours, it's likely the colourist mistook her for Lara-Le or Gala-Na, both of whom tend to wear yellow dresses). At a time, her outfit gained the addition of a black cape.
  </p>
  <p key="94767cce-c047-4040-962d-57c34a514ff9">
   Artist Jon Gray came up with several alternate designs for Lien-Da; while many were largely unused, various elements were kept in his depictions, such as heart themes and spiked/studded belts, collars and wristbands. She wore a midriff-bearing shirt and pants at this time and gained a whip. Some of the unused designs included a black tube top and shorts with tall black gloves, boots and fishnet stockings; another featured a black headband and pants decorated with a skull. A heart-themed tattoo on the stomach was among these designs. Some proposed her eyes become jet black or gold, but this was never applied and they remained blue.
  </p>
  <p key="30ed77dd-8996-4563-a154-b878bda82ca7">
   A sketch provided by artist Patrick Spaziante depicted Lien-Da as a child; here she had long dreads with a more simplistic assortment of technology and stripes and wore boots with some kind of kneepads. As a teenager, she wore a blue uniform with gold trim and white gloves; her belt featured a triangular buckle.

   Lien-Da has demonstrated basic combat skills, fighting along side Sonic and the Chaotix during an effort to rescue Locke from the Dingo Regime. She has also shown skill with a whip. A competent military tactician in her own right, her leadership has, however, failed to yield the same success as the Grandmasters before her achieved. She also has above average understanding of technology and is capable of operating both firearms and airborne vehicles.

    In a Q&amp;A, writer Ian Flynn said this about Kragok and Lien-Da when asked about the kind of relationship the two had:
    <i key="dd59f739-1a5c-484b-9d45-c249ed82314c">
     "I think their relationship was the closest to honest love they felt for anyone, and I mean that in the fraternal way. I think they came to rely and trust in one another when Luger re-married and sired Julie-Su. Once they began their swift rise to power I think they became the only people they truly trusted, and even then I think there was a seed of doubt - or at least a presumption that the other wouldn't hesitate to seize control if one of them faltered. In terms of your quote, I think Lien-Da feared that an indebtedness to the Guardians would show just such a weakness."
