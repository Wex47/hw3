   , threw himself into his father's arms, asking his veteran father how he had dealt with such things. Tearfully, Amadeus counseled his son to take it slowly and try to keep moving forward. In response to his son's inquiry as to Rosemary' whereabouts, Amadeus responded that she was with the council, but that she would rather have been there for Tails. (

   Amadeus possesses a fiery spirit, and is a dedicated patriot and hard-willed soldier. He considers himself "the sword of the people", eager to make sure that their rights are defended. He is also forward thinking, and determined to fix what doesn't work in his given system. While passionate, he is also volatile, and has let his temper get the best of him at times, though his heart is in the right place. He is also a loving and proud, if somewhat inexperienced, father, and a devoted husband. Somewhat aggressive, he tends to try achieving his goals through force rather than trying negotiation, at least until he is convinced that peaceful means are better.

   Amadeus is a brown fox with a blue eye, the left being covered by an eye-patch due to being gouged by
   Colin
   . In initial appearances his design was essentially modeled after that of his son, Tails, albeit with a single tail; later on some effort was made to give him more distinction, such as the addition of bushy eyebrows. His colors of cream and brown matched that of Tails as they were in the SatAM cartoon; when Tails was altered to his game appearance of yellow-orange and white, his family retained their brown tone. However, in recent appearances Amadeus has shifted more towards orange, in part to help distinguish him from the Acorn family characters, while his hair remains brown.

  <p key="d343f684-fd9d-4375-adb5-c4d6e76d6252">
   He usually wears some uniform in theme with the typical Acorn attire; blue and red with gold epaulettes, despite some variations in detail. His footwear for a time were boots in blue and white, but later became the more standard brown/red.

   There have been a number of conflicting statements regarding Amadeus' rank. In
   it states he was made Second-in-Command since Julian Kintobor was made
   Minister of Science

   is he called "commander". This website considers the following canon: Amadeus was a commander during the Great War, was promoted to general when it ended after Julian Kintobor became Minister of Science (Julian's remark was simply a mistake or meant as a derogatory insult, implying Amadeus was his subordinate) and maintained his rank of general until after his failed coup in ''
