   Shortly after her husband Max wound up hospitalized following an ill-fated attempt to rescue Elias from Robotropolis, Alicia awakened with her husband in a neighboring hospital bed and her children looking down at her. Unaffected mentally by the fifteen-year lapse, Alicia was welcomed warmly by her family, and was soon back on her feet - which was more than a now-paralyzed Max could say. She then found herself comforting her distraught children over the matter, especially Elias as he was appointed acting head-of-state due to Max's injury and her own need to catch up. With Sally as her guide, Alicia began touring Knothole, one of her first stops being a meeting with

Both monarchs and the young band of fighters were then surprised by the reappearance of Sonic, who had in fact survived his apparent demise and been rocketed across space and eventually made his way back home. Happy as this news was, it was tempered by Sonic's announcement of Eggman's plan to devastate Mobius with nuclear fallout. Once this information had been revealed, Sonic immediately inquired after Sally, and received the unsurprising news that she was at his supposed grave. When Eggman delivered his ultimatum regarding his deadly scheme, Alicia stood by her daughter in refusing to move to safety while Max remained in exposed Knothole where he would die if Eggman's plan succeeded.

Afterwards, she happily told Sonic of the celebration that had been organized in honor of his return, expressing continued happiness at the match between her daughter and Sonic. During the celebration, Max announced that he and Alicia would be departing the city on a world tour aboard the

Alicia's attempts to break down Sally's reluctance proved futile, and Max's tactless expression that he had always disapproved of the idea of Sally being together with Sonic drove her away in tears. Patch's poisoning soon had Max comatose, and Alicia finally convinced her daughter that she no longer had a choice, and so the wedding was arranged. To the surprise of all - and the infuriating of Patch - Elias returned to claim his throne, having been informed of the situation by Sonic, who had begged him to intervene.

   Due to his numerous traumas and his great displeasure concerning the kingdom's reformation, Max's condition began to deteriorate further. Alicia often found herself apologizing for Max's sour mood, later telling her husband that he couldn't continue to push people away. When Max admitted that he did want to see someone in particular, Alicia was momentarily encouraged, hoping he wished to speak with Elias or Sally, but Max instead asked her to fetch Geoffrey St. John. When St. John and Sonic later arrived, Max was initially somewhat cantankerous, which Alicia in part attributed to the stormy weather outside. (

   When Sally and Sonic decided to go on a date after a long time apart, Sally found herself flustered in trying to prepare for the evening. Alicia walked in as her daughter fretted over her clothing and hair, not able to offer much help since her own marriage was arranged. As Sally continued to worry, Alicia gently took her by the shoulders and suggested she simply be herself, as that was what had attracted Sonic in the first place. Still a bit unsure, Sally nonetheless thanked her mother, and the two embraced. (

Despite being barely coherent, Max refused, and Naugus' attempts to reason with him were halted by Alicia, who demanded that he leave them alone. Naugus started to object, retorting that he is the king, only to be reminded of Max's status as a beloved former king. Alicia then cuttingly noted that Naugus wasn't in the best of health himself, and demanded that he leave or risk pitting himself against guards still loyal to their former ruler. The wizard left, defeated, and Max thanked his wife for her actions, followed by a tearful embrace between the pair. (

   Alicia is an almost exact duplicate of her daughter Sally in terms of physical appearance, the only differences being Alicia's different hairstyle and the later addition of wrinkles to her face. In her youth, she was also the splitting image of Julayla. While in cryo, she was often depicted in a long vest-like garment and later, a plugsuit of sorts. She was briefly shown wearing a hospital gown and Sally's blue vest. Her attire usually consists of orange dresses accented in gold jewelry with a golden headpiece or tiara. One particular dress - featuring elaborate trims and a hood - was designed by artist J. Axer.

   The Queen loves her family deeply, and was particularly distressed when Elias ran away. While she wasn't completely pleased with her husband's attempts to marry Sally off, she also believed that certain traditions would leave Sally with little personal choice, having had a traditional royal marriage herself. As Max's condition deteriorates, she's become increasingly concerned with his attitude, particularly in regards to his relationship with his children.
