   After facing a series of battles and recruiting a number of allies, the heroes set out to defeat Sigma once and for all. Unfortunately, their victory over Sigma was a hollow one, as they discovered that his use of the Genesis Portals was threatening to destroy all of reality. Their efforts to close them failed, and all might have been lost had it not been for an unlikely hero: Xander Payne. Using the power of Sigma's
   Master Engine
   , he opened another portal of his own to the moment when Sigma was about to travel back in time. He then destroyed Sigma's virus form, thus undoing all the events of his conquest. Reality was thus repaired, but the Genesis Portals continued to exist, with Sticks theorizing the existence of a
   Genesis Nexus
   that connected all worlds. (

   The Genesis Portals are rifts in space and time that can presumably connect virtually any locations together, as well as any periods of time. While they appear to occur randomly, it is possible to create them using technology, as seen in the case of Sigma. Xander Payne's cybernetic eye also gained this ability due to previously being exposed to tachyons-it is unknown how his portals may differ from those that occur naturally. Sigma also discovered a means of combining the Genesis Portals with the power he absorbed from the Unity Engines to Time-Clone beings, though the process appears to have its limits. Closing Genesis Portals is also a difficult proposition: artificial ones can apparently be closed by their source, but if this is not done they will remain open. Silver's psychic abilities are the only other known means of closing them.
