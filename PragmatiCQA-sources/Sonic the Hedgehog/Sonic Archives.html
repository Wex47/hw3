When fired at Universalamander, however, the device is revealed to be an enlarger, which takes advantage of the FX Flip's effects to reduce Universalamander to molecular size. NICOLE predicts that similar strange events will continue to happen, which Sonic brushes off. Meanwhile, Robotnik fumes at the impromptu victory party being held by his henchmen.

    The series was launched to coincide with Sonic's 15th Anniversary in 2006.

    The covers for the series are drawn in the style of the classic Japanese Sega Sonic illustrations. Archiverse exclusive characters, such as the Freedom Fighters, while keeping their distinctive look, are slightly altered to resemble the small animals that are freed from destoying Badniks in the classic games, of which they are based (For example, Sally is made to resemble Ricky the Squirrel). Many other cameos and Easter-eggs relating to the classic games are also present on these covers, such as backdrop designs being based heavily on levels from the games, and the inclusion of the original Japanese design of Robotnik appearing in some form (though Robotnik himself retains his comic and SatAM design).
    <ul key="353eef71-9cd3-4c26-bb2d-4bbc46dd87c5">

      Despite the transition to the modern "Sonic Adventure" era from Volume 19 onwards, the cover art still retains the classic Japanese SegaSonic style from previous covers. However elements of characters modern day looks are still added: Sonic has been given his current green eyes, updated shoes, and made taller, while overall he still resembles his classic look in terms of art style. Interestingly, this also allows game characters who who didn't exist in the classic era to appear in this style, for example, Big the Cat appears on the cover of Volume 21, drawn in the same style, the first time this has ever been seen in any official media.

    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="81a7fc30-5076-4ed2-b86f-50bd0450d259">
    A number of canon discrepancies are included on the Sonic the Hedgehog Archives covers as the result of artistic license. For example,
    Buns Rabbot
    appears on the cover of #6 despite not appearing in the comics until issue #151. Several of the situations included on the cover art also never occurred in the comic itself, but this can all be attributed to the creative license of the cover artist.
   </li>
   <li key="0e4694a0-34af-4fee-a8d4-85e5e3bce6a6">
    When one compares the remastered art to the original source, many changes can be seen at a second glance. For example, Sonic's eyelids are now colored blue/indigo instead of the color of his muzzle, similar to his recent design. Shading is more prominent and noticeable especially on characters like Sally Acorn. Dr. Robotnik's body suit circle design is shaded black instead of red probably to match his SatAM counterpart. Various small or nearly unnoticeable changes also coexist to uplift the quality.
   </li>
   <li key="9b16c57e-4851-42b5-bbd9-f674ecd49f86">
    There are at least two editions of Sonic the Hedgehog Archives Vol. 1 and 2. The originals were printed with glossy covers and the newer versions had updated the back page with an extended list of the entries in the series.
   </li>
   <li key="43d6a006-3656-4c36-a03b-c1801ac5e8bc">
    Volumes 13, 17, 22 and 23 are currently the only volumes to include stories from other Archie Sonic titles outside the main series. Being dedicated entirely to the finale of Endgame, Volume 13 contains the "Directors Cut" edition of Sonic #50 as printed in SSS#6, "Down and Out in Downunda" from SSS#4, and "Total Re:Genesis" from SSS#5. Volume 17 contains "Spin City" from SSS#15 as an extra feature. Volume 22 includes all of SSS#13 as part of the Sonic Adventure storyline. And finally, Volume 23 features "Best of Times, Worst of Times" from SSS#14.
