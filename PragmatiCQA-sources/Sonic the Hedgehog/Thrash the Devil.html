After routing their forces and causing the Platypi to retreat, Thrash informed his team that he would be continuing his own quest and then departed via a lone

   Thrash's quest had reached an impasse of sorts, but this all changed when he and his devil-dog pack discovered the secret lair of Dr. Finitevus deep in the ruins of the
   Second Downunda Colony
   in
   Sandopolis
   on Angel Island. Once there, he found notes on the hidden Echidna homeland of

   and also discovered how to supercharge his warp ring. With this information, Thrash went to
   Shrine Isle
   and ambushed Julie-Su and
   Saffron
   who were guarding the Master Emerald, and once he charged his ring via the Emerald he trapped both of them in parts unknown. His first Echidna victim successfully sealed away, Thrash and his devil-dogs made their way to Albion where the last Echidna population in the world was under attack by

Thrash then went to the docks and, posing as help, guided the rest of the remaining Echidnas into another Zone while telling them to "hop on through, and you won't worry about nothin' again. Promise." While Thrash was getting rid of the final echidna, he was discovered by Knuckles and the recently-awakened Team Fighters. After Knuckles explained how he knew Thrash, the Tasmanian Devil explained how he used the Warp Ring he found to trap all of the echidnas, and then quickly was attacked by Knuckles, who Thrash blasted away with a sonic scream. Thrash told Knuckles he would let him live, but was then spin-dashed in the back by Sonic, who demanded that Thrash free the Echidnas. Thrash refused, and he and his pack began battling Sonic, Knuckles,

   Thrash quickly became Knuckles' opponent of choice, and the Devil took the opportunity to reveal to the
   Guardian
   his reasons for acting against the Echidnas: the crimes that their ancestors had committed in turning the race into Devil Dogs. He rejected Knuckles' assertions of the current Echidnas' innocence by asserting that of his own people when the Echidnas originally tampered with them, and explained that in his mind, he had settled the score. He revealed that his idea of doing so was leaving Knuckles as the last of his race, just as Thrash was; Knuckles quickly dismissed his notion as idiotic, and retorted that the Echidnas might have been able to help the Tasmanian Devils. Convinced that the scientific race would have repeated their crimes eventually, Thrash remained firm in his conviction. After Team Fighters managed to imprison his pack and Knuckles proved too skilled of an opponent for him to overcome through fisticuffs, Thrash employed his sonic howl instead. However, Knuckles fought his way through it, knocking Thrash to the ground with a punch. Just as Team Fighters was about to retrieve his Warp Ring, however, the
   Krudzu Hybrid Hydra
   /
   Metal Knuckles
   fusion attacked them. Taking advantage of the distraction, Thrash activated his Warp Ring in order to escape, but was pursued by Knuckles.(

   Still fighting ferociously, Knuckles shrugged off Thrash's blows, grabbing his opponent and throwing him through a nearby wall. Thrash landed in a room occupied by two more Devil Dogs with similar coloring to his own and an elderly Tasmanian Devil, who pointed an accusing finger at Knuckles. Thrash quickly recovered and blasted Knuckles with his howl again, before activating his Warp Ring and leading Knuckles on. Their battle continued in the
   White Acropolis Peaks
   , where another howl from Thrash set off an avalanche after a brief exchange of blows. Thrash escaped through his Warp Ring again, this time to
   Shrine Isle
   , where he promptly threw the ring off the island and jumped through it again to an unknown destination, leaving it to Knuckles, who was unable to use it to reach the Echidnas. (

   Thrash is rough, but fair with a strong-albeit warped-sense of justice, as seen by his willingness to let Knuckles live after exiling most of his fellow Echidnas. Unfortunately, he possesses a profound hatred of Echidnas since a rogue group of them turned most of the ancient
   Tasmanian Devil
   tribes into mindless dogs, and his people have passed down a tradition of hatred towards the Echidnas with no distinction made between those actually responsible and the rest of the species. In fact, Thrash's sole goal in life is to find and take revenge on the Echidnas who devastated his kind-a goal which he eventually succeeded in. Dr. Finitevus referred to Thrash as a "failed experiment", possibly meaning that to him, a mindless Tasmanian Devil is more useful than an intelligent one.
  </p>
  <p key="51085f61-69dd-4409-ad5d-be183c27c603">
   Thrash is a bit rough around the edges and holds a deep desire for revenge, but usually acts somewhat easy going. He does possess some measure of noble ideals, as shown by his willingness to join the Downunda Freedom Fighters in battling the Legion and his initial kindness to Team Fighters upon finding them unconscious in Albion. However, he has a very short temper-particularly in the face of Finitevus' taunts and jabs at the state of his species-and seems to enjoy fighting. Even more tragically, he fails to recognize that the modern Echidnas were not responsible for the deeds of a handful of their distant ancestors, and makes no effort to distinguish between heroic Echidnas like Knuckles and Julie-Su and villainous ones like Finitevus and Lien-Da.  Due to being the sole member of his species, he is an expert survivalist and formidable fighter.

   Thrash is gifted with considerable strength on par with that of Knuckles, able to take on Wing Dingoes with his bare hands. His fighting technique is far from skilled, though, as
   Barby Koala
   apparently views his ability in combat as unprofessional, referring to him as a thug. Furthermore, Knuckles was able to defeat him in their initial battles, indicating that Thrash is not as skilled a fighter as Knuckles. He is able to project his voice as a kind of sonic attack, strong enough to break down some objects and send multiple enemies flying. (

   Thrash is a large, purple-furred Mobian with yellow eyes, a furry beige muzzle, and a jagged white-fur pattern on his chest reminiscent of the

   birthmark. The fur on his head resembles a cross between Sonic's quills and Knuckles' dreadlocks. His attire consists of green gloves and shoes with metal squares on the gloves and metal bands across the instep of the feet, with circular bumps protruding from them. The gloves and shoes also come with black cuffs, with the gloves' having white lines bisecting the black.
