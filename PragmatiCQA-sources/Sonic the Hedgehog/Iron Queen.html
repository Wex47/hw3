   Mount Stormtop

She then fled the scene, returning to the Iron Fortress. Sonic, Tails and Monkey Khan pursued her, and after making their way into the Iron Fortress, Sonic managed to obtain the
   Fan of Fen Xing

   The following day, upon learning Dr. Eggman escaped, Regina seethed that she would not allow her plans to be foiled by him. After dispatching Conquering Storm to keep the other clans in the Dragon Kingdom in line, Regina set out with the Iron King, Dark Egg Legion and Yagyu to recapture Dr. Eggman. They arrived just in time to find the mad despot in the custody of Sonic and Tails, whereupon Regina ordered they both surrender. To her frustration, Sonic instead engaged the Iron Dominion while Tails dragged Dr. Eggman back to New Mobotropolis, and Regina ordered the Iron King to finish the fight. After he knocked Sonic down, Regina hoped that the hedgehog would prove a valuable bargaining chip in exchange for Dr. Eggman, but the Freedom Fighters arrived as reinforcements. They managed to damage the Iron King's armor and destroyed Regina's &amp; Snivley's Egg Mobiles before retreating to New Mobotropoils. The Iron Dominion gave chase but NICOLE activated the shield, keeping them out, while Monkey Khan and Bunnie taunted that the Iron Dominion's victory blew up in their face. Regina swore revenge before taking her forces back to New Megaopolis. Later Snively visited Regina's bed chambers to comfort her. Her response was that if he ever wanted to enter her chambers again, he must find a way past the shield over New Mobotropolis and slammed the door on him. That evening she promoted

   Regina is as cruel, manipulative and evil as any other villain on Mobius, but has shown a streak of humanity in her relationship with Snively. Indeed, the very fact she's capable of love makes her far more human than her former leader, Dr. Eggman, and his various incarnations. This being said, her more human side seems reserved for Snively alone. Still, she is far less cold and emotionless than villains like Mammoth Mogul or Dr. Finitevus; she has shown both easy joy and rage and doesn't make much effort to hide her feelings.

When Eggman recovered, however, he told Snively that Regina is a manipulator, and is possibly only using him to achieve her goals.

    While her age is not stated anywhere one can assume she is somewhere in her late twenties or early thirties from the fact that she was a young girl before being exiled, appearing to be in her teens when joining forces with Jun Kun and then taking into account the ten year interval of Robotnik Prime`s rule. Between twenty five and thirty is a reasonable time frame.

    Oddly, despite her use of dark magic, the Iron Queen was not tracked down and eliminated by
    Sir Connery
    ; possibly it is because her power is derived from

   Designed by writer/artist Frank Strom, the Iron Queen has pale skin, gold eyes and long, dark green hair. She wears a large golden headdress and a red dress/robe with a pattern of pointed black stripes. In her initial appearance, her face was heavily shadowed and her hair was worn down; since her reappearance, her hair is kept in a high ponytail and she gained technologically-themed cuffs on her wrists and ankles. She is often depicted with red eye makeup and green lipstick. When younger, she lacked the headdress and wore a similar hooded robe with a hexagonal clasp.
