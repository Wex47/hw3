   bombarded the planet
   with Gene Bombs, which were supposed to wipe out the human race and maintain the rest of the planet's environment as it was at the time. However, the Gene Bombs instead de-evolved some of the human population, creating Overlanders. (

   Unlike their Mobian counterparts, who wished to preserve the environment and therefore remained locked in the medieval age for centuries, the Overlanders hit the industrial and atomic ages, developing their capital city of
   Megapolis
   in the North-Western hemisphere, and coming under the rule of a dictator-like
   Overlord

   For all their modern advancements, the Overlanders were also known to experiment in the occult science of techno-sorcery.
   Mega Central

This type of magic enabled the caster to manipulate electronic impulses that ran through the air and thereby control any kind of device that was electrically operated, including something as advanced as a mechanoid. However, the danger of a skill such as this in a society that depended so heavily on technology became quite obvious, and

Sometime during their sojourn, the Overlanders' ships encountered a Xorda battle cruiser, which attacked them as they fled for safe space. This resulted in the Xorda following the ships back to Mobius and discovering life still survived on the former human homeworld, causing them to stage

   Overlanders are most commonly confused as humans due to their physical similarities, however, the two species have many differences, both physically and mentally. Unlike humans, who are generally friendly and accepting of Mobians, Overlanders generally hold grudges - and in many cases feelings of outright speciesism and prejudice - towards Mobians. This is partially due to the Great War, though the Overlanders' distrust and dislike of the Mobians far pre-dates the war. It seems their government was a dictatorship.  (

   Overlanders, particularly those in government or military jobs (including the sciences) frequently fashion an all-gray body suit. Overlander troops were typically seen wearing this attire during the Great War. Julian Kintobor was wearing one during his escape through the
   Badlands
   , and Colin Kintobor, a former judge, continued to wear one throughout and long after the Great War. (

   Overlanders do not generally share in Mobian's consideration for the environment. While the Kingdom of Acorn deliberately remained in a pre-industrial state to preserve nature, the Overlanders pursued the use of fossil fuels, resulting in massive pollution in their cities. (

   Hope Kintobor
   can also be considered a friendly Overlander, as she is the only Overlander who lived in the Kingdom of Knothole, wanting to stay there after coming to appreciate the way the people there lived their lives.

   also tried to befriend the Mobian prince Emerson Acorn, but their differences resulted in Emerson's accidental death. Lupe Wolf adopted two Overlander children and she raises them as her own children. However, due to the antagonistic relationships between Mobians and Overlanders, good Overlanders have been faced with prejudice and anti-Overlander speciesism from Mobians.

    Due to differences in artists, the numbers of fingers among characters often differed between four and five (as four are commonly used in cartooning). However, with the influence of the

    games came the distinction of humans being depicted with five fingers (as characters in the games always have five); this was acknowledged within the comic itself, where it was stated that Overlanders have four whereas humans have five in an attempt to explain the artistic difference. However, this distinction was not reinforced amongst the comic staff and was not consistently maintained, and seems to have been abandoned entirely.
