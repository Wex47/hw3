   Before they would deliver their plan to the Echidna Council, Dimitri and Edmund confronted
   Menthor
   , the High Councilor (and the ancestor of future High Councilor
   Pravda
   ) in an attempt to gain his support. However, Menthor realized that if the plan went through, Dimitri would be considered a hero, and this could upset his own plans and ambitions, thus he denounced the plan as "heresy" and denied the brothers' petition. Dimitri was shocked, and took his plan to the Council anyways, hoping he could win over the support of the rest of the Council. Without Menthor's support however, the plan was again denied. (

   Enraged by this, Dimitri decided to take actions into his own hands. Using the Chaos Syphon, the powers of 11 out of the 12 Chaos Emeralds were slowly drained, but an unforeseen effect occurred; the power of the Emeralds was sent into Dimitri. The result was the initial creation of the seemingly omnipotent being that would come to be known in the present day as Enerjak, after a legendary evil force. (

   , the walls of which were apparently impervious to Chaos attacks and powers. However, the
   Fire Ants

   Despite being buried, Dimitri was still alive, and used a form of telepathy to communicate with his son, who visited the burial site frequently. Dimitri convinced him to follow in his footsteps and finish what he had started. Menniker went on to create the Dark Legion with the aims of restoring technology into Echidna society and returning their city to the surface of Mobius. While two Dark Legionnaires did kill Edmund, the first ever Guardian, his son Steppenwolf replaced him. After being trained by the Fire Ant
   Christopheles

   Shortly after this, Dimitri drastically changed his views, no doubt due to having been stripped of his Chaos powers and slowly regaining his sanity from the Chaos energy induced madness that made him Enerjak in the first place, as well as his realization his life was nearing its end. He tried to put an end to the long standing war between the Legion and the rest of Echidna society by proposing a reunification to the Echidna Council.

   When Dimitri's health took a turn for the worse, he was immobilized and connected to a life support machine to keep him alive. Lien-Da assisted him in a plan to convince Knuckles to use his immense powers to give Dimitri new life. Firm in his belief that the Dark Legion must reunify with the rest of Echidna society, he made Lien-Da promise to continue his policies should he die. The plan to use Knuckles' power to save Dimitri failed due to interference from Mammoth Mogul, who tried to steal Knuckles's powers for himself.

Dimitri showed great regret for his past actions, lamenting his current state, and while NICOLE explained that Dimitri had been preparing himself to speak with Knuckles, Dimitri admitted that he actually feared facing him at all. He explained that NICOLE and Espio had displayed something he should have never ignored: the love and support of friends. For the moment, though, he turned back to NICOLE to help her with her problems, and explained that she had grown well beyond being a mere program; he told her that she would need to stand up for herself and face the public's scorn. However, he also said that telling someone else to have courage wasn't the same as actually possessing it; knowing that he would never be "ready," and knowing that given his past actions he had no right, he nonetheless asked Espio to arrange a meeting with Knuckles so that they could finally talk. Feeling he was in no position to deny someone else a second chance, Espio agreed to do so with NICOLE's support. (

   Espio and NICOLE then approached Knuckles and brought him to speak with Dimitri. Although upset, Knuckles listened as he let Dimitri apologize for all of his past failures and mistakes. After Dimitri's and Knuckles' discussion about the current state of the Legion in Lien-Da's control, Dimitri was then told by Knuckles that he was to be transferred to the remains of Haven and connected to its systems in order to start helping him "fix" their race's situation that he had created. The plan was more than Dimitri had hoped for and he readily complied, happily thanking his distant relative for the chance at redemption. (

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="0be9c005-0137-4165-9008-c6a7ecabc956">
   Dimitri's personality was greatly affected by his long existence. Originally, he was an eager, confident scientist whose intellect sometimes gave him too much pride and a sense of self-righteousness. He also had a strong stubborn streak. As Enerjak, he was completely insane, making him dangerously unpredictable. Arrogant and cruel, he believed his actions irrevocably justified and had little regards for others, sometimes displaying sadistic tendencies. Stemming from his original pride, he was quick to anger and would greatly desire revenge and retribution should he feel wronged in any way.
  </p>
  <p key="20ba8367-6dec-4d73-928e-2feef322b647">
   However, after losing his power as Enerjak, Dimitri became a smoother operator and a more rational being; however, he still felt justified in many of his less-than-pleasant actions and sometimes showed ruthlessness, and he wasn't above using people as pawns if needed. Still, he generally retained a sense of respect for others, even his opponents, and a gentlemanly air. In time, he began to desire a more unified existence, from making peace in his own family to reuniting the Echidna people, a goal made difficult by opposition on both sides. As time went on, however, Dimitri abandoned his goals of world domination, and even became somewhat repentant. As his health degenerated, he still showed some desire to regain his former power, though when given the chance, he turned it down. He became increasingly concern for the safety of his people and went to great lengths to protect them.
  </p>
  <p key="016656b0-8859-4ac2-8b03-f6dc08327c30">
   Ultimately, a final betrayal left him helpless and near-death, he realized that many of his past actions were horrific and had directly been the result of his stubbornness and ego. He realized that while he had always felt family was important, he had ignored outside help and support, and because of this, he had been left with nothing. With the admission of his past mistakes came fear of facing those he had wronged. Eventually he reconciled with Knuckles however and agreed to become an ally to the Guardian.

  <p key="6c1e4842-ad56-4471-963c-8fdac33d4094">
   Dimitri is currently the remains of an ancient Echidna kept alive through cybernetics; his visual appearance has changed multiple times, often drastically. His initial appearances were somewhat generic (featuring, oddly enough, one or two Guardian rings on the chest), but his design was eventually established as an Echidna wearing a long shirt with a long, hexagonal front, white gloves, and boots; his dreadlocks were striped and partially wrapped around the others.
  </p>
  <p key="789ba8e2-5d13-4015-a522-6113b191a6c3">
   When he first gained his Chaos powers, he was depicted as a glowing green Echidna, almost a silhouette. He later adopted the more well-known Enerjak appearance consisting of blue and gold Egyptian-themed armor. Losing his power, his face was revealed as that of an extremely old man with spotted skin, wrinkles and tattered, thin dreadlocks. In order to preserve his life, much of his body was replaced with cybernetics; initially, this complicated and detailed design featured somewhat haphazardly-arranged, mismatched mechanics. His right hand resembled three large clamps; one foot featured two long "toes." His left eye was triangular and protruded slightly from the face. Many of the numerous wires, panels and beads were dropped over time.
  </p>
  <p key="7ec8f380-f5a2-42ae-a8e9-3f9d72868bbf">
   As his body and health further degenerated, he was reduced to little more than a head in a floating glass orb; the orb was eventually upgraded with dreadlocks-like tentacles ending in small clamps, giving him extra mobility and dexterity. With these he was able to interact with various forms of machinery, at one point taking control of a massive, scorpion-like battle vehicle. Eventually, he lost the glass orb and was reduced to being installed atop a shelf-like structure.

   , a polymath with skill in numerous fields. Patient and charismatic, he knows when to play subservient and when to assert himself, allowing him to successfully deal with most individuals on a personal level. In spite of his tendency towards scheming and underhandedness, and an occasional willingness to (somewhat grudgingly) betray his own morals in order to accomplish necessary goals, in his present form he's been shown to be both remorseful of his actions and also compassionate towards others.
  </p>
  <p key="e2bf9819-4998-4088-aaa8-a8d95e97d3bf">
   As Enerjak, he was cruel, violent, insane and self-centered, yet believed himself to be the only Echidna to possess true strength and bravery, apparently considering others to have been morally weak and thus worthy of scorn. In terms of ability, he was essentially omnipotent, able to seemingly defy reality and even manipulate objects on a molecular level.

   When his centuries-old body began to fail him, it was increasingly replaced with cybernetics. Eventually, this left him little more than a brain in a robotic head, equipped with tendrils able to interact directly with various computers and pieces of machinery. A notable example of this was a praying-mantis like body that he plugged into during one battle, though the construct was subsequently destroyed.
