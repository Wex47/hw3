   The two continued to battle each other in the Green Hill Zone, and Mega Man continued to note with confusion that Sonic was registering as an organic being on his sensors. He dismissed the notion based on Sonic's incredible speed-beyond that of his old foes

   Nitro Man
   and
   Flash Man

In the midst of the fighting, another Warp Ring opened up-courtesy of Dr. Light-which Mega Man recognized as a means of returning home. The distraction cost him, as Sonic was able to remove an essential component of his Mega Buster, rendering it useless. Recognizing the need for repairs, as well as to keep Sonic in his sights, he decided to trick Sonic into following him through the portal, which worked like a charm. Arriving back in Mega City, Mega Man expressed his appreciation for his father's efforts, surprising Sonic-though not as much as he did by calling his allies

   With assistance from his robotic friends, Mega Man quickly turned the tables on Sonic, repairing his Mega Buster and gaining an aerial advantage with help from both Beat and Rush while Tango attacked the Hedgehog directly. Sonic attempted to break away from the fight, and in pursuing him Mega Man recognized the potential danger to civilians by their struggle. He tried to reason with Sonic again, only to be informed that the Hedgehog had no knowledge of the bank heist. Sonic also accused him of kidnapping several of his friends, which Mega Man likewise denied. Panicking that they're catching on, the doctors commanded Tails Man to intervene, prompting the blue heroes to form a truce to protect the civilians. After performing a duel strike-Mega Man's Mega Buster shot followed by Sonic's

   -Tails Man was left paralyzed, allowing Mega Man to absorb his weapons data, inadvertently restoring the young fox back to his original form. After recovering from his disorientation, Tails explained that he was kidnapped, not by Mega Man (as Sonic immediately assumed) but by Metal Sonic and a similar looking purple and gold robot, who Mega Man immediately recognized as his fierce rival

   The three heroes reasoned that everything they'd just been through was planned by the doctors, to which Sonic simply responded that they should go and "kick some doctor butt", leaving Mega Man astounded at the hedgehog's nonchalant attitude toward the fact that they attempted to kill each other just minutes before (as well as being worried over how his programming-to not harm life-was compromised). Recognizing the misunderstanding, and to show his appreciation for saving Tails, the blue heroes patched things up with a handshake, before deciding that they should head over to Light Labs to find out where the doctors were hiding; returning to find Dr. Light being carried away through a warp ring by Bass and Metal Sonic! After introducing Sonic and Tails to his siblings, they managed to pinpoint the doctors location.

Copy Robot claimed that their equal abilities made it so that Mega Man couldn't win, but Mega Man unleashed a surprise: the Tails Wind ability he had gained upon Tails' restoration to normal. This ability downed Copy Robot and then allowed Mega Man to aid his friends in defeating the Genesis Unit. Both he and Proto Man then discussed the unsettling presence of their old foes, whom they explained to Sonic and Tails had been destroyed with no known means of being recreated. This left them worried about what Eggman and Wily were capable of, but with no other options they pressed on along with Rush, Sonic, and Tails. The heroes soon ran into their next obstacle: the assembled might of all eight remaining Roboticized Masters. (

   In his civilian form Rock, Mega Man resembles a young human boy with brown hair and blue eyes. He wears a blue shirt with short white sleeves, black pants, and blue boots that he retains as Mega Man. Upon transforming for battle, he gains light blue armor around his wait, a blue helmet with light blue squares on it that leaves his face exposed, and blue gauntlets and gloves. He can also transform his forearms into his signature weapon, the Mega Buster. His armor changes colors when he equips the weapons of other Robot Masters or Roboticized Masters:

    Before Archie Comics had even acquired the rights to create the Mega Man comic series, Mega Man himself had made a few "Easter Egg" appearances in some Archie Sonic issues, mostly in artwork by Patrick Spaziante (who was also working as a penciller on a different American Mega Man comic at the time). Some cameos include:
