   caused an uprising that was quickly quelled by the robots guarding the camp. While Mighty and Ray were locked up in isolation, Fiona was taken away for another purpose. Not long after, a young Sonic the Hedgehog (who was investigating the camp as one of his early Freedom Fighting missions) arrived and freed both Mighty and Ray. (

   The three then went out in an attempt to rescue Fiona but ultimately failed to free her. Due to the mysterious disappearance of Ray, Mighty went berserk and began trashing the facility, forcing Robotnik to abandon it. Fiona was taken away by Robotnik when he fled and relocated to a new facility built exactly the same as the previous one. While there, she was used as the basis for the first of Robotnik's many
   robotic replicas
   designed to infiltrate the Freedom Fighters. Soon after creating the
   robotic duplicate
   , Robotnik left the real Fiona to die in a prison cell. (

   After a long period of imprisonment, Fiona realized that no one would rescue her, and thus she became determined to do so herself. Through long, grueling attempts, she managed to dig an escape tunnel from her cell over a period of at least two years, eventually reaching freedom outside. The first person she encountered was
   Nic the Weasel
   , who was scavenging in the area. Failing to locate her family, Fiona came to believe that they had abandoned her, and determined to strike out on her own. She also came to harbor a deep grudge towards Sonic and Mighty for what she perceived as them abandoning her to her fate. (

   Fiona remained somewhat embittered by her past encounter with Sonic and Mighty. This became apparent after Nic decided to gain Mighty's assistance to gain access to the laboratory, as Fiona explained how she felt abandoned by the two and blamed them for her long imprisonment. While exploring the camp, they discovered several unused robotic replicas of the Freedom Fighters. Eventually, they reached the door, and Mighty forced it open. Inside, they discovered a Power Gem - as well as Ray, who had apparently been stuck in a form of suspended animation by the gem. Despite herself, Nic destroyed the gem in order to free Ray. (

Amy, enraged that anyone would betray Sonic's heart, sought out and attacked Fiona. While dodging blows, Fiona feigned confusion, though briefly slipped in a smug grin and told Amy no one would believe her anyway. To the surprise of both, Sonic casually butted in and told Fiona he wanted to talk. As they walked, he confronted her about lying and her disappearances. She became indignant, but all was soon explained when Scourge showed up; Fiona was in love with the evil hedgehog. When Evil Sonic had infiltrated Knothole Village, he had hit on several of the girls there, including Fiona, before being ousted. Fiona, having realised that she'd fallen for a fake, tried to find the same attraction in the real Sonic and thus began to date him. Unfortunately, she found him too "vanilla" for her tastes; she preferred Scourge's dark side and began to sneak off with him. (

She gently told him that despite his intellect, he didn't realize one thing - "you can't count on anybody." She then slapped him across the face. Sonic, enraged at her cruelty, protested, and Fiona cited his abandonment of her, back in the mining camp, as an example. Shortly after a brief battle, she and Scourge then escaped via Warp Ring. (

   Fiona reappeared not too long afterward, sporting a new look and taking up a role as one of Dr. Finitevus' agents. Together with Scourge, she came bearing bad news: not only had the
   Dingo Regime
   decided to attack Echidnaopolis, but the warring factions of the Dark Legion under Lien-Da and Remington had put aside their conflict to stop Finitevus' plans to resurrect Enerjak, the arch-nemesis of Knuckles the Echidna. While Finitevus left to complete his work, Scourge sat down to relax while Fiona bristled at the situation, clearly disliking the albino Echidna as much as Rouge had in her brief time in the doctor's service. She didn't have long to complain, however, before the new Enerjak made his awe-inspiring debut right in front of her and Scourge. Fiona played a part in the recreation of this awesome figure, as she and Scourge had worked with the other Destructix to knock out Knuckles the Echidna when he returned to Angel Island, and delivered him to Dr. Finitevus whose plans finally came together to make a new Enerjak out of the original's greatest foe.

She and her allies would soon be forced to defend it from Knuckles' father Locke, Sonic, and Julie-Su. Though the battle was intense-not to mention an opportunity for Fiona to point out that Sonic and his allies had often beaten their foes either because of superior numbers or because their enemies had been ordered to lose-it ended quite abruptly when Sonic destroyed the weapon and the Destructix left, not sure of what to do next. The battle between Super Sonic and Enerjak decided for them, and Fiona left Mobius in Scourge's company as the green Hedgehog set out to find his true self, while the Destructix fled through a different Warp Ring.

   Fiona is a determined fighter, eager to oppose evil since her capture at the hands of Robotnik. Somewhat prideful, she tends to hold grudges, such as against Rouge the Bat, who defeated her and the other members of Nic's gang in an illegal fighting tournament, and towards Sonic and Mighty the Armadillo for failing to save her when she was captured by Robotnik as a child. She has a history of mild illegal activity, including robbery. She is also extremely clever, and has an acute memory. However, she is clearly reluctant to talk about her past, most likely due to her feelings of abandonment.

This in part comes from the fact that Scourge has no expectations of her other than to "have fun."

   Fiona Fox is red with a pale yellow front, muzzle and tail-tip. Her short hair is generally brown, though it sometimes ranges towards auburn and red. In her initial design, her hair completely obscured her ears. She wore long white gloves, yellow boots and a dagger on a belt. Her depictions as a child generally match this, only lacking the belt and blade. Her eyes are usually blue, though they have occasionally been depicted as gray. She is almost always shown wearing a yellow bow in her hair.

   Later, Fiona was most often shown wearing a yellow-orange zip-up leotard with a white stripe down the front and silver cuffs at the head, leg and arm holes. With this she wore matching boots and white gloves, and her hair was restyled, making her ears visible. She briefly sported an outfit that included a long, high-collared black trench coat, heavy black boots, and a shirt depicting a broken heart; this design, created by artist Jeff Axer, saw little use. Fiona’s design was later changed again, by artist Tracy Yardley, giving her an all-black outfit consisting of a crop top, pants/boots, long fingerless gloves, and studded belts. The yellow on her belly was dropped at this point. Her hair adopted a more fanned-out style but retained the yellow hair-bow.

   During her brief time in Zone Jail, Fiona wore the same orange uniform and gold metal collar as the other prisoners, though she tied her shirt in the front. She also briefly wore Scourge's jacket, with his sunglasses perched atop her head.

   Fiona is both a swift and agile fighter due to her time as a former bounty hunter and Freedom Fighter. In battle, she has managed to hold her own against different opponents in hand-to-hand combat and many forms of martial arts. As a former Freedom Fighter, she was also both a proficient technician and medic. She also showed some tactical skills as the former second-in-command of the Suppression Squad and the current leader of the Destructix, having helped plan the invasion of Freedom HQ and the assault on the Raiju Clan's stronghold, respectively.

   , Fiona believed her long-standing resentment about Sonic was unfounded. After Sonic returned from outer space and his break up with Sally Acorn, Fiona found herself growing closer to Sonic emotionally. She became romantically attached to Scourge while he was impersonating Sonic in the prime zone, but once this was discovered, she attempted to find the same attraction within the prime reality's version. After realizing Scourge's selfish and brash attitude appealed to her more, and that Sonic had none of these qualities, Fiona finally revealed that she was in love with Scourge, and broke up with Sonic.

Sonic explained his going out with Fiona and sincerely apologized, thus calming Tails down and re-establishing their friendship. (

   Scourge and Fiona's relationship became stronger with time, as Scourge, giving up his womanizing ways, stayed loyal to her even when it would have been more profitable to save his own skin, and their relationship is almost a twin to that of Sonic's and Sally's-though of course with the differences that come with their personalities. Following their arrival on Anti Mobius, and their invasion, Scourge announced Fiona as his Queen. (

   Fiona, for her part, allowed herself to become more attached to Scourge than possibly any other character in the series. She is truly loyal to him (although she at first denies it), physically defending him even when it would have been far easier to abandon Scourge, or join the Freedom Fighters and other Suppression Squad members in their joint attack on him. Her loyalty is further shown when she went to great lengths to break Scourge out of jail; taking the time to recruit the

Although Penders helped recreate Fiona but the initial character, Auto-Fiona was originally created by Michael Gallagher and Penders has stated that he does not want to claim a character he did not create.
