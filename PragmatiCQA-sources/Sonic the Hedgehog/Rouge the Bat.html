   Rouge and Omega were forced to battle Shadow, and managed to break him free from the spell he was under. They then went to the aid of Spider Troupe while he went after Black Death, and were forced to engage Eclipse the Darkling in battle. However, Eclipse was pulled from the fight by
   Death's Eye

   The unlikely trio soon located Eclipse's downed vessel in
   Red Mountain
   , though Rouge found time to question whether or not Knuckles was happy with his life on the island. Noting that her own chosen profession wasn't all-consuming as Knuckles' duty seemed to be, Rouge became curious whether or not Knuckles wanted anything else in his life. Unfortunately, they were then alerted to an attack on the Master Emerald Shrine by Eclipse, and flew back to help Shadow only to find that he had managed to drive Eclipse off for the time being. Shadow then stunned his teammates-and enraged Knuckles-by insisting that the Master Emerald be transported to a G.U.N. facility for safe-keeping while Knuckles and his friends were evacuated. Knuckles responded by engaging the Hedgehog in battle, with Rouge refusing either to interfere or to go along with Shadow's plan, as she felt that Knuckles should have a say in the matter. However, Eclipse then arrived with the Dark Arms, disabling Omega with
   Blurk
   before calling upon
   Cregal
   's powers to battle Rouge in the air. With her shoulder dislocated, Snively's pod destroyed, and Relic and Fixit at Eclipse's mercy, Rouge revealed the location of the craft she and her teammates had arrived on. As Eclipse left with the Master Emerald, Rouge then mused on their desperate straits. (

   After having Omega pop her shoulder back into place, Rouge responded to a hail from Shadow, and informed him that Eclipse had obtained the Emerald and was on his way to their shuttle. Once Shadow and Knuckles had been thoroughly chastened for their pig-headedness, they moved to intercept Eclipse while Rouge and the others entered a secret enclave to activate some of the island's traps. Their efforts slowed Eclipse down long enough for Shadow and Knuckles to catch him, and Knuckles once again shattered the Master Emerald to keep it from the two intruding forces. Eclipse managed to escape, but G.U.N. forces soon arrived to collect his old escape craft under Snively's supervision. Rouge wished Knuckles luck in his efforts to recover the Emerald shards, and was then amused when the Echidna instructed her to "Tell Shadow he's a jerk." (

After being informed by Amy that Nixus was actually Walter Naugus in disguise, the three set off and found Knuckles, only for Crystal Omega to suddenly attack them all. After much fighting and struggling, Rouge and her allies finally broke Walter's magical grip on Omega and were about to confront the vile wizard himself when he, having fully restored the Master Emerald, encased them in solid crystal. Delighted with himself, Walter fled with Amy and the Master Emerald in tow, although Rouge and her teammates were broken free by Knuckles, who had freed himself. The four caught up to Naugus and directly engaged him, while also keeping him away from the Master Emerald. (

   Rouge is a white bat with teal eyes. She has a voluptuous figure with an ample set of breasts. Her muzzle and torso are somewhat tan, though often coloured as light as Sonic's peach arms and front. Her dark wings are often coloured black or purple. Her short white hair flares out at the back and she typically wears blue eyeshadow, as well as lipstick on occasion. Her typical attire consists of dark skintight pants, a pink, heart-shaped chestplate-like top with white trim, and tall white gloves and boots with pink cuffs. The boots are high heeled and feature hearts on the toes.

  <p key="f4698b5c-c187-4253-9814-3866a704de4a">
   Rouge is a strong-minded young woman, a fearless, ambitious, independent, flirtatious, greedy, ruthless, calculating narcissist who most people see as only caring for herself and her gems. Despite this, she can be helpful and affectionate in her own way, usually towards a select few. She's not above using seduction and manipulation to get what she wants, and is willing to be dishonest and even treacherous should the situation require it with little if any qualms. She's fully aware of her image and will often appear to be sweet when at her most cruel. However, she has, on occasion, shown that she can be heroic and a touch ethical, even if it meant sacrificing something she really wanted to get her hands on.

  <p key="830bf05c-0025-4512-97d3-55e967687595">
   Despite her many past misdeeds, Rouge doesn't linger on her past, preferring to move forward to new opportunities. While she covers it up with a sassy, sarcastic demeanor, Rouge does possess a caring side beyond her thieving, double-dealing ways. While underhanded, she is also usually capable of recognizing true evil when she sees it. Of course, her care is usually reserved for those close to her, at the expense of all others-including entire worlds. Furthermore, she still seems to have little to no respect for her position as an agent, and has been shown willing to accept bribes from other parties.

   Since their first encounter, Rouge has kept up a love/hate relationship with Knuckles, revolving around their rivalry as treasure hunters and over possession of the Master Emerald. While she has primarily expressed interest in the jewel, she does possess some real feelings for Knuckles, questioning whether a life of duty and isolation is truly what he wants and respecting his claims on the Master Emerald. Despite this, she also enjoyed teasing him, jokingly threatening to steal the Emerald and questioning whether or not he was involved with Relic. Interestingly, she apparently didn't regard Relic as a threat to her relationship with Knuckles.

   Mephiles
   , she swore to always stand by him. This does not mean that she doesn't at times find him infuriating, though she's not above making jabs at him. Despite this, she does care deeply about him, and seeks to help him in whatever circumstances.
