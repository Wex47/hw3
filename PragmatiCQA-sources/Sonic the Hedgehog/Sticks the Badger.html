In panic, Sticks hurried out and found Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy and told them that Tails' house had been "robbed". However, it was first when Sticks brought her friends to the former site of Tails' house that they understand what she meant and she explained what had happened to the house. While her friends tried to make a plan, Sticks found the Rock-cyborg's footprints and began following them while sniffing the grass out of enjoinment (which gave the others the impression that she had picked up the robot's scent). When she finally cleared up the misunderstanding though, she had lead the whole group to the Rock-cyborg. There, Sticks climbed up on the top of the Rock-cyborg to check Tails' gutters for "illegal wire taps" as Sonic was leading it into an ambush. There, she met Tails who told her to get to safety, but she believed she would be safer up here. As Amy and Knuckles crippled the Rock-cyborg, Sticks and Tails struck it from behind and made it fall, giving Sonic the chance to destroy it and bring Tails' house back on its foundation. With the battle over, Sticks was liking how the Rock-cyborg's remains adorned the surroundings.(

   mech with Sonic, Tails and Amy. During the battle, Knuckles attacked and trapped his own team, claiming he worked with Eggman now because he got tired of Amy criticizing him. Sticks however, got ahead of Knuckles and trapped herself in her own cage. Sticks and the other were then loaded into the Big Boy's cargo hold, where Knuckles revealed to them that he was faking being Eggman's ally to fool the doctor. Once Knuckles left to defeat Eggman (after Amy and Tails convinced him that his plan was brilliant despite its flaws), Sticks freed Sonic who in turn broke them out of the Big Boy as Knuckles made it retreat. Shortly after the team took care of

   Sticks, beside Tails and Knuckles watched as Amy sobbed into Sonic's scarf after losing her hammer during Eggman's attack. To put a stop to it, she kicks Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles out of the house to go search for it while she helps Amy find a replacement for it. Sticks lets her try out her arsenal, her boomerang and stick, but Amy fails to be able to control them. Eventually, Sonic finds the hammer and Sticks goes home to which she discovers something that's -- the "ultimate power." Later, Sticks brought this "ultimate power" to use against Eggman when the villain attacked the heroes with Big Boy, upgraded for the third and final time. Sticks announced that this power was grafted in "the era before time" to ensure "the light always drove back the darkness". After years of searching Sticks has finally found the single most powerful relic in the world...
   The Rock of Justice
   ! Heroes and villain alike were unimpressed at the seemingly inanimate stone, and continued their battle, as Sticks continuously pleaded that they use the rock, to no avail. Frustrated at her friends ignorance, Sticks showed them all just what the stone could do: by hurling it at Big Boy and, in a quick series of miraculously timed events, the rock bounded all over the place, causing immense damage to Big Boy, bringing about its final, explosive destruction! Sticks hailed the powerful "Rock of Justice" in her hands as her friends looked on, flabbergasted, and Eggman fled, embarrassed at his latest defeat. As the heroes admitted that she was right all along, Sticks was then heartbroken to discover that the rock had used up all of its power. After mourning the loss of the fallen "hero", Sticks took the rock home and, after thanking it one last time, nonchelantly tossed it into her rock pile. (

   Sticks, along with her friends, later attended the Egg-toberfest festival, which Eggman had thrown at his lair in order to gain the trust of Bygone Island's residents and take advantage of their false sense of security, where she helped out in stopping the impending robot attack that the doctor unleashed upon the festival-goers.

   Soon after, Sticks objected greatly to Sonic facing Eggman in the first ever Go-Kart Pan-Island Grand Prix, seeing the event as an obvious trap, even going so far as to predict that the karts would be rigged with bio-scanners and that Eggman's kart would transform into a mecha-dragon. The next day, Sticks witnessed Sonic and Eggman's road brawl from the spectators stand, completely unsurprised seeing that two of her predictions were spot-on (Eggman's kart changed into a
   spider
   instead of a dragon), and took the opportunity to join her friends in bringing down the mech. Attempting to attack Eggman face to face, Sticks was sent flying with a piece of debris when the mech eventually exploded, in which she crashed into a coconut tree in a nearby jungle, before landing next to a
