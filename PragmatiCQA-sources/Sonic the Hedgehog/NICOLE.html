   captive, he attempted to force Nicole to create a Super Ring that would restore his lost magic, though Nicole informed him several times that she was unsure that she could pull the task off. When the Tails Doll arrived in Mobotropolis-no longer composed of nanites-and became engaged in battle with Sonic and Tails, Nicole mocked Naugus, referring to him as "Wally" and claiming he deserved his misfortune. An enraged Naugus grabbed her computer body, the contact had the unexpected effect of reawakening Naugus' memories from the original reality. Terrified by the experience, Naugus threw Nicole's computer through a nearby window, where it was discovered by Tails, who had arrived recently with

   . Nicole attempted to warn him off, apparently fearing that he would be affected just as Naugus was, but damage incurred from the treatment of her computer form made it so that Tails couldn't understand her. His memories were restored, and Tails later reluctantly plugged NICOLE into Tails Doll, allowing them to shut the monstrous machine down. After assuring her friends that her programming was undamaged, Nicole-her ability to speak somewhat repaired by her contact with Tails-suggested that the confused pair go looking for the missing Freedom Fighters. After rescuing a rejuvenated King Acorn, who blamed himself for Nicole's captivity, the trio set out to do just that. (

Despite Nicole's noting that the creatures would disappear at sunrise, Sally dove off the aircraft to aid a beleaguered Tails, who later saved her from falling.

   After being told about the

   and several issues that had cropped up since the Shattered World Crisis had begun, Nicole expressed her fears to Dr. Ellidy that someone or something was trying to take over his systems. Reluctantly acknowledging the theory, Ellidy agreed to let Nicole and Tails look over his systems, with Nicole locking down her handheld form and downloading herself into Ellidy's computers. As she worked, Phage and the creatures from before kept appearing just beyond her perception, and she and Tails decided to partition the system to make it more difficult for any foreign invaders to move freely about the system. Ellidy also questioned when she had gained her sentience, and Nicole confessed that she had difficulty identifying the moment, and also that she recalled things from before that time with a different perspective than she now possessed.

   Later on she was confronted by Phage, who identified herself as the perpetrator of the attack on Ellidy and a later attack on Sally and Big. She attempted to contain the evil A.I., but found Phage's power greater than her own, and was attacked in turn. Phage briefly held her captive in an effort to force Sally and Ellidy to cooperate with her, but when Phage toyed with the notion of destroying Nicole and impersonating her she broke free and fled into the system. Phage was quick to pursue her, and Nicole desperately took refuge in a curious digital structure, where she found images of Ellidy's daughter

   Sally confronted Phage and instructed Nicole to leave, unaware that Phage was keeping Nicole from escaping. Further refusing to leave her friend, Nicole attacked Phage and actually managed to injure her. The pair of friends then fled, and Nicole revealed her reasons for not leaving her friend. She also explained why Sally was unable to move about the Digital World like she did, before the princess came up with a plan. Despite Nicole's reservations, Sally lured Nicole outside of Ellidy's systems, but was tethered to Nicole by a digital version of one of Ellidy's
   Sling Rings
   . Nicole used this to pull Sally back into Ellidy's network, which she then attempted to seal Phage out of. Despite Phage's injuries, Nicole proved no match for her until Ellidy inserted one of the Red Star Rings into her handheld computer form. This caused her to become

She understood Ellidy's reluctance to interact with her as a result, given that her ability to think and feel had come at the cost of Nikki's life. Much to her surprise, Ellidy then gave her his other Red Star Ring and asked her to analyze it and send him her findings. She then chose to remain in hologram form on the flight home, in order to "feel the wind on [her] face." (

   Nicole gave Rotor a very low status on the ship while he fought the Death Egg. Eventually, the Death Egg shot the Sky Patrol out of the sky, forcing Nicole's servers to be put on reserve power. Luckily, the Death Egg did not make it to the spire in time due to Perfect Dark Gaia and once Super Sonic and Chip defeated it, the latter asked Sally to say goodbye to Nicole for him. (

   When reality was reshaped, NICOLE somehow absorbed residual energy from the Super Genesis Wave, which severely compromised her systems. However, contact with her computer body allowed inhabitants of the altered world to regain their memories of the unaltered one, as seen with Walter Naugus and the Freedom Fighters (sans Sonic). Once all the leftover Genesis Wave energy had been spent, NICOLE finally became fully functional again.

   , she can project a solid hologram of this form, but only so long as the Power Ring's energy lasts. Her hologram form is vulnerable to attack, but no damage is incurred to NICOLE so long as her handheld form remains unharmed. NICOLE also is able to create barriers of an unknown greenish energy, which are strong enough to block laser fire. In the Digital World NICOLE's powers are incredible, ranging from modifying and controlling existing virtual structures to creating new material, such as weapons-she seems to favor a pitchfork-like implement. She is also capable of producing digital energy blasts and creating firewalls, though her strength is not unlimited. When a
   Red Star Ring
   is inserted in her computer in place of a typical ring, she takes on the more powerful form of

   NICOLE possesses many of the traits of a living being, and is fully regarded as such by her friends. She is able to express concern for others, and is not without the ability to mock or express defiance. However, she is at times out of touch with this part of herself, reverting to the more logical thought processes of a machine. Originally this sort of behavior was all Nicole was capable of, with logic being the only motivation behind any decision. Despite this, she is capable of appreciating beauty and of helping others in times of difficulty.

  <p key="64e01a6d-f5dd-45d3-b058-4961d604653e">
   Nicole also seems to resent her previous emotionless self as she states to Dr. Ellidy that while she can recall past memories, she doesn't like looking back to them as she now sees them in a whole new perspective. After learning of her origins, she came to feel that her lease on life had come at the cost of Nikki the Lynx's. Despite this, she felt affection for her creator, and was surprised-and pleased-when he overcame his previous distance towards her.
