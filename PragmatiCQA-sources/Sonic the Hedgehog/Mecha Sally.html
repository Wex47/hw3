Soon after, Mecha Sally emerged from the rubble, roboticized and completely subservient to Robotnik's will, much to Sonic's horror and Eggman's delight as she reached for the stunned hero's throat. Sonic's pleas for Sally to resist Eggman's control went unheeded as Eggman saw the hedgehog's feelings could not bring himself to fight her, and sarcastically had Mecha Sally throw him out of a waste disposal hatch. Eggman then her put to use right away when they returned to the Death Egg's bridge by forcing Snively to fire the

Amy resisted her goading with Tails' help, forcing Sally to set fire to nearby houses with her Boom Fant as a distraction, and called for back-up from the Egg Swats aiding in the raid. While her old friends fended off the Egg Swats, she discovered Elias and his family already left, and she flew off from her failed mission to join the Death Egg's second invasion of New Mobotropolis.

   Sally's strength as Mecha Sally was greater than it ever was in her normal form. Eggman modified the second Mecha Sally with new abilities, including prevention of restoring her free will, rocket-powered flight via boot jets, and sword-like blades mounted in her forearms which retract when not in use.

    She also has a powerful laser hidden inside one of her locks of hair. She primaraly uses the laser as part of a combo attack with Metal Sonic. Mecha Sally also has the ability to project a powerful force field around herself, shielding her from enemy attacks

   Cold and efficient, Mecha Sally was completely loyal to Dr. Robotnik (later Dr. Eggman) and follows his orders without question or hesitation, even going as far as betraying the ones she had considered her friends. She also engages her opponents psychologically; delivering cold, merciless ridicule of their weaknesses while attacking them and exploiting her former allies' feelings for her against them (

   Her second appearance is similar to her first appearance, except for the fact that when first roboticized, her eyes became red on black, while in her second form they were blue on black, as well as being more detailed and mechanical-looking.

   After Dr. Eggman upgraded, modified, and weaponized her, Mecha Sally still had her metallic blue vest, but her hands became silver, her midsection was silver with a black and red crystal or panel underneath her vest, black boots, black shoulder guards in place of the round brown shoulder guards, and blue legs. In addition, her cheeks now have silver disks instead of her original brown disks and her hair has an extra pair of 'spikes' on the sides. Her tail is still brown.
