   As the tournament commenced, Breezie found herself marveling over the fact that Sonic had managed to triumph despite her earlier betrayal, but amused that she could still manipulate him. Her manipulation of the tournament roster-or allowing it to be manipulated as in Knuckles' case-became evident to several of the competitors as the tournament progressed, notably

   to break in and make an attempt to steal the Chaos Emerald, only to be thwarted by the two heroes and their allies in the tournament. Metal Sonic was forced to flee, and the Freedom Fighters ended up with the Chaos Emerald. However, Breezie's goals were accomplished, and she even signed an exclusive deal with

   to provide clothes for her staff. The Cat questioned Breezie regarding her actions, as the Freedom Fighters had very nearly lost the Emerald and with it the means of restoring the shattered planet. Breezie simply retorted that the lapse in security, while unfortunate, had provided quite a display to boost her business, and reminded Honey of her own trickery during the tournament. (

   Breezie is a rather audacious individual, as she was unafraid of the idea of advertising that she possessed a Chaos Emerald in order to stage her tournament and attract competitors. She is also quite confident in the face of Eggman's demands, apparently having respect for her old master. She also tends to flirt with Sonic once in a while, although this might just be an attempt to annoy Sonic or make Amy jealous rather than being an actual attraction. Her primary motivation appears to be how she can best advance her own situation, regardless of who might have to suffer for it. She possesses a rather amoral view of things, caring nothing for "good" or "evil" but thinking only in terms of her own betterment. She also demonstrated an admiration of Neo Metal Sonic's desire to strike out on his own, a goal that she shared.

However, she does retain her green fur, though it now comes with blue highlights, and she now has quill gatherings not unlike that of Sonic or Shadow in place of hair. She also appears to wear makeup on her eyelids, similar to

    Here, she was an android constructed to lure Sonic into a trap, not unlike the

    featured in the comic Pre-SGW. In fact, her storyline is very reminiscent of the

      Breezie is very different from her AoStH counterpart, in both appearance and personalty. In appearance, she is updated to better resemble modern-day characters. In personalty, she is very cold and shallow; and unlike her AoStH counterpart, she never truly reformed. Archie's Breezie also appears to be a fully organic being as opposed to a robot; which is further evidenced by a photograph of her as a young child.
