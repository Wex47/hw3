   King Sonic
   was forced to go back in time and change history in order to preserve the fabric of reality. Upon his return to the timeline, events had dramatically been altered and
   Shadow
   was now king. With the help of

   Sonia

   Quantum Dial
   —the fabric of space and time was in danger of collapsing, which would cause Mobius to be destroyed. In an attempt to fix the problem, Sonic and Knuckles agreed to a truce. Sonic agreed to use the
   Tachyon Displacement Chamber
   , a time machine built by Eggman and kept in storage for years, to travel to the past and collect information so that the problem could be rectified. Before departing, Knuckles visited Locke's grave and, remembering their final days together, realized that, in not letting Lara-Su become a Guardian, he was making the same mistake his father did and agreed to let Lara-Su become a
   Guardian
   , and she stowed away aboard the transport. Sonic entered the chamber, but something went wrong and he disappeared. Lara-Su vanished at the same time, and the time line was irrevocably altered... (

    "Things may have been bad under King Shadow, but at least he knew how to keep the warmongers in line."

   Some time after, the much-loved Queen Sally married King Shadow, and she was able to ease some of the harsh rules and punishments of Shadow's regime. There was no love between the two, and Shadow married her only for her political connections. The
   Dark Presence
   , under the leadership of Lien-Da, became his secret enforcers while Knuckles and the
   Chaotix
   became his legitimate law-keeping force. The world trembled in fear of the organization and its ruthless efficiency, while some felt there was some hope due to the humanitarian missions performed by Queen Sally. In addition to these changes, King Shadow turned
   Maria Robotnik
   into an iconic symbol of worship. Furthermore, the world capital was relocated to the merchant city of
   Portal
   on
   Angel Island
   in 3262. (

   Tikal
   was forced to bind herself to

   Tikhaos

   Cobar
   , were locked up and tortured, and the latter was presumably killed by King Shadow. Tails, having preserved his family and memories from the timeline changes, sought out the help of Knuckles and Sonic to remove King Shadow from power. (

   Having retained her memories, Lara-Su found a world far different from what she left behind. As a result of the alteration, several of her friends had ceased to exist, namely Sonia and Manik. Thus, she offered to join Tails in his quest to both locate Sonic and take down King Shadow after her father refused to help Tails. Lara-Su and Tails eventually found Sonic living on the streets of the city of Portal as a hobo. Sonic reconciled with Tails, believing that if he couldn't fix the past back to the way it was, then he could at least fix his friendship with him now. However, the three were then arrested by Knuckles. (

   After the three were imprisoned, Knuckles revealed he had arrested them merely as a deception and so they could get close to the king. Lara-Su, Knuckles, Tails and Sonic then launched a coup d’état against King Shadow, besieging Castle Mobius. Although Sonic was quickly defeated by King Shadow, Lara-Su managed to freeze the despot in time with her knowledge of

   Although the majority of Mobius was at peace, some of the stability was lost when King Sonic took the throne. Both Knuckles and Julie-Su went off to conduct peace talks with a warring faction, while

   Dark Presence
   kidnapped
   Miles
   and
   Mina Prower
   and took over
   Castle Mobius
   from within. King Shadow was also freed from his suspended animation by
   Lien-Da
   . The royal family-except for Sonic-went into hiding with an unconscious Silver, while the King,
   Lara-Su
   ,
   Melody Prower
   , and
   Skye Prower
   sought sanctuary with
   Argyle the Crocodile
   . When they arrived, Argyle gave friendly greetings to everyone and bowed to Sonic. After explaining what had happened, Argyle introduced everyone to
   Jacques
   and
   Belle D'Coolette
   to help assist their plan, thereby creating the
   Future Freedom Fighters
   . Meanwhile, in Castle Mobius, King Shadow questioned Lien-Da what had happened in the time he was in suspended animation. After she explained he prepared to release
   Tikhaos
   to teach the world a lesson. Lien-Da tried to reason with him, but he tore off her
   spatial armband
   so her position in the universe would change. Outside of the castle, King Sonic, Jacques, and Belle took the direct approach while Lara-Su, Skye, and Melody flew in. After Skye managed to take out a squad of the Dark Presence, Sonic managed to speak with his family. Back in the catacombs, a Dark Presence member alerted Shadow that King Sonic has retaken the castle before he gave Tikhaos an overdose on Chaos energy and caused her to lose control. Just as the Future Freedom Fighters prepared to attack the Dark Presence, they ran past them in terror before
   Perfect Tikhaos
   ripped apart the castle. The new Freedom Fighters, were led into keep Tikhaos at bay while Sonic rescued his family and Silver from the ruins of the castle. When they got out, the Freedom Fighters, now assisted by Miles and Mina told Sonic that they couldn't keep up the assault for much longer. Manik and Sonia came up with the idea of attacking Chaos' old weak spot, his exposed brain, to take him out. The Freedom Fighters then attempted this plan with Sonic at the lead but he was stopped by the water monster. However, Sonia and Manik stepped in and attacked the monster for their father. Lara-Su then used Tikal's Prayer and allowed the monster to revert back to Tikal's gentle side. The New Freedom Fighters celebrated their first victory of the new team. (

    storyline is one of the major reasons for the jettisoning of the Ken Penders-created characters. After re-obtaining his created characters, Penders had stated that Archie and Sega were still free to use these characters under three obligations. One of those obligations was that this storyline had to be the comic's canon future and not some alternate universe.

   <li key="b306fd5e-f6c1-427c-8c61-35c80781b7ce">
    There was going to be more emphasis on Lara-Su portraying her as a main character such as Knuckles in this storyline and some possible others.

   <li key="69462e72-ad44-46a2-bba2-c24536a19d18">

    Knuckles' appearance would've been a little different. For one thing he would've had a metallic left eye and besides the outfit he has in

    As for Julie-Su, Ken Penders made it very clear that just because she has less cybernetics than before that it doesn't mean she has become some domesticated housewife; she still has the same kick butt attitude she had since she was a teenager.
   </li>
   <li key="8ba46dc2-0b7f-4827-b3fe-1a04c8de390b">
    The story was going to open up with a doctor telling Julie-Su she was pregnant but that was just to tip off the readers that this was going to be a storyline like no other.
