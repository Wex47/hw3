The series continued the ongoing story of Knuckles's search for answers about his heritage and true nature, which had previously been featured in the Sonic the Hedgehog series as well as several specials and miniseries. After the series' cancellation in 2000, Knuckles's stories were continued as a regular feature in issues of Sonic the Hedgehog until 2003. After this, Knuckles and several of his supporting cast members became a semi-regular feature of Sonic's stories, effectively merging the two storylines into one.

   The main focus of the comic is the title character, Knuckles the Echidna. His sacred duty is guarding the

   There is in fact no Knuckles the Echidna issues numbered 1, 2 or 3, the first three issues of the series were titled
   <i key="6886b3b4-6f32-43dd-bea8-bf756fd56f43">
    Knuckles: The Dark Legion
   </i>
   and was a 3-issue mini-series, when the ongoing Knuckles the Echidna series began it started its numbering from issue 4. Archie have essentially 'retconned' the mini-series as being Knuckles the Echidna 1 through 3, something they have also did with the Sonic Vs Knuckles: Battle Royal 1-shot which they 'retconned' into being
   #1. Knuckles The Echidna: The Dark Legion (Knuckles the Echidna 1-3) is preceded by another Knuckles mini-series Sonic's Friendly Nemesis Knuckles and the Knuckles Chaotix 1-shot both of which tie directly into the ongoing series.
  </p>
  <p key="af5476fa-8e6a-4b5f-8e4b-ac6f015408c4">
   It is possible to view the series as Ken Penders' 'pet project'. Penders wrote every issue and even penciled some of the later stories as well as created all of the original characters that debuted in the series. While this may be in some ways true, it is one of the most mature titles put out by Archie Comics to date, having a lot more in common in terms of format and content with comic book companies who aim their books at teenagers and adults (Marvel Comics, DC Comics etc.) than the more child-friendly titles the company usually produce. The series was broken down into three-issue story arcs and kept a strong continuity from one story to another a contrast to the main Sonic the Hedgehog series which contained mostly unrelated self-contained stories and the continuity-less Archie's Gang titles and the stories dealt with a variety of religion, bigotry, politics, destiny, duty, relationships, family and love in a very mature way, again in particular contrast to the naive Archie's Gang series.

  <p key="bed50db6-7fcd-46e1-9588-680c8f602aa0">
   Knuckles the Echidna also used a cover gimmick in which a story spanning three issues would have its covers connect to make one full image. These covers were drawn by Patrick Spaziante until issue 25, after which Manny Galan took over for the final issues. Galan was the series’ primary interior artist; his last full story was #25, though he later penciled the back-up story featuring Mighty the Armadillo. Other artists include Jim Valentino (#22-24), Chris Allan (#26-28), Art Mawhinney (#29), Colleen Doran (the Espio the Chameleon back-up story) and Ken Penders (#30-32).

   . Much of the story centers around Knuckles's family history. Knuckles's family had split into two factions: the

   With the exception of Knuckles and the Chaotix, and later Ray the Flying Squirrel, Knuckles the Echidna featured a totally original cast of characters created specifically for the book, some of whom have gone onto continue to play a large part in the regular Sonic the Hedgehog series and universe.

    (Issues 4-6) Knuckles encounters Julie-Su, a Dark Legion soldier who was separated from her group as their base was destroyed. Rather than rejoin her companions, she felt driven to seek out Knuckles instead and, despite some trust issues, the two investigate the earthquakes that have become more and more frequent. Due to the firing of the Ultimate Annihilator (as told in the Sonic the Hedgehog Endgame story) has lead to fluctuations and weakening of the barriers between alternate Zones. It is revealed that, two centuries ago, many of the island's inhabitants had been moved to separate Zones by the Guardian Hawking in order to save them from nuclear fallout. The ancient Echidna city, Echidnaopolis, long-thought to have been destroyed centuries prior, starts to reappear on the island; however, the city of their longtime enemies, the Dingoes, begins to reappear as well. Both cities stand to reappear in the same place, causing tensions to mount as the dingo leader General Von Stryker sees the fluctuations as an Echidna-made threat. Knuckles encounters his mother for the first time in over a decade and is later briefly taken into custody by Constable Remington, who sends him to meet his ancestor Hawking. He and Julie-Su later go out to stop the dingoes' military advances as the temporal situation worsens; in the aftermath, Echidnaopolis is restored to the island, leaving the dingoes homeless.

However, this is reversed by the Ancient Walkers. Thinking his obstacles now dealt with, Enerjak leads the Legion into Echidnaopolis where he clashes with the combined Dingo and Echidna armed forces; however, Mammoth Mogul's reason for reviving Enerjak is revealed as he appears and drains Enerjak of the energies absorbed from the Chaos Emeralds, leaving him an old man. During the confusion, Julie-Su betrays Kragok, leading to his arrest by the EST—and hers as well. The story continued onto Sonic the Hedgehog issue 56 in which Super Sonic, Hyper Knuckles and Turbo Tails battled Master Mogul. Because of her actions, Julie-Su's loyalties are called into doubt, especially by Vector the Crocodile.

Due to prophecy, Athair abandoned his duties as Guardian in order to lead the tribe to their goal—Albion, the original home of the Echidna race—and believed that Knuckles was destined to lead the group on the last segment of its journey. Knuckles is supported by tribal members Yanar and Mari-An, and successfully leads them through Mercia, an area under the control of Antoine D'Coolette's roboticized father, known as the High Sheriff of Snottingham. They are aided by a Mercian local, Rob O' the Hedge, who also turns out to have ties to the tribe's prophecy; the tribe eventually ends its centuries of wandering and makes its way to Albion. Meanwhile, at Locke's insistence, the Chaotix are deputized by Constable Remington, who releases Julie-Su from jail as their new partner despite misgivings all around.

    (Issues 26-28) Mighty the Armadillo is recruited by Nic the Weasel and Fiona Fox (who had been thought dead) to open a heavy vault door; the two are searching for a gem they suspect was left behind in one of Robotnik's old prison camps. It is revealed that, as children, Mighty, Fiona and Ray the Squirrel had been imprisoned there; a young Sonic helped their attempted breakout, but Ray was lost in the confusion and Fiona was taken with Robotnik as he fled, causing her to resent Sonic and Mighty. The three eventually find Ray alive but trapped in suspended animation due to the gem sought by Fiona and Nic; at the cost of destroying the treasure, Ray is freed.

    (Issues 30-32) Monk, a purple ape who bullied Knuckles as a child, returns to the Floating Island after being literally thrown off years ago by The Brotherhood of Guardians. Monk confronts Knuckles, but their fight is interrupted by the Overlander (human) Hunter, who hunts all manner of creatures for sport. Fitted with restraining collars, the two are forced to work together to evade Hunter; however, Monk is eventually killed, causing Knuckles to instinctively release the full force of his Chaos powers; Hunter is later imprisoned by The Brotherhood.

    (Issues 30-32) Traveling with Julie-Su in Rainbow Valley, Espio comes across an injured chameleon who gives a cryptic warning before falling unconscious. After Julie-Su leaves to seek medical aid, Espio is approached by his friend Liza, who reveals that Valdez, a former member of the Secret Service, has arrived on the island; however, Valdez has been roboticized and reprogrammed by Robotnik. Believing a twisted version of reality, Valdez asks Espio's help in obtaining the island's Emerald; however, as coercion, he has Liza roboticized and threatens the lives of the valley's chameleons. Eventually realizing that this is no longer his old friend, Espio pretends to go along with the plan before turning on Valdez; he is presumably destroyed and the imprisoned chameleons are freed.
