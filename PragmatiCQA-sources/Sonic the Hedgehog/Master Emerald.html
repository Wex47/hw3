As Knuckles went on to confront the duo upon their arrival and proceeded to make their journey to bring down Eggman considerably more difficult, the doctor took the opportunity to steal the Master Emerald himself as a power source to relaunch the Death Egg, much to Knuckles' humiliation at realizing he's been tricked.

With the Emerald's power no longer in place, Angel Island once again fell into the ocean. The Island in danger, Knuckles initiated his first quest to hunt down the missing Emerald shards that had flown off everywhere. After a long search, Knuckles restored the Emerald to its former glory, and soon Chaos was even returned to its home within it, now recovered from the rage it had felt since 4,000 years prior. (

   The Master Emerald contains extremely potent and raw energy which can be harnessed to power machinery or potentially initiate a super transformation, and can greatly increased innate talents. Like the Chaos Emeralds, its power can also be harnessed to perform certain reality-warping feats.

  <p key="9ffc96a3-cede-4ae0-9c51-afff27702434">
   As its primary function, the Master Emerald contains special powers that lets it nullify and control the Chaos Emeralds' energies. This grants it the ability to either completely shut down the Chaos Emeralds' chaos energy or potentially amplify their power. However, it seems that only those affiliated with the Knuckles Clan, such as Knuckles and Tikal, are able to use the full potential of the Master Emerald. To unlock its power, they must on most occasions recite Tikal's Prayer.

   If the Master Emerald is shattered into several pieces, it can repair itself if its shards are brought back together. However, shattering the Master Emerald seems to give the shards an explosive trajectory, causing them to fly a great distance which makes the task of gathering them rather painstaking.
