There are also numerous historical parallels between Albion and Great Britain, such as both reaching a state of industrialization and modernization before other regions of the world, the Albion population colonizing Downunda similar to Britain colonizing Australia, and Stone Henge-like formations being near Albion. Additionally, "Albion" is the ancient Greek name for Britain.
