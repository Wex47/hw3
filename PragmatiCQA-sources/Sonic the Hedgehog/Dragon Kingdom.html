   In ancient times, the land was inhabited by the
   Dragon
   race. They viciously fought each other until the land itself was burned and ruined. When they eventually became aware of the destruction they'd caused, they ceased fighting and decided to resettle throughout the world. Before leaving, they left behind a prophecy stating that when the land was once again in turmoil, it would be reunited by the
   Golden Lotus King
   . As such, several shrines-each known as a
   Temple of the Golden Lotus
   -were built throughout the land in anticipation of the legend. The temples served to help the Dragon Kingdom's citizens find peace as they looked forward to the arrival of the prophesied king. (

   The next big problem was the ninja clans that had been fighting them as well. Even after Regina and Jun received support from Dr. Robotnik, it only made the four houses fight back even harder once they learned of it. Trying a different tactic, Regina attempted to bribe the Yagyu's leader, the
   Bride of Rich Nights
   , into siding with her in order to gain a fighting force. When that failed, Jun Kun murdered Rich Nights, letting Regina take credit in order to make the Yagyu became her personal army. She then sent the Yagyu to aid the other clans in their battles at random while spreading rumors of each other being allied with the Iron Dominion. Fearing their own destruction, the respective brides of the

Realizing that the loyalty of the clans to the Iron Queen had to be broken before the threat of the Dominion could truly be ended, the quartet arrived in Stormtop Village to begin seeking out the clans. The Gossamer Clan soon attacked them, capturing everyone but Sonic, who then convinced the Gossamer ninja that he and his teammates were seeking a peaceful meeting with the clan. After successfully negotiating peace with the
