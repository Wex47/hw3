   by Guardian
   Tobor
   , which Knuckles sensed, halted this attempt, and Dimitri turned to Knuckles for help. Knuckles learned that his evolution granted him the power to travel through time, and that there were three events in Echidna history that, if altered, could undo the Quantum Beam's effects and indeed reunify the Echidna people as if they had never been separated. Despite Julie-Su's protests, Knuckles agreed, traveling back in time first to prevent Angel Island's creation, only for the island to be destroyed as a result. Trying again by lowering Angel Island back to the surface, Knuckles succeeded only in destroying it by bringing it crashing to the surface. His worst mistake was in preventing the death of
   Edmund
   , the first Guardian, which would have led to all the Echidnas being Roboticized and enslaved by

This fear was proven correct when Knuckles used his immense new powers to undo the Quantum Beam's effects by himself, restoring Angel Island's inhabitants. Knuckles, however, supported Dimitri's idea of reunifying the Echidna people, and thus vouched for him despite the opposition of such parties as the

For unknown reasons, during a transmission of Mogul's demands Knuckles found himself revisiting a forgotten part of his past, in which he and his father had confronted
   Robians

   . Weakening rapidly, Knuckles called on his last resort, pushing his powers past the ability of his body to endure. Remington, Lien-Da, the Chaotix, and the Dark Legion arrived shortly afterwards, finding the building Mogul had been hiding in reduced to rubble. They found Mogul himself gone, Dimitri alive, and Knuckles...dead. (

   With a direct connection to the Chaos Force stronger than that of any other known living being, Chaos Knuckles possesses abilities beyond those of any previous Guardian and virtually any other wielder of such power. In addition to the enhanced physical abilities, energy blasts, and teleportation abilities exhibited by his fellow Guardians and other wielders of Chaos energy, Chaos Knuckles could also travel through time and alter it to his will, communicate with other Guardians living or dead across distances, warp reality to shape matter-as shown when he conjured a bouquet for Julie seemingly out of thin air-and manipulate Chaos energy to a much greater level and degree than had ever been seen before. According to Arthair, Chaos Knuckles’ power continued to rise with each passing moment, describing Chaos Knuckles as being in an “constantly evolving state”. In a very short time, his power grew to the point that the echidnas and Dark Legion deemed Chaos Knuckles’ very existence a danger to all of reality.
  </p>
  <p key="54169621-6729-4e53-abb1-fbb12459ecb6">
   To further put Chaos Knuckles’ powers in perspective, he was able to easily defeat a clone of
   Turbo Tails
   who (according to Merlin Prower and Arthair) was said to possess even greater strength than
   Super Sonic
   or
   Hyper Knuckles
   .
   He was also able to withstand the chaos siphon suit, which was specifically made to drain his immense powers and kill him.
   It is very likely that the powers at his disposal in this state were almost as powerful as the ones Knuckles had when he transformed into the fourth Enerjak, as the Chaos Knuckles and Enerjak states have been directly compared.
