   The Sword of Acorns was created after King Max, a prince at the time, first had contact with the Source of All. As he emerged, the substance of the Source was drained off his body and gathered by servants of his father King
   Frederick Acorn
   and forged into the Sword and Crown of Acorns. The artifacts were thus imbued with magical properties, which Max wielded during his reign. When Dr. Ivo Robotnik came to power, the Sword was lost, somehow ending up in the possession of the Raven
   Mathias Poe
   , who concealed it within a dummy made to resemble
   Damocles the Elder
   , a fellow evil spell caster. Poe used it to amplify his own magical abilities for years until Knuckles the Echidna came in search of it. After battling Poe, he defeated the wizard and retrieved the Sword. (

   Over a year later, the Arachne used the Sword to open a dimensional rift in the
   Egg Grape Chamber
   , releasing their master Ixis Naugus from the Zone of Silence. This resulted in the death of the Ancient Walkers in the
   Virtual Zone

   Merlin Prower

Naugus took possession of the Sword and set out to obtain the Crown, only to find it in the possession of a recently returned Mammoth Mogul. The two wizards, their minions, and the Freedom Fighters and Chaotix did battle for the two artifacts as three separate groups until Naugus learned of Mogul's ties to his former brotherhood, the
   Order of Ixis

   The Sword of Acorns was shown to have a variety of magical abilities. It could amplify Chaos and other arcane energies, as well as acting as a sort of super conductor that could drain a person of such energies in a manner similar to that of a
   Chaos Syphon
   . The Sword, as a portion of the Source of All, was sentient, and possessed the ability to dominate the minds of others, controlling them or releasing them from other sources of control. When wielded by someone who could utilize its power, it could also unleash powerful energy, enough to counter dark magic or produce devastating blasts. Additionally, it could either open or enlarge tears in the walls between dimensions, allowing Ixis Naugus to escape the Zone of Silence without any side effects. Its abilities expanded and became stronger when used in conjunction with the Crown, such as healing those its energy was exposed to. A select few could use the sword's magical powers, the most notable being Max and Sally due to their exposure to the Source of All pool; however, various dark magic users could also utilize the sword.

    The Sword of Acorns is presumably identical to it's
    Dark Mobius
    counterpart, though obviously with a different history. Ironically, they share two experiences:
