   Founded by Menniker, son of Dimitri, the Dark Legion was originally made up of a group of disgruntled Echidnas opposed to the Echidna Council's ban on excess technology. The Dark Legion began open warfare on Echidnaopolis, beginning a civil war which would not stop until one side emerged victorious. After killing Edmund,
   Steppenwolf
   - the son of
   Edmund
   and second
   Guardian
   - engaged Menniker in mortal combat. Before the other members of the Legion were able to act, Steppenwolf used his Chaos powers to banish Menniker and the Dark Legion to the
   Twilight Zone
   , a realm where time passed differently than on

   During their time in the Zone, the Dark Legion ran afoul of another clan of Echidnas from Mobius called the
   Nocturnus Clan
   , who controlled the Zone and the other races within, although the Nocturnus leader
   Imperator Ix
   chose to shun them due to their inferior technology. Thanks to stolen Nocturnus technology, during
   Moonwatcher
   's tenure as Guardian, the Dark Legion managed to escape from the Twilight Zone and attack. However, they were repelled and forced back into their prison zone. (

   , Menniker procured a nuclear missile, hoping to strike down the Floating Island. Aaron, who was currently on the planet's surface, discovered Menniker and his plot. One of the Overlanders launched the missile, but Aaron leaped on and began to disable it. Menniker managed to grab a hold of Aaron before the missile took off; ordering him not to try to meddle with the bomb or it would explode. When Aaron discovered this, he deliberately set off the missile, ending its threat to the Floating Island and Menniker's life at the cost of his own. (

Knuckles agreed, but just as Dimitri was preparing to restore the Echidnas back to this zone, Tobor and Kragok emerged from the Twilight Zone. The first firing of the Quantum Beam had resulted in a tearing of the fabric of space and time, which allowed the two to finally escape. However, Tobor sacrificed his life by slamming Kragok and himself into the cruiser, resulting in the temporary malfunction of the Quantum Beam. Knuckles then used his own powers to reverse the effects of the Quantum Beam, restoring all the Floating Island's inhabitants. (

   With Enerjak's return, the Dark Legion factions found themselves trying to combat the demigod. However, Enerjak's power proved far too much for the Legion's weaponry, and as part of his plan to restore Echidnas to their former glory, Enerjak used his Chaos powers to remove all cybernetic enhancements from all Legionnaires, as well as restoring Remmington's lost memory. Enerjak went on to teleport all of the Echidnas to Albion, with the exception of Lien-Da and her few loyal followers, who were enraged at the loss of their cybernetic enhancements. (

   The Dark Legion's understanding of technology is on par with, if not superior to, Dr. Eggman's. Every Dark Legionnaire has some portion of their body exchanged for a robotic replacement. Some Legionnaires go so far as to have the vast majority of themselves replaced with mechanical limbs and parts, such as Xenin. Additionally, all Legionnaires have a memory chip implanted in their brains at birth, which can be used to terminate one's memories. Most surviving Legionnaires had their cybernetics removed by Enerjak, but they were replaced by new ones developed by Eggman, who also implanted explosives in them as insurance against the Legion's rebellion.

Resisting the changes to their way of life, the Dark Legion assembled their own warlike Mechanauts, and these robots came with them after the Ultimate Annihilator allowed them to make their final escape from the Twilight Zone. The Mechanauts have not been seen since Knuckles' initial encounter with the Dark Legion, although they were present during the time Dimitri temporarily reformed
