   As time passed, it became apparent that Bunnie's limbs needed an upgrade. She accepted, even though it would greatly decrease the chances of her ever getting her old limbs back. But Antoine reassured her that it wouldn't affect her courageous heart and beautiful spirit. The two had become close before Antoine asked for her hand in marriage, which she happily accepted. At some point, she cried alongside him when he was informed of his parents' unfortunate demise. (

Luckily, a small and unexpected reserve team led by Cream came to their aid, rescuing both groups and helping them back to the Sky Patrol. Battered and demoralized, they were bolstered by the return of Sonic, and soon faced their next objective: the

   Their battle did not last long, however, as the weakened altar floor ended up crumbling beneath both combatants and causing them to fall through. The two landed in a cave, illuminated by the Chaos Emerald. Cassia was enraged at having been injured again, knowing how her sister would react, and placed the blame on Bunnie. However, Cassia was eventually convinced to cooperate with Bunnie when reminded of her sister. En route to an exit that would lead to the temple grounds, Cassia learned about Bunnie's first experiences as a cyborg, and how she had her friends to help her through her struggles. Once arriving in a bunker, Bunnie prepared to leave on her own with the Emerald, only for Egg Soldiers to arrive, taking Bunnie by surprise long enough for Cassia to seize the Emerald for herself and rejoin her troops.

   Bunnie was led back onto the temple grounds, where Cassia ultimately chose to let her go without the Emerald. This decision did not last long, as Bunnie would suddenly rush the Egg Soldiers, grab the Emerald and flee. Bunnie found Sally elsewhere on the grounds and began to depart alongside her. Bunnie inferred from the experience that not everyone affiliated with the Eggman Empire shared the exact same characteristics as Dr. Eggman himself. With the mission a success, and all seven Emeralds in their possession, Bunnie, Sally, and Nicole, returned to the Sky Patrol, where they were met by Antoine, Cream, and Cheese. (

Her main point was that she was able to move on with her life and overcome her struggles because she had friends to support her, like how Teanchi has his family. Teanchi, now seeing things in an entirely new light, realized Bunnie was right and tearfully embraced his children before giving both Freedom Fighters the Gaia Key as his thanks. (

Fortunately, Nicole managed to get the Sky Partrol's thrusters working in time to save the three from perishing. Bunnie and the others regrouped with the rest of their team. Later, after helping Rotor and Sonic with the engines, Bunnie and the others carried out a three-way counter-offensive, where she was joined by Tails, Sally, and Antoine in breaking Eggman's control of the Dark Gaia Energy at
   Eggman Land
   . The four were met by resistance in the form of multiple E-100 units, though they and all the other Badniks in the area were rendered defunct when

Despite being no match for the godlike abilities of Dark Gaia, they still could lend moral support to Sonic and Chip, and did as such until the monstrous deity was sealed away in the core, and the planet restored. However, this came at the price of Chip's presence, too, meaning he would have to remain asleep with his dark counterpart. Though saddened by this at first, Bunnie and her friends were glad for the crisis to finally be over, and collectively witnessed the sunrise. (

   Bunnie has always been kind and friendly in addition to her beauty, and grew up with the expectation that she would marry a gentleman and settle down to a calm life as a hair stylist. That all changed during Dr. Eggman's takeover, when grievous injuries to Bunnie's body forced Uncle Chuck to partially Roboticize her. This change proved quite the struggle in Bunnie's life, but her fellow Freedom Fighters helped her to find a sense of normalcy by embracing her regardless of her cyborg nature. Bunnie thus developed into a fiery but good-natured individual with a firm desire to help save her world from evil and prevent the suffering of others. She is incredibly courageous and self-sacrificing, but not to the point of recklessness; her greatest fear is that something might befall her husband or their friends.

   Though she initially struggled with her cyborg nature, Bunnie eventually embraced her new form and its abilities, which-among various upgrades-included the powers of flight and conversion of her left forearm into a laser weapon. She also gained a built-in computer in her arm that could form a wireless connection with NICOLE. Bunnie also gained the ability to fire lasers directly from the palm of her hand, without having to transform her arm into a cannon. However, the power of her arm-laser seems to be limited to an extent, as seen by how she could create only a small hole in one of the Egg Train's roof hatches, instead of outright destroying it. Her mechanical limbs also grant her strength beyond that of a normal Mobian.

   Bunnie and Antoine met while growing up in Knothole following Dr. Eggman's takeover of Mobotropolis, and in the midst of their respective trials each found inspiration in the other. Over time their friendship blossomed into romance, and the pair eventually married. Bunnie loves her husband and is deeply concerned for his safety, and also relies on him in times of difficulty. Their relationship is not without the occasional joke, as Bunnie occasionally teases her husband or gently discourages some of his antics.

   Bunnie is a golden rabbit with pale yellow fur, a white muzzle, and vibrant emerald-green eyes. Her eyelids (as well as around the eyes themselves) are generally violet or pink and her right ear is often flopped, though this is not a constant feature. Her hair, starting off as a tuft of bangs on the back of her neck and forehead, grew from childhood into shoulder-length, and then down to her waist which she began tying back in a single ponytail. Bunnie most pronounced feature are her cyborg limbs as a result of her roboticization, with her left arm and lower torso from the waist being cybernetic. Originally being more clunky and heavy in appearance, her robotic parts were replaced with sleeker, more modern versions. As a child, Bunnie wore purple overalls, a white shirt, gloves, and bows at the tip of her ears. After her Roboticization, Bunnie began wearing a pink singlet instead and eventually discarded her bows after becoming a teenager.

   While undercover as a member of the
   Metropolis Egg Army
   , Bunnie wore the standard outfit of a member. Reminiscent of Dr. Eggman's clothing, it consisted of a red coat with a white stripe down the middle of the front with a white button on each side. The single sleeve over her only organic arm had a white shoulder pad, white elbow pad, and a white stripe traveling down the outer side of the sleeve. Around her wrist was a yellow (or golden) cuff, and she wore a white glove. Her pants were black and were form fitting around her legs and seemed to either connect to her boots, again similar to Dr. Eggman, or the white details around the knees could have been an indication of the start of high boots. There was also a white stripe on the top of each foot area. She also wore a red and yellow (or golden) helmet with a pink visor that she could see through. Additionally, there were holes on the top of the helmet for her ears to pop out.

    Bunnie's current design is a slight reworking of her planned redesign for the
    pre-SGW
    continuity, with the design of her robotic body parts (originally obtained through
    Legionization
    ) being simplified.

    A Q&amp;A from Ian Flynn indicates that Bunnie likes making "good comfort food," and that she and Antoine have made it a rule not to get in the way of each other in the kitchen.
