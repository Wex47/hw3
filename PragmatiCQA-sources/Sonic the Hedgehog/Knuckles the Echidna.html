   . Unbeknownst to him, however, Sonic and Tails were looking to stop Eggman, who had decided to steal the Master Emerald for himself. After a brief scuffle, Knuckles eventually befriended Sonic and Tails after Eggman stole the emerald himself. Knuckles, worn from the battle and from Eggman after trying to stop the thief, showed Sonic and Tails the path to reach Eggman. After Eggman was defeated and expelled from the island, the Master Emerald was safely returned. Dr. Eggman then dispatched his lackey,
   Julian Snively
   , to steal the emerald once again, with the diminutive villain employing an
   Eggrobo
   to do so. However, Knuckles successfully recovered the Master Emerald, putting a stop to the doctor's plan for good. (

   Eastwatch Islands
   , under the orders of Eggman. After springing a trap on Sonic, Tails, and Amy, the trio destroyed the trap, revealing Knuckles inside a contraption. After demanding Sonic hand over the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic helped Knuckles realize he was once again tricked by Eggman, this time into handing him the Master Emerald to power his new super-weapon, the
   Mega Drive
   , which Eggman still needed the seven
   Ancient Gears
   for. With the four of them forming a team, they encountered and defeated Eggman, retrieved an Ancient Gear, and saved captured animals. (

After Tails realized where Eggman and Metal Sonic could be hiding, Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails made their way to Eggman's new flying fortress. After handing over their Ancient Gear in exchange for Amy thinking that Eggman didn't have the seventh (since Eggman specifically asked for the "last" Ancient Gear from Sonic after stealing the five from Tails), the team realized that Metal Sonic had the last Ancient Gear inside of it. After the three defeated Metal Sonic and saved Amy, Eggman and Metal Sonic fled the fortress. After taking a look at the database on the fortress, Tails realized that there was a deep sea base directly under where they were and that the airship was only for supply shipments, Sonic decided that before pursuing the villains they should collect the seven Chaos Emeralds, which had a habit of showing up when they needed them.

   , to abandon his war efforts. Back in the present, Knuckles spotted Dr. Eggman and a shine in the doctor's hand, which he believed to be an Emerald Shard but discovered it was a Chaos Emerald when he corned Eggman. Eggman called in Chaos 1, one of Chaos' transformations, and transformed it into Chaos 2, but Knuckles still recognized it and beat it, though afterwards, Eggman told Knuckles that Sonic was after the Emerald Shards too before leaving, which filled Knuckles' mind with doubts. After finding more Emerald Shards, Knuckles found Sonic and Tails. Seeing shines in Sonic's hands, Knuckles believed it was Emerald Shards and attacked the duo until Sonic dropped them, and they were revealed to be Chaos Emeralds. Eggman then showed up to nab the Emeralds, mocking Knuckles with how it was a trick to steal the Emeralds, and gave them to Chaos 2, turning it into Chaos 4. After defeating Chaos 4, Knuckles left to find the remaining Emerald Shards while Sonic and Tails chased Eggman's Egg Carrier. Knuckles was soon after sent back to the the past after finding more shards where he saw Tikal attempt to make Chaos leave the Altar of the Emeralds with the

   and trailed it to trail the robot to the Egg Carrier where Knuckles found the remaining shards, only to be sent into the past again, this time to see the alter ablaze where he tried asking Tikal what was going on but was sent back home. Back on the Egg Carrier, Knuckles met Sonic as he was heading after Eggman, who left him to defeat Chaos 6. Knuckles subsequently beat Chaos and got its six Chaos Emeralds back before returning home with all the emeralds where he restored the Master Emerald, allowing it to hoist Angel Island back to the sky. Not long after, Angel Island fell down again, and Knuckles decided to find Sonic for advice, believing the Chaos Emeralds he got had something to do with it. Soon after, however, he found Eggman and was ambushed by Chaos, who took his Chaos Emeralds. After finding Sonic and Tails, Knuckles informed them of Chaos's return and that it would destroy the world with the Chaos Emeralds, before taking off himself to deal with the threat. Arriving in

   , Knuckles led the group to Eggman's base, having seen both Eggman and Rouge enter it. Believing there was a space shuttle there that could take them to the ARK and destroy the Eclipse Cannon, Knuckles and the team infiltrated the base, where Knuckles found the keys to the center at Sonic's choice, before having a fight with
   King Boom Boo
   . At the shuttle's launch pad, Knuckles and the others were ambushed by Eggman with the Egg Golem. While Sonic defeated the Egg Golem, Knuckles and the others got a space shuttle to take off in. While en route to Space Colony ARK however, the shuttle hit a stray asteroid, causing the cargo bay to open and releasing all the Emerald Shards Knuckles had stored there. Panicking, Knuckles tried taking control of the shuttle, only to make it crash on the asteroid. After landing, Knuckles left the group to find the lost shards. After finding some shards, Knuckles met Rouge again and fought her to a stalemate. However, as Rouge tripped into lava, Knuckles saved her life, only for Rouge to show ingratitude at him. Regardless, she returned her Emerald Shards as thanks. After restoring the Master Emerald, Knuckles left with it, but not before swallowing his pride and apologizing to Rouge for hurting her. No sooner, Knuckles found Sonic appearing in front of him when he escaped from a doomed capsule using Chaos Control with a fake Chaos Emerald, who told Knuckles to go help Tails and Amy while he destroyed the Eclipse Cannon. After the Eclipse Cannon was stopped, Knuckles and Sonic met Rouge, who told them that the ARK was on a collision course with planet. Knuckles and the others then saw a recording of

   . Banding together with Eggman, Knuckles and the group came up with the plan to use the Master Emerald to deactivate the seven Chaos Emeralds, which was powering the cannon's core, to stop the Space Colony's crash course. When Knuckles and Sonic made it to the core, they were attacked by the
   Biolizard
   , but Shadow arrived and held it off. Knuckles used the Master Emerald and shut down the Chaos Emeralds, but the Biolizard warped outside the ARK and became the

After Super Sonic and Super Shadow beat the Finalhazard and brought the ARK back into orbit, Knuckles found Sonic returning alone, informing them that Shadow had seemingly died. Knuckles then asked Rouge what she planned to do and was content to hear she considered giving up treasure hunting, before they returned to Earth. (

   When Knuckles and Tails received a letter from Dr. Eggman, who claimed to have created "the ultimate weapon" to conquer the world and challenged them to stop him within three days, the two used the Tornado 2 to find Sonic and bring him the news. As Knuckles was confident they could handle it, he and Tails joined Sonic in stopping Eggman's scheme, officially forming
   Team Sonic
   . Beginning their mission by tracking Dr. Eggman, Team Sonic found the doctor at Ocean Palace, where they were attacked by the
   Egg Hawk

   and only having until sunset, Knuckles and his team headed for
   Bullet Station
   and destroyed Eggman's base there. Team Sonic found Eggman in the

After the battle, Team Sonic followed Eggman and Shadow to Hang Castle, where Knuckles teased Tails by saying that it could have been Shadow's ghost they saw. After infiltrating the castle and escaping Mystic Mansion, Team Sonic was attacked by Eggman's Robot Storm, but defeated it. After that, Team Sonic got to the Egg Fleet and went straight for the Final Fortress where they destroyed the colossal flagship's core. Team Sonic then found Eggman in his Egg Emperor and defeated him. After destroying much of the Egg Fleet, Knuckles teased Sonic with how he would have stood no chance without their help, but was surprised when Sonic agreed. Knuckles and Tails then watched Sonic escaping as Amy arrived. Later, Team Sonic and the other teams saw the return of

Soon after, Knuckles joined Sonic and Tails as they headed off to find their next adventure. (

In Glyphic Canyon, Knuckles attempted to assist G.U.N. by driving off the Black Arms infesting the area. Upon meeting Shadow, who had just been teleported to the ruins, Knuckles filled him in on the Black Arms around them and requested his assistance in clearing the area of the Black Arms. In

As Eggman was in disbelief that his grandfather would betray the planet, Black Doom paralyzed everyone with a special gas and left them to be devoured by his alien offspring. As the end seemed near, Shadow suddenly heard Maria asking for help and he broke through the paralysis. Black Doom fled, leaving behind Shadow, the only hope for the planet.

   Eventually, Knuckles Man and Rose Woman were left the last Roboticized Masters standing, and engaged Mega Man and Sonic in a battle that led to their return to normal. Sonic teased Knuckles over his Roboticization, jokingly inquiring whether or not he was tricked into undergoing the process or kidnapped, either of which would have been embarrassing. Knuckles gained a measure of revenge, however, as Sonic was then set upon by a tearful Amy. After being introduced to Mega Man, Knuckles was eager to join the fight against the evil doctors, and joined Tails in going to reunite with Proto Man and the Chaotix. The team of heroes soon gathered together, and were joined by Shadow,

However, the pressures of his quest to find the spirit, his concern over Angel Island, and Vector's impatience grew to be too much for him, and he announced his intentions to leave.

The Hooligans took advantage of its appearance to seize Chip and the Emerald, blasting all the exits to the mine except the one that they took to escape before sealing it behind them. Left with only a flooded tunnel-too long to swim through without an air supply-to escape through, Vector reasoned upon a scheme that carried them along with water current to escape the cavern. They then intercepted the Hooligans, only to be attacked by the Titan again, but managed to trick Bean into attacking it. Recovering Chip and the Emerald, they sent the Hooligans fleeing with a sabotaged Chaos Emerald sensor. Knuckles then finished off the Dark Gaia Titan, and suggested that he take the Chaos Emerald and Chip back to Angel Island for safe-keeping. He and Chip return to

The trio then came upon Eclipse's wrecked shuttle, but before they could enter, Fixit contacted them to warn them that Eclipse was attacking the shrine. Arriving after Eclipse had been driven off, Knuckles was enraged when Shadow informed him of his decision to move the Master Emerald to a

   After briefly fighting him near the Master Emerald Shrine, Knuckles used his considerable strength to throw Shadow to the
   Azure Lake Zone
   and pursued him there. While the fight proved difficult, Knuckles refused to give up, reflecting on the many misfortunes that had befallen the Master Emerald on his watch and vowing not to let it happen again. Unfortunately, his fight with Shadow allowed Eclipse and the Dark Arms to seize the Master Emerald. Breaking off their fight, the two heroes moved to intercept Eclipse and engaged him and his Dark Arms in battle. Though they gained the upper hand in the fight, Eclipse managed to escape defeat with the help of the Dark Arm known as
   Rhygenta
   . Ultimately, with the only other option being allowing Eclipse to escape with the Emerald, Knuckles shattered it for the second time in his life. Fortunately, Angel Island was kept aloft by the same forces holding the shattered planet in place, and Knuckles set off to recover the Master Emerald fragments yet again. (

After Nack won against Bean, Amy and Knuckles began their fight. Amy got pumped to take down Knuckles and face Sonic in the finals, but started over-analyzing the situation and worrying about disappointing or hurting her Hedgehog hero. While she was distracted, Knuckles, unaware that she wasn't ready yet, easily defeated her with an explosive punch that sent her flying into the spectator seats. His next match was against Nack, who attempted to psych Knuckles out by bringing up his failure to protect the Master Emerald and his going overboard during the fight with Amy. Knuckles remained stoic the whole time, waiting for Nack to get in close enough for him to grab the Weasel and handily defeat him. With that, Knuckles moved on to the championship round against Sonic, with both of them arguing over who had won more of their previous battles. During the course of their bout, Knuckles got frustrated with Sonic showing more concern for how Breezie had obtained the Emerald than the battle, and again when he informed Sonic why he wasn't on Angel Island. The Hedgehog offered to throw the fight so that Knuckles could continue his quest, but Knuckles refused to let his rival off so easily. Their bout was interrupted by the Hooligans' sabotage of Casino Park's defenses, and the two heroes put aside their conflict to stop Metal Sonic from stealing Breezie's Chaos Emerald. Afterwards, with the Chaos Emerald in hand, Knuckles and Chip joined the Freedom Fighters, and were given an unexpected introduction to Sonic's

   While aboard the Sky Patrol, Knuckles briefed the Freedom Fighters on what had happened to the Master Emerald and his efforts to find its fragments; at the same time, he had to defend himself against Amy's grudge for her humiliating defeat in the tournament. Upon learning that he was relying upon his somewhat limited treasure hunting sense to find the fragments, Amy suggested helping him through the use of her

   Knuckles is a red echidna with purple eyes. He bears a white crescent mark on his chest. Officially, he's slightly taller than Sonic. He wears white gloves similar to boxing gloves and has two spiked knuckle-claws on each hand. He wears green, yellow and red footwear with a metal "Lego" plate atop each shoe. Like many characters in the comic, he initially was given light-blue eyes before SEGA established his eye color as purple.

  <p key="3b34abd2-e187-418e-b811-baea1cf3beff">
   Knuckles is an incredibly strong individual, and served as the muscle of Team Sonic; his techniques include a punch around which a fiery aura appears that is devastating to anything hit by it. He can also glide through the air using his long spines, and his namesake spikes are both effective in combat and for climbing up walls or digging. In addition to his combat prowess, Knuckles is skilled to a degree in footwork and utilize the
   Spin Dash
   attack as seen during his fight with Shadow. Due to his connection to the Master Emerald, Knuckles has limited mystical abilities, including being able to sense the presence of Master Emerald shards or Chaos Emeralds and hone in on their position. He can also utilize
   Tikal's Prayer
   to grant himself a brief boost in power, as seen the second time that he shattered the Master Emerald.

   Knuckles and Rouge have had a strange relationship since their first meeting, due in part to the fact that Rouge attempted to steal the Master Emerald and Knuckles is sworn to protect it. Knuckles has often been the recipient of Rouge's flirtatious nature, and she delights in teasing him.

  <p key="3f0eb4b5-20a2-4671-a9c7-a142b26d67bd">
   So far, Knuckles' relationship with Relic seemed to be something that he just tolerates. Possibly because of her energy and desire to investigate every inch of Angel Island, he seems to view her as more of a bother, though he does trust her enough to let her watch the Master Emerald, though he has a major desire to get back before she did anything. However, when Vector teased Knuckles about Relic being his girlfriend, his reaction - to glare at him - shows that he doesn't view her in that way, most likely because his duty as Guardian of the Master Emerald comes first. In interactions with Relic herself, however, he seems to appreciate her presence, and does his best to apologize when he inadvertently makes it seem like she's unwelcome. When Rouge made a similar guess about their relationship, Knuckles was embarrassed and had to explain to an astonished Relic that he hadn't made any claims about her being his girlfriend.

  </h2>
  <p key="9fd16264-8ba7-4be6-ae56-39fcf194fb90">
   Knuckles is a very driven individual with an almost single-minded focus on protecting Angel Island and the Master Emerald from anyone who would do them harm. However, he also recognizes the danger the Master Emerald poses in the hands of villainous powers, and has demonstrated on more than one occasion a willingness to shatter it into fragments in order to keep it safe. Knuckles has also demonstrated enough sense to realize that a threat to the planet is a threat to his island as well, and has left Angel Island on more than one occasion in order to combat a threat to the world. In this he often finds himself working alongside Sonic and Tails, though he and Sonic enjoy a friendly rivalry in addition to friendship.
  </p>
  <p key="4440ffdf-4c50-48a3-8683-3b32f4f60d38">
   Knuckles has proven somewhat gullible over the years, with Dr. Eggman tricking him into fighting Sonic on several occasions. He is hot-tempered and quick to act without thinking, usually choosing violence over discussion. Patience is another area in which Knuckles is not at his strongest, but despite this he is a trustworthy friend and powerful ally.
  </p>
  <p key="8162453f-3e07-426f-90db-8e2bad9f5aaf">
   According to several media, his favorite food is grapes. He is also afraid of ghosts, as seen in the game Sonic Adventure 2 at the beginning of the battle against King Boom Boo.
