   While the Ancient Walkers were three distinct individuals, their unity of purpose was such that they seemed identical in personality. They felt great concern for Mobius, but at the same time a belief that they could not interfere too directly in the affairs of its inhabitants except in situations of the most dire need. While often enigmatic, they were also supportive, and expressed great confidence in their chosen champions and emissaries.

   They appeared before others most often as three floating masks: two face-masks and one fully covering its wearer's head in helmet-like fashion. Though generally represented by these floating masks there were instances where their corporal bodies were seen. In these instances, the Bird-Mask Walker had a large and stocky green
   Mobosaur
   body with a yellow-orange belly, as opposed to his fellow walkers who were smaller. The bird-masked Walker was also known to carry a stake of wood and wear a golden amulet of some sort. The other land-based Walker had a smaller, slimmer body with darker green scales and a yellow belly, and carried an ornate staff with a golden ring encircling its spherical end. The Pterodactyl Walker had no attire besides his mask, and was brown-skinned.

As a result, their potential abilities were virtually limitless, and can be presumed to have included every Chaos power displayed by other wielders of this energy and more that are known to no one. Of their vast abilities, those that are known are the ability to move themselves or others between Zones, halt the passage of time while interacting with someone, transmit dreams into the minds of others, manipulate reality to the point of reassembling someone who had been taken apart by another Chaos Force wielder. They also possessed the unique ability-which they used against Mammoth Mogul-to "curse" Chaos Emeralds, causing their users to make fatal misjudgments and bring about their own defeats, though this was only known to have been employed once.
