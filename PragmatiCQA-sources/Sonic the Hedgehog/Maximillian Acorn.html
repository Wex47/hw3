Unable to see Nate perform treason and feeling sympathy for him because Nate had been there during his upbringing, Maximillian was deeply troubled when Kodos and Naugus accused Nate of providing their location to a group of Overlander scouts. To spare Max of the trouble, Nate imposed self-exile and left the kingdom, much to Max's dismay. (

Matters came to a head when a group of Freedom Fighter illusions inflamed Max's anger, allowing Ixis Naugus to gain control of his mind. Eager to assert control, Naugus soon had the city of Mobotropolis embroiled in civil war, and only when the real Freedom Fighters returned after defeating
   Master Mogul
   was Max freed of Naugus's influence by a Sword of Acorns wielding Sonic. Reclaiming his Sword, Max was able to summon the Crown from the
   Hall of Limbo
   , which had been inside his mind the whole time, and was thus restored to normal. (

The rescue was a success and Alicia finally woke from her coma sometime after. Unfortunately, the mission resulted in Max's paralysis at the hands of a Shadowbot, confining him to a wheelchair for considerable period afterwards. Max gave the role of acting ruler to Elias, who in turn had his decisions made by Secret Service member Geoffery. One of those orders involved Sonic being stripped of his knighthood and confined in Knothole after stealing and losing the Sword of Acorns. Sonic would defy Elias' wishes on a number of occasions in order to get it back, but the King lifted the hedgehog's confinement after Sonic thwarted an attempt by

   When his old general Amadeus Prower rebelled against the monarchy, Max was outraged, denying Amadeus's criticism of the House of Acorn despite the merits of Amadeus's accusations. Moreover, he used the opportunity - and Amadeus's short imprisonment - to try and, clearly failed, to plant mistrust of Sonic in Elias's mind. Influenced by his father, Elias ended up facing Amadeus in a duel, which was luckily brought to a halt by Sally, who settled the differences of the two and worked with them to create a new form of government.

   Max seemed to grow increasingly distant and reclusive over time, causing concern from his wife. It would soon become clear that despite the time passed, he was unwilling to accept the new republic. Eventually, he decided he wished to speak with Geoffrey St. John and tasked the commander with finding a way to return the monarchy to "proper authority." Geoffrey convinced the former king he had a plan that would enable him to do so, and so Max granted him permission to act as he saw fit. When his son asked Doctor Quack if Max is plotting to take back the throne, the doctor dismissed the allegations, saying that Max's current condition has prevented him from being a significant threat to anyone, and his "good days" were becoming even more infrequent with time.

   Unfortunately, Max had made yet another grave mistake in judgement in trusting St. John. It turned out that Geoffrey, since his childhood, had secretly been affiliated to the Order of Ixis's remnants as an apprentice wizard. His master was none other than Ixis Naugus, whom St. John had recently decided to return to glory. With his sanity restored and Geoffrey by his side, Naugus arrived in New Mobotropolis a few days later with the intent of finally claiming the crown for himself. Aside from recently growing public fear of NICOLE (after she was possessed during the

   was severely damaged and forced to retreat, but in the process, he had gained a new servant when Sally allowed herself to be roboticized in order to prevent the mad doctor from destroying the world - the first of multiple crushing losses the Freedom Fighters would suffer over the next few days. Worse still, without Sally's leadership and diplomacy skills, Elias was effectively dethroned and Naugus was crowned king - a change instantly accepted by the common people. As Sonic &amp; co. continued to try and stop the wizard, Elias went home to tell his parents the bad news (

   Max, of course, was as deeply shocked by the recent events as almost everyone else. Shortly thereafter, Elias decided he and his family were no longer safe in the city and tried to convince his parents to come with him, but Max, couldn't go due to his condition, and his wife did not want to leave him. His options running out, Elias went to see Harvey Who, whom Max had told him was always there to "watch his back". Harvey, though, had come to consider Max crazy for not originally following his advice, and consequently refused Elias aid at first. However, the old owl changed his mind upon seeing that the boy was a better ruler than his father. The next day, Max was present to watch his son's departure from New Mobotropolis. Before long, though, Elias would secretly return as part a team of

It is not exactly clear at this point whether or not Max's condition had improved or worsened, but obviously the old ex-king was not looking any better than before (

   Indeed, Max's health was apparently degrading with each passing day, likely due to the strain of the loss of his daughter and the downfall of his family. Meanwhile, Naugus was also suffering from health issues after the Death Egg's assault awakened his inner demons. After his latest scheme fell through thanks to Elias and his team, Naugus's mutations worsened, impeding his attempts to maintain control of New Mobotropolis. Naugus thus started searching for a vessel to inhabit as he tried to find a way to recover. His first choice was Max. He offered to "heal" his old ally, effectively reversing his increasing physical and mental frailty, whilst privately planning to take possession of Max again. By this point, Max had gotten to the point where even basic speech had become difficult for him. Despite this, he could still talk, and declined Naugus's offer with a simple "No". Naugus tried to reason with Max, but Alicia, having heard enough, sent the wizard away. Weakly, Max thanked his wife, and she embraced him in turn. Along with the rest of Mobius, the pair were then caught up in the effects of the second Genesis Wave. (

   . Although, this would turn out to be somewhat of a mixed blessing for the King, who in this new reality was now in perfect health in both body and mind. With his old life now a forgotten dream, the new King Acorn continued to be a fair ruler over his Kingdom, while still worrying about the safety of his daughter... (

   King Max's personality is hard to peg down, particularly because of his link to the Source of All and trauma from his stay in the Zone of Silence. There are two constants to King Max's personality: his deep love for his kingdom and his intense love for his family. Early on, he was a wise and just ruler, as well as a devoted husband and father. He is, however, tradition bound to a fault, which had put him in conflict with his children on numerous occasions, the most prevalent examples being his attempts to arrange marriage between Sally and Antoine, and his fury over Elias' reforming of the government into a republic. He would often put the personal considerations of his family second to what he perceived as necessary duty.

   He is also prone to prejudice - in particular against Robians - which Ixis Naugus was able to capitalize on. However, he is normally wise enough to act in spite of his prejudices rather than because of them. Perhaps his most notable trait is his bad judge of character, having failed to recognize the true colors of Naugus, Kodos, and the original Robotnik until it was too late and ignoring all of Harvey Who's warnings about them.
  </p>
  <p key="2271ecb3-d879-4dbe-8564-c96391457de8">
   Max's attitude with regards to Sonic vary widely depending on the situation. He showed an almost immediate dislike for Sonic upon his recovery, despite the fact that Sonic saved his mind twice before. This was likely a combination of Sonic's lack of obedience and Sally's interest in him. However, Max changed his tune dramatically after Eggman's arrival, after Sonic was instrumental in preventing the destruction of Knothole. He regarded Sonic as the hero he is for some time thereafter. After Sonic's return from space, King Max gave his wholehearted blessing to Sally's union with Sonic, though after their breakup, he reverted back to his dislike.

   The numerous and intense traumas endured over the course of his life, as well as recent breaks from tradition, seem to have had a heavy impact on Max's mental faculties. Since Elias reformed the government, Max has become increasingly reclusive, harsh and irritable; he's also on occasion seemed slightly forgetful or confused, for example not recognizing Sonic. These traumas could easily contribute to his near bipolar personality.

   Maximilian Acorn is a brown squirrel with blue eyes. He shares general coloration with the rest of his family; as such, the two tones of brown used for his fur have varied wildly throughout his depictions, sometimes resulting in the light brown sections appearing peach or even yellowish. He typically wears a blue uniform with gold epaulettes, boots and a red cape. While his hair, mustache and bushy eyebrows were originally auburn, age and stress have resulted in them becoming gray/white. At various points he has been wheelchair-bound, initially due to severe injury resulting in the temporary loss of use of his legs, and later due to general weakness after having been poisoned and ill.

  <p key="6c05661b-1a48-4e28-bd11-a4600ef09655">
   In initial appearances he was often depicted much taller than the general cast, though this was later rectified; early inconsistent depictions lead some fans to believe he was a fox rather than a squirrel. Often his tail and even hair were forgotten.

   Under the influence of the zone in which he was trapped, the King donned dark armor and a helmet adorned with long horns; at this time he carried a lance. Later on, his body began to gradually crystallize, somewhat resembling an organic, multifaceted Chaos Emerald, though this was eventually reversed. While he initially wore a simple circlet crown, he eventually recovered the more ornate red and gold Crown of Acorns. The details of his clothing have varied between appearances and artists, but they usually retain the key elements; blue long-sleeve uniform, gold epaulettes and red (or blue) cape. Variables include the additions of medals, belts, pants, and white trim on the cape; instead of the sword, he sometimes carried scepters or staffs. While ill or under medical care, he was sometimes depicted in a simple white shirt. He at one point again donned armor, this time silver, and with it carried a large shield and the Sword of Acorns. After stepping down as active ruler, he no longer wore a crown, though he took a new one after reality was altered.
