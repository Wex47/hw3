Break Man was sent against Knuckles, and tried to convince him to help him enact a plot that would weaken the enemy army at the cost of Break Man's power core and possibly his life. However, Knuckles refused to allow the Robot Master to sacrifice himself, and defeated Break Man after a hard battle. Luckily, Break Man and his allies were subsequently freed from the aliens' control by the

   Proto Man is cool and reserved, and unafraid of facing superior odds. While heroic at heart-and apparently somewhat friendly to his siblings-he maintains a cool distance from his creator, Dr. Light, based on previous difficulties between them. Though stubborn, he is also logical, and can be persuaded to take the most reasonable course even if it isn't entirely to his liking.

    Proto Man's character in the altered reality has advanced beyond the usual continuity of the Mega Man comics; in the series beforehand, he was going by the alias "Break Man" and was not only antagonistic towards Dr. Light and Mega Man, but an actual ally of Dr. Wily's. He would return to this name and persona afterwards, and retain the identity of Break Man into Worlds Unite.
