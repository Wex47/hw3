   Silver is a very light gray (almost white) with white fur on his chest surrounding his neck with yellow eyes and tan skin. He wears white gloves with cyan circles with lines sticking out of the bottom leading to his golden bracelets accented in cyan. The tops of his boots are of a similar fashion with a red gem set in gold. The rest of his boots are navy blue, white and cyan. He has two large spines at the back of his head, while at the front of his forehead there are five distinct spines flared up and back, the two final ones covering up most of his ears. The glow from his telekinesis is cyan, though it has often been miscolored green.

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="41e40fc6-5f22-4f95-95f5-b24ffeb02481">
   Silver has a strong sense of justice and it is this personality trait that motivates him to head back into the past to correct the future to help his people at whatever the cost. However, this eagerness to do good is coupled with a strong naivety; he often jumps to conclusions and readily believes anything he's told. Thus he is prone to manipulation and making poor decisions; he often benefits from having someone to assist and guide him in his actions. Somewhat awkward, he has a tendency of hiding behind bravado. While determined to do the right thing, he lacks ruthlessness and sometimes has trouble figuring out the best way to attain his goals. He's also noticeably shy and somewhat polite. This kindliness often clashes with his sense of justice. Silver's sense of justice goes deeper than just saving the future, though. Regardless of his own goals, he is unable to ignore those in need of help and will put his own missions aside if there's someone in danger. He has a certain arrogance about him as well, often becoming overconfident in his powers and previous successes, which can lead him into compromising situations.

   Silver is possessed of the power of psychokinesis, which allows him to move objects-himself included-with his mind. This ability can be used to manipulate energy as well, such as when he set out to close the Genesis Portals. He is also capable, rather like Sonic and Shadow, of undergoing a
   Super Transformation
   through the power of the

   , becoming
   Super Silver
   . Silver also wears a pair of gloves that glow when he uses his powers, and which can apparently project-whether of their own accord or serving as a channel for his power-maps that can be used to pinpoint disturbances in reality.

    Some fans have speculated that Silver could possibly be descended from Shadow, Sonic, Amy or another famous

      There are some similarities between Silver and Trunks (Dragon Ball character) being the most notable their original situation (both characters live in a world in chaos) and their mission in time (to prevent their future from happening) and some fans speculated that Silver could be descended from Shadow, just as Trunks is the son of Vegeta.

Fan reception towards Silver is generally mixed, due mostly to the stigma of being introduced in what has been condemned by fans as one of the worst Sonic games of all time. Despite this, the character himself has been mostly accepted.
