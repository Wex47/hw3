During the fighting, the Super Genesis Wave was unleashed, consuming all of realty in its blinding light as the heroes managed to defeat the doctors. Harnessing the power of the Emeralds for one final act, Sonic and Mega Man prepared to restore their worlds to normal. Mega Man succeeded without incident, but Dr. Eggman launched a final attack against Sonic, greatly disrupting his efforts. (

The entire history of the Prime Zone had been greatly changed, and many other elements along with it: the planets geography had been shifted, with previously existing locations being moved or outright erased, with new locations appearing in their place. Several characters histories had been changed, some on a minor scale (Sally still grew up as a young princess in Mobotropolis) while others where more drastic (Knuckles has now always been the last remaining

    The idea for a crossover between Sonic and Mega Man originated as far back as 2004, in which Patrick Spaziante, who at the time had also illustrated for the defunct Mega Man comic by Dreamwave Comics, approached then-Sonic editor Mike Pollerito with the proposal, but was not at the time doable for several reasons. According to Spaziante, the only idea from that original proposal that transferred over to this crossover was the "Shoes and Helmet" teaser image that was used to announce the event.

    The crossover also is similar to another massive DC crossover known Crisis On Infinite Earths, as both were a 12-part story involving heroes from different universes banding together to stop a threat bent on reshaping the multiverse to their image, and ultimately ending with the multiverse being permanently altered with only a select few being aware of the changes.

      According to Ian Flynn, he originally wanted the comics reboot to be completely clean-cut, in which no character, not even Sonic himself, had any memory of the old world. This was changed at the request of editor Paul Kaminski, who wanted a bridge between the two continuities so as not to completely disorient old readers.

    Coincidentally or not, the crossover happened to take place at the height of Archie's legal problems with former writer Ken Penders, resulting in the removal of Penders's characters from the comics.  Due to this, many fans believe the continuity reboot at the end of the crossover is a direct result of the disputes with Penders and was used by Archie as a way of conveniently removing his characters, seeing as they have apparently been eliminated by the Super Genesis Wave.
