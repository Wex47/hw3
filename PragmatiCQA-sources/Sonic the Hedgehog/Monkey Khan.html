He kidnapped her, declaring that he needed a companion after being alone for so long. However, Sally told him that despite his arrogance, he was obviously very powerful, and that he could use that power to become a true hero. Liking this idea, Khan returned to help Sonic and Antoine finish off the Eggbots, striking them with lightning. He then departed to resume his life after his long imprisonment. (

Khan eventually built up his courage, however, and intervened to save Bunnie's life. However, while distracted conversing with the Iron Queen,

He proved too powerful for the Freedom Fighters, but in the end Sonic used a Power Ring from the Lake of Rings to break the Iron Queen's hold and restore Khan back to his former self. After Sonic restored back to his former self, Khan told Sonic and the gang how he destroyed the Dragon Kingdom by letting Regina take control of him. With low self esteem Monkey Khan was going to give up the fight against the Iron Dominion till Rosie's children convinced him to fight. (

He then helped Bunnie get to the edge of the city, where they taunted the Iron Queen and Iron King for a failed attempt of attacking New Mobotropolis from them. After Sonic had a little exchange with Dr. Eggman, Khan asked Sonic why he had compassion for Eggman when he nearly destroyed everything he's cared for time and again. Sonic's reply was that he just lived in the now and does what's right at the time. Khan reply to that was, "You're either a Zen Master or a fool but you're impressive either way."

After Tails hit the switch on the device and transported Sonic and Sally into the digital world, Monkey Khan was left thinking for some other way to end this. He came to the conclusion that the only thing to do was to put NICOLE out of her misery, but Tails realized what he was up to and intervened by taking him on before he could get to New Mobotropolis. Tails protested that despite him thinking NICOLE couldn't possibly regain self-control under the Iron Queen's power, Khan was wrong and Sonic and Sally could save her if they saved Bunnie and himself. Eventually Tails convinced Monkey Khan to wait until Sonic and Sally returned before trying anything. When they did, Khan was informed that NICOLE was herself again and was acting as a spy. Sally then ordered everyone to pack up and head for the Dragon Kingdom in order to bring the fight to the Iron Dominion's homeland and wreck their support. (

After this, negotiations began with the Bride of Endless Reach, and Khan introduced himself as the King of the

   Khan's response was to approach Espio with his Atom-Bat powering up, only for Sonic to come to the chameleon's defence. Monkey Khan said Espio was nothing more than a traitor, but Sonic argued he was a friend long before that. Then Khan counter-argued that he had attacked them, and Sonic said that both he and Khan had got into many more scuffles with each other than Espio, and by that logic he should be going against Khan himself. He let Sonic have his way, and quietly scolded him for letting Espio off the hook just like he did with Eggman. In order to get the four heroes to accompany him, Espio revealed all their secrets he'd come across as a spy, such as Sonic's alter-ego "The Sneak," Tails's old comic book and the location of Sally's birthmark, which Khan was more interested in than any of his secrets being exposed. Espio revealed he had no secrets on Khan, but confirmed there were other Khans. Monkey Khan was confused about what he meant and thought he was talking about another member of his family, which was impossible, and that the family name Khan was a pretty common one, so Epsio must have been mixed up. Espio soon cleared this up, revealing he was talking about others like Khan himself. (

Khan’s original attire consists of a red-and-green vest with golden plates on the shoulders; it is adorned with taijitu symbols.
