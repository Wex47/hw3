   Sigma was once the leader of a force of Reploids designed to halt rampaging

Sigma was eventually corrupted by the virus, and began to see humanity as oppressors who were holding the Reploids back from their full potential.

   began feeding the power of the fusing worlds into him. However, when his two new commanders turned on each other, Sigma realized that he had been betrayed by Eggman and Wily, and sent several of the Zeti to hunt them down. The pair managed to escape with aid from

   The heroes succeeded in defeating Sigma's Mechaniloids and the Deadly Six, but Sigma's new army had been completed in time. Worse yet for the heroes, Sigma had also crafted a massive new body-known as Sigma-2-for himself befitting his new power, which he entered before emerging from the Lost Hex to tower over his minions and foes alike. As his Mavericks menaced the outnumbered and weary heroes, Sigma contemplated the power he had received from the dying

Seeing the heroes barely able to stand, he called back most of his Mavericks, opening an array of new Genesis Portals and dispatching them with Unity Engines to various worlds. He left a handful behind to finish off the heroes, and then turned his attention towards seeking out other worlds that he could harvest for power. However, his foes were unexpectedly joined by heroes from the

   and other intelligences. He moreover considers himself superior to other beings, and takes a sadistic pleasure from forcing other beings to do his bidding. Like Dr. Eggman before the Super Genesis Wave, his desire for power is such that he is willing to tamper with the very fabric of reality, both through utilizing the Genesis Portals and creating the Unity Engines. Sigma is also a master manipulator, maneuvering heroes and villains alike to his own ends, and thinks big when formulating a plan. His greatest weakness is his massive ego, which leads him to believe he is invincible despite his past defeats.

   , his programming is apparently beyond their command. How he gained command of the Genesis Portals is unknown, but he is shown to have great control over them, being able to open new portals at will. In his Sigma-1 form he also gained the ability to use the power of the Genesis Portals and Unity Engines to clone various minions. His powers were heightened in his Sigma-2 body, which possessed immense strength and the ability to open multiple Genesis Portals at will. After shedding this body to become Sigma-3, his power became even greater, such that he was able to take on both Super Sonic and Super Mega Man with little effort.

  <p key="8d3fa535-ee8d-4cde-89a3-5c0a2b1fa82f">
   Sigma loosely resembles a tall, muscular human man with a bald head and a cleft chin, but is easily recognizable as a robot due to his blue optic sensors, which have purple markings around them. A circular red protrusion is visible on his forehead, and in place of ears he has circular metal forms on the sides of his head. The rest of his body is visibly metallic, with green armor on the torso and blue on the forearms and white hands. His thighs are covered with black material, while around his knees are rings of spikes matching those on his wrists. A red belt encircles his waist with a metallic plate descending from the front of it, and his lower legs and feet resemble brown boots with yellow bottoms and metal bands linking the sides of his ankle on either foot. Sigma also favors a high-collared cape with a red side-usually turned outwards-and a purple side-turned inwards-decorated with gray armor on the shoulders.
  </p>
  <p key="a5fa2d37-5a03-46d8-93ae-785f1c40febe">
   Prior to departing for Sonic's World, Sigma appeared in holographic form as a gigantic, purple-tinged version of his usual head. During his alliance with the Deadly Six, Sigma's design was modified in a number of ways. His shoulder armor on the outside of the cape gained black accents on the gray, and he donned a new cape that retained the purple interior but changed its exterior to black. His torso, forearm, and lower leg armor became red, while his feet became green and black. Instead of his old belt, Sigma donned a new one with an emblem buckle mixing the insignias of Drs. Wily and Eggman: a Skull with what looked like Eggman's mustache coming out from behind it.
  </p>
  <p key="b4abb96c-e2ea-4e1a-bc1e-1d32d962436c">
   Sigma later adopted a gigantic body, many times the size of his normal form and larger than even the Sky Patrol. The torso of this form had a stylized design resembling the head of Zavok, leader of the Deadly Six. This form lacked a lower body, and was instead fused into the Lost Hex. His final form was closer in size to his original body with white and black armor.
