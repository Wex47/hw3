During his time as the Kingdom of Acorn's Royal Wizard, he helped instigate events that led to the Great War, and then fled to the Zone of Silence as a safe haven where he was trapped for years until he managed to escape after the First Robotnik War. Naugus became an immediate enemy of Sonic the Hedgehog, who eventually trapped him in the zone again until the Arachne released him once more. After being a prisoner in Dr. Eggman's Egg Grape Chambers, Naugus lost his sanity and blindly served his order's founder, Mammoth Mogul, until his mind was restored by a Chaos Emerald from his apprentice. Following this, he plotted to retake the throne from the Acorn family and succeeded through manipulating the fears of New Mobotropolis' populace, who crowned him king, only to face further difficulties.

   . They worked together in an attempt to learn about the

   Despite treachery from each of them, they fell into the sun together at the same time and then back to Mobius. This resulted in the birth of Ixis Naugus, a being with the merged body and talents of all three and mastery of fire to boot, but with no memory of his origins. The three wizards did not perish though; instead, Naugus became an entirely separate personality and their spirits were locked in the back of his mind. (

   After a prolonged period, Naugus finally managed to get in again by using the elemental form of earth to pass through the walls. This allowed him to appear right in Morgan's immense Power Ring storehouse, and Naugus absorbed a massive amount of the
   Magic Rings

   Ultra Naugus

The three fought, but the energy Ultra Sonic and Hyper Tails used burned up too fast, forcing them back to their normal states, and it seemed as though Naugus had won. Not wanting to leave any loose ends, Naugus then tried to kill Nate so that he could not interfere, but was blasted back into the Zone of Silence when Morgan used the energy of a Power Ring housed inside his eyepiece, putting an end to the crazed wizard's ambitions for the time being.

   After Mogul established himself as a
   casino
   owner, Naugus was kept out of sight so that he would not upset the clientele, spending his days hissing and drooling in a completely unaware state of being. He was present and chained in Mogul's office when his secret apprentice: Geoffrey St. John arrived, carrying a chaos emerald, which he intended to use to restore Naugus' sanity, which, in a roundabout way, could potentially benefit Mogul's business and—most importantly—make Sonic miserable.

   With Mogul's permission, Geoffrey gave the Chaos Emerald to Naugus, and the resulting surge of power restored his sanity. After crafting himself a staff topped with his new Emerald, he violently reprimanded St. John, enraged that his secret apprentice had failed to eliminate the Acorn family or preserve the kingdom. Geoffrey replied that the Acorns were needed to maintain the new kingdom, and insisted that his skills would help the evil wizard claim the throne. Naugus reluctantly followed the skunk, promising to take care of some unfinished business with Mogul, but immediately praised his apprentice after hearing how he back-stabbed Sonic and left him stranded in the Special Zone. Amidst pouring rain, Naugus arrived on the outskirts of New Mobotropolis, and while his apprentice updated him on current events, he once more plotted to take the crown. (

   Within New Mobotropolis, he and his apprentice traveled to the Coliseum via Naugus' shadow-melding powers (an experience Geoffrey greatly disliked), where they watched Mina's concert from afar. Sensing a "poison fog" of fear, Naugus used his magic to amplify the citizens' emotions, causing them to react strongly to Mina's musical message of suspicion against NICOLE. Referring to similar trickery that ignited the Great War, Naugus told his apprentice that Mobotropolis' citizens would soon be "baying for blood", and when the time came, they would call out for him to "save them".

   For a time, Naugus and Geoffrey continued to lay low, allowing the citizen's paranoia and fear to escalate. Finally, when they felt the time right, they made a grand public entrance, with Geoffrey announcing Naugus as the rightful king. Naugus boasted to the people that with him as their ruler, they would not need to fear NICOLE; when the AI attempted to capture him in a nanite construct, the wizard used his magic to turn the nanites to crystal and shatter them. He then told the amazed crowd that NICOLE had no sway over him, and that he simply planned to go meet with the

Striding into a meeting, Naugus boldly announced his intentions to the council, only for Sonic to suddenly strike him (having gotten in through an uncovered window). Despite some hesitation, Elias handed his sword to Sonic at the latter's request, saying that the crown would defer to him when it came to dealing with Naugus. Naugus, angered, told Sonic that his claim had nothing to do with him, but the hedgehog refused to back down. (

However, Sonic was insistent on ending it before it could happen, once more risking treason by disobeying the group's authority.

   Unwilling to accept it, his enemies tried again by revealing a hospitalized and half-crystallized
   Bunnie
   who was getting weaker by the minute. Spinning this to his advantage as well, the villainous wizard led the masses to the hospital where he intended to rectify his mistake made during the battle. Though Naugus had meant to undo the crystallization he was stunned to see that his sorcery had also restored the rabbit's organic limbs. The wizard-king swiftly dismissed it, claiming he had done so on purpose to reward the valiant heroine for her efforts in protecting his kingdom, and was once more met with cheers from the citizens. Later that day, Geoffrey was arrested for treason. (

   Naugus attended Geoffrey St. John's trial, but was bored the entire time. After Geoffrey told of how he came to be Naugus' servant and declared guilty of treason, Naugus used his new position to grant his servant a pardon, a once annual power belonging to the Republic of Acorn's king. When Naugus found out that ex-king Elias was planning on leaving the city for Feral Forest, his old home, he contacted Eggman through his chaos emerald and told the doctor when the movement was going to happen, resulting in a battle that left Antoine wounded but Elias alive.

   Naugus later reasoned with the council that they had no option but to exile NICOLE from the city as a threat. When
   Penelope
   questioned if they could realistically exile her, NICOLE replied that the city could function without her, but that she would be needed for new buildings or defensive measures. Naugus interjected that he was the city's protector, and that the citizens could build what they needed. The resulting vote resulted in all of the council except for Rotor voting to exile NICOLE. The motion carried and Rotor decided to resign out of protest. Later, Sonic and Rotor went to the council and proposed splitting the Freedom Fighters into

   Naugus soon embarked on a scheme to bring him absolute control, starting with daily trips to the crater left by the Armada's destruction of Castle Acorn. Descending into the depths, he created a secret
   Ritual Chamber

   Lyco

Tormented again by his components, Naugus took on a more monstrous form, startling his pursuers, whom he attempted to destroy. After using his powers to reshape the underground with additional tunnels and rock spikes, he sent the trio of Freedom Fighters plummeting into the crater with a tornado. (

   Believing the intruders dead, he revealed to a returned Geoffrey his plan after dismissing the Skunk's worries over his grotesque mutations. Using his chamber and Ixis Vale's bones to augment his own power, he planned to enslave the entire city and use them to rebuild the Order of Ixis. Geoffrey objected, but Naugus silenced him with the knowledge that he had betrayed all his former allies and that he had no hope of stopping Naugus alone. He then sent him to search for the bodies of the intruders, unknowingly bringing about a chain of events that would lead to Geoffrey betraying his plan to their enemies. (

   The moment came as Naugus was casting his spell: the heroes-minus Larry Lynx-invaded the chamber, with Silver and Shard taking Naugus head on. Despite his magical prowess, the wizard found himself daunted by the pair, particularly as Geoffrey's own foes prevented him from providing Naugus with his wand. Conjuring stone first to create barriers and then in an effort to crush his foes, Naugus was mocked by Silver, who belittled his powers in comparison to those of

The Hedgehog was rescued by Shard, who destroyed Vale's remains and caused Naugus to desperately attempt to complete the spell, only to have his concentration broken by the Wolf twins, utterly thwarting the spell. Explosives planted by the heroes caused the chamber to start collapsing, and Geoffrey abandoned his master to destruction. Enraged, Naugus changed into his mutated form, trying to block the escape of his enemies and his apprentice. The Freedom Fighters escaped, but Geoffrey was caught and made the excuse of pursuing their enemies. His plan defeated, Naugus contemplated attacking the council, but Geoffrey convinced him to blame the seismic disturbance on a cave in and take credit for saving the city from another disaster. Placated, Naugus released his apprentice and set off to meet with the council. (

   Naugus' former selves and his mutations continued to plague him, even as he found himself dealing with a sudden attitude change from his apprentice. Doing his best to remain composed, Naugus presided over the swearing in of the new council member,
   Isabella Mongoose
   , though doing so required brief contact with the hated and pain-causing Sword of Light. His composure-along with his control over his mutations-faltered when the new councilor called for a reversal of NICOLE's exile. Naugus was quick to declare again that he was the city's protector, only for Isabella to point out his failure in the face of the latest attack by the Death Egg. As the rest of the council went into debate, Naugus excused himself on the basis of feeling ill, telling the council to call upon him only if they came to a tie on the vote. In a desperate situation to heal his body, he desired to possess someone. He sought out King Maximillian offering to make him healthy again using his crystalline magic. Naugus told him that he would have to enter into contract again, but he weakly replied no. Naugus tried to persuade him, but was kicked out by Alicia. Still mocked by the voices, he decided to head to the Hedgehog residence for a different host. He told
   Bernie
   and
   Jules
   that he could use his magic to change him back to normal like Bunnie, but had to put faith into their king. Both of them, including
   Muttski
   , weren't persuaded by him and argued against it since Bunnie didn't need to. Bernadette argued that he may have another motive and Jules could be injured in a process that can't be explained, while Jules states that he drove Mobians and Robians to war, was the enemy of his mentor and tried to kill his son and demanded that he left.

   He was later escorted by Geoffrey to attend Mina's concert seeming more relaxed until he heard the concert was dedicated to NICOLE. As the concert started, Tails Doll caused the stage to collapse and Team Freedom rushed to Mina's and the Forget me Knots' rescue. Geoffrey accused Naugus of causing it, but turned to see Naugus wheezing in pain. Geoffrey escorted Naugus out of the public eye to his thanks, but Geoffrey snapped about Naugus betraying the city with his ideals. He tried to convince Naugus to ask for help and accept the citizens to help him. The voices try to convince him not to show weakness when Naugus had another idea. He pretended to agree with Geoffrey until he revealed that Geoffrey was in contract with him and possessed his body. Using Geoffrey's body, he arrived at the Council of Acorn, who had welcomed NICOLE back to the city. He pretended that he gave full support for her return and confessed that the king was sick and he needed their help. His condition continued to worsen, and NICOLE was rushing to create a machine that might be able to save his life when the second Genesis Wave washed over Mobius. (

   Ixis Naugus's most powerful ability is his knowledge of the Ixian Magicks, giving him power over fire, water, earth, and wind. This gave him a variety of abilities, including manipulating those elements around him and transforming his body or parts of it into them. He was also capable of invading and controlling the minds of others, as evidenced by his brief possession of Maximilian Acorn. He has displayed the ability to manipulate and amplify negative emotions, turning unease into panic, irritation into rage, and wariness into hatred. One of his signature techniques was turning the bodies of his minions into crystal, giving them enhanced strength and the ability to endure the Zone of Silence. His abilities to possess and crystallize others, however, have both been shown to demonstrate limits: he cannot possess or crystallize living beings unless they have entered into a contract with him. The crystallization magic is capable of affecting inorganic matter without apparent difficulty, unless it is backed by magical energy, as in the case of the Power Ring matrix that protected the Death Egg Mark 2.

   After Naugus lost his mind, he also lost these powers, but gained the power to Shadowmeld, a technique that allows him to travel through shadows. He can also take others with him in the process, although Geoffrey St. John claims it is an intensely unpleasant experience. When his mind was restored, Naugus also created a staff to hold his new Chaos Emerald, implying that he may have conjuration abilities now, also regaining his elemental powers. His body was also affected by the reawakening of Agunus, Suguna, and Nusgau, causing it to undergo bizarre mutations, though whether or not this is a benefit to his powers is unclear.

   into whatever he wanted when inside of it, including fusing it together with the
   Void
   . He came to rely rather heavily on this ability, to the point where Mogul accosted him for it during their battle. But seeing as how it is now the
   and ruled by
   Feist
   , it is likely that Naugus can no longer do this. Despite his magical prowess, Naugus is unskilled in terms of hand-to-hand combat, falling to one punch from Bunnie Rabbot and being easily overpowered by the Battle Lord in battle despite his abilities, though he was distracted by the voices of the Ixis Wizards in his head at the time.

   Greedy beyond belief, Ixis Naugus is willing to go to any lengths to increase his own power. Incredibly vengeful, he never forgets being offended, and does his best to pay those who have done so back. Naugus is also partly if not completely insane, making him a dangerous and unpredictable opponent. His mental state has also made him relatively fearless, allowing him to insult his lessers or betters without qualm. The displays of immense ego and treachery are doubtless remnants of his three component personalities, whose own infighting nature led to Naugus' "birth."

   As with many villains, he sees his minions only as pawns to use in his various schemes. In contrast and unlike most villains his level he shows little if any actual dignity, other than a few moments of grandiosity he is mostly a blunt person. He did show a great deal of respect for Mogul during their battle with the Freedom Fighters and Chaotix, though this was only after being trumped in every area and learning of Mogul's identity as the founder of his order. Following his escape from the Egg Grape Chamber, he was seemingly robbed of his intelligence, leaving only blind loyalty to Mogul. After his mind was rejuvenated by the purple Chaos Emerald, Naugus reverted to his old, boisterous self, and lost all loyalty to his former master given Mogul's use of him as a living shield.
