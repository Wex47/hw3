Tails, watching from afar, sadly promised to rescue Sonic as the twins walked off with their captives. In the end, the twins were defeated, and both Sonic and Eggman were set free. Sonic however became reluctant to share the tale of Breezie's betrayal even with his closest friends, though Sally was apparently familiar with her. (

After the three defeated Metal Sonic and saved Amy, Eggman and Metal Sonic fled the fortress. After taking a look at the database on the fortress, Tails realized that there was a deep sea base directly under where they were and that the airship was only for supply shipments, Sonic decided that before pursuing the villains they should collect the seven Chaos Emeralds, which had a habit of showing up when they needed them.

Realizing that something bad had happened, he approached the Chaotix for help, asking them to join the search. (

   As their fight continued, Sonic bragged about having taken down hundreds of robots in the past; when the fight appeared to be a stalemate, Sonic decided to use the surroundings to his advantage, running through Green Hill Zone's loops to boost into Mega Man and then bounce around him in the springs before knocking him off his feet, only to be punched back by the Blue Bomber. Suddenly, a Warp Ring portal appeared behind the heroic robot, created by Mega Man's father, Dr. Light; this distracted Mega Man long enough for Sonic to disable his Mega Buster.

   The two heroes continued their fight, Mega Man repairing his Buster and taking to the air against Sonic with Beat and Rush's aid. Tango's use of a spin dash-esque attack only riled Sonic further. However, as the battle began to endanger civilians, Mega Man again attempted to reason with Sonic, only to be confused as Sonic accused him for Copybot's crimes. As they argued, Tails Man attacked them on Eggman's and Wily's orders. This forced them to put aside their feud to protect nearby civilians and engage the Roboticized Master. Unexpectedly, their combined attacks-Sonic Spin-Dash and Mega Man's charged shot-immobilized the Robian, and Mega Man's weapon copying powers restored Tails to normal. Comparing notes, the two heroes quickly realized the truth: that their respective nemeses Eggman and

With his two friends deciding to rest and regain their strength for the coming battle, Sonic and the others continued forward to find the remaining Masters. Soon afterwards, they met the pair-

Fortunately, they were able to return the two to normal, and after ribbing Knuckles and being tackle-hugged by Amy, Sonic laid out their game plan. Tails and Knuckles left to join Proto Man and the Chaotix, Mega Man and Rush departed to collect Silver and Blaze, and Sonic and Amy took off to find Shadow. (

   Shadow was able to use Chaos Control to save Dr. Light and teleported him onto the battlefield to help the others. Tails was able to hack into the systems and teleported them into the Wily Egg. Once inside, Sonic and Mega Man bantered about the Wily Egg's interior defenses, which were inspired by features from both Death Egg and a typical Wily Castle. At that moment, they ran into the Mega Man Killers. As the two sides engaged, one Mega Man Killer, Punk, used a spin dash-like move to combat Sonic, much to the hedgehog's annoyance. Eventually, Sonic tricked Punk into crashing into his own teammate, Enker. He and Tails then attacked Ballade, but while Sonic managed to land a hit, Tails was hit at point-blank range by one of Ballade's bombs. With Tails too badly hurt to go on, Sonic and Mega Man had Rush carry him out of the Wily Egg. The blue heroes continued further into the Wily Egg, with Mega Man trying to assure Sonic that Tails would be alright. They soon ran into further resistance in the form of the

   Sonic immediately engaged Metal Sonic while Mega Man fought Bass and Treble, Sonic taunting his robotic counterpart with his knowledge of all the defeats the robot had suffered at his hands. Reaching a stalemate with their dark rivals, the blue heroes, realizing they were only being stalled to buy the doctors time, decided to try the old "mix-and-match" strategy of switching opponents. However, this plan almost immediately backfired; Metal Sonic disoriented Mega Man with his speed, while Bass fired too rapidly for Sonic to get in the mid-battle banter he favored. After barely dodging an attack from Treble, Sonic caught a brutal roundhouse kick in the abdomen from Bass. The two then decided to gang up on their rivals one at a time, with Mega Man using all of the abilities he gained from the Roboticized Masters while Sonic helped him along the way. Bass was the first to go down, followed by Treble, and then Metal Sonic. (

   Soon after this, Eggman and Wily burst into the room in their powerful new battle mech, the Egg-Wily Machine-X. Fatigued from the fight with their rivals, Sonic and Mega Man were quickly beaten and knocked unconscious. They later awakened to find themselves imprisoned in containment pods within the heart of the Wily Egg, face-to-face with the evil doctors and the gathered Chaos Emeralds. It was then that Eggman and Wily horrified the blue heroes with the truth of their master plan: to unleash a "Super Genesis Wave" to not only completely remake their universes in their image, but also erase their enemies from existence. As Mega Man tried to reason with Wily, Sonic, struggling to free himself from his prison, inquired to Eggman if he was worried about reality breaking due to his and Wily's tampering with Space-Time. When the doctors expressed little concern about it, Mega Man was disgusted, although Sonic wasn't too surprised. (

   At this point, all seemed hopeless. The Super Genesis Wave was ready to go, Sonic and Mega Man were trapped with no chance of escape, the Chaos Devil was keeping Duo occupied, and Sonic's friends, along with Dr. Light, Proto Man, and Rush, were rapidly losing ground against the Robot Master army. A turning point came, however, with the arrival of the eight original Light Labs Robot Masters, whom Roll had called in to help. With the Light Masters now on the battlefield, Knuckles, Proto Man, Dr. Light, and Rush took the opportunity to break into the Wily Egg. There, the red heroes attacked Eggman and Wily while Dr. Light freed Sonic and Mega Man. At Light's suggestion, Mega Man fused with Rush to don Super Adaptor Armor. Inspired by the word "super" Sonic had Mega Man hoist both of them up to the Genesis Reactor, where the Chaos Emeralds were. Then, as the Super Genesis Wave activated, the blue heroes absorbed the Emeralds' power to become

   . After preventing the evil doctors from killing Knuckles and Proto Man, Mega Man and Sonic instructed them to evacuate Dr. Light and have Duo fall back. A huge battle ensued between the two sides, ending with Sonic and Mega Man emerging victorious. By then, the Super Genesis Wave was already starting to reshape all reality, so Sonic taught Mega Man how to use Chaos Control to restore their worlds to normal. However, Eggman, unwilling to accept defeat, attacked Sonic while his Chaos Control was still charging. After getting Mega Man to restore Earth 20XX, Sonic turned his attention to restoring his own world, which proved to be easier said than done as he struggled to focus Chaos Control under Eggman's assault. Realizing it was all or nothing now, Sonic used Chaos Control. Due to Eggman's interference, however, it was clear something awful was now about to happen to their world. As Sonic wondered what Eggman had done, white light consumed them both... (

Upon freeing their monarch, the pair were surprised to find that he was healthy and cheerful, compared to the elderly and disheveled King they had seen in their other set of memories. After discussing the matter with NICOLE, Sonic and Tails determined that their best course would be to locate the other Freedom Fighters. (

Afterwards, Sonic and Tails reunited with Rotor, both of them noting with surprise the Walrus' vitality given his injuries and girth in their other set of memories. Knowing that it was the only real way to help their friend realize what had taken place, Sonic and Tails handed him NICOLE, granting Rotor his own memories of the other reality. Rotor reacted poorly, but managed to inform the pair that Sally and Bunnie were on deep cover missions, Antoine was with Uncle Chuck in Knothole, and Amy had disappeared mysteriously. (

Sonic and Rotor briefly argued over helping Coral and her friends, but Amy diffused the situation and suggested that they take them aboard the Sky Patrol.

Unfortunately, he refused to send any support to the shrine while the city was under attack, and Sonic and Rotor were left to continue fighting in defense of Meropis.

Sonic began to transform again, only to be interrupted by the Guardian throwing Rotor into him. Just when the pair seemed doomed, however, an unexpected ally arrived:

   Enraged and feral, Sonic attacked and swiftly defeated the Egg Soldiers, and would have killed Thunderbolt had Mighty not engaged him. Between the Armadillo's efforts and Amy and Sally talking him down, Sonic gained a measure of control over himself. The group then returned to Moss' hut, and the return of daylight saw Sonic returned to his normal self. However, he quickly resolved that he couldn't afford to return to the Sky Patrol until he got his new savage side under control. He thus joined Mighty and Ray under Moss' tutelage, though as usual he initially found himself trying to prove his own superiority. Moss quickly deduced that the root of his problem was his need to be in control, and that mastering his Werehog form would require acceptance of his own uncontrollable nature. After gaining this mastery, Sonic found himself confronted by another attack from Thunderbolt: the
   Flying Dynamo
   . However, with his new powers and the aid of Mighty and Ray, he proved triumphant, and soon returned to the Sky Patrol. Finding his teammates beaten and weary after a failed attempt to recover another Chaos Emerald, he rallied their spirits, reminding them of their previous successes. Unfortunately, even Sonic was appalled when Nicole revealed that another Chaos Emerald was in the hands of an old enemy: none other than Breezie. (

   Sonic joined Break Man in traveling to the world of
   Alex Kidd
   , whom they soon recruited to their cause. They later rejoined their allies only to find the Sky Patrol destroyed, but joined the assembled force of heroes and villains in launching a massive attack on Sigma. While they succeeded in defeating his defenders and destroying his giant body, it proved to be a mere protective shell for his ultimate form. Sonic and Mega Man were thus forced to use the Chaos Emeralds to take him on, but even then would have failed had it not been for Eggman and Wily's interference. They managed to destroy Sigma, but his actions had left reality dangerously damaged, and it was only Xander Payne's quick-thinking that saved the universe from annihilation. However, the events of the conflict with Sigma were undone, and Sonic found himself in touch with a very much alive Shadow. The battle wasn't entirely forgotten by Sonic, as he recalled once again fighting alongside Mega Man. (

      Ian has also indicated that Sonic may no longer be romantically involved with any of the female cast members of the comic, possibly due to Sega mandates regarding the reboot and Ian's own dislike of the "shipping wars" that take place between fans who want to see Sonic in a relationship with one particular female character or another.

   Sonic the Hedgehog
   is the title character of Sega's
   flagship video game franchise
   , who first appeared in 1991 in
   his first game
   for the Sega Genesis console (also known as the Mega Drive outside of North America). He was designed in Japan by Naoto Ōshima, who also designed Doctor Eggman. The creation of the character as a new mascot was fueled by Sega's need to counteract against Nintendo, Sega's biggest competitor at the time, and their own equally popular mascot character
   Mario
   . Sonic the Hedgehog as the official mascot also replaced
   Alex Kidd

   mascot from the 1980s. The success of the first Sonic game led to multiple sequels and spin-offs, as well as adaptions in other media such as television and comics, leading to the creation of the licensed Archie Comics series in 1993.

   The comics were originally designed to compliment not just the video games, but also the two upcoming TV shows in-production at the time, where many of the key characters, both protagonists and antagonists, were adapted from. The tradition of adaptations from other media, games and non-games alike, continues to this day. At the time, the comic creatives took great liberties with Sonic's backstory in the comic, which was considerably different to the backstory given in the original Japanese Sega material, for instance, Sonic's birthplace was original stated to be the real-world location of Christmas Island, rather than his Archiveverse birthplace of Mobotropolis. This was before the comics 2013 reboot, however, which changed many aspects of the comics established continuity, bringing it much more inline with the video games, but still borrowing elements from the aforementioned TV show's and other media.
