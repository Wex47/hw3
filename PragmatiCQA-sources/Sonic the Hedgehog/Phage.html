   Needlenose
   to observe a confrontation between Sally and Ellidy regarding the latter's late daughter
   Nikki the Lynx

After cryptically revealing her own nature as a digital being, she admitted that she had been behind the attacks on Nicole's creator and friends. Nicole then enclosed Phage within a firewall, only for Phage to break through. She then stated that she found talking was too slow a means of satisfying her curiosity about Nicole, and attacked. Phage briefly captured her, and revealed herself and her loyalties to Ellidy and Sally. She also took control of Ellidy's other Badniks and sent them to attack

Enraged and in pain, Phage continued her attack on the two girls even as her Badnik forces attempted to recover the yellow Chaos Emerald. Setting the Digital Monsters loose on her foes, she eventually found Sally attempting to escape to an outside system. Phage followed her, determined to destroy her, only for Sally to reveal that Nicole had linked them with a pair of digital
   Sling Rings
   , allowing Nicole to pull her back into Ellidy's system. Nicole then attempted to seal Phage outside, but even injured Phage proved too strong until Ellidy inserted a Red Star Ring into Nicole's handheld. Outraged at the power displayed by
   Overclocked Nicole
   --power she felt should have been hers--Phage was then forcibly barred from Ellidy's systems, though Nicole feared she was still a threat. (

   Via Tails Doll, Phage sneaked aboard the Sky Patrol and disabled its systems, allowing the Battle Bird Armada to sneak up on the Freedom Fighters.  When Nicole came to check the system, Phage revealed herself and attacked her.  Tails put a Red Star Ring into Nicole's handheld, turning her into Overclocked Nicole, but Phage then led her on a wild goose chase.  After the Armada captured

   and crippled the Sky Patrol, Phage revealed that she had only been stalling for time and vanished. (

   Phage is a cruel, sadistic being who thinks nothing of attacking others from surprise or if they are helpless to fight against her. She is intrigued by Nicole's unique nature, but her curiosity is a dark one that seeks satisfaction through violence. Her loyalty apparently lies with Dr. Eggman, but her primary motivation seems to be to add to her own being. Phage also seems to fear her master to some degree, given her desperate efforts to appease him after erring.

   Phage appears to have great power in the Digital World, such as generating firewalls and taking control of computerized devices. Her abilities appear to surpass Nicole's normal capabilities, since she was able to break free of a quarantine program erected by the other A.I. Phage also has stated she exists everywhere in the Digital World, and grows more powerful as she absorbs information. She can also mold her form in various ways, including taking on a a more humanoid form and possibly creating the Digital Monsters. However, her body also contains a spherical core that appears to be her main weakness-any damage done to it causes her significant pain. Even damaged, she is still surprisingly powerful, outmatched only by Overclocked Nicole.

   Phage's appears to wear a white feline mask with triangular ears that have red interiors, glowing yellow eyes, and a pink triangular nose. This mask is also marked by three red rings-one on each cheek and one on her forehead-that are connected to her eyes and the back of her head by three red lines. The rest of her body is an amorphous mass of black, capable of manifesting a mouth with incredibly sharp teeth. She can shape this mass to take on different forms, and briefly approximated Nicole's form. Phage's mask appears to lose structural integrity when she becomes enraged: the more intense her rage, the more her mask crumbles until nothing remains of it.

    Phage's name is the informal form of bacteriophage, which refers to a bacterial virus; it is derived from the Greek term phagein, which translates into English as "to devour." (
