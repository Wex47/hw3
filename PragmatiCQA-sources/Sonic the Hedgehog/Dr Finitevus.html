   Before becoming an albino Echidna with Chaos energy-manipulating powers, Dr. Finitevus was an ordinary Echidna residing in Albion. An ambitious and brilliant scientist, he was particularly interested in Chaos energy and offered promising talent in Albion's research of Chaos radiation. He was also a student of technology from

This massive surge of Chaos radiation not only mutated Finitevus into an albino Echidna, but corrupted his mind into believing the world was corrupt and needed to be purged. The interruption also caused Knuckles to remain in his Chaos-form, becoming even more powerful than he had been before the ill-advised attempt. (

Upon realizing the effects the Chaos radiation had on his psyche and the danger he posed with his mastery of the Chaos Force, the

   Following Albion's destruction, Dr. Finitevus joined the Dark Legion and offered to save a dying Dimitri, no one knowing that he had ulterior motives in mind, namely learning more of the nature of Chaos by dissecting Dimitri's body. Finitevus did indeed save Dimitri, but at the cost of his body, leaving him as a floating head in a glass ball. It has been assumed that the doctor told the rest of the Dark Legion that Dimitri had died during the operation, as Lien-Da apparently thought he was dead. Finitevus then captured the

Knuckles demanded an explanation from Finitevus for Remington's apparent amnesia, and the doctor explained how he had saved Remington from Eggman's Egg Grapes, which had drained him of his memories.

The doctor continued to explain how he had gotten Lien-Da and Remington to work together, promising some of the Master Emerald's power so they could crush the Dingoes.

Lien-Da and Remington tried to stop him, but Finitevus revealed how Knuckles taking the Master Emerald's power was part of his plan.

   as well as the Egg Fleet, he had found that the Egg Grapes had drained much power from him and so he teleported back to the Master Emerald Chamber on Angel Island, where Dr. Finitevus was still hiding. Finitevus had started repowering Enerjak with the emerald when, suddenly, Sonic entered the chamber (Spindashing Finitevus in the process) and used this as a chance to take some of the Master Emerald's power, becoming

   once more. However, Finitevus actually seemed delighted about this. A while before the new Enerjak was made, Finitevus explained his motives to Scourge. He was angry at the fact that many generations of Guardians and Dark Legion Grandmasters had accomplished nothing short of ruining the lives of countless Echidna families, and believed the world was irreparably corrupt and needed to be destroyed so it could be revived anew. He had decided to use Enerjak to cleanse the planet, thinking it fitting that as the war between the Brotherhood and Grandmasters began with him, it, along with everything else, would be ended by him.

   While Finitevus anticipated that Sonic, like Knuckles, would fall victim to his spell, Sonic's positive aura somehow prevented the hex from affecting him.

As insurance against the efforts of Knuckles' various allies, he had "locked" his spell on the Master Emerald, preventing anyone from tapping into it and thus helping Knuckles, taunting that it could only be broken by someone sacrificing him or herself. Julie-Su and Archimedes were both willing, shocking the doctor, but then Locke stepped forward, hoping to mitigate his failures as a father. Finitevus vicously attacked the trio, determined to kill them to prevent them from interfering, but was then teleported away by Archimedes long enough for Locke to fulfill his task. Returning, Dr. Finitevus was attacked by a vengeful Knuckles, who knocked him to the edge of the island. Knuckles demanded he get back up, but Finitevus merely smiled and allowed himself to drop, falling into a Warp Ring. (

The two engaged in a brief but intense battle, which ended as Julie-Su came to Knuckles' aid by shooting Dr. Finitevus with her pistol and the Guardian threw Finitevus off the island. His allies scattered and his arm in a sling, Finitevus remarked that Knuckles was beyond saving, but that he could still be useful.(

Meanwhile, the Chaotix attempted to use a Warp Ring they had obtained to rescue the Guardians banished to the Twilight Zone by Finitevus, only to learn that the rings apparently were unable to breach the zone without Finitevus' power and expertise. Finitevus' work eventually benefited Thrash after the Tasmanian Devil infiltrated Finitevus' lair while the doctor was absent, as Thrash not only learned the location of Albion but also how to super-charge his Warp Ring using the Master Emerald.. After accomplishing the latter, the Tasmanian Devil proceeded to transport all Echidnas remaining on Mobius proper-with the exception of Dimitri,

  <p key="f63b8ecd-2ea5-43fc-8de6-9c6d967d6282">
   Finitevus is among the more audacious villains, having acquired his minions by rescuing them from the antagonism of some of his most dangerous possible opponents, such as Dr. Eggman. Finitevus varies in his involvement with other parties, only interfering in the schemes of others if his own are threatened. He also takes Dark Legion contempt of Angel Island Echidnas to the extreme, similar in fashion to the hatred of the Guardian Spectre towards members of the Legion, although it seems he actually despises both sides. Finitevus is a master manipulator, having managed to send away Locke from the Master Emerald, trick Dimitri into believing he wanted to help him and trick Lien-Da, not to mention a corrupted Remington, into believing the same. Indeed, his plans advanced in the background without any third parties being any the wiser.
  </p>
  <p key="02e80aa5-abe1-43b2-aeff-c4077a912f4d">
   Though originally he was fully dedicated to Albion's ideals, his transformation left him with a vehement hatred of Mobius' current state of society and an apparent wish to see the world demolished and rebuilt as he believes it should be. Unfortunately, for all his insanity he retains enough awareness of right and wrong and the world around him to recognize what his actions are bringing about, but simply doesn't care. According to him, the world must be "purged by fire", due to having developed an opposite view of Mobius to Knuckles. His reasons for recreating Enerjak are as follows: he feels that the Brotherhood and the Dark Legion have accomplished nothing in their generations of conflict, and that it is only fitting that Enerjak end the conflict since he was its progenitor.
  </p>
  <p key="c75aa9fe-0a00-4c26-ac87-0daec6be3ed7">
   He is well-spoken and intelligent, but has a strong temper, occasionally giving into rage. As he sees the world and its people as corrupt, he is unable to find any good in it; thus, when Julie-Su, Archimedes and Locke are all willing to sacrifice themselves to save Knuckles, he becomes enraged, not understanding why they'd give up their own lives; indeed, he set the hex that way thinking no one would willingly kill themselves for the sake of another. Such is his perception of others that selfless deeds become twisted into acts of stupidity in his mind, part of the reason he can't understand why anyone would do such a thing. He is unable to understand self-sacrifice; he only helps others to ultimately serve himself, often placing them in his debt so that they are forced to assist him in return.
  </p>
  <p key="fb2c04e5-e3a9-4be5-8408-7faf283de16d">
   It also seems that Finitevus was not honest with both his plans and his own allies, as Scourge was shown to be clueless about Finitevus' goals, even after a lengthy elaboration that culminated into a history lecture and only left Scourge even more bewildered. His favor towards complex methods is in opposition to Knuckles' preference for simple solutions to problems. He also gains little respect from those he judges as his minions, particularly Scourge, who refers to him as "Dr. Creepy Von Evil".
  </p>
  <p key="cc44ccab-2f05-401d-8088-6436cc574840">
   Finitevus also seems to be fascist, and/or sadistic at times. He talked to Thrash as if he was an animal with a cruel smile on his face saying things like, "Easy there, boy." "Heel." "Stay." Finitevus also mocked Knuckles on several occasions, and has taken a particular liking to tormenting him. Despite this, he seemed to genuinely want Knuckles' help, thinking to "save" him from his corrupted view of society. When Knuckles refused to give in to his offers of information that even the Brotherhood couldn't have offered, however, he was quick to try and eliminate him. From his taunts, he seems to possess a greater knowledge of Echidna history than Knuckles, and this awareness gives him a superior attitude towards other Mobians. However, he finds Knuckles a puzzling subject, given that the Guardian did not react to his offers in the way that he expected. Due to their completely opposite personalities, Knuckles also seems to set the doctor off even more than other heroic Mobians. (

   Dr. Finitevus was designed by artist Jon Gray. Prior to his transformation into his iconic appearance, Finitevus was depicted as a red echidna in an orange lab coat. After his transformation, his fur color changed to white; his eyes became yellow with black sclera. He typically wears a flowing, tattered black cape with a gold star-in-a-circle insignia on the back (in some appearance, on the front as well) with a heavy gold crescent-moon clasp. Fintevus also sports holders for his Warp Rings on the forearms and feet, essentially wearing them like heavy bangles or bracers. As a "photonegative" of Knuckles, he also bears a mark similar to that of the Guardians: a double black crest. However, in later appearances this is usually colored gold, worked into his attire or missing. His eyes are rimmed in red; his eyelids are likewise red (though sometimes miscolored white). He also bears small metallic plates on his cheeks as well as think black lines on his head and dreadlocks; these lead to a black-and-yellow diamond-shaped mark on his forehead. Finitevus has gray wraps covering his hands and feet; he also wears a belt with a round gold buckle and a pair of small pince-nez with round (usually purple) lenses. He briefly wore a cast on one arm.

  <p key="190e394d-81a3-41cc-b081-a1cf0c45256c">
   Early concept designs for Finitevus included a skull motif as well as a black bandanna on his head; at a time, the diamond-shaped mark was conceived as a hidden "third eye" kept concealed by the bandanna, though this concept was dropped.

    Dr. Eggman
   </a>
   . His skills include not only robotics and mechanical expertise, but also a level of magical ability. Due to the accident involving Chaos Knuckles and his Chaos Siphon suit, which resulted in his transformation into a "photonegative" of Chaos Knuckles, he commands a corrupted form of Chaos energy that is black instead of the usual green and has possibly combined it somehow with another type of power derived from science or magic. Whatever the nature of this corruption, Finitevus can duplicate any ability used by a wielder of pure Chaos energy, as demonstrated by his use of Chaos Control to teleport to the Chaos Chamber and to help Locke hold the Master Emerald. The nature of his powers also apparently thwarts certain detection methods, as demonstrated by the failure of Hunter's scanner to register Finitevus.
  </p>
  <p key="deb6d46d-048a-4270-8940-68947d77458e">
   He appears to have achieved incredible mastery of his powers, to the point where he can use the energies to create a brainwashing spell, like the one that persuaded Knuckles to become Enerjak, in order to render his victims docile and receptive to his commands. These powers were also put to use in a number of inventions, including the Warp Rings. Finitevus' powers also give him abilities similar to and rivaling that of a Guardian channeling the power of the Master Emerald. His abilities appear at least equal to Knuckles' own, given his performance in their battles, though other displays of his power seem to indicate that he might be even more adept than the current Guardian. The nearer he is to the Master Emerald, the greater his control, perhaps indicating that the decreased distance makes channeling its power easier.

  <p key="4499152e-5ef9-412b-b768-d44c96a57645">
   Unlike most members of the Dark Legion, Dr. Finitevus has no cybernetic alterations, but he does have some sort of holders for his Warp Rings on his arms and legs. It has been seen that he can control his Warp Rings from these holders with a thought and he seems to also be able to activate them while they are still in the holder to allow him to use his hands on objects at a distance. It also appears that Finitevus' powers interacting with the Warp Rings make them capable of performing feats that they are incapable of by themselves. An example of this is how he was able to use one to transport most of the Brotherhood and Moritori Rex to the Twilight Cage, while the Chaotix were unable to access that dimension with a stolen Warp Ring.
  </p>
  <p key="9f87b5cb-e099-492d-a7e7-982011181275">
   He also seems to have some skill in hand to hand combat, used in conjunction with his Warp Rings he can keep up with fighters such as Locke and Julie-Su, though he was also caught off guard by the skills of
   Barby Koala
   . Finitevus also gained much of Knuckles' fighting prowess from the event that transformed him, and is able to go toe-to-toe with Knuckles in battle. He also uses his Warp Rings to great advantage by teleporting his opponents' attacks away from him, causing them to hit their allies or dealing blows from unexpected angles through the rings. The fact that he seems to carry a virtually unlimited supply makes them an even more dangerous weapon in his hands.

   He also display some level of enhanced endurance in his wall-to-wall tangle with Knuckles, seeming to recover quickly with little actual damage and when he was thrown off the edge of Angel Island, he survived with only an injured arm, and that from being blasted by Julie-Su while still on the island.

    When penciller Jon Gray was first developing Finitevus's design, an early sketch had the diamond mark on his forehead replaced with a bandanna bearing a skull that covered a third eye in the middle of his forehead. While very interesting, this rendition was scrapped as Finitevus's character was described as already being creepy enough without becoming horrifying. The drawing was previously viewable on Jon Gray's personal website, but the site has since been closed.

This plot element was dropped at the last moment, and Finitevus' design was changed to no longer include the third eye. In this same interview, Gray also noted that Finitevus' power ring arm bands were not originally intended to be Warp Rings, but purely ornamental to Finitevus' design, and that Finitevus' association with Warp Ring technology was created after the fact and later incorporated into the character's theme by Ian Flynn.

Perhaps Sir Connery was unable to distinguish the corrupt form of chaos energy from the regular kind, or Finitevus' use of it was not particularly malevolent. It is also possible that Connery was unable to reach Finitevus while he was a member of the Dark Legion.
