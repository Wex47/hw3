Fleeing on foot to a new machine, Eggman challenged the group once more, but was bested by the combined efforts of Sonic and Knuckles, while Tails and Amy had to take a quick breather from the heat.

   swooped in to steal the five Ancient Gears that Tails had as well as kidnap Amy. Both Eggman and Metal Sonic then fled to Eggman's newest flying fortress. While devising a list of demands in exchange for Amy, Eggman was interrupted by Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, who had realized where Eggman and Metal Sonic could be hiding. After handing over their Ancient Gear in exchange for Amy thinking that Eggman didn't have the seventh one (since Eggman specifically asked for the "last" Ancient Gear from Sonic after stealing the five from Tails), the team realized that Metal Sonic had the last Ancient Gear inside of it. After the three defeated Metal Sonic and saved Amy, Eggman and Metal Sonic fled to Eggman's deep-sea base directly under the fortress, as the airship was only for supply shipments. (

Wily was left unnerved, but Eggman found himself wondering how Dr. Light knew so much about him and their plans. The two left Light in his cell and went to observe the ongoing battle, but Eggman later returned with Metal Sonic after Orbot picked up a signal coming from the cell. Discovering Light attempting to communicate with a device cobbled together from Motobug and Met parts, Eggman revealed that he had deduced that Light had been conspiring against them with Rouge. He then had Metal Sonic throw Dr. Light out of a nearby airlock towards certain death. (

   Overjoyed at the prospect of ruling their universes without opposition, Eggman and Wily briefly regained their old enthusiasm but then remembered their existing rift. It became worse when Sonic's attempts to convince Eggman to give up his course prompted Eggman to reveal that his and Wily's efforts in reshaping reality threatened the existence of both their worlds, angering Wily further. Eggman calmed him by assuring him that the Super Genesis Wave they would soon launch would repair all damage to reality. However, the pair were then attacked by Proto Man and Knuckles, forcing them to retreat to their machine. In attempting to defend themselves, each attempted to activate their personal defenses, only to discover that each doctor had sabotaged the other. Reluctantly cooperating in order to survive, they managed to repair the Egg-Wily Machine X and empower it with energy from the Chaos Emeralds. Sadistically informing Wily that he would kill him when it was all over and getting the same in kind, Eggman set his sights on the red heroes only to confront another menace: their freed nemeses transformed into

As the two heroes prepared to undo the Super Genesis Wave and its predecessor, Wily accepted the situation, but Eggman refused to and launched what remained of the Egg-Wily Machine X to attack Super Sonic. His efforts broke Super Sonic's concentration, and he also launched an attack right as Sonic unleashed the energy that would have restored their universe, causing it to mysteriously shatter. (

Before long, the trio finally made it back to Death Egg. Taking his seat on the bridge, Eggman asked his lackeys for a report, expecting good news. To his annoyance, however, he got bad news instead; in the new reality, the Knothole Freedom Fighters had never been decimated as before and had been busy undermining his plans as usual, most recently in the Metropolis Zone. Demanding more reports, the doctor learned that Sally Acorn had been aboard the Death Egg during his absence and fled just hours earlier. Eggman, hoping to kill the princess before Sonic could see her again, dispatched Metal Sonic to pursue her; however, the attempt ended in failure. (

   As the Death Egg was preparing for takeoff, Eggman finally revealed what he had discovered in Efrika: the power of the Super Genesis Wave had been too much for the fabric of reality to withstand. The entire multiverse had collapsed upon itself and promptly rebuilt itself as something completely different---their molecular structure had even been altered to accustom to the changes. Even worse, all of the residual Chaos energy left over from the Super Genesis Wave's collapse had been trapped within the world and was now trying to escape---a process that was going to destroy the entire planet. By then, the apocalypse was already too late to prevent: at that very moment, the surface of the world shattered into dozens of pieces---and Eggman, for all his genius, ultimately had no idea about how to rectify it.

Despite Orbot's positive note that the train arrived on time, Eggman shouted an order to give an inventory of what was lost. As Eggman opened boxes containing the research in the cart where the Professors were held, Orbot gives the final inventory report: while fuel and munitions remained intact, there was also a total loss of the Badnik Horde, all food spoiled, his two captives gone, and his customized foosball table destroyed. Unbeknownst to either of them, Cubot's mop, which he was using to clean up the dark energy that broke from the Freedom fighter's battle, had come to life and begun chasing him.

After learning as well of the massive amount of Dark Gaia energy around the planet, Eggman decided to keep the Chaos Emeralds and Gaia Temples secure to prevent the planet's restoration. He then began making plans to build a facility to concentrate and refine the Dark Gaia energy. When the Freedom Fighters made an attempt for the second Emerald located in

   The next Emerald was in the possession of Eggman's former minion Breezie, who had organized the Chaos Emerald Championship to decide who would claim the gem. Eggman contacted her and demanded that she turn over the Emerald to him. Breezie refused to do so, however, countering Eggman's threats of attack with the reminder of the strain put on his resources by the planetary crisis. She then reminded him that he would be fighting his own robots if he did attack her, and then noted that he would lose his best export if he cut off her supply. An offer to buy the Emerald off of her was rejected, as she noted that her tournament was a huge hit with Mobius' populace and a boon to her entire network. Much to Eggman's irritation, Breezie put him on hold while she checked on another matter, and then hung up on him in the midst of his tirade. Furious at her defiance, he contacted the Hooligans and ordered them to sabotage

Eggman was eventually able to freeze Sonic in place and attempted to impale him but unfortunately for him, Sonic had transformed into the werehog and stopped his attack. Sonic was able to overpower Eggman and the mad doctor was thrown out into the open with his

   . Eggman ordered Orbot to power up the Death Egg at the

   immediately but Orbot could not as Eggman Land was submitting very dangerous readings. Defeated, Eggman watched Super Sonic and Chip battle Perfect Dark Gaia while he lamented the loss of Eggman Land. He then began to hatch a plan that involved siphoning the raw power of the world to power up his Death Egg. Later on, Chip was able to restore the world and the irritated Eggman received a pat on the head from Cubot. (

   During his service to the Kingdom of Acorn, Eggman had a rather round torso and wore the same costume he had in the earlier Sonic the Hedgehog games - a red shirt/jacket with yellow triangles (which can be described as either a collar or part of a cape, which can be seen on his back), with black pants with connected boots, and mirrored pince-nez sunglasses.

   In the present day, Eggman remained obese but has become somewhat burlier, taller, and less flabby with long, almost disproportionately thin arms and legs. He now wears both tinted glasses and goggles as headwear, through his mustache retains its length, density, and mass. Gone are the cape and his suit-like clothes, in their place an elegant, red coat sporting two square metal buttons on both sides of the chest in gold with white stripes and yellow cuffs on the sleeves with white gloves covering his hands, and a pair of black pants with matching boots seemingly attached to them bearing circular plates on both sides of the ankles and three square ones riding up the shin.

He is a power-hungry tyrant who believes that his superior intellect makes him the rightful ruler of the world, a view that makes him incredibly arrogant and gives him a psychotic sense of self-entitlement that urges him to not just rule over the planet, but over the entire universe as well. Eggman is a strict man of science and technology, and has little care for the environment, magic, plant life, or other living creatures, preferring to have his territories be completely dominated by factories and machinery with no sign of natural elements.

   Humans
   or even divine beings against their will all for the sake of achieving his goals without caring about the harm he does to them or the world. His uncaring personality is mostly due to his over-inflated ego, as he only views himself and his machinery with utmost pride; the only other individual Eggman has ever admired is his grandfather Gerald Robotnik, whose life would play a major role in influencing Eggman's views. Eggman has no problem boasting about his superior intellect and mastery of science, often making long-winded proclamations about his superiority and looking down on anyone who would disagree. While Eggman's overly prideful views are the core parts of his personality, they are also his greatest weakness, as they cause him to become far too overconfident and arrogant when facing those who challenge his attempts at world domination and it usually leads to his downfall.

   Eggman's psychotic mentality makes him a very dangerous man, but it also seems to make him somewhat eccentric and he often acts like an immature and short-tempered blowhard, especially when things don't go his way. Nonetheless, he is still a cruel and conniving individual under the right circumstances, and when he has complete control over the situation, and his plans go accordingly he prefers to toy with his enemies rather than finish them off from the start, but this arrogance as mentioned before is what usually leads to his own downfall. Eggman has a peculiar fascination with the word "Egg", having given himself the name "Eggman" and giving many of his creations egg-themed names and appearances, such as the

   Despite the changes in the timeline Eggman hasn't lost all of his former personality from the Pre-Super Genesis Wave as he is still shown to enjoy toying with his enemies instead of just eliminating them from the start. He also still retains his former self's sadistic nature as well as once he saw that Sally was no longer Robotized he tried to have Metal Sonic kill her to mess with Sonic emotionally taking pleasure in the thought. When pushed to the limit Eggman is also willing to kill himself if it means his enemies go with him showing that he still retains part of his former self's insanity.

   Having an unfeasibly high intelligence quotient of 300 and exhibiting tremendous knowledge in all fields of science whether it be mathematics, mechanics, quantum physics, or even the computer science and programming, Dr. Eggman is a brilliant scientist and inventor whose mastery of technology knows no bounds, able to create machines that can cause mass destruction or harness the power of nature and the divine itself. His remarkable skills as an engineer and programmer are best evidenced by the armies of robots and mechs he's created for his numerous world domination attempts, some of which he has been able to build and program in only a matter of hours. He is an incredibly skilled pilot: able to manipulate many different kinds of his own mechs, robots, and vehicles in difficult battles with Sonic. His most well-known ability is his masterminded plots and schemes, however even when successful his plans usually meet with failure due to Sonic and his friends and Eggman's own arrogant overconfidence.

    In the Post-Super Genesis Wave timeline, it seems as though Robotnik has lost much of his former territory/spheres of influence. This is likely being done to reflect the games, where Dr. Eggman apparently controls little territory (he intends to do so, however). It is unknown if he will lose more territory, or if he will lose all of it, but he does not control 99.9% of the planet like in the Pre-SGW timeline.
