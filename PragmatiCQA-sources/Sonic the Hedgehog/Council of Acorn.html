The entire council went along with his decision with the exception of Rotor, who resigned as a member over the matter.

   would pursue the Death Egg and attempt to put an end to Eggman's threat. Despite Naugus' objections, the rest of the council voted to pass the motion, and the two teams were formed. The changes to the council brought additional tension as Naugus found himself at odds with the other members, particularly Rosemary Prower.

   The council assembled at Military HQ to ratify the new constitution, only to find the door locked and the lock broken. Unbeknownst to them, the difficulties were caused by
   Larry Lynx
   of the Secret Freedom Fighters, who used his "jinx" to upset the situation as his teammates engaged Ixis Naugus in a battle below the city. Getting inside, the council then discovered that the constitution document itself was missing, and recovered it only for the lights to go out. Apparently none the worse for wear, the council moved through with the process after Naugus made a false report of saving the city from a cave-in. Shortly thereafter, the council was joined by its newest member,
   Isabella Mongoose
   , whose first act as a councilor was a motion to overturn NICOLE's exile and allow her to return to the city. Naugus objected, but the council decided to discuss the issue after Isabella pointed out that NICOLE's services could have been extremely helpful in dealing with the recent attacks. Eventually, the group agreed to overturn the exile, on the condition that NICOLE would serve under "monitored conditions." The vote was unanimous thanks to Naugus, who acting through a possessed Geoffrey revealed to the council that their monarch was apparently dying, and requested NICOLE's help in healing him. Some members later attended the unveiling of the rebuilt Castle Acorn, only to be caught up in the effects of the second
