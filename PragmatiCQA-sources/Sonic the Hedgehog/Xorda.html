   They posses a collective awareness, enabling all to experience what all other members of their species do. Given how they never speak of themselves in first person, only saying "The Xorda" rather than "I" or "We" and their identical appearance, it's likely that their species has no individuals and they function as a singular person. This would go a long way in explaining their behavior, if their species functions as one being, then it would only be logical that they would see the actions of one person to be the crime of the entire species, lacking the concept of individuality.

   The Xorda from all appearances are vengeful in the extreme, for the wrongful death of one of their members they are willing to not only kill the person or persons responsible, but all of that species, and every living thing on the planet, and any living thing that might happen to evolve and share traces of the offender's species DNA eons later. To date the Xorda have shown no empathy for any species except their own.

   On Mobius'
   Southern Tundra
   , the Xorda revealed their final plan to eradicate the planet. A triangular device known as the
   Quantum Dial
   was set up with the purpose of tearing open a hole in reality, creating a black hole powerful enough to consume the planet and the entire solar system. It was assumed that such a large target would be easy to deal with, given that Station Square launched an immediate missile strike. However, the Quantum Dial possessed some kind of field that caused any construct within fifty feet to fall apart. Unwilling to give up without a fight, the various fighters of Mobius banded together, putting aside their differences to battle a common enemy. However, even with the amazing number of warriors aligned against them, the Xorda weapon was only vanquished after the timely resurrection of

   The Xorda departed Mobius soon after they launched the Quantum dial leaving the entire planet for dead. Their declaration of war on Mobius was also the reason that the Bem did not pursue a vessel (which headed on a course back to Mobius via a Bem jumpgate) they believed to contain

   . In truth, the vessel held Sonic, who had been beamed into space by the Quantum Dial's destruction. Unwittingly, the Xorda had inadvertently provided a safe journey home for their greatest hindrance. As the Bem pointed out that access to Mobius via their jumpgates was officially restricted on account of the Xorda having declared war on the planet - this would suggest the possibility that the Xorda are aware of their second failure to destroy all humanoid life on Mobius.
