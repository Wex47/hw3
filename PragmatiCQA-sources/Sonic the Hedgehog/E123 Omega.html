   , Omega was left somewhat dissatisfied by how easily the enemy had been dispatched, until learning that heavier resistance was expected as they made their way deeper into the comet. In the course of their journey, Omega was questioned by Shadow as to whether he had ever felt regret over rebelling against Eggman or destroying his robotic "brothers." Omega's reply was in the negative, and Shadow declined to explain the reason for his inquiry. After Shadow left the group to scout ahead, Omega was left with Rouge and Spider Troupe, who reacted with panic as the Black Arms' famous neurotoxin began filling the chamber they were in, threatening to paralyze the organic members of the unit. Fortunately, the organics had come prepared for the situation, and Omega as a robot was unaffected. The group made their way deeper into the comet, only to run into a troop of Black Arms led by

After the aliens departed with the Master Emerald, Fixit performed repairs on the badly damaged and weakened Omega, who then popped Rouge's dislocated shoulder back into place. Unable to pursue their enemies, the agents and archaeologists alerted Shadow and Knuckles to the situation. Eclipse's plans were thwarted and the Master Emerald shattered, but he managed to escape, prompting Team Dark to return to base. (

   Omega is best described as a "walking arsenal" due to being equipped with over three dozen forms of weaponry mainly concealed in his arms and upper body. His armory consists of rapid-fire machine guns, flamethrowers, lasers blasters, missile launchers, cannons and many more.
  </p>
  <p key="b77f039d-74f2-4a99-95fe-4252e0fd3e41">
   Although Omega is primarily build for weapons' usage, he has limited knowledge of hand-to-hand combat as seen when he went up against Eclipse's monster form in a fistfight. He also possesses considerable super strength even for a robot, enough to let him restrain even Shadow with brute force alone.
  </p>
  <p key="2286fbad-bed6-4584-b154-025dadd48414">
   Omega is equipped with heavy and remarkably strong armor that can withstand powerful blows from even the toughest opponents. However, he is not indestructible, as seen when he was left significantly damaged after his fight with Eclipse's monster form.
  </p>
  <p key="6ef9f7ee-dda7-45a0-8e92-2b46c6d994c3">
   Omega can use radio waves to talk with other Eggman robots and has sensors that allow him to detect energy signatures in various objects, areas, and beings, and even lets him analyze biological chances in other beings. Omega also has impressive speed and can jump fairly long distances others would have to fly. He can also utilize powerful rockets built into his back to help move his massive frame, allowing him to accelerate and hover long distances.

  </h2>
  <p key="15f59e10-b2d4-4ee2-88b4-389d0d0791c5">
   Unlike many of Eggman's other robots, Omega has free will. He is arrogant, full of pride and has an inflated ego, making him think his enemies and all other robots are inferior to him and will jump at any chance to prove his capabilities, no matter how powerful those beings are. He also has a keen sense of sarcasm at his disposal and a dry sense of humor, bordering on that of dry remarks.
  </p>
  <p key="30822b26-4631-433f-9f7e-45b98f7f66c7">
   Omega's goal in life is to take revenge on Eggman for keeping him shut down. However, his desire to protect his world is equaled, if not surpassed, by a love of destructive force. His pride in being a destructive war machine is a major part of him as he insisted he could still defeat Eclipse even through Eclipse beat him to the point where he could barely stand. Although his pride will make him do anything to prove how powerful he is, Omega will not let it get in the way of his current mission objective and won't stop until it is complete.
  </p>
  <p key="b538b1b2-c862-4e5d-aa57-235bbdc8b54e">
   Despite the fact that Omega will fight for the greater good, he still takes pleasure utilizing destructive methods and fighting with powerful opponents (even if they're his allies). He even gets giddy over the prospect of destroying something with excessive force and will shoot at just about anything if given the permission. He does not seem incapable of destroying someone, however, as he did consider taking out Shadow when he was under Black Death's control. Despite his violent exterior, Omega does have a soft side and is unwaveringly loyal towards his friends and allies.

The stripe running from his head to stomach has also been changed so that it is a seperate piece of metal altogether and not simply painted on like the others that noticeably sticks out, and he also has one extra finger, two hands with yellow wrists studded with large spikes like a dog collar and just below his stripe is a silver plate. He also lacks the twin dots between his eyes and the large light above his waist.
