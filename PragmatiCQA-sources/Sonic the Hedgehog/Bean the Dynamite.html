Bean met and welcomed her as she climbed aboard and proceeded to follow her below decks, where he filled her in on how he and Bark had ended up in her homeworld. He was still with Blaze when Captain Metal gave her an ultimatum via loudspeaker, threatening to destroy the Ocean Tornado and her friends with it. Blaze quickly asked Bean where the final Sol Emerald, which she and her friends had tracked to the pirate ship, was, to which Bean revealed that Captain Metal had it. He soon revealed his allegiance with the pirates, leading to a brief fight between him and Blaze. Growing impatient, Captain Metal gave Blaze three seconds to show herself before he opened fire on the Ocean Tornado. At Bean's suggestion, Blaze complied, though to his displeasure she singed his tail feathers in the process. Unfortunately, the captain reneged on his word and had his crew blast the Ocean Tornado into oblivion with a giant laser cannon. As Blaze collapsed in horror, Bean, despite enjoying the explosion, protested to the apparent destruction of her friends. As her sadness turned to rage, the deck superheated, causing Bean to burn his foot; however, she was knocked out by Buckle. As Bean examined her unconscious body, Captain Metal revealed his Sol Emerald, the sight of which made Bean very happy. (

   The pirates captured Blaze and took her to a remote island. As they made their way to the pirate base, Bean sat on top of Blaze's cage; at one point, this resulted in him getting zapped when Captain Metal had Swash electrocute Blaze to keep her in line. Seeing how upset she was, Bean tried to cheer her up by having Bark make her a smoothie, which she unenthusiastically accepted. Inside the pirates' base, Bean finally got so excited about Captain Metal's Sol Emerald that he and Bark eventually stole it. As Bark carried him off, Bean told the furious captain they'd take the "shiny" Emerald in place of service payment. The two fled, with Bean grasping the Emerald, screaming in delight. (

  <p key="1fb5ac99-430e-4d10-96e8-c387c5617b41">
   Bean is a rather goofy and eccentric being, prone to mood swings and extreme reactions. He seems to take little seriously and his logic is often dubious, though he's capable of moments of surprising clarity and intelligence. He tends to make irreverent, nonsensical or borderline inappropriate comments, often indifferent to any offense he may cause. His moods and reactions are extremely unpredictable; while generally an eager being, he's capable of being friendly and easy-going as easily as he can be indignant and angry. While he may be crazy, he's still potentially dangerous; he also seems to enjoy keeping his origins a mystery. It also seems that he feigns at least some of his apparent insanity in order to throw off his enemies, hiding a surprisingly devious side.
  </p>
  <p key="c15d760a-08ab-43ac-af35-5c80fecb8e62">
   Bean has a habit of assigning others complicated nicknames in lieu of their proper names, such as "Old Snaggleface McStealygrab" (Nack the Weasel) or "Baldy McNosehair" (Dr. Eggman). He has an obsession with shiny objects as well as a great love for bombs and explosions of all kinds. He and Bark are close friends despite their differences, though Bean occasionally annoys his Polar Bear partner. The pair of them also seem to have their noble side, and their bounty hunter career may simply be a case of being led down the wrong path.

   Bean primarily attacks with bombs.  It is unknown where he gets them from, but he seems to be able to produce them whenever needed, similar to the way Amy summons her hammer.  His explosives don't usually do much harm, though they are strong enough to knock people off their feet and create burns.  As seen during the fight with the Kraken, he seems to be able to summon bombs of different sizes; this, however, can backfire if the bomb is too big for him to lift.  Probably his most frightening ability is that he seems to have some measure of special control over all manner of explosives and can cause them to self-detonate on will alone. Pragmatic when it comes to combat, he's not above using his beak to peck at others.
