   Treble is mostly covered in purple armor, though his exposed face is white with red eyes and he sports a pair of ears that stick out from his large, cone-shaped helmet. His clawed feet are also white, while his legs are purple and connected to shoulders and hips that resemble black circles in gold frames. His body is composed of two ovoid components, linked by his "waist" and by a pair of cables that hook from one section to the other. He also has a tail that resembles one of these coils with a large cylinder on the end. Treble's legs each bear two gold fins, with their points facing upwards.
