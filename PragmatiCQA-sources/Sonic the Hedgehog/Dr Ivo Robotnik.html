   between the animal-like Mobians and humanoid Overlanders, Julian worked as a high-profile weapons engineer for the Overlander armies at the request of the Ministry of Conflict, brainstorming the most sophisticated military hardware in history, including his first robot programmed with artificial intelligence,
   King Gong

He was tried in court by the Minister of Justice, his own brother, and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. This experience also weakened Colin and Julian's already strained relationship. (

   and pledged to impart inside knowledge on the Overlanders to turn the tide of the war. In addition to the Royal Family, a titled "

   Kodos
   , who despite his hatred for Overlanders taught Julian everything about battlefield tactics. During a look over Ixis Naugus's former residence, Kodos tried to take Julian under his wing in a plot to overthrow King Maximillian, the Overlander Overlord and rule Mobius. Kodos planned to stage a coup and send his enemies to the

   . Julian was enamored by the idea of conquering the world, but decided he didn't want to share power. Instead, he used the Atomic Mace, a weapon Naugus created, to knock out Kodos and banished him to the Zone of Silence. Following Kodos' "disappearance", Julian assumed the mantle of Warlord. He would later be aided by his wayward nephew, Colin Kintobor Jr. AKA Snively Robotnik. (

   , Warlord Julian's schemes to take over the kingdom involved using an army of cyborgs. In order to experiment with the idea, Julian required suitable test subjects. Rather than use any of the Mobians within the main Kingdom, which may be noticed and thus reveal his schemes similar to what had happened with the Overlanders, Julian went to the neutral village of
   Kar Leung
   where he proceeded to capture the local inhabitants, including

   . Although he captured numerous villagers for test subjects, all of their bodies rejected the cybernetic implants and died, with the exception of Ken Khan. Julian, disappointed that only one specimen survived, nevertheless tested his cyborg on an attacking group of Overlanders. After Monkey Khan attacked them and single-handedly destroyed their tank, the Overlander troops retreated. Julian was impressed by Monkey Khan's success, but was forced to permanently confine him after Khan attempted to turn on him. (

   Following this, Julian discovered Sir Charles' brilliant device - the Roboticizer. Initially believing it to be a threat to his plans, Julian then realized it could be used to his advantage. With his plans for a cyborg army scrapped, Julian decided he could convert Mobians entirely to robotic slaves. After secretly sabotaging the device so that those roboticized would become mindless drones that obeyed only his commands, Jules Hedgehog became his first victim. (

   Sometime later, Julian arranged for both the
   Overlord
   and King Max to decide the outcome of the Great War over a sword duel. In reality, the duel was designed to make Julian's plans of global domination easier, with at least one of his enemies supposed to die in the fight. If the Overlord won, Julian planned on simply taking command of the Mobians and leading them into a never-ending war. If King Max won, the Overlord would be killed and the Overlanders would surrender, removing a major power and enabling Julian to take over the Kingdom of Acorn from within. When King Max won the fight but decided not to slay the Overlord, Julian at first believed his plans to be foiled. However, Sir Charles, still blaming himself for what happened to his brother and sister-in-law, turned over the

   Not long afterward, when Bernie discovered Jules being used as a pawn, Julian had the Robian throw her into the roboticizer as well. Julian explained to the already grieving Sir Charles that Bernie was roboticized in a lab accident while she tampered with the roboticizer. As a result of these losses, Sir Charles left the field of science to raise his nephew, while Julian's treachery went undetected. (

However, Snively had secretly altered the Annihilator's programming to only target Robotnik's DNA signature, which would allow Snively to take over unopposed. Instead of being "ultimately annihilated", Knothole was trapped in a strange time zone. At the same time, Bunnie Rabbot and Antoine D'Coolette planted an explosive in the Annihilator, and the explosion consumed Robotnik's entire command center. While Sonic and Knothole remained untouched, Robotnik was completely vaporized by his own weapon, ending both the

Robotnik tricked his old enemies in Knothole Village into thinking Eggman had resurrected him in order to steal his memories, and that he had escaped in hopes of forging an alliance with Sonic. King Acorn went along with the scheme, but it was revealed that the Freedom Fighters only granted him amnesty in an attempt to sabotage the device that had brought him back. Robotnik's return was cut short during a quarrel with Eggman his molecules dispersed. With the machine that brought him back destroyed, Robotnik's atoms remained dispersed forever. (

   Robotnik was a tall Overlander of imposing girth with a bald head (although in his data file, it claimed his head was shaven), a dark orange mustache, and black eyes with crimson irises. His usual attire was a sleeveless, red jumpsuit with yellow lines spanning up, down, and around his body, wide shoulder pads, a yellow cape, and gray boots. On multiple occasions in his career, he donned a militaristic uniform consisting of a red coat, smaller shoulder pads, and gray pants. It was in this outfit he confronted the

   and led his

    In the SatAm series, Robotnik was voiced by Jim Cummings, who also voiced his AoSTH counterpart in the pilot. His voice was done by the late Long John Baldry for the rest of the series. In later Sonic video games, he was voiced by the late Deem Bristow and currently by Mike Pollock. In the live-action movie, he is played by Jim Carrey.
