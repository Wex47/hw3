Mogul's rule over Mobius was short lived however, as his cruel leadership sparked rebellions and eventually he was overthrown by the other species of Mobians.

   Mogul then decided to learn about the secrets of the strange gem that had given him his power. Two hundred years after his dethroning, he focused his efforts on mastering the power of the Chaos Emeralds, and in the process became master over manipulating its energies. Armed with this knowledge, he made another bid for power, founding the
   Order of Ixis
   - an elite order of fellow mages trained in the dark arts he himself had discovered and developed. During this time Mogul also apparently crafted the
   Seven Ixis Masterworks

   Mogul resurfaced again in the modern age and began to lay plans for domination. One of his first objectives was the recruitment of new followers to serve as his elite vanguard. While journeying through the

   SWATbots
   and facing death, Mogul intervened, saving Simon with his powers. When Simon awoke, Mogul complimented him on his earlier display and offered him the opportunity to gain more power while in his service, to which the Gorilla agreed. Continuing in his travels, Mogul entered a bazarr one day, where
   Jet the Hawk
   attempted to sell a heavily overpriced artifact to him. Mogul agreed to pay Jet's price, but only if another member of

At the same time, he also placed a post-hypnotic mark on Mighty to be activated at a later time when Mogul would need it the most, and then let him go. Mogul continued to perform this act as he journeyed on, creating numerous unwitting telepathic bonds. (

This time, Mogul was challenged by an army of multi-dimensional Tails counterparts, but was not brought down until Tails merged with them to become the colossal

Very quickly, however, Naugus proved no match for Mogul. Naugus, noticing they used similar magic, questioned Mogul's past, who revealed to Naugus his role in the foundation of the Order of Ixis. In a terrible twist of fate for the heroes, Naugus acknowledged Mammoth Mogul's superiority and pledged himself to Mogul's teachings. This granted Mogul control of both the Sword and Crown of Acorns and Naugus' minions, the Arachne. (

With no other choice, Sonic gave in to Mogul's demands, bringing him a recently retrieved Chaos Emerald that Mogul then used to free himself and his minions.

With that, he and his minions vanished, teleporting away. (

   Mogul continued to keep himself involved as an entrepreneur over the next few months, until one dark and stormy day when Geoffrey St. John barged into his office, brandishing a purple Chaos Emerald. Unmoved but wary, Mogul plainly pointed out he was no longer involved with direct villainy and could not be swayed even with another Emerald, until Geoffrey explained he planned to restore Ixis Naugus with it. While Mogul was amused at the idea of losing Naugus as his pet and gaining a threat to his power, St. John pointed out he was too powerful to be challenged, but the idea of making Sonic miserable with Naugus' return was all Mogul needed to hear to let St. John have his way. Once Naugus' mind was restored, Mogul watched with amusement as Geoffrey revealed himself to be a sleeper agent apprenticed under Naugus and argued over his usefulness during the wizard's absence. As Naugus mentioned Mogul had much to answer for his treatment, he merely pointed out it would be at another time, and Naugus took his leave with St. John to prepare for Sonic. When Geoffrey mentioned how he shot the hedgehog in the back though, both Mogul and Naugus took great delight at the thought, and burst into a tremendous uproar of laughter. Master and apprentice soon departed, leaving Mogul to his rapidly growing fortune-already large due to centuries of accumulation-and his double life as a seemingly legitimate businessman and underworld power.

   's journal and claimed that he was the traitor. Mogul then told him that the consequences of abusing time travel were too great and that if he went back again he couldn't take the Time Stone with him and could only return after he found the traitor. Silver chose to leave, and after giving him instructions to read only after he foiled the traitor, Mogul sent him into the past with

   Thanks to the Chaos Emerald embedded in his chest, Mogul commands Chaos Energy. In order to achieve mastery of this force, he formed the
   Order of Ixis
   . As a result, he can also use
   Ixis Magicks
   on an even higher level than Ixis Naugus. For example, Mogul does not apparently require the willing submission of another being in order to cast spells of crystallization or possession on them as Naugus does. Thanks to these abilities, Mogul is capable of warping reality on a massive scale. Like

   , he is unable to age as a result to tapping into his Chaos Emerald making him immortal, or rather, ageless. The loss of his Chaos Emerald greatly reduced Mogul's strength, making him a far less dangerous opponent; as of recent events, Mogul's powers have been restored upon taking possession of the grey Chaos Emerald.

   Mammoth Mogul is also one of the few villains with his own super form. When charged with immense amounts of power, he can become
   Master Mogul
   . This has happened on various occasions, the first time being when he used the Sword of Acorns to drain the powers of Enerjak, thus giving himself the power of 12 Chaos Emeralds. During this time he displayed powers beyond the super forms of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, able to accomplish feats such telekinetically moving Angel Island. Later, Mammoth Mogul absorbed the power of Chaos Knuckles, and thanks to that was able to assume complete command of the Chaos Force. In his second appearance, Mogul had the power to crush entire universes with his bare hands.
  </p>
  <p key="f5df922a-ef3a-4701-aeba-dd1cadbc27d8">
   Being a mammoth, Mogul is also stronger than the average Mobian, which is only enhanced by his powers, though as he has never taken part in physical fight so exact level of strength is unknown. However, Mogul's most dangerous "muscle" is his brain; as a genius of caliber equal or greater to Dimitri and Doctor Eggman, Mammoth Mogul poses a threat to anyone he pits himself against. Mogul's mental prowess is demonstrated to deadly effect through his numerous mental abilities, such as telepathy or creating illusions (the latter of which he once used to trick the Chaotix and Freedom Fighters into attacking each other.) For a time, these powers were greatly diminished by the loss of his Chaos Emerald, to the point where he could no longer affect anyone but beings who had already been affected by those abilities, which are marked by a green diamond shape on their foreheads, though it is likely that he can now affect anyone with his psychic powers now that he has a new Emerald.

   Egotistical to a fault, Mogul sees himself as the end all of intelligence and power. While not obsessed with himself, he sees all other entities as lower forms of life, useful only as pawns in his schemes for power. Mogul also cares nothing for such pawns, and is perfectly willing to kill them to achieve what he wants. Combined with a total lack of care for any of his minions, this makes working for him unappealing, and only his sheer power and the benefits he offers hold the loyalty of those who serve him. He thinks himself infallible, and always refuses to believe that he can be defeated even when the odds are clearly against him. Even when imprisoned, he refuses to admit defeat, and is always ready with a taunt for his enemies. At the same time, Mogul is courteous and cultured-for a villain, anyway. Mogul's immortality has also given him a great degree of patience. Since time is one of the things he always has, he is not prone to brash decisions that could be carefully waited for a more opportune moment, or when things will turn more in his favor. He is also well known for being overly verbose, which Sonic has commented on many times.
  </p>
  <p key="036007b6-dd87-46c1-866f-02d7b062fd44">
   Despite his ego, Mogul is shown to on rare occasions be able to have respect for others, such as complimenting Tails when speaking to Amadeus.
  </p>
  <p key="82715d0e-4201-46d7-bcda-5a9ac05faa38">
   In Silver's future, seemingly reformed, Mogul no longer seems to boast his usual arrogance and megalomania, as he was humble, respectful yet strict towards Silver while conversing with him. His memories of the past-notably Sonic's time period-are apparently hazy, due to Silver's alterations to history and possibly his own advance age.

   Mammoth Mogul appears as a large, brown-furred Mammoth with dark green eyes, which previously appeared black. Mogul's attire has varied throughout his history, beginning with a fur toga during his early life. He subsequently adopted a hooded robe while operating as leader of the Order of Ixis, and was seen in other historical attire in flashbacks. When transformed into Master Mogul, his attire has consisted of a suit of armor with a cape: gold armor with red upon his first transformation, and all green in the second.
  </p>
  <p key="d0c07de0-5ad2-4598-a879-9183b71635cb">
   The modern Mogul consistently wears double-breasted suits that usually come in either white, gray, or purple. He has been seen with and without shirts underneath the suit coat, and typically wears black shoes. Unlike many Mobians, he doesn't typically wear gloves, but several of his fingers are adorned with rings. Mogul is also known to carry a cane, though it seems to serve as a weapon or accessory rather than as a means of supporting himself.
  </p>
  <p key="7e188988-656c-44ca-8cce-6bcb3199adb1">
   In Silver's future, for reasons unknown, Mogul has aged slightly in the intervening centuries and is now living in such feeble conditions like wearing ragged clothing.

    Mogul seems to be heavily derived from the Marvel Comics and DC villains, Kingpin and Lex Luthor respectfully: Both wear fancy, upper-class clothing, both have tremendous assets at their disposal, both consider themselves highly cultured, both are masterminds when it comes to planing an attack on their enemies, and, recently in Mogul's case, both take great efforts to make themselves untouchable by the law. His claim as a reformed legitimate business man is also similar to the DCAU version of the Penguin.

   <li key="98accf08-db8f-4fda-a13f-f42737ab67c4">
    His origin and history are also somewhat similar to that of DC villain Vandal Savage: both achieved "immortality" after coming in contact with a meteorite, both have played significant roles throughout history, and both are out to achieve world domination. His former power over an army of magic users makes him a counterpart to dark wizards like Lord Voldermort from the

    Given Dr. Eggman's capture of the gray Chaos Emerald in the altered realities created by
    Operation: Clean Sweep
    , it is likely that Mogul either doesn't exist in these realities or lost possession of his Emerald. Considering that a
