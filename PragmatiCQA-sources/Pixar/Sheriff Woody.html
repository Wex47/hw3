   After a play session with Andy, Woody, while still prone, overheard Andy and his mother's conversation that the birthday party had been moved to the current day. After expressing surprise after fully animating himself at the date change, he told the other toys that the coast was clear, causing them to animate as well. Slinky attempted to play checkers with him, though Woody refused, telling them he can't play because he's got bad news, although because Slinky yelled it out and Woody barely silenced him to avoid drawing too much attention, Woody decided to call an immediate staff meeting (with Woody also insisting that Slinky act happy when making the announcement). He then attempted to find the clipboard (with Rex being implied to have moved it at a discreet location in an attempt to lure Woody over to test his roar, with Woody being more annoyed than truly scared at the result). Bo Peep then offered to have someone else watch over the sheep a few blocks away.

   He holds a meeting informing them of an upcoming move to a new house, and the fact that, due to the move, Andy's birthday party is being held that day.

Woody then expressed irritation that the toys, in their effort of trying to fix the baby monitor (due to Rex unintentionally wrecking it trying to demand for Sarge to divulge the identity of the gift), were putting the batteries in wrong, eventually resulting in him having to personally put them back in. He then fixed it just in time to learn from Sarge that the birthday attendees and Andy are headed to his room quickly, causing Woody to tell the toys to return to their places before he gets in. After making sure all the toys are back in their proper spots, he then falls limp on the bed before being knocked out of the way to make room for Buzz. He then emerges from under the bed, and explains to the toys that he was knocked off there due to them having too much cake and ice cream, which he insists was a mistake on the kids part, although Mr. Potato Head implies that Woody might have been replaced by the new toy. Woody assures everyone that no one, let alone himself, was going to be replaced, and insists they give the new toy a "great big, Andy's Room welcome".

To make matters worse, Buzz is under the delusion that he is a real Space Ranger and needs to travel back to his own planet.

However, Mr. Potato Head is still suspicious of Woody murdering Buzz, and Woody tries to tell him that Buzz is in fact, alive, and with him. Much to Woody's dismay, Mr. Potato Head labels Woody as a "liar." In order to convince Mr. Potato Head that Buzz is with him, Woody commands Buzz to come with him, only to have Buzz throw his severed arm at him. Woody tries to convince the toys that Buzz is sound, but the toys start to become suspicious of what he's doing, and Woody accidentally blows his cover. This causes Mr. Potato Head to call Woody a "murdering dog," and he and Buzz are left stranded in Sid's house by the toys. In the film's turning point, after Sid straps Buzz to a firework rocket, planning to blow him up the next morning, Woody admits that Buzz is a "cool toy", telling him all the joys of being Andy's Toy, but despairs that he himself now stands no chance of being Andy's favorite; so he was afraid to come back, going as far to tell Buzz just to save himself and go on without him, afraid Andy and his toys wouldn't love him anymore, not knowing that he reinvigorated Buzz's confidence, helping Woody escape a crate that Sid trapped him underneath.

However, Lenny sees Woody and Buzz on RC, and warns all of the toys. Bo Peep gets a better look at them. This finally convinces the toys that Woody didn't harm Buzz and that Woody was telling the truth. This makes the toys feel guilty for what they did to Woody, and they decide to help Woody and Buzz back onto the van by having Slinky stretch his body. This works until RC's batteries suddenly deplete. This causes Slinky to get slung back onto the van.

   Woody realizes that he can ignite Buzz's rocket. He then attempted to light the match (even thanking Sid for "providing" it to him earlier), although a passing car extinguished the match before it had a chance to light the wick, causing Woody to break down in despair until noticing that Buzz's helmet is directing sunlight and causing his hand to slightly burn, causing him to get the idea to use Buzz's helmet as well as his hand to light the rocket, successfully doing so. However, just before the rocket ignites, Woody then realizes that he may have just endangered himself, Buzz, and the others by lighting the rocket, since rockets explode once lit. As they catch up, we see the toys again, this time feeling awful over their loss of Woody and Buzz. However, Lenny excitedly tells the other toys that Woody and Buzz are catching up, making them just as excited to have them back. Woody manages to toss RC into the moving truck just as he and Buzz go soaring into the air. Buzz manages to detach from the rocket by means of his wings, which slice the duct tape, and glide through the air until they pass the moving truck and land safely inside Andy's car. At the end of the film, which takes place at Christmas, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. As Woody wonders what gift may be worse than Buzz, Andy receives a

   . Woody tries desperately to convince the toys to go back home, but his friends believe that daycare is perfect for them and convinces Woody in joining them to be played with by the children of the daycare. Woody is disappointed to hear that Buzz is staying at the daycare with the others as well. Woody believes that his friends shouldn't turn their back on Andy so quickly and calls them selfish for deciding to move on with their new life at the daycare and without Andy. Woody decides to go back to Andy alone, and Buzz steps forward to shake hands with Woody as a symbol of saying goodbye, but Woody turns away and heads out the door, still frustrated. As he sneaks across the hallway, trying to find his way out, a janitor cart comes his way, and Woody grabs the bottom of the cart, but the cart goes into a bathroom. Woody then sneaks into one of the stalls, climbs up the toilet, jumps to the top of the stall, and slips out of the open window.

Just as he makes a perfect landing, a sudden updraft yanks him high into the air. Woody panics and wraps himself around the kite's bar, but the bar snaps and Woody plummets to the ground. He then crashes into the tree, hitting branches on his way down, then he falls from the tree, but he stops inches above the pavement due to his pull-string caught in a branch.

Although he enjoys playtime with Bonnie and her toys, he still wants to go home to Andy so Bonnie's toys start up the computer for Woody to find the direction from Bonnie's house to Andy's, which to his joy, turns out to be right around the corner. As he tells Bonnie's toys that if they get donated to Sunnyside that they tell Andy's other toys that he made it home, Bonnie's toys become surprised to see that he has come from the daycare and want to know how he escaped. When Woody asks them what they meant, Mr. Pricklepants tells Woody that Sunnyside, ruled by Lotso, is a place of ruin and despair. Woody then asks why, and Bonnie's toys direct him to

Lotso, Chuckles and Big Baby eventually made their way back to Daisy, only to find that Daisy had replaced Lotso with another toy bear, turning the pink bear bitter and ruthless. They found Sunnyside, and Lotso and Big Baby rose to power quickly, turning the daycare into a toy prison, while Chuckles had been taken home by Bonnie. Chuckles gives Woody Big Baby's old pendant as he finishes his story. Woody then realizes he has to go back to Sunnyside to save his imprisoned friends, despite objections from Bonnie's toys, who believe returning there will be sacrificial and suicidal.

After Woody calls to his friends once the toddlers leave the Caterpillar Room, the toys become overjoyed to see him, then they apologize for not listening to him. Woody, in return, apologizes for leaving them and asserts that they will stick together. He then formulates an elaborate plan on helping the toys escape. Upon learning that Lotso has reset Buzz into thinking he is a Space Ranger once again, Woody decides to get Buzz back on their side as part of his escape plan.

Slinky lowers Woody, who is holding a bag to place over the Monkey's head, but the Monkey notices them and starts screeching, startling Woody and Slinky, who slip from the ceiling and fall to the Monkey. The Monkey then runs toward the door to alert Lotso's guards, but Woody uses a wire to trip the Monkey. He then fights the Monkey, who seems to overpower him as he repeatedly bangs his cymbals on Woody's head. Woody then yells to Slinky to grab the tape, and they manage to tape up the monkey and lock him in a filing cabinet. After finding the key, Woody tells Slinky to fire it under the door, across the hall, and into the Caterpillar Room. Later, Woody and Slinky are joined by

As Woody, Bullseye, and the Aliens negotiate the playground in which Big Baby is sitting on a swing, they accidentally attract Big Baby's attention, but they dive under the bucket, safe from Big Baby's eyesight. After rejoining with Jessie and the others, they finally make it to the garbage chute, where Buzz does an acrobatic stunt to get the lid open, then the toys climb into the chute. Woody goes first to see that the chute is leading to an open dumpster, then he signals to his friends to come down, but not all at once. The toys, however, thinks Woody has told them to come down all at once and they do, colliding with Woody, who almost falls into the dumpster, but Jessie pulls him up. Just as Woody and the toys are about to leap to freedom with help from Slinky, Lotso and his gang corner them. Seeing Woody among the toys, Lotso tells the toys that Andy doesn't want them anymore, to which Woody responds by labeling Lotso's remarks as a lie, but Lotso asks Woody why Andy is leaving if he loves Woody so much. He labels Woody as a piece of plastic made to be thrown away and coaxes the toys to go back to the Caterpillar Room to avoid the approaching garbage truck and join Lotso's family again. Ken, having switched sides because he truly loved Barbie, stands up to Lotso as the Pink Bear tells the toys that Andy is the one who has thrown them away and that not one kid will ever love a toy, Woody brings up the subject of Daisy to try to remind Lotso about his previous owner, but Lotso doesn't want anything to do with Daisy. It's during this heated argument between Woody and Lotso that Lotso's cohorts become increasing aware of their leader's evil nature. As Woody argues with Lotso, he shows Big Baby's old pendant to Lotso and Big Baby, and the latter notices his old possession, causing him to remember Daisy. Woody then tosses the pendant to Big Baby, who picks it up to take a look at the token of his lost love and sniffles, "Mama." This makes Lotso snap as he snatches away the pendant and destroy it, and pokes Big Baby hard with his cane for still loving Daisy. Big Baby then picks up Lotso, throws him into the dumpster, and closes the lid, making a bridge available for Woody and his friends to escape. Unfortunately, one of the

Lotso, having caught a glimpse of Woody through the opening, grabs Woody and pull him into the dumpster as a way to get revenge for being foiled and humiliated just as a garbage truck arrives. Woody's friends jump onto the dumpster, only for them to end up inside the garbage truck as well. During the ride, Buzz is crushed by a TV, resetting him to his normal self and causing him to regain his memory, such as recognizing Woody (Woody tells Buzz that he has gone "

   , the Aliens spot the claw and run for it, and Woody yells at them to come back, but is cut off by a bulldozer that plows the Aliens away. Just then, another plow pushes Woody and the other toys into a trench, and they fall onto a long conveyor belt of garbage leading them into a dark tunnel. Seeing a set of shredders looming ahead, they grab onto a metal object so that they hang from a magnetic ceiling, safe from the shredders. Just then, Lotso, who is stuck underneath a golf bag, calls for help, and Woody, not having the heart to leave Lotso to die, drops down to rescue Lotso, risking his life in the process, but the golf bag, with some golf clubs inside, is too heavy for him to lift up. Seeing the danger Woody has placed himself in, Buzz drops down to assist Woody in freeing Lotso. They utilize one of the golf clubs to pry up the bag, letting the bear crawl out, and Woody makes Lotso take his hand as the golf club he and Buzz are holding on pulls the three up to the ceiling, seconds before the golf bag is pulverized. Woody calls to his friends to remind them that they are all still together, but they're not hanging from the ceiling. Hearing Jessie call out from the conveyor belt below, Woody, Buzz, and Lotso drop from the ceiling to catch up with the group. Seeing a glow up ahead, Rex then tells Woody that the toys will be fine, thinking the glow's daylight, but Woody sees that the "daylight" is a glow from an incinerator that the conveyor belt is pushing him and his friends toward. Woody and the toys run for it, desperate to escape their doom, but the conveyor belt keeps pushing them toward the furnace. Lotso then notices an emergency stop button, runs over to grab the lower rung of a ladder leading to the button, and calls to Woody to help him climb up the ladder. Woody and Buzz rush over to help Lotso, who climbs up the ladder and reaches the button. Woody shouts at Lotso to push the button, but Lotso gives him and the toys a menacing glare, throws an insult at Woody: "Where's your kid now, Sheriff?" and runs off, leaving the toys to die in the incinerator. The toys then tumble into the furnace, where tons of shredded garbage are cascading down an enormous bowl toward the flames. They try to climb away, but realize that they've been deprived of any escape chance and take hands as they accept oblivion as family. As Woody continues to climb his way out of the furnace, he turns to see that Buzz has accepted death as fate, having taken Jessie's hand with his left arm. He reaches out his right one for Woody's, and Woody, coming to realize that this is the unfortunate end for him and his friends, takes Buzz's hand with his left arm and Slinky's paw with his right one. Just as the toys prepare for their fiery death, a light shines on Woody's face, and Woody looks up to see a giant claw crane suddenly appear from above, drop down onto the toys, and scoops them up. As Woody and his friends ride in the air, they turn to notice the Aliens in the driver's cab, where they have taken control of the claw to rescue the toys. Woody heaves a sigh of relief, grateful that he and his friends are all safe and sound, as the claw carries them out of the furnace and places them gently on the ground. Hamm and Slinky express their desire to get back at Lotso for having them almost killed, but Woody convinces them to forget it as he believes that Lotso isn't worth it, but at the same time, he and his friends have other important things to worry about, such as the fact that they are still alive and need to go home before Andy leaves for college. They hitch a ride in Sid's garbage truck while Lotso is found by a

   After the toys return home, they clean themselves of dirt and grime that has made its way onto them during their escape and their return home through the garbage dump. After climbing back up to Andy's room, Woody heads for a box bound for college while the others climb into a box bound for attic, but Woody pauses for a moment to shake hands with Buzz, unable to admit that the two best friends are now separating ways after all they have been through. The other toys say their farewell words to Woody, and Jessie tells Woody that she still knows about Buzz's Spanish mode, which briefly makes Buzz suspicious. After Buzz bids him farewell and climbs into the attic box, Woody climbs into the college box and takes a possibly last look at his friends as they close the attic box. He then watches through a hole in the college box as Andy's mother makes her emotional farewell as she lets go of Andy so he can move on with his new life. Woody, who has struggled to accept that his role in Andy's life as his toy was coming to an end throughout the movie, finally realizes that he too must let go of Andy and move on with his own existence as a toy. While Andy turns away to say goodbye to Molly and Buster, he quickly jumps out of the college box, grabs a sharpie and a post-it note, rushes over and climbs onto to the attic box, and writes a message to Andy for him to donate the toys. Seeing that there is no time to make it back to the college box, Woody, unnoticed, stows away in the other box. When Andy reads the note, he decides to donate the toys, so he stops at

   while moving out to college and hands the toys to Bonnie, but when Bonnie looks inside the box for more, she surprisingly finds her "cowboy dolly", making Andy confused about how Woody has gotten into the box. Bonnie wants to have Woody, but Andy is reluctant to give away his favorite toy, which gives her a disappointed look on her face. Andy then realizes how much Bonnie loves Woody, just like he has done during his childhood, and in one last symbolic gesture, he finally gives Woody to Bonnie, telling her that they've been through a lot together and he means a lot to him, so she has got to take good care of him.

After Bonnie is taken inside her house by her mother for lunch, Woody and his friends sit up to watch Andy's car disappear down the road. Woody says his farewell to Andy, knowing that he will really miss his good old days as Andy's toy: "So long, partner." He is immediately comforted by Buzz as the two accept that their life with Andy is now complete (still Woody will always love Andy very, very much, no matter what), and then Woody introduces Buzz to Bonnie's toys.

Much to Woody's surprise, Forky throws himself in a nearby trash can, and because Woody knows how important Forky is to Bonnie, he takes it upon himself to restrain the deranged toy from constantly throwing himself away. After a montage of struggling to stop Forky from trashing himself, Woody finds himself in the RV the Andersons had rented for their road trip. Talking with

   Alarmed, Woody goes out the window after Forky, eventually finding him trying to shove himself into the ground. Pulling him out, Woody walks with/drags Forky with him, impressing on Forky the importance of being there for "Andy", before correcting himself to "Bonnie". Catching his words, Forky asks who "Andy" is, and the two of them get into an agreeable conversation about Woody's time with Andy. Asking Forky why he's obsessed with trash, and learning that Forky is reassured by it, Woody uses that to show Forky that

Insulted by his words, the toys depart and Buzz himself also leaves on the advice of his "inner voice" audio sounds. Undaunted, Woody heads back into the antique store alone, where he is quickly surrounded by Gabby Gabby and four Bensons. Approaching him slowly, Gabby Gabby soothingly appeals to Woody's camaraderie as a fellow toy just trying to make children happy, relating to his past joys, and asking that she only have the chance to experience even a small bit of what he had. Moved, Woody willingly agrees to give Gabby Gabby his voice box in exchange for Forky's freedom.

   When Woody first met Buzz, he considered him a rival. Prior to Buzz's arrival, Woody was Andy's favorite toy- being the hero in all of Andy's imaginary scenarios with the other toys. However, on Andy's 7th birthday, he is given a Buzz Lightyear doll- much to the horror of the other toys (as new toys mean old ones get replaced). 
Woody, leader of the toys, was the first to approach Buzz (who wasn't aware he was a toy, but a real space ranger). Woody disliked how all the other toys were quickly impressed by Buzz, feeling his leader role being threatened. Woody slowly started to see Andy favor Buzz over him, as his room became decorated in Buzz apparel and Woody's hero role in play were played instead by Buzz. All this time, however, Buzz respected Woody as the "sheriff" and leader of the toys, oblivious to Woody's dislike for him. Over the course of the first movie, Buzz and Woody slowly build a friendship and help each other out of their crisis- Woody feeling inferior to Buzz because of all the admiration Buzz gets, and Buzz having an identity crisis learning he is a toy. By the end, the two have reconciled and become best friends, with Buzz being Woody's second in command.

   In the second movie, roughly 6 months after the first film, Buzz leads a rescue party to find Woody, who has been stolen by a greedy collector/toy shop owner named Al. Buzz tells the team that they can't give up on Woody, after all he had done for them and Woody didn't give up even after what the toys did to him in the first movie (such as throw him out of a moving van). Upon finding Woody, Buzz is disappointed to learn Woody plans to go to Japan with the rest of the Roundup gang, as Woody fears Andy will soon outgrow him-and this way, he will be adored by children for years and the gang won't have to be put back in storage, as the museum was only interested in the set if Woody was part of it. Buzz tells Woody that he once didn't feel what it was like to be loved by a child, only for a toy (Woody) to teach him that feeling, and he traveled across town to find him, feeling like his journey meant nothing to Woody, saying that being adored behind glass rather than be played with is no life and departs with the others. Woody gets a change of heart and attempts to leave with Buzz and the others, convincing Jessie and Bullseye to come with him, only to be stopped by Stinky Pete, who demands that they all go to Japan, having a hatred for space toys and owned toys alike, after he was never bought in stores by a child, and instead had to watch as every other toy was sold. The other toys pursue Al when he collects the Round Up Gang to take to the airport. Once there, Buzz follows the suitcase, opening it up to get Woody out. Instead he finds Pete, who knocks him out, with Woody coming to his defense. Before Pete can dismember Woody, Buzz and the others use the flash from a camera they found in a simiar bag to stop Pete. When Woody goes to save Jessie, Buzz and Bullseye follow alongside the plane as the four reunite, celebrating their adventure. Woody and Buzz's friendship is rekindled at the end.

   In the third movie, Woody and Buzz still have a strong friendship with each other, and co leadership to the rest of Andy's toys, despite the fact that Andy is now 17 years old. Though they express uncertainty over what will happen, they vow their friendship for infinity and beyond. Later, their relationship becomes dampened when Woody tries unsuccessfully to convince the other toys to go back to Andy's. When Buzz offers a parting handshake, a frustrated Woody refuses and leaves. After escaping Sunnyside and Buzz returns to his regular persona, Woody is delighted, telling Buzz he went "beyond infinity". While they're at the landfill, Buzz helps Woody rescue Lotso from being shredded. As they inch closer to a fiery fate at the incinerator, Woody and Buzz grab hands, knowing they'll die together, until the Aliens manage to save them with a claw.

   In the fourth movie, Buzz provides moral support for Woody when he has to watch over Forky, with Buzz even offering to do it for him. They also tell each other to listen to their "inner voice" over what they should do. After Buzz assures that Bonnie will be fine without him, Woody decides to stay with Bo Peep and live out a new life of helping other toys find owners. They share a hug before parting ways, knowing their friendship is "to infinity and beyond."

   Woody's relationship with Bo Peep was strong over the four movies. In the first film, Bo Peep and Woody were implied to be dating or at least interested in each other, with Bo Peep flirting after Woody "saved" her sheep during Andy's play scenario. When Buzz is introduced to the toys, Bo Peep tells Woody not to be jealous, as Buzz is an impressive toy, trying to convince Woody that he's still Andy's favorite. After Woody accidentally knocks Buzz from the window, Bo Peep tries to stop the other toys from a revolt against Woody, showing that she does care for him. When Buzz and Woody are found by Sid, she wishes that Woody could be there with her to see how much Andy misses Woody. She is among the toys that Woody talks to from Sid's window, but is horrified when Woody accidentally shows them Buzz's severed arm (from when Buzz tried to fly and fell from the second floor). She departs with the other toys, losing her belief in Woody. Near the end, she assists the other toys in trying to get Woody and Buzz back into the van, instructing another toy to activate the van's ramp. Eventually the pair are reunited and that Christmas in the new house, she covers Woody's face in kisses under the mistletoe (planted by her sheep).

   The second film Bo Peep has a smaller role, but her relationship with Woody is the same. When Woody falls into a depression after being shelved due to his arm being ripped, she calls out to him to see if he's okay, exchanging a worried look with Buzz when Woody isolates himself. When the yard sale arrives, she and the other toys watch as Woody rescues Wheezy the Penguin, then watches as Buzz attempts to rescue Woody from Al, wondering why someone would want to steal him, and visibly upset that he's gone. When Buzz organizes a rescue mission to find his friend, Bo Peep gives him a kiss on the head, telling him to give that to Woody when he's found.

   Bo is absent from the third film, but Woody remains in love with her, going quiet when Rex mentions Bo as one of the toys they lost as Andy grew up. As seen in the fourth film's prologue, Woody was tempted to join Bo as she was given away, but was forced to stay behind as he heard Andy looking for him.

   In the fourth film the pair are reunited, happy to see one another again, as their feelings never went away. Woody tries to convince her to come with him so Bonnie can take her in, but she refuses, trying to get Woody to instead stay with her in the fairgrounds. By the end, Woody decides to stay with Bo, feeling he belonged more with her and the other fair toys to help other toys in need than go with the others to Bonnie, who started to lose interest in him.

   Woody and Jessie have a very sibling-like relationship. In the second film, Jessie is overjoyed to meet Woody, as he is her ticket out of storage. Learning he has an owner, she falls into an anxiety attack, angry Woody would come all this way to get her hopes up, only to try and leave again. She at first doesn't have a lot of respect for Woody, and he doesn't show much to her, leading the two to fight a lot. Angered when Woody is fixed up and still plans to get back to Andy, she goes off by herself. Woody decides to approach her and the two have a moment, as Jessie reveals she was once owned by a girl named Emily, who adored her as much as Andy adores Woody. However, Emily started to grow up, and Jessie was forgotten. When she goes to find something that rolled under the bed, Emily picks up Jessie, putting her in a box with her other cowgirl related things. Jessie is once again happy to be with Emily, but learns she is being donated and watches as Emily drives off. Woody realizes Jessie is traumatized from her past, and decides to stay with the group to be donated to Japan, realizing that he could eventually share the same fate with Andy. 
The two form a friendship as they watch all of the old Woody's Roundup videos. The two, along with Bullseye, start to play pretend and end up in a tickle fight as Buzz and the others barge in to save Woody. Woody is firm that he's staying with the Gang, only to change his mind after a pep talk from Buzz, convincing Jessie to come with him. Jessie shows uncertainty, but Woody encourages her by asking if she wants that feeling of being loved by a kid again. The two are stopped by Pete, who reveals he framed Jessie the other night for turning the TV on as Woody tried to get his arm back from Al and escape. The two eventually are in the airport as Jessie is unable to get free from the suitcase and packed into the plane. Woody goes to rescue her as he once again tries to convince her to go with him. Jessie fears Andy won't like her, with Woody reassuring her. Once he mentions Molly, Andy's little sister, Jessie is overjoyed and decides to go with him. As they try to leave the plane, Woody slips from the rail, Jessie holding onto him by his ripped arm. Woody tells her to let go of the plane and she'll just have to trust him as the swing to Buzz and Bullseye.

   In the third film, Jessie and Woody's relationship gets rocky as she is among the toys to be in storage (although they later are accidentally thrown out, then stowed away in the box to Sunnyside), Jessie's trauma comes back, fearing that it's Emily all over again. She is among the toys that are jealous that Woody is being taken to college with Andy, unconvinced when Woody tries to tell them they weren't meant to be thrown out, later angry when Woody leaves Sunnyside without them. However, their friendship is rekindled when Woody comes back to Sunnyside to break them all out, as the toys now know Lotso is a dictator who forces the new toys to be abused by the rowdy kids, while he and the other higher-ranked toys get loved and gently played with by the older kids.

They later have an emotional goodbye when Woody decides to join Bo Peep, with Woody handing his badge and leadership role to Jessie.￼

Even though his owner is now grown, the loyal sheriff Woody maintains a steadfast belief that Andy still cares about his toys. As the toys venture into their unknown future, Woody remains the voice of reason. As their dependable leader, he ensures that no toy gets left behind.
