   Located in the middle of a riverbed, Ant Island is somewhat protected from outside threats, except for flying ones. The riverbed floods every autumn, but during the summer, it is quite dry. There is a tree in the middle of the island, and right at its base is the anthill. There is seemingly enough food for both the ants and
   grasshoppers
   ; however, when
   Flik
   accidentally destroys the seasonal offering for the grasshoppers, their leader
   Hopper
   demands twice the amount of food, and it is revealed that there is not enough for them and the ants.

  <p key="19c5b235-0e22-4e5f-ad8f-87b280295a83">
   After Flik is banished from the island for deceiving the colony, when
   P.T. Flea
   came looking for
   his troupe
   and blew Flik's cover in doing so, the grasshoppers take over the island and hold the colony hostage. Flik later decides to return after
   Dot
   (who had just learned to fly) shows up and informs Flik that Hopper and his gang are eating all the food on the island and plan to kill
   the Queen
   when they are finished. Flik and the circus bugs then hijack P.T. Flea's
   circus wagon
   and head back to the island.

   Upon arriving, Flik, Dot and
   the Blueberries
   use a fake bird to scare Hopper and his gang, but it is
   set on fire
   by P.T. Flea who mistook it for a real bird and accidentally aided Hopper in the process. Hopper then has
   Thumper
   beat Flik up after he reveals that he was the one who came up with the hoax. However, the colony rebels against Hopper, but it soon starts to rain. Hopper kidnaps Flik and attempts to fly away with him, but he is rescued by
   Atta
   and they lure Hopper into the
   real bird
   . Hopper mistakes it for a fake bird and taunts it, causing her to shriek angrily at him. Hopper realizes it is a real bird after all and she feeds him to her
   chicks
   , thereby putting Hopper's reign of terror and insult on the ant colony to an end, and the ants get their island back.

   With the
   Circus Bugs
   agreeing to help the ants, they all begin work on a fake bird which should scare away
   Hopper
   and his gang for good. However,
   P.T. Flea
   arrives on the island and reveals that the new bugs are just circus bugs and not trained warriors. Distraught,
   Princess Atta
   banishes them along with Flik to go back to where they came from.

   Flik and Dot enter Dot's hideout and regroup with the scout ants. Meanwhile, the Circus Bugs entertain the grasshoppers, and put on a show. They lie that they were invited by Princess Atta as a surprise for the grasshoppers' arrival. At first, Hopper orders them to be squished. But after seeing
   Tuck and Roll
   's act, he decides that he may enjoy the entertainment. While the grasshoppers are distracted, Flik and the young scouts climb up the rocks behind the enemy and enter the fake bird they had made earlier.

   During the circus acts,
   Manny
   asks for someone to join him as an assistant so he can make them disappear. With Hopper's permission, Manny takes the Queen on "stage" with him. In actual fact, the Queen has escaped under the wings of Dim. When Manny lifts the box and the grasshoppers see that the Queen has disappeared, they accept it as part of the magic act.
   Gypsy
   flaps her wings and bows with Manny as the crowd cheer her, but it is really a signal for Flik to fly down with the fake bird. Hopper soon grows irritable when Manny fails to bring the Queen back, and the grasshoppers close in on the Circus Bugs. However, they all look up in horror as the fake bird (unknown to them, driven by Flik) swarms over them.

   Taking their chance, the hostage ants run. Seeing the bird, most of the grasshoppers retreat and leave the island. The bird accidentally knocks over the circus wagon, and P.T. manages to escape. Seeing the bird, he too believes it to be real. Thinking he is being a hero, he grabs a match and sets the bird alight. Seeing it burn, Hopper realizes it is a fake while Flik and the girl scouts, inside, escape the fire. Hopper, now furious

   Thumper
   . Despite his beatings, Flik stands up and points out it's not the ants who need the grasshoppers, it's the grasshoppers who need the ants. Realizing he is right, the ants link arms and know they can outnumber Hopper's gang. Thumper,
   Molt
   and the remaining grasshoppers flee.

   The ants grab Hopper, and plunge him into the circus cannon. Just as they are ready to fire him as far away from Ant Island as possible, it begins to rain. The rain knocks over the cannon, and Hopper escapes. He then kidnaps Flik and flies off with him.

Princess Atta flies past, and snatches Flik away from Hopper. Flik and Atta lead the furious grasshopper to the real bird's nest, where the ants hide. The
   real bird
   suddenly appears, but Hopper thinks it is another one of the ant's tricks. To his horror, the bird picks him up and drops him into a nest of three hungry
   chicks
