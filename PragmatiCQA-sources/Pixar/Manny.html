   Manny is a praying mantis with an English accent and the magician of
   P.T. Flea
   's
   circus troupe
   . He is very kind and courteous to his fellow circus troupe and other insects, especially the ants on
   <a href="Ant Island.html" key="ff21b247-834c-48e8-abba-6dcca3bde938" title="Ant Island">
    Ant Island
   </a>
   . He is also
   Gypsy
   's husband.
  </p>
  <p key="a3bbc6fe-94cc-4889-a6ad-2c51d0181f68">
   His act involves the "Chinese Cabinet of Metamorphosis," which is really the packaging of a
   Chinese Takeout
   . His magic act is not appreciated well by the
   flies
   in the usual audience, who insult him and throw berries at him, but the
   grasshoppers
   take it seriously, as he somehow improved. Manny is aggressive towards
   Flik
   at the beginning of the film, but grows to like him and in the end, convinces him to go back to the colony and help save
   <a href="The Queen (A Bug's Life).html" key="ac140774-aa39-4e02-940d-bd0efa9a093a" title="The Queen (A Bug's Life)">
    the Queen
   </a>
   from being killed. During this rescue, Manny does his magic act and is almost strangled by
   Hopper
   when he refuses to give up the Queen's location. He later pretends to die during the "bird attack," which makes
   P.T. Flea
   angry enough to
   <a href="Flaming Death.html" key="2125daef-45a9-49eb-8afc-e73d24ed2ce1" title="Flaming Death">
    set the fake bird on fire
   </a>
   (not realizing that it was a hoax to scare the grasshoppers).
  </p>
  <p key="81b1ba83-57cc-4736-9629-1fbae0f9c621">
   At the climax of the film, Manny participates in the final battle against the grasshoppers. Before leaving Ant Island, he presents
   Princess Atta
   with a rock, influenced by Flik's "seed to tree" concept in which a rock was used instead of a seed.
