   Ron was the manager of the
   Sleep Well
   motel. He has an anxious personality, with a tendency to laugh nervously. He loves iguanas, as evidenced by his
   eBid
   username, iguanaluvr75, and the fact that he owns one. He steals toys and other objects from his customers using his pet iguana
   Mr. Jones
   to take them, and sells them on the Internet. When

   her toys were in the manager's possession. When he was caught with Bonnie's toys,
   Bonnie's mother
   became furious at him and said that she should call the police.

   During the credits, two policemen arrived, asking him if he was the manager. Panicking, Ron nervously assured he wasn't, saying he would go get the manager, and disappeared in his office. He ran out the back door and attempted to hijack the patrol car. However, in his panic he failed to drive away, instead crashing into his motel's sign, which fell on the car. He left the smashed patrol car and ran off, as an officer simply alerted the police that they "got a runner."

   The team thought it important to to explain Ron's motivation to steal, but all scenes pertaining to this were finally cut. These would have revealed Ron was "raising money" to get a dream boat from "Bob's Boatyard", his neighbor. The sales of Woody and Jessie finally bring him enough money, and he immediately goes on to order the boat. In an alternate ending, it is towed to Ron precisely as he is arrested. Upon seeing this, the driver freaks out and drives backwards in a hurry, getting the boat accidentally smashed to pieces by a passing truck in the process, to Ron's dismay.
   In another deleted scene, it is revealed that Al McWhiggin is the buyer of Woody and Jessie, coincidentally buying the same toys which he had acquired in
