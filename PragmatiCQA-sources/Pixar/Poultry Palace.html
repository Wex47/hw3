   cashier
   for the
   Fun Meal Buzz
   . Unfortunately, the cashier says they are all sold out, and that the encased Mini-Buzz Lightyear was for display only. Feeling dejected that he would never get played with, the Mini-Buzz in the display case decides to escape and convinces
   Fun Meal Zurg
   , but Mini-Zurg refuses and says he would rather stay where he is. When Bonnie plays in the restaurant's ball pit with her own toys, Mini-Buzz surreptitiously enters the pit and pulls the real Buzz underneath the bunch of balls so Bonnie would end up taking Mini-Buzz home from the restaurant and play with him instead.

   Meanwhile, the real Buzz is stranded at the restaurant and tries to find a way to escape. He attempts to crawl through a vent system, but ends up falling into a storage room, where a group of
   Discarded Fun Meal Toys
   hold a support meeting.
   Queen Neptuna
   leads the meeting and, believing Buzz is another rejected toy, persuades him to take part in the meeting. Forced to comply, Buzz reluctantly participates, but eventually escapes the restaurant by making a clever ruse to the other abandoned toys and using a
   grappling hook toy
   to assist him in his escape. As for Mini-Buzz, after being chased and restrained by the toys at
   Bonnie's house
   , he is returned to the restaurant, where he acts as a "sponsor" for the entire support group.

    Poultry Palace appears to be a parody of either
    Burger King

    White Castle
    (both fast-food restaurant chains sporting a medieval/castle theme) and as well as KFC and Chick-Fil-A (both fast-food restaurant chains specializing in chicken-based products).

    The Poultry Palace Fun Meal is a parody of the Real-life
    McDonald's
    Happy Meal, as both meals come with a toy, and both of them supply new toys after the old ones are sold out or discontinued by their customers.
