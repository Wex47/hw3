   When the song starts, Andy, wearing his cowboy hat and cowboy pajamas, is jumping on the bed, holding Woody, and plays around with him, but then he sets Woody down on the floor next to a box labeled "Bank", brings out Buzz, "fires" his laser at Woody, and smacks Woody on the floor as if he has been blown away by Buzz's laser. Woody then watches as Andy runs into the closet, then emerges out wearing Buzz Lightyear pajamas and homemade spaceman's helmet, declaring "Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!" Woody then watches in horror as posters and drawings of him get replaced by those of Buzz, as well as a Buzz Lightyear blanket now on Andy's bed. Buzz is later seen teaching

On Andy's bed, Buzz is seen petting Slinky, whose back end is at the other side of the bed where Woody is sitting, with his wagging tail repeatedly whacking Woody's face, which makes Woody angrily shove Slinky's back end off the bed, causing Slinky's front end to fall off as well. Finally, at bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toy box until just Woody and Buzz are left, making him ponder which to keep and which to toss into the box, then the scene cuts to Andy sleeping in his bed with Buzz, with Woody watching in depression before he sinks back into the box as the song ends.

  <p key="06ca1a19-566a-4509-86da-dcd2efa0ac47">
   I was on top of the world, living high
   It was right in my pocket
   I was living the life
   Things were just the way they should be
   When from out of the sky like a bomb
   Comes some little punk in a rocket
   Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me
  </p>
  <p key="250e9ab2-8908-47b0-b126-3d0905f17f03">
   I had friends
   I had lots of friends
   Now all my friends are gone
   And I'm doing the best I can to carry on
  </p>
  <p key="74f92bf2-09b1-4aff-89b4-7c70eb126802">
   I had power (power)
   I was respected (respect)
   But not anymore
   And I've lost the love to the one whom I adored
  </p>
  <p key="87dae518-ef31-4ae7-b2e0-727fbbf723c7">
   Let me tell you about it
   Strange things are happening to me
   Strange things
   Strange things are happening to me...
   Ain't no doubt about it
  </p>
  <p key="6b881e26-e6d1-4f49-95ec-fad58f103ba1">
   You got someone you think you know well
   It turns out a stranger
   The minute you turn your back
   You're in it all by yourself
  </p>
  <p key="c5a990cc-c3e8-4e7a-b115-0789bb32033e">
   They laugh at your jokes
   You think you're doing quite well
   But you're in danger, boy
   You end up alone, forgotten, way up on the shelf
  </p>
  <p key="bbcbbcff-1d78-449c-b044-1a80ac96505d">
