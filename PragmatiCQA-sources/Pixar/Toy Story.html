   to her. While he's away, all of the toys come to life.
Woody wakes up finding out that Andy's birthday party is today and then calls his fellow toys to a staff meeting. The meeting begins with Woody asking if each of the toys has picked a moving buddy just to be prepared for the move for one week. He then informs the toys that Andy's birthday party has been moved to today, causing the toys to get very anxious about whether they get replaced or not. Woody claims that it only matters that he and his fellow toys are here for Andy. Hamm interrupts the staff meeting telling the other toys that Andy's birthday guests have arrived. Out the window, they see the guests carrying Andy's birthday presents, still worried about getting replaced.

   Woody sends Sarge and his team of plastic soldiers downstairs with a baby monitor to report on the presents Andy receives. Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which he drops in his room. Woody and the rest of the toys greet Buzz, who shows off his many features like a laser light and wings (while deluded, thinking he's actually a Space Ranger), making Woody feel jealous. This is intensified further when Andy begins playing with Buzz even more.

  <p key="6dc65fad-1d45-4396-ac6a-0dae8b441e0d">
   Sometime later, Ms. Davis takes Andy and Molly on a trip to the space-themed

   so Andy won't find him and will have to take Woody instead, but the plan goes badly wrong when Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out the window. When the other toys, including Mr. Potato Head, learn of Woody's actions, most of them (except Bo and Slinky) think Woody tried to kill Buzz out of jealousy. They then try to attack him, but Woody is rescued when Andy, who is unable to find Buzz, decides to take Woody on the trip instead.

Some are worried for both Buzz and Woody, while others express their hope that Woody has met a bad end. The next morning at Sid's house, Woody and Buzz, (the former having been burned on the forehead by Sid using a magnifying glass), try to escape, only to run into Sid's dog

Eventually escaping from Sid's room, Buzz watches a TV commercial for the line of toys of himself and realizes that Woody was right about him being a toy this whole time, and not a real space ranger.

   Woody finally finds Buzz in Hannah's room, disguised as Mrs. Nesbitt and attending a tea party. While Woody formulates a plan of escape, Buzz is too depressed to care. When Woody throws a string of Christmas lights across the way to the toys in Andy's room, Buzz refuses to back him up; Woody tries to use Buzz's detached arm in a desperate attempt to convince Andy's toys that Buzz is with him, but when they see through this act, they take it as evidence that Woody truly did murder Buzz and leave him in disgust for his duplicity. The Mutant Toys then return and swarm over Buzz, and Woody finds that they have repaired him and reconnected his arm. However, before Woody can make friends with them, Sid returns with his new acquisition, a firework rocket. He decides to blow up Woody with it, but cannot find him as Woody hides in a milk crate. Sid then decides to launch Buzz into space instead but is stymied by rainfall. He unknowingly traps Woody in the crate by putting a heavy toolbox on top, and plans to go ahead in the morning.

   Overnight, Woody tries to get Buzz to help him escape. Still depressed, Buzz pessimistically confesses that he is only a "stupid, little, insignificant" toy. Woody tries to convince him that being a toy is much better than being a Space Ranger, and Andy still thinks he's the best thing in the world. Buzz doesn't know why Andy would want him, and Woody explains while coming to terms with his own feelings of resentment:

You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that... that whoosh thing. You are a cool toy... as a matter of fact, you're too cool. I mean--I mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?

Unfortunately, Sid wakes up and takes Buzz out to blow him up, leaving Woody alone in the room. Even worse, Andy and his family are getting ready to move, with Andy depressed over having to have seemingly lost Woody and Buzz having only been able to find Buzz's cardboard spaceship and his cowboy hat. Desperate, Woody calls out to the Mutant Toys to help him, although it seemed they weren't willing to help him after Woody attacked them. Just when Woody was about to lose hope, Babyface convinces the Mutant Toys to help Woody as he tells him his plan, thanking them in the process.

   After a daring escape through the house and past Scud, Woody and the mutants end up in the yard with Sid. After getting into positions, Woody starts of the plan by speaking to him through his voice box just before Sid comes close to lighting the rocket, proceeding to tell him that his toys are sick of being tortured, breaking the rules as they allow Sid to see that they can move on their own, then with his own voice, Woody tells him (in a Kevin Conroy Batman-esque way) to play nice. This freaks Sid out and he runs into the house screaming, where his sister frightens him with her new doll

After saying farewell to the Mutant Toys, a harrowing chase follows, with Scud chasing them and Andy's toys not helping, since they still think that Woody intentionally killed both Buzz and RC. Luckily, Woody and Buzz trap Scud and the other toys finally see that Woody was telling the truth and realized their mistake. Unfortunately, RC's batteries run out, requiring Woody to light the rocket still strapped to Buzz. At first, Woody tries to use the match Sid stuck in his holster, but the car that nearly ran over Woody during the chase passes by them, blowing out the match. Just as Woody and Buzz accept defeat, Woody uses Buzz's helmet to light the rocket. As they hurtle forward, Woody drops RC into the van as they fly over, but not before hitting Mr. Potato Head. Just when it seems they would be destroyed by the rocket, Buzz activates his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes. Buzz and Woody glide over the van and drop into Andy's car through the skylight. Woody and Buzz return to Andy, whose mom assumes they were in the car all along.

   , in honor of American Naval aviator and NASA Apollo astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin.  The ventriloquist's dummy gradually evolved into a pull-string cowboy doll named Woody, in honor of Western actor Woody Strode. Woody's character was gradually made edgier during production, at the suggestion of Jeffrey Katzenberg, head of Disney.  Pixar knew this was the wrong decision, but went ahead and complied with the requested script changes.  Even Tom Hanks, Woody's voice actor, expressed his disapproval with the changes to Woody's character, going as far as shouting "This guy is a jerk!" in the middle of delivering one of his lines for the story reel. On November 19, 1993, a day that was later known at Pixar as "Black Friday," Pixar screened a mock-up of the film to Disney, who had agreed to own and distribute the film.  The executives' reaction was overwhelmingly negative, and further work on

   was shut down until writers had written with an acceptable script. In what would become a common reaction to production meltdowns on Pixar films, John Lasseter and the writers worked for months on a to rewrite the script before Disney approved further work on voice and animation.  The shutdown had been terrifying for Pixar, but it ultimately showed both parties to trust the storytelling talents of the Pixar writers, and let Disney handle most corporate and marketing matters.

  <p key="2c51558f-07d2-4fd3-8a4b-ccbbb3293811">
   Woody's final character was redefined as the benevolent, wise, and popular leader of Andy's toys instead of their tyrannical boss, but he maintained a lot of pride in being Andy's favorite toy. The original support group style discussion was replaced with a less juvenile and awkward staff meeting, to further emphasize the toys' approval of Woody's leadership and make it clear to Disney that Pixar had done much to improve his image. Buzz's character was also tweaked a little bit as well. Pixar altered his lines to make him seem more deluded and convinced that he is an actual Space Ranger.  This allowed for more gags and comedic opportunities than was possible with the previous script and allowed buddy-comedy style interactions for the first time.

   More recently, famous movie director Terry Gilliam praised the film and said it's "a work of genius. It got people to understand what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period."
