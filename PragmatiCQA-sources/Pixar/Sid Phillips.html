When Sid goes after him, not only does he get Buzz, but Woody hooked onto his foot as well (as he tried to save Buzz, but the Aliens wouldn't let him). After skateboarding back home with his new toys in his backpack, he is immediately greeted by Scud, whom he gives the alien to viciously chew. Then, seeing his sister

   , he grabs the toy and runs up to his room, slamming the door in Hannah's face. He then pulls out his Pterodactyl toy as he plays doctor for his "double-bypass brain transplant." After putting the Pterodactyl's head on Janie's body, he opens up the door and shows it to Hannah, who runs off to report to their mother. Sid throws the mutant toy onto the floor and runs after her, claiming Hannah is lying. With Sid gone, Woody explores his room to search for a way out, but the door is locked and he's unable to escape. Trying to find another way out, he then discovers that Sid has disassembled other toys and reassembled them in strange combinations, much to Woody's horror. 
The next morning, Sid torments Buzz by spinning him on a drill bit (as seen in a deleted scene) and then takes Woody and throws him across the floor, pretending to interrogate him. Next, he opens up the window shade to let the sun in. He then takes a magnifying glass and focuses the hot beam of light on Woody's forehead, until Sid's mom interrupts and says his Pop-Tarts are ready.

   Later, Sid returns to his room with a firework rocket he had ordered in the mail, labeled "

   ." He intends to blow apart one of his toys with the rocket for his own amusement, initially, intending to blow up that "wimpy cowboy doll", but fails to find him (Woody hid underneath a nearby milk crate). However, after unexpectedly stepping on Buzz, he tapes the rocket on Buzz, claiming that he has always wanted to "put a spaceman into orbit". Unfortunately for Sid, he is forced to delay the launch due to a sudden rainstorm or as he puts it, "Adverse weather conditions at the launch site". This delay gives Woody and Buzz time to reconcile and embrace each other's friendship overnight.

  <p key="88c2f376-c170-421f-9170-2c2a8c1d9841">
   The next morning, Sid is woken up by his mutant alarm clock and takes Buzz outside to blow him up. Woody and all of the

   plan a way to exact revenge on Sid for his treatment of them and help Buzz before Sid can destroy him with the rocket. The toys all appear out of nowhere and approach Sid, making him increasingly scared. Woody then tells Sid to take care of his toys, because they will know if he did not. After seeing Woody come to life by saying "So play nice" in front of his face, it's too much for Sid and he screams and retreats back into the house, frightened that the toys have come alive. Hannah, who has just gotten a new doll, then takes pleasure in further scaring Sid with it, thus making him cry after discovering how scared he is.

   Sid's rocket is ultimately used by Woody during the move to Andy's new house to help RC, whose batteries have been depleted, back into the moving truck as Woody and Buzz both go skyrocketing, during which Buzz frees himself from the rocket by opening his wings to tear off the tapes that bound him to the rocket (as for the rocket, it climbed up for a few feet higher before exploding into smithereens).

Sid is mostly heard scatting to music and is identified by having the same skull T-shirt that he wore as a kid, along with a blue shirt underneath, a yellow vest, goggles, a small beard, a mullet in contrast to his buzzed head as a kid, a backward camouflage cap, and a big set of headphones. He is seen again near the end of the film after the toys escape from the incinerator at the

   Sid is not a true villain, being that he didn't realize that the toys are really alive when breaking them, but since this movie is in the point of view of toys, he can be considered an antagonist.
