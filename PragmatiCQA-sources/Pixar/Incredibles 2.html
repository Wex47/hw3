   It was revealed at 2017 D23 Expo that the sequel will have the characters the same age as they were in the first film and that it takes place immediately after the first film.
   Elastigirl
   will take a more prominent role as she is taken on an adventure, while
   Mr. Incredible
   stays at home and spends some time with the kids. Another plot description comes from an Instagram post, "

   Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl leave Jack-Jack with

   and
   Dash
   as they take on the
   <a href="The Underminer.html" key="21a1bb39-0220-451a-bc21-0b61dccb1dff" title="The Underminer">
    Underminer
   </a>
   , who is causing havoc while robbing a bank. Violet's love interest
   Tony Rydinger
   discovers her superhero identity, forcing Agent
   Rick Dicker
   to erase his memory. When the Parr family's attempt to stop the Underminer from robbing Metroville Bank fails, the authorities become concerned over the level of damage caused by the incident. Rick Dicker informs the Parr family that his department's "Super Relocation" program is being shut down, forcing Supers across the world to permanently adhere to their secret identities; the last assistance he can offer is to put the family up in a motel for two weeks, since their home was destroyed in the incident with Syndrome in the first film. At dinner, the Parrs argue about what happened earlier, with Helen being against the others, claiming that they need to forget about being Supers.
  </p>
  <p key="7dd0418a-7adf-4077-be0b-ae80b310a99f">
   Soon thereafter, Bob and Helen, along with family friend
   Lucius Best
   – the superhero Frozone – are contacted by
   Winston Deavor
   , a superhero fan, telecommunications tycoon, and owner of DevTech. Winston and his sister
   Evelyn Deavor
   , the genius inventor behind DevTech technology, propose a publicity stunt to regain the public's support and trust in Supers.
  </p>
  <p key="540a0030-4684-4d74-9c47-9f9648105449">
   Helen is selected to be the first to undertake the stunt by openly fighting crime in New Urbem, under her old identity Elastigirl, as she is the least destructive of the three. As part of the plan, Winston provides the family with a new home and Bob offers to take care of the kids while Helen is away on her mission. In New Urbem, Elastigirl stops a newly built monorail train from crashing after it unexpectedly goes backwards at a high speed. She discovers that the train driver was under the influence of the
   Screenslaver
   , a villain who hypnotizes people through any monitor he hacks into. During an interview with
   Chad Brentley
   , everyone minus Elastigirl is hypotized by the Screenslaver. Through Brentley, the Screenslaver reveals his plans to kill the Ambassador by hijacking the escort helicopter she's on. However, Elastigirl quickly comes to her rescue, and brings her down to the ground, where she faints.
  </p>
  <p key="4f855280-4c2b-456c-9845-029c64b23ccc">
   Bob struggles at first but gradually settles into the role of a stay-at-home parent, though he becomes fatigued due to having to deal with each of his children's problems. He is delighted at the discovery that Jack-Jack has various super powers, but has a hard time trying to manage the baby's abilities. Jack-Jack wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers after seeing a
   raccoon
   outside that resembled a criminal on TV. When Bob accidentally lets slip Tony's memory wipe, Violet is furious at him. He takes the family, minus Helen to
   The Happy Platter
   , where Dicker told Bob Tony works, but ends in embarrassment for Violet as she squirts water out of her nose when she sees Tony.
  </p>
  <p key="629a66be-c8c4-41bd-886b-be4d0fb9a341">
   Elastigirl's recent actions have caused a movement of superheroes stepping out into the public, wanting to help out others like Supers did in the past. These include the likes of
   Voyd
   , who is excited to meet her favourite Super. Elastigirl and Evelyn formulate a plan to track down the Screenslaver and capture him. Elastigirl tracks down and manages to capture the Screenslaver, who is only a pizza delivery man and has no recollection of what he did; he is arrested and imprisoned at Helen's advice. While attending a celebration of the Screenslaver's defeat at DEVTECH, Helen further investigates and realizes that the man was actually being controlled by hypno-screens within his goggles. Before Helen can alert anyone, Evelyn Deavor overpowers her and forces
   hypno-goggles
   onto her.
  </p>
  <p key="a84b9533-bf7f-4b78-b162-d48c5db0d191">
   Seeking help with Jack-Jack, Bob takes him to
   Edna Mode
   , a family friend and famous superhero-costume designer, who is fascinated with the baby's powers. After Bob goes back home, he has a chat with Violet, apologizing for the ordeal he put her through, thought she tells him he is 'super' just as he falls asleep. Bob wakes up after sleeping for 17 hours, and goes to Edna's to pick up Jack-Jack. Edna shows Bob how the baby's suit works, and that he can use a device to control his powers.
  </p>
  <p key="f666b391-8b74-4b40-b8b7-4a1faf03de26">
   Evelyn reveals herself to be the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Her hatred for supers stems from her father's murder several years ago, where instead of hiding and calling the police from intruders, her father attempted to call the supers, but was unable to reach them and was discovered and fatally shot by the intruders. Seeing Supers as a threat to humanity's independence, she sought to undermine her brother's mission and plans to use the superheroes to cause a catastrophe that makes it impossible for them to ever be legalized again, which will result in thousands of deaths.
  </p>
  <p key="e6f6f8af-7eb0-4d1c-af2d-ffd97bd237ce">
   Back at home, Bob demonstrates Jack-Jack's powers using his new supersuit and device to his elder children, who are excited by the array of his powers. Bob then gets a call from Evelyn who claims that his wife needs help, but is using the call to lure him so she can hypnotise him. Bob tells Lucius to come over to babysit the kids while he is home. Evelyn uses Helen to lure Bob into a trap and sends other mind-controlled supers wearing the goggles to attempt to put the Parr children under her control. Lucius defends the children before the mind-controlled supers subdue and hypnotize him with the goggles.
  </p>
  <p key="6e0259ac-60d4-4a62-b779-a5c6048dde5b">
   Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack are able to escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by Bob. They flee the house in the car and locate the Deavors' ship. On the superyacht, there is a hearing of leaders to re-legalize superheroes, with Ambassador Selick being the first to sign the International Supers Accord to legalize Supers. Violet leaves Jack-Jack with Dash and looks for their parents, but knocks over a pot plant and alerts the hypnotized wannabe Supers. Voyd finds and fights Violet, but fails to put a pair of hypno-goggles on her.
  </p>
  <p key="d96cf171-a79f-45a8-aa8e-04c849ddf54f">
   On board, the mind-controlled Helen, Bob and Lucius recite a vindictive manifesto on air to paint themselves – and Supers in general – as a public threat. Everybody else on the superyacht including Winston is hypnotized so that the three hypnotised Supers can divert the vessel towards shore unopposed, putting many lives at risk and further tarnishing the reputation of all Supers. Violet leaves Jack-Jack with Dash and looks for their parents, but trips over a pot plant, alerting the hypnotized wannabe Supers. Voyd uses a portal to intercept Violet, and the two fight. Voyd tries to place a pair of hypno-goggles on Violet, but is kicked away before she can.
  </p>
  <p key="d056877b-a7e7-4b92-ae94-4e301127040a">
   The hypnotized Supers are freed from Evelyn's control when Jack-Jack uses his telekinesis power to dislodge his mother's hypno-goggles, and displays other powers, surprising her. The wannabe Supers are released from their hypnosis as well, and a plan to stop Evelyn from escaping and stop the ship from crashing into the city is put in place. Evelyn tries to escape in a getaway jet attached to the ship but is eventually stopped and captured by Helen. Mr. Incredible turns the ship using the rudder since Krushauer blocked access to the bridge with pipes, while Frozone attempts to help steer the ship using ice. The ship reaches shore just as it is about to stop, but Frozone lays a thick layer of snow as a buffer against the nearby buildings to prevent any structural damage. Following the incident, Evelyn is arrested; she indicates gratitude towards Helen for saving her from falling to her death for the plane, but still dislikes supers. Supers around the world regain full legal status. The Supers are thanked and the Supers Relocation Program is finally revoked, making Supers legal once again.
  </p>
  <p key="eab57d71-d9f6-454d-8a3b-b749a7841f70">
   A while later after the battle, Tony Rydinger, a boy at school who Violet had a crush on, agrees to a date with her at a movie. He leaves for the theater with the Parrs. However, at the theater the Parrs witness a car of bank-robbers armed with machine guns driving down the street. Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising she would be back before the previews end. The Parrs then don their masks, ready to pursue the criminals.
