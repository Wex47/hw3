However, during his short appearance, it's easy to tell that he still loves his toys and that the toys still feel the same about him. When he accidentally rips in Woody's arm, his mom feels sorry for him, stating that toys don't last forever, a sentiment fueled by Stinky Pete who wants Woody to go on display and by

   Also, in Woody's nightmare, Andy comes back home early from Cowboy Camp and plays around with Woody until he notices Woody's ripped arm and decides he doesn't want to play with him anymore, dropping Woody through some cards and into a trash can, which he shuts the lid, trapping Woody inside. However, at the end of the film, when Andy finally returns home, he is the one who fixes Woody, stating that his arm may have come off completely (which it did when Woody was at Al's apartment) if he hadn't decided to leave him home.

   A small scene shows Andy looking for the missing toys, through the lost eye of Mrs. Potato Head. The toys eventually make it back home, and Woody climbs into a box bound for college while the others climb into a box destined for the attic. While Andy gives his farewell to Molly and Buster, Woody writes on a sticky note, suggesting Andy to donate the box of toys to a little girl named
   Bonnie Anderson
   instead. Andy sees his toys in the box, reads the note, and asks his mom if they should be donated, to which she leaves it to Andy's decision.

   Andy then drives over to
   Bonnie's house
   to give her his toys and make her promise to take good care of them, since they have meant a lot to him. Then Bonnie peeks into the box to see Woody inside. She wants to have Woody, but Andy is initially reluctant to give his favorite toy away, but notices how much Bonnie loves Woody, just like he has during his childhood years, and hands Woody over as well, telling her to take special care of him.

   He stays at Bonnie's house to play with his toys one last time. As he prepares to pull away from Bonnie's house, he turns to give his toys one last fond look, and thanks them for the fun and joy they have brought him.
