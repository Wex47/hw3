   The film is produced in a style of limited animation that intentionally parodies the low-budget, low-quality TV Saturday morning cartoons that aired regularly during the era of the 1950s and 1960s. TV animation studios in America were contracted to turn out high quantities of product on low budgets, and this resulted in a large number of TV cartoons that have been derided and mocked by TV critics, film and animation historians and even, audiences in general.

  <p key="1ac2e4ee-af5d-4e5f-8d45-719339b6b9e9">
   The episode begins with Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and Mr. Skipperdoo discussing the previous events, that while they were gone an evil villainess named Lady Lightbug stole the bridge connecting the city, leaving cars stuck on either side of the river trapped. Frozone builds a temporary bridge of ice, and the three skate away to find the arch-nemesis.
  </p>
  <p key="f878637e-938f-428a-a78e-37a0d855b857">
   Arriving at an abandoned carnival, Mr. Incredible goes about searching for Lady Lightbug, lifting up various objects while stating that she is not under any of them. Mr. Skipperdoo hops to point out that resting on top of the object Mr. Incredible is holding is the missing bridge. Lady Lightbug then flies out at that moment and informs them all of her evil plan. She shoots a line of silk out of the end of her abdomen, tying up Frozone and leaving all as lost. Suddenly, Mr. Incredible lunges at her, knocking her out of the air, and leaving her defeated. The missing bridge piece is restored and all returns back to normal thanks to Mr. Incredible.

  <p key="9862c667-ec50-40df-a599-a0d6bbff742d">
   In addition to the many in-jokes and animation references included in this cartoon, the voice actors for Mr. Incredible and Frozone (
   Craig T. Nelson
   and
   Samuel L. Jackson
   ) provided a DVD commentary for the short film, acting in character as if they were the actual Mr. Incredible and Frozone, watching this film for the first time more than thirty years after it was produced. The background story behind
   <i key="b5ce0b6e-0235-4eb3-8a9e-94e4ae83b9e9">
    Mr. Incredible and Pals
   </i>
   stated that many years before the ban on Supers, Mr. Incredible and Frozone licensed their names and images to a TV animation company, and this was the pilot episode for an animated TV series that never aired due to the Super ban.
  </p>
  <p key="55bb46be-f848-4129-aec1-262862a14eee">
   The commentary of the two characters provides additional entertainment for the DVD's viewers, as while Mr. Incredible appears to display only apathy for the episode, Frozone is aghast and disgusted at its campyness and supposed racism (the cartoon version of himself appears to be white, or as Mr. Incredible puts it: tan.) He is also annoyed by the rabbit, which is something Mr. Incredible can agree with. By the end of the short, Frozone is so annoyed that he walks out of the commentary at the end while threatening to end their friendship if the episode ever airs.
