   The year is 2805 A.D. The
   Earth
   is a barren wasteland covered in what are literally mountains of trash, suffering from numerous sandstorms and torrential downpours. Over 700 years ago, the mega-conglomerate corporation
   Buy n Large
   (BNL) assumed control of the planet's entire economy, including the government, and humanity spiralled into a state of mass consumerism, quickly covering the planet in building-sized quantities of trash. In the year 2105, BNL CEO
   Shelby Forthright
   sponsored a five-year exodus from Earth into space aboard a fleet of
   BnL starliners
   , the most prominent of them being the
   <i key="8dd720ae-56b9-4fbf-99ba-f7e1cd83bce4">
    Axiom
   </i>
   , BNL's largest starliner - 40 miles long and 10 miles wide. It is taking a luxury cruise while countless
   WALL•E
   (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) units were left behind to compress the trash into small cubes with which they used to build colossal towers to be incinerated by huge city block wide-sized
   incinerators
   as part of the proposed "
   Operation Cleanup
   ". They were to then initiate "
   Operation Recolonize
   ", returning to Earth after five years, which was believed to be enough time to clean the planet. This plan failed, however, and as Earth was deemed too toxic to re-inhabit. BNL subsequntly abandonded the plan and left earth for good.

   The Wall-E's slowly stopped functioning over the years. The last active WALL-E on Earth has continued the same routine each and every day for 700 years. Each morning he would wake up and recharge his solar cells before setting off to fulfill his directive of constructing trash towers with compressed cubes, then return to
   his truck
   , a large vehicle designed for carrying the WALL-Es over all terrains, to shut down for the night. But by this time, he has become sentient and developed a personality. To cope with the boredom of doing the same thing every day, other than working with his trusty cockroach companion
   Hal
   , he has become extremely curious. Whenever he would find anything he finds interesting in the refuse (a
   Rubik's cube
   , a light bulb, a match lighter, etc.) he would place it in a BnL cooler and take it back to his truck at the end of the day, placing it in his ever-growing knick-knack collection. He would also salvage spare parts for himself from his fellow deactivated WALL•E units, storing the most important pieces at home should the worst happen. The pride of his collection is a VHS copy of
   <i key="a49d4f56-f249-405e-9906-ce436cd382fa">

   </i>
   , which has taught him how to dance as well as all of his emotions. He loves the film and its music so much that he plays the song "Put On Your Sunday Clothes" while he works, and when he watches the scene with the song "It Only Takes a Moment", he learns how to hold hands; however, because he has no one else to hold hands with, he becomes lonely.
  </p>
  <p key="18ac09cc-faa7-4c1e-96d7-87cb750eea6a">
   One day, while collecting trash, he discovers something unlike anything else he has seen: a seedling
   plant
   . Stricken by its beauty and delicate appearance, he carefully pots it in an old boot he had collected earlier in the day. While returning home from work later that day, WALL-E notices a small red dot on the ground and decides to chase after it, ending up in the middle of a clearing. It turns out that the dot is actually a tracking laser of a landing
   ship
   . WALL-E immediately burrows underground for safety when he is caught underneath the ship as it lands; when he emerges, he witnesses a small white pod emerging from the ship. The pod opens itself and moves, revealing a sleek, state-of-the-art feminine probe-droid, who immediately begins scanning the area as if searching for something. WALL-E is stunned by the elegant-looking robot and falls in love with her upon first sight, but is too timid to speak to her, especially when she demonstrates her unhesitating will to fire her arm cannon at any sudden movement. WALL-E's companion Hal decides to approach the probe out of curiosity, and she shoots him, but when she finds that her target is a harmless cockroach, she shows signs of lightheartedness by playing with him. However, she is startled by WALL-E when he chuckles quietly and fires at him. When WALL-E is exposed and boxes himself, the probe holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know who he is; Hal defends the little robot by crawling into his hand. The probe scans him, subsequently deeming him non-hostile returning to her mission, thinking nothing else of him. WALL-E shrugs off the probe's hostility and proceeds to follow her to try and attract her attention as quietly as he could, only to be dismissed a couple of times. Soon she begins to grow annoyed with not finding what she is looking for, but after taking her anger out on a cargo ship crane that she gets stuck to and destroys, she gives up. By now, WALL-E summons up the nerve to approach the probe while she is upset and she turns to notice him finally. The little robot introduces himself and shows his directive to her once she asks him about it. The probe, while refusing to disclose her classified "directive", becomes amused by his behavior, and formally introduces herself as "
   EVE
   ". A sandstorm suddenly brews, and WALL-E directs EVE to his truck for shelter.

   After being saved, EVE is fascinated when she sees all the little knick-knacks WALL•E has collected. Among his treasures, he shows her

   and tries to teach her how to dance. Unfortunately, it gets a little out of hand when on the first try, she slams her bottom on the floor multiple times, and on the second try, she incidentally knocks WALL-E away, busting his right eye. Fortunately, he is able to repair himself with a spare eyepiece. He tries to hold her hand as he had seen in the film, which he determines to be an act of sharing love. Unfortunately, for him, EVE does not understand what he is trying to do and thus does not return his feelings, especially as she is distracted by the mesmerizing flame of a match lighter and does not fully appreciate the film as he does. WALL-E decides to show her the plant he found. Suddenly, EVE scans the plant, and her system automatically initiates a standby mode, which takes the plant and stores it inside her torso, sealing up into her pod form and shutting down. WALL-E does not understand why she will not unlock or speak to him, but nonetheless does everything in his power to keep her motionless body safe from the elemental hazards of the desolate Earth in the hopes she will wake up, taking her out on a series of "dates" in the process. Eventually, WALL-E gives up hope that she will ever awaken and leaves to resume his work. Soon the ship EVE arrived in returns and takes her away. While it is clear that EVE had sent a homing beacon to her ship to collect her (the light on her that would continually flash green), WALL-E is unwilling to leave her and climbs onto the side of the ship, telling Hal to stay where he is, clinging on as it launches off the planet and into the depths of space. WALL-E gazes in wonder at the beautiful cosmos as he arrives aboard the

   Still deactivated, EVE is taken to a group of cleaning robots led by a small robot named
   M-O
   . WALL-E manages to get to EVE by posing as the third probe, dumbfounding and irritating M-O with the amount of dirt on his body. The two robots engage in a brief, mild conflict about his filthy body when the ship's second-in-command,
   GO-4
   , inspects EVE while a couple of assigned Stewards follow.
   GO-4
   finds that she is storing the plant inside her, so he summons a cart-like transport robot called
   MVR•A
   to take her away. GO-4 hops on the transport bot and a robot arm loads EVE on it. WALL-E immediately starts to chase the MVR-A. As M-O prepares to leave to return to hibernation, he notices that WALL-E has left an awful amount of filth behind by his tracks. M-O ultimately decides to forgo hibernation and clean these tracks on his own, knowing they will lead him to WALL-E, and obsessively initiates a cat-and-mouse chase while unknowingly developing the ability to think for himself. Around this time, WALL-E discovers that the humans aboard the vessel have lost several bones and are morbidly obese, having adapted after centuries of living in microgravity, consuming liquefied food, and leaving all manual labor to be handled by the robots. They never acknowledge each other in ways other than through holo-screens in front of their faces, and cannot even move without a
   hoverchair
   or other automated assistance. Even piloting the ship is left in the care of the automatic-pilot, aptly named "
   AUTO
   "; the only thing that

   , really does is make the morning announcement each and every day, as well as re-check the ship's status with AUTO. WALL-E encounters a man named

    John

   Mary
   , awakening her to the world around her, mainly the pool, which utterly amazes her.

  <p key="ad9635e7-ce63-49cd-9779-2fec0084cc49">
   MVR-A takes EVE to the Captain, who is suddenly surprised that she has returned "positive" (i.e., with a plant), and learns of
   Shelby Forthright
   's "
   Operation Recolonize
   "; all he needs to do now is bring the plant to the holo-detector on the
   lido deck
   , and the Axiom will automatically hyperjump to Earth. EVE reactivates and finds WALL-E, telling him to stay hidden. But when the Captain prepares to take the plant, he finds that it is missing. EVE assumes that WALL-E took it, though he was never seen doing such a thing. Unable to find the plant anywhere, AUTO declares that EVE's memory is faulty and that things can go back to normal. The Captain similarly dismisses the event as a false alarm and orders GO-4 to take EVE to the
   repair ward
   for diagnosis. WALL-E is suddenly discovered, and he shakes hands with the Captain, getting dirt on his hand. The Captain has WALL-E taken with EVE to be cleaned. As they leave on MVR•A for the repair ward, EVE becomes cold towards WALL-E, believing that he had not only stolen but also lost the plant, much to his dismay. The Captain analyzes the dirt WALL-E left and discovers that he is from Earth. His curiosity about humanity's former home planet is ultimately sparked, and he becomes enthralled in researching what it is like.

   As M-O continues to clean up the messy tracks, WALL•E and EVE arrive at the repair ward with all the other malfunctioning robots on the ship; EVE is fitted with a
   red boot
   that deactivates her with the press of a button. She is taken into a room behind a translucent screen as WALL•E is placed in a cell. Her ion cannon arm is removed and she is cleaned, but while EVE actually enjoys the experience, WALL•E misinterprets it by what he can see and hear and believes she is being tortured. WALL•E escapes his cell by using his laser and breaks into the diagnosis room, grabbing her detached arm and incidentally fires it at the electric power cell of the room, shutting down the repairing robots and releasing the legitimately haywire robots from their cells. To WALL-E's hurt, EVE angrily yells at him. In the process, WALL-E incidentally begins playing "Put on Your Sunday Clothes". As WALL•E is whisked away by the malfunctioning robots who declare him a hero for freeing them, they are caught by several Stewards, making the defects pause in their tracks. This allows EVE to track WALL-E down. However, EVE and WALL-E are photographed by a Steward. The taken images makes appear as if she is going to attack the Steward with her ion cannon, he who labels her as a "rogue robot". EVE and WALL-E avoid the Stewards as they escape to the escape pods' center, with WALL-E feeling chagrined about the whole ordeal.

   Annoyed with WALL•E for the unintentional problems he caused on the Axiom, EVE activates an escape pod (#12) set to return him to
   Earth
   . WALL•E wants EVE to come with him but she refuses, stating that she must stay to find the plant and fulfill her directive. Slightly offended, WALL-E stubbornly refuses to leave, frustrating EVE even more. They are then forced to hide when
   GO-4
   enters the room and activates the pod's self-destruct sequence. He then places
   the plant
   inside, exposing himself as the culprit of stealing the plant from EVE when she was deactivated. Before EVE can apologize for blaming him, WALL-E goes into the pod to retrieve the plant, but GO-4 launches it with him inside, and EVE gives chase to try and save him. Realizing that he cannot stop the pod or its self-destruct sequence, WALL-E tries to make an escape by opening the emergency hatch, but it is stuck. As he begins banging on the door with a fire extinguisher, the escape pod explodes. Aghast, EVE rushes to the scene when WALL-E flies past her by completely unharmed, having managed to escape at the last second and find propulsion with the fire extinguisher. EVE is deeply relieved and happily reconciles with WALL-E, but before it even comes to her mind, WALL-E presents to her the plant, also unharmed. EVE is overjoyed and, after taking back the plant, spins WALL-E around while hugging him, and gives a "kiss" in the form of a small static shock, and they share a dance in space around the

   a couple of Stewards remain alert for the rogues. Whilst hiding, WALL-E tries to hold her hand again whilst playing "It Only Takes a Moment" on his recording section, but EVE is much too concerned with carrying out her directive, that she rejects his offer, upsetting him once more. She spots a
   garbage truck robot
   that drops garbage to a nearby garbage chute and after the bot has left she decides to sneak onto the bridge through the same chute by flying to the Captain's location, telling  WALL-E to stay put. She presents the plant to the Captain who, after being completely fascinated with the customs on Earth he had learned about, such as farming and dancing, decides to watch her security recordings of Earth; however, he is shocked and confused to see that Earth is not the green paradise he learned it to be. When he sees a leaf fall off the plant, he briefly panics before getting the notion that it needs to be watered, and goes to do so. As they watch the recordings, EVE witnesses footage from the
   <i key="fda01a63-e2de-42c2-add0-f90b9117073c">
    Hello, Dolly!

   video that WALL-E had shown her before. She watches the scene with "It Only Takes a Moment", which she did not previously appreciate, and learns how to hold hands much like WALL-E had, recognizing the gesture as the one WALL-E made toward her. The recording then begins to play security footage of what happened when she took the plant and entered standby mode, and she sees everything that WALL-E did to protect her motionless body, as well as all the "dates" he took her on. She is deeply moved by WALL-E's deeds, feeling a little regretful for dismissing him and realizing that he truly loves her, begins to fall in love with him as well. Meanwhile, WALL-E attempts to put his feelings for EVE in the right words. He gives up upon realizing how hard confessing his love to EVE was, until he decides to follow her, slowly climbing up the garbage chute. While exiting the

   After he waters the plant, the Captain has an epiphany: a great deal of care and work is needed in order to benefit Earth, and that humanity must return to make amends for their past mistakes and save it. He prepares to place the plant in the holo-detector, but AUTO tries to take it from him, saying that they cannot return to Earth. AUTO refuses to disclose why not as it was classified information (even for the Captain), but the annoyed Captain orders him to reveal his intentions. AUTO plays the recording of a top-secret announcement by
   Shelby Forthright
   , explaining how "
   Operation Cleanup
   " had failed and he deemed Earth too toxic to ever support life again. He hastily issued
   Directive A-113
   , which was for autopilots to stay the course in space and never return to Earth. The Captain and EVE were stunned, learning that this video was shot over 695 years ago and that things have now changed: if one plant can survive on Earth, then that certainly proves that Earth is now habitable. Looking at the images of the previous captains, the Captain notices that AUTO is moving closer to the captains in each generation, meaning he has slowly been taking control.
  </p>
  <p key="01320aa9-0836-4b23-a416-e88ef2e580cd">
   Deciding to officially take command, the Captain demands that AUTO stand down. AUTO, however, overrules this, being unable to disobey his directive, and stages a mutiny with
   GO-4
   , who steals the plant back for AUTO. It also turns out that AUTO secretly ordered GO-4 to remove the plant from the deactivated EVE and place it in the escape pod on self-destruct mode. EVE attempts to shoot GO-4 into returning it in her chest, but AUTO's hench-bot instead throws it down the garbage chute. Fortunately, it conveniently lands on top of WALL-E's head as he climbs up to find EVE, much to EVE and the Captain's relief. However, GO-4 restrains EVE, before WALL-E could throw the plant to her and WALL-E and AUTO began a fight over the plant in which WALL•E smacks AUTO with his chest cavity and shoves the plant inside. However, AUTO violently electrocutes his motherboard with his taser, causing WALL-E's control systems to go awry and to helplessly fall down the chute. EVE watches in complete horror, whilst screaming for WALL-E. AUTO then deactivates the horrified EVE with her red boot and has her sent down the chute as well before proceeding to lock the Captain in his quarters and terminating all forms of communication.

   EVE reactivates when the
   REM-Es

   waste disposal facility
   , inhabited by a pair of giant
   WALL•A
   robots, which are much like WALL•E with the exception of size. She is trapped inside a large compressed garbage cube, her boot breaking off in the process, and placed in an airlock, set to be jettisoned into space with the seriously damaged WALL-E, with the hidden plant. EVE blasts herself free from her cube, flies over to WALL-E and struggles to free him before he airlock is activated.
   M-O
   appears in the chamber, having followed WALL-E there while fixated on cleaning his filthy trail, and charges towards them. The doors close on M-O's form, keeping them open, but the airlock is activated. EVE, holding WALL-E in her arm, clings onto M-O as they are being sucked into the vacuum of space. The WALL-As take notice and deactivate the airlock, saving them. As M-O quickly recovers from this traumatizing experience, finally cleaning as well as befriending WALL•E, EVE helps comfort WALL-E and finds that WALL-E's confrontation with AUTO has burned and damaged his motherboard. She desperately scans the airlock, finding some spare parts for him. WALL-E gives her the plant, telling her to bring it to the holo-detector and fulfill her directive, but EVE, now in love with him refuses. She tosses the plant aside and declares that her new directive is to be with WALL-E, as she believes their love is all that matters. She offers to hold WALL-E's hand much to WALL-E's surprise. However, to EVE's bewilderment, he declines and picks up the plant, insisting she return it, but EVE is rather indecisive. WALL-E consoles and reminds her that if they return the plant, they will return to Earth, where he had stockpiled spare parts for himself which can be used to repair him. EVE finally agrees and with WALL-E, M-O and the plant in tow, they escape the facility, while the WALL-As wave goodbye.

The enraged Captain summons the strength to stand up on his own and resume his fight with AUTO. He manages to relieve AUTO of duty by switches him to manual control and tilts the

Relieved, EVE proceeds to try and hold his hand like they desired so many times before, but WALL-E does not seem to recognize her, turning away and preparing to leave. It is apparent that WALL-E loses his memory after the incident. EVE does everything in her power to make him remember her: she shows him his treasured knick-knacks as well as

In one final attempt, she tries to play WALL-E's recording of "It Only Takes a Moment", but finds that it too has been erased, and she concedes that the WALL-E she knew and loved is gone forever. Sad and heartbroken, EVE finally takes a hold of his hand and softly hums "It Only Takes a Moment" herself before giving him a parting "kiss", causes another static electric shock. She prepares to leave in sorrow, but her fingers are stuck between his. Suddenly, WALL-E slowly grasps EVE's hand, his eyes readjust, and he recognizes her; the spark of the kiss had rebooted his memory, as the first one had left him lovestruck, so to speak. EVE is filled with joy, WALL-E is ecstatic that their hands are together, and they embrace for a tender kiss. The other robots, who had followed, are ushered away by M-O to give them some privacy. WALL-E and EVE prepare to spend the rest of their lives together alongside their new robot friends, and assisting the humans while they work to restore the Earth to its former glory; first starting by planting the little seedling in the ground.

   Over the end credits, the restoration of Earth is depicted through pictures that evolve from rather primitive hieroglyphs to impressive paintings. As the years pass, Earth becomes as lush and green as ever, and humans have become active to the extent that they regain their former body structures. In the end, WALL-E and EVE are still together and holding hands, and they observe a large tree; it is shown that this tree is the plant that had brought them home many years before.

   and a pair of binoculars that Stanton was playing with at an A's baseball game.
   He noticed that he could demonstrate emotions such as happiness or sadness by just moving the binoculars, or the eyes, up or down - that it wasn't necessary to have other parts of the face like a nose or mouth. One of the key design elements of
   WALL•E
   was that it should be a machine first and a character second.
   The Pixar team, although exceptionally gifted with creating lifelike facial expressions, were concerned about the audience's response to a film that would have no spoken dialog for the first 30 minutes. Andrew Stanton and the producers encouraged the animators to watch early silent films from the 1920s and 30s to become more proficient in expressing emotion without the use of spoken dialogue. The music also helped convey much of the emotion during this part of the movie.

   was also the first Pixar movie to feature live-action footage, which was used to give the caricatured CGI characters an appearance that suggested they had severely devolved from their ancestors who had left Earth. Much of the "fat" on these characters were modelled on baby fat and marine mammal blubber, which tends to have quite a different appearance from the fat on an obese adult.
