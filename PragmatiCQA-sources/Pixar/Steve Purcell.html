  <p key="ceb5626e-2117-40e6-a0f2-e9c8f8f26dc8">
   Purcell entered into a career with comic books while an undergraduate at the California College of Arts and Crafts in
   1980
   , where he produced comic strips for the weekly newsletter.
   These strips featured Sam and Max, an anthropomorphic dog and rabbit duo who work as vigilantes and private investigators; Purcell drew the first strip the night before the deadline.
   Following graduation, Purcell became involved in freelance illustration, working briefly for Marvel Comics and on Steven Moncuse's
   <i key="09edcb65-f0c6-4544-9426-331ea4c43580">
    Fish Police
   </i>
   series. In
   1987
   , Moncuse approached Purcell about the possibility of another comic book series to accompany his
   <i key="741d94e6-5e21-4fab-9f13-efdfe152a7b6">
    Fish Police
   </i>
   series, which was performing well at the time.
   Purcell agreed, and wrote his first feature length comic using the characters of Sam and Max. The 32-page comic was published by Fishwrap Productions in 1987.
   The comic contained two
   <i key="d25a3920-3a74-4bc9-90db-bd49ba0fea3f">
    Sam &amp; Max
   </i>
   stories, "Monkeys Violating the Heavenly Temple"—a name that Purcell found on a firework and thought was appropriate—
   and "Night of the Gilded Heron-Shark". Purcell published a further story, "Night of the Cringing Wildebeest", in a 1987 issue of
   <i key="dd39b49a-88eb-4e98-8c1f-52d6013d3dd6">
    Critters
   </i>
   . These three stories established the basics for Purcell's future work with the characters.

   In
   1988
   , Purcell was hired by LucasArts, then known as Lucasfilm Games, as an animator, but was subsequently laid off when the project he was working on was canceled.
   However, he was rehired to produce artwork for the graphic adventure game

   In addition, Purcell worked with animation in several LucasArts adventure games. During this time, Purcell published three more

   </i>
   .
   The characters eventually became involved as training material for LucasArts programmers working with SCUMM, the core game engine used by LucasArts adventure games; Purcell created versions of Sam and Max in their office for new programmers under Ron Gilbert to practice on.
   References to the characters were occasionally made in unrelated LucasArts adventure games, usually in the form of a clandestine appearance in backgrounds. In
   1992
   , Purcell wrote the six-issue 1992 comic book series

   Purcell's work on the new game series encompassed design and writing, as well as the design of the game's cover artwork; however, Purcell described his work as "minimal" due to the effectiveness of the team.
   At the same time, Purcell began a

   Purcell grew up in California, where he still resides. In a
   2000
   interview, Purcell stated that he had been drawing all his life, and still possesses drawings from when he was three years old.
   Purcell describes himself as an "average" student at school, but retrospectively wishes that he had tried harder at some classes, noting that his line of creative work depends entirely on things one learns.
   After studying film-making courses at junior college, Purcell enrolled in the California College of Arts and Crafts to read fine art, for which he now holds a bachelor's degree in. While at the college, Purcell befriended Mike Mignola, and later became a friend of Art Adams.
   Purcell cites the Marx Brothers, Peter Sellers and Monty Python as among his interests, and states that he is inspired by "creative people who have made their seemingly most self-indulgent artistic whims into a career".
   In 1993, during the development of
   <i key="32519c2d-a340-4bc1-92f6-76e3a2486cff">
    Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road
   </i>
   , Purcell married fellow lead designer Collette Michaud; the wedding cake was topped with figurines of Sam and Max as a bride and groom.
   Purcell has two sons.

   The characters of Sam and Max were created in Purcell's youth; originally, Purcell's younger brother Dave came up with the idea of a dog and rabbit detective duo, and created several comics of his idea. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house, and Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form, deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock the way in which they had been drawn. Over time, this developed from Steve merely mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. Ultimately, in the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters, signing them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowing him to develop the characters in his own way.
   Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years.
   Purcell has an interest in rats, having kept one as a pet in his youth; rats commonly feature in his artistic work.
