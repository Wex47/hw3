   Since winning the Wings Around the Globe Rally in the previous film,
   Dusty Crophopper
   has a successful career as a racer. Unfortunately, his engine's gearbox becomes damaged due to too much over-revving. To make things worse, that type of gearbox is out of production and none are found anywhere, so Dusty is permanently replaced. Dissapointed with mechanic Dottie's newly installed warning light to keep his engine performance low to prevent further damage, Dusty goes on a defiant flight testing his limits. Unfortunately in doing so, he has a hard landing with engine trouble at
   Propwash Junction
   's airport, causing a fire.
  </p>
  <p key="6e7f8323-c1ef-4ec5-928a-98affb027421">
   The residents put out the fire with some difficulty, but the accident leads to a government inspector named Ryker closing the airport due to inadequate firefighting personnel. Aggrieved at his carelessness, Dusty offers to undergo training to be certified as a firefighter to meet the necessary regulations to reopen the airport. To that end, Dusty travels to Piston Peak National Park, where he meets a fire and rescue crew under the command of a helicopter named Blade Ranger. The leader of an efficient unit, Blade is initially unimpressed by the small newcomer, and Dusty's training proves to be a difficult challenge.
  </p>
  <p key="691d5017-5aeb-42c6-8afa-cc2a9dfc2738">
   Dusty's original undercarriage is replaced by two big scooping water tanks with retractable undercarriage wheels on their undersides. During training, Dusty learns that Blade was formerly an actor who played a police helicopter on the TV series

   . Later, Dusty is devastated by a call from his friends at Propwash Junction noting that all attempts at finding a replacement gearbox have failed and his racing career has still been taken away.

   Depressed, Dusty's education falters to Blade's frustration, and things come to a head when Dusty makes a forced landing in a river during a fire dispatch and is swept through the rapids with Blade trying to extract him. Eventually, the pair make it to land, and Dusty confesses his physical disability, to which Blade advises Dusty not to give up. They shelter in an abandoned mine while a fire passes. The situation is complicated in that Blade is also damaged, from protecting Dusty in the fire, and is temporarily grounded for repairs. While Blade is recuperating, Dusty learns that Blade's co-star from

   was killed during a stunt gone wrong on set that Blade was helpless to stop, so he decided to become a firefighter to save lives for real.

   Lightning in a thunderstorm over a forest near Piston Peak starts several spot fires which unite into a serious forest fire, and the team fight it and seem to have extinguished it. But during the grand reopening of a local lodge, visiting VIPs fly too low and make air eddies which blow embers about, creating a larger fire. The national park's superintendent Cad Spinner selfishly diverts all the water supply to his lodge's roof sprinklers to prevent the lodge from burning, and so prevents the firefighters from making fire retardant for their own duties. With only their pre-existing tank loads, the firefighters manage to help the evacuees escape the fire while Dusty is alerted that two elderly campers, named Harvey and Winnie, are trapped on a burning bridge deep in the fire zone. He races to the scene, and is forced to push his engine to the maximum to climb vertically up a waterfall to refill his water tanks to drop water to save the campers, as the only other surface water near is a river too shallow and twisty and rocky for him to scoop from. Meanwhile, Blade shows up and assists the campers. Dusty successfully drops water and extinguishes the fire, but his overstressed gearbox fails completely, and he crashes.
  </p>
  <p key="83d638ed-0e67-4349-a718-43886fe67f85">
   Unconscious, Dusty is airlifted back to base, where he wakes up five days later to learn that not only has his structure been fully repaired, but the base mechanic has built a superior custom refurbished gearbox for his engine to allow full performance again. Impressed at Dusty's skill and heroism, Blade certifies him a firefighter. Propwash Junction is reopened with Dusty assuming his duty as a firefighter, celebrated with an aerial show with his new colleagues from Piston Peak.

  <p key="3c05aa1a-eec9-4756-86d9-70c0003eb0ed">
   During the end credits, it is shown that Cad's misconduct resulted in him being demoted and reassigned as a park ranger in Death Valley.

   is a crop duster, and a famous air racing champion from Propwash Junction, Minnesota.
  </p>
  <p key="99fb9dc4-5c1a-47e1-9286-03b732e61997">
   When world-famous air racer Dusty Crophopper returns to hometown Propwash Junction after another victorious racing season, the former crop duster revels in his new career success until a fateful training run changes his course with a career-ending injury. Forced to shift gears, Dusty decides to train with the Aerial Fire Fighters at Piston Peak Air Attack Base as a Single Engine Air Tanker (SEAT). The heroic, often life-threatening efforts involved are admirable—but seemingly impossible to master—particularly if you're a crop duster-turned-racer with an injury that can't be ignored.

   , Dusty, at first, races around the world again with most of the racers from the Wings Around the Globe, and was going to perform at Propwash Junction's annual Corn Festival. However, while he was doing a training run with Skipper, his engine sputtered, causing him to fall into a spin before luckily regaining control. Skipper guides him back to the town for an emergency landing, and Dottie finds out that his gearbox became damaged due to too much over-revving. To make things worse, that type is out of production, meaning that Dusty can't race anymore.
  </p>
  <p key="08eef059-b64d-41d9-bdc0-8a67055c7773">
   To prevent him from crashing, Dottie installs a warning light on his panel that will go off if he redlines, meaning he has to slow down. While at the Honkers bar, Chug and Sparky tell Dusty that they will try to find a new gearbox for him, though Leadbottom offered Dusty to go back to his job of crop dusting, to which Skipper, Chug and Sparky do not agree, saying that Dusty will be back to racing soon.
  </p>
  <p key="b5675225-91b6-48d7-89ba-9f4de0af65bd">
   However, when none of them were looking, Dusty goes on a defiant flight testing his limits. However, he has a hard landing with engine trouble at Propwash Junction's airport, causing a fire at Chug and Dottie's Fill n' Fly. Mayday, the town's fire truck, tries to put it out with his hose, but later finds out that it is leaking. Dusty, Chug, Mayday and Skipper then worked together to topple the water tower and put the fire out. However, the next day, a government inspector named Ryker closes the airport until a second firefighter is hired, which means that no planes can fly to Propwash Junction to attend the Corn Festival.
  </p>
  <p key="ebb06b46-988a-48f5-98de-694d75a18afe">
   Mayday later explains to Dusty about aerial firefighters, who drop water instead of dusting crops like Dusty used to. This gives Dusty the idea of becoming Propwash Junction's second firefighter, and he travels to Piston Peak National Park so to be certified by Mayday's old friend Blade Ranger.
  </p>
  <p key="e4318474-d6c8-4927-ac27-b54b429ac4fe">
   When he got to Piston Peak, he met his favorite fan Dipper, a heavy-lift helicopter called Windlifter, and the ex-military transport heavy plane Cabbie. After meeting them, an emergency horn blares, alerting them that there is a wildfire to fight. Dusty got so interested, that he went along with the planes.
  </p>
  <p key="b5c27827-8a93-4ca0-b7a3-6d93dba70db7">
   As the team arrive at the scene of the wildfire, Blade was already on the scene, which he, Dipper and Windlifter dropped fire retardant while the Smokejumpers parachute out of Cabbie and dig a fire line so that the fire won't spread. When Dusty arrives, Blade tells him to get out of the airspace, before he flies through the retardant.
  </p>
  <p key="69bb48e5-2da7-426a-99b8-6657cd3c2d0b">
   After the fire was put out, Maru, the firefighters' mechanic, washes the retardant off Dusty, before Blade orders him to replace Dusty's original undercarriage with two pontoons. Blade then trains Dusty, starting with scooping water to fill his tank. However, Dusty almost collides into the trees. Next, Blade tells Dusty about the different types of fire attacks along with that all aircraft must be on the ground exactly thirty minutes after sunset, and then orders him to fly under a bridge and pull straight up in front of a waterfall, but Dusty backs off due to realizing that he has go to max speed with his current gearbox. However, Blade warns Dusty that he won't get certified if the course is not completed. Later, Blade sets up some flaming barrels on the runway. Dusty flies over them, and tries to douse them with retardant while being coached by Blade on the radio. After days of training, Dusty's friends in Propwash Junction tell him that they have found a new gearbox which will arrive in a few days.

Blade orders Dipper to help them, but Dusty goes in and releases retardant over the trees for the Smokejumpers to proceed.

   That night, Dusty goes to Cad's party along with Dipper, Windlifter and Maru. Dusty saw all kinds of fun activities, and sees André, the concierge, talking to a married couple. Suddenly, Cad saw Dusty, and told him that he will soon get a promotion from the Secretary of the Interior. While there, Dusty meets a sweet old RV couple called Harvey and Winnie, who are celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary by going to the part of the park where they had their first kiss.

   The next morning, Dusty is devastated by a call from his friends at Propwash Junction, noting that all attempts at finding a replacement gearbox have failed and that his racing career is over. Maru then alerts Dusty that there are two fires heading towards the Fusel Lodge after visiting VIPs flew too low during the grand reopening of the Grand Fusel Lodge and made air eddies which blew embers about. Soon, Dusty and the firefighters arrive at the scene, where Blade tells Dusty to drop half of his retardant on the fire so that the rest is saved for the other fire. However, Dusty gets distracted by his bad news, and releases all of the retardant. Blade orders Dusty to return to the base, but Dusty doesn't listen as he goes to reload at the lake. However, the strong currents pull him down the rapids and towards a waterfall. As Dusty gets his engine clear, Blade tells him to redline so that he can take off before the waterfall. However, Dusty pulls back as the warning light goes off, and falls over the waterfall before getting grabbed by Blade's hoist, taking all of Blade's strength to swing Dusty to the ground safely.

   As the fire closes in, Dusty and Blade head for the safety of an abandoned mine. Dusty, however, refuses to go in it, saying that they will suffocate, but Blade explains that it is their only chance and that they will let the fire burn over. Dusty decides to outrun the fire, but Blade tells him that he won't be able to. Dusty then chooses to find his way out of the fire, but Blade asks why he would. Dusty replies that he didn't want to push his engine. Blade then gets angry that Dusty would not listen to his orders. Dusty then chooses to give up firefighting, to which Blade then tells him to go back to racing, and Dusty finally explains about his broken gearbox. Blade then advises him not to give up, reminding him of all the lives he could save, and the two hurried into the mine.

Eventually, the fire burns past, but Blade was too hurt to fly. Dusty calls for Windlifter to carry Blade, hoping that Maru would repair him.

   Despite the rule of not going out at night, the firefighters eventually decide to fight the fire with Windlifter in command. Maru tried to fill Dusty, Dipper and Windlifter with fire retardant, but finds that the hoses are dry due to the water switched by Cad to his lodge. They were told by Windlifter that they only have what is left in their tanks, and that they would have to make it count.

Then the firefighters get alerted by their informant Patch that Harvey and Winnie are trapped on a burning bridge deep in the fire zone. Dusty races to the scene, and tries to refill his water tanks from the river, but it was too shallow and twisty and rocky for him to scoop from. He is forced to push his engine to the maximum to climb vertically up the falls to scoop some of its water. Meanwhile, Blade, who got repaired, shows up and holds the collapsing bridge. Dusty successfully drops water and extinguishes the fire so the RVs rush to safety, but his overstressed gearbox fails completely, and he crashes into the forest.

   Unconscious, Dusty is airlifted back to base, where he wakes up five days later to learn that not only has his structure been fully repaired, but Maru has built a superior custom refurbished gearbox for his engine to allow full performance again. He also discovered that the new superintendent was Ol' Jammer, to which he asked what happen to Cad. It was discovered that Cad got fired by the Secretary of the Interior for not caring about the park, but just about the lodge. Impressed at Dusty's skill and heroism, Blade certifies him a firefighter. Propwash Junction is reopened with Dusty assuming his duty as a firefighter, celebrated with an aerial show starring his new colleagues from Piston Peak.

Blade, at first, doesn't like Dusty Crophopper, since he is not meant to be a firefighter, but is sent there because his damaged gearbox has prevented him from racing. However, during the scooping of water for retardant, Dusty ignores Blade's warning about flying too low, resulting in them both being swept down a river, off a waterfall, and being trapped inside a mine to escape the worsening fire. Blade's engine is severely damaged by the heat, and he is sent back to his hanger to recover while Windlifter is temporarily made the new chief. However, when the fire traps the tourists at the main exit along with Harvey and Winnie at Augerin Canyon's burning bridge, Dusty and the other firefighters have their water supply cut off, and simply have to use the remaining water for retardant, which is not enough to put out the fire. Fortunately, Blade recovers just in time to save the two RVs by holding them when the bridge was starting to collapse, while Dusty reluctantly goes up the waterfall at max speed to scoop up water and put the flames on the bridge out, letting Harvey and Winnie drive to safety, but also making his gearbox fail completely, causing him to crash. After Dusty is fixed, Blade certifies him as a firefighter, and heads to Propwash Junction along with the other firefighters to celebrate Dusty's bravery.

The American Indian's wisdom is vast—he's chock full of fire folklore, and his connection to nature allows him to sense fires before they're even spotted. The former lumberjack became a firefighter to help others, and no mission is too big for Windlifter.

   , Windlifter is first seen flexing on piles of logs when Dusty Crophopper arrives in Piston Peak National Park. Later, he and the Smokejumpers watch Dusty and Lil' Dipper's discussion. After Dynamite tells Dusty that Blade is busy checking on spot fires, Windlifter tells the story of a person called Haokah by the Lakota who beats his drums, with the cause of a fire being lightning and thunder from the drumbeats. With Dusty confused, Dipper tells Windlifter to stop scaring Dusty.

   While the firefighters prepare to fight a wildfire in the forest, Maru gives Windlifter his tank of fire retardant before he takes off. After Dipper pours retardant over one part of the fire, Blade Ranger tells Windlifter that he is clear to maneuver, to which he then pours his retardant onto another part of the fire.

   Upon the arrival of Cad Spinner, the park's superintendent, Windlifter explains to Dusty that Cad waves himself daily, and watches as Blade and Cad argue about putting a lot of happy campers into the Grand Fusel Lodge and protecting the humanity. After Cad leaves the base referring to Blade as "Blazin' Blade", Windlifter informs Dusty, when he gets shushed by Dipper on mentioning Blade's nickname, to meet at the main hangar that night and not tell anyone, especially Blade, what they are doing. On that night, Windlifter, Cabbie, Dipper, Dusty and the Smokejumpers watch an episode of

   ), which shows that Blade used to be a TV star who fought crimes with Nick Loopin' Lopez. Windlifter seems to dislike the show, as saying that he is with Cabbie stating that "this show stinks."
  </p>
  <p key="fdb60266-a308-4453-8551-69e5c26cfdb9">
   When Blade refused to let Dusty fight a few spot fires caused by a thunderstorm while not certified, Windlifter explained that every plane they have will be needed, to which Blade eventually agreed. When Dusty pours his fire retardant too high above one of the fires, Blade orders Windlifter to finish off the ridge.
  </p>
  <p key="69f387ed-27a6-4e12-bd96-2401b100869c">
   After extinguishing the fires, Windlifter and the rest of the team, excluding the Smokejumpers, head back to the base. On that night, Windlifter, Dusty, Dipper and Maru go to the Grand Fusel Lodge's grand reopening party. When Maru explained that he had to get normal coffee, which wasn't available at the lodge, Windlifter tries on a pair of sunglasses, and asks Maru what he thinks, to which Maru answers that "
   <i key="a269a315-4fd1-4e52-a1d9-fb94ecb65741">
    you look good.
   </i>
   "

  <p key="cfa04817-19c7-46ed-a392-fcd2cf970174">
   Windlifter later joins Maru, Dusty and Dipper outside with Harvey and Winnie, an RV couple planning to visit the place of the park where they had their first kiss. When Dipper explains about the firefighting job being a second career to the team, she mentions that Windlifter used to be a lumberjack. Noticing that Windlifter hadn't spoke much, Harvey asks him if he wants a toast, to which Dipper explains that he is not much for speeches. Windlifter then tells the story of a coyote who traveled to a mountain and climbed it to find a tame fire and bring it down to the first vehicles (car equivalent of animals), but was unable to prevent his tires (feet) from getting burnt. Upon seeing them blackened, he ate them when he thought that they were his favorite snack, but also knowing that they were still full of life, and lets go of the old and renews himself like fire renewing the Earth. After hearing it, Dusty says that he was up to the bit where the coyote ate his tires, while Maru congratulates Windlifter on giving the best toast ever.

  <p key="1b0ff5d2-821f-4967-b4e3-c1efa63eff5b">
   The next day, the firefighters get the news of two wildfires caused by Cad's visiting VIPs flying too low over the burnt area the previous night and making air eddies which blew embers about. As Windlifter, Blade, Dusty and Dipper fly toward the fires, Blade splits the group into two, with Windlifter joining Dipper to fight the Coil Springs fire while Blade and Dusty take the Whitewall Rapids fire.
  </p>
  <p key="0e0a217e-0e6f-4ed9-a3fb-47f820e56a30">
   Later, Patch, the firefighters' informant, gets Windlifter to lift Blade back to the base after he got damaged from protecting Dusty in the fire while sheltering in an abandoned mine. While Blade was being fixed, Windlifter was put into command. When they hear the news of the fire blocking the main exit to the escaping tourists, they eventually agree to go out and save the tourists. However, when the water supply that makes retardant runs out due to Cad selfishly diverting it to his lodge's roof sprinklers, Windlifter tells the team to make it count with what is left in their tanks.
  </p>
  <p key="d84606a3-21f8-407c-a009-0fab32f66826">
   Eventually, the team makes it through the fire towards the main exit, where Windlifter and Dipper put out the fire on the trees blocking the road, while Dusty puts out the fire on the trees over the railroad tracks, and the Smokejumpers parachute out of Cabbie to remove the debris off the road. Windlifter then receives a call from Patch that Harvey and Winnie are trapped on a burning bridge in Augerin Canyon. He was reluctant at first to let Dusty save them due to having no retardant, but finally agreed when Dusty explained about filling up from the river leading to the canyon.
  </p>
  <p key="b1692717-dd71-45c4-b1e7-1020abe60ff3">
   The next day, Blade (who got fixed in time to help Harvey and Winnie) and Windlifter fly back to the base while carrying Dusty, who crashed in the forest after his busted gearbox gives out due to redlining up the waterfall to scoop water when the river was too shallow, twisty and rocky. He watches with the rest of the team as Maru tries to fix Dusty, who regains consciousness five days later. Windlifter then asks Maru if he told Dusty which parts he fixed, to which Maru explained that he fixed Dusty's damage along with giving him a new gearbox. Windlifter and the rest of the team travel to Propwash Junction to celebrate Dusty's bravery, along with him being certified by Blade to re-open the town's airport for the Corn Festival, and takes part in an aerial show with the team.

He, Chug, Dusty and Skipper work together to topple the water tower and put the fire out, but a government inspector named Ryker closes the airport the next day until Mayday has a second firefighter hired, putting the annual Corn Festival under threat due to that no plane will be able to fly to Propwash Junction.

   Park superintendent Cad Spinner is a luxury Sport Utility Vehicle who’s better suited for a country club than the country. Self-centered and passionate about profits, Cad diverts a big chunk of the firefighters’ budget to his lodge restoration project. Though completely turned off by dirt, Cad’s not opposed to playing dirty to get his way.

   Later, he comes to the firefighters' base to tell Blade Ranger that one of his staff members had soaked fire retardant on two campers and their campfire, which Dusty, who was responsible for it as he didn't know, apologizes, but Blade tells Cad that the team needs to train. However, Cad got excited as soon as he saw Dusty, mistaking him for
   Ripslinger
   at first, and tells him that he is invited to the grand reopening party at his lodge the next day, along with that the Secretary of the Interior would be coming. He explains to Blade that a big party at his lodge would make for happy campers rather than spilling mud on people, but Blade tells him that he packs too many happy campers in the park and lodge. Cad tells him that he has Pulaski, a structural fire engine, to protect the lodge, to which Blade responds that it is all about protecting the humanity, not just the lodge. As Blade continues talking, Lil' Dipper whispers to Dusty that Cad got the park service to save 80 percent of their budget to his lodge restoration project. As he leaves, he tells Blade that "Dusty Cropslinger's even more famous than you, Blazin' Blade!" According to Windlifter, he waxes himself daily.

  <p key="330b6686-58d9-4ed3-8b78-7a827b3f3521">
   At the party, he greets the Secretary, who later asks how the park's wildlife population is. Cad replies that there will be plenty of party animals if he comes to the party night, and later stated Ol' Jammer as a "bumper kisser." Later, he told Dusty that he might get a promotion, but in the middle of the talk, he went to talk to another famous guy named Boat Reynolds.
  </p>
  <p key="5ec44771-9c8c-4d2c-8424-6829e3fea61f">
   The next day, while the firefighters are fighting a large forest fire which was caused when Cad's visiting VIPs flew too low and made air eddies that blew embers about, Blade tells Maru, the firefighers' mechanic, to report Cad that the fire is about four hours away from the lodge and that the tourists will need to evacuate. However, Cad refuses to get everyone out of the lodge, saying that he won't evacuate at that moment since being the superintendent for five years.
  </p>
  <p key="db802ff9-d65f-4f10-9df2-e03067b7636e">
   Outside, when Cad gives a speech to the tourists and the Secretary about the grand reopening of the lodge, André, the lodge's concierge was talking to Pulaski about a large forest fire coming towards the lodge after Cad's visiting VIPs flew too low and made air eddies which blew embers about. Cad overhears them, pauses his speech, and argues with Pulaski on giving the speech, and even says that he's been saying the same thing when Pulaski keeps correcting him upon mispronouncing his name. Pulaski explains to Cad that the fire is getting closer to the lodge. André suggests to Cad that they should turn on the roof sprinklers, and Pulaski and Ol' Jammer tell Cad that they need to evacuate. After the Secretary tells Cad to let them see the sign, André, Pulaski and Jammer argue that the fire will get worse, before Cad angrily insults them by saying that André is a glorified bellboy, Pulaski is an overpriced sprinkler, and Jammer is old and has a dumb hat, and says that he is the park superintendent and getting the moment of reopening his lodge, before coming back to the crowd, and revealing the lodge's sign before one of the tourists screams. Cad, at first, thought that they were being rude until they mention the fire, which Cad then notices, and the tourists all drive away. As the guests sleeping inside the lodge exit, Cad tells them to calm down, saying that it is only a small fire, and that they should come back the following year.
  </p>
  <p key="f8c36653-bcc8-4c21-8568-82a6a1e6787b">
   As the fire got close to the lodge, Cad was trying to get some water to the lodge's roof sprinklers. He orders André to switch the main water supply to them, but André explains that the firefighters need it to make their fire retardant. However, Cad refuses to listen, stating that he doesn't care, and switches the water supply himself, while André leaves with his luggage.
  </p>
  <p key="950deb20-2985-4cce-9655-8fdf78fc87ef">
   After Dusty got fixed by Maru, he was informed that Jammer had become the superintendent after Cad got fired by the Secretary for not caring about the park, but just about the lodge. In the end credits, it is shown that he now works as a park ranger in Death Valley.

   , Pulaski works as a firefighter to protect Piston Peak National Park from fires, having been put under charge by Cad Spinner to protect the Grand Fusel Lodge. He first appears at the lodge's grand reopening party, telling Cad and the Secretary of the Interior that the fire in Upper Whitewall Falls has been put out.

  <p key="1fb0db59-3f5e-4142-9c93-505ca403037e">
   The next day, he is with his pitty Rake after getting a cup of coffee, when they overhear Cad arguing with Maru on getting the tourists to evacuate due to a wildfire heading toward the lodge. As Cad gives a speech to the tourists and the Secretary outside the lodge, Pulaski tells André, the lodge's concierge, that the tourists' lives are at risk. Overhearing the two, Cad pauses the speech and informs Pulaski that he is trying to give a speech, before Pulaski argues with him on mispronouncing his name. Immediately, he tells Cad that the fire is getting closer, and that the tourists need to leave. However, Cad does not listen when the Secretary asks him to show them the plaque, which makes Pulaski and Ol' Jammer unhappy with Cad's selfishness. They both argue that it will get worse if they wait longer for the lodge to be unveiled, before Cad shuts them up and gives them insults, with Pulaski being called an "overpriced sprinkler", and angrily informs that he is waiting to unveil his lodge. Going back to his original spot, Cad reveals the plaque, before the tourists then notice the fire and panic.

   As Jammer and the Secretary help the road vehicles to evacuate, Pulaski helps the planes to take off, alerting them to avoid the smoke and stay above the walls of the canyon. As a biplane struggles to get her engine to start, another plane impatiently drives in front in her, before Pulaski warns him not to make cutsies, otherwise he would upset Rake. Obeying what Pulaski said, the plane then moves back as the biplane is finally able to take off, with Pulaski again informing his alert about keeping away from the smoke.

   As the cars make their way through the exit, Pulaski uses his hose to shoot water at the fires, but the wind shifts, causing some sparks to ignite a building on the exit. Pulaski then shoots some water at it, but his hose then gets damaged by a fallen tree, leaving the exit blocked by the fire, which there is unfortunately no other way out of the park. Soon, the Air Attack team arrive, put out the fire and remove the debris, making the tourists able to proceed.

   Five days later, Pulaski arrives at the firefighters' base with Jammer, André, and Rake, feeling happy that Dusty Crophopper is alive after becoming unconscious from having an accident. When Dusty notices that Jammer is now the superintendent of Piston Peak, Pulaski explains to him that the Secretary had put Jammer in charge after firing Cad following his actions of diverting the main water line to his lodge's roof sprinklers. He then travels with Rake and most of the Piston Peak crew to Dusty's hometown Propwash Junction to hear from Ryker that the town's airport is reopened with Dusty becoming a firefighter, before attending at the Corn Festival to watch Dusty and the Air Attack team take part.

After the Secretary tells Cad to let them see the plaque, André, Pulaski and Jammer argue that the fire will get worse, before Cad angrily insults them by saying that André is a glorified bell boy, Pulaski is an overpriced sprinkler, and Jammer is old and has a dumb hat, and says that he is the park superintendent and getting the moment of reopening his lodge, before coming back to the crowd, and revealing the lodge's plaque before the tourists notice the fire and drive away. André alerts the tourists staying in the lodge that they need to evacuate and must not panic. He gets some of the tourists onto Muir, the steam train, but when the train did not have space for the rest of the tourists, he tells them to follow a staff member to the main road exit.

   He later argued with Cad, who was trying to get some water to the lodge's roof sprinklers. Cad tells him to switch the main water line to them, but André explains that the firefighters need it to make their fire retardant. However, Cad refuses to listen, stating that he doesn't care, and switches the water supply himself, while André leaves with his luggage, showing that he stopped working for Cad.

   At the end, he arrives at the firefighters' base along with Pulaski, his pitty Rake, and Ol' Jammer after Dusty gets fixed by Maru, informing him that Jammer was made the superintendent after Cad got fired for caring about only the lodge.

   <i key="db0c56b0-898f-4765-ab62-85b83772220f">
    We've been working on this film for nearly four years.
   </i>
   " The filmmakers researched the world of air-attack teams and smokejumpers by working with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and sent a crew to the US Forest Services' annual training exercises for smokejumpers. Gannaway explained "
   <i key="de037512-7918-4785-ad8c-4bfccb2c9a0f">
    We actually hooked cameras onto their helmets and had them drop out of the airplane so we could catch it on film.
   </i>
   " Nearly a year of research was done before the filmmakers started work on the story. The idea of Dusty becoming a fire and rescue plane was based on reality. Gannaway stated that during their research, they discovered that in
   1955
   , crop dusters were among the first planes to be used in aerial fire-fighting, "
   <i key="0f655182-b07a-436f-bcbe-c48f0e91deaa">
    There was a group of cropdusters who reworked their planes so they could drop water.
   </i>
   " Gannaway also noted that in the first film "
   <i key="0b3d8edc-af26-494e-b511-26b2c4b871ad">
    Dusty is doing things to his engine that should not be done to it—he is stressing the engine out and causing severe damage. It's great that the first movie teed this up without intending to. We just built on it, and the results were remarkable.
   </i>
   " Producer Ferrell Barron stated "
   <i key="efed64e3-cd58-4517-a411-1657dacba8b3">
    I think we've all experienced some kind of loss at some point in our lives—an end of an era, a lost love, a failed career. We've all had to recalibrate. In Planes: Fire &amp; Rescue, Dusty can't go back to being a crop duster, he left that behind. He has to move forward.

   A pre-release screening of the film was conducted at the 2014 National Native Media Conference, where screenwriter Jeffrey M. Howard and art director Toby Wilson joined actor Wes Studi in Q &amp; A to discuss the Native American themes in the film.

It almost starts getting into this thing where we fall in love with these plane characters, we want to see more and more stories with them.
