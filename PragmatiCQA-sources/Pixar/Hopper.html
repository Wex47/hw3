   "Tough, mean Hopper leads through fear. Cruel, heartless, and absolutely ruthless, he doesn't even hesitate to bury his own followers in a grain avalanche. With a thick exoskeleton that cracks and rattles like armor, and spiny legs and feet, Hopper towers over the ants looking like their worst nightmare. However, Hopper has a flaw: He believes he is smarter than anyone else. When

   During Hopper's first visit to the colony, the gang finds the food supply ruined, so he throws the blame on the ants and demands them to gather double the amount he has initially requested by the next season.

   . Hopper angrily takes Dot hostage again. Furious and embarrassed, he interrogates the ants, including
   Princess Atta
   , to find out who is responsible for the ruse. Flik defensively orders Hopper to leave Atta, Dot, and Dot's friends alone and then confesses that the bird was his idea. Hopper signals Thumper to beat up Flik. After five kicks, Hopper signals him to stop. He then signals Thumper to give Flik one last kick. Hopper then declares how dangerous ideas can be and that ants are mindless, soil-shoving losers, put on this earth to serve the grasshoppers. But then, a black-eyed Flik manages to stand up to his feet and revolt against Hopper, revealing that ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers and are strong in number. Angered by Flik's defiance, Hopper advances toward Flik and knocks him to the ground. Before Hopper can execute Flik, he is stopped by Atta.

   Inspired by Flik's speech, the entire colony of ants stands up against the grasshoppers. As the colony charges towards Hopper's gang, they abandon their leader and flee, leaving Hopper to be seized by the ants and trapped in a circus cannon, right at the time when a thunderstorm starts. Hopper then sees his chance to escape and shoots himself out of the cannon towards Flik, whom he takes hostage as he flies away with him in revenge for being humiliated.

   The circus bugs chase after them to try to save Flik, but they only succeed in pulling off one of Hopper's antennae and Hopper proceeds to tow Flik away to his doom. However, Atta intervenes and swipes Flik away from him. Hopper chases after the two across the stream. He corners Flik near a bird's nest, strangles him, and declares how so much time has been wasted by Flik's tricks and that he will rally more grasshoppers and return next season. A bird pops out from the nest, but Hopper, believing the bird to be another one of Flik's tricks, taunts the bird until it shrieks at him. Now realizing that

   Manipulative, ruthless and violent, but also devious, Hopper thinks nothing of slaughtering ants, who he considers lower than dirt. His manner of speaking to
   Princess Atta
   is reminiscent of an abusive boyfriend ridiculing his frightened girlfriend, and his manner of confronting
   Flik
   is reminiscent of an arrogant and overly prideful leader and his desperate and clumsy rival. However, he is somewhat compassionate as seen when he gives the ants a second chance at providing food after they fail miserably. He also roughs
   his gang members
   up, and even presumably slaughters
   two of them
   to keep control of his gang. He dislikes being thought of as weak in any way.
  </p>
  <p key="5adf7a05-c2eb-4c88-9414-ebe40be9404b">
   Hopper is also briefly depicted as a very agitated character. Indeed, during the Mexican bar scene, he expresses his gang the necessity of getting respect and obedience from the ants because they are far more numerous than them. He explains one rebel ant is enough to cause the entire colony's mutiny (which, ironically, will take place at the end of the movie). It must reveal a huge fear toward ants, hidden by his heartless and tyrannical manners toward ants and even his troops.
  </p>
  <p key="4468d9fc-d020-4ba0-a52c-117bdd22f45e">
   In any case, Hopper sees mercy and compassion as weaknesses and relies mostly on fear to maintain control over both his gang and the ants.
