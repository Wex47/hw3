   Mater is a brown, former baby blue, 1955 Haulital Hook'em and
   Lightning McQueen
   's best friend. One of his favorite activities is to go Tractor Tipping at night, as it's his favorite hobby. Mater's catchphrases are "Dad gum!", "If I'm lyin', I'm cryin'!", and "Git-R-Done!" (the last one being his
   voice actor
   's signature phrase).
  </p>
  <p key="be6a23c0-c2b4-49d4-9b7a-de7016661ba3">
   Mater is completely unique. He is a buck-toothed tow truck that bucks every trend and certainly does not tow the line. Although he is perhaps not the clearest vehicle in
   Radiator Springs
   , Mater has a wicked sense of humor and an even bigger sense of fun. If any car spends time with the tow truck, he/she will soon find him/herself  hooked, whether he is scaring tractors, driving backwards at incredible speed, or teasing Lightning McQueen about being keen on
   Sally
   . Very popular with the residents of Radiator Springs, Mater is always there to help his friends and pull them through any crisis.
  </p>
  <p key="b4bd79d7-36c1-4745-8dd9-dbf8fe268c9d">
   Once Mater was a young, shiny blue tow truck, but these days he could do with a generous helping of
   Rust-eze
   and a fresh coat of paint. One would have to peer closely to see his original colors.
  </p>
  <p key="dc738818-fe95-4bc3-8faf-378e2f468f74">
   Mater is proud of his business,
   Tow Mater Towing &amp; Salvage
   . In addition to his towrope being in demand, he manages the local car impound lot.

   "Mater's lived in
   Radiator Springs

   "Mater's a good ol' boy with a big heart and the only tow truck in Radiator Springs. He runs
   Tow Mater Towing &amp; Salvage
   and manages the
   local impound lot
   . Though a little rusty, he has the quickest towrope in
   Carburetor County
   and is always the first to lend a helping hand. Mater sees the bright side of any situation. He's the heart and soul of Radiator Springs, and he doesn't have a mean bolt in his chassis."

   Mater speaks with a somewhat high-pitched thick rural Southern accent, has a whistle dry lisp to his voice, and frequently misspells words. He is very optimistic and often at times forgetful. He has got the biggest heart, and is sweet to a fault. He also has true unconditional or agape love for others, and just needs true friendship from other people. He can be extremely scared or skittish at times because of his sensitive nature, and from being constantly and harshly abused by Bubba in his past.
  </p>
  <p key="ace81147-44aa-4085-913f-a6ee5210b98b">
   Although he may seem silly and dim-witted, he has a vast encyclopedic knowledge of automobiles, engines and towing, and is a fiercely loyal friend to anyone who is willing to give him a chance at true friendship. He unknowingly bestows wisdom upon others at times. He is also beyond funny without realizing it. He also likes to joke about different things, like saying Sally is his fiancée, when she is really not. Although he is not the smartest car in Radiator Springs, he makes up for it for his extreme heart and loyalty. He has got the biggest heart more than anyone in town. He is extremely friendly, especially towards Holley Shiftwell, Lightning McQueen and Sally Carrera.

   Mater runs Tow Mater Towing &amp; Salvage. Mater is one of the first to befriend and support Lightning throughout his adventure in Radiator Springs. During the movie, Mater shows Lightning how to do
   Tractor Tippin'

   Chick Hicks'
   dirty racing in the
   Piston Cup
   race. In the end, Lightning gives Mater an opportunity to fly in a

   Mater is also capable of racing, as well as being the (self-proclaimed) world's best backwards driver. He attributes his skill to his rear-view mirrors and his own philosophy: "Don't need to know where I'm going, just need to know where I've been."

   One night, Mater plays a series of scary yet harmless pranks on his friends until a blue light begins to haunt him. Mater's final prank is his most successful: Lightning sees a tow hook hanging from behind a stack of oil cans and, assuming that Mater is hiding behind it, approaches to foil the prank. Mater then jumps off of the roof of
   Flo
   's
   café
   , screaming behind Lightning, who then is startled and knocks over the pile of cans, revealing that the hook was actually from the sign of Mater's place of business, thus a decoy. Everyone starts to laugh at Lightning for falling for such a trick, and Mater says that Lightning looks like he's seen "the
   Ghostlight
   ".

  <p key="ee98a5bc-5b4f-4b9a-840e-3addf5d8f68d">
   Sheriff
   tells Mater not to mock the Ghostlight, a character of urban legend amongst the cars. The Ghostlight is a glowing orb of blue, translucent light that haunts Radiator Springs, and hates nothing more than the sound of clanking metal -- a sound frequently made by Mater's rickety shell. Sheriff continues to tell the story of a young couple lost in the area, whose only remains were "two out-of-state license plates". He then concludes with an overly cheerful "Well, g'night!". The population of Radiator Springs then leaves within seconds, leaving a very nervous Mater all by himself in the dark.

   As he reaches his garage, he is frightened by what he thought was a monster, but just a couple of junk put together. He then loses his only headlight as he enters his garage. He is then frightened by a "lightning bug" (
   a tiny flying Volkswagen Beetle
   with bright headlights). As he relaxes, a bright blue glow suddenly appears behind Mater and he goes into a blind panic, driving around in a frenzy, first going along the main road, then going through the
   tractor field
   (past
   Frank
   ), then around
   Willy's Butte
   , and doing a lock-strafe move after that, until he is exhausted. However, the Ghostlight was revealed to be a glowing blue lantern to Mater's towing cable hung up by Lightning and
   Guido
   .
  </p>
  <p key="ac8fea28-5865-42ec-911e-0dbf628d7222">
   The short ends with Mater finally collapsing on the road with the rest of the folks surrounding him, revealing the joke to him as retribution for the pranks he did to them. The credits roll and after them, there is a closing shot where the frightened Mater finds he has a huge construction vehicle behind him, snarling and carrying the license plate "Banshee." However, Mater doesn't realize who it is and warns it of the
   Screamin' Banshee
   before driving off, bidding the Banshee good night.

  <p key="cc697246-2403-4494-8000-bd59523b1b73">
   Each tale begins with Mater telling a story of something he has done in the past (such as him once being a firefighter, a drift racer, a rockstar, an astronaut, etc.).

   In the story, Mater finds himself in an inescapable predicament. When Lightning questions Mater over whether the events in the story actually occurred, Mater responds, "Don't you remember? You was there, too!", in which Lightning sometimes responds with "What?" or "Huh?", and continues the story including Lightning's sudden participation.

   Mater returns as the protagonist.
  </p>
  <p key="b0c16f84-a26e-4e8b-8c74-64e61a175bae">
   In the now popular tourist destination of Radiator Springs, the rusty old tow truck Mater has a number of roles, including proprietor of Tow Mater Towing and Salvage, grand storyteller and the heart and soul of the town. But Mater’s favorite title is best friend to Lightning McQueen. Mater values each and every dent he’s earned on his escapades with Lightning over the years, and anxiously awaits further fun with his friend when Lightning returns with his latest Piston Cup.
  </p>
  <p key="88303c04-70c0-48c2-be4f-95e7183b1ade">
   Cheerful, honest and loyal to a fault, Mater rushes to his best friend’s defense when
   Francesco Bernoulli
   began insulting McQueen on live television. When Mater calls the
   Mel Dorado
   show to defend his friend's honor, the more Mater talked, the more Francesco mocked, which ultimately lands the off-duty Lightning in an international racing exhibition: the
   World Grand Prix
   . When Lightning invites Mater to come along as a member of his pit crew, Mater leaves Carburetor County for the first time ever(unless you count the time where he was in McQueen's pit crew in California).
  </p>
  <p key="af111eee-953c-45ff-957c-f54809f1ecf1">
   Not long after their arrival in
   Tokyo
   , Mater learns that the world outside of Radiator Springs is decidedly different and its newfangled ways may take some getting used to. While collecting drinks for McQueen, Mater mistakes wasabi for pistachio ice cream and takes an entire box-full, only to get a flavor blast from it. His mouth on fire, Mater desperately drove up the waterfall on stage where
   Miles Axlerod
   was introducing McQueen to wash out the taste. He then noticed an oil leak between him and Axlerod and everyone assumes Mater did it. Despite his protests that he

   leaks, McQueen sends him away to the bathroom to clean up.
  </p>
  <p key="78c88066-d1ad-424d-b194-8cb327e144f5">
   Entering the bathroom stall, Mater get comically tortured by a Japanese washing contraption, unaware of a fight between an
   American secret agent
   and two Lemon cars,
   Acer
   and
   Grem
   , outside. By the time he gets out, the American agent secretly slips a device underneath his bumper. The device's GPS results in British agent
   Holley Shiftwell
   mistaking Mater for a spy (based on his strange attitude). After answering her countersign correcting, Mater starts babbling on before mistakenly assuming that Holley wanted to ask him out on a date and agreed to meet the next day. He then returned to his friends to tell him of this development, but Guido doesn't believe him. He then tries calling out to Holley but she ignores him and drives away.
  </p>
  <p key="5eb38296-3e3f-4250-941d-9728ac312206">
   The next day, Mater advises McQueen during the race, enabling him to get ahead of Francesco. Unknown to Mater, the Lemons assumed he was a spy too and were covertly closing in on him. Holley taps into his headset, giving him directions to avoid the Lemons. Mater followed blindly, assuming he was being guided to his date. He later mishears Holley, turning towards a ruckus instead of away from it. He soon witnesses
   Finn McMissile
   fights off the Lemons, which he assumes to be a live karate demonstration. Finn then vanishes, while Holley tells Mater that it's too dangerous to rendezvous and promises to be in touch.
  </p>
  <p key="72d59b32-b0cb-48e8-8137-86fc5c68dd0d">
   Mater then returns to the pit, only to learn that while he was talking to Holley, McQueen was hearing him too, assuming he was shouting nonsense. He blames Mater "accidentally" messing up the race car's moves and causing him to lose the first race. Mater was hurt by his best friend's rejection and writes a farewell note to his friends before deciding to go home. At Tokyo airport, Finn disguises himself as airport security and lures Mater to a lounge, where he inquires which American intelligence agency he was affiliated with. Mater claimed to be "triple-A affiliated" and started boasting that he knew some karate. Finn then detects Acer and Grem closing in on them and drags Mater outside. Mater assumed he was getting first-class service and was completely oblivious to the danger.
  </p>
  <p key="9680534c-d9ca-4829-87cc-fe92b3261c67">
   Once aboard the spy jet
   Siddeley
   , Mater figures out that Finn and Holley are spies as they extract data from the device embedded on him, which had information on the Lemon boss, showing a picture of an engine. He identifies it as "the worst engine ever made" but had no clues as to the identity of the car it belonged to. However, he did point out that the mystery car made use of replacement parts that were factory original and wouldn't be found on open markets. Grateful for Mater's insight, Finn offered to set up an informal taskforce. Though reluctant, Mater agreed to help out the spies when Finn assured him that he would be helping him. Mater then tried pointing out that he's "just a tow truck" but Finn doesn't take him seriously.
  </p>
  <p key="463d393c-d59b-411c-b0c4-4869d4631c11">
   Mater joined Finn and Holley as they meet with Finn's black market contact,
   Tomber
   . Tomber informed them that the car to whom the engine belonged to only did business over the phone, buying numerous parts to maintain his engine, making Mater suspect that the mystery car was a Lemon. He explained the nature of Lemons to Finn and identified Gremlins, Pacers, Hugos and Trunkovs as Lemons. Finn takes it from there that the Lemon families were taking orders from the car behind this engine. Tomber reveals that the Lemons were hosting a secret meeting in
   Porto Corsa
   , Italy, which is also where the second race will take place, and the Lemon boss will most likely be there.
  </p>
  <p key="f7526226-887e-49ba-a5d8-50ae555f2556">
   While taking
   Stephenson
   to Italy, Finn and Holley install a holographic cloaking device onto Mater's roof light and has him disguise himself as a Lemon tow truck named
   Ivan
   . Mater then objects to buffing his dents to ensure a foolproof disguise, declaring their worth of his moments with McQueen. The spies realize he was talking seriously about being friends with McQueen and Finn tells him that friendships are dangerous in spy work. Mater again tries to tell them the truth again but they assume he was joking.
  </p>
  <p key="37fda3ac-a1e7-4c32-a253-fdc5460fee57">
   Upon arriving Porto Corsa, Mater begins to have second thoughts about the missions, but Finn tells him to keep up his "act" of playing "the idiot tow truck." These words deeply affect Mater, but he had no time to reflect, as Holley had lured away and tazed Ivan, prompting him to take the blue tow truck's place. As he is towing
   Victor Hugo
   through the casino, he nearly blows his cover by directly talking to Holley over the radio and reading his HUD on
   Alexander Hugo
   's wanted status and nicknames. Upon arriving at the Lemon meeting, Mater takes to the sidelines as the Lemon boss calls the meetings via video. Mater soon discovers the Lemon plot, revealing that the Lemons were sabotaging the race by igniting the Allinol in the racecars' tanks. As Finn and Holley are captured, Mater watches Axlerod on TV declaring a suspension of Allinol for the final race in London. However, McQueen announces that he will use Allinol for the race and admits how guilty he feels over his fight with Mater. The Lemon boss then calls the meeting, ordering
   Professor Z
   to kill McQueen and fully discredit Allinol. Mater then accidentally breaks his hologram disguise and allowing the Lemons to identify him, but the tow truck escapes after tearing up the place with his Gatling gun (his computer accidentally mishears "dad gum") and activates his parachute and flies off to warn McQueen about the Lemons' evil plot only to be captured and sent to
   London
   (the final race's setting) where he, along with Finn and Holley are all tied to the gears of Big Bentley to be crushed to death. Mater then confesses to Finn and Holley that he's not a spy and this time they believe him.
  </p>
  <p key="4ff63793-c192-4e6d-98f1-5b0cceb315ed">
   Mater then learns from
   Grem
   and
   Acer
   , two of the Lemons inside the clock tower that they have installed a bomb in Lightning McQueen's pit that will kill McQueen upon his arrival (due to their EMP cannon being disabled as a result of
   Sarge
   switching the
   Allinol
   with
   Fillmore
   's fuel). As soon as the Lemons had left, Mater activated his gatling guns to cut through the ropes binding him and races to the track to warn McQueen about the bomb. But when he gets there, Finn calls him on the radio, revealing that the Lemons tricked him, and that the bomb in question was instead inside Mater's air filter! As McQueen returns to the pit and spots Mater, the latter desperately drives backwards to avoid killing his friend, but McQueen chases after him. Mater's attempts to warn about the bomb go misunderstood. As McQueen grabs his hook, Mater accidentally activates his rockets, sending them blasting out of range of Professor Z's detonator. When they come to a stop, Holley reveals the bomb to McQueen as Finn arrives with a captive Zundapp. The Professor admits that the bomb is voice activated, but neglected to mention that it could only be disarmed by the one who activated it under Mater attempts to deactivate it himself, starting a five minute timer. Holley threatens Zundapp, only to learn that he wasn't the one who armed the bomb, shaving off another minute. After Holley tazes Zundapp, the foursome are surrounded by the Lemons, intending to watch the bomb go off. Mater attempts to reason with them, stating that he understands what it's like to be ridiculed but becoming rich and powerful beyond their wildest dreams isn't going to make them feel better. When that failed, the Radiator Springs townsfolk come to their rescue. In the subsequent fight, Mater defends McQueen against the Lemons with his karate.
  </p>
  <p key="4f311cee-de83-406d-83ba-73e080ec8c73">
   Guido then attempted to remove the bomb off Mater but none of his wrenches fit the bolts that hold it in place. With only two and half minutes left, Mater has an epiphany, but he hesitates to act on it, as he acknowledges to McQueen that they aren't in Radiator Springs. However, with some encouragement from his best friend, Mater proceeds to drag his friend all the way to Buckingham Palace, where he tells everyone that he knows who was sabotaging the race. But when he takes a moment to respectfully bow to the Queen, everyone spots the bomb and go into a panic. Finn intervenes before the royal guard could open fire, informing them that they can't disarm the bomb, and orders Mater to stand down. After remarking that that London is nothing like home, he is soon reminded by McQueen to get back on topic. He then accuses Axlerod of being the head Lemon. His reasoning was that the bolts on the bomb are the same ones from the Lemon engine on Holley's photo; he also realized that Axlerod didn't convert from a combustion engine to an electric one, hence how he leaked oil back in Japan, and he'd probably still have it under his hood. Though Finn and Holley were a bit skeptical, Mater stated that Axlerod wanted Allinol discredited to turn the world against alternative fuels and back to using oil, so he could profit off the huge untapped oil field Finn found. With his bomb only down to the last ten seconds, Axlerod, realizing that his villainy has been exposed and fearing for his life, is immediately forced to deactivate the bomb and is then arrested on the spot. Just right as the police is about to take Axlerod away, Mater opens the Lemon's hood revealing the exact same engine as seen in Holley's photos. As Axlerod was left aghast at how a tow truck figured him out, McQueen tells Mater that he's coming to all his races.

  <p key="61a7d828-668a-43cf-9c5e-0c7376188bf8">
   Subsequently,
   The Queen
   knights Mater for his bravery. Afterwards, Mater and his friends return to Radiator Springs, where he tells everyone of his adventure. Though
   Van
   doesn't believe a word of it, Finn and Holley show up to prove it. Mater then introduces Finn to everyone but Holley cuts him off, announcing herself as Mater's girlfriend (to Guido's shock). Mater was then pleased to see that Holley receives a dent from their London adventure and decide to emulate him by keeping it.
  </p>
  <p key="aed857d5-bf46-4632-a014-bb5092444a82">
   While watching the unofficial Radiator Springs Grand Prix, Finn and Holley reveal that they want to recruit Mater for another mission, but he declines, preferring to stay home. The spy cars respect his decision. Holley promises to come back and take him out for their first date and Finn offers to give Mater any favor he asks. Mater cashes in on that favor as he receives his rockets back and joins the race.

   Cruz Ramirez
   , McQueen calls Mater for support. Initially, Mater doesn't come up with a good piece of advice to help McQueen, who doesn't know what to do or where to go next, until he offhandedly mentions "the person who taught [Doc Hudson]". Knowing that person to be
   Smokey
   , Lightning thanks Mater for his support and goes off to apologize to Cruz and look for him. Mater is also seen wearing several hats throughout the movie to celebrate McQueen and later Cruz when the two race at
