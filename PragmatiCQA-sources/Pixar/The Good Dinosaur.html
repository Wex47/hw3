   Arlo
   . While Libby and Buck easily adjust to life and their responsibilities on their farm (signified by a mud-print on a corn silo), Arlo's nervous nature makes his tasks difficult for him. In order to give Arlo a sense of purpose, Henry puts him in charge of guarding their silo from pests and helping him set up traps. One day, a trap manages to capture a
   feral caveboy
   , but Arlo is too reluctant to kill him and lets him free. Heavily disappointed, Henry forces Arlo to accompany him to track the caveboy through a ravine where it begins to rain. After Arlo injures himself, Henry decides to turn back just as a flash flood occurs and a massive rapid appears. Henry only manages to save Arlo before he is swept away and killed.

   Without his father, Arlo must help his mother with harvesting crops before the first snow. After spotting the caveboy inside the silo, Arlo chases him in a fit of rage, the both of them falling into a river where Arlo hits his head on a boulder and is knocked unconscious. Waking up, Arlo is dismayed to find himself far from home and tries to survive on his own with minimal success. The caveboy finds Arlo and eventually gives him some berries to eat, and leads him to a berry tree where they are both attacked by a snake. The caveboy fights and repels the snake which amazes Arlo.

   , also impressed with the caveboy's physical prowess, tries to give him a name, but it is revealed that his name is "Spot" when Arlo calls out that name which he responds to. After traveling together for the rest of the day, Arlo laments about his lost family and confides in Spot who reveals that his own mother and father are dead. The next day, a storm ravages the land and Arlo, remembering the storm that took his father's life, runs for safety on his own.

   looking to steal Butch's herd. Butch and his children try to fend off the Rustlers, and Arlo successfully hits two of them allowing Butch to scare them off for good. With the T-rexes now fully respecting Arlo, Butch helps lead them towards the area of their homeland. Along the way, Arlo and Spot encounter a human off in the distance, but ignore him and continue on.

   As another storm begins to pick up, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack the two, this time managing to take Spot away and leaving Arlo behind. As Arlo gets tangled in some vines, he has a vision of Henry leading him away and back toward home, but Arlo admits his love for Spot and resolves to save him which makes his father proud before he fades away. Filled with determination, Arlo wakes up and attacks the pterodactyls who have cornered Spot at the river and the two of them manage to throw them into the water where they ride helplessly downstream. A flash flood begins and a massive mudslide crashes into the river and triggers a torrent. Arlo leaps to save Spot and the two of them are carried away towards a waterfall. Arlo manages to swim towards Spot and hold on to him as they both fall, with Arlo carrying Spot to shore where he regains consciousness.

   As they venture back forth, Arlo and Spot both hear the calls of a caveman family just as they come over the hill overseeing Arlo's farm. With great reluctance, Arlo allows Spot to return with them and the two of them share a tearful, but loving goodbye. Arlo comes back home to his mother and siblings, and he is allowed to leave his mud-print on the silo between the prints of his mother and father.

   Before the director change was announced, some additional details had already been given about the film's premise. According to the Los Angeles Times, Peter Sohn said: "The heart of the story remains the same. It's always been about this young dinosaur growing up. But the world itself has changed a lot. Nature has become a character." 
The Los Angeles Times also stated that nature had become the film's antagonist and also (incorrectly, as it turned out) that the idea from the original draft that dinosaurs are farmers has been dropped.
   Sohn's work aimed at simplifying and streamlining the story.

   <i key="94ea6b20-6099-460d-b974-d1a77d377be0">
    They [the dinosaurs] are kind of cartoony but they are dinosaurs; they are not walking around with clothes on or anything like that, they still are kind of dinosaurs. We focused on mostly the plant-eaters, not the carnivores... Their society becomes more of an agrarian society, meaning farmers. They become farmers. It’s a very funny story about a certain way of life that a young dinosaur has trouble fitting into and he ends up going on this quest. He kind of messes up and he has to put everything right by going on this quest and on that quest he meets this our character that is an outcast from his society too and so the two of them form this bond and it becomes this unique kind of story...'"

   At D23 Expo 2013, the film's plot was described further. Dinosaurs would have been the dominant species and had become farmers, using their physical characteristics to function as farm equipment. The film followed a family of apatosaurus. One of them, named Arlo and who is fascinated with bugs, discovered a large beetle that is in fact a human child, called Spot. The two of them then went on a journey through various climates.

   and other sources indicate that in the earlier versions, Rather than being on their own, Arlo's family was part of a larger community composed of more apatosaurus, along with other species. Arlo was an older, and considerably larger dinosaur then how he ended up in the final film, and was an outcast from his community.

   In May
   2012
   , before the director change, the filmmakers discussed the film. They said they want to explore what dinosaurs represent today, and how they are represented in stereotypes. Bob Peterson said: "
   <i key="3b4b773b-d065-43d1-a7ff-d64ff9636d6f">
    It's time to do a movie where you get to know the dinosaur, what it's really like to be a dinosaur and to be with a dinosaur
   </i>
   ".
   Peterson said the inspiration for the movie came from a childhood visit to the World's Fair where he was impressed by some dinosaur animatronics.
   The film's title might suggest that dinosaurs are evil. However, Peter Sohn warned: "The title is deceptively simple. It has more meaning than it seems."

    This is a boy and a dog story, but the roles are reversed. Arlo, the dinosaur, is the boy in the story and Spot is the dog.

   Lasseter also said that for this film Pixar aimed to make environments with a higher level of realism than anything they did before.
