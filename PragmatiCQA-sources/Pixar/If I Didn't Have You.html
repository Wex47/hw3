  </h2>
  <p key="f9907f90-46d2-4ae3-8425-6e8b978afc07">
   If I were a rich man
   With a million or two
   I'd live in a penthouse
   In a room, with a view
  </p>
  <p key="b20b7b4c-63f5-4452-880c-175d0008b29a">
   And if I were handsome
   (No way)
   It could happen
   Those dreams do come true
   I wouldn't have nothin'
   If I didn't have you
  </p>
  <p key="0a171a5e-8009-44c5-b599-0f1dc2c8b8dd">
   Wouldn't have nothin'
   If I didn't have
   Wouldn't have nothin'
   If I didn't have
   Wouldn't have nothin'
  </p>
  <p key="3b971e7e-e440-449a-869f-39abf9c1580f">
   Can I tell you something?
   For years I have envied
   (You green with it)
   Your grace and your charm
   Everyone loves you, you know?
   (Yes I know, I know, I know)
  </p>
  <p key="e4d8e80d-781d-4c65-9449-8e93794a36f5">
   I must admit it, big guy
   You always come through
   I wouldn't have nothin'
   If I didn't have you
  </p>
  <p key="a4df087c-1ccd-4b7f-b8a0-33086e5711a9">
   You and me together
   That's how it
   Always should be
   One without the other
   Don't mean nothing to me
   Nothing to me
   Ya
  </p>
  <p key="e80f4e72-9eb5-4e6c-8455-0af44d2e418d">
   I wouldn't be nothin'
   (Aw now)
   If I didn't have you
   To serve
  </p>
  <p key="9a08d445-ac23-48ff-a1c2-2dc2188c3b46">
   I'm just
   A punky little eyeball

   Hey, I never told you this
  </p>

   Sometimes
   I get a little blue
   (Looks good on you)
   But I wouldn't have nothin'
   If I didn't have you

   Let's dance (haha)
   Look, Ma, I'm dancin'
   Would you let me lead?

   Look at that
   it's two big guys

   Don't you dare dip me
   Don't you dare dip me
   Don't you dare dip me
   Ow!, I should have stretched
  </p>
  <p key="f8f4ade0-1dcd-44c9-b398-8c174533841a">
   Yes, I wouldn't be nothin'

  <p key="24589f21-4f55-415c-919b-12d9f1f95a7e">
   I wouldn't know
   Where to go
   (Me too because I)
   Or know, what to do
   (Why do you keep singin' my part?)
   I don't have to say it
   (Aw, say it anyway)
   Cause we both know
   It's true
  </p>
  <p key="bfced333-ff11-4052-8237-42c6c22045c3">
   I wouldn't have nothin'
   If I didn't have

   If I didn't have
   I wouldn't have nothin'
   If I didn't have
   Wouldn't have nothin'
   If I didn't have
   Youuuuu

   Don't have to say it
   Where'd everybody come from?!
   Althoguh, we both know it's true
   Let's take it home, big guy
