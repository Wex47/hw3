His supposed "alternative fuel" was actually gasoline engineered to explode when hit with an electromagnetic pulse, and was part of a plot to turn the world against alternative energy and have them rely on gasoline, bringing profits to the lemons and himself due to the fact that they own the largest untapped

By confronting Sir Axlerod for it, his suspicions are confirmed when Axlerod deactivates the bomb with a voice command in order to keep the bomb from killing himself. To proceed further, Mater opens Axlerod's hood, revealing the same engine (a Rover V8) as the unseen mastermind depicted in the photo, which Finn and Holley obtained from their

It is not told what happened to Axlerod after having his plot exposed, but it can be implied that in the end of the movie, he is arrested on the charges of conspiracy to commit crime, murder and embezzlement, since he is last seen being surrounded by several police cars.
