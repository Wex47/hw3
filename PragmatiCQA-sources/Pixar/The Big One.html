   When his package finally does arrive, Sid gleefully opens it to find a firework rocket called "The Big One". After marveling and 'examing' its warning label, decides what unlucky toy will be launched with the firework.

He initially tried to use a match to light the rocket's wick, although a passing car had extinguished the match before Woody had a chance to light it, although Woody eventually used Buzz's helmet to focus the sunlight to the wick to light it.
