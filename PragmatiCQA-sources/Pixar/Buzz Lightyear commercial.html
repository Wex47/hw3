   , Woody hides in a closet while Buzz ducks into a room where
   Mr. Phillips
   is seen sleeping on a La-Z-Boy, the sight that makes Scud back away. As Buzz sighs in relief, he hears a voice "reporting" from Star Command calling for Buzz. Thinking he can finally rendezvous with Star Command, he opens his wrist communicator, but hears a child's voice representing a responding Buzz Lightyear, then he looks up to see that the voice is actually coming from a TV in which a commercial is airing. A series of features on a Buzz Lightyear action figure is then screened on the TV, such as the locking wrist communicator, karate-chop action, pulsating laser light, multi-phrase voice simulator, and high-pressure space wings. A message saying "NOT A FLYING TOY" is then displayed, making Buzz realize for the first time that he is just a toy, to his dismay.

    Originally, Pixar was going to make it very reminiscent of the 1950s, simply because they thought that that was fun, but Disney asked them to make it more modern. Pixar consequently studied actual toy commercials playing in the 1990s and immediately noticed how much more overwhelming and fast-paced they were. The team contacted
