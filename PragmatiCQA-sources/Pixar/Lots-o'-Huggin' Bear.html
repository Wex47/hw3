   , Lotso seemed to have enjoyed every moment being special in his owner's eyes. One day, Daisy took her three toys out for a little drive with her parents and stopped at a rest stop for a little bit of playtime. After lunch, she fell asleep and her parents took her back into the car, accidentally leaving Lotso, Big Baby, and Chuckles behind. The three toys waited for a long time, but Daisy never came back for them. Not wanting to give up, Lotso and his friends, Chuckles and Big Baby, finally made their way back to

  <p key="672bc915-e3ac-4826-97d1-38cfe0483f1c">
   That night, after the toys experience a rather rough playtime with the toddlers in the room, Buzz decides to go find Lotso to ask for his friends to be moved to the

  <p key="f2637da1-1bec-4dd5-bbd3-c37576e9553a">
   When Buzz finally reaches Lotso in the library, he requests a transfer for him and his friends, to which Lotso agrees (but only to Buzz's moving, knowing that Buzz might be useful to him).
  </p>
  <p key="12c0be3e-7ce6-4be5-bf57-d3fd2beea6a0">
   However, he refuses to listen to Buzz's plea to move his friends with him, believing that the Caterpillar Room needs toys for toddlers to play with, which makes Buzz instantly refuse his offer, unwilling to abandon his friends because they stay together as a family. Thinking Buzz is too useful to give up, Lotso then tells

   The next night, while Lotso is asleep, Woody, who has escaped Sunnyside earlier, manages to rescue his imprisoned friends after hearing how evil Lotso is. Woody's friends are happy to see he's still alive, and together they formulate a plan to escape Sunnyside, including the attempt to get Buzz to rejoin their side.
  </p>
  <p key="ee57b057-dd93-48c2-a591-7926c2eba567">
   When the toys try to leave Sunnyside through the garbage chute that the
   Chatter Telephone
   had told Woody about earlier, Lotso and his gang catch them at a dumpster, blocking their way of escape. Lotso tries to coax the toys into coming back to the Caterpillar Room to join his family again to avoid an approaching
   garbage truck

When Ken disagrees with Lotso, Lotso becomes enraged at Ken's act of defection as well as his attachment to Barbie and throws him across the dumpster to force him to join her, disowning him as one of his cohorts. Ken then speaks up, explaining what Lotso has done to Sunnyside, making Lotso question his cohorts if anyone concurs with Ken. When no one answers, Lotso continues with his lecture, telling the toys that not one kid has ever loved, or will ever love, a toy. Woody then attempts to remind Lotso of his old life with his previous owner,
   Daisy
   . However, Lotso immediately becomes angry as he doesn't want anything to do with Daisy, but to forget completely that his relation to Daisy has ever existed. Woody then pulls out Big Baby's old pendant (received from

   earlier), and after angrily telling Lotso how she has loved him, Woody tosses the pendant to Big Baby, who picks it up and, looking at the token of his lost love, sniffles, "Mama." Outraged at how Big Baby is still emotionally attached to his previous owner, Lotso snaps out at Big Baby, yelling at him that Daisy never loved him as he snatches the pendant away from him and crushes it to pieces with his mallet, making Big Baby burst into tears. He then orders a now reluctant Stretch to push the toys into the dumpster, pokes Big Baby abusively with his cane and denounces all toys as trash awaiting disposal, much to the shock and disgust of the other Sunnyside toys, who finally realize that Lotso has been abusing them.
  </p>

   Without warning, Big Baby lifts up Lotso, causing him to drop his mallet. Lotso orders Big Baby to put him down, but Big Baby, having had enough with his treacherous nature, throws the bear into the dumpster and closes its lid on him. He then blows a raspberry directed at Lotso and allows the toys to escape. As the toys try to leave Sunnyside, one of the

   has become stuck by the dumpster's lid, prompting Woody to rush back to free the alien by slightly opening the lid. But then, Lotso, having caught sight of Woody through the opening and wanting revenge on Woody for foiling his schemes, grabs his ankle and pulls him into the dumpster, making Andy's other toys rush to his rescue just as the garbage truck arrives to pour the contents of the dumpster into the truck.

   , where they are pushed onto a conveyor belt leading to the shredders. After the toys grab onto a metal object so that they hang from the magnetic ceiling, safe from the shredders, Lotso calls for help from under a golf bag. Woody and Buzz drop down from the ceiling to free Lotso. They use one of the golf clubs to pry up the bag to let Lotso crawl out, and Woody makes Lotso take his hand as the club pulls them up to the ceiling, narrowly escaping the shredders that chew up the golf bag. Realizing that the conveyor belt is leading them to an incinerator, Lotso and the toys try to run for it, but the conveyor belt pushes them closer and closer to the furnace. Lotso then notices an emergency stop button and rushes over to grab hold on the lower rung of a ladder leading to the button. He calls to Woody, and Woody and Buzz rush over to nudge Lotso up, allowing him to climb up the ladder and access the button.

However, the toys are rescued by the giant crane that the Aliens have commandeered at the last moment. After the toys emerge out of the furnace,

   Meanwhile, as Lotso tries to find his way out of the dump, he turns to see another garbage truck pulling up toward him, forcing him to go limp. As the truck stops next to him, a garbage man steps out of the truck and is surprised upon discovering Lotso, claiming how he has once owned a Lots-o'-Huggin'-Bear during his childhood. Sticking to his love for Lotso (as well as his strawberry scent), the garbage man decides to take him along.

This inadvertently gives Lotso his well-deserved punishment.

   Lotso came across the toys' well being and at first seemed caring, welcoming, friendly, and he possessed all of the good qualities of the stereotypical soft teddy bear. This was further emphasized by his strawberry aroma and his hugging of Buzz Lightyear (hence his name Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear) when the toys first arrived at Sunnyside Daycare. He even went so far as to "promise" the toys that different kids at the daycare center would continue to play with them and that they would never feel unloved or rejected.
  </p>
  <p key="2c87b148-0c22-4c31-9f4b-013e169da07d">
   However, this facade merely concealed his true nature later in the film. Lotso's true colors revealed him to be a  dark, sadistic, conniving, selfish, rage-driven ruler and prison warden, ruling Sunnyside with an iron fist and imprisoning new toys in the Caterpillar Room to test their ability to endure the abuse of the reckless and destructive children there. This nature was mostly brought about by his perceived betrayal from Daisy. However, he was considered to be a kind-hearted friend to both Chuckles and Big Baby before they were accidentally abandoned and subsequently replaced. Due to his painful past, Lotso possessed a negative philosophy about being a toy, believing that toys are nothing special and originally made for future disposal (which is somewhat accurate because toys tend to be given away and sometimes even discarded by their owners when they outgrow them).
  </p>
  <p key="7b3ec1c9-d654-47ff-bee2-9167a7c0d2f6">
   While in power as a head toy at Sunnyside, Lotso seemed to develop nihilistic tendencies, as evidenced by his statement that all toys were ultimately going to be tossed out like garbage, and there is no salvation for them. He showed no mercy to toys that resisted, opposed, helped other toys escape, and didn't follow his views, with examples being breaking Chatter Telephone, having Stretch push the toys into the dumpster, disowning Ken for not agreeing with Lotso's view that there were hundred million Barbie dolls like Molly's, and punching Big Baby with his mallet for being attached to their former owner again. Additionally, by destroying Big Baby's old pendant, Lotso showed that he not only wanted to forget his relation with Daisy and pretend it never even existed, but he also wanted to destroy all of Big Baby's ties to Daisy and essentially all toys' ties to their owners. At the landfill, despite seemingly showing thankful feelings toward Woody for saving him from the shredders, Lotso still held on to his beliefs that children would discard their toys out of boredom and disinterest without realizing the physical and emotional pain they are causing to the toy, as evidenced when he refused to push the emergency stop button that, had he pressed it, would have supposedly led to his redemption by saving Woody and his friends from their fiery death in the incinerator.

Therefore, Lotso's reformation was dropped. Another reason is that they didn't want Lotso to get off so easily.
