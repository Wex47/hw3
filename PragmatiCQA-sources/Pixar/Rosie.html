   Rosie is a black widow spider with a motherlike nature. She is mostly a mother figure to the rhinoceros beetle,
   Dim
   , with whom she shares an act, and also the younger ants of the colony.

   Rosie works at
   P.T. Flea
   's
   circus
   as a "lion tamer" with her partner being the rhinoceros beetle Dim. During their opening act, Rosie cracks a whip at Dim, which was actually a shoelace, as he roars ferociously. However, Rosie unintentionally lashes one of Dim's feet, making him cry in pain. Rosie consoles Dim and later attempts to put a band-aid over his "owie." Later on, Rosie and her
   circus troupe
   friends are fired after they accidentally
   burn
   P.T..

   At the
   Bug Bar
   , they get into a fight with some
   flies
   , and
   Flik
   thought they were warriors and they thought that Flik was a manager searching for entertainment. She, along with her friends, then fly to
   Ant Island
   .
  </p>
  <p key="814169d8-b2ed-4128-ae43-a65e200f025c">
   She is the one that tells Flik that they are circus artists and not warriors. After that, they attempt to leave the island, but are stopped by the attack of a
   bird
   . Rosie participates in the rescue of
   Dot
   and
   Francis
   by making a web to transport Flik, Dot, Francis,
   Tuck and Roll
   to safety. It is interesting to note that Rosie is very strong, as she carried the spider web with Flik, Dot, Francis, Tuck and Roll inside, and when it was cut accidentally, Rosie held them long enough to land on a tree.
  </p>
  <p key="5e6a0a7f-5001-4af3-9a19-ab10247febe1">
   After the rescue, the Circus Bugs agree to stay and support Flik's idea of making an artifical bird to scare
   Hopper
   and the
   grasshoppers
   away. Rosie participates in the making of the bird and then, at a party, she talks with an ant about her twelve deceased husbands, making her (as she says) a "black widow widow." At the climax of the film, she participates in the final battle against the grasshoppers. She and her friends then leave the island with the promise of returning next spring.
