   Mr. Jones is a pet iguana formerly owned by

    Ron

   , the manager of
   Sleep Well
   . Ron trained him to retrieve toys from visitors and bring them to his office, where he placed them in a basket and rang a bell to alert Ron.

  <p key="aaf314d2-2dad-41fd-b2b1-93d5faf43c2a">
   When
   Bonnie Anderson
   and
   her mother
   arrived at the hotel for the night, Mr. Jones, after a period of time, brought the entire toy gang along with

   </a>
   's arms in the process. After Mr. Jones rang Ron's bell to alert his owner of his success, Ron praised his pet lizard before locking Jessie in a cabinet with the other stolen toys.
  </p>
  <p key="37dc28fa-891c-482c-8efe-f8e4ec44ddd2">
   Mr. Jones then proceeded to rest until he saw Jessie (who managed to escape) sneaking toward the curtain hiding Ron's scheme. He attacked her, but after she noticed Mr. Potato Head's arm and Combat Carl's hand (which Mr. Jones had eaten sometime before the main events of the story) in the back of his mouth, she kicked the lizard's stomach, forcing him to cough up Combat Carl's hand, then pushed her head and arm inside his mouth, retrieving Mr. Potato Head's arm before escaping.
  </p>
  <p key="a60290ca-10ef-43d2-b173-fe2bbbe73ed2">
   With the help of Mr. Potato Head's arm, Jessie tricked Mr. Jones into yanking off Ron's curtain, revealing his scheme to Bonnie and her mother. After Jessie froze because of the presence of the humans, Mr. Jones retrieved her and brought her to the basket before ringing Ron's bell, further exposing his owner and cementing his redemption as it is shown that the iguana sold Ron out. Later, Ron fed him with a dog dish, which he proceeded to eat, just as two police officers arrived to arrest his owner for theft. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards, though according to the commentary on the DVD, he was to be sent to live in an iguana sanctuary called Iguanaland where he lived better and redeemed himself completely.

   Though he is an iguana, Mr. Jones acts more like a dog. He followed his training by his master
   Ron
   closely up until exposing his toy-napping scheme to
   Bonnie
   and
   her mother
   by doing so in an attempt to sell Ron out. He then defected to the good side after being sentenced to Iguanaland thus he is no longer considered a villain to the date.
