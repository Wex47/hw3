   Doc was a well-respected vehicle in Radiator Springs. As the town's motor-medic, he'll sort out all the residents' health issues, and gives thorough checkups at his medical clinic. Very loyal to all his friends, Doc holds a lot of influence and has strong opinions on the sort of cars he wants in his town. Sometimes he can be a stubborn car of few words, but at other times he delivers very wise advise such as turn right to go left.
  </p>
  <p key="15310acc-ab81-47bb-a561-ade7221f40af">
   As Radiator Springs' resident judge at Traffic Court, Doc Hudson makes his lofty pronouncements from the height of his podium. Doc is fiercely protective of the town. Never really one for light sentences, he rants about letting criminals rust in the impound. If any vehicle is facing the Doc, they better hope he's a in good mood—and if anyone ruins something in Radiator Springs, any car can guarantee he isn't going to be.
  </p>
  <p key="e50a4fdd-1f2c-4cf3-8bd8-c3446afec3d0">
   There is a hidden side to Doc Hudson that none of the other town residents know about. In the past, as the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, he was a legendary champion, with an amazing track record of winning three
   Piston Cups
   in a row from 1951 to 1953. However, after a bitter exit from the racing world, Doc Hudson has kept the secret under his hood for decades. When Lightning McQueen discovers the cups in Doc's garage, Hudson has to face the past again thanks to the rookie.
  </p>
  <p key="55f69c04-1158-46cb-be67-518396430df1">
   When he tried to win his fourth Piston Cup in 1954, Doc had a serious crash which left him out for the rest of the racing season. Doc never had a chance to make a comeback because everyone seemed more interested in new cars. "You're history," they told him. So instead of returning to the racetrack, Doc ended up moving to Radiator Springs and became both doctor and judge. He has kept the old newspapers in his garage and still feels haunted by the memories.
  </p>
  <p key="052dde31-8f47-40c9-a5c3-ab28cd2e0a29">
   The reason Doc choose to become crew chief for Lightning was to support his friend, who has now become part of the Radiator Springs family. Doc doesn't want to get back into racing himself—those days have passed for him, and he is happy just being Doc. However, there's a magic moment when
   Ramone
   gives Doc his Fabulous Hudson Hornet paint job, and the crowd applauds as they recognize the racing legend.

   "Doc Hudson was a car of few words but many talents. He not only served as the town judge, he was also
   Radiator Springs
   ' resident doctor. Doc was respected and admired by the town's folk for the way he looks out for their health and tends to their aches and pains. No one knows too much about Doc before he came to town. He kept his private life private. But if you've got a bad spark plug or a rattle in your engine, his door was always open."
  </p>
  <p key="b1916afb-49f1-4fb0-ba63-576aaf604a7b">
   "Hud started racing in the Piston Cup series back in 1951, when tracks were dirt, and cars were tough. No trailers, no pitties, just heavy-duty motors and strong chassis battling it out for a few bucks and a big cup. His low center of gravity, and agile cornering ability were impossible to beat and many of his fellow racers hit the hay bales trying to hold the line alongside him."
  </p>
  <p key="c18d0927-b488-4389-896e-d0899e7c11cc">
   "Doc's racing days ended when he arrived in Radiator Springs. But with Lightning McQueen in town he can't help trying on those old racing tires to see if he's still got it."

   He was once one of the most famous race-cars in history; he won three Piston Cups, and still holds the record for most wins in a single season. However, it all changed for Doc when he was involved in a terrible crash during the final lap of the 1954 Piston Cup championship race, which saw him put out for the next full season. Upon his return, he was received with a complete absence of fanfare and told that he was a has-been who had been passed up for the next rookie in line. He reluctantly resigned from the sport, and vanished from public. He eventually settled in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs and moved into a house in the nice town. In his house he kept a newspaper article on the career-ending crash as a reminder never to return to the life that nearly killed him.
  </p>
  <p key="7a88dfa1-3877-470b-8907-b8f46f8c4ca2">
   Jaded by the racing scene, he left that world, apparently taking out time to study medicine. The famous #51 disappeared into obscurity, leaving many wondering where he had gone. He instead opted for a simple navy blue paint job and the life of a physician in the tiny town of Radiator Springs, the "shining Gemstone" of the Mother Road - Route 66. He runs the Ornament Valley Mechanical Clinic as a "Doctor of Internal Combustion". As times changed and the town got bypassed in favor of Interstate 40, Doc stayed on, even when the population had dwindled to a meager dozen or so residents. He is respected, well-loved, and serves not only as the town's physician, but as its judge as well. However, nobody in the town had any idea of his past as a racer; he was just an ordinary Hudson Hornet to them.

   Upon meeting
   Lightning McQueen
   , who had accidentally destroyed the main road in town, Doc saw far too much of his past in the rookie. He wanted to send the racecar out of town but Sally persuaded him to commit Lightning to community service by paving a new road. Only after an hour, the rookie attempted to quickly finish the job, only to do it sloppily. Doc ordered him to tear up the road and redo it. However, he challenged Lightning to a one-lap race around
   Willy's Butte
   if he wanted his freedom. He anticipated that the racecar who was too used to asphalt would not do well on the dirt track and lose control on the final turn right into a cactus patch. As he prepared to go to sleep, Doc watched with smugness as Lightning miserably began to work overnight.
  </p>
  <p key="78b694d7-de6c-4b2e-b231-f8ba44a643cd">
   The next day, everyone wakes up to find that Lightning had paved a good road up to the intersection, at least half of the job; Sally commented that Doc should have thrown the rookie into a cactus patch a lot sooner. Doc then found
   Sheriff
   watching Lightning attempting to make the last turn around Willy's Butte, having ran out of asphalt in the middle of the night. Doc volunteers to take over watching Lightning and attempts to give him advice on how to make the turn. However, Lightning failed to understand it and rudely drove off to try the course again, so Doc let him be.
  </p>
  <p key="e0598899-627d-4908-998a-9d5050a286a7">
   On the third day, Doc was operating on Sheriff when Lightning rudely burst into his office, wanting to ask for his daily gas ration. Doc ordered him to wait by
   Flo's V8 Cafe
   . Soon after, he finds Lightning in his garage, having discovered his identity as the Hudson Hornet. He was less than happy when Lightning discovers his past. Doc refused to speak of his past and called his trophies "just empty cups". Later in the day, Doc put on his race tires to take a lap around Willy's Butte and successfully made the turn. But when he realized that Lightning was spying on him, he promptly drove back to his home. Lightning followed him and asked why he gave up on being a big racer. Doc related his crash in '54 and how the sport rejected him after he recovered which made him cynical. When Lightning insisted that he is not like the sportscars who rejected him too, Doc wanted to know if he had ever cared about anyone besides himself. When the rookie couldn't answer that question, Doc tells him that the Radiator Springs residents look out for each other and he does not want them reliant on a selfish car like him. Lightning then retorted that Doc is no better than him, by not opening about his past to his friends. Instead of countering, Doc angrily tells him to finish the road and leave town.
  </p>
  <p key="e88e2f48-13e4-4c21-b87e-7834c55a59a1">
   On the fourth day, Lightning had finished fixing the road and decided to stay for a while, Doc was unable to bear having him around any longer and called the news and press to immediately take him away to the Piston Cup, declaring that it is best for everyone. But seeing how disheartened everyone was by his unplanned departure when Sally calls him out on his selfishness, Doc realized that Lightning had become more important to them than he thought. He eventually reveals to everyone his racecar days and he took back his old #51 colors to become Lightning's pit crew chief, bringing nearly the entire town (except
   Sally
   ,
   Red
   , and
   Lizzie
   -- who watched the race on TV) to the Piston Cup to support Lightning as his pit crew (and in an ironic twist of fate, finally received that long awaited fanfare for his return). When
   Chick Hicks
   caused
   Strip "The King" Weathers
   to crash, in a similar manner to Doc himself, Lightning chose to forfeit the race to help the King cross the finish line. Doc then expressed how proud he is of Lightning.
  </p>
  <p key="cd264e6f-d53f-460d-8864-8440238ecb27">
   By the end of the film, Doc opts to keep his paint scheme, and becomes a trainer as well as a friend to Lightning. Just like Lightning, Doc learned some lessons: friendship, promises, how greed affects others, and that secrets cannot be kept forever.

   Tokyo
   ,
   Darrell Cartrip
   mentioned that McQueen's mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was one of the best dirt track racers in history. On the dirt section, Mater told Lightning to do what Doc has taught him (turn right to go left), which he did and took the lead. Another allusion to Doc is made in the end during the Radiator Springs Grand Prix when all the racers drive up the side of the canyon where Willies Butte is located just like Doc used to do.

   John Lasseter was at first adamant that
   Paul Newman
   would return to voice Doc Hudson, even though he had announced his retirement from acting. After Newman's death, Lasseter said that they would see how the story goes with Doc Hudson.
   Story supervisor
   Nathan Stanton
   said: "we felt, after really tooling around with the idea of him being in the film and how do we properly use him, it just felt right that we should have his character have passed away also [as Paul Newman]."
   John Lasseter said that he realized "Doc Hudson was Paul Newman. The character was written after listening to him talk about his passion for racing," and that, "We pay homage to Doc Hudson, which is paying homage to Paul Newman."

   Due to his death, Doc doesn't appear physically in this movie but a huge portion of it focuses on McQueen remembering him. He is also mentioned and alluded to several times as well as appearing in a few flashbacks that McQueen has of Doc training him, which helps him focus on race. His voice is provided by unused recordings of Paul Newman originally meant for the first movie. In the beginning, when McQueen is preparing for a race in his trailer, he has a flashback of Doc giving him a lecture on the dirt track in Radiator Springs.

  <p key="6f70bcb9-8455-4f42-8512-d5b5ae169585">
   Later on in the season, as the Next Gen rookies start taking over the veterans, McQueen loses control in the final race and winds up in a crash similar to the one Doc had that ended his career. As a result McQueen gets hospitalized for the next four months. One morning as the day of the first race on the new season is nearing, McQueen is in Doc's garage and watches an old video recording of Doc's last race showing his big crash. When the video ends, McQueen gravely remembers what Doc told him in the first movie about when he returned to the track expecting a big welcome, only to find that they moved on to the next rookie standing in line. Upon remembering this and glancing at Doc's newspaper article about his crash, McQueen starts to wonder if he is bound for the same fate as Doc. When Sally visits him a few seconds later, McQueen reminds her that Doc was forced out of racing against his will, and tells her that he doesn't want what happened to Doc to happen to him. Sally tells him to not fear failure but fear not having the chance because he has the chance while Doc didn't. Hearing this, McQueen decides to keep on being a racer and that he will decide when he's done and not end up like Doc.

   At the very end of the film, Lightning McQueen learns what Doc Hudson felt as he mentors
   Cruz Ramirez
   , similar to how Doc mentored Lightning. Lightning ends up painting himself in a way similar to Doc Hudson's paint job, and even has the words "Fabulous Lightning McQueen" (similar to "Fabulous Hudson Hornet") and "For Doc Hudson" painted on. The last bit of the movie is two photos side-by-side, the left one being a picture of Doc Hudson with Lightning, the right one being Lightning (in his new paint job) with Cruz.
