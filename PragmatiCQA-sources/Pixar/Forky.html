   Forky is kind and pleasant, though quite naive, unaware of the danger he puts himself through. At the beginning of the film, he is certain he is not a toy, but instead belongs in the trash, even going as far as attempting to throw himself out every chance he's given. This is because the prospect of being alive in the first place made him uncomfortable, being unable to understand his purpose. Even after he starts accepting he was made to make Bonnie happy, he still refers to himself as "Bonnie's trash" until the end, as shown when he tells

   in school using a spork and some crafts, Forky quickly becomes Bonnie's most important toy. Initially Forky rejects his new role as a toy, starting by only saying "trash?" followed by constantly throwing or attempting to throw himself away, only for

Catching on his phrase, Forky asks who Andy is, and the two toys get into a long discussion (with Forky enthusiastically agreeing with everything Woody says) about Woody's time as a toy. Eventually bringing things back to trash as is Forky's wont, Woody asks Forky why he is so obsessed with trash. Forky explains that because it's soft and warm and is like a voice telling you that "everything's gonna be ok".
  </p>
  <p key="90b4767a-9c65-4c43-b9a9-7c7501f70290">
   Seizing on this line of thought, Woody tells Forky that he provides that kind of assurance to Bonnie, and that for that reason he should stick around. However, Forky becomes confused, latching onto the idea that he is "Bonnie's trash", even though he nevertheless becomes enthusiastic about returning to Bonnie, running well ahead of Woody in his eagerness to return.

   After being reassembled by the Bensons, Gabby Gabby treats Forky kindly and queries him for information about Woody, which Forky freely gives into his ignorant innocence. They become good friends, with Forky helping Gabby Gabby to be proficient in tea etiquette. Woody tries to rescue Forky, but a Benson captures Forky yet again.

   Finally agreeing to give Gabby Gabby his voice box, Woody asks for Forky's release as a condition, to which Gabby Gabby agrees. After the Bensons remove Woody's voice box and sew him back together, he and Forky head toward Bonnie's backpack. Before making it inside, Forky stops so that he can watch
