   first encountered them, the two thought they were cannibals who were going to eat them, especially when they blocked the escape route for the duo. Holding Buzz as a hostage, Woody makes Buzz karate chop to scare them away as they escape.
However, when the mutant toys later reattached Buzz's arm and the heads of Hannah's Janie doll and Sid's Pterodactyl back onto their bodies, Woody was stunned to see that they were not cannibals as he had initially thought they were. After Sid took Buzz (whom he had strapped his new rocket to) outside to be blown up, the mutant toys agreed to participate Woody's plan rescue Buzz from Sid's clutches while also seeing this as their own chance to get revenge on Sid. Working together, they first drove Sid's dog

   , who was positioned outside Sid's room, away and out onto the front porch so the toys could safely escape into Sid's backyard. Once outside, they moved into their final positions, from where they emerged out, surrounding Sid, as Woody told him how much they don't like the way Sid was treating them (being blown up, smashed, or ripped apart) and that they would find out if Sid didn't take good care of his toys because "we toys can see everything." After Woody scared Sid away with his own voice, "So play nice," and caused him to retreat in fear of his own toys (considering everything he had done to all of them), they all rejoiced victoriously. When rushing to try and reach the Davis's van before they moved out, Woody assures them that they'll keep touch.
