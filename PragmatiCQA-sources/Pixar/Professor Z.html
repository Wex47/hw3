   "Professor Z, aka “The Professor,” is an internationally-wanted weapons designer in a small, sophisticated German package. He is a brilliant but mad monocle-wearing scientist who is plotting to sabotage the
   <a href="World Grand Prix.html" key="c4e31b4f-2b82-4bf7-b37f-d4b4ed65e30e" title="World Grand Prix">
    World Grand Prix
   </a>
   . Though his true motive is unclear, Professor Z is willing to do whatever it takes to eliminate all obstacles and keep the “project” on schedule."
  </p>
  <p key="deb6c13e-3bab-4dd1-917b-dc8edabca05b">
   During the film, it is learned that the Professor is not the main villain, nor is he the leader of the
   lemon cars
   . As it turns out, he is actually working for WGP creator
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Miles Axlerod.html" key="23214b56-e9d5-4baa-9557-12f80839f883" title="Miles Axlerod">
    Sir Miles Axlerod
   </a>
   . Since Professor Z is a scientist, Miles Axlerod has him invent an
   electromagnetic pulse weapon
   , which is disguised as a World Grand Prix camera, to use on the racers that use the fuel called
   <a href="Allinol.html" key="60d52c97-2742-4da1-a4d9-617ce6db3f38" title="Allinol">
    Allinol
   </a>
   . This was all part of a plan to turn the world against alternative energy and have all cars rely on gasoline, bringing profits to the lemon cars and himself due to the fact that they own the
   largest untapped oil reserves
   in the world.
  </p>
  <p key="bd5bdf27-32d5-4950-b7f9-743aa4e44690">
   It later turns out that Axlerod and Professor Zündapp engineered Allinol not as alternative energy, but actually made it from gasoline that would ignite upon being hit with the electromagnetic pulse emitter.
  </p>
  <p key="947a124f-969e-4b28-bc34-90a13ea116ec">
   Following the sabotage of the Italy race, it would seem that Allinol was finished, until
   Lightning McQueen
   announced that he would use Allinol for the final race in London. Professor Z then received instructions from Axlerod to kill McQueen during the race. However, they then discovered that
   Mater
   had infiltrated the meeting disguised as
   Ivan
   , who escaped to warn McQueen but the lemons managed to capture him, along with
   Finn McMissile
   and
   Holley Shiftwell
   .
  </p>
  <p key="0b7da698-dda1-4628-bf4a-a146dcffc7de">
   Professor Zündapp and the Lemons then moved to
   London
   to enact the final stage of their plan. However, they were unaware that
   Sarge
   had secretly switched McQueen's Allinol with
   <a href="Fillmore.html" key="6f17f0b1-3530-4103-8389-c4f55144b819" title="Fillmore">
    Fillmore
   </a>
   's organic fuel, making him immune to the EMP. Thus, Zündapp ordered
   Acer
   and
   Grem
   to switch to the backup plan: they'd trick Mater into thinking that they planted a bomb in McQueen's pit for what he returns there, when in truth the bomb was hidden in Mater's air filter, at which the tow truck would escape due to being held by thin frayed ropes and attempt to warn McQueen, before Zündapp remotely detonates the bomb. However, Finn and Holley managed to escape also and discover the plot and managed to get a warning to Mater. Mater then attempted to get some distance from McQueen as the race car chased him. But just as he managed to snag Mater's hook, the tow truck activated his rockets, causing the tow to race out of range of the detonator, to Zündapp's fury. Then spotting Holley hovering outside his window, guns drawn, Zündapp panicked and fled. He attempted to get to
   Tony Trihull
   but Finn caught up to him and snagged him by the bumper with his grappling hook. However, Tony drew the two towards him with a giant magnet, causing Zündapp to lose his monocle and Finn most of his weapons, as the warship targeted the spy car with missiles. However, Finn released multiple mini-bombs, which killed Tony and allowing him to capture Zündapp.
  </p>
  <p key="9fd20d31-b512-4b0c-8abd-017476b1f5c1">
   Brought before McQueen, Mater and Holley, the evil professor demanded to know why his 'death ray' didn't kill the race car. Finn then ordered him to turn off the bomb. Zündapp confessed that the bomb is voice activated. But as Mater finds out, only the car who armed it could deactivate, starting a five-minute timer. Holley threatened Zündapp, who confessed that he didn't arm the device, shaving off another minute and casually asked if anyone else would like to try, before being tased by Holley. He is last seen in the custody of the British police and is ultimately arrested with Axlerod and the remaining Lemons for their crimes.

    His license plate is BAD GA 58, which appears to be a pun on "bad guy". The 58 is one of the years the Zündapp Janus was made (1957-1958).

    are British, McMissile pronounces the "Z" in Zündapp's name in the American way ("Z" in American is pronounced "zee" while in Britain is pronounced "zaid"). However, it could be that the "Z" in his name is always pronounced "zee" even in Britain (when referring to Professor Z) in that cutscene. However, it could be that all people pronounce the "Z" in his name the American way. Also, although Professor Z pronounces "missile" in the British way (miss-i-all), he pronounces "can't" in the American way.

    Professor Z is thought to be the main antagonist early on, but when
    Sir Miles Axlerod
    's evil plot is exposed, it turns out Z is actually the secondary antagonist since Axlerod had bigger plans, and he is the boss of Z and the Lemons. However, Z is the one who drives the plot and is probably more dangerous than Axlerod.
