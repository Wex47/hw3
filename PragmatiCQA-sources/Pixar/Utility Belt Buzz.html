   is amazed to discover an aisle full of new Buzz Lightyear action figures. He sees "NEW UTILITY BELT!" on the display stand and, thinking he would like nice with the new belt, climbs up to encounter this Buzz Lightyear action figure. When he foolishly attempts to take this Buzz's belt, the Utility Belt Buzz suddenly springs to life, mistaking him for a rogue space ranger and overpowering him in a fight. Utility Belt Buzz, not knowing he is a toy, subdues Andy's Buzz and takes the latter as the former's prisoner. Utility Belt Buzz ties and stuffs Andy's Buzz into a Buzz Lightyear box as Andy's Buzz tries to convince Utility Belt Buzz that he is a toy, but he refuses to listen. Irritated by Andy's Buzz's "misbehavior," Utility Belt Buzz isolates Andy's Buzz by placing him on the shelf with the newer Buzz Lightyear toys. He, like the original Buzz in the

   , believes that he is a real space ranger, although he is apparently even more deluded than Andy's Buzz initially was (e.g. when Andy's Buzz has mumbled whether he has been this deluded in embarrassment of his former behavior, which he obviously wishes to leave in the past).

He is at first suspicious of Andy's toys, but when Rex excitedly claims that he knows how to defeat the Evil Emperor Zurg, Utility Belt Buzz decides to join the toys on their quest, considering them his allies while thinking that they are on a mission to infiltrate Zurg's fortress, defeat the evil emperor, and possibly rescue a kidnapped person taken hostage by Zurg himself. The toys then leave the aisle, leaving Andy's Buzz tied up in a box on the shelf, struggling to get out. As the toys leave with Utility Belt Buzz, Andy's Buzz screams out to them that they have the wrong Buzz, but since he is in a thick cardboard spaceship shaped box, none of them can hear him. At several points, Utility Belt Buzz nicknames Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, and Rex "slotted pig," "vegetable man," and "lizard man," respectively, and imagines the owner of Al's Toy Barn (

   , the same man who has kidnapped Woody) as a possible agent of Zurg (he even calls Al the "poultry man" since Andy's toys called him the "chicken man" after seeing him in his chicken costume). He tells the toys to get into Al's bag, thinking he might help them reach Zurg. After the toys arrive outside the building that houses

   , Utility Belt Buzz finds the air vent and navigates the toys through the vent and up the elevator shaft with his grappling hook on his new utility belt, despite Mr. Potato Head growing more suspicious of his cocky attitude ("I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure!"). During the climb, Rex slips and pushes the toys to the bottom of the line, causing Utility Belt Buzz's strength to give out, prompting him to activate his anti-gravity servos (unaware that it won't work since he is just a toy). Despite protest from the toys, Utility Belt Buzz lets go of the wall, and the toys land on a conveniently rising elevator that takes them all the way up to level 23. He thinks that his anti-gravity servos are really working, however, and is unaware that Andy's Buzz (who broke out of the box he trapped him in) is tracking and following him along with the rest of the toys.
  </p>
  <p key="4ca91ac7-a3e6-4108-84ed-7cf7fffe6f09">
   Utility Belt Buzz acts literally when he tells Rex to "use his head," and the toys then use him as a battering ram to break into Al's penthouse. In the ensuing melee that follows, Utility Belt Buzz and the toys grab Woody and head back for the vent, but Andy's Buzz stops them. In a brief argument between the two Buzz Lightyear toys, Andy's Buzz opens Utility Belt Buzz's helmet, causing the latter to think he is suffocating under "toxic" air, and proves that the former is the Buzz the other toys recognize by flashing Andy's name written on the sole of his foot; though before this, the toys were willing to accept Utility Belt Buzz's when they didn't buy his strange behavior. After closing his helmet and regaining his composure, Utility Belt Buzz is initially confused at what is happening, but is stunned yet happy to learn from Andy's Buzz about "Code 546," then walks over to Woody and kneels in front of him, delightedly addressing Woody as "Your Majesty."

   into his case and leaves the room, they encounter a Zurg action figure (let loose accidentally by Andy's Buzz when leaving Al's Toy Barn), whom Utility Belt Buzz engages in a fierce battle. During this fight, Zurg overpowers Utility Belt Buzz and claims that he is his father, causing Utility Belt Buzz to scream in disbelief. After Rex accidentally knocks Zurg down the elevator shaft with his tail, Utility Belt Buzz forlornly thinks he has lost his father. After the toys exit the apartment, Andy's Buzz runs into Utility Belt Buzz one last time when the other Buzz is last seen playing ball with Zurg to form a real father-son bond. He calls Zurg a "great dad," as Andy's Buzz bids him farewell with a Vulcan salute and leaves.
