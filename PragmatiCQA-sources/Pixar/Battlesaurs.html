   At the 2014 San Diego Comic Con, head of story
   Derek Thompson
   gave some information on the backstory of the Battlesaurs. According to him, the world the Battlesaurs live in has been devastated by "Zeta rays". This radiation mutated them from their original dinosaur forms into more or less humanoid shapes, and created a hostile world filled with savage beasts.
  </p>
  <p key="ca4baf96-e58a-4b23-a884-a39f7c2caaf0">
   To survive, the Battlesaurs formed a society centered on battle, fiercely defending their great city Battleopolis against all foes from the outlands. They rely on their Clerics, who decipher the signs from mysterious cosmic beings, to provide them with guidance in their fight for survival. Battlesaurs hold gladiatorial combats where their champions battle captured beasts from the outlands.

   Mason
   , a friend of
   Bonnie
   , received for Christmas a complete set of Battlesaurs. However, he didn't play with them because he was more interested in his Optimum X console; as a result, the Battlesaurs were completely unaware they were toys, and reproduced their series' storyline with dangerous seriousness, capturing all toys they encountered. Only their Cleric was aware of their toy nature, but he considered the Battlesaurs had no use for play and kept them in their ignorance.

   , because they are dinosaurs, were welcomed in the tribe. However, the other toys were condemned to die. To save them, Trixie succeeds to get Bonnie and Mason to play with the toys, revealing to all of the Battlesaurs what play is. Following this, the changed Battlesaurs settled down on a more peaceful existence.
