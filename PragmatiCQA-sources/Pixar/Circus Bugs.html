   The Circus Bugs first appear with their acts do not perform well with the flies dissatisfied of their performance with many of them leaving the circus in anger. Their leader
   P.T. Flea

P.T. survived the act after the flaming flypaper falls and him and the Circus Bugs extinguish him with water droplets, but he fires the whole troupe for bad performance in the circus.

   Flik first sees them in the city after they were fired by P.T. Flea, when his "Flaming Death" act went wrong, doing a Robin Hood act, believing them to be warriors, and they believe him to be a talent scout, and he convinces them to come to Ant Island to help him deal with the grasshoppers. They soon discover their misunderstandings, and are grumpy with Flik for not telling them about actually combating grasshoppers, and attempt to leave, but after a

   and
   Princess Atta
   banish them from the island, along with Flik as punishment for lying to the colony, however this was a fatal mistake; they put themselves in danger. WhenÂ Hopper and his gang return and take over the island, Dot eavesdrops on a couple of grasshoppers discussing Hopper's scheme to squish the queen in order to discourage opposition from the ants and follows Flik and the troupe to tell them about the dire situation. Flik is still ashamed of himself for being a screwup all the time, but some encouragement from Dot and the troupe makes him feel better and motivated to return and stop Hopper. The Circus Bugs present themselves to Hopper, claiming that Princess Atta invited them as a surprise for his arrival; Hopper initally orders his gang to kill them, but after seeing Tuck and Roll fight, he decides they can use a little entertainment and spares their lives. The Circus Bugs continue their show until Manny takes the queen for a magic trick, making Hopper demand to know where she is. At that moment, Flik and the
   Blueberries
   launch the fake bird they constructed to scare the grasshoppers; it works, until P.T. sets it on fire, revealing it to be a hoax.

Following Hopper's defeat, P.T. and his troupe spend the winter on Ant Island before returning to the circus in the spring after a brief celebration, bringing a group of acrobatic ants and Hopper's younger brother
