   Randall is a monster that looks akin to a lizard. He has small sharp teeth, two green eyes that are nearly on top of his head, and three fronds on the top of his head. Randall is quadrupedal, with eight limbs in total. (Four legs and four arms.) Randall has three fingers and toes on each of his limbs. His skin is covered by small smooth scales that are usually dark purple in colour. The scales on his tail are blue instead of purple, like the rest of his body. Of course you can't see any of this when he is camaflauged. (Except the teeth)

   Randall's scare assistant is
   Fungus
   , who usually annoys him. He usually gets into small disagreements with
   Mr. Waternoose
   , who serves as Randall's partner-in-crime. Randall resembles a lizard, with the ability to change his color from purple and blue to blend into his surroundings at will, much like a chameleon, making him invisible.

   He works as a Scarer for
   Monsters, Inc.
   by entering children's rooms through a system of
   closet doors
   and scaring sleeping children to bottle their screams, which is a source of power in their world. He is in competition with Sulley and Mike for the glorious post of Top Scarer. Randall constructed a "
   Scream Extractor
   " and kidnapped a human child in cooperation with the company's leader Henry J. Waternoose, with the hopes to eventually rise to the leader of the company.
  </p>
  <p key="78cfda30-3464-45b8-a694-d0ac71c11747">
   However, the initial plot failed due to Mike sending Sulley back after closing hours to submit paperwork which Mike forgot to turn in earlier. Sulley stumbled upon the child, whom he nicknames
   Boo
   . Sulley and Mike take the child home with them, but since children are forbidden in their world due to a belief that they can infect the monsters, Sulley and Mike are exiled when their secret is revealed. Randall and Waternoose are now able to go through with testing the scream extractor on Boo (although Waternoose expresses distaste for having to exile Sulley and Mike due to Randall's negligence, pointing out that Sulley was "twice the scarer Randall could ever be").
  </p>
  <p key="3775e722-913e-4161-ab74-3fdd5193baf4">
   After Sulley manages to escape and wreck the Scream Extractor, Mr. Waternoose tells Randall to stop Sulley, then Randall attacks and strangles him. He proves to be quite an adversary due to his cloaking abilities; he also states to Sulley how he had personally waited so long to attack him. This whole time Mike is trying to apologize to Sulley, thinking that Sulley is just clowning around as he tries to fend off his invisible foe. Mike finally gets annoyed with the fact that Sulley is not listening to him and throws a snowball at Sulley, but it hits Randall instead, exposing him to the two partners, making them realize that Randall had been attacking Sulley. Randall is defeated after a chase through the factory, where he and Boo escape into a door and Boo begins to pull on his antennas and hit him with a baseball bat, making him turn into different colors. Sulley then restrains him with a chokehold, followed by a snake wrestling maneuver, and throws him through a door that banishes him to a trailer in the middle of a swamp in the south, where a
   hillbilly family
   beats Randall senseless with a shovel, thinking he is a gator. The door's light is shattered by Sulley and then tipped over the railing it was leaning against and shatters onto the floor far below, trapping Randall. Sulley congratulates Boo for beating him and she then blows a raspberry in his direction.
  </p>
  <p key="b8f3b044-5a11-47d2-8fc9-4576447b1574">
   Afterwards, Sulley and Mike expose Mr. Waternoose of Randall's plan to the
   CDA
   , thereby getting Waternoose arrested and foiling their plan once and for all. Mike retold the events of the film in his play
   , exposing Randall's conspiracy to the public; The audience watching the play are seen booing against this depiction of Randall, indicating that his reputation has been permanently tarnished by his crimes. Fungus is noticeably much happier after Randall's absence and still works as a respected employee at Monsters Inc.

   Randy is first seen when Mike arrives to his new room. The two greet each other, but Randy, startled by objects falling in the background, disappears. Mike suggests that he should use that power more often, to Randy's shock. He soon follows Mike's advice of getting rid of his glasses because they don't disappear whenever he turns invisible, thus giving him his characteristic squint. Randy is worried about school and wonders if he'll manage to impress the cool kids, but Mike reassures him. He follows Mike and sits next to him on their first day of class.

   Later, while Mike is studying scaring, Randy decided to bake cupcakes for a party organized by the cool kids. At the party, Randy tries to offer cupcakes to some girls that were in

   Archie the Scare Pig
   , splattering four of the cupcakes on Randy that spelled "LAME" on his face, much to his dismay.

   During the last part of the Scare Games, Sulley accidentally ruins Randy's attempt to scare the child dummy, as his roar is so strong that it makes him fall onto a carpet and change into a humiliating pattern of pink with red hearts (similar to a pair of cartoon boxer shorts). Due to this, his scare is weak and ineffective, giving him a poor score (7.5 points out of 20), with the OKs being tied with the Roar Omega Roar because of this. Randy swears revenge on Sulley as he is criticized by the fraternity and presumably kicked out afterwards.
