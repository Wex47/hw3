   <i key="3a842b1f-5f04-487f-a087-fec0f193e67e">

   </i>
   , where two nurses,
   George
   and
   A.J.
   , from
   Shady Oaks Retirement Village
   knock on
   Carl
   's door to escort him to the nursing home. As seen in the movie, Carl instead, takes off in his house. George and A.J. stare dumbfounded at the sky while their van's alarm goes off (it had been bumped by Carl's house).
  </p>
  <p key="3ba40ccb-9fa0-4c1a-b4d4-b8671c2770ca">
   The next day, a news reporter does a story about sightings of a floating house. She attempts to get George and A.J.'s opinion, but they are still in shock. Meanwhile other senior citizens around the city, including at Shady Oaks, are watching the news report and learn that Carl has "escaped". A week later George and A.J. are back at their task of escorting elderly citizens to Shady Oaks in their van. Unfortunately, the seniors have got ideas from what Carl did and every time George and A.J. come to a house to take a person away, the senior living there escapes with their house somehow, setting off the car alarm in the process.
  </p>
  <p key="17c59b46-34fa-4154-8020-4f677018b675">
   Finally, George and A.J. arrive back at the Shady Oaks Retirement Village, only to find an old man outside the door who yells, "So long, suckers!" and hits his cane against one of many canisters attached to the outside of the building; the other canisters soon follow and spew out a powerful gas. After the man goes inside, the entire building launches into the sky. Still dumbstruck, George and A.J. stare up. A few canisters fall down, and one lands on their van, setting off its alarm again. Suddenly, from behind them, a giant blimp starts to descend. It turns out to be
   Charles F. Muntz
   's
   Spirit of Adventure
   dirigible and Carl is flying it, with
   Russell
   next to him. The airship lands on top of the van, effectively stopping its alarm and Carl and Russell climb out. George incredulously says,"Mr. Fredricksen?" They walk past the nurses and Russell says that next time he'd like to steer. A.J. turns to George and says: "That was the craziest thing I've ever seen!". They look down to find
   Dug
   in front of them. Dug says, "Hi there!" through his collar, and George and A.J. are even more shocked than before.

    In this short movie, Russell is seen bracing himself underneath the floorboards of Carl's house. While this attempts to explain how Russell ended up on Carl's porch later in the movie, Russell is not seen underneath Carl's house when it takes off in the movie. Additionally, if Russell were really in the position shown in the short, he would have no reason to hang on to the house in the first place. Instead, he could have just let it rise and he would have been left safely on the ground.
