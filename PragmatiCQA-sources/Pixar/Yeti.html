   , he was first mentioned along with the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot by Mike Wazowski as the monsters who were banished to the human world, and Mike feared that he and Sulley might be next. When Mike Wazowski and Sulley get banished to the the Himalayas by Waternoose, the Yeti greets them and makes them feel as comfortable as possible in his cave. He also shows himself to be something of a comedian, such as when he mentions about his friend Bigfoot, who has called himself "King Itchy." When he mentions something about a local village at the bottom of the mountain, Sulley suddenly demands the Yeti to tell if there are any kids in that village so that he will be able to sneak back into the Monster World. However, although the Yeti confirms that human children do indeed inhabit the village, he also warns that it takes three days to hike down to the village. He also advises Sulley against going out in a blizzard, but Sulley, still wanting to rescue
   the human child
   he accidentally let into the Monster World, sets out anyway.

   encounters the Yeti after accidentally activating and traveling through his banishment door. Finding Tylor unconscious in the snow, the Yeti hangs him upside down from the roof of his cave, before cutting him down with a chainsaw that he uses for ice carving. He eagerly anticipates the younger monster joining him as a cave mate, and becomes even more excited when

   Tylor persuades the Yeti to go back through the door to get snow cones for Mike and Sulley, while really intending to leave him trapped in the human world again.

   The Yeti is a monster who worked at Monsters, Inc. until he got banished (presumably for tampering with mail) to the Himalayas. Despite being banished, he likes living in the human world and has a general wish of making other banished monsters feel welcome with him. This is shown when he does his best to keep Mike and Sulley warm and sheltered when they were banished to the Himalayas. He is also somewhat of a comedian, such as when he tells Mike and Sulley the story of how his friend Bigfoot made a diaper out of poison ivy and nicknamed himself "King Itchy" when he got banished.
