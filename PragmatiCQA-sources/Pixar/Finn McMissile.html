      Finn McMissile is a master British spy. Though charming and eloquent, it's his stealth maneuvering, intelligence and years in the field that enable him to thwart unexpected attacks from bad guys, making quick daredevil escapes. Finn's design is sleek and timeless, but he's also prepared for any tricky situation with an arsenal of ultra-cool gadgets and weaponry, including front and rear grappling hooks, a missile launcher, deployable magnetic explosives and a holographic disguise emitter. As a seasoned professional in the game of international espionage, Finn believes there is a conspiracy brewing during the World Grand Prix. His clandestine work surrounding the global exhibition race puts him on a collision course with Mater, whom he mistakes for an undercover American agent with a genius disguise.

In fact, the Americans found it first and sent an agent in under deep cover and had managed to take a photograph of the car behind this. Unfortunately, Finn spots Professor Z in the crowd and sent Holley to make the rendezvous with the American agent. However, they mistake

   The next day, at Tokyo airport, McMissile pulled Mater aside to a lounge disguised as a security guard. Dropping his disguise, he formally introduced himself and asked Mater if he was with the FBI or CIA. As Mater boasted on about his own karate skills, McMissile noticed on a camera he dropped outside the lounge that
   Acer
   and
   Grem
   were approaching. He cuts a hole in the window and drags Mater outside, where they are picked up by

   Once safely in the air, Holley pulled off Mater the device containing the intel on who was behind this scheme. All that they find is a picture of an engine, which Mater identifies as the worst engine ever built. However, the picture did not shed much light on who the car was. Luckily, Mater noted from the background that this car had most of his parts replaced and his replacements are factory original and thus not easy to come by. Thus, they go to Paris to meet with a black market contact of Finn's,

   . Apparently, the buyer from the photo is never seen and had been buying a lot of parts, which Mater deduces must be for a lemon car. Putting together that the Pacer, Gremlin, Trunkov and Hugo lemon models are working together under their mystery boss, they then head to
   Italy
   to spy on the gathering. They have Mater infiltrate the meeting holographically disguised as

   The trio are brought to

   to be crushed by gears. Mater then laments that he's a fool. Finn tried to reassure him that he's a good spy, but Mater shouted that he's not a spy; Finn and Holley realise he's talking seriously. As the final race began, Acer and Grem attempt to kill

   's organic fuel. Professor Zundapp then orders them to switch to the backup plan, in which a bomb planted in McQueen's pit would go off once he returns there. Once the Lemons had left the room, Mater manages to get free by drawing out his machine guns which cuts the rope setting him free. Though he wanted to help McMissile and Holley, they insists that he evacuate the pits, insisting that they would be okay; that was a white lie as Mater wouldn't had left otherwise. As Finn remarks that being killed by a clock gives a whole new meaning to "Your time has come", giving Holley an idea to use her taser beam on the clock's power motor box to send the gears in reverse rotation. A large thinner gear then slices their ropes, setting both of them free.

   As the pair turn to leave, they spot Mater's discarded air filter and they realize that the Lemons have lied to them. Finn warns Mater over the radio that the bomb was actually on him. McMissile pursues and captures Professor Z and orders him to deactivate the bomb inside Mater. Unfortunately, the bomb can only be deactivated by a voiceprint and Professor Z was not it. They are then surrounded by the Lemons, only for the Radiator Springs residents to come to their rescue. Mater then dragged McQueen to Buckingham Palace. As everyone got into a panic over the bomb, McMissile drove up to diffuse the situation. Mater then accused

He is able to prove his accusations as Axlerod hastily deactivates the bomb at the last second before popping his hood, showing the very engine from the photo.

   and created an English coupe with Italian touches."
   Finn is a Pixar in-house design. His design draws inspiration from several sports cars from the 1960s, mainly British, but also Italian.  
Shuster said: “We didn’t want to design Finn as a spy. We wanted him to be a really elegantly designed English sportscar from the sixties. We did this really deep search into that kind of car from that era. We took everything from all the cars we love and baked it into Finn.”
   Shuster said about using Italian cars for Finn's design: “We wanted to infuse a little more Italian into that. That’s why I created a rear hip, which gave that fin a place to live.”

   Jay Ward
   said.
  </p>
  <p key="d8a5c24a-2073-4f3d-be0b-c7d06e62112e">
   The only car model that Pixar has named as an inspiration for Finn is the 1958 Peerless GT, a British sports car, which was the only British sports car they found that featured tailfins.
   According to Ward, even though Finn draws inspiration from other cars as well, the Peerless served as the basis from which the character was built.

  <p key="e7a0df0d-769a-4f56-b454-bd9f41652086">
   Finn has a large resemblance with James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 from

   .
   While Finn shares similarities with the DB5, like a near identical rear end, differences can also be seen, mainly in Finn's profile design, which is more curvaceous than the DB5. Finn's submarine mode is also reminiscent of Bond's Lotus Esprit from

  <p key="4c9cedaa-abb3-4565-bd1d-2ae50d2219d8">
   The animators felt it necessary to establish limitations of what Finn could do and what gadgets he had, in order to make a more earthbound character.
   Shuster says he found Finn to be (with
   <a href="Francesco Bernoulli.html" key="80ff0c74-65cf-476c-a93a-66318d64ebcd" title="Francesco Bernoulli">

   ) the hardest design to achieve, because they had to figure out where to place his spy gear. Solving this problem had some influence on his design: Finn's side vents were modified so that machine guns could get out, and his bumperettes were made with the idea they could serve as grappling hooks.
   Regarding how Finn would deploy his gadgets, Shuster said:
"It was decided that no, we don’t want him transforming. We don’t want body panels unnaturally unfolding or doing all that stuff... So that was the trick, designing the outer shell as though he is just a normal pedestrian car, and then we went in and found places we could have stuff unfold from."

   According to Story Supervisor
   Nathan Stanton
   , the idea of having Michael Caine voicing Finn McMissile came out early in the production.

   </a>
   said: “As we were developing Finn McMissile, Michael Caine always came to mind because of all those fantastic spy movies he’s done.”
   However, Shuster says: “For the majority of these characters I didn’t know until the very end [who was voicing them]. Honestly, they announced Michael Caine when [the character] was done and all that the animators could do to go back in and start dialing in the mouth shapes and the eye shapes.”
   Supervising animator
   Shawn Krause
   collected photos of Caine from his earlier spy films and based Finn's expressions on them.
