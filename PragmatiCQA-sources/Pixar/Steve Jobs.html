   On October 5, 2011, Jobs' family made a statement that he "died peacefully today". A copy of his death certificate indicated respiratory arrest as the immediate cause of death, with a "metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tumor", or pancreatic cancer as the underlying cause.
  </p>
  <p key="9273d772-2fc1-462b-8407-81c37fe50aa6">
   Apple released a separate statement saying that Jobs had died. The statement read, "We are deeply saddened to announce that Steve Jobs passed away today. Steve's brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of Steve. His greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family. Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts."

   Also on October 5, 2011, Apple's corporate website greeted visitors with a simple page showing Jobs' name and lifespan next to his greyscale portrait. Clicking on Jobs' image led to an obituary that read "Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple." An email address was also posted for the public to share their memories, condolences, and thoughts.
