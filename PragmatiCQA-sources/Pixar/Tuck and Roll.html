   Tuck and Roll are Hungarian twin pill bugs. They occasionally argue, but are usually the best of friends. They act as "human" cannonballs in
   P.T. Flea
   's
   circus troupe
   . They are supposed to be the main part of the
   Flaming Death
   act, but their arguing and fighting results in the act going totally out of control and everybody being fired. However, they don't seem to understand this and remain cheerful even at the
   Bug Bar
   . They also appear to like the sound of the phrase: "You're fired!", since they continuously repeat it throughout the film after P.T. Flea says it to them, much to

   Tuck and Roll do not speak or understand English. In fact, the language they speak is in Hungarian. However, they only speak these English words: "Hey!", "Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!", "You're fired!" and "Charge-a!".

    There has always been some confusion as to which character is which, but the set of bean bag dolls of the characters that were made by Disney for the film,
    Disney Pixar Character Encyclopedia
    and Disney Who's Who actually reveal this. Tuck is the one with two eyebrows, and Roll is the one with a unibrow. It's also said that Roll has a deeper voice in the film, while Tuck has a slightly higher tone.

    Despite their name, pill bugs are not insects, but a type of terrestrial crustacean. This makes Tuck and Roll unique among the circus' other members, as the rest of the troupe consists of six insects (Francis, Slim, Dim, Heimlich, Manny, and Gypsy) and one arachnid (Rosie).
