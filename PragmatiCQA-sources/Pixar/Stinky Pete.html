   The Prospector doll has never been opened and according to Jessie, he is still "mint in the box," making him sought after by collectors. He always carries a pick around like a real prospector, and had lived his entire life in a box. Thus, he was greatly valued for still being in mint condition. He spends much time in storage with

   When Woody tries to retrieve his severed arm from Al, Stinky Pete, offscreen and unnoticed by Woody, sneaks out his box and turns on the TV, waking up Al. He places the remote in front of Jessie so that Woody be sure to blame her for the incident while pretending that he doesn't know how it got turned on. After getting repaired, Woody decides to leave the gang for home, but Stinky Pete convinces him make amends with Jessie first. After hearing Jessie's sad story of how she was outgrown and abandoned by her former owner
   Emily
   , Woody decides to stick with the gang to join them in the museum. His decision is further enforced when Stinky Pete tells him that Andy will inevitably outgrow him as well, and if he joins them in the museum, he'll last forever.

   and his friends arrive at the apartment room to save Woody from being sold. Although disappointed by Woody's refusal to rejoin Andy, Buzz leaves Woody to contemplate his decision, saying that he would indeed last forever if he spent eternity behind the museum glass, but the tradeoff is that he would never be loved or played with again. Stinky Pete commends Woody for refusing to leave, but is unable to cheer up Woody, who feels disturbed by Buzz's warning. As Stinky Pete watches Woody, Woody comes to realize his mistake and decides to rejoin Buzz and the others, making Stinky Pete more determined to stop Woody from escaping. When Woody offers to take an uncertain Jessie and an eager Bullseye back home to Andy with him, Stinky Pete refuses the offer and slips out of his box, and traps Woody and the others by shutting the grate leading to an air vent and tightening the screw on it. He then reveals that he was the one who turned on the TV the night before (to sabotage Woody's escape). He then swears that Woody and the gang are going to Japan with him, where they would spend eternity with him in a protected exhibit, away from kids' reach. Woody and Jessie try to stand up to Stinky Pete, only to learn from the Prospector that he was never sold to anyone after he had spent his lifetime on a dime-store shelf and was therefore bitter and resentful. This statement is enough to make Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye feel sorry for him to a certain extent, despite the Prospector's bad actions. Stinky Pete then declares that the museum is his only chance of finally becoming appreciated, and he didn't care what he would have to do to keep Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye with him. When Woody yells for Buzz's help, Stinky Pete discourages Woody by making fun of Buzz Lightyear's name and revealing how much he hated those upstart space toys. Al then arrives and packs his Roundup collection, including Woody, into his case and heads out of his
   penthouse

   At

   , Stinky Pete fights every one of Buzz's attempts to save Woody, who fights back for harming his friend. Stinky Pete reopens an old tear on Woody's arm and offers him a choice of going to Japan together or in pieces, assuring that Woody would be fixed again in Japan. He orders Woody to get back into the case, to which Woody refuses, leaving Stinky Pete no choice but to raise his pickax, getting ready to tear him apart. Suddenly, Stinky Pete gets stunned by flash cameras that Buzz and the other toys had acquired from another luggage. After Buzz grabs him, Stinky Pete warns the toys that they would be tortured by children, abandoned, and end up spending eternity rotting in landfill, but Woody dismisses his delusional beliefs, declaring that he would teach Stinky Pete "the true meaning of playtime" as punishment for his betrayal, and the toys shove him into an off-screen piece of luggage.

   The Prospector ends up in the backpack belonging to a little girl named

Horrified at this thought, Stinky Pete weeps as he is taken to his new owner's home.

   When he first appeared, Stinky Pete was initially a kind, wise, well-spoken, and grandfatherly mentor-like character, giving support and advice to Jessie, Woody and Bullseye throughout the first half of the film. However, this façade simply hid his true nature which was smart, manipulative, sneaky, embittered and evil. This was most likely caused by the years of emotional pain he had endured during a lifetime on a dime-store shelf and not being sold to any children due to their preference of space toys after the launch of Sputnik. Along with the shift of interest to space toys, the fact that this resulted in the TV show,
   <i key="21230d7a-ba44-47be-8365-4599c33acc2b">
    Woody's Roundup
   </i>
   getting cancelled further contributed to his own hatred of space toys and children. Even while he shrouded his true nature, he secretly plotted to prevent Woody from returning to his owner Andy at any cost, sabotaging Woody's escape by secretly turning on the TV to wake Al up and putting the blame on Jessie without hesitation.
  </p>
  <p key="f708e2b7-2644-4bbc-8db8-beb813104b3f">
   When Woody finally decided he would return to Andy and take the other Roundup toys with him despite the warning Stinky Pete gave him about Andy outgrowing and forgetting him, this finally prompted him to snap and reveal his true nature and intentions to the other Roundup toys and Andy's toys. The fact that he was willing to spend an eternity sealed inside a museum away from contact with children also showed that he had developed solitariness traits due to spending most of his time within his box. He was also hypocritical and vicious, as he was willing to harm or tear apart other toys so that his goal of toys escaping harm from children in the eternal museum life would be fulfilled, evidenced by him reopening the old rip in Woody's arm and threatening to tear him apart, despite insisting that Al would have Woody fixed again like he was earlier.
  </p>
  <p key="f85f1d97-0ef5-498d-8d23-1a0e6e138055">
   His own inexperience of being played with by a child, along with hearing Jessie's story of being outgrown by her previous owner Emily lead to him believing that children were only destroyers of toys whose ultimate fate will be spending an eternity rotting in landfills. He also believed that rare, unpopular and collectible toys like him and the other Roundup toys were doomed to either always ending up in storage or remaining unsold to any children similar to his fate before Al found him. These beliefs further motivated his desire to spend an eternity in the museum, accepting that it was the only salvation for all toys.
  </p>
  <p key="90c77d81-4751-4db6-a27a-2c0b39c78761">
   Despite his villainous nature, he appeared to have redeemable traits as the character stated in his online interview after the film that he liked his new owner Amy's face paint decorations even though he initially feared it after Andy's toys placed him in Amy's backpack. This can demonstrate that Stinky Pete was a villain who was wronged by rejection and unappreciation, and that he most likely would not have been evil in the first place if he had been owned by a child to start off with. Furthermore, when he told Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye about he was stuck in his box on a dime-store shelf and none of the kids wanted to buy him when they bought every other toy, this makes them feel sorry for him to some extent.

   , Stinky Pete was a regular recurring sidekick of Woody and Jessie. Though depicted mostly as an accident-prone, stereotypical, buffoonish hillbilly and slapstick comic relief, Pete was established on the show as an overall good-natured friend and ally of Woody, Bullseye and Jessie. Al's Stinky Pete seemed embarrassed by his cartoon counterpart's goofy personality.
