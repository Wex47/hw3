   , it is first believed that Allinol is the result of
   Miles Axlerod
   's researches to find the renewable, clean-burning energy source of the future. He claims it's the fuel that everybody should be using. To promote his new product, he organized the
   World Grand Prix
   , a large scale competition where all racers run on Allinol.
  </p>
  <p key="efa23388-09af-4168-ae0d-5cd5f760ee77">
   It is later revealed Allinol is in truth gasoline engineered to boil, expand, and eventually explode, should it come into contact with an electromagnetic pulse. While falsely claiming that Allinol was safe for most of the film, Axlerod actually used it as the key part of his plan to turn the world against alternative energy and have cars rely on gasoline due to him and his
   lemon henchmen
   owning the largest untapped
   oil reserves
   in the world. Allinol can be lethal for a car if the level of radiation is sufficient, and as such it is used to torture and kill
   Rod Redline
   .
  </p>
  <p key="1b3ab7ae-2e08-468b-a9eb-9a6bb1d4825a">
   It was revealed in the end Allinol was actually regular gasoline, and Axelrod altered it so it would explode, so he could sabotage his own race to discredit all alternative fuels and force users to go back to using oil substances.
  </p>
  <p key="8eb873ce-141e-4b42-ae99-25a8988b6e98">
   Allinol's mascot is
   Globie
   , a car-ified globe with wheels and a windshield.

  <p key="ccf19b4f-e95c-4050-8846-f04fc97c936a">
   What happened to Allinol after Axlerod was exposed is unknown. It is possible that the fuel was never used anymore because of its original use.

    The Allinol logo is a modified version of the logo used in The Land pavilion at Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center from
    1982

    The fact that Allinol is used in endurance racing is likely a reference to the recent introduction of alternative fuels to the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the American Le Mans Series. Some of the Le Mans Prototypes use alternative fuels in the ALMS as a part of the Green X Challenge championship. Also, in
    2014
    , Formula One car engines were made more environmentally-friendly and fuel-efficient.
