   Mr. Huph is cold-blooded, callous, stingy, strict, and self-centered. As the boss of an insurance company, he is more focused on gaining more money than providing customers with the insurance they need. He always seems to have an excuse for getting angry, and only cares about money. He also implies that his methods of denying insurance, in addition to being unethical, were also illegal. When Bob Parr was called into Huph's office for a dressing down, Parr asked if Huph was saying Insuricare employees should not help their subscribers. Huph said no, citing the law required him to.
  </p>
  <p key="a2b143c1-8feb-41a0-8d6f-15fc71eed4d6">
   Huph has no concern for anybody's well-being other than his own, as shown when he stopped Bob from helping a man getting mugged with the threat of being fired. He is obsessed with bureaucracy, furious when customers use loopholes to circumvent various technically legit methods of denying the claims of insurance. However, he was ultimately forced to admit this when calling Bob to his office and questioned about whether Bob's actions were illegal when they were ultimately legal.

   He is always annoyed that Bob keeps authorizing insurance policies to different clients (which are rightfully claimed) and reprimands him for "writing checks to every Harry Hardluck and Sally Sobstory that gives [him] a phone call". Mr. Huph calls Bob to his office to lecture him about his conflicting ideals. Bob then sees a man being mugged through the window and tries to alert Mr. Huph to the crime, but when Huph sees what is going on he snidely remarks that he hopes the crime victim did not subscribe to Insuricare. A displeased Bob tries to go and save him, but Huph angrily threatens to fire him if he leaves his office. However, that is a moot point as the
   mugger
   gets away scot-free. Mr. Huph then tries to tell Bob that he was close to losing his job,

   but Bob (enraged that he failed to stop a crime by Huph's selfish and callous attitude) brutally grabs him by the throat, angrily choking him, and throws him through five office walls that nearly killed him, shocking various workers who all look towards Bob in bewilderment.
  </p>
  <p key="c53cd254-a705-4201-a768-5eeb0d26b3eb">
   Huph is then hospitalized and (presumably) mind-wiped by Agent
   Rick Dicker
   . Luckily for Mr. Huph, he survives and tells Rick that Bob is fired.

    On the "October

    WDW Pin Releases" website, there is a pin called "Boss's 2005 Day", where Bob is in Mr. Huph's office giving a present to his boss (whose arm is in a sling, presumably after the freak accident he had in the movie) for Boss's Day 2005. The words said "Bob Parr is presenting a gift to Mr. Huph for Boss's Day 2005. Remember your boss in 2005 with this unique Limited Edition pin featuring characters from
