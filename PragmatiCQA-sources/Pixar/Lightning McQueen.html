   Before getting into
   Radiator Springs
   , Lightning McQueen is flashy, brash, and supremely confident and had a lot of drive. A real whiz on the track, he's determined to race to victory on his first attempt in the prestigious
   Piston Cup
   . Lightning loves all the attention and adulation that comes with being famous. He has his eyes on a new lucrative sponsorship deal with
   <a href="Dinoco.html" key="79824685-e703-4399-a802-52844a894183" title="Dinoco">
    Dinoco
   </a>
   , which would replace his current deal with second-rate rust removal ointment Rust-eze. For Lightning, this would mean more money, fans, free helicopter rides, and even more fame.
  </p>
  <p key="4080b05e-ecb5-4a94-a2f6-3e9a3dfa05c5">
   Since the race track is always so well lit, Lightning McQueen isn't equipped with any headlights. Instead he wears a pair of fake headlight stickers. Lightning takes a dim view of those cars who find this fact absolutely hilarious.
  </p>
  <p key="569c34b3-9e24-4507-bc2d-ea20ac358de2">
   Although Lightning McQueen finds his lifestyle a real gas, deep down something is not quite right. Concentrating so much on winning has cost him all of his support team, and he has no real friends apart from his loyal driver truck,
   Mack
   . Often lapsing into daydreams, Lightning doesn't seem to know how to enjoy the here and now.

   After getting into Radiator Springs, his time in the town has taught him what's really important, like true friends. Lightning values time with his girlfriend,
   Sally Carrera
   , and his friends, especially Mater, in Radiator Springs. He learned most of what he knows about racing from the late great

Weathers advises that he needs a good crew and a good chief behind him. Lightning's attention drifts towards getting the

    Doc Hudson

   Sally Carrera
   shows up and Lightning is immediately taken with her. Sally convinces Doc that fixing the road is the best thing for the town, so Lightning is sentenced to fix the road using a road paving machine named
   Bessie
   . Lightning attempts to escape, but Sheriff siphoned his fuel while he was in the impound, forcing him to stay.
  </p>
  <p key="84699544-a47e-444a-92fa-629d99b1127c">
   Lightning is so desperate to leave that he runs Bessie at full speed. This results in a bumpy and uneven road. Doc makes a wager with him: if Lightning can beat him in a one lap race around
   Willy's Butte
   , then he wins his freedom; if he loses, he has to scrape off the botched asphalt and start over. Lightning immediately leaves Doc - who does not even move - in the dust. He fails to make a hard left turn in the dirt and winds up in a cactus patch, costing him the race. As he resumes paving, Lightning is so miserable that he refuses the town when they offer him anything. Doc takes pleasure in his suffering for some reason.

  <p key="fd47361c-1721-4b68-b1b4-0137fa4acbd0">
   On the second day, the town sees that Lightning finished about a third of the road. Doc meets with Sheriff at Willy's Butte to find Lightning trying to make the hard left turn he couldn't do. Doc sends Sheriff away and advises Lightning on making the turn. Lightning does not get the advice and winds up in another cactus patch. Later on,
   Guido
   fixes a slow leak in his tires and spins them to get rid of any cacti as a thank you for paving the road so well.

   then hoses him off on Sally's orders. She offers him to stay the night at the
   Cozy Cone Motel

   Frank
   . On their way back, Mater teases him about his feelings for Sally and then shows off his incredible backwards-driving skills. Mater inquires about Lightning's big race and learns about the Dinoco sponsorship Lightning wants. Lightning mentions that it would come with access to helicopters which gets Mater to ask for a helicopter ride if he gets the deal. Lightning says he would get him a ride which leads Mater to say he made a good choice in picking Lightning as his best friend, a gesture he is touched by. Sally overheard that, telling Lightning that Mater trusts him, implying he should not take that lightly.

To his surprise he finds three Piston Cups and a newspaper article revealing that Doc Hudson is really the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, a three-time Piston Cup champion and record holder for the most wins in a single season. Doc finds him and kicks him out, saying the trophies are "a bunch of empty cups." Lightning tells the rest of the town about Doc but they laugh at the idea. Sally shows up and fills up his tank, asking him to take a drive with her. For a moment, Lightning considers making a run for it, but he follows Sally.

   and the rest of the town. She fell in love with the place and moved there. Sally explains that
   Route 66
   was the main road around there and Radiator Springs was a popular tourist stop. All that changed when
   Interstate 40
   was built forty years prior, bypassing the town and causing both the town and the highway to fall off the map entirely. She hopes that they will get it back on the map one day.

   After McQueen returns to the town, multiple tractors come stampeding in. Lightning goes off to round up a stray heading towards Willy's Butte. He unexpectedly finds Doc wearing his racing tires showing off his skills. Doc uses a technique called drifting to make the turn Lightning couldn't do.

   Lightning then confronts Doc as to why he would quit at the top of his game. Doc corrects him showing him a newspaper article of a major crash he suffered in 1954 in the final lap of the Piston Cup finals. After missing an entire season he returned only for his sponsors to turn their backs on him in favor of the next rookie in line. Doc vowed never to go back, which explains why he wanted Lightning thrown out. Lightning claims he is not like those who turned their backs on him but when Doc presses him on a time he thought about anyone besides himself, he cannot answer. Doc does not want the townsfolk depending on someone like him, but Lightning retorts that Doc is no better by hiding the truth about his past. Doc only tells him to finish the road so he can leave.

Mack arrives too and apologizes for losing him. Before he leaves, Sally thanks him for everything, wishing him luck in the race. Lightning gets into Mack's trailer but he is sad to leave, having bonded with everyone in Radiator Springs. Sally is angered to learn that it was Doc who tipped off the press about Lightning. Doc says it is best for everyone, but Sally can clearly see that Doc had done it for himself, proving Lightning right about his selfishness.

   The day of the race arrives. Lightning prepares for the race with Mack is his pit crew. Lightning has troubles as he cannot stop thinking about Sally and Radiator Springs, causing him to lose a lap. He then gets a surprise when he hears Doc - who is wearing his old racing colors - acting as his crew chief. Most of the town is there serving as his pit crew while Sally, Red, and Lizzie stayed behind to watch in town. With renewed focus, Lightning starts to make up the lost lap. He makes good use of backwards driving to overcome Hicks' dirty tactics. Lightning suffers a flat tire but Guido makes a record-breaking pit stop to get him back out there in time to beat the pace car. Hicks again plays dirty by knocking him onto the grass but the drifting technique allows Lightning to take the lead in the final lap.

   McQueen is on the verge of winning the Piston Cup. However, an angry Hicks who refuses to finish behind King again, violently kicks him out, which causes King to suffer a major crash. Lightning was about to win, but after seeing the King crash onscreen, he realized that the same thing that happened to Doc will happen to him. So, McQueen stopped at the finish line after this, but he allowed Chick Hicks to pass through. He reverses and pushes The King across the finish line so he can end his career with dignity. The crowd erupts in cheers for the two racers. Hicks is condemned by the fans and the media. The King's wife
   Lynda
   kisses Lightning in gratitude for what he did for her husband. Lightning is praised for his good sportsmanship so much that

   Rust-eze
   sponsors as they had given him his big break. Tex respects his decision and says that he will be willing to do a favor for him. Lightning cashes in that favor by arranging for Mater to have a helicopter ride.

   Lightning then decides to establish his racing headquarters in Radiator Springs, putting the town back on the map. Lightning gets a new look, which is Ramone's custom job but with the Rust-eze logo, his racing tires, and a circular black and white 95 logo. He meets with Sally at the Wheel Well, telling her he missed her. They start a relationship as they race back to Flo's. Doc takes him under his wing, showing him some new tricks.

   The show begins with Mater telling Lightning what he used to be and did in the past. However, Lightning never believes Mater (as he was not there), and whenever he asks Mater if the stories really happened, Mater will always say, "Don't you remember? You was there, too!". Then, Mater continues the stories, including Lightning's sudden participation. The episodes end with Mater leaving, often followed by the characters and/or references from Mater's stories, implying that the stories might be real. Here, Lightning is often shown getting hurt or getting some other predicament (such as being chased by bulldozers and being trapped in a burning building) in some of Mater's stories, although not always.

All of his friends excitedly greet him, but none so more than Mater, eager to have a fun-filled summer with him.

However, Mater suddenly pretends to be a waiter at

The two get the hang of the exercises. While night driving, Lightning's suit gets torn off by the trees, giving him back his original racing colors.

   During this, Lightning and Cruz watch old footage of Doc's races. They see that he used the drafting technique to gain speed and see him use the barricade to flip over another car who tried to ram him into the wall. On their final day of training, Lightning manages to pull ahead on the speedway, but Cruz still wins. They have to head to Florida for the race.

This doesn't sit well with Lightning, who hears the conversation, and wants her back. After a wreck occurs, Lightning makes the call that Cruz will finish the race for him. She is quickly prepared by Ramone, Luigi, and Guido while Mater keeps Sterling away. Cruz officially joins the race with the #95 but she's nervous. Lightning relays advice to her but takes over as her crew chief. Cruz puts all the training to great use and makes it near the top. While Storm is in first, he purposely falls back to second place as Cruz makes it to third place. He resorts to psychological warfare against her but Lightning tells her Jackson Storm sees her as a threat or he wouldn't be using such tactics.

   Everyone congratulates her on the win. Sterling then reverses fields and tries to convince Cruz to race for him, but she turns him down flat. Tex makes her an offer to be the next racer for Dinoco, which Cruz accepts. Lightning is declared a co-winner since he started the race with the #95. Lightning decides he wants to keep racing, but he has something to do first.

   Back in Radiator Springs, Cruz now sports the Dinoco logo as well as the #51, carrying on Doc's legacy. Lightning has been painted the same blue shade as Doc and now brands himself as the "Fabulous Lightning McQueen", becoming her crew chief. Rust-Eze has been bought by Tex as well. In a way, Lightning has achieved an old dream of racing for Dinoco. With all their friends watching, the two have a race around Willy's Butte.

   Lightning started out as an arrogant, selfish, and conceited racecar who felt he did not need any help to win races. He was unsatisfied with having the small and unglamorous
   Rust-eze
   as a sponsor, intended to ditch them for Dinoco the first chance he got. When asked about his tie-breaker race and who he wanted to give his free tickets to, it dawned on him that he did not have any friends. After winding up in Radiator Springs by accident, he starts to lose his less desirable traits as he forms a bond with the town and its residents. He was very touched when Mater saw him as his best friend and grateful to Sally for offering him a place to stay at her motel.

   As a racecar, Lightning is very talented, gutsy, and confident. He strives to be the best at what he does as evidenced when he tries to make a proper turn on dirt. By the time of his tie-breaker race he has changed into a more kind and caring individual using what he learned in Radiator Springs to gain the advantage. Lightning willingly forfeits the Piston Cup and decides to admit defeat so that
   Strip Weathers
   could finish his last race, having realized what is really important in life.

   Smokey
   , he understands that can never be faster than Storm, but can be smarter than him. By the end of the film, McQueen seems to understand his speed limits, and decides to keep racing by training Cruz Ramirez, whom he realized has what it takes to be a racer. He temporarily took a break from racing and he trained Cruz Ramirez for sometime. After Cruz became good at racing, McQueen continued, but it is unknown when McQueen continued racing. He still races on the Piston Cup circuits today and is winning most of his races.

    Lightning McQueen is unique among other Pixar protagonists, as he does both lose and then win; he gave up the Piston Cup to Chick Hicks so he can help The King finish his last race, but the loss was meant as a lesson for him, as he learned from Doc Hudson that there are more important things in life than winning, and his heroic act made him earn applause from his fans. Therefore, despite losing, McQueen is still considered the winner in the eyes of his fans and his new friends from Radiator Springs due to the actions of Chick Hicks.
