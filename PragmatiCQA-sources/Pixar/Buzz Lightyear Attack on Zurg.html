   flying very quickly towards
   Zurg's
   planet in Gamma Quadrant, Sector 4. Upon landing on Zurg's planet almost immediately, he finds himself surrounded by thousands of Zurg's robots, who are readying their weapons. Instinctively, Buzz fires his laser at a crystal, reflecting his laser in many directions, piercing through all the robots at once and destroying them in a massive explosion in large green fireballs, making the resulting explosions throw Buzz into the air and back down to the ground on his stomach. He then has to get up and run out of the way as a few destroyed robot heads land all around him. Next, Buzz encounters, and destroys, a small camera-like robot peering out of a trap door. Suddenly, the ground he is standing on reveals itself to be a very large hole that leads to a dark pit inside Zurg's fortress. Buzz jumps inside, and activating his glow-in-the-dark function, runs through the dark tunnel, completely oblivious that Emperor Zurg was tracking Buzz's location inside his control room.

   Zurg then activates the levers, and Buzz is caught by surprise when the tunnel suddenly lights up. A wall with deadly spikes appears behind him and quickly charges toward him. In a style similar to

   , Buzz runs away from the pursuing spiked wall and jumps through the closing doors in front of him. Finding himself inside a catacomb, Buzz sees a AA battery that indicates it being a source of Zurg's power. Approaching cautiously, he jumps on the bridge of floating discs, but the bridge collapses, sending him falling into the bottomless pit below. Activating his anti-gravity servos on his attached utility belt, Buzz flies up towards a platform next to the now-gone bridge. He reaches for the battery, which turns out to be merely a hologram, which disappears as Emperor Zurg himself suddenly rises up on some kind of elevator behind him.

   Zurg stars firing his ion blaster at Buzz, but the latter blocks it with one of the discs from the now-gone bridge. Buzz reflects the shots back at Zurg, but misses. Buzz jumps at the other side of Zurg, but before he could fire his laser, Zurg shoots first, and vaporizes the upper half of Buzz's body, killing him and ending the game. Zurg then laughs maniacally on his triumph over Buzz as the words GAME OVER appear on the TV screen with stereotypical 8-bit music, revealing that it's a video game

   Rex, being such a fan of the video game, is frustrated to losing to Zurg again, and falls into despair, claiming that he has no chance of ever defeating Zurg. Buzz assures him that he will, but then Rex complains that due to the size of his small arms, he can't make the video game Buzz jump and press the "fire" button at the same time. Despite this, Rex feels he is as prepared as possible, given his experiences on the video game, so he volunteers to join Buzz and a few other toys to rescue
