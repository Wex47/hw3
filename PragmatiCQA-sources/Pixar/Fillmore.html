   Fillmore is an aging hippie whose heart has never really left the 1960s. Operating on flower power as well as gas, Fillmore thinks there should be more peace in the world. The only vehicle in town with tie-dye mud flaps and an interest in automotive yoga, Fillmore often spars with
   Sarge
   . Although they are different cars, really the guys are similar in character and have a lot of affection for each other.
  </p>
  <p key="1fcda10c-5ca9-4291-86eb-7a1ad966203d">
   Fillmore tries to get everybody to taste his organic fuel. He thinks it is a government conspiracy that there isn't more interest, while Sarge just thinks it's "Freak Juice."
  </p>
  <p key="0e55ca57-b128-418c-8433-08ebaaf321f9">
   Fillmore believes in love and distrusts all forms of authority. He has a conspiracy theory for every occasion, but especially for why the major oil companies haven't switched over to ecologically friendly organic fuel.

  <p key="dd782a24-1f78-4447-9aa5-03cc7240aced">
   Fillmore built his tie-dyed geodesic dome to a 1960s design. His free-flowin' backyard is the complete opposite of his neighbor Sarge's tidy hut and garden.
  </p>
  <p key="52ab3bd4-86e2-427f-b5ff-2151dd7f5ff7">
   Fillmore is a lover of the natural world. He lets his garden grow "naturally" and believes in recycling. he made the wind chime above his gate from old mufflers and the peace sign from one of his old tires.

   "Fillmore is
   Radiator Springs
   ' resident hippie. A believer in individuality and all things natural, he brews his own organic fuel and preaches its many benefits. Visitors can try Fillmore's special flavors in the tasting room behind his love-bead and tie-dye-covered geodesic dome. His many conspiracy theories and "naturally" unkempt yard drive his neighbor Sarge absolutely crazy."
  </p>
  <p key="beed9379-0ec5-45dc-a885-bd0a1df220d0">
   Fillmore is a 1960 Volkswagen bus with psychedelic symbols and liberal/environmental bumper stickers on his body (like a hippie). Fillmore is a strong advocate of natural products and makes his living by selling organic fuel behind his neon dome, painted similarly to himself. His lawn is allowed to grow free with no mowing or pruning, and he also creates his own lawn ornaments from scrap. He believes that organic, renewable fuel would be more widespread were it not for a conspiracy involving the major oil companies controlling the government and supposedly not wanting to compete with Fillmore's cheap and plentiful fuel. Fillmore is a fan of Jimi Hendrix, and plays his version of the Star Spangled Banner every morning, much to the frustration of his neighbor
   Sarge
   . Despite their differences and frequent arguing, they appear to be close friends.

   Radiator Springs’ resident hippie Fillmore is an easy-going, peace-loving 1960s Volkswagen van. And as his friend and neighbor Sarge likes to say, “once a hippie, always a hippie.” At his popular shop
   Fillmore's Taste-In
   , Fillmore brews his own fuel, which he sells with Bohemian accessories like tie-dyed mud flaps. But when he learns that the
   World Grand Prix
   will be run exclusively on the alternative fuel
   Allinol
   , Fillmore closes up shop and signs on as the fuel expert for Team
   Lightning McQueen
   .
  </p>
  <p key="409af82e-c4e6-49f6-a9fe-abaafe3f7bc1">
   When McQueen decides to partake in the World Grand Prix, Fillmore joins Mater, Luigi, Guido, and Sarge to be McQueen's pit crew, with Fillmore serving as the fuel expert. In the film, he is mainly seen with Sarge for most of the time, and comments on how the fuel Sarge eats in Italy is organic, much to his annoyance. Due to being a pacifist, Fillmore is not seen during the battle against the lemons in London. He does eventually rejoin his friends but gets scared when he sees British guards about to shoot McQueen and Mater (who has a bomb attached to him). In the end of the film, Fillmore reveals that, despite saying
   Sir Miles Axlerod
   's Allinol is safe during the Italy race, Sarge switches it out for his organic fuel.

   Unlike the last two films, he only serves minor roles, and while he is seen serving as McQueen's pit crew in his races at the beginning and end of the film, he does not serve any roles apart from that. Oddly, when McQueen has his big crash, Fillmore (along with Sarge) does not go over to McQueen's crash site to check on him, despite Mater, Sally, Luigi, and Guido doing so.

He loves nature, and tries to persuade the world in using organic fuel rather than major oils, with this obsessions causing Sarge to call him a "treehugger" in
