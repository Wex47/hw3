   In the film, Flik is an unconventional, inventive ant who is desperate to make a difference to his colony's way of life. He is also sweet to
   Princess Atta
   and has a crush on her, but he has a tendency of making things worse for himself. He does this by accidentally eliminating the pile of food for the

   Learning from Atta that Hopper is horrified of birds, Flik comes up with an idea and tell the circus bugs that they will build a makeshift bird, controlled from the inside, to scare Hopper away, as long as they keep the idea secret from the rest of the colony. The idea goes into motion and, during the process, Flik is shown acting awkwardly around Atta and staring lovingly at her. After the bird is complete, the ants celebrate and Atta thanks Flik for finding the "warrior bugs," getting their antennas tangled. But when the circus troupe's leader,
   P.T. Flea
   , arrives at the island in search for them, Flik's mistake is made public to the colony. A displeased Atta sees Flik through his lies and regrettably has him exiled, this time for good. Downhearted, Flik departs Ant Island with the circus troupe.

   However, Dot catches up with him, and tells him Hopper, who invaded the island with his grasshoppers, will kill her mother,

   , after they have finished gathering food. The circus bugs suggest using the false bird, but Flik says it won't work, much to their shock, and acknowledges that the colony was right to kick him out for being such a screw-up and doesn't want to do anything, believing they will be better off without him, but when Dot brings him a rock and uses his words from the beginning from the film, Flik feels better and is motivated to return to Ant Island, where he, Dot, and
   the Blueberries
   climb aboard the "bird" and take control the model. The plan almost works, but the "bird" misdirects and crashes into the circus wagon, freeing P.T., who sees the "bird" and sets it on fire, prompting Flik to crash-land the "bird."

   to savagely rough Flik up when Flik admits that he is accountable for the mayhem. Despite the injuries he has sustained, in the film's turning point, Flik redeems himself by standing up to Hopper, exposes his plot to kill the Queen, and states how ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers, but are awesome creatures who are strong in number. Flik's speech astonishes every ant in the colony, including Princess Atta. Infuriated by Flik's defiance, Hopper knocks Flik down, giving the blue ant more injuries. Before Hopper can squish Flik, Atta rushes in to stop him, tells him to leave, and helps Flik up, commending him for his courage.

   Inspired by Flik's speech, the ants and the circus bugs take a stand against Hopper's gang and frightens the grasshoppers away. Flik and the other ants seize Hopper and shove him into the circus cannon, but the rain falls, prompting the ants to run for it, but Flik is still wounded and collapses while he’s running. As Atta rushes over to help Flik up, a mortified and vengeful Hopper pops out of the cannon and takes Flik hostage as he flies away afterwards. The circus bugs attempt to give chase, but they are unable to do so as they end up being stuck in a tree. However, Flik is saved by Atta, who he instructs her to take him across the stream to the other side where he has previously encountered the bird. As Atta watches worriedly, Flik faces Hopper, who backs him to the bird's nest and chokes him. As the bird picks up Hopper in its beak, Atta quickly pulls Flik to safety, and they cringe as the bird lowers Hopper into the beaks of its
   chicks

   When spring comes, the circus bugs prepare to leave, and P.T. Flea asks Flik if he is sure he cannot come on a tour with them, to which Flik answers that he belongs to the island, as well as with Atta, who has since made up with him. The circus bugs thank Flik and, along with the ants, applaud at him for his heroism and brilliance. Then Atta approaches Flik and kisses him, choosing him as her mate. Then Flik rushes over to assist
   Heimlich
   , who has emerged out of a cocoon, still a caterpillar, but now with small butterfly wings, into the air. As Flik waves farewell to his friends, he is taken to a tree root by Dot and Atta for a better view.

   Flik is a nerdy, inventive ant who wants to make a difference to his colony's way of life, but has a tendency to make things worse in the process. His inventions include a telescope created by wrapping a blade of grass around a dew drop; an automatic harvester; several items of traveler's gear; and the bird-shaped aircraft used to terrify the grasshoppers. He is friends with Dot and the Circus Bugs, and the Blueberries.

   Flik was also very kind and caring to his friends. He is also kind, sweet, clever, joyful, adorable, fun-loving and handsome. Sometimes, Flik can be scared of Hopper, but he was more than willing to eventually stand up to him which led the other ants on a revolt to stop the grasshopper's bullying once and for all.
