   Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear
   , or Lotso for short, being unwrapped by Daisy during Christmas. The fact that his old friend Lotso was Daisy's favorite failed to slip past Chuckles' eyes because Chuckles claimed that he never saw a toy being more loved by any other kid. He was also a very good friend to
   Big Baby

   Sadly, one day would ultimately put this friendship to an end: one day, while playing with Lotso during a picnic, Daisy had went to eat lunch and accidentally left Lotso, Chuckles, and Big Baby on the ground. After lunch, because she had a fun-filled day and a good lunch, Daisy fell asleep. Because of this, Chuckles, Lotso, and Big Baby were accidentally (purposely as Lotso would put it) left behind. Lotso believed that his old owner Daisy would return for them one day, and they waited for quite some time for her return. After waiting for a long time, and one rainy day, the trio finally gave up waiting until she came, so they

   . When they finally got to her house, it was too late because Daisy had claimed another Lotso bear to compensate for the original Lotso that she had accidentally abandoned. Lotso was heartbroken as a result. Then Lotso, filled with sorrow, had snapped: the jealousy, bitterness and resentful side of him shown, he then decided to leave his former friend. Chuckles had tried to confront Lotso, knowing that his actions were out of anger, and even pointed out to Lotso that Daisy had only replaced him and that she still loved them all. However, this didn't bend Lotso's will at all. Instead he shouted back at Chuckles that she replaced all of them, not just Lotso himself. Chuckles then saw Big Baby's pendant being torn off by Lotso and being dragged away, shouting at Big Baby that Daisy had no love for him anymore. Chuckles then grabbed the pendant and stuffed it in his pocket, the only thing that would have caused Big Baby to see the light because Big Baby still had love for Daisy, that had the inscription "My Heart Belongs To: Daisy" and tagged along with Lotso and Big Baby, begrudgingly.

   Caterpillar Room

    , his voice sounded somewhat different, implying that it likely changed over time. However, it is unknown as to why Chuckles had a silly, high-pitched, clownish voice (performed by an uncredited
    Bob Peterson
    ) when he is mostly heard speaking using
    Bud Luckey
    's primary gruff, reserved, elderly-sounding voice. It could be that his voice sounds more silly when he's happy, and more gruff when he's sad.

    It seemed likely that Chuckles (due to his attachment with
    Daisy
    ) refused to be a lackey of Lotso's during the latter's self-proclaimed rule in the movie.

    When Chuckles got broken (as evidenced by his sad story), even though this is never said in the film, it may be possible that the culprit wasn't one of the kids at Sunnyside. He might have gotten broken by the children in the caterpillar room (since that is where toys get broken and played with violently). When he lifts his right armpit while explaining he was broken, you can see stitching on the right side of his body.
