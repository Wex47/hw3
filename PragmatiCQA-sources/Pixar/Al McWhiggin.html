Buzz initially tried to rescue Woody from the trunk of Al's car, but failed due to losing his grip before he could open the trunk. Despite this, he ultimately gained a few clues: a feather and a glimpse of the license plate LZTYBRN. After deciphering the license plate letters (using

He placed the Round Up gang dolls in a big green box to keep them safe during the flight, even though he made it very clear to the baggage handler that what was inside was very important to him, stating he had a box of cookies on a plane once and they finished off as crumbs.

   Originally, Al was planned to appear in the special, but was cut for timing reasons.
   Disney/Pixar released a deleted scene in storyboard form illustrating this. In this scene, Al is shown wearing his chicken suit, rejoicing as he sees on his laptop he has won the auction for Woody. A news article on the wall indicates that Al's Toy Barn has gone bankrupt, and it is implied he lives at his mother's house. This may not be canon however, since as indicated above, he still has the address of his store in the final film.
