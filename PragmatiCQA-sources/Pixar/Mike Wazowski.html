   Mike Wazowski is first seen as an elementary student attending
   Ms. Graves
   ' class visiting Monsters, Inc. as part of a field trip. During the field trip, Mike tries to get a look at the scare floor but the other students push him aside, telling him he doesn't belong there. Mike walks past the safety line and follows a scarer named
   Frightening Frank McCay
   into the Human World. Mike watches Frank scare a child then follows him back through the door. Frank is not only surprised but impressed with Mike for sneaking in unnoticed, giving him his Monsters University cap. This incident spurs Mike to become a scarer and attend MU.
  </p>
  <p key="bb337ad8-eeb6-46bd-b0b4-4e956aaf09ca">
   On the first day at college, a now 17-year-old Mike's roommate is revealed to be Randall Boggs (his and Sulley's eventual archenemy) who is friendly towards Mike. When he sees Randall's invisibility at work, Mike encourages him to use it more, telling him to lose his glasses which don't turn invisible. While attending Scaring 101 at
   Professor Knight
   's class Mike sees gets his first look at Sulley (Mike's eventual friend), who, despite his natural talent, is lazy and arrogant.
   Dean Hardscrabble
   , the school's headmistress and a famous Scarer then flies into Prof. Knight's classroom and tells all of the students that they all had to complete a final exam at the end of the semester which will determine if they stay in the program. Mike immediately commits to studying hard. Sulley then comes in through the window having stolen
   Archie the Scare Pig
   (rival school
   Fear Tech
   's mascot). Archie steals Mike's hat and runs off. Mike catches him but Sulley gets the credit for it, impressing the
   Roar Omega Roar
   president
   Johnny Worthington III
   and sparking a rivalry between Mike and Sulley. Finally, the two monsters get into an argument and they accidentally knock over Hardscrabble's scare can. Though she is calm about it, she uses the incident to fail Mike, telling him he's not scary. Sulley is also washed out of the program due to his recklessness.
  </p>
  <p key="2f77dad9-6b89-43f0-a49c-5b0bd2f4dfdb">
   Wanting to prove himself, Mike decides to participate in the university's
   Scare Games
   by teaming up with a fraternity made up of rejected monsters called
   Oozma Kappa
   composing of
   Don Carlton
   ,
   Terri and Terry
   ,
   Art
   , and
   Squishy
   . Sensing an opportunity, Mike baits Hardscrabble into accepting a wager: if OK wins, she allows the fraternity into the Scare Program; but if they lose, Mike has to leave MU. Sulley joins the team, which Mike has to accept since they need six 'bodies' and Randall has joined ROR, abandoning Mike. OK only makes it through the Toxicity Challenge because
   Jaws Theta Chi
   was disqualified. Mike then takes charge of the team and instructs them to do as he does. For the next challenge, they have to get through the library without getting the librarian's attention, retrieve their flag, and escape. Sulley's impatience nearly costs them, but Squishy somehow got the flag in the commotion, advancing to the next round. That same night, they are invited to the ROR house for a party, but ROR humiliates them in front of the whole school. Dejected that they are the laughingstock of the whole campus, OK is ready to call it quits, so Mike takes them to Monsters Inc, showing them that they can still become Scarers, if they use their differences to their advantage. This also sparks a change in both Sulley and Mike, and they begin to respect each other.
  </p>
  <p key="57742c1b-6c51-4db1-bac0-1b825e7f9bfb">
   OK trains even harder under Mike's new leadership skills, making it through the next two rounds using their actual talent. OK is pitted against ROR for the final round, in which both teams try to out-scare the other using simulators set to their highest level. On Sulley's suggestion, Mike goes last, pitting him against Johnny. In the simulator, Mike remembers all the scorn and derision towards him in his life, unleashing his frustration in one mighty scare, and with that OK wins the Scare Games to everyone's surprise. Mike later discovers that the simulator was rigged so that Mike would get the highest score. Sulley admits it was him, revealing his lack of confidence in his friend. Furious at this deception and feeling that no one would ever give him a fair chance, Mike decides to go into the human world where he tries to scare a little girl but he finds himself in a summer camp, who teams up with her bunkmates. The other kids don't find him scary, forcing him to run. Minutes later, Sulley arrives to rescue Mike and has to escape from forest rangers who mistake him for a bear. He finds Mike at a lake, sulking over his failure. The two argue, the both of them venting their frustrations. They eventually patch things up with each other and make their way back to the door, but Hardscrabble deactivates it. With the rangers nearby, Mike believes that they can generate enough energy to activate the door from the human world. Using Mike's knowledge of scare tactics, Sulley scares the adults, which not only activates the door but overloads every scream canister in the room, as well as the door itself. Mike and Sulley make it back, but are expelled for their actions.

  <p key="660fedce-fbc5-497a-b1f7-d858ff15e108">
   The two say their goodbyes to their OK brothers, who tell them that Hardscrabble was impressed with their performance in the games and allowed them into the Scare Program. For the first time, Mike doesn't have a plan, yet he states that he's "okay just being okay." Mike gets on a bus to leave MU but Sulley stops him, telling him not to settle for being okay, stating that everything that led to OK joining the Scare Program was due to Mike's efforts. Hardscrabble arrives with the school paper, showing them they made the front page. She tells them that they surprised her, something she believed was impossible. While she can't do anything about their expulsion (despite the fact she's the one who expelled them), she wishes them both luck and tells Mike to "keep surprising people."

   Sulley points out an ad in the paper from Monsters Inc, giving them a chance to work at a Scare company. They start in the mailroom, then get promoted to janitors, kitchen assistants, and then can wranglers. Finally, Sulley enters the company's open tryouts, becoming a scarer with Mike as his assistant. He and Sulley became rookie of the year.

   Mike and Sulley argue and/or fight sometimes; however, it is usually Sulley who annoys Mike first. He is funny, smart, brave, but can sometimes fail to see the obvious in a situation. He has a very strategic mind and is a thinker by nature, arriving at conclusions very fast. He is also kind and has very smooth conversations with his girlfriend, Celia. Additionally, he is sarcastic and charismatic.
  </p>
  <p key="c96bb61e-4225-49aa-ab26-afe540d35d0a">
   Mike is also skilled with words; he has been shown multiple times to come up with witty comebacks to Randall and anyone who gets on his nerves, but can falter if asked a question under pressure.

   Mike is also shown to have a positive outlook in situations that seem disappointing by not acting disappointed but rather happy it happened. This is especially noble when an image of him is covered in some form of media, such as television, magazine covers, and school I.D. cards. An example of this is when he saw that his picture on a magazine cover was blocked by a barcode, his reaction seemed sad at first, but he turned out to be happy he appeared in the cover regardless.

   Unlike Sulley, who needed some adjustment in his personality, Mike didn't change much from his MU days, aside from a boost in his ego. Being insecure and accepting to just being "OK", thanks to Sulley, Mike realized that he also has his good qualities.

      This joke is subverted in the first issue of

      , as at the end of the commercial Fungus produced, Mike's face is in full view while Sulley's is hidden behind the company logo.

    Dean Hardscrabble
    , Mike Wazowski can never become a scarer, so in the original film he ultimately becomes a comedian instead.

      Interestingly, the filmmakers of the prequel wanted to make the fourth grade line a reality, but felt it was necessary for Mike and Sulley's rivalry to work if they just met. So it can be implied that Mike was just making a joke with the fourth grade line. That and what happens in Pixar trailers aren't always canon in the real film.
