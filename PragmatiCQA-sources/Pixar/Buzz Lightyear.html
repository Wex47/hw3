   Buzz Lightyear is a brawny electronic spaceman action figure. He has fair skin, blue eyes, a purple head cap and collar, a clear plastic space helmet with purple buttons on both sides that open or close it. His green torso consists of a light blue sticker with the words "SPACE RANGER" and the Star Command symbol, purple straps connected to it, three oval talk buttons - one blue, one green, and one red, a yellow nametag that says "LIGHTYEAR" above a round red button that pops out purple plastic wings with red and white candy cane lining on the top of each, and green ends with red and green flashing lights. On his back, he has a white jetpack with a purple valve and green triangular accents and two black and yellow stickers - one says, "DANGER", and the other says "JET EXHAUST". His white arms have gray circular elbows and matching spheres on the end of his upper arms with black rings on it. His gloves have purple lines on his knuckles and fingertips and green squares on the back of each. His right arm has a red button on his upper arm with a yellow and black striped sticker that reads "LASER" and a red light on his right wrist. His left arm has a Space Ranger symbol sticker on his upper arm and a communicator sticker in his wrist communicator and "MADE IN TAIWAN" engraved inside on his lid of the wrist communicator. A black bending with a thin green waist. His white spaceman pants have matching collars at the bottom and gray spheres behind his knees and holds his white shoes with green toe accents, purple soles and a black handwriting reading "ANDY" on his right shoe sole.

   climbs up on Andy's bed to see Buzz standing tall on top of it. As Buzz comes to life, he believes that he is a real space ranger and scans the place where he has ended up in and tries to contact Star Command, only for no one to answer, but then catches sight of his ripped cardboard packaging, thinking that his "spaceship" has been damaged. As Buzz tries to report his mission log to his wrist communicator, scans the surrounding "terrain" and doubts if the outside air is breathable, Woody suddenly comes into his view, startling Buzz and causing him to activate his laser on Woody, who introduces himself to Buzz and tries to tell him that he is standing on Woody's place.

   But then, Buzz catches sight of the other toys who have climbed up onto the bed, forcing him to reactivate his laser, but told by Woody that they are harmless creatures, Buzz thanks them for their kind welcome. All the toys, except Woody, are fascinated with the new features of the Buzz Lightyear action figure (buttons that activate his sampled voice, laser and wings). As Buzz shows off his wings, he and Woody have a brief argument over whether or not Buzz can fly, which leads to Buzz demonstrating how he "flies" by jumping off from the bed post, bouncing off a rubber ball, riding down the track on a Hot Wheels car, moving in circles while hanging from the plane suspended from the ceiling until it sideswipes a wall to cause Buzz to be detached from the plane, and finally landing gracefully on the bed. Buzz receives an adoration from the toys, except Woody, who describes that as "falling with style".

   As the days pass, Buzz quickly becomes Andy's new favorite toy, although Buzz believes himself to be the real Space Ranger. This leads to tension with Woody because prior to Buzz's arrival, Woody has been Andy's favorite toy since kindergarten. When Woody angrily confronts Buzz the next day, he accidentally triggers Buzz's helmet to open, causing Buzz to suffocate briefly before realizing that the air is breathable, but Buzz furiously snaps at Woody, warning him that he almost has had Buzz's eyeballs sucked from their sockets as he closes his helmet. He suddenly hears something outside,

The globe then hits a desk lamp, which swings around and hits Buzz, throwing him out the window. Most of the other toys, especially

Woody angrily fights back and furiously jumps on Buzz, angrily knocking him to the ground. As Woody is beating him up angrily, Buzz furiously uses his helmet to defend himself, which immobilizes Woody's hands. As Buzz angrily kicks Woody off of him, the car drives away, leaving them stranded. Buzz tries to report his mission log to his wrist communicator again, which results in a more intense argument with Woody, during which Buzz furiously accuses Woody of delaying his "rendezvous with Star Command" and putting the security of the entire universe at stake. After Woody angrily shouts in exasperation that Buzz is a toy and not a real space ranger, he sees Woody is no help to him, but is convinced by Woody (who has caught sight of a Pizza Planet

The two then hitch a ride to Pizza Planet, but as they enter the restaurant, Buzz, still thinking that he is a real space ranger catches sight of a rocket-shaped game, thinking it is a spaceship promised by Woody that will take him to his "destination."

   The next day, the two are brutally tortured by Sid (evidenced by Buzz having two suction cup darts on his helmet and back), and as they head for the open door out to the hallway (despite Buzz claiming that they don't know what's outside), they are stopped by the mutant toys, prompting Buzz to activate his laser, but nothing happens. As Buzz ponders what is wrong with his laser, Woody suddenly grabs Buzz as a hostage and pushes a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's arm chop up and down repeatedly to fend off the mutant toys and make their way out the door, despite Buzz telling him to stop.

   is playing. From that commercial (as well as a "MADE IN TAIWAN" message inscribed on the lid of his wrist communicator), Buzz has discovered, for the first time, he is a toy, much to his dismay. Dejected, he walks out of the room and down the corridors, then catches sight of a window above the stairs. Despite Woody's voice echoing in his mind "You are a toy! You can't fly!", he nevertheless tries his final attempt at proving he is a Space Ranger by opening his wings and jumping from the top of the stairs, aiming toward the window, only to fall to the bottom of the stairs and sever his left arm in the process, finally realizing that Woody was right all along. There, he is found by Sid's little sister,

When Buzz sarcastically shows him off as "Mrs. Nesbit," Woody tries to make Buzz come to his senses by opening Buzz's helmet, angrily slapping Buzz's head with his severed arm, and politely closing his helmet. As Buzz moans over not being able to fly out of the window, Woody, seeing the window to Andy's room through the window out of Sid's room, pulls Buzz into Sid's room.

  <p key="e88ec56a-f8e0-49da-877f-f3f6f8ec725c">
   However, due to Buzz being depressed that he is a toy, he plays with his severed arm as well as peeling off and crumpling his wrist communicator sticker, and refuses to help Woody in his escape plan, only throwing his severed arm on a desk, right next to Woody (and forcing Woody to fake Buzz being there, but making Andy's toys believe that he has severed Buzz's arm, thus ruining any chance of being rescued). Just then, the mutant toys surround Buzz, prompting Woody to fight them off, only to discover the toys have reattached Buzz's severed arm, stunning Woody. Soon, Sid enters the room with a rocket, and while looking for Woody, he steps on Buzz's laser and tapes the rocket to Buzz's back, claiming how he has always desired to "blow a spaceman into orbit," but is forced to delay his launch due to a sudden rainstorm. Overnight, Woody, who has become trapped in a milk crate due to a toolbox rested on top of the crate, calls for Buzz to free him, and when Buzz doesn't respond, he throws a washer that strikes Buzz's helmet to get his attention. However, Buzz, who has claimed to have started to think clearly for the first time, is

   In the film's turning point, Woody explains to Buzz what being a toy is and why that is better than being a Space Ranger, even going far as describing the features that Buzz has (having wings, glow-in-the-dark, buttons that make him talk, helmet doing the "whoosh" thing), all of which makes Buzz a "cool toy." As Woody, too, falls into depression and finally accepts that he will have no chance of standing up to a Buzz Lightyear action figure, Buzz thinks for a moment, looking at Andy's name written on the bottom of his boot that proves his ownership to Andy and considering everything Woody has told him as he finally discovers that being a toy isn't so bad after all, even as Woody, who's given up, tells Buzz just to go on without him and get back to Andy, he becomes determined to get himself and Woody back in the hands of their owner. He then starts to push the toolbox off the crate and manages to free Woody, but not before catching sight of a

Just then, Sid wakes up and takes Buzz out of the room, prompting Woody to give chase, but Scud has positioned himself in the way, preparing to attack any toy that emerges out of Sid's room. To save Buzz, Woody calls for the mutant toys, who help Woody with his plan to escape safely to Sid's backyard, where they move into their final positions. Woody successfully scares Sid away, warning him to never torture any toys again while saving Buzz from being blown up by Sid.

  <p key="7743fcc9-4e2e-446f-823e-c75bf99d35a5">
   As Woody commends the mutant toys, Buzz calls to Woody to thank him for the rescue. The two toys then shake hands, putting their past rivalry and tensions behind, and their friendship is born. Just then, they hear the sound of Andy's car starting next door, and they rush to catch the car, but Woody has to go back briefly to free Buzz, whose rocket has made him stuck to the fence, causing them both to miss the car. After the moving truck passes over the two, they make a dash for the truck, unaware that Scud has caught sight of them. Buzz has made it onto the truck's bumper, but as Woody begins his climb up to the bumper, Scud catches up with them and tries to pull Woody off the truck, prompting Buzz to leap onto Scud to fight the dog off. Not wanting Buzz to be left behind, Woody opens the truck's back door for a box of Andy's toys and dig into the box to find RC, whom he tosses onto the street and sends to pick up Buzz. While Buzz rides RC with Scud chasing after him, the other toys, thinking Woody is attempting to murder RC, ambush him, causing RC to move around in circles and jump. Buzz finally loses Scud after RC cruises into an intersection in which cross traffic is moving and Scud runs into the intersection, causing cars to swerve and form a circle that entraps Scud. Buzz releases a sigh of relief after losing Scud.

   tries to help them back into the truck, but becomes overstretched due to RC's batteries depleting. After losing grip of Slinky and RC comes to a dead stop, Buzz then realizes the rocket taped behind his back, but to light the rocket, Woody uses Buzz's helmet to focus the sunlight onto the rocket fuse. When he succeeds, Buzz holds onto Woody, who holds onto RC, as they rocket toward the moving truck. Woody manages to toss RC back into the truck (and accidentally impacted straight at Potato Head), just as he and Buzz go skyrocketing into the air. Buzz then releases the rocket by opening his wings, and he and Woody plummet to the ground, but a sudden updraft causes the two to glide gracefully in the air, with Buzz describing it as "falling with style", echoing what Woody has said earlier. The two toys pass over the moving truck and reach Andy's car, where they drop down through the car's sunroof and land in an open box next to Andy, finally making him happy once again, now that he has finally found his favorite toys.

He appears to be a very serious leader, as shown during that night when, after successfully covering two blocks with nineteen left to go, the toys request a rest, and Buzz demands that they will not stop until Woody is safely back in Andy's room. The next day, Buzz and the toys arrive across the street from Al's Toy Barn, but a wall of traffic lies in their way.

   Buzz formulates a strategy to safely cross the road by utilization of traffic cones, dropping them and proceeding under Buzz's commands (indirectly causing a massive pile-up on the street). Arriving at the entrance to Al's Toy Barn, Buzz, after seeing a worker enter the store to ensure that the doors open and close automatically, orders the toys to jump simultaneously on a door sensor mat to trigger the door open, and once inside, Buzz tells the toys to split their search. During his search, Buzz encounters an aisle full of new Buzz Lightyear toys with their hands and legs tied up inside their boxes. He then catches sight of the words "NEW UTILITY BELT!" on a display stand and, thinking he may be able to use one of those, climbs up the stand only to encounter yet

Andy's Buzz tries to convince New Buzz that the latter is a toy, only to irritate him instead. New Buzz then restrains and imprisons Andy's Buzz in an empty Buzz Lightyear cardboard box and places him on the shelf. When the toys cruise by, Andy's Buzz sees the toys taking New Buzz, and angrily shouts, "

He makes a leap toward the closing doors, but the doors slam shut and Buzz crashes into them. He tries to reopen the doors by jumping on the sensor mat, but to no avail. However, Al's car luckily does not go far; it drives over to an apartment building located just across the street. Spotting a stack of boxes next to the door, Buzz knocks it over, and the boxes land on the sensor mat, triggering the doors open, enabling Buzz to exit to run after his friends, unaware that a box that has become sandwiched between the closing doors contains an

However, Woody eventually comes to his senses of what being a toy means and calls Buzz back to let him know that he is coming with him, making Buzz and the other toys relieved, but

Outside, Mr. Potato Head spots an idling Pizza Planet delivery truck nearby, and Buzz orders them to climb aboard the truck as he runs into New Buzz one last time when the other Buzz is playing catch with his "father," Zurg. Andy's Buzz bids New Buzz farewell, then he climbs aboard the truck and assigns the toys to their positions (taking the pedals, navigating, and operating the levers and knobs).

   Just as Rex feels ashamed for what he has done to Buzz, Buzz suddenly springs back to life, still thinking he is a real space ranger, but starts speaking in a different language‚ÄîSpanish‚Äîmuch to the shock of the other toys. Told by Woody that the toys are "amigos" to Buzz, Buzz faithfully rejoins their side. As the toys catch up with the others, Buzz is charmed by Jessie's beauty, calling her his beautiful "desert flower." Jessie is at first uncertain about Buzz's attitude, but then Buzz starts performing a salsa dance to gain the affections of Jessie, who finally starts to like Buzz.

Woody, Jessie, Buzz, and the other toys go through the chute, but at the end of a chute is an open dumpster, and Buzz wonders where his spaceship is.

   When the toys get loaded into a garbage truck, they rush toward Buzz because his glow-in-the-dark functionality allows him to be easily spotted. When the garbage truck loads more garbage into the truck, Buzz searches frantically for Jessie. Finding her caught under some trash, Buzz rushes over to free Jessie and carry her to safety, but

   The toys help Jessie lift the TV, and with help from Slinky, they pull a limp and unconscious Buzz out of the TV by his arms. Jessie opens Buzz's helmet and frantically shakes him, then, feeling it was her fault that she let Buzz be crushed to unconsciousness, begins sobbing over his apparent "death." When Buzz comes back to life, he briefly sniffs the outside air, then notices all the toys staring at him and speaks English once again. Jessie is relieved and overjoyed to see that Buzz is alive from death as she kisses Buzz repeatedly on his cheek, thanking him for saving her from being buried alive. Buzz is confused and wondered what went on. As Woody tells Buzz that he has gone "
   beyond infinity

Seeing that they are heading toward a set of garbage shredders, Buzz orders the toys to grab hold of something metal so that they hang from the magnetic ceiling, safe from the shredders. Just then, Lotso calls for help from under a golf bag, and Woody drops down to free Lotso. Seeing the danger Woody has put himself in, Buzz also drops down to assist Woody, and the two use one of the golf clubs to pry up the bag, letting Lotso crawl out, and they all grab onto the club to be pulled up to the ceiling, narrowly escaping the shredders that pulverize the golf bag.

   The toys then realize that they are heading toward an incinerator, and try to run for it, but are unable to outrun the speed of the conveyor belt. Lotso notices an emergency stop button on the top of a ladder, and Buzz and Woody rush over to help Lotso climb up the ladder toward the button, but Lotso turns away, leaving the toys to die in the incinerator. After the toys are dropped into a large bowl toward the flames, Jessie frantically asks Buzz what they are going to do next, and Buzz, coming to realize that he and his friends are deprived of any escape chance, takes Jessie's hand with one arm as they finally admit their feeling for each other inside themselves. The other toys do the same as they realize that they are now facing death, and Buzz reaches his other arm out to take Woody's hand. The toys are rescued at the last moment by a giant claw commandeered by the Aliens.

   Once outside, Buzz and Jessie sit up to find themselves still holding hands, and they smile at each other. They tell Woody that they still need to get him home, but when Woody expresses his worry about how the toys will handle their lives in the attic, Buzz and Jessie remind Woody that as Andy's toys, their job is to be there for him. The toys return to Andy's house by hitching a ride on Sid's garbage truck, and Woody washes some grime off Buzz's helmet with a garden hose. After climbing back up to Andy's room, Woody and Buzz shake hands, unable to admit that the two friends are now separating ways after all they have been through. As footsteps approach the room, Buzz bids his best friend farewell and climbs into a box bound for attic along with the other toys.

   During the end credits, Woody reads to the toys a letter from Sunnyside, which Buzz thinks it is written by Barbie, based on the girlish handwriting, only for Jessie to pinpoint Ken's signature at the end, making the trio exchange uncertain looks. It is also shown that Bonnie has made drawing for her toys, including Buzz and others given to her from Andy. Finally, Jessie takes advantage of Buzz's Spanish personality, and the two perform a paso doble to "

Buzz, uncharacteristically, doesn't understand what a "conscience" is, and Woody describes it as his "inside voice".

      Buzz Lightyear is a heroic space ranger action figure, complete with laser beam, karate-chop action and pop-out wings. Buzz is a boy's dream toy who becomes a quick favorite of young Andy, and the closest of buddies with Woody. While Buzz's sole mission used to be defeating the evil Emperor Zurg, what he now cares about most is keeping his toy family together. Buzz's new mission is sidetracked along the way, however, when his journey brings out surprising aspects of his personality even he didn't know existed.
