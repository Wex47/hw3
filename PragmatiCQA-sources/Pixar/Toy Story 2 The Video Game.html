In the last boss level, the player will face three mini-bosses from previous levels all at once:

   There are many differences of each console version of the game. This includes the soundtracks being slightly different (i.e. Andy's house has its own audio track in the Dreamcast, Playstation, and PC versions). A lot of the Game's music sounded quite different from its N64 counterpart as they had more variations of instruments. The PS1 cutscenes had different audio (not counting dialog), the Dreamcast does too, the reason why is because the Dreamcast and PC versions were the final versions of the game. Another thing is that the Dreamcast has correct shading, this is due to it being the final version, plus the Dreamcast is a sixth-generation console. Woody and

   In the PC version of Toy Story 2, a boss battle on level 12 featuring Emperor Zurg has a speed glitch on some of the modern Windows versions including Windows XP, Vista and 7.
  </p>
  <p key="db86125d-db09-4466-bbb2-03dea5cf2d08">
   The speed glitch has caused Emperor Zurg to continuously evade Buzz Lightyear from ever touching him rendering the game nearly impossible to beat.

  <p key="7376823e-1af2-4e92-bbf6-461fa32993a4">
   However, you can still beat Emperor Zurg, the way to do this is by getting him cornered and trapped between 2 wall corners. Once you get him cornered, charge up your spin attack, release the spin attack, quickly jump forward and pull back, otherwise your fall down, repeat this until he gets defeated.

   This Speed Glitch only happens in the PC version and does not happen in the Playstation 1, Nintendo 64 or Dreamcast version.
