They then came to the bottom of a massive waterfall, and Luffy grabbed onto two of the jumping carp to pull themselves up. At the top of the waterfall was a whirlpool,
    and Luffy had Sanji fly the others to land. When he tried to follow them, an octopus that had boarded the Sunny held him back, causing him to go down into the whirlpool.

   Luffy and the Sunny washed up on

    Haoshoku Haki
    . Tama then knocked out the scout and submitted herself to Luffy, and in his confusion she managed to pull a piece of kibi dango from her cheek and feed it to Hihimaru, instantly taming him.

  <p key="2e706462-ab0e-4569-9db7-bc48398271a9">
   To thank Luffy, Tama helped him dock the Sunny in a hidden cave before taking him to her home to feed him. When they got to her place, she made a small meal for him out of the little rice she had. She then went out, and Luffy was suddenly confronted by her master
    Tenguyama Hitetsu
    , who thought he had stolen her small rations. Tama then came back and revealed what happened, but she then fell ill due to drinking contaminated river water to suppress her hunger.
    Hitetsu said that much of the country was turned into a polluted wasteland by Kaidou and his factories, and this place, Amigasa Village, had been destroyed by the Shinuchi
    X Drake
    a year ago. Tama continued living here, however, in order to wait for

Luffy revealed that Ace had died, causing Tama to faint. He then decided to go out to the nearest town to get Tama treated by a doctor, and donned a kimono. He also chose to take the cursed sword
    Nidai Kitetsu
    despite Hitetsu's protests, and set off with Tama.

   Somewhere in Kuri, Beasts Pirates Shinuchi
    Basil Hawkins
    received a report that they had lost contact with their men on Kuri Beach, and Hawkins decided to deal with this himself.
    On the way to town, Komachiyo arrived to give Luffy and Tama a ride. They emerged from the forest into a massive wasteland, and Tama told Luffy more about the pollution in the country. Luffy then saw a woman being chased by some Beasts Pirates, only for the pirates to be cut down by someone. Luffy saw that the attacker was in fact Zoro, and quickly went to reunite with his crewmate. However, the two of them were soon confronted by Hawkins and his men.
    The two sides began battling, and Luffy and Zoro went after Hawkins, but he shrugged off their attacks with his
    Wara Wara no Mi
    abilities. Komachiyo then ran in and grabbed Luffy and Zoro to make sure Tama got to treatment, and Hawkins pursued them with a giant straw avatar for a bit until Zoro managed to cut down the avatar.

   As Luffy, Zoro, and Tama headed to town, they were suddenly greeted by
    Tsuru
    , who was the woman Zoro had saved. Tsuru offered to repay them for helping her by taking them to her tea house and brewing an herb to cure Tama. At Okobore Town, the leftovers town, the tea house's poster girl
    Kiku
    was courted by the Flower Capital's strongest sumo wrestler
    Urashima
    , but she declined his marriage proposal. Luffy's group then arrived, and Tsuru told Kikunojo to make the healing brew.
    Tama was healed after drinking it, and Tsuru gave her some porridge to eat. After very reluctantly accepting it, Tama was brought to tears by its taste. Kikunojo bandaged Zoro's wounds, and Tsuru explained that all of them in the leftovers towns lived with barely any food to eat.
    Kozuki Oden
    once had a farm to feed everyone, but that farm was now used to feed Orochi and the wealthy citizens in the nearby Bakura Town; everything Okobore Town got were castoffs and leftovers from there. Suddenly, the group found themselves under attack from the Gifter
    Batman
    , who with his Bat
    SMILE
    had overheard their conversation. While they dealt with Batman's attacks,
    Gazelleman
    came in and kidnapped Tama to bring her to Bakura Town, which the Shinuchi
    Holed'em
    had planned in order to find out about Hihimaru's taming.

    When they saw the duo heading to Bakura Town, they told Law, who quickly became worried and planned to stop them.
    In Bakura Town, Gazelleman brought Tama to Holed'em, who decided to try testing her abilities by pulling on her cheek with pliers. Elsewhere, Urashima told the Gifter
    Mouseman
    about Kikunojo while eating, and Mouseman encouraged him to use his high status to take her by force. Luffy, Zoro, and Kikunojo later arrived at Bakura Town, and while racing down the street, they were suddenly hit by a sumo wrestler who had been knocked out of the ring by Urashima. As Urashima was dominating his opponents, he saw Kikunojo and became ecstatic, thinking she had come to accept his proposal. He had his men bring her to him, but when he silenced and degraded the lower-class spectators, Kikunojo became mad and cut off his topknot with her sword.

Back at the sumo ring, Urashima decided to attack Kikunojo for her actions, but his attack was met by Luffy. Luffy challenged him to a sumo match for Kiku, and the two of them began fighting. Luffy was able to effortlessly dodge Urashima's attacks, and knocked him out of the ring with a single

Holed'em then appeared on a rooftop with Tama, angry that Luffy had sent Urashima flying into his house, and said he would kill Tama if he made a move. Law was still on the mountain when Shachi saw that a fire had broken out and Hawkins had arrived at Bakura Town, leaving him aghast.

   As Hawkins entered Bakura Town, he was confronted by a masked Law, who intended to take him out before the fellow Supernova could recognize him.
    However, Hawkins quickly recognized Law by his Devil Fruit power and tattoos, and after a brief clash, he removed Law's mask. He revealed to Law that he had figured out that his and Luffy's alliance had infiltrated Wano, and Law's panic only grew as Hawkins received a call that Holed'em had been taken out and Jack had been notified. Nearby, Luffy and Tama immediately started running away, and Luffy saw Speed's horse body and jumped on her. She quickly became angry, and Luffy told Tama to feed her a kibi dango, which she did. Although the dango was not supposed work on humans, it did work on Speed due to her Devil Fruit, and she happily carried Luffy and Tama away. Zoro and Kikunojo rode the provisions cart out of town, and Law hitched a ride with them in order to yell at Zoro for his actions. They took the provisions cart to Okobore Town, where they offered it to the delighted citizens. Some Gifters attempted to stop this, but they were then crushed by a massive tub of clean water that Luffy brought. As Tama ate an apple, Luffy promised her that by the time he left Wano, she would be able to eat until she is full every day, and this caused Tama to start crying as Ace had said the exact same thing.

Shutenmaru refused and attacked Jack, and the two sparred. However, their fight was soon interrupted when Kaidou suddenly came flying in as a dragon, wanting to know where Luffy and Law were.

Kaidou drunkenly flew around Okobore Town, dealing lots of destruction in the process, and to stop the destruction, Hawkins raced in and claimed without knowing that Luffy and Law were at the ruins of Oden Castle. Kaidou immediately flew toward the ruins and instantly blew them apart with fire breath, and this caused Luffy to become extremely angry and attack him.

Meanwhile, Kin'emon had gone to Okobore Town to check on his wife Tsuru, and was happy to find her alive and well, but did not intend on reuniting with her until after their mission had been accomplished.

One mysterious prisoner was fed a poisoned fish that was supposed to be boneless, and when Luffy was brought inside the prison, a guard attempted to attack him for glaring at him. However, the mysterious prisoner spit the fish bones at the guard, taking him out. The guards threw Luffy into a cell, saying that starting tomorrow they would break his spirit by working him to death. Luffy's cell was next to

   In the Prisoner Mine in Udon, while an elderly prisoner named Grandpa
    Hyo
    collapsed under the back-breaking work, Luffy and Kid moved large blocks at a rapid rate and were rewarded with large amounts of kibi dango to eat. This caused the vice warden
    Dobon
    to go on a rampage due to his food reserves running out, and he stepped on Hyo as he attempted to kill Luffy and Kid in his hippopotamus mouth. Luffy and Kid quickly took him out, and although attacking a warden would result in execution, they avoided punishment due to no one seeing them inside Dobon's hippo, and they became heroes among the prisoners as Luffy carried Hyo off.
    The next day, Hyo thanked Luffy for saving him, and Luffy gave him some meal tickets to keep his energy up. Raizo, having infiltrated the prison, came up to Luffy to tell him that he located the keys to his Seastone handcuffs, but they were in a heavily guarded room. Caribou then went to Luffy to ask for meal tickets, offering to become his subordinate if given some, but Luffy refused.

    Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Pteranodon
    and crashed into the ship, sending it falling back down the waterfall, with Big Mom falling into the ocean in the process.
    The rest of the Big Mom Pirates landed safely on the Chanter, and they wondered what would become of Big Mom. Some of them were worried that Kaidou would kill her, as the two Emperors hated each other after once being crewmates.

   That morning, Chopper, Momonosuke, Tama, and Kiku walked down to Kuri Beach when they saw Big Mom washed ashore. Chopper became frantic while the other three wondered who she was. However, Big Mom revealed herself to have no memory of who she was.
    A day later, Chopper's group brought Big Mom to Okobore Town, where Tsuru served her some oshiruko. Big Mom took a liking to the oshiruko, and Chopper told her that there was lots of it in Udon to get her to go there.
    Big Mom tamed a
    wanizame
    by hitting it, and the group rode it on their long journey to save Luffy. Momonosuke resumed practicing his sportsmanship, and shouted "sunacchi" after having heard Zoro tell him about it being used in his
    homeland
    . Kiku told him not to say it, as it was a cry used by past generations in Kuri that was unbefitting of someone of his status.

   In the Prisoner Mine, the guards were set on high alert as Kid had managed to escape, and Raizo had successfully stolen the handcuff keys. As Luffy was prodded for information, Hyo was attacked by the warden
    Babanuki
    and vice warden
    Daifugo
    , as they did not believe he earned all his meal tickets. Hyo accepted his death, as he was now happy after witnessing Luffy's act of kindness, which he had not seen in the country since before Kaidou's takeover when he was Hyogoro of the Flower. However, Luffy then rushed in and kicked Daifugo, which was seen by everyone around him. Right as Luffy made his attack, Queen arrived at the Prisoner Mine.
    Luffy managed to injure Daifugo despite being weakened by his handcuffs, but was quickly overwhelmed by Babanuki after the warden shot an explosive blast from his elephant SMILE's trunk. Queen then made his entrance, and Babanuki told him what was going on. Luffy and Hyogoro were brought before Queen, who decided to make their execution entertaining. Meanwhile, as Raizo drew closer to Luffy, he heard the mysterious prisoner calling out to him, and was shocked to realize that this prisoner was his comrade Kawamatsu.

   Raizo had to leave Kawamatsu after being spotted, and Queen put Luffy and Hyogoro into a sumo ring. He had special collars affixed to their necks, saying that if they were forced out of the ring, the collars would go off and decapitate them. To decrease their disadvantage, he had Luffy's handcuffs removed, much to Raizo's bewilderment. A group of
   Waiters
   then charged into the ring, but Luffy quickly knocked all of them out with his
    Haoshoku Haki

    He then easily beat the
   Pleasures

    and
    Madilloman
    entered the ring, and Luffy used his advanced Kenbunshoku Haki to help Hyo avoid their attacks, but continued to fail at advancing his Busoshoku Haki. Hyogoro eventually recognized what he was trying to do, revealing that people from Wano know it as

   Sanji, Usopp, Franky, and Law reached Ebisu Town, where they heard the news about Komurasaki's death and met Tonoyasu. Yasu revealed that Zoro had left to chase after a thief who took his sword, and during their interaction, the group realized that Sanji had left as well. Meanwhile, Nami, Robin, and Shinobu made it to the bathhouse, and as they bathed, Shinobu told them about Hyogoro, whom she knew would corral enough respect to substantially increase their numbers. However, she believed him to be dead.
    Suddenly, Hawkins and Drake commenced a raid on the bathhouse, and rounded up everyone with a crescent moon on their ankle, which they knew to be a symbol of loyalty to the Kozuki Family. Nami tried hiding behind Shinobu, and Hawkins spotted her and tried to draw her out, unwittingly disrobing her. This caused Sanji to inadvertently deactivate his Raid Suit power and reveal his presence, and Hawkins and Drake recognized him as he quickly flew his three comrades out of the bathhouse. As they fled, Sanji revealed that in addition to Orochi knowing about the ankle tattoo, he had also captured Law's crewmates to lure him out.

   Meanwhile, Zoro chased the sword thief, a warrior monk named
    Gyukimaru
    , to Oihagi Bridge in Ringo. Gyukimaru had already returned Shusui to
    Ryuma
    's grave, and Zoro clashed blades with him to try and get it back.
    After fighting for a bit, they were suddenly interrupted as Komurasaki and Toko raced onto the scene, pursued by Kamazo the Manslayer. Zoro intercepted Kamazo, who unbeknownst to the public was an assassin in Orochi's service, and was sent by the shogun to kill Toko. Komurasaki begged Zoro to help them, and he agreed in exchange for food and alcohol. Zoro and Kamazo then commenced an intense duel, and were even until Gyukimaru decided to attack Zoro again. With Zoro turning his focus to the monk, Kamazo was able to pierce him through the shoulder with one of his scythes. However, Kamazo was unable to pull it out, allowing Zoro to take it and put it into his mouth. Zoro then attacked Kamazo with

  <p key="75d11522-d3d0-4ad7-b946-bba7f4706784">
   Zoro woke up in a house in the Northern Cemetery, where he found himself being tended to by Komurasaki. She thanked him and told him about her and Toko's situation, and revealed that she was actually Momonosuke's younger sister Hiyori.
    Hiyori told Zoro about how she stayed behind in the past to ensure the Kozuki Family bloodline kept going, and was taken care of by Kawamatsu. Zoro wondered about the alliance's next course of action now that Orochi had gained an advantage on them, but went to sleep to help himself heal.

   Meanwhile, Kin'emon's group found out that Orochi had discovered the meaning of their secret messages, and in the Flower Capital, hundreds of Kozuki Family supporters were rounded up and put into a large prison in Rasetsu Town.
    After Sanji's group came to Ebisu, Shinobu blamed Law's crewmates for revealing the secret, causing Law to get into an argument with her,
    and Law then left in anger to save his crewmates himself. Tonoyasu came up with the secret message, and asked that Shinobu's group tell Kin'emon that he would be participating in the final battle. Though he spoke to them like a familiar, Kanjuro and Shinobu were unsure of who he was. Yasu then went around helping various townspeople, and an old woman said that although his daughter, Toko, sent him money from the Flower Capital, he gave most of it away and was considered a saint by the townspeople.

   In the Prisoner Mine, Luffy continued hitting opponents out of the sumo ring, but was still unable to progress his Haki. Night fell and the Beasts Pirates all retired, leaving Luffy and Hyogoro in the ring. After Luffy knocked out the guards around them with Haoshoku Haki, he and Hyogoro were approached by Raizo and Caribou, whose handcuffs were the ones Raizo got the key for. Raizo was happy to see Hyogoro and told Luffy who he really was, and Hyogoro said they possessed a great opportunity in this prison, as many people were sent here for rebellion against Orochi. Winning these people to their side, including the regional yakuza bosses and Kawamatsu, would substantially increase their allies.
    Raizo and Caribou then acquired Queen's oshiruko stash and gave it to Luffy and Hyogoro, who ate all of it. When morning came, Queen noticed that they had grown fat, though did not suspect they had eaten his oshiruko and his subordinates were too afraid to tell him.

   In the Flower Capital, Fukurokuju reported to Orochi that Ushimitsu Kozo had been caught, and Orochi was surprised to find out his identity. The shogun ordered that the thief be publicly crucified, and had it broadcast along with Komurasaki's funeral. Meanwhile, Brook found Zoro, Hiyori, and Toko in the Northern Cemetery, and he told them about the development with Ushimitsu Kozo, revealing that he was Tonoyasu. Toko immediately ran off to save her father, forcing Zoro and Hiyori to chase after her. As they watched the broadcast of Yasu's crucifixion, Kanjuro and Shinobu finally recognized him as
    Shimotsuki Yasuie
    , the former daimyo of Hakumai.
    Many years ago, Oden had hung around Hakumai after being exiled by Sukiyaki, and was cavalier about becoming shogun as he believed Yasuie to be better suited for succeeding his father. However, Yasuie had none of that, as he was intent on Oden living up to his father's challenge.
    Some time later, Yasuie had caught the Nine Red Scabbards stealing money to give to Oden. To their surprise, he let them take the money, with the command to serve Oden well on his way to becoming the next shogun.

   Meanwhile, one of Holed'em's men set fire to Mt. Atama to get revenge on the thefts that were committed by Kin'emon's group under the guise of the Mt. Atama Thieves, and Ashura Doji led his men to attack Bakura Town. With them heading out, Kin'emon and Inuarashi raced toward Bakura Town to intercept them.
    As they reached Bakura Town, they watched the broadcast of Yasuie's execution. Yasuie revealed to the crowd that he was actually not Ushimitsu Kozo, and only claimed to be him to get a public execution. He then claimed that he created the Kozuki Family's secret message as a joke, and that the crescent moon tattoo was just a popular symbol from the past. This caused Orochi's subordinates to start having doubts, and as Orochi was being brought to the execution platform, he became enraged after hearing Yasuie curse him. Orochi and his men then shot Yasuie multiple times, and Yasuie accepted his death as he had managed to change the alliance's meeting place for the final battle and tell all the Rasetsu Town prisoners about it.

   As Yasuie fell down to the ground dead, the Ebisu Town citizens who had made their way to the capital started laughing profusely, and Zoro was appalled at this.
    However, Hiyori revealed to him that they were forced to laugh due to consuming SMILEs. She explained that only one out of ten SMILEs grant animal transformation powers, and the rest forced their consumers to only express positive emotions. The Pleasures were the Beasts Pirates who ate these defective SMILEs. However, Orochi had decided to decrease the amount of suffering he saw in the country by mixing the leftover defective SMILEs in with the food that the leftovers town citizens ate, resulting in them receiving the side effects and only being able to laugh. Several of the Straw Hats and Kin'emon also learned this as they watched the broadcast, and in the Flower Capital, Orochi reveled in the laughter. He then saw Toko at the execution platform trying to revive her father with toad oil, and prepared to shoot her. However, Zoro and Sanji both came in at the same time to protect Toko.

Usopp, Franky, Nami, and Robin then came in to attack Orochi's men, and chaos erupted in the city as Orochi was carried away to safety.
    A short time later, the Orochi Oniwabanshu joined the fight, seeking to capture just one of the Straw Hats. Meanwhile, Law snuck up to the Rasetsu prison but was caught by Hawkins. Hawkins revealed that he had tied his life force to Law's captured crewmates, so Law would have to kill them to get to him.

   After Luffy, Hyogoro, and the Prisoner Mine guards watched the execution broadcast, Babanuki reported to Queen that two criminals had just been brought in. Kid and Kamazo were then brought in, and Kid was distraught to see Kamazo's state, revealing that he was Killer and was now forced to laugh all the time after eating a defective SMILE. Queen then had Kid and Killer submerged into a tub and resumed the Sumo Inferno, telling Luffy that they would stay in there until he and Hyogoro died. Luffy tried to attack Queen, but to no avail.
    However, Big Mom then broke into the mine, looking for oshiruko. Queen was immediately angered about her wanting to take his favorite food, and transformed into a
    brachiosaurus
    to confront her. However, Big Mom slammed his head into the ground
    before swinging him around by the neck and throwing him into the wall with monstrous force, leaving him defeated. As Queen flew into the wall, he knocked over the contraption holding Kid and Killer, freeing them, and also broke Kawamatsu's cell door.

   The Beasts Pirates tried to contact Kaidou, but could not get a signal, as Caribou had gotten the idea to smother the Boss Tanishi that facilitated communication outside of Udon. Big Mom found Queen's oshiruko container, only to become depressed as she found it empty. Luffy then unwittingly revealed that he and Hyogoro had eaten all of it, causing Big Mom to attack them in a fit of rage as she had wanted to take the oshiruko back to Okobore town and share it with the people there. Big Mom's attacks pushed Luffy and Hyo toward the edge of the sumo ring, and they were eventually forced out. However, right before their collars went off, Luffy managed to rip them off.

Hyo decided to have Luffy continue training with his life on the line by ordering him to protect him from Big Mom. Luffy tried projecting his Haki to block Big Mom's attack, but was unsuccessful and Big Mom hit him into the wall before chasing him around the entire Prisoner Mine. While Big Mom was chasing Luffy, Queen came up with a plan to try to stop her. When they returned to the clearing, Queen dove on Big Mom in his brachiosaurus form and hit her on the head with immense force. Rather than harming her, though, it restored her memories, and she recognized Queen. However, she then fell asleep, and Queen immediately took action to have her restrained with Seastone and he took her to Onigashima, leaving Babanuki in charge of restoring order. With the chaos dying, Luffy decided to take over the prison.

   Babanuki ordered the prisoners to subdue Luffy, and to Luffy's surprise they did so, as they told him that they had no wish to suffer further by rebelling against Kaidou. Daifugo started shooting the prisoners with
    Excite Bullets

    Mummy

    Soto Muso

    They were able to easily overpower their enemies, but were threatened by the prisoners, who could transmit Mummy to them with just a touch. However, Luffy then grabbed all the prisoners, pointing out that they were still suffering even when helping Kaidou's crew, and said that joining his alliance's revolt would be their only shot at changing that. This won over the prisoners, and Babanuki attempted to shoot them with a powerful Excite Shell, but Luffy foresaw this and tied up his elephant trunk, resulting in Babanuki being engulfed in the explosion. The prisoners then attacked Daifugo, and Udon was successfully liberated.

   In the aftermath, Kid and Killer departed from the Prisoner Mine, with Kid being finished with
    pirate alliances

As Chopper treated Luffy's virus, Hyogoro, Raizo, Kiku, and Kawamatsu talked to the prisoners, who despite seeing them were still skeptical that they had come from 20 years in the past. Momonosuke was then called out while he was talking to Luffy, and when the prisoners saw him, they all bowed and expressed their relief, gaining confidence at seeing a member of the Kozuki Family still alive. Kawamatsu then headed off on his own to attend to some business, promising to reunite with everyone before the final battle.

    He brought them to a massive graveyard in Kuri, and explained that ten years ago, these samurai had all grown tired of waiting for the Kozuki Family to return and, despite his wishes, had set out to Onigashima to fight, where they all lost their lives. Deciding not to doubt the Kozuki Family's reasoning for waiting 20 years, Ashura and his thieves brigade joined Kin'emon's alliance.

He had obliged due to having no chance of survival otherwise, but Kid and Killer had fought until they collapsed. Hawkins wondered if Law had any doubts about his alliance with Luffy now that they were in Wano, but Law gave no answer as he headed out of his cell. Law told a mysterious person nearby that if their plan involved facilitating his escape, he would go along with it.

   As Luffy trained in the Prisoner Mine to improve his Haki and Franky, Usopp, and the minks worked to repair the ships, the rest of the Straw Hats and Nine Red Scabbards met to discuss the strategy for the final battle. Nami brought up Yasuie's message alteration to Kin'emon, and he deduced that the lines on the snake represented legs, meaning the snake was now a lizard and thus their new meeting spot was to be Port Tokage in Udon.
    Zoro and Kawamatsu then revealed that Hiyori was alive, which overjoyed Momonosuke and the Scabbards. Hitetsu then arrived to present Enma and the sword Oden gave to Momonosuke,
    Ame no Habakiri
    . Momonosuke declined to take Ame no Habakiri at the moment, and Zoro took Enma, but quickly found that it instantly drained much of his Haki. Zoro managed to get his Haki back, successfully bringing Enma under his control. In the next four days, the yakuza bosses recruited 200 more people, bringing the alliance's total numbers to 4200, which was still well short of Kaidou and Orochi's forces which were projected to number around 30,000; the alliance was also unable to find a way to free the Rasetsu Town prisoners. By the culmination of those remaining days, Luffy had managed to successfully project his Haki, and Zoro continued improving his skill with Enma. Hitetsu revealed to him that Enma and
    Wado Ichimonji
    were made by the same person, a man named
    Shimotsuki Kozaburo
    who had illegally left Wano over five decades ago.

   On the day before the final battle, Momonosuke and Shinobu joined the Nine Red Scabbards, save for Nekomamushi and the still-missing Denjiro, on a trek to Port Tokage to get ready for the raid, and Kin'emon bid farewell to Luffy after the latter arrived at Amigasa Village. Kin'emon's group then set off through the wasteland as many workers across the country spread rumors about their potential resurgence.
    However, at Hakumai, Apoo arrived at Wano via a gondola accessible through a cave under the waterfall surrounding the country. Accompanying him were the
    Numbers
    , a group of large, monstrous people from Onigashima, and Apoo looked forward to the upcoming Fire Festival. On Onigashima, King reported to Queen that the Numbers were coming back, and Kaidou and Big Mom were partying happily. They then announced that they had formed a pirate alliance, and would resume trying to kill each other after taking over the world; this announcement was met with great shock.
    Meanwhile, on the cusp of the Fire Festival, Orochi received a report that revealed that the alliance's new meeting place was Port Tokage, and that Hiyori was alive and hiding in Ringo.

   and their slaves. Big Mom and Kaidou's alliance would be the greatest threat to the world since that, as they had grown much stronger since their time with Rocks, and their combined bounties were greater than even Roger and Whitebeard's bounties of over
    5 billion. Sakazuki then arrived and said that they could not take action on Wano at the moment, as they did not have enough forces to mount such a venture. Sengoku understood, though pointed out that the unaffiliated country was unusually important in all of this, especially since Oden, the former Whitebeard Pirate and Roger Pirate, came from there.

   On the day of the Fire Festival, Wano Country began its celebration. Orochi set sail toward Onigashima with Fukurokuju, leaving Kyoshiro and the Mimawarigumi in charge of the capital. Meanwhile, Kin'emon's group reached Port Tokage, only to find the place wrecked and their allies nowhere to be found and unable to contact them. Desperate, they cursed their luck as they planned to have the small group depart alone, questioning what could have happened on the night before.

  <p key="7c55d482-6e9d-4976-a5c3-c722c9043952">
   Two days before the Festival, as Kin'emon rallied his allies, Orochi made plans of his own, sending men to destroy several bridges that connect the Wano regions and the hiding spot of the
    Thousand Sunny
    , cutting off the alliance from the Scabbards. Meanwhile, Holed'em discovered the recent theft from the farm and confronted the residents of Okobore Town. After the citizens took the blame, the town was burned down. Despite Momonosuke's pleas, the Scabbards decided to follow their plan, knowing that they would not get another chance. Momonosuke then asked them what would he do without them, and they told him that his father also started out alone, before finding and inspiring the Scabbards to became samurai.

   41 years ago, in a brimming and flourishing Wano, the former Shogun
    Kozuki Sukiyaki
    prepared to disown his 18-year old son
    Kozuki Oden
    due to his outrageous actions he had committed during his life. Meanwhile, Oden, who had returned from one of his failed attempts to go to sea, was enraging some citizens by cooking a pot of oden over a man's cremated remains. A young Kin'emon stole a valuable white boar from a gang and fled to the Flower Capital.
    Denjiro
    , however, told him that the wrath of his parents, known as the Mountain God, would await those who would not return it. Just as the
    Mountain God
    attacked the capital, Oden overheard their conversation and told them to give him the boar.

  <p key="05b4aef0-bd66-40b9-81fc-a2c213700b9a">
   The Mountain God then attacked the capital, and after finding out it ate
    Tsuru
    , Kin'emon tried to attack the God in vain. Oden approached the Mountain God with the boar's offspring and cut the Mountain God in half with his
    Oden Two Sword Style
    . Since he possessed the white boar, he took the blame for it. He received a message from his father Sukiyaki, telling him he had been disowned and exiled from the capital. When Oden happily set off, Kine'mon and Denjiro became his followers. The trio went to Hakumai to meet the daimyo
    Shimotsuki Yasuie

    Ashura Doji
    . He then decided to take over the region, and together with his followers, he worked to round up the criminals and restore order. Once he accomplished this, Sukiyaki reinstated him as his son, as well making him daimyo of Kuri. Oden, needing retainers as a daimyo, then decided to grant his followers the position of retainers.

But they were saved by Oden, who stopped the citizens, and the three of them became his followers. Oden then started to run out of money, so his followers went out to steal money from Yasuie. They were caught, but to their surprise he gave them his money with the order to improve their social standing to increase Oden's respectability. They were successful in it, and three years later they were able to create a formal procession during Oden's visit to Sukiyaki in the
    Flower Capital

   Later that year, Oden discovered that the
    Whitebeard Pirates
    had washed ashore on Wano. He raced toward them and clashed with
    Whitebeard
    , with the intention to join his crew.
    Whitebeard, however, refused to let Oden join his crew, due to being concerned about his character. However, when he tried to covertly set sail at night, both Oden and Izou stowed away by riding on a chain. Whitebeard agreed to let Oden join his crew if Oden could ride the chain for three days. Oden accepted the challenge but when there were only ten minutes left, he ended up drifting away. He then washed ashore on an island, scaring away a
    band of human traffickers
    who had tried to kidnap a woman named
    Amatsuki Toki
    with the promise to take her to Wano. After she treated his wounds, Oden protected her when the traffickers returned with their leader
    Karma

Orochi had amassed wealth by stealing and borrowing from Oden and Yasuie, and the old woman posed as Oden to get him a job in the shogun's castle by lying that he and Orochi were like brothers. As Sukiyaki started to ail, the old woman posed as him and she decreed that Orochi would become temporary successor as shogun until Oden returned.

    The Whitebeard Pirates were then discovered by the Roger Pirates and an excited Oden rushed and attacked several Roger Pirates before being attacked by Roger himself. Roger and Whitebeard both preferred to battle each other, imbuing their blades with Haki and then clashing with a burst of Haki, shaking everything around and even the island. The Whitebeard Pirates and Roger Pirates clashed for three days and three nights. On the fourth day, however, they ended their battle and they split the loot equally between both crews. Roger then told Whitebeard about his dream of becoming Pirate King and traveling the world and asked to borrow Oden for a year in exchange for all his treasure. The Roger Pirates later reached

    D.

   In Wano, Oden reunited with his family and retainers, surprised by the love and happiness the citizen show towards him, although he had left Wano. The retainers told him about Orochi becoming shogun and how he had been oppressing the citizens with the aid of Kaidou. After hearing about how his family was threatened, a furious Oden headed to the Flower Capital. After taking out all Orochi's guards, Oden prepared to attack Orochi, who in fear warned Oden about Kaidou's revenge, but Oden continued his assault.
    Oden was prevented from killing Orochi by
    Kurozumi Semimaru
    , who protected Orochi with his
    Devil Fruit
    , and Oden then learned the truth about Orochi's uprising from Higurashi, who
    posed
    as Oden's father. His actions then resulted in Orochi's allies attacking the citizens outside and Kaidou appearing at the Flower Capital. Thus, Oden started dancing naked in the Flower Capital for five years due to a contract he made with Orochi and Kaidou, losing all the faith and trust the people of Wano had for him, until he learned that Kaidou and Orochi had deceived him. After a year, he was given the news of Roger's execution, where he both cried and laughed while reading the news. 20 years before the present day, he learned from Orochi that Kaidou had captured Hyogoro on Orochi's orders and killed the yakuza boss' wife as well as 16 of his men and also about Orochi's plans to make Wano a producer of weapons. This spurred Oden to take action. He and his retainers set out to defeat Kaidou, when his retainers were given their group name, the Nine Red Scabbards.
  </p>
  <p key="a9284238-6171-4842-bfc1-c2e3554ecd97">
   After they set out, Oden and his retainers were joined by Shinobu, who had always wanted to serve the Kozuki Family. Oden learned from Kaidou that he had placed a spy in the Flower Capital and that they had purposely made Oden dance because he was too strong at that time for Kaidou and his allies, thus weakening him and increasing their chances of victory. Oden and the Scabbards fought a ferocious battle against Kaidou and his crew in the Udon region. In the battle, Oden was able to inflict a scar on Kaidou's chest, but before he could take Kaidou out, he was tricked by Higurashi who transformed into Momonosuke and thus Oden was struck down by Kaidou. Soon after, all of his retainers were taken down as well and the battle ended with Oden and his retainers defeated. They were all imprisoned in the Flower Capital and sentenced to execution in three days by being boiled alive.
  </p>
  <p key="9622148f-d1df-4806-8501-651726644629">
   Three days later, the citizens approached the execution site and saw a large pot of boiling oil, and Oden and his Scabbards were being ushered towards it. Oden stopped and turned to face Orochi and Kaidou who were watching the event from a stage, and asked for a chance for him and his men to live. Kaidou agreed and said that if they survived an hour inside the pot, they were free to go. Oden then entered the pot and held his retainers above his head on a platform, saving them from the torture. The watchers then ridiculed Oden for his actions five years too late, and about how long it was taking him to die. Angered, Shinobu revealed the truth behind the deal Oden made with Orochi five years ago, that involved Oden dancing naked in order to stop Orochi from kidnapping and selling the citizens, and for him and Kaidou to leave Wano in five years.
  </p>
  <p key="3e144f75-54e3-4300-be28-d7d6e5fc52c9">
   Shocked by the revelation, the citizens changed their behavior and started to cheer for Oden, discovering they were surrounded by Orochi's men. Nearing the end of the set time, the citizens counted down and after an hour passed, Orochi had Oden and his men held at gun point, still in the pot. Orochi claimed to have changed the sentence a minute prior. Oden tossed his men above the crowd, saving them, and left them with his wish to open the borders of Wano to the world. Kaidou shot him and the samurai's body disappeared in the oil. Back in Kuri, news arrived to Toki and she recalled Oden in prison, giving her his swords for their children, and the letter he left to her before he left, asking her to use her power in preparation for a great war in 20 years time.
  </p>
  <p key="46d9a30a-a9bb-4349-8cef-00280145f181">
   Following Oden's execution, the Nine Red Scabbards raced to rescue his family in Oden Castle, which Kaidou had set ablaze as he confronted Momonosuke. Toki sent Momonosuke with Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, and Kikunojo 20 years forward in time while Kawamatsu took Hiyori to safety. Shortly after that, she appeared in front of the onlooking citizens and gave her prophecy before she died. Denjiro went to a hut, and after a long period of time emerged with his appearance having changed due to his rage. He went to the Flower Capital and started attracting followers, calling himself "Kyoshiro". As Kyoshiro, Denjiro rose to become a yakuza boss and entered Orochi's service as his bodyguard. Seven years after Oden's death, after finding Hiyori on the street, he took her in and raised her to become Komurasaki as they prepared for the day of the final battle.
    As Komurasaki became popular, she attracted Orochi attention, causing Denjiro to fear for her safety. He had her carry bags of fake blood on her person in preparation of faking her death to avoid the tyrant. Years later, when Kin'emon's group reached the present, Orochi and Kaidou received words of their arrival, and prepared for their counter attack, based on the intel from Orochi trusted spy, who he recruited to be his informant while preparing to live and die as a Kozuki.

   As the Scabbards left Momonosuke with Shinobu, they talked about the unavoidable conclusion that one of them was a traitor, who then revealed himself to be Kanjuro. Kanjuro revealed his reasoning behind his actions, as he was a member of the Kurozumi Family, and while he has no malice towards the Scabbards, his loyalty was to Orochi. At that moment, the Scabbards boat was confronted with vessels of the Beasts Pirates, who planned to sink the Scabbards. Angered at the revelation, Kin'emon slashed Kanjuro, only to realize it was a drawing, and that the real Kanjuro had taken Momonosuke and planned on delivering him to Orochi. Just then, to everyone's shock, the Beasts Pirates ships were attacked by the Thousand Sunny and the
    Victoria Punk
    , while the Scabbards were picked up by the
    Polar Tang

   Just as Luffy, Law, and Kid stuck a devastating blow against the Beasts Pirates, Denjiro appeared. He cut off a large portion of the Beasts Pirates ship and asked to bring his family to join the Nine Red Scabbards forces, revealing himself in the process. He revealed that he had released the 1000 samurai trapped in the Rasetsu town prison and brought them with him. Finally, he applauded Kin'emon's "plan": The two lines in Yasuie's message were not legs; they were cutting lines signifying cutting the center part out. When you remove the center kana of はぶみなと the result is はと or "wharf". In other words, the true meeting place was a wharf hidden in a forest of Habu Port, where the other 4200 soldiers were waiting. Kin'emon, however, was unaware of such a deception.

   With the entire raid forces seemingly accounted for, Kin'emon, in a sign of leadership, rallied his soldiers for the upcoming war. Shocked by their arrival, Kanjuro took Momonosuke and headed to Onigashima to report to Orochi, briefly facing off with Kawamatsu. Kanjuro, aware of Hiyori's status and hiding spot, told the fish-man he would target her next. Riding a beautiful crane conjured through his Devil Fruit ability, Kanjuro attacked the alliance with an ink arrow raincloud. Sanji and Robin attempted to save Momonosuke, but the boy ordered the alliance to stay away and proceeded to Onigashima. Meanwhile, the Beasts Pirates' ship distanced themselves and fired at the alliance with long range cannons, destroying several of the alliances' ships. The alliance was saved with the sinking of the ship by the hand of the newly arrived

   Jinbe then boarded the Sunny, and as the crew prepared to celebrate his return, the Scabbards were joined by
    Shishilian
    and Hyogoro as leaders of the alliance's forces to form a plan of attack. Law then suggested that they would split into four groups: One that would attack Onigashima from the front, two from each of its side, and one aboard the Polar Tang to submerge and attack Kaidou's castle at the back of the island head on. Law stated that the Straw Hat and Kid Pirates would not listen to the plan and strike from the front, making up the first group. Kin'emon and Denjiro volunteered to be heading the groups to attack from each side, with the rest of the Scabbards on board the submarine. Law then noticed the Straw Hats were nowhere to be found, and an explosion was heard from afar, causing Denjiro to remember the guards in front of Onigashima. However, the Straw Hats were already fighting the guards, defeating them easily and looting them for the celebration of Jinbe arrival, but Luffy stopped the party, wanting to celebrate with the entire alliance once Kaidou was defeated. The Kid Pirates then sailed past them, aiming for Kaidou's head, and Luffy ordered Jinbe to catch up to them. Meanwhile, on Onigashima, the festival had commenced as Orochi, Queen, Kaidou, and Big Mom celebrated when the Tobiroppo arrived.

   As Law and the Scabbards submerged, the rest of the alliance reached the entrance of Onigashima. After knocking out the guards, the Straw Hats wondered where to hide their ships as the samurai disembarked, and Luffy saw the samurai ship began to sink, with Kin'emon stating that it was done since they would not need ships for the return trip, showing his determination. As the alliance crossed a bridge, they were given disguises by Kin'emon to appear like members of the Beasts Pirates in order to blend in and avoid unnecessary battles.

   Meanwhile, inland, the Beasts Pirates' celebration, the Golden Kagura, was starting with Apoo playing music and Queen performing and introducing the attendees, including the unseen Big Mom Pirates. Unimpressed by his show, the Tobiroppo sat in a booth awaiting Kaidou and began to argue among themselves about who would become Queen's replacement if he would die, causing
    Ulti
    to lash out at her comrades.
    During their meeting, Kaidou confessed it was not him who summoned them, and King declared it was him who called them. Kaidou then had one of his headliners,
    Bao Huang
    , reveal his schedule, including Big Mom's crew's arrival in Wano and their alliance with the Beasts Pirates, with Kaidou revealing a very important announcement. Kaidou then told the Tobiroppo that it was their job to find his "son",
   Yamato

    Who's-Who

   Meanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates separated into smaller groups, but after hearing from Jinbe that Luffy wanted to stop Kid, since they did not know the plan, and Zoro declaring he had to find Luffy to prevent them from being spotted, Usopp, Nami, Sanji and Chopper were worried both would be lost and spotted. Outside the castle, Luffy then asked some Beasts Pirates if they had seen Kid around. They explaining that they had never heard his name. Luffy noticed the massive amount of food gathered there and witnessed some Beasts Pirates spill Oshiruko and make jokes about giving it to the people of Okobore Town. Enraged after seeing the spilled food, Luffy remembered how happy Tama was when she was given Oshiruko on her birthday.

  <p key="c1ecfc09-a34c-416f-8a15-46b46e40aa04">
   Furious, Luffy attacked the Beasts Pirates, drawing the attention from those around him. Zoro then arrived to lecture Luffy, and in the process drew even more attention by slicing off a building. However, after hearing Luffy's reason, Zoro joined him in rage. On the stage, Queen and Apoo figured out the identities of the invaders, and Queen offered the Beasts Pirates a chance to became one of the Tobiroppo, claiming there was someone he wanted dead and a spot would be open, if they manged to capture the Straw Hats. With an army of Gifters approaching them, Luffy and Zoro were attacked by Apoo and were unable to identify or evade his sound based attack. The two tried to escape but were surrounded, Apoo prepared to strike again, but Kid stepped in to attack Apoo for his treacherous actions.

   With Kid's sudden appearance, the Beasts Pirates were surprised while Queen was shocked to learn another one of Babanuki's false report. Kid confronted Apoo about their alliance, with the latter ridiculing Kid's naivety on the concept of
    Pirate Alliance
    and attacked him. Queen then granted the Beasts Pirates permission to kill the intruders.
    Hatcha
    of the Numbers joined the fight, knocking out some of his crew members. Kid was blown away and was about to be attacked, but Luffy saved him out of anger for Kid causing a riot. As the Supernovas tried to get away from the horde of enemies, they were targeted by Apoo, but thanks to Killer's intel about Apoo's powers, managed to avoid being hit by covering their ears. Above the fight,

As Kin'emon led some of his men across a bridge next to the brothel, a shadow appeared in one of the windows and the samurai hid in the water. The
    Brachio Tank V
    led by Chopper, however, was spotted by Big Mom. At the same time, the Big Mom Pirates learned about their alliance with the Beasts Pirates, but were unaware of the hidden port, as they tried to re-enter Wano via the waterfall. As they reached the top, they were once again targeted by a flying individual, who they initially believed to be King, but was Marco, who pushed the Queen Mama Chanter, sending them down the falls again. The Guardians' ship with Nekomamushi and Izou onboard ascended the waterfall.

Kanjuro informed Orochi about his failure in stopping the alliance's raid.

Marco got rid of the message he had told Nekomamushi to deliver to Luffy (which stated he would show up late) and then listened to the mink ruler's idea to land on Onigashima. Both the Alliance's Southern and Eastern Forces advanced further inland, with the former doing so with the "help" of Usopp and Chopper luring Big Mom away and the latter detaining
    Sasaki

    Devil Fruits

At the Live Stage, Orochi delivered a speech about Wano's history and his conflict with the Kozuki Family as Big Mom approached the location with an army of yokai-based Homies to pursue Nami's team. Luffy managed to hold his own against the siblings until Ulti managed to hold him down. As she prepared to attack, Ulti was struck down by Yamato, who dragged Luffy away to safety.

    Legendary Hour

   Kaidou elaborated further on his course of action, planning to transform Wano Country, a natural fortress, into a lawless nation of pirates and weapon industries, operated by slaved Flower Capital denizens, to oppose the World Government. Orochi, realizing that he would lose his dominion if such an operation were put in action, angrily protested to Kaidou about the plan, only for the Emperor to instantly behead him, to the utter shock of everybody watching. Not needing to bother with either the Kozuki or Kurozumi's matters anymore and intending to have his "son" Yamato become the next shogun, Kaidou sent an ultimatum towards Orochi's followers: either join him and live or die fighting. Luffy and Yamato, who were eavesdropping the announcement's projection and loudly reacting to Kaidou's scheme and Momonosuke's situation, accidentally fell from the attic onto the floor below, with Yamato angered at Kaidou while Luffy followed her lead.

   Outside the castle, Kikunojo managed to strike Kanjuro down. Kin'emon and Denjiro then arrived shortly after, with the former leaving his kasa over Kanjuro's body as a form of condolence. Noticing Izou's presence, Kin'emon welcomed the Whitebeard Pirates' division commander to their team as they finally invaded the stronghold. Inside the castle, Orochi's men quickly swore allegiance to Kaidou, becoming members of the Beasts Pirates. Kaidou then proposed to spare Momonosuke under the condition that he admitted that he was not Oden's son, having been previously disappointed by the boy 20 years ago. Momonosuke, in tears, admitted his heritage out of pride, even though that would lead to his execution. After spectators were surprised by an explosion produced by Yamato's then-removed handcuffs, the Nine Red Scabbards appeared behind the execution platform and managed to pounce on the Pirate Emperor before he could kill Momonosuke, officially beginning the invasion of Onigashima.

   The Red Scabbards managed to penetrate Kaidou's skin, causing the pirate to be extremely confused by it. After the scabbards fell into the Live Stage's ground floor with Kaidou, the alliance finally showed itself to their enemies. Nami and Carrot managed to free themselves as Big Mom came into Luffy's way. The Straw Hat captain declared that he would not only emerge victorious against Kaidou, but also Big Mom and Orochi, declaring an all-out war. Kaidou began to coldly analyze the steps that the samurai had followed up to that moment thanks to the Straw Hat Pirates, accepting Luffy's proposal of a war without quarter. After transforming into a dragon and flying off, the Red Scabbards clung to the beast and flew with him to top of Onigashima, where Nekomamushi affirmed that they knew they would get there, so they had brought all the minks, just below the full moon.

In the Skull Dome, Shinobu tried to untie Momonosuke, but she was caught by King and he sent her flying into a nearby building. However, to both his and Queen's surprise, Momonosuke was saved by an invisible Sanji in his Raid Suit. When King tried to stop Sanji, both engaged in a quick skirmirsh, however Sanji safely returned Momonosuke to Shinobu, before he was struck by King in his Zoan form into a building. Luffy was meanwhile surprised and attacked by an angry Big Mom, who attempted to summon Zeus back, but then realized Nami had managed to steal him again. This was for naught as Zeus could not defy Big Mom, who forced the cloud to not hold back against her. However, Franky and Brook arrived at the Live Stage before Zeus could hit Nami, with Franky running over Big Mom with the
    Kurosai FR-U IV

    Jaki

Franky changed targets at the last second and blasted Jaki in order to release his creation and friends, but that left his back vulnerable to Big Mom, who was ready to cut him with Napoleon. Fortunately for him, Jinbe and Robin arrived at the scene and together managed to drive Big Mom away, saving Franky and allowing him to dock his two vehicles into the
    General Franky

The All-Star, however, did not allow them to proceed, catching them while in brachiosaurus form and throwing them back down. Sanji, who had managed to survive King's attack thanks to the Raid Suit, joined with them as King himself formed an aerial blockade of flying Gifters. The Straw Hats, now fully gathered, were told by their captain to back him up as he attempted to reach the top of the dome once more.

   Having been freed by Big Mom's stray slash attack destroying the tree he was tied up to, Sasaki took note of Kaidou's fight with the Scabbards and the Mink Tribe at the top of the Skull Dome, cursing his former friend Kyoshiro for betrayal. There, The Mink Tribe in their Sulong form valiantly fought against Jack and his forces, with Inuarashi and Nekomamushi stepping up to fight him after transforming themselves. At the Live Stage, the Straw Hats engaged
    Goki

X Drake, who was with Basil Hawkins in a room at the castle, was approached by Who's-Who, who proposed a team up between the two of them to take down Queen. This turned out to be a trap as both Who's-Who, Hawkins and Queen were aware of Drake freeing Trafalgar Law at the Flower Capital. With his cover blown and having nowhere to run, Drake fought his way into the Live Stage, where he attacked Juki at the same moment Luffy knocked Goki down. Aware of Luffy's benevolent reputation through Koby, Drake requested to join forces with him,
    which Luffy accepted, much to the protest of some of his crewmates.

Disappointed about the defeat of 3 of the Numbers, Apoo ordered Hatcha to fight as well. However, thinking that General Franky looked like a toy, the Number was lured outside the Live Stage by Franky. Meanwhile, Zoro and Drake dueled due to the former's mistrust of the latter, but eventually decided to team up in order to prevent Apoo from summoning more Numbers. The two were then assaulted by Queen, who was targeting them from the castle's balcony.

Leaving Sasaki's forces for Franky to deal with, Yamato knocked Haccha out after the latter opened a hole on the ground, with Yamato using it as an escape route while bringing the injured Momonosuke and Shinobu with her. Somewhere in the basement of Kaidou's Castle, Law found a poneglyph, commenting that it was not the one he was looking for. Meanwhile, Luffy and Kid's groups advanced further through the floors of Kaidou's Castle, with the latter gathering scrap to use in the upcoming battle. Sanji, overhearing a woman suffering from apparent sexual harassment, decides to split up from his group in order to find the source of the voice,
    only to fall for Black Maria's trap.

   In the Live Floor, Big Mom ignored the commotion with the Ice Oni and headed to the rooftop to rejoin Kaidou, who was violently massacring the Red Scabbards.
    While doing this, she let Kikunojo's cut arm fall in the Live Floor below. Zoro, distracted by his ongoing fight with Apoo and enraged that he was not assisting the Samurai, decided to unleash a finishing move on Apoo in order to obtain the antibody vial and bring Queen's stalling game to an end. As Zoro threatened Queen from afar and Marco showed up to the Straw Hats in the Live Floor, a huge earthquake struck the island of Onigashima. Yamato, who was trying to find a way out to the ocean, noticed that the island was not at sea anymore, having been brought airborne by Kaidou's power.

   At the battlefield, Marco helped the plague victims by using his phoenix flames to reset the timer of the disease. Chopper, assisted by

   Meanwhile, seeing as that they could not leave the island, Yamato hid Momonosuke and Shinobu in a storeroom, where a broken dragon statue was stored. Yamato told them the story of Luffy's older brother, Portgas D. Ace,
    and recollected their fight and fast friendship, as well as Ace's stories of his little brother. When Momonosuke and Shinobu learned Yamato was Kaidou's daughter, they at first kept their distance but eventually trusted her again. Yamato talked about what was written in Oden's journal regarding his adventures and about the future, and she then gave the journal to Momonosuke. On the battlefield, Queen ordered his subordinates to restrain Marco, who was transporting Zoro, but they were easily shaken off. Queen and King confronted Marco themselves.
    Marco restrained them before throwing Zoro to the roof. On the fifth floor, Luffy encountered the Mink Tribe, and thanked them for defeating all the enemy pirates blocking the way to the roof, before proceeding.

    The two Emperors were soon confronted by Luffy, Zoro, Law, Kid and Killer. When Luffy noticed the fallen Samurai, he walked past the Emperors and cradled Kin'emon, who cried regretfully for being unable to defeat Kaidou and passed the torch on to Luffy. As Kaidou moved in to attack Luffy, Law transported the Red Scabbards away with his ability. Luffy then dodged the attack, before countering with a

Tama had created a large number of dangos while travelling to the island, with the intention of having her allies distribute it to the Gifters in the midst of battle.

    Mary

    Caimanlady

    Black Maria started beating up Sanji in order to force him to call for Robin, but it was unnecessary as Sanji willingly did so, much to the shock of the ladies, who thought that Sanji would be defiant to the end. Just as Black Maria was about to recommence beating up Sanji, Robin appeared and used

    Despite their efforts, they were still spotted by Bao Huang and her Mary's, who broadcasted their location throughout the castle. Sanji, who heard this, interrogated one of his defeated opponents, and found out that Momonosuke is virtually in the opposite direction of the Scabbards. Conflicted on who to support, Sanji eventually ran in one of their directions. Meanwhile, outside the castle, Perospero managed to defeat the two Mink women after clouds covered the moon and cancelled their Sulong. Perospero then headed indoors, as he witnessed Marco holding back King and Queen all by himself, and decided to support his new allies.

   In the Performance Floor, the Beasts Pirates, and their new samurai recruits persistently attempted to reach Chopper, but were forced back by the alliance, predominantly X Drake and Hyogoro, who, by a side effect of the Ice Oni virus, had regained his form and strength of his prime. However, due to the phoenix flames burning up their physical stamina in order to keep them from turning, the situation for the alliance side started to degrade, with Hyogoro even preparing to commit suicide before he turned into an Oni.
    Everyone started to fall into despair, including the Beasts Pirates Waiters and Pleasures, when they learnt that the Ice Oni virus was intended to be used on them as they have lost their value with the loss of SMILEs. Thankfully, in spite of Queen's insistence that the 'Tanuki' was going to abandon them, Chopper came through, firing the

When Queen questions what, how and why Chopper did this, the reindeer stated that thanks to his two years of training, he was able to make a gaseous virus designed to counteract the Ice Oni virus using the antibodies as a base. Queen then fired at Chopper when the Cotton Candy Lover lectured him on how weaponizing viruses would inevitably lead to them losing control over it. At this point, having felt betrayed at the fact that they were to be treated as expendables, the Pleasures put their bodies on the line to protect Chopper. Marco then restrained Queen, allowing Chopper, who used Monster Point, to hit the Brachiosaurus, while declaring that he was NOT a tanuki, eliciting silent apologies from all his allies, who had been continuously calling him one.

   In the Right Brain Tower, Team Momonosuke fled from the enemies when Momonosuke, in a moment of self doubt, transformed into a dragon.

Momonosuke offhandedly, yet correctly, stated Luffy's current condition, evoking surprise from Shinobu, as the group was nowhere near Luffy.

Meanwhile, in the treasure repository, the Scabbards regained consciousness, and just as they were about to leave to rejoin the battle, the door opened to reveal Oden, much to their delighted shock.
    However, Ashura quickly exposed that the Oden in front of them was a fake, with all of them soon realizing that it was a living painting remotely controlled by Kanjuro, who was still alive. Ashura then sacrificed himself to push away the painting before it self-destructed, while the rest ran towards Momonosuke, as they realized he was being targeted. However, they soon came across Jack, with Inuarashi volunteering to stay behind in order to fight him. The Scabbards soon came across Orochi and Fukurokuju, with the former transforming in order to take on the visibly weakened Samurai, despite the latter's insistence that they flee. This proved to be the shogun's undoing, as the Scabbards instantly decapitated six of his heads before moving on, with the exception of Raizo, who stayed behind to fight Fukurokuju.

Kaidou laughed and then attacked, while stating that only the mightiest can use such a technique. However, Luffy instantly countered, using Haoshoku-infused emissive Haki attacks, chaining a kick which knocked away the kanabo, a punch to Kaidou's gut followed by an uppercut, which floored the Emperor. Luffy then thanked Zoro and Law, telling them to go down, while he himself would take on Kaidou alone.
    The two clashed, both using Haoshoku Haki in their attacks.
    Unfortunately, due to Luffy's inexperience in using Haoshoku Haki in this way, he soon lost and was sent plummeting into the sea, with Kaidou commenting that he got carried away and should have cut of his head, since without it he couldn't break the morale of the rebels.

Law quickly handed Zoro to the chef, listing out all of Zoro's injuries, before he and Zeus went their separate ways in order to look for Big Mom. After wrapping up Zoro in bandages, Sanji continued heading for Momonosuke, before into Izou and Kawamatsu. As it turned out, the Scabbards have split into smaller groups, with Nekomamushi headed for

With Momonosuke in Kin'emon's hands, Sanji took Zoro's advice and headed to the Live Floor. Meanwhile Kid and Killer, having been blasted a good distance indoors, quickly shook of the attack and started to actively look for Big Mom, though when they soon encountered Hawkins, who attempted to ambush them with

At this point, they ran into Big Mom, who recognized the Straw Hats and Tama, the former she threatened hostilely, though the latter she surprisingly greeted gently, as according to Prometheus's thoughts, Linlin rarely entered a Mother Mode for children under the age of 10. After she learnt of how Okobore Town, the place that helped her when she had amnesia, was burnt to the ground by Kaidou's men, she angrily knocked out the approaching Page One with a single Haoshoku-infused fist.

   As the Homies celebrated their first combo attack, Zeus appeared and is saddened when he saw a new Homie in his place. When Big Mom noticed him, he attempted to join in as part of the group, but is left heartbroken when Big Mom rejected him and had Hera feed on him. As he is being eaten he tearfully apologized to Nami, and even attempted to attack Linlin, as a means to delay the Emperor and allow Nami to escape, though he is easily squished by his former master. Nami attempted to strengthen Zeus by giving him some

   In the First Floor Attic, Momonosuke was left to hide with Shinobu, while Yamato headed to the Skull Dome while hiding a makeshift Momonosuke doll in an effort to distract the enemy. In the attic, Momonosuke read his father's journal and is shocked at the conclusion, that indicated that he really couldn't afford to die. All of a sudden, as Luffy was sunk into the sea after losing to Kaidou, he used the
    Voice of All Things
    and transmitted a message to Momonosuke, which he wished for the boy to spread to their allies, who in turn complied. As he rolled in pain from the headache of receiving the message, he was soon discovered by Kin'emon and Kiku, and promptly after by Kanjuro who used his ability to disguise himself as Oden. Though Kiku knew the truth and resolved to deal with the impostor, she still hesitated, allowing the traitor to stab her. Kin'emon then took her place and cut down Kanjuro, but then Kaidou appeared and struck down the Foxfire. As Shinobu and Momonosuke ran away, Kin'emon still attempted to fight by stabbing Kaidou with his broken blades in spite of his injuries. However, this proved to be ineffective as Kaidou impaled Kin'emon with Kiku's sword before pursuing Momonosuke. As the Kozuki heir was carried away by Shinobu, he used a frog Mary he snatched to transmit Luffy's message throughout Onigashima, urging that Alliance to continue fighting, and that the Straw Hat captain would return to the fight and would win. At this point, Kaidou cornered the two, but before he could attack them, Shinobu used her
    Juku Juku no Mi
    ability to rot of the edge of the island and fall off Onigashima. Yamato then challenged Kaidou from atop the Skull Dome, not only to break their bonds, but also to buy Luffy some time. Kaidou then flew to the top of the Skull Dome in his dragon form before entering his hybrid form to fight Yamato.

She caught Tama, and having realized that she was the one responsible for the Gifters' and Big Mom's actions, started to strangle the girl. Nami attempted to attack the Tobiroppo by hitting her with the stretched out Clima-Tact, but was surprised when Zeus transformed the end into a mace. Zeus then stated that though Ulti's skin is tough, her insides must be heavily damaged, and she'd just need one more strong attack to be taken down. Usopp then hits Ulti with

Zeus, who was elated now that Nami accepted him as her partner, cleared the way for their escape.

They noted that a total of 5,000 casualties have appeared on both sides, with the ratio between Beasts Pirates and the Alliance being 24,000:3,000. However, thanks to Queen causing the Pleasures and Waiters on his own side to revolt, the gap is actually smaller, being 20,000:7,000.

Momonosuke was relieved to see Luffy alive and started to cry over Kin'emon's and Kikunojo's fate, but Luffy told him to not cry yet until Kaidou is beaten. He then pointed up into the air and told Momonosuke to turn into a dragon and fly him back up to Onigashima. In order to do this, Momonosuke requested Shinobu to mature his body into an adult with her ability.

Killer then sliced at Hawkins but as the Magician redirected the injury to his final doll, he cryptically told the Massacre Soldier to consider whose life the doll was attached to, before revealing that the final straw doll was tied to Kid's life. Simultaneously, as Kid and Law fought Big Mom, Kid was sliced out of nowhere. Hawkins took pleasure in Killer's dilemma and wondered what he would decide to do.

The samurai, realizing that attempting to support the Straw Hats in their battles would be futile, instead turned to suppressing the other Beasts Pirates and preventing them from interfering in the Straw Hats-Lead Performer battles.

As Yamato exhaustively stated that her father was trying to kill her, Kaidou passively affirmed this saying that it was burden of carrying Oden's name. Yamato verbally defended her admiration as she recalled the past, when she first awakened her Haoshoku Haki. Having unintentionally knocked out some of her father's men, Kaidou properly recognized her as a potential threat with her mindset, and locked her up in a cave with samurai who rebelled against him. Claiming to give them an opportunity to join him if they surrender, he left a single portion of food and the samurai's swords, believing they would either fight each other for the food, or kill Yamato for being his son. What neither parent nor child expected was that, once the cave was sealed, the samurai instead claimed their blades, cut the girl free of her chains and give her the only portion of food. With their actions and mutual admiration for Oden, Yamato put her trust in them, and revealed Oden's log book, asking them to teach her what was written. Ten days later, with Yamato close to starving to death, the samurai decided to break out of the cave in order to secure Yamato's future, who promised to fight for Wano when the predicted war came, with their actions leading to their death.

This ended up making him crash straight into the castle and straight through the Performance Floor, before ascending into the second and then third floor, before managing to get back outside, briefly shocking everyone who saw him in the process. When they were back above the Skull Dome, Luffy pointed out Kaidou, which made Momonosuke open his eyes and fly straight at the Emperor.

Yamato, having finally noticed her allies, briefly celebrated their reunion before a fully transformed Kaidou recovered and demanded to know how Luffy survived and who the peach dragon is. As Luffy declared himself to be the man who will be Pirate King, Momonosuke screwed up his courage to reveal himself to be the future shogun, to which Kaidou in turn proclaimed that there was no need for two dragons.

Though Momonosuke pessimistically tried to avoid doing as Luffy said, recalling all the trauma Kaidou made him go through, the pink dragon gathered his courage and bit his blue counterpart. Just as Kaidou threatened to attack Momonosuke, Luffy punched the blue dragon away, before asking the young shogun whether, after biting an Emperor, there was anything in the world he was afraid of, which Momonosuke enthusiastically declared no. Luffy then told Momonosuke to stop Onigashima alongside Yamato, declaring he would definitely win. Kaidou then entered his hybrid form, before he and Luffy clashed with Haki, which ended up splitting the clouds.
    As Momonosuke and Yamato made to leave, Kaidou attempted to stop them. Yamato managed to defend the two from Kaido's attack, long enough for Luffy to restrain the Emperor, allowing Momonosuke to fall off the edge of the Skull Dome.

   As Momonosuke fell, Yamato coached him on how dragons fly using Flame Clouds, which the young shogun quickly picked up. They then noticed the bedrock starting to fall, which Yamato realized meant that Kaidou's control over the Flame Clouds supporting the island has loosened due to the Emperor himself weakening. They realized that if Kaidou were to be defeated, the island would plummet immediately, endangering not only the citizens in the Flower Capital but everyone on Onigashima. Furthermore, if the massive amount of explosive weapons stocked on Onigashima were set off by the impact, the fatalities would further increase. Momonosuke attempted to physically push the island back, but Yamato dissuaded him, claiming a better idea would be for the peach dragon to produce Flame Clouds superior to Kaidou's and support the island with those. Momonosuke started getting pessimistic again, believing that his inexperience and the difference between himself and Kaidou would make it impossible to achieve such a feat, and proposed to instead stop Luffy from fighting. Yamato angrily knocked the dragons head in response, believing that informing the captain of such a thing would only burden him, and that it would be up to two of them to stop Onigashima.
    She then assigned Momonosuke to create the Flame Clouds, while she headed to the Armory in the basement to reduce the damage. Yamato then climbed up the side of Onigashima in her hybrid form, before transforming into her wolf form in order to reach the Armory as quickly as possible.
    In the meantime, Momonosuke at first desperately attempted to create Flame Clouds bit-by-bit.
    However, he quickly found that it would be faster to simply manipulate Kaidou's pre-existing Flame Clouds instead.

    The two pirates at some point strategized to make use of their awakened abilities, despite the severe drain to their stamina and the vulnerability afterwards if they do, seeing as they have no other way to bring her down. As the fight continued, they soon found themselves on the Performance Floor, with Kid being blasted back by Big Mom's

However, soon Yamato burst in and, though confused at what the Supernovas were doing there, even briefly clashing with Drake, after confirming that both sides were currently unaffiliated to the Beasts Pirates, she continued running to the armory, but now with Fuga following her. Apoo also followed her, persistently attempting to persuade her to his side, while Drake chased after him. However, when the group reached the basement's second level, Brook and the now conscious Robin fell from above, landing in Fuga's hair. Due to attempting to flee the flames as well as the CP0 agents who were seeking to capture Robin they leapt all the way from the second floor to the basement's second level. The agents jumped after the Straw Hats, however they ended up being smothered and burned by Kankurou's Kazenbo. As the Kazenbo headed down, Yamato realized that it was headed for the Armory, and redoubled her efforts. Ironically, thanks to the Kazenbo, a wall of flames now separated Robin and Brook from the agents, with the Straw Hats using this opportunity to flee. Apoo foolishly decided to antagonize the agents by taking their pictures and declared that he would sell them to Morgans, which resulted him being struck down by an agents

However, the freed Sanji soon got up, and though he had several broken bones, he was actually able to quickly fix them right before Queen slashed at Sanji with his massive blade. However, it was the blade that shattered, and Sanji soon came to realize much to his horror, that he might be somehow awakening the modified superhuman abilities of his brothers'.
    Afraid he might turn into heartless people like his brothers', Sanji fled in order to buy time to organize his thoughts, though Queen continued to pursue him. As he ran away, some of the Beasts Pirates fired at his head, though instead of killing him, Sanji claimed it only hurt.

    . However, Queen, who was stalking Sanji using his stealth function and had a grudge against Osome for rejecting his advances, snuck up on and attacked her.
    Before Sanji knew it, the girl was suddenly sent flying and started bleeding. Sanji left her with her fellow geisha's but they thought he was responsible. Due to the suddenness of the attack, Sanji thought that he had a lapse in memory when it occurred and feared that he might have had actually been the one responsible, believing that he had started turning into a heartless being like his brothers'. After Queen turned up, transforming from his beast form to his hybrid form, Sanji made a decision. Believing that the Raid Suit was the thing that altered his body by awakening his latent modifications, Sanji resolutely destroyed it, before calling Zoro. Fearing the worst, Sanji requested Zoro, (who was in the midst of combat) that if after the battle he wasn't himself, for the swordsman to kill him. After Zoro agreed to it, Sanji hung up, before suddenly disappearing in front of Queen's eyes, and attacking him with

    lunarian
    , the last of an otherwise extinct race who was considered by some as gods. When Sanji asked how they almost became extinct, Queen just told Sanji to ask "history" himself, before firing a laser at him.

Sanji disappeared in response, which Queen realized wasn't the ability of technology, but simply super high movement speed, though the cyborg believed that when Sanji reappeared, he would be exhausted. Just then, Chuji appeared in the seemingly empty battlefield, followed by Osome, who was once again looking for the rat. Queen, still petty about her rejections, approached her while invisible and planned to once again attack her, when an enraged Sanji, who now understood that it was the dinosaur-man who attacked Osome earlier, struck first. By combining the Busoshoku Haki he trained with the power, speed and the exoskeleton of his newly modified body to the fullest, Sanji created a stronger form dubbed

   In the Performance Floor Zoro managed to cut a portion of King's mask, which enraged the Calamity, who entered his hybrid form and started to fire off indiscriminate cutting attacks, which hurt friend and foe alike to get at Zoro. His attacks were powerful enough to send Zoro flying into the Right Brain Tower, where Franky was, who managed to catch the swordsman. Franky offered to help, but the swordsman instead requested he stay away, which the cyborg easily agreed to. King then flew at Zoro at high speed attacking with

King then obliged Zoro by engaging him in a swordfight, though as they fought, the Pirate Hunter desperately tried to figure out King's secret's in order to defeat him, even as he was being knocked back. Suddenly, Zoro heard Hiyori's shamisen, which triggered Enma to start sucking out his Haki.
    Zoro forcefully stopped the sword, when King suddenly came up right before the swordsman in his human form in a defenseless position. Not knowing what King was thinking, Zoro stabbed at him, which resulted in a massive explosion on contact, with King coming out of it unscathed. Zoro managed to defend against it with Haki, before striking back with

This caused Zoro to lose his swords, and as he recovered them one-by-one he recalled details about each of them.

    Shimotsuki Village
    . He was also the blacksmith who forged Wado Ichimonji and Enma. Recalling the words of the blacksmith, Zoro realized that Enma was testing him and that he had to go all out with his Haki, even going so far as to release his Haoshoku Haki. When King inquired about if he intended to be a king, Zoro agreed as he recalled his promise to Luffy and Kuina to become the world's greatest swordsman.

    100,000,000 for any information on lunarians, so King burned the subordinates. King and Zoro then continued their fight outside. Zoro demonstrated his new
