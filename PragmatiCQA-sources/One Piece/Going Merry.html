   Originally designed by
   Kaya
   's servant
   Merry
   , it was gifted to the Straw Hats for defending
   Syrup Village
   against the
   Black Cat Pirates
   . Over time, it came to be loved by the crew as a home and as a friend, so much so that she eventually developed a life of her own and became a genuine crew member. Unfortunately, the Going Merry took an inordinate amount of damage during her "lifetime", being blown up, impaled, sliced up multiple times, and partially
   eaten
   by
   Wapol
   . Eventually, the Merry could no longer continue and after helping the Straw Hats escape

   After its destruction, the Merry was succeeded by the
   Thousand Sunny
   , a ship specially built by
   Franky
   (and the
   Galley-La Company
   ) to maintain the "soul" of its predecessor.

   The Going Merry had a jib and a central steer rudder. The ship's armaments consisted of four cannons, one in the bow pointing forward, one in the stern, and two pointing to either side. They were rarely used, as the Straw Hat Pirates usually preferred to run away or engage in hand to hand combat. After the Arlong Park Arc, the Going Merry gained three tangerine trees from
   Bell-mère
   's orchard, a memento of Nami's home. As the crew traveled through the
   first half
   of the
   <a href="Grand Line.html" key="6734f9d5-be6d-495e-bb41-051ae571144d" title="Grand Line">
    Grand Line
   </a>
   , the ship received more and more damage and gained several metal patches to hold her together at places that could not be nailed back together: prominent examples are Merry's figurehead and the mast, which was torn off several times. Several spots of the guardrail were damaged and missing, leading the crew to patch them up with wood-boards, which was done rather crudely due to their lack of experience in carpentry. By the time it reached
   Water 7
   , the keel was damaged, which was considered to be irreparable in the long run, thus dooming Merry. In the Skypiea arc, the body of the ship had wings and the sheep figurehead was dressed as a chicken.

   Despite the incredible amount of damage the ship accumulated over its travel through the Grand Line, it had a miraculous resilience in that when Kaku released it to drop down a waterfall, it did not smash apart, but instead landed on its side, undamaged from the fall. With Iceburg's expertise in patching it up to extend the limited time it had, the Going Merry was able to sail through the treacherous storm of the
   Aqua Laguna
   , all the way to

   and placement of items were the crew's biggest worries. It was not until they met Johnny and Yosaku on board the Going Merry that a more serious issue occurred. Having accidentally shot their boat while testing the ship's cannons, the two bounty hunters showed to the crew first hand the consequences of scurvy with the state that
   Yosaku
   was then in. Johnny, in a fit of desperation, turned his swords on the crew and chopped off part of the railing on the Merry's upper deck. This made the entire crew realize that they needed a cook in order to protect themselves from the disease as well as starvation due to the way Luffy and sometimes Zoro ate. Yosaku was given a supply of Vitamin C-rich limes to cure his scurvy, and Johnny repaid the Straw Hats for their kindness by fixing the damaged railing. Luckily the crew was informed by the bounty hunters that the ocean going restaurant,
   Baratie
   , was nearby. This vessel would be the perfect place to acquire a cook. The crew set off on their journey to stock up on food and gain a chef.

The metal poles that were shot from the Marine ships pierced the ship's side thus creating large holes in the Merry's frame. Fortunately, however, the reformed Mr. 2, along with his crew, was able to draw away the Marines then by pretending to be the Straw Hats thus saving the ship from further damage. After all that, the Going Merry was steered to the north eastern part of the Arabasta. Here the Straw Hats were to meet up with Vivi in case she wanted to join up with the crew. Vivi was at the meeting place; however, she declined the offer for the sake of her country. The crew wanted to respond to Vivi from aboard the Merry; however, they could not due to a nearby Marine ship. Not wanting to get Vivi in trouble, the crew instead responded by showing off their X marks to Vivi. With that sign of friendship, the Going Merry and its crew sailed away from Arabasta.

   The escapades with Baroque Works had left the crew of the Going Merry very tired and lonely due to the fact that Vivi wasn't coming along. However, one last surprise came along from all this: the former vice president of Baroque Works, Miss All Sunday, had stowed away aboard the Going Merry. Having met her before leaving Whisky Peak and identifying her as a past enemy, the crew did not know what to do. The woman, whose real name was
   Nico Robin
   , surprisingly asked to join the crew due to actions done by Luffy. This, Luffy accepted and the Going Merry gained another occupant from this series of events involving Baroque Works.

   After the events with Baroque Works, the Going Merry and her crew shortly experienced an incredible sight. A ship fell out of the sky. This ship, later identified to be the
   St. Briss
   , apparently came from a sky island called
   Skypiea
   . This idea of this island seemed quite impossible. However, it appeared to be the next destination on the
   Log Pose
   . With this new sensation, Luffy decided to steer the Going Merry to Skypiea, but there was one slight problem. The Going Merry was not capable of going into the sky. Unable to do anything, the ship was instead steered into the direction of

Around this time the Going Merry started to show noticeable signs of damage, such as makeshift wooden repairs to the hull and scraps of steel holding the mast together, leading some members such as Zoro and Sanji to suggest they get a new ship, something Usopp vehemently denies due to its origins.

It was also given a rooster motif: wings, a tail, and a decorative red cowl with a cracked eggshell decoration hiding the broken bit of its figurehead.This new design of the Merry was intended so that it could easily maneuver on the vertical current called the

   White Sea
   where the Straw Hats' adventures in the sky would begin. Unfortunately, the Merry's flying modifications did not hold up for long, as its wings broke off from the force of the landing.

   After a brief encounter with a masked warrior and a seemingly errant knight, the Going Merry traveled across the White Sea towards Heaven's Gate. There, the Going Merry was transported to the White White Sea by the speedy shrimp. Once in the
   White-White Sea

   . Several events caused by the crew happened on Angel Island which ultimately led to the Going Merry to being carried off by a super-express speed lobster deep into
   Upper Yard
   , the territory of Skypiea's God. This series of events caused the Straw Hats that were left on Angel Island, Luffy, Sanji, and Usopp, to head out into Upper Yard to reclaim their ship and rescue their friends. As for the remaining Straw Hats aboard the Going Merry, they could not do anything to the giant lobster without falling victim to some pursuing sky sharks, so they allowed the lobster to carry the ship until it placed them upon a sacrificial altar surrounded by water-like clouds. There they decided to explore the rest of Upper Yard, leaving Chopper to guard the Going Merry.

   While waiting for the others, Chopper encountered one of the priests of Skypiea,
   Shura
   the Sky Rider. Desiring to maintain the balance caused by the other sacrifices (Nami, Zoro, and Robin) leaving the ship, Shura went to the ruined altar of Shandora, where offerings would be taken by the Super-Express Speedy Lobster. He attempted to sacrifice Chopper and began attacking him along with
   Fuza
   , and their scuffle began to damage the Merry. The priest, having no respect for the ship, lit the ship's mast on fire. Desperately, Chopper broke the mast and threw it into the clouds in order to prevent the fire from spreading to the rest of the ship. This seemed like a dangerous situation for the Going Merry; however, before the priest could continue his attack on it, her then sole defender, the knight errant, Gan Fall, appeared to fight him off. The battle between these two, however, ended with
   Gan Fall
   being defeated and Chopper diving into the clouds surrounding the altar to save him, although as a devil fruit user, he lost the ability to swim. Fortunately, the Going Merry wasn't further harassed by the priest as he was then called at that moment to be somewhere else. The Going Merry, then and there, would remain on the altar in its damaged state until the rest of the Straw Hats returned.

   After the entire crew rejoined one another and had a party with some wolves, something mysterious happened to the Going Merry. While the rest of the crew was asleep, Usopp went off to relieve himself. As he finishes doing his business, he sees
   someone
   apparently repairing the ship. Wondering who it might be, Usopp tried to get a better look at the person. Suddenly without warning, the person then looked at Usopp with nothing but a smiling featureless face. Horrified by the sight, Usopp wakes the rest of the crew to alert them to what he thinks is a ghost. Seeing no one near the ship, the rest of the crew dismisses Usopp's claims as nothing more than his imagination and go back to sleep. The next morning, however, the crew awaken to a surprising sight. The Going Merry, though still not perfect, was apparently repaired by someone overnight. This was very surprising as most of them knew for sure that no one else was up repairing the ship. What was more surprising was that the one who repaired the ship restored it to its non-flying mode. This was a design that only the crew themselves knew since entering Skypiea. Regardless of who repaired Merry, the crew decided to press forward on their adventure in Skypiea.

   After using a sky shark to drag the ship off the altar, it was decided that the Going Merry would be steered to the southern part of Upper Yard. The crew had decided to split up into two teams and that there they would meet up again after getting the gold. However, things did not go as planned when the Merry set off.

   After the ship returned to the Blue Sea and the events the crew experienced in
   Long Ring Long Land
   , the Going Merry's crew had reached the fabled city of water,
   Water 7
   . This Venice-like city was renowned for its shipwrights and shipyards. So great were these, that not even pirates dared to attack them at risk of not having their ships repaired or worse. This city was a great opportunity for the Straw Hats in many ways. Ever since the damage caused by the marines during the Straw Hat's escape from Arabasta, the Going Merry had continued to sustain heavy damage caused by a number of events. Even though the crew, most notably Usopp, was able to patch up the Merry, the repairs done to the ship were below standard. Here, the Straw Hats could finally fully repair the ship properly. Even better, they also hoped to gain a new member for the crew from the abundance of
   shipwrights
   within the city. This they hoped would help maintain the ship fully. With these high hopes, they docked the Going Merry on a shore near the city.

  <p key="2f8ccdae-09ce-4bf4-8b39-5190cb56c2ce">
   After renting some Yagara Bulls and exchanging the gold they acquired from Skypiea for a total of
   300,000,000, Luffy, Nami, and Usopp proceeded to Dock One where they met
   Kaku
   ,
   and then later President
   Iceburg
   of the
   Galley-La Company
   and two other foremen working there. Seeing as they were customers then, Kaku decided to check out their ship. Unfortunately, upon returning, the shipwright brought bad news. The Going Merry was now irreparable.
  </p>
  <p key="a0f870c3-abda-497e-a34b-3bec9bf5a627">
   This, as Kaku explained, was because the keel (which is like a ship's backbone) was broken. This was the most critical part of the Going Merry, and it being broken meant the ship could never be fixed again. This meant the ship would practically sink on the way to the next island. Luffy, not wanting to accept this, insisted that the shipwrights repair the ship regardless of the cost. It was then, however, that Luffy and Nami realized that Usopp was missing, along with two-thirds of their money intended to repair the ship. This was done by the
   <a href="Franky Family.html" key="95e23281-daea-4edf-88a6-05536b19ab89" title="Franky Family">
    Franky Family

  <p key="58072d3f-85a8-487a-a937-19e2c5e2ad6b">
   After discovering that Usopp had been taken and beaten up by the Franky Family for the money, Luffy, along with Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper, decided to raid the gang's hideout to reclaim the money, as well avenge their fallen comrade. However, when they trashed the place, they discovered that the money that could have been used to repair the ship had been taken far away from Water 7. With this turn of events and the facts given by the Galley-La company, Luffy made the hard decision to instead buy a new ship. This decision, however, did not go over well with Usopp. Having repaired the ship so many times, Usopp had come to treasure the ship to a point where he considered her as part of the crew. Thus, he could not accept as it seemed to him like the crew was abandoning one of their own. This disagreement with Luffy's decision eventually led to Usopp leaving the crew and a battle between him and Luffy for ownership of the Going Merry. This battle in the night was an intense one for both combatants. This was because Usopp had known Luffy more than the latter's previous opponents, and was able to come up with some strategies to battle Luffy for the ship. However, despite all the effort Usopp put into it, Luffy beats him. Even though he was the victor, Luffy let Usopp keep the ship as an act of pity. The next morning, Luffy and the rest of the crew take their belongings off the ship, leaving Usopp alone with the Going Merry.

  <p key="99578614-b3b8-466f-b0a2-a3ec1206ace2">
   After the intense battle from the night before, Usopp continued to desperately repair the Going Merry, despite his lack of carpentry skills and equipment. Eventually, Usopp is "kidnapped" by the boss of the Franky Family,
   Franky
   , in order to draw out Luffy whom the latter had a brief battle with. Usopp and the ship are then taken to Franky's secret hideout under the bridge. Despite being enemies, the two bonded together and Franky allowed Usopp to continue repairing the ship. However, after hearing Usopp plans to use the Going Merry to go back home, Franky began to dismantle the ship despite Usopp's protests. The underworld boss told Usopp the same reason Kaku told him as to why the ship could not be repaired anymore. Usopp, knowing this all too well, replied that he knew already that the ship could no longer be repaired but did not have the heart to accept it. It is then that Usopp revealed to Franky about the mysterious spirit that he saw. Realizing what Usopp was talking about, Franky explained to Usopp that the spirit he saw was a
   Klabautermann
   , a manifestation of a ship's soul brought about when it has been loved and cared enough. Franky explained to Usopp that the Going Merry is a ship whose final job now is to carry its crew to one last island before it could sink. Should she not be able to do so, the ship would have failed in her duty. She, he explained, would be happier to simply be dismantled at an island than to sink with her crew onboard. This explanation made Usopp realize how much more of a crewmate the ship was. However, it also led to a heated debate between him and Franky on whether or not the ship should be dismantled. Before the debate could get any more heated, Franky's hideout was breached. The intruders who barged in were Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa, and Blueno, four of the shipwrights of Water 7 who were then revealed to be secret undercover agents of
   Cipher Pol 9
   .
  </p>
  <p key="2c66a7bb-7437-48f5-aac1-a3af2f62c7c1">
   After a brief struggle wherein the agents took down Franky in order to get the blueprints of the ancient weapon,
   Pluton
   , the Going Merry was put in a dire situation. One of the agents, Kaku, explained that even though the agents were undercover and not truly shipwrights by trade, they had studied up on the job rigorously in order to function as shipwrights well enough to avert suspicion. The group's judgment that the ship needed to be scuttled was a legitimate call by professionals who had the knowledge needed to make it. As one last act as a shipwright, Kaku cast off the Going Merry out into the sea where the fury of the
   Aqua Laguna
   was currently besieging Water 7. With a mighty fall from the hideout, the Going Merry plunged into the raging sea.

   Without hesitation, the Straw Hats and their allies boarded the ship and made a desperate escape.

   Having escaped Enies Lobby on the Going Merry, everything seemed right in the world for the Straw Hats. Unfortunately, the joy was short lived. The Going Merry suddenly broke apart in the middle of the ocean. Fortunately, a Galley-La ship carrying Iceburg and other workers appeared to rescue the passengers on board the Going Merry in time. Upon reuniting with the president since they left Water 7, Iceburg revealed the Going Merry's sudden appearance at Enies Lobby. After they had left Water 7 for Enies Lobby, Iceburg found the ship beached on one of Water 7's shores, surprisingly undamaged from the fall. The ship then apparently asked Iceburg to fix her. Iceburg, though shocked at hearing the voice and found the damage to be irreparable, reluctantly complied, using his expertise to patch up the ship enough for it to sail for a limited time. To his surprise once again, the ship thanked him and then suddenly set off by itself into the raging seas, braving the
   storm
   that was then going on. He also told them that the ship was now in a state completely beyond repair and needed to finally rest in peace and that she was a special ship, treated with care.

As the ship was burned, snow appeared and the Merry spoke to her crew. Despite the crew feeling like they really did not take care of the ship to the fullest during her time with them, the Going Merry did not hold any hard feelings towards them. This, as she explained, was because the crew actually did take care of her, and for that, she was grateful. As Merry apologized to the crew that it wanted to take them "a little further", Luffy cried back that they are the ones who should be apologizing for their way of treating the ship; Merry assured them it was happy. With her last words and a tearful goodbye from her crew, the Going Merry was finally destroyed, and an invaluable member was forever lost.

   Usopp, who was so dedicated to saving Merry that it blinded him from the truth to the point of nearly severing his ties with the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates, came to realize his mistake upon Merry's funeral. Although difficult, he accepted that he had to let the ship go, and eventually went to apologize to the crew before being re-accepted.

   When Usopp, Chopper and
   Brook
   were riding on the Mini Merry II, Brook asked about the little ship's design. Remembering that Brook was recruited after the Going Merry's demise, Usopp
   recounted
   to him about how the Merry was their first ship and all the adventures they had together. Touched by the Going Merry's life story, Brook cried that he would have wanted to meet the ship. When back abroad the Thousand Sunny, Usopp caught a glimpse of Merry's
   Klabautermann
   , and shed a tear for the ship that he loved so much.

   In the manga, the Going Merry had been accumulating damage on her voyage in the Grand Line, with the most notable damage happening with the Straw Hat pirates encounter with
   Laboon
   (the figurehead breaks and Luffy tears off one of the masts to use as a weapon),
   Wapol
   (an entire part of the ship's side gets eaten by him) and later taking heavier damage while escaping from the Marines during the Straw Hat's departure from
   Arabasta
   (several massive iron harpoons pierce the ship). In the anime, this damage is more or less completely fixed, and they sustain most of it from their

    Caravel class ships were one of the few ships designed for sea travel that also could travel inland via rivers. Due to their lightness, caravels were faster and more agile than many of the bigger ships. As such, merchants favored them highly despite their low cargo hold. Yet despite their advantages, as the Going Merry implied, they were fragile vessels that could not take as much battering as many other vessels could.
