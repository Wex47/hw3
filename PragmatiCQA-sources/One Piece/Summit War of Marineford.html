During the battle, Newgate suspected that the surrounding battleships may be involved in the Marine's secret plans, and had some of his allies focus on targeting the ships. About one-and-a-half hours after the battle's start,
   Sentomaru
   brought an army of
   Pacifista
   units as their master strategy to eliminate the pirates. However, they were ordered not to attack the Whitebeard Pirates themselves, but instead the subordinate crews, in order to make it look like Whitebeard made a deal with the Marines to spare his crew in exchange of his subordinate crews, all according to Sengoku's plan. The Pacifista then began an encircling formation around Marineford, to prevent the pirates from escaping, with the pirates realizing that if they didn't target the battleships, they would have no way to escape.

Due to his intense hatred for Roger who slaughtered his old crew, feeling betrayed, Squard stabbed Whitebeard before revealing the lies of the Marines. Despite being stabbed, Newgate forgave Squard, before destroying the frozen tsunamis, allowing anyone who doubted him to escape, though this action reaffirmed all the pirates belief in Whitebeard. With this, Whitebeard himself joined the war. He launched a devastating quake that tilted the entire island and the sea around it, but it was stopped by the three

   Once most of the Marines retreated to the platform, the "Encircling Wall" rose, trapping the pirates in the bay. Even though a part of the wall's mechanism was damaged by Oars Jr.'s blood and pressed down by his body, preventing it from rising, Sengoku ordered Akainu to proceed to launch his "Ryusei Kazan" to devastate the pirates, as well as to melt the ice floor, robbing the pirates of their foothold, as well as destroying Whitebeards ships' including the
   Moby Dick
   . The pirates, losing more and more of their footing desperately tried to destroy the wall or reach Oars's body, which was now the only way into the plaza. Luffy, in desperation to save Ace, requested Jinbe to throw him over the wall with a stream of water. When Luffy bypassed the barrier to get into the inner plaza of Marineford, he landed right in front of the three admirals, whom he promptly attacked and attempted to bypass. Luffy was repelled, and the Marines attempted to execute Ace, but failed when the executioners were attacked. Surprisingly

   Though Luffy failed in his challenge, his actions, as well as Oars Jr. regaining consciousness, allowed the Whitebeard pirates a chance to enter the plaza. They did this by having all allies converge on a point where Whitebeard had his last coated galleon-sized paddle-ship surface, which Oars then carried into the plaza. Luffy who was already exhausted, was targeted by the Vice Admirals and Admirals, which ended up causing him to collapse from his culminated wounds and exhaustion. However, still determined to reach Ace, he begged Ivankov to give him one more
   Emporio Tension Hormone
   boost, despite the after effects, so he could continue to fight for his brother's life, which the Newkama King reluctantly grants. Unfortunately, Whitebeard started succumbing to old age, injuries and illness, which distracted his commanders, causing him, Jozu and Marco to all suffer injuries from the Admirals they were fighting. Jozu ended up getting completely frozen, while Marco had Seastone cuffs attached to him, preventing him from healing himself. With the Whitebeard pirates strongest members incapacitated, the Marines, having replaced their executioners, attempted to continue Ace's beheading. However they were stopped again, this time by Luffy, who unconsciously released a burst of
   Haoshoku Haki
   throughout the entire Marineford plaza, knocking out the executioners as well as many others in his path, leaving everyone shocked as he continued running towards Ace.

   While Luffy's outburst temporarily paralyzed the battlefield, it consequently caused the Marines to redouble their efforts to kill him, with Vice Admiral

   As the pirates retreated on Whitebeard's orders, Akainu launched another "Great Eruption" at them, while insulting Whitebeard for being a "loser" after calling the pirates to retreat. An enraged Ace stayed behind to retaliate with his "
   Fire Fist
   ", only for it to be consumed by the superior magma. Akainu claimed that he would allow neither brother to leave Marineford alive no matter what; due to their bloodlines, their very existence is the ultimate crime, before targeting Luffy with a molten fist, only for Ace to intercept it.

   As the entire Marineford saw how Akainu pierced Ace through his torso and burned his vital organs, retaliation from the commanders begins. Ace then gave his final words to Luffy, before dying in his little brother's arms, causing him to undergo a mental breakdown and fall unconscious. This instantly defeated the Whitebeard Pirates purpose, and changes the tides of the war to favor the Marines. However, Marco managed to encourage the pirates to fight on to protect Luffy, the brother that Ace sacrificed himself to save. Amidst all the chaos, Akainu continued to target Luffy, but was defeated by an enraged Whitebeard. Afterwards, Newgate managed to literally split Marineford into two, separating the pirates from the Marines and causing a defeated Akainu to fall into a crater.

To test out his newest ability, he attempted to sink Marineford whole, only to be promptly sent flying, along with the rest of his crew, by an enormous shockwave delivered by Sengoku in his Buddha form, with Garp joining in on the confrontation. After Sengoku taunted Blackbeard for his hubris, Blackbeard retorted on how he was looking forward to see Sengoku out on the field, and the three lock themselves in a duel to the death.

As Blackbeard leaves the scene, the absence of a designated rival and presence of a powerful Emperor convinces Sengoku to concede to the necessity of a ceasefire, ordering the Marines to tend to the wounded. With Shanks declaring that the Whitebeard and Red Hair Pirates will retrieve the bodies of Ace and Newgate, the Summit War of Marineford had finally reached its long-anticipated conclusion, however short it may have been.

   While the World Government had achieved its goal of executing Whitebeard and Ace, the battle was arguably a pyrrhic victory of sorts as it costed the World Government considerable resources and men, led to the loss of several strong individuals, including a Marine Admiral. Instead of being the deterrent towards piracy that the Marines hoped it would be, several very dangerous prisoners escaped without being caught and ended up being the catalyst for an even greater age of piracy when Whitebeard confirmed the existence of One Piece to the world.

   Overall, the war ended with a new, greater threat for the Marines in the form of Blackbeard and his crew. It also served to increase pirate presence worldwide. This led to a giant shift in policy for the Marines, switching from defending citizens to mounting an offensive against pirates, which was reflected by the location of the new Marine headquarters.
