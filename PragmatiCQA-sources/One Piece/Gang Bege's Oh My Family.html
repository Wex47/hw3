   After escaping from
   Totto Land
   , the
   Fire Tank Pirates
   were casually sailing the sea on their stolen
   Tartes
   ship since their
   original ship
   was destroyed. Suddenly,
   Chiffon
   declared that she wants to reunite with her long-lost twin sister,
   Lola
   , and
   Captain
   Bege
   immediately agrees to this. They then defeat an enemy pirate crew and steal their ship and make their way to
   Thriller Bark
   in
   Paradise
   , which was the last known location of Lola, only to be driven back from the
   Red Line
   due to the increased security at the
   Levely
   .
  </p>
  <p key="e38eba5d-44ed-4e82-935c-6ac403a81164">
   The Fire Tank Pirates then reach Dressrosa, where Bege decides to pick up supplies from. Upon landing at Dressrosa's West Port, they defeat two Marine soldiers and encounter a guitarist who mistakes Chiffon for Lola and congratulates her for finally finding a husband. After learning they are actually sisters, the guitarist informs the crew that Lola had arrived at Dressrosa just some days before, much to their total shock.
  </p>
  <p key="c5489793-3b2f-453a-8c54-f15f53bc8d2e">
   The crew enter the city, which still exhibits the remains of the destruction caused during the events of the
   Dressrosa Arc
   , including the ground scarred by
   <a href="Donquixote Doflamingo.html" key="58e0f72a-5330-4467-b688-00c86c8f6c68" title="Donquixote Doflamingo">
    Doflamingo's
   </a>
   Torikago
   . Disguised, they start to look and ask for Lola among the citizens, until
   Vito
   finds several men collapsed to the ground with kiss marks on them due to a vacuum-kissing spree by
   Kyuin
   . The reason for this is because the
   Germ Pirates
   , who chose to attack Dressrosa while
   King
   Riku
   was away, were spreading their "Kiss-Kiss Germ" among the citizens. Fortunately, Bege and Vito defeat them easily, but only to keep them from attracting unwanted attention from the Marines.
  </p>
  <p key="1caa1041-6e01-4f49-9ac6-cd8d8d4a47fd">
   At the same time, however, Chiffon was just about to get a haircut at a barber shop when she is suddenly caught and arrested by the Marines for her involvement with Bege. As she screams,
   Gotti
   notices this and chases after her, but is easily beaten by her captors. Bege and Vito were unable to help as they were under attack by citizens who were infected by the "Kiss-Kiss Germ". Gotti gets back up and goes after the Marines once again. After causing an explosion with his weapon-arm to distract the Marines, Gotti manages to rescue Chiffon. She thanks Gotti with a kiss while addressing him as a stranger, which confuses him. Suddenly, the real Chiffon appears along with the rest of the Fire Tank crew and the woman Gotti rescued is revealed to be Lola, and the twins tearfully embrace each other. The
   Risky Brothers
   also appear and thank the Fire Tank Pirates for rescuing their captain.
  </p>
  <p key="d00dc956-5d0c-4312-9c10-f892abc4ebea">
   Meanwhile, the
   Tontatta Pirates
   were sailing back from the Levely when they find a
   Tartes
   ship with the injured
   Pound
   on it near the coast of Green Bit.
  </p>
  <p key="2a2ceb8c-a933-481f-b532-8a3b565b149f">
   Back at Dressrosa, Lola asks Gotti to marry her as thanks for saving her. Before Gotti could answer, however, the Marines suddenly attack, forcing both the Fire Tank and
   Rolling Pirates
   to make a hasty getaway from the country. Both crews arrive at the Dressrosa port and find the Tontatta Pirates along with a patched up Pound, who Bege recognizes as the old man they saw when they escaped from
   Cacao Island
   . Pound, in turn, was brought to tears upon seeing both of his daughters and revealed himself to be their father, shocking the sisters. However, they refused to believe him and make their escape from the island while leaving behind Pound for the incoming Marines.
  </p>
  <p key="bb628b71-efed-41e0-8174-111b896b5040">
   Determined to be with his daughters, Pound swims after the Fire Tank Pirates' ship amidst the cannon fire, which surprises the sisters. As Pound gets close to the ship, he shows the crew a picture of the moment when
   Linlin
   literally kicks him out of the
   family
   with their newborn daughters in the background as proof of his claims. Upon seeing the photo, as well as his stubbornness, the sisters finally believe him after they recall their mother telling them that their father was a clingy person who never gives up no matter how many times he's kicked. As a result, they help their father onto the ship with ropes and then a tearful Pound happily embraces both of his daughters after 26 long years.
  </p>
  <p key="c46a3a81-1a36-4d64-8381-c85127ec2c0b">
   Later on, it is revealed that Gotti accepted Lola's marriage proposal and both the Fire Tank Pirates and Rolling Pirates celebrate at their wedding. As they happily celebrate, the Fire Tank Pirates' ship sails away as a Marine ship pursues them with cannons firing, which Bege considers to be part of the celebration.
