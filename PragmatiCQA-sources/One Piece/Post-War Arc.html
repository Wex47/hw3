This prompts Hancock musing to herself, wishing that she could have instead been in Luffy's place, making at least two members of Law's crew note to themselves how nice it must be to have the Pirate Empress herself looking out for the Straw Hat's well-being. When Ivankov asks Law why he saved Luffy, he claims that he had no obligation, and Ivankov understands that he had done it without thinking.

Although Blackbeard only took four prisoners with him, there were many Level 6 prisoners that were missing, having escaped during the chaos. Although Sengoku demands that wanted posters of the escaped criminals be sent throughout the world, Brannew claims that the World Government has chosen to hide the information of the Level 6 prisoners escaping, lest the world lose trust in the World Government, a decision which enrages Sengoku.

   With Ivankov and the Newkama having left on the stolen Marine ship to sail back to the Kamabaka Kingdom, Luffy, Hancock, Jinbe, and the Heart Pirates all return to Amazon Lily, with special permission given to the Heart Pirates to land on a small beach on the island but are forbidden from going elsewhere. Luffy has woken up, and is now desperately trying to convince himself that Ace's death was but a dream. He goes on a rampage, with the Heart Pirates unable to calm him. Law comments that if Luffy does not calm down soon, his wounds will open up and certainly kill him.

   At the central palace in Amazon Lily, Hancock is ecstatic to hear that Luffy is awake once more. She wishes to see him at once, though Elder Nyon prevents this as she sees such an action as a bad example to her subjects, and that allowing the Heart Pirates to even be on the island was a special exception already. Hancock's sisters, remembering that she had not eaten since she returned, tell her to eat, but only convince her to prepare a feast for Luffy so that he can recover. Nyon says that once Luffy is at full strength, she will permit him to see Hancock. To herself, Nyon thinks about both Hancock's strengthening "love sickness" and Luffy's incredible survival, going through both Impel Down and Marineford.

Bepo wonders whether or not there are any female bears on the island, at which the other crewmembers are angered. Sitting on a rock not too far from them is Law who is looking at the Straw Hat he has in his hand with a curious look.

   After recalling everything that had happened to him right before he fainted, and finally accepted that he is not dreaming, Luffy finally calms down. Jinbe watches over him, remembering that he promised Ace that if he died he would protect him. Luffy cries out to Jinbe, asking him if Ace died, to which Jinbe confirms Luffy's belief, making Luffy cry even harder. Jinbe begins to tear at the sight of Luffy's remorse.

   Ten years ago, on the road to Mt. Colubo on
    Dawn Island
    ,
    Garp
    is bringing a child Luffy to be raised by
    Curly Dadan
    , who has already raised Ace since his birth, ten years before the flashback. At the time Luffy, who had already met Shanks and obtained his

    Gomu Gomu no Mi
   </a>
   , is angry at his grandfather since he has already made up his mind into becoming the Pirate King, much to Garp's dismay, as he wishes for Luffy and Ace to become great marines. After knocking on Dadan's door in her large house in the forest, Dadan, a large, bandit woman, and two of her henchmen step out of the door. Dadan complains how much of a hassle Ace is, and that she can barely handle him. To her surprise, Garp tells her that he is entrusting her with Luffy. Claiming that she could not possibly raise both Luffy and Ace, Garp reminds her that he knows all about her illegal activities and that if she refused, he would turn her and her men in. She then changed her mind and accepted it with anger. Suddenly, Luffy is attacked with a ball of spit. Turning to see who it came from, he sees Ace for the first time. Although Garp tells both Ace and Luffy to get along, the two stare at each other with seeming hatred.
  </p>
  <p key="3207bbe9-f86f-41d6-a276-59e5deb6923a">
   And so Luffy was left with the bandits though quickly shows his disdain for them due to his previous encounter not too long ago. The bandits soon sit down to eat though Luffy complains about the small proportion he has gotten while Ace has a bigger one. Dadan explains that since Ace had slain the buffalo he gets the bigger meat plus Luffy should count himself lucky that Ace is sharing with them. Dadan then tries to take advantage of Luffy and make him her servant. But her attempts backfire due to Luffy's simple-minded nature. Ace soon heads off on his own with Luffy following after, forgiving him for spitting on him earlier and trying to be his friend. But Ace ignores him and knocks down a tree to prevent Luffy from following him.
  </p>
  <p key="77f81e30-4a2c-4d5c-864b-74349e5df0fe">
   Luffy manages to break through however and continue after Ace on a rope bridge. Annoyed, Ace knocks him off and into the chasm below. Ace returns to the mountain bandits and claims he does not know where Luffy is when asked, which Dadan roughly shrugs off as not being her responsibility. A week later, Luffy returns to the cabin battered but alive. When asked what happened, Luffy claims he was chased off a cliff by wolves. The next day Ace heads off on his own again and Luffy tags along after him. And so it went Ace would venture out and Luffy would try to follow him, each time with Luffy ending up in one dangerous situation after another which Ace would purposely lead Luffy into.
  </p>
  <p key="0f328d1a-67b1-414f-8c59-85a09b41fed9">
   After an unknown period of time, Luffy eventually managed to follow Ace out of the forest and into a junkyard area of the island known as "
    The Gray Terminal
    " where there is no law, no doctors and many homeless and dangerous individuals roam. Making his way through the junkyard, Luffy finds Ace with a boy his own age named
    Sabo
    . Ace shows Sabo some money he snagged off people at the front gate of the area when he came in and its revealed the two are collecting money for a pirate ship. Luffy overhears the two and tries to get the duo to let him join them. But they tie him to a tree and after pondering what to do with him, agree to just kill him.
  </p>
  <p key="ffb04fec-4d41-4738-be28-86863f426bea">
   However, Luffy's yelling attracts attention to the three and the trio hide as the
    Bluejam Pirates
    arrive led by a man named
    Porchemy
    . His subordinates reveal it was they whom Ace had stolen the money from. At first, it seems the three managed to hide before he spotted them, but Luffy somehow ended up near them and is captured. Porchemy threatens him but Luffy claims he does not know anything about the money, though his expression states otherwise and he accidentally gives away Ace's name. Porchemy then carries Luffy off stating he will make him talk as Ace and Sabo look on in horror.
  </p>
  <p key="7b6c08bc-14f7-4596-a2c3-1bb0549a6d06">
   The pirates take Luffy back to their hideout, Luffy, however, yells he will not tell them anything. Porchemy tries to kill Luffy with a giant mallet but due to his

    Gomu Gomu no Mi
   </a>
   , it just bounces off Luffy. Porchemy then switches to spiked boxing gloves which indeed penetrate Luffy's defenses. Porchemy then has the others go search for Ace and Sabo as he tries to get Luffy to talk. Meanwhile, the said boys have started moving their hidden funds, scared that the pirates will come looking for it when Luffy breaks. As they do that, the pirates ask around the junkyard on any info on Ace and Sabo but no one gives them anything useful. Sunset comes and the two boys have managed to move their loot successfully. Sabo, who went to see how Luffy was doing, rushes back and informs Ace that Luffy had not told the pirates where the money is. Not far from their location the leader of the pirates, Captain
    Bluejam
    himself grows impatient when his money is not found. Back with Porchemy and Luffy, the former savagely roughing up Luffy to get him to cough up the information. One of the pirates tries to get Prochemy to lay off as Luffy is being beaten to the point he can no longer say anything. Even those outside the building feel sympathy for Luffy but comment that no law official will come to that part of the island even with the murder that happens every now and then.
  </p>
  <p key="cc969ce5-fd58-41b1-bea5-9591d434e178">
   Despite all the abuse he taken, Luffy steadfastly refuses to rat out Ace. Porchemy, tired of getting nowhere, proceeds to kill him. Ace and Sabo suddenly burst into the hideout which the pirates instantly recognize they were the ones that took their money. Porchemy grabs Ace but Sabo saves him by knocking Porchemy down. He then grabs a knife, cuts Luffy free, and runs yelling at Ace to do so as well. However Ace decides to stay behind citing that when he faces an enemy he does not run. Sabo runs back to aid him and the two fight against Porchemy. In the end, the two come out victorious and Porchemy later faces the wrath of Captain Bluejam who kills him for his failure. Back in the forest, Sabo scolds Ace for his stubbornness and Ace scolds Luffy whose crying his eyes out after the encounter. Luffy thanks the two before Ace asks Luffy why he did not talk when he was being tortured. Luffy responds that he would not have Ace as a friend anymore and that he does not have anyone on the island to rely on since he cannot go back to
    Foosha Village
    and he does not trust bandits. Plus he does not wish to be alone. Ace, thinking back to when he was mocked by those that hated

   </a>
   , realizes he in the same boat. As Luffy and he begin to bicker over pointless things, Sabo realizes that the pirates will come looking for them. Thus, he invites himself to live with Dadan much to her annoyance. Since then, Ace, Sabo and Luffy hang out together in the forest fighting any beast, bandit or pirate that got in their way. One day while they were out, Dadan picked up a newspaper and found out some shocking news,
    Celestial Dragons
    were coming to the island for some unknown reason.
  </p>
  <p key="98de1e04-6a5d-4583-948e-428b1dc50f76">
   The boys however are unaware of this and continue training and running around the mountain, getting stronger day by day. Beyond the Gray Terminal is an area known as the Great Gate which is part of a wall to another area called the
    Goa Kingdom
    . Foosha Village is also part of this kingdom though is largely forgotten due to the mountains around the area. The kingdom is divided into sections: The Edge Town, which is still near the Gray Terminal through has buildings and is home to delinquents and vagrants. The Town Center where the middle class live and in the center guarded by another high wall, is the High Town where the royals and nobles live and is said to be the most beautiful country in the East Blue though is segregated due to the class system.
  </p>
  <p key="511855ce-542a-4259-8068-ac1ce31d95e5">
   The three boys sneak past the Great Wall one day during the trash dumping of the Gray Terminal, into the Town Center and pull a dine and dash. Escaping out the window of a diner and running from the guards. However, one of the citizens recognizes Sabo and calls out to him but Sabo just ignores the man. Once back in the forest, Ace and Luffy demand to know if he keeping anything from them. After some goading, Sabo comes clean and reveals he is actually a noble who ran away from home.
  </p>
  <p key="8860f327-130e-4177-a19d-4528d9542b34">
   The reason for such was that his parents always pressured him and were more concerned about their financial and social security than him, making Sabo feel like a burden and alone in the world; hence his desire to become a pirate as he wishes to feel free from their overbearing rule and write a book about their adventures. Ace and Luffy agree wholeheartedly; the former wanting to do it for acknowledgement, and the latter of course wanting to be Pirate King though Ace and Sabo are disbelieving of it. Regardless Ace pulls out some alcohol and pours them into sake cups, claiming from that day forward they were brothers.

Ace and Luffy can do nothing more but beg him to stay as he lead away.

Luffy and Ace join the Bluejam Pirates at the request of the captain, and then carry cargo to marked locations in Gray Terminal with other pirates. Meanwhile Sabo, accompanied by his father, is being questioned for the crimes he has committed. His father urges him to place all the blame on Luffy and Ace to save his family's name, however Sabo refuses and is hit to the ground, and his father is forced to bribe the officer with currency.

Sterry tells Sabo that Gray Terminal will be burned to an ash along with its inhabitants, and that this had been planned for months in accordance with the arrival of the Inspection Unit, and Tenryubito. Sabo escapes from the family manor at night, and overhears a group of Royal Guards discussing the plan. It is revealed to Sabo in their discussion that the burning of Gray Terminal will proceed tomorrow, and that the Bluejam Pirates will be behind the act.

Meanwhile, Bluejam reveals to Luffy and Ace that the cargo they had carried was oil and gunpowder, and that Gray Terminal will be set alight that day. Luffy and Ace react in outrage and are quickly apprehended by Bluejam's underlings, Bluejam informs them that they can no longer be left alive, then asks where their "likely" hoard of treasure is located.

The Bluejam Pirates stand at the Great Gate of Goa surrounded by the fire, as it is revealed that they will receive titles from the King, become nobles, and live in High Town as payment for their services. However the gate will not open for the pirates, as Bluejam realizes that their bargain has been betrayed, and they have been left to die.

   Meanwhile Luffy and Ace manage to cut themselves loose after being bound to a tree, whilst surrounded by the encroaching flames. In the Town Center, rumor had circulated amongst citizens that the Bluejam Pirates were responsible for the atrocity, in attempt to halt the Inspection Unit and Tenryubito from visiting the island. Sabo is chased by the Royal Guards and noted as being the last citizen remaining in Edge Town. While running he crashes and falls to the ground, to be aided by an unknown cloaked person. In a frenzy Sabo tells the person of the atrocity that the nobles had concocted, and that he is ashamed of being born a noble.

Dragon then follows by saying that he still lacked the power to change it, and will listen and remember Sabo's story at the boys behest. Luffy and Ace are seen fleeing from engulfing flames, as an individual wearing high-heels informs Dragon that preparations have been made.

   Meanwhile, Bluejam and his crew are still at the gate. The pirate captain remembering the king of Goa promising him he will make Bluejam and his crew nobles for carrying out the trash burning job. The shock of being betrayed hits Bluejam hard as he watch his ship, caught on fire, burn down. He and his crew now trapped in the same fire they started. At the palace, a noble girl ask her father why they are burning trash mountain and the people inside. Which the father responds that because the people there were not born nobles which the daughter agrees with. Back at the Gray Terminal, the residents are still trying to find a way out of the fire, among such being Luffy and Ace who are not having any luck. If that was not bad enough, Bluejam finds them and has them restrained despite protests from the boys that they should worry about escaping. Bluejam once more inquires about the money Ace and Sabo hid, commenting that their efforts will go to waste if the fire gets it. Ace, though hesitant, agrees with Bluejam and tells them where the treasure is. Nonetheless Bluejam continues to keep them in captivity in case they were lying since Sabo was with the boys and Bluejam's newfound hatred of nobles has him thinking Sabo was just using Ace and Luffy to make himself look superior. These comments anger Luffy and Ace, the former who bites the pirate holding him and ends up attacked and wounded as a result.

   Just as the pirate about to kill Luffy, Ace shouts at them to stop unwittingly unleashing Haki and causing the pirates save for Bluejam to faint. Bluejam attacks Ace but is stopped by the arrival of Dadan and her band of bandits. They grab the boys then prepare to run, but Ace once again refuses to and faces down Bluejam. Dadan decides to stay with Ace while the rest of the bandits get Luffy to safety on her orders. Meanwhile the rest of the residents of trash mountain are still trapped with no where left to run. As all seems lost, a pathway suddenly clears from out of nowhere to the ocean and a boat. The residents quickly take it while those on the boat, revealed to be Dragon and his revolutionaries (among which are

Dragon answers that the island is nothing more than a blueprint for the world's future and that there is no happiness in a world that views people as "useless". He then vows to change the world and offers any of the trash mountain residents who are willing to fight to come with him.

   Meanwhile, the bandits manage to escape but a caption comes up revealing that Ace and Dadan did not return as The Gray Terminal continues to burn. The next day, Luffy tries to go out and search for Ace and Dadan but the bandits tell him that his wounds are still recovering. Plus the soldiers of Goa are "cleaning up" after the fire, including any survivors in the area. At the Gray Terminal the guards are doing just that though remark there are not as my corpses as they thought there would be, shrugging it off that they burned in the fire. News of Bluejam's boat burning reaches Sabo's ears, whose father comments that it is futile for Sabo to run and that he should just listen to his parents' orders and make them proud. Sabo just ignores him and thinks of Luffy and Ace, wondering if they are okay before querying what the true meaning of freedom is.

   Soon the day the ship carrying the

It revealed to be Sabo at the helm who prepares to sail off from the kingdom. The kingdom's residents try to get Sabo to turn back but he ignores them, unaware that one of Dadan's crew,

   Back at the bandits' hideout, Luffy tries once more to go search for Ace and Dadan but the bandits refuse to let Luffy do so due to him still healing. They tell Luffy they know how he feels and that they sent Dogra to go check out the grounds. Back at the ceremony, the crowd look on in shock as Sabo's boat continues to burn. A servant tells the Celestial Dragon, Saint
    Jalmack
    , there was a child on the ship. But Jalmack comments that if he raised a pirate flag then it did not matter but is more angry at the fact that a commoner crossed his path. Sabo meanwhile tries to put out the flames of his ship, but Jalmack fires again and this time sinks the boat presumably killing Sabo as well. The crowd continues to look on in horror at this turn of events while the officials order the ship's remains be cleaned up so as not to upset the Celestial Dragon any further. Back at the hideout, Ace suddenly arrives carrying Dadan, both bruised and burned but still alive much to the joy of everyone. Luffy especially who hugs Ace who in turn bops him on the head for crying about him.

   Ace then explains that they managed to beat Bluejam but their escape route got cut off. Dadan got burns on her body but the duo managed to escape into the middle forest. They hid in the riverbank till everything died down then Ace stole some medicine from the town to keep Dadan alive. Dadan is then patched up and set down to rest as the day goes on. Dadan asks why Ace did not run which he explains that he was afraid if he did, he'd lose something important to him, in this case; Luffy. Dadan soon realizes the similarities to him and Roger as she remembered Garp explained that Roger was the same way, not running because he was fearless but rather to keep the enemy from following after his crewmates. It was this trust that convinced Garp to take care of Ace in secret.

   Dogra soon returns and Luffy tells him of the good news of Dadan and Ace coming back. However this joy is short lived as Dogra tells the others of what happened to Sabo. Ace attacks him instantly thinking its a lie but Dogra, being a rogue, knows what its like to not to want to return to someplace they do not want to. Luffy begins to cry again and Ace starts to blame himself for not going back to get Sabo. He yells at Dogra to tell him who killed Sabo and starts to run off. Dadan pins him to the floor, telling him that Sabo's enemy was the whole country and he does not have the power to take fight against it. If he did it now, that he will just die and be forgotten and that if Ace wants to change the world he must get strong enough to do so like his father. She then has the bandits tie Ace to a tree as he keeps struggling while Luffy continues to cry. Morning comes and Ace has cooled down when the bandits come to check on him. A letter bird arrives with a message from Sabo to Luffy and Ace. The bandits cut Ace free so he can read it, which he does as he walks back to the cliff where they made their bond. The letter starts off with Sabo worrying about their safety but believing they are alright. He then explains he is going out to sea, anywhere that away from the country and hopes to become stronger and freer then any pirate on the sea. He then closes out asking Ace to take care of their younger brother Luffy. As Ace finishes the letter, he cannot help but cry himself for his fallen friend.

   Luffy is lying with his face on the ground on the cliff where Ace read Sabo's letter. He is crying, and Ace punches him in the head, scolding him for his behavior, saying that their hidden treasure is gone, and that there is no point in having treasure if it cannot be protected. Luffy tearfully cries out his will to become stronger, in order to protect the ones he love, and then begs Ace to survive, to which he takes another punch. Ace then promises him that he will not die, since he has weak little brother to take care of. He then says that what killed Sabo was the "opposite of freedom", and that the two remaining brothers must obtain freedom and become pirates, even if that means making lot of enemies, even Garp. The two then agree to set sail on their 17th year and become pirates, as Sabo said them that children born from Noble families obtain truly their title at 18 years, and wanted to leave Goa at 17. Elsewhere on that night the Tenryubito reached Goa Kingdom: there are two brief scenes of Zoro's and Kuina's training, and then, in a small, unnamed port town in East Blue, Dragon is boarding on his ship, apologizing for his delay, asking for the conditions of an undetermined "him" and being told about the supplies being restocked.

The two start arguing over the utility of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, but are interrupted by the one they think is Sabo, but in reality is nothing else than rock: they are just remembering their beloved brother. Luffy states that Sabo was really a good brother, to which Ace angrily replies in a comical way, asking his brother if he wanted him to die instead. They return to Dadan's hideout and build two rudimentary shacks they name "Ace's country" and "Luffy's country", much to Dadan's surprise, as they want to survive alone and get stronger. Following this, the two adventure in the jungle and Luffy run across a fierce bear. Ace refuses to help him, because they must grow stronger alone, but when the animal severely injures Luffy off-screen, he desperately cries for him. He managed to bring Luffy back to the Bandit hideout, where the rubber boy is being treated by Dogra. Ace huddles up on the wall, saying to Luffy that he is sorry. Some time later, Makino pays visit to Ace, and he tells her of his intentions to meet Red-Haired Shanks and introduce himself to the man who once saved his brother's life. Ace is annoyed because Makino keeps smiling.

He happily says goodbye to the ones at the shore, Luffy, who is now 14, Makino, Woop Slap, Dogra, Magra and the other bandits, who wish him good luck in return. Dadan is not there, she remained in her hideout, where her subordinates inform her that Ace is already gone. She apparently remains impassive hearing it, saying that Garp will be angry with her and that Ace is always causing trouble. However, as her bandits tell her that Ace sent her a message, "Thank You", she burst out in tears, showing her sadness.

   Three more years pass, and a finally 17 years old Luffy is ready to set sail himself. He says goodbye to the Bandits, that cannot go to Fooshia Village because of its civilians. He thanks them, and then tells Dadan that he dislikes Mountain Bandits, to which she gets angry and shouts at him, but when the boy says that he likes them instead, the woman burst out in tears as she did 3 years before for Ace's departure. Luffy is then seen on a dinghy, in Fooshia Village. One of the citizens ask him to take one of their old fishing boats, but the boy refuses, content with his little boat. He then cries Sabo's name, telling his deceased brother of his departure. After saying farewell to his friends, he sets sail, and he rapidly defeats the King of the Coast off-screen, a feat commented by Dadan, Dogra and Magra, hidden behind a wall.
