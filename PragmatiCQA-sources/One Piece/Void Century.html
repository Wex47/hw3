   learned that the country was once connected with the rest of the

According to Oden, it is essential for the world to reconnect with Wano in order to move to the new era and thus its borders must open before Joy Boy returns.

   However, the people of Wano seem to be oblivious of why their country is isolated and what happened during the Void Century, despite the fact that the World Government cannot enforce the prohibition of research in the country. Most people in Wano do not know of what lies in the outside world in the first place.
