   The World Government is affiliated with roughly 170 countries from around the world.
   Member countries retain autonomy and run their own internal affairs (though the World Government does sometimes intervene), but cooperate with the World Government for international relations. Their political ideals are unknown and everything they do is considered to be right. Not everyone approves of their political ideals, as there are people like

   The World Government maintains an international order that claims to benefit all, making the world safe for the sake of everyone. Using the Marines, they pursue criminals endangering the lives of those who are innocent, protecting the people of each country in the world. The World Government, as the largest political power, holds full rights to halt or encourage any political action without question or opposition.

  <p key="229358e5-153c-4fbf-b568-dc2f9ebb40f0">
   However, the reality is that, unknown to most citizens (and many world leaders), the World Government's actions and policies tend to be secretly based on corruption or questionable motives. They hide the truth or ignore the rights of the people, with many individuals using justice to further their own aims. Individuals who are deemed enemies of the World Government are viciously hunted down and dealt with, and all those who walk along the same path as them are doomed to share the World Government's wrath.

   The World Government's power to release information on anyone as they please can often lead to the truth being suppressed, altered or ignored completely. Any countries attempting to protect or harbor criminals are at risk from the World Government, and

   Despite the institution of
   slavery
   being abolished publicly, the World Government still allows such practice in the underworld, mainly due to the Celestial Dragons' exceptional privileges; in fact, government agent themselves would buy slaves to be trained into soldiers or agents, in order to bolster the ranks of the Marines and Cipher Pols. For that, they conducted transactions with
   slave traders
   to obtain entry into different countries such as
   Elbaf

   The majority of the World Government appears to be centered around paranoia, as they appear to divide power very carefully. However, this paranoia can be manipulated as seen when
   Spandam
   persuaded the Five Elders to amend their original policy regarding the

   However the prison chief of

   explains that nations who decline to pledge loyalty to the World Government are conquered with their general populaces being enslaved to construct infrastructure.
   This policy is further validated by

   Subsequently, many affiliated nations cannot afford the tribute leading to famine, starvation and death for its citizens.
   The failure to provide these standard offerings will cause severe punishments such as capital punishment for its civilians or the withdrawal of resources and services provided by the World Government.

   All over the world, there are over 170 countries that are affiliates of the World Government. Within their own territory all these members have their own sovereign government that rules over its people. However, in the large World Government itself, those leaders are treated as equals and each have a seat within it. Among these member countries, not all are of the same kind. Some are large countries with kings as their leaders, while others are simply big cities that are governed by mayors.

   Nations who are affiliated with the World Government also gain its protection, and can be helped and defended by the Marines and Cipher Pol. However, member nations must pay a tax to the World Nobles known as the "Heavenly Tribute". These extravagant payments often take a toll on poorer countries, with the people on the island that the
   Donquixote Family
   moved to often starving to death from the loss of resources. Failure to make the payment seems to be very consequential, as affiliates make it their effort to meet the quota despite the resultant poverty.
   According to
   Marco
   , being unable to pay the Heavenly Tribute is the most common reason why a nation does not join the World Government. These nations often fall into ruin due to lacking the World Government's protection, and most if not all unaffiliated nations only manage to survive by becoming an

   The World Government does not tolerate any of their affiliate nations having associations with powerful pirates, as both Arabasta and Dressrosa were concerned with their friendly relationship with the
   Straw Hat Pirates
   , and Germa was disconnected from the World Government once their attempt to ally with the

    Big Mom Pirates

   became known. However, the Sakura Kingdom is still a member nation of the World Government despite bearing a pirate flag and Fish-Man Island is still affiliated with the government despite being under the protection of a pirate. Fraternization with lesser pirates, on the other hand, seem to be more permissible (or simply harder to detect), as the Goa Kingdom made deals with the
   Bluejam Pirates
   , and the king even once offered them the title of
   nobility
   for a great service (although he actually plotted to eliminate the crew once they served their purpose), while Kano Kingdom employs the
   Happo Navy
   . Water 7 is permitted to offer their shipwright services to anyone, even pirates, under the common understanding that the shipwright cannot control how their ships are being used by the clients.

   Joining them, Carmel set up an orphanage on Elbaf for children of all races, named the

   Carmel's deeds served to improve relations between Elbaf and the World Government. Despite these acts of benevolence and the goodwill earned from them, Carmel was in reality a spy and child trafficker working with the Government, supplying children who would be indoctrinated into serving the Marines or Cipher Pols.
   Additionally, the horrifying revelation that improved relations with the giants was a charade designed from the start as a means of granting Carmel access to better quality children. 52 years later, the Government would manipulate the Giant Warrior Pirates,
