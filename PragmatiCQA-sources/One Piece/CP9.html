   Unlike the eight official Cipher Police groups, CP9 members are not centered on intelligence gathering, but instead specialized in covert assassination of targets deemed a threat to the
   World Government
   .
   Members are gathered at childhood, and are trained both physically and mentally to become powerful killers, discarding emotions in order to become more efficient in missions.

   , the most powerful member in the organization's history, had become almost incapable of mercy or accepting weakness due to this;
   However, younger members such as
   Kaku
   have demonstrated a wider array of emotions and even compassion, proving the mind-molding is not always successful.

  <p key="c2d17caf-48d1-4539-913e-a3a576d88de2">
   CP9 had been subdivided into two teams when the whole group was not needed for a mission. One group consists of Kaku,

   Water 7

   The other group was sent to crush certain

   Tower of Justice
   , where they act as the final guardians of the
   Gates of Justice
   . It has been said that Enies Lobby's reputation of being impossible to conquer is due to the generations of CP9, and their strength. It was also stated that this generation of CP9 is the strongest in its history. Due to their extreme power, it seems that they all have rather arrogant and pompous attitudes; because of this, members of CP9 absolutely refuse to believe that "pirate scum" (no matter how powerful) could defeat them,
   which ultimately caused their downfall at the hands of the
   Straw Hat Pirates
   .

  <p key="82360b72-c6bd-4e10-b22f-567cadf272ac">
   Failure is unacceptable for CP9 and any member who does fail or is defeated will face harsh punishment. They will be fired then either killed or arrested. Part of the reason for this is to prevent information leaks.

   Ohara Incident

   Spandine

   1507
   , Lucci joined the CP9 at age 13 after completing his training in the Cipher Pol homeland and gained immediate notoriety after killing 500 royal guards and the pirates that tried to take over the unnamed kingdom.

   Before the
   Straw Hat Pirates
   sets out to explore Water 7 and search for the shipwrights, there was a problem in
   Dock One
   . A pirate captain named
   Mikazuki
   refused to pay the
   Galley-La
   shipwrights
   for fixing his ship. He was planning on fighting and robbing them. Kalifa informed Iceburg calmly about the ruckus and said her trademark line, "sexual harassment".

  <p key="916a004f-934f-4580-a9c1-97f4df0aa45b">
   Finally, one of the shipwrights "accidentally" slammed Mikazuki with a huge log. Kaku slashed one of the pirates' backs with a huge saw, while Lucci knocked down some pirates.

   Blueno was the first CP9 member to fight the Straw Hat Pirates at Enies Lobby, specifically against Luffy. Although he initially gained control of the battle using
   Rokushiki
   and his devil fruit, Blueno was outmatched when Luffy revealed his new Gear 2nd ability. With Gear 2nd, Luffy was able to easily keep up with Soru and heavily damaged the confident Blueno. Luffy then proceeds to defeat him as Blueno's last ditch effort, attempting to take Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Jet Bazooka with his Tekkai Gou, fails while he collapses shortly afterwards.

   The remaining members of CP9 faced the Straw Hats in battle. Franky defeated Fukurou after replenishing his cola supply. Kumadori was too powerful for Nami to defeat, but Chopper intervened. He was initially outmatched, but after resorting to Monster Chopper, he easily defeated Kumadori. Sanji, despite being stronger than Kalifa, was unable to defeat her because he could not kick a woman. Instead, Nami fought Kalifa and managed to defeat her. After being freed from his handcuffs to Sogeking, Zoro defeated Kaku. Sogeking was unable to defeat Jabra, but Sanji fought on Usopp's behalf and defeated Jabra. Luffy managed to defeat Lucci after a long and difficult battle, something none of the other Straw Hats could do. The defeated CP9 agents are left behind as the Buster Call begins to ravage the island. Spandam and his guards were sniped from a distance by Sogeking, Franky entered the battle and used Funkfreed's size against Spandam severely injuring him. Afterwards, Spandam's spine was snapped in half by Robin as the Straw Hats escaped Enies Lobby on the Going Merry.

The CP9 managed to evade the Marines and thus are considered fugitives by the World Government. The CP9 then crossed the sea train tracks to St. Poplar where they use their

   While bowling using their superhuman strength, Blueno noticed trouble in the town. The
   Candy Pirates
   appeared in the town causing problems for the citizens, so the CP9 stopped their bowling match and went to deal with the situation. Lucci kicked the captain of the Candy Pirates and another pirate while the rest boarded the ship and beat the Candy Pirates up much to the excitement and amazement of the townspeople. However, the townspeople are later horrified when Lucci kills the captain by crushing his skull. With all the negative attention, the CP9 decide that they cannot stay in St. Poplar. A little girl offered
   Kalifa
   a flower of thanks which Kalifa accepted while
   Fukurou

   The CP9 agents set sail on the Candy Pirates' ship, and returned to their home island, where children who will eventually become CP9 members were being trained. A group of Marines, commanded by
   Very Good
   , followed them there. CP9 refused to allow the Marines to disturb their homeland, and proceeded on fighting the Marines, and easily defeated them all.

   Afterwards,
   Spandam
   was in the hospital in horrible shape from the beatings he took from
   Nico Robin
   and
   Franky
   . He received a call from Lucci, warning him that he and the other members of the CP9 will eventually return. Afterwards, his father,
   Spandine
   , appeared and Spandam called for him to help in a plan to destroy the CP9. With that, the CP9 departed on their ship, surrounded by Very Good's body parts, and leave the flower of friendship given to Kalifa growing in the ground of their homeland.
