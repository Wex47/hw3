   are a group of the highest-ranking
   Celestial Dragons
   that make up the head of state for the
   World Government
   . They essentially hold the greatest authority over the entirety of the world; the only exception being the mysterious sovereign
   Im
   whom they answer to.

  <p key="e2422e30-cb85-4113-bea5-7f0782051493">
   Their influence over the World Government and its military is paramount and limitless, including command over the
   Marines
   ,
   Cipher Pol
   , and even the
   Seven Warlords of the Sea
   prior to their abolishment, making them one of the main antagonistic groups of the series.

   So far, none of their names have been revealed and it is unknown how they became the leaders of the World Government or how long they have been ruling it. They are almost always found in the Room of Authority in
   Pangaea Castle

   Despite being Celestial Dragons, none of the Five Elders wore the full-body white suit that their lower-ranking brethren wear. Also, none of them wear the bubble or glass case that separates their air supply from other people over their heads. They are all rather tall, comparable in height to the over 10 feet tall
   Sakazuki
   .
   It would appear that none of them has physically changed in appearance over the course of twenty-two years (from the destruction of Ohara to current times).

   Their primary concerns are protecting an unstable world from the influence of piracy and maintaining the public image of the World Government, going to great lengths to keep their oppressive reputation a secret from the public. They have ordered the killing of an entire island of people to hide the discovery of the Void Century, they have hidden the fact that Gecko Moria was beaten by Luffy and later ordered his silent assassination to make it look like he died in the war for a better image, and they have even kept the escape of Level 6 inmates of Impel Down a secret, a decision that even angered Sengoku, the former fleet admiral of the Marines.

   Though not to the same extent as the other World Nobles, they take great pride in their heritage, as at least one of them considered the Nefertari Family to be traitors for not joining their ranks 800 years ago. Unlike other World Nobles, they are capable of showing respect and reverence to a few people such as Shanks and Im, and that they do not wear the same full-body suits and bubbles that separate their air supply from the lesser status when in their presence. Also unlike their lower ranking brethren, who mainly enjoy abusing their own powers for hedonistic pleasures, the Five Elders show themselves to be more responsible and concerned of the world's activities and even demonstrate being regretful and upset at times such as when they ordered the death of all of Ohara's scholars. This shows that despite being willing to take extreme and questionable measures, the Five Elders, unlike most World Nobles, are not without remorse. While typical Celestial Dragons would attack anyone of lower social statuses who tried to argue or protest with them, the Five Elders are more tolerant in that they are willing to at least give the benefit of counterarguments, as when Sakazuki openly insulted them, they bickered with him instead of threatening him with death.

   Four Emperors

   Whitebeard Pirates

   Will of D.

   's resignation from the Seven Warlords of the Sea and abdication of his throne, Fleet Admiral
   Sakazuki
   confronted the Five Elders about this, where they engaged in a heated argument. Sakazuki angrily asked the elders why the whole world had to be misled for Doflamingo's sake, noting that if an incident like this were to occur again, he as fleet admiral would be disgraced. The elders ignored him, saying that they were not concerned with his reputation as the
   Marines
   were only the public face of the World Government, and that the case had been left to the
   Cipher Pol
   .

  <p key="df801ad0-2ef1-4117-b81c-ffdeb146cc9a">
   Sakazuki retorted that even the elders had been walked over by the Celestial Dragons and called them their puppets. They responded in anger, blaming Sakazuki for Kuzan joining Blackbeard. Sakazuki replied that Kuzan's actions after he resigned from the Marines were not the concern of the government or the Marines. Suddenly, a Marine interrupted the meeting and reported about what transpired on Dressrosa. Much to their shock and displeasure, they learned of Doflamingo's defeat at Luffy's hands.

   Fujitora
   publicly announced Doflamingo's defeat to the world along the exposure of the crimes he committed by abusing his Warlord of the Sea position. Since the announcement was given before the elders were informed of it, this prevented them from covering up the debacle, allowing the
   Straw Hat Pirates
   to take credit for exposing the Heavenly Yaksha's criminal enterprises.

   The Five Elders questioned Shanks on why he felt it was necessary to speak with them despite the
   Levely
   being so important and his criminal status not being appropriate for global diplomacy. They stated the only reason Shanks was granted a private audience with them was because he is one of the Four Emperors. Shanks expressed his gratitude and the Elders ordered their guards to leave their chambers. Shanks conveyed his desire to discuss a certain pirate with the Five Elders.

   Sometime after the Levely had formally begun, the Five Elders headed towards the chamber containing the
   Empty Throne
   as they discussed
   Nefertari Cobra
   's request to have an audience with them even though they saw the
   Nefertari Family
   as nothing more than traitors to the
   World Nobles
   for choosing to stay in the "world below". Upon arriving at the chamber of the Empty Throne, the Five Elders quickly knelt down as they were greeted by a mysterious figure who then proceeded to sit upon the Empty Throne itself, a figure whom they addressed as
   Im
   , the true ruler of the World Government.
