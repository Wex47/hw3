   (who later left). They existed before the
   Sun Pirates
   but joined with them when they were formed. After the death of
   Fisher Tiger
   , they split from
   Jinbe
   's crew after he became a
   Warlord
   and became their own crew once again. They believed they were above humans as the stronger species and looked down on them as inferior. After they were defeated, they were arrested. Due to their actions and role, they are the main antagonists of the
   Arlong Park Arc
   . After their leader's defeat by the
   Straw Hats
   , they are arrested and the crew itself is disbanded. Momoo was never taken into custody and Hachi later escaped.

   Arlong's flag is that of a saw-nosed shark turned to the left with the tail curving inward. Around the shark is a semi-oval with three curves emitting from it. Behind the shark is a cross bone. This flag is tattooed onto all members of the crew. Several members of the
   New Fish-Man Pirates
   ,
   Hody Jones
   and
   Hammond
   in particular, also have this tattooed on to their bodies, out of respect for Arlong and his ideals.

   Not only did they have the advantage of being born Fish-Men, but the crew were fearsome fighters and almost unbeatable underwater. Members of this particular crew also seemed to be stronger than most other fish-men, though this is probably to be expected, having been once led by a Warlord-level pirate, Jinbe, and having experience from the
   <a href="Grand Line.html" key="508e3ab3-3a78-411e-a230-4e681e4410f4" title="Grand Line">

   . Hatchan, in particular, was able to best three other fish-men, much like himself, from time to time in a matter of seconds. For the
   Straw Hats
   , this was the toughest of their early fights, pushing them all to their limits (though much of the pressure on Sanji and Zoro was due to Luffy's recklessness and Zoro's injury).
  </p>
  <p key="6470d319-3985-40f5-b351-f38fafc10c57">
   Their leader Arlong was not bothered by Luffy having a

   power and took advantage of his weakness to the effects of the sea. Arlong had a keen eye for talent that could be used for his ambitions and was able to make use of the skills bestowed upon him and his crewmates, even though he had lacked the resources to pay for more experienced soldiers such as Hyouzou. With Nami's maps, their abilities increased even further, as, among other things, they could take advantage of ocean currents by blocking them with boulders to create whirlpools. With the Marines focusing their attention on the Grand Line and the incapacitation of all other major East Blue pirate crews by the Straw Hats, there would have been nothing to stop them from taking over East Blue if the Straw Hat Pirates had not intervened.

  <p key="4efd6235-7797-40bb-9963-cc636de9c50c">
   Though the opinions and ideals of the crew were extreme, they displayed a high level of brotherhood amongst themselves and even towards Nami despite her species divide. Arlong looked after his crew members and even though he betrayed Nami, he did so because he did not want to lose her talent. On top of this, in the final moments of the battle with Luffy, he stated that Nami was his crew member and would be forever, and while he never displayed any regard for her as a friend he was prepared to fight to keep her in the crew. If humans insulted their group, Arlong would react to the insult, and due to the high level of concern amongst his officers they would attempt to keep his temper under control. When weaker members of his crew were hurt, Arlong would seek out revenge on those who had committed the act against those crew members. The level of companionship between the pirate group was therefore quite high in comparison to other crews who do not even show concern when a crewmate is hurt, defeated or even killed. There was also a high level of respect amongst their crew towards Arlong and his officers while Arlong overall gave a high level of respect back to all members of his crew, including Nami.
  </p>
  <p key="15860464-8eb0-4c9b-b954-fe24e1204c29">
   On top of this, many of their crew members carried the "mark of the sun" and had previously been in the
   Sun Pirates
   . Although not all of those who carried the mark were
   slaves
   , this is still worth noting as the Arlong Pirates had a number of crew members who had subject to the shared experiences of those on board the Sun Pirates ship. The result would have meant that, at the very least, they had ties to the events of their era, with a few, or possibly all, of those former members having been driven by those personal experiences as former slaves.
  </p>
  <p key="80e9972a-2300-4318-9eda-be17f921c917">
   The crew's loathing towards humanity was quite well known, and had a huge influence on the
   New Fish-Man Pirates
   , who used Arlong's Jolly Roger as "an empty symbol for human-hating fish-men to gather under." To this end,
   Hody Jones
   and
   Hammond
   even tattooed the symbol on their own bodies, despite having lost respect for Arlong himself for being defeated by Luffy.

   After the death of

   Hyouzou
   and
   Vander Decken IX

   Ten years before the present storyline, the Arlong Pirates invaded an island and forced the residents to pay a large monthly tax for their own survival—
   100,000 per adult, and
   50,000 per child.
   Bell-mère
   was only able to pay for her daughters, so Arlong killed her as an example, leaving her adopted daughters

   and
   Nojiko
   alone. Seeing how skilled at map-making Nami was at such as early age, Arlong forced her to become the navigator of his crew. In order to convince her, he struck a deal—if she could somehow gather
   100,000,000 and give it to him, he would free her village and thus, Nami began her life as a thief. As a show of their power, the crew constructed their headquarters,
   Arlong Park
   , in clear sight. They struck an illicit deal with
   Captain Nezumi
   of the
   16th Branch
   in order to keep their activities a secret from the rest of the
   Marines
   and started mobilizing their forces to conquer all of the East Blue.

   During the present day, Arlong had already conquered over 20 villages but Nami was getting dangerously close to her goal, and Arlong was getting worried. If Nami left, he would lose a valuable part of the team, as her maps were essential for devising their strategies. Thus, he told Nezumi where Nami kept all of her money and had him confiscate all of it, but Nami and the other villagers instantly realized that Arlong was behind it and finally decided to fight back.
