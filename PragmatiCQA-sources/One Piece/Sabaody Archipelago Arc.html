   Camie uses her ability to be able to speak with fish and navigates the ship towards Grove 44 of the Sabaody Archipelago, having been told that Hatchan is being held at the base of the
    Flying Fish Riders
    , which lies on this route. Before they arrive, they are attacked by the Flying Fish Riders, who after a brief battle return to their base to report back to their leader,
    Duval

   After hearing that the ship has been identified as belonging to the Straw Hat Pirates, the mysterious man states his intention to kill "the man who destroyed my life". Meanwhile, the Straw Hats approach the base, attempting to figure out ways to defeat the flying fish, although Luffy really just wants to ride one. Camie is worried about Hatchan, although Pappag assures her that he will be safe.

   The Macro Fish-Men Pirates attempt to ask Duval why he made them retreat, and he replies by shooting harpoons at them whilst ranting about the man who ruined his life, striking fear into his own crew as well as the Fish-Men. Macro himself tries to apologize to Duval for the stupidity of his own crew, but Duval congratulates them for revealing the Straw Hats to him. Meanwhile Hatchan (former Arlong Pirate crew member, now Takoyaki salesman), who is tied up in front of Duval is both concerned about Camie and also afraid of hearing the Straw Hat name mentioned again.

As the Sunny nears the base, Camie is worried that her friend is in danger. Sanji goes lovestruck promising Camie that he will rescue her friend, but Camie mentions how many times she got caught by Macro crew (at least 30 times), making
    Usopp
    exaggerate about the number of times, she has been captured as well as being eaten up by sea kings.

  <p key="bd08c2a9-bd3c-44d6-8bb9-0fd343f8e199">
   As the Straw Hats enter the base, they notice it is too quiet and they find out that the base is not an island, but a small village built in the middle of the sea. Camie and Pappag call out to Hatchan, who after seeing the Jolly Roger of the Straw Hats, covers himself in his own ink to disguise himself in order to protect his friends. The Straw Hats know that they are walking into a trap, but Camie and Pappag freak out when
    Franky
    yells at them of how blind they are to the obvious. They find Hatchan in a cage in front them warning them about the trap.

  <p key="9b1cebab-58d6-4a25-9f9d-88d1f8bb58df">
   Meanwhile the Flying Fish Riders begin to bombard the ship, leaving Sanji to deflect all of the bombs being dropped. Luffy manages to pilot one of the fish, but the attack leader orders the entire crew to dive underwater including Luffy, which renders him helpless. Chopper and Brook try to save him only to realize that they cannot swim as well. This infuriates both Nami and Franky who rescue them while complaining about extra work that they caused. The Macro Pirates see an opportunity and try to capture Camie, only for them to find that Zoro freed Hatchan from his cage while they were not looking. Hatchan defeats them quickly by uppercutting them into the air.

  <p key="f9c6e7b9-6144-43d5-81f8-4de4198fb014">
   Hatchan reunites with Camie and Pappag, but they are attacked by a Flying Fish Rider, though they are quickly saved by Zoro. Hatchan thanks Zoro for rescuing him and tries to apologize for the events in the past. Usopp defends the ship by using a cannon to shoot down the flying fish, with Chopper praising his skill. As the Straw Hats find out that there are a multitude of flying fish riders in the sky, Brook becomes ashamed that he cannot lend a hand in his first fight as a Straw Hat pirate. He then unsheathes his blade and jumps high in the sky and uses his violin to unleash a musical sound wave that puts the riders as well as Chopper and Luffy to sleep.
  </p>
  <p key="6af951bd-3042-47fb-83b4-d7cb2a76f4b6">
   This move allows Brook to perform a quick attack on the sleeping riders while running on water, and it also allows Luffy to grab a flying fish only to find it and its rider are asleep which causes him to plummet into Duval's room, wherein Luffy sees his unmasked face - with an extremely shocked reaction. Meanwhile, Brook spots that Zoro's wounds after his battle against Kuma still have not healed, however he tells Brook that he's fine enough to take on the Flying Fish Riders.

   Hatchan complains to Zoro and Brook that they should still keep their guard up, but Camie and Pappag praise Hatchan. Hatchan turns his back and lowers his guard only to be attacked by another rider, but is saved by both Zoro and Brook. As the group of Riders attack the Sunny, they fall to a combination attack of Nami's
    Clima-Tact
    and Robin's clutch skills.

Camie and Pappag watch the battle, amazed by the strength of the Straw Hat crew. Usopp advises Franky that they must dock the ship because the riders have an advantage on open sea and Franky agrees with him, but tells him that they can't because the Flying Fish Riders aren't giving them enough time to steer the ship.

   Luffy appears running towards Zoro, Brook, Hatchan, Camie and Pappag, announcing that a giant iron masked man on a giant cow is approaching them, when they hear the bull's roar. They realize that it is the Duval's beloved bison,

    Duval's Tragedy
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="871a5209-16bb-4488-9dd6-efad16db5dbd">
   Duval shouts that he does not need the base anymore - his only wish is to kill the Straw Hats. He reveals that "that man" is none other than Sanji. The Straw Hat crew on the ship try to remember who he is, but Sanji draws a blank. Suddenly, Duval shoots his scorpion poisoned tipped harpoons at them and screams at him that it is something just recent - confusing Sanji even further.
  </p>
  <p key="3ed8ac50-9653-4d0c-9b87-9d51c79917e0">
   As Sanji tries to tell Duval that he does not know him, Luffy tells Zoro that he has seen his face and that the whole Straw hat crews knows this face well. As Luffy violently removes Duval's mask, it is shown to the whole crew and the riders that by a cruel twist of both fate and irony, Duval was born with a face that is a perfect replica of Sanji's wanted poster. Duval shouts that he wants his life back and that Marines and bounty hunters have been after him since the poster appeared, but Sanji, upon seeing the face, leaves the Sunny, swims to the base dock, and immediately kicks Duval in the face, claiming he does not care.
  </p>
  <p key="f9731326-7a71-4809-afc9-270099af627b">
   Sanji and Duval argue with each other about the wanted poster, while the Straw Hats on the ship are amazed that something like this could happen - Franky has one of his emotional moments whilst the straw hats on the dock are amazed at what they are seeing. Brook just laughs (prompting Sanji to yell "Oh I'm so kicking your ass later Brook"). Sanji argues to Duval that he could have changed his appearance all this time, making Duval and the riders sport a "why did not I think of that" face while Sanji remarks on their stupidity.
  </p>
  <p key="3ebf179f-eb44-4bbe-ab0a-f3bcad610433">
   Duval reveals his past to everyone: He was once a mafia boss on a remote island doing his usual job until powerful bounty hunters and Marines came after him and forced to wear his iron mask to protect himself. Sanji beats him up and says he has had enough of his accusations. Duval orders his riders to reveal a steel fishing net and trap Sanji in it, dragging him into the sea.
  </p>
  <p key="aa53c6f9-5aca-4ab0-a5b8-1dee725af62a">
   Luffy tries to rescue Sanji and Zoro also tries to go in Luffy's place - however, Hatchan says that he's faster underwater and he will go. Duval then states that the Flying Fish are the fastest creatures underwater and it is futile to try to chase them. Suddenly, Camie jumps into the sea to rescue Sanji, and Pappag remarks that Duval is wrong; he agrees that the fish are fast but that there is nothing faster in the oceans than a mermaid. Luffy is amazed at this revelation, and Pappag says that if she keeps her guard up, Camie is uncatchable.
  </p>
  <p key="2364e167-d535-4764-a741-80b4952603d0">
   Whilst they were distracted by this, the Flying Fish Riders reveal that they are carrying a very huge anchor from an extraordinary large ship and are planning to drop it on the Thousand Sunny. Usopp asks Franky if they could use the "paddle" or "Coup De Burst" to get them away. Franky states that there is not enough time but reveals that he has built in a secret weapon for times like this. Reaching the bow of the ship, Franky tells everyone to believe in Sunny. As the Riders drop the anchor, Sunny's figurehead spins like a propeller revealing the emergency evasion secret weapon "Chicken Voyage" to everyone and making the ship go into reverse.
  </p>
  <p key="2786ade3-d24c-4345-a017-bbb72cadceb4">
   The riders are baffled about the prospect of a reversible ship. Franky tells Usopp that there is a secret compartment inside the prowl and reveals a new feature of the sunny, much to the excitement of Luffy and Chopper. A cannon reveals itself from within Sunny's figurehead's mouth, and Franky tells Usopp to get as many riders as he can. Usopp locks on and fires, revealing the incredible destructive power of the "Gaon Cannon".
  </p>
  <p key="75a23c44-27f8-4def-9956-c88f2648c763">
   Luffy cries in his amazement, Zoro says it's too awesome, Usopp claims that it's a monster and Brook said that he was so amazed that his eyes fell out, even though he has no eyes. Franky mentions that it takes 3 barrels of cola for "Coup de Burst" and 2 Barrels of cola for "Gaon Cannon", warning them only to use it in emergencies.
  </p>
  <p key="aeb4c28c-dc09-4d49-8603-075e117873a5">
   Meanwhile, Camie manages to rescue Sanji and has trapped the Fish riders in their own steel net. As Camie reaches the surface, Nami asks if Sanji is alright and Camie says that he is safe but bleeding from his nose (due to his usual perverseness).
  </p>
  <p key="1d5de6d5-bbdc-4754-892c-0d55b5eccd94">
   Duval is now furious that Sanji is still alive, but Luffy remarks that his henchmen are now all gone. This further infuriates Duval and he unleashes the full rage of his bison Motobaro onto Luffy.
  </p>
  <p key="6e5cc410-4223-429d-b192-a1f0f8842f00">
   But, to everyone's surprise, Luffy, reminiscent of Shanks, somehow makes the bison drop his rider, trod a few feet away and then faint. The Straw Hats, including Luffy, are amazed and confused about how he did it, further angering Duval. However, at this point Sanji arrives back on the dock, and tells Luffy he will take care of the rest.
  </p>
  <p key="91d524f4-404b-47fa-aa25-6ce5ea83494f">
   Just as Duval is about to attack, Sanji performs the same face bashing techniques that he did on

   now while they have a takoyaki party with Hatchan cooking. Chopper, Brook, Sanji, Usopp, and especially Luffy are gorging themselves, enjoying it thoroughly. Hatchan tentatively asks Nami if she likes it, to which she replies that she has not forgiven him yet, but likes his takoyaki nonetheless.
  </p>
  <p key="002ea6f2-7340-43c3-95ac-6aa97dfcc30a">
   The entire crew enjoy the takoyaki (with even Sanji being amazed at the flavor), until the "eating trio" of Usopp, Luffy and Chopper can continue no longer (just as well as Hatchan collapses exhausted from trying to keep up with their servings). It is then that Duval, whose face has become handsome, finds them. He expresses his gratitude for the change (and gets into fits about his own beauty), then gives the crew his Den Den Mushi number, saying if they need anything to just call him up before he and his gang (now renamed the Rosy Life Riders) depart.

Zoro is the last to leave much to the shock of the others as they know of his lack of direction. But Zoro points out he just has to look at the numbers on the grove trees to remember where they are dock and to ask directions if his gets lost. The three agree to this though tell him not to trust himself while he remembers the number of the dock as "1". However a bubble had floated in the way at the time revealing the dock to actually be "41".

One of the doctors pleads with Charlos to let them pass so they can save the man, the hospital being right in front of them. Charlos however "helps" by kicking the stretcher over, asking which is more important: the lives of commoners or the respect for him. He then spots the nurse with them and instantly claims her to be his wife. Both the nurse, named Marie, and one of the doctors, who incidentally is her fiancee, object to this which Charlos responds by shooting the man with his pistol much to Marie's horror.

Charlos, at first thinking Zoro dodged, shrugs it off and buys it before he and his subordinates go on their way.

Zoro however is clueless to the whole situation while most of the supernovas, who were watching and commenting on everything, are impressed by his strength and murderous intent.

The three leave with Luffy and Pappag shouting out for Camie and drawing attention to themselves. Pappag cries, blaming himself for the mermaid kidnapping as it was when he went to go get ice cream for Camie when she was abducted. The starfish then goes on about how he shouldn't have brought her to the island in the first place, claiming it wasn't just kidnappers but the whole island is their enemy. In a shopping mall in Grove 30, Robin explains to Nami the history of the relationship between human, fish, and mermen. Two hundred years ago, the Fish-Men race was classified as just that, fish, and were persecuted by humans. Even with their superior strength, human numbers outweighed their own with kidnapping and slave trade being the most common of methods on the Fish-Men. Finally the World Government signed a treaty with Fish-Man Island and these methods were abolished though Sabaody Archipelago still continues this trade.

Peterman has just left the ground, having given them Camie while Rosward and Shalria soon arrive at the house.

That something being Luffy as the fish rider he was with could not land properly (that and he took Luffy's comment "Smash right in there" literally). Zoro is with the two as well having been picked up on the way to the house. The Straw Hats themselves were astounded by the sudden arrival of their two most powerful members, as was everyone else in the auction. Upon seeing Camie, Luffy rushes the stage despite the protest of Hachi, who is forced to use his remaining arms to try and restrain him.

Hachi tries to stop him, reminding Luffy about the promise not to harm them and citing the fact that he was a pirate and that he deserved it anyway. He apologizes further, stating he only wanted to make up for his past actions to Nami and help any way he can but only got in the way. Charlos hears enough and tries to shoot him again. Luffy, already angered, no longer restrains himself and, and not caring about the rules anymore, gets up and punches Charlos in the face.

Rosward is obviously not pleased, sending the place into yet another panic. The audience quickly clears out to avoid the world noble's wrath while the guards set upon the Straw Hats, and a fight ensues. While Rosward demands for an admiral and shoots at Luffy (to no avail) Zoro slices Camie's fish bowl in half, freeing her. More fish riders arrive, dropping off Brook, Robin and Usopp who accidentally falls on Rosward, knocking him out and sparking more of the guards' anger as they take it as an attack. Luffy tells the group that they would leave once Camie has rid herself of her collar, but Law informs him that the marines already have the place surrounded. Shalria suddenly makes her way to Camie's fish bowl, intending to kill the mermaid. However, before she can pull the trigger, she suddenly faints.

Rayleigh apologizes to Kid and Law for the blast from earlier, though comment they cannot be normal if they managed to survive it. Both brush it off, rather amazed to have run into the "Dark King" himself. Rayleigh replies that he is merely a simple coating-engineer now and warns not to use the former title as he would prefer to live a peaceful life. He then checks on Hachi and thanks the Straw Hats' for saving him before telling the group that they should leave.

Kid then comments that anyone who makes that claim in the Grand Line would be laughed at, though in the New World anyone without the nerve to say something like that would be as good as dead. He then concludes by telling Luffy and Law that they should all meet in the New World again someday. With that he and his crew bowl through the Marines and head out. Law decides to head back to the auction house as his bear,
    Bepo
    , defends him. The Straw Hats soon join the fray, spotting Duval and the Fish Riders. The Marines prepare to shoot him but Robin saves Duval before they can do so. The others clear a path for Franky and Rayleigh to get Camie, Hachi and Pappag out first before they follow. Nami covers their escape with a Thunderbolt Tempo.

   Law soon emerges from the house with a slave who was under the Roswards,
    Jean Bart
    , a former pirate captain who joins his crew as thanks for freeing him, though Law states that half of his thanks should go to Luffy. Meanwhile, Kid's crew manages to clear the house and destroys a bridge to keep the Marines at bay. However, just when it seems they will get away, Kid is suddenly hit. To their horror, the culprit blocking their escape is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Bartholomew Kuma.

   The Heart Pirates are still fighting off the remaining Marines at the auction house, tearing through them to escape. However, they come across the Kid Pirates, most of whom are already wounded due to Kuma. The Warlord of the Sea immediately identifies and attacks Law, but Law manages to dodge the attack. With the Marines starting to close in from behind, Kid and Law, despite their mutual dislike of the other, tell Kuma they are leaving and prepare to face him. In Grove 8, Peterman has been thrashed by the Straw Hats and the Rosy Life Riders for his earlier abduction of Camie. After giving back Camie's backpack, they depart promising to aid them till they leave the island. The Straw Hat then head back to Shakky's bar to treat Hachi's gun wound.

  <p key="686a8711-d336-4002-9423-9ce48bbebb96">
   As they do so, they talk with Rayleigh where he reveals his relation with Gold Roger, much to their surprise (Hachi apparently knew this too but did not tell them since they just needed a coating-engineer). Rayleigh also reveals how he met Hachi (the Fish-Man had saved Rayleigh's life when he was a kid, and they had remained friends till Hachi joined Arlong's crew then named the Sun Pirate Gang). Sanji then question how he still could be alive if Roger's crew were captured to which Rayleigh reveals that Roger actually turned himself in. The government just made it seem that way to show their strength to the public. Rayleigh goes on to tell the reason why was because four years before he was executed, Roger came down with a incurable disease. His crew however had came across Crocus at the entrance of the Grand Line and asked him to join him on his final journey to keep his disease in check.
  </p>
  <p key="53291025-04a3-4003-9251-ca2f97ce3fa8">
   Finally after three years they had managed to conquer the Grand Line. This surprises the Straw Hats, Brook especially, since Crocus did reveal to them he was a pirate doctor for a time. Rayleigh even tell them that the reason Crocus joined was to find a certain pirate crew which the Straw Hats figure must have been the Rumbar Pirates, bringing tears to Brook's eyes sockets. Rayleigh continues, telling that after they conquered the sea, Roger was dubbed the Pirate King. However the title was meaningless since he was about to die. But Roger enjoyed it anyway through parties and fighting as a way to coop with the future. Eventually Roger disbanded his crew who silently went their separate ways, fates unknown.
  </p>
  <p key="547db8a7-1280-49a4-9a55-7be20e903a20">
   One year later, Roger turned himself in to the Marines who decided to make a public execution of him to throw fear into pirates around the world. However Roger had other plans, his last words to Rayleigh being "I ain't gonna die, partner". Then on the fateful day of his execution, Roger made his famous speech to the world which in turned created the current age of piracy. Say the least the Straw Hats are astonished by the story. Rayleigh then tells the group about Buggy and Shanks apprenticeship aboard Roger's ship, the latter of which ran into Rayleigh ten years afterward who told Rayleigh about Luffy, claiming that had met a kid that said the same things as their captain did.

  <p key="4334021e-6319-4e1b-89a1-abd1806f630e">
   The story suddenly shifts to a harbor at Grove 27, where a pirate crew is about to set off. Before they can do so, they spot a ship on the horizon that suddenly fires a cannonball with a person actually standing on top it. The ball lands in the harbor amidst the pirates and the figure, revealed to be Kizaru, awaits orders from his Den Den Mushi.

  <p key="134e7f9d-ca10-4159-b528-5f199510a8bb">
   Back at Shakky, Rayleigh congratulates Luffy for making it this far into the Grand Line and offers to do the coating job for free much to the Straw Hats' pleasure. Robin then asks him about the Blank Century, telling Rayleigh about a note written by Roger in the Poneglyph in Skypiea. Rayleigh replies the Roger Pirates did indeed find out the whole history, though he advises her to continue looking for it on her own. Rayleigh says that maybe she could reach different conclusions than those that they reached. Still he offers to reveal it to her but Robin politely turns him down agreeing with his earlier advice. Rayleigh also revels that Roger could not decipher everything, like a genius as Clover. Roger just "could hear the voice of all things". Usopp then ask Robin if she would want to let an opportunity like this get away and start to question Rayleigh about One Piece. Luffy stops him however demanding that the mystery of the treasure remain hidden since countless pirates were risking their lives just to search for it. He then threatens to quit being a pirate if any of the crew asked Rayleigh about it stating "I DON'T WANT TO GO ON A BORING ADVENTURE LIKE THAT!!!"
  </p>
  <p key="221693f2-a53d-4542-8e51-e24498aa4a4c">
   Usopp apologizes for his actions before Rayleigh asks Luffy if he can really conquer the Grand Line. Luffy replies that he does not really intend to conquer it, only that the person with the most freedom in the ocean would be the Pirate King, which brings a smile to Rayleigh and Shakky's faces. Rayleigh then tells the crew he will have their ship coated in three days which until then the crew will have to avoid trouble. Thus the Straw Hats decide their best bet is to split up and draw attention away from the shop. Shakky gives each member a

   so they can find their way back to Rayleigh once the coating is finished who decides to move the Thousand Sunny to a safer location. With that they bid Hachi, Camie, Pappag, and Shakky farewell for the time being and head back into the groves. Luffy suggests to hide in the theme park though the others (save for Chopper and Brook) reject this idea.

   In Grove 27, pirates are trying their best to distance themselves from
    Kizaru
    . One pirate tries to shoot the admiral but the shot does not even seem to phase him. Kizaru then blurs in front of them trying to ask them where he can find someone named
    Sentomaru
    but the pirates run away in fear. Kizaru then attacks them with light coming from his foot which he kicks out outward. This not only hits the pirates, but also topples a mangrove in the process much to the disapproval of his troops. However Apoo, who is nearby, does not seem impressed by his power. In another part of the area a few of the marines have been turned into either old men or children, the culprit of such being Bonney who laughs at them as she stuffs her face. A few more marines encounter and surround Capone but he informs them they have already lost. Kizaru then come across Hawkins whose crew wish for him to run, he calmly tells them though that today is not his day to die. Back with the Straw Hats, as Usopp tries to convince Luffy not to go back to the amusement park, a figure stands before them prompting Luffy to ask who he is.

In both cases growing to normal size once outside of Capone to overrun the squad. In Grove 41 Urouge has an encounter with Kuma and is having difficulty fighting him. Meanwhile back in Grove 24, Hawkins's crew keep pleading for him to run as Kizaru approaches but the captain is more focused on his pack of tarot cards. Reading his chances of fighting Kizaru, running from him, defending himself, and probability of death after the encounter, the last of which reads zero percent.

   Hawkins then tell Kizaru that he has not seen the person he's looking for. Kizaru then replies he gets bored easily and that he cannot let a high bounty like Hawkins get away before using his
    ability
    to deliver a "speed of light" kick at him then firing off another shot from his fingers. However in Grove 27 and the harbor, two pirates suddenly double over from pain, getting hit from seemingly out of nowhere. It then revealed that Hawkins used his
    voodoo-like ability
    and transferred both of the attacks to dolls that grow on his right arm.

  <p key="3aadcfdc-b934-46fe-8954-fc6701f62d50">
   Urouge suddenly toppled by them, bruised badly and citing his bad luck at running into a Warlord of the Sea and, upon seeing Kizaru, an admiral as well. Hawkins informs him that the shadow of death is not upon him yet though he takes this news as a joke. X Drake suddenly appears and kicks Kuma aside. Kizaru instantly recognizes the pirate while X Drake comments he wasn't trying to run into an admiral. Urouge then recovers and increases in size becoming huge. Now ready for a counter attack while Apoo continues to look on from a roof enjoying what's occurring before him.

   Back in Grove 12, the Straw Hats encounter yet another Kuma who fires a beam at Luffy though he manages to dodge it (as well as be amazed by it along side Chopper). His crew then inform him of their encounter with Kuma on Thriller Bark before Franky fires a Coup de Vent on the Warlord of the Sea in retaliation for that attack, knocking him back. Realizing that Kuma is very strong, Luffy goes into Gear 2 while Sanji and Zoro prepare to attack as well though the latter realizes that this Kuma seems different from their previous encounter. Meanwhile in Grove 49, the axe-wielding shadowed figure from before commenting Kizaru is late and that if he does not hurry there will not be anything left.

   Back at Grove 12; Franky, Usopp and Brook just barely avoid a blast from the Kuma they are facing. As Kuma goes to fire again, Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro rush him and perform a combo attack, managing to knock him down. Luffy then questions on if the Kuma they are fighting is a fake to which Sanji and Zoro question as well due to this Kuma's attack style not fitting the one they faced before. The three then come to the conclusion that there's more then one Kuma running around.

  <p key="a4fc6f1a-0f5b-43cd-b87c-bf3daa01ad69">
   Meanwhile, Urouge is pounding away at the Kuma he's fighting but is shot in the shoulder in retaliation. X Drake notes that Doctor Vegapunk has even managed to integrate Kizaru's light based powers into the Pacifista cyborgs. Kuma then attacks X Drake who retaliates with his rare
    Ancient Zoan Devil Fruit
    and manages to injure Kuma though he get's injured in the process as well. Urouge takes note of the Kuma's injury too but is kicked from behind by Kizaru through three buildings. Seeing this, Hawkins transforms into a large voodoo doll like creature and attacks Kizaru but is easily repelled. Just when it seems Kizaru will finish him off, he's saved by Apoo who severs Kizaru's right arm before exploding him with a blast of sound.

   Meanwhile all the Straw Hats work together to bring down the Kuma clone; Zoro, who was still hurt from his wounds on Thriller Bark, struggles to stand up and Sanji tells Luffy to first bring down the clone before tending to Zoro's injuries, though the former notes that Zoro is still suffering from the aftermath of the events that occurred in Thriller Bark. Chopper uses Roseo Metel on Kuma, enraging him and causing him to try and blast Chopper only for Franky to nail him with his Strong Hammer. Kuma easily sends Franky flying, but Franky is saved by Robin, who uses her Spider Net to catch him. Brook tries to attack him from above only for Kuma to try and blast him, but he is saved by Usopp when he uses Atlas Suisei to distract Kuma.

   Suddenly it seems like Usopp's attack managed to injure it badly, Franky notes that the Kuma clone is like him; enhanced with weapons but still only human and that one of Usopp's explosive projectiles must have went inside his mouth and dealt severe internal damage. Kuma tries to blow them all away with a laser from his mouth only for his mouth to be clamped shut by Robin causing to shoot himself, Nami quickly strikes him with a Thunderlance Tempo. This however only causes Kuma to go berserk. Sanji uses Flambage Shot to knock him back, Zoro uses Asura and Makyuusen to damage Kuma before Luffy uses Gear third and Gigant Rifle to finish him off.

   After doing so, the Straw Hats are completely wiped, having had to use all their strength just to fight the Kuma. They soon start to discuss what to do next when someone calls out to them. Out from the sky drops the ax wielding figure, along with yet another Kuma cyborg, in the middle of the Straw Hats. The figure introduces himself as
    Sentomaru
    and the Kuma clone as a
    Pacifista
    , PX-1 (the one the Straw Hats defeated was PX-4).

  <p key="30a49019-b507-464d-9cda-d19c4d760632">
   PX-1 soon fires on the group forcing the Straw Hats to dodge. This prompts Luffy to decides they must now split up and run. Sanji sticks with Nami with Franky tagging along. Usopp goes with Zoro with Brook joining as well out of concern for Zoro's injuries. Leaving Luffy, Robin, and Chopper together. The three groups run in different direction promising to meet up in three days.

  <p key="1740007c-f317-41e5-800d-c5b9bbc38adc">
   Usopp tries to cover their escape with a smoke bomb. But the PX-1 blows up a bridge preventing Sanji's group from escaping before appearing right in front of them. Sentomaru goes for Luffy's group prompting Luffy to try to Gatling him. Sentomaru easily deflects the attack with his palms and sends him flying much to Luffy's shock. Sentomaru then hits him again and knocks Luffy into a tree, managing to actually hurt him as the marine reveals he not a devil fruit user. An explosion nearby halts the fight, which Luffy notices it came from where Zoro's group ran.

  <p key="fbd6a7c0-fd40-4b14-a58a-b51445ac652d">
   Indeed, his group ran into the worse possible scenario as Kizaru reveals himself before them. Zoro himself has taken the brunt of the admiral's attack and, compounded with his previous injuries, can no longer move while Brook and Usopp try desperately to keep Kizaru from killing Zoro.
  </p>
  <p key="f57e5ddf-6701-416a-a003-84e99b4f2a7e">
   However none of their attacks work since, as Kizaru reveals, he ate the Pika Pika no mi (Light Light) Fruit, a logia type that essentially makes him a light man. Kizaru then goes to finish Zoro off but the attack is suddenly thwarted by Rayleigh's intervention who manages to kick Kizaru's leg and divert the light attack. Kizaru greets the "Dark King" while Rayleigh tells him not to pluck the fine sprouts (i.e: the Straw Hats) since their era is just beginning.
  </p>
  <p key="73b364e6-126e-4fa6-bf1b-967df76b5c6c">
   Afterwards, Luffy orders for everyone to concentrate on running away, telling them they cannot fight. They all start to run, with Franky using a Coup de Vent to distance himself, Nami and Sanji from the Pacifista. Kizaru however, heads for Zoro's direction to attack him, but Rayleigh stops him in his tracks, even managing to cut his cheek. Afterwards, The Pacifista begins to attack Zoro, but is temporarily stopped by Sanji and Brook, both of whom are quickly defeated. Luffy is then attacked by Sentomaru and knocked into one of the mangrove trees. Rayleigh and Kizaru begin a sword fight, with Kizaru using a light sword. The Pacifista then attacks Usopp, causing him to drop Zoro. Chopper enters Monster Point to try to help. The Pacifista is stopped from it's attack by the real Bartholomew Kuma, who then asks if Zoro were to go on a trip, where would he like to go. Zoro then disappears right in front of Usopp's eyes.
  </p>
  <p key="b0ac3569-7a01-4a65-9a49-343e911a041e">
   The crew is completely shocked by Zoro's disappearance. Luffy demands to know what has happened to him to which Sentomaru unwittingly answers, telling him if a person touched by Kuma's paw they go flying for three days though where they end up is uncertain. Sanji and Usopp continue to question where Zoro is just as the PX-1 prepares to fire at them from behind. Kuma, however, warps to it and makes it disappear confusing both the Straw Hats' and Sentomaru. Luffy yells for the remaining Straw Hats' to run to which they oblige. Kuma however advances on the injured Straw Hats' (Sanji, Usopp and Brook) prompting Brook to try to defend the latter two. However he is vanished by Kuma.

  <p key="a2d95b61-8774-48c1-9e59-fe06367b63bb">
   Sanji quickly gathers himself and goes for an attack but is easily knocked aside leaving Usopp to himself. He tries to fire a star but vanishes before he can do so. Angered, Sanji rushes to Kuma again but is vanished as well.Luffy is quickly losing his morale after seeing four of crew disappear right before his eyes while Rayleigh continues to battle Kizaru.
  </p>
  <p key="d72bdd91-9246-42aa-a559-a0bb00cdec28">
   Kuma passes by them and whispers something to Rayleigh prompting him to question what he is doing. Kizaru inquires as well but Kuma brushes him off. Luffy then enters Gear 2, Kuma ignores him and goes for Franky and Nami. Franky launches a strong right striking Kuma directly in his face but showed no sign of harm to him. Luffy launches himself at Kuma in Gear 2 with a strong punch, but Kuma catches his fist easily and tosses him side.
  </p>
  <p key="37079f0a-8637-4fe6-9e65-14f01632f183">
   Luffy's efforts does not deter the Warlord of the Sea before he causes Franky to vanish. Nami is next to go as she is in the midst of calling Luffy for help.

   Now alone, Luffy loses any remaining will to fight and collapses to the ground in despair. Berating himself for not being able to save even one of his friends. Kuma then appears before Luffy, paw raised, he tells the captain they will not meet each other again before Luffy too disappears at his touch. A caption then comes up saying that on this day in Grove 12 of the Sabaody Archipelago, the Straw Hats were completely and utterly defeated.
