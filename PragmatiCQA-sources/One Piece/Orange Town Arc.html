Luffy spots a bird in the air and uses his Devil Fruit powers to try and catch it so that they can eat it. However, the bird turns out to be much larger than expected and flies off with Luffy in its mouth. Zoro rows after him, but comes across three pirates struggling in the ocean. They jump onto Zoro's boat as he passes them (since he cannot stop) and then try to steal the boat from Zoro, only to get beaten up for it. The pirates then apologize for their actions, recognizing Zoro as the famous pirate hunter, and they explain to him how their situation came about. They were returning from successfully plundering a ship when they came across a small boat drifting the ocean with a female passenger on board. She asked for some food and water and offered a treasure chest as payment. They decided to check the chest first, only to find it empty and that the girl had stolen their boat. A sudden maelstrom appeared and sunk the small boat along with the pirates, while the girl waved goodbye as she drove off with their boat.

   Back in the present, the pirates growl about getting revenge and worry about what their captain

    will do to them if they come back empty-handed, as Zoro wonders who Buggy is. Meanwhile, in a small village named

In the town, the same girl who had robbed the pirates is running away from three more angry pirates, who are yelling at her to return a map of the Grand Line she stole. An explosion halts the chase for a moment, and something crashes in the middle of the four. Luffy emerges from the smoke unharmed, wondering what shot at him. The girl suddenly gets an idea and calls Luffy "boss", asking him to take care of the pirates. The pirates crowd around Luffy, one of them striking his head and knocking off his straw hat. This angers Luffy, and he easily defeats all three. The girl, who was watching, is impressed by his abilities and introduces herself as

   Nami at first tries to form a partnership with Luffy, but when she finds out he is a pirate, she switches to the idea to pretending to turn Luffy in to Buggy as her former boss. She ties up Luffy and gives him to Buggy, who locks him in a cage. Later, Nami pretends to join Buggy's crew so she can steal his gold. This works well, until Buggy orders her to kill Luffy to prove her loyalty. Nami's conscience gets the best of her, and she is compelled to save Luffy instead. Fortunately, Zoro shows up in time to save them both. He fights Buggy, cutting him into pieces and marveling at how easily he was defeated. However, when Zoro turns around, he finds that Buggy's hand has managed to detach itself, stabbing him in his midsection. Buggy reveals he has eaten a

Chouchou defends it to the best of his ability, but is no match for the lion. When Luffy comes back to the area, he sees the pet shop burned to the ground and the dog heartbroken over it. Luffy then confronts Mohji and Richie, defeating both of them easily before taking the last box of dog food left from the store and giving it to Chouchou.

   Boodle, inspired by Luffy's courage, goes to confront Buggy, but is almost choked to death. Luckily, Luffy, Zoro and Nami arrive and save him, before knocking him out to make sure he doesn't get in the way. Zoro fights with

   Luffy finally takes on Buggy while Nami sneaks off to steal Buggy's treasure. During the fight, Buggy reveals that he is

As Buggy separates his body parts again, preparing for another attack on Luffy, Nami steals some of them, tying the stolen body parts together. Buggy is left with just his hands, feet and head, leaving him vulnerable as Luffy sends him flying. Nami gives Luffy the map of the

   As the trio starts to relax, the townspeople come back into the town, and, upon seeing their mayor knocked out, demand answers. Luffy replies that the three are pirates and he simply felt like knocking him out, and the townspeople chase them out of town, though the three manage to lose them thanks to Chouchou's intervention.

   Boodle wakes up and sets after them himself just as Luffy, Zoro, and Nami leave the island on two small boats, thanking the three from the dock as they sail off. To Nami's surprise, Luffy had deliberately left one of her treasure bags behind that was worth
    500,000 to help the people of Orange Town rebuild their homes. She warns Luffy never to do that again. With that, the three pirates sail off to continue their journey to the Grand Line.
