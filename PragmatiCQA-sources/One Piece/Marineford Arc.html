   As this goes on, all around the world, people voice their opinions on the execution and if Whitebeard will really show up. A few doubt his strength due to his old age and the number of the Marine forces. Others, who personally met Whitebeard and even retired from piracy just by being before him, think otherwise. Even children know of Whitebeard's raw strength and sing a playground song about him. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Marineford, a city where the families of Marines reside, have been evacuated due to the coming war. On the
    Sabaody Archipelago
    , monitors have been set up to broadcast the execution to its inhabitants as Ace arrives at the execution stand. The patrol ships sent to deal with Whitebeard's forces are sunk and never heard from again. Thus, Marineford is understandably on edge as the three hours until the execution count down.

    admirals
    :
    Kizaru
    ,
    Akainu
    , and
    Aokiji
    . With this, nearly every justice force imaginable is gathered waiting for Whitebeard to make his move. On the Tarai Current, Luffy and the Impel Down escapees have finally reached the gate to Marineford. Jinbe tries to think of a way to penetrate it while Buggy rallies his followers.

   Back at the execution stand,
    Sengoku
    tells
    Garp
    that he is going to tell the audience "everything", which Garp replies he can do as he wishes. Sengoku then takes the stage and orders the executioners to step back a moment before addressing the audience through a Den Den Mushi. He begins by stating there was something critical he needed to share about Ace before asking the Second Division Commander who his father was. Ace replies that Whitebeard is his father but Sengoku claims he is not. Sengoku then goes on to say that the Marines searched an island for the possibility that a certain man bore a child. Newborns, children yet to be born, and even the mothers but they did not find anything. However, there was a reason for it and that was Ace's mother.

    Portgas D. Rouge

   , the mother of Ace, who was from the South-Blue on an isle known as
    Baterilla
    , performed a feat that even the Marines did not think was possible. She had kept Ace in her womb for twenty full months, far past the point of Ace's natural childbirth. When Ace was eventually born, Rouge died, having used up all her strength. This had taken place exactly one year and three months after the death of Ace's true father. Sengoku then announces to the Marines and the world that Ace's father is none other than

  <p key="7f46b1be-ebed-4abf-bb1d-d16ced07be5e">
   Around the world, the audience is shocked to learn that Roger had a son and that his bloodline lives on to this day. Those on Marineford are rendered speechless, though those that know Luffy personally (Hancock, Koby, and Helmeppo) are surprised to find out that Luffy and Ace are not actually related. Garp meanwhile continues to think of the past, when he met with Roger in his cell before his execution. Roger explained that he was going to have a son but would not live long enough to see him and personally requested Garp to take care of him, knowing what will happen if either Rouge or Ace are found by the World Government. Garp seemed reluctant at first of the idea but Roger believed Garp will honor his final request.
  </p>
  <p key="d79005eb-106c-427d-83d8-75d1f2920d29">
   Shortly after Roger died, the Marines arrived on Baterilla going off reports that Roger acted unlike himself on the island. They begin to investigate all newborns, mothers and pregnant women even giving orders to kill any mothers who may seem suspicious to them. Through it all however Rouge managed to keep Ace in her womb and avoid their notice. Eventually the Marines left the island and Rouge, under the care of Garp, was able to bear Ace safely. However, she only had a moment to hold her son before she died from exhaustion. A few years afterward Garp had left Ace under the care of
    Curly Dadan
    , a friend of his and a caretaker of Luffy, which is how the two first met. Garp then goes back to his last meeting with Ace who mentioned both Luffy and he had the blood of world class criminals in their veins, which he meant Luffy having the revolutionary leader,
    Dragon
    's blood and Ace the Pirate King's. He also took Portgas as his surname out of his love for his mother for saving his life.
  </p>
  <p key="a81d27dd-cf63-402d-97b0-624a3a213588">
   In the present, Sengoku continues by mentioning that two years ago Ace took to the sea as the captain of the
    Spade Pirates
    . His strength and speed caused the World Government to realize that Roger's bloodline had not ended. However, Whitebeard had noticed it too, and recruits Ace before the World Government could reach him. Sengoku however notes that Whitebeard did so to make Ace into the next Pirate King. Ace heavily denies it but Sengoku rebuffs him, ending his speech by saying that if they left Ace that way, he would have surely stood above all other pirates which is why this execution is so important even if it meant going to war with Whitebeard.

  <p key="4e8d2659-ae54-4520-adb7-e824cf66c333">
   One of the marines suddenly reports that the Gate of Justice to Marineford has suddenly opened on its own and that they cannot contact the power room. On the other side of the gate, the escapees are befuddled that the gate is opening for them despite the Marines claiming they would not open it. Buggy's followers think he was the one who did it as he stands at the front of the ship with his arms outstretched, although he is just as confused as everyone else.
  </p>
  <p key="463cb944-d6d1-44c9-acb3-678edc41d851">
   Back in Marineford, the order is given to prepare for battle as Sengoku looks on surprised at the fleet of pirate ships approaching the base, all being lead by pirate captains that have achieved infamy in the New World and have come to support Ace, much to his surprise. The Marines, however, withhold from firing on them, trying to locate Whitebeard himself. And indeed he does show, but not from the front, rather from underwater having coated his ship to appear smack in the center of the bay of the island. The Moby Dick, as well as three other ships appear with 14 commanders on board, arrive from underwater, much to the Marines' surprise. Whitebeard climbs to the front of his ship as he greets Sengoku, no longer hooked to his medical equipment and ready for battle. He tells Ace to bear with it a little long while Ace calls out to his "father".
  </p>
  <p key="9933ea0f-6cfb-4d23-884b-3f3a85824deb">
   With the gate unlocked, Luffy's group sails into Marineford. Ivankov wonders if Dragon will come to help or not. Upon hearing this, Luffy reveals he and Ace are not related and reveals Ace is Gold Roger's son, much to the shock of everyone on board (this was also supposed to be a secret which Luffy mindlessly let slip). Back at Marineford, the Marines wait in anticipation for Whitebeard to make the first move. Suddenly, he hits the air, cracking it like a mirror before it causes explosions, shocking the Marines. Luffy's ship draws close, though he cannot see anything through the fog while Ace begins to think back to his starting days of piracy. Back then, he was a teenager and set off three years before Luffy, with both promising to meet each other again. Ace formed the Spade Pirates and his actions soon gained the notice of the Marines (much to Garp's anger) as well as Whitebeard himself.
  </p>
  <p key="9675f335-9d52-4fb1-a728-f98317fdd89a">
   Not long after, Ace met with

    Shanks
   </a>
   personally, thanking him for saving Luffy's life, which the red-haired pirate used as a cause for celebration. Ace soon met with Jinbe trying to gain audience with Whitebeard. But the fish-man refused, causing a fight between the two that lasted for five days, ending in a stalemate as neither could overcome the other. Whitebeard soon located the group, whom the Spade Pirates were no match for. Ace ordered his crew to run while he stayed behind and tried hold Whitebeard off.

   Whitebeard, impressed with his spirit and strength, offered him the choice to join his crew, though Ace refused the offer at first. He ended up being knocked unconscious and waking up on the Moby Dick, where he was greeted by
     Thatch
     , the 4th Division Commander. Thatch explains that Ace's crew tried to get him back but were once more defeated and brought on board Whitebeard's ship. Despite this, Ace was not treated as a prisoner but stubbornly refused to be part of the crew. Instead, he tried to assassinate Whitebeard numerous times (a total of a hundred according to the crew) all of which ended in failure. Eventually, Ace gave up and officially joined after Marco revealed that all the men aboard Whitebeard ship, who are hated around the world, see him as a father which likewise in kind he calls them his "sons".
  </p>
  <p key="f62dcb12-dbba-4786-b883-920f4abfba16">
   Soon, Ace was nominated as the 2nd Division Commander, during this time he met Blackbeard who suggested he take the job. Before he did, Ace revealed his past to Whitebeard who laughed it off despite the rivalry with Gol D. Roger, claiming everyone was a child of the sea. Then the incident with Blackbeard killing Thatch happened and Ace, in anger, swore to go after him.
  </p>
  <p key="98d59f9b-e41b-4898-a3b5-aa86fcc750d8">
   Whitebeard and the others tried to talk him out of it, the former getting an uneasy feeling about everything. But Ace persisted as Blackbeard was from his division (not to mention Thatch being a friend of his) and he wanted to take responsibility for Blackbeard's disgraceful actions. Back in the present, Ace pleas for the others to simply leave him behind claiming his own cockiness was the cause for his capture.
  </p>
  <p key="1d1c8841-8693-4a7a-8d27-575bacbda199">
   Whitebeard, however, claims he was the one who let him go hunt down Blackbeard. When Ace calls him a liar, the other Whitebeard pirates all agree with their captain and vow to save Ace no matter what. Suddenly, the base feels shaking around the island, which Garp explains that the earlier explosion Whitebeard caused has turned into tsunamis that are headed right back at Marineford. This is due to Whitebeard's devil fruit, the
    Gura Gura no Mi
    , which allows him to make earthquakes. Sengoku warns the Marines that military force alone will not be enough to stop Whitebeard as he has the power to destroy the world itself. As the tidal wave closes in on the base and the world watches on, it is revealed that 47 pirate ships led by Whitebeard face off against the Marine Headquarters and the Warlords of the Sea. Regardless of who wins, the current era of piracy is coming to an end.

   The tsunamis are soon right above the heads of the Marines as they begin to panic (though Doflamingo is more excited then scared). Aokiji suddenly vanishes from his seat and uses

   to freeze the waves before they crash down on the base. He then goes to attack Whitebeard, but the pirate captain easily stops the attack with an airquake, hitting the admiral in the process and shattering him. Aokiji reforms himself at the edge of the bay and uses his powers to freeze it as well. With the bay now frozen, Whitebeard's ships cannot move and the Marines begin to bombard them with cannon fire. The pirate captains respond in kind by charging out onto the now frozen bay to do battle. The vice admirals quickly meet them and the fighting quickly reaches chaotic levels.
  </p>
  <p key="e4dc0aeb-3e34-4932-8ae2-9fd390aed26b">
   Mihawk meanwhile makes the first move of the Warlords of the Sea, claiming he wants to see the difference in strength between himself and Whitebeard before unsheathing his sword and letting out a tremendous slash that heads straight for the Moby Dick. However, before it can hit it,
    Jozu
    , the third division captain of the Whitebeard Pirates who lives up to his title by covering himself in
    diamond
    , intercepts it. Kizaru suddenly make his move, appearing in the air and firing down an array of
    light beams
    at Whitebeard. But this was also intercepted, this time by first division commander Marco, who is covered in blue flames after the attack. Marco states that Whitebeard cannot be taken on the first turn, prompting Kizaru to remark on how scary the Whitebeard Pirates are.
  </p>
  <p key="03b9014f-185c-464e-a184-fb74f4ee10ec">
   It turns out Marco has eaten a "rare, mythical, Zoan devil fruit" which grants him the
    ability to turn into a phoenix
    . He and Kizaru wage in a short battle in the skies and Kizaru is knocked onto the ground, but immediately recovers. Kizaru then orders the "giant squad" (a squad of giant Marines) to be careful in their attack. However, Jozu counteracts this by hurling a huge iceberg at the Marines. As the Marines start to panic, the last admiral, Akainu, calmly states in his chair that, nobody will be able to protect Marineford if everyone is out to fight. Thus, Akainu produces a colossal
    magma fist
    that obliterates the iceberg, also creating volcanic projectiles and destroying one of Whitebeard's ships in the process. Whitebeard patronizes him, saying: "Go and light the candles on a birthday cake instead, you magma brat!". Akainu replies that he was just lighting up Whitebeard's funeral. The pirates continue their assault on the Marines. However, "
    Little Oars Jr.
    ", the descendant of "The Land-Pulling
    Oars
    ", charges in. The Marines start to panic, on account of Little Oars Jr.'s enormous size. Moria becomes excited at the thought of claiming Little Oars Jr.'s corpse, and Doflamingo sticks out his tongue, commenting on how the battle was getting interesting.

  <p key="1070ef5d-2154-42b1-a270-deea7b696989">
   Little Oars Jr. quickly begins to fight his way to the plaza where Ace is being held, destroying one of the marine battleships in the process and giving a path to his fellow pirates. The Marines soon are forced to fall back to strengthen their defenses. Whitebeard however disapproves of Little Oars Jr. recklessly charging in like he is doing but Little Oars Jr. begs him to let him do as he pleases to save Ace. Whitebeard complies and orders his men to back him up as Little Oars Jr. continues to get closer to the execution stand. Meanwhile, Hancock attacks a group of pirates with her
    Mero Mero
    powers. Managing to turn the body parts she hits to stone and break them off in the process with her amazing agility. However she not only attacks pirates but Marines as well. When asked by a bewildered Marine, Hancock states she agreed to join the battle but never allying herself with the Marines.

    Nikyu Nikyu
    powers, creating a tremendous explosion that wounds Little Oars Jr. greatly. Ace looks on in horror begging him to stop as he knows with Little Oars Jr. size making him an easy target, he would never make it. As Little Oars Jr. reels from the damage, he remembers when Ace made him a conical straw hat to help keep his head shaded since he knows Little Oars Jr. is closer to the sun due to being a giant, the hat also keeping his head dry during rain and snowy weather. Oars is more than grateful for the gift, which is why he determined to save Ace.

  <p key="d449cdde-3549-4b24-b1d0-e5f5e77ec4a9">
   However, he gets hit hard by cannon fire and begins to double over. As he does, Little Oars Jr. notices Doflamingo and tries to take him out, slamming at him with his fist. Doflamingo however manages to avoid the attack, flips over Oars and uses his
    ability
    to cut off his right leg in the process laughing all the while. Despite this, Little Oars Jr. desperately continues to advance towards Ace. Just as he is within inches of grabbing Ace, Moria sends his
    shadows
    at the giant, forming them into a spear and skewering him through the midsection. The Whitebeard Pirates look on in horror as Little Oars Jr. falls while the Warlords of the Sea give off different reactions with Moria obviously being happy about his victory.

   Doflamingo continues to find the whole thing hilarious which catches the attention of one of the division commanders. Whitebeard himself meanwhile looks on grimly at what just occurred prompting one of the Giant Squad vice admirals,
    Ronse
    , to take advantage of his distraction and attack him. Whitebeard however easily one-handedly subdues him with his earthquake power, much to the shock of the Marines, marveling that not even a giant can best the Emperor. Whitebeard then orders his troops to take advantage of the path Little Oars Jr. gave them and charge into the plaza, which the pirates quickly comply to.

Akainu attacks the Marine soldier as punishment for his cowardice. He then gets a report that the preparations are complete.

   Having also received the order, Koby starts to panic but before he can elaborate further, the two notice something coming in from the sky. Ace and the Marines see it too. As the object plummets closer to ground, it is revealed that its none other then Luffy and the prison escapees literally dropping in upside down from the sky. Luffy exclaims that he is not worried since he is made of rubber, but the others yell at him to do something before they make impact with the ice beneath them.

   As Luffy climbs higher on top of the wrecked battleship, he and Ace spot each other. Ace calls out to Luffy, who happily responds that he got to see him again.

Sengoku becomes even more infuriated at Garp and his accursed family, while Garp remains in shock that Luffy had made his way to Marineford.

   Jinbe declares to Sengoku that he has resigned his position of Warlord of the Sea. As Ivankov looks around, he notices that Crocodile has vanished; having made the first move, Crocodile appears behind Whitebeard, ready to impale him with his golden hook. Before he can, though, Luffy activates Gear Second and intercepts the blow. Crocodile reminds Luffy that they had a deal, to which Luffy responds that because Whitebeard is important to Ace, he would not let Crocodile touch him. Marco remarks to himself that Ace's brother is not half bad.

   As Whitebeard observes Luffy, he recognizes the Straw Hat as the one that Shanks used to wear. When he tells Luffy that he had seen the hat with "Red Hair", Luffy says that Shanks had let him borrow it. Whitebeard remembers the story that Shanks had told about why his arm had gone missing, that he had placed it on "a bet on the
    New Age

When asking if Luffy would rescue his brother, even knowing the odds that he is against, Luffy not only emphatically responds that he will, but also that he, not Whitebeard, would be the Pirate King, shocking all of the pirates and many Marines. Admiring Luffy's tenacity, Whitebeard merely tells Luffy to stay out of his way, who states that he is going to rescue Ace on his own. Kizaru asks Sengoku if he can kill the intruders, which Sengoku allows.

   Before charging into the battle, Luffy informs Whitebeard that he heard the Marines' plan to execute Ace ahead of schedule. Whitebeard realizes that the information is important, but Sengoku purposely allowed it to leak so that the pirates panic and fall into his trap. As Marco joins Whitebeard's side, Luffy bolts towards Ace; however, Kizaru attempts to stop him by launching a kick of light at him. The attack is stopped, though, by Ivankov's Death Wink, causing the two forces to collide in a massive explosion. When Luffy thanks him, Ivankov states that it is his duty to make sure Luffy does not go and kill himself. Buggy and the inmates meanwhile, watch on in horror, unwilling to join such a terrifying battle yet making out as if Buggy is rallying them on.

   Kuma fires one of his beams from his mouth, hoping to incinerate Luffy and Ivankov; the two dodge the blow, though, as Ivankov grabs onto Luffy and rolls out of the way. Ivankov shows shock that Kuma would attack him, remembering that the two used to be friends. As Luffy continues his assault,
    Hina

   Ace suddenly cries out to Luffy to stay away, berating his brother for getting involved with his own affairs. He states that he would be too humiliated if a weakling like Luffy were to rescue him, but his true reason for wanting to keep Luffy at bay was so that he would not drag his brother down with him. Luffy replies by shouting out that they are brothers, and that he does not care about any rules about pirates. As Moria sends his zombies after Luffy, they are drowned and purified in a burst of seawater fired by Jinbe.

While Moria, Buggy, and Galdino seem shocked at the news, Mihawk says that at that point that fact was hardly surprising, Hancock feels that she loves him even if his father was the devil, Kuma continues to remain expressionless, and Jinbe and Doflamingo realize that Luffy's actions finally make sense. Smoker is now able to understand why the revolutionary saved Luffy in Loguetown.

   Not even fazed by the fact that his lineage was revealed to everyone at Marineford (as well as the whole world, due to the reporters watching on), Luffy smashes his way through more of the Marines with Gear Third, claiming that he does not care if Ace objected, and that he would rescue Ace even if it killed him. Whitebeard, in even more awe than before, tells Marco that he will not forgive him if he lets Luffy die.

   Having seen the determination shown by both Whitebeard, his subordinate crews and Luffy, Ace finally states that he cares not what fate has in store for him, whether he is to be saved or killed. As Luffy, Ivankov, and Jinbe break through the Marine forces, Whitebeard recognizes Buggy and asks if he wants to take his head. Whitebeard proposes that the two instead team up temporarily to fight the Marines before Buggy takes his head, which Buggy agrees to. When Marco asks why Whitebeard would deal with someone as meaningless as Buggy, Whitebeard reasons that it would be troublesome if they would have to fight the inmates alongside the Marines.

When Smoker asks why Hancock is not fulfilling her duty as a Warlord, Hancock states that she has never felt as angry as she had in her life, and that she would not let anyone harm her beloved Luffy.

Luffy, contemplating on how helpful Hancock is, happens to make his way to where Ivankov and Kuma are battling.

Luffy asks Ivankov if he and Kuma know each other, which Ivankov confirms, while stating that something is wrong with Kuma.

   Doflamingo once more speaks on Kuma's behalf, saying that while the two seemed to know Kuma, the man standing before them was not Kuma, as Vegapunk had finished his modifications on the former Bartholomew Kuma. Doflamingo then explains to Ivankov the process Kuma volunteered to undergo, as his body was converted into a "Pacifista", with bits and pieces of him being modified at a time. Ivankov says that Doflamingo is lying as Kuma hated the World Government and would never work with them. While Doflamingo admits that he does not know what kind of deal Kuma and the World Government made, he goes on to say that but a few days ago he had retained his personality, but now he was a walking corpse with no human memory, following the World Government's every command: PX-0.

After sending Luffy careening into a wall, Mihawk pursues after him, attempting to impale him. However, two Newkama soldiers get in the way of Mihawk, who brushes them aside with little effort. Luffy attempts to attack Mihawk again, but realizing that the Warlord of the Sea would slice his arm off, halts his attack at the last moment, instead, choosing to run away. Mihawk comments that Luffy was unusually composed as he slices horizontally at the rubber man. Although Luffy dodges it, the attack slices the remaining frozen wave in two, causing the upper half to come crashing down on Marineford.

   Across the battlefield, Crocodile turns down Doflamingo's offer, saying that Doflamingo is not at his level, and that instead Doflamingo could be his underling. Doflamingo laughs at how he thought Crocodile would be rational, the latter stating that if he was, he would not have come to Marineford in the first place. He then performs Sables, attempting to blow Doflamingo away. The attack is not confined to Doflamingo, though, as Buggy is accidentally sucked into the vortex as well.

   Both pirates and civilians look on in horror as the Pacifista arrive, as the only knowledge the pirates had was rumors that Vegapunk had been using human corpses to develop a human weapon. However, they are mystified as to why they are all Kuma. Sentomaru tells Kizaru that things were not going according to plan, as the pirates were meant to be all driven into the bay, instead of being scattered as they were. As the pirates hear on, they realize that Whitebeard knew that the Marines were to pin them all into the bay, and that by telling them to split apart, he had saved their lives. Sengoku demands that they continue with the plan, attacking any stragglers that they could reach. Sentomaru asks Kizaru if it is okay if the Pacifista destroy some of the Marine's battleships as well, to which Kizaru simply replies that they should not destroy too many.

   As Sentomaru commands the Pacifista to begin, a pirate tries to smash one with an enormous club; however, the club shatters on impact against the Pacifista, who retaliates by firing a laser beam from its mouth. The Pacifista all join together in their assault, firing lasers from their mouths and hands. Whitebeard, disgusted at the Marines' willingness to sacrifice their own ships, commands his men to ignore the attacks from the rear and continue onwards to the execution platform.

   Sengoku in return tells the Marines to draw back from the ice and to keep the pirates away from the platform. The onlookers at Sabaody are awestruck by how invincible the Pacifista are; however, before they can see much more, all but one video feed are cut. Sengoku commands that as soon as Ace is executed, the pirates must be wiped out at once. Luffy, rushing to get to Ace before he is executed, is stopped by Kizaru, who sends him flying with a kick of light; however, Luffy is stopped by Jinbe, who encourages Luffy by saying that they knew their enemies would be strong from the start. Giving Luffy a moment of reprieve, a group of Whitebeard's squad captains rushes forward to stop Kizaru, who carelessly states that the situation is terrifying.

Curiel responds by firing his guns at Moria, stating that he will not let Whitebeard or Ace die. Mihawk and Vista continue their duel; while Mihawk says that their duel must come to an end, Vista states that they each have a point in their favor.

Squard says that all of them owe him a great debt, and that they'll give their lives for the Whitebeard crew. Marco, having just noticed that someone was on the ship with Whitebeard, casually turns to face him. Squard suddenly impales Whitebeard through the chest with his blade, horrifying Ace, Luffy, Jinbe, Ivankov, Buggy, all of the division commanders, and all the onlookers at the Sabaody Archipelago.

   Enraged, Marco pins Squard down, asking how he could do such a thing. Squard knocks him aside, saying that it was their fault it happened. As Whitebeard's other subordinate crews continue to take attacks from the Pacifista, Squard claims that he knew about Whitebeard's "deal with the Marines". He also berates Whitebeard for not telling him that Ace was the son of Gold Roger, whom he deeply loathed for the massacre of his crew by Roger's hand. He also claims that Whitebeard sold out his subordinate crews, as his deal with Sengoku was that he, his crew, and Ace would be allowed to be set free, as long as all of the other pirate captains died. He supports his claim by pointing out how the Pacifista are only targeting the New World captains. He then states that although he was lucky to manage to get an attack in on Whitebeard, he was ready for his death as punishment.

   Whitebeard looks down on a terrified Squard, angrily asking how he could raise his sword against his father. However, instead of harming him, Whitebeard instead hugs his "son", saying that even if he is a fool, he still loves him. When Whitebeard asks who it was who had talked Squard into turning against the him, Squard reveals that it was Akainu, who had stated that he was opposed to the plan to spare Whitebeard, and that Squard should kill him while he had the chance.

   To dispel the wavering doubt beginning to grow within the other captains, Whitebeard shatters the frozen waves with his
    Devil Fruit powers
    , giving his subordinate crews a route to escape if they so choose. Whitebeard claims that those who call themselves pirates should choose for themselves what to believe. Witnessing the act of selflessness, the other captains' faith in Whitebeard is instantly renewed. Whitebeard considers to himself that, although people may call him weak, a demon, or a monster, he is only one man with one heart, and as he cannot be the "strongest" forever, he should be allowed to raise one young life for the future.
He then shouts out that those who would follow him should be ready to lose their lives, as he lunges towards the execution platform and into the battlefield. Sengoku shouts for the Marines to be ready, as the "Strongest Man in the World" is about to attack. As Whitebeard charges into battle, all of his crew and subordinate crews follow behind and open a path for him.

   As onlookers wonder why the quakes are not effecting the execution platform, they see that the three admirals are somehow holding it together, as the three banter about how it is each other's fault that the wall is not up yet.

Cannons emerge from the walls, preparing to fire. However, one wall near the front remains open;

Ace, seeing that Akainu means to attack the defenseless Luffy, suddenly leaps in the way and takes the blow. Akainu's molten blow pierces Ace's entire torso. Luffy and Whitebeard's pirates look on in horror while Ace's Vivre Card burns to a scrap of paper.

   Upon seeing the fatal blow Akainu inflicted upon Ace, every pirate rushes to attack the admiral and stop him before he can finish off Ace or Luffy. However, Akainu's Logia intangibility keeps him from being injured in the bombardment, and, noticing that Ace still has some life in him, he moves in to attack him again. Jinbe cries that he will tolerate no more of this and rushes in to take the blow with his right arm. Akainu scolds him on his actions, commenting that as a former Warlord Jinbe would know about the power he wields. The fish-man retorts that he would gladly pay with his life to delay him, since he fully intended to die anyway. Meanwhile, Mr. 3 is dragged over to Marco, who orders him to remove the Seastone handcuff. Sengoku and some of the other Marines realize that Garp is acting strangely; Sengoku slams him into the ground, demanding to know his intentions. As they struggle, Garp warns the fleet admiral that he had better keep him held tightly down or otherwise be sure that he will murder Akainu himself.

   Akainu attempts to attack Jinbe again but is interrupted by Vista and Marco, who shout at Jinbe to get down as they simultaneously attack Akainu. The admiral is irritated by the attacks, as both Vista and Marco are Haki users. Meanwhile, Luffy catches the gravely wounded Ace as he falls, and, horrified by the sight of his hand slicked with his brother's blood, begs him to hold on. Ace apologizes to Luffy for not letting him save him properly. The doctor of the Whitebeard Pirates rushes over, but Ace, knowing full well that his internal organs were badly burned from Akainu's attack, tells them it is too late - he can perceive his own life's end.

His only regret is that he will never get to see Luffy's dream come true, though it undoubtedly will. He comments that he has no regrets about the path he chose in life; all he really wanted was to know was the answer to one question: whether or not he should have been born.

   Before Akainu can pursue Luffy to finish him off as well, Whitebeard, enraged at the death of Ace, appears behind him and punches Akainu to the ground, greatly wounding him. Akainu retaliates, burning off a portion of Whitebeard's head with Meigo. Unfazed, Whitebeard slams Akainu aside, injuring him further and in the process causing an earthquake that demolishes Marine Headquarters base and splits the plaza in half. This act separates the Marines and the pirates, isolating Whitebeard with the Marines. Sengoku is astonished that Whitebeard still has so much power despite his injuries while Whitebeard states that he is not finished yet.

Blackbeard laughs, commenting that he was glad he made it in time to see Whitebeard die.
