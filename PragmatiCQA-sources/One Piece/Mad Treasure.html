    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="fc52ee69-d2ee-4856-bd64-a1b6b35ec9cf">
   Mad Treasure had a reputation for being a thrill-seeking hunter of lost and valuable riches; driven by a ruthless desire for treasure mainly for the pursuit of it and with no intent of hoarding any. His single-minded drive for fortune is the only thing that Treasure values in life, and he gets more excited the more challenging obstacles become in his quest to obtain it. Once he had located the Pure Gold, he did not care about being dissolved in
   Bonbori
   's stomach acid as he wanted to savor the moment of acquiring it. He also had a selfish desire to steal the Pure Gold for himself as an exception to become immortal and live forever hunting treasure.
  </p>
  <p key="476bb92d-adfd-4e89-b73c-b6ae420ce3c8">
   Treasure's desire for plundering makes him view friends and people alike as mere tools whose only purpose is to assist him in his quest when needed. Treasure will capture anyone he finds that he views useful enough, and puts them in positions of servitude with no care for their well-being. He even goes far as to believe having both dreams and friends is too "greedy" to go together; prioritizing his treasure-hunting dream over his crew at any cost.

   Treasure was hired by
   Gild Tesoro
   to find the valuable treasure known as
   Pure Gold
   , and he tracked down
   Myskina Olga
   , the only person with knowledge of its whereabouts. Treasure and his crew attacked the Marine convoy carrying Olga by surprise, dispatching all the Marines that got in their way. Treasure went belowdeck to confront the
   CP0
   agent and Marines who were guarding Olga. Treasure clashed with the CP0 agent, and eventually managed to overpower him as he returned above deck and captured Olga. However, Olga managed to escape on her steed
   Elizabeth
   , and Treasure decided to continue the pursuit.

  <p key="a3de58c0-a869-4a76-8172-b26e160e47dc">
   Treasure later confronted the
   Straw Hat Pirates
   , who were harboring Olga on the
   Thousand Sunny
   . While his men unsuccessfully attacked, Treasure pulled Olga back to his ship, but was unsuccessful as

   freed Olga and caused her ring to slip off her finger. A giant fish named
   Bonbori
   then arrived to eat the ring, and Treasure decided to sail into its mouth along with the Straw Hats. Treasure rammed the Shark Emeralda into the Thousand Sunny, which led to

   becoming separated from his crew. The Shark Emeralda and Thousand Sunny then fell into Bonbori's throat, which excited Treasure. The fall rendered Straw Hats
   Nami
   ,
   Nico Robin
   ,
   Tony Tony Chopper
   ,
   Brook
   , and
   Usopp
   helpless, and Treasure captured them.

  <p key="b08161d0-b153-4466-82b7-04edea16181a">
   Treasure later confronted Luffy and Olga inside Bonbori's first stomach, and after a brief clash he showed Luffy his captured crewmates. This allowed Treasure to bind Luffy and recapture Olga, and he left Luffy to be dissolved by the tide of stomach acid as he, his crew, and his prisoners departed. As the Shark Emeralda was sailing for
   Alchemi
   , Treasure came to the bottom deck and forced the Straw Hats to work, and he recognized Nami.

  <p key="8c53ed79-f927-4582-84ab-5cb30a0a92a0">
   Treasure's group later arrived at Alchemi, and prepared to enter a temple where the Pure Gold was located. However, the temple was full of traps, and Treasure used the Straw Hats to pass them. After the first test,
   Psycho P
   returned from his mission to report that Luffy was still alive, to Treasure's shock. Treasure stationed Psycho P and
   Naomi Drunk
   outside, and his group came to the Final Gate. Treasure laughed as the Straw Hats were unsuccessful at opening it, but the gate was suddenly destroyed by Luffy. Treasure battled Luffy, but Luffy's companion
   Myskina Acier
   suddenly intervened as he opened a trapdoor underneath the Straw Hats and Olga. Treasure confronted Acier, who activated a sequence for the temple to self-destruct in order to bring down Treasure with him.
  </p>
  <p key="26d0b828-cd6f-480e-a6bc-74e3624a9f9e">
   However, Treasure captured Acier and leaped outside, right where the Pure Gold lay. Treasure picked up the Pure Gold and became ecstatic about finding it, but Luffy suddenly interrupted him. The two fought once more as Treasure struggled to comprehend Luffy's valuing of friends over treasure. After exchanging blows, Treasure wrapped his entire body in chains, but Luffy eventually managed to break through the chains and send Treasure flying into the wall of Bonbori's stomach. This caused the Pure Gold to fall off Treasure, and he waded through Bonbori's stomach acid to look for it despite the pleas of his crew. Treasure survived the acid, but was unable to find the Pure Gold. Now left stranded in the belly of the beast, he resigned to his fate and later ate meat on the shore of Alchemi with Naomi and Psycho P.
