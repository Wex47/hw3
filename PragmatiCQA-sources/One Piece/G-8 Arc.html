   Usopp steals some clothes and disguises himself as a marine rookie. He finds the Going Merry but is stalled by a shipwright named
    Mekao
    , who chats with Usopp about how the Going Merry needs serious repairs or it will be unable to sail. Suddenly,
    Lieutenant Drake
    appears, one of Jonathan's subordinates. He tricks Usopp into admitting he's a pirate. Usopp tries to lie his way out of the predicament several times, but ends up blundering each attempt.

    Kobato
    who cannot stand the sight of blood. Unfortunately, a ship full of injured Marines has docked at G-8 and she has to operate on them. Seeing her dilemma, Chopper disguises himself and helps her. Nami, who is now disguised as a nurse, reunites with Chopper and also assists Kobato.

   Because of Sanji's foolishness, he and Luffy are still working in the kitchen.

   The real Agent Shepherd is found unconscious in the hallway and assumed to be a Straw Hat. When he's dragged down to the dungeons and thrown in jail with Usopp and Zoro, Usopp lies and says that Shepard is their crewmate, "Condoriano". Shepard continues to claim he's really a Naval officer, so Zoro KOs him with his forehead.

   Luffy and Sanji at this point have learned Zoro is in jail and go to free him. However, Jonathan has predicted this and has Lieutenant Drake set up an ambush. When the two arrive, they are surrounded, and Luffy cannot break the jail's bars because they are made of

   At this point, everyone except Robin is heading toward Dock 88, the Going Merry's location.

They are vastly outnumbered, and things get worse when Luffy is trapped into a net made of

   . Luckily, Chopper and Nami arrive at that moment with Dr. Kobato, and use her as a hostage to get on board the Going Merry. Makao sees this all play out and decides to release the Going Merry into the water. It turns out that Makao is Kobato's father. One of Drake's men grabs Kobato but since Nami is dressed like a nurse, the marines think Luffy and crew still have a hostage, and let them go.

   Robin shows up with a map of the base and the Straw Hats hide Going Merry in an abandoned dock, since there are so many. Usopp uses junk in the dock to disguise Merry as a Naval ship, and then splits the crew into two teams: one team to recover the treasure gained at

   Jonathan tricks the crew into another ambush, this one in a huge room that is locked from the outside. Drake is once again leading the attack, with countless marines backing him up, and things look bleak until Agent Shepherd foolishly opens the doors and allows Luffy, Robin, Zoro, and Usopp to escape.

   Nami and Sanji get the Waver and go back to Merry; Nami orders Sanji and Chopper to bring the ship out into the waters and wait for the others to return. She goes looking for Luffy and finds him, only to discover that they still do not have the gold. Nami suspects that it's in the Commander's office, so she and Luffy go alone while everyone else goes back to the boat. Using the Waver, she and Luffy scale the main mountain and break into Jonathan's office. Marines fill the room but Nami uses her Thunder Tempo attack to electrocute them all. She and Luffy grab the treasure and head back to the boat.

   However, Jonathan is not worried, because at 9 PM the "fangs of G-8" will appear. What he means is the inner lake becomes so shallow that the Going Merry is stranded on a reef. With no water, the Merry is stuck in the mud while the marines mobilize.

   Usopp produces an Impact Dial and Luffy produces the same octopus that the Straw Hats used to exit Skypiea in the first place. Along with a Breath Dial and a Flame Dial, they manage to blast the Going Merry into the sky and use the octopus as a balloon once more, sailing over the cliffs of G-8 and escaping, once and for all.
    While Commander Jonathan is disappointed, he explains to his wife that the pirates brought G-8 and its inhabitants together, and gave them some much needed exercise.
