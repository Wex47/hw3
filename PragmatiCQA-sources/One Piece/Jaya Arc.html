    starts to point straight up and Robin explains that the log is "captured" by an island with a stronger magnetic field—a
    Sky Island
    .
    While exploring the sinking ruins of the ship, they come across an old map of a land named Skypiea. Through a skull and some books, they figure out that the ship is the Saint Briss, which left the Kingdom of Breeze in South Blue 208 years ago. This appalls the crew and they continue salvaging.

   When they try to salvage the sinking ship for more information, they come across a group of pirates led by
    Masira
    , who claims that he has control over the territory and all ships that sank there belong to him. Masira and his crew begin the salvage operation and are in the process of raising the ship when they run into a snag. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji, who were underwater searching the wreck, start beating up Masira's crew. Masira goes down to handle things and confront them when a Giant Sea Turtle comes along and swallows the ship, though Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Masira all escape. However, out of nowhere, the sky turns dark and three humongous shadows appear. Out of fear, the pirates run away as quickly as possible. Luckily, Robin manages to take an eternal pose to the nearby island of

   To his last breath, Noland claimed that he was telling the truth, and proclaimed that the City of Gold must have sunk underwater. However, no one would believe him and he was executed.

    When the crew returned with the South Bird in tow, Luffy decided to get the gold back. In Mock Town, new bounties were mailed in, and to everyone's surprise, they found out that Luffy's bounty was
    100,000,000 while Zoro’s was
    60,000,000—in comparison, Bellamy's was only
    55,000,000. Bellamy scoffed at this, claiming that they were fakes that were made to scare him.

   This calmed everyone down, until Luffy screamed for Bellamy to come out. Luffy demanded that Bellamy give the gold back, but he refused. Bellamy attacked him with his devil fruit powers, but Luffy still does not fight back. Angered, he decides to finish him off with his ultimate attack, Spring Hopper while still mocking him for following dreams. At this point, Luffy finally becomes fed up with Bellamy's words and took him down with a single punch. The terrified pirates realized that Luffy's wanted posters were actually real and ran away in fear.
