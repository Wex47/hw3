   A fleet of Marine ships from
    Branch 8
    goes through a rainstorm and a mysterious girl, Apis, plans her escape from the crew members of the ship. She manages to slip past her guard only to be chased across the deck. As she traps herself on the mast of the ship, she accidentally opens the sail, causing the wind to tip over the ship. She manages to escape by jumping off the mast and onto a small wooden boat while chanting to herself for Ryuji to protect her.

   The captain of the 8th Branch,
    Nelson Royale

   The next morning, Luffy grows impatient of getting to the Grand Line with Nami reassuring him they will reach it within a few days. Usopp spots the raft Apis is on surrounded by seagulls. Usopp and Sanji mistake this for a school of fish and ask Luffy to catch them. They only find a very confused and shocked Apis, who Luffy accidentally knocks Zoro off the boat to get. Apis wakes up later in the afternoon shocked to hear she was taken in by pirates, causing her to panic in fear. Later that night, the crew reassures Apis that they are "good" pirates. They eventually find out that she has escaped from Marine Branch 8 and is running from Commodore Nelson. The Straw Hats agree to return her back to
    Warship Island
    , and they are soon attacked by Branch 8. After escaping from the Marines, the Straw Hats realize that they are in the
    Calm Belt
    , where they find large sea kings. They then narrowly escape the
    Sea Kings
    and the Calm Belt, before continuing on their course to Warship Island. After reaching Warship Island, they find out that Apis has a
    Devil Fruit
    ability that allows her to talk to animals, and she has used it to befriend a dying Sennenryu, a type of dragon species thought to be extinct. She wants to return this Sennenryu to his homeland, but they run into two problems:

   In the English dub of the anime, produced by 4Kids Entertainment, these episodes were cut completely from the series. No explanation was given, and nothing (other than their irrelevance to the main plot of the series) would seem to be just cause for dropping them from the show entirely. Since their content is much more "kid-friendly" than the rest of the series, many fans actually expected 4Kids to heavily promote the arc, but the exact opposite happened. The precise reason for their deletion from the run of the English-dubbed anime remains unknown. However, 4Kids had been known to omit particularly strong death scenes from anime that they dubbed which could upset younger viewers, and this arc contained the passing of Ryuji.

   Another possible reason for the removal of this arc in the 4Kids adaption (including the removal of both the Reverse Mountain Arc and the Little Garden arc) was that many fans a stated that Al Kahn's marketing decision was to get to the Drum Island arc faster and introduce Tony Chopper much earlier in the 4Kids adaption as a marketing strategy to make money off of Chopper merchandise.
