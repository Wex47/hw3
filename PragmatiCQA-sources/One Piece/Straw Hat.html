   's straw hat is the main symbol of the entire series and is the origin of his nickname "Straw Hat Luffy." His straw hat was given to him by his idol,

   when Luffy was a child, and he promised to give the hat back to Shanks once he becomes a great pirate (or in other words, the
   Pirate King
   ).
   Much later, during the

   ' departure for
   Fish-Man Island
   , it was revealed by
   Silvers Rayleigh
   that this straw hat originally belonged to

   Although Luffy's straw hat is his treasure, he is seen without it on occasion. This is usually because he does not want anything bad to happen to it, in which case he usually gives it to another member of his crew for safekeeping. It has been damaged twice in the manga canon. The first time it was damaged by
   Buggy
   when he was fighting Luffy. Buggy spat on the hat as well when he learned that it previously belonged to Shanks. After the fight,
   <a href="Nami.html" key="12beac34-da82-4d47-8140-3063a48572eb" title="Nami">
    Nami

   repaired it for him. However, Luffy was overjoyed that Nami had repaired it, resulting in Luffy poking it several times, accidentally making another hole in the repair work. This caused Nami to hit him with the sharp end of the needle, since the repair had only been temporary. Nevertheless, she repaired it again.

   After saving the vivre card from getting eaten by
   Matsuge
   , Nami sews it on the inside of the red band around the circumference of Luffy's hat. After the arc, the hat was also given a string, so that Luffy could wear it securely on his person and would not have to worry about losing it.

   , Luffy's hat fell off when
   Jinbe
   , who was carrying him, was struck by
   Admiral
   Akainu
   . As Luffy was mentally shattered from his brother's death, he did not notice the hat falling off, nor did Jinbe, who was occupied with dealing with the Admiral. After Shanks appeared, the straw hat was temporarily reunited with its old owner after over ten years.
   Shanks convinces Buggy to return the straw hat to Luffy, resulting it to end up in
   Trafalgar Law
   's temporary care. The straw hat was then handed over to Rayleigh, who in turn returned the straw hat to Luffy after he recovered. Prior to his training with Rayleigh at

   One Piece: Stampede
   , Luffy placed an oversized bulbous brown hat atop the Straw Hat, which he got during the
   Pirates Festival
   . The hat had a bulb-like shape with a wavy rim, mainly light brown in colour, and has a dark-brown triangle design band around the widest part.

   In a poor attempt to impersonate Luffy,
   Demaro Black
   wore a straw hat. However, his straw hat was different as it was frayed and unkempt, with a flat top rather than a domed one, and a striped band around its circumference. It fell off when
   Sentomaru
   smashed him on the head.
