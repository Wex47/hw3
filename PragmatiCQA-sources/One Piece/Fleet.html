   A fleet, unlike a normal
   alliance
   , has a hierarchy with one clear leader, with all the other ships' captains being subservient to them. The
   Marines
   are shown to have a very strict hierarchy, assigning
   ranks
   to each sailor, thus facilitating a chain of command, in the event the upper ranks are isolated or eliminated in battle.

   , however, are much more laid back when it comes to ranking. If it's a single crew fleet, the most powerful and highest ranking combatants are generally put in charge of their own division (or ship); as such they follow the orders of the fleet
   admiral
   (or "commodore" in the English dub) full time. With a multi-crew fleet, the subordinate crews form a "parent-child alliance" with a single "parent" and his crew ranking above the "children" crews. The

    captains

   of each crew are effectively division commanders in their own right. However in a multi-crew fleet, unless the fleet's leader orders it, the individual "children" crews are permitted to roam freely and act as they please, provided their actions don't hurt the "parent's" or "sibling's" crews.
   It seems that traditionally, when a fleet is formed, the captains of the involved crews perform a
