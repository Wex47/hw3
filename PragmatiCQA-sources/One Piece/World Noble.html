      World Nobles... Slaves... Human shops... Against the "purity" of these "upper classes", the villains of the world look positively humane in comparison.

   Approximately 800 years before the current timeline, 20 royal families from different islands across
   the world
   formed an alliance to combat the
   Great Kingdom
   . After the 20 kingdom alliance was victorious, 19 of the 20 royal families relocated to the Holy Land of

   , a location referred to as "the center of the world". Only the royal family of
   Arabasta Kingdom
   chose to stay in their homeland.
  </p>
  <p key="98fd968a-d199-4727-8fe0-65d133496a67">
   Over time, the royal families in Mary Geoise built up their alliance with more and more nations from across the Four Blue Seas and both halves of the Grand Line, eventually turning the alliance into the
   World Government
   known to exist today. The World Nobles are the direct descendants of these 19 families.
  </p>
  <p key="3e9e2c8e-b0ac-4830-8a78-104f625360ba">
   As descendants of the creators of the World Government, the World Nobles have the highest authority within the organization. They are free to do as they please without consequences, even commit heinous crimes, and if they are threatened in any way, they have the authority to summon a
   Marine Admiral
   to deal with the offending party. The Celestial Dragons each possess a government-issued identification chip to identify their statuses.
   Homing
   handed his family's over to the government official escort when he had their statuses rescinded.
  </p>
  <p key="4d02fc84-8e3c-4c52-8d84-c0cd5c088771">
   The World Nobles constantly abuse their power and look down on the people of lower status than them, referring to them as commoners; even kings and queens are lowly peasants in their eyes and are expected to bow to the whims of the World Nobles, or their whole kingdoms could face destruction. According to
   <a href="Pappag.html" key="4a2abeaa-206c-4fb3-b7f7-4702a667515f" title="Pappag">

   , each subsequent generation of Celestial Dragons are worse than the last, becoming more and more arrogant and self righteous.
   Not only do they own
   slaves
   in broad daylight, a practice that is supposed to be illegal by order of the World Government, they also refuse to breathe the same air as "lesser beings", so they wear air helmets whenever they leave Mary Geoise,
   of course, in a place with the right kind of atmosphere, such as the
   <a href="Sabaody Archipelago.html" key="783fc722-675f-4e4c-bc3c-a420e12eec10" title="Sabaody Archipelago">
    Sabaody Archipelago
   </a>
   , they wear
   resin bubbles
   over their heads, preventing them from breathing the air of the common people, while also allowing them to take advantage of the bubbles permeable nature, such as by allowing them to eat ice cream through the bubble. Furthermore, whenever they appear, people are expected to immediately bow down, or risk upsetting them, with the exception of the guards, servants, and slaves that are alongside them.

   World Nobles wear their hair, or a part of it, combed upward with a distinct curl on top, unless they do not have enough hair to do so, as Mjosgard's father is partially bald. They all wear the same kind of white robe that resembles a spacesuit (sometimes accompanied by a cape) with a skirt, although the border designs of each Noble's clothing appears somewhat different and original and there are variations in the skirt's length. Male World Nobles seem to have a different style of collar than female World Nobles. While outside

    Mary Geoise
   </a>
   , World Nobles wear an oxygen tank attached to a bubble or glass case around their head in order to not breathe the same air as the "lowly commoners". However some are less likely to do so while in Mary Geoise, though others still feel the need to. A majority of World Nobles, such as Jalmack, Charlos, Mjosgard and his father, are notably overweight, if not outright obese. A typical Celestial Dragon also has a rather haughty, if not arrogant, look on their face, showing neither pity nor sympathy for those of lesser statuses.

  <p key="183b5628-0db4-4652-84c0-d835b5065674">
   When Homing's branch of the Donquixote Family abandoned their statuses, they ceased wearing their World Noble attire, and changed their hairstyles as well. Notably, even before their departure, this family alone seemed to have no members who are overweight, and had rather remarkably kind facial features (except Doflamingo, who possesses the same, nigh-perpetual arrogant look as his amoral former brethren). The male members all grew up to be rather tall.
  </p>
  <p key="93dae890-38fe-4f5b-8901-9390222aa3ef">
   Exceptions for the typical World Noble's wardrobe are mainly for the Five Elders. None of them wear the full-body robes nor the oxygen-tank connected bubble around their heads. Instead, they wear black business suits, while one wears a white samurai gi. Furthermore, none of them have their hairs curled upwards the same way their lower-ranked brethren does.

   The World Nobles claim to possess "the blood of this world's creators", which is their sole justification for their actions.
   This single fact allows them to utterly disregard any facet of law or society that does not serve their own interests. They have no regard for
   Justice
   , at best paying it lip service if at all, and are above any retribution for their actions (to the extent that they cannot be punished by the law, anyway).
   Eustass Kid
   regards them as a prime example of how corrupt and absurd the world is.
   The vast majority are under the impression (or delusion) that they are gods, not humans, and seem to think that being a Celestial Dragon itself is something beyond human comprehension.
   Because of this, most of them are unable to fear even if they are threatened by those who would ignore the World Government's protection, as
   Rosward
   only became wrathful towards Luffy for assaulting
   Charlos
   ,
   while
   Mjosgard
   only became furious at the fish-men for daring to defy him despite being isolated from witnesses and protection.

   However, there has been one Celestial Dragon who chose to abandon his status to live among the commoners.
   Donquixote Homing
   was always considered sacrilegious by his brethren for his different view on the lower class, and upon his declaration of being the same as all humans and request to have his World Noble status annulled, he and his entire family were condemned as traitors, forever losing their privileges and diplomatic immunity. The Celestial Dragons are so detached from the rest of humanity that they immediately severed all ties with Homing's branch of the Donquixote Family once Homing left to fraternize with the lower class. They felt offended when he compared himself with the rest of humanity, and felt no sympathy for him when he pleaded for them to at least rescue his wife and children from angry civilians, dejecting him for being a "mere human" who cannot regain the position he discarded. Also, by simply being connected to the "blasphemous traitor" Homing via bloodline,

   could not return to Mary Geoise either even after he brought his father's head as an appeasement offer. Unable to return to the higher social class, Doflamingo (being the sole member of his immediate family to remain attached to his heritage) felt that he was forever condemned to the hell known as the world of humanity.

   Although commoners bow down at the presence of an approaching World Noble, they fear and despise the Nobles due to their arrogance and cruelty, yet do not dare attack due to the fear of an admiral's wrath. Certain people, however, are willing to look past the admirals and attack anyways, such as

   </a>
   , and the
   Revolutionary Army
   . In fact, the Celestial Dragons are so loathed among the citizenry, especially slaves who escaped, that if given the chance, some people would eagerly try to kill them. A prime example is how
   Mjosgard
   became a prime target due to no one willing to report his potential murder to an admiral, and instead noting the death could be written off as another "shipwreck incident". Even the normally good-natured mermaids appeared to support Mjosgard's murder, so long as there was no backlash.
   World Nobles that give up their position, have been shown to be met with extreme prejudice from the common people. When Donquixote Homing gave up his family's status and was no longer under the government's protection, the citizens of the country he moved to burned down his mansion and hunted him and his family. Since the World Nobles refused to take him back, Homing and his family were forced into hiding in a junkyard and living in squalor until they were caught. Homing and his sons were hung against a wall and threatened with extended torture for the crimes of the World Nobles.
   However, while commoners and former slaves despise such people, many regular Nobles actually idolize them. The nobles of the
   Goa Kingdom
   even went to great lengths to impress just one World Noble. After having witnessed Jalmack seemingly kill
   Sabo
   the citizens were more concerned about angering the Noble over the fact he tried to kill a child, then later cheered for the noble while he was riding a slave. Doflamingo is noted for his complete lack of fear of the World Nobles, on account of himself being a former one. He went as far as to rob tributes from them to blackmail the government, an attitude that the government finds very troublesome.
   Kurozumi Orochi
   believed that with

   , not even the Celestial Dragons can threaten the powerful nation of samurai, and openly mocked the
   CP0
   agents who tried to negotiate with him for opening the country's borders for weapons.
   According to Sengoku, Garp hates the World Nobles and holds no true loyalty towards them. The main reason he refused to become an admiral is because he does not want to become their direct subordinate.
  </p>
  <p key="a1c5ece1-6831-4d11-b23e-cd6cdf20bd67">
   World Nobles also appear to have little knowledge of the outside world, and therefore have little knowledge of the common folk's resentment towards them. This is exemplified by Homing's ignorance of the common people's hatred for nobles as well as a young Doflamingo's shock and anger after seeing no one bow to him, having been under the impression commoners always bow to a World Noble when one is present. They are so heavily pampered and protected that none of the Nobles seem to understand pain or hunger, as Doflamingo did not know how such concepts felt until he was forced into poverty after his father's withdrawal from their positions.
  </p>
  <p key="164bbfb0-d255-489a-a752-b923de445078">
   Despite their arrogance, the World Nobles can have a sense of appreciation for people with lesser status when they leave a good enough impression, as Otohime managed to retrieve support from one World Noble for Fish-Man Island's migration and her influence has led Mjosgard to become a better person. Wapol's company earned so much renown that the Celestial Dragons granted him an entire kingdom. Goa Kingdom went to great lengths (bribery, arson, murder and betrayal in the
   Gray Terminal
   ) to obtain a visiting World Noble's gratitude in the prospect of elevating their own noble status. Donquixote Homing was noted to be a benevolent Celestial Dragon who considered himself human, which was seen by his arrogant compatriots as blasphemy. While believing that his family should live the modest life of normal commoners, he abandoned Mary Geoise, taking his wife and two sons with him. This had a rather adverse effect on both the family's well-being and reputation, resulting in them being labelled as traitors by the Celestial Dragons while being treated as scapegoats by the common people.

   They tend to treat their slaves poorly, working them to exhaustion then punishing them for their weakness.
   Each Celestial Dragon shown so far has been seen wielding a firearm, mostly for shooting people they dislike.
   When faced with defiance from commoners that they cannot immediately rectify through the use of their pistols, they have the power to summon an
   admiral
   to deal with the offender. Failure in dealing with the offender is considered unacceptable.
   However, this does not apply to a dispute between World Nobles as Mjosgard could stop Charlos from enslaving Shirahoshi.

   World Nobles have been shown to be extremely cruel and brutal towards their slaves, as many people who were their slaves were brutalized so harshly and traumatically that many committed suicide after being freed, with one slave stating his eyes were plucked out solely for sport and another was burned alive just for laughs.
   The horrors the nobles leave on the slaves have been shown to viciously traumatize them even after their release, as both Koala and Hancock, through their horrid experience, were terrified of showing weakness ever again towards others. Even Fisher Tiger, who freed many slaves, commented on them representing the "madness" of humanity; his personality was forever warped from his years as a slave. During
   Gild Tesoro
   's past as a slave, it was shown that the World Nobles even forbid their slaves from smiling.

   Shirahoshi
   , Charlos attempted to enslave her in front of her family without fear of repercussions for his actions thanks to CP0 intervening. They even have the right to enslave royalty even in the events of such importance such as

   Bartholomew Kuma
   was made a slave for rent for the World Nobles and, as a result, they horribly abuse him due to his inability to resist demands from them.

   So far, typical Celestial Dragons have shown absolutely no physical combat abilities whatsoever, and appear to merely be simple humans. They have great pull in the government as well as a vast amount of wealth to do with whatever they please. Through the tremendous political power they have with the government, they can order things of such magnitude and triviality like the creation of a bridge that connects every island for no reason other than they simply wanted to, as well as make any commoner they want into a slave of theirs right off the street. They can even enslave royalty as was shown when Charlos attempted to enslave Shirahoshi, the princess of the Ryugu Kingdom. They are also completely immune to the entire legal system and justice set by the World Government, as shown where they are allowed to kill anyone that simply crosses their path. Their political authority is just second to that of the

   They each seem to possess a firearm of some kind, but more often than not are quite inefficient, using it only to injure and murder people they dislike at point blank range. Usually, they simply rely on people's fear of them, but their greatest weapon is that when they are attacked in any way they can summon an
   admiral
   to obliterate their attackers.
   CP0
   works directly under the command of the World Nobles and is said to be the strongest of all Cipher Pol units, including the assassination specialists,

    CP9
   </a>
   . It is said that nothing good can come from this group's presence.
   However, if there are no witnesses to report an attack against a World Noble, then the threat of an admiral is nullified, which would leave said noble weak and vulnerable.
   Indeed, when the
   Donquixote Family
   abandoned their statuses, they found themselves struggling for survival due to their pampered past, and helplessly facing the wrath of angry civilians who took full advantage of the family's lost protection.
   Although
   Donquixote Homing
   and his wife died shortly after leaving the holy land due to their lack of experience with the outside world,
   their sons Doflamingo and Rosinante managed to survive due to their respective circumstances: Doflamingo awoke the rare
   Haoshoku Haki

   and impressed his four friends—
   Vergo
   ,
   Trebol

   Diamante
   and
   Pica
   —who protected him and raised him to become their king;
   Rosinante was saved by Sengoku and recruited into the Marines, while doing so as a necessary part of his survival.
   The only thing that appears to trump the authority of a single World Noble is that of another World Noble, as when Charlos tried to enslave Shirahoshi, the only one who could stop him from doing so was

The ship's figurehead is that of a golden animal wearing a crown with a white mount, with what appears to be golden whiskers coming out from underneath the figurehead. The ship that carried the Donquixote Family to a North Blue nation and Jalmack to Dawn Island both have a golden lion head with a golden crown, suggesting it's the same ship on two different voyages.

Doflamingo alone remains attached to his heritage, showcasing the spoiled nature typical of the World Nobles, in which his father intended to reform him. When World Noble hating commoners attacked the now vulnerable Donquixote Family, his wife died of illness not long after, which an 8-year-old Doflamingo would blame on the deplorable lifestyle as outcasts that his father brought upon them.

   When Homing desperately contacted the Celestial Dragons in Mary Geoise to at least rescue his kin, they coldly turned him down and warned him to never call them again. Two years later, Homing was killed by a 10-year-old Doflamingo, who was fed up with the terrible lifestyle. The child then returned to Mary Geoise with his father's head in an attempt to appeal for his former status, but the World Nobles refused to let "a family of traitors" return.
   Due to Doflamingo having knowledge of Mary Geoise' national treasure, seen as a danger by the Celestial Dragons, they tried—and failed—to have him killed, making him an outlaw, and eventual pirate. He was able to use this knowledge to blackmail them into granting him rights (to a certain extent) to the ones he lost when his father dragged him away from the holy land, something he would use 33 years later against his enemies.
   With his four extremely loyal friends, who worshiped him as their king, Doflamingo was able to simulate the privileges of a Celestial Dragon, as they shot down anyone who offended Doflamingo, and burning down an entire town simply for having a poorly paved street that made him trip.

   In the current storyline, they were first seen when two of them, Saint
   Rosward
   and his daughter Saint
   Shalria
   , appeared on the Sabaody Archipelago. They were seen upon the fall of the escaped slave
   Devil Dias
   . After abusing the slave for his futile efforts to escape. The third member of their family, Saint
   Charlos
   , appeared as he was walking through town. People bowed down and even the Supernovas present did not try to walk in his path.

   of the Straw Hat Pirates, however, did not know who Charlos was and even asked if he (Charlos) needed directions. Appalled at Zoro's actions, Charlos aimed and shot his pistol but Zoro easily dodges while drawing his sword. Another Supernova,
   Jewelry Bonney
   , managed to save herself and the rest of the pirates on Sabaody from an
   Admiral
   by tricking people into thinking that Zoro was dead. Even though Charlos had a feeling that the swordsman dodged the bullets, he believed that he still managed to kill Zoro.

   All three members of the family are later seen at the auction house where Camie is going to be sold. Charlos made a bid of
   500,000,000 on the
   mermaid

   After witnessing his son being assaulted, Rosward drew out a gun and attempted to kill Luffy. Rosward called out for an
   admiral
   while guards entered the auction house and tried to stop the
   Straw Hat Pirates
   . He was knocked out when
   Usopp
   fell on top of him. His daughter Shalria attempted to kill the mermaid they were after, but
   Rayleigh
   knocked her out with his
