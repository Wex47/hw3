  <p key="4128df63-b3ec-4247-ae5e-47768a03b674">
   The major strength of the fruit, as demonstrated by Boa Hancock, is that the user is able to transform those who lust or love after the user into stone in varying degrees by using their "dirty thoughts". Victims that have been completely turned to stone are incapable of consciousness and susceptible to physical damage unless the user de-petrifies them.
   Petrification can also be achieved through physically striking an opponent, although the only area that is turned to stone is the contacted area, as opposed to the entire body. The power also extends to nonliving objects
   , including
   Pacifistas
   .
  </p>
  <p key="63bf98fd-a148-4665-87fc-5366f146c9f0">
   The powers of the fruit can cause any victim(s), whether they're male or female, with feelings of lust to fall for the user as any feelings of lust they have will be strengthened and aimed towards the user, making them even more susceptible to the fruit's petrification effects. Since Hancock possesses near unparalleled beauty, enticing men with her powers takes very little effort while with women she will use more flirtatious and "cutesy" behavior. Apparently, once the petrification takes effect, the victim or victims experience a state of suspended animation where their subjective sense of time is completely halted by the fruit's power, effectively making it look to them as though time itself has stopped from the victim's point of perspective, and will last this way unless Hancock chooses to relinquish their petrified states.
  </p>
  <p key="ad79b759-784c-4426-95da-d0f2a83aa12c">
   While the fruit's powers, specifically the aforementioned technique, use the focused lust of a user's victim to fuel the petrification, if the intended targets have no sense of lust or cannot see her (such as being blind),
   then the powers are nullified. This can be achieved either by being distracted by other emotions, such as pain, bitterness and fear, or by simply lacking lust to begin with. For example,
   Vice-Admiral
   Momonga
   was able to resist her powers by stabbing his hand
   , and
   <a href="Monkey D. Luffy.html" key="81539884-d5ba-4a51-a7d9-56979e376b03" title="Monkey D. Luffy">
    Monkey D. Luffy
   </a>
   initially believed the attack aimed at him to be an attack from
   Foxy
   's
   Noro Noro no Mi
   ,
   but it is later revealed that Luffy is immune to her powers due to him having a pure heart, thereby having no wicked or ill intentions on his part. There have been others shown to be capable of resisting her beauty, such as
   Smoker
   ,
   Crocodile
   , and
   Dracule Mihawk
   ; whether this means they feel attraction but have enough willpower to suppress it or they are simply too hardened to be affected by the fruit has yet to be revealed.

   Hancock uses this Devil Fruit power to petrify her victims. However, the contradictory story that her fellow Kuja are given is that she and her sisters killed a Gorgon and were "cursed". The Gorgon gave each sister a set of eyes on their backs. Whenever anyone sees the back of her and her sisters, they turn to stone. This story is actually a lie, concocted to hide her shameful past as a slave at the hands of the
   Celestial Dragons
   . Hancock's Devil Fruit was originally fed to her for entertainment purposes only.
  </p>
  <p key="9eec5587-0ff1-4653-99e9-240a8b29b85c">
   Even without the use of any kind of special technique, Hancock can use her great physical prowess to attack in hand-to-hand combat; her Devil Fruit gives her the ability to turn anything she strikes to stone, and also does not need the victim to lust after her. This allows her to take down opponents that possess little to no thought (like the
   Pacifista
   ).

    Busoshoku Haki
    to hurt the foe. The pun here is that the kanji for gun (銃) is part of the phrase "jū no tsutsu" (銃の筒), meaning "gun barrel", which Hancock's index finger is essentially serving as, in order for this technique to work. It is unknown if this attack carries the same petrifying properties as the rest of Hancock's attacks, as it has only been used once against Luffy, who has no lust towards Hancock.

She then pulls the heart back with a hand and, with a pop like that of a bubble, hundreds of arrows (all of them tipped and fletched with a stylized heart design) are fired and barrage her opponent(s) before petrifying them; the sheer number of arrows unleashed makes this move particularly difficult to evade. This technique not only petrifies anyone and anything that it hits, but somehow manages to freeze them in place, regardless of whether or not they were in motion or not, to the extent that she even stopped cannonballs in their tracks. The pun in this technique is that, although the kanji used here (虜) may mean "imprisonment", it can also mean "captive", as in someone being captivated by love.
