   As well as featuring the bounty spread released with
   Chapter 435
   it also recapped several known bounties throughout the series. The Times noted that the
   Straw Hats
   had done a big crime against the
   World Government
   which would not go unnoticed. On top of that, it mentioned their captain now has a bounty that rivals the
   Seven Warlords of the Sea
   and how they had come to achieve the bounties thus far.
  </p>
  <p key="8303b787-3cda-4259-ac23-74265ce2e586">
   The change in Luffy's bounty was noted to also effect how people will view him such as the Warlords,

   and
   Whitebeard
   upon hearing about it.
   Blackbeard
   was also mentioned as being a chaotic force, a pirate with an unknown bounty and a strange presence surrounding him.
  </p>
  <p key="452b4526-f9cf-40b1-96ca-e5e5d7a6c947">
   The Times also recapped how a pirate gets a bounty. When a pirate commits a crime, it is straight away reported by a Marine via
   Den Den Mushi
   that a pirate has committed a crime (
   <i key="44c76225-3e20-4d2f-8aa3-b47a69bd6b71">
    a note was made that in Luffy's case, the Marine who reported him wasn't much better
   </i>
   ). Afterwards, an investigation is led on the said island where the crime was committed. All crimes are examined, facts check and the threat level is determined. The one who decides the amount is Major
   Brannew
   at
   Marine Headquarters
   .

   The writer also "interviewed"
   Iceburg
   , asking him what is needed for a pirate ship to be considered "outstanding". Iceburg mentioned that pirate ships originate from normal ships and as such, are not that different, but proceeded to give the writer three conditions: one, "intimidating appearance", such as using stern figureheads to strike fear into the hearts of their foes thus making them easier to deal with, citing
   Krieg Pirates' ship
   , still unnamed at the time, as an example; two, "equipments", as most pirate ship battles sooner or later turn into hand-to-hand combat situations, and usually the ship with the most methods of holding back the foe (via gadgets and weaponry) will win the fight, citing
   Sexy Foxy
   as an example; and three, "small-scale war capabilities", since pirates also rely on the element of surprise more than anything, after that it is down to the offense and defense of either side as to how events play out in the pursuing fights, citing
   Maxim
   and
   Bliking
   as examples.
  </p>
  <p key="bd9c800a-97d0-4b3a-80a5-374ea97933cd">
   Iceburg then concluded that, no doubt, the strongest ship had to be Oro Jackson, (which was made from
   Adam Wood
   ) as it was the
