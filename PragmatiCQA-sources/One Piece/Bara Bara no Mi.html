    Strengths
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="1d8fb3e1-c888-424b-a4dd-0ce4e5a08be9">
   The fruit's major strength, as demonstrated by Buggy, is that the user becomes permanently immune to damage from being cut or pierced, regardless in what manner, be it vertical, horizontal, or otherwise. Instead of being wounded or even killed from such attacks, the user's body simply becomes sliced into pieces. In this state, the user is still alive and can control his sliced up body. They can then manipulate the sliced up pieces to either reattach themselves back together or execute unique attacks. In the anime, Buggy has even demonstrated being able to re-constitute himself in a
   Logia
   -like manner after literally getting reduced to fine strips by
   Dracule Mihawk
   .
  </p>
  <p key="a150a056-a9e4-424f-9386-d61c05a78aee">
   As part of the Devil Fruit's powers, the user can split their body apart by themselves without the need of being chopped up by others in the first place. This is a convenient ability during battles, since it allows the user to attack through enemy blocking attempts
   or avoid any incoming moves as long as they see it coming.
   The user is also able to live without being connected to major parts and organs of his body for long periods of time, as evidenced by
   Chibi Buggy's Adventure
   .
  </p>
  <p key="f6507f8f-ba74-441a-910f-fde8514292e0">
   Additionally, the levitation effect seems to be able to extend to things in contact with the user, allowing them to bypass gravity by lifting objects regardless how heavy they actually are for as long as Buggy has a firm grip on them. With this aspect of the Fruit's power, Buggy has shown to be able to easily lift individuals much larger (and probably heavier) than himself, such as the
   Blue Gorillas
   and
   Jinbe
   .

    Weaknesses
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="c72f7197-0fbf-4121-9154-a72576795dc1">
   Though the user is immune to slashing and piercing attacks, they are still susceptible to other forms of engagement, such as blunt attacks like punches and kicks. Also, even when the bodypart is separated, the user can still feel sensations of whatever happens to that part. This can be a major weakness even when the user is split up, as an enemy can do all sorts of things to the other body parts.
   This includes tickling, pinching, groin kicks
   and tying up most of the user's body parts.
  </p>
  <p key="946a1db5-b12e-426d-adca-a80072914f3b">
   The user can only control his separated pieces from and up to a certain distance. There is a cutoff point as to how far the user can use his separated parts. If a part goes any further from the cutoff point, the user loses all control of that part. This includes levitation and the user consciously using that body part altogether. This distance is a
   <b key="531bffdd-e286-4ccd-b2f6-b5027349e8bd">
    200 Bara Bara
   </b>
   diameter circle around the point where the person touches the ground.
   In relation to this, for the user to be able to levitate any of his body parts, their feet must stay on the ground at all times, as they are the only body parts incapable of levitation. This can be rectified a bit if someone else carries their feet as it serves as a foothold for them to stand on. However, Buggy has been seen running in midair while separated at the waist. Whether or not this is a continuity error is unknown.
  </p>
  <p key="6a9e5f9d-dd77-4291-bc9f-6d1ce3b5d5fc">
   Additionally, in Impel Down, Buggy's head was drawn toward his body once his feet left the ground and his body fell down the hole to the second floor, as though his parts are connected by an invisible force. This somewhat conflicts with the mechanisms of his power when his head and body were separated and Luffy blasted his body away, but his head did not follow. This may be because his feet were with his head, not his body, at the time.
  </p>
  <p key="97c7eccc-9de2-4702-86a7-6c744badd73d">
   Other than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weakness.

    Usage
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="75bf1d9f-bbb8-45f9-a51a-884af3761b15">
   Originally, Buggy intended to use the fruit in order to fund his search for an undersea treasure, but ended up eating it by accident. Since then, Buggy has exploited the fruit's bestowed powers to help him obtain as much treasure as he can.
  </p>
  <p key="33a88946-8348-40d2-9a73-7eaeb21fdf33">
   Buggy has used his fruit's powers for fighting, protecting himself (by either ejecting body parts before enemy impact or picking up other people as meat shields) and punishment towards those who fail or annoy him (usually by using his split off hand to suffocate or hold them up in front of a cannon shot). By combining his splitting with his penchant for trickery and skill with knives, Buggy can easily catch opponents off-guard in case they attempt to block his moves. Because of this ability automatically triggering when his body is cut by external sources, Buggy is completely fearless towards any and all swordsmen, contrary to his usual cowardice against more powerful enemies. This aspect of his devil fruit means Buggy can sometimes surprise foes who think they may have successfully killed him.
  </p>
  <p key="c3d6ec93-d4e7-4e56-9d81-65bd203cf2d7">
   During the aftermath of his defeat at Luffy's hands, Buggy was forced to travel around East Blue in a chibi-like form of sorts, consisting of only his head, hands, and feet, which greatly limited his capabilities. The rest of his body remained motionless until he managed to reunite with his missing parts and become complete once more.
  </p>
  <p key="8844a38d-e292-448f-9996-d41b68a36272">
   After the timeskip Buggy is shown using his devil fruit powers in conjunction with a oversized cloak to make himself appear much taller and more threatening, likely to better fit his new image as a member of the
   Seven Warlords of the Sea
   and leader of the
   Pirate Dispatch Organization

    : Buggy detaches his hands and grabs onto an opponent with them before lifting them high into the air. He then turns them so that they are facing the ground before sending his hands flying in a corkscrew pattern back down to earth, throwing them on the ground with high impact. This was first seen being used against a
    Blugori
    in Impel Down.

    : A "flashier" attempt at recalling all his body parts, Buggy starts to chant "Bara Bara" ("Chop Chop" in the FUNimation dub) endlessly while performing this move.

   At least 27 years ago,
   when
   Buggy
   was a
   Pirate Apprentice
   of the
   Roger Pirates
   , the crew came across the Bara Bara no Mi.
   <a href="Shanks.html" key="cbac65e3-cef8-4d89-9b81-ba0f6e2bf617" title="Shanks">
    Shanks
   </a>
   told Buggy about
   Devil Fruits
   , how they granted superpowers in exchange for the user's ability to swim. Buggy, having recently taken a
   treasure
   map from another pirate ship that showed treasure at the bottom of the sea, showed no interest in eating one, but Shanks then informed him that they could sell for
   100,000,000. Hearing this, Buggy took the Bara Bara no Mi and made a fake fruit resembling it, and consumed the fake before the entire crew. Later, in one of the ship's life boats, he gloated to himself about his plan: selling the fruit for enough money to go after the treasure. Shanks then appeared, startling Buggy, who hid the fruit in his mouth to avoid Shanks seeing it. He expressed relief before Shanks immediately came back and startled him again, making him accidentally swallow the fruit whole. Realizing what had happened, Buggy raged at Shanks, only to be horrified when the latter pointed out his treasure map falling into the ocean. He dove in to retrieve it, only to find that he was unable to move beneath the ocean's surface due to his Devil Fruit. He was saved thanks to Shanks diving in and getting him back on board. From thereon, Buggy decided that if he couldn't get the treasure under the sea, he would use his new powers to gather all the treasure on land instead.
