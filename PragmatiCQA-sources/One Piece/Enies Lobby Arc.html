   The others finally catch up, and as the CP9 and Straw Hats face each other, Robin's past is finally revealed, as well as her last reason for being unwilling to return to the crew: having been betrayed so many times in the past, she's terrified that one day the Straw Hats will see her as a burden, and also betray her. She screams that she would prefer death to that. The other Straw Hats quietly acknowledged the reason Robin had, then
    Spandam
    burst out laughing, saying she's absolutely accurate, and nobody would be stupid enough to think she wasn't a burden after traveling with her. Spandam pointed at the flag on top of the
    Tower of Justice
    , and told Luffy that the organization after Robin is over 170 affiliated nations.

  <p key="39ace11a-032b-4936-984a-dfc88231590e">
   Luffy acknowledged this, then told Sogeking to shoot down the flag. Sogeking complied, utilizing his new

   . Spandam questioned Luffy's sanity, but he just bellowed back that he can take it, then tells Robin to admit that she wants to live. Unable to doubt her friends any longer after seeing them declare that her enemy is their enemy also, she tearfully begged them to take her out to sea with them.

  <p key="0bf33e9a-e8bb-4700-b8ea-b36b334a7294">
   At this point, the Franky Family finally managed to pull the levers, and the drawbridge between the courthouse and the Tower of Justice began to lower. The Straw Hats waited impatiently, while Spandam is terrified. However, Judge Baskerville ordered the personnel to fire the mortar cannon to forcibly stop the drawbridge.
    Paulie
    and
    Zambai
    attempted to stop him by cutting between his three heads, but it is revealed that they were three people in the same suit. The mortar cannon fired, stopping the drawbridge, and Spandam started to drag Robin, heading for the

   Franky, impressed by the nerve of the Straw Hats, and knowing he has misjudged Robin, revealed the blueprints that the government had been after. He explained that the architect who wrote the blueprints of

   thought there should not exist a weapon like this without having a weapon against it in the case of it falling into the hands of someone like Spandam. Because he figured this was the only way to satisfy the wish of the architect, Franky then burned the blueprints right in front of CP9, telling them that he is betting on the Straw Hats' victory: if they lose, and Robin is taken, the world will end; but if they win, Spandam will be left with nothing. He told Luffy that he will help him with his fight. In anger, Spandam pushed Franky over the balcony, but Kokoro

  <p key="64f5cda8-53a0-4f1a-b44d-8db5b1c82499">

   The Straw Hats emerged from the wreckage of the Rocketman, having suffered only minor injuries. When they head towards the stairs, they are called by
    Fukurou
    , who was in a corner of the room. He tells them that Robin is being taken to the Gates of Justice by Lucci and Spandam, and that CP9 has been given orders to eliminate them. He then showed them a key, which he explained is a key to Robin's

   Luffy attempted to get it back, but Fukurou evaded with Soru. When he reappeared, he tells the crew that the key he has may or may not be the one to Robin's cuffs. He goes on to say that, including him, there are five CP9 members in the building, each with a key, and only one would release Robin's handcuffs. The Straw Hats would need to defeat all of CP9 to be sure that they had the right key. Nami suggested that they retrieve Robin first, but Fukurou threatened to throw the key into the ocean if she does. Fukurou tells them that CP9 is giving them a chance, then fled into the building.
  </p>
  <p key="a3af92d6-da49-4d83-a6e3-e18868b2455c">
   Luffy immediately started to run after Fukurou, but Zoro and Sogeking hold him back, saying that they need to decide where they are going first. After clarifying that Lucci is "the pigeon guy", they decided to send Luffy on ahead to deal with him. Sanji stated that without Luffy, they have six people with them, and they'll need to defeat the five CP9 in the building before heading off to join Luffy. Sogeking worried that if Robin gets to the Gates of Justice, it's all over. Knowing it's a race against time, the Straw Hats rush off, with the determination to win their fights, even if they die trying. Chimney and Gonbe ran after them, wishing them luck, but then fell through a trapdoor. Kokoro, who had been drinking, wondered where they went.
  </p>
  <p key="90d45e7d-f41e-4200-beea-94f4c0105c77">
   Chimney and Gonbe end up in a candlelit secret passageway, and heard something echoing from the other end. When they recognized it as Spandam's voice, they ran towards it. Spandam, with Lucci and Robin behind him, walked down a spiral staircase, Spandam laughing and taunting Robin all the while. Chimney and Gonbe emerged from a hidden door in the tower, then followed the group. They reached the bottom of the tower, finding a large, formidable-looking steel door with an electric lock. Spandam fumbled with the control panel for a few moments, during which Lucci noticed Chimney and Gonbe, but does nothing. The door opened, revealing a very long corridor.
  </p>
  <p key="e4c9c8f5-210a-41c3-9679-161eb04c983f">
   Franky ran through the tower, looking for the kitchen to refill his cola supply. He finally finds it, but Fukurou blocked his way. Nami encountered
    Kumadori
    in a dungeon, and Sogeking tried a number of doors before coming across a garden where
    Jabra
    is sleeping with the key lying on the ground in front of him. Sanji runs into an apparently empty room, but
    Kalifa
    revealed herself and effortlessly seduced Sanji into taking tea with her. Zoro, swords at the ready, confronted
    Kaku
    in his study.

  <p key="b3672b0a-ffde-420d-85bc-3846a70bfacd">
   Luffy, finally having found the right path through the maze of staircases within the tower, arrived at the top of the Judicial Tower, but finds that Fukurou was telling the truth and Robin had already left. Spandam, explained that even if Luffy were to catch up to them, he would not know how to get across to the Gate. Kaku, claiming to be CP9's best

    four-sword style
    against Zoro. After a duel revealed them to be evenly matched, he declared Zoro a worthy opponent, and uses his newfound
    Devil Fruit abilities
    for the first time.
  </p>
  <p key="d2ba7c8c-d334-4a61-8db1-bb8a0257eed2">
   Meanwhile, Sogeking tried to steal the key from the sleeping Jabra without a fight. Before he can reach it, however, a rooster appeared and chirps, startling him into making noise that woke Jabra up. He recognized Sogeking as a pirate and attacks him, revealing his Devil Fruit ability:
    Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Wolf
    . The fight is then interrupted by the room's ceiling collapsing.
  </p>
  <p key="7fcb72da-6e40-4ccf-8b51-136d16486c01">
   Zoro fell down, followed by Kaku, whose Devil Fruit gives him the form of a giraffe. However, his inexperience with his new powers caused him to accidentally transform into the full animal form rather than the hybrid. Jabra finds Kaku's new appearance very funny indeed, and they get into an argument until Zoro reminded Kaku of their fight. He subsequently changed into his hybrid form, but his appearance makes Zoro lose his focus, and made Jabra laugh even harder. Noticing their distraction, Sogeking tried to immobilize the assassins with a pair of
   <a href="Seastone.html" key="9d09e357-5d73-48e3-86ff-fa388dcb14ee" title="Seastone">
    Seastone handcuffs

   he finds, but only succeeded in hitting Zoro, as his aim was spoiled by laughing at Kaku. The latter, annoyed that everybody is laughing at him, lost his temper and cut the tower in half with his
    Rankyaku: Amane Dachi
    . Zoro and Sogeking avoid the attack, but find themselves accidentally locked together by the seastone handcuffs. Since Kaku and Jabra cannot decide who gets to kill their opponents while they are handcuffed together, they offered to unlock the two to avoid getting into another argument. Sadly, neither of them had the correctly numbered key, so they resign themselves to fighting both of them.

   Meanwhile, Chopper managed to find the room where Zoro and Sogeking are fighting. They tell Chopper that he must find one of the other CP9 members and get the number 2 key. Chopper ran off, hoping that Sanji will have the right key. In the dungeon, Kumadori has Nami trapped with his hair attacks, giving her no opportunity to use her

After three cups of tea, Sanji came to his senses and demanded Kalifa's key. She took advantage of his reluctance to hurt women and kicked him across the room.

  <p key="78506011-ba19-4297-88f3-598abe252a48">
   Finally, Luffy reached the bottom of the judicial tower, where he can see the Gates of Justice in front of him. The only problem is that between him and the Gates is a giant whirlpool.

  <p key="fea3e11f-8c1b-4c27-8f9f-d7ea572db721">
   Nami is nearly killed by Kumadori before Chopper attacked him to rescue her, and she escaped having stolen Kumadori's key. Sanji suddenly fell from an upper story, his body terribly wounded and deformed by some
    unknown power
    into a doll-like figure. He explained his plight to Nami, who gently chastised him for his foolishness before advancing to face Kalifa herself.

   At the Gate of Justice, Luffy nearly drowned trying to cross the ocean by himself, but is rescued by Gonbe and Chimney, who led him to a secret passage that
    Spandam
    had used earlier. It led to the lower areas of the tower, and eventually to an immovable steel door. Luffy broke through it with his new
    Gear Third

   Meanwhile, Franky and Fukurou's battle continued into the kitchen, each one trying to punch harder than the other. As the two swapped blows and taunts, Franky began to flag due to lack of cola, but their fight was interrupted by Kumadori and Chopper, who burst in through one wall. Chopper's first
    Rumble Ball
    has worn off, so he stalled Kumadori by locking him in an enormous fridge. He joined forces with Franky, and after "accidentally" giving the cyborg the wrong drink several times, Chopper gave Franky a full cola refill. Franky, now super-charged, punched Fukurou out of the building, and their fight continued outside, taking them down into the ocean and then high above the Tower, where Franky ended the fight with his
    Coup de Vent
    cannon. Franky then grabs the Number 4 key off of Fukurou's coat pocket.

   Zoro and Usopp are still handcuffed together, and running from Kaku and Jabra as best they can. The two agents managed to get into another argument in the process, giving Zoro and Usopp a chance to form a plan—if Zoro cannot hold a sword with Usopp on his arm, Usopp must 'become' his sword and be used as a weapon instead. Usopp reluctantly agreed.

  <p key="3a04dc13-a033-42ef-b628-0bfa879250bf">
   Back in the kitchen, Kumadori escaped from the fridge by eating his way out, and confronted Chopper, who is forced to eat another Rumble Ball in the hope of beating this powerful enemy. However, eating two Rumble Balls in such a short time made his transformations random and erratic, leaving him open to attacks. In the end even his strongest attack could not defeat Kumadori, and he fell, badly wounded.
  </p>
  <p key="1581eff1-a9fa-45a8-bbe2-80760d084198">
   In the moment before Kumadori finished him, he remembered the last time he took three Rumble Balls in a row, and how he woke up to hear that a monster had destroyed much of his village. His mentor Dr. Kureha had told him that the monster had been him, and made him promise to never do it again. With an apology to Kureha, and hoping that his friends aren't nearby, he took a third Rumble Ball, and grew into a gigantic, terrifying
    monster
    that dwarfs Kumadori. He crushed the CP9 agent and threw him from the Tower of Justice to the main island.

   In Kalifa's room, Nami's battle seemed to have ended prematurely - she lay paralyzed on the floor as Kalifa calmly took a bath. Nami, recovering her strength, tried to attack the CP9 agent, who defended herself with her newfound Devil Fruit powers - she is revealed to have eaten the
    Awa Awa no Mi
    , which allows her to create bubbles which can weaken enemies, harden into soap for defense, or transmute an enemy's body entirely (as in the case of Sanji). Having worked this out, Nami continued to fight, but is soon weakened by Kalifa's bubbles.

   Spandam, at first panicking and not realizing that he is still on air, started to gloat that the lives of the Marines do not matter as long as he can bring Robin alive to the Gates of Justice. Robin cut in on his broadcast with a warning to the Marines. Understandably alarmed, the listening Marines evacuated the island, leaving the Franky Family and Galley-La workers behind as prisoners.

   Hearing Robin's warning, Luffy tried to force his way past Lucci to reach her, but Lucci fought back fiercely and stopped him in his tracks, forcing him to continue the fight. Jabra and Kaku decided to end their fight with Zoro and Usopp quickly in order to escape the approaching bombardment.

   In Kalifa's room, Nami struggled against the superior skill and powers of her opponent, who began to transmute Nami's body just like she did with Sanji. Before she can finish Nami off, however, Chopper broke into the room, still in monstrous form and totally out of control. The giant Chopper attacked Nami wildly, uprooting Kalifa's bath in the process. He threw it down the stairs to where Sanji lay unconscious below, drenching the whole area with water before storming off. The water from the bath washed away Kalifa's weakening bubbles; A splash on Nami's leg let her realize how to restore herself using Rain Tempo. She then used Mirage Tempo to confuse Kalifa before eventually defeating her with a Thunder Lance Tempo and taking her key.

   Meanwhile, Chopper wandered into Zoro and Sogeking's fight, and Zoro fought to protect him from Jabra and Kaku. Franky arrived and decided that the only way to stop Chopper is to knock him into the ocean to cancel his Devil Fruit powers. He blew Chopper out of the tower with his Coup de Vent, then jumped in after to save him. Nami unlocked Zoro and Sogeking's handcuffs, allowing the real fight against Jabra and Kaku to begin. Kaku uses a powerful Rankyaku attack to literally slice the tower in two.

   Usopp tried frantically to defend himself against Jabra, but even his new Kabuto is no match for the CP9 agent's speed. Jabra caught Usopp off guard by offering him the key without a fight, but attacked Usopp at the last moment, knocking him down. With his opponent helpless, Jabra began to gloat at Usopp's weakness, but is cut short by the sudden arrival of Sanji, returned to his normal self by the falling water from Kalifa's bath. He distracted Jabra, and told the wounded Usopp to help any way he can.

   Zoro and Kaku continued their duel, with Kaku using his Devil Fruit power to gain the upper hand, wounding Zoro with a rain of Rankyaku attacks. Zoro stalled Kaku by mocking his voice. Angry now, and experimenting wildly with his transformations, Kaku changed to a more powerful form, which removes his long neck while lengthening his arms and legs. Combined with larger swords he retrieved, Kaku gained the upper hand and mocked Zoro's attempt to rescue Robin.

   This angered Zoro, prompting him to unleash a new mysterious technique,
    Nine Sword Style
    , which made him appear like an Asura deity; three faces plus six arms meant nine swords total. Realizing the danger, Kaku prepared his finishing blow, the powerful Rankyaku attack that sliced the tower in half. Zoro countered with Asura: Ichibugin,
    which was so powerful it negated Kaku's Rankyaku and finally incapacitated the CP9 agent. In the end, Zoro delivers Paulie's message of termination, and the downed Kaku freely gave Zoro his key and even shared a joke with the man who defeated him. At this moment, Sanji catches up to Zoro and learns the last key is now theirs.

   Luffy is unable to hurt Lucci, who hit him with a rapid-fire Shigan. Franky comes to Luffy's aid by trying to hit Lucci with the same
    move
    he used against Fukurou. Franky's move is unsuccessful against Lucci's much-stronger Tekkai, and Lucci prepared to strike Franky. Luffy used his Gear Second ability and knocked Lucci away. Franky was astonished by Luffy's strength and power, and encouraged him to defeat Lucci. Luffy manages to keep the now

   On the bridge, Spandam dragged Robin by a rope, gloating that no one will ever reach her because he set up landmines behind them. He then explained that his father,
    Spandine
    , was the one who led the destruction of Ohara, which infuriated Robin. There is an explosion as Franky triggered the landmines and is blown into the water, and Spandam laughed that no one will save Robin.

   Spandam is suddenly hit in the head by a missile, and the Marines waiting to transport the prisoner are also attacked. Sogeking had fired the shots from the top of the Tower of Justice, a distance that none of the Marines could hit with any weapon and none could see without binoculars.

  <p key="ddf6b8f9-65a9-42d3-bfc8-c0c2449165c4">
   Robin escaped and the Marines fired at her, but Franky jumped in the way to block the bullets (the landmines had only delayed him). Sogeking shot Zoro and Sanji's keys to Franky, leaving him with all of the keys to use on Robin's cuffs (the Number 5 key was the right one). Spandam is shocked that CP9 was defeated. With all the keys in hand, Franky eventually unlocks Robin's Seastone cuffs. Robin thanks Sogeking but he replied that she should save the thanks until later. Sogeking also tells Robin that she is now free to do whatever she wants, and Robin made her decision. Using her
    Devil Fruit abilities
    she attacked Spandam.

   The celebration is cut short when the Buster Call arrived, and the top of the judicial tower is blown up. The defensive fence surrounding Enies Lobby is also destroyed. Franky shouted out that this is their last chance to escape, as there is an escort ship at the end of the bridge. In the tunnels beneath the towers, Nami, Kokoro (carrying Chopper on her head), Chimney and Gonbe continued their escape.

   The battle with Luffy and Lucci raged on. Luffy is able to land an attack on Lucci, who is forced back with pain. Lucci then explained to Luffy that his Gear Second ability is wearing his body away and shortening his life span by pumping blood into his legs, causing his blood-flow to speed up. Luffy yelled back that he does not care and wishes to save his comrades first. So Lucci raised the stakes and used a Rankyaku to smash a wall, causing water to flow into the tower and the tunnel system below; anyone in it (namely any of Luffy's comrades trying to catch up to him) will drown.

   Luffy pleaded with Iceburg to fix the ship up one last time, but Iceburg cannot; he'd already done what he could. As he saw the ship laying on Scrap Heap Island (after having been dumped from Franky's lair by CP9), he too heard
    the voice of the ship
    and decided to grant its request to sail once again; the ship was then carried off by the waves of
    Aqua Laguna
    and sailed off on its own. He declared what he saw before him as a miracle: a ship so loved by its crew that it went beyond its limits to save them one last time; he praised ship and crew for such extraordinary loyalty. Luffy comes to realize what Iceburg is saying and understands what has to be done. After moving to Iceburg's ship, Luffy and the rest of his crew give Merry a viking funeral, setting her ablaze for her final voyage. As the crew lament the funeral of their ship, they each hear the soul of Merry, thanking them for taking good care of her. Though Luffy argued that her damage was their fault, Merry says that she was happy, with her only regret that she could not continue their voyage with them. As the ship starts to burn away, the crew mourn their friend, as Merry once more thanks them for a wonderful life.
