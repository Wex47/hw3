   Bartholomew Kuma
   . To a giant, these large humans are no more than "oversized ants." Large-sized humans at their tallest reach knee-height of a giant, a normal human only reaches as high as the ankle in comparison.
   Edward Newgate
   , a large-sized human, has shown that his entire body is barely taller than the giant
   Ronse
   's head alone. Normal giants are 12 meters tall at minimum, while the tallest known human,
   Charlotte Linlin
   , is only 8.8 meters tall.
   Overall, normal giants tend to hover around 20 meters in height when fully grown, with
   Morley
   currently being the shortest known giant at 12.53 meters tall
   and
   Dorry
   being the tallest known normal giant at 22.6 meters.

   Sanjuan Wolf
   is a notable giant, being even larger than Ancient Giants as he is nearly three times as tall as Oars
   and as big as the
   Marineford
   headquarters building. He is considered to be one of a kind among giants due to his massive size, though this was attributed to a Devil Fruit power he possesses rather than natural growth.

   is a unique tribe of giants whose only known members are
   Oars
   and his descendant,
   Little Oars Jr.
   They are extremely tall even among giants, with Oars and Oars Jr. both reaching 60 meters, or nearly 200 feet, in height, which is three times the height of a typical giant.
   Other distinct features of Ancient Giants include a pair of horns on their heads and sharp teeth; also, while normal giants have the same skin tone as humans, Ancient Giants have uniquely colored skin, with Oars' being red and Oars Jr.'s being green. Overall, these traits give Ancient Giants a resemblance to ogres or
   oni
   . Both Oars and Oars Jr. also wear relatively little clothing, with most of their clothing being rather primitive.

   Giants have a much greater lifespan than all other races, and are able to live for at least three times longer than human beings. Giants age moderately slower than normal in youth and childhood, but seem to slow down thereafter. Hajrudin resembled an older pre-adolescent child at the age of 18; as a giant in his early 80's in the present day, he has full color in his hair and no observabble wrinkling in his skin. Dorry and Brogy, who are almost twice as old as Hajrudin, have greyed but non-white hair and only moderate wrinkles, making them look only slightly older despite the 80 year age gap. Jorul and Jarul are the oldest observed giants, seen at almost three and a half centuries old, and looked like typical old men with heavy wrinkling and white hair. They had also become frail with age, as Jorul died after being thrown to the ground because his body could not sustain such an injury.

   Due to the unparalleled physical might of giants, numerous people and groups have sought after scientific methods to artificially increase one's size to that of a giant. Chief among these seekers is the
   World Government
   , which has spent centuries trying to find a successful gigantification method in order to create an unstoppable army of giant soldiers. However, all of their attempts so far have been considered failures.

   Even
   Vegapunk

   artificial dragons
   , did not succeed at this endeavor. His rival
   Caesar Clown

   One notable group of failed subjects from the World Government's experiments are the
   Numbers

Despite being deemed failures, they appear to possess equivalent size and strength to Ancient Giants, and have lived for decades following the experiment. However, it appears that they possess limited mental capabilities, and many of them have unusually animal-like physical features. Following the experiment, they were purchased by
   Kaidou

   Four Emperors

   Generally, giants seem to get along fine with other races, though many humans think twice about upsetting them. Normally, they seem very casual, lighthearted, and friendly towards just about everyone despite their size. Though a different race, they are still regarded as "men" by humans, noting there is a respectful acceptance between them and humans.
   However, Carmel claimed that they would have formed an army and waged war against the rest of humanity had members of the Giant Warrior Pirates been publicly executed by the
   Marines

  <p key="a5b86622-4f0a-44e7-92b6-158d8f84e101">
   The Elbaf giants have developed a tremendous hatred towards the
   Emperor
   ,
   Charlotte Linlin
   , better known as "Big Mom". Big Mom takes pride in her empire,
   Totto Land
   , as a multi-species utopia where every manner of sentient race co-exist in fair harmony, yet there is not a single giant living in its territories. This stems from Linlin's actions as a 5 year old child: she lived among the orphans of the
   Sheep's House
   on Elbaf, where she was originally accepted by the native giants, with her unnaturally large size on par with theirs made it her first time of feeling she fit in. However, Linlin failed to control her food cravings during the 12-day fast the giants undertake before the
   Winter Solstice Festival
   ,
   devastating the village that half-adopted her and fatally injuring the legendary giant hero
   Jorul
   in a manner disgraceful to a warrior. This fateful event would spread far and wide throughout Elbaf and beyond, resulting in every giant in the world, even those not of Elbaf, to hate Linlin for her actions. This only worsened when she caused the deaths of Carmel and the orphans of Sheep's House, which led the giants to scorn Linlin so much that speaking her name has became a taboo.
   Many years later, Linlin attempted a reconciliation via a political marriage between her 23rd daughter Lola and the giant Prince Loki. The attempt ended in disaster, as Lola fled the marriage and Linlin tried to pass off her twin sister
   Chiffon
   in her place, a failed deception that only deepened the distrust from the giants. Linlin then ultimately gave up on trying to befriend the giants and decided to pursue the
   artificial manufacture of giants
   .
   Despite this, she remains furious over the entire situation to current times, and cannot help but express it whenever the topic is broached, as evidenced when
   Vinsmoke Judge
   mentioned the giants' apparent absence in Totto Land's racial panoply. Publicly, Linlin seems to be in denial, as she swiftly suppressed her anger and told Judge that he might have just missed them.
   Also despite giving up on bridging this gap, Linlin remains attached to the proud nation of giants, going as far as to name one of her attacks

   Carmel has managed to earn immense admiration and respect among the giant community, since she saved the members of the Giant Warrior Pirates from a public execution, and the citizens of Elbaf welcomed her onto their island with open arms.
   In fact, their respect for her was great enough for them to spare Charlotte Linlin's life at Carmel's request despite their new found hatred towards Linlin for her atrocious actions of destroying their village and killing Jorul.
   Although Carmel was simply acting with the Marines in order to sneak into Elbaf in order to sell children, the giants never learned of her true nature.
   In fact, sometime after Carmel and the Sheep's House children moved to another island, one giant was worried about them and went out of his way to check up on them, only to be horrified by the events that caused Carmel and the orphans to disappear. It was Carmel's death that intensified the giants hatred towards Linlin.

   Oars' strength was said to be powerful enough to move continents, and his fearsome reputation drew
   Moria
   to acquire his corpse for zombification, believing that its power would help him become the
   Pirate King
   .
   Big Mom believed that had she managed to gain the allegiance of the giant army of
   Elbaf
   , she would have been able to defeat the other three
   Emperor
   and become the Pirate King herself.
   Saul had lifted up and smashed a number of the large
   Buster Call
   fleet battleships during the destruction of
   Ohara
   . He had been noted to have more strength than an average giant.
   In fact, many giants are servants of the
   World Government
   and the Marines, enforcing the latter as one of the
   Three Great Powers
   . Their overall strength is the primary aspect that the World Government is conducting research on
   Gigantification
   , in the hopes of creating their own giants.
   When Carmel brought on the possibility that
   Elbaf
   might form an army to declare war against the world for execution of their Giant Warrior Pirates members, the Marines released the captives in fear of such a possible event, a fear they did not show even in the advent of
   war
   against the entire
   Whitebeard Pirates

   The Marines have an entire squad consisting of giants, and these giants were placed in charge of guarding Ace's execution platform. When they were ordered to prepare themselves, the pirates advancing took note of the incoming giants and warned each other that "the big-boys are advancing".
   They also have many other giants as high-ranking officers.

   They are often shown surviving being hit by cannon blasts and explosions, which usually simply knocked them down temporary and they come out with only minor injuries. Even when suffering major injuries, they still have some life left in them to fight again. Perhaps due to their size, they also have greater resistance to diseases that would kill humans. At Enies Lobby, when the allies of the Straw Hats appeared to have been wiped out by the Buster Call fleet, whose cannons are able to wipe out whole islands with their cannon blasts, it was revealed that Oimo and Kashii had taken the brunt of the attack, yet they were largely unaffected with no visible injuries.
   Saul had also taken several hits of cannon fire while on Ohara from Buster Call shots, although the ships used in that incident were not as strong as the Enies Lobby incident.
   Oars Jr. had taken many hits by cannon fire before he was initially taken out by the
   Warlords
   Kuma,

   It should be taken into account that when a giant goes on a rampage, there is a general fear from the weakest of men, as very little can stop a giant normally and seemingly even less when one is angry.
   As equal as they make for dangerous guards and enforcers, they likewise make for dangerous criminals and such giants end up in the lower levels of

   Just as large-sized humans have an advantage against "normal" humans, large-sized giants like Oars have a huge advantage against "normal" giants.
   Large-sized humans, even those with great strength, are usually just too weak to take on a giant, as Oimo and Kashii proved to the Kairiki Destroyers.
   Most giants thus far have either been taken down by the strongest of the human fighters or by tactics. In all observed cases, combatting giants has been achieved through a tandem of exploiting their great size, tight teamwork and cooperation, and turning giants against one another. Oimo and Kashii were taken down by the joint efforts of the
   Galley-La
   fighters,
   Zambai
   , and
   Sodom
   and
   Gomorrah
   . While Sodom and Gomorrah had the strength and size almost equal to the giants, the others who aided them had used more tactical efforts such as pinning down Kashii's face when he fell, and using Oimo to deal a knock-out blow to his partner.
   Mr. 3
   had to devise a plan in order to take down
   Brogy
   and
   Dorry
   . While he took down Dorry by using an explosion in his stomach (Brogy had finished him off), the giant had survived.
   During the
   Sabaody Archipelago Arc
   , the kidnapping group known as the
   Coffee Monkeys
   reported that they only captured their giant because he was asleep.

   While all giants are incredibly strong, their sheer size is also their biggest disadvantage. The larger giants such as Oars and Oars Jr. are so big that they make for easy targets during battles.
   Another disadvantage is space, as giants need room to maneuver themselves without damaging buildings or stepping on allies.

   While no giant has demonstrated Haki, at least four giants (John Giant, Saul, Ronse, and Lacroix) have achieved the rank of
   vice admiral
   in the Marines, and some degree of proficiency in Haki is said to be a requirement of that rank. Furthermore,
   Stansen
   , who was chained together with Silvers Rayleigh during his time as a slave in the Human Auction House was able to discern the latter's use of Haki when Rayleigh used it to render Disco unconscious. Therefore, it must be concluded that giants are not only aware but also capable of manifesting Haki.

   Although it is rare among their kind, giants are known to consume and pursue
   Devil Fruits
   for their power, as
   Hajrudin
   once attempted to gain the
   Mera Mera no Mi
   , and
   Jaguar D. Saul
   expressed slight jealously at the thought of Devil Fruit users;
   Sanjuan Wolf
   and
   Morley
   are among the known giants to have eaten Devil Fruits. Interestingly, while Wolf's unique size for a giant (at 180 meters) is attributed to his Devil Fruit power, it did not seemingly hinder his ability to swim in water. For non-giant individuals, a Devil Fruit power is a formidable asset that can be used to even the odds against a typical giant who lacks such a power.

  <p key="61696ebf-75ce-44a1-8946-b3336fe3ac83">
   The majority of giants seen so far believe that to die in battle is a great honor, and that duels are sacred battles between the strong to determine who wins the favor of the Gods of Elbaf. Upon returning to Elbaf after a victorious battle, the winners are treated as heroes. By contrast, Elbaf giants see any other kind of death as a terrible disgrace, and those who inflict such a death upon a giant as evil and criminal. When the veteran warrior Jorul died after being thrashed by his beard by the young Charlotte Linlin, the entire giant race was filled with disgust and spite towards her.
  </p>
  <p key="952e2d95-aae0-4376-b682-796fa9979aae">
   However, not all giants believe that fighting and dying in battle is a great honor. For example, Jaguar D. Saul considers the Elbaf giants' lust for battle "barbaric" while expressing that gentle giant races do indeed exist outside Elbaf, and dislikes it when others believe that all giants are warriors like those of Elbaf. Although not all giants are from Elbaf, and some of such rejecting the battle-oriented beliefs, they nevertheless are able to sympathize with their brethren from Elbaf, as they too came to hate Charlotte Linlin for the unprecedented destruction she brought unto that proud nation, particularly when she killed the elder giant hero,
   Jorul
   ,
   and later causing the deaths of Mother
   Carmel
   and
   Sheep's House
   's orphans,
   leading to their absolute absence in her empire Totto Land.
  </p>
  <p key="6441e454-b9cb-4c65-8361-c3a84a33bc48">
   The Elbaf denizens also believe in offering their thanks to the sun, by fasting for 12 days before a great feast, a tradition known as the
   Winter Solstice Festival
   . Linlin's rampage that ruined the traditional fasting made Jorul declare that she was not fit to pay thanks to the sun.

  <p key="1c8ac3ce-7597-47a3-8fb7-acdee888ad07">
   Due to their exceedingly long lifespan, giants tend to treat time differently to humans. Where spending 50 years on a single mundane task would be a waste of a human lifetime, 50 years is only 1/6 of a giant's typical lifespan. As such, a vow that demands a giant spend decades on a single task can be seen as "nothing" by them.
