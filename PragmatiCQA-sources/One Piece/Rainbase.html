   While a great, continuous drought ravaged most of the
   Arabasta
   Kingdom, Rainbase grew into prosperity, being of the few spots in the country to not be affected by the lack of water. This was in fact all planned by Crocodile, who not only owned the city's biggest
   casino
   , but also happened to be behind Arabasta's prolonged dryness, thanks to strategic use of both the forbidden
   Dance Powder

   stayed behind. Luffy was not able to shake off Smoker though, who pursued all of them into the building. After dispatching the

   cage in Crocodile's secret, private room.

   Vivi attempted to attack Crocodile, but her efforts were futile thanks to the Warlord's
   Logia
   abilities. As the effects of
   Operation Utopia
   started rallying the country further into a civil war, Crocodile left Vivi with a choice to either leave immediately or fight his Bananawani pets, one which had swallowed the key to her friends' cage. He also activated a mechanism to flood the room with water from Rainbase Lake.
  </p>
  <p key="efc701e1-665b-4911-87ee-c5e9b76d1f65">
   Suddenly, a commotion started outside Rain Dinners and Crocodile was contacted by a mysterious figure known as
   <a href="Sanji.html" key="0e938510-5b44-4d33-827c-a706427d40ce" title="Sanji">
    Mr. Prince
   </a>
   , who claimed to be responsible for the tumult going on. With Crocodile and Miss All Sunday leaving the casino to investigate as Chopper baited the Warlord further away, Sanji destroyed the bridge leading to Rain Dinners and then infiltrated the building, meeting up with Vivi, who had escaped the secret room to find help, in the process.
  </p>
  <p key="37119738-857f-4823-821e-dc77eff74a4e">
   Sanji went into the secret room and defeated the right Bananawani, being guided by Smoker's reasoning. Surprisingly enough, the Bananawani that had eaten the key was the same one who had devoured Mr. 3 earlier, who managed to survive digestion through his
   <a href="Doru Doru no Mi.html" key="0f098c4f-7ad9-4d5b-b538-77405cfd63f6" title="Doru Doru no Mi">
    wax powers
   </a>
   . Mr. 3 quickly figured out the situation the Straw Hats were in and got rid of the key (which was fake to begin with). Usopp then pointed out that Mr. 3 could just make a replica of the right key using his wax, doing so after being physically coerced by Sanji. Now freed, the Straw Hats and Smoker escaped the flooded room by swimming up through Rainbase Lake before Crocodile returned.
  </p>
  <p key="a6ce1765-572d-40d7-b3c6-283d7ef478a7">
   The Straw Hats (having been let off by Smoker) advanced to Alubarna while taking a ride on
   Matsuge
   's friend
   Hasami
   , but Crocodile attempted to intercept them by holding onto Vivi with his sand powers. Luffy took Vivi's place and challenged Crocodile at the outskirts of Rainbase, but lost and got impaled by Crocodile's hook after he summoned a sandstorm to hit
   Yuba
   . Crocodile then tossed Luffy into a sand pit he generated with his abilities and departed towards Alubarna. Luffy, however, was rescued by Miss All Sunday, who left the pirate in Pell's care. Once Luffy recovered, Pell transported him to Alubarna as well.

   Sandora River
   . It is unknown if the city is still as active as before without Crocodile's influence.
