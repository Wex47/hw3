While the version initially broadcast on Cartoon Network was edited to the channel's standards, the streaming and home video versions are uncensored and feature both English and Japanese versions.

   Funimation was one of the bidders in the original war over the rights to One Piece, even registering a URL for it (among other anime) despite not owning the rights to the series at the time.
   In December 2003, Funimation dismissed rumors that they had licensed the series but stated that they "[remained] in the top companies still in negotiations" for it.
   They were unsuccessful and, in June 2004,
   <a href="4Kids Entertainment.html" key="9ca47135-5db3-45c5-828e-4fd4ef86a361" title="4Kids Entertainment">
    4Kids Entertainment
   </a>
   announced that they had licensed the series.
  </p>
  <p key="a890a134-6b14-40df-be13-e2ecf8b2e470">
   After producing 104 English-dubbed episodes, cut down from 143 Japanese ones, 4Kids dropped the One Piece license in December 2006.
   On April 12, 2007, Funimation Entertainment announced they had acquired the license to the series and would premier their own English version on Cartoon Network on September 29, 2007, with
   Episode 144
   . Although Funimation's dub would directly follow the 4Kids version for the series' Cartoon Network broadcast, the production team behind the new dub was entirely different. Consequently, Funimation replaced every cast member, used less strict editing than 4Kids and retained the original music (with the Japanese theme music replaced with an English cover of the same song). Funimation's dub was well received for its voice acting, dialogue and music.
  </p>
  <p key="4d927edd-b024-469e-b0a1-376c9b75fe25">
   Episodes would still be edited to meet Cartoon Network's standards; for example, Sanji's cigarette, which 4Kids had re-drawn into a lollipop, was removed entirely. The broadcast version of the dub retained previously-established names and terminology from the 4Kids dub and video games, while the "Uncut" version intended for home video would use more accurate naming; for example, while "Zolo" was used on TV, "Zoro" was used in all other releases of the same episodes. In North America, Funimation's edited dub concluded with
   Episode 167
   in March, 2008; the dub would continue to air in Australia, where it soon switched from edited to uncut versions.
   Episode 195
   , the last episode of the Skypiea Arc, aired January 7, 2009, and has rerun once before being put on hiatus again.
  </p>
  <p key="cf015f8b-208a-4ae0-a38c-964c13fff5f9">
   In May 2008, Funimation released their first uncut DVD of the series, starting from the first episode and catching up to "Season Three", the batch of episodes that they had initially dubbed. In April 2011, the DVD release of Funimation's Season Three was concluded. The release of new dubbed episodes continued in August 2012 with
   Episode 206
   , the beginning of "Season Four", on DVD.

  <p key="30a4e9e3-ec35-452c-852f-278d0addece4">
   One Piece returned to Cartoon Network on May 19, 2013, this time as part of Adult Swim's Toonami block. Adult Swim skipped ahead to
   Episode 207
   , the start of the
   Long Ring Long Land Arc
   , which had been available on DVD for several months. The series aired at 1 AM without edits for content; however, as per Toonami practice, the opening and ending credits were shortened to 30 seconds and the next episode previews were removed. An "Ask Toonami" segment established that most of the intro/outro material the block receives from Funimation and other sources is already cut down for broadcast, and was not their own doing. The series ran on Adult Swim until March 17, 2017, with the airing of
   Episode 384
   (
   Spa Island Arc
   ), and was replaced by Tokyo Ghoul.

   The uncut version of the English dub doesn't use the censored dialogue from the television broadcast and reverts the majority of the 4Kids terms to more accurate transliterations of the Japanese names. No in-episode footage is edited for Funimation's home video and online releases, but
   Mirai Kōkai
   and the animation associated with it are substituted with
   Eternal Pose
   due to licensing issues. For the dub, English covers of the theme music were initially used, but they were unable to continue this practice from
   Episode 207
   due to licensing issues.
  </p>
  <p key="f2a3d79c-2f6e-4a46-80be-04f77117c90b">
   While some of the subtitled versions released online use the unaltered Japanese footage, some minor branding and translation changes are made for the English dub presentation; the Japanese logo is replaced by a gold-colored variant and the credits and episode titles are replaced with English translations. From Episode 361, other captions, such as those introducing characters, were replaced with English versions too. The movies and TV specials swap between Japanese and English credits on a case-by-case basis, with Japanese-language credits generally followed by silent English ones.
  </p>
  <p key="b72659ad-d521-466b-a542-95fb4f0772a3">
   As a consequence of the logo change, any of the logo's animation is recreated and in
   BON VOYAGE!
   a few seconds of footage behind the logo are substituted. The DVDs of the series only use the English credits, but from
   Kokoro no Chizu
   include the original unaltered logo in the "Textless Opening" special feature; for previous texless openings,
   <a href="We Are!.html" key="c4cca56c-5d4f-47f7-a89c-6cd35af83687" title="We Are!">

   and
   Believe
   swap between English and Japanese variants but
   Hikari e
   and
   BON VOYAGE!
   only use the English logo. The English opening credits omit the alternate variations of
   Brand New World
   and
   One Day
   .
  </p>
  <p key="8774f36f-259c-450a-9cc1-f94b529d3274">
   For the first 574 episodes, the English-language credits reference the cast and crew for both languages, although not every credit from the Japanese version is translated. Additional credits covering the Japanese production, such as the theme music, are included from
   Episode 206

   All of Funimation's disc releases contain the uncut English dub and original Japanese audio with translated English subtitles. While the Japanese TV series and specials are mixed in stereo, the English dub was up-mixed to 5.1 for the first 628 episodes. Where applicable, the video track uses the localized English version of the credits.

   Funimation's first DVD release of the franchise was the movie
   Episode of Alabasta
   on February 19, 2008, with a Blu-ray release following on January 27, 2009. Funimation categorized the TV series into "Seasons" which are generally longer than those used for the Japanese DVDs; for example,
   Episode 264
   marks the begging of the Japanese "Season Nine" but the American "Season Four". Each season is divided into "Voyages" containing 10 to 14 episodes over two discs, which retail at $49.98. 'Season One: First Voyage', containing the first 13 episodes, was released on May 27, 2008. In 2011, after releasing the first three seasons, Funimation began releasing 4-disc "Collections" bundling two Voyages in new packaging at an MSRP of $24.99; apart from the labels, the discs themselves are identical to the previous releases.

  <p key="de447550-d67e-449b-9c0d-45dc7ba398f9">
   All movies and TV specials following Movie 8 would be released on DVD and Blu-ray simultaneously, mostly as DVD/Blu-ray 'Combo Packs' without a standalone DVD release. Initially, the series was only released on DVD, despite
   Episode 207
   onward being animated in HD and Japanese Blu-ray releases being available for all episodes from
   575
   . The Voyage and Collection releases changed format to DVD/BD Combo Packs with
   Episode 629
   , the start of "Season Eleven"; because  Collection 26 bundles a DVD-only Voyage and a Combo Pack Voyage, it does not include Blu-ray copies for the first half of its episodes.

  <p key="dc7c4c9a-8864-4eb4-b96a-c5c9364efe0a">
   In addition to the full episodes, the TV series includes a "Marathon Play" option which skips the theme music and previews between episodes. Most Voyages also contain a episodes with audio commentary from the American cast and crew; Season 9 also featured Video Commentaries with picture-in-picture footage of the commentators. From 'Season 4: Voyage 4', Funimation began also including interviews with the English cast in different formats; 'On The Boat: Behind the Scenes of One Piece' features are around 15 minutes long and feature ADR Director
   Mike McFarland
   interviewing a voice actor and discussing their character and overall thoughts on the show. 'One Piece in the Booth' features, which last twenty to thirty minutes, include cast and crew interviews, as well as footage of the English dialogue being recorded. Later features use a similar format and feature multiple voice actors. Additionally, One Piece releases have featured convention panels, outtakes from the English dub and comedy sketches with the American cast.

   Funimation had planned to start simulcasting subbed One Piece episodes an hour after their original broadcast on their official website, starting May 30 with episode 403. On May 29 someone accessed their website and uploaded episode 403 before Funimation had agreed to put it online. As Funimation became aware of this they then shut down the video service and announced that fans will be "deprived" of One Piece for the "immediate future" and that they will also be trying to "locate and prosecute the perpetrators".
   The perpetrator was later caught and charged.

   Funimation's One Piece simulcast is also available on
   from episode 391 onwards, originally with a two day delay from their Japanese airing. Starting from episode 736, the episodes were posted on Hulu on the same day as the original broadcast. Eventually, after years of DVD releases, all the prior episodes were eventually added in as well when the seasons they were grouped in were released. Also available are a regularly changed selection of dubbed episodes. These are identical to the Funimation.com versions, and are all in SD only. Hulu's license with One Piece was set to expire on April 28, 2017.
   However the rights were later re-negotiated, allowing One Piece to remain on Hulu, although Hulu no longer has the rights to the series beyond episode 750 and as such the episodes for the Zou, Marine Rookie, and Whole Cake Island arc were removed. Eventually the series expired from Hulu on April 13, 2020.

   Funimation's announcement of replacing 4Kids as licensee of One Piece was praised by online fans even before its release. While editing and censorship continued for the TV version, Funimation's statements that they would release uncut bilingual DVDs was taken positively by One Piece and anime fans. Funimation's English dub and DVD releases have generally received positively by critics, with many commenting on their uncut approach in comparison to the 4Kids version.
  </p>
  <p key="99cc5621-a9cd-42af-8a86-0cb2749d6bc1">
   Reviews of
   Movie 8
   were positive of the new English cast, with Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk saying that Funimation "[did] a great job of capturing the spirit and personalities of the show's characters".
   Other critics were similarly positive about the cast, although Carl Kimlinger still preferred the Japanese version, awarding the English version a C+ and the Japanese version a B- in his review for Anime News Network.
   Many critics were confused by Funimation's decision to release a continuity-heavy film before the series, and found the story difficult to follow,
   with Kimlinger also conceding that the release made an uncut version of

   Reviews of the TV series and later movie releases were similarly positive,
   and some critics noted the option of a 5.1 mix for the English version.
   Anime News Network would frequently award equal marks for the dubbed and Japanese versions of the series, and commented on the dub's improvement from "Season Four" onward, particularly Sonny Strait's
   Usopp
   and Stephanie Young's
   Robin
   during the
   Water 7 Saga
   .
   Reviewing 'Season Five: Voyage Six', Rebecca Silverman summarized that "dub or sub is really going to come down to the viewer's personal preferences, with strengths and weaknesses on both sides".
   Some critics were impressed with the consistency between the end of "Season Two" and Funimation's earliest dubbed episodes the beginning of "Season Three".
