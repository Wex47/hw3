The team then spotted a blind man being swindled at a roulette wheel by some of the Donquixote Pirates, and Luffy went to expose their deception. The pirates attacked Luffy, but the blind man responded by unleashing a crushing force that sent the pirates plummeting into a hole.
    The blind man then left the restaurant, and Luffy asked who he was, but the man responded that it was better for both their sakes that he doesn't answer.

They interrogated one of the pirates that the blind man had attacked in the alley, but he claimed no knowledge of the Factory's whereabouts. He said the higher-ranking members who knew would be gathered in the Corrida Colosseum today, as a tournament was being held with the Mera Mera no Mi as the prize.

   The duo approached the Colosseum, where they saw the one-legged toy
    Thunder Soldier
    being chased by police. The soldier went into the Colosseum, which authorities were barred from entering, before going to talk to Luffy and Franky. Luffy entered in the Colosseum, where he donned the nickname Lucy. As he mingled with all the other gladiators, he was confronted by a man named
    Spartan
    , who thought he was a weakling and tried forcing him out. However, Luffy responded by flipping Spartan over and defeating him.
    The authorities nearly expelled Luffy afterwards, but
    Sai
    ,
    Boo
    , and Don
    Chinjao
    of the
    Chinjao Family
    intervened, explaining that Luffy was acting in self-defense. Luffy then went to try on some armor, but put on too much, and as he took it off he met the pirate
    Cavendish
    . Luffy nearly revealed his real name to Cavendish, who revealed that he held a grudge against the members of the
    Worst Generation
    for stealing his fame. Luffy then looked at a statue of a gladiator named
    Kyros
    , and the gladiator

    Rebecca

   revealed that Kyros had supposedly gone 3000 battles without being defeated, although no one knew who he was. She revealed that she intended to win the Mera Mera no Mi and take down Doflamingo, and having taken a liking to Luffy, she wished for them to meet in the second round. Right then, the A Block battle finished after having just started, and the winner took off the paper bag on his head to reveal that he was
    Jesus Burgess
    .

   After the A Block battle, Franky went to continue the mission to locate the SMILE Factory, and Thunder Soldier tagged along with him. The blind man also departed from the Colosseum, and was revealed to be the Marine Admiral Fujitora. Fujitora prepared to go to Green Bit, and also wanted to look into the amount of people on Dressrosa in case any innocents were injured. Inside the Colosseum, an undercover Marine listed the wanted pirates present to Vice Admiral
    Maynard
    , who was undercover as the contestant "Capman". Maynard was then approached by
    Gambia
    of the
    Barto Club
    , and easily took down the pirate. As the B Block battle was about to begin, however, Gambia's captain Bartolomeo defeated Maynard as he headed for the arena.

  <p key="c6fe1b07-6723-4a9c-9c01-edcdcfbea3b0">
   Bartolomeo was greeted with boos from the crowd, but also in B Block was the popular

As Bellamy headed to the arena, he first approached Luffy, having recognized him. Bellamy said that his goal was to join Doflamingo and that he no longer had enmity toward Luffy before walking away. The B Block battle then began, and the strategist
    Dagama
    formed an alliance to protect
    Elizabello II
    , the king of the
    Prodence Kingdom
    .
    As he was protected, Elizabello warmed up his "King Punch", a punch strong enough to blast through a fortress.

  <p key="85a9a136-d7e2-4edb-8163-82e14978e72c">
   Bellamy took on

    Fish-Man
    Hack

    Longleg

    Ricky
    emerged as strong contenders as well. One man in the audience found Ricky's fighting style to be familiar, and as the fighting raged on and gladiators were sent falling into fighting-fish infested waters, Bartolomeo lay on the edge of the ring, relaxed. As Luffy and Cavendish watched the battle, Chinjao suddenly came up to them, exposing Luffy's real identity as he revealed that he had a grudge against

    Cavendish wished to kill Luffy as well, and the three got into a brief scuffle before Sai and Boo stopped their grandfather to prevent his disqualification. Cavendish wanted to continue attacking Luffy, but Luffy hid by hanging off a ledge.

  <p key="4d5654cb-556b-47e5-b768-0cecc700feac">
   The number of fighters in B Block went down to 30 as some top fighters began to fall. In the midst of this, Bartolomeo urinated off the side of the arena, and was confronted by Hack. However, Hack broke his hand on a mysterious force and fell to the ground, defeated.
    Dagama and Blue Gilly then broke the formation around Elizabello as they betrayed the people in it, but Blue Gilly took down Dagama as well. Bellamy was struggling against Bartolomeo when Elizabello prepared to unleash his King Punch, and he threw it, unleashing a monstrous force that annihilated the entire arena. As the dust settled, only Bartolomeo remained, having created a barrier to block the punch with the
    Bari Bari no Mi
    . Bartolomeo then crashed his barrier into Elizabello, defeating him and winning B Block.
    Afterwards, Bellamy talked with Luffy while he was being carried away on a stretcher, and Bartolomeo overheard Bellamy saying Luffy's name.

   In a northeastern cafe, the Caesar Return Team looked at the bridge to Green Bit; even though it was made of iron, the waters nearby were surrounded by fighting fish and no one who had gone across the bridge recently had ever returned. Law planned to head to Green Bit regardless, and expressed concern about the peaceful climate around the island when Robin suddenly noticed agents of

    The team then ventured across the bridge, with Usopp, Robin, and Caesar defending against the fighting fish while Law saved his energy for the return journey. They then came to a chasm in the bridge, where they saw a fighting fish being caught in a net by an unseen group of people. They forced Caesar to fly them the rest of the way to Green Bit, and once they reached it, they noticed a Marine ship that crashed into the island. Law had Robin and Usopp scout out the island's heavy forestation while he prepared to hand over Caesar to Doflamingo.

   Sanji caught up to Zoro as he was chasing the fairy, when he noticed a beautiful woman named
    Violet
    dancing onstage. Zoro ran off while he was distracted, and as Sanji looked around, Violet suddenly came up to him and asked him to hold her. She kissed him as the police raced by looking for her, and Sanji was overcome with passion. Violet said that she was being chased for stabbing a man, and asked Sanji to accompany her to the next town and also to help her kill a man.
    As they traveled, a sniper tried to shoot them, but Sanji flew up and defeated him.
    However, Violet later attacked Sanji as she revealed herself to be an assassin for the Donquixote Pirates. She prepared to look into Sanji's mind to find out the Straw Hats' purpose on Dressrosa, but was repulsed by his lecherous thoughts. Sanji stated that he knew Violet was telling the truth when she asked him to kill a man for her, believing that she did not really want to be with Doflamingo. Taken aback, Violet took down her crewmates with whale-shaped tears before telling Sanji to run. By letting him glimpse into her mind, she revealed that Doflamingo never resigned from the Warlord title or abdicated his throne, which CP0 had revealed to the citizens earlier. She told him to get his crew off the island, and Sanji contacted Law about Doflamingo's deception. However, it was too late, as Doflamingo and a group of Marines led by Fujitora confronted Law on the coast of Green Bit.

   Inside the Green Bit forest, Robin and Usopp overheard an exchange between a group of Marines and an unseen people. The Marines refused to hand over their weapons, and were stripped. Robin then caught one of the people with her hands, realizing they were most likely dwarves.
    She saw the dwarf she caught,
    Kabu

    They were split up, and when Usopp woke up, he claimed to be a descendant of

    Law refused to hand over Caesar, and Fujitora asked him about the Straw Hats. Law could keep his Warlord status if they were his subordinates, but he stated that they were allies, causing Fujitora to revoke his status and send a meteor falling on him. Law, Doflamingo, and Fujitora protected themselves from the meteor, destroying the ground around them except their footholds as they prepared to battle.

    The fairy was actually
    Wicca

She revealed that she had seen the Donquixote Pirates go to attack the Sunny, and Zoro initially raced toward the Sunny, but with no ability to get there, he was forced to go along with Wicca to the Flower Field. As he ran, he discovered that Doflamingo's crew had been keeping tabs on them the entire time.

    The duo ran out of the Colosseum, and Rebecca spotted them as she yelled out to Thunder Soldier, saying she would win and that they would live together afterwards.
    As the C Block battle began in the Colosseum,
    Franky contacted Sanji about their status. Sanji saw Luffy fighting in the Colosseum, and Violet gave him a map to the SMILE Factory as her subordinates approached them, before running off and agreeing to reunite at the western port. Kin'emon then reunited with Sanji, asking him to take down the Donquixote Pirates pursuing him. Sanji did so, and Kin'emon asked him to accompany him to the Toy House where Kanjuro was being held; as mentioned by Violet, the Factory was located behind the Toy House.
    Sanji decided to wait, as Marines were crawling around the Colosseum. Led by Vice Admiral
    Bastille

Since he had no money, Rebecca bought lunch for Luffy and took him to the gladiators' cell to hide. As they sat, Luffy was suddenly grabbed by the gladiators inside the cell, and Rebecca attacked him. Luffy overpowered her, but forgave her because she bought him food. He met the convict gladiators inside the cell, who were forced to fight 1000 Colosseum battles for standing up against Doflamingo. The fights had become more brutal and violent since Doflamingo took power, and as the Thunder Soldier aimed to take down Doflamingo, Rebecca wished to win the tournament and take down Doflamingo to protect the toy after he had protected her for so long.

The Soldier brought Rebecca's mother to her and offered to protect her. Despite Rebecca initially refusing, the Soldier stayed by her side as she grew up, getting a house for her and even becoming wanted when saving her from being sold into slavery. He also taught her how to fight, and Rebecca now wished to repay him as she entered the ring to the sound of booing from the crowd, who hated her for being descended from the former king

    On the Sunny, Brook acted like he was on Giolla's side as the ship went to Green Bit, and Giolla put the others in a mural to suffocate them. However, when Brook got Giolla to restore his cane and violin, he defeated her in one cut and freed his crewmates.

Law heard Nami striking Giolla with a thunderbolt, and revealed to Doflamingo that the heart he had was not Caesar's. In this confusion, Law teleported himself away, grabbed Caesar, and ran toward the bridge to Dressrosa. Seeing the Sunny, he planned to throw Caesar there from the bridge and keep Doflamingo distracted while the Straw Hats escaped. However, the Sunny team cried out as they came under attack by fighting fish, and Doflamingo noticed them as he flew toward the Sunny.

The Sunny then came under attack by both Doflamingo and a floating Marine battleship commanded by Fujitora, who threw a meteor at the Sunny. Law redirected the meteor back at the battleship, and Sanji noted that he seemed to be giving Doflamingo an unusual amount of attention when their main goal was just to destroy the SMILE Factory. Law turned his attention to Doflamingo and told the Straw Hats to go where there were no clouds, as Doflamingo could not fly there with his

    Law let Giolla run off as he and Doflamingo started fighting again, and on Dressrosa, Violet headed for the palace.

    10 billion. Rather than fight, Doldo decided to try collecting the money, although Doflamingo did not allow him to reveal his presence. The Royal Army went out to collect money from the citizens, and out of faith in their king, they gave all they had. However, Doflamingo took control of Doldo and some soldiers and forced them to attack their subjects, leaving them aghast at their king betraying their trust.
    Meanwhile, Monet let the Donquixote Pirates into the palace, and they captured the princess Viola. As Doldo continued attacking his people, Doflamingo, Trebol, Pica, and Diamante came in and stopped him, as well as taking down the royal army. They claimed to be the saviors of Dressrosa, and were welcomed by the people. Doldo survived due to Viola promising to serve Doflamingo in exchange, and she took the name Violet. Some of the army, such as Tank Lepanto, joined Doflamingo.

Franky told everyone about the dwarves' plan, saying he could not leave them to lose against Doflamingo, and so Sanji decided to turn the Sunny team back to help the crew take down the Warlord of the Sea. At the coast, Fujitora headed for the town after hearing about a fight happening there. A ruckus rose near the Colosseum as Doflamingo and Law came into the town, with Doflamingo having overpowered Law. Doflamingo then shot Law three times with a gun, defeating him.
    Zoro and Kin'emon charged at Doflamingo, but Zoro was met by Fujitora, who sent him falling into a hole.

   Some of the Donquixote Pirates went up to confront Franky, and Thunder Soldier and Kabu sneaked into the lift they were on before the former attacked them with his sheer speed.
    However, Lao G was on the lift as well, and overpowered both the Soldier and Kabu.
    He beat up Thunder Soldier the rest of the ride, and Kabu then led some dwarves to take on Lao G while he and Rampo took the Soldier to the throne room.
    However, they were confronted by Gladius, who used the
    Pamu Pamu no Mi
    to rupture his forearms and injure the dwarves in the explosions. He then grabbed the Soldier and was about to rupture him before being attacked by Luffy, and Luffy and Viola took the Soldier away. Gladius attacked them with shrapnel, and Luffy burst out the window and pulled the three of them to the second floor. Gladius then encountered Kin'emon disguised as Doflamingo, and Kin'emon discovered that Kanjuro had escaped from the scrap heap in the Toy House. Luffy, Viola, and Thunder Soldier hid underneath the window of the throne room, where they heard Doflamingo interrogating Law about the Straw Hats' actions with the Tontatta.

   Thunder Soldier remembered his past life as the legendary gladiator Kyros. As a boy, he was a violent criminal who grew up in the slums, but King Riku gave him the opportunity to fight in the Colosseum for his freedom. Kyros stayed in the Colosseum and won thousands of matches without being defeated, even taking down fighters who came from afar. However, he was depressed that he would forever be seen as a killer.
    After defeating Doldo himself in his 3000th match, Doldo made Kyros commander of his army. As commander, Kyros saved the princess
    Scarlett
    , Viola's older sister, from a pirate crew. She fell in love with him afterwards, having her death staged so she could live with him. The two had Rebecca, but Kyros refused to touch her with his blood-stained hands. When Doflamingo took over Dressrosa, Kyros went to the royal palace to rescue King Riku, where Seastone chains were wrapped around his leg. He cut his leg off to attack Doflamingo, but was turned into a toy by Sugar. He managed to escape with Doldo, but was left with no one remembering him as he watched his wife die and raised Rebecca as the Thunder Soldier. Back in the present, Gladius' group approached the Soldier, Luffy, and Viola.

   In the port, Robin and Usopp watched as Sugar turned Cavendish into a toy and forced him to work with the other gladiators in the port, and Leo unveiled the
    Tatababasco
    , the hottest spice in the world, which they planned to hide among Sugar's grapes in order to knock her out. Leo then went up to Sugar with the Tatababasco,
    but when Robin saw Trebol hit a fly with a fast and precise mucus shot, she held Leo back, saying that even he would have been caught by Trebol. As the Tontattas' comrades were being forced to work in the SMILE Factory under the lie that they were finding a cure for Mansherry, Robin went up to Trebol, claiming that there was a problem with a crew at the port in order to lead him away from the tower. When Trebol was gone, the dwarves confronted Sugar and prepared to forcibly knock her out, but Sugar turned all of the attacking dwarves into toy bears, forcing them to attack their comrades who no longer remembered them. She then told Trebol that she was under attack, and after briefly checking on Robin's problem, Trebol attacked Robin and tried trapping her in mucus with the
    Beta Beta no Mi
    , although found out that the Robin who went with him was a clone. He then responded to Sugar's distress by throwing a ship at the Executive Tower.

   Trebol caught the Tontattas and learned about their plan, and he attacked them by lighting the mucus they were stuck to. Usopp went to Leo and told him to run away, but Leo replied that the Soldier would definitely defeat Doflamingo if they accomplished this. He had faith in the Soldier, as he was the only toy not under Sugar's contract and was formerly the legendary Kyros.
    However, the dwarves were decimated by Trebol and Robin was turned into a toy by Sugar after trying to attack her, and Usopp decided to run away rather than confront the Donquixote Pirates alone.
    However, he overheard the dwarves calling out his name as they told Trebol that he would come to rescue them, and Trebol mocked them as he started stepping on them. Usopp came back, confessing to the dwarves his true identity and saying he was no hero, but would become this now as he shot Trebol with a
    Pop Green
    shuriken.
    After a brief battle, Usopp was defeated, and Sugar decided to torture him by feeding him the Tatababasco. However, the Tatababasco caused Usopp to make a terrible expression which frightened Sugar so much that she fell unconscious.

   With Sugar knocked out, the toys around Dressrosa returned to their human forms, and the people's memories of the toys returned, causing Dressrosa to fall into chaos. In the underground port, the dwarves celebrated Usopp's actions, and in the palace, Thunder Soldier transformed back into Kyros. In the Colosseum as chaos erupted in the audience, Rebecca remembered that she had a father as Sabo decided to end the match, using
    Ryusoken

Hajrudin grabbed Usopp and held him up before the other freed toys, who rejoiced in their savior as the ceiling gave in and the Colosseum fighters fell in. Diamante found himself under attack by the freed toys, while Rebecca and Bartolomeo discovered Sabo's true identity as Sabo reunited with Koala and Hack. They revealed that they had come to find and stop Doflamingo's Underworld weapons trade for the Revolutionary Army.
    Diamante and Trebol worked together to stop the freed toys from attacking the SMILE Factory, and Robin reunited with the Revolutionaries as Kin'emon escaped down to the underground port and reunited with his allies.

   In the palace, Pica abandoned his fight with Zoro. In the throne room, after returning to his human form, Kyros charged at Doflamingo as Doldo and Viola regained their memories of him. Kyros then decapitated Doflamingo as Luffy raced in to rescue Law.
    As Kyros took out several of Doflamingo's men including
    Buffalo
    and freed Doldo, Luffy worked to free Law from his Seastone handcuffs. However, Pica then arrived, and Doflamingo was revealed to still be alive as he stated that he would have to use the "Birdcage".
    As Kyros attacked him, the real Doflamingo swooped in to kill him, but Luffy pulled him out of harm's way. Luffy fought the two Doflamingos but was overpowered, with the decapitated Doflamingo being revealed to be a string clone. On Doflamingo's command, Pica forced Luffy, Law, Kyros, Viola, and Doldo outside as Doflamingo's string clone transformed into a cage of strings that surrounded the entire island.

   With the Birdcage surrounding the island, no one could get out, communications to the outside world were cut off, and Doflamingo took control of some people and caused them to attack others, making the citizens realize that Doflamingo framed King Riku and that they have been manipulated for an entire decade. Pica then changed the layout of the island, placing the palace on top of Flower Hill and bringing the SMILE Factory above ground. Doflamingo then proclaimed to his citizens that he had a "game" for them. They could either kill him, or bring in his enemies for a monetary reward.
    He put bounties on the Straw Hats, Law, Kin'emon, Kyros, Doldo, Viola, Rebecca, and Sabo, with Usopp's being the highest at
    500,000,000. The freed toys that had just paid gratitude to Usopp immediately began chasing him and his comrades, and Kin'emon leaped into the scrap heap to find Kanjuro. Usopp's group went up to the surface and contacted Luffy's group, who was on the King's Plateau where the palace once was. Kyros had already left to go after Doflamingo, and Luffy promised to Rebecca to take down Doflamingo. Law warned that this would bring down

   The Marines worked to protect the people of Dressrosa as the freed gladiators emerged from below the Colosseum, including Maynard. Maynard reported to Fujitora about Doflamingo's illegal dealings, but Fujitora questioned the World Government's role in dealing with this. On top of the palace, the Donquixote Pirates met to discuss their situation, with Doflamingo being confident that they would dispose of everyone in their way. Pica offered to dispose of them himself, and one of the pirates laughed, causing him to be shot by Baby 5 before Pica could become enraged. Doflamingo warned his lower-ranking crew to not make fun of the officers, whom he considered his family. Afterwards, Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger returned to the place where they fought Franky, only to find out he escaped. As Franky ran discreetly toward the SMILE Factory, Luffy, Zoro, and Law landed in front of the three Donquixote officers. Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger were joined by some citizens as they attacked Luffy, Zoro, and Law, but the latter three managed to avoid the attacks and ran off, though only to be confronted by Fujitora. Zoro briefly clashed with the Admiral, but they were soon interrupted by Pica, who had become a massive stone behemoth.

   Luffy laughed profusely at Pica's voice, causing the executive to punch him with his massive stone fist. The punch shook the ground and sent Luffy, Zoro, and Law flying all the way to the Colosseum. There, they encountered Cavendish, who had put aside his hatred of Luffy and wanted to defeat Doflamingo. Cavendish was soon joined by the Chinjao Family, Hajrudin, Elizabello, Dagama, Abdullah, Jeet, Orlumbus, Ideo, Suleiman, and Blue Gilly, and they all wanted to take down Doflamingo themselves, causing an argument to break out. However, when some other gladiators came to capture Luffy, Zoro, and Law, the group quickly came together to beat them off. Luffy then reunited with Ucy, and led the charge to the palace despite everyone continuing to argue over Doflamingo. Pica and his subordinates saw them coming, and Pica tried attacking them again, only to have his stone arm shattered by Chinjao and Elizabello.

Pica prepared to attack them, but Luffy shattered his head with a Gear Third punch. Pica's real body then emerged in front of the bull riders and he tried attacking them with a giant sword, but Luffy helped Ucy dodge it and Zoro confronted Pica, allowing the others to continue toward Doflamingo. Since Pica's stone body was no longer inhabited, the other gladiators went after Luffy, and as they drew closer to the palace, Law revealed to Luffy that he wanted to take down Doflamingo to avenge an important person to him called

    They managed to get to safety on the King's Plateau, where they encountered Doldo, Viola, and Tank Lepanto. Viola revealed that she had the key to Law's Seastone handcuffs, and Doldo was initially wary about trusting pirates to help them, but Viola assured him that Luffy's intentions were genuine.

    Sabo overwhelmed the Marines as he destroyed their weapons by flexing his fingers, and he did the same to Bastille's sword and mask, defeating the Vice Admiral. Fujitora brought down a meteor, but it was sliced and scattered by the Birdcage. Sabo revealed his relationship to Luffy, and he and Fujitora clashed.

He had Law brought to him, and Law thought Corazon had told Doflamingo what had happened, but Doflamingo instead told Law that he was becoming an official member of the Donquixote Pirates. Later, Corazon lied to Doflamingo that an enemy had wounded him, which surprised Law. A year passed, and the Donquixote Pirates moved around the North Blue as Law grew stronger through training and raids. One day, he was talking to Buffalo and Baby 5, and revealed that his real name was Trafalgar D. Water Law. Corazon then came and dragged him into an alley, where he spoke to Law and told him that if he was a

   , he needed to get away from Doflamingo.
    He used his
    Nagi Nagi no Mi
    abilities to prevent people from overhearing them, and revealed to Law that much of his personality was an act, and that he had joined the Donquixote Pirates to stop Doflamingo. He believed his older brother had always been evil, as when they had been lynched by the mob as children, Doflamingo refused to die and swore revenge on the commoners. He then revealed that the carriers of D. were rumored to be the "natural enemies of God", and so did not want Law to become like Doflamingo. Law rejected this as he wanted to kill people like Doflamingo did, and he ran off to reveal Corazon's secret. However, as Corazon walked to the ship while the crew prepared to set sail, Law revealed that he kept his secret in order to repay him for not telling Doflamingo about getting attacked. As the crew was being pursued by Marines, Corazon took Law and departed to find a cure for his illness.

   Law did not want to leave, and Corazon contacted

   . Corazon was confident that they would get Law cured at a hospital, but at each one they went to, the doctors refused to go near Law and called the government to get him, causing Corazon to attack all of them as Law fell into despair. Six months passed with no luck, and one night as Law slept, Corazon wept over his condition, and Law overheard this, causing him to gain a respect for Corazon. The next morning, Doflamingo called Corazon,
    revealing that he had found out about a pirate crew selling the Ope Ope no Mi to the World Government, and telling his brother and Law to come back to the crew so they could get the fruit and heal Law with it. After the call, Corazon revealed that he would get the fruit for Law behind the crew's backs before abandoning them, as he did not think he could rejoin the crew without Doflamingo finding out the truth about him. Meanwhile, Doflamingo was growing suspicious that the Marines had not found his crew during the time that Corazon had been gone. Corazon contacted Sengoku, and they arranged a plan to trap the Donquixote Pirates on
    Swallow Island
    during the planned exchange three weeks from now. To Corazon's horror, however, Law grew very weak as his time was almost up.

  <p key="f8eb19f1-0421-4bb7-ae0b-7206164f0f39">
   Corazon and Law sailed to
    Minion Island
    , where the keepers of the Ope Ope no Mi, the
    Barrels Pirates
    , were hiding out. Corazon left Law in the town as he raided the pirates' hideout, attacking them without making a sound and stealing the fruit. However, he tripped and fell as he ran outside and landed in front of some of the pirates, who realized that he had stolen the fruit.
    Corazon defeated them, but sustained several shot wounds in the process. He returned to Law and fed him the fruit, but was too weak to go any further. He asked Law to look for a Marine spy ship and give them a letter, which he claimed would help protect Dressrosa. Law found Vergo near the ship and gave him the letter, but then asked him to come and help Corazon. When Vergo came to Corazon, the two recognized each other in shock, and Vergo realized Corazon's treachery as he beat him and Law up. He then contacted Doflamingo to reveal the truth about Corazon, and Corazon managed to escape with Law, but Doflamingo trapped them by creating a Birdcage around Minion Island.

  <p key="98b8229c-fb86-44ab-85f7-3165aaeedf63">
   Corazon remembered when Doflamingo killed their father when they were children for bringing them out of Mary Geoise, and he hid Law in a treasure chest, assuring that he himself would not be killed by Doflamingo as he silenced Law. The Donquixote Pirates massacred the Barrels Pirates as they searched for Corazon, and after finding him, they beat him up before Doflamingo confronted him. Corazon pulled a gun on Doflamingo, saying he could not let Law follow in his brother's footsteps. Corazon could not pull the trigger, but Doflamingo did, and he believed Law had been taken in by the Marines. This allowed Law to escape, and Corazon stayed alive just long enough to keep Law's cries from being heard, but then succumbed to his wounds.

  <p key="bef628f3-8dfc-4192-b13e-f3c6e2259cca">
   In the present, Law revealed that he was a D. to Doflamingo as they fought, which shocked the Warlord. He then used his Devil Fruit to pierce through Doflamingo, saying that unlike Corazon, he would pull the trigger.
    Law went on the offensive, but Doflamingo quickly stopped his attacks, saying that Law was foolish to confront him alone and that everything he and Corazon aimed for would be for naught. He then sliced Law's right arm off and prepared to shoot him, but was interrupted as Luffy sent his string clone through the floor from below, defeating it. Bellamy was still under Doflamingo's control, and Doflamingo decided to free him. Luffy thought their fight was over, but as he remembered the time he began sailing under the Donquixote Pirates' flag out of admiration for them, Bellamy used Spring Hopper to fight Luffy, knowing that Doflamingo had rejected him but still being too proud to go against the man he admired.
    Luffy told him to stop, but Bellamy did not as he punched Luffy with a Haki-clad fist, injuring him.

However, Orlumbus arrived and defeated them by bowling one into the others, and Zoro raced toward Pica as he inhabited the entire Plateau and attacked. The gladiators and the Donquixote officers were caught up in the attacks, and as this happened, Machvise was greatly overwhelming Hajrudin by pounding him with his increased weight. However, as Machvise prepared to finish him off, Hajrudin countered him with his fist.

   As Sai fought Baby 5, the latter grew flustered as she interpreted Sai's statements to be flirtatious.

An appalled Sai tried to stop her, and Chinjao got annoyed at Sai trying to keep an enemy alive as he attacked the both of them. Sai responded by kicking Chinjao's drill head and bending it sideways, and an impressed Chinjao made him the next Don of the Happo Navy. Right then, however, Lao G arrived and defeated Chinjao, and as the Donquixote officer charged toward Sai, the new Don stated that if he won, he would marry Baby 5 and free her from the Donquixote Pirates' manipulation. He then used Hasshoken to kick Lao G in the head and send him flying far away into the plateau wall, defeating him.

   When Pica came to the Plateau and attacked, Ideo was able to land a hit on Dellinger,
    but was soon overpowered. On the third level, Bartolomeo shielded himself and Cavendish as Gladius made the ground rupture, and Robin went up to the Flower Field to help Rebecca. Bartolomeo protected her from Gladius' attacks before he and Cavendish both went on the offensive, and as this happened, Gladius saw Dellinger and told him to help. However, Ideo pressed his attack on Dellinger, and the fighting fish

   Bartolomeo and Gladius were left in shock, but Hakuba then turned his attention to Robin. She managed to hold him back, and Cavendish struggled to regain control of his body, but Gladius then prepared to blow up the wall they were climbing on. Bartolomeo went to attack him, but Gladius swelled himself up as well, threatening to pierce everyone with poisonous needles if Bartolomeo attacked. With the plateau wall threatening Robin, Bartolomeo created a barrier around himself and Gladius, attacking the officer as he took the full force of Gladius' explosion. However, as Gladius recovered, he revealed that Bartolomeo had missed his throat and prepared to blow up Robin and Cavendish. With no time left, Cavendish briefly gave control to Hakuba, allowing him to carry Robin up the wall with sheer speed right before Gladius blew it up, and he fell asleep as Robin reached the Flower Field. Gladius noticed that they had escaped, and as he was distracted, Bartolomeo hit him with a barrier-enforced punch, defeating him.

   Some Donquixote soldiers then came to take Gladius away, and Viola reported to Leo that she had seen Giolla using Mansherry to heal the fallen Donquixote Pirates, including the officers, in the first floor of the palace. Leo and Kabu were urged to hurry, and Giolla discovered that she could use Mansherry's
    Chiyu Chiyu no Mi
    powers to heal her fallen comrades by just forcing her tears to land on them. Leo and Kabu then came in right as Mansherry's tears were beaten out of her. Kabu moved the Donquixote Pirates out of the tears' path, and Leo stitched them and Giolla together, pulling them all onto her and defeating her. He rescued Mansherry,
    and on her request, carried her out of the palace. Giolla tried to report this to Doflamingo, as Mansherry was also their contingency to repair the SMILE Factory, but was unable to do so.

Russian said she hated pirates, and Pink had claimed to be a banker. They got married and had Gimlet, but when Pink was voyaging with his crew, Gimlet died of a fever and Russian discovered his lie. She left him, but was caught in a landslide and put in a vegetative state. Senor Pink found that he could make Russian smile by wearing Gimlet's bonnet and pacifier, and so adopted this style of dress. In the present, Franky hoped Pink could tell him about Russian someday in the future,

Meanwhile, Pica went up to the Flower Field to confront Kyros, and he asked the gladiator about his thoughts on King Riku. Kyros replied that everyone on Dressrosa wanted him to return to the throne once Doflamingo was taken down, and Pica went down to attack the injured gladiators. As Zoro went after him, Pica told him that he was going to assert Doflamingo's rule by killing Doldo and everyone on the King's Plateau. He then reinhabited his giant golem and walked to the King's Plateau, and Zoro had to quickly think of a plan to catch up to him as cannon fire failed to harm the stone man.

Law then spoke secretly to Luffy, having created a giant ROOM around the palace before Doflamingo shot at him and switched places with a Donquixote servant below. Law told Luffy the plan, and as Luffy charged toward Doflamingo, Law switched places with him and hit Doflamingo with an attack that ruptured his internal organs. Luffy kept Doflamingo and Trebol from retaliating, and Law tried to finish off Doflamingo.

After a ferocious fight, Trebol managed to catch Luffy in his mucus, and Luffy could not escape. Trebol then trapped Law and left him for Doflamingo to finish off, telling Law that the executives and Doflamingo had created a strong family.

   Luffy grew round and constantly bounced in his new form, and Doflamingo did not take it seriously until Luffy hit him all the way into the town below. Doflamingo initially struggled to keep up with Luffy's speed and strength, getting sent flying through buildings and not being able to dodge.
    However, he eventually managed to counter Luffy by turning buildings into string with his awakened Devil Fruit powers and blocking the Straw Hat's attacks. During this time, Burgess went to the palace roof with Koala on his tail, and she wondered what he wanted with Luffy. Time passed, and the Birdcage grew considerably smaller, with the sick and weak being greatly threatened by it. King Riku then broadcasted himself to the citizens, telling them that the Donquixote Pirates were almost vanquished and encouraging them to keep going while Luffy fought Doflamingo. This gave the citizens strength and the will to help the weak, and up in the air, Luffy managed to break through Doflamingo's strings as he hit the Warlord of the Sea into the Palace Plateau wall.
    Doflamingo seemed defeated, but Luffy realized that he was still conscious due to the Birdcage remaining up. He went to deal a final blow, but Gear Fourth expired before he could, leaving him weak and barely able to move.

Gatz then called in the Colosseum gladiators who had initially gone after Luffy and his comrades for Doflamingo's bounties, and they went to confront Doflamingo while Gatz carried Luffy away. They were attacked by Burgess, but the Blackbeard Pirate was intercepted by Sabo.
    Sabo revealed his new Devil Fruit powers to Burgess and Luffy, and Burgess attacked, but Sabo sent him flying. However, Gatz saw Doflamingo easily take down the gladiators, and the Warlord sped up the Birdcage so it would kill everyone before Luffy recovered.

Meanwhile, Mansherry healed the gladiators on the Palace Plateau with dandelions made from her tears before flying on Kabu and scattering the dandelions all across Dressrosa, although they only healed people temporarily. The dandelions allowed the injured citizens to run from the Birdcage,
    and they went to the Palace Plateau for safety. The remaining lower-ranking Donquixote Pirates had taken over the Plateau and blocked their access, but they were beaten away by Kyros and the gladiators. Sai then told the citizens that could still fight to come with him,

    Doflamingo easily countered Viola's attacks before immobilizing her, and he then took control of Rebecca as he forced her to charge at her aunt and kill her. As the people of Dressrosa continued slowing the Birdcage, Gatz announced to them that Luffy would return soon and defeat Doflamingo in one blow. He led them in a countdown, and although Doflamingo attacked him before it was done, and Mansherry's dandelions began to wear off, the crowd cheered as Luffy's recovery period ended. Right before Rebecca was about to kill Viola, Law switched Luffy and Viola, and Luffy broke Rebecca's blade with his Haki as he confronted Doflamingo again.

   The Straw Hats, Law, and Bellamy went to stay at Kyros' house as night fell, and Sabo arrived while Luffy was sleeping. He recounted his past to Zoro, Robin, and Franky, revealing that he had survived after setting sail from
    Dawn Island
    and having his ship blown up by a World Noble. Dragon had rescued him, and he awoke with no memories of his past. He asked to join the Revolutionary Army, and it was only two years ago when he heard the news about Ace's death that he regained his memories. He despaired over Ace, and so when he reunited with Luffy in the Corrida Colosseum, he thanked his brother for staying alive. Sabo then departed from the house, giving the Straw Hats a Vivre Card he made for Luffy after taking a corner of it for himself. He headed toward the Revolutionaries' ship on a flock of crows as the Revolutionaries prepared to depart from the island before CP0's impending arrival.
    Meanwhile, as the other people in Dressrosa rested in the palace, Doldo spoke to Rebecca, telling her that once he became king again, she would become the crown princess.

   The next day, Sanji's group on the Sunny had reached a mysterious island. As Sanji and Chopper forced Caesar to help an unknown group of people, Nami, Brook, and Momonosuke were chasing a girl. They were confronted by two pirates who were also looking for the girl, but they were suddenly interrupted as an eruption of water flooded the area. While Nami saved Brook and Momonosuke, the male pirate
    Sheepshead
    attacked them, but Brook and Sanji managed to defeat him. With Sheepshead defeated, the other pirates decided to leave the island and abandon their mission of finding a samurai. The Straw Hats continued looking for the girl, who was hiding, when Chopper suddenly called them to come to him. Meanwhile, Kaidou came up to the
    Sky Island
    Ballon Terminal
    , looking for a place to die. He jumped and fell 10,000 meters onto the

Kaidou confronted Kid, Apoo, and Hawkins, and he yelled out to Doflamingo, saying he was ready to start the biggest war in history to bring down a world he considered mundane.

   and
    Tsuru
    arrived on Dressrosa and discovered that Fujitora had still not gone after the Straw Hats and Law after landing on a one every day. Mansherry then came up to the Marine encampment, and offered to draw blood from the Marines to heal citizens. The Marines complied, unaware that the dwarves were weakening them. Fujitora offered Tsuru the chance to roll the die, and it did not land on a one, causing him to send the Marines after the criminals on Dressrosa. In Kyros' house, Kyros revealed that he had spread a rumor that Rebecca's father was a faraway prince in order to disassociate her from him, and told her about it via letter, which Luffy did not like. Bartolomeo then came in, revealing that the Marines were on the move. The Straw Hats' allies were lying in wait to help, and Kyros had commissioned the dwarves to make preparations as well. Bartolomeo led the Straw Hats, Law, and Bellamy out of Kyros' house to the eastern port as the Marines came after them, but Luffy separated from them to go to Rebecca.

   Doldo prepared to retake the throne, and Rebecca was attended to as she got ready for her coronation, although she wanted to see Luffy again. Luffy made it to the window of her room, where he asked her if she was fine with what Kyros had done. She replied that she was not, and requested Viola to succeed her as the crown princess before Luffy broke her out of the palace. The citizens of Dressrosa were outraged at what they believed to be a kidnapping, and chased after Luffy and Rebecca. The Marines shot at Luffy, but collapsed due to Mansherry drawing their blood. Luffy dropped Rebecca off at Kyros' house, where she confronted him as he was about to leave the island. Kyros stated that she should not live with him because of the crimes he had committed, but Rebecca replied that she did not care as she embraced her father, wanting to live together with him. Back in the palace, Viola told Doldo about Rebecca's decision.

   Meanwhile, the gladiators took out the Marines in the Straw Hats' way, allowing them to go to the eastern port, and the Tontattas had stolen many of the Marines' weapons while Leo had stitched together their battleships and Mansherry had weakened all the blood donors. However, Law disappeared, and Fujitora arrived to confront the criminals right as Luffy was returning from his detour.
    Law had gone to talk with Sengoku, revealing that he was the boy that Corazon saved. Sengoku reminisced about Corazon's actions, and Law questioned him about the importance of the D. in his name, but Sengoku brushed it off. Deciding not to arrest Law, Sengoku told the pirate to live free like Corazon had wished. Meanwhile, Fujitora lifted up a large amount of rubble to crush his opponents, and as Law and Luffy returned to their comrades, Luffy refused to run away from Fujitora and punched him instead.

  <p key="0f4bab49-16ad-4e84-9c87-530e95fee96b">
   The two began fighting, with Fujitora being annoyed and amused by Luffy telegraphing his attacks. He slammed Luffy into the cliffs around the shore, and Hajrudin grabbed Luffy as the Straw Hats and their allies ran toward the dock. They were still threatened by Fujitora's rubble, but before he could crush them, a mob of Dressrosa citizens ran past him, claiming to want to apprehend Luffy themselves for what happened to Rebecca. In reality, they knew the truth about Rebecca and wanted to protect the Straw Hats from Fujitora, and he withheld his attack. The gladiators took the Straw Hats and Law to Orlumbus' ship, the
    Yonta Maria

    Luffy rejected their offer, as he wanted to sail freely on the seas without having to command anyone. In response to this, the crews made the decision to still serve Luffy, but only when he needed them to, and consumed sake cups to form the

Below deck, Doflamingo talked to Tsuru, saying that his downfall would plunge the world into chaos as various groups would aim for the top and destabilize the current system of power, but she paid no mind to his words. Behind the Marine fleet, a pirate ship approached, and its captain,
