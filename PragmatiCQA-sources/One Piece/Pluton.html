   Its power was as dangerous as other weapons like
   Poseidon
   , who herself had the power to sink all the world's islands into the ocean, although exact details of its capabilities remain unknown. Whoever controlled the weapon had the potential to conquer the world in the process and in the wrong hands would be dangerous. Likewise, Pluton also had the ability to do as much damage to the world. Furthermore, because the blueprints remained in existence even after the ship was built, whoever possessed the blueprints to the vessel would have the potential to build a fleet of vessels with the same destructive abilities as each other.

   Pluton was designed and constructed on
   Water 7
   during the
   Void Century
   , and became inactive after the war. As a reaction to the threat Pluton carried, the World Government used the existence of Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus as the primary reason for banning Poneglyph research. What happened to it after the war has not yet been revealed, but it is supposedly hidden somewhere in
   Arabasta
   , and the
   Poneglyph
   telling its location is hidden in the kingdom's royal tomb.

  <p key="4ec4b7cb-c2cc-416a-ba5d-fe5c5807f550">
   Unlike Poseidon, whose ability was passed down the Ryugu Kingdom royal family bloodline,
   Pluton was said to be an object, meaning the only way a second instance could be created was by reconstruction. The weapon's blueprints were secretly kept in Water 7.

   They had been passed down in a line of incredible shipwrights for centuries before eventually falling into the hands of the legendary shipwright
   Tom
   . The duty of the shipwrights was to guard the blueprints and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Also, they were supposed to use them to construct a second Pluton should the first weapon ever be revived.

   Days later, when Spandam framed Tom and arrested him, and Cutty Flam suffered a seemingly fatal accident after pistol whipping Spandam, Iceberg alone kept the blueprints.

   Three years later, during which Spandam had become chief of CP9, he sent four agents undercover into the city to locate and obtain the blueprints.

   Four years after his assumed death, Cutty Flam returned to Water 7, and secretly met with Iceburg, who gave the blueprints to him for safekeeping. Iceburg requested Cutty Flam that he forgo using his real name but only go by the nickname that Iceburg had given him, Franky, and leave the island to ensure that the Government would never find the blueprints. Out of necessity to avoid being arrested, he followed the first part of the advice, but refused to leave the island, much to Iceburg's ire.

   Crocodile easily saw through Robin's deception and stabbed her, having judged from Cobra's stunned reaction to his mentioning Pluton that the kingdom held the key to finding the weapon,

   When the Straw Hat Pirates reached Water 7, the CP9 agents that had been undercover in the city for 5 years made their move, capturing Robin, who had joined the Straw Hat Pirates, and attempting to assassinate Iceburg while obtaining the blueprints. Upon discovering that the blueprints Iceburg held were fakes, they confronted the mayor, and confirmed their hypothesis that Franky had the blueprints, having discerned his true identity thanks to a passing comment when he returned to the city.
   They captured the cyborg, and took both him and Robin to Enies Lobby. En route, Franky learned that the rumors about Robin are untrue, and that she had no desire to revive the weapons.

   Not much later, Franky witnessed the Straw Hats infiltrate Enies Lobby and declare war on the World Government for Robin's sake, hammering it home that she was one of them. Seeing this, Franky reveals the blueprints, having kept them in his body the whole time, and then incinerates them right in front of Spandam, eliminating any option of building a countermeasure for the real weapon if it is ever revived.
