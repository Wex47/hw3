  </h3>
  <p key="e54d1437-f649-4d8e-b30c-a4a52922693c">
   The fruit's major strength, as demonstrated by Luffy, is that the user's body can stretch, bend, bounce, inflate, and twist like rubber, even when the user himself is nullified.
  </p>
  <p key="8f0314b1-9a51-4c9d-b767-350a7acf6635">
   Unlike most other Devil Fruits, the effects of the Gomu Gomu no Mi are always active, making the user's body permanently rubbery. The user becomes almost completely immune to blunt damage, including hand-to-hand combat, blunt weapons, bullets, and even cannonballs, all of which will just bounce off from his skin. Situations like falls from great heights and heavy collisions that would kill a normal person end up not being lethal or even painful, and certain traps and hazards are rendered ineffective considering the user's enhanced flexibility.
  </p>
  <p key="6a8ced5c-ceb6-4e01-884a-88ed9b0bde77">
   The fruit enables all parts of the consumer's body to behave like rubber, including organs, meaning that certain actions  that otherwise would be impossible to do with a normal human body, such as pumping one's own blood or bones with air, can be achieved through this ability for extra speed or power. Furthermore, thanks to rubber's natural insulating properties, the user is also immune to electrical attacks, such as those from the
   Goro Goro no Mi
   ,
   Electro
   or
   Zeus
   . This immunity to electricity allows the user to hit
   Enel
   , the user of the Goro Goro no Mi (an electricity Logia) without needing Haki.
   Those same properties may also grant some resistance towards underwater pressure, letting the user fight while surrounded by a deep underwater environment despite the usual Devil Fruit weakness.
  </p>
  <p key="dc422393-0c3d-4ff4-9ee4-63f01b6723d2">
   The user's ability to stretch and twist like rubber to extreme lengths not only makes them immune to injuries that originate from such, but it also grants them the ability to rebound from hard surfaces or reach people that are far away from their position, providing a great advantage in and out of combat. Stretching also allows the user to drastically increase the range of what would otherwise be considered a powerful close-range attack, turning it into a devastating mid-range or long-range attack. A stretched limb can also be used to store potential energy like a stretched spring, increasing the velocity by stretching their arm back, resulting in increased power.
  </p>
  <p key="ddc49531-f6b0-4f3a-afee-cead68a1d01f">
   Luffy has also shown a limited ability of moving in mid-air, by grabbing onto something with an extended limb and pulling himself away from what could have been a fatal attack. This gives the user the option of several jumping and airborne attacks that would have been disadvantageous to most other people.
  </p>
  <p key="1ecae78c-566a-4b3d-93f1-fd6050ab7e8d">
   In the anime, Luffy has used his stretching abilities to inhale great amounts of air to thus exhale a big gust of wind; this application of his powers was used to blow away
   Marigold
   's
   poisonous vapor from her venom spit
   and
   Magellan

    Weaknesses
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="394ff723-572c-4574-b1b2-62202bdeaca6">
   Despite all the great advantages Luffy gets by using his fruit, there are a number of weaknesses. One major risk of Luffy's powers is that his stretched limbs take a moment to unstretch back into place, leaving him vulnerable to attacks in the moments when his limbs are stretched, as
   Buggy
   and
   Kuro
   both demonstrated early on in the series. Luffy, however, has adapted his fighting style to minimize this risk.
  </p>
  <p key="184cb00a-a848-4d7c-ae82-f2f4527a02f4">
   Initially, Luffy's body was similar to a rubber band, requiring him to use excessive motion to "throw" an attack. After the time-skip though, the extra movement became unnecessary, and Luffy is able to stretch easily. Additionally, rubber has a maximum limit to how far it can stretch; in the first
   SBS
   , Oda stated that Luffy's maximum stretching distance is "
   <b key="b2121fc1-6c72-48f0-a15b-d5c68b05f48f">
    72 Gomu Gomus
   </b>
   ".
   Attempting to go beyond this length can cause the user to bleed and be at risk of ripping.
  </p>
  <p key="22d56031-d769-4c16-a5ee-ad326eedb221">
   Luffy, of course, also suffers the same weaknesses to water,
   like
   Fish-Man Karate
   and
   Seastone
   , as other
   Devil Fruit
   users. However, he sometimes appears to forget about this particular downside. And while contact with water and Seastone does drain Luffy of his energy and nullify his rubber-like ability to absorb blunt attacks (as with
   Smoker
   's
   jutte
   ), his actual body still maintains its rubber-like make, allowing a third party to stretch his body for him.
  </p>
  <p key="117dd10a-83b6-499e-8ea8-1b491429abad">
   The Gomu Gomu no Mi user is also susceptible to Busoshoku Haki. Similar to water's effects, the usage of Haki only nullifies Luffy's ability to absorb blunt attacks. It does not however, revert Luffy's body to unstretchable flesh. Through the use of Busoshoku Haki, Luffy's
   grandfather
   was able to hurt him using only his fist (though Garp attributed this to "love"). When Luffy's crewmates (usually Nami) get angry at him, their punches are able to bypass Luffy's immunity to blunt attacks, although this is purely for comedic effect.
  </p>
  <p key="20058984-1194-47e2-8923-f26057b29cba">
   Another weakness noted by Doflamingo is that when Busoshoku Haki is applied to a part of Luffy's body, it stops being rubbery. This is proven with Luffy's
   <b key="8eee9238-ebca-4e2c-8e98-1c5021cf4615">
    Gomu Gomu no Thor Elephant Gun
   </b>
   , where, despite rubber being a natural insulator of electricity, the Busoshoku Haki-enhanced attack itself discharges it. This weakness is negated by Gear Fourth however.

    Usage
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="4634dea4-0025-4777-aacb-bf8daa78ae06">
   In his youth, Luffy had a problem controlling his own abilities. Though he had an idea of how they would work, Luffy had trouble with aiming and the timing of his attacks, and he was continuously sent spinning by the recoil. However, he managed to counter these weaknesses with his continuous training in the jungle by the time he left to be a pirate.
  </p>
  <p key="4054c420-cf06-4552-b011-f49df38f9f92">
   The powers of the fruit have been used by Luffy in a variety of ways. These range from simply moving from one place to another in a rather reckless manner, to attacking an enemy with a barrage of fast and strong punches. He has also developed several peculiar methods of combat as time passed, adapting new forms by manipulating his elastic body, most prominent his "
   <b key="acae68a3-82b4-463d-89a9-8013348f45da">
    Gear Second
   </b>
   " and "
   <b key="1389d402-6358-4429-a128-f20b45d94bc6">
    Gear Third
   </b>
   " forms, allowing him to momentarily increase his strength in combat. After the timeskip, he has learned to use
   Haki
   in conjunction with the fruit's powers, as well as having more control over his forms. Later, during the time skip, Luffy developed a form known as
   <b key="4e21c807-5b74-4320-b8d1-af9df37500d8">
    Gear Fourth
   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <p key="d0709ecd-8884-4599-803d-37dfa755571a">
   Of course Luffy, being who he is, does not only use his ability for battle. When with his crew, or even when partying with others, Luffy tends to use his elastic properties for the humor and joy of others, such as making funny faces, or using his elastic body to play around. Often throughout the series he would stretch his arm and steal food from others, much to their annoyance. He also uses his powers for transportation purposes, a primary example being his "
   <b key="41b86fe3-b14e-4ce9-b8a6-5c3200559981">
    Gomu Gomu no Rocket,"
   </b>
   which has him grab something with his arms and fire himself like a slingshot, which helps him travel great distances quickly. Luffy also has no problem letting other people play with his stretching body, which people tend to take advantage of.

   Who's-Who

   For a currently unclear reason, the fruit seemed to have been heavily valued by the World Government, as evidenced by Who's-Who being stationed to guard it; additionally, Who's-Who's failure to protect the fruit directly led to his dismissal from CP9 and eventual imprisonment.

   , and
   Funimation
   all translate this fruit's name as the "Gum-Gum Fruit". This translation comes from the etymology of the Japanese word "Gomu". "Gomu" is a loan word from Dutch, it comes from "Gom" which is used in Dutch to refer to rubber to identify it as "natural rubber" instead of "synthetic rubber". This is not only true of Japanese, but most worldly language derive their word for "Rubber" from "Gum".
  </p>
  <p key="124a0161-6526-44b9-bd00-b46694c141f9">
   Viz most likely selected "Gum-Gum" as a translation over "Rubber Rubber" due to "Gum" being phonically similar to "Gomu". The only English version of the series to ever translate it out as the "Rubber Rubber Fruit" is the
   Odex
   version. This is because it has no connections to the North American versions at all. Despite translating Gomu as "Gum", all English versions refer to Luffy as a "rubber man".
