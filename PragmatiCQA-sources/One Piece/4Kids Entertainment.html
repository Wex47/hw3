   On March 16, 2006, 4Kids announced plans to concentrate only on their fully-owned properties. A fall of profit was blamed on the shortfall of several of their dubbed licenses such as
   <i key="a3660718-1805-4e4f-9a31-07c8d29f0abd">

   and several other licenses they held were said to offset the results.
   The company as a result later dropped a few shows including one of their biggest earners,
   <i key="fae017f2-4559-4196-bcfc-e5623cb925ad">
    Pokémon

   . The dubbing of new anime lessened, and 4Kids announced on December 6, 2006 that they had canceled production of their One Piece dub and dropped the license.
   Ultimately, 4kids produced 104 English-dubbed episodes from the first 143 Japanese episodes.

   In Japan, early episodes of One Piece aired at 7:00 to 7:30pm .
   4Kids reportedly licensed the series based on its merchandising potential and success in Japan without looking at the content of the episodes themselves in detail; when 4Kids staff watched the series, they were shocked at how much unsuitable material they found but had already committed to localizing the series.
   Their version of the series had to comply with the standards of their demographics of ages 8–13 as well as the rules set by the TV networks airing the series. Part of 4Kid's production process involved sending footage and scripts to American television networks for review, dictating which elements would be altered for the English version.
  </p>
  <p key="3783a7fc-ed1e-4baa-a797-86ccbe45cc57">
   One of the more noted changes was the skin of a character being changed from black to white in
   episode 5
   .

  <p key="974d80f4-3240-4f00-b819-11b09fec9e72">
   A Funimation representative would later confirmed some of the need for TV censorship when they aired One Piece on TV, stating that toning down the violence and removing
   cigarette
   and
   alcohol
   consumption was a requirement for the series to be broadcast on Cartoon Network.

   Music changes such as this were not exclusive to 4Kids, and
   anime localization
   would commonly do this both to keep synchronization with the edited visuals and to replicate the musical aesthetic of western productions.
   Kahn explained that the music in 4Kids dubs was westernized "so that children in English-speaking countries will understand it" and to appeal more to American audiences.
   It has also been suggested that composing an original soundtrack is cheaper and more profitable for 4Kids than licensing the Japanese soundtrack.

   In the ANN 2005 Year In review, Zac Bertschy described the localization as "so poorly received that the show became something of a joke among fans".
   Sharing his personal opinion in the Answerman column, Bertschy said that 4Kids "butchered" the series and "made it this terribly acted pile of garbage".

  <p key="dca34774-63c9-4dc4-a618-02fcf7bc5b35">

   while an alternate Year Review written by Theron Martin compared 4Kids' version of

  <p key="350192f9-25e9-48bd-8903-d9e72d796cc2">
   Reviewing the series as part of ANN's 'The Click' column from its move to
   Toonami
   , Brian Hanson commented that "digital paint flows over every frame like
   Niagara Falls
   , random cuts abound, and odd name changes like “Nebra” and “Trace” flourish".
   As the column continued, Hanson declared that he had "zero tolerance for this dub" due to its "terrible, godawful puns", "unnecessary" censorship and "goofy high-pitched" voice acting.
   As the series continued, Hanson would regularly describe the names changes sarcastically at 4kids' expense and commented that the removal of Chaser's (Smoker's)
   cigars
   was poorly achieved.
   In response to Funimation's acquisition of the One Piece license, Hanson exclaimed "No more interminable
   Brooklyn accents
   ! No more lame puns and jokes that even the most ardent
   Garfield
   fans would find infantile! Until then, though, we'll be slogging through 4Kids' One Piece detritus".
  </p>
  <p key="c6d5df86-dbea-4e1e-991a-9a30a576ae58">
   Reviewing the edited DVD release for DVD Talk, Todd Douglass Jr. described the dub's sound mix as "flat" and the voice acting as "pretty irritating" with "a lot of high-pitches and over exaggerated speech". Addressing the heavy localization, Douglass said that "unless you have seen the original Japanese version you may not be able to point out all of these examples, but you still get the feeling that something is missing" while conceding that "these episodes are fun enough despite having their content edited".
  </p>
  <p key="c0dccdeb-df5f-4ae0-899c-4e56b8e7b51e">
   Some 4Kids employees have responded to this criticism by claiming that the most vocal critics of their localization are not in its target audience, and that many viewers enjoyed their adaptions as children before complaining about the changes made once they were older; they describe One Piece, however, as "an extreme case" that "tarred the reputation" of 4Kids.
  </p>
  <p key="8feb4968-9153-4468-a570-eb5bdaa75a65">
   Following Funimation's acquisition of the series, critics regularly compared their
   uncut DVD releases
   to the 4Kids version, with the former being seen as a huge improvement. Carl Kimlinger of ANN comment that "even at it's worst [the Funimation] version is far superior to 4Kids Entertainment's version".
   Summarizing the series' history in the USA, David Smith of IGN concluded that "here we are today, with a perfectly acceptable localization of the series [...] Pity it took so long"
   and noted which episodes had not been released before.
