   catches a deadly fever in

    allows him to eat anything and assimilate it into himself. After a brief skirmish,

   In the recent past, the island was ruled by a cruel king, Wapol, the pirate the
    Straw Hats
    encountered earlier. Wapol banished all but the 20 best doctors from the island. For any medical treatment, one would have to beg him for the help of one of the remaining doctors, his "
    Isshi-20
    " as he called them. However, a powerful pirate named
    Blackbeard
    attacked the country. After witnessing Blackbeard's power,
    Wapol
    and his cabinet, with the exception of
    Dalton
    fled to the sea without even fighting back. Now, there is only one doctor left on the island—Dr.
    Kureha
    , who is often called a witch by the townspeople. She comes into towns at her own whim to check for patients. She lives in
    Drum Castle
    , which is on top of the highest of the "
    Drum Rockies
    ", a chain of drum shaped mountains.

    Lapahns
    , giant ferocious rabbits. A fight ensues, and its ferocity causes an avalanche. Sanji is injured, so Luffy must climb up the mountain while carrying both Nami and Sanji. When he reaches the top, both his hands and feet are severely damaged. He collapses in front of Dr. Kureha and her assistant,

   Meanwhile, Wapol and his crew return to Drum Island and attack a city to announce their presence. Dalton tries to fight them, but is defeated. Having done this, Wapol and his crew decide to go back to their old home, Drum Castle. As this is happening, Dr. Kureha and Chopper are curing Nami and caring for Sanji and Luffy, there are a few comedic scenes, mostly involving Sanji and Luffy trying to catch and cook Chopper. Later, Dr. Kureha explains Chopper's tragic past to Sanji and Nami (Luffy was too busy chasing after Chopper trying to convince him to join the crew).

   When Chopper was younger, he ate the
    Hito Hito no Mi
    . As a result, and because of his blue nose, the other reindeer would not accept him into their herds. He was an outcast for much of his life. Finally, he found a friend in a Dr.
    Hiriluk
    , a quack doctor that was trying to cure the people of Drum but usually made a mess of things. He found Chopper with bullet wounds in his back. By curing Chopper, he gained Chopper's trust and inspired Chopper to become a doctor. However, their friendship was not to last. Dr. Hiriluk kicked Chopper out of his home, seemingly for no reason. Later, Chopper found out that Dr. Hiriluk was going to die in ten days. Despite his attempts to save him, the good doctor sacrificed him for the sake of Chopper and his country. Since then, he has stayed with Dr. Kureha, and learned the art of doctoring.

   Eventually, Wapol and his crew arrive at the castle. His senior henchman,
    Chess
    and
    Kuromarimo
    are in tow. Kuromarimo distracts the crew by throwing fuzzy black balls that will not come off onto Sanji. This gives Wapol time to get to the armory and devour a cannon. It is then that another trait of the Baku Baku Fruit is revealed - Wapol can become whatever he eats! Wapol's arms turn into a cannon, and he starts shooting at Dr. Hiriluk's flag (his memorial as Kureha puts it). Chopper does not respond so Luffy takes action, standing in front of the cannonballs so they do not damage the flag, effectively thwarting the assault.
  </p>
  <p key="fc129c0f-caa9-4a49-bc04-16b73414aae6">
   Wapol then employs a different strategy, he eats Chess and Kuromimo. Then turns into a house, and a combination of Chess and Kuromarimo emerges -
    Chessmarimo
    ! Sanji tries to enter the fight, but Kureha cripples him, by attacking his spine and telling him that he has still not recovered. Chopper finally reacts and fights with Chessmarimo, showing off the skills he gains through his invention, the
    Rumble Ball
    . Using the Rumble Ball he finds Chessmarimo's weakness and defeats him.

   Wapol goes into the castle looking to eat more weaponry along the way running in to Nami giving chase when he realizes she is a friend of Luffy, when he gets stuck in a stairwell he "eats himself" and emerges skinny before continuing the chase. Luffy finds Nami in time to stop Wapol from killing her, but Wapol escapes. Luffy pursues Wapol, but Wapol reaches a tower which supposedly holds a very powerful and giant cannon called
    Royal Drum Crown 7-Shot Bliking Cannon
    . Wapol attempts to shoot Luffy with it, however while it sat unused during his absence,
    Snow Birds
    made nests in it. As a result, Wapol's attack on Luffy fails. The king then tries to stop Luffy with his the cannon he ate earlier, but Luffy dodges it and sends Wapol into the the castle's ceiling with his bowgun attack.

   In the aftermath, Luffy continues to try and recruit Chopper to his crew. Chopper, remembering how his old mentor, Dr. Hiriluk, wanted him to go out to sea and see the world, decides to join the Straw Hats. When he goes to tell Kureha this, she flat out refuses to let him leave, chasing after the reindeer with a variety of weapons until Chopper escapes down the mountain with the rest of the Straws Hats on a sled. Turns out however, Kureha's refusal was all an act (or in a way, reverse psychology) to convince Chopper to leave as she does not like tearful goodbyes. Dr. Kureha then has most of the villagers set up cannons pointed into the air and uses the "cure for the country's cold heart" that Dr. Hiriluk had developed before he died, to produce the image of falling cherry-blossoms on the snow, as a send off to her beloved student. After witnessing this, the Straw Hats finally set off for Arabasta.

    Ace
    , a man who was searching for Blackbeard and was going to wait for Luffy in Arabasta for ten days. But since Luffy is gone, they did not have the time to tell him. However, Dalton, who remembered Vivi as Arabasta's princess, knows it is all right since the Straw Hats are bound to encounter Ace in Arabasta.

In the manga, Dr. Kureha mentions Chopper's initial transformation and the villagers shooting him to Nami, with his history with Dr Hiriluk being shown through a flaskback after Wapol has begun attempting to take back Drum Castle. In the anime, Dr. Kureha explains Chopper's complete history to Nami and Sanji before anyone at the castle is aware of Wapol's re-appearance.
