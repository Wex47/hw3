However, his request to join was constantly rebuffed by Shanks on the grounds that he was too young and weak to be pirate yet. He was also constantly annoyed by Yasopp, who often bragged about his son, Usopp, which led to Luffy recognizing the young sniper upon meeting him.

  <p key="e538b726-c3c9-4faa-97e6-9a5505e33ecb">
   One day, Luffy stabbed himself under his left eye to prove himself to the crew, giving himself his trademark scar. The crew celebrated his bravery at the Partys Bar run by
   Makino
   , but still refused to let him join, which angered him. Then Luffy also found the Gomu Gomu no Mi inside Roux's chest and took a bite of it, thus becoming a rubber-man. At the same time as that, a group of mountain bandits led by
   Higuma
   came into the bar and began hassling the pirates, though they did not retaliate as they was no need for it. Luffy became disappointed by this, but then he and the others realized that he had gained rubber powers from eating the fruit they stole and Shanks scolds him for it, as eating it costed him the ability to swim.

   Sometime later, the bandits showed up again when the crew was away and Luffy overheard them saying bad things about Shanks and his crew. This cause his temper to flared up and he started insulting their leader, enticing the bandits to subdue him and attempt to kill the boy. But then Shanks and his crew arrived to save their young friend, and predictably, the bandits underestimate them until Lucky Roux kills one of them with a pistol and Beckman defeats the rest single-handedly. Terrified by their power, Higuma escapes with a smoke-bomb with Luffy as his hostage. The bandit leader takes the boy out to sea and throws him into the water, and gleefully watches the young Devil Fruit user struggle to swim until he was devoured by the
   Lord of the Coast
   . The beast then attempts to eat the helpless Luffy next, but Shanks suddenly arrives in time to save him, but at the cost of his own left arm. Unphased by this, he then frightened the monster off simply by
   staring at it
   and saying "Get lost", and he comforts Luffy, who was crying over the loss of his savior's limb.

   Later, the crew then finally decided to leave the island. Luffy then said he did not want to join Shanks and his crew anymore; instead he would become a pirate on his own, to which Shanks then said was still impossible. Angered by this, Luffy immediately declared his intention to become an even greater pirate than Shanks as well as the Pirate King. The pirate captain became surprised upon hearing these words, as they were the same words that his old captain,
