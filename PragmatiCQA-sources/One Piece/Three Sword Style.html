   Zoro first started developing "
   Two Sword Style
   ", when he first started learning the ways of the sword. Defeated by his rival

    Kuina
   </a>
   2000 times, this only drove him to become stronger and stronger. One day, he challenged Kuina to the two thousand and first match, confident as usual, only this time, he wanted to fight with actual swords. Zoro fought with his usual Two Sword Style, as Kuina fought with her "One Sword Style". At the end of the fight, Kuina once again came out on top. That would be the last time that the two rivals ever fought each other, because the next day Kuina lost her footing on some stairs, fell, and died. When Zoro was told this, he was devastated, and he asked his sensei to give her sword, "
   Wado Ichimonji
   " to him so that he can carry on their dream to become the greatest swordsman.
  </p>
  <p key="90d66276-7e03-415d-8cc4-029b4d728ccb">
   It was because of this that Zoro started developing "Three Sword Style", which later drove him to become an extremely powerful master swordsman, of Three Sword Style. Despite it being an irregular fighting style involving using three swords in an unusual manner involving one in each hand and one in the jaw, this is his most preferred fighting form against several powerful opponents.
  </p>
  <p key="1a829256-0f8b-45f8-bafb-be62f1bd3867">
   Although Zoro has stated that it does not matter which swords he uses as long as he has three, multiple subpar swords unable to match Wado Ichimonji have broken several times, meaning that he could never use his Three Sword Style to the fullest. After getting
   Sandai Kitetsu
   and
   <a href="Yubashiri.html" key="9a6fd5cd-1de7-42b1-aede-440128e47e5d" title="Yubashiri">

   , he could better use this sword style to the fullest, defeating the second strongest
   CP9

   Kaku
   . He later replaced Yubashiri, which had been rusted by
   Shu

   Shusui

   Three Sword Style is an extremely formidable Strong Blade swordsmanship style in comparison to conventional swordsmanship such as one sword style or the more versatile two sword due to triple wielding three swords by dual wielding two sword in both hands and the third in the mouth. However, Three Sword Style requires a gruelling amount of tedious training to develop both the superhuman arm and jaw strength as well as the immense ambidexterity required to effectively use all three swords as Zoro had to do all sorts of abnormal training exercises from his childhood to young adult life to master it.
  </p>
  <p key="f811442a-8a93-4f97-bc88-0e27046329b8">
   When Zoro triple wield swords, the third one (usually the
   Wado Ichimonji
   ) is placed in his mouth.
   While using Three Sword Style, Zoro has a tendency to hold his left hand blade with a "reverse grip", in which the blade protrudes from the bottom of his hand and points away from the opponent. This is likely done to increase the versatility of his attacks, as holding the blade in this fashion allows him to deliver multiple cuts from a variety of angles. A few examples are during his battle with Pica, when he blocked Pica's strike on
   Ucy
   , when he uses "Ichidai Sanzen Daisen Sekai", and when he uses "Sanzen Sekai".
  </p>
  <p key="824c7e85-d647-466c-9fec-2eae08680238">
   Several of his attack names are actually puns due to the way some of the Japanese words are combined together. When these words are pronounced together, they can sound like a completely different Japanese word, often referring to cuisine in general, and to sushi in many specific cases. Also, while Zoro is agnostic, some of his attacks have religious references to them. Many of his attacks before and after the timeskip also incorporate animal themes (gorilla, dragon, lion, bull, etc.).

    </span>
    : Zoro's signature technique.
    A three-way simultaneous slashing attack. Zoro crosses his two swords across his chest and places the blade in his mouth horizontally behind them. Zoro then approaches the target (usually at high speed) and cuts through by swinging the swords across his chest, resulting in a descending diagonal-crossing slash from both swords while the mouth blade performs a horizontal cut from either the left or right, depending on which side of his mouth he positioned the sword's main blade at. The pun in the name is that onigiri is also the name of a Japanese rice snack, while an oni is a type of ogre/demon in Japanese folklore. This was first seen used to finish
    Cabaji
    and the first technique he used against
    Dracule Mihawk
    . It should also be noted that in that fight with Mihawk, the technique's main weakness was discovered. There is a single brief moment when the three swords are all lined up behind each other. If one can block them at that instant, the entire technique will be rendered useless. Mihawk did so by putting his necklace blade against the front most sword when Zoro tried the technique.
    Doing so however, requires an enormous amount of strength, more so than Zoro himself or else he will just push through the block and connect anyways, as shown with Zoro's battle with
    Hatchan
    . This attack has been shown to rival

    According to the name of this attack, this is the ultimate and strongest technique of the Three Sword Style. It was first used successfully against
    Oars
    after 429 chapters since its first appearance, where Zoro dealt three enormous slashes over Oars' body with the technique.
    Zoro has improved his usage of this over the timeskip, now able to prepare it while hurtling through the air and able to use this attack while his three swords are imbued with
    Busoshoku Haki
    . This attack was shown for the first time when he used it against
    Pica
    after the timeskip.

This new stronger version possesses the ability to cut through a large stone wall (in this case, Pica). The name implies it is ten times as strong as the previous version. This was first used against

    : A Haoshoku and Busoshoku-Haki infused variant of his regular Three Sword Style technique "Rengoku Onigiri", Zoro performs his usual Oni Giri stance, with his two swords crossed across his chest and places the blade in his mouth horizontally behind them. However, unlike previous versions of this technique, he does not charge towards his opponent before performing the slashes. Additionally, the use of both Haoshoku and Busoshoku Haki in this version not only increases the strength of the attack, but the range as a well, effectively turning the close-range slashing technique into a long-range flying slash technique. This version was first used against King, and was shown to easily destroy the boulder he was standing on, despite missing King himself.
