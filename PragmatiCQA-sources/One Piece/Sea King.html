   Sea Kings vary radically in physical build, to the point that no two individuals have been observed with matching physiques, proportions, or even colorations. How many—if any—of these are distinct species remains unknown.

  <p key="0a626943-c268-4a7e-9bc4-4f7208cb0269">
   The feature most "common" to Sea Kings in general is a long, vaguely serpentine body, though this is by no means universal. One particular specimen encountered by the
   Straw Hat Pirates
   was even noted to look like an oversized frog, complete with distinct toes instead of fins or flippers.

   Apart from this, Sea Kings are mostly defined by their size. The smallest known specimen,

   Sea Kings make trade and travel difficult for anyone trying to cross the water where they are found as they are exceptionally fierce and strong compared to many other sea creatures. They are powerful predators and attack unprovoked with no fear or signs of backing down, with the only exceptions being the cases where they themselves were the hunted. Cases have arisen where some islands in the Grand Line close to the edge of the Calm Belt (their natural breeding ground) have ended up getting almost completely cut off from the rest of the world due to the Sea Kings themselves.

   once commented that he always dreamt of riding on the back of a Sea King. However, according to legend, once every few centuries a mermaid is born with the ability to speak to the Sea Kings; on that day the world will change forever, then one day a man will appear to guide that mermaid. The name of the previous Mermaid turned out to be
   Poseidon
   , whose abilities were considered a weapon that is able to destroy the world and whose power is in line with the other two ancient weapons called

This power implies that the Sea Kings are very powerful indeed, but it is noted that due to the nature of this ability, when used for the greater evil, it is a most dangerous ability, as if they are drawn into a rage by the Mermaid's ability unintentionally through shock due to the mermaid's lack of control, they can destroy and sink every land mass into the ocean.
