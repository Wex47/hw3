   to have a fairly good understanding of Luffy and his crew, as well as his rivals who were also on

   During the reconstruction of Marineford, reporters were there to record every moment. When Luffy returned along with Jinbe and
   Silvers Rayleigh
   and sailed once around the island with a stolen Marine ship, Luffy himself entered the island and rang the
   Ox Bell
   16 times, then threw a bouquet of flowers over the largest battle scar on the island and performed a silent prayer before escaping the Marines. The reporters were very excited by what seemed like a natural photo op, and they made sure to take as many pictures as possible, which ended up being published in newspapers.
