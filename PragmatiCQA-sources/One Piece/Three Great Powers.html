   fear that if this balance gets disrupted, the world itself could descend into anarchy. Furthermore, the balance of power was incredibly delicate; if even one party from one these groups is lost, it could make the balance fall apart entirely. After
   Crocodile
   was arrested and got his Warlord title revoked following the
   Arabasta incident
   , the loss of such a powerful ally in such a public manner tips the balance away from the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and in turn, the Marines as well. This leaves them with diminished force to counter the menace of the Four Emperors and allows the general populace to question their power and authority.

   Another concern is that the Marines are the sole organization completely under the supremacy of the World Government. The Seven Warlords often only follow orders on a whim, if at all, and the Four Emperors are outside of the World Government's control entirely.

   The Four Emperors and Marines seem to be on the opposite ends of the spectrum, with the Marines being more orderly compared to the Four Emperors who are very chaotic, with the Seven Warlords acting as somewhere in between. Considering that these organizations are stated to be a balance and the fact that the loss of
   Crocodile
   threatened the balance, it is likely these groups are approximately equal in strength. According to Yosaku, the presence of the Three Great Powers over the

   As the delicate balance of the Three Great Powers is what stabilizes the world, the existence and actions of other powerful groups, such as the
   Revolutionary Army
   and the
   Worst Generation
   is a significant threat to that balance. With the current dissolution of the Seven Warlords system, it is currently unknown how much the balance of power has been affected within the world. While several civilians express such concern, the World Government had utilized the
