   The Thousand Sunny is a
   brigantine
   , a type of ship that relies on the skills of its navigator. The
   ship
   has a lawn on her deck, complete with a swing and a slide, as well as an observation tower for a crow's nest. The huge masts give the ship extreme maneuverability. Like the

   , the figurehead is an animal's head, specifically a lion with a stylized mane. Due to the mane's ambiguity, the lion was mistaken for both a sunflower and a sun during the ship's construction, much to Franky's frustration.
   The ship holds sixteen cannons: seven traditional cannons on each side of the ship and two specialized air cannons—the Gaon Cannon in the figurehead and the Coup de Burst cannon astern. By the admission of

  <p key="47f356ea-e236-46eb-9bf5-e9cba903cdec">
   The figurehead of the Thousand Sunny is a large lion face with two crossbones behind it in the manner of a
   <a href="Jolly Roger.html" key="ac166bf2-92a1-4fd5-8cd3-0a0d65d60f08" title="Jolly Roger">

   . The mouth of the figurehead can open in order to reveal the Gaon Cannon for frontal attacks, and the lion's mane can rotate like a propeller to move the ship backwards if needed.
  </p>
  <p key="4b6e4393-1036-49da-b7d6-33d901dc9f29">
   The Thousand Sunny's helm is located at the front of the ship. Unlike the conventional steering wheels found on traditional sailing ships, the position of the Sunny's steering wheel resembles those found on modern ships. The controls for the Soldier Dock System are located on the steering wheel itself. A knob allows one to choose which compartments to position at the opening on the side of the ship, and a lever situated next to the wheel can then be used to open the compartments. The lever not only operates the compartments for the Soldier Dock System, but also doubles as the lever that initiates the Coup de Burst. In the anime, the lever was shown being used for the build up of cola energy in the Energy Room, and upon completion, the user at the helm pulls the lever to activate the Coup de Burst.
   A bench is conveniently located near the steering wheel. The Sunny also has a built-in Log Pose, located on a metal pillar of medium height which stands directly behind the ship's helm.
   Upon reaching the New World, they updated the large Log Pose to the appropriate New World version, which is similar to Nami's new log pose, with three needles installed instead of only one.
  </p>
  <p key="44a57330-4de7-44bd-bdfc-583b546aaa79">
   The anchors of the Thousand Sunny are positioned at each side of the front of the ship and resemble large lion paws, each with three toes. The ropes used to raise and lower them are stored inside the metal ring positioned behind the figurehead. In the anime, post-timeskip, the ship was shown to be able to fire both its anchors like grappling hooks.
  </p>
  <p key="641aa40d-36bc-4375-9287-7da8474203b8">
   After the timeskip, Franky installed searchlights in the eyes of the lion figurehead.
  </p>
  <p key="8c0abe2d-e3f6-40b9-8691-5c4424770b18">
   Recently, the figurehead has shown some anthropomorphic expressions, much like the Going Merry's did. The lion made a dizzy face in the manga when the Straw Hats got caught in a
   White Strom
   and, in the anime, a panicked face when they were surrounded by Sea Kings during their descent to Fish-Man Island, and again, when the ship caught on fire because Luffy forgot to turn off the stove, and during the ensuing chaos, the figurehead got a sweat drop. During the arrival at Wano Country, it had a panicked face when Luffy voiced his intention to leave it behind.

Unlike the men's quarters, which looks more typical for a ship, the women's quarters resembles more like a bedroom that one would normally see on land. It contains two beds, a bookshelf, a four-door closet, a vanity with a mirror, and some comfy sofas, among other things. A treasure chest belonging to Nami can be found behind the beds. Since the timeskip, the two beds have been replaced by a single king sized bed.

   At the entrance to each room is a washroom. The room by the men's quarters' entrance is a typical household washroom setup. It contains a regular sink and some toothbrushes. The only other unique feature in this room is a bell to wake everyone up in case of emergencies or other important situations. The washroom by the women's quarters entrance is somewhat more elaborate. It contains a closet where wine and a tea set can be stored. While cold, fresh water for both washrooms is provided by internal pumps and filters, hot water for the tea set must be retrieved from the kitchen. There is also a door at both sides of each bedroom which leads to a narrow space containing a cannon. In the

   The combined kitchen and dining room of the ship resembles a restaurant, with the two areas separated by a bar. The kitchen has a professional setup and cooking equipment, including a giant oven that can bake anything and a giant fridge with a lock, something Sanji has requested many times in order to stop people (mainly

   . The code is a combination of their names. 7 and 3 can be pronounced as "na" and "mi" respectively in Japanese and thus refer to Nami. Likewise, 2 and 6 can be pronounced as "ni" and "ro" respectively and thus refer to the two first syllables of Nico Robin's full name. 3 and 2 can also be pronounced as "san" and "ji" and thus refer to Sanji. A pantry used to store dry goods can be accessed by a door adjacent to the fridge and by a door outside; to discourage Luffy from raiding the supplies here, only raw, unprocessed groceries are kept inside. Next to the kitchen is the main mast of the ship; built within it is a dumbwaiter that can be used to deliver food to the aquarium bar below. The area also contains a ladder that leads to a hatch giving access to the observation deck above. A

He also keeps his signature from Sogeking hanging up on the wall, even though it was just

   Basically, the Sunny uses three barrels of

   is a powerful cannon hidden within the lion's mouth in the prow of the ship; the cannon itself fires a blast of air that resembles an energy beam (just like the non-canonical
   Goe Goe no Mi
   ). The cannon is controlled from a room within the prow itself. It was first used by Usopp to take out most of the Flying Fish Riders in one shot, obliterating nearly half of
   Duval
   's base as a bonus.
   The one drawback of the Gaon Cannon is that it uses up five barrels of cola in all: three to fire the cannon itself and two to fire the Coup de Burst cannon in the rear to keep the ship from rocketing backward (unless the crew uses the cannon with the intention of rocketing backwards, such as if they need to escape from immediate danger in front of them, then only three barrels are used up). This means that the cannon can only be used sparingly.

   in her way, and with the Log Pose pointing directly below the ship, the Straw Hats decided to deploy
   Shark Submerge III
   to investigate the depths below. Due to the extreme pressure of the depths below, they were unable to investigate more than five thousand meters below the ship. However, their search brought up an enormous sea king that threatened to destroy both the Thousand Sunny and its crew. When the creature was defeated, it spat out two things that landed abruptly on the Sunny's deck. These were

   With these new passengers onboard, the crew of the Sunny was promised a reward of great tasting takoyaki. However, before they could be given this treat, they learned that a friend of Camie and Pappag had just been captured by the
   Macro Pirates
   and the
   Flying Fish Riders
   . Figuring that these two might know the way to Fish-Man Island,

    Nami

   asked they would show the pirates the way to the underwater paradise if the Straw Hats rescued their friend. The two agreed to reward the Straw Hats as such, along with the promise of takoyaki. With this, the Thousand Sunny was steered toward the Flying Fish Riders' base with help from a school of fish summoned by Camie. Just as the ship was nearing the base, the school of fish leading the Straw Hats suddenly absconded, having felt the presence of the Flying Fish Riders. Sure enough, the riders soon ambushed the ship and started attacking from atop their giant flying fish. Though a battle between the Straw Hats and the riders ensued, the riders abruptly retreated as quickly as they had arrived.

   After sailing awhile after the Flying Fish Rider's last attack, the Thousand Sunny soon reached their base. Though seemingly empty upon arrival except for
   Hatchan
   , a previous enemy and the captured friend of the Straw Hats' new traveling companions, the crew guessed the riders were planning an ambush. Their guess was soon verified and a battle between the Straw Hats and the Flying Fish Riders within the base. As the majority of the Straw Hats battled aboard the Thousand Sunny, several things happened. Amongst these in particular was the revelation that the Flying Fish Riders' boss,
   Duval
   , had the same face as Sanji's wanted poster and whose grudge against Sanji was the reason why he and his men were attacking the Straw Hats so vigorously. As the battle against Duval and his men continued, the Flying Fish Riders decided to sink the Thousand Sunny by dropping a large anchor on the ship. However through Franky and Usopp's efforts, the ship escaped the attack and instead blew up the Flying Fish Rider's base with an attack of its own from the Gaon Cannon. the Straw Hats eventually defeated the Flying Fish Riders with Sanji rearranging Duval's face with a barrage of kicks. With the matter settled, the Thousand Sunny was steered towards the

  <p key="d1fd14d5-dd09-4239-9d8a-e604a88ad758">
   After a little reward from Hatchan and some thanks from Duval for a new face, the crew of the Thousand Sunny were told that the only way to get to Fish-Man Island was to coat the ship with resin from the
   Yarukiman Mangrove

   . Learning about this, the Straw Hats steered the ship to the mangrove and disembarked at Grove 41 in order to find a coating mechanic friend of Hatchan's,
   Silvers Rayleigh
   , to coat the ship.
   However, through a series of unexpected events, the crew of the Thousand Sunny ended up causing a large ruckus. Fortunately in the midst of the mess they caused, the crew found the mechanic.

   Having gotten the aid of Rayleigh, the ship was ready to be coated. However due to the mess that the crew caused, the mangrove was no longer safe. Considering the number of Marine troops and a Marine
   Admiral
   that were sent to the mangrove to clean up the mess, the crew decided to temporarily leave the Thousand Sunny in Rayleigh's hands. Knowing that staying on the ship at this time would bring only trouble while the mechanic modified her, the crew thought it best to wait it out in the mangrove as the mechanic did his job. Giving the crew his

   coated
   the ship. Slowly but surely, the crew of the Thousand Sunny came back to Sabaody. Upon returning to the ship,
   Franky
   modified her with what he acquired from Vegapunk's lab. The ship also had a buoyancy sack placed underneath it, so he would not sink once coated. A bubble, caused by Franky redirecting the air in the bag formed around the ship's deck, allowing the Straw Hats to breathe while the ship is submerged. The ship went under the water and the crew head for Fish-Man Island.

However, during Luffy's final battle with Mad Treasure, they ended up giving Bonbori a massive stomachache, forcing the giant football fish to regurgitate. The Thousand Sunny carrying all the Straw Hats, plus Olga, Elizabeth used the flow caused by Bonbori's dry heaves to accelerate to its mouth, then used Coup de Burst to fly out of its mouth just at the moment of its regurgitation.

      When the ship went through the rainstorm that poured down candy instead of rain, the pun used was "ame". Depending on how it is written, the Japanese word
      <i key="4ea037d5-e70c-4bf8-b3d1-fd23e9a1ee41">
       ame
      </i>
      can mean either "rain" (雨) or "candy" (飴). Thus there is a pun when the Straw Hats stated candy was falling instead of rain in Japanese. They are basically saying that a certain thing is falling down instead of another thing that sounds alike in English (though emphasis is put on different vowels, "A" for 'rain' and "E" for 'candy').

      The circular rainbow and the serpent currents comes from ancient Japanese mythology and folklore. In ancient times, the Japanese often associated rainbows as bad omens signifying the coming of serpents. The scene where the Straw Hats see a circular rainbow just before suddenly encountering the serpent currents is based on this myth.

    The Thousand Sunny's lion figurehead being mistaken for a sunflower is part of a running gag involving sunflowers and lions. The gag first appeared with Nami's dress when she was young. The dress originally had a sunflower design but Bell-mère stitched on some eyes and a mouth in order to make it a lion.
    This gag is also featured in the cover art of a chapter with Zoro trying to capture a lion who is hiding behind him among a bunch of sunflowers.
