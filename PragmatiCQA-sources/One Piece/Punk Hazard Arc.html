    Brook

    Binks' Sake

    Sanji
    tells Luffy that he managed to cut off some meat, but the fish that they had caught had been burnt to a crisp by the sea of flames. Usopp is concerned about the Sunny, but
    Franky
    assures him that the ship will not lose. Suddenly, Luffy hears the
    Den Den Mushi
    ringing, but
    Robin
    states that there is a 50% chance that the distress signal is merely an ambush set by the
    Marines

    Vice Admiral
    Smoker
    is commenting that while there were three islands the Straw Hats could have gone to, but they have somehow gone to Punk Hazard, which was closed off due to an incident four years ago. Back at the Sunny, the crewmates draw straws to see who will go with Luffy. Zoro, Robin and Usopp get the "winning" straws. Sanji hands Luffy a deep-sea fish lunchbox, and Nami forms a cloud road over the flames and the adventure party sets out on the
    Mini Merry II

   Despite Usopp's fear, the crew enters, finding it blazing-hot with most of the buildings melted. Looking at the structures,
    Robin
    deduces the buildings to be a former government base. As they walk along, Usopp comments on how strange it is that the man on the
    Den Den Mushi
    remarked on the coldness of the island despite the intense heat.

   Suddenly, they turn around and see a monster that they thought could only exist in fairy tales: a
    dragon
    . The dragon seemingly talks, and asks who they are.
    Suddenly, the dragon attacks, breathing fire, forcing the
    Straw Hats
    to escape the attack. Luffy attacks the dragon but hardly deals any damage because the dragon's scales are so hard. The dragon sends Luffy flying and Zoro starts attacking it, only to discover that not only is the dragon resistant to damage but also strong. It seemingly starts to speak again, asking them if they are allies with "that
    Warlord of the Sea
    ". Luffy rockets up to the dragon's back and makes it bite its wing, wounding it and noticing some human legs on the dragon's head. Zoro is then shot into the air by Usopp and decapitates the dragon with a single slash.

    prepares a special dish for Nami, only to realize that everybody on the ship was asleep. He realizes the scent of gas on the ship. He attempts to contact Luffy's group via a Den Den Mushi, but before reaching it, he also falls asleep. Afterwards, some strange people appear on the ship and decide to take the pirates, except for

They then notice there are pieces of a head in the room with them. They put the head together (although his top of head and chin reversed), and the head tells them that he was cut up by someone he does not know. After finding out that they are
    pirates
    , the head exclaims that he hates pirates so much they make him sick. The head then reveals to them where they are, the frozen half of Punk Hazard. The crew decides to break out, so Franky uses his Radical Beam to blow the door down. Sanji picks up the head and arranges him correctly, revealing to be a samurai.

Luffy once again asks the centaur to join his crew, which he is scolded for by the other members; excluding Robin. The centaur then asks his boss to finish off the crew, and Usopp recognizes the term as the same one from from the distress call they received via the Den Den Mushi. The

    Rosward
    incident, and fought with him and
    Eustass Kid
    against the Marines. Then he recalls Law's rescue of Luffy from
    Marineford
    . Law tells Smoker that he knows of the forgery of emergency signals, but Smoker tells him that the distress call is real, to which Law replies that he knows nothing, so there is nothing to talk about. Smoker then asks Law to let him see the inside of the research facility, but Law tells him no, because it is currently his vacation home. Law tells Smoker if he sees Luffy on the island, he will hunt him down, and that there is nothing to worry about, so they should leave.

   Nami's group then suddenly bursts out of the facility, which surprises everybody. Franky then busts out of the facility in his Armored Me tank form, with Sanji and the samurai head, and two children with him. The G-5 Marines, were stunned, stating that they cannot even begin to name what is weird there. Chopper then recognizes Law from
    Sabaody Archipelago
    , and accuses him of kidnapping the children, and says that Law will never get them back. Sanji also notices Smoker and Tashigi, who wonder to themselves why there are kids here. Realizing that there are Marines blocking their part, the Straw Hats redirect the children back into the facility, and tell them to go towards the back door.

   Around four years ago, a chemical experiment failed and destroyed two of the three labs which make up the ruins of the island. The gas released from the explosion killed the plant life and the laboratories' personnel fled, leaving behind the prisoners. Those that were in the untouched facility survived and holed up there but those unlucky few on the outside were paralyzed from the legs down by the nerve gas. Then one year later, their master, Caesar, appeared, cured them of the poison with his powers and made devices that allowed them to float off the ground.

    Kureha

    Usopp

    doctor
    to come with him, Law was mortified when Usopp tied Chopper to his hat, while the rest of the crew laughs. Chopper is then tied to his nodachi instead. Law begins to explain about

The story flashes back to an hour earlier when they had begun their search when they spotted giant footprints in the ground thinking it belong to a snowman. They followed the trail leading them to a cliff. However, it was an ambush by the
    Yeti Cool Brothers
    who had shot them with gas that caused them to become
    drunk

Zoro managed to remain awake long enough to cut the cliff in half for them to fall safely before passing out in midair.

    Straw Hats
    agree to go into the lake to retrieve it. When asked why pirates are going to all the trouble to help him, Sanji comments he just felt it as their responsibility and that when he gets his body back, they will have a fight.

Rather than purify the gas like he told his subordinates, Caesar had compressed the poisonous gas and turned it into a monster to be used for his whims. Meanwhile at the lab's front door, the G-5 unit is still battling Caesar's guards, successfully managing to capture a ship. However Tashigi is trying to get a handle on Smoker's

Smoker, seeing this, attacks Luffy from behind to Luffy's surprise that "Tashigi" got much stronger. Robin then points out that their bodies were switched causing Luffy to laugh when he realizes who "Tashigi" is.

One of the Marines suggest pushing it into the water and stupidly tries to do so but get sucked into the slime. His fellow comrades pull him out with the Marine yelling he cannot feel his face.

Because it does not like water, it is throwing itself piece by piece to their area to avoid the lake.

The G-5 Marines repair the hole with boards and metal, then attempt to arrest Zoro, Brook, Usopp, Kin'emon, Nami (In Sanji's body), Sanji (in Nami's body) and Brownbeard. They are interrupted by Luffy, who asks if they are ready to start. Nami then asks Law if he can switch her back into her own body, along with Sanji (Sanji is obviously not happy about this) and Law agrees. Nami punches Sanji for peeping on her body by changing coats (in truth he had taken it off to dive into the lake to retrieve Kin'emon's upper body). Sanji notices he feels weaker which Usopp notes was from getting blown up by Caesar's explosive gas.

   Law then requests everybody's attention, and tells them that to escape the laboratory they need to find a door with "R Building 66" on it. He gives them two hours and says after that he will do something to the base to make it unsafe. They then all split up. Kin'emon says he needs to rescue his
    son
    , and Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Brook, and Usopp go along with him. Smoker orders the G-5 Marines to rescue the abducted children, look for the "R Building 66" door and that they will seize the tanker at the harbor. Luffy goes alone to defeat Caesar, and
    Robin
    stays with Law, most likely to look for the door. Smoker goes to confront
    Vergo
    , and tells Tashigi to go look after the G-5 who are chasing the Straw Hats, and to help everyone escape. Meanwhile, Usopp and Zoro exchange their stories of defeat by Caesar and the
    Yeti Cool Brothers
    respectively. Zoro cites they need to be more careful, warning that he is not joking and yells to Luffy "The New World starts here."

Vergo takes it to mean that they escaped and sure enough one of Caesar's men report this to the the group.
    Chopper
    , who was listening, heads down the hall relieved that Luffy and the others are alright. He notes the paper that was thrown to him has an escape route. He mentions he also found out how the

   Luffy is already headlong into Building A, knocking away the guards who come against him. He reaches the connecting passageway just as an alarm starts to go off. Law and Smoker arrive shortly after with Law realizing what Caesar is up to. At the lab entrance, the G-5 Marines ignore Law's warning and try to arrest the Straw Hats. Brook, Zoro and Kin'emon attack them to get them out of the way. Usopp, Sanji and Nami (later joined by Robin who stayed with them on Luffy's orders) are still on Brownbeard who rushes past the marines. Brownbeard notes the dragon that was with them and ponders why they brought it along with Sanji explaining they had used it to escape the gas but it does not seem to fly now as it is sedated. Nami, oddly enough, finds it rather cute.

   The Marines continue their assault, but just as Zoro is about to strike them. Tashigi jumps in and block his attack. Begrudgingly allowing Zoro to pass her as she tells her men they have other concerns at the moment with the building's gate closing. The Marines agree and everyone rushes for the gate. Just as they do, a cannon from outside the building fires and hits the wall, letting the gas in. Everyone makes a mad dash and jumps through the gate. Brownbeard, the Straw Hat Pirates and some of the G-5 soldiers make it through as well as Tashigi. However it is revealed she was thrown by a few of her subordinates who were lingering behind. Tashigi tries to go back to rescue them but is told it is too late. One of the fellow Marines compliment those that could not make it on saving their Captain. As the gate closes, they see that the men caught in the gas giving thumbs up poses as they were frozen much to Tashigi's dismay and sorrow for their sacrifice while the Straw Hats stare disgusted over what occurred.

   Caesar monitors this, angry he did not dispose of his intended targets. He vows that he will not let anyone escape. The Straw Hat Pirates and Kin'emon are now all riding on Brownbeard's back now (to his annoyance) plow on ahead while the Marines tailing behind. As they continue to press forward, the marines are attacked by the dragon from before, only now it's much more feral and dangerous. However it suddenly flies off in the midst of its assault and Vergo suddenly appears. The Marines are happy to see him at first thinking he is leading reinforcements. Tashigi, having seen firsthand that he is a traitor, warns them to get away from him. Vergo lays waste to the Marines, much to their confusion. Tashigi tries to attack him, but he easily dispatches her, forcing Sanji to double back and come to her aid. The dragon soon targets Brownbeard and the Straw Hats. Meanwhile, Caesar plans to destroy Building B and allow the gas in, which would also kill Vergo. Luffy and Smoker, having reached Caesar at last, break in the door and Luffy assaults Caesar with a

   Chopper explains to Mocha about Caesar's deception and using the kids for his experiments and how if Caesar continues to use them, the children will die before they reach adulthood. Mocha remembers her friends promising to each other that when they get older, they will reunite and go on an adventure. The gravity of the situation becomes clear to Mocha but Chopper promises that he and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates will save her. Mocha vows not to let any of the kids get the candy and runs off to guard the room just as the children burst in. Back in the present, Mocha begins coughing up blood, due to the serious overdose of the drug. The other children stop upon seeing her condition and unsure what to do now. As Chopper, Nami and Robin rush to Mocha, Sanji and the G-5 Marines finally arrive and begin subduing and sedating the kids. The Marines has Mocha moved to an examination room, to which Chopper is grateful for, complimenting Mocha on her bravery and hoping that he can save her.

Caesar's men begin to question Brownbeard about what he is doing, and then he reveals to them that Caesar called them guinea pigs for his experiment, but before he is able to do this, Caesar injects him with a muscle relaxant, which prevents Brownbeard from moving and slurs his speech. Caesar then quietly reveals to Brownbeard that he abandoned his men outside, and that him, their savior, was the one who caused the explosion that almost killed everyone four years ago.

   informs the rest of the crew about the alliance he formed with Law's
    crew
    and his intention of dethroning the
    Emperor
    . Also with them is Caesar who they have dragged along who continues making threats against them. Law explains that the Four Emperors have spheres of influence all over the
    New World
    but are underground so as not to attract the Marines' attention. One of their most trustworthy brokers is Doflamingo who uses the alias Joker so no one will suspect him. He is also the biggest supplier to
    Kaidou
    of the
    Artificial Devil Fruits
    , SMILEs, which is why Law wanted Caesar kidnapped and destroyed the drug
    SAD
    to decrease Kaidou's battle power.
    Their objective now is to get to Dressrosa and destroy the factory where the SMILEs are being manufactured to cripple Kaidou further. Kin'emon also wishes to head to the island as a friend of his is being incarcerated there.

   Back on Punk Hazard, Smoker has been beaten and about to be killed by Doflamingo who says he will find the Straw Hat Pirates and Law without his help. Just as he is about to strike the killing blow,
    Kuzan
    suddenly shows up and halts him, stating that Smoker is his friend.

   Despite Kuzan's presence, Doflamingo continues with his attempt to kill Smoker anyway but is quickly frozen by Kuzan's
    Devil Fruit ability
    . However, he manages to break free. Seeing nothing to gain from engaging Kuzan, Doflamingo takes his leave, but not before questioning Kuzan what he stands for due to rumors he had heard. Kuzan does not answer him and calls for a medic. Doflamingo collects Baby 5 and Buffalo and departs. Only then does Kuzan state that even though he is not enlisted in the Marines anymore, he never completely trusted the
    World Government
    and that he can still make a difference outside the Marines. Smoker inquires about how he knew of Punk Hazard as it's top secret, worrying that he's doing business with the criminal underworld but Kuzan tells him he has not changed. He also warns Smoker to advise
    Sakazuki
    to keep an eye on Doflamingo as he poses the biggest threat to the Marines and also requests the G-5 Marines promise not to reveal he was there.
