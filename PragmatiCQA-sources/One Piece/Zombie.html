    Overview

  </h2>
  <p key="ccab86d2-1154-43ae-9597-5183c5b8bebf">
   The various creatures on the island are created through a process that involves Moria's Kage Kage no Mi and Hogback's surgical skills. First, a victim is captured and then brought before Moria. Using his
   Devil Fruit
   powers, Moria grabs a hold of the victim's shadow and cuts it from the owner using a pair of scissors. The shadow is then implanted into one of the hundreds of corpses that are kept in storage,
   while the victim falls into a two-day coma. Strong warriors who had their shadows stolen are placed on their ships and set adrift to ensure that they do not come back and retake their shadows.
  </p>
  <p key="06e2fa2d-d987-4bb9-9713-bf00d1b1508f">
   A zombie created through this process retains the personality and abilities of the person whose shadow it belongs to. The zombie's strength, however, depends on the body it uses. When a strong shadow and a strong corpse are combined, an even stronger zombie is created. For this reason, Hogback has collected and stitched together hundreds of corpses to make strong creatures. This is best shown by the Zombie Generals, whose bodies have been created from the various remains of famous warriors. However, zombies made with shadows of people of high levels of strength can be difficult to control at first.
  </p>
  <p key="dc9a06a8-9b03-432d-b232-c7f058e9c9f3">
   Though there were a lot of zombies on Thriller Bark, they can cease activity and need replacements. This can happen when the original owners of the shadows animating them die, when the zombies are purified with salt, or when Moria removes the shadow. To replace these losses, newer zombies are created from the entire corpses or individual body parts of the older zombies that were lost.
  </p>
  <p key="3c63a9fa-343a-482a-b7b5-c1ebd2204c28">
   Although the zombies are mostly directly commanded by one of the Mysterious Four, they are all subordinate to Moria first and are expected to follow his orders.

  <p key="96e6dadc-b6fa-4642-85d2-177e5098fb5e">
   Many of the creatures on the island have a number written on them. The importance of this number is to tell which rank or groups they belong to. The numbers are usually written on the creature itself - either on the head, stomach, back or side of the creature. A few of the zombies had it written on a band around their arm.
  </p>
  <p key="0e36cd33-7880-4177-8a0d-d59ac664d74f">
   While the numbers represent of which rank a zombie would be placed, newer zombies can have a lower number despite the order they were created in relation to other zombies. This is because these newer zombies are created to fill in the holes left by zombies that are either purified or destroyed.
  </p>
  <p key="81c1390c-7acc-4e71-86fb-128ae15aed76">
   The numbers ranges of the Zombie ranks are as follows:

   While a zombie inherits the skills and memories of the shadow animating them, they do not inherit any Devil Fruit powers if the shadow belonged to a Devil Fruit user. Moria, can make up for their inability to perform any Devil Fruit based attacks to an extent by implanting his own shadow into the zombie's shadow. From there, he can manipulate the zombie's shape via a reverse form of shadow puppetry called

   Zombies are completely impervious to conventional methods such as beheading. Though some of them sometimes act like they are in pain when hit or feel tired as if they lost stamina, all zombies are actually immune to such things. When a zombie expresses such things it is not because they are in pain or tired, it is because the shadow animating them still remembers such feelings when they were originally attached to their original owners. Eventually, these memories of feeling pain and such will be completely forgotten thus rendering any zombie capable of functioning without expressing such things at all. Zombies are thus tireless creations who seemingly cannot be stopped no matter how hard or how long one fights against them.

   While zombies seem to be unbeatable creatures, they do have weaknesses. When salt is thrown into a zombie's mouth, the shadow moving the corpse is detached and the zombie is purified. Because salt is a property of sea water and since the shadow was attached due to a Devil Fruit power, the shadow is naturally released. Though depending on the size of the zombie (eg. Oars) a bag of salt isn't enough to purify the zombie. A zombie's body may also be burned in order to release the shadow, as seen when Zoro set the samurai Ryuma alight, returning Brook's shadow to him once the body had finished burning. Zombies also remain "alive" as long the person whose shadow they use remains alive. If the person dies, so will his shadow. According to Brook, this is because the shadow and the person, though separated, are still of one soul. For this, Moria and his associates ensure that their victims will not die.
  </p>
  <p key="17a71376-25e7-466a-a7bb-b80b6dc14af0">
   Another weakness could be attributed as an error by the zombie's creator. The zombies strength are based on putting strong shadows into stronger Mario's to create the strongest zombies. However should the creators misjudge the strength of the original shadow's owner, they may actually place the shadow in a weaker corpse, thus creating a zombie which is inferior to the original. An example would be
   Inuppe
   , who possessed
   <a href="Sanji.html" key="c4362758-a71e-4f6f-b430-af116313d680" title="Sanji">

   's shadow. Though Sanji is a fighter with strength comparable to
   <a href="Roronoa Zoro.html" key="e381dfe5-f982-443c-b59c-36544d8f95a1" title="Roronoa Zoro">
    Zoro
   </a>
   , due to the confusion caused by his
   Wanted Poster
   , they mistook him for a grunt and put his shadow in an ill-suited Wild Zombie. Even though Inuppe possessed all the other strengths of a zombie, due to having a stubby body unsuited to wield Sanji's
   Black Leg Style
   , it actually fell short of Sanji's full potential.

   While a zombie's greatest strength is being not able to feel pain, it is also their greatest weak point. Because a zombie is unable to feel pain, they are unable gauge how badly damaged their body can or has become in a battle. This action inadvertently leads to their downfall as they would continue fighting non-stop without taking any time to heal or fix their wounds. With this, their wounds can build up and become massive, and can eventually cause a zombie to become unable to move their body at all. They can still function even when their bodies are completely broken. However, they can no longer fight despite still having the will to do so.

   The animals, upon seeing them free, attempted to capture them. They were however stopped by the new penguin zombie. After being beaten several times by the dog penguin, they were commanded by Absalom, who had arrived there, to not harm Nami. They replied to him saying that they only obey Perona per Moria's order. They however decide to back down as Absalom reminds them to fear him also as he takes out the dog penguin.
   Despite being animals, they fight with normal weapons such as swords, axes, and maces.

   Though most of the Soldier Zombies are generally grunts with no distinguishing traits other than design, there are some that stand out more than others. Cindry appears to belong to this group of zombies, even though she seems somewhat different from them both in design and mannerisms.

The zombies are afraid of fire and in reply called Usopp a pyromaniac for attacking them with a fire star. Despite normally limping and moaning around like typical zombies, they are capable of running at great speeds. Unfortunately, they tire out easily.

   Later, the rest of the Straw Hats encountered these creatures, though their reactions to them were completely different from Nami, Usopp, and Chopper's previous encounters.

   Absalom reassured the zombies they actually need not fear being burnt, fatigued, or pained, as it is all in their minds as they are dead. The zombies, with the advent of the attack about to begin, were joined by the majority of the other Soldier Zombies in the island and gathered in the area in front of the Mast Mansion.

   The remaining Soldier Zombies stayed far away from the Mast Mansion and watched the gigantic battle between the Straw Hats and
   Oars
   . Upon seeing Oars being beaten up by Luffy and hearing that their master, Moria, had entered the battle, they were shocked in disbelief of what was happening. After Oars was pulverized, they were ecstatic to see that their master survived. However, their joy, as well as their existence, was put to an end as they watched in horror as Moria took away the shadows animating them to power himself up.
   The Soldier Zombies, as well as the other zombies, then returned to being lifeless corpses.

   Kumashi is a strange looking stuffed bear that was first seen in Perona's room when her ghosts came back to her body.
   Perona tells it that it should talk less if it wants to continue working for her since she finds its voice uncute. As a result, he wears a surgical mask around his mouth. He is based off of the stuffed toy bear that Perona brought with her when she met Hogback ten years prior to the current storyline.
   He served as the commander of the Wild Zombies under Perona's command.

   is a zombie that is basically a block of stone with arms stitched on. Its most distinguishing feature is a human face stretched out and stitched to its surface. It first appeared by the order of Buhichuck to block a doorway in order to prevent Luffy and the two Straw Hats with him from escaping from the Zombie Generals.
   It may be based on the
   nurikabe
   from Japanese folklore.

   The tailor zombie is a zombie that serves as the tailor on Thriller Bark. He is a short old man with gray hair and wears a red bowtie. He was also able to remove his eye from its socket. He was first seen when Absalom carried in an unconscious Nami in to take her measurements for the wedding dress. Upon being asked about the wedding preparations, he responded by stating that they were ready as always.
   In the anime, a scene is added in which he whips the two painting zombies with his tape measure to prevent them from peeping on Nami as he changed her into her wedding dress. He does this as he knows that Absalom was secretly still in the room waiting to see Nami be changed and so warns the paintings that they would be in trouble if they actually saw Nami being changed.

   It first appeared in the group of Wild Zombies that appeared in Perona's Wonder Garden and has been frequently seen among them since.
   In the anime, the kangaroo is given more screen time as he engages Usopp in a boxing match. However, rather than punch Usopp, he accidentally punches Zombies #52 and #154. As a result, he gives chase to both Usopp and Nami across some stairs along with several small Wild Zombies. Although, they were able to escape by jumping onto a separate column, Usopp decided to taunt the Zebra Kangaroo. This causes it to be angered and it decides to jump across the columns to reach the two. Ultimately, it is shot down by Usopp mid-air as it was jumping towards them.
   Later, it appears to have recovered from its fall and appears in Perona's room when Zoro, Sanji, Franky and Usopp stumble in.

Upon seeing this beast, Nami tried to convince Usopp and Chopper of what she saw with an apparently bad drawing (which somewhat looked like
   Mohji

   Comparisons between this manticore's lion faced stitches and Absalom's were often noted. Oda later confirmed that the Manticore's face was indeed used on Absalom's face by Hogback. However, the Manticore's human face was never Absalom's. Absalom's human face may be on another zombie elsewhere. While answering this question, Oda also noted that Absalom has very few Japanese fans and was reluctant to say more on the matter.
