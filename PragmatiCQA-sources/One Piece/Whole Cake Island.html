   The island is quite large, and until about 62 years ago, it was a regular island with several round hills. It was renamed to "Whole Cake Island" due to
   Charlotte Linlin
   and
   Streusen
   working to fulfill the former's dream, which was inherited from
   Carmel
   , and its new resemblance to a gathering of frosted cakes are due to the enormous cake buildings constructed there. Due to the buildings' enormous size, visitors tend to be awed at the first sight of the island. Atop the largest central building, the Whole Cake Chateau, there are massive poles shaped like candles, making it look like a birthday cake (being even depicted as lit, although it is unknown if their "flames" are real and the anime implies that they are trees). Most buildings appear to be covered in what looks like icing. The interiors of buildings in general look as if they are partly made of icing.

   homies

   Contrary to its seemingly merry atmosphere at first glance, the forest has a strong sense of maliciousness, as there are skeletons of past wanderers laying around, and the trees and other homies constantly move around to block off exit routes and evermore shift the forest's very layout to confuse their visitors, regarding it as a "Game of Death", joyfully singing about how those visitors' brutal deaths might look like. In fact, the Homies, led by Baum, will not let go of unauthorized visitors relatively regardless of how strong they are. There is also a strong interference with magnetic fields to prevent visitors from finding a way out via
   Log Poses
   (seemingly due to strange clocks secured on some tree homies, whose clock hands spin uncontrollably).

   That night, while the citizens of Whole Cake Island prepared for the wedding, the Straw Hats met with the Fire Tank Pirates to form an alliance to assassinate Big Mom and rescue the Vinsmoke Family.
   In the morning, the tea party and wedding ceremony then started on top of the Chateau,
   and before the Big Mom Pirates could assassinate the Vinsmokes, Luffy burst out of the Wedding Cake and invaded the venue.
   During the chaos that followed, Brook shattered Big Mom's portrait of Mother Carmel,
   causing her to have a crisis and weakening her.
   However, Big Mom foiled the Fire Tanks' assassination attempt by screaming, and the Big Mom Pirates lay siege to the Straw Hat-Fire Tank alliance.
   Even when the Vinsmoke Family joined their side

   The alliance parted ways,

   As the Big Mom Pirates strategized, Big Mom started craving for wedding cake, causing her eating disorder to act up. She went on a rampage through Sweet City, and Perospero lied that the Straw Hats had a backup cake, causing Big Mom to go and pursue them through the Seducing Woods. The Big Mom Pirates split their forces to go after the alliance factions,
   and several of them joined Big Mom in her chase of the Straw Hats.
   However, Nami managed to use Big Mom's homie Zeus to strike the Big Mom Pirates with a massive lightning bolt,
   although that did not stop Big Mom.
   The Sanji Retrieval Team made it to the Thousand Sunny on the coast, and they fought the Big Mom Pirates that were stationed there. Perospero managed to trap the Sunny and a blockade was called in to shoot the ship down. However, Pedro severely injured Perospero in a suicidal explosion,
   freeing the Sunny, and the Straw Hats used Coup de Burst to fly over the blockade, escaping from Whole Cake Island.

   As the situation at Cacao Island escalated, Mont-d'Or desperately asked for Perospero to report Big Mom's status. Afterwords, Mont-d'Or learned about Morgans and Stussy's departure and ordered his crew to capture them before Morgans could report the recent events.
   After Big Mom ate the cake, the news of her calming down spread across Totto Land, as the citizens celebrated.
   Despite their efforts, the Big Mom Pirates failed to prevent the Straw Hats' escape, which angered Mont-d'Or.
