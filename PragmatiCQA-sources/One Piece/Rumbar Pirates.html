   While the Jolly Roger on the ship's sails is the Rumbar Pirates' Jolly Roger, in the anime however, the ship is shown with a completely different Jolly Roger when it originally appeared and in the episodes following after it.
  </p>
  <p key="acef5a49-e5b0-48f6-a2d0-08dffccdbb86">
   This error originates from how the design of the Jolly Roger was slowly revealed in the manga. In the scenes in the manga before Brook revealed himself as a Rumbar Pirate, the Jolly Roger was originally obscured by fog. This was done in order to not reveal prematurely Brook's true identity. Because the episodes where his ship has a different Jolly Roger were made before his revelation, the animators used a different Jolly Roger based on what could be made out from the manga at the time.
  </p>
  <p key="7be3be31-5658-44f1-9cd2-58f80fe25213">
   Though this error is prevalent in most of the episodes before Brook's revelation, a later episode in the anime, that was made after Brook's revelation in the manga, corrects the error by showing a Jolly Roger like the one in manga though albeit obscured by fog.

   50 years before the beginning of the main storyline, the Rumbar Pirates travelled in the West Blue. One day, they found a baby whale following them. Seeing he was alone and sad they decided to play music to/for him, in order to cheer him up. The next day they thought he was gone but they found him again.

   During a fierce fight with enemy pirates, several crewmembers fell into the sea, none of which could be saved. It was at this time the baby whale helped them. While spending time with Laboon some of the crewmembers thought he liked
   Brook
   the musician because they were near-identical (Brook's afro made him look like a whale). Before the Rumbar Pirates ventured into the Grand Line, fifty years ago, they decided it was no place for Laboon; even if he was an adult he would not even compare to the monsters in the Grand Line. By the orders of the captain they were to ignore him hoping he would go away. At the entrance they befriended the lighthouse caretaker

   who pointed out that Laboon had followed them asking if it was their pet, to everyone's shock. They decided to stay for some time. After three months time of repairs to their ship and resupplying, the crew finally decided to move on. After making an agreement with Crocus to take care of Laboon while they were gone, all crew members made their farewell to Laboon, with a promise to return in a few years time after sailing all the way around the Grand Line.

   However their return was not to be. They traveled far into the Grand Line, experiencing its cruel sea and unpredictable weather, but had good times as well. They would also think about Laboon from time to time. Days went by, and at some point after coming out of a certain forest,
   Yorki
   , their captain, and several of the crewmembers had contracted an incurable disease. Deciding no one else should be infected, Yorki traveled away with the sick crewmembers on their ship and hoped to pass through the
   Calm Belt
   . It was at that point most of them died, which was later reported and led Crocus to believe that they had become scared and left through the Calm Belt.

   doctor
   was killed in the attack, the survivors were slowly dying. Knowing that he had eaten the
   Yomi Yomi no Mi
   , Brook suggested to his crew that they should play one last song that would be recorded on a
   Tone Dial
   that they had previously bought from a merchant. Since he would be revived after death, Brook promised them that he would take the Dial and play it for Laboon to hear.

   Overjoyed with Brook's proposal, the remaining Rumbar Pirates mustered what little strength they had and started singing their favorite song for the last time. Though joyful at recording their song, the remaining Rumbar Pirates slowly succumbed to the poison and died one after another. They each fell with smiles on their faces until only Brook was left all alone. With a heavy heart, Brook continued playing alone until he too succumbed to the poison and died.

   After a year of searching, the soul of Brook found the Rumbar Pirates' ship and his body, which had decomposed to bones. Resurrected as a skeleton, Brook put his comrades' remains in coffins. However, Brook remained ever aware of his crew's inability to keep their promise to Laboon.

   Fifty years after the incident in the Florian Triangle, the
   Straw Hat Pirates
   met up with Laboon as they entered the Grand Line themselves. There, they rescued Laboon from
   Mr. 9
   and
   Miss Wednesday
   , who were trying to kill the whale as food for their village. The Straw Hats found out that in order to take care of the giant whale, Crocus has installed several things inside of Laboon, including his own house floating in the stomach acid.

   They were told the story of the Rumbar Pirates and how they never returned to Laboon. Crocus believed they became scared and left through the Calm Belt, only to be killed there. In order to stop Laboon from hurting himself, Luffy drew his
   Jolly Roger
   on his scars and told him he would come back one day.

   During the adventures around
   Thriller Bark
   and
   Florian Triangle
   , the Straw Hat Pirates met with Brook, and eventually learned of his connection with Laboon. Luffy revealed to Brook that Laboon was alright and still waiting for him. Hearing this, Brook burst into tears. He then proceeded to play the Tone Dial recording made right before the crew died. The others joined in the singing as Brook thought of his promise to Laboon. Brook then stopped the Tone Dial and said it was no longer used for reminiscing but to be brought to Laboon. Brook then asked to join Luffy's crew and was accepted. During this time, Laboon roared out to Crocus, who remarked that Laboon was unnaturally happy that day.

    The name of the crew appears to be a combination of two similar words in a pun. The first term, "Rumba", refers to a family of music rhythms and dance styles that originated in Africa. The second term, "Lumbar", is a section of the body around the abdomen, known for the bones and spinal cord that exist there as part of the skeletal system. Due to the love of the music by the crew as well as due to Brook himself (whose skeleton, including his lumbar bones, are exposed due to the affect of the Yomi Yomi no Mi), it is presumed the two words were combined to define the name of the crew.

    Despite being wiped out for about half-a-century, the

    kept track of the crew's information, as they managed to trace Brook's connections based on the past bounty poster.
