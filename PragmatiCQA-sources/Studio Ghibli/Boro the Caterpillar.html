   The director had this idea since he was in elementary school. As he was taught how photosynthesis works, he wondered how the smallest insects could perceive it. If a caterpillar could see the particles in the air, if the leaves tasted like jelly when it nibbled on them. Or, if from his point of view, a bee looked like a drone flying over a battlefield.

   The project took on several lives before finally making it into animation. The first was on a special Ghibli Museum display "panoramic box", an ancestor installation to Disney Studios' multi-plane camera. It can be found in the permanent exhibition room on the ground floor of the Ghibli museum. In the mid-2000s, when it was decided that three new short films would be produced for the Ghibli Museum, Miyazaki took the opportunity to make a short film based on this old project. He changed his mind at the last minute and favored a similar concept which is also based on a panoramic box display, namely,

   Toshio Suzuki suggested that the short film could be finalized in spring 2017. In April 2017, he confirmed that it would be shown at the Ghibli Museum by July. By the month of July 2017, the film had missed its deadline.
