   Haru
   , a quiet and shy high school student who has a suppressed ability to talk with cats. One day, she sleeps through her alarm is late for class and is laughed at by practically everyone for trying to sneak in.  While walking home, she admits to her friend Naoko that she actually likes a boy in her class named Machida but is too shy to ask him out.  While walking, the girls notice a cat with a gift box crossing the street, while crossing the road the light turns green, and using her lacrosse stick, Haru saves a Russian Blue odd-eyed cat from being hit by a truck on a busy road. The cat stands up and thanks Haru for saving him, Haru is too surprised to even respond.  After the cat leaves, Haru tells her friend that the cat spoke but she doesn't believe Haru.  Later she tells her mother and her mother remembers how Haru once said she could talk to cats especially when she was younger, she gave a stray cat some fish crackers.  That night, the king of the Cat Kingdom comes to thank her for saving his only son.  As it turns out, the cat's name is
   Lune
   , and he is the Prince of the Cat Kingdom. As thanks, the Cat King gives Haru a list of gifts she'll receive.  The are gifts of Lacrosse sticks, cattails, catnip and mice. Later that day she takes Naoko's place to clean up so she could go to her boyfriends ping pong game.  While Haru takes out the trash, she notices Machida talking to his girlfriend and Haru trips and makes a mess,  While paying Haru a visit, she chews out the king's servant for all the gifts because they only appealed to cats and she tells him they haven't made things better for her.  He tries to assure that they were trying to make her happy, he also invites her to the kingdom and she is even being offered the Prince's hand in marriage (although this was in the King's idea). Her mixed reply is mistaken as a yes and tells her he'll pick her up tonight.  While does try to tell him that wasn't her answer she falls again.

To divert all of this Baron invites Haru in for some tea which she finds delicious, according to Baron each time he makes it it's different.  Muta tells her that the Cat Kingdom is no place you should be if you don't trust yourself.  Baron actually suggests that he and Muta go there themselves and while Muta declines Baron is able to change is mentioning that they can discuss this over some cake.  Toto in the meantime gets some of his special mulberries.  Baron tells Haru to always believe in herself, if she does she will be less scared.  While Baron prepping the cake with Muta the King's servant comes and as a result, Haru and (soon Muta) are forcefully taken to the Cat Kingdom, leaving Toto and the Baron in the human world to follow the group from the air. The Baron and his crow friend find the entrance to the Cat Kingdom on Earth: Five lakes forming a cat's paw.

Then I created the frame for the story, the core of which is Haru's strange experience. The charm of imaginary tales lies in their unique and original vision of the world. I like the imagination,and I often read this kind of books. But when I had to write such a story myself, I wondered what worldview to create. Thus was born the Kingdom of cats. I made it into a world where everything is possible, nothing is really important.

   In order to portray the Baron, I imagined a story written by
   Shizuku
   , the heroine of "Whisper of the Heart", who would have been a grown up. This completed story is published under the title "Baron: The Cat Returns". On the occasion of this publication, I wanted to put: “Author: Shizuku Tsukishima - Drawings: Aoi Hiiragi." But it was an unrealistic idea and I backed out. Now that you know its genesis, I hope, as the author of the original work, that you enjoy seeing the cartoon and reading the comic. And I would be happy if you thought about what happiness is in the company of Haru."

   Unfortunately the story Hiiragi has developed was much longer than originally intended. In addition, the theme park that commissioned Ghibli withdrew its request due to economic problems.

  </p>
  <p key="480e15ca-297c-464a-b1b9-4c6efdb17317">
   When asked what were the challenges he faced, Morita elaborated, "Girls' comics focus on the feelings, desires of girls. But it is imperceptible. It remains vague. In dealing with this kind of subject, it is inevitably difficult to remain objective. But I stopped doubting and decided to reason in the opposite direction. If this story is to be made into a movie, what kind of girl will Haru be? How will the Cat Bureau be? the Baron? And Muta?"
  </p>
  <p key="935f03c1-e479-474b-ad15-62305671570c">
   The character design was entrusted to renowned animator Satoko Morikawa, whose work remained faithful to its source manga. However, the designs lacked a level of detail and complexity found in previous Ghibli films. The designs of the Baron and Muta remained faithful to what was already present in "Whisper of the Heart", and the animation conveyed a strong sense of personality. Muta himself is based on Ushiko, the resident cat who wanders inside Studio Ghibli's offices.
  </p>
  <p key="5fc8ce9e-dfdd-446d-9a2a-0765cd4e2df2">
   "With regards to Haru's design Morita explains, "What first struck me was his sentence: "Maybe the Cat Kingdom isn't so bad..." It is easy to demonstrate that our world is neither so dazzling, not quite as gorgeous as the one portrayed in shojo comics. There are indeed many dirty, vile things. But that kind of talk is not for fans of Aoi Hiiragi's comics. I actually asked the women at Studio Ghibli to tell me about the charms of shojo comics and little by little I started to understand."
  </p>
  <p key="aeb5760f-e085-4a4c-9c2c-c63dd7a7c486">
   "I thought (Haru's expressions) are cute. I like this kind of girl, open, natural, cheerful and sensitive. But some may find her indecisive and stupid."
  </p>
  <p key="553e51ae-232d-4bac-a608-b8ec108d58d5">
   On the other hand, manga author Aoi Hiiragi explains how she went about writing the character of Haru, "When I was offered this job, I thought that the kind of thing I was expected to do as a shojo artist was expected of me. That's why I decided that my heroine would be a high school student. At that time, I often reflected on what happiness is for a human being, and I believe this question runs through my story.
  </p>
  <p key="39e201ac-26fb-445a-aa33-4d8d38ef3db1">
   Shojo manga are often about love. For a teenage girl, happiness is loving and being loved in return. But I think there are a lot of other forms of happiness. Even if, in everyday life, we often feel like we are unlucky.
  </p>
  <p key="71e61751-2eff-491f-a5c1-ce4a12fced43">
   This film is a story that takes place in an imaginary world. Haru travels to the Cat Kingdom. After her return, she may encounter other difficult situations, but her experience will allow her to be less unhappy and have a more open outlook. This is what I had in mind while writing this story."

   gave the film a lighter, more intimate tone. When designing the Cat Bureau, Tanaka explains, "By inserting all kinds of European elements, drawing flowers, marigolds and geraniums, I created a European neighborhood atmosphere. The light is like that of the real world. Nevertheless, the notion of size is important: the houses are smaller whereas I have drawn life-size plants."

   During the sequence where the Baron chases after the cats that have kidnapped
   Haru
   , Tanaka references several photographs for the alleyways and sought to reproduce their details accurately. The cat kingdom itself was given the direction of being "overflowing with light", with little contrast to enhance its lighter tone. Tanaka explains, "I think I managed to represent a clear light, which pierces the sky. Scenes in remote streets or night scenes are never moody. All give an impression of cheerfulness and clarity."

   "The Cat Returns" runtime barely clocked in at 75 minutes and did not have the scale or ambition of Ghibli's previous films, and was released in theaters with the short film "

   Fans noted that the Tokyo Chunichi Sports newspaper offered only modest coverage of the film's premiere, compared to the newspaper Hochi which was comparatively large in scale.

  <p key="c7224b22-cb1e-485a-b5e3-4aa948fccd72">
   A press conference was held on July 20, 2002, and the film premiered in on over 358 screens nationwide. Hibiya Cinema in Tokyo and Yurakucho was filled to capacity, with 700 spectators and included a midnight screening of 250 people. Chizuru Ikewaki, the voice actor of Haru and Yoshihiko Hakamada, the voice actor of Baron were present on stage to greet the crowd.
  </p>
  <p key="848e982e-3772-4c56-983e-e0ccc9248d1e">
   While Hiroyuki Morita was not present during the event, Hochi Newspapers noted this by saying, "First supervisor Mr. Morita refused to attend the greeting event." While the film rode on the success and goodwill of “Spirited Away", it only sold half of the former's ticket sales. The film was still the big hit during the summer 2002 in Japan, racking up $50 million at the box office.

   Nomi explains his process,
   <i key="d2ea3008-c088-4552-870a-d6e523e5d442">
    “For the music for this film, I started with demonstration pieces, composed from the ideas I had of the characters. I first composed the songs for the heroine,
    Haru
    . There are two: the one that corresponds to the real world and the one that relates to his childhood memories. For the first, I tried to show the bubbling of everyday life, the hustle and bustle of real world scenes. But it didn't correspond to the director's image of it and I changed this music a lot afterwards! The other piece is nostalgic. In a way, it seems to me that he became the central theme of the film.

   <i key="279e0e0a-722d-43fc-b717-0d59d31f494f">
    Next came the
    Baron
    . He's a simple and incredibly elegant character. Therefore, I composed an extremely pompous piece, like trumpets playing fanfare music. As for
    Muta
    , I transposed its rustic side into music. I composed the theme of the king of cats so that it seems to illustrate the Kingdom. Behind its majestic, imposing appearance, this Kingdom appears to be a sham. I didn't want to give a good impression of it. I wanted the contrast with the Baron, who comes to save Haru, to be striking.

   <i key="c9475fe6-84f0-4a04-9136-18373421c41f">
    For the music played by the cats parading at the beginning of the film, the director asked me to use the sound of the oriental flute, which sounds very ... "cat"! It may sound a bit Japanese. But the Cat Kingdom is not Japan, I added the organ, oboe and clarinet, despite everything being punctuated by the tsuzumi, a small Japanese drum. Why the tsuzumi? Quite simply because among the cats who interpret this music in the image, there is one who plays this instrument! This piece fits perfectly to the image. The same goes for the music performed by the orchestra of cats in the banquet scene at the castle. As one of them plays the tsuzumi and another, the accordion, I integrated these two instruments into my music.

   <i key="8470f1a6-2719-4477-bc58-9e5b63e1d15b">
    So I composed the music for this film from the characters or the scenes. For the music of the scene where Haru returns from the Cat Kingdom safe and sound, there is something that I think will not escape viewers who have seen If You Listen . I wanted, through my music, to establish a connection between these two films. I'll let you watch the movie and find my nod yourself."

    “As I really like Ghibli cartoons, I was extremely happy that they asked me to compose the main theme of it. Regarding the central song of the film, I was a little worried about the difficulty of this work, thinking of all the constraints to be respected. But the director told me: “I don't want a ballad, but a rhythmic song, drawn from your universe."

    When I composed it, the film was not yet finished and I got an idea of ​​it by reading the storyboard. I felt a lot of sympathy for the positive character of the heroine, Haru, and her way of being good to her. I wanted to express clearly in my song the change that is taking place in her, not in a blatant way but rather gradual. About to be taken to the Cat Kingdom, she thought to herself, “The Cat Kingdom... After all, why not live here? "You can encounter this kind of situation during your life. By following the general thread of his life, it can happen that we are attracted by slightly different paths, that we make detours. It's part of human nature. And so you end up finding what is important to you. I think this is the theme of this film: knowing how to assert your own identity. It is something magnificent. I wanted this theme to be reflected in my song.

    The song was born naturally, in a hum: “Close your eyes that have forgotten. It is the song of love found ... " In these lyrics, the word" love "is not used only in its original meaning. It also refers to the feelings of humans towards life, work, study, dreams and all kinds of things. At the beginning of the song, it seems to me that behind the sweetness lies an extremely strong will. I really like this passage. The keystone of this song is “the feelings that we have forgotten. " I made by putting in unison my feelings and those of Haru, and I illustrated by a joyous melody.

    recalls, Hayao Miyazaki advised me to have Haru say, "Baron, I think I have a crush on you.". However, all the staff rejected this proposal."

However, I understood the purpose of releasing Haru feelings and heart in the scene, so I added the line "Maybe we are cool!".
