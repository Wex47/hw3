When the light goes out, Lisa heads outside and sees the rising tide has reached the road.  Worried about the residents of the nursing home where she works, Lisa decides to leave and check up on seniors and has Sōsuke stay put. At first he insists on going with her but she tells them that their house is a beacon in the dark and tells him she has to help them.  She makes plenty of food for him and Ponyo and after making him man of the house she promises Sōsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.  After packing up the car and leaving, she takes the advice of the two crossing guards and takes the Mountain Road.  Once she's out of sight, Sōsuke goes back inside the house and stays with Ponyo.

I stayed in a house on the cliff next door for two months, and in the summer of 2006, I stayed alone. The concept of this work was also elaborated at this time."

   Miyazaki asked her animation director to tell her about her daughter's character. For example, at a year and a half, she still refuses to hold her bottle: she already has character! From the details Kondô provided him, Ponyo's character has already evolved in Miyazaki's mind. The director appreciated his strong character for such a little girl and that is exactly what he seeks for the character of Ponyo.
  </p>
  <p key="f0ce9d5b-53e7-417f-a9c7-0872752df3c7">
   But one of Miyazaki's main crafting secrets is to start each new movie by drawing image boards (color drawings that set the mood for scenes in the movie) that reflect the story. The director layers on paper as many images as possible that have come out of his head. He begins by drawing without even having a specific story in mind. Little by little, he integrates scenes and patterns that he would like to draw. At first, his ideas are not very precise, but he forces himself to draw. He hopes that this will make his imagination work. “The creation of image boards is a bit like the idea of ​​putting a hook in the water of a river: we know that there are fish in the water, but sometimes they don't bite!"
  </p>
  <p key="bda72e34-785d-4eeb-afda-00f75bd6e91a">
   Along with the design of the image boards, Miyazaki is thinking about the film's script, especially the opening scene. He hesitates between starting his story by presenting the daily life of Sôsuke, a scene which would allow the audience to easily enter the story, or by the underwater life of Ponyo, which would be a more original but also more enigmatic for the public. But Miyazaki also believes that childish logic is not that of adults and that they will adapt very easily to such a start. Thus, Miyazaki chooses to open the film from Ponyo's perspective.
  </p>
  <p key="8defa6c5-2ccb-4097-b364-eaa1815541c6">
   From that moment on, Miyazaki's imagination blossomed and he quickly completed almost all of the image boards at the start of the film. He quickly comes to drawing a group of jellyfish and associating Ponyo with them. He then goes on to draw a boat, which, in the morning, will surprise Ponyo with its noise.
  </p>
  <p key="01198048-5818-4bcf-99f1-5a58cddd0dcd">
   But soon after Miyazaki begins writing the script, he tears it up. He then begins to regret having engaged in the creation of a new film. For the elder director, the creation of a film is punctuated by many doubts. Three weeks would pass following the meeting between the director and his two main collaborators. More and more image boards are completed but Miyazaki remains anxious as he seeks a different approach compared to his other films. Following

   , Miyazaki himself felt that he had reached a limit in the density of detail that his images could offer.

   It was in February 2005 that he became fully aware of this flaw during a trip to England, in a visit to Tate Britain in London. While reading "La Porte", he discovered that the author,

   , had a passion for the painting "Ophélie" (1851-1852) by John Everett Millais. He then went to the London museum where he was amazed by the pre-Raphaelite painters of the mid-nineteenth century, and more particularly by Millais's painting.
   “This painting is as dense as the images in my films. I finally realized that I was doing the same thing as these painters, but less well. There is therefore no point in continuing on this path because I cannot surpass them." The director decides to change course and pass a more detailed constantly style to a more simple style and natural, closer to the line of origin of the

   Miyazaki also decides that the film would not be using CG-elements and instead be drawn entirely in 2-D. "Drawing on paper is the root of animation. I think I'll go back to that. Once again, I'll row the oars myself, raise the sails in the wind and cross the sea. Anyway, I'll draw with a pencil."
  </p>
  <p key="c480d9de-36c2-4f26-b698-866c750ae84a">
   In June 2006, Miyazaki begins to simplify his drawings by carefully avoiding rendering detailed shadows and light reflections. He begins using dry pastels, a coloring technique that he had never used before. He devotes much time and effort depicting the tsunami sequence, which he considered an incredibly important scene for the film.

   At the beginning of July 2006, Hayao Miyazaki set off on a yet another research trip by the sea, in Setouchi (瀬戸内地方), in western Japan (Okayama Prefecture). The beginning of animation production is imminent. He takes this opportunity to find himself alone, for a week, in the house of one of his friends, on the edge of a cliff. While there, he busies himself by working on the
   <i key="51cd18a5-c254-4680-8a28-7c2c1a29851d">

   of the film. But the closer the production period approaches, the more nervous and moody he is.
  </p>
  <p key="3804e144-78c1-4e9f-960c-c5ecf42db69a">
   In mid-July 2006, he returned to Ghibli's production studio in Koganei. By this point, he had already drawn around fifty image boards during pre-production and continues to develop the
   <i key="b6a4e8bf-7daf-4459-8350-63db0909c0d4">

   </i>
   is that they are created like the chapters of a manga. At regular intervals, after having finished drawing a few pages, he stops and puts the words “to be continued” at the bottom of his last page to create an expectation on the part of his team. He then takes a break for a few days, or even weeks, to think about the next developments in the story. “Even if we already have an idea of ​​the end of the story, it will always change during production."

   explains that although production on the film has already started, he and the staff cannot guess where they are going. Miyazaki himself doesn't know that either. Everyone will have to doubt whether each new contribution will ultimately result in a good film. In the same way, as in a painting, the characters themselves also evolve through the film's ongoing production. In the case of Ponyo's character, the further the production goes, the more concerned Miyazaki is about the character's selfish and immature personality. He imagines that she will have a hard time living in human society and begins to worry about her future. In order for Ponyo to adapt well to what he describes as 'male society', he thinks he needs to add a scene. But he does not yet know which one.

  <p key="37548e03-bea4-43ba-b378-b62be3dc7c20">
   He goes back to the elaboration of the

   </i>
   and finally composes the scene where Ponyo, for the first time, offers something to others: soup and a sandwich to a couple and their baby. When Ponyo then crushes the cheeks of the sulking baby, it is meant to instill a sense of optimism in him. Miyazaki believes that this kind of gesture brings a great emotional evolution to children. With this scene, Miyazaki makes sure that Ponyo will do good things when she becomes human.

  <p key="88babadb-99e3-43df-8856-5aa0b5816936">
   It was not until March 8, 2007, 11 months after production began, that the very first shot of the film, showing Ponyo surrounded by jellyfish, was completed. But at the end of summer 2007, the creation of animation slowed down immensely. The rate at which the director checks the animation has dropped significantly. Due to fatigue, the number of shots to control is piling up. But the most problematic remains the
   <i key="ee24b7f9-39a3-4243-9bd6-4a09ba4eaa5b">
    e-konte
   </i>
   . This one remained blocked when the Ponyo and
   Sôsuke
   leave by boat. Only until the end of the film does it finally focus on how Sôsuke manages to keep his promise to watch over Ponyo. But Miyazaki thinks she still lacks a bit of impact. He is looking for a new sequence, which, although not necessary, is striking.
  </p>
  <p key="6d93d56f-67be-4908-8479-f800002d750b">
   It was in the fall of 2007, when he was approaching his 67 years, that Hayao Miyazaki said to Toshio Suzuki: “I have reached an age where I can count on my fingers the years that remain to me. to live. Soon I will find my mother. What am I going to tell him when that moment arrives?" This question has been central to the creation and all the work he has done around the film. And even if in the end, it is not necessarily clear and explicit for the spectator on the screen, it is precisely by evoking the memory of his missing mother that he will try to nourish the development of the story of his mother.

   In the past, in some of his films, Miyazaki has already made latent references to his sick mother, who suffered from severe tuberculosis from the director's early childhood. He has already represented her at each of the periods of her life as a woman:

   On December 3, 2007, a conference was organized at Studio Ghibli in front of the media to present the title song of the film. When asked about it, Miyazaki hopes that since the song is happy, it will have such a cheerful conclusion. But he also lets guess the creative impasse in which he finds himself and admits that he does not yet know it himself because the

   Fujimoto
   stands in front of Sôsuke who then tries to escape to protect Ponyo. Suddenly, Toki appears and calls the boy to save him. For this sequence, the director tries to appeal to the frustration he felt in his early childhood at not being able to hug his sick mother as much as he wanted. He wonders how Sôsuke could hug Toki. Or how he would do it if he found himself facing his mother. The director finally decides that it is Toki who will embrace Sôsuke frontally. He is satisfied with this sequence through which he has found a way to exorcise what he has been feeling since his childhood.

   Anime Diet cited the quality of the translation, noting, "The story and the core of the film were communicated more than adequately through the professional dub and it did not get in the way of the sheer delight and joy that Miyazaki wanted to convey." Citing "slight pacing problems," it gave

   Critics at the Venice International Film Festival generally had high praise. Wendy Ide of The Times said Ponyo "is as chaotic and exuberant as a story told by a hyperactive toddler," and gave it 4 stars out of 5. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a full four stars, the highest rank on his review scale, stating that, "There is a word to describe Ponyo, and that word is magical. This poetic, visually breathtaking work by the greatest of all animators has such deep charm that adults and children will both be touched. It's wonderful and never even seems to try: It unfolds fantastically." The film was rated #2 on Dentsu's list of "2008 Hit Products in Japan", after the Wii console.
