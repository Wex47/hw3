   She travels aboard a palanquin, carried by her magical henchmen. She does this not just for her incredible girth, but for her aversion to sunlight, as even within her palanquin are dark curtains. Initially the antagonist, the Witch becomes somewhat of a protagonist after
   Madame Suliman
   lures her to the castle to drain her of her magical powers. When forced to climbed the stairway to Suliman's palace, the sunlight slowly exposes her actual appearance and age. She further regresses when she is taken into a room with several large incandescent light bulbs.

Howl has spent the past year hiding from the Witch while trying to find Prince Justin and Wizard Suliman. Near the end of the novel, Howl kills the Witch when arriving at the Waste to rescue Sophie.

   According to supervising animator
   Akihiko Yamashita
   , "We first began with some sketches based on a photo of an old English lady. It became obvious she wouldn't be very appealing if she only looked scary. Following Miyazaki's request, I made her look more erotic in her character design by drawing a full-blossomed, voluptuous woman. In his initial sketches, Miyazaki also drew her as plump and voluptuous. We drew her in the same vein."

  <p key="add3d580-5114-4412-9e90-162649a9517c">
   Supervising animator
   Takeshi Inamura
   elaborated on her personality and design, "I worked on portraying the Witch of the Waste as caring, so she wouldn't be seen as a simple evil character. She herself doesn't consider herself evil at all, and in fact, she isn't a bad person. In terms of animation, it was difficult to draw her after she ages. The wrinkles we added inevitable stretched her face. The downward multiple lines would make her nose droop, elongating her entire face. The hardest task was to subdue that effect and keep her physique intact."
