   Due to her love for

   , Sophie de-ages depending on her emotional state. When defending Howl to Sullivan, Sophie briefly regains her original appearance, but turns back after. Throughout the rest of the film, her old form doesn't suffer back pain and she stands straighter; her wrinkles also smoothen. Sophie's braid is shorter in her old form.

  <p key="77e64e17-17c4-467c-b237-ceba0f28643c">
   Supervising animator
   Takeshi Inamura
   handled many of the initial character sketches, "At first, I drew her as if she were merely an older version of Sophie, but then she didn't resemble 'Sophie' at all. So I thought it might be better to draw the aged Sophie as representing Sophie's personality. The drawings became more 'Sophie-like' once I managed to convey Sophie's personality as an old lady.
  </p>
  <p key="2c780905-65af-473c-8659-fafc0bbf4ff5">
   Michiyo Yasuda elaborated on choosing the right colors for Sophie's design, "I was determined to make the aged Sophie look cute, but I had to dismiss that approach almost immediately. She simply wouldn't look old without her skin being wrinkled and blemished. She might appear plain, but I made sureshe would have the appeal of a refined old lady. I would alter the colors according to each scene. For example, when she cheerfully cleans the rooms, I added some brightness to her skin and clothes. I did the same with the Witch of the Waste when she's stunned afte rlosing her magical power, but then ends up becoming kind. I wanted to make her buoyant there. I've taken this approach ih previous films, but in this one I really worked on conveying the emotional developments with colors in minute detail.
  </p>
  <p key="2afc4cbe-e6ca-47e6-bccb-ce4b154c57a4">
   Yasuda also explained how a character's color hues changes according to their emotional development, and even why Sophie's hair remains white in the film, "In order to determine colors I always take into consideration the personality and emotional development of each character and the director's aim. But the characters in this film change so much physically from scene to scene the emotional development can be equally drastic. I changed the colors in detail with every change. For example, Sophie turns into an old lady and then becomes young again, but by then she's experienced so many things, including her encounter with Howl. I felt she had changed dramatically from who she was at the beginning of the film. I left Sophie's hair white in the scene where she suddenly becomes young again in the high moor scene with Howl's hideaway hut, and it turned out right. Miyazaki also agreed and suggested, "How about we just keep her hair white,", so we kept her hair that way in the second half of the film. But the hue of her white hair differs from the hue of her aged hair.
