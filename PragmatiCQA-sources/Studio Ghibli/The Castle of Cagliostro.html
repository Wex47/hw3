   is portrayed as a scheming and lecherous thief, sometimes supported by his former enemies Jigen and Goemon. Miyazaki's film conflicts with the typical behavior and personality of the characters, a change that has been described as Lupin "growing up".
  </p>
  <p key="598cba08-d10f-4ee1-86b4-9a90abf442bd">
   In a 1981 interview, Miyazaki explained his vision of Lupin, "To be honest, when I was first asked to join, I thought “why now?” For me, and I think Otsuka-san feels much the same, but Lupin was a character living in 60s to 70s. So I thought the theme to use Lupin was bit old and dated."
  </p>
  <p key="88ea24fd-3a16-4b38-9d54-46aa3d47766e">
   "Even the original comic book, I heard that Monkey Punch spent a lot of effort on this because he wanted to make his name big in comic industry as a new comer. So it was interesting. I liked the energy of this comic. Beyond his drawing sense, I felt the overwhelming energy and hungry spirit from the author. That is why Lupin the Third himself got much of the same characteristics: the hungry spirit. He was not a cool, unaffected fellow. I believe he was a reflection of Monkey Punch himself back then. We found ourselves in common with his hungry spirit as anime creators. So as we created the animation, we felt these characters to be so similar and close to us, even when I first read the comic I felt so. Although the first TV series was not commercially successful, we felt that we had a lot of fun and did what we wanted to do…"
  </p>
  <p key="ce8200c4-4410-4c73-a24b-58060614283f">
   "Anyway, then after the first TV series comes the second, and then the movie (
   <i key="9416b87a-0ffc-4dec-9abd-0c22f1795732">
    The Mystery of Mamo
   </i>
   ). I felt that Lupin had seen all the glory and ended all its chapters. So I was quite astonished when they were starting up again."
  </p>
  <p key="9b85aa80-77f5-4de1-bf3e-44df2ded8e05">
   "I questioned myself. What do I want to do with it now? For what kind of audience? Maybe I am being over melodramatic about it, but I did not know what I was doing this all for. Of course, there were some materials and motifs which I always had in mind, but I had to rethink of the character “Lupin” all over again, who he is, what he is."
  </p>
  <p key="c1881b56-fd2e-496b-a6bc-f5ada6c6d8ef">
   "First of all, the structure of Lupin is a very loose one. There is no “unchangeable/untouchable image of Lupin the Third” which we are bound to. It can take anything. We can throw anything at it. It encompasses anything and everything. So as Otsuka-san said, there are lots of different interpretations. If there are 100 people (viewer or creator, he did not specify), there are 100 different Lupin exists as well. And when opportunity came around and I had to create my version of Lupin, all I could think was the image of Lupin lived in his glory in 60s and early 70s, now living in the regret and shame for his young and wild life."
  </p>
  <p key="ad0bc9e4-ce55-456d-967b-6f8a1be8666a">
   "So even the selections of cars in the film, I did not make them too contemporary. I did not want to go too antique either, but I limited the selection of cars from 50s and 60s. A torpedo boat seems bit too outdated, however, I was trying not to show motorboat or anything new of that sort to keep the tone of the film. It was rather a fashion statement and approach when determining the design of the animation."

  <p key="bf4c48c4-de68-41f0-a725-b1dd049cfd49">
   "Then I thought this Lupin was probably a kind of man who used to drove Mercedes Benz SSK but now he is out of that phase and bored with it. He realized, after all, it does not matter what car he drives, as long as it drives, and he is just driving around with the most basic car. He is over the fame and status which came with the money. He is no longer a man who would pull out the most rare and expensive cigarette lighter to light his cigarette anymore. He does not give a single damn about such thing. He is fine with the cheap disposable one as long as it does the job. That was my image of Lupin. I felt like I finally understood Lupin. And based on that image, I created this film."

  <p key="33807022-354c-4acb-acb7-9931492e65ea">
   "I think that underlying philosophy was displayed and carried throughout this film. For example, he is using a disposable lighter to light his cigar and eating instant cup noodle. He is returned to the basics. Recently, there is a trend which people wear designer brand closes and items, but he is the one who would see it all from outside and thinking “it is only country bumpkins who would do that.” He stopped caring about those fashion and status ten years ago. The same goes for his comrades."

   "Even when it comes to love, he keeps the same stance. Maybe if it was ten years ago, he would have fallen for love, but now he knows he is not that young nor innocent, so he excuse himself as “old man” and draw the line. [laughs]"

   I felt that popular image of Lupin was very close to the players/hustlers who would hang around in Casinos. To me, that did not seem cool. That would be more close to, let’s say the politicians going to Las Vegas for vacations? (probably 80’s reference for expensive vacations or show offs) It is unsophisticated/unrefined and shows that they have no class. But Lupin stopped aspiring to be rich one day."

  </p>
  <p key="7a30a082-7519-45dd-8ee8-15adca7d8655">
   In a 1981 interview with Ōtsuka, he explains, "First off, back then, it was as if Miya-san (Hayao Miyazaki) faced a proposition to create what kind of Lupin you would come up with including its title 'Castle of Cagliostro.' What I mean by that is, by then, Lupin and its world had many interpretations including the TV series which I created 10 years ago and later on the first movie (
   <i key="3241129d-f415-4792-b9d2-08ec68118f62">
    Legend of Mamo
   </i>
   ) was already out when we started discussing the plan for this next film. Of course there was also Monkey (Punch) -san’s original comic to base all of it off. Even in his comic, there is a world of differences compared to when he first started it and now."
  </p>
  <p key="f2b6759f-45a6-47ab-93da-7e7ee4175ad2">
   "So there was a basic premise that Lupin can be interpreted in many different ways, then we started discussing “how we should draw it this time” for this next film piece. In the actual timeline it was May of 1979 that I asked Miya-san to join. The rest of the plan was completely blank; we supposed that we could start working on the drawings/sketches in maybe from July. So we had two months for Miya-san to develop this Lupin, what kind of element he would add and how he would put them together to make it a story of Lupin. Then we spent next four months creating the actual film. That was how this film piece was made. As a result, this film became pretty intense and enriched in flavor."
  </p>
  <p key="c25e81d4-7525-4b0f-81b8-2854da8805fa">
   Production for the film began in May 1979 with the writing of the story and storyboarding for the film. Miyazaki, who often works without a completed script, began by drawing a bird's eye view of the setting before creating the story to completion. After the first draft scenario was returned to Miyazaki without change, he began the storyboards. At the time, the screenplay had been co-written with Haruya Yamazaki, but evidence shows Miyazaki ignoring Yamazaki's ideas and changing the story completely. The novelization published by Shueisha Cobalt Bunko features much of the original screenplay Yamazaki.
  </p>
  <p key="5e16bca8-cd9a-4a6b-b787-8758533f5c74">
   Miyazaki elaborates on how animation makes Lupin stand out in animation, "In the case of Lupin, he is a thief. So he makes his living off of stealing things from the ordinary and normal people who make their living in legally proper way. It is bound to reality. The more we draw the ordinary people, the more the unusualness of a thief can stand out and shine. If we wander off and draw a preposterous world and people instead too much, the novelty and shock value of a thief would disappear."
  </p>
  <p key="560e38fc-fee1-49e7-ad27-ffab0c8810bc">
   "So we first have to create and establish a quite decent, ordinary part in the film. If we focus too much on the lolita complex, abnormal love story or rely too much on some extraordinary gadgets inventions, Lupin’s charm as a thief would become bleak. First and foremost, he needs to solve the difficult situations with his own mind and body. Even when he is using a gadgets, it has to be something he might come up with and invented himself. Otherwise he would not be a thief. The whole film itself would be a Sci-fi. Who would like to watch a James Bond who went to outer space? It would be so boring. He would be dressed in space suits and cannot even make out with a girl that easily, you know? [laughs]"
  </p>
  <p key="f6dd8c96-3664-4b2c-821f-31488a86f9e5">
   "Even when drawing the mechanical items, such as cars, planes, tanks and battleships, the engineers invented them all. They are the designers. I would not give any credits to the animators who simply drew them well on the screen. I think it is very important to keep in mind, that the animators should be focused on how to use those items in his animation rather than just sketching the item to perfection."
  </p>
  <p key="7852fa55-6a43-4e63-88dd-c2f3fb31df9a">
   "If Fiat 500 comes out on the screen and moves exactly how a real Fiat 500 would move, then it is pointless. Then it would be just showing a fashion statement of the creator that he likes this car over any other car. But if that Fiat 500 moves like a certain character and his mood, it would be a character on its own. So no matter how broken it may appears, how many window panels its missing, as long as it does its best, it is fine and charming, I think. I wonder how boring it would have been if we picked a brand new supercar for the speed car chase scene at the beginning of the film."

   The story was divided into four parts, but after reaching the third part changes had to be made at the storyboard phase in order to not exceed the decided running time. Animation work began in July 1979 while the storyboards were only a quarter complete; Miyazaki had to complete them during the animation production. Originally, Ōtsuka was the Animation Director of

   During recording, MIyazaki asked Yasuo Yamada to be more subdued, "like Clint Eastwood". Yamada retorted, "Leave Lupin to me!", and insisted that he do whatever he want with the character.

After watching the finished product, Yamada sincerely apologized to Miyazaki.

   The film draws upon many sources of inspiration that were important in the production of the film. McCarthy writes that a research trip was not specifically undertaken for the film, but says Miyazaki's Heidi sketchbooks were useful for the scenery. Miyazaki would cite Italian Mountain Cities and the Tiber Estuary from Kagoshima Publishing as influencing the production of the film. The film included elements that were seen in other Arsène Lupin works, including La Justice d'Arsène Lupin by Boileau-Narcejac, involving the discovery of a tremendous stash of forged franc notes with which World War I–era Germany had planned to destabilize the French economy. Maurice Leblanc's The Green-eyed Lady also featured a secret treasure hidden at the bottom of a lake.

   . Greenberg writes, "Cagliostro also borrowed many narrative and visual elements from Grimault's film: the basic plotline of disrupting the wedding of an evil tyrant and a beautiful innocent girl, the tyrant's luxuriously-decorated palace that is also full of traps, and a gang of henchmen serving the tyrant – both oversized goons and ninja-like assassins..."

   McCarthy describes the summery color palette of the film as matching the scenery and the characters, but notes the use of dark and light colors are used to emphasize the subplot of the dark and light sides of the Cagliostros. The film's score was composed by series regular Yuji Ohno, and varies between jazz, romance and orchestral music. Notably, it includes a variation of Lupin III's iconic TV theme. The music was performed by You &amp; The Explosion Band, who had previously worked on the second television series. The main vocal song

   portrayal of the characters was changed to better identify with Miyazaki's concept of a "hero" and to remove a sense of apathy in the story. This resulted in Lupin being a happy-go-lucky and upbeat thief who drives and lives out of a Fiat 500; a sharp contrast to the scheming and lecherous Lupin who drives expensive cars like the Mercedes-Benz SSK because it was "Hitler's favorite". The changes would also impact secondary characters like Jigen and Goemon, changing their serious and cold personalities into friendly and humorous; even the erotic elements involving the femme-fatale Fujiko were dropped.

Dani Cavallaro highlights the signature details of Miyazaki's style and form being displayed in this work and how it impacts the portrayal of the story. Cagliostro, the country and setting, is depicted in meticulous detail and unconstrained by limitations of architecture, geography and culture, which can be described as

A year later, Tokyo Movie Shinsha began screen testing the film in North America and it was notably shown at the World Science Fiction Convention in Boston for a marketing survey. It was later screened at other festivals during the 1980s, including FILMEX 82 in Los Angeles. Despite resounding acclaim from the screenings, many of them were unsuccessful. According to Fred Patten, the primary reason was that, "most people did not bother to come to it since it was "only" an animated-cartoon feature, not a "serious" live-action movie."

   The American theatrical debut was on 3 April 1991 in New York City by
   's Streamline Pictures, with the home release following in October 1992. Streamline's dub contains several deviations from the original Japanese script. Due to copyright issues with Maurice LeBlanc's estate, Lupin is referred to as "the Wolf." Inspector Koichi Zenigata is erroneously named Keibu Zenigata, likely due to a translation error (keibu being the Japanese title for a police inspector). The UK release followed on 10 June 1996 by Manga Video. Optimum Releasing re-released Cagliostro in the UK after Manga Entertainment lost its license in the UK. The new DVD features an anamorphic widescreen print with the original Japanese audio track as well as the Streamline dub, both in stereo.

   In 2000, Manga released the film on home video in the United States with a newly commissioned dub that adhered closer to the original script with the correct names restored. The DVD preserves the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen and is non-anamorphic. It additionally features remastered audio and picture, but contains no extras. The same company later released a new special edition DVD of Cagliostro in 2006. The disc is double-sided with the film on side A and the extras on side B. It includes a new digital transfer; Manga's English dub in 2.0 and 5.1 surround plus Japanese, Spanish, and French language tracks in mono; the complete film in storyboard format, accompanied by Japanese audio with English subtitles; an original Japanese trailer; a sketch and still gallery; a 26-minute interview with animation director Yasuo Ōtsuka, and animated menus. The film is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen; however, the opening credits have been heavily re-edited to remove the Japanese credits, instead using selected still-frames of scenes that appear without Japanese writing. The English-translated names are superimposed over these stills. This change was negatively received by fans of the film.

   In December 2008, the film was released on Blu-ray in Japan. Its video format is MPEG-4 AVC and its digitally-remastered audio is improved over that of the DVD, but contains no English audio or subtitle options despite being in Region A format. Years later, a new HD digital remaster was produced and Cagliostro was given a limited theatrical re-release in Japan on 9 May 2014. The remaster was released both individually and as part of The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki, a box set containing all of Miyazaki's movies. Both these newer releases were released by Studio Ghibli in conjunction with Disney. StudioCanal released a Blu-ray and DVD bundle of the film on 12 November 2012 in the UK. The StudioCanal release is of superior quality with its new high definition transfer, but the credits for the film are absent.

   North American anime distributor Discotek Media announced on 26 March 2014 that they had licensed the film and planned to release it on DVD in 2014, with a Blu-ray release to follow at a then-unspecified future date. The DVD version was eventually delayed to January 6, 2015 and included the Streamline and Animaze/Manga dubs, a "Family Friendly" alternate version of the Animaze/Manga dub with reduced profanity, the original Japanese audio with newly translated English subtitles, an alternate subtitle option based on the subtitles used by TMS in their 1980 screenings of the film, a collection of alternate opening and closing sequences to the film from previous releases, translation notes, two trailers and a fan-made audio commentary by Reed Nelson. The Blu-ray was released on 25 June 2015 and featured the same extras in addition to another alternate subtitle option using a literal translation of the film's screenplay, new interviews with David Hayter and Bob Bergen, an introduction to the film by Hayter, translated past interviews from the French Blu-ray (featuring Yasuo Ōtsuka, Kazuhide Tomonaga and Monkey Punch), an optional storyboard viewing mode, a slideshow gallery of production and promotional art, and a text-based overview of the film's production history. Plans to include an emulated port of Cliff Hanger as an extra feature for the Blu-ray were dropped when the original contracts for the game could not be found. The Castle of Cagliostro was included in Disney's The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki Blu-ray set released on November 17, 2015. This release features only the Streamline dub and the Japanese audio with English subtitles; none of the extras from Discotek's releases are included.

   While the film was not initially a box-office success, it gained popularity through numerous re-releases and was even voted as "the best anime in history" by the readers of Animage. Following a July 1992 release by Streamline Pictures, Janet Maslin said she thought the film "should fare nearly as well [as Akira] with animation fans of any age, provided they are unwavering in their devotion to the form and do not think 100 minutes is an awfully long time." According to Maslin, the film is an "interestingly wild hybrid of visual styles and cultural references" whose "animation is weak when it comes to fluid body movements, but outstanding in its attention to detail." According to Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle, "C of C refrains from the Technicolor ultra-violence that helped make films like Golgo 13, Akira, and Vampire Hunter D such audience favorites, and instead focuses on broad, almost slapstick humor and chaos to keep viewers riveted. Sometimes it works, and unfortunately, sometimes it doesn't." Review aggregator RottenTomatoes gives the film a 91% approval rating based on reviews from 11 critics, with an average rating of 7/10. Some fans maintain that it is not a "true"

   , the film was said to have received the "Award for Best Animated Feature". The actual award was from the 1979 Mainichi Film Concours, where the film received the Ōfuji Noburō Award. No concrete evidence for this claim has even been put forward and the misinformation in the releases serves to cement its decades-long persistence.

   The film was the best selling anime DVD in May 2001, and the third best selling in June. Both of Manga Entertainment's releases of The Castle of Cagliostro received DVD Talk Collector Series recommendation status, the highest status given by the review website DVDtalk.com. Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD.com gave the film a grade of "A+", although he disliked Manga Entertainment's use of PG-13 level language in the English dub.

   and several prominent Japanese animators were flown into the United States to promote the film and to learn animation from Disney's infamous Nine Old Men. "The Castle of Cagliostro" had been screening throughout California, and one of the attendees was director Steven Spielberg. He was so impressed with the film that it later influenced the action sequences in his
