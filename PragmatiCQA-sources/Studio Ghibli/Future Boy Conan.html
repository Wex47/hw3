Television shows aimed at young boys were traditionally broadcast at 18:00, but considering children and adolescents accounted for the majority of viewership during prime time, they decided to schedule the series' broadcast at 19:30.

A devastating war fought between two major nations with ultra-magnetic weapons far greater than anything seen earlier brings about total chaos and destruction throughout the world, resulting in several earthquakes and tidal waves, the earth thrown off its axis, its crust being rocked by massive movements, and the five continents being torn completely apart and sinking deep below the sea.

   </i>
   interview, "NHK at first apparently favored a different story, but then they came out and said this was more interesting." Nakajima chose Hayao Miyazaki to direct, but the latter was initially reluctant. Miyazaki said he would only direct on the condition that he be allowed to alter the story and setting of the novel significantly and that
   Yasuo Ōtsuka
   was appointed as the animation director.
  </p>
  <p key="4ef79ce4-5020-4837-9095-c66f558c6d59">
   The original novel is a pessimistic tale with a strong ideological point of view set against a Cold War backdrop. Miyazaki was reluctant to show this type of story to children, so he significantly modified the settings and characters. Miyazaki explains, "I think that the dark quality of the original story comes from the author's intrinsically dark worldview. And in discussing the subject, it's probably hard to come up with a very optimistic answer. I think we may also see the story as dark because we live in Japan. That aside, I think it is still something we probably need to talk about. In a post-apocalyptic world, any human survivors would obviously have to possess a very powerful will to live. I know I'd want that for my own children. Rather than be told the human race is gong to be destroyed, I know I'd rather have my son thrilled by the girls he sees around him and chasing after them."
  </p>
  <p key="b9ebdde3-c04e-45ba-9220-a14fc50c50c0">
   "I incorporated my own hopes in the work. It may seem odd to say this, but those lines in the animated story, where Dr. Lao talks about talking responsibility for having killed billions of humans and exterminated tens of thousands of animal and plant species-are personally meaningful to me. I really wanted to make all the characters Japanese and, if not Japanese, at least have them all the same nationality so we could totally forget about language barriers; to differentiate characters visually we did have some red-haired people appear, but I basically wanted to avoid having different races of people in the story. Also, even if Japan were to sink of sight, I thought it would be good to at least have a tip of Japan's Boso peninsula or some vast industrial complex alive. In other words, in a story like this there is a problem of distance, because if there is no means of transportation, and we have a totally unknown world, then everything is really far away."
  </p>
  <p key="950141a2-5ead-4d0b-8ad0-da0f70fb5fdb">
   The scenario was now set twenty years after a fictitious war nearly ended all life on Earth. Miyazaki also expressed discomfort in how the original work depicted High Harbor as the United States and Industria as the Soviet Union.
  </p>
  <p key="0108445a-92d6-42f9-8ac1-03c318742fd3">
   "I frankly feel frustrated by the fact that the world of Conan turned out looking a bit like the American West. I think it would have been perfect if insteado f the Barracuda ship, we'd had an old Japanese fishing boat called the Bentenmaru, and instead of knives and forks, we'd had chopsticks and china bowls, the characters demanding food in Japanese, saying 'Meshi!'"
  </p>
  <p key="c55cd65c-6925-41ad-a02b-654d899b9f5d">
   "In the original story, the whole focus on the Soviet Union and America represents a type of arrogance, and I really hate it. And therefore it really bugs me that-despite all my efforts to eliminate this perspective from the story- some people still say that High Harbor represents America and Industria represents the Soviet Union. Thinking of the Soviet Union or of the United States in those terms is in itself a problem."

   , Miyazaki, who had been drawing storyboards until then, elaborated on the series being his directorial debut, "It was tough, frankly. I'd been working with Paku-san (Isao Takahata) up to then, you see. In watching him, I really thought directing wasn't for me, because a director has to assume such a heavy individual responsibility. Seeing what directing involved me not try it until then."

"And the easier something is, the easier it is for me to motivate myself. It was just a silly story, without anything particularly good or bad about it. Rather than focusing on something twisted, it was just a warm story, the sort of thing that evokes a bunch of chuckles and then ends. I think this is true for lots of manga, so in this case its probably better to call Akado Suzunosuke a cartoon film, rather than animation."
  </p>
  <p key="5ec29310-c87f-4f25-a556-cb54da0a0709">
   Each episode averaged roughly 6,000 to 7,000 drawings. While
   Yasuo Ōtsuka
   is credited as animation director for the series, he shared responsibilities with Miyazaki, especially with regard to how Lana was depicted. Miyazaki was dissatisfied with how Lana was drawn in the first episode so he took over as animation director for several episodes. "At Nippon Animation, there were many series with 8,000 cels for twenty-two minutes on the Calpis-sponsored track. So, 7,000 cels wasn't surprising. I think it was fewer than The Perrine Story. Even for a twenty-five minute show, as long as the movement's vigorous, it looks like there's a lot of action."

   magazine as, "an ordinary kid who mainly thinks about having fun in life. But humans are complex characters. And one fact about Conan is that the conditions in which le lives amplify certain aspects of his personality. He doesn't go out looking for adventure; he just does his best to stay alive in the conditions he finds himself. Conan sees the world through Lana, and Lana sees the world through Dr. Lao. And ultimately, Conan comes to embody what is most important in the world in which he lives. Even though he doesn't express it verbally, he comes to embody the vitality, resolute spirit, and understanding of others that his world needs. I personally like that the idea it is because of Conan's silent influence that Jimsy becomes happier, that Dyce tries to become more normal, and that Monsley is transformed."

  <p key="7298a1b2-b0aa-4deb-ba01-56aca4334b61">
   Regarding Miyazaki's characterizations of Lana, he describes her duality, saying she "had a somewhat darker aspect to her character". Her concern for her grandfather, Dr. Lao, changes her personality to be more somber while being in the presence of Conan makes her more upbeat. "Conan suddenly lifts her up in his arms and starts running after her. At that point it's as if she's always been an upbeat girl, but Conan is the one who brings out this part of her personality. TO Lana, Conan is like a kid from another dimension; she has to change because of the way he suddenly acts towards her. Land is basically torn between the feelings for her grandfather and Conan... In fact, in episode eleven, Lana becomes such an upbeat kid that she probably seems like a bit of an idiot. But when Triangle Tower is liberated and all the underground residents are freed, Lana is the only one who's held back. Because of her concern for Dr. Lao, her heart starts to close up and eventually she stops being able to hear Conan. Actually, Lana herself realizes what's happening and wants to flee, but is unable."

   Miyazaki reiterated his fondness for Conan, "I can say that I like boy characters like Conan. They always make me think about how old children are when they start imagining themselves as the heroes in their own fantasy stories. It seems to me that most boys are about eleven when they start imagining themselves as heroes in their stories where they have traditional roles like saving princesses, etc., so that's why I made Conan eleven. Of course, there's always something half-baked about all of this, because when my son turned twelve I always told him Conan was twelve too. I merely wanted to give shape and form to the hopes and dreams of children. But I don't think that in this story we literally have to think of the characters' age as being the same rapidly growing eleven or twelve as in the real world. Both Conan and Lana sometimes behave as adults, and sometimes as children, but in the world of cartoons, I think that's okay."

   interview, Miyazaki elaborated on the character of Dr. Lao and his relationship with his granddaughter Lana, particularly in the final moments of the series when he tells her that it's okay to leave him and to join Conan. "With his he frees her. And when that happens, it seems to me that Lao has to die, and the line where Lana says to the dying Lao, "Conan would stop them," seems evidence to me that she is gradually shifting away from her grandfather. Without the death of Lao, Lana can never be free. She would probably have had a complex about her grandfather. I think Conan probably knew this, too. That's why, in scenes-as in episode eight-where he lifts Lana up on top of the tank, it seems to me apparent that Dr. Lao must have had an amazing anger toward other people."
  </p>
  <p key="132ff030-6764-40d6-bc3e-8ed4b8618de1">
   "Whether we're talking about Mao Zedong or others, it's always the bad guys who try to change history dramatically, so in that sense I think Dr. Lao is essentially an evil character. He felt responsible for the destruction of the precious world, and has been living down his shame trying to act as a bridge for the next generation." Miyazaki further expounds that if the people in the underground relied purely on Conan and Lana, he believes Lao would have left them to their own devices and let them sink into the sea.

  <p key="f6aa9820-808d-444f-a946-16b2916d6ed3">
   When discussing the sudden turn of Monsley, Miyazaki said he applied "emotional animation". "I should calculated more calmly what I wanted to express in directing the film, but I tend to proceed on an emotional basis. I can't do the work unless I have an emotional investment in it... When I (invest heavily in my work), I start to empathize with characters, to feel sorry for them. Monsley's such a sad case that she nearly brought tears to my eyes. So then I started feeling that I ought to do something to help her out. In trying to help her, I started to think that it would be great if she could fall in love with Conan, but Lana already existed, so that wouldn't work. and if that's not possible, then i thought of having her marry Dyce, but at that instant her eyes would have sparkled too much. In other words, she'd just turn into an ordinary woman. I like women like Monsley. They look tough and defiant, but say they're waiting for someone to make them change. When I see someone like that, I always feel like saying something gentle to them. I think what happens to people like that is not that they change while being defiant, but that they get to the point where they no longer need to be defiant. And in order for them to change, I think they need someone to appear who really understands what they're being defiant about, but understanding what's beneath the surface of their existence."
  </p>
  <p key="2e724fdd-b9d2-499c-bc8a-a8352c2ceaf0">
   According to Miyazaki, her change in personality was decided upon seeing the greenery at High Harbor. This made her despondent, and since the Gunboat had been sunk, this made her recall her childhood. As to why she would marry someone like Dyce, Miyazaki says "it was first suggested as a joke. But then I realized that I would have to shave Monsley start to think that Dyce might not be such a bad person after all. That's the problem with Dyce. We had to gradually reveal his good qualities, and in the end this worked quite well. When Monsley becomes a more normal woman, and when she's freed from the  tension that she's always felt, and no longer has to restrain herself all the time, then she's able to view things that might have once seemed utterly idiotic to her. Dyce is a total fool, and from the beginning, Monsley's always referring to him as a 'stupid' or 'fool'. But while she's using these words, the meaning of them starts to change, and Dyce starts to accept this. So bother their views change in the end."
  </p>
  <p key="431a8fd3-72ab-4d4b-9bd3-49b43dd7dca4">
   "I could have had Monsley dump Dyce in the end, but I would have felt too sory for him, especially since so many of the crew memebers already had new babies by that point."
