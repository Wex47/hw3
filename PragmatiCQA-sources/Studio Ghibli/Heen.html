   Heen, Madame Suliman's personal errand-dog, is sent out from the palace to escort
   Sophie
   Hatter, who is posing as
   Howl
   's mother. However, Sophie thinks that Heen is Howl Jenkins Pendragon in disguise, so she begins a one-sided conversation with him, and even drags him up the endless stairs to the palace with her. Heen leads her away from the Witch of the Waste through a secret entrance to Madame Suliman herself.
  </p>
  <p key="577bfc1d-455a-43f0-b10e-aafcb6c329f8">
   Madame Suliman reveals the dog's true nature during their discussion, which certainly surprises Sophie but she doesn't voice this. She then explains that she has drained the Witch of the Waste's magical powers, restoring her to her original appearance, a harmless old lady. This is when Howl comes into the palace, disguised as the King.
  </p>
  <p key="b1605414-d4b5-428d-9b7b-fa8ce316ef99">
   When they make their escape from the palace, Heen jumps onto their
   Flying Kayak
   just as they take off, and comes to the castle with them. He lives there for some time, doing nothing more, it seems, than act as a family dog.
  </p>
  <p key="cb8f059a-124f-4856-9453-4e8eb6085032">
   When the castle collapses after
   Calcifer
   is nearly extinguished, Heen jumps after Sophie, and points out to her that her ring is glowing when she is too grief-stricken to notice. He leads her into Howl's past through the door, and leads her back out when their journey into the past is over.
  </p>
  <p key="e2083877-3dfb-47e9-9655-d07bdbd5fb5d">
   At the end of the movie, Madame Suliman is shown looking into the orb in her staff to see him, asking him why he did not report in earlier, implying that she sent him to go with Sophie to act as a spy in
   Howl's Castle
   . He reveals the scene behind him of a happy ending, for which Suliman calls him a "little traitor," though she does not seem terribly upset.

   , Heen had a more noble, human-like form as opposed to his final design as a dog with a face reminiscent of anime director
   Mamoru Oshii

   According to supervising animator
   Takeshi Inamura

   My Neighbors the Yamadas
   , but this dog should look malicious. I tried drawing him in a very normal style, but his legs ended up being so short I realized later their movements were obscured at certain angles. The key animation and animation must have been surprisingly difficult."
