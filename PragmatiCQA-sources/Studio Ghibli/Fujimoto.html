   When upon land, he uses a contraption he explains is a humidifier, to wet the ground with pure sea water as he is walking along it. This may imply he cannot go on land comfortably without it, or may have a risk of death without it. Also, when seen by humans, he is described as appearing very strange and perhaps shady, or to be avoided. This is only assumed, as he means no harm to humans although he seems to dislike them, especially with the waste they throw into the ocean.

   In his core he is a good guy, who cares about his daughters. He is just over-pessimistic. He hates humans, because humans pollute the environment, and more specifically the sea. So he uses magic to purify the sea from the humans’ waste. For that purpose he creates potions and elixirs, which if mixed correctly he pours into a well in one of the rooms in his underwater harbour. Because of humanity's destructive behavior, he becomes over-pessimistic. His wife,

   His daughter Ponyo has more magic power than him due to her not being born human like Fujimoto was. He is, however, able to create bubbles of air, or water, as seen when he is underwater himself, and when he transported Ponyo back to his underwater harbour.
