   , the setting was changed to Scandinavia to avoid any controversy due to depiction of the Ainu people. The story was also inspired by the intention to address an adult audience, to reflect societal changes in contemporary Japan and to portray the socialist ideals in the portrayed village community, where the protagonists not only improve their own lot in a coming of age story but where their personal growth benefits society at large as well. The film shows a place where the people are able to shake off oppressive forces and derive pleasure from their communal efforts such as subsistence fishing.

   Set in Iron Age Scandinavia, the film opens with young Hols (Horus) attempting to fight off a pack of  ¨silver wolves¨ and accidentally waking up an ancient stone giant named Moog (or Rockoar in some editions of the film).

   Hols succeeds in pulling a 'thorn' from the giant's shoulder' which transpires to be a rusty and ancient sword. The Giant proclaims this to be the 'Sword of the Sun', promising also that when the sword has been re-forged, he will come to Hols, who will then be called ¨Prince of the Sun¨.

Toei's Animation division was already in the process of reformatting itself to deal with the sudden demand for television anime series, but the competition was stiff. To make matters worse, many of the animators Toei had spent years training were being poached away to startup studios that were popping up in large numbers due to the new television market.

   Many memoirs and interviews from the Tōei animators have described the working environment within the studio during the early '60s as a democratic wonderland. Anyone, regardless of their role or seniority, could suggest ideas or changes, and individual animators apparently had a lot of freedom in the style and details of their scenes. The studio was well-equipped, and the workload was relatively low (in fact, Toei's original workflow model left many animators with nothing to do during certain phases of a project, so they were allowed to freely work on miscellaneous shorts during those periods).

In their eyes, Tōei had recognized the value of its staff, was at an all-time highpoint of success, and should be more than willing to spend a bit of extra time and money on a high-minded new project that would expand the company's reputation beyond just family-friendly fare while also being a spectacular, action-packed story of its own.

   Production on Horus started in Autumn, 1965 but, due to the perfectionism of the creators, was not completed until March, 1968, at a time when other feature-length animated films at Toei were made in approximately 8–10 months and focus at the company was shifting towards production of television animation. Director Takahata and animation director Ōtsuka approached the process in an egalitarian manner and invited input from the entire team for story board and planning meetings, a method which opened the door for Miyazaki to contribute significantly to the development of the story and animation.
  </p>
  <p key="2a1d14d2-dd24-4d72-b305-9698fc06c5da">
   The first draft of the screenplay was presented by Kazuo Fukazawa in mid-December 1965, and was endorsed by Takahata and

   (The latter two gave invaluable input). Miyazaki said in retrospect in 1983, "I can't talk about Horus. Really. It's a disgusting story, but it's youth itself. It contains all the embarrassment. I did this with Paku-san (Takahata's nickname) and we were both very young. He said that he is too embarrassed to say anything now. I was trying to draw a human being... I was burning with ambition."  In his eulogy to Takahata, who passed away in 2018, he was in tears when recalling how the production of "Horus" was a large influence in his life. "Thank you, Paku-san. Fifty five years ago, Paku-san spoke to me at the bus stop after the rain. I will never forget it," he said tearfully.
  </p>
  <p key="f3973b31-92ae-4d6b-b5ce-0f964d7d32af">
   The fifth and final draft of the script and the proposed character designs (Ōtsuka cleaned up the proposals solicited from all the key animators) were completed in the latter half of March 1966, which was more than two months behind schedule. Storyboard work began, followed by animation production.
  </p>
  <p key="d48e7229-8afc-45f9-ad3e-80547e4ddfb0">
   However, due to scheduling conflicts, production was suspended for eight months and staff were notified in October 1966. Only the storyboard work of Takahata and Ōtsuka resumed. When Takahata requested to lengthen the runtime of the film in order to fully realize his vision, he was soundly rejected.
  </p>
  <p key="2948e8d9-a6be-486e-96fd-41a2b95bd26a">
   When the suspension was decided, Ōtsuka was told off by Seki, the planning manager, "The company is asking you to make a prefab, but what you are trying to do is sturdy reinforced concrete,". He was furious at the constant delays and the lack of budget and looming delivery date. Ōtsuka noted that the staff were particular about maintaining quality because they believed that it might be their last full-scale feature film. Arguments strained morale for the animation team. Animator
   Yōichi Kotabe
   recalls, "It was a good experience for everyone, especially the union, to have suffered and completed it,". Animator Reiko Okuyama also remembers the difficulties they faced during production, "It didn't go smoothly from the beginning, but I think it was completed because of various conflicts,".
  </p>
  <p key="d4690883-adea-4f39-ab72-a33cb18699d8">
   In January 1967, production finally resumed and was completed in a year. Previews were made in March 1968. During production, Takahata was forced to compromise and cut several scenes while negotiating with the business side of Toei Animation. Production cost ballooned to 130 million yen against the original proposed budget of 70 million yen. During Takahata's funeral,

   discussed the deletion of a crucial scene set in a "Forest of Illusion" between Takahata and the company, and said that Takahata had been forced to promise from the number of cuts to the number of drawings for each cut, and that he had to promise up to the required number of production days, and that "Paku-san wrote a clean-up letter each time" for exceeding delivery times and budgets.

   , the film was the "the lowest recorded for a feature-length anime ever". He pointed out that the film "targeted kids the age of high school and college students", and that Toei did not carry out sufficient promotional activities catering to that demographic. The film has a reputation as being a "box office failure" including several testimonies by Ōtsuka. Tomoya Kimura wrote in 2016 that the box office of

   Upon release, Yasuo Ôtsuka's animation of Moog the Rock Hiant rising and of Horus' battle with the monstrous pike was said to have stunned audiences, as did the unexpectedly vicious opening wolf battle. Yasuji Mori's expressive character animation of Hilda is still legendary today, as is Takahata's carefully composed scenes, a startling triumph for his directorial debut. Another thing animation enthusiasts noted was Ôtsuka's use of frame modulation from twos to threes in the cuts of Moog the rock giant and the ice mammoth to reflect their massiveness.

  <p key="9ac9e575-8c17-4fbc-b18b-86124973fd29">
   As quoted in The Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture by Mark Schilling, a reviewer for Hakubunkan's monthly magazine Taiyō (太陽, lit. Sun) commented, in 1968, "In one corner of the world there now exists a commercial animation that has surpassed Disney and started to make rapid advances", after seeing Horus and The Jungle Book.

  <p key="f5903bf7-7a10-41d1-9e3b-859f7e9bd7d9">
   Helen McCarthy, in her book Hayao Miyazaki; Master of Japanese Animation, notes that the film had only a brief theatrical release despite its critical and popular success. McCarthy notes that Yasuji Mori's "clean and simple character design" for Hilda "allowed for considerable emotional depth and flexibility" and she observed that this style remained a powerful influence on the works of Takahata and Miyazaki throughout their animation careers.

   In his Anime Explosion, Patrick Drazen mentions the film as a pivotal work in the evolution of animation and writes that the 10-day theatrical showing was either a sign that Toei studio executives were unable to recognize quality or a ploy to get back at Union organizers like Miyazaki and Takahata, who didn't direct for the company again. Drazen notes that the ending scenes in the film were thinly disguised rallying cries for the union and student movements of the time, by whom the film was well received.
  </p>
  <p key="6b48ed08-875a-4da0-ae9f-a02e8666eb78">
   Drazen is among the analysts who makes note of the conflicted heroine Hilda, and writes that the character comes across as complex, working sometimes for good and sometimes for evil, and can be seen as the first in a long line of multidimensional heroines in the oeuvre of Takahata and Miyazaki.
