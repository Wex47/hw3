   The first half of the film is relatively faithful to the original novel, but the second half was changed completely during development, adding themes of war not present in the source material. The original author, Diana Wynne Jones' only request was that Miyazaki "not change Howl's character".
   She later gave a positive impression of the film, saying it retained the same spirit as her original work.

Suliman tells Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not contribute to the war.

   A few hours later, the city is carpet-bombed by enemy aircraft while Suliman's Blob men invade the
   hat shop
   . After arriving just in time to protect the shop from the bombing, Howl draws the guards away after healing
   Calcifer
   . He tells Sophie he is not going to run away anymore because he has something he wants to protect before leaving to interfere with the war. Deducing that Howl must be saved, Sophie moves everyone out of the castle and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, destroying the castle. She offers Calcifer some of her braided hair to give him enough strength to power a portion of the castle. They head toward Howl when the former Witch of the Waste discovers Howl's heart within Calcifer. Sophie pours water on Calcifer to make her let go of the heart, making Calcifer lose his power. The segment of the castle splits, and she and
   Heen
   fall down a chasm.

   Wizard
   Howl's
   home. It's scale changes from scene to scene, and its weight is unknown. There are multiple turrets on the top and turret-like structures in the front, but film gives no indications that they fire. It moves around the wasteland with four bird-like legs. To the naked eye, it appears more like a collection of junk and a living creature than a traditional “castle”.
  </p>
  <p key="329a9677-b519-4050-9078-02bd8b198093">
   Few know the precise location of the castle, but eyewitnesses claim to have seen it pass by several towns from time to time.

   There is a rotary switch connected to the main doorway, with four colors (green, blue, red, black). Using the switch and entering the doorway will transport you to either the  wastelands (green),
   Porthaven
   (blue),
   Kingsbury
   (red), and a battlefield (black). Later in the film, the order of destinations is changed to green, yellow, pink, black, with yellow becoming the town where Sophie was born and pink becoming Howl's secret garden.

   Calcifer's magic also holds the castle's structure together. If he so happens to leave of the castle, the entire construct would collapse in an instant. Towards the end of the film, the castle collapses due to
   Sophie
   and the
   Witch of the Waste
   dousing Calcifer with water. The castle is eventually rebuilt into a flying monstrosity.

   The castle's animation was inspired by a weaving machine in motion, and moved along with a heavy, creaking sound. Staff at Studio Ghibli were of the opinion that that it would be unpleasant to use metallic sounds while it was in motion, so they opted to use the squeaking sound of wood to express the castle's weight. They called on a local carpenter to the studio, assembled the building materials, and kneaded and captured various sounds that were rubbed, moved, and broken. The castle's sound design and movement was finalized in three to four months.

   According to French fansite Buta Connection, the film's message, "behind an apparent simplicity, is much more complex than it appears. From a simple approach to old age, we can then read several levels of reflection around appearances, pretenses and masks. In fact,
   Sophie
   is the emblematic character of this theme. She initially appears in a youthful guise, but her stepmother
   Honey
   calls her far too serious for a young girl."

   "After the initial shock of her metamorphosis by the
   Witch of the Waste
   , she gets used to her new body very quickly, despite her face being hollowed out with wrinkles. This curse is therefore more a burden, and gradually, Sophie adopts this tired body and deals with it pretty well, as seen in the scene with her and
   Markl

   Star Lake
   , since it corresponds to his state of mind: "I don't think I have never known such peace.”

   "But sometimes, at key moments, Sophie lifts the spell and becomes a beautiful young girl again. When she passionately defends the young wizard, when she confesses her love to him in her dreams, or when she sleeps, others can see her in her juvenile form. But the slightest doubt, the slightest fear brings her back to her old woman's body: she confides to Howl. As she explains in a fit of anger, she feels ugly, and one can think that her appearance of an old woman thus comforts her in her vision. By accepting her beauty, her love for Hauru, she will break the spell and can finally become this beautiful young girl with whom Howl is in love.'

   According to French fansite Buta Connection, "throughout the film, Miyazaki also leaves a common thread: the
   star
   . They appears early on in the film, when
   Sophie
   arrives in the castle. She gives
   Howl
   a small piece of paper which turns out to be a curse. We realize that it is a shooting star. Later, Suliman will attempt to trap Howl by casting a spell on him, which takes the form of a round of shooting stars encircling the wizard and Sophie. Then, our heroine will discover the key to this riddle:
   Calcifer
   was a demon in the form of a shooting star, with whom Howl will make a pact. This discovery will forever mark Sophie, whose hair will remain gray, like the color of the star, as if the discovery of the enigma were to mark her forever."

   "We understand then that the
   Witch of the Waste
   has always known Howl's curse too, hence her message and her interest in Calcifer. This symbolism of the star is one of the recurring themes of the story's universe: the three wise men and the polar star, the myth of Castor and Pollux turning into a star,

    Miyazaki
   </a>
   has fully assumed a romantic relationship between the lead characters. But it's also probably the only time its ending seems so idyllic, stereotypical and definitive. Usually we know that, with an open ending, Miyazaki leaves it up to the spectator to imagine any follow-up to his adventure. But looking more closely at the end of Howl's Moving Castle, we can look at a few elements that can qualify this point of view."
  </p>
  <p key="66235ad5-2af8-4d8b-afc3-42b97443cb7c">
   "First of all,
   Suliman's
   disconcerting attitude seems to send us a message: this terrible war is in fact only a simple battle of ego of sorcerers who play with their subjects like vulgar pawns. Suliman getting tired of this game, she decides to stop this apocalyptic war like a child stopping his game of Monopoly. The message is therefore much stronger than the apparent casualness with which Miyazaki seems to treat the subject."

   Howl's titular castle, which was barely described in the original novel, was conceptualized by Miyazaki as being made entirely of scrap iron, walkways, and has a gaping mouth spewing steam. The design is reminiscent of the creations of Jean Tinguely, a 20th-century Swiss sculptor artist.

  <p key="a9eed393-0274-454b-8094-533826559127">
   This technical challenge in animating the castle was be taken up by the team of graphic designers. The painted design is first scanned on a computer before it is broken down into several components and then pieced back together like a mosaic using Adobe Photoshop. The drawing will therefore be divided into a multitude of small fragments: the smaller the pieces, the more precise the rendering of the texture set in motion.

  <p key="9d57313d-f7d1-4e03-ae9b-fdf942af8fb7">
   Finally, with the Softimage software, the parts are assembled on a base polygon, paying careful attention to their order of superposition. Once the elements are in place, it is animated as a whole. In order to make the movement of the castle as realistic as possible, the graphic designers took inspiration from a full hiker bag with hanging utensils. The base polygon of the castle must make the superimposed elements move slightly offset. The castle then appeared asymmetrical, where Westerners are more accustomed to symmetrically designed buildings.

   As for the legs, several versions were made, such as human legs but the final design used bird's legs. Another question arose, how many legs would the castle have? The crew settled for four, as according to producer

This was the first time for Miyazaki decided to postpone the release of his films due to production delays. On June 25, the in-between animation was completed and checking was completed on June 26.

   In October 2003, after animation was completed, Studio Ghibli's sent a team to Europe to record ambient sounds. Since the film took place in an imaginary 19th century, Miyazaki insisted on authentic and "pure" sounds. The team faced numerous challenges recording pristine sounds devoid of electrical interference. In particular, they recorded the sounds of footsteps, then of horse-drawn carriages on traditional cobbled roads as well as ambient sounds of cafes and streets in France.
