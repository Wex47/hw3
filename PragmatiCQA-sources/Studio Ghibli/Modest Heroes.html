   was originally slated to write and direct a fourth short for the film, a seven-minute segment based on the Japanese epic "Heike Monogatari." Unfortunately, the short was cancelled when Takahata passed away from lung cancer on April 5, 2018, shortly after the film was announced. It is unknown how much work, if any, Takahata was able to complete on his planned short.
