After Kiki apologizes for missing the party, Tombo shows off the new dirigible that arrived in town for repairs.

   Kiki becomes depressed and discovers she can no longer understand Jiji, who has befriended a pretty white cat. She has also lost her flying ability and is forced to suspend her delivery business. Kiki has a surprise visit from Ursula at the bakery, who determines that Kiki's crisis is a form of artist's block. Ursula begins working on her latest painting, suggesting it was inspired by her encounter with Kiki. Ursula explains, "I decided to become an artist when I was about your age.  I liked to draw so much, I almost hated to go to bed.  And then one day, all of a sudden, I couldn't draw anything.  Everything I drew, I didn't like. I realized that my art up to then was a copy of someone else, things I had seen somewhere.  I decided I had to discover my own style. It's still difficult.  But then, the results...They seem to be a little better than before." She suggests that if Kiki can find a new purpose, she will regain her powers.

   As the radio reports that the helium within the dirigible is not likely to explode, Kiki takes a street sweeper's push-broom and regains her flying power and flies towards Tombo. The airship gets caught in the town's clock tower and the crew manage to jump to safety. Tombo however, is still in danger. Kiki flies as fast as she can and manages to rescue Tombo as he slips and falls. She regains her confidence, resumes her delivery service, and writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy.

   would be his directorial debut. Studio Ghibli hired Nobuyuki Isshiki as script writer, but Miyazaki was dissatisfied by the first draft, finding it dry and too divergent from his own vision of the film.
   Since the novel was based in a fictional country in northern Europe, Miyazaki and the senior staff went to research landscapes and other elements of the setting. Their main stops were Stockholm and Visby at the Swedish island Gotland.
   Upon their return to Japan, Miyazaki and the creative team worked on conceptual art and character designs. Miyazaki began significantly modifying the story, creating new ideas and changing existing ones.

   , the original children's book by Kadono that the movie was based on, is very different from Miyazaki's finished film. Kadono's novel is more episodic, consisting of small stories about various people and incidents Kiki encounters while making deliveries. Kiki overcomes many challenges in the novel based on "her good heart" and consequently expands her circle of friends. She faces no particular traumas or crises. Many of the more dramatic elements, such as Kiki losing her powers or the airship incident at the film's climax, are not present in the original story. However, in order to more clearly illustrate the themes of struggling with independence and growing up in the film, Miyazaki intended to have Kiki face tougher challenges and create a more potent sense of loneliness.
  </p>
  <p key="1db38940-a984-469b-a7b3-61541190449a">
   One such challenge is Kiki's sudden loss of ability to fly. This event is only loosely paralleled in the novel, in which Kiki's broom breaks and merely requires her to fix it. Miyazaki remarked, "As movies always create a more realistic feeling, Kiki will suffer stronger setbacks and loneliness than in the original". Kadono was unhappy with the changes that made between the book and film, to the point that the project was in danger of being shelved at the screenplay stage. Miyazaki and

Given how it occurs at the end, the dirigible had to be peripheral throughout the story so that the final scene wouldn't be completely out of the blue. We also had to come up with various approaches like the television broadcast to make it seem more real."

In the movie, a rescue firefighter's helmet read "Corico" instead of "Koriko". However, it is common for the letter c to be translated as k into many different languages.

   The depiction of the cat, Jiji, changed significantly in the Disney version. In the Japanese version Jiji is voiced by
   <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvUmVpX1Nha3VtYT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" key="5f5791b1-d8f8-40f2-9d4d-dc1a928181aa" title="Rei Sakuma (page does not exist)">

    Phil Hartman
   </a>
   . In Japanese culture, cats are usually depicted with feminine voices, whereas in American culture their voices are more gender-specific. A number of Hartman's lines exist where Jiji simply says nothing in the original. Jiji's personality is notably different between the two versions, showing a more cynical and sarcastic attitude in the Disney English version as opposed to cautious and conscientious in the original Japanese.
  </p>
  <p key="5c3205a7-918c-4ce2-b1c2-b4f3eca4b430">
   In the original Japanese script, Kiki loses her ability to communicate with Jiji permanently, but the American version adds a line that implies that she is once again able to understand him at the end of the film.
   Miyazaki said that Jiji is the immature side of Kiki,
   and this implies that Kiki, by the end of the original Japanese version, has matured beyond talking to her cat.
  </p>
  <p key="4b434ad8-950f-49e1-9767-0c6f29ef41bb">
   More minor changes to appeal to the different teenage habits of the day include Kiki drinking hot chocolate instead of coffee and referring to "cute boys" instead of to "the disco".
  </p>
  <p key="7a45a5cb-bcbe-4cd5-94a7-8a58c50b72cf">
   However, as outlined in the Release notes section above, the 2010 English release is once again quite different; many elements have reverted more towards the original Japanese version. For example, Jiji once again does
   <i key="bc64f3ba-dd2f-4605-8a57-5b58e5f60e7e">
    not
   </i>
   talk at the very end, and many of the sound effects added to the "traditional" English version have been removed.
  </p>
  <p key="b5704d16-04b2-4744-ac27-16e365cba19c">
   The English subtitled script used for the original VHS subbed release and the later DVD release more closely adheres to the Japanese script, but still contains a few alterations. Tokuma mistakenly believed the Streamline dub was an accurate translation of the film and offered it to Disney to use as subtitles. As a result, several additions from the dub appear in the subtitles regardless of whether or not they are present in the film.
  </p>
  <p key="2442ec2c-b3b6-4a0c-a23e-db9549e5e8ff">
   In Spain, Kiki was renamed "Nicky" because in Castilian language the phonetically similar "quiqui" is commonly used in the slang expression "echar un quiqui", which means "to have intercourse". The film was re-titled

   In an interview found in the liner notes of the Image Album, Hisaishi explained, "That's right. It's a fictional country, but it has a European atmosphere, so I thought about using so-called European ethnic groups, which are also dance-like." "I wasn't really aware of that, but for example, there was a Greek-like nuance..."

   "Yes. As I said earlier, my schedule was tight this time, so Mr. Takahata helped me a lot. Normally, I also act as a music director myself. However, this time it was difficult in terms of time, so I had a meeting with Mr. Takahata and Mr. Miyazaki to make a plan for which scene to put the music in, and based on that, I was allowed to compose. Of course, Mr. Takahata is also very familiar with music, so I'm relieved."

   "This time, I've reduced the number of songs that uses synthesizers. In the past, I used about half of the songs using synthesizers and other electric instruments, but in this work, the content is also realistic, so the whole thing. I tried to bring it closer to the raw sound. The other feature of this time is that there are many melody parts that are Mediterranean-like, and that are also dance-like using triple time."

   Takahata added, "I was trying to create a local color suitable for the film's European atmosphere. Also, I couldn't put music in the painful and sad places, or set a main theme song separately from the song. It's that waltz, but I think it's a characteristic of music handling that it is used repeatedly where Kiki's feelings gradually spread. I was worried during the song during Kiki's first flight that I didn't have a sense of speed and I couldn't add strange sound effects, but Mr. Hisaishi's music and Yumi's song were just right for what I was aiming for, and I was in a good mood. So I'm relieved."

   (1974) is an original song by Yumi Matsutoya and written for Fujiya's Soft Eclair candy. This song was arranged so sound like a country song. These distinct musical styles help the film not tie itself to a particular time period.
