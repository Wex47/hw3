   Keisuke
   found sketches of their parents' work. He would also become a fan of artistic duo Fujiko Fujio's manga

   . Since his father was rarely at home, Gorō  resorted to studying his parent's animation projects in order to understand and communicate with him. He would often speak with
   Mamoru Oshii
   , who is a close family friend.
  </p>
  <p key="1fd005a4-bb43-4e9e-998e-b11bc4a5a0b3">
   As a high school student, Gorō thought that he "would never be able to reach the level [his father] has attained." Gorō instead decided to pursue landscape architecture
   as he became interested in the nature conservation. His decision to study at Shinshu University was due to its proximity to the mountains, which reminded him of his time in high school. After graduating from Shinshu University's School of Agriculture, Gorō later worked at Mori Building Co., Japan's leading urban landscape developer, as a construction consultant in the planning and designing of children parks such as  Okaya Kohan Park and general parks and landscape design of industrial parks.

   Inspired by his father's plan he answered, "I'll do it", and promptly retired from Mori.
   In 1998, he became the representative director of Museo Darte Ghibli Co., the operating company behind the Ghibli Museum. He served as its director from 2001 to June 2005.
   In October 2001, he became the first president of Mamma Auito Co., and received the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Newcomer Award in the Art Promotion Division at the 2004 Art Awards.

Originally joining the animation project as a consultant, Miyazaki was asked to draw the storyboards. After viewing his storyboards, producer Toshio Suzuki decided Miyazaki should direct the film.

  <p key="b25cf10a-166b-45e0-9349-d6495d01cfb1">
   The move to direct the film caused friction between Gorō and his father, who felt his son did not have the experience to direct a film; the two were said not to have spoken throughout the movie's development. Despite this, Gorō Miyazaki was determined to complete the project.

   The film was released on July 29, 2006, to positive reviews, but received mixed reviews when comparing to the other Ghibli movies, and grossed $68 million worldwide. However, Miyazaki was presented Japan's Bunshun Raspberry Award for "Worst Director", with
