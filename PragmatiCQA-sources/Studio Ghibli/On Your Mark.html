   In an indeterminate future where the earth's surface has been contaminated by radiation, the human population has taken refuge in large underground megalopolises. During a brutal raid on a cult building, two police officers discover a mysterious winged young woman. Unscrupulous scientists remove it in front of their eyes, already considering it as an experiment subject. Haunted by this memory, the two policemen decide to try everything to give him his freedom...

    Synopsis

  </h2>
  <p key="31247db7-f80e-4038-afca-7de35e123d25">
   The narrative is told in a nonlinear fashion. This is likely inspired by the lyrics. Just as the song describes, the two men do not give up in their efforts to rescue the winged girl, no matter how many times they fail.
  </p>
  <p key="c83158fc-665f-4514-9d91-91e42b3a2c5e">
   The video begins with shots of a peaceful but vacant village, overgrown with weeds, with the enormous concrete sarcophagus of a covered-over nuclear reactor in the background.
  </p>
  <p key="11eaac63-e5a7-4244-8c7a-48511d9ad90c">
   As the music picks up, the scene changes to a sci-fi style nighttime military-style police raid on a cult. Futuristic flying troop transports crash through the windows of a tower topped by the gigantic neon-lit eyes and occupied by armed defenders. Anti-terrorist policemen exchange gunfire and grenades with cultists whose hoods depict an enormous eye, similar to those of the Dorok priests in Miyazaki's
   <i key="4244bbc8-197f-4397-8d28-137eb66f6aa6">

   manga. The police are victorious; as they sort through the bodies of apparent mass suicide victims, two of them find what appears to be a girl, lying unconscious, with large feathered wings on her back.
  </p>
  <p key="5c898217-65a0-4a46-a79d-23d975cd1633">
   The scene changes again, now to bright daylight and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo down an empty road. One of them helps the girl up; she spreads her wings; he holds her hands as she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go.
  </p>
  <p key="f91a4d84-c5c4-4357-af7a-ed0848ef9257">
   The scene changes back to the discovery of the girl in the tower (bypassing the original sequence of the raid leading up to this point). Only at this point are the two men revealed to be the two from the vehicle in the previous sequence. The two men carefully carry her out and offer her something to drink, and are encouraged when she sips. But a team of scientists wearing radiation suits arrives and quickly whisks the girl away after placing her into a sterile container.
  </p>
  <p key="22e6bcc2-2ee8-436f-a0b8-d41cfc873f0c">
   The two men are shown relaxing later, but thinking about the girl and looking somewhat morose—haunted by the fate this girl will suffer. The two hatch a plan - they are shown working on various aspects of this, then the pair wearing radiation suits and breaking into a laboratory and rescuing the girl. This triggers the lab's alarms, and the three of them escape in an armored truck. They drive along a narrow suspended roadway over what appears to be a domed city built in a crater. Police hovercrafts are in hot pursuit, and one of them collides with the roadway and destroys it, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses to let go of the hands of her rescuers, and so the three of them presumably fall to their deaths.
  </p>
  <p key="2d8fe0bf-bba0-4289-b863-e47254df310a">
   A brief montage of previous shots follows: the discovery of the girl, the girl flying through a blue sky, the two men rescuing the girl from the laboratory and stealing the truck, the truck plummeting amidst the wreckage of the roadway. But this time, the truck fires stabilizing thrusters and makes a short flight into the side of an apartment tower. The men and the girl escape; they are seen in their sports car racing through a dark tunnel underneath signs which bear radiation symbols and read (in kanji) "Beware Of Sunlight" and "Survival Not Guaranteed", then finally they emerge into daylight, passing through a field of nuclear cooling towers and past a sign which reads "Extreme Danger." Besides the green fields and trees, there are no other signs of life. This lush vegetation however hints that the radioactivity may have subsided long ago, allowing nature to take over.
  </p>
  <p key="0d675292-59cb-4308-a91f-e6db9ea427fb">
   As the car speeds down the road, one of the men helps the girl up, and she spreads her wings and gives them a grateful smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is gone drifting upward into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. From a bird's-eye
   view
   , we see the shape of the car veering off the road and slowing to a stop in the grass. Hayao Miyazaki implies that the two policemen might not be able to return to their old life, however; whether this is due to the authorities being on their trail or because of potential radioactive poisoning is unknown.

   (1992), were not major box office successes. Suzuki understood that Ghibli needed to release something that would have mass appeal, and making a music video for a pop group might have been the attention the studio needed.
  </p>
  <p key="b52553bb-a756-44af-8aca-2818eddd51e1">
   Thus, from January 5 to May 27, 1995, he brought together some of the studio's most promising young animators for this music video project and by the end, the budget nearly exceeded ¥100 million.

   “On Your Mark turned out to be a great distraction for Miya-san,” Suzuki noted prior to its release. “After he was done, his work on Princess Mononoke was able to finally progress slowly. “When it comes out, the music, the quality and the visual richness of the clip will mark the audience. However, as producer, I will admit that Miyazaki had not yet given 100% to the project..."

   Rumors floated around that Miyazaki accepted making of this video because he saw there the possibility of adapting computer tools within the framework of a traditional animated film. His main goal had been to merge hand drawn art with digital CG animation with this production. However, at the time, Studio Ghibli did not have an IT department and subcontracted this work under the supervision of Hideki Nakano. Two years later, the need for IT and a CG department would prove invaluable in the creation of

   Shortly before Ghibli was commissioned, the staff took a relaxing trip to Nara, Honshu. There, Suzuki, Miyazaki and fellow partners got to test out a new arcade game from SEGA. It was a space simulator and they were all amazed, except Miyazaki who said, "Such cheap illusions never fool me."
