   Throughout most of her career Yasuda worked on color designs for animators who employed the use of inks and paints for their creations but she also worked with digital media and used software like Toonz for her craft. At Studio Ghibli, Yasuda decided colors in consultation with Miyazaki and let the depicted objects guide her choices, based on the availability of materials and dyes in the time period portrayed. Her choice of individual colors and a color scheme was also determined based on the mood of each film, a particular scene and the personality of each individual character. In the Los Angeles Times Cristy Lytal observed: "For Yasuda, color is a storytelling tool that is every bit as powerful as words".

   In the article, Lytal quotes Yasuda, saying: "What I like best is when I am building up the colors in my head, thinking of how to get the tone worked out," and "Color has a meaning, and it makes the film more easily understood. Colors and pictures can enhance what the situation is on screen." In their book Anime Classics Zettai!, Brian Camp and Julie Davis made note of Yasuda as a "mainstay of Studio Ghibli’s extraordinary design and production team".
