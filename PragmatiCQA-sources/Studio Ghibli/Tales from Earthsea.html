   Suzuki recalled seeing Gorô arguing with his father over the construction of the Ghibli Museum and saw how the son took power over the father. This incident is what convinced him that he would be capable of seeing this film project to the end.

   Gorô explains with a certain modesty why he decided, at the age of 38, to embark on the making of an animated film: “I became aware of my undeniable attraction to animation, a feeling that I had for a long time. I pretended to ignore it, especially because of the relationship I have with my father." It is ultimately the discovery of Ursula K. Le Guin's work that pushed him to pursue such a foolhardy task. In Gorô's personal production diary, he explains his relationship with the series, "The first time I read the Earthsea series, I was in high school. I didn't buy the books myself, but read copies that were lying around the house. Now the Earthsea series goes up to the sixth book: Tales from Earthsea, but at that time it only extended as far as the third book, The Farthest Shore. At that time the book that most interested me was the first one. What was interesting for me about it was not the excitement of a magical realm, but that the story of the inner growth of a boy who couldn't control his own magical powers resonated with me.
  </p>
  <p key="7bed0f1f-025f-4a9e-9989-dfa29eb2af1f">
   As a high school student myself, I projected myself onto the protagonist, Ged. This time when, I was re-reading the books as part of the planning for the movie Tales from Earthsea, I discovered a totally different attraction. Then and now, stories about magicians, such as "Great Adventures in a Magical world!" or "Magical School Battles!", usually depict magic as supernatural powers beyond human understanding, but in Earthsea magic is depicted as a means to understanding the truths of everyday life.
  </p>
  <p key="cfb837e1-6208-4d07-a682-7d998848022d">
   In Book One, Ged's teacher Ogion says something like this: Boy, do you know how the roots and leaves and flowers of fourfoil change with the seasons? You must thoroughly absorb this knowledge, and can distinguish fourfoil at a single glance, or smell or merely looking at the seed. Then you will become able to learn its true name, and to understand the whole of its existence." In the Earthsea saga, magic is searching for the true nature of things and by knowing their true names, to work upon the existence of the thing itself. Thus, the study of magic is nothing other than the study of reality itself.
  </p>
  <p key="99a85fb1-7fdf-4429-a127-c7752ede1765">
   This way of thinking about magic was really a fresh discovery for me. When considering current fantasies, something like: "A story of gaining magical powers and adventuring in a fantasy world" is the first image that bobs up. But is that really the true nature of fantasy? This is the question in my mind. For instance, even a plain, everyday, question such as: "Why are sunsets so beautiful?" contains the mystery of existence and that is what I think fantasy is."

  <p key="5f690f7c-3c23-4cab-9ce4-83ff6d1458f1">
   Ever since the project began in the first half of 2005, Hayao Miyazaki fiercely opposed Gorô getting into animation and directing. Gorô and Suzuki resisted these protestations and soldiered on. The animators, also initially skeptical, were reassured after seeing Gorô's first storyboards.
   Yasuo Ōtsuka
   enthusiastically said, "Like father, like son!"
   Hideaki Anno
   was also surprised and wondered why Gorô did not start his career in animation sooner.
  </p>
  <p key="1154c730-e80a-4dfe-a12a-c612b4176264">
   Paradoxically, it was Hayao Miyazaki who accompanied Suzuki to convince Ursula K. Le Guin of the change of director. The director affirmed, albeit reluctantly, that he vouched for his son's abilities and promised they would halt the project if the proposed script by Gorô was not deemed satisfactory. Le Guin was not immediately convinced and was only after a tense discussion and the intervention of his son Theo Downes-Le Guin that the original author agreed to entrust the adaptation to the young and inexperienced Gorô.

     "My father, Hayao Miyazaki, was against my directing "Tales from Earthsea". This might sound abrupt. However it's something that I'd like to make clear at the outset. Also, to be honest, setting up this diary on the net, and appearing in front of everybody in this way, is definitely not the result of my own wishes. If there is something I want to say in my own voice, it's this: "Please watch the finished work", - that's all. My wish as a director is: "Please watch "Tales from Earthsea", with a completely fresh mind, free from distractions," - that's all.

      But once the publicity for "Tales of Earthsea" starts up, regardless of whether I like it or not, as the director, I can easily imagine that I will be labelled with the adjective "Miyazaki Hayao's son". Faced with this, the conclusion Producer Suzuki came out with was that obviously I should "let the work itself speak for me", but "in order to showcase 'the work itself' you still need to let them know you not as 'Miyazaki Hayao's son', but as the individual human being Goro Miyazaki".

   Production officially began in September 2005. Hayao had no intention of getting involved in the production and therefore left Gorô Miyazaki with complete freedom. The young director decided to document the production with a personal blog and a production log. For the introduction to his blog, he explained the message he wished to convey in the film: “What is it to live properly now?"

   . He likened this newfound freedom to the image as a challenge he wished to convey in the film, "The concept of "Independence" has a somehow impressive image, but in fact, it can't always be said that this is so. At present, Producer Suzuki who is serving as the President of Studio Ghibli, seems to hate the fact that they are independent from Tokuma Shoten: "When you get independence, both as a company and an individual, your work as a "company" increases, and you can't concentrate solely on making films. But Mr. Suzuki's fate of becoming president even though he didn't want it, could be said to be his own fault. Mr. Suzuki, through continuing to make movies, has followed the "life of doing", and the result is to put him in the uneasy position of "President".
  </p>
  <p key="6f072d1e-5f02-4bf9-899b-e7cd12eea786">
   "Ged too, through succeeding in his various quests to save the world from danger, becomes the Archmage, the head of the School for Wizards, but he himself is not very happy with it: "While I have been many things, and last of all, and maybe least, an Archmage..." This is the complaint of both Mr. Suzuki who unexpectedly became president and CEO and of Ged who is chosen as Archmage and CEO whether he likes it or not."

  <p key="eb4610c1-15fe-492a-8eb2-144a8aca6f07">
   Back in the 1980's when Hayao Miyazaki wanted to adapt the film, he wished to depict world of
   <i key="2a6cfaa0-0adb-4ac6-af26-eb6462d085bc">
    Earthsea
   </i>
   not as universe invented from scratch, but as a mishmash of several countries and cultures of different eras. Hayao wanted his staff to take inspiration from European artists, such as the paintings of Claude Gellée, known as "the Lorrainer", whose Roman temples constitute a recurring classical motif. For this adaptation, Gorô seems to have followed his father's original direction, taking inspiration from the works of Pieter Brueghel the Elder (1525-1569) and Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516).
  </p>
  <p key="04d42b43-5b50-4cf7-bec2-f32caebdecc6">
   The production team also looked at ancient ruins as depicted by 19th century European Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) and the Symbolist painter Arnold Böcklin (1827-1901). Hayao Miyazaki believed that architecture reached its peak with the Roman Empire and that this golden age could never be revisited. Hayao and his team also agreed on the general description of "Earthsea", a world where men built termite nests around once-majestic and magnificent historical and political buildings.
  </p>
  <p key="99fe5467-b492-43d9-8a1b-6e78be2be6d6">

   . For character animation, special attention has been paid to Arren, a hero stalked by the Shadow. Animation director
   Takeshi Inamura
   has done a lot of work on his expressions, many never before seen in a studio Ghibli film.
  </p>
  <p key="22e638c0-7677-4f22-942d-79d554cefae5">
   According to Gorô in his diary, "The animation director Mr. Inamura is a quiet, serious person. When he is concentrating on something, he puts out an aura from his back that makes it difficult for anyone to approach him. Sometimes he even shows me a nice smiling face, but those opportunities almost never come. Arren, the hero of the film
   <i key="1218fc93-d4ef-419c-9c38-be69ef7f2c2d">
    Tales from Earthsea
   </i>
   is, at first sight, a boy who it is difficult to understand what he is thinking. The one who made the complex emotions of this Arren visible on the surface is Mr. Inamura. When we finally got down into production, Mr. Inamura, who almost never says anything, said forcefully, "I don't understand this boy Arren". And "If I can't understand what kind of boy this boy is, then I can't draw him". At that time I had my first long conversation with Mr. Inamura."
  </p>
  <p key="9c6c7333-e407-4546-beb8-a5cf23f542b9">
   "After that Mr. Inamura stopped talking about that to me, but when I watched his expression during our animation meetings for key animators, I understood well that he was trying to draw hints from my explanations. And he started saying sometimes things like "because Arren's that kind of kid". I don't think it's any exaggeration to say that Arren exists as he does because of Mr. Inamura."

   Gorô and Art Director Yôji Takeshige spent some time reflecting on the atmosphere of the film's backgrounds. They sought to give the viewer an impression of depth by using more starker colors and reinforced shadows. This direction was a major departure from Ghibli's previous works at the time, and proved a difficult challenge for Head Colorist Michiyo Yasuda. Due to the chromatic depth in many of the film's backgrounds, she could no longer easily pick the light colors she was normally accustomed to using. Through sheer perseverance, Yasuda ended up establishing a graphic charter in accordance with the new style but Gorô recalls she got angry with Takeshige and himself on a daily basis.
  </p>
  <p key="7aa678b9-3030-4ed0-8acd-5bbf0531548d">
   Gorô shared his experience working with Yasuda in his blog entry dated May 8, 2006, "Out of everyone in the studio, the person who most comes out and says all sorts of things straight up to me, without mincing words, is the colour designer Ms. Yasuda. These are sometimes thoughts, sometimes advice and sometimes scolding. She was also the first person to sharply identify things such as my directing habits and the essence of the current work. I think that a lot of people know this, but she is a great veteran with more than 40 years of experience, someone who has been a pillar of Takahata and Miyazaki productions."
  </p>
  <p key="1f907d83-61fd-46f6-90eb-c225025a8db6">
   "Initially, two young staffers were to handle the color design, and Ms. Yasuda was supposed to occupy an adviser kind of position. I mean, she'd just signed off on 3 features for the museum and was fairly worn out. But, because both I and the two young staffers were all light on experience, we got stuck in a position where we weren't going forward. In the end, Ms. Yasuda wound up being the front person for us."
  </p>
  <p key="7f43ae5c-5eda-4552-81cf-78cb6914b911">
   "Ms. Yasuda has taught me a real lot of things. Not just the fundamentals of color design such as brightness, color saturation, how to think about mixing colors and so on. But that if you think about what the material is, the colors you can use decide themselves. That color is not just calculated figures, color should be based on the emotions and atmosphere you want to express in the scene. That color is not selected by adjusting numbers, it should be thought of as something created by mixing. And what a captivating picture is, and so on and so on..."
  </p>
  <p key="c76bf10a-399e-4398-a188-93656117db44">
   And it was not just color design. She really taught me all kinds of things. Such as:

    What to be careful of when painting-in character backgrounds.
   </li>
   <li key="a33f067d-ba88-45cd-afcc-e465e90be6f9">
    The differences in orientation between Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki as directors, and what the differences in the resulting pictures are.
   </li>
   <li key="8fdcf03c-f034-47e2-9697-d8e829cdd3ad">
    The differences between the era of using cels and paint, and the current era of using computers. And finally even the right attitude for work.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="a59a952c-32fa-4dc0-96fa-b1a748afc506">
   "Even now, it seems like everyday I am being taught something by Ms. Yasuda, noticing something for the first time, coming to an understanding of it, and then being depressed about it. Recently, I have been writing about Ms. Yasuda a lot, but when I think about what would have happened if I hadn't met her, I realize that however much gratitude I feel to her, it can never be enough. Ms. Yasuda is like a sometimes strict, sometimes gentle, tutor to me."

   . Throughout its production, Gorô was plagued with uncertainty, "As production enters its final phase, although the completion of the film has come in sight, on the other hand the worries have become more numerous. When I started, although there were a mountain of things that had to be thought about and that had to be done, nevertheless every day was part of a continuing series of discoveries. With the determination to somehow reach my goals, I gave myself up to the momentum. The feeling was like swimming, absorbed in what I was doing, in the middle of the current."
  </p>
  <p key="b84daa84-dc81-4113-9377-ec191e004896">
   "As the number of completed frames piled up, I became increasingly attacked by doubts about whether I was giving my absolute best, and whether I could succeed in producing a high quality work that met the expectations of so many people."
  </p>
  <p key="1dcc8b40-309f-4e50-939d-f631c47f63df">
   Gorô even likened the process to his time working in construction, "I used to work in the construction industry. Even at construction sites, things often go into high speed at the end. The line on the graph showing production (amount completed) curves up sharply at the end. That is, the later the process in the schedule, the less time it has to be completed in. This is what often happens at building sites when the project is on the verge of completion - the interior people are working all night."

This was his first experience with animation post-recording, but as learning the script, he has a really sharp instinct. In many cases we were able to use the trial run just as it was.

   "This line symbolizes Arren's character. The voice, which suggests inside a sense of resignation a faint hint of joy, gave me goosebumps. Even apart from that, he acted the role [of Arren] (from his introversion and the feeling of a faint hint of shadow inside him, to his sometime out of control emptions and occasional hints of boyishness) naturally, as if the natural essence of Arren's character was bubbling up.

   Series, gave a mixed response to the film in her review on her website. LeGuin commended the visual animation in the film but complained that the plot and the content had been changed drastically. She also praised certain depictions of nature in the film, but felt that the production values of the film were not as high as previous works directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and that the film's excitement was focused too much around scenes of violence. Her initial response to Goro Miyazaki was, "It is not my book. It is your movie. It is a good movie. "However, she was unhappy that the comment was disclosed on the movie's public diary.

  <p key="6411bdfb-4c09-4ddf-87c9-81fd9acddc59">
   LeGuin's mixed opinion of the film is indicative of overall reception of the film, particularly in Japan. In Japan, the film found both strong proponents and detractors. Many of the opinions can best be summed up in a response to LeGuin's comments on her website, that the weak points of the film were the result of "when too much responsibility was shouldered by someone not equipped for it. "In the UK, the film was not released as widely as previous Ghibli movies, playing to 23 venues across the nation and making an unremarkable £23,300.[citation needed] Reviews were generally mixed. Radio Times suggested that it "lacks the technical sheen and warm sentimentality of some of Ghibli's earlier films"., while the Daily Mirror called it "ploddy, excruciatingly slow" and not in the same league as the work of Hayao Miyazaki. However Empire magazine said it was "well worth watching" whilst The Guardian called it "An engaging piece of work" The movie at year's end in Japan was awarded "Worst Movie" in Bunshun's Raspberry Awards, which presided over by a panel of 32 movie critics. Goro Miyazaki also won the "Worst Director" award.

   We would also like to thank all the staff of Forecast Communications who have set up the server of this site. In particular, Yuko Dozono, who was in charge of the operation of the mobile site, gave us valuable opinions and impressions every day in addition to the quick update. Without Mr. Dozono's advice, a reckless "daily update" would not have been possible.
