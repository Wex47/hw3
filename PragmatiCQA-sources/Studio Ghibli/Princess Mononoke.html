   A week later Ashitaka wakes up in Moro's den and it turns out San had been nursing him.  He and Moro have a talk where Ashitaka says he wants the forest and humans to be at peace but Moro tells him that with the battle tomorrow that won't be possible.  They then have a heated conversation and Moro soon tells Ashitaka how she found San.  Before going back inside she too warns Ashitaka that if he returns she will kill him.  The next day he leaves and gives one of the wolves the crystal dagger for son.  Meanwhile, the army is starting to lure the boars out of the forest and since Okkoto is blind San tells her mother that she must help him.  Moro agrees and tells San Ashitaka cares for her, right then the other pup comes with the crystal dagger which she is in awe with.  Ashitaka soon sees that the Samuri have indeed taken control of Irontown and they need the men's help.  Ashitaka goes to get them, while running Yakul is shot and while he does tell Yakul to stay put, Ashitaka finally lets him come.  He soon finds out that the battle of the boars was a nightmare, they were put in front to lure the boars out and to make matters worse, Jigo's men didn't tell them about the mines they dropped, as a result the entire Boar army was wiped out.  They soon find a wolf caught under the boars bodies and when Ashitaka tries to save the wolf, poisoned darts are fired.  Thankfully the men from Iron-town help him free the wolf, and Ashitaka goes to find San and Lady Eboshi.

   Despite Ashitaka's efforts, Eboshi succeeds in cutting off the Forest Spirit's head while it is transforming. Jigo collects the head while the body is transformed into a god of death, as a result the land becomes covered with a lethal black ooze, that completely destroys the forest and turns the land barren. To stop the spreading ooze from reaching the villagers, Ashitaka and San manage to take the head from Jigo and by returning the head to the Forest Spirit, the land becomes green again, and Ashitaka's curse is finally lifted.  Even though San and Ashitaka have grown close, they go their separate ways: to the forest and to Irontown respectively. However, Ashitaka promises to visit San in the forest whenever he can.  Meanwhile, Lady Eboshi realizes that there is kindness in San and decides to rebuild the town, but a better/kinder one.

      The conventional period drama settings of castles, towns, and farming villages with rice paddies are merely distant backdrops. Rather, what I plan to recreate is the landscape of Japan where there were fewer people, when there were no dams, and when the forests were dense - when nature had a high level of purity with tits deep mountains and dark valleys, pure and rushing streams,  narrow dirt roads, and large umber of birds, beasts and insects.

      With this setting, my aim is to depict a freer image of characters without being bound by the conventions, preconceptions, and prejudices of traditional period dramas. Recent research in history, ethnology, and archaeology has shown us that our country's history is far richer and more diverse than we are generally led to believe. The poverty in period dramas has almost all been created from the drama in films. Disorder and fluidity were the norm in the world of the Muromachi period (1336-1573), the setting for this film. It was a time when present-day Japan was being formed out of social upheaval, when those below overcame those above from the days of the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (1336-1392), and the those of eccentricity, swaggering scoundrels, and the chaotic rise of new arts held sway. It differed from the period of Warring States (1467-1568), when organized battles were fought between standing armies, and from the Kamakura period (1185-1333) with its fierce and earnest warriors.

      This was a more unpredictable and fluid time, more magnanimous and free, with less clear class distinctions between warriors and villagers and women as depicted in the drawings of artisans and tradespeople. In such a time, the contours of life and death were very clear. People lived, loved, hated, worked and then died. Life was not full of ambiguities.

   Ashitaka comes from a tribe called the
   Emishi
   , which used to be natives of northern Honshū, that had been resisting subjugation by the Japanese emperor for centuries. However, the Emishi were defeated by the samurai of the
   Yamato
   clan, which proceeded to become the rulers and government of the Empire. The Emishi thus went into hiding, around the Northeast part of Honshu, Japan's largest island. By A.D. 1300, the Emishi were becoming integrated into Japanese society. However, Ashitaka supposedly comes from a tribe of the Emishi that had resisted integration and still lived in exile.

   On why Miyazaki chose to depict the Emishi, "I am interested in the native people, the Emishi. There are no drawings of them and no surviving customs. They don't appear in historical materials. Though they have been obliterated, they were Japanese people, as it were. They had an independent state before Japan became unified. I was interested in what their customs were like, but since we don't have any records, it was a blank slate. So I could do as  I pleased. I thought their clothing must be like those worn by minority tribes in Bhutan or Yunnan. They wore a kind of kimono.
  </p>
  <p key="e49766d9-523e-4600-ade6-0755b2bbaf08">
   Along those lines of thinking, their hair might have been in a topknot with the front part of their head shaved. I asked
   Ryōtarō Shiba-san
   (Japanese author best known for his novels about historical events in Japan), "What did the top of their heads look like?" He answered, " I think they shaved." And they wore head coverings. I had trouble figuring out what to do with the main character. Putting a topknot on him would suck me right into the period dramas of the past. So, taking advantage of the lack of historical references, I made it a Chinese-style topknot. I really like working on the clothing of the girls. They wore black costumes, most likely decorating their collars with embroidery, though we couldn't do that in animated drawings. I imagined these from what agricultural mountain tribes around Thailand wear... I had a lot of fun with this."

   According to Miyazaki, "I was creating a historical period drama, but it was unknown territory for me... The young Ghibli staff, however, don't know how
   kimono
   are worn; they match the edges together at the front like Western clothes. And the tie the obi in the same way they would clasp a belt. The kimono sleeves and the hemlines of that period were short. It was only later in the Edo period that people became better off and clothes became longer. But in making films, if we aren't careful, we wind up with characters looking Edo-period yakuza."

The motive for Shuna's trip may be noble, but it lacked personal stakes and thus cannot be taken seriously. Ashitaka needed a motive that the audience could sympathize with, which then became a journey to cure a curse that was inflicted upon him.

To save his life, the samurai is forced to agree to deliver one of his three daughters to him in marriage.

  <p key="0a4601af-ae0d-4336-90a4-df75b1dfbb5f">
   Computer animation such as fluid simulation and particle effects was used during five minutes of footage, including blood effects on creatures and San's face. Not all effects were completely digital, as one of the film's most iconic effects, the wriggling worms springing forth from the Demon Spirits, was done with a mix of digital and traditional techniques. This idea in itself proved challenging to conceptualize.

  <p key="fc0ea17b-233c-4d30-be5d-62be735c87ed">
   According to Miyazaki, "I wondered if it was all right for me to depict such a thing. I worried whether it was all right to give shape to a cursed demon spirit. Not whether to give it form, actually, since it doesn't originally have a form, but how to depict it. My staff were all at a loss as to how to give the image its shape. I have actual and personal experience of being overcome by such a sensation. At times, I have an emotion that can't be suppress, and it explodes so it feels like  a viciousness burst out from all pores of my body.
  </p>
  <p key="a194fcba-9b51-4914-93d3-bedd0716690d">
   When the young staff members drew the images, there was nothing made it seem like it was an offensive; it ended up being more like black squid-ink spaghetti... It was definitely a lot of trouble. The gooeyness of Lord Okkoto in the latter half also took a lot of time. The staff really did well. You know cutworms that come out at night from soil to eat up al the plants around them? My wife goes outside every night, flashlight in hand, to exterminate them. When she saw the film, she said I had made something incredible, the Demon Spirit looked as if masses of cutworms were growing from it."

   was assigned to release the movie in America on October 29, 1999. In response to demands from Miramax chairman Harvey Weinstein to edit the film, one of Miyazaki's producers sent Weinstein a katana with a message reading: "No cuts."
   Promotion manager, Steve Alpert, revealed that Weinstein had wanted to trim the film down from 135 minutes to 90 minutes "despite having promised not to do so." When Alpert informed him that Miyazaki would not agree to these demands, Weinstein flew into one of his infamous rages and threatened Alpert that he would "never work in this...industry again".
   According to Gaiman at one of the American screenings of the dub, the release was somewhat delayed because the original recordings deviated from the English script as written.
   Despite Gaiman's independent fame as an author, his role as scriptwriter for the dub was not heavily promoted: Studio Ghibli requested that Miramax remove some executives' names from the poster for the film, but the executives (Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein, and Scott Martin) decided that Gaiman's name was contractually expendable.

   The main changes from the Japanese version are to provide a cultural context for phrases and actions which those outside of Asia may not be familiar with. Such alterations include references to mythology and specific names for groups, such as Jibashiri and Shishigami, that appear in the Japanese version, that are changed to more general terms, such as Mercenary and Forest Spirit, in the English version. The rationale for such changes is that the majority of non-Japanese viewers would not understand the mythological references and that the English language simply has no words for Jibashiri, Shishigami, and other terms. However, some critics (Michael Atkinson, Mr. Showbiz) have said that the translation from Japanese to English and the alterations in which it has resulted have weakened the film somewhat.

   The English dub received mixed reviews from critics.

   The film was extremely successful in Japan, earning 19.3 billion yen and roughly 14.2 million viewers. As of May 2007, the total number of DVD and VHS shipped in Japan reached 4.4 million copies. During its first TV broadcast on January 22, 1999, on the Nippon Broadcasting block called,

   , it recorded a massive 35.1% in the Kanto area and 40.8% in the Western Japan area. It was re-screened in 2020 following the coronavirus pandemic.

  <p key="57c9e4ce-4aad-4715-ae99-54feae902d7b">
   The film became a hit for both anime fans and "arthouse" moviegoers in English-speaking countries. In those countries, it was widely interpreted as a film about the environment told in the form of Japanese mythology. Box office revenue in Hong Kong hit a record of HK$6.54 million. Disney's Miramax subsidiary purchased U.S. distribution rights, but wanted to cut the film for American audiences (and for a PG-rating). Weinstein and several executives were worried the film did not fit the typical Hollywood formula at the time, questioning the lack of romance between the two leads to its sparse use of music and sound effects in several scenes. They also demanded more exposition be added to allow Western viewers to follow the story.

   However, Miyazaki balked at this, and the film was instead released uncut with a rating of PG-13. Miramax also chose to put a lot of money into creating the English dub of the movie with famous actors and actresses, yet when they released it in theatres there was little or no advertising and it was given a very limited run, showing in only a few theatres and for a very short time. Disney later complained about the fact that the movie did not do well at the box office. In September 2000, the film was supposed to be released on DVD in the U.S., but Miramax announced that only the English dub would be included on the disc. Outraged fans demanded the Japanese track be put on the disc as well, and the threat of poor sales prompted Miramax to hire translators for the subtitles, which held the DVD release back by almost three months. When the film was finally released on DVD it sold very well, due to no limitation in availability. According to Ultimate Disney, the film is due for a two-disc Special Edition treatment in the near future.

   is a live action stage performance by Whole Hog Theater, A British theater company. The theater company proposed the show through Nick Park (of Aardman Animations fame), who the forwarded the idea to his friend, director

   The play was performed at the New Diorama Theater in London, England. Tickets for April 2–3, 2013 were sold out within 72 hours, and the repeat performance on June 18-29 was sold out in four and a half hours. The show ran for 130 minutes, and was well received by viewers. In particular was the use of recycled material for some costumes and props. One reviewer noted, "Their work, they write, “explores the outer limits of [their] and [their] audience’s imagination” (quote), meaning they envision ways to translate seemingly impossible elements onto the stage, sometimes in straightforward physical forms, sometimes by means of more symbolic representations (e.g. a huge sheet of plastic foil becoming a forest lake) challenging viewers to suspend their disbelief and use their imaginative minds instead."
  </p>
  <p key="d1d389b7-0264-4f43-836b-efb1083ea696">
   The use of puppetry was also praised, "The puppetry also delights in its attention to detail, whether it be the glowing eyes of various creatures or the fact that the humans in boar skins are clearly distinguished from the real boars. Surprisingly, the Whole Hog’s marvelous use of puppetry combined with light and sound even manages to triumph with what I expected to be one of the most difficult scenes to adapt to the stage: when the deer god loses its head while transforming into the nightwalker, the world consequently falling to its terrifying doom." The play itself sticks very close to the original film's script, and its fast pace made up for minor inconsistencies and directorial decisions.

  <p key="ebc823ef-4f1d-4d6b-9e69-b33a04888487">
   In Japan, the show was performed at Shibuya AiiA Theater Tokyo from April 29th to May 6th, 2013. The cast includes Japanese actress, dancer and singer based in New York, Yuriko Miyake. She sings the theme song "Mononoke Hime". Non-human characters were represented by puppets made from used clothing, waste materials such as vinyl and PET bottles.
