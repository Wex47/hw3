   The story takes place when the Tohoku region suffered greatly from famine poverty. In a small corner of the Taneyamagahara plateau in the Kitakami Mountains of Iwate Prefecture, Ito, spends the night with three farmers awaiting dawn so they can begin cutting the grass.
  </p>
  <p key="7acd3576-5d3c-4164-b76d-3d4798f14fb2">
   Ito falls into a deep sleep and has a dream. In his dream, he spoke with the staff of the Yinglin Police Department about a place where he can earn a living cutting trees to burn charcoal.
  </p>
  <p key="5569053c-1576-413f-9cad-1e8902bfe2f3">
   Suddenly, the spirits of the Taneyamagahara tree rose, the rose, and the rose appear. The spirits speak with Ito over whether or not to cut down the trees in the mountains. The mountain where the trees were "komon" is full of water, and akebi and mushrooms can be picked up for Ito. The land is rich and bountiful.
  </p>
  <p key="a6a27582-ee03-4526-93ae-243964d27a23">
   However, if Ito doesn't cut down the tree and burns charcoal, he won't be able to make living. The spirits that objected to cutting the tree said, "Then there is no way to cut down the tree. But burn me a nice charcoal." This is a mysterious story about Kenji Miyazawa telling people that they do are not the only thing who live in this world.

    In the days when Kenji lived, I don't think the lives of people living in the mountains north were easy. While enduring harsh environments and labor, he must have enjoyed the blessings of the mountains and the harvest of a small amount of arable land, looked forward to seasonal events and festivals, and lived with gratitude and fear for nature. Because they were such people, they were sensitive to changes in the weather and mountains, and sometimes they heard the sound of mountains that looked mysterious, and they might have felt something by watching the movement of light and shadow for a moment.

    I think it is a sense (ability) that modern people who have become insensitive due to strong stimuli and flooding of information are forgetting. While I made a living working in animation in Tokyo for many years, my thoughts were always in the mountains of Akita and Okuwa, where I was born and raised.

    I have been walking around the bosons of the mountains since I was a child, and I have used the experiences I have experienced with nature as a source of nourishment necessary for my work and child-rearing. I want to leave the city as much as possible and send it in an environment as close as possible to the countryside where I was born and raised, so I have lived quietly for 20 years living in Hachioji, taking care of the mountains of Tama.

    However, in this age when various information such as flashy things, huge things, and irritating things are flooded, it is difficult to live quietly by blocking the ear at all for such noise. And that's what I'm talking about. Because, when I live in a world without information, it is easier for the voice of nature and people's words to enter me, and in such a life, I feel that the power to feel something swells further by straining my eyes, listening, and interested in quiet things.
