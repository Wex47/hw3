   . The seal is protected by a protective spell. The seal is not seen until later in the film. It seems that the spell was also broken when Chihiro held the seal in her hands. The protective spell causes the thief to die and can only be broken by love.

   Then Chihiro brings the seal back to Zeniba and asks for forgiveness in place of Haku. As she takes the seal in her hand, she notes that the wards of the seal have been broken.
