As they wait, Mei eventually falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. He only has a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken along for the father. Totoro is delighted as both the shelter and the sounds made upon it by falling raindrops. In return, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds. A bus-shaped giant cat (known as the

   Despite the film's original proposal stating it was set in 30th year of the Shōwa era (1952 and 1958 in calendar dates), Miyazaki stated that he 'had no specific era in mind', and that "...it's actually a lie to say it was set in the latter 1950's; the truth is that it is a story set in a time before television. At first I thought of having the radio broadcast

   While Miyazaki stated that his film was set in an "era without the development of television",
   an interview on the film's Roman Album states that a reference to a Shigeru Suguira manga is scribbled on Kanta's notebook (Suguira's work gained prominence during World War II). "That was put in by the original artist,

  <p key="abf46f19-2516-414a-8770-c5fcb3d445f7">
   Miyazaki elaborated on this, "It is a combination of the area near Seijo Sakuragoaka where Nippon Animation is located, the area surrounding the Kanda River where I grew up, and the landscape of Tokorozawa where I live now. And the art director Kazuo Oga is from Akita in the north, so it looks a bit like Akita as well."
   Miyazaki also stated that rather than going abroad to hunt for locations like his previous works, he was, "...happy to make a movie full of fragments of landscapes I had seen in Japan, or remembered, or had seen in my childhood. For example, the large camphor tree in Tsukamori, the forest-although there wasn't really such a large tree, I felt I had seen such a large tree. We all have some tree we looked up at in awe of its size and grandeur when we were little."

  <p key="81955857-1c15-4b84-bbe2-8b6f09310335">
   As for what inspired the house that Mei and Satsuki moved in, Miyazaki recalls, "It was quite normal to see Japanese-style house with a Western-style attached room in the old days. Actually, that house (in the film) was only half-completed. The garden too-before a nice garden could be landscaped, the house was no longer needed... In other words, it's a house where a sick person has died... My thought is that basically that house was a villa that had been built with an attached room in which a sick person could recuperate. The attached room was for a tuberculosis patient... That's the backstory. So the old woman (Granny) was probably a maid hired to work in the house. That's why she is direct in the way she speaks, unlike most country people. As this is the backstory there's no need to explain all this, so I didn't tell anyone. But in my mind that's how I thought of the house. The fact that the attached room is so sunny also speaks to this setting."

Miyazaki warned him that extending the film by 20 minutes would only be enough to have a single protagonist, and that having the film be about two sisters would require far more screen time. Additionally, according to Miyazaki, he was initially worried as to how the young protagonist would met Totoro, so he came up with two scenes - one where she encounters him at rainy bus stop and the other in daytime at her home.

Then, this same audience would then be able to attend the screening of a second film, included in the price of the ticket. Tokuma finally agreed, establishing a joint partnership them and the much larger Shinchôsha.

Two possibilities were then considered: turning over the films in two six-month periods or dividing the studio in two and making the films jointly. The first possibility raised the question of whether the team would be able to direct Takahata's film and then immediately shift to Miyazaki's while managing the staff's energy and enthusiasm.

Nearly two hundred journalists were in attendance. Some have noted it was the 'most important' press conference for animated films at the time. On April 28, Miyazaki began work on

By the end of May, the first drafts of parts A and B were completed. This was around the time when Miyazaki changed the cut of the film to include part D. At the beginning of June 1987, the timing of part A was completed (214 shots for 1,166.5 seconds).

   was not achieved. To keep a high level of quality throughout the film, he decided to call on other subcontracting studios for the key drawings and other miscellaneous details. Despite the rapid progress of labor, this period proved to be the most challenging. It is for this reason that at the beginning of the fall, the team of Studio 2 left a day for a picnic of "motivation" in the valley of Akikawa. The studio organized this getaway during the week, without warning the subcontracted studios which, for their part, continued their work. “It's a movie to distract people. It is therefore better that the directors experience something pleasant that they will remember later with pleasure ”, explains Miyazaki.

   The opening sequence of the film was not storyboarded, Miyazaki said. "The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the time sheets. Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets..." Miyazaki has said that Totoro is "not a spirit: he's only an animal. I believe he lives on acorns. He's supposedly the forest keeper, but that's only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation." The character of Mei was modeled on Miyazaki's niece. The storyboard depicts the town of Matsuko as the setting, with the year being 1955; Miyazaki stated that it was not exact and the team worked on a setting "in the recent past".

   initially sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution rental income of ¥588 million in 1988. In an interview with American critic Roger Ebert on September 19, 1999, Miyazaki said, "Of the films we made at Ghibli, the first films, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind , Castle in the Sky, and Totoro weren't able to recoup their production costs from theatrical releases, We were able to make profit from secondary rights. That switched with Kiki's Delivery Service. So it wasn't as if we had a warm, receptive audience for animated films in Japan from the start. One direction my producer, Toshio Suzuki, and I have discussed and taken is that every time the audience develops an expectation about Ghibli films, we work to betray that expectation with our next project."

   In 1989, Streamline Pictures produced an exclusive dub for use on transpacific flights by Japan Airlines. Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film co-produced by Jerry Beck. This dub was released to United States theaters in 1993, on VHS and laserdisc in the United States by Fox Video in 1994, and on DVD in 2002. The rights to this dub expired in 2004, so it was re-released by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on March 7, 2006, with a new dub cast. This version was also released in Australia by Madman on March 15, 2006, and in the UK by Optimum Releasing on March 27, 2006. This DVD release is the first version of the film in the United States to include both Japanese and English language tracks.

    , Totoro doll, and a handwritten panel at the stop.
    As time went on, more and more people left their figures and notes in the bus stop, and this phenomenon was even reported on local newspapers in the 2000s.
    The area has subsequently become a popular tourist destination in the former town of Ume. In recent years, the number of Totoro dolls and panels were too much for the small area and had to be moved to a nearby small park. Only large cutout panels of Totoro and Satsuki &amp; Mei remain at the bus stop.

    In April 2013, the Saiki-Mokpo route was abolished due to a timetable revision by the bus company. Thankfully, the Totoro bus stop was left in place. Shortly after that, due to deteriorating materials, the bus stop was relocated and restored roughly 80 meters away from its original locations by the land provided by the local residents in late February 2015.
    It has since been used as a bus stop for the Saiki City community bus.

There is also a house known as "Totoro's House" located in the commemorative park of Aichi's 2005 Universal Exhibition, in Nagakute city, in the east part of Nagoya. It was introduced as "a nostalgic house where Totoro would be happy to live". The house was originally inspired by a design by Kensaburo Kondo of the Tokyo City Earthquake Reconstruction Bureau in 1924 (Taisho 13).
