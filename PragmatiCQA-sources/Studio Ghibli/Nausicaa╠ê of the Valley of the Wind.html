   One thousand years have passed since the Seven Days of Fire, an apocalyptic war which destroyed human civilization and most of the Earth's original ecosystem. Scattered human settlements survive, isolated from one another by the Sea of Decay. The Sea of Decay is a jungle of giant plants and fungi swarming with giant insects, which seem to come together only to wage war. Everything in the Sea of Decay, including the air, is lethally toxic.

   , the gigantic, armored, caterpillar-like insects who are the most intelligent creatures in the Sea of Decay). She is also noted for her empathy toward animals, humans, and other beings. An intelligent girl, and inspired by the mentor figure Yupa, a wandering samurai type possessed of great wisdom, Nausicaä frequently explores the Sea of Decay and conducts scientific experiments in an attempt to define the true nature and origins of the toxic world in which she lives. Her explorations are facilitated by her skill at "windriding"; flying with an advanced glider-like craft with a jet assist called a möwe. Yupa is searching for the mythological man in blue who, according to the legend, will appear surrounded by a sea of gold and reunite the people and nature.

   One day, an airship (a kind of large cargo airplane) crashes onto the cliffs near the Valley of the Wind. Nausicaä tries to rescue a hand-cuffed girl of her age from the burning wreck, but she dies after telling that she is Princess Lastelle from the kingdom Pejite and that the cargo of the airship must be destroyed. The airship is from Tolmekia and the cargo turns out to be a God Warrior (kyoshinhei embryo, Giant Warrior in the English release), one of the lethal, giant, biological weapons used in the ancient war.

While transporting the Warrior back to their realm, the Tolmekians were attacked by insects and subsequently crash-land in the Valley. The very next day, the Tolmekians, under the leadership of princess Kushana, invade the Valley to kill the Valley king and to secure and revive the Warrior. Kushana explains that the God Warrior will be used to burn the Sea of Decay, although Obaba, an old and blind Valley woman warns that attempting so will only enrage the Ohmu and lead to more deaths.

   Kushana attempts to return to Tolmekia, with Nausicaä and several others as hostages. Before their departure, Nausicaä reveals to Yupa a hidden garden of jungle plants, that are not toxic because they are growing in sand and water from a deep well. Nausicaä explains that the jungle is only toxic due to the toxic soil that is everywhere on the surface of the earth. The airships with Kushana and Nausicaä are attacked by a Pejitan gunship and several of the ships are forced to make an emergency landing in the Sea of Decay. There, Nausicaä communicates with several ohmu and discovers that the pilot of the Pejitan gunship is still alive. With the help of her glider, Nausicaä rescues the pilot from a swarm of enraged insects. However, they crash and end up in a strange, non-toxic world that is below the Sea of Decay; the plants in the Sea of Decay purify the polluted soil, and in this way produce clean water and sand, which remains hidden in this underground world.

To prevent Nausicaä from alerting the Tolmekians, they capture her, but she escapes with the help of Asbel.

   Bernard Evslin's

  </p>
  <p key="9505009e-bed9-444e-9df5-3f0cedff4de1">
   Miyazaki describes Nausicaä as a "fleet-footed, fanciful, beautiful girl. She loves her harp and singing more than any suitor or ordinary happiness, and her extraordinary sensitivity leads her to delight in playing amid nature. When Odysseus is shipwrecked and injured, rather than being afraid of his bloodied form, Nausicaä treats his wounds. And it is Nausicaä who melts his heart with her improvised Odysseus's ship sail out of sight. According to one legend, Nausicaä watches Odysseus's ship sail out of sight. According to one legend, Nausicaä thereafter never married and spent her years wandering from court to court as the first traveling female minstrel, singing about Odysseus and his voyage of adventure."
  </p>
  <p key="8dcff1b2-9d06-4389-a83e-c6162aff1554">

It definitely is not for little children (i.e., not for a TV audience) but if handled properly it could potentially appeal to all classes of young Americans and surpass the appeal of Ralph Bakshi's Wizards. The images in Rowlf may seem unfamiliar and grotesque to Japanese audiences, but by massaging them and making them more digestible, I believe the film could also attract young Japanese audiences."

   This was done even before the animation studio was chosen. An outside studio to produce the film was needed because Tokuma Shoten did not own an animation studio: Miyazaki and Takahata chose the minor studio [TopCraft]]. The production studio's work was known to both Miyazaki and Takahata and was chosen because its artistic talent could transpose the sophisticated atmosphere of the manga to the film.

   The biggest hurdle Miyazaki faced is how to adapt his own original work, without losing its essence and intention, "If it's someone else's material, you (as a director) can change it without hesitation, but if it's something (you made), it's not easy to be objective. Even if it is not drawn out from the original material, there is anguish and feelings in the back of each frame. The motifs in the film were based on the original, but it was hard because we had to re-order the scenes while changing their meaning / context, and then wrap it all together in '
   furoshiki
   ' so that everything would fit (the runtime) of the movie."

   Unfortunately, the resulting script Ito wrote exceeded three hours. According to Mr. Ito, "I didn't think it could be packed in more than 110 minutes by any means." With Ito's script delayed, Miyazaki proceeded to work on storyboards. In the end, Ito couldn't fit the entire story in the film's 110 minute runtime and left the project. Miyazaki, frantic at this latest development, rushed into production leaving the ending still undecided.

   The production faced issues in unifying the animators' drawing styles. Processes were set up to check each and every frame of animation so that the film's look would remain consistent. The staff consisted of animators from TopCraft,
   Oh! Production
   , and Free Animator. The core drawing staff consisted of 19 artists (at least 4 or 5 from TopCraft alone), reaching as many as 30 at some point.
   The reason for the large number of animators was due to how many were confused by the Miyazaki's detailed layout and 'drawing check system', resulting in numerous delays. As the number of animators increases, the individuality of each drawing naturally disperses, and the sense of unity in the animation is lost. Miyazaki struggled working from early morning to late night to correct any errors.

  <p key="e75fc138-bd9a-40f2-b86a-9357eb17d5e0">
   As a result, many of the expressions of characters in the film were rough and unrefined. Massive crowd scenes were reduced into still images. There was one bright spot -

   contributed massively to the quality of the film by creating dynamic action scenes and strong character poses. Miyazaki praised Kanada, saying he is "A rare animator with elements that give physiological pleasure in pictures and movements." Kanada would go on to work on 100 cuts, usually centered on flashy explosions and action set pieces involving Asbel's surprise attack on Kushana's forces or the crashed Pejite ship.

During a meeting in a local teahouse, Miyazaki presented this scene to Takahata and Suzuki and said, "Here is the end mark." Toshio Suzuki and Isao Takahata, who saw the storyboard, were silent for a while. Takahata asks, "What do you think, Mr. Suzuki?" Suzuki answers, "Hmm, it's a bit unpleasant to end." After several hours of discussion, they came up with three possible endings:
  </p>
  <ul key="07e0da64-64d7-49a5-b0b3-8a57d304aea8">
   <li key="350f2ead-6e25-4a4c-8c76-ef40e8002ef7">
    Plan A: "The Ohmu rushes towards Nausicaä and she stands before them. The film suddenly ends."
   </li>
   <li key="17796c13-7b45-47bb-9381-c3d3b7920ab8">
    Plan B: "The Ohmu rushes towards Nausicaä is blown away. Nausicaa dies."
   </li>
   <li key="2e6a2b7c-0bbc-4e17-ba3d-e3e32c449a90">
    Plan C: " Nausicaä is blown away, but then come back to life. "
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="210ff7d9-7b82-4843-9741-738450c56a67">
   Takahata then asks, "Mr. Suzuki, which of these three is better?", "Would you like to die and revive?". As the deadline for the film's release drew closer and closer, they had little time to decide. They told Miyazaki to consider "Plan C", to which he replied, "I understand, I will do it." Suzuki replied, "Is it okay to decide so easily even though it's an important last scene?"
  </p>
  <p key="31458767-8696-4ba0-8670-2735f51aafd5">
   After the film was released, Miyazaki expressed some regret on his decision, "That last scene is a regret." He later elaborated, "That's all you can do with the film. It's important that Nausicaa, the heroine, discover the real role, structure, and significance of the fukai, or Sea of Decay, and as a result trigger a
   Copernican-like revolution
   in understanding. I had decided that was about all I could show ina film version, but there were too many elements still in my mind that wouldn't fit into that simplified and it bothered me that I couldn't make them work. It's no wonder there were problems, because in the manga I essentially decided to write about whatever I wasn't able to depict in the film."

   In 1994, after the completion of the manga, Miyazaki was asked how the two version's ending differed and the choices he made, with the film being more open ended whereas the manga had a more definitive ending. He explained that, "If I ever had to go back and redo everything and make the film first, I'm sure I would do the same thing. There would be no changes." and that it would've been "ridiculous" to keep drawing the manga story after the film ended.

     "As I indicated before, films have an "end mark" or clear ending, so  I didn't keep creating the manga story in an attempt to follow the film's story. I frankly didn't worry about what I had done in the film at all. Mainly because I'd already forgotten most of it. [laughs]

     Yet, especially in the initial stages of making the Nausicaä film, I kept insisting that the story only represented a wish on my part, that I wasn't working from any assumed reality. But when the film was finished I discovered that I was actually up to my neck in the religious zone I had always wanted to avoid; I seriously felt that I had backed myself into a corner, and though, "Uh-oh..."

   . Miyazaki took the initiative to work early in the morning and work overtime late at night, and demanded that the staff work devote all their efforts to improving the quality of the work. The staff returned from the holidays and work until midnight until December 31st. Miyazaki himself drew many of the key drawings and layouts, working without break from 9am to 3pm. He had nearly reached his limit and appealed to Takahata and Suzuki, "We will never be in time for the release date!"
  </p>
  <p key="1f1a4dd7-d648-4503-814c-ca9cdcae1ddf">
   Takahata organizes an emergency meeting with the staff. Miyazaki thought Takahata would propose some sort of breakthrough, but instead said "We have no choice but to delay." Everyone, including Suzuki, who was present at the show, was so stunned that he couldn't even speak out. For Takahata, it was more important to "keep the quality of the movie" than to "finish it by the deadline". After awkward silence due to Takahata's remarks, Miyazaki was furious, saying, "I can't say anything more because the producer says this."
  </p>
  <p key="ee0709b7-e41c-446a-b6cb-cd7d4e4ae4c3">
   Following this, the staff worked day and night. Miyazaki decided to cut corners by not animating large crowd scenes. The planned final fight between the God Warrior and the Ohmu, which was storyboarded, was completely cut. The second half of the film had a complicated action scene involving Yupa fighting off Tolmekian soldiers. That too was cut, with one character remarking 'I don't have time!' The soldiers are killed with a simple depiction of a quick flash.

  <p key="8cbed778-12a2-4901-be78-7b3327735a0b">
   Later when Hideaki Anno saw this scene, he joked, "This is where it suddenly looks like Ishikawa Goemon (from

   ) (laughs)." However, as a result of mercilessly cutting scenes, work efficiency gradually improved, and they were miraculously  able catch up with the proposed release date. By February, much of they animation had been drawn, but the cels were yet to be painted. The painting team, comprised mostly of women, scrambled and worked nearly 24 hours a day. Suzuki noted one woman couldn't go home for three days straight, wearing the same clothes the entire time.

   The producers scrambled for three months to complete the film's sound mixing. Voice actors wore special masks made of rubber attached to a paper cup while recording certain scenes. The technique required various trials and errors until the proper effect was achieved.

   The film was released in March 1984, with a production schedule of only nine months (May 31, 1983 to March 6, 1984) and with a budget equivalent to $1 million. Over 56,078 drawings were made, and 263 colors were used.

   . According to Nausicaa.net, the voice actors and actresses were not even informed of the film's plotline and more than 30 minutes of the movie were cut from the film because New World felt that "the parts were slow moving". As a result, part of the film's narrative meaning was lost; some of the environmentalist themes were diluted as was the main subplot about the Ohm, altered to turn them into aggressive enemies. Most of the characters were renamed (for example, Nausicaä became "Princess Zandra"). The cover for the VHS release featured a cadre of male characters, who are not part of the film, riding the resurrected God Warrior — including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback. It was released around the world under various different titles, such as
