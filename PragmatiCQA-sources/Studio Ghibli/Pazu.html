   Pazu is an energetic, amicable young boy with a heart of gold, always willing to help out wherever needed. He's a dedicated and hard worker in the mines, and is also particularly enamored with technology. While a persistent and loyal friend, he is also a bit naive at the outset, taking Sheeta's dismissal and request for him to forget Laputa to heart until
   Dola
   explains her real intention. He displays a courageous though sometimes reckless drive, often putting himself in direct danger to defend his friends, especially Sheeta. He is also very clever and observant, as is shown when he comes up with a plan to save Laputa.

   Pazu is an orphan who lives alone in a small hut atop a hill in Slag Ravine. While no mention is made of his mother, his father was an avid aviator who, though no one had believed him, had previously discovered and photographed the floating kingdom of Laputa. After his death, Pazu swore that he would find Laputa and prove his father right.

   military
   , and Pazu promises to stay by her side. They come across
   Uncle Pom
   , who tells the pair of a long-lost element known as Aetherium, which Sheeta's crystal is fashioned from, bringing about the revelation that Laputa must indeed exist as they were the only ones who knew how to make such crystals.
  </p>
  <p key="44343df3-691e-4d67-b74c-ddbba461a219">
   Upon leaving the mine, Pazu and Sheeta are captured by the military and separated, with Pazu being locked away in a tower cell at Tedus Fort. He is set free, however, when Sheeta makes a deal with the military to stay and help find Laputa in exchange for his release. Hurt by her decision, Pazu returns home, only to discover that Dola's gang have taken over his home as a temporary base. After Dola points out that Sheeta likely saved his life by sending him away, Pazu asks to join them to rescue her, vowing to protect her properly this time. Dola accepts this, and the group heads for Tedus. Once there, however, they discover it in flames, and Sheeta clinging to a Laputian robot atop one of the towers. Pazu and Dola manage to rescue her, and he asks if they can continue to sail with the gang until they find Laputa.

   in the airship's engine room. Later that night, Sheeta joins him on his watch in the ship's crow's nest, and the two have a heartfelt conversation about their situation and their duty to keep Laputa's power from falling into the wrong hands, during which he promises that, once it's over, he'll return with her to her home in
   Gondoa
   . This conversation is cut short when the ship is discovered by

   The pair survive and awaken to discover that they've landed on Laputa. However, shortly after the Goliath docks with the kingdom and Pazu and Sheeta discover that the military has taken the pirates hostage. In their attempt to rescue them, Sheeta is recaptured and Pazu is nearly shot. He evades the military and sets Dola and her gang free, taking Dola's canon with him as he goes after Sheeta. After a harrowing climb, Pazu manages to find his way into the Laputian underground where Sheeta was taken, and discovers her being pursued by Muska. Separated by a wall, Sheeta hands him her crystal and desperately instructs him to throw it into the ocean. Pazu is once again almost shot, the bullet destroying his aviator goggles. He blasts through the wall and goes after Sheeta, who he finds cornered by Muska in the Laputian throne room. Pazu bluffs that he has hidden the stone and that Muska will never get it back if he harms Sheeta. Muska relents and gives the pair one minute to talk. Pazu uses this time to instruct Sheeta to tell him one of the spells she knows - the Spell of Destruction - so that they can destroy Laputa, and reassures her that Dola and her pirates are free. Together, they recite the spell and destroy the lower section of Laputa, so as not to let it fall into Muska's hands. After that, they wave goodbye to gang as they have the treasure from the castle, he retires to be a miner and lives a farm in Gondoa.

    As part of the production notes for the movie's Viz Media official art book, Mr. Miyazaki remarked about how he debated having the ornithopter fly at the end of the film for the children's return to Gondoa.
