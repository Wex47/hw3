   <i key="5e52de1e-873a-4422-9de2-e0f8c909add3">
    Yamato
   </i>
   was about to be adapted into a an animated film, "It was at the end of this year that the information that came to the Terebi Land editorial office that Space Battleship Yamato was going to be made into a movie."
  </p>
  <p key="27c1c59d-8577-4183-b3f3-831098c85e88">
   "It was said that Yamato was becoming a big movement. The anime first appeared as a TV series in October 1974. This story goes back a bit, but I had encountered Yamato that June during the annoying rainy season. There was a visitor in the editorial office. He was a well-dressed man who gave me a stylish impression. He said, “We are going to air an animation called Space Battleship Yamato on Yomiuri TV. I would like you to do a feature on it in your magazine.”
  </p>
  <p key="929acb9a-6a76-47ce-b392-cb8c82d87157">
   "The business card he presented to me read, “Office Academy Producer Yoshinobu Nishizaki.” I took the thick proposal book from him and said, “Let me think about it.” At that point, I could not have predicted that this encounter with Yamato would turn out to be fateful.
  </p>
  <p key="6f3a2bf3-2d03-4a33-8904-94363edb03bf">
   "This was news enough to ignite my passion. I decided immediately, “Okay, let’s do a Yamato movie Complete Works book!” I wasn't 100% sure about it. But I wanted to take action first and then we could think about it after we started running. Otherwise, nothing would move forward. On the other hand, there had always been a certain indifference to this kind of magazine at the company. Most of us had no idea about animation. Even the sales staff, who were supposed to be the most sensitive to market trends, did not show much interest. Therefore, I was afraid that this book might be crushed if I didn't do a good job with it. I couldn't shake off such anxiety."

   Ogata applied a "guerilla strategy" to get the artbook approved by his superiors. He spun-off the

   The Roman Album sold out instantly. "Although it was not released in time for the movie premiere on August 6, 1977, the first 100,000 copies of the Yamato Roman Album appeared in bookstores on August 27 and were almost sold out by the 10th day. On September 6, the second printing of the book sold 100,000 copies, and it went on to a further eight printings. By September 1978, the total number of copies sold was 400,000, making it a hit product."

   The year of 1978 proved to be a critical year for Ogata. "Fortunately, there was a “special demand for Yamato” in the previous year, and the editorial department for children and boys made 810 million yen in sales, a growth of 102.5% over the previous year (1976). However, Terebi Land magazine was still treated as the king of deficits. It was still referred to by the derogatory term “pistol magazine.” I was in a panic. I was desperate. I had to transform myself into the “king of surplus.”
  </p>
  <p key="f8323556-dd88-4bb5-9c58-ccf132ea34f6">
   Ogata expressed his plans to start a new magazine. His colleague

   </a>
   , expressed concern with his decision. “But you’ve got your hands full with Terebi Land, and now you want to work on a new magazine…” Ogata explains himself in his memoirs, "His anxiety was justified. That’s why I was thinking of outsourcing this new magazine. But we had so many differences of opinion that we decided against it. I decided to edit it internally, even if I had to give it to someone from the editorial department of Terebi Land. Suzuki also raised a question about the sales aspect."
  </p>
  <p key="ecbccd0d-8d03-4d3a-977a-400a755dc21f">
   “If it becomes a regular monthly magazine, the sales department might get noisy…”, Suzuki responds.
  </p>
  <p key="8e925440-025d-4c19-8d2b-e67c5915e063">
   “Then I’ll put a mosaic over the real intention of the new magazine. For now, we’ll call it a Terebi Land Separate Volume. I don’t think sales would get wise to it, and the agency won’t complain." After elaborating on his plan, Suzuki finally sees his way, "In this way, Suzuki eventually agreed to the proposal, and we began to work on the format. I had already seen Suzuki’s thoughts. We’ve known each other for a long time, and we’re on the same page, and he likes new things. He is also a technocrat who knows a lot about layout and printing. If he didn’t say yes, Animage would end up being a mere figment of my imagination. I always thought of him as “my fellow rebel,” and the two of us wanted to upend the world of strangers to anime."

   , Ogata had several theories, "It is better to limit the number of characters to five to make it clearer. The more crisp it sounds, the more powerful it is. Even if it’s not related to the content, an eccentric name is much more interesting."
  </p>
  <p key="1a8fe591-98c4-4e70-8bd7-9b83e98c04b2">
   "There are many theories, and if some have already been tried, you can’t use them. It’s a continuous struggle to decide on a title and a catchphrase.

   According to Ogata, the planning started in October of the previous year (1977), and the full-scale production launch was in March 1978. "It was a rush job, so there was some inexperience. I was worried. Magazine sales surveys are usually divided into three rounds to collect data. The final return rate [of unsold copies] would be determined a month after publication."
  </p>
  <p key="f6013ec4-9381-48e2-994a-8015a733b242">
   When asked how did Animage do? Ogata provided these figures, "58% on day 4, 82.3% on day 11, and 95.6% on day 25. It was a near perfect game. The return rate was less than 5%. The sales team had expected 21.6% before the launch, so it must have been an unexpected miscalculation on their part. Honestly, I was just happy. I felt like I was standing at the top of the clouds rising in the summer sky after the rainy season had ended."
  </p>
  <p key="e2603d5e-e92d-4ad5-9dfc-45e58f4dabd5">
   Ogata explained two factors to the magazine's success: its avant-garde nature in the animation genre, and that there were no strong rivals at the time.

   Two entries at the Studio Ghibli production blog comment on Ogata's death and memorial service, which was limited to friends and family. According to the blog, Mr. Suzuki gave condolences to the family immediately upon hearing of Mr. Ogata's passing, and Hayao Miyazaki read a eulogy at the memorial service. The blog honors Mr. Ogata as “a mentor [to Mr. Suzuki] unlike any other in his lifetime,” and thanks Mr. Ogata for his contributions “not only to Mr. Takahata, Mr. Miyazaki and Mr. Suzuki but to Studio Ghibli.”
