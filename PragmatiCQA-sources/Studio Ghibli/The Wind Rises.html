   In the movie, Jirō starts out as a young boy living in a provincial town in Japan, who dreams of a day when he could design and possibly fly airplanes. However, much to his dismay, his eye-sight deteriorates rapidly, preventing Jirô from ever piloting an aircraft. His hopeless longing even leads to dreams where he would fall from an airplane he was piloting, as his eyes could not withstand the pressure of high altitudes. Desperate to find a way to overcome his weakness and follow his goal, he seeks help and guidance from Giovanni Caproni, a famous Italian aircraft designer who appears to Jirô in his dreams. Caproni encourages Jirô to become an aeronautical engineer, as he could then follow his desire to design airplanes without actually having to fly one.

   Determined to become an aeronautical engineer one day, Jirô studies the principles of aviation throughout his academic years, continuously seeking guidance and encouragement from Caproni along the way. By the time he is an adult, he is able to enter the University of Tokyo to study aeronautics. Boarding a train, he makes his way to the Kanto region of Japan. During the journey, he meets Naoko, a young girl traveling with her maid, for the first time. An unprecedented, deadly earthquake suddenly hits the Kanto region, leaving the city in devastation and fire. The passengers inside the train flee from the train, as the damaged boiler threatens to explode. As Jirô starts to leave, he notices that Naoko's maid had broken her leg during the commotion caused by the earthquake. Strapping his slide-ruler to the side of her leg, Jirô leads both Naoko and her maid to safety. Jiro's actions win affection and gratefulness from Naoko and her maid, but they can not express their thankfulness to him, as Jirô leaves without telling them who he is.

   Years later, Jirô works as an aircraft manufacturer and designer for a company in Nagoya, Japan. His first assignment to build a fighter with a design team ends in failure, and the company is forced to give up its contract to a rival company. Redirecting its attention to the designing of a heavy bomber, the company sends Jirô to Germany to study the technical advances of the German Junker aircraft designs. Jirô, with difficulty, succeeds in procuring the necessary designs from the grudging Germans and returns to Japan. Some years later, Jirô is reassigned to a fighter project funded by the Imperial Japanese Navy as the design team's chief designer. This project also ends in failure, causing Jirô to fall into a state of severe disappointment. The company, anxious to have their chief designer back in form, sends Jirô away to a summer resort to recover. There, he meets Naoko once again, now grown into a beautiful young woman. The two soon fall in love, sharing a passionate romance. However, when Jirô proposes to Naoko, she refuses, saying that she was inflicted with tuberculosis. She earnestly entreats Jirô to wait for their marriage until she is cured, which Jirô gently accepts.

In order to avoid the attention of the Japanese secret police, the company sets Jiro's lodgings at one of his supervisor's residences. With the help of his design team, Jirô plans the construction of Japan's future naval fighter, regarding it as a revolutionary step in aeronautics.

Jirô expresses his regret and sorrow of the destruction and devastation his "Zero" fighter had caused during the war. Caproni comforts him, saying that "his dream was nonetheless realized" and that airplanes "are beautiful, cursed dreams". Caproni then directs Jiro's attention beyond the grassy hill they were standing on. Jirô, stunned with joy, sees Naoko coming towards him, holding a parasol in her hand. Waving to Jirô, she calls to him, "you must live, darling...you must live!" Jirô, barely able to speak, nods his head. Her last message complete, she rises with the wind, vanishing from sight. Continuing his walk with Caproni, Jirô looks to the sky and the wind, taking his wife's words deeply to heart.

     There are many works from local artists which reflect melancholy and sadness. However, the works of Tatsuo Hori are among the very few which were created during the Showa period (the early 1930s). Reminiscent of his work is the modern writings of Haruki Murakami and Kawabata Yasunari. The only difference is that most of Murakami’s work is translated to more than 50 languages, including English, Chinese, and more. Interestingly (and coincidentally), the main character from Murakami’s most popular work (Norwegian Wood) is also named Naoko who also goes to a secluded sanatorium in the mountains, just like the main character from The Wind has Risen. Both works explore pain, nostalgia, longing, and sadness caused by an unbearable, unpredictable, and irreversible loss.  Both novels have melancholic and nostalgic vibes.

   Jirô Horikoshi
   in 2008.

  <p key="dd7a978f-0828-476c-9f40-fbc5eee8c230">
   The story in the manga follows the historical account of Horikoshi's aircraft development up to 1935 (the year of the Mitsubishi A5M maiden flight),
   and intertwines with fictional encounters with Caproni and Naoko Satomi.

But his family past also resurfaces through the Zero plane itself: in an interview with Télérama (n° 3338, January 4, 2014), Miyazaki explained that this film was a way to reconcile with his own father. The latter had provided rudders for the Zero plane. Miyazaki, born in 1941 and anti-militarist, argued many times with his father over this. By staging Jirô, he wants to try to understand his father's motivations, without judging him, without condemning him.

   . According to Buta Connection, Miyazaki explained, "For me, drawing this manga is just a hobby. Making a movie about it is simply out of the question. Entertainment must be made for children. We must not make a film that is only intended for an adult audience."
  </p>
  <p key="381c5385-0c5f-4519-95af-7f682834134e">
   However, Miyazaki changed his objection after a staff member suggested that "children should be allowed to be exposed to subjects they are not familiar with". Miyazaki was inspired to make the film after reading a quote from Horikoshi: "All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful".

   . Miyazaki was determined in depicting Japan during the Taishô era and the beginning of the Shôwa era as accurately as possible. The biggest challenge Miyazaki presented himself was the depiction of large crowd scenes, “The characters who make up the crowd around the main characters are not just anyone,” explains Miyazaki. “These are characters who have their own existence within the film. You should not animate them just any way, but really bring them to life." Thus, just for a four-second seconds, it took no less than 1 year and 3 months of work for a team of animators to come to the end. Miyazaki is happy with the result.

  <p key="65e7611f-c85b-4faa-b934-06ad68f9fb67">
   On February 18, 2012, an unexpected event delays the production of the film. Miyazaki remained locked in his private workshop only to come out two days later not feeling well. Suzuki advised him to go see a doctor out of caution, but the director refused, saying it was a waste of time. “Even if I die, I have to leave all my

  </p>
  <p key="84651a81-16a1-4953-9981-90b6416fdafd">
   By October 2012, Miyazaki continued to struggled with the morality of the film, as well as its ending. Miyazaki had trouble finding Jirô's feelings in the face of the paradox of his dream of wanting to create a plane, which in the end will turn out to be a war plane. He also concluded that the Zero managing to fly is not necessarily an appropriate end for the film. And he always asks the same question: "Jirô is building a war plane." What final should we write? What satisfactory end should the film end with, beyond the completion of this plane?". Miyazaki struggled with creating a satisfying finale, "From the beginning, I knew it would not be easy. But this is really difficult."
  </p>
  <p key="b84c2996-7584-4c57-af4b-819a90a24e48">
   During one weekend, Hayao Miyazaki went to see a photo exhibition at the Tama Zenshôen National Sanatorium. Leprosy could apparently not be transmitted to others. But at the time, he saw how the sick were kept away from society. Despite this forced isolation, the suffering tried to live with dignity. This visit knocked Miyazaki down a bit. On the way home, he and his wife didn't talk about the exhibit at all. But through it, the director draws the lesson that one should not live his life in half measures.
  </p>
  <p key="65759355-325c-4abc-aa0b-24f872896dc2">
   Suddenly, Miyazaki began to retouching Jirô's expressions on certain shots put aside by the animators. Miyazaki thought that Jirô must feel something stronger about his failures. He changes his face, including baring his teeth, to accentuate his determination to move forward. His face becomes more precise. “For the people of that time, war was not a choice,” he explains. “It was like that. In other words, it's like now. Every era knows upheavals, but even with that, one must live fully."
  </p>
  <p key="b5800e23-dffb-43c3-9e4c-1275bc960925">
   He also goes back to the film's intension note and writes: "With each upheaval in an era, everyone's dreams are perverted. The questions do not necessarily find answers. But despite life's obstacles, you still have to live with strength."
  </p>
  <p key="1061bae9-c11d-4a75-a220-50831da7f454">
   In time, Miyazaki shifted his focus on the love story between Jirô and Naoko, as Naoko's condition worsens at the sanatorium. With these romantic scenes, the director also hopes to give the film another direction and not just offer the story of a man who wants to create a plane in the context of war.

   According to Buta Connection, at this stage of production, however, there is still one unanswered question: who will dub Jirô? For Hayao Miyazaki, Jirô is an intellectual. “At that time, intelligent people spoke clearly and with a confident voice,” he explains. “Jiro doesn't speak much because he's brilliant. When you're like him, you don't talk unnecessarily. He is therefore economical in words, but it is not because he is introverted. He's a complex person.

   If the characteristics of character Jirô are clear for everybody, the team, however, found no professional doubler that matched his personality. "Maybe we can turn to someone who doesn't come from the dubbing world?" "Suzuki went on, “Like

   Two days later on December 14, 2012, Anno came into the studio for his audition. Miyazaki is immediately convinced by the director's fairly neutral voice. "It's good. That's it. There aren't many people who have that kind of voice. Accept, I beg of you."

   "He gave me a big smile like I hadn't seen in a long time, and he told me he wanted me to do Jiro. I knew I had no more choice!" "At the hearing, Miyazaki said that the role of Jirô was that of a rather reserved man, frugal with words" he added. "But when I looked at the

   , he kept talking, singing and sometimes even in French and German! He laughed at me! I finally agreed, telling myself that even if I couldn't, anyway, it would be the fault of Suzuki and Miyazaki who chose me. Nevertheless, I made all possible efforts!" "If Miya-san asks me, then I can't refuse,” Anno concludes.

   Jirô is someone who created an airplane during a difficult time. Anno also creates feature films in a difficult context. For Miyazaki, it is quite obvious to bring these two personalities together. “It's such a surprising decision for all of us! Do I break the news to everyone or do I keep it a secret?" Miyazaki finally goes from office to office announcing his choice.
   “For the recording sessions, I kept my natural voice. Miya-san was happy with it, and it made me feel that my approach to the character was the right one. Creating animation and films, or creating airplanes may give a different result for the finished product, but I am convinced that these two professions to which we are fully dedicated, Jirô like myself, is to give shape to dreams, to make them come true. I felt very close to Jirô, to what he experiences on a daily basis in that aspect," Anno explains. “To create a film of more than 2 hours is an immense work, physically and mentally. In the last scene, I was really upset."
