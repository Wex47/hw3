This amazes Umi, after Sashiko gets up Umi hurries off to school and gets to class on time.  When she arrives, she learns from Shun that the school board declares that replacing the old clubhouse is a historical necessity, and that 80% of the student body wanted to rebuild. The students hold a debate, some are dismayed and feel this to be the tyranny of the majority, and that worshiping modernity risks losing the past. Umi then suggests a big clean up of the building to restore it to its former glory. Doing so may be enough to convince the school's trustees to half the clubhouse's destruction.

   Gradually Umi and Shun are drawn to each other. During Miki's Good-bye party, Umi explains that her mother, an accomplished professor, had eloped with a sailor. Umi's father would later teach her how to raise the signal flags to help him find his way back home. Then one day, his ship sank during the Korean War by a mine. However, Umi never stopped raising her father's signal flags, even after she moved to the Coliquet Manor. Her grandfather built a new flagpole for her so that she could continue this tradition. Umi then shows a photograph of her father, a man Shun recognizes as
   Yūichirō Sawamura

   Eventually all the students agree to fix and clean the clubhouse and work together for weeks on end.  A sudden obstacle appears: Shun realizes they might be brother and sister. Because of this, Shun starts avoiding Umi in school and refusing to look her in the face. Umi feels very uncomfortable about the avoidance and eventually she confronts with Shun, asking why he is avoiding her, Shun shows her the photography he has, and confirms they are brother and sister. He tells her they should stop having whatever feelings they have and Umi is able to hide her feelings for Shun, much to her disappointment and they continue as friends.  Umi becomes depressed and cannot seem to do things right that evening and the next morning she tries to get back to her routine but is a little saddened still.  Umi eventually gets help from several store owners to pitch in and many of kids believe Umi to be their goddess of good luck.  The school newspaper talks about the progress of the remodeling, making it more popular than ever.

Later that night, Umi tells her mom about Shun and asks her if he really is her brother, because he looks like her father and also was discovered that city hall confirmed he was her family. Her mother clears the air and says that Shun's father, had been killed in an accident on a repatriation ship and his mother died from birth complications. Yūichirō then registered Shun as his son so he could avoid being placed in an orphanage. While Umi's mom did feel terrible for Shun, she couldn't keep him because she was already pregnant with Umi but another family who had recently lost a child themselves took Shun on. Umi is happy and sad to have closure about the situation. Being amazed with building restoration by students, the chairman cancels the demolition of Latin Quartier.

   Following Japan's defeat in the Second World War, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) assumed control over the Japanese merchant marine to return repatriates to their homelands. At the start of the Korean War, those ships, together with their Japanese crews, were pressed into service by the US military to carry forces and supplies to Korea. Japanese vessels played a significant role at the Incheon and Wonsan landings. The shipping firm Tozai Kisen was among the most prominent firms involved, concluding "an agreement with the US military’s Japan Logistical Command (JLC) to provide 122 small vessels and around 1,300 crew for transport and landing work".

   Decades before the film's production announcement, Hayao Miyazaki's niece and nephew visited the Miyazaki family mountain cabin and brought along a

   . Hayao Miyazaki explains the choice to adapt this manga, "The hill of poppies cares about the hearts of people. The girls and boys of the work are pure and upright. They do not forget their dreams and do not disrespect the opposite sex. Whatever their situation when they are born, they live with their strengths and thanks to themselves. This is the kind of film I wanted to make."

   The notable difference between the manga and the film is that the action in the manga takes place in the 1980s; The film takes place in 1963, just before the student revolution. One of the stated wishes of the adaptation would therefore be to play the card of nostalgia and to accurately depict the Japan of the 1960s, that is to say in full economic growth and on the verge of hosting the first Olympic Games in Tokyo. This notable change is undoubtedly more the choice of the father than that of the son, too young to have known this time.

   Production began in July 2010, less than a year until the film's scheduled theatrical release. The collaborative work between Hayao and Gorô is often tense. Thus at the end of July, the father worries about the characterization of the character of

   , which he finds too dark, dull and soulless. During one meeting, the elder Miyazaki asks one of Goro's staff to take down some early character sketches of the main cast. After confronting Goro about it he says, "I won't suggest changing storyboards, so... Those pictures I had taken down were really worrying. What's the use of drawings with no spirit?". When pressed about it by the accompanying NHK documentarian, Hayao adds, "(Goro) hasn't firmed up his vision yet. Drawing lifeless pictures won't do."
  </p>
  <p key="f13a2e4e-ae82-45f7-9a57-5b702787536e">

   so that they persuade Gorô to alter her personality. Worried about his father's growing influence on the film, Goro states, "Even if he tells me what to do. If I just do as he says... Well... That's one way to do it. But I don't want to do it that way."

  <p key="8678e7e2-4c2c-4266-9cc2-71fede3cb500">
   Suzuki is given the early storyboards of the film's opening. His early thoughts were that of worry, "Will this work as a movie? That's what concerns me. Does the heroine seem like a heroine? Does the protagonist seem like one? I look at they key points and wonder if it will work." Finally, the son accepts the various remarks thanks to the regular intervention of the producer Suzuki, a real mediator between the two men. "It was a shock, being told so bluntly. But he's right. And I knew it, too. It's good that he told me now. The truth is, I'm not enjoying this. There've been lots of struggles. I'm fine. I can switch gears quickly," Goro remarks.
  </p>
  <p key="34564e41-7b6d-4f2f-83b4-47e033586b5c">
   In the aftermath, Hayao ponders, "I think... Goro doesn't get it. It's OK for him to stop directing. I think he should. He isn't cut out for it. 'Wanting to' do something doesn't mean 'able to'. Directing isn't an easy job. You must push yourself until your nose starts bleeding. And see what you create. Most people can't do it." Despite these setbacks, Goro would not give up. He holds meetings and decides on taking his father's suggestions to heart. Hayao later says, "I don't mean to interfere. I just want him to tap into my wisdom. If he has changed, I'm happy. It's all good."

   Likewise, Suzuki and Hayao Miyazaki suggests a little later, in August, that elements depicting daily life at Umi's home be added to the film's opening scene. Miyazaki asks, "Why not change, fold, and also neatly place her pajamas?" Suzuki calls a meeting and suggest these elements to Goro. "Please add that scene. Where she wakes up, and folds her futon." to which Goro replies, "She doesn't fold it. Her sister's asleep.". Suzuki then says, "As it is, she just comes downstairs. It needs something more. That scene in the beginning would be effective." Goro silently considers this idea.

   Gorō Miyazaki initially researched Yokohama, intending to be faithful to the city's historical details. The city itself is filled with many slopes, and many gather around shopping districts. the films also recreates places such as Yamashita Park or Hikawa-Maru station. However, after realizing that "simply re-enacting something of the time may seem real enough but may not necessarily be beautiful". Miyazaki decided to show the location as "shimmering and bustling with life" from the viewpoint of the characters.

   The first is the 'Coquelicot Manor' a female boarding house where Umi lives, at the top of the hill overlooking the city and the sea. A traditional Japanese house remodeled after an old hospital, it houses the bedrooms upstairs and the common rooms on the ground floor. Its particularity lies above all in the mast which stands in the middle of the garden, where Umi hoists the maritime pavilions every morning in homage to his father. Several poppy flowers are also in bloom in the garden.

   In designing the Quartier Latin, Miyazaki worked with the art directors who added ideas about the "amalgamation of clutter in the house's many rooms" and attempted to "look at the architecture of the building, but to also remember back to my college years and the clutter and filthiness that [Miyazaki] lived through". Inside its crowded, Western-style interiors housed the Astronomy Department, the Philosophy Study Group, and the Amateur Radio Club.

   One of the main dynamics of the film is the contrast between the Coquelicot Manor and the Quartier Latin, along with the differing nature and role of men and women of that time. Where the female boarders of the Coquelicot Manor are looking to be 'independent', the boys in the Quartier Latin, while enthusiastic about their activities, are completely uninterested in other things (namely, cleaning). These separated communities seem to draw a line with the values ​​and ways of life of men and women.

The key was how they came by the secret and their reaction to it. According to Hayao, "To realize the truth, they move on their own two legs. It's not easy. And in the chaos of war and the post-war period, the two parents know how they met and loved each other. They also knew their fellow sailors and squad comrades would also be able to help. They will pay their greatest respect to the two of them."

   During the impromptu meeting, Hayao confronts the staff and lays out new orders that staff who could come in should so as not to delay production. A senior staff questioned Hayao that giving conflicting orders would confuse some staffers. "Confusing, Tell me! Who said that? What will be confusing? Time off is more confusing! We can't change the release date. We're working hard to meet it. We must go on, even if it's hard! We shouldn't abandon the production site. That's where we make our films.
