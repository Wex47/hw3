   The Laputian robots are much taller than human beings though appear humanoid, with broad, triangular torsos and long, thin arms that reach almost to the ground. The arms can also extend flaps to allow the robots to fly. The robots have dome-shaped heads with uneven eyes; the left eye is about twice the size of the right eye. They can shoot destructive lasers of varying force from their eyes. They appear to be made out of an extremely strong, dark metal, and they have the crest of the royal family of Laputa on their chests.

   with a spell she learned from her grandmother, the robot comes back to life. The robot nearly destroys the base trying to reach Sheeta, whom it is programmed to protect, as she is Laputian royalty. When it gets to Sheeta on the roof of the fortress, the robot does protect her, but it is ultimately destroyed by the airship
   Goliath

   However, when Muska seizes control of Laputa, he activates many of the inert robots, which he uses as weapons to attack the military and destroy the Goliath. After Sheeta and Pazu recite the spell of destruction that tears most of Laputa apart, nearly all the robots fall into the sea and are destroyed. As the children fly away from what remains of Laputa, they see the gardener robot has survived and is still taking care of the island's flora and fauna.
