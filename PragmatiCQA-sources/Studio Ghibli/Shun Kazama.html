   Shun Kazama is a very inspiring boy. Back at the Conqueliot Manor, Umi shows Shun a photography of three young naval men. One of these three man is Umi's father, Yūichirō Sawamura, which was killed in the Korean Wars. Shun is shocked to see the photography because he has one just like it back home. Because of this, Shun starts avoiding Umi in school and refusing to look her in the face. Later, he asks his father, who reveals that Yūichirō arrived at the Kazamas home with young little Shun in his hands shortly after the end of World Wars II. Because the Kazamas family has recently lost their child, they adopted Shun and took very good care of him. Umi feels very uncomfortable about the avoidance and eventually confronts Shun, asking why he is avoiding her. Shun shows her the photography he has, and confirms they are brother and sister. He tells her they should stop having their romantic feelings for each other and Umi is forced to hide her feelings for Shun, much to her disappointment and they continue to see each other as friends.

In 1945, Tachibana was killed in an accident in the repatriation ship and his mother died in his childbirth. However, Ryoko was unable to raise Shun as she was pregnant with Umi during that time. Soon, Shun was given to the Kazamas family.  Despite having some closure, Umi still has concerns about it.

Hiroshi Tachibana is Shun's father and Umi's father was very good friends with him, which is why Umi's father took Shun in. He is told that an old sea captain,
   Yoshio Onodera
