    Anna Sasaki
   </a>
   is an introverted 12-year-old girl living in Sapporo with foster parents, Yoriko and her husband.  She believes that there is an invisible magic circle in the world and feels like she is on the outside away from everyone else. One day at school, she collapses from an asthma attack. Anna's friends bring her backpack to the house and when Yoriko asks if Anna is doing all right they tell her Anna's fine, she's just doesn't talk a lot.  After the girls leave, Yoriko discusses with Anna's doctor about her recently withdrawn attitude as she no longer smiles or talks about her friends at school.  It is probably because of two reasons, her dad has to travel a lot for work so Yoriko is raising her on her own, but the other big reason is because she and Yoriko are not blood related.  The doctor actually recommends sending her to spend the summer with Setsu and Kiyomasa Oiwa, relatives of
   Yoriko
   , in the rural, seaside town of Kissakibetsu, where the air is clear, located between Kushiro and Nemuro.  The town where the Oiwas' live in used to have lots of people visit, but after a highway was built, people stopped passing through.  While driving Anna notices a silo on the hill, according to Kiyomasa it's used to store feed on farms but that silo hasn't been used in ages, in fact it's a place where all the local kids dare each other to go in and says it's a good idea to avoid the place all together.  When they arrive at the house, Anna thinks the house is nice, with their children all grown up, Anna will be sleeping in their daughter's room, who is now working in Tokyo as a Yoga instructor.

   After getting settled, Anna goes for a walk and sees an abandoned mansion across a salt marsh, she goes to investigate it. She looks around, finding it familiar, she goes to get a closer look.  She realizes that no one has lived there in ages as the place is falling apart.  While up at the house she doses off but when she realizes it's sunset, she leaves but gets trapped there by the rising tide until she is found by
   Toichi
   , a taciturn old fisherman, who brings her back to the pier with his rowboat.  During that time, Anna thinks she sees lights in the house turning on, but seconds later, it is only the sunlight.  When she returns to the Oiwa's, Setsu tells her that the mansion used to be a vacation home for some foreigners, but that it has been empty for a long time while Kiyomasa warns her to stay away from the mansion since he believes that the mansion and the silo are haunted. Starting that night, Anna dreams of seeing a blonde girl in the mansion.

   Over the next few weeks she goes to sketch the mansion and every night she sees the girl a little more. One day before she goes out Setsu takes her to meet their neighbor,
   Mrs. Kadoya
   who has wanted to meet Anna and also has a daughter named
   Nobuko
   , who is around her age. The women decide that the girls should go the Tanabata Festival together and Setsu lets Anna borrow her daughter's old yukata but Anna is not pleased by this since she hates festivals. On the night of the Tanabata festival, Anna gets into an argument with Nobuko and runs away to the mansion across the marsh where she meets Marnie, the blonde girl. The two agree to keep their meeting secret and they meet again on the next evening. Anna returns at high tide, she and Marnie are properly introduced.  Marnie helps Anna with rowing and they have some cookies and juice. They play together and get to know each other (slowly, so they won't find out too much). Afterwards Marnie invites Anna to a party at the mansion, which is filled with guests. Marnie disguises Anna to get her into the party.  Marnie stole her Nan's shawl, and when the Nan,
   Georgina Gordon
   tells her it's bedtime, they lure Nan upstairs and lock her in Marnie's room and go back downstairs.  Marnie introduces Anna (as a flower girl) to her parents and the guests, but Anna's shyness gets the better of her and she goes somewhere else in the room.  While there, Anna sees Marnie dancing with a boy named Kazuhiko. Later, some townspeople find Anna asleep by the post office and take her back to the Oiwa's. The next day, Anna returns to the mansion to find her missing shoe, but the mansion appears abandoned and dilapidated again.

   Hisako
   , an older woman who paints pictures of the marsh and the mansion. Hisako comments that Anna's sketches look like a girl whom she knew when she was young, and who used to live in the mansion. She also tells Anna that the mansion is being renovated for new owners. Anna runs to the mansion, where she meets a girl named
   Sayaka
   , who believes that Anna is Marnie until Anna tells her that she isn't. While Sayaka goes to get them drinks, Anna reads the diary discovered by Sayaka that was hidden in a drawer. Marnie's diary was actually moments that Anna was a part of: The night out on the boat and the party she attended. Anna also reads that because of what Marnie did at the party she was grounded and was not able to go out for a while. While reading Anna sees some pages are missing, Sayaka tells Anna she noticed that as well, but hasn't found them.

   The next day, Marnie reappears again and the two girls say how much they missed each other and discuss their home lives. Anna wishes she had her real parents like Marnie, but she wishes she was an orphan with loving foster parents like Anna. Anna admits to finding government documents that show how her foster parents are paid to take care of her. Anna makes the assumption that they only pretend to love her for the money. Marnie then shares with Anna how her parents are always traveling abroad, her mother has to travel for work so she doesn't get to see her too often and due to her Father's work, she only gets to see him twice a year, she also tells how they leave her in the mansion with her nanny and two maids,
   Ursula
   and
   Ella
   De Vil, and how they abuse her physically and psychologically. She manages to sneak out of the mansion when the staff gossips and that is when she feels so free.  When her parents are at home they throw so many incredible parties, that's when Marnie sees her parents, gets a brand new dress and always gets to dance, that is when she feels like the luckiest girl in the world. Marnie tells Anna that the maids are also cruel and often threaten to lock her in the silo near the mansion. Anna leads Marnie to the silo, where she helps her confront her fear. Anna wakes up at the stairway in the rain, only to find Marnie gone, she goes to look for her and while running remembers her sad childhood times.

   When Anna recovers from her fever, Sayaka shows her the missing pages and a painting Hisako gave to Marnie. They converse with Hisako who tells them about Marnie's story (but does tell the girls the story does not have a happy ending): A long time ago Hisako and Marnie played together when they were children and were such good friends.  Marnie loved her parents and all the parties they threw, but deep down she was neglected. Her parents were always traveling for work and the maids and Nan who watched her were very unkind to her. Years later, Marnie married
   Kazuhiko
   , her good friend and they had a daughter named
   Emily
   . Kazuhiko soon became sick and died not too long after. Marnie was then committed to a sanatorium to recover from the psychiatric effect of her husband's death, and Emily was sent to boarding school, since Marnie's parents had also died and she had no one to look after Emily. After Marnie was released and Emily came back from boarding school at the age of 13, Emily blamed Marnie for abandoning her, even though she knew her mother was sick.  The two were not able to make up and Emily ran away and got married, she was expecting with a daughter herself, but she and her husband were killed in a car accident when their daughter was one year old. Marnie raised her granddaughter, and cared for her very much but deep down Marnie still could not get over the shock of losing her daughter and when her granddaughter was two Marnie became very sick and passed away. After Marnie's death, her granddaughter was placed in an orphanage.

   The novel is set in the fictional seaside village of Little Overton in Norfolk, England, modeled after Burnham Overy, a seaside village also in Norfolk. The author, Joan G. Robinson, had a strong connection with Norfolk throughout her life, particularly in 1950s, when she and her family spent the summer in Burnham Overy every year.

   One evening, as Joan walked down a swamp trail, she saw a brick mansion with blue windows and doors from across the swamp. When she took her eyes off and looked back again, the mansion had blended into the landscape as if it had disappeared. A few minutes later, when the setting sun illuminated the mansion, she saw a girl lounging by the window combing her golden hair. Joan jotted down her ideas in several notebooks during the summer and spent about 18 months completing the novel.

   Joan's eldest daughter, Deborah Sheppard, says that the protagonist Anna mirrors Joan's childhood memories. According to her, Joan's mother (Deborah's grandmother) was a tough person who deprived her daughter of affection during her childhood. Also, according to a story heard by Masataka Ikeda, an emeritus professor at Chuo University, in the late 1990s at a guest house in Bunham Overy, Joan visited Bunham Overy with her two daughters every summer, where it was revealed her youngest daughter was adopted and lived in a very similar situation as Anna.

   Yonebayashi admitted he hadn't read the novel yet, but did so after receiving a copy from Suzuki. He found the story moving, but "thought it would be very difficult to visualize as a film," stating the majority of the narrative followed Anna talking about her feelings in a sensitive and fragile way. "A visualization of those words would be very difficult. But at the same time I thought that if I could succeed, it would be a very rare type of film. Anna builds a wall around her, she refuses help from the outside, but at the same time she’s screaming out for it as well, and eventually she realizes she’s loved by the people around her and she’s gradually adapting to the realities of life."

  <p key="00f67542-e67d-4b5e-9ff0-64d3e2d22483">
   His interest was later renewed, however, and he began to conceive of new elements for the story, such as Anna's characterization as an artist. “It was an interesting read, but I felt it would be difficult to make an animated film out of it,” Yonebayashi explained.
  </p>
  <p key="8406312c-c9a8-4132-9677-40abe0881aab">
   After this first reading, he initially refused the project. But he still tried to draw some illustrations. “I thought it might be a good idea to bring something more. Anna draws herself. Through his drawings or his way of writing, I could perhaps also describe the feelings of the character." It also has the idea of adding scenes not present in the original text, as Anna and Marnie dancing under the moon or night scene picnic. “I drew all of this, and going through these steps, I finally said to myself: I want to continue, and maybe I can finally make this movie."

   On December 12, 2013, the production for the film was announced. On accepting the director position, Yonebayashi said that he had no intention of changing the world, as Miyazaki could with his adaptations. After two adult-oriented Ghibli films back-to-back, namely

   , he wanted to return to a Ghibli movie aimed at a younger audience. For this new start, Suzuki has added
   Yoshiaki Nishimura
   to production, and a very young team of collaborators and newcomers to carry out this project.
  </p>
  <p key="839e1345-5d81-446d-9bd0-d1b8b4d33a75">
   "I started reading this book about 10 years prior to production and I wasn’t moved at all. But in Japan there were two volumes, and I never got through the first one, no matter how many times I tried. But after this production was decided, I read everything and it all made sense. I thought Anna meeting Marnie, who understands her, would be enough. But actually it wasn’t, it’s not just about love, it’s about identity." said Nishimura.
  </p>
  <p key="71414233-c7fd-4520-9141-d7986a9ef9ee">
   For producer Nishimura, Yonebayashi is a calm person who likes to take his time. However, the producer remembered Yonebayashi's statements very clearly: he wouldn't let anyone say that Studio Ghibli was unable to make a good movie without
   Takahata
   and Miyazaki.
  </p>
  <p key="57723e42-fe8b-48ed-83ea-ab649ed09e24">
   Nishimura further explained that he took the job for two reasons - the first was after hearing Takahata during an internal screening of
   <i key="a2977375-4a87-4439-99c2-a4651b532fdd">
    Arriety
   </i>
   , “If a young producer had put all his soul into it, maybe the film would have been better."
  </p>
  <p key="a6e69774-9e4e-406d-8887-17c6e504642b">
   The second reason has its origin when he was still working on the storyboard of
   <i key="2550cac1-7775-44ed-9dec-364557afc209">
    Princess Kaguya
   </i>
   with Takahata. Yonebayashi then confessed to him that when he worked on his storyboards, sometimes, he could not judge if they were good or not. He was a little envious of Isao Takahata, assisted by a person to give him his opinion. Nishimura therefore agreed and immediately began working on the storyboard of Marnie with Yonebayashi. So he worked on Takahata's film while starting to work on Marnie. Late at night, he joined Maro at the apartment in which the director had isolated himself to work.

   Hiromasa Yonebayashi worked 18 months on the screenplay and storyboards before starting production of the film. In the end, Toshio Suzuki said that Hayao Miyazaki himself would have been unable to create something so sensitive. “When Yonebayashi was working on Arrietty, the whole team gathered around him to support him because he was a beginner and no one knew if he was able to complete the project” explained Nishimura. “But this time around, he makes his decisions quickly and his work is very convincing."

  <p key="89e91eec-6e37-4659-b7ab-cecde3241762">
   Toshio Suzuki observed a general supervisory position, providing advice such as changing the setting of the story to Japan. However, it was merely perfunctory as he wanted to see how the new team would operate. "It was I who launched this project," he explained. “I chose the main collaborators and organized the schedule and I will participate in the promotion of the film. But I will no longer be present at production meetings with the film crew. It was I who set up the main players on this project, but now it's up to them to manage its production. I will certainly want to give my opinion, but I will abstain."

  <p key="9230cdae-fc50-4c77-9e96-b49a69dfed1b">
   Andô took care of the animation, but he also participated in the screenplay with Keiko Niwa and Yonebayashi. Different questions were indeed posed to him when he apprehended the original text. Reading the novel, Andô did not really grasp the charm of the story. All the characters around the heroine, Anna, were all too sweet, and the events didn't feel logically structured to her. Andô then shared these questions with director Hiromasa Yonebayashi, who then offered to revise the script together. When Andô proposed an idea to Yonebayashi, the latter listened and thought, then made him a new proposal. They thus advanced the scenario through constructive discussions.

   . Even though it had been a long time since he worked at Studio Ghibli, Andô explained: “What was interesting about this production is that instead of asking me if Miyazaki will like it this time - here, I gave my opinion and expressed my ideas. I think there are pros and cons to being able to give your opinion. How the studio's younger collaborators react to this new freedom will be important for the future of the studio."

  <p key="d7d9a939-98dc-4332-8add-ca2fe1a268f0">
   Although the setting was changed, the decision was made to retain Marnie's appearance as blonde and blue-eyed, though Miyazaki was opposed to this decision. He later criticized the usage of Marnie's character to promote the film, opining that it was "plain outdated and cheesy." "Yes I know it’s unusual but we chose it because of that very reason. But actually it’s because in the original novel there is an illustration of Marnie with blonde hair and blue eyes. It’s difficult to depict blonde hair in animation, but I took on the challenge, and we changed the setting to Japan so Marnie became a sort of mysterious existence in that setting. To put the Western world and Japan together, we managed to create an original world." said Yonebayashi.
  </p>
  <p key="72215792-b5cd-49fb-91dd-ee01a38b67be">
   The main difficulty comes from the main character,

  </p>
  <p key="0339a667-9a98-4c53-971f-865ac138eef7">
   Yonebayashi intended the film to be encouraging to children in Japan who felt lonely and isolated, and hoped that "when they see Marnie, maybe they could take a little step forward". Key focus was placed upon highly detailed character movements and backgrounds, as well as depicting the details of Anna's experience in the environment. The Marsh House that is central to the story was designed by

    Yohei Taneda
   </span>
   , who Yonebayashi asked "to draw the Marsh House as if it were another character who watches over Anna." Taneda scouted buildings in Hokkaido for inspiration. During an interview, Yonebayashi explained, "Our production designer, Yohei Taneda, has lots of experience in live action films, so I asked him how to achieve that effect. We went to Hokkaido and took a lot of references of landscape, scenery and architecture."
  </p>
  <p key="7be467fe-0604-44c1-a7dd-4e1fe048b777">
   "To depict the marsh landscape's mysterious side, we played a lot" adds Yonebayashi. “As a rule, in Ghibli films, we find a very clear, blue sky with white clouds. This is what I used until now. But this time it's a little different."
  </p>
  <p key="0bd75d53-9716-4de5-abcb-8bd5c272c9f1">
   Normally for Ghibli films, the storyboards were completed before background sets were completed. For this production, the sets were designed first before the storyboards were completed. By constructing a miniature of the Marsh House, Yonebayashi was thus able to visualize the placement of characters in the sets, as well as to plan his camera frames during his work on the storyboard, directly after the scenario. This working method strongly influenced the film.

   had announced his retirement and that the production side of Studio Ghibli was to be shut down. Yonebayashi explained to Cartoon Brew what he learned from his experience at Ghibli, "There are so many things that I have learned at Studio Ghibli. The most important has been my involvement as an animator in director Miyazaki’s films, when I was able to learn how to draw many types of animation — even as I was often scolded by him. This has been the inheritance of a lifetime for me."

I even declared to the manager, "I will definitely accept it" (laughs). Even though my feelings increased that much, when I finished the audition, I lost confidence ... Moreover, I had time to make a decision, so I gave up once saying that I had fallen. So the moment I heard that it was accepted, I felt like a dream."

When I first received it, it was at the time of my debut, and I didn't have much experience in acting, so I just felt nervous. So I had a special feeling this time. But when I went to the audition, it was the first day and I was a top batter! I was really nervous, but I feel like I've taken the plunge and put out all of me. At the audition, I played both Anna and Marnie."
  </p>
  <p key="5b84604e-da93-411a-af1e-35357d38ba07">
   Regarding the challenges for the role, Takatsuki said, "As the story progresses, Anna grows up, so I was conscious of changing her voice along the flow. At first, I close my heart, so I try to keep my emotions inward as much as possible, and even if I cry, I feel like I'm crying. In the second half, it created a bright atmosphere. It was also an instruction from director Yonebayashi (Hiromasa), and it was also a part that I consciously played."
  </p>
  <p key="193c3aa5-348d-4e4d-9255-bbe594a22d24">
   On the other hand, Arimura said, "To be honest, Marnie, who I played, was a difficult role. The tension changes a lot, and there are some lines that are outrageous. But that is Marnie's personality. It's packed with mysterious elements, so it doesn't change your emotions momentarily, even with a little mischief and a little devilish part. I tried not to think too deeply."

  <p key="57599128-2f9a-4b74-91e7-f9bf2c7dd13d">
   Takatsuki elaborated on the challenges of anime dubbing versus live action acting, "In the case of anime, I learned that it also expresses reactions that are not used in real life. This

   A day or so later, Suzuki holds a final meeting to decide on the film's final poster visual, “I've been working for Studio Ghibli for a long time and I have my own opinion when it comes to advertising,” he explains. “I never take any risks, I never go on an adventure and I always choose a safe bet. I take a risk when I have no other choice. For Marnie, it was kind of the case, because the basics of this film were a bit particular, in a good way and a bad way. In any case, different from Miyazaki and Takahata films. It's a "young" film, always in a good and bad way. It was necessary to highlight the “fresh” side of the young succession of the studio after the announcement of Miyazaki's retirement. We have lost this reassuring aspect of Studio Ghibli but we have gained in freshness. And that's the important point of this film."

   . According to Director Yonebayashi, "I wasn’t particular conscious of this, but probably there is an element of suspense. It begins with the meeting of Marnie and Anna, but gradually we wonder who Marnie actually is. Referencing other movies is actually quite rare for Studio Ghibli – we haven’t done it before. I think there is a psychological link to Hitchcock, and that’s why you might have felt that similarity. But it wasn’t intentional."
