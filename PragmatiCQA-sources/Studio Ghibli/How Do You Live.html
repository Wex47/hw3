   ” (2016), Miyazaki returned to the producer with a new idea for a feature.
   When a reporter asked about Hayao Miyazaki's next movie, Suzuki smiled and prefaced, "It didn't take a year to say that (Miyazaki) wanted to return to active duty (after announcing his retirement). I will never forget, July 1st (2016). (Miyazaki) brought a proposal to me. A feature film proposal. He said, "I'll draft the e-conte (storyboard) for the first 20 minutes, so Mr. Suzuki, please judge whether this is interesting.” At the end of last year, I read it. I was really worried.

   In October 2017, during a commemorative event at Waseda University for the author Natsume Sōseki, Hayao Miyazaki revealed to the thousand attendees that his the new film will be an adaptation of the novel, "How Do You Live?".
   The film is expected to take three to four years to complete. Suzuki revealed that Miyazaki is working with his grandson in mind after he (Hayao Miyazaki) passes on.

  <p key="dcf5e601-eb02-46ff-85da-c4d897fa63e5">
   In December 2019, Suzuki, in an NHK interview with actor Takeru Satoh, said, "The film is 15% finished at the end of October 2019 after 3.5 years of production. There was a schedule for directing 5 minutes per month but that was not followed in favor of 1 minute per month. There were plans to finish in 2019, but that schedule was not followed anymore. At this rate, the film would be completed by 2037 at the earliest."

   On May 14, 2020, as the world was affected by the Coronavirus, the film's production stayed largely immune to its effects. Suzuki explains in an interview, "We still draw everything by hand. It takes more time to complete a single film because we have to draw more frames and more pictures. At the time of production of "My Neighbor Totoro" (1988), there were only eight animators, and it took eight months to finish with that number of people. The work of director Miyazaki currently working on is sixty."
  </p>
  <p key="1320a855-ab6c-4b5c-8579-bb0a9658dd4e">
   "A human animator is involved, but I can only make 1 minute in a month, which means that I can only make 12 minutes a year. Actually, I have already spent three years making this work, so now however, it means that it is completed only in 36 minutes. I hope to complete it in three years."

  <p key="eca61660-62a5-406e-b95d-9c29bace2651">
   On March 25, 2021, Sight and Sound conducted an interview with Suzuki where he revealed that half of the film's animation had been completed. "Around half the film’s 125 minutes are now animated", and he doesn't expect a release for another three years. He described the film as a “big, fantastical” work. When Miyazaki told Suzuki he wanted to come out of retirement, the producer insisted that he justify his comeback by trying something new. The result is that, exceptionally, the director is working at his own pace, exempt from the usual constraints of deadlines and budgets.

Following each chapter, the uncle who told the story of the day talked about themes such as "view of things", "structure of society", "relation", etc. Koperu is shown his journal under the heading "How to see things", "Think of your Earth as one of the celestial bodies in the vast universe, like Copernicus, or think that your Earth is sitting in the center of the universe. In fact, these two ideas are not just about astronomy. When I think about the world and life, I have to follow along."

   Like the original, it is tailored as a book that lets readers think about profound themes such as "how to see things", "experiences of truth", and "human troubles, mistakes, and greatness". Hisashi Maeda, the Editor-in-Charge of the Weekly Bunshun commented regarding the relevance of the adaptation, "I knew that the original novel was a favorite among young people and was loved by the older generation as well, including journalist Akira Ikegami and Hayao Miyazaki. The reason I took this project is because it was beloved by young editors in their generations. I thought that if a good book that had been read for generations was made into a manga, it would reach a wider audience. The original theme is Koperu's growth, but in the manga, we added an element that would allow the uncle to grow together while guiding Koperu."
