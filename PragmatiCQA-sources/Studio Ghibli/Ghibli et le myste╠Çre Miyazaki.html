   Toei Studio
   , along with their role forming labor unions and participating in student protests occurring across the country in the 1960s. It was here that Takahata and Miyazaki met Ōtsuka, who was ten years their senior at the time. "We shared many similar views. For example, we loved Russia, but we didn't like communism." Ōtsuka recalls. "While they couldn't be involved politically, Miyazaki and Takahata strove to create animation for children with a political agenda. It stunned me. It made me realize the potential of animation films." Suzuki explains. Their early work,

   Following that, an interview with Animation Psychologist Masao Yokota explains that the "gods" and "monsters" that inhabit Miyazaki's films are a reflection of Miyazaki's ego. "He transmogrifies himself into different monsters to express himself. The monster fancies a girl's attention and they form a rapport. His storylines develop from there." These themes present themselves in

Junichi Hidaka, a resident of the island, explains that the cedar trees are considered divine and sacred. Even the mountain streams were considered sacred. "The film (

"Some pictures were unlike anything we've done before."

   The documentary met a mixed reception from critics. The Sydney Morning Herald expressed disappointment that this was a Miyazaki documentary only by proxy. "We see snippets from his films and talk to studio producers, animators, composers and even his son, who runs the remarkable Miyazaki museum. They all talk about Miyazaki, discuss his influences and motivations, his creativity and goals. Even a highly regarded fellow filmmaker from the Ghibli studio seems to talk more about Miyazaki than his own work."

   "It is hard not to feel increasingly let down as the program continues: you're missing the one, essential voice. So when Miyazaki and a French comic artist are interviewed at the end - captured together at a joint exhibition in Paris - your initial feeling is one of relief. Ultimately, however, it's unsatisfying to have this block of chatter shoved in at the tail of the program almost like an afterthought."
   Several other reviews cited the lack of Miyazaki's presence as well, with one stating, "All interviews are illuminating, but Miyazaki is teasingly confined to pic’s tete-a-tete finale with esteemed French comic artist Jean “Moebius” Giraud."
