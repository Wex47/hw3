   <i key="52e91768-0fe2-498e-8c3e-211e5cf5058a">
    Anne of Green Gables
   </i>
   by Lucy Maud Montgomery. While several Japanese translated versions existed at the time, (notably
   who released her best-selling translation in 1952) the production team decided to use the Taeko Kamiyama's translated edition, published by Obunsha Bunko and Shingakusha Bunko in 1973. It was chosen because it was considered the most faithful translation of the original at the time of production. The Obunsha paperback edition is currently out of print, making it difficult to obtain (the digital book version of Gutenberg 21 is available, however). The Shingakusha paperback edition is not available at general bookstores as it was made for junior high school students.

  <p key="8881860d-d78f-4d47-8916-f57a746884a8">
   Since its release, the critically-acclaimed series has been praised for how it faithfully adapts the original novel. Details can be found in the opening of the first episode which lifts passages from the original, or how a quote from Lewis Carroll's

   , which was a favorite of the author Montgomery, is worked into certain scenes.
   Isao Takahata
   states that the reason for making such a faithful adaptation is to take advantage of the "goodness of the original", such as fun conversational structure in scenes between Anne and Marilla Cuthbert.

   On the other hand, the series deviates from its source material somewhat starting from the 25th episode. Additionally, the anime had cut out plot points from the original novel, such as the ghost she encounters in

   , a level of quality is expected by fans and critics, however, the series suffered from uneven animation. Some have noted badly animated scenes involving Marilla, and the color of Mashu's hair and beard changes from time to time. This was apparently due to production lapses during the holiday season. Studio Robin, who was in charge of coloring, was on holiday break during the production and this affected the quality of certain episodes.

   Anne is an orphan full of imagination. When she arrives at her new home she will understand that, sometimes, you have to be a sensible person too, but her unique character will change, or at least attract the people around her. The story covers Anne's growth from about eleven to seventeen years old, while she makes friends, goes to school and studies to fulfill her dream. At a difficult point in her life, Anne will have to take a hard choice, but at the end she will be able to find a new dream.

   series. Nobody has ever wanted her in her long and lonely 11-year-old life... until this dream comes true and she is going to have a wonderful home in Green Gables on Prince Edward Island with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. But all turns too good to be true - it was just a mistake; the Cuthberts have "ordered a boy" from the orphanage and have no need for a girl. And yet, soon Marilla and Matthew discover that they cannot live without this lively imaginative chatterbox. Green Gables becomes her home; Diana - the best "bosom friend" any girl ever dreamed of; Gilbert - the hated but never-despairing boy in love. Friends, dreams and school, scrapes and funny accidents, laughter and tears, tragedies and achievements - fill Anne's life as she goes on her road of growing up.

   In writing the novel, Montgomery was inspired by notes she had made as a young girl about two siblings who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy they had requested, yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island, Canada. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York's Metropolitan Magazine and put on the wall of her bedroom, as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her "youthful idealism and spirituality."
  </p>
  <p key="855f78b0-2229-48b7-a931-8cf80500b696">
   Montgomery was inspired by the "formula Ann" orphan stories (called such because they followed such a predictable formula) which were popular at the time and distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra "e". She based other characters, such as Gilbert Blythe, in part on people she knew. She said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day, while sitting at her window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish.

Miyazaki had not intended to do other work with Takahata, but he had also not planned on becoming independent at this stage of his career.

   The opening (OP) and ending (ED) themes were written by contemporary music composer Akira Miyoshi. Shigeto Mori, who is usually known for avant-garde works, also co-wrote ballads suitable for Anne. The soundtrack's sophistication set it apart from other music in anime at the time. The difference between OP and ED is the interlude of a single instrument is included and the song.

   The composition showcases a colorful harmony and instrumentation reminiscent of modern French music, accents with temple blocks found in contemporary music. The piano and harp, as well as the use of the celesta, saxophone, grofe (temple block), deborzerk (G, F #, E, which are repeatedly struck in the interlude of the orchestra, are from the third movement from the New World), McDowell (insertion of the triplet at the end of the song) and other material quotes from composers associated with North America help create a rich atmosphere. According to singer Ritsuko Owada, the entire score for the series was about the size of a newspaper. Additionally, Owada was in charge of composing and arranging two insert songs and one insert song. Another thing of note was how the OP is the first time a saxophone was used for a
