   The reason why it was serialized on an anime magazine was that the editorial department of Animage wanted to "publish the work of a major non-anime writer." Sanae Mitsugi, the editor of Tokuma Shoten, commissioned writer Saeko Himuro to write a book and with visuals provided by

   . At that time, Himuro was a popular writer of Chiyoda-based publisher Shueisha and a leading figure in the paperback label Cobalt Bunko for girls. Himuro was skeptical of taking the job, but Mitsugi convinced him by saying that Ghibli would be involved. In July 1989, Himuro was invited to the premiere of

  <p key="c2b3ad73-e57c-49dd-965c-1e36b9f45c7b">
   At Kichijōji Station, Tokyo, Taku Morisaki glimpses a familiar woman on the platform opposite. Later, as his flight to Kōchi Prefecture takes off, he narrates the events that brought her into his life. The story is told in flashback.
  </p>
  <p key="2ec8aa84-a37c-4653-bf59-e0b3a87c4337">
   In Kōchi, two years prior, Taku receives a call from his friend, Yutaka Matsuno, asking to meet at their high school. He finds Yutaka at a window, watching an attractive female transfer student whom Yutaka was asked to show around. The boys discuss their upcoming school trip to Hawaii. At the school gates, Taku is introduced to the new girl, Rikako Muto. She thanks Yutaka for providing directions to a bookstore. Taku teases Yutaka about his infatuation.
  </p>
  <p key="a9a32a6d-25d9-47a8-bc6f-3d82fab1f3e5">
   Rikako is academically gifted and good at sports, but also arrogant. Taku believes she is unhappy about leaving Tokyo. His mother learns from gossip that a divorce brought Rikako's mother to Kōchi. In a phone conversation with Yutaka, he discovers that Rikako is living away from the family house.
  </p>
  <p key="cb8185b0-6d36-433a-8ae6-d19b8e2bd041">
   The school year ends, heralding the Hawaii trip. Taku, suffering from an upset stomach, is stopped in the hotel lobby by Rikako. She explains that she has lost her money and asks to borrow some. As Taku has a part-time job, he lends her ¥60,000. Promising to repay him, she warns not to tell anyone. As she departs, Taku sees a stern Yutaka and feels compelled to explain. Later, Rikako admonishes him for telling Yutaka about the money, saying that he also loaned her ¥20,000.
  </p>
  <p key="6313551e-d0c9-4578-97d3-e4e37b20fd79">
   Back in Kōchi, the third year begins with Rikako making a friend, Yumi Kohama. Rikako hasn't returned Taku's money and he wonders if she has forgotten. Out of the blue, a distressed Yumi calls Taku, explaining that Rikako had tricked her into coming to the airport on the pretence of a concert trip, only to discover that their real destination is Tokyo, tickets paid for with Taku's money. He races to the airport, sending Yumi home, saying that he will accompany Rikako.
  </p>
  <p key="bf1bbf73-b722-4b09-a6ec-f4e3f8a1a762">
   Upon arrival, it appears that Rikako has not forewarned her father, interrupting his planned trip with a girlfriend. Her father thanks Taku, repays the loan and arranges a room at the Hyatt Regency hotel. Later, Rikako explains that when her parents were fighting, she'd always sided with her father, but had now discovered he wasn't on her side. Comforting her, Taku offers his bed and attempts to sleep in the bathtub. The next morning, Rikako seems back to her normal self and kicks Taku out so that she can change clothes to meet a friend for lunch. Taku wanders around the city. After catching up on sleep at the hotel, Taku receives a call from Rikako asking to be rescued from former boyfriend, Okada, who is not as she remembered him.
  </p>
  <p key="8421f5b3-fb74-42df-ae06-50efb608f3ca">
   Returning home, Rikako ignores Taku, but doesn't hide from others that they spent a night together. Taku discovers this from Yutaka, who had earlier confronted Rikako to confess his feelings toward her, but had been rebuffed. Taku confronts Rikako in class for hurting his best friend, calling her "The worst!". She responds by slapping him and he slaps her in return.
  </p>
  <p key="9a37be79-ba4d-4d65-a550-ceea12af80f3">
   The autumn school cultural festival arrives and Rikako, who has been avoiding Yosakoi dance rehearsals, becomes more distant from the other girls, many of whom openly dislike her. Confronting her behind the school, Rikako stands firm as one girl, believing that Rikako was flirting with her boyfriend, attempts to strike her but is held back. Taku, who has seen all, approaches Rikako and comments that he is impressed with the way she handled herself. She slaps him. Yutaka confronts a somewhat stunned Taku, who tries to explain. Yutaka punches him to the ground and walks away. They do not talk for the rest of the year.
  </p>
  <p key="3192834c-bfa9-486b-b1d9-de594b22b601">
   In the present, Taku's plane lands and he is offered a lift home by Yutaka, who explains he punched him because he'd realized Taku had held back his feelings for his sake. At a class reunion, former student president Shimizu mentions she had met Rikako earlier. She explains that as Rikako was attending Kōchi University, she had flown to Tokyo for her school break, missing the reunion. Taku realizes that Rikako was the woman he'd seen at the station. Walking home, Yumi tells Taku that she too had met Rikako, explaining she couldn't make it to the reunion and that she wanted to meet someone, but wouldn't say who... just that he slept in bathtubs.
  </p>
  <p key="fe9f6cc2-c726-477d-ad0d-2142cde421c6">
   In Tokyo, Taku again sees Rikako across the platforms, but this time runs to find her. As the train pulls away, he finds Rikako and realizes that he had always been in love with her.

   was controlled by Studio Ghibli, but much of the animation was produced with the assistance of J.C. Staff, Madhouse Studios, and Oh! Production, who had worked with Ghibli on past projects. This film is the first Ghibli anime meant for television and directed by someone other than Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Additionally, this is the first work produced at Studio Ghibli's new office building at Higashi-Koganei.

   The motto for the production of the TV movie was “fast, cheap and of high quality”. For his role as director, Mochizuki paid particular attention to the realism of the characters. The character description was the most important point for him, his favorite character being Rikako. Meanwhile, background artist

   The director wondered if the film would have been better off done in live-action rather than animation. For example, in a scene where there are just two characters played by actors chatting, the viewer can easily follow their state of mind on their faces. Transcribing this state of mind in animation requires a lot of work and precision on the part of the animators and is more difficult.
  </p>
  <p key="67e7c4d5-6d4b-4253-9e5b-af7333ce178d">
   But the advantage of animation over actual shooting is that the audience can identify with the characters and their feelings more easily, with the simplification of facial features, more anonymous, helping. Animation is all the more an advantage when dealing with such a delicate subject of love, which can easily plunge the viewer into embarrassment with real actors.

   In the end, the production schedule and budget went far beyond what was had been initially planned. Production began on September 24, 1992, but while Studio Ghibli wanted all the drawings to be completed by the end of 1992, they were finally completed in February 1993 and the TV movie, meanwhile, would not be ready until March 18. 1993. Numerous changes had to be made from its original source novel, as several chapters were left out by the director. They had to decide how much time would be spent with the characters while they were high school versus at the university.
  </p>
  <p key="f800e612-3bc9-4db2-bc93-d7f6a231eda4">
   As a result of several discussions with Animation director Kondo, production producer Nozomu Takahashi, and scriptwriter Kaori Nakamura, the story was mainly focused in high school. This resulted in the narrative cutting back and forth between the past and the present. The character's acting and emotional expression were also intentionally subdued compared to other Ghibli works. To ease the burden for the animation team, Kondo drew a second storyboard with more a detailed layout as reference. In addition, photos taken during location scouting were enlarged and copied to be used as background images for several shots to simplify the background work.

   Casting for majority of the cast was decided via tape auditions sent by veteran voice actors.

   failed to become the successor to the titans who founded the studio." Although the author did not that even Takahata struggled living up to the Ghibli name. "In the end I would argue that Ghibli’s brand asphyxiated even Takahata, whose works were heavily penalized in the box office by his desire to stray away from their established identity, so I wouldn’t blame anyone for failing to sit on a throne that had become Hayao Miyazaki’s alone."
  </p>
  <p key="2b507294-b440-47b3-bd1f-5ebd2f36be8f">
   "This isn’t to say Mochizuki’s work was without fault, of course. The movie is admittedly clumsy, starting from the patchwork narrative framing device that struggled to cover both past and present even after a sizable length increase. The management of the project in general didn’t fare much better; what was intended as a cheaper, quick TV project ended up costing well beyond expectations, and for all their intent to give Ghibli’s own youth the main role, they had to rely on other studios to save the production from doom. The stress piled up to the point that Mochizuki himself passed out, while he tried juggle his responsibilities with other productions he’d accepted beforehand. But the fact that he enjoys reminiscing about the project, including detailed retellings of the incident that sent him to the hospital, proves it was in its own way a worthwhile experience."
