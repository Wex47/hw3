By Suzuki's own admission, there was no particular reason for this appointment, “When Miya-san and I made the decision to do Arrietty, the Little Borrower's World , we were discussing directions for the story and suddenly Miya-san asked me who should be doing it. be the director. Now that I know him better, I know he's still waiting for concrete answers, so an idea popped into my mind and on a whim I said, “Maro”, Yonebayashi's nickname at the studio. Hearing my response, Miya-san seemed to be a little surprised and scowled and I knew why: for his own upcoming film project, he was planning to use her as the lead host as well. If Maro were to become a director, Miya-san would have to do without him.
  </p>
  <p key="316a4a78-1fb3-4cd0-baf5-65550d1e3f08">
   We asked Maro to join us and told him about it. Of course, he was very surprised. At the time, my idea was just thoughtless, but now I can explain the reason behind it. Hiromasa Yonebayashi is an extremely skilled and talented animator. Plus, since he started working on the production, I also came to know that he had enough talent as a director. Besides, he is a good person and is loved by everyone at the studio. When I informed everyone about his appointment as the head of the project, the studio was initially surprised. However, everyone now agrees on this choice. While there are plenty of veteran and older animators at the studio, they don't hesitate to help him out."

   confessed that Miyazaki wrote the screenplay without even re-reading the novel and he relied only on his memories. According to him, the director has a 'good memory' but he nevertheless often makes reading mistakes and reinterprets things or gives importance to negligible details. For example, if there is a lovely garden in the book, as there is in "The Borrowers", he will instantly love it. “He really loves gardens,” he explains. “And those who are abandoned have even more his favors. So much so that he first made a plan of the garden before embarking on Arrietty's screenplay. Eastern and Western elements were combined when designing the mansion and gardens, with Seibi-en from Aomori Prefecture Hirakawa used as inspiration.

   based on the scenario of Miyazaki. One of his very first difficulties as a director was the development of this document, which then guides the entire production of the film. “It's the first time I've drawn a storyboard,” he explains. “Even though I felt a bit lost, I started to draw, telling myself that I could always ask to be in control of my work. When I wanted to show it to Mr. Miyazaki, he replied that he did not want to. It scared me because if he had agreed to control it then, the film would have been even better."

   During the final interview between Miyazaki, Suzuki and the young director, preceding the start of production of the animation, Yonebayashi ultimately does not bring his work to the master because "it would have finally taken twice as long and, at the end of the day. in the end, that would only have impacted the production itself. In the end, it was a good thing to have had complete freedom." Miyazaki does not upset and instead congratulated him for his firmness. According to Buta Connection, in total, Yonebayashi will have spent five months alone drawing 996 plans on his own.

   “At Ghibli, we have two ways of making films,” Suzuki explains. “The first is that a director directs everything, the other is that the project takes precedence. In this case, it is a producer who is directing and the

  <p key="6e021793-0992-47ce-903a-1b10127b5002">
   Very early on, at Studio Ghibli, everyone felt that the deadlines would be tight. From the press conference in December 2009, the question of production deadlines was already put to Suzuki: "To be frank, I don't prefer that this question be asked" , he explains then. “No doubt the film will move slowly and Maro will have to be fast. When the new year arrives, we will already be running out of time." The pressure and doubt about the capabilities of the young director was such that producers saw fit to add: “Now I know you are wondering why Mr. Yonebayashi is not attending this press conference. Well, that's because Mr. Miyazaki advised him not to appear in public. According to him, there are two basic directions for making a film: either to be produced successfully or to end up being put on hold. Sometimes even it can also be purely canceled halfway. Let’s not forget that he’s just a beginner as a director. If the production is unsuccessful, he risks being publicly humiliated. It is best for him not to speak about it in public just yet."

Despite Kagawa's best efforts, there are a lot of things that she unfortunately has to give up, including the drawing corrections made by the animation director. Many animators get sick or hurt themselves (according to Megumi Kagawa, one of the main reasons is the aging of the animators in the studio). However, when it comes to the quality of the animation, Yonebayashi can luckily count on his second animation director.

   Cristoph Mark of The Daily Yomiuri praised the film, saying that the film is "likely a perennial favorite among children." He particularly liked the film effects, which he described as "Drops of water loom large and drip like syrup; the ticking of a clock reverberates through the floor and the theater's speakers; tissue paper is large and stiff...", adding that these effects gives the audience "a glimpse into their own world, but from a different perspective". Mark Schilling of The Japan Times gave the film a rating of four out of five stars, and said that the film "speaks straight to the heart and imagination of [everyone]." Schilling also praised the film's animation, saying that [Studio Ghibli animators] are past masters at creating the illusion of presence and depth without [3-D effects]. However, he also said that some scenes in the film "threatens to devolve into the sappy, the preachy and the slapsticky" but noted that these scenes were "mercifully brief".

   Steve Rose, the reviewer for The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars and praised the film, describing it as "a gentle and entrancing tale, deeper and richer than more instantly gratifying fare.". Rose also described the film as "the slow food of the animation world.". However, he did note that this film "doesn't match previous hits such as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke in terms of epic scale or adult appeal", even though it bears many of their hallmarks: bright, detailed animation..." . Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review of the film. She said that the film "remains essentially a film for children". Young later went on to say that the relationship with Sho and Arrietty "touches the heartstrings with gentle yearning", and praised Yonebayashi for its direction. In the opening remarks made by David Gritten of The Telegraph, he said that the film was "ravishingly colourful and textured". He also praised the animation, saying that "animation doesn't get better than Arrietty." Gritten gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5 stars.

   Corbel became known to Ghibli filmmakers when she sent them a fan letter showing her appreciation of their films, together with a copy of her own album. After hearing the album of her music she had sent them, they thought they should collaborate with her for the music of this film. The song made its public debut in a presentation of the song by singer Corbel and percussionist Marco in Apple's store in Shibuya, Tokyo, on 8 August 2010.
