   A long time before the war began, a chef in a French town was cooking food, when an accident happened. A wandering snail accidentally fell into a pot of garlic butter. The chef then tried eating the snail cooked in garlic butter and found that it tasted good. Seeing this opportunity, he began to intentionally cook snails in garlic butter, and it became popular around the place as a lot of people came to eat it, so much that it nearly drove snails into extinction.
  </p>
  <p key="296934ac-1d6f-47ff-ba04-af7a6d3584ab">
   However, because most people did not like the snails in garlic butter, a number of them were thrown away, letting the snails escape underground, led by their leader,
   The Great Jingle Jangle

   The Great Jingle Jangle prophesied that there shall come to a time when an aye-aye lemur shall come to rescue them from the underground, marking the start to the War of the Beasts, and the snails shall engage in the battle overground.

   In ancient aye-aye beliefs, it was said that every millennium a beautiful aye-aye child will be born, called the chosen one.

   After King Koto rose as the king, he put total focus on the kingdom's military and spend all the kingdom's resources on their army. Upon realising that they needed a war to actually have what they spend on to be worth it, they decided to conquer small kingdoms and areas within the Island of Madagascar.

   Before they began, King Koto ventured around the island, looking for vulnerable places and scouting the area before they attack. He encountered King Julien XIII who helped him fight a snake before King Julien took Koto to his kingdom for shelter. King Koto then learned a lot about the kingdom and established ties with the kingdom as he told King Julien that he was the last of his kind. Sage warned King Julien of his younger brother, however, King Julien trusted King Koto over Sage and didn't believe his words.

   King Julien then had the kingdom build a wall around the kingdom to protect the place and people, designed to be strong enough against the mountain lemurs. Seeing this, King Koto took advantage of his close ties with King Julien to trick him into opening the gate of the walls for his army. When King Julien brought King Koto inside the kingdom walls, thinking that he might be running away from the Mountain Lemur army, King Koto took the chance to break the gate's locks and called in for his army as they occupied the kingdom.

   Upon rescuing Lord Shark with the help of the Tentacle Beast, the sharks took Julien to an island of Russian space chimpanzees, where Julien met his old friend, Stanislav, and the leader of the chimps, Caesar. The Russian space chimps were at first not interested in joining the war, they instead wanted to go to Russia to pay their revenge against the humans there for sending them to space and dumping them on the island. So when they were building their blimp to fly to Russia, Pancho planted explosives in it and detonated it as they were in the middle of their flight to Russia. This caused the chimps to fall into the ocean water before the lemurs came to rescue them.

This plan was later interrupted when Mort was found in the tool shed by the guards. When sent to King Koto, he was interrogated by the king who asked him what he was doing.

   The Kingdom of Madagascar hosted a victory party on the night of their victory, lasting about three weeks, and it was said that the party caused more damage, higher casualties, and far greater destruction than the war itself. After the victory, the newly liberated people went their separate ways, back to their original homes and kingdoms to rebuild their kingdoms.

   The Mountain Lemur Kingdom, despite being the one to conquer Madagascar, was one of the kingdoms which suffered the most during the war. With the original grounds of the kingdom burnt down, they had to find a new place to settle down.

   As Sage, and later Clover, were crowned Rulers of the Mountain Lemur Kingdom, they were dedicated to finding a good place for them to re-establish their kingdom. After considering multiple territories, Sage decided to choose the location of the
   Old Kingdom
   . There, the Mountain Lemurs began to rebuild their nation and adjust to a peaceful lifestyle.

   The war changed the kingdom a lot. Not only did they go through an entire season of occupation by a foreign power, but even after they have regained their independence, they had a hard time getting the kingdom back together.

   King Julien took this as an opportunity to rebuild the kingdom, and a chance to do everything again, only this time the right way, after learning from past mistakes. He announced the Julien 2.0 initiative, where he wanted to turn over a new leaf and become a better king, a new version of his own self.

   Among the things in which he did was gathering anonymous opinions and suggestions from his people, from which he concluded that the people want their peace and safety back. King Julien introduced the Conflict-Free Life policy where nobody is allowed to judge anyone and everyone has to be treated the same, which allowed them to live peacefully without any conflict.

   In response to a case where a citizen of the kingdom said a hurtful word to another citizen, King Julien introduced the victim horn, a product that is distributed to every citizen of the kingdom, where they could use whenever one says a hurtful word. This however later caused chaos and it was concluded that the citizens of Madagascar should respect their differences and live as they did before.
