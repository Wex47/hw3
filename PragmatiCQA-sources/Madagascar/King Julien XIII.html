When he was looking for a weapon to defeat the fossa, he stumbled upon a boombox. When it played a song, he couldn't help but dance to the music. He felt in his heart that music, or his dancing, would be his ultimate weapon. He risks his own life to save his people, even when Masikura warns him he will be eaten. He bravely fights off the foosa at their territory with the assistance of the boombox.

   Later that night, King Julien had a meeting of the lemurs and other creatures of the jungle in the plane. Julien insisted that if they could make friends with Alex and his friends, the Fossa would be scared away for good. Maurice was skeptical about this plan since he had become suspicious of Alex due to Alex’s predatory nature beginning to show, but King Julien insisted that being king, his ideas were the best, so Maurice reluctantly agreed to this but still held onto his suspicions. Though his plan was a risky one, he did this protect his people from the dreaded foosa. Though he becomes self-obsessed and ignores Maurice's warning, the audience sees that he only wants his peoples' safety and shows qualities of a good leader.

   The next morning, King Julien and the lemurs welcome Alex and the gang into their kingdom with open arms. However, during a performance, Alex reverts to primal hunting instincts and bites Marty. Maurice informs them that Alex bit Marty because lions are carnivores and eat meat, particularly steak, which comes from other animals. Realizing that Maurice was right and admitting that his plan failed, King Julien banishes Alex to the predator side of the island with the rest of the Fossa. Alex shows his predatory characteristics and chases Mary. King Julien and Maurice are on a coconut tree and Maurice hits Alex with a coconut. King Julien praises him here.

After Alex has shown the foosa how savage he is, he hugs his friends. At this moment, King Julien appears with Maurice and asks Maurice to give him some love and hugs Maurice. Later, they help Alex control his cravings by feeding him sushi, which he actually loves. At this moment, King Julien offers Mort as "Plan B", hoping that Alex would eat Mort. Mort laughs at this moment.  As thanks for saving them from the fossa, King Julien gifted Alex the sacred crown used by the kings of the Julien lineage; however, he had already made himself a brand new, bigger, better one, with a gecko named

   King Julien is the ultimate party animal and is continuously full of himself. This spoiled king likes to order everyone around and he would be completely intolerable if not for his insistence that everyone has fun! King Julien's towering ego more than makes up for his pint-sized body. He's quick with an insult but even quicker with a smile, so it's hard for anyone to take this lemur too seriously. King Julien very much speaks his mind; even it might be rude or mean he gives his honest opinion. He is the most eccentric and colorful character. Sometimes he likes giving others advice (

   A common thread for his outlandish ideas involve finding some new way to keep his people happy. While Uncle King Julien ruled the kingdom with fear, King Julien encourages his people to have as much fun as they can, because who knows if there will be a tomorrow. His schemes and ideas revolve around improving their quality of life, from introducing coffee so they can get their jobs done faster, to creating 'fast food' so his people have more time for fun. He introduces trampolines, water slides, and regular dance parties to the kingdom as enrichment and as a means to distract them from the constant fear of being eaten.

   While many of his kingly duties seem to bore him, such as paperwork and the like, he loves having the role of king. On numerous occasions he seems to go above and beyond in his role as king to support his people, from attending their weddings to handing out prizes at graduation ceremonies. He takes a very proactive role in the lives of his people, and he is seen to learn many of their names as the show progresses.

   His friendship with Maurice and Clover also proves invaluable for bringing out positive lessons for him, and opportunities to prove himself to be a good friend and King. On many occasions when he's too self focused or proving to be selfish, Maurice and Clover will help to show him how his actions affect others, steering him towards making the right decisions. In the end, he proves that at heart he cares more about the happiness of others than his own ego, and finds happiness in the joy of others.

King Julien says that he loves his people, he is more than willing to solve problems and his "throne is always open." Though he seemed to act selfish and self-centered in the beginning of the series, he did have the love and caring towards his people in his heart but he did not share his feelings. Since he lost control over himself, he spewed out all his ideas that he was hiding. This shows that he loved his people.

Though he had no idea about what war is (when Clover says to give orders so she can begin to train the recruits for combat and to face the war, he says that there is no fighting in a war), his prime idea was only to unite his people. So, the audience can see that he only wants to make a better kingdom, though his ideas to do it are eccentric.

   A more visible romance is seen between Julien and Clover’s twin sister, Crimson. The two first meet when Crimson comes to the kingdom to find Clover. Her fun energy attracts Julien right away, and the two spend time doing risky activities together, much to Clover’s dismay. They begin a romantic relationship together, kissing under the stars the first night they meet. Later, Julien and Crimson announce an engagement, and begin to plan a wedding Julien is not prepared for. Intimidated by the idea of marriage, Julien backs out of the wedding on the day of, after hearing he is bound to Crimson “forever”. This leaves Crimson heartbroken, and she leaves the kingdom seeking revenge. She makes a deal with Julien’s uncle, and the two set out to kill him on multiple occasions. However, during All Hail King Julien: Exiled, Crimson’s loneliness on Siren Island leads her to trap Julien and propose they get back together. He agrees out of fear of a tentacle beast in the cave of the island. However, once Ted defeats the tentacle, Julien is quick to leave the island since he understands that his kingdom is more important than his life, leaving Crimson behind. On the morning of her sister’s wedding, Crimson tries to seduce King Julien one more time, telling him she never meant to hurt him. He walks away from her, and Crimson scoffs that she will “get him eventually”.

But, as the series progressed, it could be observed that their relationship grew more stronger and inseparable as they both improved themselves along the series: Clover grew to be less paranoid, King Julien learnt to take responsibilities and reduced taking unwanted risks.

According to Masikura, they become friends at the instance they saw each other. It is even found that both went to the same school.
