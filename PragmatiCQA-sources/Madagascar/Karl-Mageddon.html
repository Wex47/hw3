   The episode begins with King Julien and his people partying under the Central Baobab tree. Meanwhile, the rest of Madagascar’s people are living their normal lives. Out of the blue, a dark cloud covers Madagascar and begins to show characteristics of a thunderstorm. Julien asks his people not to panic but asks Maurice if this is normal and is not the world's end. However, Maurice whimpers in fear. Karl and Chauncey show themselves as a picture in a cloud, to announce their retirement and movement to Florida. Julien seems happy and turns away with Maurice, but Karl stops him to say that he is to begin Karl Con, where five contestants can participate with a partner. They need a golden mango as an entry slip and the one who wins Karl Con will be King Julien's new nemesis. The people of Madagascar begin to search for the mangoes.

   Back at the throne room, Julien thinks that no one can take him down if he is his own nemesis. Even Maurice agrees with King Julien's suggestion and Clover is amazed see that all 3 of them are on the "same page". King Julien sends Clover to find a mango. Willie finds the golden mango, but Clover hits him and takes it back to King Julien. King Julien laughs in joy. Clover tries to convince King Julien to take her but not tell it directly. Meanwhile, Mort tries to be his partner. Clover gets fed up and says directly to take her. Julien says to tell things directly and Clover groans in frustration.

   A huge screen is placed to see the competition while the kingdom cheer for their favorite player. The night before, Mort meets his Pop Pop (Grandfather) and is happy. Pop Pop says that he missed some Hanukkah so decided to give a gift. Mort thinks it is a pencil, but it is the last golden mango. Mort asks how he brought it and Pop Pop says that anything is possible if you break rules and parole. He then takes Mort to Karl Con. All contestants are at Karl's lair and Clover says to stay on alert. Karl comes coughing and Julien laughs, probably to mock. Karl turns a switch and takes his contestants inside.

   Karl shows his laboratory where he make deadly weapons with the help of his cockroach. He says the only rule at this stage is "No Touching." Grandpa Mort asks whether one gets the license to kill when the title "King Julien's nemesis" is given. Before Karl completed his answer, a cockroach creeks because Butterfish keeps his foot on it, to take a toffee like explosive. Karl blames him, but Tammy defends him. Karl sucks them out and reminds the others the only rule. All stare in fear.

But Karl stops them from eating because he says them to savour the moment which is a quality of a true, evil nemesis. Pancho says that they are starving and Karl says to savour. Karl says that one who eat looses. Julien asks what he or she looses and Karl leaves saying that they will have to wait and see. Grandpa Mort says to the "kids" to take the food and eat at the same time, but before he completed his sentence, Amy begins to eat. She asks not to judge her. Suddenly, Amy's stomach rumbles. She asks her dad what is happenning, which the Ambassador is unaware. A door opens and Amy begins to fart. With her dad, Amy flies out of Karl's lair.
