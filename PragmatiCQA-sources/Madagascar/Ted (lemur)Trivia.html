    Ted shares some common interests with
    <a href="King Julien.html" key="86383449-57e7-4a2c-bdb8-460cf2f33b9d" title="King Julien">
     King Julien
    </a>
    , as they both like dancing, singing, fashion designing, and being dramatic- sometimes overdoing it.
   </li>
   <li key="03f2709e-07b4-4307-a6d7-1e4adce15068">
    He loves weddings, to the point of crying at them.
   </li>
   <li key="bda1691d-6498-4567-b6f4-f6fafd60dbb3">
    He and
    Dorothy
    were the wedding planners of King Julien and
    Crimson
    's almost-wedding.
   </li>
   <li key="9917a65d-29ba-4fa2-bf17-3e7c4041f887">
    Ted's voice, though rather high-pitched and nasally, will get considerably lower depending on his mood.
   </li>
   <li key="86938e7f-7c55-4885-a42e-fc0179153136">
    Ted loves quiche, namely Dorothy's quiche, saying "It's out of this world!"
   </li>
   <li key="8bee668d-2c06-4013-aa00-99c5b45831dc">
    Ted, unlike Dorothy, and like Willie, is pretty bad at keeping illicit actions a secret without looking suspicious. This could be because he is often pretty honest and not a criminal/mischevious type.
   </li>
   <li key="b23b3d68-380f-49a1-b8d3-18cb30b2101c">
    Ted, though a happy guy, is very mercurial, meaning his emotions easily change.
   </li>
   <li key="8f5ddf05-3cb6-4163-bff5-a9cde9381ff1">
    Ted shares his name with Ted the polar bear from the Penguins of Madagascar short film, "
    A Christmas Caper
    ".
   </li>
   <li key="68b89dfe-9ade-4467-96d5-941679f53903">
    Ted is pretty good at making smoothies.
   </li>
   <li key="487799d2-5e09-4bce-8bb0-4925866a5b4f">
    He doesn't seem to mind doing chores, an example being when he enthusiastically cleaned up a spilled smoothie on King Julien's floor.
   </li>
   <li key="cfbc73f0-710f-4392-a90a-6cdceedf1a53">
    Ted is shown to have a bit of a flirtatious side, as he acted eager to meet someone new upon thinking Dorothy was taken by the foosa. He was, however, upset at first when he thought she was kidnapped, but King Julien then changed his attitude when he told him that there were many "fish in the sea".
   </li>
   <li key="8f1389de-5efc-4ccb-9652-e92b7bd4b1cf">
    Ted likes sparkly things. He seemingly wishes every year on Franksgiving for something sparkly.
   </li>
   <li key="fb37f5a0-944c-4219-866d-03f219002feb">
    He has a dream vacation, though it is unknown where he wants to go.
   </li>
   <li key="0d21a5b2-518c-4d8c-882e-430719db66d7">
    Eating kumquats used to be his dream job, but it became a nightmare to him after it did become his job.
   </li>
   <li key="9d52c7a6-eb3e-44da-bb9e-a615ce46d396">
    Ted is the first recurring character to have his name revealed in the series.
   </li>
   <li key="afc4eb38-8515-4472-82b4-68b0a302c805">
    It was implied that Ted knew King Julien before he became king, since King Julien said his name in the first episode, and was the only recurring character whose name he called.
   </li>
   <li key="1bf5c10e-7a2a-433c-b7f8-e2deb9092ba5">
    He is the only character currently to explode. Ted exploded while singing a war song. He lived and was unharmed.
   </li>
   <li key="8aad380b-23bf-4e2c-9efe-f45d03c008e5">
    Ted goes to kick-boxing practice regularly, and revealed to Horst that he does it to "channel his rage and hurt people."
   </li>
   <li key="ae6e07b6-d6cb-44ba-83b8-6efbd73085fa">
    Ted is also fluent in Squirrel and Truffle pig
   </li>
