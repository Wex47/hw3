   Despite common belief, Clover may not be a crowned lemur. This is supported by the following evidence.
  </p>
  <p key="a4f03821-bf6d-4f1f-b4b6-631873f39aab">
   <b key="fdaf9bbb-71e1-466d-95ed-fe4943aa84da">
    Only male
   </b>
   crowned lemurs have orange and black fur. Female crowned lemurs are silvery-grey and white, with a small, V-shaped orange "crown" on their foreheads.
  </p>
  <p key="8f7a08bc-8920-4753-9c84-da2d30ec8757">
   The crown on Clover's head is brown and forms a stripe down her back, which eventually blends in with the orange fur on her legs. Crowned lemurs have a black colored crown, which does not form a large stripe down their back. It ends at the back of their head (look at
   <a href="Pancho.html" key="5e25c1f9-9a66-4eae-b2f7-25aec4eeceea" title="Pancho">
    Pancho
   </a>
   for example).
  </p>
  <p key="63b2260a-4a94-4763-a094-d84fc5e15313">
   Clover has a shorter muzzle shape in comparison to a crowned lemur. Where crowned lemurs have a longer, grey-colored snout, Clover has a shorter, brownish purple-colored muzzle.
  </p>
  <p key="3d7ef3e7-9bf5-4765-823a-c1bdcd8a695c">
   Clover has a heart-shaped marking on her front. This would seem unusual for a crowned lemur, as most have a brown/cream-colored underbelly that forms no distinct pattern/shape.
  </p>
  <p key="5227a222-059b-46e4-90fa-3befa63ede5d">
   The ears of crowned lemurs are small and rounded, and usually grey, brown, or black in color, different from the color of the fur surrounding the ear. Clover’s ears are not like this, being pointed at the tips and the same color as the fur surrounding them (orange).
  </p>
  <p key="061ee233-a3ef-4d6d-af63-f5716c0ede5a">
   Clover's twin sister,
   Crimson
   , who is obviously related to her (which makes her the same species), has no crown marking on her head. Her fur also has a pink-colored tinge to it. This is impossible for a crowned lemur.
  </p>
  <p key="bcf6c3e4-2af3-4d98-a26f-f5714c116d59">
   Clover, unlike Pancho, an example crowned lemur, is not noticeably smaller than other lemurs. Pancho is quite noticeably smaller compared to other males, and even compared to Clover and other females. This is because crowned lemurs are one of the smallest species of ‘true lemurs’, meaning that compared to other similar lemur species, they are smaller. Clover does not appear to be noticeably smaller than other lemurs, and she is even a little larger than Pancho.
  </p>
  <p key="a01c0044-8a63-4f71-b981-75c84f8ccf5b">
   The most likely scenario is that Clover is not a purebred lemur, but is instead a mixed breed of lemur. She may still potentially be part crowned lemur, but has other lemur species mixed in her bloodline.
