   , and was constantly given lessons on hunting, although he displayed no interest in the activity. He would instead dance around rather than pounce on the toy his father used to train him. During one of the sessions, Alex was captured by poachers and in an attempt to save his son, Zuba chases the vehicle, damaging its safety harness. Zuba was soon shot in the ear and briefly delayed. As the truck turned, the crate Alex was contained in fell into a river, and began floating away. Zuba failed to retrieve him, believing that he was still captured by poachers. He eventually gave up and presumed Alex dead. Alex arrives in New York after floating over the Atlantic Ocean in his transport crate. He was later brought to the Central Park Zoo and proved to be very popular with the public. Due to spending most of his life at a Zoo, Alex didn’t remember his life in Africa or his birth name.

Animal-rights activists pressure the zoo into releasing them back into the wild, but on the ship back to the reserves located in Kenya, Alex and his friends fall into the ocean when the Penguins take over the ship. They eventually wash ashore on the beaches of Madagascar, and while Marty is excited to be free, Alex wants to go home, however, he later changes his mind. He grows very hungry after days of being unable to eat, not realizing that steak is animal flesh, and starts to regain his hunting instincts. Hunger drives Alex into a crazed state, which causes him to hallucinate everyone as steak and tries to eat Marty. After realizing what he did to Marty, Alex barricades himself in the predator area of the island. Marty pursues him, unwilling to leave his friend, but is attacked by the fossas, the native predators of Madagascar. After overcoming his hunting instincts, Alex works to defend Marty, and is later given sushi by the Penguins to satisfy his hunger.

   Alex is a brown and yellow lion with a glossy mane, which is usually shaped like a pentagon in most viewpoints, like the back or front, with a portion over his eyes extending outward. On certain angles, his mane looks more hexagonal because of this. Since the second film, he's had an Africa-shaped birthmark on his right hand. He also has blue eyes, just like his mother's. In most of the franchise, it is said that Alex has a soft fur and a silky mane.

  <p key="f268fbda-1790-48ac-ade7-eee12c45eb4d">
   Alex has the personality very similar to that of a celebrity because he became the star of the zoo at a very young age.
  </p>
  <p key="45af68be-9771-40e5-88a5-8618946cfca1">
   Alex loves the zoo and was surprised when he heard Marty's wish to leave and live in the wild. As the main attraction of the zoo, he is featured heavily on merchandise and gives an "Alex the Lion" snow globe and other merchandise to Marty for his birthday. He also shows an infatuation with steak, though later remarks that sushi tastes better.
  </p>
  <p key="5b3b452b-3af1-49c0-9a21-f87fd24b1af3">
   In the first film, he was very scared when he discovered his predatory nature and did his best to isolate himself from others to protect them. Despite his pride and selfishness, Alex is very loyal to his other Zooster friends, especially Marty. Alex never loses the opportunity to show off and boast that he is a star, but sometimes some situations make him nervous, like when he tries to deal with the penguins or his attempts to flirt with Gia in the circus. He is also determined to fix things when he knows he spoiled them, like when he fights with Marty, or his attempt to re-fit into the lion's pride or to convince the Zoosters to return to the circus and apologize to everyone.
  </p>
  <p key="43bf540a-2714-435e-b04a-7591ce8f60bc">
   Alex is also very energetic, he is able to raise morale to everyone around him and also has good leadership skills, especially in the third film, when he even manages to lead a complete circus.

   When Alex arrived at the Zoo, Marty said he thought he was a kind of a show-off, however, they later grew up as best friends. They were both neighbors and liked to sing together. Alex did not support Marty's idea about escaping the zoo but was one of the first to be willing to get it back.

   , they both had many conflicts. Alex had been sad for ruining the lives of his parents, did not realize that Marty also had his problems, and because of that he unintentionally said very hurtful things. When Alex decided to leave the reserve, he wanted to apologize to Marty before leaving. He managed to recognize him among all the zebras and both were reconciled, leaving the reserve together.

  </p>
  <p key="1eda614a-f863-4948-9e70-e7f296fd18d0">
   When Alex sees her for the first time, he's amazed by her stunning beauty. Gia, believing that they are from the circus lets them climb into the train when they were in danger. Inside the train, Gia is impressed when Alex says he knew how to do a trapeze.
  </p>
  <p key="73739edb-ad7c-4c1c-9768-83fe7c86ecdd">
   After the Penguins bought the circus, the animals prepared to give their show. Alex quietly decides to listen to Gia while she rehearsed alone, before falling down through the partition as it was made of paper. Alex denies that he was spying on her when she asks him, and tries to flirt with her but fails. Gia finds it rather clumsy and says that no one has spoken of him since they arrived, assuring that everyone felt sorry for the new circus boss.
  </p>
  <p key="3cac3f8b-0c07-4ab7-9199-174a56bb6cd1">
   Both collide heads accidentally but then Alex sincerely thanked her for letting him get on the train, she seemed happy. However, when she saw how he imitated Vitaly, she warned him not to do anything that would endanger the circus, because it meant everything for them.
  </p>
  <p key="db383bc7-ba44-416d-ae1a-d6cd7df32cf5">
   Alex gets nervous and accidentally places his paw on one of the ropes of the circus tent that is untied and pulls it to the ceiling, then falls right into Gia's arms causing the other fabrics that kept them hidden to fall and both are shamefully discovered in front of the rest of the circus.

  <p key="fa2cf73a-f000-467a-9f0c-0c66b0812e4e">
   Later they were both on a high platform, ready to practice trapeze. Alex says many things while nervously preparing to jump, Gia gives him a push and he ends up accidentally doing some tricks, in which Gia then copies, thinking it was part of the act. When Alex makes an erratic leap and was about to fall, Gia grabs him and both return to the platform where Alex holds her before she falls, staying close together while being surprised by the act he had practiced and begins to fall in love with her. They were later hit by Marty who was shot from his cannon, as they fell into a net. Alex and Gia look at each other, laughing as they bounced off the net.
  </p>
  <p key="61714d0e-38e2-4885-8bb4-b16cb035f962">
   In the next circus performance, Alex and Gia used pink paints combined. During the presentation, both give different jumps and tricks in the trapeze, many of them where one caught the other. Finally, both closed the presentation lacing together.

   The penguins are responsible for throwing it out but Gia finds Alex's note and discovers in anguish that he never was a circus animal, discovering with the others that everything was a lie. Alex tries to explain and Gia looks hurt when she learns that the Trapeze Americano was never real. The Zoosters were sad but Alex was still trying to talk to Gia but she said they had trusted him, then she walks away with the other circus animals.
  </p>
  <p key="e4bea9b5-f0b6-4b1e-81ee-6b5ee419cf8a">
   Realizing he misses the circus- especially Gia, he and the others decided to go back. Despite the deception, Gia and Stefano refused to go on stage without their partners. When they were informed that the Zoosters were captured, Gia was among the first to express that they should help them because they were their friends.

   When DuBois shot a poisonous dart at Alex, Gia saved him just in time, and he was excited to see her. Both used the trapeze to reach the flying platform of the circus. When Stefano was in danger, Alex and Gia used the trapeze to save him, but Alex grabbed DuBois and left Gia holding Stefano, she worried when she saw them fly so high. Alex defeats DuBois and uses the thrusters to take Gia and reach the balloons, there they both share a loving look smiling lovingly at each other as they celebrate for having achieved it. Alex and his friends eventually join the circus as permanent members.

   When Alex was young, Zuba gave him lessons in hunting and fighting but was disappointed when he (the name given to him by his parents before losing him) preferred to dance. In one of his lessons, when Zuba is distracted to fight Makunga, Alakay was captured by the poachers, as his father tried to save him before getting shot in the ear by one of the hunters, causing him to fall off the truck, Alakay's box fell into the river and Zuba did not notice, going back to chasing the hunters.
  </p>
  <p key="d160e0bf-37b4-4032-81af-420eb4dab79b">
   Zuba spent weeks looking for Alakay out of the reserve until he reached a certain time where he assumed he would not return because the hunters had killed him. Zuba spent the last years blaming himself for the loss of his son.
  </p>
  <p key="1d62f174-83aa-4d36-8b3b-799023a906da">
   When Alex and zoosters show up with the other animals from Africa, Zuba did not receive them well. On the other hand, Alex kept looking at him because his face was quite familiar, Zuba mistook Alex's words as a challenge to his alpha leadership and threatened him, but was stopped by his wife, Florrie, who immediately identified him as his son.
Zuba and Florrie recognized him by the birthmark of his paw, thus finally recovering his lost son. Alex was very happy to know that he had parents. Alex told his parents that he was the "King of New York:, but they interpreted him as really being a true King. Zuba was very happy for the arrival of his son, he even introduced him to the pride, but Makunga said he could not be part until he passed the Rite of Passage hullabaloo.
  </p>
  <p key="2cb39755-2777-4e8e-9141-33f7bedf7f5f">
   At night, Zuba and Florrie showed Alex where he slept when he was a cub, they even told him how he had disappeared at that time. Zuba was still blaming himself for what happened but Florrie always reminded him that it was never his fault. His parents ended up encouraging him and wishing him good luck for the rite of the next day.
  </p>
  <p key="9d2620a4-cf9c-4540-8f7c-da0f05b37632">
   Unfortunately, Alex lost the rite because he believed that it was really a dance competition and not a fight. He and his family ended up being banished when Makunga took control. Alex was disappointed when his father told him that he was not a true lion.
  </p>
  <p key="4c150097-dd74-4d0d-850e-6ec94623bb4b">
   Later, Florrie told Zuba that they should not lose their son a second time, in that, Makunga comes to tell Zuba that his son had gone out of the reserve to find out what had happened to the water before he ran to find him.
  </p>
  <p key="13bbf6a1-1b44-4d84-ba01-cd481bf5fcd5">
   Zuba attempts to rescue Alex from the New York tourists but when they are surrounded. Upon realizing that they were from New York, Alex began to dance to let people know that he is Alex, the lion from the Central Park Zoo. Zuba finally ends up joining his son to dance. And they were later rescued by the other Zoosters and together destroyed the dam.
  </p>
  <p key="5310c750-d36f-4102-bebc-3fc074e5d051">

  </p>
  <p key="6dc3e98c-a3f6-42c7-9f48-92dfc7f6a96f">
   Florrie has a really motherly character, she accepts her son as he is, even if he decides to dance and not to fight. It proved to be very encouraging when her son decided to do something, like when they introduced him to the pride, she was excited when they named him "King", or when Alex decided to do the rite and Zuba had to choose who would start first, but Florrie was too excited to encourage him, preventing Zuba from concentrating. She and Zuba still remember Alex's habits when he was young, even she let him keep his "foofie” even if Zuba did not want to, letting him be himself.

   She has loving habits like kissing him in the forehead when he said "good night", showing that she really loves him. She is also overprotective and is often terrified of losing him again, as when Zuba told her he was not a real lion, she scolded him and told her not to lose him once again. She was worried when Makunga told them that he left the reserve, but he was relieved when he saw them both (Zuba and Alex) safe and sound. She and Zuba are still calling him by his birth name, "Alakay."

   Alex is also very agile, running on four legs and able to reach a moving jeep. (Though weighing an unusual 250 kg or 550 lbs, according to DuBois). He is also good at jumping as he took a great leap on the moving train, making him an incredible trapeze artist. Alex and Gia could be considered the most agile animals in the circus, both were able to take a great turn together from the trapeze to the flying platform of the circus on the Zoo. Alex's agility may be due to his fascination with dancing since he was young, which is demonstrated when he danced with his father in Africa.
