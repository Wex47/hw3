En route to the reserve, however, the ship carrying the crates was hijacked by the penguins, who managed to escape and pilot the ship and all its creatures, excluding Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria, whose crates had fallen out of the ship, to Antarctica, where the penguins would be free. The crew was bound up and sent on a slow lifeboat to China.

Alex and the others were broken out of the zoo, though not before suffering a chase by Dubois, who had broken through the exhibit containing the cobras and attempted to kill Alex for his head, which she would mount on her wall as a trophy. Alex and the others managed to escape, however, and Dubois ended up within the cage that Alex was kept in.

Sealed off by brick walls, the lion pen had a large rock within it that Alex was famous for climbing on and roaring for zoo patrons’ entertainment. Along with this, the lion pen also had a heat lamp under which Alex would sleep at night. The lion pen was set lower than the zebra, hippopotamus and giraffe pens and walled off by brick walls and fences. Atop the rock was a small fan that could be activated with the press of a button, made for Alex to wave his mane with. On either side of the pen were two small sparkler cannons that would set off sparklers when Alex roared. After Alex was shipped out of Central Park, his exabit was closed when everyone in New York City visited the Zoo to mourn their loss of the 10 Animals (Alex being one of them) after hearing that the cargo ship, along with 6 shipping crates containing the 10 Animals (Alex included), was reported missing. after Alex along with his friends was tranquilized by Captain Dubois and her men The Lion Habitat was Reopened, albeit very short after Dubois was tranquilized by Mort, along with a Circus Show in the Central Park Zoo. when The Lemurs

The zebra pen was covered with grass and had a water trough and a section of cement floor onto which keepers placed bales of hay. The zebra pen was situated facing the Reptile House, the residents of which thoroughly disliked Alex and Marty speaking too loudly.

Surrounding the pool of water was a bare concrete floor, and flowers near the right of the pen. After Gloria was shipped out of Central Park,  her exabit was closed when everyone in New York City visited the Zoo to mourn their loss of the 10 Animals (Gloria being one of them) after hearing that the cargo ship, along with 6 shipping crates containing the 10 Animals (Gloria included), was reported missing. after Gloria along with her friends was tranquilized by Captain Dubois and her men the Hippopotamus Habitat was Reopened, albeit very short after Dubois was tranquilized by Mort, along with a Circus Show in the Central Park Zoo.  not much is known about what happen to the hippopotamus habitat, but what we do know is that her pen became gazelle pen, where an unnamed and unseen Thomson's gazelle resided.
