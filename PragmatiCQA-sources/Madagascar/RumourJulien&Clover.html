   The series spends a lot of time focusing on their development, not just apart but together. Many fans start shipping them by just the first episode.
  </p>
  <p key="945fbcf6-4766-4b8b-8a8b-8790cf8465f1">
   The first episode is when we get a clear view of their contracting personalities. Clover attacks problems head on, while Julien is still learning how to face them. They meet for the first time in the episode King Me and by the end of the episode, Julien promotes her to Captain of the Ringtail Guard, a title which Clover takes very seriously. Clover responds to this by stating in disbelief of how she has “so many ideas, your uncle never let me implement.” Clover is not used to physical affection, but throughout the series we can see her getting more and more comfortable with Julien leaning an arm around her neck or giving her a hug. In later seasons, she even leans up against him or falls on top of him (such as in The Good Book, when she tells Julien a joke) which shows some affection towards him. It gets to the point where she will still attack others for touching her (Clearly shown when Maurice tries to wax Pam's hand print in

   ) , but not Julien. So we can see that Clover does not mind King Julien's romantic and lovely physical gestures which shows that she too enjoys being with the company of Julien.

  <p key="1b86f243-ad0d-4490-872e-c9ca53127a1c">
   Juggling the task of being Julien’s bodyguard and Captain of the Ringtail Guard, Clover takes her two jobs very seriously. When danger strikes, she is always the first one to try and face it. She is commonly seen putting an arm in front of Julien to block him from said danger. Although Julien is more interested in fun than safety, she starts to rub off on him and he begins valuing her motivation to protect the kingdom. Julien starts rubbing off on Clover too. She learns the value of fun over fear, a mentality that Uncle King Julien taught her, in the episode Return of Uncle King. Julien is nearly an exact opposite from his uncle. Their relationships with Clover appear to be mirrored.

  <p key="a508ee07-35dd-4a16-930f-762acc724792">
   One of the most popular moments in the show is when Julien suggests they repopulate. The kingdom had just been under attack with almost all the lemurs taken, and he believes repopulating is how to get the people back. Julien immediately points to Clover and says, “Clover, you’re with me.” Clover's protective love is 1st expressed here, when she says that she will come and help to fight the foosas and take his people.
Julien promotes Clover to Captain of the Ringtail Guard, despite only knowing her for a day. He realizes her value and bravery quickly. It is the first episode where Clover mentions her relationship with Julien’s uncle, and it’s where we learn that the way Julien treats her is an exact opposite from the old ruler. Before this, Clover swings down while Julien’s dancing and yells, “nice job, your majesty!” She is referring to him saving the kingdom while she was knocked out. Julien smiles at her, as he continues to dance, and responds, “I’m a king now, Clover. It’s what I do.” Clover gives him a certain dazed look as he says this which is quite lovely and romantic. Such lovely eyes of her shows the love in her towards Julien.

    Uncle King Julien returns to the kingdom, shocking everyone. Julien still trusts his uncle so willingly goes along with his plan to spy on the fossa. When Clover discovers that Julien’s gone, she replies “without ME to guard him?” She tries to run off after him, but Uncle King Julien pulls her away and orders her to guard him instead. Knowing she can’t disobey the orders of her substitute king, she agrees. In an attempt to keep the king busy, she shows him all of Julien’s new changes to the kingdom, but Uncle King Julien hates each one. He then tries to sympathize with Clover, staring, “this can’t be easy for you.” Clover informs him that initially, it was hard, and Uncle King Julien reminds her that “fear is what motivates people to do their best. Not fun.” Clover is taken back. “That’s not what I meant..” she explains, knowing full way that Julien the 13th’s whole policy was fun. But UKJ orders her to tear down all of Julien’s changes anyway, and she does until Mort tricks her into trying the new water slide. Realizing that the new king’s idea of fun wasn’t all bad, she marches back to Uncle King Julien and tells him, “for the first time in a long time, the kingdom is happy. King Julien has made this a better place. Still needs a little work, but I intend to honor his changes until he gets back!” When UKJ retorts, “you’re wasting your breath. He is not coming back,” Clover tackles him. “Say that again real slow. I don’t want to miss a word.” Clover's extreme loyalty towards Julien is seen at this moment.

He explains it as: “I remembered how freaky dangerous I am when I don't have Clover to remind me how "freaky dangerous I am!” Sending her on vacation to finally get some alone time, he quickly realizes he needs her to survive. It’s not long before Foosa begin attacking the kingdom and he screams that she should never have been sent away. When Clover does come back, he says “you were missed.”

    Clover was clearly shown to be against King Julien marrying her twin sister, Crimson, as she did all sorts of crazy things to try and stop the marriage, to the extent of being called crazy by Maurice. While this antagonism towards the brief couple's relationship most likely stems from Clover's knowledge of Crimson's reckless and irresponsible behaviour, and her past of leaving a trail of destruction everywhere she goes (most likely out of fear that her sister would likely destroy the kingdom), others, however, believe that Clover is actually just jealous of her sister being in a relationship with King Julien. Indeed, Clover has displayed some tendencies that do hint some envy, as after King Julien and Crimson left the room, Clover contemptuously muttered on how carefree and jovial they were, claiming that it made her sick. This phrase and scornful tone could imply that Clover was indeed jealous of Crimson's relationship with the King.

    Her apparent jealousy was even pointed out by Maurice, and he hinted and suggested that Clover might be in love with King Julien when he said: "You work closely with someone and become friends sometimes... feelings develop!" (Clover made no attempt to deny this suggestion, but instead replied that she would feel better if she broke into Crimson's bed chambers and thoroughly searched to be sure everything was on the up and up, something which made Maurice call her crazy, leading to Clover to react very violently). Even King Julien noticed her possible jealousy and teased her about seemingly being in love with him at the end of the episode, before she harshly dismisses it.
