    The Penguins of Madagascar is a spin-off of the "Madagascar" films, even though it occasionally makes a few references to them. The series follows the adventures of four penguins: Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico who perform various paramilitary missions to protect their home in the Central Park Zoo. The penguins often have to deal with problems caused or made worse by the lemurs

    "The Penguins of Madagascar" is an animated show currently airing on the Nickelodeon network. The series is based on the military-esque adventures of 4 penguins living in the Central Park Zoo in New York. The penguins had their first appearance in the movies "Madagascar" in 2005 where they were part of a subplot to try to make it back to their homeland of Antarctica by hijacking a ship. They find Antarctica too cold and eventually end up on the warm island of Madagascar. "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" was the 2008 sequel to "Madagascar" and once again featured the penguins antics as they tried to reconstruct an old airplane in order to leave Africa.
   </p>
   <p key="a78073f3-ac75-4ba3-8e0e-7a9bf038bf58">
    The penguins had their first separate adventure in an animated short called "The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper" which aired in theaters on October 7, 2005 with the stop-motion film, "Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit". This short was included on later editions of of the "Madagascar" and "Shrek" DVDs which were both released on November 15, 2005. This was also the unofficial pilot episode of the TV show.
   </p>
   <p key="5c5045e8-10a4-429a-bd89-f19aaedc3ff8">
    It was decided in 2006 that there should be a Nicktoon based on the "Madagascar" movie. No details about anything having to do with the show or its characters were confirmed until November 2007, when Nickelodeon advertised a sneak peak of three new shows that were coming to Nickelodeon for the 2008 year.
   </p>
   <p key="24444e80-78be-4909-8f9b-412b50aa49b7">
    Due to a delay of the release of the movie "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" to November 7, 2008, the Nickelodeon show was also delayed. Season one was confirmed for 26 episodes and in January 2009, even before the shows actual television premier, a second season was confirmed for another 26 episodes, bringing the total to 52.On February 6, 2009, the double DVD Pack of "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" was released and came with a preview DVD of the show, featuring the episodes “Popcorn Panic” and “Gone in a Flash". The "Popcorn Panic" episode was shown in many other countries around the world before airing on Nickelodeon on May 9, 2009.
   </p>
   <p key="2e2e0f45-ffa6-4738-94bd-9521eb67c712">
    On November 28, 2008, the first two episodes, "Popcorn Panic" and "Gone in a Flash" aired as part of a "Super Stuffed Nicktoons Weekend" along with two other contenders for new shows, "The Mighty B!" and "Making Fiends". They aired right before 7 brand new episodes of the sixth season of "SpongeBob Squarepants".
   </p>
   <p key="0b5abf24-b3e2-4281-a3e6-12b334ad82ca">
    The actual series premier happened on March 28, 2009 with the episodes "Launchtime" and "Haunted Habitat". The premier occurred right after the Nickelodeon 2009 Kids' Choice Awards and drew 6.1 million viewers making it Nickelodeon's most watched series premier of all time.

    Each half hour show consists of two 11 minute episodes and are not permanently paired, meaning the two episodes shown together in the half-hour time slot might not be the same pair as a future airing of the show. The show is co-produced by  DreamWorks Animation and Nickelodeon Animation Studios (both in California), and the animation is done by DK Ent. and Paprikaas studios in India. For voice casting, the series used many original voice actors from the "Madagascar" movies. However, a few of the original movie voice talents were not able to do work for the show due to other involvements so other actors had to be found. The final cast ended up being perfect and unless noted, one cannot tell the difference between the film and show voices!
   </p>
   <p key="2703b204-249f-493e-8ad4-65504033669b">
    There are other small differences between the movies and the show such as the zoo grounds/habitats and certain features of some the animals. The 4 penguins were given different silhouettes than their movie counterparts in order to better tell them apart. Many new animals now live at the zoo as well, most likely in order to form new stories for episodes around.
   </p>
   <p key="7d4aab73-2ec4-4f05-9f61-e8609935ae01">
    The actual show revolves around the adventures of the 4 penguins, Skipper, Kowalski, Private and Rico as they try to get by on a daily basis and protect their habitat at the Central Park Zoo. Everything they do is treated as a strategic military style commando/spy mission and each team member plays a certain role in the group. They are often harassed by a trio of Lemurs from Madagascar, King Julien, Maurice and Mort. The events of the series are supposedly set after "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" but it is unknown as to how the penguins and lemurs arrived at the zoo without the other characters from the Madagascar movies. The show started production before an ending to "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" had been established. Rumor has it that Tom McGrath (creator of the show and voice of Skipper) said "It's not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe." Despite the fact that he says the show isn’t specifically right after the first Madagascar movie, but took place sometime after the movie, Many People misread his statement, and believed it was set in a own alternate universe By using his end quote "I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe". (even though Tom McGrath stated he thinks of them as like they’re in a different universe, not it’s in a different universe.), this will later be confirmed to be in the same universe as the films, with episodes such as "The All Nighter Before Christmas", and "The Return of the Revenge of Dr Blowhole". When A third installment of the movie series was confirmed fans of the show thought the third movie would hopefully complete the missing storyline segments! This would later be false, as the Penguins, Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, And Private. The Chimps, Mason and Phil. And the lemurs, King Julien, Maurice, And Mort. Joined a circus At the end of Madagascar 3. Though it is most likely that the show takes place after "Penguins of Madagascar the movie" as it makes sense as the penguins have left the circus and most likely the lemurs and chimps came back with them, so this is most likely when the show takes place.
   </p>
   <p key="afe88608-4609-481f-9617-fc0283a7f3e3">
    Many elements of the show also got adapted into the lore of "Madagascar" with Mort being obsessed with king Julien's feet first being introduced in the show as well as the penguins redesigns being adapted for their spinoff movie. Even though the show might not be considered by fans to be fully canon many elements of it have been made canon so one can assume that the show is considered full canon by DreamWorks.

He also have an obsession with the show "Lunacorns", along with going to their events, buying their merchandise, and even citing advice and words of wisdom the characters on the show say, much to the annoyance of his fellow penguins and animals. Unlike the other penguins, He doesn't appear to get angry at the lemurs like the other penguins, even offering to help them in several episodes and is even proud of doing something good for them (even though the other penguins aren't).

     and pretty much everyone. He is the self-proclaimed "King of the Zoo" no doubt due to his former king status on Madagascar. Only Mort and Maurice truly believe and respect him as their king, everyone else just humors him, showing up to his royal decrees. Because he is extremely conceited, selfish and rather dim-witted, Julien is a terrible king. It seems that he will only let people talk good about him. Julien could even be narcissistic in that way. But it has been referenced twice in the series that deep down, he mainly wants his friends to stay by his side.

Although Mort is both disliked and pushed around by King Julien, he does not seem to be bothered by it. A big reason why Mort likes King Julien is because of King Julien's feet. Because of this, he always volunteers to help King Julien. Although King Julien dislikes him, he actually enjoys Mort worshiping him, as he has confessed many times.
