Lurani and Cortese raced for the team full time unlike Villoresi who had committements to racing in the works Maserati team, who was only a part time driver. Lurani however ended his racing career permanently in 1938 due to an accident in his Maserati car while racing at the British Crystal Palace race circuit. Lurani after retiring from racing turned tomanaging the Scuderia Amborosiana instead.

The team mainly competed in Formula 2 and non-championship Fomula 1 races during the season with Hampshire and Murray at the wheel with Cortese making an occasional appearance however the team did enter 2 races during the season in the F1 championship with David Murray at the wheel, the first at Britain where he retired and then straight after in Germany however Murray failed to start the race due to damage on his car in a crash during qualifying.

Between 1952-53 Ambrosiana made no appearances in championship F1 races and stuck to no-championship and F2 races with Hampshire and Murray at the wheel. In 1953 however the team was close to bankrupt and could no longer afford to use the Maserati chassis anymore and so ended the partnership after 16 years so for the 1954 season they raced with older and cheaper Ferrari chassis instead.

   The team returned to F1 with Parnell at the wheel however once again the team failed to finish the race at Britain. The team continued to run in F2 and non champ F1 races with Hampshire and Parnell at the wheel until the end of the season before the funds finally dried up and the team closed its doors forever. Parnell continued to race until 1958 with much success however Hampshire finally decided he had enough after the desolution of Ambrosiana and retired from racing.
