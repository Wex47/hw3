Test drivers are often placed as reserve drivers in case one of the racing drivers of the team is injured or unable to participate in the race allowing the test driver to take their place in the races until the race driver is able to return to their seat.

   Most drivers spend their time as a test and reserve driver for about one to two years before they return to an F1 seat or move on to other series yet some drivers have opted to remain a dedicated test and reserve driver for many years with a particular team and in doing so have become full time test and reserve drivers.
