   For 2003, Vettel made a further step in his motor racing career inwhich he began competing in single-seaters joining the Formula BMW ADAC series within his homeland of Germany. Vettel joined the Eifelland Racing Team partnering Andreas Wirth, a driver who was competing in his second season of Formula BMW. Despite this, Vettel was able to consistently outmatch his teammate at nearly every event and went on to take a total of five wins, five pole positions and twelve podiums throughout the nineteen race season. These results were enough for him to finish second in the championship behind Maximilian Götz.

By the mid-point of the season both Vettel and Di Resta were nearly equal in the title race.

Whilst his almost immediate recovery proved to be a surprise to everyone in the paddock, Vettel failed to be able to compete to the best of his ability for the rest of the season and was forced to succede the title to teammate Di Resta.

Vettel, however was not able to maximise the car's potential in qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix, ending up in 18th place, two places behind teammate Bourdais. The race would, however, see a dramatic change in fortunes. The mixed conditions that engulfed the race enabled many of the backmarkers to make up significant ground in the race. With many cars being involved in collisions and retirements in the race, including Vettel's teammate Bourdais, Vettel would be among the lucky few to benefit in these conditions, climbing to fifth position by the conclusion of the race. Awarding Toro Rosso with some valuable points in the championship.

   The Hungarian Grand Prix saw Red Bull hold a significant advantage over their Brawn rivals. Despite missing out on pole position to Renault's Fernando Alonso, Vettel qualified second with teammate Webber third. The Brawn's stuck in the mid-field. Vettel made a poor start off the line letting Hamilton, Webber and Räikkönen through at the start. As they ran down to the first corner, Vettel hit the rear of Räikkönen damaging his front wing. The incident enabled Heikki Kovalainen and Nico Rosberg to get passed Vettel as well. Vettel then ran an uncompetitive race, and on lap 29, he was forced to retire due to a suspension failure, presumed to be caused by his accident with Räikkönen at the start. As a result, Vettel lost second in the championship standings to teammate Webber who took third in the race.

Vettel dropped to fifth at the start behind Kimi Räikkönen, despite remaining with the leaders and competing with race leader Hamilton, Vettel's hopes for victory were ruined after his first pit stop when the fuel pump failed to work forcing him to stop again the following lap. Worst still he suffered an engine failure on lap 23 sending him into retirement.

   The situation improved slightly by Singapore with Vettel starting on the front row of the grid, losing out to Lewis Hamilton in gaining the pole position. Nonetheless, Vettel was crucially ahead of all his championship rivals. Vettel eager for a race win duelled with the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton throughout the race. Despite losing his right wing mirror and damaging the underside of his car, Vettel continued to pressure the reigning champion. However his victory hopes were denied when the stewards handed him a drive through penalty for speeding in the pit lane. Due to this delay, Vettel dropped to fourth, a position he would remain in until the end of the race. Vettel was unable to take out any significant amount of points from his championship rivals, with Button and Barrichello finishing fifth and sixth.

Qualifying proved to be a disaster for Vettel managing sixteenth in the mixed conditions.

The Red Bull appeared competitive in the race and despite a collision with Heikki Kovalainen's McLaren on the opening lap, Vettel was able to stage a strong comeback drive. Vettel managed to climb the field and get passed both Button and Barrichello, who failed to maximise his pole position standing. Despite climbing up to fourth by the end of the race, Vettel lost the championship to Button who finished the race a single position behind Vettel.

   Going into the new season, Red Bull looked competitive once again, both Vettel and Webber performing well in pre-season testing. The pace of the team was evident upon arriving in Australia for round 1 of the championship. Vettel took pole position ahead of teammate Webber. At the start Vettel maintained his lead ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso. Vettel led the race with the two Ferrari's sharply on his tail for the remainder of the first stint of the race. Following the first round of pit stops, Vettel found he had lost the lead to the Force India of Adrian Sutil. Sutil unlike most of the field had started the race on the medium compound tyre, instead of the softs which enabled him to last longer at the front. Vettel found he was unable to overtake his fellow German, rival Alonso opted to come in early for his second pit stops in order to undercut the two cars ahead of him. Vettel and Sutil pitted a lap later and whilst Vettel jumped Sutil in the pit stop, he had lost the lead to Alonso who had made the undercut work by pitting a lap earlier. The pair however had both lost out to Kimi Räikkönen's Lotus who had taken the lead of the race, by the conclusion of the Grand Prix, Räikkönen took the victory ahead of Alonso and Vettel.

   Malaysia was the next venue on the calendar. Vettel took a convincing pole position by a full second ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Massa and Alonso. At the start, Alonso damaged his front wing when he hit the back of Vettel whilst trying to overtake at the start. On the second lap Alonso's wing collapsed causing him to slide into the gravel trap and into retirement. This meant that Webber took second position after making a strong start from fifth on the grid. After Vettel's first pit stop he lost the lead to the faster Webber during the pit interval. Webber who now had a convincing lead over Vettel was told over the radio that Vettel would not challenge him for the lead and the two cars would maintain position to the finish. Despite this team order Vettel closed up to Webber and overtook him for the lead. Vettel would go on to win the race with Webber second. Webber felt that he had been cheated by Vettel's disobediance and angrily enquired about the "multi 21" strategy the team was on after the race. The multi 21 incident is what believed to be the catalyst for Webber's decision to retire from Formula One at the end of the season. Red Bull management admitted Vettel had disobeyed team orders, yet he saw no disciplinary action from the team following the incident.

   Vettel struggled in qualifying for the next race in China. He could only manage a disappointing ninth on the grid. Vettel started the race on the harder tyres which allowed him to continue much longer than all his rivals in front of him who were on the soft tyre. This meant Vettel inherited the lead when the other front runners were forced to pit. Vettel was then able to open up a significant lead with his rivals far behind him having pitted. However it wasn't long before his own tyres began to degrade, meaning that he lost significant time to Alonso in second position. On lap 28 Alonso took the lead of the race from Vettel. Vettel then opted to pit for new tyres dropping to fourth position behind Kimi Räikkönen and Lewis Hamilton, he would remain in that position for the remainder of the race. In Bahrain, Vettel started from second place being denied pole position by the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. At the start Rosberg maintained his lead into the first corner, but on the second lap Vettel took the lead of the race. Vettel remained relatively unchallenged throughout the entire race, taking the win ahead of the two Lotus cars of Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean.

   At the Spanish Grand Prix, Vettel qualified in third position behind the two Mercedes cars of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. At the start Vettel climbed to second with Rosberg leading and Alonso in third place. Although Vettel managed to get past Rosberg in the first round of pit stops, Alonso leapfrogged them both to take the lead. However, Vettel's four stop strategy gamble did not pay off and by the end of the race he had dropped behind Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa. Vettel went on to finish the race in fourth position. With this result, Kimi Räikkönen reduced Vettel's lead in the championship to three points.

   In Monaco, Vettel once again qualified in third, being beaten by the two Mercedes cars of Rosberg and Hamilton once again. At the start, Vettel retained his third position and followed the two Mercedes cars. During the first set of pit-stops, an error in judgement from Mercedes meant both their cars had to pit at the same time. This meant Hamilton lost a lot of time and therefore dropped to fourth behind Vettel and Webber. Vettel would go on to finish the race in second ahead of Webber and behind Rosberg.

   At the British Grand Prix, the Mercedes cars once again proved to be superior in qualifying as Hamilton and Rosberg lined up ahead of Vettel in third place. At the start, Vettel was able to climb to second splitting the two Mercedes cars. Hamilton, however, was opening up a convincing lead until he suffered a tyre blowout. This meant Vettel inherited the lead, but a gearbox failure meant that Vettel was forced to retire from the race whilst leading.

Vettel managed to hold on to the lead and take the race win. Despite Vettel's success in his career, this marked only the first time he had managed to win at his home Grand Prix.

   Hungary was the next venue, and once again, the Mercedes of Hamilton proved to be superior in qualifying taking the pole position ahead of Vettel. Unlike in Germany, Hamilton held the lead at the start of the race and began to pull away. The front runners suffered from severe tyre degradation and were forced to pit. Hamilton and Vettel exited the pits behind the McLaren of Jenson Button. Whilst Hamilton was able to get by the McLaren relatively quickly, Vettel was stuck behind the McLaren for many laps before he was finally able to overtake. The time lost behind Button meant that Kimi Räikkönen was able to get past Vettel in the next round of pit stops. Vettel would finish the race third behind Hamilton and Räikkönen.

Vettel however was able to take the lead from Grosjean during the first round of pit stops, he would hold the lead for the remainder of the race. It would be a Red Bull 1-2 with Webber finishing in second position.

Despite issues with his KERS and drinks bottle towards the end of the race, Vettel went on to dominate the race and took his fourth world title due to the fact Alonso finished in eleventh place. Red Bull also took their fourth consecutive constructor's championship in this race. Vettel notably performed doughnuts on the track during the cool-down lap, despite this move being slightly controversial, the stewards took no action against Vettel.

Pre-season testing was difficult for the Red Bull outfit, the new chassis proved highly unreliable in the opening test in Jerez. Whilst the team's reliability improved by the Bahrain tests, Vettel and Red Bull had not conducted much testing in comparison to many of their rivals.

   It was evident that Vettel was struggling upon arriving for the first race in Australia. Vettel suffered performance issues throughout qualifying and could only manage a dismal thirteenth on the grid. Teammate Ricciardo faired much better, starting the grid from second position at his home race and first for Red Bull. Vettel's race would end prematurely after only three laps due to an engine failure. Ricciardo would go on to finish the race in second position, yet was disqualified due to a fuel irregularity, meaning Red Bull failed to score any points in the opening race of the season.

Vettel, however made a poor getaway at the start, dropping to fourth behind the second Mercedes of Nico Rosberg and teammate Daniel Ricciardo. After a tight battle with Ricciardo, Vettel was able to muscle his way ahead of his younger teammate back into third position. Vettel would remain in third for the remainder of the race, powerless to challenge the superior Mercedes chassis, finishing behind Hamilton and Rosberg in the race.

   Vettel suffered another disappointing qualifying in Bahrain, managing only a eleventh position. Teammate Ricciardo faired better to go third fastest, however due to a grid penalty, he dropped to thirteenth on the grid. At the start Vettel was able to make up places on the grid in the opening laps, however his charge was halted when he became stuck behind the Force India of Nico Hülkenberg in fourth position. This allowed teammate Ricciardo to close upon Vettel, the team then ordering Vettel to let Ricciardo through due his faster track times. Ricciardo then managed to dispose of Hülkenberg for fourth place. Vettel would finish the race in sixth place.

Despite strong initial pace, Vettel proved to be less competitive than the cars behind him, losing places to Nico Rosberg and Fernando Alonso.

Despite being instructed for the second race in succession by Red Bull management to let Ricciardo through, Vettel responded over the team radio with "tough luck" and refused to make way for Ricciardo.

   Sebastian Vettel is known for his uniqueness in his helmet design for Formula One. Vettel has been experimenting with helmet designs since his early karting days at the age of eight. Vettel as a child wished to race with a picture of the crab from The Little Mermaid enscribed on his helmet design, the crab was incidently known as Sebastian as well. Since the 2008 season Vettel has raced with the

   coat of arms on his helmet, this is in honour of the region of Heppenheim where he was born. Vettel's traditional helmet design has been influenced by the Red Bull logo and insignia due to his career being entirely influenced and sponsored by the drinks company. The basic design of Vettel's helmet is a cheqeured blue and white helmet, with the Red Bull logo enscribed to the mid-level either side of Vettel's helmet. Vettel is known for consistently changing his helmet design, however whilst he has sported many different variations of helmet designs, a majority have been based on his traditional helmet design. Vettel retires a helmet design after each race win, beginning a new design following his win. Whilst Vettel retires his helmet designs following a race win he has been known to regularly retire helmets before he has managed to achieve a race win with them.
