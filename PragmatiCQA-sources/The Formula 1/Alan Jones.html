   . A promising motor racing career was nearly cut short when his father's business went bankrupt during the Australian economic recession of the late 1960s. In 1967, Jones at the young age of 20 went on a holiday with friends to the United Kingdom and Europe. Touring the local race courses, Jones had decided that if he was truly going to do motorsport for a living, he would have to move to Europe in order to be successful. However unfortunately for Jones he lacked even the finances for a Formula Ford drive.

   Three years later in 1970, Jones had made the move to the United Kingdom with little more than 50 pounds in his pocket. Jones and fellow Australian driver
   Brian McGuire
   started a business selling well used minivan's to fellow Australian migrants. The meager profits earned from this business was enough for Jones to enter motor racing on a shoe string budget.

   Jones's initial career had little impact. Due to his constricted budget he had been racing around in Formula Ford with little success, however in 1971 he had acquired enough finances to purchase an old Lotus 41 for Formula Three. Jones's initial plan was to upgrade it to Formula Two specifications and sell it in Australia in order to finance a season in Formula Three. This plan went horribly wrong however when he crashed the car at

   Jones who was going through troubled times had a morale boost when his father Stan moved to the United Kingdom in late 1971 to be with his son. However the 1972 season proved little better than the season before, the lack of budget proving difficult for Jones to prove himself. The following year in 1973, Jones signed for a low-end team called DART Racing. The year started with another added low, Alan's father Stan died due to a stroke. Despite being distraught by his father's loss, Jones would finally prove  himself in 1973. The first race after his father's death, Jones took his first Formula Three victory at Silverstone. Jones was an immediate title contender, he took three wins in the entire season and lost the championship by only two points to

   Despite a promising start, Jones's campaign with Surtees turned out to be dreadful. The car proved difficult to drive and troublesome. Despite the troubles Jones was able to consistently muscle his car onto the back of the grid consistently, where as teammate Lunger who proved no match for his teammate struggled regularly to qualify. Jones despite the poorly Surtees car was beginning to establish a reputation as a fast and consistent driver. Rarely making a mistake, Jones was often able to capitalise on other's misfortune where he would slowly climb the field and on occasions climb into points positions. At the Belgian and British events, Jones was able to move into fifth position achieving points finishes for the Surtees team.

Jones had climbed up to a remarkable fourth position which soon became third when race leader and championship challenger James Hunt was forced into the pits. Hunt needing a third place to win the title came upon the rear of Jones where he overtook with relative ease. Hunt and many others within the Formula One community believed that Jones had slowed down and allowed Hunt through to take the third place in order to secure his world title, an act Jones denies claiming that Hunt had simply passed him on the track. Nonetheless the move saw Jones receive the support and admiration from the new world champion for the remainder of his career.

   Although 1976 had seen Jones prove himself as a driver, he had become increasingly disillusioned with the Surtees team throughout the season. Jones believed John Surtees to be an ineffectual team leader who refused to listen to Jones's advice on changes he believe needed to be made on the car. Despite the disagreements, Surtees could not deny his driver's potential and offered a contract for 1977. Jones however was fed up with the troubles at the Surtees team and refused the contract even if it meant sacrificing a race seat amongst the Formula One grid for the following season.

   For 1981, Alan Jones was firmly established as the number one driver within the Williams team. Carlos Reutemann remained in the team but was forced to sign as an effective number two to Jones at Williams. Whilst Jones was popular and worked well with the Williams team, Reutemann had proved to be moody and unreliable despite proving to be a very quick racing driver in the previous season.

   Tensions between FOCA and FISA meant that the first round of the championship at Kyalami meant that the race was stripped of championship points as the Spanish race had been done the previous year. Reutemann took the race victory as Jones struggled throughout the race before going on to retire with a loose skirt. The first race to count for championship points was the Long Beach race in the USA. Jones was second on the grid with teammate Reutemann in third, Patrese's Arrows in an unexpected pole. The two Williams cars took the lead, Reutemann leading Jones. Whilst the two cars appeared evenly matched in pace, Reutemann under team orders was forced to give way to Jones who went on to take the race win.

   Whilst Jones walked away from Long Beach in prime position to defend his title, his teammate Reutemann was privately fuming at having to give way to his teammate so early in the season when the two drivers were so evenly matched. This conflict was to come to a head in the next round of the championship in Brazil. Whilst Piquet took pole position, Reutemann and Jones were right behind him in their Williams's. The race held in pouring rain saw Piquet's Brabham fade as the two Williams cars were set to dominate once again. Reutemann led whilst Jones tailed him throughout the race, patiently waiting for Reutemann to get the order to let his team leader through. Late in the race, the Williams team brought out the pit signal which ordered Reutemann to move over. Much to Jones's confusion, his teammate refused to let him through. Jones continued to patiently wait for Reutemann to let him through rather than fight him but Reutemann defiantly disobeyed his team not wishing to sacrifice a race win twice in a row. Reutemann won the race with Jones finishing in second place. Jones was furious with his teammate and refused to attend the podium celebration. From thereon Jones realised that Reutemann was not going to assist his championship endeavours and if he was to take a second world championship, it would be without the assistance of his 'number two' driver.

   After a poor qualifying in San Marino, Jones made his traditional flying start going from eighth on the grid to fourth. Jones found himself inconveniently behind Reutemann. It was evident to all that neither driver viewed each other as teammates engaging in a brief bloodthirsty duel. As Jones went for an overtake, Reutemann angrily shut the door and in doing so took off Jones's front wing. A sudden loss of performance afflicted Jones and he was forced to pit for repairs, meaning he finished well outside of the points during the race. Reutemann took third whilst Jones's other old nemesis Nelson Piquet took the race win.

   Heading into Zolder, Jones had dropped down to third in the championship standings. Reutemann consolidated a strong championship lead whilst Piquet had usurped him from second following his Monaco race win. Jones had another frustrating qualifying taking eighth once again, watching on as Reutemann took pole. In the race, Jones was a man on the move. Jones worked his way up into fourth place before getting stuck behind Piquet's Brabham. Jones was at this point the fastest car on track, however Piquet was preventing his further advancement by proving to be incredibly difficult to pass. Frustration eventually got the better of Jones and on the tenth lap, he forced his way down the inside of Piquet knocking the Brabham into the barriers. A furious Piquet stormed back to the pits and angrily berated Frank Williams about his driver, threatening to break Jones's legs at one point. Nonetheless once free of Piquet, Jones quickly disposed of Pironi and Reutemann ahead of him to take the lead. Jones was enjoying a comfortable lead with Reutemann distancing himself behind him in second place. However disaster then struck on lap 20, Jones missed a gear and went wide speering into the wall at the Bianchi turn. Upon impact with the barriers, the radiator exploded scalding Jones's leg. Jones shaken and battered from his recent accident, limped from the car however he had luckily escaped the accident largely unscathed.

   The next race in Monaco, Jones had another disappointing qualifying only managing seventh. His race faired better as he climbed up the order due to the retirements of several cars in front of him. After overtaking Villeneuve's Ferrari, Jones began to chase after race leader Piquet. Piquet had heavily criticised Jones's driving style following their coming together in Belgium, something Jones himself was mightily unhappy about. Jones began to relentlessly attack Piquet's Brabham, the Brazilian doing all that he could to keep the Williams driver behind. Eventually Piquet's will to fend off the unrelenting Williams driver broke and he crashed into the wall, leaving Jones back into the lead. Jones was left in the lead seemingly unchallenged until lap 67 when his engine began to misfire. Jones returned to the pits for a check-up and exited the pits only just ahead of Villeneuve's Ferrari. Jones seemingly had the win in hand, however Villeneuve behind him was determined to get the race win and took the lead with four laps to go. Jones disappointingly finished behind Villeneuve, but had gained some crucial places in the championship with his second place finish. He was now second in the championship, ten points off teammate and arch rival Carlos Reutemann.

   At Jarama, Jones put in a strong qualifying to put his Wiliams second on the grid, sitting behind only the Ligier of Jacques Laffite. He took the lead of the race at the start and began to pull out a drastic lead. For the third race in a row, Jones seemed to have the race in hand, however like in Zolder Jones made a crucial mistake and spun off the circuit. Jones was able to rejoin the race, but finished the grand prix well outside the points. Reutemann, gained three points on him in the championship, however his other key rival Piquet failed to finish the race.

   The next round was held a Dijon for the French Grand Prix. It would be another poor weekend for Jones, it all began with a poor qualifying that saw him line up ninth on the grid. From the start of the race, Jones began to experience mechanical troubles that forced him into the pits for repairs. This therefore dropped him well out of contention. His rivalry with Piquet sparked up once again, despite being several laps behind the leaders due to his mishaps Jones was lapping at equal pace with the frontrunners. Jones came upon the rear of Piquet's Brabham who was leading the race. Piquet stubbornly refused to allow Jones through, much to the Australian's frustration. Jones finished the race for the second race in a row outside of the points. This had hurt his championship ambitions as he dropped to third in the standings, two points now behind Piquet.

   Ahead of the next race in Silverstone, Jones led the GPDA against the FISA President, Jean-Marie Balestre surrouding the issue of fines being issued to drivers following the debacle in Zolder. Despite the two men despising one another, Jones on behalf of the GPDA managed to come to a compromise with Balestre surrounding the fines. The race would be markedly less succesful. After another poor qualifying which saw him start from seventh on the grid, Jones was taken out of the race when himself and another driver,

   At Hockenheim, Jones was able to improve his qualifying performance, starting from fourth on the grid behind Reutemann and the two Renault's of Arnoux and Prost. Jones was the man on the move and quickly disposed of Reutemann and Arnoux and began to challenge Alain Prost's Renault for the lead. As was typical of Jones, he began to employ a relentless attack method to the car in front of him. Prost's turbo charged Renault had the advantage on Hockenheim's long straights, however Jones was all over the rear of Prost in the corners. On lap 21, going into the Sachs-Kurve, Prost whilst lapping teammate Arnoux moved to the outside to pass. Jones on the other hand moved to Arnoux's inside and cunningly took the lead from Prost. Jones was set for another race win, but as was becoming a habit that season it was not to be. Jones's Ford-Cosworth began to misfire forcing him into the pits and once again dropping him well out of the points. Jones finished the race, but his championship hopes were beginning to wain as he failed once again to get a points finish.

   In Austria, Jones qualified in sixth position. He would go on to drive an unspectacular race, however would break his five race duck of failing to finish by taking fourth place in the race. Much to his satisfaction, Jones finished one place above Reutemann who was unable to find a way past his teammate throughout the race. In Zandvoort, the Williams cars were competitive and Jones lined up fourth on the grid behind the two Renault's and Piquet's Brabham. In the warm-up, Jones and Reutemann were the fastest cars on track which would go on to reflect their race pace. Jones quickly moved up to second and for the second time that season began an intense duel with Prost's Renault for the lead. Unlike in Hockenheim however, Jones was unable to find a way passed and the continued failure to get passed Prost resulted in his Williams's tyre degradation. Eventually Jones began to fall back, the poor state of his tyres meant that Jones could not defend against Piquet who took second place. Jones went on to take third in the race.

  <p key="b5c01210-4db4-4cdb-a697-44ed98441e97">
   At Monza, Jones qualified in a reasonable fifth position. Jones clawed his way through the field, overtaking Laffite, Piquet and Reutemann ahead of him to move into second place. Prost ahead of him was too quick and Jones could not challenge for the lead, however the Australian went on to take an unchallenged second place. The latter half of the season was proving to finally provide results for Jones who had endured a tough mid-season.

   Ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix, much to everyone's surprise Jones announced he would be retiring from Formula One at the end of the season. Jones like many of his generation had criticised the new ground effect cars that were being run. The cars being uncomfortable to drive as well as being very dangerous had prompted Jones to make the decision to retire from Formula One. Jones still had a slim chance of reclaiming his title, he was third in the championship standings, nine points off Piquet and twelve points off leader Reutemann. In qualifying, Jones was third behind Piquet and Reutemann. He made his characteristic strong start, forcing himself into the lead, banging wheels with Reutemann in the process of heading into turn one. However once again whilst he was leading, Jones spun off the circuit throwing it all away. Jones dropped down the field and then shortly afterwards retired with differential failure. His failure to gain points meant that there was no longer any chance of him reclaiming his title in 1981.

  <p key="a4d9995b-0aed-428e-9a73-4ccc0d2b7ca7">
   The 1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix in Las Vegas was set to be Jones's final race before retirement. His teammate Carlos Reutemann was favourite to take the title, duelling Piquet and Laffite for the title. Jones assured the paddock that Reutemann would not get any assistance from him in the race and Jones would be focussed entirely on himself and doing the best he could in his final race for Williams. In qualifying Reutemann took pole whilst Jones lined up alongside him, second on the grid. In the race Jones took an immediate lead and began to pull away from the start. Reutemann notably fading and dropping down the order. Jones went on to dominate the events, the troubles that plagued him that season seemed non existent as he took a dominant win in Las Vegas. Reutemann meanwhile fell out of the points and remarkably lost the championship to Nelson Piquet. Jones had won the opening and closing rounds of 1981 and the result in Las Vegas secured him third in the championship, a fitting end before Jones returned to Australia to begin his retirement.

   There were a number of factors that contributed to Alan Jones's rather surprising retirement in 1981. Jones was seen at the peak of his career and his retirement came to the paddock and especially his team Williams F1 as an enormous surprise. In 1979, Jones and his wife Beverley had an adoptive son, Christian. Now a father, Jones no longer felt he could adequately raise a son and be a full-time Formula One driver. To further enhance his decision, Jones detested the ground effect cars that were being used in the early 1980s. They were described as being as extremely uncomfortable to drive as well as being extremely dangerous.

   It was only a short time before his announcement of his retirement in Canada, that Jones had informed Williams team leaders Frank Williams and Patrick Head of his impending retirement. Williams and Head who were at a loss at losing what they thought was their ideal driver spent much of the 1982 pre-season attempting to persuade Jones to rethink his decision to retire. Jones however remained adamant that he had made the right decision and a resigned Williams eventually signed

   Jones returned to his homeland in Australia and purchased a farm in rural Victoria to live with his family. Despite his Formula One retirement, Jones remained highly involved in racing and motorsport. In November 1981, for the second year running Jones participated in the Australian Grand Prix. The race held at Calder Park saw the attendance of F1 rivals Nelson Piquet and Jacques Laffite. Also in attendance was
   Roberto Moreno
   a future Formula One star as well as top line Australian race drivers such as
   Larry Perkins
   , Geoff Brabham and Alfredo Costanzo. Jones qualified in second place driving a Ralt, outmatched by the young Brazilian Roberto Moreno. Jones would fail to repeat his 1980 win due to a transmission failure.

   Despite retiring from Formula One, Jones could not give up the racing bug and in 1982 began competing in multiple domestic categories. In this time Jones was able to further prove himself as Australia's top racing driver of the day. Jones competed a full season of the 1982 Australian GT Championship. In this series he went up against other Australian racing icons such as Peter Brock. Jones driving a Porsche 935 Turbo dominated the championship, winning all 16 races of the championship.

  <p key="af4d3055-a86b-46ca-808c-b099cfaa9848">
   Jones also participated in the Australian Endurance Championship driving a Mazda RX-7. Jones participated in the James Hardie 1000 at Bathurst and the Gold Coast 300, retiring on both occasions. Jones also participated in two rounds of the Better Brakes Touring Car Championship. In both rounds, Jones battled Australian touring car legend, Allan Grice for the lead winning one round whilst finishing second to Grice in the other.

   Jones also raced in the final two races of the Australian Drivers' Championship. Jones took second place behind championship winner Alfredo Costanzo. In the final round, it was the Australian Grand Prix at Calder Raceway. Jones was reunited with many of his Formula One colleagues who also attended the race. Jones would compete against Jacques Laffite, Nelson Piquet and Alain Prost in the event. Jones qualified seventh in the event, notably behind his rivals. The crowd was robbed the opportunity to see Jones battle amongst his old rivals when a broken flywheel prevented him from taking the start. Prost would go on to take a dominate win at the event.

   In 1982, Jones considered making a comeback to Formula One with the Ferrari team. Gilles Villeneuve had been killed at Zolder whilst Didier Pironi was seriously injured at Hockenheim. Lacking a top level driver, Ferrari approached Jones to consider making a return to Formula One for the 1982 Italian Grand Prix. Jones was hesitant to sign, he still also begrudged the team for turning his back on his contract with the team for the 1978 season. Jones opted against returning, however would come to regret the move following the strong results of Mario Andretti whom the team had turned to after failing to sign Jones.

   The interest from Ferrari in 1982 had reignited Jones's passion for racing. By 1983 the ground effect cars that had disillusioned Jones in 1981 had been banned, in turn enhancing Jones's interest in Formula One. By the end of 1982, Jones had decided he wanted to re-enter Formula One, however despite conducting testing duties with his old team and friends at Williams in November 1982, the team had already signed drivers for the new season. All the other top teams also had signed drivers, forcing Jones to look at the midfield to make his Formula One return

Oliver agreed to sign Jones for two races, the United States Grand Prix and the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch.

Jones had steel pins inserted into his leg to help the bone heal. He conducted a test with the team at Willow Springs in Los Angeles to confirm his fitness for the race. After a satisfactory performance, Jones made his way to Long Beach in preparation for the race. He qualified in twelfth position, beating his Arrows teammate
   Marc Surer

   Due to a reschedule of the next race at Spa-Francorchamps, Haas Lola were unable to enter the event due its original schedule earlier in the season which forced the team to miss out. Instead the team spend time, testing and preparing for the next event at Brands Hatch for the European Grand Prix. Jones and Lola make some small progress as Jones finds himself advancing up to 22nd on the grid. It would be another short event for Jones who retired on the 13th lap with radiator problems.

For the first time in history, the Australian Grand Prix would become apart of the Formula One World Championship.

   Following the Brazilian race there were questions about whether Jones still had the fitness and energy to compete in Formula One due to him being relatively off the pace in comparison to Tambay despite more time in the car.

The THL2 chassis would be raced for the first time, the team being rid of the troublesome Hart engines and being powered by the first turbo charged Ford Cosworth engine. Jones was the only one entrusted to the THL2, Tambay would still be in the old THL1 chassis until the next round in Monaco. It was a massive disappointment when Jones only managed 21st on the grid. Tambay on the other hand had given the THL1 its best qualifying performance with eleventh on the grid. Tambay retired early on, Jones on the other hand managed to continue on for 28 laps before overheating issues forced him into retirement.

At Spa-Francorchamps for the Belgian race, Jones seemed to fair a little better by qualifying in 16th. He still remained off the pace to Tambay who was in tenth. After a first lap collision which saw the elimination of Tambay from the race, Jones was able to benefit by climbing up to seventh position. For the first time since his comeback, Jones was looking competitive. Whilst his Lola did not have the pace of his rivals, Jones was running well on the race. On the seventh lap, he spun dropping him well down the order. However Jones had relatively strong pace and was able to climb to as high as sixth before having to pit.

   In Spa, Jones seemed to have finally found his rhythm once again. The next round at Montreal in Canada saw him outqualify Tambay by one place, landing his car in thirteenth position. Tambay would however not start the race due to a suspension failure that pitched him into the barrier where he sustained leg injuries preventing him from taking the race start. Jones ran another solid race in the midfield. However he was once again criticized for holding up the leaders when he once again got in the way of the lead battle, holding up Nigel Mansell once again and the second place man of Keke Rosberg. With most of Jones's main rivals in the midfield retiring, he went on to take his first race finish since his comeback with a tenth place finish, albeit three laps down on the leaders.

Jones's race ended after two laps when he crashed into the barriers. Tambay seemed on course for points at his home race before a brake failure occured. So far this season, the Lola team had only scored two finishes, one apiece for Jones and Tambay and no championship points. This was unsettling low for team owner Carl Haas who was expecting to be fighting for victories by now.

Jones once again seemed to perform well, getting himself within the top ten at the start and seemingly be able to hold pace with the leaders. Thanks to retirements, Jones found himself in seventh position and was chasing René Arnoux's Ligier for the final points place when the throttle began to die and he dropped back. On the 22nd lap, Jones pulled out of the race. Jones was visibly angered by the result and his frustration at Haas Lola was beginning to show, considering the team had promised that they would be winning races by now when he joined them. Tambay also had a chance for points before his car let him down. It had been a rather downtrodden week for the Haas Lola outfit.

Despite Lola's terrible reliability record, both cars remarkably were able to keep going. Jones and Tambay found themselves in fourth and fifth place. The two cars despite being two laps down went on to take double points finishes with both driver's scoring the team's first points together.

Like many, Beatrice, had expected to be winning races at this point not fighting for the minor points placings. With the loss of Beatrice's sponsorship, Haas Lola was in financial chaos and their involvement in 1987 was now questionable. Jones and Tambay who had both had a difficult relationship team had both resolved to like, Beatrice, leave the team at the end of the year. Jones resolving that if he could not find a top level drive at Williams, McLaren or Ferrari then he would retire again from Formula One. Racing for the minor teams had simply became too frustrating.

   The final race of the season was held at Jones's home race in Australia at the Adelaide circuit. Jones entered the race knowing that this was likely to be his last grand prix. The race seemed likely to be Jones's last in Formula One. Having already committed to leaving the failed Haas Lola project, Jones had fallen out of the market for F1's top teams who were now looking at younger talent. The race at Adelaide seemed to be a fitting place to conclude Jones's F1 career.

   Without the opportunity to gain a competitive race drive for 1987, Jones made his final retirement from Formula One at the end of 1986 with the Haas Lola team. Jones however remained interested in racing if he could find a top drive in another reputable category. Jones decided to compete in a season of Japanese GT Endurance Racing. Jones joined the Toyota Team TOM's racing a Toyota where he would race three rounds of the Japanese Endurance Championship and two rounds of the World Endurance Championship with former F1 pilot,

In both races, Jones and Lee's Toyota 87C provided to be stern rivals to the leading cars at Porsche. The duo crashed out for the Fuji 500 marking the end of the duo's tenure in Japanese Endurance racing. TOM's Toyota then sent the duo to participate in two rounds of the World Endurance Championship. Jones would partake in his second 24 Hours of Le Mans, following on from 1984. However Jones and Lees entrance with TOM's Toyota into the world endurance series was less successful. The duo retired at Le Mans early on whilst despite hopes of doing well at the team's home track at Fuji Speedway, Jones and Lees had a similarily early retirement in the race.

   Despite a season racing for TOM's Toyota which wielded two podiums and a race win, Jones was not content to continue racing in the series. Jones had a frustrating relationship with the Japanese team management. The culture clash between the two made it very difficult for the two to work together. The Japanese engineers at Toyota had a poor understanding of the English language which made it difficult for Jones to communicate with. The frustrating relationship saw Jones announce his departure from the team and Japanese motor racing after only one season.

   For 1988, Jones returned to domestic racing within Australia. As he had done three years earlier, Jones partnered touring car veteran, Colin Bond in racing for the Caltex team. The duo competed in a Ford Sierra RS500 in Australia's major endurance races. The Ford Sierra often proved to be unreliable, although Jones and Bond enjoyed success in taking a fourth place finish at New Zealand's Wellington 500. While preparing for the renowned Bathurst 500, Tom Walkinshaw running for the rival Holden team protested that all the Ford Sierra entries were illegal. Despite racing under the threat of disqualification, Jones and Bond put in a great performance to finish third in the race. The duo therefore ending the season on a high.

Moving to Tony Longhurst Racing, Jones was hoping for some strong results at the team that had proved the most successful in the previous season. Jones would race alongside Tony Longhurst himself who had won the previous year at Bathurst. However most notably, also joining them in the car was another former Formula One world champion,

   The following year in 1990, Jones returned to a more active participation in motorsport. Jones continued on with Tony Longhurst racing, participating in events in both endurance racing as well as signing for a full season in the touring car championship. The two Ford Sierra's of Jones and Longhurst struggled in the ATCC, competing only in the midfield. Jones however did have a highlight at Winton Raceway when Jones and Longhurst battled championship leader and eventual winner, Jim Richards, for the lead of the race. Richards went on to win with Longhurst and Jones second and third. Jones had another highlight by finishing fourth at the Adelaide Street Circuit, a race notably supporting the
   1990 Australian Grand Prix

   After a difficult 1990 campaign, Tony Longhurst disgarded the Ford Sierra and instead upgraded his team to using BMW M3's for the 1991 season. Both Jones and Longhurst were among the quickest cars that season, however the Nissan cars driven by Jim Richards and Mark Scaife continued to reign supreme in the championship. Despite a difficult start to the season which saw Jones off the pace in comparison to Longhurst, he was able to round the season off with a strong finish. Jones finished second to teammate Longhurst in the penultimate round at Lakeside and then at the final round at Oran Park, Jones took another second place finishing behind Skaife's Nissan. Jones finished fourth in the championship, but some way down on the top three of Richards, Skaife and teammate Tony Longhurst who took two wins for the team that year. There was better fortunes at the Sandown 500 when Jones and teammate Peter Fitzgerald finished in second place. Bathurst was a disappointment with Jones and Longhurst both retiring from the race.

  <p key="bab676c0-b804-4d3a-8e89-f922c0b55bbe">
   1991 had shown potential for the Longhurst team, the duo of Longhurst and Jones continued on with their BMW M3's for 1992, however once again the Nissan's of Skaife and Richards proved too quick and this year the Ford's had began to challenge BMW for the second best manufacturer. Jones endured a difficult season where he struggled in the midfield. In contrast, teammate Longhurst was one of the few cars to be able to challenge the Nissan's that year. Longhurst finished the season in third with a win and three other podiums. Jones could only manage seventh in the standings and only a single third place at the final round at Oran Park. After four seasons at Tony Longhurst Racing, Jones defected to the Ford team who were enjoying success with their new Ford Falcon. Now racing at Peter Jackson Racing, Jones partnered up and coming talent Glenn Seton for the endurance races. Neither Sandown or Bathurst proved a success in which the duo retired in both races. Bathurst sadly saw the death of Jones's friend and fellow Formula One champion, Denny Hulme, who suffered a heart attack whilst in his car.

   With the withdrawal of the superior Nissan's for 1993, Jones and teammate Seton had a strong chance for the title in 1993. The BMW M3 was believed to have the edge over its rivals at Holden, Ford and Toyota. As predicted, the BMW's had the immediate advantage and Jones and Seton immediately became the immediate favourites for the title. At the second round of the championship at Symmons Plains Raceway, Jones finally took his first win in Australian touring cars. Two races later, Jones rounded this out with a second win at Phillip Island. Despite the occasional challenge from John Bowe's Ford Falcon, the two BMW's of Seton and Jones were undoubtedly the quickest cars that year. Despite two wins and two third places for Jones that year, teammate Seton dominated the championship that year. The now 47 year old Alan Jones no longer had the outright pace to compete with his much younger teammate in Seton. For the endurance races, the team reverted back to Ford Falcon's as the BMW's were to be only entered by the works entry. Sandown and Bathurst yielded little reward for the duo of Jones and Seton who retired in both races.

   For 1994, BMW withdrew from the ATCC forcing Peter Jackson Racing to return to racing with Ford Falcon's. The only manufacturers participating that year were the Holden's and Ford's predicting a much closer championship. Jones proved inconsistent in his performances that year, whilst Glenn Seton was to finish runner up to eventual championship winner Mark Skaife, Jones struggled to match his younger teammate's performances. Although there was a comeback from Jones at the end of the season where he took three podiums before taking a race win at the penultimate round at Barbagello Raceway. Nonetheless Jones could only manage fifth in the championship and there was little success at Sandown and Bathurst where Jones once again retired from both events.

   Now competing in his third full season at Peter Jackson Racing, Jones hoped to improve his fortunes in 1995 following a mediocre 1994. However it would be another difficult season for Jones who continued to be outmatched by teammate Glenn Seton. Whilst Seton was once again fighting for the championship, Jones was struggling in the midfield. Jones managed to take two third place finishes, these proved to be the highlights in a difficult season which saw Seton finish second in the championship with four wins. There were now questions about whether the now 49 year old Jones still had what it took to continue competing among the best Australian touring car racers. Jones responded to suggestions that he was too old for racing by taking a second place at Bathurst, Jones and teammate touring car legend, Allan Grice, who at 53 and 49 years of age were keen to prove they still had the pace.

  <p key="2a156b77-04a7-41a9-bcf2-7ce4634cbacd">
   Nonetheless Jones had been dropped by Peter Jackson after a relatively poor 1995 season. Despite being now 50 years old, Jones remained enthusiastic for racing in the ATCC however found that no team was willing to hire him for a full season in the sport. So instead he opted to form his own ATCC team. With sponsorship from Phillip Morris and hiring brothers Jim and Ross Stone from the highly successful Dick Johnson Racing Team, Alan Jones Racing was formed for the 1996 season racing Ford Falcon's. Jones and his small team had quite a successful entry into the 1996 ATCC season. Despite being considered out of the driver market by the other teams, Jones regularly finished in the points as well as taking two second places at Lakeside and Mallala Park. Jones partnered up with Allan Grice once again for Bathurst, however their race ended when Jones's Ford burst into flames.

  <p key="f5031b08-47ce-4e07-8797-38bb07261044">
   Due to the Australian government banning tobacco sponsorship at sporting events, Jones lost his Phillip Morris backing in 1997. It would be a difficult season for Jones, the loss of his sponsorship had severely affected the team's financial capability and as a result the team failed to continue to be competitive. There was positives in which Jones managed to score in every single event, nonetheless this was only the minor points placings and he not once achieved the podium. However it would prove to be a good end to the season when Jones partnered with young talent Jason Bright to take third place at the Sandown 500. For Bathurst, Jones for the first time would partner up again with the Williams team since 1981. Williams had expanded its operations beyond Formula One and into the British Touring Car Championship. For 1997, Williams decided to enter Bathurst partnering Jones, the driver who brought them their first championship success in 1980. Jones racing a Renault Laguna hoped for success upon his reunion with Williams, however unfortunately the Renault broke down early on in the race despite a sixth qualifying position.

  <p key="b4825dae-8cc3-45be-b8e4-2dd94c27affd">
   At the end of 1997, Jones was forced to sell his share of the Alan Jones Racing team to the Stone brothers due to financial difficulty. Now at the twilight of his racing career, Jones seemed content to retire for 1998 until he was handed a lifeline by old friend and former employer Tony Longhurst. Jones rejoined the Longhurst racing team for the first time since 1992, however like his previous outing at Longhurst Racing, team boss and teammate Tony Longhurst consistently outmatched Jones. Jones struggled throughout the season in the lower midfield and went on to finish a lowly 16th in the championship in comparison to Longhurst's sixth. Jones sadly did not have the financial backing to perform in the endurance races such as Sandown or Bathurst.
  </p>
  <p key="1fa04e9a-1fa5-48e7-80a7-26832a3b5468">
   By 1999, Jones no longer had the financial capability to continue racing in the ATCC, which had now been renamed the V8 Supercar championship. Therefore Jones began to fade quietly into retirement. He continued to race where he could, the only events he participated in that year were the endurance races of the Queensland 500 and the Bathurst 1000. Racing for the lowly Paul Little Racing, Jones finished 17th at the Queensland 500 whilst failing to finish at Bathurst.
  </p>
  <p key="b2b6183d-5847-4808-a123-b368041492dc">
   As in the previous year, Jones only raced in two events for 2000. Jones once again joining Paul Little Racing for the endurance races at the Queensland 500 and Bathurst 1000. Unfortunately for Jones he was set to retire in both events after performing near the back of the grid.
  </p>
  <p key="fa7afad5-5caa-49cb-bd34-5834a7f7f456">
   In 2001, Jones again racing for Paul Little made entrants into the Queensland 500 and Bathurst 1000 once again. Jones managed to finish both events unlike his previous attempts with the Paul Little team. Jones finished 17th at the Queensland 500 whilst at Bathurst he was 15th.
  </p>
  <p key="f21209ed-1a87-4029-929d-d7dca69cb23b">
   2002 marked Jones's final season in any form of motorsport. Announcing his final retirement, Jones signed for the respected Dick Johnson Racing team in order to complete his motorsport career in the best way possible. It would prove to be a good send off to Jones's racing career in the Queensland 500, Jones finished the race in seventh position. Whilst his final event at Bathurst, Jones completed his career with a fifth place after regularly competing with the front years.

   . The GPM was a newly founded series that invited ex-Formula One drivers over the age of 45 to compete in the series. Jones was set to compete in the series among many of his former Formula One rivals. Former F1 racer
   Christian Danner
   questioned whether some drivers in particular the 59 year old Jones and his former teammate Patrick Tambay's ability to compete in the series due to their overall lack of fitness. Jones angrily responded by saying 'the closest he has been to a podium is when he passed it on the way to the lavatory'.

  <p key="82152426-f653-4dd4-83a9-bbacdef6a7df">
   Whilst at qualifying for the first race in Kyalami, Jones was notably ten seconds off the pole time set by Nigel Mansell. As a result of this, Jones opted to pull out of the event as well as having severe neck pains. Instead for the two races at Qatar and Silverstone in 2006, Jones served as a commentator for the races alongside commentary legend Murray Walker. The series folded in 2007, ending his commentary duties.
