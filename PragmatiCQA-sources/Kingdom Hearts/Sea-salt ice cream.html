   Axel treated Roxas to sea-salt ice cream on the Twilight Town Clock Tower, saying it was "icing on the cake", after Roxas completed his first mission and reminding him they sat there the first day Roxas came into existence and received his name. He then suggested that he and Roxas should meet each other to eat ice cream every day after they completed their missions, stating going back and forth to the

   . Soon Roxas, Axel, and Xion began eating ice cream together after their missions once Axel had returned alive out of all the other members that were slain in
   Castle Oblivion
   . As Roxas explained to Xion, sea-salt ice cream is Axel's favorite flavor.

  <p key="51d8d0f4-2927-4893-8837-a907f25b3358">
   During a day in the game, named "Vacation", Roxas had no idea on what to do as Saïx had scheduled a break between missions to give the Organization members some rest time. After rejecting Xion's offer of practicing with the Keyblade, he once again looked at the notice posted in the Grey Room. While looking at the notice that said "Operations Closed for Vacation", Roxas thought, "What to do? What to do?".
  </p>
  <p key="65b7577b-d1c7-41f5-89d0-c053eb5baf7b">
   Then he concluded the scenario saying the word "Ice cream" and ended up sharing ice cream with his friends, even mocking Axel for sleeping the entire day when Xion asked what they did. This perhaps shows that Roxas had learned to like ice cream ever since Axel had given him his first one.
  </p>
  <p key="5e74970b-d746-4338-bb89-3427364ee08b">
   It is revealed in the game that some ice cream sticks have the word "WINNER" on it. This allows the owner to exchange it for a free ice cream bar. Axel first notifies Roxas of this on one of their later meetings, after Roxas found a WINNER stick, but kept it secret as he wished to have two WINNERs for both Axel and Xion. He later bestows the stick to Axel as a farewell gift when he leaves Organization XIII.

   It also acts as a symbol of the friendship between the three of them, most noticeably is when Roxas asks Xion who else he would eat ice cream with when he regained his memories of her through the trauma of her dying.

   Riku left a sea-salt ice cream with a picture of Roxas and the gang from the Simulated Twilight Town as clues for Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Donald took an immediate liking to the ice-cream, and Sora is quoted in his second visit to Twilight Town saying "Donald ate it up". Donald later references the ice cream himself, exclaiming "I'm sorry about the ice cream!" after Goofy is hit, almost fatally, by a boulder.
