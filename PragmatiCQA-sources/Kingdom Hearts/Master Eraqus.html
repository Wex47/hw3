   Master Eraqus is a strong Keyblade master, caring for Terra, Ventus, and Aqua as his own children. Stern and willing to instruct, one major goal he has in life appears to be preserving peace throughout the worlds, as he rashly attacks Ventus when Eraqus discovers that through his dark half, Vanitas, Ventus can create the
   χ-blade
   , the weapon that sparked the Keyblade War and the means Master Xehanort intends to use to fulfill his goals. Unlike Master Xehanort, Eraqus has an open aversion to darkness, believing that it must be destroyed at all costs, and has at least partially ingrained these beliefs into his apprentices.
  </p>
  <p key="029804f5-9c9f-4af4-902a-97c2d15dbb26">
   Despite his sometimes cold actions toward his apprentices, he still cares deeply for them. He has Aqua look after Terra as he travels the worlds because he is concerned for him, apologizes to Ventus and appears deeply pained before he attempts to attack the boy, and sheds a tear when he is forced to face off against Terra. Despite his relationship with Xehanort having been strained over the years, Eraqus seems to attempt to overlook his former friend's past actions to a degree. Even after he and Xehanort have a fight that results in Eraqus being scarred, he still asks Xehanort to watch over the Mark of Mastery with him. Even despite Xehanort having ruthlessly killed him, Eraqus retained his fondness for his old friend, as his spirit appeared in the end to reason with Xehanort successfully, which allowed his fallen friend to redeem himself, and as Xehanort started to collapse, Eraqus happily offered to help him ascend, showing no malice for Xehanort's part in his death. He also apologized for his actions to his students and showed regret for how strict he mentored them. It was noted by Xehanort, himself a consummate manipulator and strategist, that Eraqus was highly cunning, which is why his heart resided inside Terra to help him resist and also to later appear to aid one last time.

   Master Eraqus, like his student, Terra, bears a distinct Japanese influence in his choice of clothing. He wears a white, red lined haori that has a hood, along with slightly shorter than normal, light-colored hakama. Underneath his haori, he wears a navy blue shirt with a large white X pattern on the front. He also has jagged scars over his right eye and left cheek inflicted by

   , much like the wounds Braig received from Terra.

  <p key="8bdbbd20-7804-4569-89c1-7a4374bad619">
   Like his pupils, Eraqus wears pieces of armor, in his case gold and black armored boots and a dull blue-green section that covers his abdomen. This second piece of armor sports the same symbol worn by his students near the top. Eraqus's black hair is tied into a short, high topknot, with one bang falling off to the right side of his face. He also has a short, triangular
   soul patch
   and a mustache. Eraqus's Keyblade Armor greatly resembles
   samurai
   armor, fitting in with his Japanese theme.

   Years later, Eraqus was reunited with his friend before learning of Xehanort's intent to recreate the
   χ-blade
   , the legendary weapon from which the Keyblades were modeled after and which is capable of unlocking Kingdom Hearts, by causing another

   with Ventus and Xehanort as witnesses. The exam is carried out soon afterwards, with Aqua passing while Terra fails, Eraqus believing that Terra is unqualified on the grounds that he is unable to control his darkness yet personally feels that Terra has potential. Little does Eraqus know that Master Xehanort had used his dark powers to tamper with the course of the Exam itself.

Sensing a possible connection between the two events, once Terra is out of view, Eraqus instructs Aqua to look after Terra to make sure he is not tempted by the darkness. However, after Terra departs, Aqua and Eraqus witness Ventus leaving as well, and he instructs Aqua to bring Ventus back.

However, Xehanort expected the reaction and arranged for Terra to come to Ventus's aid. When Terra refuses to step aside, seeing that he has embraced his darkness, Eraqus attempts to kill Terra as well. After sending Ventus to the

A shocked Xehanort could only watch as Eraqus' heart emerged from Terra's, materializing into an apparition of himself. Eraqus demands Xehanort to hand over the χ-blade, though the latter refuses, saying that it was too late; Eraqus however explained that it was for them, but not for the guardians of light. Though Xehanort remained persistent, Eraqus places his hand on Xehanort's shoulder, claiming that it was "checkmate".

While this happened, Eraqus shares a final moment with his three pupils, apologizing for the trauma he put them in before placing Terra in charge of the other two. As Xehanort began to die from his wounds, he is caught by Eraqus, and together the two ascend into the afterlife while taking on their childhood forms.

   Although old and having rarely fought in his later days, Eraqus remains an accomplished Keyblade Master and magic user. His fighting prowess was enough in his older age that Terra is only able to defeat him using the power of darkness, being pushed back by his master's relentless assault. His melee style relies on many quick lunging attacks and is able to land many hits before the combo finisher. He can also warp quickly and unleash a devastating 3-hit combo. He is highly skillful in the manipulation of light, capable of coating himself in light and unleashing pillars and blades of light as well as firing shots of light energy, and is proficient enough in fire-related magic to create gigantic pillars of flame.
