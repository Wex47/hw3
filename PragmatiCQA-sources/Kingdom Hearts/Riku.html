However, as the story progresses, Riku realizes that it is possible to use the darkness to achieve his goals.

This obsession appears to have diminished throughout the year of Sora's slumber, most likely because he had by then travelled to a number of worlds. When he returns to Destiny Islands in

The machine then explodes, unable to handle Kingdom Hearts, sending Ansem the Wise to the Realm of Darkness while causing countless hearts Xemnas had collected into Kingdom Hearts to rain down on the world, creating a slew of Heartless. The explosion also cleanses Riku's heart and restores Riku to his original form, though he is still remorseful.

They discuss Xehanort's plans, realizing that when Aqua saved Terra, he was possessed by Xehanort.

With no new leads, Riku and Mickey travel back to the Dark Margin. Attacked again by a Demon Tower, Mickey is disarmed and trapped within it. Anti-Aqua reveals herself and takes his Keyblade, planning to use it to the escape. Riku declines his replica's offer to return his Keyblade, facing Aqua and the Heartless.

When Sora frees all of his friends' hearts, they reappear together, moments before Terra-Xehanort first appeared.

As Ansem fades away, he speaks to Riku, reminiscing on the journey they shared.

The other guardians arrive as the spell wears off, and Riku presents the idea of using Xehanort as a portal and trapping him in it long enough to finish him. Sora, Donald, and Goofy volunteer to go instead, so that the other Keyblade wielders could hold back the power of Kingdom Hearts. Once Xehanort is defeated, Riku and the others follow their hearts to Sora. They lend their power to Sora as he uses the χ-blade to seal Kingdom Hearts away. Returning to the Keyblade Graveyard, Sora decides to use the power of waking to rescue Kairi. Though Mickey tries to argue, Riku convinces him to let Sora follow his heart.
