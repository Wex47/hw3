   Hercules is shown to be sturdy, yet sensitive, willing to withstand hours of intense training at the hands of his mentor, Phil. He has a genuine love for Megara, and is ready to sacrifice even his own life for her. And yet, he is not without fault, as insults from Hades and a series of tough matches, including a loss to the Hydra, cause the hero to doubt his worth. It's when his friends' lives are most in danger that Hercules realizes he's not worthless, and that, in his words, "A true hero is measured by the strength of his heart."

   Extremely muscular, with broad shoulders and a comparatively thin waist, Hercules is always seen wearing orange-brown armor that ends in a sort of metal skirt. His armor does not extend to his arms, nor to most of his legs. He wears a brown belt around his waist with a gold emblem with the symbol of Zeus printed on it. Hercules's sandals are knee-high and have cross-shaped straps and are brown, as are two wristbands he also wears. He has a reddish-brown headband tied around his forehead, pushing back his rust-colored hair, save for one bang that falls over it. The only aspects of Hercules's appearance not colored in earth tones are his sky blue eyes and short, deep blue cape. He is occasionally seen with a simple sword with a brown handle and yellow cross-guard, but apparently prefers to fight barehanded.

   , a much younger Hercules is seen prior to becoming a hero. His appearance is like in Hercules The Animated Series. At this point in his life, Hercules was rather scrawny and far from muscular. His sandals were not knee-high like his current self's, and he wore a plain white toga that left most of his legs, his arms, and the right side of his chest exposed. There was a metal pendant engraved with Zeus's symbol that was attached to the strap on his left shoulder. His headband and wristbands were also absent. His hair was a bit longer as well, being just about shoulder-length and seemed to be a brighter shade of orange than it is now.

After all four Titans return, Hercules decides to even the odds by freeing Zeus from his prison, which causes the Titans to flee. Hercules then grabs the Tornado Titan's tail and scoops up the other three Titans, releasing them into space where they are destroyed in an explosion. After chasing Hades away, Hercules decides to stay in the human realm because of his love for Megara, claiming a life without her would be empty.

   A demigod and son of the sky god Zeus, Hercules is known as "Heracles" (Ηρακλής) in ancient Greek mythology. He still possesses his great strength, seen in the Disney adaption of the "character," yet several plots seen in this version of Hercules do not remain present in the realm of myths. One similarity is that both are considered a hero in their own right, battling a series of monsters. Mythology has a much more diverse love life, no rivalry with Hades or affiliation with Phil, and no goal to regain his "god" status. Myth also depicts the hero as a man wielding a club rather than a sword, carrying a lion's pelt as his only source of clothing.

   In the Disney film by the same name as this hero, Hercules was kidnapped as an infant from his home on Mount Olympus and turned mortal by Pain and Panic. Growing up a strong, teased and misunderstood teenager with mortal adopted parents, Herc left home to seek out his true identity. A conversation with his father Zeus told him to seek out Philoctetes, trainer of heroes, and learn to be a "true hero" so he could reclaim godship. Hercules arose to fame, and eventually found love in Megara. It was a love for this woman that allowed Hercules to become a "true hero" when he risked his life for hers.
