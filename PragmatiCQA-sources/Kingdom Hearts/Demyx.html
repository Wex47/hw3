    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="913eb40f-1042-4c00-9ab3-2fc51056a7fe">
   Demyx, unlike the other Organization members, has a very casual, cowardly, and lazy personality—though this may simply be an act since Nobodies are normally free of all emotion and thus cannot feel fear (though it is known that higher nobodies start to form hearts of their own, given enough time). He runs from many encounters, including ones with Hades and Sora, and in
   <i key="3ba95485-8e6b-44d6-8aa1-15204c795906">
    Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days
   </i>
   , he refuses to go searching for a giant Heartless alone. Along with Xigbar, Axel, and Larxene, Demyx is portrayed as one of the more comical members of the Organization, although unlike the other three, who earned their places in that list as a result of their sarcasm and wisecracks, Demyx holds this role because of his laziness.
  </p>
  <p key="3ab9faa1-1b0a-458b-b18f-a50863e02c42">
   Despite his laid-back personality and his tendency to sit around, Demyx seems to be on good terms with both Axel and Xigbar, calling Xigbar, "Xiggy" and is often shown talking to him in the Grey Area, and though Axel and Roxas talk about him behind his back, Axel does defend him after Roxas comments that Demyx doesn't do anything, Axel stating that Demyx specializes in recon.
  </p>
  <p key="7209e722-09d9-4811-ac4f-b3a99e077123">
   Demyx seems to dislike working as much as he dislikes fighting; he even goes so far as to manipulate Roxas, dumping his missions on the younger Nobody and going off to have fun. He complains about how he "isn't cut out for combat" and also considers sweat "gross". Often, he wishes that

   would not make him fight and says that he'd prefer to stay at The Castle That Never Was or at least be given a recon mission.
  </p>
  <p key="6c4e4439-a920-4ea1-9401-326f2b4be164">
   He also seems to dislike Larxene intensely, calling her a witch, though the feeling is apparently mutual as she has referred to him as lazy and useless. When news gets back from Castle Oblivion, he seems to be glad that she has died, showing that even he can be a bit cruel and crass without a heart. He also seems to dislike Saïx, calling him "X-face" in one of his
   Secret Reports
   , saying that Saïx constantly barks at him to get to work. However, he does show some care toward Xion, unlike many of the other members, thus demonstrating that he does have a kind side, although he thought it was "intense" when he found out that Xion was a "puppet".
  </p>
  <p key="d2319ee0-a5a5-4143-9d56-08347c664445">
   Demyx is much less serious and more carefree than the other Organization members, as well as selfish, and seems to take his task of pursuing Sora lightly. He doesn't hesitate to read his orders aloud off of cue cards in front of Sora nor does he hesitate to complain about his distaste for fighting. His cries in battle after being hit are also more characteristic of "yelps" than those of the other members, and are exclamations rather than reactions. In his final battle against Sora however, he displays a side previously unseen, fighting Sora with a ferocity and wildness most unlike his 'usual' character. Yet when he is defeated, he lets out a cry of despair and disbelief, holding his head, and whimpering as he fades back into darkness.

   , he retains his laziness, acknowledging that he is not nearly as motivated as the other members. He also appears to be bitter about his demotion to a reserve member after

   Demyx wears a black cloak similar in style to Xigbar's, with somewhat closer-fitting sleeves and pointed shoulder pads, though Demyx's shoulder pads are more noticeable than Xigbar's. His black gloves and boots are mostly similar to that worn by other members. He has cyan eyes and dirty-blond hair, the latter of which is quite distinctive due to its shape. Demyx's hair has an odd mullet-like style, and he has several individual bangs that fall over his face. He is rather youthful in appearance when compared to many of the other members.
Demyx is also somewhat similar to

Demyx soon departs through another dark corridor with the replica in hand, and brings it back to Radiant Garden for Ienzo to bring back Naminé. Afterwards, Demyx's current status becomes unknown.

   Demyx is portrayed as being weak, cowardly, and lazy, but proves to be no pushover in the battle with Sora. Most players have trouble defeating him due to his ability to summon water clones in a time limit to defeat all of them. Demyx, being a musician, uses music to control the water around him and to summon "water forms", objects shaped out of water into musical instruments or copies of himself, which move about the battle area to hit Sora, forcing him to defeat the forms in a certain amount of time to avoid an automatic loss. He can also summon violent geysers that erupt from the ground, forming strong streams of water which damage Sora and throw him into the air. His sitar is rarely used as a weapon, but most often used to play his music instead. However, Demyx does use one move using his Sitar as a weapon, but it does little damage to Sora. Demyx does little fighting by himself, instead relying on his control of water to make it fight for him.

   , Demyx has a Limit Break called Wave Gigs. During Wave Gigs, the player must press and time the attack button in specific "beats" as Demyx jams out on his sitar, summoning up large pillars of water to rise and strike enemies. The more efficiently the button inputs are performed, the faster and more plentiful the attack will be. Enemies that are hit by the pillars take water damage. Meanwhile, Demyx's movement speed is reduced to a slow march, allowing him to slowly advance on an enemy as he attacks, but not much else. His falling is also slowed.

   During Demyx's Final Limit, Demyx releases a large ball of water while jamming out on his sitar. The ball creates a watery explosion that knocks enemies back and deals water damage.

   With it, he can cause water to take the form of people and musical notes, making them "dance" to his music. Although not very useful in battle itself, it can cause some damage if swung at an enemy. He mostly uses its strings to control water and make it fight for him.
