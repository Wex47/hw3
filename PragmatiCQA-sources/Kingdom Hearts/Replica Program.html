  <p key="2df197db-b89f-4044-8914-69975baf431e">
   The Riku Replica was created by Vexen. The purpose of this creation is outlined during the scene in which Vexen discusses with Zexion and Lexaeus as to a method for effectively combating the threat presented by the top floor members of the Organization.
  </p>
  <p key="78488bf1-2bef-44c8-933d-391ff2e98fd2">
   To create the Riku Replica, Vexen antagonized the real Riku enough to force the boy into a battle with him. During this battle, Vexen was able to gather the data needed from Riku to be able to create a replica of him. Vexen used this replica to fight first Riku, and later Sora inside Castle Oblivion's hallways.
  </p>
  <p key="64c6feb5-3f23-4188-8c8f-56e8be15e354">
   The Riku Replica was cursed by the fact that he was a fake, only a copy of someone else, and so fought enthusiastically to destroy Riku, and so claim his own identity. He was later given the same memories as the real Riku, as part of a plan to test Sora.

   were both important to the effectiveness of this plan, as it was Larxene who restrained the replica when he attempted to resist his fate.
  </p>
  <p key="48e4e7dd-afac-49a5-89a2-26b379848a25">
   Though he fought valiantly against Sora, all in the name of defending Naminé, the Riku Replica once again learned the truth that he was, in fact, only an imitation.
  </p>
  <p key="0f4db20c-2b61-4272-b1e1-a617ba02325f">
   He was later used by Axel to bring about a weakened Zexion's death in the false thought that by taking the Nobody's life force, he could become his own person. He met his demise by Riku's hand shortly after coming to terms with him, and was swallowed by the darkness after being defeated.
  </p>
  <p key="9c654136-bf5c-439d-8115-1bf6eb5c0846">
   However, instead of perishing, the Riku Replica's heart ended up in the
   <a href="Realm of Darkness.html" key="41adaa1d-1d30-4c3f-b6c3-686699b431a5" title="Realm of Darkness">

   . Joining with Riku's heart, the replica remained by his side until the Keyblade War, where he forced the heart of
   Dark Riku
   out his refined replica body, wishing for it to be used to save Naminé before fading away with his time-traveling past self.

  <p key="c09eceda-48b9-41cd-81be-2b71b9ea3806">
   Xion was created by Vexen from Sora's fragmented memories. Her holding of these memories caused Sora to be unable to awaken from his slumber after the events of

   are concluded. Xion, having being created from Sora's memories, was able to wield a Keyblade.
  </p>
  <p key="79533ffb-536b-4ba5-8a43-133fc2a81dcf">
   This quality was something which
   Organization XIII
   had dire need of. A consequence of Xion's existence was that Organization XIII now had within their ranks two members who would somewhat willingly collect hearts for the goal of completing Kingdom Hearts. Xion was, however, never considered as an official member of the Organization, as she never held a seat in
   Where Nothing Gathers
   .
  </p>
  <p key="d33aa570-3489-4cca-87e0-9e2a3c4b95d4">
   She was seen by some as being merely a puppet, with only Roxas and Axel referring to her as a friend, and treating her as they would any other member. Her appearance varied depending on who saw her. For example,
   Saïx
   is a prime example of one who saw her as being only a puppet.

   , and both Roxas and Axel saw her as herself, and Xemnas saw her as she truly was, an imperfect copy of Sora. She was eventually destroyed and reabsorbed by Roxas, and the Replica Program was stopped shortly after her defeat. It should be noted that in the scene before Roxas fought her in
   Twilight Town
   , he also saw her as Sora, though his impression of her reverted to being what it had previously been, immediately after the battle.

  <p key="898b5593-13b3-40dc-965a-6c64fb2d65a6">
   In order to fill out the last remaining spot of the real Organization's lineup, Xion is recreated using records found within Vexen's research and the last refined replica of the first two batches of the Replica Program. Initially serving the Organization without question, she soon defected to the guardians of light after being restored with her past memories and reunited with Roxas and

  <p key="a421ba44-3f12-40a7-976a-cafeff632680">
   Six of the replicas were updated to act as vessels for the hearts of the five time-traveling Organization members, as well as Xion's recreation, while the remaining twelve were refined into replicas of all of the real Organization members apart from Master Xehanort, which would be used as replacements for their ranks if the need arose.
