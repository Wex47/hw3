  <p key="51b67226-4d81-45c8-a983-dfeccc1231ae">
   Upon accessing a portal, the player will be brought to a white and blue digital arena as the selected member will be digitally recreated before them. Each Organization data recreation is significantly stronger than the original, possessing new powerful moves and boasting higher health. Additionally, each member has their own unique battle theme that plays during the battle, some of which are the same track but remixed in a manner that reflects its respective member‚Äôs personality. Upon defeating a data Organization member for the first time, they will relinquish a special item; however, no items will be rewarded on any subsequent rematch.
