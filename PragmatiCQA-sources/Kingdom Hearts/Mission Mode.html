   Right from when a player accesses the main menu, they have the option of playing either the main game, Story Mode, or the multi-playing Mission Mode. After the player selects the "Mission Mode" option, they are taken to the Character Selection Screen. They are given a chance to view the average stats of the character they choose, just before being taken to the Menu Screen. The player only has access to Organization XIII to begin with, later gaining access to new characters as they play through Story Mode.

  <p key="5bbcf00b-c4c5-45ef-a0a4-b84ec49d95d1">
   At the Panel Customization Screen, players have the ability to select weapons, items, spells, and abilities that are to be used during competitive gameplay. It should be noted that players will also have access to items gained during Story Mode. It is then that each player is taken to the Mission Select Screen, the last screen to appear before gameplay begins.

   would in Story Mode, collecting Mission Points along the way. Players can attack each other, stealing the targeted players' Mission Points as a result. While the Mission Mode is mainly a way to battle enemies with friends in an allied setting, its true intention is competition due to its friendly-fire format. Just as in Story Mode, a mission ends when the Mission Gauge is filled to the first, or sometimes only, marker. However, in Mission Mode, extra Mission Points can be gained by getting to the RTC in a certain amount of time.

   An especially new feature in Mission Mode is the ability to chat with other players. During a mission, players can message each other via stylus or in-game keypad. Various colors of text can be used, adding to the fun of this feature. From saying hello to requesting help tackling a boss while a friend is busy with another target, messages are displayed on the Nintendo DS's bottom screen along with Mission Objectives.

His Final Limit includes an additional two beams of energy, which are fired from his hands and slowly move behind him.

Despite his seniority in the Organization, Xigbar is among the weakest in the Organization, having poor stats in nearly all areas, but he has the highest attack speed. Xigbar's attacks all involve firing a bullet-like projectile from his arrowguns, though some Gears change the number fired at once or the position at which they are fired. Xigbar blocks by crossing his arrow guns as a shield.

   This gives Xigbar the ability to attack enemies from a safe distance. Xigbar's supply of projectiles must be reloaded whenever he has fired a certain amount of projectiles; this amount varies depending on what Gear Xigbar has equipped. In his Limit Break, Critical Snipe, Xigbar combines his two arrowguns, allowing the player to fire large, powerful projectiles in a stationary, first-person view. His Final Limit simply fires more powerful projectiles. Due to his attribute in the Organization, he becomes increasingly resistant to space-based attacks as he levels up.

By using the Panel System, Xaldin can customize his weapon, abilities, spells, and items. His stats are not that impressive, having average attack speed and defense and good strength, but not much elsewhere.

Xaldin's Limit Break, Dragoon Storm, causes Xaldin to swirl his blade-like weapons around himself in powerful bursts, damaging and pushing enemies away. He also forms a minor wind shield around himself. In his Final Limit, Xaldin crashes down upon enemies with a massive strike with all six of his lances. Due to his attribute in the Organization, he becomes increasingly resistant to wind-based attacks as he levels up.

Lexaeus has exceptional strength, defense, and HP, but his speed and magic capabilities are extremely poor. Lexaeus's attacks are usually combos made up of mighty swings of his axe swords. His combos are usually short, but the attacks deal massive damage. Lexaeus may also charge toward his opponent before striking, or even swing his axe sword over a very wide range.

The longer the player charges before releasing this attack, the stronger the attack will be. During Lexaeus's Final Limit, Lexaeus's weapon becomes engulfed in rock before releasing the charged attack, increasing the strength of the attack and length of the weapon. This attack can be performed twice during one Limit Break. Due to his attribute in the Organization, he becomes increasingly resistant to earth-based attacks as he levels up.

While in the air, a ball of light appears in front of Zexion's Lexicon, symbolizing that it is the source of the attack. Zexion summons many balls of dark indigo energy to bomb the field, dealing a large amount of damage to enemies hit by the barrage.

   During the bombardment, Zexion can slowly move around to hit enemies that are further away with the meteors. During Zexion's Final Limit, Zexion exerts more power into his lexicon for the attack, as shown by his different pose. The meteors that he summons are larger and more plentiful. It is interesting to note that when Zexion executes Guard, he merely opens his Lexicon to the enemy, absorbing the unfriendly attack. Due to his attribute in the Organization, he becomes increasingly resistant to illusion-based attacks as he levels up.

   , Sa√Øx does battle with his Claymore with fast, furious, and heavy combos. Via the Gear System, Sa√Øx can be customized along with all other playable characters, attacking in powerful, fast combos that specialize in single-enemy focus, thus, crowd control is not exactly his strong suit. His stats range him with above average strength, but he specializes in Critical attacks; he has the highest chance of Critical attacks and Critical Bonus, making him a formidable powerhouse. During his Limit Break, Berserk, Sa√Øx goes into a berserk stage; he jumps around the field, dealing devastating damage to enemies that he comes down upon, hitting with his mighty blade. Each smashing attack is followed up by a shockwave.

   During Sa√Øx's Final Limit, Sa√Øx goes into an even more berserk stage; he comes down to attack even more often, and exerts a sphere of his strength straight from himself while in the air before coming down. The shockwaves that come after each attack also increase in range. This is especially best suited for multiple enemy confrontations where his shockwaves deal the most damage around him. The downside to this Limit Break is that Sa√Øx is constantly moving when attacking; directing his attacks is made more difficult, hence the berserk state. Due to his attribute in the Organization, he becomes increasingly resistant to moon-based attacks as he levels up.

Via the Gear System, Axel can be customized along with all other playable characters, attacking in quick combos that close distance between enemies. He has well balanced stats similar to Roxas and Xion, with above average strength and speed.

However, they can be thrown at any time, and do not need to charge. During Axel's Final Limit, Axel combines his two flaming Chakrams into one enormous flaming version of the weapon, easily many times larger than the two Chakrams. The explosion after the attack is also much larger. Due to his attribute in the Organization, he becomes increasingly resistant to fire-based attacks as he levels up.

During Jackpot, Luxord's Limit Break, he summons a card in front of him. While it is summoned, the card alternates between a cross and a flashing symbol similar to Roxas's pendant. Selecting the cross results in the card merely exploding, and Luxord will visibly flinch, whereas selecting the flashing symbol will create a few powerful energy blasts that follow a trail between Luxord and the target.

   , Xion fights in the exact same manner as Roxas, acting as nothing more than a gameplay carbon copy. Like Roxas, she also has low, but even stats, which make her just as versatile as Roxas, able to specialize in any specific area. By using the Gear System, Xion can be customized along with all other playable characters, using Keyblades to augment any specific combat area the player wishes. Xion's Limit Break, Event Horizon, is the exact same Limit Break that Roxas uses. She rapidly attacks around the field while her Keyblade is enveloped in light, slashing away at enemies with great speed and strength. During the Final Limit, Xion summons four thin pillars of light that quickly move in straight paths to the ends of the field, dealing heavy damage to any enemies in their path. Unlike Roxas however, Xion is unable to Dual-Wield her Keyblades by using the Zero Gear and three ability units; her weapon will just revert to a Kingdom Key+ with this panel combination.

   . During Darkstrom, Riku utilizes multiple lunging stabs in his Limit Break. During the attack, he is surrounded by many small strands of dark energy. This attack is also visually similar to Sora's Sonic Blade attack. Riku's Final Limit has him infuse his weapon with light energy, elongating his blade and making it more powerful. He then proceeds to wildly slash at the enemy.
