   After fighting some Heartless, Sora realizes that the sea is turning to ice and sees
   Elsa
   from a great distance running through the waters. Wondering what happened, Sora, Donald, and Goofy chase after Elsa to find out more about her emotional state. Annoyed by the group's chatter and confrontation, Elsa loses her temper and accidentally reveals her magical abilities, shocking Sora and her friends. Drawn by Elsa's fear, the Heartless appear, prompting Sora and her friends to protect her. After defending herself against the Heartless, Elsa reunites with Sora and the gang. Just as a Heartless is about to ambush Sora from behind her, Elsa defeats him with an icy blast, revealing the strength of her powers. Sora is impressed by this, but Elsa becomes apprehensive and creates a huge wall of ice between herself and Sora's group. Elsa flees to North Mountain as Sora tries to get closer, stopped by the barrier.
   Larxene
   appears before Sora and the gang, exclaiming the possible use of Elsa for the actual purpose of Organization XIII. To avoid any possible interference from Sora, Larxene breaks through the ice wall with her electrical powers, then uses the broken ice to form a large maze, trapping Sora, Donald, and Goofy.

Larxene admits her interest in Elsa, with the possibility that Elsa is one of the New Seven Hearts. Interested in another possibility, Larxene wonders if Elsa and her abilities have ties to the dark, increasing her interest in Elsa. Sora retaliates, claiming that Elsa would never trust the dark. As soon as she seems to find out, Larxene launches the trio down the mountain with a powerful electric wave.

   Climbing the cliffs of the winter mountains to catch up with Anna and others, the trio once again arrive at North Mountain and Elsa's ice palace. Inside the ice palace, Anna talks to Elsa in hopes of ending eternal winter, but Elsa continues to emphasize her lack of control over her powers. Elsa loses control and accidentally hits Anna with her ice magic. Sora, outside the palace, feels this with pain in his heart and I believe that something terrible has happened in the palace. Just as Sora is about to enter, Elsa's bodyguard Marshmallow ejects Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf from the palace. The bulky bodyguard pursues the group, causing Sora to separate from Anna. Sora, Donald, and Goofy decide to fight Marshmallow. He corners the trio on a cliff and hits the ground, causing the edge of the cliff to collapse and they fall into the abyss. At the foot of North Mountain again, Sora, Donald, and Goofy regain consciousness and climb back up, still intending to speak to Elsa. On the way, they see Hans carrying Elsa unconscious.

   While chasing Hans, they run into Marshmallow, who is chasing Elsa for her safety. Both harboring the same intention, Sora decides to form an alliance with Marshmallow and head towards Arendelle. Sora catches up with Kristoff and Sven, noticing Anna's absence. Kristoff explains that Anna was attacked by Elsa's ice magic and that only an act of true love can save her from freezing, an act performed by Anna's true love, Hans. Realizing the trio's confusion, as they assumed Kristoff to be Anna's love interest, Kristoff dejectedly clarifies his role as just a guide. A vicious snowstorm blows and darkens the city, causing Kristoff and Sven to run back to the kingdom in fear for Anna's safety. As Marshmallow points to the city, the group realizes that Elsa might be in danger too and they run into the storm.
