   ; however, Donald secretly tells Goofy that he doesn't know if they'll find Sora's friends, but they need him either way if they expect to find the King. Donald proceeds to tell a depressed Sora to cheer up if he wants to come with them ("You can't come along looking like that, understand? No frowning, no sad face. Okay? This boat runs on happy faces!"). Sora attempts to look happy, but only ends up making a fool of himself, much to Donald and Goofy's amusement. Nonetheless, Sora agrees to accompany them, and the three set off.

However, Goofy comes to the rescue and blocks the attack, finding himself unable to betray Sora after all that they had been through together, and Donald rejoins them as well, saying, "All for one, one for all". Amazingly, the strength of their friendship also strengthens Sora's heart, and because his heart became stronger, he is able to regain the Keyblade, meaning that Donald and Goofy are no longer going against orders.

When Sora discovers that Kairi's heart rests within his own, he chooses to release it by stabbing himself with the dark Keyblade left behind by Riku, despite Donald and Goofy frantically trying to convince him otherwise. While Kairi's heart is restored, Sora's is lost, and he becomes a Heartless. Donald is clearly distraught by this, running over to Sora as he fades away and desperately screaming for him to come back, to no avail.

   All the guardians arrive at the Keyblade Graveyard where they are greeted by Master Xehanort and the other members of the Real Organization XIII and are ambushed by a massive swarm of Heartless, Nobodies and Unversed.

The guardians are quickly overwhelmed, but gets staggered by Goofy and Donald uses a powerful Zettaflare spell to finish him off. As a result of using such a powerful spell, Donald collapses to the ground exhausted after using a lot of energy from that attack. All the guardians of light get swept away from a massive Demon Tide and Donald loses his heart from it, but Sora is able to save his heart as well as the other guardians of light that fell in battle. The guardians confront Terra-Xehanort but Terra's Lingering Will fights him and defends the guardians. Sora, Donald, and Goofy face off against a Demon Tide, which Sora manages to dispatch thanks to the help from the light of the past. Afterwards, Xigbar and Dark Riku come in to taunt the guardians before summoning another massive swarm of enemies. The guardians are overwhelmed, but then they're saved by Yen Sid who creates a path for all the guardians to advance though Donald and Goofy stay behind to defend Yen Sid. Donald and Goofy and the other guardians catch up to Sora and find that Xehanort has summoned Kingdom Hearts and Darkness is quickly spreading. Mickey and Riku get the idea to trap Xehanort as he's a portal and finish him off. Sora takes up the job and Donald and Goofy go with him and with the help of the guardians, the trio crosses over into the portal and arrive at Scala ad Caelum for the final battle with Xehanort. The trio emerge victorious over the battle and are quickly rejoined by the other guardians. Xehanort gives Sora the χ-blade before passing on and Sora uses it to close Kingdom Hearts. The guardians return to the Keyblade Graveyard and Sora decides to go look for Kairi despite knowing the risks if he uses the Power of Waking too many times.

   He immediately runs into the battle after that. All in all, deep within Donald's short tempered and impatient nature he is actually good hearted, as he would sacrifice anything for the sake of friendship; this is proven twice in the games, when he initially leaves Sora to follow Riku after he obtained the Keyblade, but eventually chooses to return to his side; also when the King orders him and Goofy to take Sora from Hollow Bastion to look for Kairi and Riku, but chooses against his orders to help Leon and the others protect Hollow Bastion. He also seems to be afraid of Daisy as shown at Disney Castle when she yells at him for missing their date.

His navy jacket is now much longer and has a blue addition to the bottom that covers the lower half of his body. The sleeves are long and resemble those of a sweater, sporting vertical creases.

   Although Donald can manage in melee combat, and does not do too poorly with his more Strength-oriented weapons, due to a lack of special attacks and low HP this is more often than not a bad choice. Instead it is recommended to customize his parameters to 'constantly' use magic, even if he tends to waste MP while doing so more often than not. His offensive spells can be devastating when used at the right moment. This is especially the case if you give him

   As a downside he tends to fare poorly against bosses, as they often possess high resistances to magic, largely nullifying his potential, and deal enough damage to knock him out more often than not. And despite Donald's healing spells being being exceptionally useful when he times them right when you hit critical health, he can be equally unreliable by not healing you at all. In the late game he becomes a genuine powerhouse regardless, when he has enough staying power to last in a bossfight, and enough MP to repeatedly heal everyone and also throw around defensive
