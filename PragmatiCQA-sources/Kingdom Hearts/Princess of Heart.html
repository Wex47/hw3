   After learning of Xehanort's goal, Yen Sid reveals to Mickey the origins of the Princesses of Heart and his fear that Xehanort's 13 Darknesses would go after the princesses and cast the worlds in darkness again if they did not form the
   Seven Lights
   to fight them. Despite not wanting to put the Princesses as a whole in danger, Yen Sid had Riku bring Kairi to him so she can master her Keyblade and aid the others in the upcoming battle.

   According to Yen Sid, after the events of Kingdom Hearts, the Pure Light of which the Princesses of Heart were the guardians would have "passed on by itself" to a whole new generation of Princesses; with the exception of Kairi, who did not pass on her power. Until now, only three of these new Princesses of Hearts have been identified by Marluxia and Larxene, then by Sora: Rapunzel, Elsa and Anna.

   The seven Princesses possess only light within their hearts. These hearts of pure light allow them to open the Final Keyhole in Hollow Bastion, which is supposed to hold absolute power over the universe. However, it can only be opened when they are all gathered, and their hearts are used in some form of ritual. Once the Keyhole is opened, the hearts return to the Princesses' bodies.

   The purity of their hearts also grants them abilities to keep darkness away or hold it back temporarily, something that comes natural to the Princesses merely by being in presence. The greater the number of Princesses gathered, the more effective this skill is. In addition, they can sense darkness, as shown when five of the princesses tell Sora of a great darkness nearby.
