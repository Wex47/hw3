   Although Larxene is normally smiling in-game, she can be undoubtedly cold, ruthless, and uncaring, and appears to love nothing more than to bring other people down. Described the most as a domineering woman of strong personality, who does not ask, but tells, she has sharp wit and sardonic remarks ready to spite others on purpose. Her jokes tend to be more ill-humored as well, enabling anyone to successfully get irritated, and sometimes if pushed far enough, yell or charge at her in anger, a reaction which she seems to find humorous. In the

  </p>
  <p key="ecebea61-45a7-45b7-8271-c6ce9bce1ad0">
   Along with the callousness, however, she oddly displays childish and playful behavior, laughing and giggling excessively. She, although recognizable with her overall behavior. Laid back and almost passive to those she likes, or refers to as good company, Larxene expresses herself in a dramatized manner, constantly making outrageous expressions and hand movements.

   She taunts Vexen incessantly after he is threatened with charges of treason and incompetence from Marluxia, though that could be connected to her personal dislike of the man, and toys with Sora before fighting him the first time. In fact, she even leads Sora to believe that she is a nice person, just trying to help point him in the right direction: "The bad guys are holding her deep within the castle. And you, the hero, have to go save her." She then smiles and attacks him, sending him flying with a powerful kick and informs him that she is a "bad guy", mocking his failure to remember Naminé.

   After she discovers Axel's unexpected betrayal and sees that Marluxia's and her plans have fallen apart, while affected negatively and almost seemingly disappointed when speaking of it, her friendly manner vanishes and she attacks Sora in a rage. Nevertheless, surprisingly in death, she sounds out a cry of what appears as sadness as she is fading instead of what is expected to be a usual villainous end, especially with her acts throughout the game. It showed a different side of her that had yet to be seen before that compares to Saïx's own demise. This brings to question if she truly is what she has presented herself to be the whole time, or if there is more to her.

   novels that correlate with the series, she meets Marluxia for the first time and has just joined the Organization as the sole female. The topic of the Organization's goal is spoken of. Being that she was the newest recruit and was asking questions, complaining that there was nothing to do around the castle, and that it was "boring" all the more, Marluxia repeated to her what Xemnas once told him; which was that they were here to regain back their hearts. She had gone silent in thought at the answer, before saying that a heart was not really necessary. She felt having one was painful, and she was fine with the way things are now, perhaps implying that she was hurt emotionally for most of her original self's life, and that lacking a heart keeps the pain at bay.

   When she becomes a member of the real Organization XIII, Larxene seems more and more sarcastic to her enemies, though her temperament has not changed significantly; however, she is still as sharp and rude in her meetings with other members of the Organization. After being defeated, she slightly opens up, revealing that she had no interest in Xehanort's plans and that she was merely "along for the ride". When Sora implores Larxene on who she was with, she smiles and fades into darkness, saying "my secret".

   with which they could take over the Organization. Joining in on this plot is their fellow member Axel, one of Larxene's closer friends; however, unbeknown to her or to Marluxia, this is all a ruse on Axel's end, as he is assigned by the Organization as a double agent to gather evidence of their plan and, if their suspicions proved true, eliminate them.

   As soon as Sora enters Castle Oblivion, Naminé began manipulating his memories as per Marluxia's orders; soon he begins to gain false memories of Naminé being a childhood friend until all he is unable to remember is her name. At that point, Larxene confronts Sora directly, revealing Naminé is being held hostage in the castle, and attacks him viciously, revealing a lucky charm Naminé had apparently given him years ago, motivating him into remembering her name.

   Finally, Larxene and Marluxia goad Vexen into fighting Sora head on before having him killed by Axel so as to keep Vexen out of their way and to test Axel's loyalties. As soon as Axel is let in on their plot, which seems sure to come to fruition, Axel releases Naminé behind their backs, allowing her to confess to Sora. Their plot having fallen apart, Larxene reveals the nature of Naminé and the Riku Replica to Sora before intending to kill him to cut her losses. However, infuriating the youth when she strikes Naminé down when she attempts to reason with her, Donald and Goofy come to Sora's aid and Larxene is mortally wounded in the brutal battle that followed. Mortified of her loss and that she is fading, Larxene impotently babbles near nonsense as she is swallowed by the darkness, and fades away in dishonour and indignity as she is utterly defeated - a victim of her own hubris.

   Demyx

Larxene bickers to Demyx for a bit before Marluxia reveals that the Organization still wasn't finished filling out their ranks, causing Larxene to sheepishly reveal that she told the heroes that they were ready. Xemnas appears to tell them to keep the charade going, and after explaining the origins of the original Organization's roster to the group, reveals that they, along with

Larxene soon regroups and fights alongside Marluxia, Luxord and Xemnas against Mickey and Sora. Upon being defeated, she collapses to her knees and gets annoyed that she lost to "a bunch of losers" again, but admits that she would have found being Xehanort's "heart tank" worse. When Sora asks why she joined him in the first place, she explains that she was just "along for the ride"; Sora asks

   Larxene, despite her sarcastic nature, is still a powerful member of the Organization XIII. She has proven to be an incredibly strong an fast hand-to-hand fighter, as in both times she talks to Sora, albeit granted both times she did have the advantage of Sora being either confused or angry and in their last fight weakened from being attacked by Riku Replica, she could easily pressure him without even using her claws and disarm him of his Keyblade with a single kick and the second time she does this, she injures Sora enough to the point that he can barely stand. She is also strong enough to hold the Riku Replica by the head, and easily toss him across the room with one hand. Her strength is clearly known by many of the characters, such as the Riku Replica who claims to fear nothing, yet cowers at Larxene.

   Larxene's physical fighting skills resemble that of a ninja. She uses her knives between her fingers to act like claws, and is able to infuse them with electricity and throw them at Sora. She is easily the fastest and most agile member of the Organization with only Xemnas rivaling or surpassing her in that regard, often using quick kicks and jabs to produce extra pain to the opponent. Along with her manipulative nature, this sadism earned her the title "Savage Nymph".

   Larxene is a powerful user of thunder magic, able to call down multiple strikes or a single bolt of lightning upon the battlefield and can empower her knives with lightning to increase their power when thrown along with also able to have them fire beams of lightning, as well as to perform levitation and local teleportation. Her sleights and special abilities all involve her use of these abilities.
