   Sora, by accessing Drive Forms, has the ability to use combat techniques revolving the use of the power of light. Roxas uses his powers of light when fighting Sora, calling upon Light to increase his speed and attack power and even uses several projections of light, such as controlling thirteen sword-shaped shields of light energy which can connect to form a laser array, and shooting his thirteen light shields around the arena, which then light it up in a thick twilight mist as Roxas begins shooting blue spheres of light at his opponent from energy gathered in his hands. King Mickey, when playable, uses the spell "Pearl" and he also uses Light to heal Sora fully from being knocked out. Queen Minnie is able to use the "Pearl" spell as well. After Xemnas absorbs the remains of Kingdom Hearts, he gains the powers of light and uses it in the form of crests able to fire white beams, thorns of white energy and can empower his attacks with it, leaving behind trails of white energy.

   Sora's Formchanges grant him the power to use light in combat. The Second Form allows him to use the same old techniques he employed, with the addition of Ancient Light that annihilates foes with five columns of crisscrossing light. The Element Form allows Sora to fire bullets of light and cast powerful light spells. The Guardian Form allows Sora to attack with fists of light. The Ultimate Form grants Sora the ability to manipulate blades of light and can even fire a massively powerful ball of light energy. Roxas and Xion also use light: Roxas is able to create a shield of light to protect from damage, fire beams of light and turn into a damaging light ray while Xion's boss form empowers her Keyblade strikes with light, throws her Keyblade with light enhancing it like a boomerang and as a party member, can use a powerful Holy spell.

Xion's last ability is to surround the entire arena with light, in which she could cause an omnidirectional wave of light. Master Xehanort is able to create light razors and fire beams of light.
