   Sephiroth's personality is one of cold ruthlessness. He is uncaring, having no sympathy for anyone but himself, laughing and grinning at Cloud, seeing him as almost no threat. Sephiroth has been shown with stoic and melancholy personality traits, along with a drawling voice. He is incredibly powerful, both physically and mentally. He is convinced his power surpasses anyone else's. He is shown to have no emotion, never overreacting to anything.

   , Sephiroth also has regular blue eyes, unlike the green, catlike eyes he and his Remnants have in the main series. The sleeves of his coat end in metal rings in place of normal cuffs, and he wears black leather gloves. For some reason there is an odd, black and red, fin-like growth on his right forearm. Sephiroth's face looks strikingly like Cloud's, which is something that Goofy comments on in

He can be argued to be the most powerful of the Final Fantasy characters in the series, as although Cloud stalemates him, it is implied that he was holding back as he wasn't actually intent to kill him but rather to make him give in to the darkness and he easily fights off Tifa.

He also can move at high speeds while slashing at all directions without fail and use a variation of Cloud's "Omnislash" called "Octaslash", where he flies around the arena slashing widely. He can empower himself with an aura of dark energy when weak, greatly increasing his speed and attack potency, as well as charge his blade with energy to make a single slash extend into numerous slashes.

   Sephiroth also is capable of casting extremely powerful magical attacks that resemble his old Final Fantasy self, using "Stigma" to summon gigantic pillars of flames that can suck matter in, "Shadow Flares" to fire orbs of darkness, and his most powerful attack "Super Nova" calls down meteors that spin around him and then explode. His most noticeable technique is "Heartless Angel", an attack that drains Sora's MP and leaves Sora with 1 HP, if he is not interrupted in time; this is immediately followed by "Flash", which is fatal unless blocked via Reaction Command.

   series and most of his appearances throughout the Final Fantasy series. The song originally appeared at the end of Final Fantasy VII as the final boss theme, played during the battle with Safer∙Sephiroth, alluding to his black wing. As a result to this allution, Sephiroth was designed for Kingdom Hearts with a black wing emerging from his right shoulder, a trait that was latter carried to the Compillation of Final Fantasy VII.

  <p key="ebffe4b6-9c52-4014-98ca-2acdaa1be8e2">
   The song is one of the most recognized tracks in the Final Fantasy series, unseating Sephiroth's original theme, "Those Chosen by the Planet." To that extent, the song and its title have become synonymous with Sephiroth even since his appearance in Kingdom Hearts, and "One-Winged Angel" has been used not only as the name of the song, but as a title for Sephiroth himself.
  </p>
  <p key="8a8d3534-fd26-418c-ab3a-3325f142be9d">
   The song was remixed from the original song for Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. The remixes of the theme feature much shorter intros, leading almost immediately into the Latin vocals, and the vocals as a whole are more prominent than in the original version.
