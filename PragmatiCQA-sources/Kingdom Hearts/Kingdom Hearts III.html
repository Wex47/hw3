  <p key="9f2c039f-d27c-4a0d-a15f-c31695a28163">
   Through countless adventures across many worlds in his long battle against the darkness, Sora, once a little boy who only dreamed worlds beyond his island even existed, has grown up to a dashing young man. Now he is realizing that that battle has played out exactly as Master Xehanort had planned, and the second Keyblade War, the final struggle between light and dark, looms ahead. To counter the overwhelming darkness, Sora and his friends must gather the seven guardians of light. His best friend Riku and King Mickey seek out a battle-scarred Keyblade wielder, while Sora, Donald, and Goofy set off on a journey to find “the Key to Return Hearts.” Never-before-featured Disney worlds set the stage for another daring adventure to save the universe!
  </p>
  <p key="86069340-7876-4f0b-9015-23acac1be5df">
   Chosen by the Keyblade, he is the one whose heart’s light never fails to shine as a beacon of hope.
  </p>
  <p key="fe70419f-6e83-4ca6-87b9-78066d64a0f2">
   Sora, the brave hero chosen by the Keyblade, has always had a strong sense of justice. Through his many battles against darkness, he has grown and learned about the world immensely. Drawn to his light, many friends have lent him their support and granted him their powers to counter the darkness: Riku, the childhood friend he grew up with on Destiny Islands; Donald and Goofy, the two brave comrades with whom he has shared his adventures from the very beginning; and King Mickey, who gives Sora his unfailing support. As the world becomes enveloped in another battle against darkness, the Keyblade wielder and his friends must rise up against Master Xehanort and thwart his plot to incite another Keyblade War.

Accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, Sora resumes his travels across other worlds to regain his "power of waking", the ability to restore lost hearts. Meanwhile, Riku and King Mickey search the realm of darkness for Aqua, while Kairi and Lea train to properly wield their newly obtained Keyblades.

   During their travels, Sora and Riku are contacted by Ienzo, who discovers via Ansem the Wise's research data that Sora's body contains the hearts of Roxas, Ventus, and Xion. Riku surmises that the Organization's members from the past are using artificial human replicas created by Vexen as vessels that enable their existence in the present, which inspires Sora to restore Roxas by transferring his heart into a replica body. Meanwhile, the Heartless Ansem enters the realm of darkness and kidnaps Ansem the Wise, corrupting Aqua's heart in the process. However, Vexen reveals himself to be a double agent loyal to Ansem the Wise, whom he helps rescue before sending a spare replica to Ienzo for Roxas to inhabit.

   Riku and Mickey eventually locate and battle the corrupted Aqua in the realm of darkness. At the same time, Sora discovers Master Eraqus's Keyblade on the Destiny Islands and uses it to enter the dark realm, where he exorcises the darkness from Aqua and returns her to the realm of light. Sora, Donald, and Goofy then follow Aqua to Castle Oblivion, which she transforms back into the Land of Departure to awaken Ventus. When she is attacked by Vanitas, Sora rediscovers his power of waking and revives Ventus, who fends Vanitas off.

Awakening in a limbo realm called the Final World, Sora is guided back to the realm of light by Kairi and uses the power of waking to revive his friends. Returning moments before their initial defeat, the guardians of light successfully destroy most of the Organization's members; in the process, Terra regains control of his body and reunites with Aqua and Ventus, while Lea reunites with Xion, whom Vexen recreated for the Organization, and Roxas, who regains his own heart to protect Lea and Xion.

   Once Xehanort remains the last Organization member, he provokes Sora into attacking him by destroying Kairi's body, allowing Xehanort to acquire the χ-blade and summon Kingdom Hearts. Using Xehanort's power of time travel against him, Sora, Donald, and Goofy transport him to his boyhood training grounds of Scala ad Caelum, where they defeat him. After the other Keyblade wielders rejoin them, Eraqus's heart emerges from Terra and convinces Xehanort to surrender. Xehanort dies shortly after, his heart ascending to Kingdom Hearts with Eraqus, while Sora and his friends use the χ-blade to close it and return to the Keyblade Graveyard. Sora decides to use the power of waking to revive Kairi; despite warnings that his repeated misuse of this power could result in him losing his heart, Sora promises to return. Afterwards, Sora's friends gather at the Destiny Islands for a celebration, where Kairi stays beside Sora before he fades away.

In a flashback to their youth, Eraqus and Xehanort begin a new game of chess that predicts a battle between Sora and the Foretellers.

If the situation is really difficult, they'll say, it's really difficult. If it's impossible, they'll say it's impossible." He later stated that even though the Disney Company had acquired these properties, Disney Interactive Studios may not necessarily have the ability to license the content due to existing deals, such as Disney's deal with Electronic Arts for

   world's creation,
   and for the Pixar characters in the game, Pixar shared their actual character models with Square Enix and had the original character designers consult on the game "to make sure everything looked as true to the films as we could make it."
   The design team would talk weekly with Disney, sharing their assets to receive feedback, with Disney sometimes asking "for minute alterations such as insisting a character show less teeth, having their eyelids move differently or their line of sight adjusted". The line of sight notes, which came from Pixar, "were instrumental in raising the general quality of the animation throughout" according to the development team.

   Supporting characters can explore an environment on their own if Sora idles momentarily, sometimes triggering additional cutscene moments. For example, Rapunzel responds if an Aero spell is cast on a group of dandelions. Speaking specifically to interactions such as this with Rapunzel, Yasue said "finding and activating these moments builds trust with" her and can lead "to additional combat scenarios and treasure opportunities".

   only features English and Japanese voice acting and lip syncing, despite previous entries in the series having dubbing in other language. Nomura noted that the development team wanted to prioritize a global simultaneous release for the game, and given the time and resources for recording the dialogue, this would not have been possible with additional language recordings.
   Though the game has both English and Japanese voice acting, the game does not have the ability to switch between them, as the development team found this feature difficult to properly support.
   A version of the game with Chinese subtitles will also be released.
