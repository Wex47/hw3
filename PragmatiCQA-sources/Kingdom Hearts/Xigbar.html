  </h2>
  <p key="74eb9269-5b7c-4bd2-a231-1dc6f26e05fe">
   Xigbar has a confident, indifferent, laid-back and cocky attitude, and likes to taunt Sora to put him off-guard, though with limited success. When not on missions, he occasionally enjoys eavesdropping on his fellow Organization members. He relies heavily on instinct rather than on intelligence for both decision-making and fighting, making him adaptable and unpredictable in battle. He also has a habit of saying, "
   <i key="0ef396ba-ee1a-4da7-9b72-185ed3732244">
    As if
   </i>
   ". In the English version of
   <i key="83906228-05c4-4ea6-8598-dd10caea008d">
    Kingdom Hearts II
   </i>
   , Xigbar speaks with a stereotypical
   <i key="75c966af-1ac1-42a3-85af-4f56cbb1e3dd">
    Californian Surfer
   </i>
   accent, possibly to emphasize on his laid-back nature. Even after revealing himself as
   Luxu
   , the missing Keyblade Master, he retains his easygoing personality, even in the face of his colleagues losing their patience.
  </p>
  <p key="dd219efb-a239-4c23-8bab-5bafb254630a">
   Along with
   Axel
   ,
   Larxene
   and
   Demyx
   , Xigbar acts as the Organization's comic relief due to his frequent sarcasm and wise cracks. Xigbar however is possibly the most wise-cracking of them all as unlike Axel and Larxene who know when to be serious, and Demyx having his comic relief due to his klutzy persona, along with his laziness, Xigbar never breaks character and even in his battle he still makes sarcastic comments. He also uses nicknames for the other members on occasions, calling
   <a href="Roxas.html" key="e40de6b1-3343-4023-acc0-646295900263" title="Roxas">
    Roxas
   </a>
   "kiddo" or "tiger" in the Grey Area and on various missions, calling
   Xion
   "Poppet" in the Grey Area, and once calling Axel "Flamesilocks" near the end of the game, when he talks to Roxas about the outcome of Xion's escape at Wonderland.
  </p>
  <p key="412d6dd6-8682-47c9-91f2-95aae6037cf8">
   Xigbar is also shown to be very uncaring to the other members of the Organization, remarking to Roxas that it did not bother him about what had happened to the members at Castle Oblivion, and even stating that he is glad the castle is quieter. He even jokingly remarks in the Organization's final meeting, "seems like we're getting a lot more free seats".
  </p>
  <p key="92211f4e-273e-4f3f-b85b-cc35d51d9b45">
   Along with the rest of the Organization he considers Roxas to be a traitor. He seems to support this view more than any other Organization member as he's the only one who states it in his battle quotes. In fact, when the battle begins he remarks, "you really shouldn't have betrayed us!" to Sora. However, this could simply be in keeping with his mocking personality, as he seemed to be taunting Sora for his ignorance of Roxas.
  </p>
  <p key="ffc66c57-8a58-464a-9fba-4e34c524b572">
   He also appears to not value the concept of a brave hero rushing into an extremely dangerous situation to help out and implied he believes it led to the hero dragging others down into the mess with him. He points out that
   <a href="Hercules.html" key="c78b5089-995d-422a-bffa-a523d09e1c5b" title="Hercules">
    Hercules

   is the exception because of his close connections to the gods, something that ordinary people don't have.
  </p>
  <p key="1e080331-bd97-4618-a770-ea944dd0381e">
   Despite his callousness, he does seem to not be entirely without empathy, which he shows towards Xion when she fails to defeat the Organization's "

   ".
  </p>
  <p key="c2e08076-0466-4547-882c-50aa1632e8f6">
   Despite his high rank, Xigbar is not given high authority like
   Saïx
   or
   <a href="Marluxia.html" key="6700890e-6463-4ecc-9099-29388a74ba41" title="Marluxia">

   </a>
   , but he instead is sent on missions and confrontations with Sora. Considering his personality, it may be simply that Xigbar prefers field work to a more administrative position. However,
   <i key="6e74fd22-2e18-4127-9f12-bffd26635f79">
    Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days
   </i>
   seems to contradict this, as Xigbar attended a meeting at which the only other members attending were
   <a href="Xemnas.html" key="57feb811-1ac1-471c-8deb-57eaf2f685e1" title="Xemnas">
    Xemnas
   </a>
   and Saïx, the Organization's leader and second-in-command respectively. He does, however, maintain a position of importance in the Organization due to his past with Xehanort, and is privy to information about the Organization's leader that only a few others know. A master spy, Xigbar has a habit of divulging relatively important information to his enemies through his taunts, though he is typically vague enough that they do not understand his meeting; for example, his numerous comments to Sora about Ventus and Roxas; he is also described by Roxas as being difficult to trick. Xigbar does not seem to be intimidated by Xemnas as some other Organization members are, going so far as to spy on him in the Chamber of Repose.
  </p>
  <p key="0bfa1bb3-8f93-4e94-a514-e05ee76d8c76">
   Unlike the other Organization members, Xigbar does not express fear or remorse while fading into darkness, instead chuckling rather triumphantly and giving Sora a cocky reply to the final question Sora asks him. Given his general knowledge of Xehanort's plans and his subsequent return, Xigbar may have known beforehand that he would be restored.
  </p>
  <p key="072a3b9d-e622-42d9-926d-9d0483d86f7c">
   However, Xigbar has broken away from his usual, easygoing personality on a few occasions. When confronting Sora during Sora's Mark of Mastery exam, he was intimidated by Sora's confidence and resolve. Later, when Xigbar was confronted by
   <a href="Luxord.html" key="ecc0df8d-d5e3-430f-9c36-c0f37eeff1d3" title="Luxord">
    Luxord
   </a>
   over the motive of his mission, Xigbar grew increasingly frustrated as Luxord pressed the topic and started getting closer to the truth.
  </p>
  <p key="6afbcf60-5fb6-436f-bb69-146fe1ec6ca7">
   The rather dark and grim words of the Secret Reports he wrote as Luxu portrays Xigbar in a different way, where he seems to be somewhat weary and lonely over the decades he had spent fulfilling the Master of Masters’ future prophecies. Xigbar also reveals that despite having carried out the Masters’ orders regarding the Foretellers, he still values them as friends, as he considers reuniting with the Foretellers his reward.

   Xigbar wears the usual Organization garb of a black cloak, black boots, and black gloves, though his cloak is distinguishable by more pointed shoulders and the fact that it sags at his shoulders. The sleeves of his cloak are also somewhat closer-fitting than normal, though not as close as Axel's. In terms of facial features, Xigbar sports gold eyes, pointed, elf-like ears, upturned eyebrows, and dark hair with several grey streaks tied into a long ponytail. The grey streaks, along with the length of his hair, may be only present due to him harboring a fragment of

   He also has two visible injuries on his face; the first being a damaged right eye covered by an eyepatch, while the other is a large jagged scar extending from his left cheek to just under his left eye. His original self, Braig, received these injuries when he fought the Keyblade wielder

   to take his place for the day. Before Zexion could leave him to his break, Xigbar stops him and tells him to stay and chat, asking of Xemnas's secret. Xigbar then spiels on Xemnas's origins as Xehanort, causing Zexion to ask what he was getting at. Xigbar tells him of the Chamber of Repose, a room that was constructed in the basement of the labs they used to work in when they were complete beings, and that Xemnas goes down into the room to chat with someone, when in reality there is no one else there.

   When Zexion asks if he should repeat his thoughts on eavesdropping, Xigbar justifies himself by saying it wasn't eavesdropping since he couldn't hear what they were saying, asking Zexion if he knew anything about it. Zexion tells Xigbar that he would very much like to get his own work done, as should Xigbar, reminding him that they need to prepare the new facility at Castle Oblivion, but they still needed more hands on deck. Xigbar questions what Xemnas wanted with the castle, and although Zexion assures him that Xemnas revealed his intentions to them, Xigbar interrupts and tells him that there was something Xemnas didn't share. Xigbar explains that the Chamber of Repose is part of a pair, and that the Chamber of Waking is the other. He explains that it was constructed by

Ultimately, he is defeated after a vicious and frenetic battle, and begins to fade into the darkness. Sora asks him why he called him "Roxas", to which Xigbar merely chuckles and responds mockingly with "wouldn't you like to know?" before fading away with another trademark grin, making him the ninth member to fade away, tenth if Xion is counted.

Xigbar then tells Sora to spare him the usual spiel on hearts being more powerful when connected, warning that putting too much of that power in one place would cause some of those hearts to break, though Xigbar assures Sora to accept his powers and to find the hearts joined to him. When Sora asks why he would ever listen to him, Xigbar tells him he has no choice, telling him that at the end of it all he would finally learn what destiny has in store for him, suggesting his reward might be right around the corner.

As Luxord inquires on Xigbar's intentions, Xigbar attempts to lie his way out of the topic by explaining that the Black Box contained important Keyblade wielder secrets; Luxord however is not convinced by his answer, and throws a card towards Xigbar while questioning him on the Black Box's sudden importance and his true identity, as he believes that he wishes to secure the Black Box in order to remove any connections to him with it. Though Xigbar gives no answer after catching the card other than an angry look, Luxord stands down, remarking that it wouldn't matter to him while explaining he was content with being silent before warping away. After he leaves, Xigbar tosses the card aside and asks aloud who Luxord himself was.

Xigbar explains to the heroes that the effigy was a final test for them to prove themselves after their previous "blunder" at the hands of Terra-Xehanort and the Heartless. Before warping away to regroup with the other Organization members, Xigbar tells the replica to "take it away". Xigbar soon walks with the rest of the Organization as they confront the guardians at the Keyblade Graveyard crossroads before Master Xehanort creates the Skein of Severance, a large stone labyrinth to serve as the battlegrounds of the Keyblade War. Xigbar soon fights alongside Ansem and Dark Riku against Riku and Sora, the latter having joined the battle late, at the Trail of Valediction. Once Dark Riku kicks down Riku when the latter attempts to chase after the fleeing Ansem, Xigbar prepares to finish Riku with a barrage of shots from his Arrowguns, though Sora is able to jump in front of Riku and deflect the shots with his Keyblade. Grinning, Xigbar tells the two to "keep the line moving" before resuming the battle.

   As a spire of darkness emerges from Xigbar after his defeat, he collapses onto the group in front of Sora and Riku, lamenting that things would have been different if he had a Keyblade. When told by Sora that he wasn't worthy to wield one, Xigbar remarks that he was indeed worthy, which confuses the two guardians. Xigbar pulls himself up with one of his Arrowguns, explaining that Master Xehanort promised to bequeath him his Keyblade as a reward for helping him, and that it was the only reason he ever stuck around with him in the first place. Riku comments that it would be wasted on him, to which Xigbar replies with his signature "as if" before warping away, reappearing on the top of the labyrinth walls. Chuckling to himself as Sora and Riku watched on, Xigbar staggers backwards before falling off the wall and to his supposed demise, allowing his Arrowguns to fade away to reinforce his false elimination. Regardless, Xigbar was the second member of the real Organization to be defeated.

Having heard enough, Aced demands Xigbar to tell them what his role was. Turning to look at the Black Box at his side with a grin on his face, Xigbar asks if the four liked long stories.

   During Xigbar's desperation moves, they are able to fire a massive stream of powerful rounds, which glow blue rather than red, and adapt a rapid-fire ability. When held together and charged, they can fire a massive blue energy arrow that rebounds around the area, and can be angled to hit an enemy multiple times. After several attacks, they need to be reloaded.

   was released in North America, one of the main changes in the game was made to Xigbar, specifically his weapon. As noted above, Xigbar combines his two guns together to make a sniper rifle. Due to restraints on video game violence, this was changed in North America, with Xigbar no longer created his sniper rifle, and instead, simply spun his guns around as they brightened before teleporting, using one gun as a balance to steady the gun with which he sniped.

   , Xigbar performs two new abilities with his Arrowguns. His first new attack is a buckshot salvo; Xigbar charges up a shot with one of his Arrowguns while the other acts as a timer, floating beside him. When the timer finishes, Xigbar fires a buckshot from the charging Arrowgun, which will not warp towards the target, but instead linger on the ground, exploding if anyone gets too close to a round. His second new attack is his desperation move; Xigbar will warp into the center of the arena, where he will combine his Arrowguns into a bow and charge up a massive shot, firing it into the sky; anyone close to him as he fires his shot will be blasted to the edges of the arena. The shot will turn into a purple cloudy portal, raining down shots in circle that expands outwards from the center.
