   After rescuing the castle's servants at Belle's request, Sora, Donald, Goofy and the Beast's butler,
   Cogsworth
   found the Beast in his room, being provoked by Xaldin. After battling the Beast to calm him down, the Beast came to his senses and decided to apologize to Belle.
  </p>
  <p key="cc74e418-7882-4eb8-8286-30a99b111a1e">
   However, Belle was not in her room. The Beast and company found her running from
   Shadow Stalker
   in the castle's ballroom. She escaped to the balcony as the Beast confronted Xaldin and fought the Shadow Stalker that Xaldin attacked the group with. After the fight, the Beast apologized to Belle, who accepted. However, Belle was still disappointed in the Beast's lack of trust for her, and Sora left their world wondering if they would ever manage to work out their differences.

   When Sora returned, he found the Beast pacing in the main entrance. The Beast was dressed very nicely, and after a few reluctant grunts he finally admitted that he and Belle were on a date for the evening. Unfortunately, as the two began to dance in the ballroom, Xaldin returned. The Beast charged at Xaldin, while Belle bemoaned the Organization's interference with her romantic evening. Following yet another battle, Xaldin told the Beast that something precious to him was now gone. The Beast realized Xaldin had been talking about the enchanted rose, and abandoned his friends to check if his fear was true.
  </p>
  <p key="21b2c0af-0c75-4067-9a7b-ba176ac98613">
   Unfortunately, this was exactly the case, and in his despair, the Beast lashed out at Belle and Sora, telling them to leave his castle. But, while Belle walked to her room to prepare for her departure, Sora stayed and convinced the Beast that he needed to show Xaldin who was boss. The Beast, realizing Sora's words were true, went to find Xaldin, who was waiting for him in the entrance hall. When Xaldin retreated outside, the Beast followed.
  </p>
  <p key="af8c71c2-06de-4d03-aeaf-9d6a770d0902">
   Meanwhile, Belle stood on the balcony outside of her room, lost in thought. When she saw Beast and the others emerge from the castle, she ran back inside, but saw the rose sitting beside her door. She happily held the rose over the balcony to show it to the Beast, but she was suddenly grabbed behind by Xaldin and whisked away to the castle's bridge.
  </p>
  <p key="8932bdeb-30b3-4d3e-9a3c-a28c6c7240e8">
   The Beast was then presented with the choice of keeping Belle or his rose; he chose Belle, but did not have to worry, as Belle briefly took matters into her own hands; she caught Xaldin off guard, painfully elbowed him in the stomach, grabbed the rose, and ran off toward Sora and party, ensuring that the Beast lost neither her or the rose.
  </p>
  <p key="f632ea34-f6df-416b-9eed-717967e35edd">
   After a fierce confrontation with Xaldin (which the Organization member lost), the Beast gladly took his rose back from Belle. However, he was ashamed of how he had yelled at Belle, and (with a little encouragement from his friends) bashfully asked her to stay with him. Belle smiled and accepted, and the two danced the night away in the castle courtyard.

The Beast is still prone to lashing out in anger, especially when provoked by characters like Maleficent or Xaldin.

   The Beast's appearance is a combination of physical characteristics from various wild animals, including a wild boar, wolf, buffalo, bear, gorilla and lion. He often wears a torn purple cape and dark blue pants. When dressed up, he ties his hair back with a blue bow, and wears a blue and yellow jacket, an orange vest, and black pants. He is mostly shown hunched, except when he is in his formal dress.

  <p key="5843295d-82d6-423d-9586-cb097dd03961">
   When in his human form, Prince Adam has shoulder-length red hair. He dons the same formal suit he wore as the Beast, tailored to fit him; he also wears brown boots. The only striking similarity between Prince Adam and his beastly alter ego is his blue eyes.

   works well with his melee role (can take more damage) and size (makes him easier to get hit).

   also serve to further drag out Beast's staying power on the battlefield. Finally he has a massive amount of eight

   Belle offers to replace Maurice with herself and the Beast accepts. The Beast treats Belle with nothing but contempt at first, but gradually begins to warm up to her with the help from his servants and eventually the two fall in love. The Beast is killed at the film's climax by a rival suitor for Belle, Gaston, but after Gaston is killed in return, Belle's love for the Beast breaks the spell on him and transforms into Prince Adam again.
