He acts like an older brother towards them, being their main source of advice and wisdom, shown by Roxas in a journal entry when he wrote that he thought Axel knew everything. In some cases he got them out of trouble even when it could and

Whenever Roxas or Xion asked him about it, he would give a brief or vague answer, then try to change the subject, often avoiding eye-contact when lying. Even at his worst points (his earlier days as a Nobody), Axel still valued friendship, as despite Saïx's vast change, he was still the closest to him out of the Organization XIII and was willing to risk treason by helping him rise through the ranks. However, as Saïx changed too much, Axel ultimately began to be uncomfortable with their working relationship and he ultimately abandoned it for Roxas.

Even during the events at Castle Oblivion, Axel displays emotion and acknowledges it when he begins laughing, but catches himself and stops. He even mocks his ability to feel during his death. Whether he, Roxas, Naminé, and Xion all seem to have something unusual in common regarding the heart, is unknown. But it has been hinted by

   Like other Organization members, Axel wears the basic black gloves and boots. His black coat, however, is one of the more distinctive ones in the group, as its sleeves close up tightly around his arms and emphasizes his lithe and skinny build. Axel himself is also easily distinguishable from other characters in terms of facial features, made easier by the fact that he rarely wears the hood of his coat up. Axel has fair skin with rosy hues, a widow's peak, rather small eyebrows and thick, shoulder-length, bright red hair styled into slicked-back spikes. His eyes are a bright emerald color and he has a purple reverse-teardrop shaped marking under each eye, which are similar to, although not the same as,
   Reno's
   facial markings.

Upon throwing the first battle with Sora, giving him a card to progress further, Axel admits to testing the Keyblade master's strength. After leaving Sora bewildered, Axel holds a serious conversation with Larxene in which he professes an interest in the fact that Sora retains his self-consciousness even after becoming a

   Using this to his advantage, Axel allowed Naminé to escape and contact Sora. No sooner did Naminé escape, Axel pondered on the chaos to ensue before realizing that he was laughing to his amazement. He later confronted Marluxia, allowing him to figure out that he acted as a double agent during their entire time in the castle. Citing his previous order to rid the Organization of traitors, Axel readied to attack Marluxia, even after Marluxia used Naminé as a shield, but was interrupted by Sora, whom he eventually fought for the last time. At the end of the battle, Axel pretends to be defeated and confuses Sora with the words "It was worth saving you after all," and vanishes.

   , he feels that Roxas has replaced him with Xion. He then ends up accepting Xion and is comforted when she asks him if she could also be his friend, Xion then reveals her face to Axel. Seeing Xion's face shocks Axel because of how similar she looks to Naminé. Before this time, Axel thought of girls as complicated beings with buttons, press the wrong one and you're out. At Roxas's suggestion, the three begin to spend time together as a trio. He is often asked questions related to the heart and the nature of Nobodies by Xion and Roxas, who lack any memories of life as human beings. Some of his answers were vague, but at times, he doesn't understand the question himself and is left rambling. At times, Axel acts as a sort of "big brother" figure to Roxas and Xion, standing up to Saïx for them. When Xion loses her ability to use the Keyblade, Axel comes up with the plan of putting her and Roxas together on missions to collect hearts. However, it would seem that Saïx knew Axel too well by the way he was acting.

Saïx reminds Axel of the friendship they shared before becoming Nobodies, and the plans they had to take over the Organization; the friendship between him, Roxas and Xion is "make-believe" while the one he had with Saïx was real in his old friend's opinion. When he learns Xion's true nature as a replica, Axel was left conflicted about what to do. He got to know to Xion for the person she became, not the copy of Sora that she's supposed to be. After she left to find herself, Axel lied to Roxas, saying that she had an important mission.

   However, it backfired the next day when Xemnas revealed Xion's defection. Because of the guilt he felt for not telling Roxas, Axel avoided him for a while.

They find Xion there, but she fled after the Imposter blocks their way. They then try to catch him, but he escapes; they're relieved to know Xion's okay. However, Saïx orders Axel to destroy Xion since she's come in contact with the imposter; Axel quells Roxas's fears by saying he'll think of something.

Despite this, his power still doesn't match the likes of Xemnas, who is the only one to force him to do things he doesn't like and Axel acknowledges that Xemnas can easily turn him into a Dusk, causing him to consent to targeting Roxas, Roxas, who soundly defeated him after he gained full power, and Saïx, who Axel is shown to be wary of fighting, backing down immediately when he saw Saïx appear in Hollow Bastion.
