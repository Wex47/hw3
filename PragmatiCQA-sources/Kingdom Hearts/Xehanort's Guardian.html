   The Guardian has many dark powers with which it assists the one it is paired with in battle. It also possesses great physical strength and is impervious to all damage. It is strong enough to squeeze the air out someone like Roxas, forcing the Nobody unconscious; even able to crack the Lingering Will's head with enough pressure.
  </p>
  <p key="d703d1ef-3df1-42d9-824e-871077cda19b">
   While it tends to stay behind its host, it can be commanded to detach itself from that host to attack its victims. It has the ability to possess its opponents in order to drain their HP and hold them in place to give its host an opening to attack. The Guardian can also attack with bursts of darkness, fire, and lightning spawned from its fists, darkness-infused punches, and blades of dark energy.
  </p>
  <p key="cc3cd4df-93e3-442f-ae0d-727ba2ff2d45">
   Similar to a Pureblood Heartless, the Guardian's most devastating ability allows it to sink into the ground, creating massive shockwaves every time it re-emerges in an attempt to grab its opponent. The Guardian and its host can also double-team opponents as it uses its own body to ram them with brute force with its host safely steering it from behind while protected by a shield of darkness.

   to distract opponents, drain its opponents MP as opposed to their HP if they get too close, and create large whirlwinds with its arms to knock opponents away. While it is only when the Guardian is paired with its host that it is a truly formidable opponent, it is shown to hold its own quite well without the influence of a host, mercilessly attacking the opponent without ceasing.

   When paired with Ansem, Seeker of Darkness, the Guardian will immediately go on the offensive in battle, punching opponents if they come too close or bombarding them with dark projectiles if they are out of attack range. On Ansem's command, the Guardian will appear in front of him, preventing him from being damaged. However,
   Aeroga

   The Guardian may also obey Ansem's command to leave him and attach itself to Sora, a "?" occasionally appearing over Sora's head once this occurs. If
   is pressed when this icon is on the screen, the Guardian will latch onto Sora and drain a large amount of his HP. It will eventually return to Ansem in the end, however. It is because of this attack that the player must use careful timing of the
   Dodge Roll

   Curaga

   When Ansem and the Guardian face Sora on their own, their move-set will be identical to that of the first battle. However, the Guardian and Ansem can now use some new, devastating attacks. The first involves the pair jetting across the battlefield, dealing damage as they collide with Sora. Either Guard or Aeroga can be used to halt their advance. The second is, by far, the most damaging, the Guardian sinking into the ground on Ansem's command and creating short-ranged shockwaves as it respawns in an attempt to attack Sora. Dodge Roll can be used to avoid the Guardian, as well as the large burst of energy that results in the Guardian returning to Ansem.

  <p key="52924ae9-d0ea-443f-acc5-f702d4bb0da2">
   When paired with Terra-Xehanort during the final battle with Aqua, the Guardian will do most of the attacking, creating small shockwaves as it re-emerges from dark portals on the ground, slamming Aqua into the ground after carrying her high into the air, should the shockwaves make contact with her. The Guardian can deal a powerful punch, release twin columns of energy from its fists, and even shoot twin energy spheres from each hand.
  </p>
  <p key="247ba371-e3d3-4969-9450-3297fbf7ad25">
   The Guardian can latch onto Aqua, the
   Keyblade Master
   only able to free herself when the player rapidly taps
   ; when this happens, regardless of whether or not Aqua frees herself, it will warp Aqua to
   Terra
   's mind. The Guardian will attempt to drive Aqua away from Terra (who waits for Aqua to activate Dual Limit) with its energy sphere attack. However, if Aqua gets past the attack and makes it to Terra's location, she can activate a special
   Deck Command
   entitled Dual Limit that will deal impressive amounts of damage to the Guardian by allowing Aqua to team up with Terra and shoot it with an immense amount of light energy. Hitting the Guardian with any attack or magic spell during this phase will force Aqua out of Terra's mind.

   During this battle, the Guardian becomes huge and connected to a large ball of darkness, in which Ansem protects himself. The Guardian can use this ball to summon a shockwave to blow Riku backwards. It retains the power to shoot blasts of dark energy from its hands, but also gains the power to trap Riku in an orb of energy, inflicting heavy damage whilst Riku is within this orb.

   The Guardian has a grey-black, muscular, humanoid body, standing at eight feet in height with a pair of long, crooked antennae emerging from the top of its head and four shorter ones coming out of the back of its head. The antennae on top of its head have wide bases and become narrower as they become longer and crooked. Its demonic head bares some resemblance to that of
   Master Xehanort
   . It has small, glowing yellow eyes, blue gums, and sharp teeth. Two bandages cross over the top of its head and wrap around its antennae while two more cross over its neck and upper back and two bandages cross over its chest with another two crossing over from its shoulders and attaching a fifth bandage wrapped to the base of its thick neck. It has a blue, heart-shaped hole in its lower torso just below its bandaged chest that is reminiscent of the heart shaped hole that appears in various Pureblood Heartless. It has a shadowy tail that connects into the shadow created at Terra-Xehanort's/Ansem's feet, giving the impression that it is his shadow.
  </p>
  <p key="ea472db1-1eeb-46d5-a166-9a1c8b3982a3">
   When merged with Ansem at the point at which he becomes the World of Chaos, the Guardian becomes titanic in size, standing at approximately sixty feet tall and becoming even more monstrous in appearance. Its antennae become a protective, exoskeleton-like helm of long, jagged, black horns with the two longer horns in the front and two shorter ones in the back. The upper sides of its head are covered with glowing purple scales while the location which its nose occupied previously is covered with dark blue scales. The space around its glowing yellow eyes are ringed with red veins and its helm exposes its sharp teeth and blue gums.
  </p>
  <p key="6a9e3a08-4f20-4389-bf69-0db41cbdb55b">
   The Guardian's arms are longer than it itself is and are covered by what appear to be wide, ragged sleeves that are dark blue at the hem, fade into dark purple at the middle, and are dark green around the elbows. It has two pale yellow "eyes" on its armored chest and a bulbous blue growth lined with thin silver veins on either shoulder. The Guardian's overall appearance is more repulsive, with its upper back muscle, ribs, and vertebra exposed. A yellow ring is connected into its upper back while a similar tube wraps around its shoulders to attack two red, demonic, reptilian heads to the front of its shoulders.
  </p>
  <p key="83bdbc11-82ca-4b7d-b0ca-26a53d597a2a">
   The heads' mouths open up and fill with dark energy when the Guardian prepares to fire an orb of darkness from its own mouth. Its entrails consist of a thick, black cable and six thinner ones with red bases that emerge from the lower part of its hollow torso and connect into Ansem's back. The Heartless emblem once worn by Ansem is now attached to these cables which Ansem can use to seal himself while resting inside the Guardian's chest cavity. The Guardian's tail is now fused into the top of an orange hollow surrounded by a fleshy, red mound shaped in the likeness of a heart with two long pink pillars extending up from it, creating a pilot's seat of sorts.

   the Guardian takes on a new form. It encases Ansem in a sphere of Darkness with itself attached to the top, and a pair of wings flank the side of the sphere.
