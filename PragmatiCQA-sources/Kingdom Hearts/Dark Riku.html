   Dark Riku is physically identical to a younger Riku due to being the Riku Replica from his time in
   Castle Oblivion
   ; sporting the same skin tone, and shoulder-length silver hair. A key difference between the two is the eye color, with Dark Riku's eyes being golden - a sign of him being a vessel for a piece of Xehanort's heart, though Dark Riku lacked this feature in his initial appearance and retained his original aquamarine color.

Retrieving the original Baymax's body from the alternate dimension it was lost in, Dark Riku combines the Darkubes and the combat chip with it, creating

   Like Riku when he gave into darkness and his original self as the Riku Replica, Dark Riku wields the power of darkness, and enters a form known as Dark Mode to channel his dark powers. Outside of Dark Mode, Dark Riku displays the ability to use
   corridors of darkness
   to traverse
   the three realms
   at will, and is shown to have the power to open portals to other dimensions outside of the three realms, such as the alternate dimension where the original Baymax was lost in. He is also capable of telekinesis, as displayed when he sends the Darkubes into the alternate dimension and levitates the combat chip into Dark Baymax.
  </p>
  <p key="7ab942c9-1bfa-493b-b8f2-6e3bf45a4837">
   In combat, Dark Riku’s basic attacks mirror that of his various other incarnations, such as his three swing combo that he follows up with a V-shaped dark shockwave on the ground with his offhand. He is also capable of sending out a slash of energy from his weapon from a distance before rushing his target for a single slash. At times in battle, Dark Riku will use his desperation move, appearing to be a combination of Dark Aura and Helm Split; Dark Riku will rise into the air in a dark aura before warping above and slamming down onto his target, warping back into the air and repeating his slam attack several times before unleashing a swarm of lightning-based spires from the ground on the final slam.

   It should be noted that some of his abilities are identical to Ansem's, albeit color-swapped into a purple color as opposed to Ansem's dark red. These attacks consist of Dark Riku summoning a half ring of crystal mines in front of him, which will explode if anything comes into contact with them, as well as summoning a pool of darkness that homes below his target for a few moments before manifesting into a larger pool of darkness that unleashes multiple dark claws.

   Saïx
   , Dark Riku will relentlessly attack Sora with amped-up attacks seen during his fight in the Keyblade Graveyard, and will mix in unblockable attacks in conjunction with his basic attacks, such as turning the slash of energy he can release from his blade into an unblockable attack. During the fight, Dark Riku will summon massive quantities of his dark mines all around the arena, utilize
   Dark Reflect
   while sidestepping, constantly slam down onto Sora while simultaneously creating unblockable spires of lightning all around Sora, launch more pools of darkness, and unleash powerful shockwaves after his combos in greater sizes than previously displayed.
  </p>
  <p key="e552791d-41de-4ff6-8afb-037e9ada9d7b">
   His most devastating attack is his desperation move Dark Aura, which he can use as early as his first health bar in the fight. Dark Riku will start the attack by raising into the air in an aura of darkness, slamming down onto the center of the arena and creating a shockwave of darkness before warping towards Sora from all directions. While he is doing this, he will summon formations of his dark mines all around the arena and unblockable lightning spires each time he finishes a warp attack on Sora, and will also directly crash down onto Sora, additionally also slamming down into the center of the arena to create more shockwaves as shown at the start of his onslaught. At the end of it all, Dark Riku will close the desperation move by summoning his unblockable lightning spires across the entire arena.
