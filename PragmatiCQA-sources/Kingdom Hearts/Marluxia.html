    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="e600c890-3809-4f58-80bf-9f1defd5328a">
   Marluxia is quite deceptive in nature. He makes an attempt to rebel against the Organization by using Sora as a puppet to accomplish his goals. Personality wise, he is often portrayed as very arrogant and vain. For example, when Axel confronted Marluxia regarding his betrayal to the Organization, he only taunts Axel and leaves Sora to fight the latter. Like Xemnas, Marluxia has a habit of being overly dramatic and giving long speeches. He takes great pride in his appearance. He also flourishes his weapon after striking with it, occasionally leaving himself open, fitting his title in the Organization.
  </p>
  <p key="5ef66790-cfd2-4ec6-a003-68bb8c0ad178">
   During battle, he uses unique tactics like a death counter to represent his devious personality. Also, it seems that by his tone of voice, which is dull and monotone, that Marluxia doesn't pretend to have emotions, like Xemnas or
   Saïx
   , and sticks to his true emotionless nature. However, he does smirk and laugh at some points.
  </p>
  <p key="0d6b58b1-f797-41d3-9fd7-0087e9b78dcc">
   Most importantly though, Marluxia seems to have an obsession with his superiority over the other Organization members. As the lord of Castle Oblivion, Marluxia has the ability to keep many members of the Organization under his own judgment. He even manipulates Vexen into fighting Sora by using Vexen's fear of Xemnas against him. Even though most of Marluxia's personality traits are negative, he does have a few positive aspects. Some of these include his devotion and persistence to succeed in his goals, continuing his plans to overthrow the Organization even after Axel's betrayal and the death of Larxene. He is a very adamant member of Organization XIII. Marluxia believes that he deserves more respect than he is given. All in all, Marluxia is a very egotistical, manipulative member of the Organization, who would stop at nothing to overthrow the Organization and become superior.
  </p>
  <p key="8fd7a1e9-f454-4707-88dd-4eb53218eba2">
   When he becomes a member of the real Organization XIII, Marluxia seems to support in
   Xehanort
   's plans for restoring the balance between light and darkness, and shows to Sora no desire for overthrowing Xehanort. But in reality, Marluxia is fully aware of its simple usefulness as a vessel for Xehanort, and doesn't seem to care much. After being defeated, Marluxia begins to reclaim his lost memories of his life as a human, genuinely thanking Sora for this before ultimately fading away once again.

  </p>
  <p key="bfb14d3f-eae7-48ac-84ea-ad7bf5557f39">
   Marluxia is usually surrounded by cherry blossom petals, which symbolize the transient nature of life and death in Japanese culture. Marluxia drops these petals whenever hit during battle, and fades in a flurry of petals when he is destroyed.

   Saïx
   and Axel used those orders for their own ends. Shortly before being sent away, Marluxia tells Roxas that had they met sooner, Roxas "would have made a fine addition".

   Marluxia, working with
   Larxene
   and for a short period of time, Axel, plots to overthrow the Organization. They formulate a plan to use a young girl named
   Naminé
   , who has a mysterious power over memory, to deceive Sora into thinking he had sworn to protect her, and then have her use Sora to help them defeat the senior Organization members. This plot stems from a rivalry between some of the younger Organization members and the original six core members.

   , Larxene, and Axel all do their part to feed Sora with information and lure him further into the castle. Each of them fight him on their own, although none of them use their full strength and throw the fights. They also make use of Vexen's
   Riku Replica
   , a byproduct of the
   Replica Program
   , to compete with Sora for Naminé's loyalty.
  </p>
  <p key="8f7d83a6-54fa-463a-81f3-f7514b0b2167">
   Marluxia and Larxene eventually learn that Vexen has been reporting back to
   Lexaeus
   and
   Zexion
   regarding their revolt. After Vexen loses control of the Riku Replica, Marluxia pronounces his project a failure. Although Vexen arrogantly protests that Marluxia has no business speaking to him in such a manner, Marluxia claims that his mastery over Castle Oblivion allows him the authority to do so.
  </p>
  <p key="517ecf53-573c-4325-b39c-5ba51d7e5a0a">
   Marluxia threatens to tell "
   the Superior
   " of Vexen's failure, but Vexen pleads with him not to do so. Marluxia agrees not to if Vexen eliminates Sora. Although confused by the order, Vexen agrees, and heads Sora off in the
   Twilight Town
   world. He fights Sora for the second time, but is again defeated. Before he can reveal Marluxia's plans to use Sora, however, Axel destroys him on Marluxia's orders, making Vexen the first Organization member to be eliminated.
  </p>
  <p key="cb02ec45-6f1d-4cc7-83d3-705bebf419e2">
   Axel's assassination of Vexen allows him to gain the full trust of Marluxia and Larxene. As Sora nears the top floors of the castle, Axel is left alone with Naminé to keep watch over her. Instead of keeping an eye on her, Axel allows her to escape, freeing her from Marluxia's control and ending her continued restructuring of Sora's memories, effectively ruining the plot to manipulate Sora into fighting the Organization. This prompts Larxene to attack Sora shortly after he defeats the Riku Replica for the final time, but she is killed in the struggle, leaving only Marluxia to carry out the plot.
  </p>
  <p key="0c555973-6f06-4ea1-ae8d-6763827dcc25">
   Axel then confronts Marluxia, who is disgusted with Axel for betraying him, to which Axel replies that Marluxia is in fact, a traitor to the Organization, and that Larxene paid the price for her own disloyalty. He then threatens to kill Marluxia, but Marluxia seems unfazed by this, stating simply, "You can try". The two then engage in battle, with Marluxia displaying an eerie speed. While they both attack one another powerfully, neither takes any actual damage and appear to be equally matched.
  </p>
  <p key="43ca0ed4-f5f7-44f0-a8c6-d06c239c82ac">
   Marluxia makes Naminé appear in front of him, apparently as a shield to prevent Axel from attacking him further, but Axel laughs it off, saying he's willing to go through Naminé to get to Marluxia. Marluxia, however, tells Sora (who had just appeared in the room, much to Axel's surprise) that Axel was willing to hurt her and vanishes with a laugh, leaving Sora and Axel alone. Axel sneers at Sora for having become Marluxia's puppet after all, but Sora resolves to eliminate Marluxia right after he finishes Axel. The two fight, and Sora comes out the victor, but Axel escapes death and vanishes.
  </p>
  <p key="70746119-637f-4dd7-a390-5cb8068744ed">
   Sora pursues Marluxia into his inner chambers. Marluxia orders Naminé to completely erase Sora's memory and destroy his heart, hoping to rebuild him into something more to his liking afterward. However, Naminé, remembering Sora's kindness towards her, flat-out refuses the order, even when faced with death. Marluxia is perplexed when Sora orders Naminé to do so for her own safety, and even more so when the revived Riku Replica attacks. Confused and irritated that Sora and the replica would accept their memories of Naminé with the full knowledge that they are lies, Marluxia attacks them. Sora destroys Marluxia, but finds that the real Marluxia had been hiding in a back room and that his opponent had only been a clone.

   Seven Guardians of Light

   Grim Guardianess

   Marluxia reunites with
   Larxene
   at the Organization's meeting spot in the
   Keyblade Graveyard
   . He explains to her that the reason they are back, despite their attempt of betrayal, is because Master Xehanort doesn't care who he gets as long as he has the twelve vessels needed to house his heart. This prompts Larxene to ask Marluxia if he wants to attempt another coup, but
   Demyx
   appears, reminding her of their failed first attempt and "Marly's" statement in their roles as Xehanort's vessels. Once Demyx reveals that he was now a reserve member after his spot was taken by a
   replica
   , Marluxia informs Larxene that
   Saïx
   had brought Vexen into their ranks, saying that his completed work with the Replica Program would be able to create replicas that would pass a full-fledged humans and suitable candidates as vessels for the Organization. During their conversation, Xemnas appears, telling the three to allow the guardians of light to continue being mislead by Larxene's claim to Sora that the thirteen darknesses have been fully assembled.

   Marluxia later walks with the rest of the Organization as they confront the guardians at the crossroads of the Keyblade Graveyard, where Master Xehanort would create the Skein of Severance to serve as the battleground of the new Keyblade War. Marluxia soon fights alongside Larxene, Luxord and Xemnas against King Mickey and later Sora in the Trail of Valediction. After Marluxia is defeated, he drops his scythe and collapses onto his knees. Looking at his fading hands, he begins to remember his past as Lauriam and starts to laugh. When Sora asks if his laugh was real, Marluxia confirms, saying that his heart was remembering how to feel. He continues talking with Sora, explaining that he was on the cusp of reclaiming his lost identity and thanks Sora before fading away, making him the fifth member of the real Organization to be eliminated.

  <p key="d6b5646e-cba8-4f66-94f5-0a911ca88d50">
   In his first final form, Marluxia makes use of his mechsuit-like Nobody to slash at Sora with its scythe arms, or charge him and cause massive damage upon impact. He can also summon three petals to fire pink rays and fire blasts of energy from the bottom of the contraption. In the remake, the Nobody is also capable of harnessing darkness with which it can shroud the whole field.

   Marluxia's additional final form in the PlayStation 2 remake brings Marluxia and Sora into combat upon a larger version of Marluxia's phantom mech floating in a starry-night environment surrounded by circulating rings. A large angelic Nobody stands behind him wielding a gigantic version of Marluxia's
   Graceful Dahlia
   . Marluxia is held immobile during this fight by Nobody thorns and is, therefore, unable to dodge most attacks.

   From his stationary position, Marluxia fights mainly by commanding the Nobody, who can create shockwaves, shoot a sweeping laser, blow gusts of wind that prevent Sora from moving forward, and create a whirlwind that scatters all of Sora's cards, including his reload bar. Sora must then pick up the cards in order to reclaim them, including the reload bar. Marluxia's most notable sleight, however, is that in which he shoots Nobody thorns that triggers a countdown timer similar to the recurring

   , Marluxia returns in an optional battle with new tactics. He begins the battle by whispering in Sora's ear, which causes a countdown timer to appear above Sora's head based on his current level, similar to the hit point condition of the Titan Cup, and then spends most of the battle attacking Sora relentlessly with his scythe, with each hit depleting the timer by one, though causing no additional damage.

Marluxia also can conjure black circles which cover most of the floor and deal damage to Sora's HP, but leave the death timer unaffected. Marluxia also wheels around the floor swinging his scythe, can surround Sora with thorns that explode after a short time, and can hover above Sora attacking him with his scythe while making pillars sprout up from the ground and deal damage to Sora.

Once the attack finishes charging and the black ring is completely formed, Marluxia swings his scythe multiple times over a large area on the black ring. During the initial portion of the Limit Break, with a perfectly timed button press, Marluxia will be surrounded in cherry blossoms and may instantly kill any weaker enemy hit by the attack.

   , Marluxia shows a remarkable amount of skill in wielding darkness, as he proved more adept in creating heartless than Xigbar, able to turn the lingering essence of Mother Gothel into the Grim Guardianess whereas Xigbar only created a Storm Ride from a complete being. Along with that, he could power himself and his scythe with energy and then maneuver through the battlefield, slicing through all in his path, before unleashing a large zone of darkness that causes petals to emerge from the ground.

The connection between them is yellow and resembles pieces of the Organization logo. Marluxia attacks with wide slashes and spins. He can also turn himself and his scythe into a lethal pinwheel and fly around the battlefield, causing heavy damage to anyone who cannot dodge out of the way.
