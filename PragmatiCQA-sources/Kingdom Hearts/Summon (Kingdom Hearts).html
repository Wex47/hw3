   Summons are mostly acquired by handing in summon gems to the

The Fairy Godmother uses her magic to restore their spirit forms and release their powers, thus making the summon creatures available. Her magic can restore their spirit, allowing Sora to call them to his aid in battle. Out of a total of six summons two actually join you of their own volition after completing their world.

   Note that in a practical use the offensive summons are generally useless for the early to mid game, due to how their damage and time limit is directly tied to Sora's maximum MP. As your capacity becomes much larger thanks to increased accessory slots, and better
   accessories

   weapons

   's Secret Waterway. Simba costs two MP to summon and uses the Charge Up command, which when released automatically triggers Proud Roar. The way Charge Up works is that you are forced to stand still and wait for Simba's charge bar to fill, signified by the flashes of light on the

   . It can charge up to a maximum of five times, although if you take damage at any point while charging it is canceled entirely. Due to this you likely have to either find a spot out of reach from enemies, or settle for partially charged attacks. Simba's maximum charge level is also half of his max MP, up to five charges (so you need ten MP to use him to the fullest).
  </p>
  <p key="edc9c5d7-4a2b-47d6-8ddb-d406fd7746e0">
   Proud Roar does have a balancing factor, first of all it hits every enemy on the entire map no matter what, making it extremely useful when overwhelmed. Secondly it is capable of dealing immense amounts of damage if you manage to fully charge the attack. At one to two charges it deals no special effects, at three to four it has a critical effect and can also stun enemies, at maximum charge it changes to the gravity element to deal an immense amount of damage. Due the way gravity works it affects a percentage of enemies current HP, and due to the high number you can deal obscene amounts of damage to late-game bosses even if they are highly resistant thanks to their high HP numbers. Simba's summon does not also automatically cancel if his MP reaches zero while you are still using Charge Up.

   Bambi is an optional summon that is acquired after turning in the
   Naturespark
   gem automatically received after completing the
   Pooh's Hunny Hunt
   minigame in

   . He costs only one MP to summon and is the first summon with no offensive capabilities. Instead, Bambi will follow Sora and prance around the area, repeatedly spawning
   MP orbs
   for his entire duration. The orbs dropped depend on your max MP, with four or less only generating small orbs, five or six generating both small and large, and seven or more generating only large orbs. Bambi is primarily useful to be able to saturate the enemy under magic spells, making him of limited use against spell-resistant bosses (and enemies).
   Treasure Magnet
   is nearly mandatory to be able to continue attacking without having to pick up the orbs all the time.

   He also possesses a secondary function through the blue charge gauge, which fills up for each six enemies defeated. Every time it does Bambi will drop a healing item of increasing quality, and for the second and third times he can drop
   Synthesis
   materials. Any subsequent filled gauges produce the same result as the third. The synthesis materials are unique to each world, making them a possible avenue to farm them.

   Note that the required number of enemies has to be slain in a single area as you cannot move to another while Bambi is still summoned. Due to this the actual number of locations is limited, and also somewhat dependent on whether or not you have already completed Hollow Bastion as this drastically changes all enemy spawns and compositions.

    Dumbo
   </a>
   is an optional summon acquired by turning in the
   Watergleam
   gem that can be found in
   Monstro
   's mouth area, after acquiring
   High Jump
   (after defeating the
   Parasite Cage
   for the first time). He costs three MP to summon and grants you control of Dumbo, while Sora shrinks and resides on Dumbo's head. Dumbo flies and can gain air (around High Jump's height) to hit aerial enemies, which he does through the 'Splash' attack by spouting a blast of water from his trunk. The water has the same elemental property as Blizzard, thus making it rather ineffective against bosses due to their innate resistances.
  </p>
  <p key="62451da1-4df0-42e3-933f-854e21e655d1">
   It deals damage equal to the formula of 8 + (max MP × 2), which is rather low. Attacking does not cost MP however, but instead just drains Dumbo's bar twice as fast. You also do not need to hold the attack button, pressing it once will turn it on until you disable it again. Splash also bypasses defenses like a
   Defender
   's shield, and can quickly hit multiple enemies. One benefit to Dumbo is that Sora is invulnerable while he is summoned, but he has little use other than blasting groups of Heartless for free until he dismisses automatically.

   Tinkerbell
   is the second supportive summoning character acquired, and she joins your party on her own after completing
   Neverland
   . She costs three MP to summon and is generally considered to be the most useful thanks to her powerful set of abilities. To start with she is the only summon to not replace any party members, giving you her beneficial powers at no practical cost other than the MP to summon her. Secondly she heals every party member one by one, every two seconds or so, equal to Sora's max MP, ensuring a steady stream of free healing. Lastly, she does this indefinitely until Sora 'dies', at which point she instantly revives him and leaves. Due to her usefulness she is generally considered mandatory against the strongest late-game bosses.

   Mushu
   is the final summon acquired after taking the
   Fireglow
   gem dropped by
   Dragon Maleficent
   to the Fairy Godmother. He costs three MP to summon and, like Dumbo, is the only other summon to disable Sora's personal attack, instead making you attack enemies through his 'Fire Breath' attack. Like Splash, Fire Breath deals fire elemental damage, making it rather useless against bosses. It also has less damage (4 + (max MP × 2), and cannot hit more than one target at a time, and cannot bypass defenses like the aforementioned Defender's shield. It somewhat makes up for it by presenting a far higher rate of fire, and thus damage output.
  </p>
  <p key="8286e582-f139-4e33-b3ac-d20fa29cb6ce">
   Each fireball costs 0.06 MP, which amounts to Mushu's MP draining about twice as fast when the attack is used continuously. The fireballs will arc and attempt to hit moving and aerial enemies, but you do need some distance to accurately hit foes, much like the normal Fire spell. The extra distance also helps in evading enemies, as the attack requires you to stand still.
