  <p key="418fb22f-33fc-4ff0-92f2-7fdd36bc369d">
   Lexaeus is the most undeveloped member of Organization XIII: that is, not much is known about him. What is known, however, is that he is intelligent, cold and laconic, only speaking when he finds it necessary. He is fearless and assured of his power, as he patiently waited for Riku on the upper floor of the Castle’s basement, confident enough to confront him alone and head on with no trickery or subterfuge.
  </p>
  <p key="627611e0-744a-4d40-809b-53c859437150">
   His taciturn nature is shattered in battle as he growls, roars, and howls like an animal when unleashing his true strength.

  <p key="28cbe907-799b-4898-9d14-bec0c2c1e2ed">

   He's probably the most physically powerful member of the Organization. He displays incredible strength; enough to bodily throw both Sora and Riku as rag dolls. This is further shown in one scene in the novel where Axel begins trying to lift Lexaeus's tomahawk to tease him. When this happens, however, Axel (who is a fairly strong member) struggles to lift it up with both arms and remarks that it "weighs a ton" before Lexaeus effortlessly lifts it up with one arm. Another example of this is after Riku's battle with Lexaeus; even after taking such a beating, he was able to send Riku flying all the way to the ceiling of the room. On the other hand, he appears to be somewhat distrustful of the other members of Organization XIII, and is willing to step in to silence fights between the others.
  </p>
  <p key="e89157e6-43dc-4b7a-9a7a-c5d69ecaed6a">
   It's also known that he's incredibly loyal to Zexion to the point that he can even be called Zexion's henchman due to Zexion's role as the mastermind whom decided to use Riku to counter Marluxia. This is demonstrated as he readily obeys Zexion's orders and before he dies he remarks, "Forgive me... Zexion".
  </p>
  <p key="e3bcf3a4-ee87-4e98-845b-9ddf73bdf93a">
   He may also be considered as being friends with
   Zexion
   , as shown when Vexen and Zexion are arguing. On this occasion, Lexaeus quickly takes Zexion's side and criticizes Vexen's attitude, displeasing the other Nobody. They are also seen together many times; almost all of Lexaeus's appearances in
   <i key="f842f9b4-9b4c-45a2-9066-54bc67b25efd">

   are with Zexion, furthering this implication. Also, in the
   Secret Reports
   , he stated that Zexion is the only member in Castle Oblivion that he can trust.

His hair is ginger and slicked back into messy spikes.

After learning the true extent of Marluxia's plans to make use of Sora's power by deceiving him into feeling complete loyalty to Naminé, thereby turning him into her puppet, they decide to counteract this plan by making similar use of Riku.

Lexaeus then takes matters into his own hands, and the Nobody appears to Riku shortly before Sora confronts Axel and Marluxia at the top floor of

In the updated version though, the battle is close, and subsequently Lexaeus barely manages to overpower and knock Riku unconscious. However, Riku's defeat allows Ansem, Seeker of Darkness to take control of his body, and he swiftly vanquishes an unsuspecting and already weakened Lexaeus. It is in this moment that Lexaeus realizes whom he was fighting and as he passes away, he apologizes to Zexion, lamenting that this was a fight he should not have started.

   Lexaeus is exceptionally strong physically, as shown when he is able to knock Roxas into critical health just by whacking him over the head. He uses earth to reinforce his attacks. He regularly strikes at Riku using his enormous Axe Sword, and can hurl it into the air only to have it come down and flail about the combat area. He can also throw the Axe Sword directly at the foe, which boomerangs back to him. He also has the ability to force a rock out of the ground before shattering it, leaving the pieces to fly around and damage the enemy. Like several other Organization XIII members, Lexaeus has the ability to levitate, which is one of the few magical abilities he displays.

He is incredibly tough and does not flinch from Riku's attacks after powering up, even becoming temporarily invincible if allowed to.

   , Lexaeus has a Limit Break called Ayers Rock. During Ayers Rock, Lexaeus can perform a charged attack. Once the Limit Break begins, Lexaeus can charge his energy, as shown by a red aura around him; he then can release the stored energy in a powerful 180-degree swing, dealing devastating damage to the target. The attack is then followed up by a shock wave. The longer the player charges before releasing this attack, the stronger the attack will be. Depending on the amount charged, this attack can even be performed twice before obtaining Final Limits.

  <p key="ce4e5697-2adb-481b-b2dd-12693f256efe">
   Alternatively, the player can choose not to charge this attack at all. If so, Lexaeus will perform a less powerful swing attack with his weapon. This can be done several times during one Limit Break.
