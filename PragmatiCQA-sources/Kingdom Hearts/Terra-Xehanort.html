   As one of Ansem's apprentices, Xehanort appears to have had a very professional and no-nonsense attitude, shown by his determination in his studies. He appeared to be easily annoyed by Braig and was shown to be equally as interested in the darkness of hearts as his original incarnation, possibly because he had enough Darkness in his Heart from both his former lives to be tempted into conducting the experiments. Xehanort appeared frustrated when Ansem forbade him from continuing his studies and experiments, and ultimately disobeyed his master. Ansem the Wise later refers to Xehanort as "foolish" and that any world of his "would be an empire of ignorance". Some of his personality can be inferred by one of the interactions Xemnas had with Sora. When Sora asked Xemnas if he remembers having more emotions than just anger and hate when he was human Xemnas responds with "Unfortunately I don't." This could infer that Terra-Xehanort was an angry, hate filled man.

   Following the loss of his memories and now going by the name "Xehanort", Terra-Xehanort's supernatural abilities allowed him to become one of Ansem's apprentices alongside Braig. Though at first thinking the amnesia was an act, Braig intended to help his benefactor by aiding Xehanort in taking advantage of Ansem's research of darkness that lingered within the hearts of people.

   Xehanort offered to use himself in the experiments, the first attempt unlocking some of the memories relating to Xehanort as he and Braig manipulated Ansem the Wise and the other apprentices to go deeper into the research. To that end, they abducted countless people and locked them within the depths of the laboratory where they are subjected to the horrible experiments, with Xehanort and Braig using the experiments as a method of controlling the mind to force it to reject its sense of self. Around this time, Xehanort discovered a unique test subject named "Subject X", an amnesiac girl who, like Xehanort, had no memories of her past. Xehanort planned to use her in his experiments in unlocking lost memories through traversing the heart, though he kept thinking over his decision to use her, as he did not wish to lose a specimen as valuable as her.
  </p>
  <p key="b7388b0d-8d60-4ef5-8fe1-2fe416bb7990">
   One day however, Subject X mysteriously disappeared; her disappearance prompted Ansem the Wise to shut down their research and release their remaining subjects. Due to this act, Xehanort believed that Ansem the Wise had personally hid Subject X away from him, though he was unaware that it was in fact Braig who was responsible for Subject X's release. Nonetheless, Xehanort continued his experiments in secret, using himself once again as his own test subject in place of Subject X. However, his secret projects would eventually lead to the accidental mass creation of

  <p key="39076616-af94-4022-98e2-28c70a3dc258">
   At this point, Xehanort had taken Ansem the Wise's name as his own and wrote his own report under this stolen name. Xehanort then began to observe the behavior of the Heartless, using a machine to artificially create Emblem Heartless and having them increase their numbers with living things while stepping himself in darkness to control them. Despite Ansem learning of his actions and ordering a halt to the experiments, Xehanort continued and eventually found the heart to Radiant Garden by chance.

   Soon Radiant Garden became shrouded by darkness and everyone was scattered across the universe. During this, Kairi was captured by Xehanort, after she was cornered by a group of Heartless. Xehanort told Kairi that their world was about to fall to the darkness, and that the only way to save it was for Kairi to assist him in an experiment. He told Kairi that he was under the suspicion that she was one of the Princesses of Heart, and as such, he was going to propel her off world to test any possible connection between the Keyblade wielders and the Princesses of Heart, and if the experiment is a success, Kairi's heart would resonate with a keyblade wielder's heart, which would lead Xehanort to that wielder's world. Just before Xehanort sent her on her way, he warned her that if the experiment fails and she ends up "somewhere on the other side", then she was to abandon her search.

   after arriving at the Keyblade Graveyard, Terra-Xehanort would confront them under the guise of Terra, although Aqua sees through his disguise and demands for him to let Terra go. After revealing his true status as a possessed Terra, Terra-Xehanort explains that it was the day they would fall, and that they would have their hearts torn from their bodies, though he reassures them that the χ-blade would still be forged. Summoning his Keyblade, Terra-Xehanort attacks the group, but is soon blasted away by Donald's Zettaflare, though not before Terra-Xehanort was able to wound Ventus and Lea during his attack.

As they continued their fight, Terra-Xehanort soon summons the Dark Figure, who grabs ahold of the Lingering Will by its helmet. Raising the Lingering Will into the air, Terra-Xehanort uses the Dark Figure to begin crushing the Lingering Will's helmet, though he is soon interrupted by a forming glow of light below him; from the light emerges a time-traveling Sora, who was seeking to revive

   Upon being mocked by Sora that he wasn't the only one who could travel through time, Terra-Xehanort soon fights the boy in a brief skirmish, though he soon uses the Dark Figure to subdue him. Preparing a finishing blow with his Keyblade, Terra-Xehanort is nearly successful in killing Sora, though the Lingering Will pushes Sora aside, causing it to instead take the fatal blow as it crumbles to pieces on the ground. With the Lingering Will dead, Terra-Xehanort explains to Sora that now that he has taken the forbidden path, he too must be ready to make the ultimate sacrifice before engaging Sora in a real battle. Despite losing, Terra-Xehanort is able to one-up Sora by summoning the Dark Figure to once again subdue him. Mustering a surge of darkness, Terra-Xehanort consumes Sora into darkness.

   After Vanitas interrupts their moment and reveals what he truly was, Terra-Xehanort explains to Ventus that if it was darkness he was seeking, then he has more than enough to go around. Upon hearing this, Aqua angrily summons her Keyblade and points it at him, telling Xehanort to stop using Terra for his games, though Terra-Xehanort merely calls her act of aggressiveness "shameful" due to her position as a Keyblade Master. Relenting, Aqua explains that they still have unfinished business as a result of her banishment to the Realm of Darkness, saying that with all her heart she seeks to cast Xehanort out of Terra forever before engaging him and Vanitas in battle with Ventus at her side.

   As the fight continued, Terra-Xehanort and Vanitas gain the upperhand, though Sora soon arrives to back Aqua and Ventus, causing the scale of the battle to tip in the guardians' favor. Following Vanitas's defeat, Terra-Xehanort is also defeated as a spire of darkness emerges from him, causing him to collapse onto the ground. As it seemed Terra was beginning to retake control of his body, he soon lets out an agonizing scream as darkness surges from him, creating an entanglement of dark chains that imprisons Sora, Aqua and Ventus.

   As Xehanort regains control, he prepares to finish off Aqua and Ventus, but they are unexpectedly saved by the Dark Figure, who breaks the chains and frees them. Shocked by this, Terra-Xehanort is swiftly subdued by the Dark Figure, who grabs him by the face before ripping off the bandages covering its own face. As the Dark Figure speaks, revealing itself to be a containment vessel for Terra's heart, Sora quickly blasts and stuns Terra-Xehanort from behind with his Keyblade, giving Terra's heart enough time to emerge from the Dark Figure and launch into Terra-Xehanort. In the process, the time-traveling heart of Terra-Xehanort is sent back to its rightful place in time, thus allowing Terra to finally regain control of his body. As a result, Terra-Xehanort becomes the seventh member of the real Organization to be eliminated.

Terra-Xehanort also possess superhuman strength, able to effortlessly lift Aqua off the ground by the neck with one hand, effortlessly knock out Ventus with a single blunt blow from his Keyblade, and easily break through Lea's block while also launching him with enough force to knock him out, and his durability and resilience are at enough levels to be able to take a blast from the Lingering Will's Ultima Cannon without any damage.
