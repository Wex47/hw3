Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura did this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination.

   series contains both 3rd-person fighting and role-playing game elements. The games are driven by a linear progression to the next story event, usually told in the form of a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. Furthermore, there are allies to aid the main character, Sora. The allies in play rely fully on A.I. controls, though players could later modify and customize their ability usage frequency. The combat system takes on real-time, meaning Sora could engage the enemy directly with various actions, such as attack and magic, which are executable during or after the battle.

The real-time combat system was also taken away, where the scene flashes whenever Sora engages an enemy, taking them to a wider combat field.

   At the top of the castle, Sora and his friends battle Xemnas, who uses the remnants of Kingdom Hearts to fight them. Refusing to accept defeat, Xemnas separates Sora and Riku from the others to fight them in a final battle that ends with his demise. Though trapped in the Realm of Darkness, Sora and Riku are able to return to their world via the Door to Light, which was mysteriously triggered from Sora's heart. Reunited with their friends, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy return to their world. However, while reviewing the journals, Jiminy finds a shocking discovery.

   Following the journal's debugging, Mickey and Data-Sora find the source of the sentence: it was a message from Naminé. She had integrated a data version of herself into the journal to inform Sora that he is the "Key that connects everything". Showing images of those with deep ties to Sora's heart namely the real Naminé, Roxas, Xion, and Axel, Data-Naminé explains the message is related to three figures tied to distant past: Terra, Aqua and Ventus. Soon after, Mickey also receives the news from Yen Sid that the destruction of "Ansem" and Xemnas has led to the return of Xehanort and will eventually bring back Master Xehanort. Yen Sid orders Mickey to summon Sora and Riku to him to undertake a Mark of Mastery Exam to properly combat Xehanort. On Destiny Islands, receiving Mickey's letter, Sora and Riku make the decision to venture out to find and rescue their predecessors.

   By that time, in the Realm of Darkness, Aqua stumbles across Ansem the Wise, who survived the explosion of the Kingdom Hearts Encoder, which sent him there. Ansem, with few of his memories remaining, fills Aqua in about his experiences with Sora, which brings Aqua to tears of joy, believing Sora will come and rescue her and her friends.

   Riku and Sora are summoned to Yen Sid, who tells them about the threat of Master Xehanort and that they would need the individuals (Terra, Aqua and Ventus) who King Mickey mentioned in his letter. In order to save them, they must unlock seven sleeping keyholes inside the Realm of Sleep, where a few worlds that were supposed to be released from darkness when "Ansem" was defeated are in a state of rest. As Sora and Riku start their journey, ending up in Traverse Town, they learn that world has been split in two by a hooded man and remain separated from each other. While travelling to many worlds, they eventually meet this mysterious figure, who can summon past figures like Xemnas and "Ansem" from the darkness.

   Meanwhile at Radiant Garden, Lea, Axel's original persona, is restored along with Ansem's apprentices. However, only Braig and Isa, the original selves of Xigbar and Saix, have not returned. As Lea resolves to track his friend and Braig down, Mickey receives Minnie's tiara from Diablo and he returns to Disney Castle where Maleficent unveils her plan. Lea appears, driving Maleficent off before asking an audience with Yen Sid to receive a Keyblade.

   After all sleeping worlds have been restored, Sora and Riku are called into the World That Never Was, where Sora learns the mysterious figure is actually a youthful incarnation of Xehanort from an alternate timeline. Before being captured, Sora learns the true purpose of Organization XIII from Xemnas and Xigbar: to collect ideal vessels for Master Xehanort's heart. However, when the plan failed, Young Xehanort uses his temporal powers to gather various incarnations of Xehanort from across time to create a new Organization to represent the "13 Darknesses."

   Riku and Mickey confront this Organization while rescuing Sora, witnessing Master Xehanort's return prior to him revealing how the events of Sora's adventure were all arranged so that the 13 Darknesses collide with
   Seven Guardians of Light
   in a fool-proof plan to create the x-blade and trigger a new Keyblade War. Though Riku was supposed to be the 13th vessel for a piece of Master Xehanort's heart, his ability to contain darkness forced Xehanort to use Sora, as both his Nobody was a member of the previous Organization and he possesses Ventus's heart. But at the last second, Lea comes to the rescue with the new Organization XIII taking their leave. After Riku travels inside Sora's heart to restore him, Yen Sid names him a Keyblade Master while Sora returns to the Realm of Sleep to attempt the Mark of Mastery once more. With Lea offering to aid them in fighting Xehanort, Yen Sid has Riku bring Kairi to him in order to train her in using her Keyblade.
