   , he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura did this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He stated that with speculation, even though a game gets old, people can still be happy with it.

   series contains both 3rd-person fighting and role-playing game elements. The games are driven by a linear progression to the next story event, usually told in the form of a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. Furthermore, there are allies to aid the main character, Sora. The allies in play rely fully on A.I. controls, though players could later modify and customize their ability usage frequency. The combat system takes on real-time, meaning Sora could engage the enemy directly with various actions, such as attack and magic, which are executable during or after the battle.

   the combat system was altered as Sora is no longer aided by his friends, and all of his combat commands are only executable via Cards. The real-time combat system was also taken away, where the scene flashes whenever Sora engages an enemy, taking them to a wider combat field.

However, when Xion is revealed to a replica created from Sora's memories, Roxas defected from the Organization after doubting their true motives and desiring to meet Sora in person. However, being reprogrammed, Xion is made to attack Roxas who is forced to mortally wound her. Entrusting Roxas with her being and Keyblade, her memory in everyone slowly fading, Roxas attempted to go after Xemnas. However, Roxas encounters Riku who succumbs to the Darkness inside him and takes on the appearance of Ansem. With his newfound power, Riku subdues Roxas and takes him to DiZ, but the ordeal leaves him stuck in Ansem's form. With their plan successful, DiZ orders Riku to eliminate Naminé, but Riku refuses, and instead lets Naminé go with Axel.

She had integrated a data version of herself into the journal to inform Sora that he is the "Key that connects everything". Showing images of those with deep ties to Sora's heart namely the real Naminé, Roxas, Xion, and Axel, Data-Naminé explains the message is related to three figures tied to distant past: Terra, Aqua and Ventus. Soon after, Mickey also receives the news from Yen Sid that the destruction of "Ansem" and Xemnas has led to the return of Xehanort and will eventually bring back Master Xehanort. Yen Sid orders Mickey to summon Sora and Riku to him to undertake a Mark of Mastery Exam to properly combat Xehanort. On Destiny Islands, receiving Mickey's letter, Sora and Riku make the decision to venture out to find and rescue their predecessors.

But at the last second, Lea comes to the rescue with the new Organization XIII taking their leave. After Riku travels inside Sora's heart to restore him, Yen Sid names him a Keyblade Master while Sora returns to the Realm of Sleep to attempt the Mark of Mastery once more.
