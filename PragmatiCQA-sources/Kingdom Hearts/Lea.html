   Having been best friends with Isa, even though such relationship was deeply strained after they became Nobodies due to Isa changing deeply, with the remnants of their old bond at the time terminated, albeit not without some conflict on Axel's part, by his friendship with Roxas and Xion, after being revived, Lea displays his capacity for kindness and empathy and good heart by forgiving their old grievances seemingly without problems, looking for him when he disappeared and looking unwilling to fight him after he is revealed to be a Seeker of Darkness. He appears to feel responsible and blames himself for how his former friend had fallen because of him abandoning him just for Roxas and Xion, displaying he does not believe in favoritism and felt sincere regret for not trying harder to reach out to what remained to Isa inside Saïx, and still considers him a dear friend to the end, vowing to bring him back to the light like with both Roxas and Xion, trying his best to reason with him when they finally fought and expressing nothing but sympathy for his old friend's plight as he died.

Even though Saïx believes that she and Roxas are gone forever, Lea promises he will get all his friends back, including him. Saïx notices Lea's upside-down tear markings are missing, which have stopped him from crying. Lea then scoffs and claims he doesn't need them anymore. Before Saïx disappears, Lea guarantees beating him the next day during the final battle.

Fortunately, Sora manages to rescue everyone's hearts with the Power of Waking and they soon return to the Keyblade Graveyard.

   and throws them at hooded figure to try and learn their identity, though they soon summons their Keyblade and deflects them. Lea is confused as to how the figure can summon the Kingdom Key, and wonders if it is Roxas. Saïx denies this, calling Lea "Axel". Hearing these two names simultaneously causes the hooded figure to charge towards and attack Lea, only to be blocked by Kairi, who promptly knocks them back. With that, Xemnas takes his leave as Lea and Kairi soon engage in combat against the duo, with Lea personally fighting his former friend, intent on keeping his promise to beat him.

   As the fight went on, they were only able to match Saïx even when he wasn't using his Berserk Mode, and when Sora comes, Saïx responds by using his Berserk Mode to overpower them as Lea tries in vain to reach out to him. As Sora and Kairi are almost finished off by Saïx, Lea attempts to defend them, demanding Isa to stop fighting but is pushed back. Suddenly, Xemnas appears and condemns Lea for betraying them when he used to eliminate traitors. He almost finishes off Lea until the hooded Keyblade wielder stops him, claiming they need him alive. Xemnas clarifies saying they only need his heart, not his soul, and since they were former friends Xemnas passes on the task. Despite being beaten and injured, Lea wanted to know who the hooded figure is, who struggles to strike him down. Sora decides to calmly intervene, pleading and reassuring the figure whom he refers to as "Xion", who becomes overwhelmed. Unsatisfied, Xemnas kicks her, pulling back her hood revealing her face, causing Lea's memories of Xion to surface. As Xemnas attempts to kill Xion, Lea tries to stop him by hugging his leg, but is unable to stop him. A heart then escapes from Sora and Roxas suddenly reforms, much to Lea's joy.

   Sora then leads the charge against Xemnas, but he and Kairi are trapped in spheres of nothingness by Xemnas, forcing Xion to team up with Lea and Roxas to take both Xemnas and Saix down. Incapacitating Saix with a powerful cooperative attack, the trio strike Xemnas and take the Recusant's Sigil back from him, as it was the foundation of the bond for thier friendship. With Sora and Kairi free, the trio face Xemnas again; however, the Superior flees, kidnapping Kairi and leaves the four to fight Saïx. Xion tells Lea to rest due to his injuries; Roxas and Xion fight along Sora's side. After defeating Saïx, Lea goes over to him and was asked why he appears sad and that he thought Lea didn't need the markings under his eyes as it looks like he needs them. Lea is disgusted at that Saïx let the Organization reduce him to this state and says he thought everything was for their missing friend. Saïx confirms that he did sacrifice everything to find her, but when Lea made other friends it angered Saïx and he as a result lost all sense of purpose. Lea reassures he didn't forget them and Saïx agreed Lea wouldn't be that type of person. Before fading in Lea's arms he admits of being jealous and they will meet again in life. After making amends with his friendship with Isa, Lea tells Sora to go find Kairi. Being finally reunited, Xion, Roxas, and Lea embrace each other and cry tears of joy.

   Frolic Flame

   Bond of Flame
   Keyblades, with a handle similar to his chakrams and a flame-shaped blade. Proving to be a remarkably powerful fighter with his weapon, he displays superior fighting skills and might than Kairi, able to seemingly stalemate a non-berserk Saïx while holding back, and could push back Xion whereas Kairi had trouble doing so. He was also able to react to both Terra Xehanort's attack, which not even Ventus was able to, and the Berserk Saïx's attack, although he wasn't able to block them properly and was knocked down by the impact. Lea later proved able to fight against Saïx in his Berserk Mode long enough to be backed up by Roxas and Xion. His fighting style revolves around wielding his Keyblade in its guard hilt, skillfully spinning it with his hand to unleash swift combos, and he could willingly change his Keyblade into the Eternal Flames at will.
