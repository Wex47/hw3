   The
   Keyblade War
   has ended and
   Player
   (the playable customizeable character) was saved by
   Ephemer
   and
   Skuld
   . The Player is now brought to a new realm. Per
   Foreteller Ava's
   instructions, the
   Dandelions
   have assembled. After entering the realm however, it is discovered that all but five have suddenly lost their memories. These five are declared as the new leaders of
   <a href="Union.html" key="2b1e306f-b3ab-4d74-a8c3-89e08c43c142" title="Union">
    Union
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p key="6cc4b7a7-f63f-41c4-951f-82004cb22ead">
   Ephemer ventures to the
   Keyblade Graveyard
   and is soon joined by Skuld. Skuld is surprised that he was even nominated and Ephemer is having his own doubts of being a Union leader as well. They are joined by
   Ventus
   and welcome him to their newly assigned ranks. While waiting for the other leaders, the three discuss their appointment and even Ventus appears surprised to be named. Ventus admits he is a bit jealous of the friendship Ephemer and Skuld share, but they readily assure him that they consider him a friend as well. Having overheard the conversation of friendship,
   Brain
   , the fourth named leader arrives but is expecting to be the last to show. Ephemer explains there is still one missing. Brain asks Ephemer if he is meant to lead the group, but Ephemer replies that a group lead would not be decided until all five were together.
  </p>
  <p key="f8d4d768-1a3e-4672-b12d-4d7a7bdb86b3">
   Ava has placed rules for the group to follow and Brain inquires as to their validity. He doesn't agree with all of them, specifically one that requires them to lie to the Dandelions. After thinking about the pain the Player endured due to the Keyblade War, Ventus admits he shares Brain's concerns. Ephemer iterates that the rules must be followed and the truth in regards to the previous realm and war must be kept secret if for no other reason than to keep others from feeling the pain of what occurred. Brain, Ventus, and Skuld agree and share a trust in in Emphemer. They wait together for the fifth leader to arrive.
  </p>
  <p key="114c92be-1d92-4651-998e-b5a647dd472a">
   The Player relives the events prior to those of the Keyblade War through missions. They join a party of Dandelions and travel to new worlds. The Player is soon haunted by a nighmare in which they relive the battle lost to
   Foreteller Aced
   . They see themselves collapsed on the ground at the end of the Keyblade War. Upon defeat, they are jolted awake. Chirithy expresses her concerns for the Player's frequent nightmares and advises them to rest. Chirithy watches over the player as they drift back to sleep.
  </p>
  <p key="2487eca7-5f27-4787-ac2f-c3c22a7a8aa1">
   Strelitzia
   , who was a witness to the Player's battle with Aced, has been asked by Ava to be the fifth and final leader in the Union. Strelitzia is concerned in regards to those left behind during the Keyblade War and remembers that Player is not a Dandelion and realizes that Player would not know about the coming dangers. The next day the two search for Player in an abandoned house but come under attack by an unseen assailant who defeats them and steals Strelitzia's rule book. Strelitzia holds Chirithy sad knowing that she will never have a chance to meet the Player themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="e5e48a07-6fc6-4724-aedc-9351966c5380">
   The four Union leaders are still waiting in the Keyblade Graveyard when
   Lauriam
   arrives, claiming to be the fifth leader. He apologizes for being late, stating he had been searching for something. The five head for the Foreteller's Chamber in Daybreak Town. Brain finds and peers through a copy of the
   Book of Prophecies
   . The Foretellers including Ava are absent, but regardless, the group decides to stay together and create
   Spirits
   to celebrate. Ephemer, Skuld, and Ventus set off to find supplies while Brain and Lauriam prepare to create the Spirits upon their return.
