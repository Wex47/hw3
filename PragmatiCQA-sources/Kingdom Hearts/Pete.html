  <p key="c48b8d06-2797-4ca8-ad1f-3f25d2f79fd0">
   Pete is very mean, selfish and, shown at various points, cowardly. He tends to get scared in the presence of characters with overwhelming power, or in situations of being outnumbered. He serves as dumb muscle for Maleficent for most of the series and is quite loyal to her, although his cowardice interferes from time to time. He has the tendency to run at the mouth, bragging and insulting, even with characters such as Hades.
  </p>
  <p key="ae4b3b71-4fcb-4111-ac7d-df5ebe5f6266">
   Although Pete appears incompetent, his heart has strangely been strong enough to resist the darkness and is one of the sneakier villains in the series. This is shown first in the Underworld where he tricks Sora into opening the Underdrome by losing a fight to Sora. This suggests that Pete is smarter than he lets on. (This fact is even supported by Axel in

   , he wears a heavily modified version of his usual outfit in the modern cartoons; in Pete's case, suspenders and a shirt. He wears what seems to be armor colored in shades of blue and purple overtop a red, short-sleeved shirt with a vertical pink stripe descending from the neck. He wears navy blue and white sneakers with light blue fronts and two periwinkle straps keeping each one secure. His pants are also navy blue, with light blue lining, purple lower legs, and two enormous pouches on either front side.
  </p>
  <p key="f14c1186-c840-47c3-82a6-7ef4add35eac">
   These pouches are attached to his pants by four pins, both sporting a silver, horizontal zipper. The most distinguishing feature of these pants is the comically large zipper going down the front and reaching around to the backside of the pants.
  </p>
  <p key="77fba79f-c73b-4191-9e7d-2d6a9039895f">
   He wears two navy blue pauldrons, each sporting two cyan bumps and a periwinkle area near on the lower section on each shoulder. Two gold buttons at the top of Pete's pants connect to two blue suspenders that intersect over his chest before connecting to two similar, albeit smaller buttons on his shoulder pauldrons. Pete also wears a pair of fingerless gauntlets. The wrists of these gauntlets are light blue with a pale yellow semi-circle on top, while the gloves are periwinkle with a bump on each knuckle. There is a dark blue-green design on the back of each glove, descending from each knuckle to the end of the glove.
  </p>
  <p key="b9300361-8bbb-452e-9c1e-3beb048bb5c1">
   Oddly, unlike all other characters to visit the Timeless River, his outfit remains largely unchanged, apart from becoming monochrome, probably because there already was a Cap'n Pete in that world.
  </p>
  <p key="8d2bf9fd-f082-4fdf-9eae-9432381a5805">
   As Captain Justice, Pete dons a white jumpsuit with gold highlights and two large, orange lightning bolt patterns on its front. He has a black undershirt, orange straps on his upper arms, and an orange cape pinned to the shoulders of his jumpsuit. His gloves are white, gold, and black with a silver band around each of his wrists. His boots are black with silver soles, gold straps on the legs, and orange lightning bolts decorating them. The upper half of Pete's face is covered by a white mask with a red arrowhead bent into a shape resembling the letter "P". He also wears a teal belt with silver pins lining it and a red and yellow buckle. The buckle is a stylized version of the letters "C" and "J".

  <p key="2028fee2-0011-490b-973c-ac766c60c6b3">
   As Captain Dark, Pete wears a nearly identical outfit, albeit with a different belt buckle and color scheme. His jumpsuit is now black with red highlights and purple lightning bolts decorating it. The straps on his arms are lavender-colored, his cape is violet, and his gloves are red and black. His mask is black, but retains the red and yellow "P" symbol. Pete’s boots are also black with red straps and purple lightning bolts on them. His belt is red-violet with a violet and silver buckle. This buckle resembles a stylized version of the letters "C" and "D".

   , Pete worked as the captain of a steamboat. His deck hand was none other than the future king of Disney Castle, Mickey Mouse. This past association causes Pete to refer to Mickey as "the Boat-Boy King". Unlike his current self, this Pete was more innocent and good-natured, despite his temper. However, he was also far less intelligent, unable to even recognize his future self.

Captain Dark and Captain Justice are supposed to be two different people played as Pete who are entering into the Million Dreams Celebration in Disney Town. The goal is to get as many popularity votes as possible to win the

Pete also uses the pose of Captain Dark, a Rumble Racer. It is unknown why Pete would use an alter-ego that is supposedly evil in order to gain votes for the Million Dreams Award; though it's possible he thought a rogue but daring persona would garner fans. In addition, Pete also remodeled part of the underground beyond the Gizmo Factory into a giant human pinball machine, with a Captain Justice mural, turning it into

When Queen Minnie says that some people do care for him and that he got their votes, Pete says that he doesn't care for their "lousy" votes; he just wants the prize, then is taken away by a squad of "security"
   Brooms
   . He is sent into the dark realm by Queen Minnie where he hears Maleficent's voice telling him that she can free him if he helps her conquer the worlds. She then opens the dark corridor and Pete walks into it and vanishes from his prison. Because of this incident, Pete can be considered a prime example of those who turn to the darkness.

   Pete is capable of throwing explosive bowling balls at his opponents. He can also use fireworks to immobilize his opponents. In Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep and Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, Pete is also shown to be capable of using bombs which he uses as long range weapons.

   Other magical talent is shown when he somehow conjured a portal to the Past while reminiscing, a surprising feat for Pete, and he evidently has a strong Heart as he is likely able to use the Corridors of Darkness to travel the Worlds to gather Heartless without being strained by the Darkness. He also seems to have some power of teleportation as when he appeared alongside Maleficent to stop the Heartless and allow Sora and his friends to continue on to battle Xemnas. And he obviously has above-average strength, and unlike Maleficent, was strong enough to resist the darkness.
