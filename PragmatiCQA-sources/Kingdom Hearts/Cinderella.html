   Cinderella has been known to be a very hardworking and honest young woman, who is skillful in doing multiple house chores each day and cooking as she constantly serves her stepmother and two stepsisters. She is not afraid to speak her mind and her dreams to her mouse friends, yet is completely passive and obedient to her step-family right until she goes to the ball.

She is shown to have unwavering patience and perseverance that has helped her, even when her first dress was destroyed by her stepmother and stepsisters and she seemed to have lost all hope. It was her strong belief in her dreams that allowed the Fairy Godmother to come and help her get to the ball.

Instead of just forbidding her to go, they told her if she finishes all her chores and finds a dress to wear that she could go, but kept adding more chores to keep her from being able to. Her mouse friends encouraged her by secretly stealing different accessories to make a dress for her while Cinderella finished her chores.
