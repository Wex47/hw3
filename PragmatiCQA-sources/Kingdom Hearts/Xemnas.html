    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="dd854061-23f4-4c73-82a3-4adc9f96dce7">
   Being the founder of Organization XIII and apparently the oldest of Nobodies, Xemnas is truly emotionless, in every sense of the word, and does not even remember what it was like to have any feelings. He claimed that this allowed him to have a clear understanding of the heart, but, in reality, this had warped his mind into believing that only anger, hatred, and other negative emotions were what make up most of a heart.
  </p>
  <p key="60a4f15b-c9d4-499a-a769-3aa2bfbc9c81">
   His lack of emotion deprives him of remorse for his actions, as well as the loss of the other members of the Organization. The only thing he truly cared about was Kingdom Hearts and his desire for power, and even lamented it when it was damaged. However, on some occasions, he had appeared to value friendship, as he was shown to converse with the armor of
   <a href="Aqua.html" key="69fbde58-aa0e-434b-9c0b-913a662ca9bc" title="Aqua">
    Aqua
   </a>
   in the Chamber of Repose, although, this is likely due to the influence of
   Terra
   , as he is, in a sense, Terra's Nobody.
  </p>
  <p key="b76f82ec-d2a3-4e92-a8fe-bf940b5f4813">
   Unlike the other members of the Organization, Xemnas did not seem to want Kingdom Hearts for a true existence. Rather, much like
   <a href="Ansem, Seeker of Darkness.html" key="2d9ac83a-9992-44e7-8510-7c97a76a9f50" title="Ansem, Seeker of Darkness">
    his Heartless counterpart
   </a>
   , he wanted it to use it to obtain power and remake the universe in his image. This concept was furthered as Xemnas thought that nothingness was the source of much power, and does not seem to despise it in the slightest. This goal stemmed from that of one of his two original personas, Master Xehanort, whom also desired to unlock Kingdom Hearts for the same purpose in

   .
  </p>
  <p key="57bb8aa9-65e2-46ce-a477-486951f59dae">
   In other matters Xemnas spoke with calmness and deep authority, strangely similar to
   Master Eraqus
   . He had a tendency to be overly melodramatic, making long-winded speeches, exaggerating his false rage and sorrow with wide sweeping arm movements and hand gestures, like many villains. While ridiculous in nature, his exaggerations were representations of his lack of emotion. He was very intelligent, overall, and knew how to manipulate others, particularly Sora and his friends for his own needs.
  </p>
  <p key="7049c8e2-eba4-437f-84c7-c9c93e4f1d9d">
   He can be surprisingly honest and open at times, as when confronted by Sora shortly after the first clash of their final duel in the World That Never Was, Sora earnestly declares that a heart is more than suffering and rage; and asks if Xemnas does not remember that; he responds honestly, and quite wistfully, that he does not.
  </p>
  <p key="d920ae84-fa6b-4e79-82bc-23a9529b6755">
   Xemnas' personality seemed to share traits from both beings who composed his original persona, Master Xehanort and Terra. From the former he inherited his manipulative nature and the ideas for the black coat and adding the letter "χ" to rename himself and his fellow Organization members.
   It is very hard to say how much he inherited from Terra, but there is at least the familiarity with Aqua's armor, to which he refers to as a "friend", and his strong desire to find his
   other "friend"
   in Castle Oblivion, as he has had Saïx and Axel search for the Chamber he sleeps in. Another example was when Roxas fell into a comatose state, saying: "So, sleep has taken you again".
  </p>
  <p key="99867ceb-19f2-4bfc-ae71-0d2029c04a1e">
   After being defeated one last time, Xemnas, accepts his defeat with dignity, and while lamenting that he was bested again, finally regains his emotions and realizes that he misses his companions and that he took them for granted. Due to his newfound feelings of loneliness, Xemnas states that a heart is just about pain but when Sora counters that pain is a part of being human, Xemnas gives the boy a praising smile for being strong enough to live on.

    Physical Appearance
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="86058e33-61fc-45b5-a150-43757ec0c8ed">
   Like all the Organization members, Xemnas wears the standard black coat, gloves, and knee-length boots with silver trimming and high concave indentations in the top. He has orange eyes and tanned skin, much like his Heartless counterpart, though he later gains golden eyes to signify him harboring a piece of Xehanort's heart. Xemnas's hair is long, reaching to about mid-back, silver in color, and some of it falls over his shoulders. His hairstyle is reminiscent of Xehanort's hair, including his bangs, the color, and the length. It also shares traits with Terra's hair, including its layered, messy look and the spike on the top of his head.
  </p>
  <p key="27a7a005-e56f-446f-8399-e6d0ff664eb2">
   Because Xemnas was born from the body of Terra, his overall appearance is identical to Terra's, save for the silver hair, orange eyes, and older appearance resultant from having Xehanort's soul.
  </p>
  <p key="e9cabf80-70dd-4c74-aef2-f19561d71f49">
   While commanding the World of Nothingness, Xemnas dons armor adorned with dozens of Nobody symbols. The shoulder pad on his left shoulder, helmet, crown, boots, knees, and breastplate all sport these designs. His crown and shoulder pad are gold, while the rest of the armor is colored in light shades of blue and silver. He has two silver belts on his waist and what seem to be white feathers on his right shoulder in place of armor. Several cords crisscross in front of his torso, connecting to massive, oblong pieces of armor worn on each arm. Xemnas's faceplate is beak-like in structure and he wears clawed, metal gloves.
  </p>
  <p key="fe7cefea-d7cc-4ac9-98cc-605072184164">
   He also wears black pants underneath the armor. Perhaps the most striking features of this armor are the odd, pulsating growths sprouting from Xemnas's right shoulder and both arms. These growths appear organic and are a mixture of red, orange, yellow, and white. While the larger one on his shoulder seems to connect Xemnas to his dragon-like Nobody battleship, the other two on his arms just lie on the ground, seemingly serving no purpose. This armored form, referred to as the Armored Controller, bears a striking resemblance to

  <p key="c548b6f1-4055-4d92-b2ed-d5c0abf7a306">
   In his final section of his battle with Sora and Riku, Xemnas's appearance is unchanged, save for his cloak. His black coat is now white and is covered with intricate black designs that resemble the Nobody sigil.

   </a>
   that this was due to Xehanort's willing abandonment of his heart.
   While Xehanort's Heartless took the name Ansem, Seeker of Darkness and traveled to the past to tell his original incarnation's past self of the plans in store, his Nobody remained in the present and took the name "Xemnas", as it was the anagram of Xehanort's stolen name "Ansem" with the Recusant's Sigil added. Xemnas soon formed Organization XIII with the Nobodies of the other apprentices, with the goal of creating their own

   in order to complete themselves. In actuality however, Xemnas' true motive for the Organization was to prepare suitable vessels for

   .
  </p>
  <p key="ea116bda-e168-4af3-a217-99a857cac64a">
   At some point Xemnas discovered that even though they had cast their hearts aside, the Nobodies of Organization XIII started to reform hearts of their own out of their memories and interests, thus making their roles as vessels problematic. Xemnas and
   Xigbar
   decided to lie to their fellow members who thought they were having feelings again, believing that when their Kingdom Hearts is completed it would not matter if they had hearts as they would be replaced with a version of Xehanort's heart anyway.

Sora asks who the man is, and Goofy wonders if it is Ansem, and though Xemnas says he is familiar with the name, he refuses to clarify his identity. He then launches an energy attack at Sora, who manages to deflect it (with some difficulty). Xemnas remarks how Sora looks like "

   Afterwards, he backs off, appearing to be defeated, but quickly abandons the facade. He finds Sora fascinating, and says that they will one day meet again and disappears, but not before making an ambiguous comment on how he is but "

   Dark Margin
   in the Realm of Darkness, telling him of his time with Sora. Roxas asks just who he is, but Xemnas only explains just

   As a back up plan in case neither Roxas or Sora could be of use, Xemnas uses his

   to dispatch the traitors, somehow knowing Marluxia and Larxene are the traitors. However, while successful in eliminating the traitors, Xemnas' plans falters as even the loyal members stationed at Castle Oblivion were all eliminated and Naminé escapes. With Vexen's death, Xemnas is unable to advance the Replica Program in order to do Xion's development and his plans are forced to depend on Xion's well-being. He places Axel in charge of capturing her whenever she tries to escape to find out who she really is, and would later continuously send Axel back to Castle Oblivion to search for the

Roxas gradually feels remorse for what he is doing on the behest of this group and questions their motives and loses trust in them when he sees how people with hearts live and what Xemnas is ordering the Organization to do to them. At one point, Xemnas and Roxas had a conversation, where Xemnas reveals to Roxas about Sora's existence and Xion's value before having him return back to his duties. When Xion learns of her true nature as a

  <p key="181f12c1-910c-45b9-a97d-dfbf964aa7db">
   However, Xion is defeated as she dissolves back into the memories she originally was while pleading with Roxas to stop Xemnas with her dying breath. Roxas, emotionally shattered and having seen enough of the Organization's treachery, goes to

   While this would actually benefit Xemnas, as even with Roxas's full power, Xemnas is still stronger and would defeat and once again use Roxas for his goals, although it remains unclear why did he not choose to just directly confront Roxas directly when he arrived in The World That Never Was despite knowing fully well he is the only one in the Organization capable of capturing Roxas, unfortunately, Xemnas is unable to face Roxas as Riku defeats Roxas by using the powers of Ansem, stopping his suicidal plan to take on Xemnas, and takes him to DiZ to be sealed in a digital replica of Twilight Town. Deeming Xion a failure as mostly all memory of her existence is negated, although strangely despite his lack of care for her he managed to retain his memories about as long as Riku and Roxas did, Xemnas discontinues the Replica Program and orders Axel to bring back Roxas or kill him.

The former pupil mocks his teacher, stating that he is the source of all Heartless and the one who inspired Xehanort to go where Ansem himself did not dare to venture. Though Ansem admits that fact though his intentions was pure, he asks what Xemnas seeks from all the suffering he caused.

Once Sora and the others travel up to the very top of the tower, Xemnas asks the three Keyblade wielders to fetch him more hearts to repair the damage. But when they refuse, Xemnas goes into a philosophical debate with them over light and darkness and then the rights of those who are nothing. But as Riku and Sora refuse to believe the false sincerity he expresses, Xemnas admits that feels no remorse for his actions and proceeds to face Sora one on one in an arena of nothingness, with Memory's Skyscraper towering above them.

After they defeat him, they are somehow transported back to the tower with King Mickey and Kairi.

He says that if both light and darkness are eternal, then so too must be nothingness. Riku and Sora say this is true but refuse to accept Xemnas to be eternal himself. After a very intense battle, Xemnas manages to badly injure Riku before Sora batters him into submission with both his and Riku's Keyblades before the two unleash a beam of light from Sora's Keyblade, piercing Xemnas through the chest. After being defeated, Xemnas fades away in a flurry of Nobody thorns and darkness, making him the final member of Organization XIII to fade away.

Though Xemnas' own scheme failed, with only Xigbar and Saïx undergoing the process and the other members either being killed or growing desires of their own, he took precautions to recreate the Organization through the temporal abilities of Young Xehanort to gather various incarnations of Master Xehanort and fill the vacant ranks.

   that the thirteen darknesses have been assembled to Marluxia and Demyx. Xemnas tells them to continue the charade, as this would merely cause the guardians to become unprepared and careless, though when Demyx makes a nonchalant remark, Larxene questions why he was a member in the first place. Xemnas reveals that the first six members of the original Organization were all apprentices to Ansem the Wise, with the seventh and eighth members joining shortly before the Organization's creation. After explaining that the thirteenth member, Roxas, was a Keyblade wielder, Xemnas asks why they think he chose numbers nine through twelve to the trio, and after Larxene's answer is shot down, Xemnas reveals that they were all chosen for another purpose. Luxord soon appears, shortly questioning Xemnas on their new gathering apart from old time's sake, to which Xemnas reveals that they all share a similar trait; they possess an ancient Keyblade legacy that slumbers dormant within them.

   Xemnas later walks hooded with the rest of the Organization to confront the guardians at the crossroads of the Keyblade Graveyard before Master Xehanort creates the Skein of Severance to serve as the battlegrounds of the Keyblade War. Xemnas soon gathers with Luxord, Marluxia, and Larxene in a section of the Trail of Valediction to combat Mickey, though Sora soon appears to assist his friend. Knowing the tide of the battle has drastically changed, Xemnas soon levitates behind his forces, creating a barrier of Nobody thorns around the arena to prevent the heroes from escaping. After the trio of darknesses are forced back by the two guardians, Xemnas sends a blast of energy into Luxord, granting him a power boost as the barrier around them retracts. After chuckling, Xemnas warps away.

   Xemnas soon appears alongside Saïx and Xion at a section of the Twist of Isloation, where he introduces Xion to Lea and Kairi, the former still without any memories of Xion. Once Xion sparks the conflict between the two factions, Xemnas momentarily departs from the area until Saïx is able to weaken Lea, Kairi and Sora, the latter arriving shortly in the battle. Xemnas manifests beside Saïx, where he berates Lea on his betrayal in the previous Organization as Axel, and soon attempts to kill the young man himself after viciously assaulting him with a dome of ethereal energy. However, Xemnas is stopped from dealing the fatal blow by Xion, who explains that they need him alive, though Xemnas counters this claim before ordering her to kill him instead. This however is stopped by Sora, who reignites Xion's memories from within his heart, causing her to emotionally break down. Unsatisfied, Xemnas kicks the two down and prepares to kill them both, though Roxas' heart emerges from Sora, acquiring a replica body from

   After explaining his return to Xemnas, Roxas and the others attempt to clash against Xemnas, only for Sora and Kairi to be imprisoned in spheres of nothingness by Xemnas, leaving Roxas, Xion and Lea to fight him and Saïx. However, Xemnas is defeated by the trio, who recover a physical representation of the Recusant's Sigil from him to reinforce their bond. Knowing he was outmatched, Xemnas abducts Kairi from the group of heroes, remarking that while they have other lights, the Organization also have more darknessess to replenish their ranks before warping away with Kairi, leaving the remaining heroes to fight Saïx.

   As Sora advances to the Tower of Endings and meets with Riku and Mickey, Xemnas appears before them with Ansem and Young Xehanort. Sora questions Xemnas on what he did with Kairi, though Xemnas merely chuckles at his question. Master Xehanort soon reveals that nine keys have been created from the battles, and only four remain in order to complete the χ-blade, saying that they will soon be produced before sending his Heartless, Nobody, and younger self onto the trio of guardians. After being defeated, a spire of darkness emerges from Xemnas, who laments on being defeated once again. Sora explains that he knows Xemnas has a heart, asking what he feels and whether or not it was all worth it. Xemnas reveals that he feels the emptiness of where his companions once stood, admitting that he took them all for granted, and because of it, he has nothing; for the first time in years, the first surge of emotion he felt was loneliness. Due to this, Xemnas claims that a heart is nothing more than pain, though Sora reassures him that pain is being human; Xemnas soon realizes that it must take incredible strength to bear such pain as he fades away, his heart returning to the past whence it came as he becomes the eleventh member of the real Organization to fall.

   As the leader of Organization XIII, Xemnas is the most powerful Nobody in existence, far more powerful than even the other members of the Organization, as even the arrogant Marluxia, who is himself a powerful member of the Organization in his own right, would not dare to fight him even alongside Larxene and Axel. It has also been confirmed that he is even stronger than Roxas at his full power,
   which was why Xion was so desperate for Riku to stop Roxas as she knows Roxas isn't strong enough to fight Xemnas and Riku himself stated that going after the Kingdom Hearts is suicide as it means fighting Xemnas and Xemnas would destroy Roxas. He is particularly feared by Vexen, the weakest member of the Organization, to the point of not daring to interrupt his time in the Chamber of Waking and the mere mention of Xemnas being enough to cause the high-ranked scientist to back down. Even Saïx, who is Xemnas' second in command and one of the most powerful members of the Organization, does not seem to be willing to fight him alone despite knowing of Xemnas' true plans and even with
   Axel
   , who is also a powerful member of the Organization in his own right, he still chose to operate in secrecy and recruit Xion and Roxas before challenging him. Xemnas is also the only one, apart from perhaps Saïx, who even Axel fears, who has been shown to be unafraid of facing other high-level members of the Organization such as Marluxia, Saïx, and Xaldin, therefore reluctantly going after Xion and Roxas when Xemnas ordered it.

   As the most powerful and oldest of the Nobodies, Xemnas, in addition to having his subordinates' ability to fly and teleport, wields the power of Nothingness. He uses this to form his personal weapon by solidifying beams of Nothingness into blades of energy called Ethereal Blades that act to his will, allowing him to manifest and de-manifest them at whim and change their length, which he can either wield in close combat like real swords, not needing a hilt or handle to hold them or fire them as laser-like projectiles, either from his hands directly or suspending them in mid-air first. He can make as many as he wants, even creating thousands as his desperation attack. Xemnas is also capable of using Nothingness to cast energy balls capable of exploding into orb-like force-fields as well as firing powerful lasers, which he can do from all directions. He can manifest a barrier capable of damaging Sora and use the barrier offensively by having it rush towards Sora or using it to trap him.

   , Xemnas' limit break named All-Vanity consists of Xemnas summoning a barrier around himself that is impenetrable and can damage any enemy that touches it. Xemnas's Final Limit retains his barrier but Xemnas also creates two large powerful lasers from his hands that he fires around himself at a long-range that can heavily damage any enemy. His control over Nothingness also allows him to turn even other Organization members into Dusks or destroy them if he wants to and he has absolute control over all other Nobodies, specifically the Sorcerers.

   , Xemnas replaces his previous darkness and light-empowered hand-to-hand attacks with a Nothingness empowered swift spinning kick and he could release fissures of blue energy with his Ethereal Blades. He even proved able to effortlessly dematerialize Lea's Keyblade with a single surge of Nothingness. He also displayed the ability to empower Luxord with Nothingness, project twilight thorns to shield himself and cover an arena as well as trap Sora and Kairi in a sphere of nothingness. His Limitcut replica uses his barrier in formations to damage Sora upon contact and block his attacks and repel him and could use twilight thorns for attacks as well as project a burst of energy from his hands.

  <p key="bb2db5a6-efc5-4cc2-86de-5079391496ef">
   In addition to Nothingness, Xemnas naturally has power over darkness and in addition to the basic ability to open
   Corridor of Darkness
   , he is one of the few Organization members capable of employing darkness in combat, able to encase Sora in a sphere of dark energy to slowly drain his health, surround himself in a ball of dark energy and move around at incredible speeds, and even generate enough darkness to cover the entire arena, doing so in his secret boss and final form. With the powers of Kingdom Hearts at his disposal, Xemnas not only gains stronger powers over darkness but also gains the powers of light, allowing him to generate thorns of black and white energy, summon crests of light able to fire beams of white energy and empower his kicks and punches with darkness and light, causing them to emit either shadowy or white energy.

  <p key="36bd59a8-20d5-42c4-bec7-63b2dab51897">
   Xemnas appears to have the ability to create pocket dimensions at will that he can control to his whim, as shown by how he warps himself and Sora while leaving the rest of his enemies in his castle to a realm of nothingness where only the Memory's Skyscraper stands and later on when he summons a small alternate dimension to ensnare and torture Axel by firing lasers all around him. While merged with Kingdom Hearts, it seems his "creation" ability becomes much more potent, as he is capable of creating an actual realm within Kingdom Hearts named the World of Nothingness and also manifesting a large dragon ship equipped with powerful laser-firing barrels as well as creating Bomb Bells and Spiked Rollers to guard the inner function of his ship and also to attack. He conjures and launches buildings and snowflake projections capable of firing lasers and even at one point generates a black hole to swallow Sora and Riku's ship. He also was capable of shapeshifting into a form for his final battle that gives him a robe that represents both light and darkness and greatly increases his power and allows him to create clones of himself. Even without having the powers of Kingdom Hearts, Xemnas still retains the ability to summon and launch buildings at Sora.

   While facing Sora and the rest in his armor, Xemnas wields a large sword capable of dealing great damage with a single swing and by slamming it to the ground, he can generate a shockwave capable of pushing Sora and Riku away a great distance.

   In all his battles, he displays outstanding agility and athletic prowess as well as excellent swordsmanship and martial arts skill, capable of unleashing relentless barrages of attacks from both his Ethereal Blades and even unarmed that are hard to block, preferring swift spinning kicks but also able to deliver powerful quick roundhouse punches and his Limitcut replica could launch Sora into the air and knock him down with just his hands and legs. In terms of speed and agility, he is shown to be easily equal to, if not, superior to Larxene. Not only is he shown to be able to trade blows with Sora in his regular form, but in his final form, he is even able to overtake and disarm Sora as well as fight off both Sora and Riku when Sora had regained his weapons along with fatally injuring Riku before finally being defeated. His greatest feat was easily catching Lea's Keyblade strike by its handle to prevent it from slashing him one-handed. He also easily repelled a coordinated assault from Roxas and Xion and afterwards managed to fight off Kairi despite being surprised before eventually using his powers to subdue her.

They are solid despite their appearance, and, despite seemingly lacking a cutting edge, are wielded like swords. The Ethereal Blades can also be used as projectiles and can suspend themselves in midair around a target before firing at them. As a desperation move, Xemnas can surround his enemy in darkness and fire an amazing amount of Ethereal Blades at them. Xemnas displayed superb prowess in swordsmanship using them, performing many swift and acrobatic combos with them.
