Unlike the other villains, she cares about her minions, the "poopsies", treating them as almost like sons or beloved pets. She is very protective of them and becomes enraged and vengeful if they're killed in combat, to the point of a psychotic hate.

   Ursula is an obese cecaelia (a mythical being with the upper body of a woman and the lower body of an octopus) with lavender skin. The top side of her octopus half is pitch black and reaches up over her chest, resembling a shoulder less, backless gown. The underside is a bright violet color, while Ursula's short hair is stark white with a few grey streaks that stands on end. She also sports a widow's peak hairline. She wears various forms of make-up, including purple nail polish on her pointed nails, light blue eyeliner, dark purple eye shadow, bright red lipstick, and seemingly penciled-on black eyebrows. Ursula has a small beauty mark near her chin on the left side of her face.
  </p>
  <p key="5142475c-3b19-498d-a7fd-4a7c14991f6e">
   She also wears a yellow
   spiral shell
   necklace on a thin black cord, as well as two violet,
   thinner spiral shells
   as earrings, one on each ear. Despite being based on an octopus, Ursula only has six tentacles, as opposed to an octopus's eight. This was a change made in the original movie,
   <i key="96b9862d-de8f-4d9b-93b8-4298256faa4a">

   , because it would have been too expensive to animate eight tentacles.
  </p>
  <p key="658e9f0a-42a2-4c9b-ba25-e0a039a4417d">
   When disguised as Vanessa, Ursula takes the form of a thin, fair-skinned young woman with long, black hair. She wears black shoes, pantyhose, and a navy blue and sky blue dress. She also wears red lipstick and a yellow seashell - which contains Ariel's voice - as a necklace. Her attire is very similar to the clothing Ariel wears as a human.
  </p>
  <p key="67e10daa-1940-4c93-b5ba-0b8e6573ad1f">
   Despite her underwater nature, Ursula is seen being able to survive when sitting on the council of Disney villains.

She would not let Flounder go, unless Ariel gave up the trident.

She used the trident to become a giant, just as she did in the first game. Sora and friends battled her and won.

   without the Heartless and Maleficent on her side. She told Ariel that she could help her be with
   Prince Eric

Ariel agreed, and signed a contract with Ursula which stated that: if Ariel was able to kiss Eric before the sunset of the third day, then she could stay human forever, but, if she didn't obtain a kiss, she would turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. After Ariel signed the contract, Ursula took Ariel's voice (the price for Ursula's spell) and turned the princess into a human girl.

   After three days had passed and Ariel still hadn't obtained a kiss, Ursula turned herself into a human girl (Vanessa) and used Ariel's voice to hypnotize Eric, taking him away from Ariel. Sora and the others saw through Ursula's disguise and broke the amulet in which Ariel's voice was being kept, thus releasing
   Eric
   from her grip and returning Ariel's voice. But it was too late, the sun had set and Ursula dragged Ariel into the sea with her.

   King Triton tried to stop Ursula, but not even he could break the contract, so King Triton signed over Ariel's name and took her place. This allowed Ursula to have possession over the Trident once again, and she used its power to become gigantic one more time. With the trident, Ursula turned King Triton into a lowly sea creature.
