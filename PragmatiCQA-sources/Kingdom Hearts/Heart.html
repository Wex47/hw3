   The heart appears to be responsible for the composure of memories, will, goals, and ambitions, as is the case in the transfer of
   Master Xehanort

   Terra

  <p key="18144013-7db9-40a7-b7ac-6da0feb72c08">
   The heart is also responsible for emotions, as beings lacking one, such as the Nobodies, cannot feel emotions. Still, the members of
   Organization XIII
   seem to be able to feel emotions, as shown by
   Axel

   According to legend, the worlds were one and united through the light in people's hearts. Once these hearts became filled with darkness, however, chaos resulted, and the worlds were separated. It was the light that remained only in the hearts of children that would keep the worlds in existence before they were shrouded in darkness completely.

   Scholar Ansem the Wise was struck by a great curiosity of the heart and its true nature. He began research on the topic so he could better protect his world from the forces of darkness, together with his six apprentices, and started to write his reports. However when Ansem realized that his experiments could bring disaster to the world he stopped all his research.
  </p>
  <p key="34eb9b71-26e7-4b9a-9e9a-28c4445a7c9d">
   However Xehanort decided to continue the experiments and realized that when hearts were seduced by darkness, a creature he dubbed a "Pureblood Heartless" was born. He made note of how Heartless acted on instinct, and wished to try creating his own Heartless. To tell them apart from the Purebloods, he dubbed them "Emblems" and christened them with what would later become the Heartless insignia. He made note of how they behaved relatively the same way, continuing to experiment in other areas with which the heart was concerned.
  </p>
  <p key="4375d142-7da4-4e32-8388-6fcf6af255d1">
   He had no idea that he had caused chaos to brew. However when Ansem became aware of Xehanort's activities, he ordered that his research be stopped at once. This strict request would lead to the birth of Xehanort's Heartless and Xemnas, as well as the rebellion of Ansem's other apprentices. Xehanort and the other apprentices' Nobodies would later grow to form Organization XIII, a group that had the sole purpose of unlocking the secrets of the heart.
  </p>
  <p key="ae08dbae-7f97-4ace-9500-bde832d75a54">
   While Ansem was cast out into the Realm of Nothingness, Xehanort wrote the Ansem Reports. After he put his research and his findings to paper, these reports scattered across the worlds, and were able to help the residents of Traverse Town and Sora in his first journey when it came to learning about and fighting the Heartless. Ansem's experiments on the heart would continue to haunt him even after his escape from the Realm of Nothingness, throughout the story of
   <i key="acbcb248-4156-4321-b617-a82d6b0cdb56">

   , as his reports continued to spawn as the Heartless he had created returned.
  </p>
  <p key="b4b4cd06-bb8d-4e4b-a29d-c621c722e451">
   He was forced to recall his past mistakes and even failed to succeed in avenging his dignity, realizing all his experimentations had gotten him nowhere. Upon his supposed death, which instead erased the majority of his memory and sent him to the

   , were sought by beings of the darkness who wished to rule the Heart of all Worlds, particularly Maleficent and Xehanort's Heartless. Kingdom Hearts could only be accessed by the completion of a Keyhole in Hollow Bastion, which required all seven pure hearts to be joined as one in the Keyblade of Peoples' Hearts. These hearts were released, however, due to Sora keeping Kingdom Hearts out of the villains' reach.

   A cherished element throughout the Kingdom Hearts series, hearts possess many unique powers and abilities. It is for this reason that antagonists seek them. Hearts are able to produce emotion, something that members of Organization XIII crave. As shown with

   Hearts are also able to merge with others or be split, as seen when both
   Master Xehanort
   and
   Master Eraqus
   join hearts with
   Terra
   , and when Ventus's heart merges with Sora's. A much later instance of this would be Kairi's heart merging with Sora's during his first journey. They can be split to produce an embodiment of either the light or the darkness, as seen when Master Xehanort produces Vanitas by unlocking the darkness of Ventus's heart. Hearts can also be merged to create unique Keyblades, major examples being the
   χ-blade
   and the

   The heart also has a heavy influence on all that lives, having the power to produce Heartless and potentially Nobodies at its loss or corruption by darkness. As the heart grants emotion, negative emotions formed when Vanitas and Ventus were split caused the Unversed to spawn, hence their connection to the heart.

   When a particularly strong heart is turned into a Heartless, its body begins to act of its own accord due to the strong will it possesses. This being is called a
   Nobody
   , a being which does not truly exist. Depending on the strength of the heart, the body may or may not be warped. Members of Organization XIII all possessed remarkably strong hearts, causing their Nobodies to retain a human appearance. Due to a lack of a heart, however, a Nobody cannot truly feel emotions and in Organization XIII's case they pretend to in order to achieve their ends, that being to finally be whole again by obtaining a heart.

   When a Heartless and Nobody are defeated the heart, soul and body are reunited leading to the reformation of the individual. The individual will gain the Nobody's memories and abilities. Depending on the individual the darkness is purified from the heart leading to the restoration of the original personality; Lea, Dilan, Even, Ienzo and Aeleus were restored to their original personalities while Isa apparently remains corrupted by the Darkness.

   , Organization XIII's heart collection process was greatly elaborated. While on several missions to various worlds, Nobodies of the Organization would seek out as many Emblem Heartless as possible, obtaining a captive heart from those they defeated. The captive hearts would then be absorbed by Kingdom Hearts, more specifically,

   While Xemnas planned on having Xion absorb Roxas so he could have the full power of Sora's Keyblade in the end, he desperately wished to reclaim Roxas after Xion was defeated when Sora's Nobody fled the Organization. He did not count on Roxas being captured by Riku in the Nobody's attempt to free Kingdom Hearts so he could revitalize Xion. This forced Xemnas to use Sora himself as an alternative.

Sora remained unaware of his role in Xemnas's plan, sending captive hearts to Kingdom Hearts as he saved each world from the Heartless threat. When

Hearts released in the 13th Floor of Castle Oblivion, a true "world" even though it was accessed by a card made of Sora's memory, were most likely absorbed for this exact reason, the fact that they were the only true hearts in the entire castle.
