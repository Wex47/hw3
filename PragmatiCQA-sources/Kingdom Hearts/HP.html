    the Magic and Hit Points would reach the same point together, indicating that they have reached their maximum level. However, in

    , it can be noticed that the HP and MP meters will not always reach their maximum at the same length.

    In each game, the numbering system for HP differs: the actual numerical values relate to the HP bar in the HUD on-screen.

    versions are the only exceptions because they all share the same numbering system.

    In some games higher difficulties affect the maximum HP a character can obtain. For example, in Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix's Critical mode the maximum HP is 60, while it is increased to 120 in easier modes. This is due to the HP bonuses in Critical mode being halved.
