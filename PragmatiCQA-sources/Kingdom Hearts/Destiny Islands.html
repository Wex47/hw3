Riku though, is not aware of this, and soon finds a bottle floating in the water which he picks up. Ansem the Wise approaches from behind, stating that Riku was not the visitor that he had been expecting. Riku expresses curiosity regarding Ansem's presence in Sora's heart. Ansem the Wise explains that he wished to atone for the mistakes of the past, and so he had digitized himself and his research and hid them within Sora. He states that the data may act as a clue to help find themselves or their lost friends in their hour of need.
Ansem talks about the malleable nature of the heart, and relates the tendency of the heart to grow quickly to the nobodies of Organization XIII, giving Riku a clue that the Organization's members may have had hearts of their own. He also discusses Sora's ability to return to his human form without destroying

Ansem suggests that perhaps Sora has the power to recreate people that had been thought to be lost forever, and to mend connections that had been broken; this is due to the uncorrupted and caring nature of Sora's heart. For this to be achieved, Ansem states that Sora needs only to follow where his heart leads him, and the rest of the information needed is in the data. Riku thanks Ansem, before being questioned by the older man as to why he is on the islands. Riku explains that he needs to wake Sora up; Ansem finds this amusing, and then explains that by defeating the

Riku realizes that he had never told DiZ his name, and quickly responds with it, before leaving the islands.

The two are then spontaneously transported out of the area in a flash of light, leaving the remnant of the world behind. 
A short time later, Aqua is separated from Mickey and re-enters the world via the same door in the Secret Place in the company of a second Demon Tide. She is reinvigorated by her meeting with Mickey and also with Terra earlier in the story, and gains an inner strength to continue fighting for the greater good inside the Realm of Darkness. She asserts that when someone else comes to the dark realm, she will be there waiting. After her fight with the second Demon Tide concludes, Aqua lies on the beach staring upwards as the clouds move rapidly across the sky. The sky changes to night and light particles begin to fall from the sky. Aqua realises that the fallen worlds have been restored and is swept into the darkness as Destiny Islands returns to the Realm of Light. As she falls, she reaffirms that the heart should be the guiding key, and also that "they" will know where to find her. While traversing the Realm of Darkness, Aqua and Mickey stumble upon the remains of Destiny Islands as they had appeared at the End of the World. Aqua recognizes the islands as the location where she met Sora and Riku, and whereupon Terra bestowed the power of the Keyblade to one of them. Mickey deduces that this means that they are close to the location of the

   </a>
   , and thus proceed to the Secret Place. When they approach, however, the Demon Tide returns and attacks, forcing Aqua and Mickey to battle. After seemingly vanquishing it, Aqua and Mickey approach the door in the Secret Place and open it. Within the door lies the Kingdom Key D, which Mickey subsequently claims as his own.

   During an attempt to protect Riku and Mickey from the Demon Tide, Aqua is thrown through a door to the islands' remains, which subsequently seals behind her. Finding her resolve, Aqua continues the fight on Destiny Islands while Mickey and Sora seal Kingdom Hearts.

   In the ending, Aqua is seen lying on the shore and staring up into the blue sky, which subsequently turns into nightfall. As she gazes into the stars, droplets of light begin raining down, indicating that Kingdom Hearts has been sealed and that Destiny Islands is being restored. Aqua, unable to leave the Realm of Darkness, falls off the disintegrating shore and drifts into the darkness.

    it's implied Destiny Islands has a slightly faster time flow than other worlds; a least one day passes between Terra and Aqua visiting. When Terra arrived, Riku and Sora were leaving for the day. Aqua arrived shortly afterwards, but Sora and Riku weren't initially there until a bit later.
