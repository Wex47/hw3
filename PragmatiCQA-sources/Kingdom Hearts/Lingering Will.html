   As the Lingering Will is truly an inanimate object, it cannot feel or possess a personality of its own. Since it was brought to life by Terra's discarded thoughts and emotions, however, it is able to "feel" a strong hatred towards Xehanort, a close connection and devotion to Aqua and Ventus, and a familiarity with Riku and Sora.

   The Lingering Will is an animated suit of armor. The helmet is mostly gold, except for the visor, which is black, and it sports two red prongs, one on either side of the helmet, that point straight up. The arms, legs, and ribs of the armor are black and have orange patterns decorating them. Its knee guards, gauntlets, breast plate, and armored boots are gold, and there are other, smaller pieces of gold armor on its legs.

   It wears black pauldrons with gold edges. The front of the armor on the Lingering Will's torso is red, as are small pieces of armor on its lower legs and gauntlets. It also wears gold anklets with red spikes on the back that curve upward sharply.

   Eleven years later, a portal to the Badlands in the
   Keyblade Graveyard
   mysteriously appears in Disney Castle. Sora,

   proceed to enter the portal and find the Lingering Will in the same position as it had been left in. It mentions Aqua, Ventus, and the Keyblade. It then mistakes Sora as "

    the one he had chosen

  <p key="3f63ebcf-9636-484b-858e-7a130e65d622">
   Then it wonders if Sora is Xehanort, slowly pronouncing the latter's name, before finally rising up as it did once before to attack him. Sora fights back and wins the battle, and the Lingering Will merely kneels down again after this, saying that he once felt the power Sora possessed. Sora can return for rematches against the Will, which agrees to fight, but it is unknown if the subsequent rematches are canon.

   As Terra-Xehanort confronts the

   right after they arrive at the Keyblade Graveyard, the Lingering Will arrives unexpectedly after being discovered and tipped off by

  </p>
  <p key="79f0fa76-5884-46a6-8f8b-ff38f67073f0">
   The fight between the two eventually ends up below the real Organization's base in the badlands, where the Lingering Will proclaims that Terra-Xehanort must be stopped at all costs. However, Terra-Xehanort summons the
   Dark Figure
   shortly into their continued battle, who grabs the Lingering Will by the helmet and begins to crack it. However, Sora, who was time-traveling from the events after the Keyblade War in search of

   , appears from a pool of light below the two, forcing the Dark Figure to dematerialize while freeing the Lingering Will. Once Sora reveals he wasn't the only one with the power to travel through time, he engages Terra-Xehanort in a short battle, though Terra-Xehanort once again summons the Dark Figure, this time behind Sora in order to subdue him. As Terra-Xehanort readies a finishing blow to the head with his Keyblade, the Lingering Will jumps in the way and pushes Sora asides, causing it to instead take the fatal blow as its helmet shatters, causing it to fall apart completely as the discarded armor pieces fade away.

   other secret bosses, is difficult to defeat; its most basic moves are attacking with its Keyblade,

    Ends of the Earth
   </a>
   , using a combo attack almost identical to Sora's, though it instead turns its Keyblade into a drill-like object for the forward thrust combo finisher, and can fly at very high speeds. Its main abilities are transforming its Keyblade into various attacking forms.
  </p>
  <p key="c996c221-33a8-45cc-9385-d0bad179a6ac">
   It can turn it into a whip that does less damage than the blade form, but its greater speed and range makes up for it. In addition, the Lingering Will can also use Terra's Ultima Cannon
   <a href="Shotlock.html" key="d639ae42-3dcb-40a8-bbc8-1625ade739e1" title="Shotlock">
    Shotlock
   </a>
   as an attack. Sora, however, can deflect this back to the Lingering Will, which leaves it very vulnerable. The Lingering Will can also transform its Keyblade into a Keyblade Glider that lets it fly extremely fast, and a cog-like object that spins around so fast that if Sora gets hit by it once, then the rest of the hits will also hit Sora.
  </p>
  <p key="bcfa6abf-5cfd-439f-a22b-57329d77a855">
   The Lingering Will can also conjure a ritual-like attack. In this attack, the Lingering Will enters a berserk-like state, similar to
   Saïx
   's Berserk technique. Its arm gauntlets and helmet will emit a bright red aura, and it then can split its Keyblade into two weapons. This, when added with its combos, makes it extremely lethal.
  </p>
  <p key="a9564cc2-60b4-4867-8894-4b96afcb2991">
   In this attack, the Lingering Will is only vulnerable after completing an attack or after deflecting the cannon-formed Keyblade's shot back at it. Any other time that you attack it, the attack will be nullified. While in the berserk-like state, the last few attacks of the Will's rapid combo can be blocked by Sora regularly, although it would take evading the first two slashes before it warps away and very precise timing.
  </p>
  <p key="ee08aad1-6ad1-4bd0-a0db-b2c6070ab62b">
   In addition to its Keyblade, the Lingering Will has some magical abilities. It can also create an unusual looking seal that either creates an orange or blue orb. An orange orb causes Sora to be unable to attack and a blue orb prevents Sora from using magic or items. It can also use some magic; for example, when the Lingering Will is doing a
   <a href="Sonic Blade.html" key="21c6147b-c2de-4a2b-b015-5471e0808ee8" title="Sonic Blade">
    Sonic Blade
   </a>
   -like attack while low on HP or attacking with its Keyblade Glider, it sometimes will use
   Blizzaga
   . Also, when it turns its Keyblade into a glider and rides it, if Sora is too far from it, it will sometimes use
   Magnega
   that does some damage, and will pull Sora into its path.
  </p>
  <p key="b6d48ff0-43ff-4120-af9b-f5990b03a4b2">
   The Lingering Will can also conjure drone-like objects which fire beams of plasma at Sora and his party. A particularly deadly attack consists of trapping Sora in a triangular-shaped seal that drains his health at a very fast rate, similar to an attack used by
   <a href="Xemnas.html" key="23532416-b495-4880-931e-3942e6477ffa" title="Xemnas">
    Xemnas
   </a>
   , but much more powerful. Only a "Break Free" command on Sora's command list can save him from it. If the player chooses the wrong command while he is trapped, then Sora will immediately die, even with Once More and Second Chance equipped.
  </p>
  <p key="655256b5-bd0f-4ded-8b3f-1b1244eae0f6">
   Interestingly, when it strikes Sora with its Keyblade(s), most of its combos resemble Sora's combos, most notably the
   Valor Form
   and

   combos. It should be noted that all of the Lingering Will's attacks can be blocked or evaded with precise blocking,

   magic,
   Curaga
   magic with the

   The Lingering Will is a very capable Keyblade wielder, able to morph the Ends of the Earth into several different forms. It shares Terra's ability to summon a Keyblade Glider, using what was once a form of transportation for the hero as an offensive technique. Other forms the Ends of the Earth may take through the Lingering Will's influence include a chain whip, the massive cannon-like form used in Terra's Ultima Cannon
