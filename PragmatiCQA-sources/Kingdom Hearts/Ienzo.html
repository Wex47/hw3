   Shortly after the battle, his escort
   Even
   arrives and gives Ventus both his and Ienzo's thanks, explains Ienzo's past and that he had been assigned to look after the boy, giving Ventus the directions to the Castle Garden where he would find

   In the year following the events of Birth by Sleep, Ienzo participates in Ansem's research on the darkness in hearts alongside Braig,
   Dilan
   , Even,
   Aeleus
   , and Xehanort. It would be Ienzo's persuasive influence that convinced Ansem to build a laboratory in the castle's basement to conduct the experiment on Xehanort. But though Ansem decided not to proceed further, Ienzo and the other apprentices had their own intentions and continue conducting inhumane experiments on the human heart that ultimately results in the mass production of the

   . Ansem quickly discovered their secret experiments, and immediately ordered them to stop. One day, after being advised to review their research data by

   In the end, Xehanort betrayed them, removing the
   hearts
   of the other apprentices, all for his plan to gather the twelve vessels he wished to house fragments of his heart to use in the creation of the true
   χ-blade
   . Though his heart turned into a weak Heartless that was eventualy destroyed, Ienzo had a strong will that allowed him to continue as a
   Nobody

   After both his Heartless and Nobody had been defeated,

   . After Lea returns from a frutiless search, Ienzo goes on to explain that when a person is splintered into a Heartless and a Nobody, they are to be restored in the world they originally split apart. However, he then adds that there's the possibility of coming to in other worlds that are between light and darkness, such as
