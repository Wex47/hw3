  <p key="f3bd734c-3afc-4029-aa07-63161f5b3049">
   While the Gullwings' physical appearances have changed, their personalities have not: Yuna is unfailingly kindhearted and polite, even bowing in respect to Sora, Donald, and Goofy and apologizing to them for bothering them; Rikku is good-natured and ditzy, the latter of which shows when she nearly reveals to Sora and friends who they were working for; and Paine is emotionally distant and anti-social.
  </p>
  <p key="ecd021f1-dfd6-442a-93b2-7a75ecf50a3e">
   However, it would seem that they are more like mercenaries in this game, working for Maleficent in exchange for treasure, and agreeing to work for Leon only if he pays them to do so; when confronting Sora, Donald, and Goofy, Rikku complains about Leon not having any treasure and Paine says, "And we fought for you guys", almost as if it was a crime to help someone out without receiving payment.
  </p>
  <p key="aca7f68a-b482-49f9-a3d8-543a80eaa219">
   Nonetheless, they do seem to have a strong moral compass, as they decide to let Sora and co. off without consequence upon hearing of his fight with Organization XIII and search for his missing friends, as they believe that punishing them for doing the right thing is just not right.

   Another change to the trio is their less revealing attire as opposed to their outfits in the original game, which showed more skin. Yuna originally had hot pants and her top was more revealing and the symbol on it—a tribute to
   Tidus
   —was larger, likely because the symbol held together the shirt from a large V-necked gap, and the gap was sized down, and the symbol with it. Rikku wore a bikini top and had no stockings, and although it is changed to a tank top with visible shoulder straps in

   , her midriff and navel are still clearly exposed. Paine now wears a tank top with visible shoulder straps and her boots no longer have high-heels. Minor changes to her stockings and shawl were made as well. Also, the three fairies each have wings that are unique to them. Yuna has a hair clip resembling bird wings, Rikku's wings are the long, loose ends of her scarf, and Paine has black, bat-like wings.

   As another note, none of the girl's names are mentioned, besides Yuna's name, or nickname, as Rikku whispered it to her when they confronted Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Before they are about to trick them, they said in the English dialogue outside of non-subtitled whispering between the trio, possibly to prevent confusing Rikku with Riku. Paine also mentions Rikku's name in a text box if the player talks to her before talking to Yuna after the battle.

   Sora asks them to help out the

Donald, knowing that the Committee needs all the help it can get, lies and says that he does (proving it by chuckling to himself after they leave).
