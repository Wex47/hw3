   Although initially a mischievous individual who would often skip work and perform acts that almost always got him in trouble, even at those times Mickey displays bravery and dedication to his goals, as he never gives up as a musketeer despite his sword skills not being excellent and would save Sora from a Heartless ambush despite later on leaving in a hurry whenever in trouble so Sora could solve it himself.
  </p>
  <p key="2c3f6c4f-12bb-4ba7-a9a8-74f2675000e3">
   By the time he became Yen Sid's apprentice and the King of the Disney Castle, Mickey has matured considerably, becoming a kind, brave, and noble king, no longer being afraid to fight for the side of good and fully willing to defend those who needed it, although it borders on the level of recklessness as he disobeyed Yen Sid to help the worlds upon learning of the danger that is occurring, but he also was willing to accept whatever punishment Yen Sid has for him afterwards by handing over his Keyblade believing he would be disqualified with dignity despite being sad. This trait later on becomes more of a tactical last resort, as he enters a Corridor of Darkness into the Realm of Darkness at Twilight Town as it was the only way with all the points to enter the Realm of Darkness disabled and has already planned ahead to stop the chaos.

  <p key="7a0ff6dc-4ce9-4eba-a1e7-b0bb1b51700b">
   Mickey values above all else friendship and integrity much more highly than others. He has little care for his noble position and often prefers his closest friends to address him by his name, such as when he and Riku bonded during their adventure in
   Castle Oblivion
   , but at the same time he can command respect and loyalty from his subjects, ruling his world unchallenged and with Donald and Goofy obeying his mysterious orders upon his disappearance. Although Goofy and Donald have implied that he is not above punishing his subjects for disobedience, Mickey is shown to be rather flexible in that he is left impressed by Donald and Goofy's loyalty to Sora by disobeying his orders to leave Hollow Bastion and lets them off with a smile. When his friends are hurt, Mickey is fully capable of getting serious and displaying actual anger, as seen during the
   Battle of 1000 Heartless
   ; he took a role on the battlefield after Goofy was presumed dead, although when push comes to shove, he can, albeit with reluctance, abandon his friends when the situation is truly extremely dire, as he left Aqua in the Realm of Darkness to save all the worlds from the danger of being completely taken over by darkness.

   true identity

The top half of this jacket is black, while the bottom half is red, and there are two yellow straps dangling in front of it. His pants are red and sport a zipper going down the front of each leg. Each leg also has a yellow pouch with a black strap that partially cover the zipper, as well as a blue strap on the outer side of each pant leg. Mickey wears very large, yellow shoes with grey backs and two orange, intersecting straps attached to the front of each shoe.

Under this vest he wears a short-sleeved shirt that is seems to be the same black, white-lined color scheme as his vest, though the cuffs of the sleeves are red. His pants are red and quite baggy. The pockets have white lining. Similar to Goofy, the front of Mickey's pant legs are pulled up slightly by elastic, blue straps. Mickey's shoes here are also yellow, but the tips and lower halves are black and the soles are white. Each shoe has two blue straps that intersect over the top of the shoe.

The figure then revealed himself to be a Data-Riku, who possesses the memories written in Jiminy's journal. Being the Journal itself, Riku went on to explain that Mickey was no longer in the real world. Much to Mickey's shock, he heard Chip and Dale's voice asking if he's okay. However, a hacker entered the journal and blocked the portal back to the outside world.

However, the Journal was taken hostage by Maleficent and Pete and taken to Hollow Bastion. Mickey went after them, and also saw that Data-Sora had summoned a new Keyblade. However, the Journal had been filled with Bugs by Pete to turn him into a slave. Despite that, the resulting fight between it and Data-Sora had knocked it out.

   Utilizing the power of waking to protect them and his keyblade to open gateways to the Dark Realm, Mickey travels with Riku to the Realm of Darkness to find Aqua. As they walked, Mickey expressed concern for Riku when he briefly stopped but soon expressed pride for his growth and attributed it to his newfound ability to care so much. He also admits that he was concerned as his ability to detect Aqua gets hazier the closer they get and the Realm of Darkness has evolved since their last time. Although brushing off Riku's concerns, Mickey's own concerns soon proved to be justified as when they traced her trail to the Dark Margin, they find no trace of her. Sadly rebuking Riku's idea of Aqua returning to the Realm of Light, Mickey attributes this to Aqua falling into an even deeper abyss and though he may be able to find her if they go deeper, neither of them are equipped enough to dive any deeper. Soon enough, the Demon Tower appears, nearly kills Riku and breaks his Keyblade in half and though Mickey forces the Demon Tower to retreat, his Keyblade was damaged. With their Keyblades disabled and the Heartless' strength even greater than expected, the situation was effectively a loss and Mickey and Riku fell back in defeat, with Mickey having to convince Riku to retreat to regroup and resupply when Riku insists on staying to save Aqua from the same fear and loneliness he once felt in the Dark World.

Yen Sid suggests that as Aqua visited many worlds during her own journey, it may be prudent for Riku and Mickey to follow her footsteps to gain clues to her current whereabouts. He provides new garments for Kairi and Lea, and requests that Riku and Mickey deliver them when they visit Merlin to gain new Keyblades.

Mickey attempts to enlist Aqua and Riku to help him do the job, but Sora intervenes and states his desire to do so. After some convincing, Mickey allows Sora to finish off Xehanort while Mickey and the other guardians close Kingdom Hearts.

He very effectively uses the advantages afforded by his size and agility to the maximum in order to easily counter and wear down his foes, flipping and spinning attacks, and finishing them with wide strokes of his blade and his body possesses the strength to deal crushing blows despite his size. Even with his training being incomplete, he could effectively fight side-by-side alongside Aqua and Ventus, both of whom being exceptional Keyblade wielders in their own right, in aiding them against Vanitas, successfully forcing Vanitas to flee, with Vanitas later resorting to surprising Mickey rather than taking him on directly to capture him in Neverland, although when Vanitas had the X-Blade, Mickey was forced back. At the present, as a full-fledged Keyblade Master, Mickey's level of prowess with his Keyblade is described as being superior to the likes of Sora and Riku at one point due to their lack of experience compared to Mickey, which shows itself by Mickey's superior feats compared to Sora and Riku: He is capable of effortlessly taking down many Nobodies and Heartless with a single attack,  even able to easily destroy 3 Darkside Heartless, indicating the gap between him and Sora at the time of the first game was great due to Sora being a mere fledgling despite his already considerable abilities, and later on managed to single-handedly fight through the legion of Heartless that proved a difficult challenge for Sora, Donald and Goofy without showing any strain.

   , while Riku was knocked out by the Demon Tower in the Realm of Darkness, Mickey alone single-handedly defeated the powerful Heartless into retreat, killing off half of the Heartless composing it and freeing Riku. He was even able to take on Marluxia, Larxene and Luxord by himself with masterful efficiency, quickly forcing back Marluxia and Larxene in close combat after only several clashes while parrying Luxord's magic cards, sustaining no injuries until Sora came to aid him, after which their combined strength were able to swiftly push back the three powerful Nobodies and after being freed from being briefly trapped by Luxord, he and Sora quickly overpowered and defeated Marluxia and Larxene without any scratches done to them. He would proceed to aid Sora and Riku into defeating Xemnas, Ansem and Young Xehanort and remained standing quite well while Riku was kneeling. The most prominent display of Mickey's skill was how Mickey single-handedly fended off the attacks of all Replica Xehanorts despite being injured. Mickey is also perfectly capable of using Keyblades other than his own, as in addition to using his Star Seeker, upon finding the

  <p key="d00bcd7e-709e-4fe6-a106-5bf06dbfa079">
   Although Mickey prefers swordsmanship over Magic, he is by no means incompetent in the use of magic in combat and proves to be a considerably powerful and adept spellcaster. His strong connection to
   <a href="Light.html" key="08ae4d76-c0ae-4ac9-8977-c64f17189f4c" title="Light">
    Light
   </a>
   makes him capable of making good use of it in combat, with just about all his offensive spells and even supportive ones being based on the element of light, ranging from projecting homing balls of bluish energy in the form of the spell "Pearl" to even using the ultimate light-magic spell "Holy" in 358/2 Days as his Limit Break, where he surrounds himself with hovering balls of light that acts as a shield and fires beams of light that can be charged to make one large beam and 3 thinner beams surrounding in a triangle formation and his final limit summons a storm of light rays and two orbs of light, as well as firing orbs and showers of light and manifesting a burst of light capable of both stunning enemies and healing Riku. Mickey is also capable of using Light to perform a special form of healing spell called "Healing Light" that would fully heal Sora both in HP and MP. In
   <i key="4743af7a-a08c-48d2-9bfa-702c5ddd79e9">

   , Mickey even proves capable of casting a light-elemental version of "Ultima" that, while not completely cast, projected a wide orb of light that Xehanort had to use the most powerful of Stop spells to counter and even then it should be noted Mickey had managed to pressure and greatly wane the spell's strength as he seemed to be successfully clashing with and pushing the elderly Keyblade Master's Stopza back a bit before ultimately being overcame and although the spell still reached far enough to immobilize Riku, Mickey was successful enough to allow his and Riku's recovery to be far faster than when he stopped the Organization XIII with the same spell. Although not displayed often, Mickey is also capable of using Light to empower his physical attacks and greatly enhance his speed, as shown in
   <i key="d0a74597-18db-4162-9cba-28a76e09a72e">
    Kingdom Hearts 2.8

   , where he can warp and deal blows able to instantly finish off Heartlesses in the Realm of Darkness when using "Wayfinder". When facing the Replica Xehanorts, Mickey displayed the enormous level of power he has over Light by being able to, despite being injured, repel the foes with a burst of light and also block and cut through their blasts with an orb of light. He was even able to simultaneously shield against all 13 of their blasts and with help from Sora, eventually overpower the attack, proceeding to empower his Keyblade so much that he was able to create a large blade of light that cut down the Replica Xehanorts instantly and blast the rest to oblivion with a large beam of light. He is also capable of using the normal "Cure" quite well, instantly healing Ventus from the severe beating Vanitas put on him and is capable of casting Curaga in

   to restore a huge portion of his and his allies health. Mickey has also displayed incredible expertise in the use of time-based Magic, capable of casting an extremely powerful Stopza spell, the most powerful variant of Stop currently active, as shown in
   <i key="9c367a6c-82a1-4dc5-9da2-c343fb99d502">

   , where he cast a Stopza spell strong enough to hold the resurrection of Xehanort and the rest of the Organization XIII for a considerable length of time to try to save Sora and only Young Xehanort is able to break free and only because of his powers over time and even then he still briefly froze and he was confident he could freeze all the Heartless and Nobodies attacking them in the final battle, although Riku stated he would be exhausted from doing so. He was also proficient with the Reflect magic, able to help Aqua and Xion in casting the powerful Refleza spell, blocking the attacks of the Replica Xehanorts before being broken through in the end.

  <p key="c26a5c3c-2076-4e19-81c6-5cd3c61d15a1">
   Mickey is capable of levitating himself above the ground, doing so in most of his coordinated attacks with allies. He can even actually fly, although it remains unknown how he is able to do so, as he was able to fly all the way to Aqua in the Dark Realm and keep them in the air until finding soft ground.
  </p>
  <p key="43a4f6fe-da3c-4cbc-8e08-0fcc3d94c5ac">
   Despite his small body, Mickey has displayed astonishing resilience and durability beyond that of any normal person of his size and body, as shown by how he survives a powerful lunging attack from the Demon Tower that ripped his clothes and violently threw him to the ground with no injury and quickly stands back up and later on when he is able to survive being constantly spin around by the Demon Tide while restrained and remain conscious, surviving being once again violently knocked down after being freed and quickly regaining consciousness soon after. Mickey was even so resillient that despite having been considerably injured, he was able to stand up twice and fight against the Replica Xehanort until defeating before collapsing and even then was able to retain consciousness and swiftly recover to help the Guardians deliver the fatal blow to Armored Xehanort.

  <p key="bdb335e1-51b9-4861-8ece-37bdac530344">
   Among the strongest proponents of the light, in addition to his previously stated abilities to control light in combat, the strength of Mickey's heart is so great that not only has he never fought with his inner darkness, but the large amount of time he spent in the Dark Realm as well as wielding his Dark Realm Keyblade, the Kingdom Key D, is a polar opposite to Sora's Light Realm Keyblade, the Kingdom Key has no effect on him. Traveling with the
   Corridor of Darkness
   also completely has no effect on him. Mickey's strength in the light is even great enough that while trapped in the Realm of Darkness, he can still project a portion of himself that can still use a rather formidable level of power over light to aid Riku, even capable of supressing Ansem long enough for Riku to regain consciousness after he only barely defeated Lexaeus with Dark Mode. Upon managing to return fully, he easily prevents Ansem from possessing Riku forcibly when he was nearly overwhelmed. Later on, Mickey was able to hold the massive projection of Sora's Heartless at bay with a beam of light long enough for Sora to destroy the actual form of the heartless. Mickey has the capability to coat himself with light to survive in the Lanes Between even when unconscious and is also capable of traveling through worlds using light, as he easily reaches Riku before Sora could be turned into a vessel of Xehanort. With the Kingdom Key D, he also has the power to open doors to the realm of darkness and can combine this with the power of waking to enter and leave with others trapped inside the realm unharmed.

   Although Mickey is more prominently known for his combat abilities, his intellectual talents are also noteworthy. Known as a great king, Mickey is an excellent leader capable of commanding respect from all his denizens for his leadership over Disney Castle. Although his first attempts of using the Star Shard ended rashly, over time, Mickey became a skilled enough of a scientist and mechanic to discover it's
   Gummi
   nature and with it build a ship capable of transporting from world to world. He is also an excellent strategist, further backed up by his willingness to use drastic measures if needed, with a sharp eye for details, as shown by how he is the only one apart from Yen Sid to recognize the disturbances of the worlds as being potentially devastating and the involvement of the mysterious
   Organization XIII
   and managed to neutralize the first threat by first taking advantage of a Corridor of Darkness left behind by the Guard Armor to enter the Realm of Darkness and after entering, despite the rashness of his methods to enter the dark realm that he and Aqua had to acknowledge, he quickly developed a plan to find the keyblade of the realm of darkness to seal the door to the realm of darkness. After coming out, he was able to stay out of the Organization's eyes while simultaneously keeping watch of some of their activities without requiring aid from Riku or his allies, knowing enough to be able to deduce the Organization was planning to stall time, although due to having only himself to rely on, he was not able to gather as much information on their activities as Riku could with DIZ helping him.
