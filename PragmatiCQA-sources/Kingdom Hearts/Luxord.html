   Luxord is a man of games and luck; his challenge to Sora and Jack to find the medallions has a game quality to it, and the Heartless he summons cannot be attacked unless all the coins are in the chest, giving a side-objective to the battle. He also uses games of chance in his own battle with Sora. However, his enjoyment for games can backfire on him, both in and out of battle. His enjoyment of games is further portrayed in his additional scenes in
   <i key="c468036c-c214-4ead-a169-573b3a3b4358">

  <p key="68c7009f-f166-4571-b6bc-e6345e2c2e08">
   Luxord is also portrayed as a master of rhetoric, with an advanced vocabulary (for example, describing the Grim Reaper Heartless as "

    a veritable maelstrom of avarice
   </i>
   ", meaning endlessly greedy, using it to taunt his opponents). He also possesses a notably British accent in the English translation, furthering his air of sophistication. Another interesting note is that, unlike most other members of Organization XIII, who banter with Sora in some fashion before fighting, when Luxord appears to him he calmly smiles and says "
   <i key="d035467d-953d-4d3b-bf24-e394cd11bdf5">
    I'd rather we just skip the formalities

    Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days

   , Luxord's loyalty to the Organization appears to be out of duty rather than out of any actual loyalty, contrasting this with Vexen's apparent loyalty to Xemnas. He does not appear to enjoy being used as a pawn, sarcastically remarking to Xemnas about being put at the bottom of the Organization rankings. After being defeated, Luxord calmly accepts his demise and praises Sora for his magnificent talents in playing card games, smiling when Sora playfully asks to play him again after he is revived, saying that he would like that very much. He even gives Sora a wild card that he said could "turn the tables", which seems to indicate that Luxord knows of the price Sora will have to pay for misusing the power of waking.

   Luxord also acknowledges that he has a tendency to look into the minds of the people around him and has shown strong deductive reasoning skills. In his conversation with Xigbar about his mission to find the Black Box, Luxord appeared to see through Xigbar's attempts at dismissing the topics and put out his own theory on Xigbar's motives based on the evidence he gathered. However, he did not appear to have any motive beyond satisfying his curiosity, as he said that he was fine playing along.

Luxord's platinum-blond hair is very short and worn in a Caesar cut, and he has electric-blue eyes, although they become golden-yellow when he gains a fragment of Master Xehanort’s heart. He is also the only member of the original Organization XIII to have a beard or mustache, his being a goatee and the same blond color as his hair.

During the subsequent meeting with the pirates, Luxord explains that he was searching for a mysterious box potentially within the world and asks if Jack knew. Jack however refuses to precisely disclose information regarding a particular chest, prompting Luxord to call for a wager; a race to Port Royal. Luxord explains that if he won, Jack would tell him everything about the chest, or rather if they won, Luxord would reward Jack whatever he wanted. Jack swiftly agrees to the terms, much to Sora's chargin, and Luxord warps back to his ship to begin the race.

After clearing Luxord's ship, Luxord appears before the group, congratulating them on their victory, much to Sora's suspicions. When Jack admires Luxord's acceptance of defeat, Luxord asks what it is he wanted as a reward for his victory; Jack reveals that he wants the Dead Man's Chest aboard the

As Sora calls out Luxord's name, the latter tells them from his ship that they know how to make good timing, saying that their celerity should be marveled. However, Luxord tells Sora that his compulsive behavior would eventually bring him sorrow before summoning more Heartless ships for them to deal with before vanishing into the fog with his ship.

When Jack says that he has what he needs, he blows a whiff of his rancid breath into Luxord's face, causing the Nobody to stumble off the side of the ship and into the ocean in disgust.

   guardians of light
   at the crossroads of the Keyblade Graveyard, where Master Xehanort creates the Skein of Severance to serve as the battlegrounds of the

   and later Sora. During the battle, Xemnas empowers Luxord, who soon uses his newfound strength to trap Mickey in a card while challenging Sora to one last game. Unfortunately for Luxord, Sora is yet again able to beat him. After his defeat, Luxord is dignified and reposed, praising Sora for his talents and rewarding him a "wild card", telling him to hold onto it as it could turn the tables. Sora then offers Luxord to play him again one day when they are both just mere "guys"; Luxord chuckles warmly, saying he would very much enjoy that before fading away once again, becoming the third member of the real Organization to be eliminated.

   Luxord uses his attribute, time, in unorthodox methods when compared to other Organization XIII members. One might not even see his element as time at first glance. He is overall not the most powerful or hardest to defeat but the trickiest Organization member to defeat. He shortens the odds originally by dispatching of Sora's companions before attacking Sora himself. In

   , Luxord does not have a health bar; during the battle, Luxord and Sora each have a "time" bar that depletes over time and when they are damaged. The first to have theirs depleted loses the battle. This means that the player must watch Sora's HP and time gauges to make sure neither are emptied. When fighting, he mainly uses his cards both to defend himself and also to attack enemies but he can also conjure an orb of dark energy around him to unleash energy tendrils that reach everywhere, also having a variation where he surrounds himself with an orb of energy before suddenly conjuring his cards around enemies to attack them from all directions.

   , Luxord has a Limit Break called Jackpot. During Jackpot, Luxord summons a card in front of him. While it is summoned, the card alternates between a cross and a flashing symbol similar to Roxas's pendant. Selecting the cross results in the card merely exploding and Luxord will visibly flinch, while selecting the flashing symbol will create a few powerful energy blasts that follow a trail between Luxord and the target.

   During Luxord's Final Limit, Luxord summons two cards in front of him instead of one. The player now has three alternating symbols to choose from: double crosses, the flashing symbol, and an additional red symbol or two large red symbols. The crosses cause the cards to explode as before, the flashing symbol and the red symbol create the exact same energy blasts as summoned by one card. When the two large red symbols are selected, Luxord will create more energy blasts than with one card, with the final blast being much bigger and more powerful. Both versions of the attack are reminiscent of the "Begin Game"

   Luxord's weapons are very flexible, both literally and figuratively. He uses Cards of varying sizes, some reaching likely more than ten feet in the air when stood on end. The back of each Card has five Nobody symbols on it, while the opposite side resembles a clock (referencing Luxord's element of time) that has Nobody symbols as the minute and hour hands, and the Roman numerals for 1-12 for the clock numbers (the numeral for 13 is in the center, just under the clock hands). Luxord uses these Cards the way that most members of Organization XIII use their element. His signature weapon is the

   He can turn himself into a giant Card and hide among similar Cards, turn his enemies into Cards, throw flurries of razor-sharp cards at an enemy, create defensive barriers, and at times by will can warp reality. The

   "
   Flip
   " causes the Cards to vanish, but some of them have a booby trap (represented by a symbol on the one side of the Card) that "Flip" triggers. He can also use them as sleight of hand cover, or to disorient his enemies. His Limitcut data recreation could telekinetically manipulate the Cards even after throwing them, suspend himself in the air while firing Cards, unleash a multitude of red Cards that cannot be blocked, create a barrier of energy with five Cards that must be broken in the correct order less Sora be damaged, and his ultimate game has him encircle Sora in a vast amount of Cards where if Sora fails to find him in time, he can have all the Cards surround and launch attack Sora.
  </p>
  <p key="cd000b29-9375-4e90-a2bd-8c7798ed5a12">
   Oddly, most of the Cards (that lack booby traps) Luxord uses in battle are blank on one side, while the ones he uses to "trap" Sora's companions bear the aforementioned clock design.
