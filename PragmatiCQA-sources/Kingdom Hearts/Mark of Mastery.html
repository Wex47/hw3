    Today you will be examined for the Mark of Mastery. Not one but two of the Keyblade's chosen stand here as candidates... but this is neither a competition or a battle for supremacy—not a test of wills, but a test of heart. Both of you may prevail, or neither.

   After an intense evening of training, Terra and Aqua arrive before
   Master Eraqus
   , with their friend Ventus eagerly watching. Master Eraqus announces that his old colleague
   Master Xehanort
   has come to help judge their skills, then warns Terra and Aqua of the strong heart and will required to pass the test, and that their fate will be decided through the exam. As soon as his apprentices are ready, Master Eraqus proceeds to summon several
   Orbs of Light
   for them to battle, but although Master Xehanort covertly infuses the orbs with darkness, forcing Ventus to help defeat them as well, Eraqus allows the test to proceed.

   Once the orbs have been destroyed, the second stage of the Mark of Mastery exam begins. Terra and Aqua engage themselves in a fierce battle, and as Terra begins to lose the battle, his inner darkness begins to emerge, but he quickly dismisses it.

   When the battle has ended, Master Eraqus acknowledges Terra's great strength, but chooses only Aqua to become a Keyblade Master due to Terra's reliance on his darkness. Master Eraqus states that he expects Terra to try harder the next time; he then tells Aqua he will later inform her of her new duties as a Keyblade Master, leaving behind a confused Terra, who soon leaves to get his head together.

   When first told of what they need to do, Sora is confident in his abilities and does not believe that he needs the Mark of Mastery to defeat Xehanort, but Riku doubts himself because of his previous fall to darkness, so the two of them go together. In the end however, Riku ends up passing the exam while Sora fails after being kidnapped by Master Xehanort and his forces, along with touching the darkness because of his recklessness and failure to protect his heart from the darkness within him. The results of this exam cause Sora to exile himself to Traverse Town to train himself to take the Exam again, where he is greeted by multiple Dream Eaters he had befriended on his journey while Riku stays behind with Yen Sid, bringing Kairi along with him because she is also capable of wielding a Keyblade.
