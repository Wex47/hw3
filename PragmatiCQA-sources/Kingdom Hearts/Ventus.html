    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="997a9e33-78bd-41cb-88f7-75fdd451d1fa">
   During his time, in Daybreak Town, Ventus' personality was mostly the same but he was also shy and had a hard time making friends and yet didn't like the idea of fighting other wielders. After learning the truth of his part in Strelitzia's demise, he feels guilty that he was unable to save her when Darkness had possessed him. According to Darkness, Ventus also had a hidden desire for power.
  </p>
  <p key="6bb84013-330d-4fac-a46a-ba58b6bee81e">
   Ventus is the youngest of the three Keyblade warriors. Personality-wise, he has many similarities with Sora; he's sweet, cheerful, curious, and gets excited at anything new or interesting, and he also has Similarities with Roxas; he can be short-tempered, blunt and stands his ground. He also feels disappointed whenever Aqua and Terra refuse to allow him to join them on their missions because they do not want to put him in "harm's way." When he gives them their passes to Disney Town, he grudgingly mentions that Scrooge McDuck told him to "take two grown-ups," but he doesn't seem to dislike his status as the youngest of the three.
  </p>
  <p key="3d437e93-7d2c-4473-8b7a-f3310f281600">
   He also makes new friends easily in different worlds and really cares about his best friends Terra and Aqua, viewing Terra as an older brother. Ventus is very much unable to cope with Terra turning and subsiding to the darkness in his heart. Some of his traits and personality might have passed on to Sora when his heart joined him. Along with his kind personality, he also shows a lot of bravery, especially evident when he battles Vanitas for the final time, where he icily promises to fight for his friends no matter what, knowing the fact that he would lose his heart as a result.
  </p>
  <p key="5cbc6803-b352-43a2-9ff8-5d7980f857d5">
   He summons his own ruthlessness during the final battle with Vanitas; as the latter offers that the two become one once and for all and form the χ - blade, Ventus ominously shakes his head, and coldly offers to instead destroy the pair both instead.

    Roxas
   </a>
   , bearing identical facial features. Further highlighting this resemblance is Ventus's outfit, which is strikingly similar to Roxas's own
   Twilight Town
   clothes. He wears a jacket that resembles a fusion of Roxas's jacket (white on the right side) and Sora's jacket in
   <i key="ec101b62-0b52-4447-b6c6-3fbbf62253fa">
    Kingdom Hearts II
   </i>
   (black on the left side), also reminiscent of the Yin and Yang symbol. The collar of the jacket is red and pleated, again, similar to the collar on Roxas's own jacket. Underneath this, he wears what appears to be a grey vest with a single button and several white, angular patterns on it. He wears a third layer under this, in the form of a plain, high-necked, black shirt. He also has a chunk of dull green and blue armor on his midsection that appears to be under his vest, and another piece of armor on his left shoulder.
  </p>
  <p key="93edabbb-290a-4dd2-8253-09a6bf914ad0">
   Master Eraqus wears a similar piece of armor, though more blue-green, and more obvious. Ventus's pants are also similar to the pants Roxas wore, though Ven's balloon outward slightly before closing up about halfway down his legs, similar to caprice pants. These pants are colored in shades of grey, black, and white. He also wears an ornate, dull green and blue piece of armor on his upper-left arm, along with a black and white checkered wristband that is, once again, strikingly similar to Roxas's, but with white edges as opposed to Roxas's black-edged wristband. Like Aqua, he wears two criss-crossing straps on his chest, on which he wears a silver Keyblade Master emblem. His boots are rather odd when compared to Aqua's and Terra's, as they resemble an armored version of normal street shoes in shades of dull green and blue.
  </p>
  <p key="39ca0714-0524-43c8-8b61-457dffd5b019">
   Ventus's mannerisms are also echoed by Sora and Roxas; in particular, when standing around he often places his hands behind his head, in the same stance that Sora uses. Throughout both the canonical story and the extra-canonical videos of
   <i key="e85372ef-6b5e-44e5-9892-feeb81e3cf0f">

   , Ventus echoes Sora and Roxas in various ways. For example, in the opening video, Ventus is shown falling through a Station of the

   shattering the pillar, in a similar way to how Sora and Roxas fall from shattered Stations at the beginning of their games. At the beginning of his episode at the
   Land of Departure
   , Ventus falls asleep outside after watching a shooting star, and a little while later, he yawns, and then is startled to find Aqua standing over him, who giggles upon his reaction and teases him affectionately, mirroring how

   , Ventus's suit of armor shares the coloration of the pieces he normally wears, predominantly sporting shades of green and gold. In this suit, Ventus adds a yellow cape to his outfit that is discolored, almost appearing rusted. The armor on his knee is gold and bears a sharp, upward-pointing hook on the outer side of each one. Ventus's helmet has a notably different design from Aqua and Terra's, appearing more squashed and flat at the top. His helmet also has two prongs on either side of his head which point backwards and angle diagonally upward.

Ventus's armor loses the greens entirely, now sporting steel blue, gold, and black armor, with several red lines decorating it.

   , a group of Keywielders deriving from all five Unions, chosen by Ava per the instructions of

  </p>
  <p key="42544b15-282d-4b72-9af8-7aab64b1083c">
   After the Keyblade war was over, these new Union leaders were recruited by Ava, each given a Rule Book, and sent to meet their co-leaders at the site of the battle, now known as the

   Ephemer
   and
   Skuld
   chatting at the graveyard and tells them that he is envious of the friendship the two share, having spent much of his time alone. Ephemer assures Ventus that they value his friendship as well.
   Brain
   arrives and questions Ava's rules about not sharing the events of the Keyblade War with the other Dandelions. It seems the un-chosen members of the Dandelions lost their memories of the old world when traveling to the new one. Brain is reluctant to lie about it, but Ephemer assures him and everyone else that it is for the best. Ventus agrees as well.

  <p key="72304f6b-4896-4bf2-81bd-134272af458a">
   After the fifth leader
   Lauriam
   arrives, the group return to
   Daybreak Town
   and go to the Forteller's Chamber. As each Foreteller had led one of the five Unions, Skuld suggests that they decide who among them will now lead each one, but Ephemer convinces them to stay undivided for the time being. It was the division that caused the conflicts in the past, a past the Dandelions no longer remember. Brain believes it a good idea for the leaders to create new
   Spirits
   and sends Ephemer, Ventus, and Skuld to find ingredients while he and Lauriam stay behind to prepare.
  </p>
  <p key="3c8b6d83-7e57-4ac5-b8b9-f62b510776e7">
   Then, he noticed Brain reading through the book of prophecies intensively hearing his comrade's belief that they were still in a ruined future and wanting to be the virus that overrides it. Meanwhile, Ven confides with Skuld about what Brain said suggesting they talk to Ephemer but they were both shocked to find data apparitions of the Master of Masters and Master Ava and left to find Brain on the way there he meets Player and Ephemer making their way into the control room. Through, Brain's explanations, they discovered not only was a new data world trying to connect with their's as a result of the glitches and Darklings but they were also stuck inside a data version of Daybreak Town despite that he heard his comrade reaffirm his promise of getting them out.
  </p>
  <p key="a8faa864-304f-44ed-8c3f-07f191b87718">
   After some time, Brain sends his Chirithy to fetch Ventus. When gathered with the union leaders except for Lauriam, it is revealed that Brain was the one given a copy of the Book of Prophecies. In the book, Ava left the memo that Master of Masters gave her with the names of the five new union leaders on it. Furthermore, this note had a name circled to indicate which one of the leaders would be given the book. Brain reveals he was not the intended recipient of the book, and that one of the current union leaders is not on the list at all. Brain informs Ventus that he was not originally chosen to be a union leader, and that Lauriam's missing sister Strelitzia was supposed to be in his place. Nonetheless, the remaining union leaders determine Ventus was not self-aware that he was an imposter, and pledge to continue to work with him as a friend to uncover the truth.
  </p>
  <p key="38c8ceff-888e-44a8-b28d-67b27a85a635">
   Afterwards Ven explained that he met Master Ava in a warehouse and left together walking towards the clock tower but struggled to remember what went on inside and vaguely saw Strelitzia dying as he left. The continuing struggle to remember was so hard on Ventus that he was put in his sleeping corridors through his dreams, he finally remembers what happened to her. What the others believed was true; Darkness posed as Master Ava, possessed him, killed Lauriam's sister and while under the dark influence took her rulebook and left the house. Waking up afterwards, Ventus starts to cry, feeling guilt-ridden about what happened.
  </p>
  <p key="82c1254f-ae84-4471-a531-50f1b8ec4988">
   With this horrifying revelation, he admits to the others about what he did to Strelitzia much to his friends protest as well as invoking Lauriam's anger. But the struggle to remember makes him unable to answer, feeling something terribly wrong Ventus is unconscious as darkness emerges from him.
  </p>
  <p key="7119606c-3ce9-4048-9ce3-0f77336921c6">
   While conversating with Darkness, his friends discovered that Ventus is supposed to be the vessel that houses the Darkness as the "Destined Child", as written in the book of prophecies by the Master of Masters and that the Darkness used him to separate itself from the Darkness whole entity.
  </p>
  <p key="bee108c2-5670-4822-854e-cbd3afd9e4b7">
   Despite the others beating the Darkness back but due to the entity having no physical form the Union leaders couldn't destroy it. Then, shortly after Ventus was surrounded by the Darklings but before the creatures could do anything he wakes up to the other's surprise and uses the light within his heart to destroy them. Aware that the entity is pure darkness and him being pure light; just as the Darkness used him to change its form Ventus knew he could do the same giving it entity a form his friends could defeat but was briefly held back by a concerned Lauriam. And yet, he told him everything would be fine before taking on the Darkness alone.
  </p>
  <p key="a44246b3-7d9c-40b9-89fa-bef38e1e5484">
   The fight leaves Ventus unconscious once again and was watched over by a remorseful Lauriam. Then, he was carried by Lauriam to the basement below worried about the state of both worlds the union leaders decide to separate for his safety Ventus leaves with Elrena, Brain and Lauriam for the real world while Ephemer, Skuld and Player remain behind. Despite making it to the real world Ventus remained asleep inside the pod but with the real world on the verge of destruction too and for a chance to bring the others back he, Luariam and Elrena travel to the future; however, Ventus ends up separated from the others still unconscious in the Keyblade Graveyard found by an unknown individual.

However, when Terra asked Ventus about his past, he screamed out in agony, eventually falling unconscious. Eraqus revealed that this was because Ven had lost his memories. Afterwards, he remained asleep for some time. As he slept, Aqua kept watch over him, to keep him safe. Some time later, Ven woke up. Overjoyed, Aqua quickly alerted Eraqus and a worried Terra about Ven's recovery.
