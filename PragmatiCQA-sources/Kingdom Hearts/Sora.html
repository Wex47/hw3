   As Roxas is above and Sora below, he sees the picture of Riku, Kairi, Donald, and Goofy (as the platform's design). Roxas then says, "I see, that's why.", and continues the fight. Roxas knocks the Keyblade out of Sora's grasp, and as he goes to retrieve it, Roxas pins it down with his own Keyblade. Sora then reaches out for his Keyblade, which disappears and reappears in his hands, after which Sora quickly strikes while Roxas stands shocked, not knowing how that happened.

   Inside, they discover that Kingdom Hearts was made by the Superior to look like the World That Never Was. They charge through and quickly get to Xemnas and battle him, with Xemnas in armor using the tactics of the rest of the Organization. After they seemingly defeat the Organization leader and return to the Altar of Naught, Roxas emerges from Sora's body to speak with Naminé before she fuses with Kairi. Before this, Naminé opens a door to lead them out of the World That Never Was. He informs Sora that whenever he and Kairi are together, Roxas and Naminé will be together as well. Naminé then joins with Kairi to complete herself, while Roxas returns to Sora's body making Sora whole.

In an epic air battle they manage to defeat this form of Xemnas as well. Riku is injured by Xemnas, who strikes at both with his Ethereal Blades. Falling through the air on the brink of defeat, Sora grabs Riku's Keyblade and batters Xemnas with both. Returning it to Riku, they use a bolt of light and dark energy to finish off Xemnas.

   Afterward, Sora must help Riku walk, as he sustained a heavy injury from one of Xemnas' Ethereal Blades. They wander through the eternal abyss and eventually come to a dark beach under a pale moon, the Dark Margin. Resting at the shoreline, they discuss their adventures and friendship, and come to the conclusion that they did what they set out to do, and agreed that "If worlds are made of light and darkness, we'll be the darkness." The Realm of Light was safe, and they could now sit and let peace envelop them.

   Some time later, Sora is walking around in the Secret Cave. He smiles while looking at all the pictures he and Kairi had drawn over the years. He glances down at the picture of Kairi and himself. He sees that Kairi drew the other half of a paopu fruit, and smiles to himself, mimicking Kairi's actions from a year ago.

  <p key="95c70ba4-0110-41b6-a370-6d9d8050bce5">
   Much later, Sora asks Riku what he thinks the door to light was. Riku replies that it was Sora's heart; "It's always closer than you think". Kairi runs up to them breathlessly and gives them a bottle she found, containing a letter from King Mickey. The trio reads the letter.

   Sora then wakes up in a nighttime version of The Final World. He then calls out to anyone who can hear him. He soon hears a voice and runs towards it. When finding the source of the voice he recognizes the mysterious person as Yozora. Yozora asks Sora how he knows who he is while also making it clear Yozora knows who he is. Yozora states that he doesn't normally look the way he does now and tells Sora that they aren't in the real world right now. Yozora summons his weapons and the two youths soon teleport over to Quadratum on top of the 104 building. Yozora states after accidentally stumbling there and going through some trials he was asked to "save" Sora. Sora questions why he would summon his weapons. Yozora doesn't answer and the two proceed to fight.

A flash of light appears and Sora then appears in The Final World. Sora then wonders if any of this is real and states nothing makes sense to him.
