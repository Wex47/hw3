   Kairi is caring, kindhearted and brave. She is determined and courageous when someone she cares about is in danger, as she always puts herself in harm's way to help Sora when he's in trouble despite the dangers. Kairi's heart is said to be filled only with pure light and goodness, despite darkness and evil residing in almost every heart. Kairi's good heart filled with pure light helped lead Sora back to his true form when he was consumed by the Heartless, and led Sora and Riku back to Destiny Islands when they were trapped in the Realm of Darkness after their battle with Xemnas.
  </p>
  <p key="3e7568fc-56d7-4df4-90c2-f1487ab63ec0">
   Kairi is also very charismatic, quickly befriending Hayner, Pence, and Olette in Twilight Town before being kidnapped by Axel. She's usually always very cheerful and upbeat. Although she has no ability to defend herself in combat like Sora and Riku, she is very brave and strong willed and will put herself in danger anyway to help her friends. Unfortunately, this sometimes results in her needing rescuing by Sora. Near the end of

  <p key="b468e9e0-0549-409a-bc0f-e14bee2eb3bf">
   In contrast to Sora and Riku, who were both bothered by not knowing about Kairi's hometown, she took it in stride and was able to look at the positives about living in the Destiny Islands. She is loyal, and she can be rather stubborn sometimes.

  <p key="74cf5980-d333-42ee-9143-8aec11b2ba52">
   While the bond of friendship between Sora, Riku, and Kairi is very strong, Sora and Kairi seem to be particularly close to one another. This is evidenced by the fact that Kairi was proven to be the most special person in Sora's heart in

   Kairi also has a strong connection with King Mickey's dog, Pluto. They met on Destiny Islands, and the she followed him through the dark corridors. Pluto is like her protector as well. It was loving that Pluto went to comfort her at the Organization's dungeon with her responding nicely by petting him.

   Kairi, now fifteen years old, lives her life normally on Destiny Islands. She attends school regularly along with her friend Selphie and has noticeably aged, having longer hair and more defined features. It can be assumed that she has spent most of her time focusing on her studies, thinking about the boy she's forgotten, and hanging out with Selphie, Wakka, and Tidus - all of whom have returned to Destiny Islands safely. She's also become slightly more withdrawn because of Sora's absence, with wisdom beyond her years. She's not as brash and bold as she was in the first game, but she's still pretty sociable. She understands that both Riku and Sora have great destinies and duties to fulfill, but that still doesn't keep her from pondering taking action and searching for them on her own.

   During this conversation, Roxas brings up Sora, and, when Kairi inquires about his name, Sora himself, despite being in stasis, somehow uses Roxas as a conduit to talk to her, chastises her for forgetting his name, and jokingly gives her a hint ("Starts with an 'S'!"). Soon afterwards, Kairi sends

Her guess is correct and it is indeed Riku even though his appearance has changed to that of Xehanort's Heartless, though she takes this in stride and is just happy to be reunited with Riku.

Naminé and Roxas accept their fate together to live inside Sora and Kairi as they fuse with their original selves.

As Xemnas prepares to kill her despite Lea's pitiful attempt to stop him, Roxas's heart emerges from Sora in a beam of light, immediately traveling to Radiant Garden to obtain a replica body there before forcing Xemnas to jump back as the force of his return to the graveyard creates a cloud of dust. As the dust settles, Xemnas is horrified to see Roxas, questioning how he has returned. Roxas reveals that, like Xemnas, he is using a replica, and it was through his connections with his friends and their hearts that he was able to return.

She does fairly well, but is eventually restrained by Xemnas. After Lea, Roxas and Xion fight the two Seekers to a stand still, Xemnas realizes he was outmatched. Xemnas remarks that he doesn't need hearts and that he would scatter them to the winds before warping behind the heroes and abducting Kairi, telling the guardians that though they have more lights, the Organization has more darknesses to replenish their ranks before warping away with Kairi.

Luckily, a time travelling Sora from the future travels through the Hearts of the Guardians and retrieves these fragments, and Kairi is restored to life.

She is then confronted by a Master Xehanort illusion. Although she puts up a good fight, she is unable to defeat him. Suddenly, Kairi's link to Sora allows him to remotely control her and defeats the manifestation of Xehanort. Before Kairi wakes, Xehanort reminds her of a world on "the other side".
