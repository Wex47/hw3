   . Despite their tiny HP bar they can take a lot of damage, although
   Gravity
   is very effective. Watch out for their jumps combined with their poisonous spores that they release in a small area around them. They can also turn invincible for a short time. Other than these all of the first eight seeds should prove little to no challenge at this point in the game, and especially the new
   Blizzara
   spell should carve through all of them very quickly.

   and
   Yuffie
   . Yuffie will be the main target at first, as she has a lot less HP, and can heal both herself and Leon with potions. She will rely on her agility to try and avoid you, while throwing homing shurikens. Deflect or Guard to return them, temporarily stunning her, allowing you to get several easy hits in. After enough damage has been dealt she will send a large, glowing shuriken at you that will make several passes until it disappears. At this point it is easier to either quickly finish her off or to step back and focus on avoiding it.
  </p>
  <p key="3573774c-4484-46e8-be45-ae2d97b4febd">
   While fighting Yuffie you will have had to avoid Leon's melee and ranged attacks. His ranged fireball attacks are the same and can be deflected, but he will now actively run up to you to attack. Like Cloud, he also has an air-to-ground move which is easy to hear coming when he shouts "It's over!" After some damage he will charge up his Gunblade, giving it increased damage and a much longer range, most notably his horizontal attack that hits everything around him, preceded by him saying "Get this!", which you can avoid by jumping or by using
   Dodge Roll
   .
  </p>
  <p key="48a129e8-8533-4340-85b5-06c64ccfb2e0">
   Dodge Roll is also incredibly useful, as it is the most reliable move to both quickly avoid his strikes and position yourself to flank him, something you could not do back in Traverse Town. Other than that you should be using
   Aero
   and
   Cure
   to handle the damage he deals, or if you do not need to, possible casting
   Stop
   on either him or Yuffie for some easy damage for a short moment.
