   , the roles of light and darkness play very typical roles in the story and game mechanics, with light being a positive aspect, and darkness being a negative one, since the Heartless are the embodiment of Darkness. Most of Sora and company's quest is aimed at closing the
   Door to Darkness
   and eliminating Heartless creatures. The entire story seems at first very biased towards the force of Light. However, one important belief about light is that there is always "a light in the deepest darkness".
  </p>
  <p key="c57343bc-d9d4-46be-8090-d483ddf86ba7">
   This plays a role many times in the story, including when Sora opens the Door to Darkness and finds a blinding light inside with

   . Even through all of the bias towards light, the opposed forces are in fact still balanced with a closed
   Door to Light
   and a closed Door to Darkness. There are also two Keyblades, one from the Realm of Light, which is used by Sora, and one from the Realm of Darkness, which is used by King Mickey.

He tries to shun the darkness and "Ansem" out of him, but he cannot do it. Because of this, "Ansem" taunts him that darkness is his destiny. Riku finally finds a revelation in himself when he talks with

   Riku, in the form of Ansem, has control over numerous powers of darkness. He is able to cast Dark Firaga, open Corridors of Darkness, and use darkness in finishing moves for his combos. After Riku returns to normal, he can no longer use the Corridors of Darkness, but is able to use Dark Firaga and Dark Shield, among other attacks. The "All's End" attack of the Session
   Limit
   involves Riku charging
   his keyblade
   with Darkness in equal measure to Sora's Light.

  <p key="38246bba-28c2-4ff7-84aa-7f570667ff9c">
   Organization XIII uses the power of darkness to summon the Corridors of Darkness and some of them also use darkness in combat: Luxord, by conjuring an orb of energy, can unleash dark tendrils at Sora that cannot be dodged. Marluxia's Absent Silehoutte is able to use darkness combined with his thorns to create a whirlwind to pull Sora and also create circles of dark thorns. Roxas, despite using the power of light in his boss fight majorly, is able to make use of one darkness attack by throwing his Keyblade and then unleashing a wave of dark power to draw Sora in. Xemnas can trap Sora in an orb of dark energy capable of slowly draining his health and wrap himself in a protective field of dark energy. After Xemnas absorbs the remnants of Kingdom Hearts, his power over darkness increases and he uses it alongside the powers of light, with him not only retaining the ability to cast a draining orb of dark energy, which is somewhat enhanced, but also becoming capable of creating thorns of black energy and surrounding the entire arena of his final battle with darkness as part of his desperation move.

   Darkness is even used by Sora in the game. He is able to control darkness in his

   , where he turns into a shadowy silhouette of himself and attacks enemies with darkness. In addition to greatly enhancing his speed and agility, allowing him to unleash devastating barrages of attacks in moments and easily avoid attacks, he can also unleash a burst of darkness and even fire a large barrage of dark magic blasts.

   When Sora and the others confront Xemnas, he asks the warriors why they hate darkness. King Mickey replies that they do not really hate it, they are just scared of it. He goes on to say that the world has both light and darkness, and darkness is half of everything. He then says that it makes him wonder why they are scared of the dark. Riku answers that "it's because of what's lurking inside it", meaning Xemnas and the other villains.

The moves that can be bought at the shop are Dark Roll, in which Riku turns into a shadow that glides a significant distance away from the enemy and a Dark Barrier, which blocks all incoming attacks. He also has four other moves that he obtains at different parts of the game. When blocking, he can use Counter Aura which he raises his keyblade and sends out a wave around him of darkness, blasting enemies back. Similarly, after being hit by an enemy attack, Riku can use Payback Blast to shoot the nearest enemy with a homing dark projectile from the tip of his keyblade.

   The Organization XIII naturally uses darkness. In addition to using Corridors of Darkness, they display the ability to summon and turn others into Heartless which they use to both create Heartless to test Sora and then to unleash the massive Heartless army they used against the Guardians. In addition to Vanitas, Terra-Xehanort, and Ansem keeping their ability to use darkness in battle, Xehanort would also wield the powers of darkness in both his Armored form and with the X-Blade, calling upon darkness to increase the power of his attacks and then to rain down meteors of darkness.
