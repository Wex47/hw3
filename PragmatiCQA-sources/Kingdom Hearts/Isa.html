   Like his Nobody Saïx, Isa is much quieter and more mature than his companion, Lea, with a similar speaking tone. He has no interest in fighting on Lea's side in a childish challenge, but is shown smiling as Lea and Ven fight. He is shown having a more carefree personality compared to his Nobody and values his friendship with Lea. He also has a comical side, as he jokingly tries to forget about his friendship with Lea. He is rather sarcastic and doesn't hesitate to mock Lea after he loses his fight with Ventus, though he does so jokingly. Isa values his friendships as he became Saïx again to locate a female friend that he and Lea made when sneaking into Radiant Garden's castle. He and Lea even became apprentices to Ansem the Wise in order to free their unknown friend. It is revealed in secret reports that this was one reason Saïx and Axel worked to have Saïx rise in the ranks of the Organization after Isa and Lea became Nobodies, which was to locate their missing friend.

   Isa wears a short-sleeved, navy blue jacket with a light blue stripe going along his shoulders to the ends of his sleeves. The jacket's collar is rather high and is sky blue, as are the ends of the sleeves and the bottom hem of the jacket. There is a yellow crescent moon symbol prominently displayed on the left chest of the jacket, referencing Saïx's attribute in
   Organization XIII
   .

   Isa appears to wear a black undershirt, as well as white pants and black shoes with what appears to be a grayish trim on the bottom. He looks about the same age as
   Ventus
   . His blue hair resembles his Nobody's in style, but shorter; Isa's hair is slightly longer than jaw-length. Like with Lea, the back of Isa's hair is spiked upward. He lacks Saïx's X-shaped scar and other facial features, having marine-colored eyes and normal pierced ears.
  </p>
  <p key="0d3f5a39-1c7a-4fc2-beb5-69aed0daf1da">
   After returning back to normal, Isa's appearance was similar to his Nobody self Saïx, retaining the cross-shaped scar on his face but losing his yellow eyes and pointed ears that symbolised his carrying of Xehanort's heart. He wears a black tracksuit and jeans.

   When
   Ventus
   goes to Radiant Garden looking for

   , he meets Isa and Lea. Lea challenges Ventus to a duel, while Isa watches them and smiles. After the battle, Lea calls Isa out for not trying to make up excuses for his loss and declares that he should have had Ventus for a best friend rather than him, causing Ventus and Isa to laugh. After this, Isa and Lea walk off and look up at the castle, apparently "ready".

   watching on. Later, Lea buys
   sea-salt ice cream
   from
   Scrooge McDuck
