   Although initially a mischievous individual who would often skip work and perform acts that almost always got him in trouble, even at those times Mickey displays bravery and dedication to his goals, as he never gives up as a musketeer despite his sword skills not being excellent and would save Sora from a Heartless ambush despite later on leaving in a hurry whenever in trouble so Sora could solve it himself.

   By the time he became Yen Sid's apprentice and the King of the Disney Castle, Mickey has matured considerably, becoming a kind, brave, and noble king, no longer being afraid to fight for the side of good and fully willing to defend those who needed it, although it borders on the level of recklessness as he disobeyed Yen Sid to help the worlds upon learning of the danger that is occurring, but he also was willing to accept whatever punishment Yen Sid has for him afterwards by handing over his Keyblade believing he would be disqualified with dignity despite being sad. This trait later on becomes more of a tactical last resort, as he enters a Corridor of Darkness into the Realm of Darkness at Twilight Town as it was the only way with all the points to enter the Realm of Darkness disabled and has already planned ahead to stop the chaos.

   Mickey values above all else friendship and integrity much more highly than others. He has little care for his noble position and often prefers his closest friends to address him by his name, such as when he and Riku bonded during their adventure in

   , but at the same time he can command respect and loyalty from his subjects, ruling his world unchallenged and with Donald and Goofy obeying his mysterious orders upon his disappearance. Although Goofy and Donald have implied that he is not above punishing his subjects for disobedience, Mickey is shown to be rather flexible in that he is left impressed by Donald and Goofy's loyalty to Sora by disobeying his orders to leave Hollow Bastion and lets them off with a smile. When his friends are hurt, Mickey is fully capable of getting serious and displaying actual anger, as seen during the

   ; he took a role on the battlefield after Goofy was presumed dead, although when push comes to shove, he can, albeit with reluctance, abandon his friends when the situation is truly extremely dire, as he left Aqua in the Realm of Darkness to save all the worlds from the danger of being completely taken over by darkness.

He reveals to Aqua that it has been 10 years since the two of them had last met, and that he had entered the Realm of Darkness via a Corridor of Darkness that appeared at the verge of a world's destruction, as he noted on how unstable the points that he could have used to enter the Realm of Darkness normally and the only way was to do it. Unfortunately, he was too busy trying to get in that had not conceived of a way back, a trait of his that Aqua remembers and amuses her. Mickey goes on to explain that he is seeking the Keyblade of the dark realm, so that he and Sora can seal Kingdom Hearts.

Hearing Aqua's story about Sora and Riku, Mickey realizes that the Keyblade must be hidden nearby, and leads Aqua to the Secret Place; before they are able to enter, however, the Demon Tide attacks and forces them into combat. With their combined effort, they are able to repel the Demon Tide and disperse of it. Mickey and Aqua enter the Secret Place and open the door within, which concealed the Kingdom Key D. Mickey subsequently claims it for his own, at which point the islands vanish, leaving the two of them in the Realm of Darkness.

Aqua buys time for Mickey by attacking the Demon Tide in return, which takes hold of Aqua and drags her back to Destiny Islands, sealing the path behind him.

   The epilogue returns to the Mysterious Tower, in which Mickey has finished relating his story. Riku angrily lashes out at Mickey for not telling him about Aqua sooner, but Yen Sid dismisses Riku's complaints, stating that although it was possible for them to enter the Realm of Darkness, previously none of them then had the means necessary to return with her, and that telling them sooner would have had negative consequences. Mickey then reveals to Riku that in order to gather the final pieces of the Seven Lights, the two of them will embark on a rescue mission for Aqua, to which Riku agrees to. Yen Sid bestows upon the two of them new garments that defend against the darkness before they depart for the Realm of Darkness.

   Utilizing the power of waking to protect them and his keyblade to open gateways to the Dark Realm, Mickey travels with Riku to the Realm of Darkness to find Aqua. As they walked, Mickey expressed concern for Riku when he briefly stopped but soon expressed pride for his growth and attributed it to his newfound ability to care so much. He also admits that he was concerned as his ability to detect Aqua gets hazier the closer they get and the Realm of Darkness has evolved since their last time. Although brushing off Riku's concerns, Mickey's own concerns soon proved to be justified as when they traced her trail to the Dark Margin, they find no trace of her. Sadly rebuking Riku's idea of Aqua returning to the Realm of Light, Mickey attributes this to Aqua falling into an even deeper abyss and though he may be able to find her if they go deeper, neither of them are equipped enough to dive any deeper. Soon enough, the Demon Tower appears, nearly kills Riku and breaks his Keyblade in half and though Mickey forces the Demon Tower to retreat, his Keyblade was damaged. With their Keyblades disabled and the Heartless' strength even greater than expected, the situation was effectively a loss and Mickey and Riku fell back in defeat, with Mickey having to convince Riku to retreat to regroup and resupply when Riku insists on staying to save Aqua from the same fear and loneliness he once felt in the Dark World.

   At the Mysterious Tower, Mickey and Riku rendezvous with Sora, Donald and Goofy where they reveal they failed to recover Sora's lost powers, which Mickey lamented but as Riku stated it, they didn't do any better. Mickey laments on how Aqua's trails have vanished and no one close enough to Aqua remains active, as Eraqus is dead, Terra and Ventus's whereabouts are currently unknown. Yen Sid suggests that as Aqua visited many worlds during her own journey, it may be prudent for Riku and Mickey to follow her footsteps to gain clues to her current whereabouts. He provides new garments for Kairi and Lea, and requests that Riku and Mickey deliver them when they visit Merlin to gain new Keyblades. Mickey travels with Riku to Radiant Garden, the last place Aqua was seen in the Realm of Light. They discuss the path of Xehanort's heart through time and vessels, and the realization that the Xehanort that served Ansem the Wise was in fact a possessed Terra. After a phone call from Sora, they head into the castle to discuss the replica project with

She claims Mickey's Keyblade, planning to use it to return to the Realm of Light, leaving Mickey and Riku trapped behind as she was, as Mickey sadly looks down in regret over leaving her trapped for so long. Riku connects with his replica's heart and uses their combined strength to confront Aqua and the Demon Tower. The fight takes its toll on Riku and, faltering, he speaks Sora's name. This connection allows Sora to enter the realm of darkness, where he defends Mickey and Riku and defeats Aqua, freeing her from the darkness.

   After this, Mickey and Riku rest at The Mysterious Tower while Sora escorts Aqua to go wake up Ventus. After retrieving Ventus and Kairi and Lea return from their training, the whole team regroups at Yen Sid's Tower and Mickey takes the opportunity to apologize to Ventus and Aqua for being unable to find Terra. Aqua assures him that he shouldn't feel sorry because he is Aqua and Ventus's responsibility. Donald also takes the time to share that Mickey is a true Keyblade Master. After that, Yen Side instructs everyone to rest for the day and prepare for the final battle the next day.

   The seven guardians of light along with Donald and Goofy arrive at the Keyblade Graveyard, ready to clash with the thirteen seekers of darkness. They are greeted by Master Xehanort. Gradually, Xemnas, Ansem, Vanitas and Young Xehanort also arrive to taunt the seven guardians of their impending failure. The seekers of darkness then unleash a massive swarm of Heartless, Nobodies and Unversed for the guardians to fight.

   After dealing with the swarm, the guardians are soon approached by Terra-Xehanort who proceeds to engage the team. Before Terra_Xehanort can do too much damage, Donald destroys him with ZettaFlare. Donald collapses due to magic overuse and Mickey and Goofy rush to Donald's side. Mickey suggest the group head back to safety but Riku points out it's too late. A heartless swarm soon forms and proceeds to sweep up all the guardians. Mickey loses his heart in the process. Luckily, Sora was able to save everyone and bring them back to the point before their initial defeat at the hands of Terra-Xehanort. The guardians confront Terra-Xehanort again but their encounter is interrupted by the Lingering Will who takes the fight away from them. The guardians are soon confronted by a Demon Tide with a massive horde of Heartless and Nobodies. Mickey and Riku pair off to fight the heartless. Their fight with the heartless is cut short by a heartless swarm forming and sweeping up all the enemies, followed by Sora defeating the swarm thanks to the light of the past. The guardians are soon approached by Dark Riku who summons a horde of heartless to surround them. When the situation seemed bleak, Mickey then quickly moved to cast Stopza to allow the guardians to escape the heartless horde. Before he can cast it he is stopped by Riku who tells him using that spell against that many enemies will leave him to exhausted to fight the Organization, causing Mickey to reluctantly back down. The Guardians are saved by Yen Sid who holds off the heartless with Donald and Goofy to allow the guardians to proceed to the final fight. The guardians soon confront the Real Organization XIII. Master Xehanort initiates the final battle by creating a maze called the Skein of Severance. The guardians soon split up to fight their final battles.

   Mickey faces off against Xemnas, Luxord, Larxene, and Marluxia and despite being four-on-one, he effectively stands his ground against them, with not a single significant hit connecting on the king, who seamlessly maneuvered through all their attacks and pushed back Marluxia and Larxene while also keeping a good eye on Xemnas, who didn't seem to be launching any significant offense, instead levitating out of the fight, and countering Luxord's card attacks. Sora soon approaches to help out Mickey. In response Xemnas soon erects a barrier made of Nobody Thorns. After Mickey and Sora soon push back the Organization, Xemnas powers up Luxord and leaves. Luxord then creates one final game for Sora. He attempts to hit Sora with a card but it is blocked by Mickey. However, this traps Mickey in a card and Luxord now uses him as a hostage. Sora eventually frees Mickey after defeating Luxord and thanks Sora for helping him. Mickey and Sora then proceed to defeat Marluxia and Larxene. Afterwards, Mickey chases after Xemnas and tells Sora to assist the others.

   Sometime later, Riku and Mickey are soon reunited with Sora. The 3 are soon approached by Master Xehanort, Young Xehanort, Ansem and Xemnas. Mickey and Riku soon learn from Sora that Kairi has been taken hostage by Xemnas and Xehanort and now have no choice but to complete the 13 clashes. The three defeat Young Xehanort, Ansem, and Xemnas but Xehanort is able to slay Kairi to provoke Sora to clash with Xehanort to make the 13th key needed for the X-blade. Instantly provoked by the death of a fellow guardian, Mickey furiously casts the spell Ultima, but the spell is interrupted when Xehanort casts Stopza to prevent the spell from being cast. After the time magic's spell wears off, Mickey informs the guardians that they still have a chance to win, as they can use Xehanort's ability to move through time against him to trap him and defeat him. Mickey attempts to enlist Aqua and Riku to help him do the job, but Sora intervenes and states his desire to do so. After some convincing, Mickey allows Sora to finish off Xehanort while Mickey and the other guardians close Kingdom Hearts. After closing Kingdom Hearts, Mickey and the other guardians follow their hearts to Sora, Donald, and Goofy who just defeated Xehanort. After Xehanort hands Sora the X-blade and admits defeat, the other guardians completely close Kingdom Hearts and return to the Keyblade Graveyard. Sora announces his desire to save Kairi using the Power of Waking. Mickey tries to warn Sora not to as he might lose his heart in the process. Riku and Sora convince Mickey to believe in Sora. He then wishes Sora a safe journey.

   Despite his small size, having been trained by Yen Sid, who was considered to be a great Keyblade Master, King Mickey wields tremendous skill with his Keyblade. He very effectively uses the advantages afforded by his size and agility to the maximum in order to easily counter and wear down his foes, flipping and spinning attacks, and finishing them with wide strokes of his blade and his body possesses the strength to deal crushing blows despite his size. Even with his training being incomplete, he could effectively fight side-by-side alongside Aqua and Ventus, both of whom being exceptional Keyblade wielders in their own right, in aiding them against Vanitas, successfully forcing Vanitas to flee, with Vanitas later resorting to surprising Mickey rather than taking him on directly to capture him in Neverland, although when Vanitas had the X-Blade, Mickey was forced back. At the present, as a full-fledged Keyblade Master, Mickey's level of prowess with his Keyblade is described as being superior to the likes of Sora and Riku at one point due to their lack of experience compared to Mickey, which shows itself by Mickey's superior feats compared to Sora and Riku: He is capable of effortlessly taking down many Nobodies and Heartless with a single attack,  even able to easily destroy 3 Darkside Heartless, indicating the gap between him and Sora at the time of the first game was great due to Sora being a mere fledgling despite his already considerable abilities, and later on managed to single-handedly fight through the legion of Heartless that proved a difficult challenge for Sora, Donald and Goofy without showing any strain.

   , while Riku was knocked out by the Demon Tower in the Realm of Darkness, Mickey alone single-handedly defeated the powerful Heartless into retreat, killing off half of the Heartless composing it and freeing Riku. He was even able to take on Marluxia, Larxene and Luxord by himself with masterful efficiency, quickly forcing back Marluxia and Larxene in close combat after only several clashes while parrying Luxord's magic cards, sustaining no injuries until Sora came to aid him, after which their combined strength were able to swiftly push back the three powerful Nobodies and after being freed from being briefly trapped by Luxord, he and Sora quickly overpowered and defeated Marluxia and Larxene without any scratches done to them. He would proceed to aid Sora and Riku into defeating Xemnas, Ansem and Young Xehanort and remained standing quite well while Riku was kneeling. The most prominent display of Mickey's skill was how Mickey single-handedly fended off the attacks of all Replica Xehanorts despite being injured. Mickey is also perfectly capable of using Keyblades other than his own, as in addition to using his Star Seeker, upon finding the

   makes him capable of making good use of it in combat, with just about all his offensive spells and even supportive ones being based on the element of light, ranging from projecting homing balls of bluish energy in the form of the spell "Pearl" to even using the ultimate light-magic spell "Holy" in 358/2 Days as his Limit Break, where he surrounds himself with hovering balls of light that acts as a shield and fires beams of light that can be charged to make one large beam and 3 thinner beams surrounding in a triangle formation and his final limit summons a storm of light rays and two orbs of light, as well as firing orbs and showers of light and manifesting a burst of light capable of both stunning enemies and healing Riku. Mickey is also capable of using Light to perform a special form of healing spell called "Healing Light" that would fully heal Sora both in HP and MP. In
   <i key="a6401ec7-277e-4791-a275-56dd4df48858">

   , Mickey even proves capable of casting a light-elemental version of "Ultima" that, while not completely cast, projected a wide orb of light that Xehanort had to use the most powerful of Stop spells to counter and even then it should be noted Mickey had managed to pressure and greatly wane the spell's strength as he seemed to be successfully clashing with and pushing the elderly Keyblade Master's Stopza back a bit before ultimately being overcame and although the spell still reached far enough to immobilize Riku, Mickey was successful enough to allow his and Riku's recovery to be far faster than when he stopped the Organization XIII with the same spell. Although not displayed often, Mickey is also capable of using Light to empower his physical attacks and greatly enhance his speed, as shown in
   <i key="0c4781f6-99c8-4271-9459-3afdb4073c6b">

   , where he can warp and deal blows able to instantly finish off Heartlesses in the Realm of Darkness when using "Wayfinder". When facing the Replica Xehanorts, Mickey displayed the enormous level of power he has over Light by being able to, despite being injured, repel the foes with a burst of light and also block and cut through their blasts with an orb of light. He was even able to simultaneously shield against all 13 of their blasts and with help from Sora, eventually overpower the attack, proceeding to empower his Keyblade so much that he was able to create a large blade of light that cut down the Replica Xehanorts instantly and blast the rest to oblivion with a large beam of light. He is also capable of using the normal "Cure" quite well, instantly healing Ventus from the severe beating Vanitas put on him and is capable of casting Curaga in

   , where he cast a Stopza spell strong enough to hold the resurrection of Xehanort and the rest of the Organization XIII for a considerable length of time to try to save Sora and only Young Xehanort is able to break free and only because of his powers over time and even then he still briefly froze and he was confident he could freeze all the Heartless and Nobodies attacking them in the final battle, although Riku stated he would be exhausted from doing so. He was also proficient with the Reflect magic, able to help Aqua and Xion in casting the powerful Refleza spell, blocking the attacks of the Replica Xehanorts before being broken through in the end.

   Mickey is capable of levitating himself above the ground, doing so in most of his coordinated attacks with allies. He can even actually fly, although it remains unknown how he is able to do so, as he was able to fly all the way to Aqua in the Dark Realm and keep them in the air until finding soft ground.
  </p>
  <p key="74a94f59-8f33-42b5-b43f-1923b6fe6cfc">
   Despite his small body, Mickey has displayed astonishing resilience and durability beyond that of any normal person of his size and body, as shown by how he survives a powerful lunging attack from the Demon Tower that ripped his clothes and violently threw him to the ground with no injury and quickly stands back up and later on when he is able to survive being constantly spin around by the Demon Tide while restrained and remain conscious, surviving being once again violently knocked down after being freed and quickly regaining consciousness soon after. Mickey was even so resillient that despite having been considerably injured, he was able to stand up twice and fight against the Replica Xehanort until defeating before collapsing and even then was able to retain consciousness and swiftly recover to help the Guardians deliver the fatal blow to Armored Xehanort.

   Among the strongest proponents of the light, in addition to his previously stated abilities to control light in combat, the strength of Mickey's heart is so great that not only has he never fought with his inner darkness, but the large amount of time he spent in the Dark Realm as well as wielding his Dark Realm Keyblade, the Kingdom Key D, is a polar opposite to Sora's Light Realm Keyblade, the Kingdom Key has no effect on him. Traveling with the

   also completely has no effect on him. Mickey's strength in the light is even great enough that while trapped in the Realm of Darkness, he can still project a portion of himself that can still use a rather formidable level of power over light to aid Riku, even capable of supressing Ansem long enough for Riku to regain consciousness after he only barely defeated Lexaeus with Dark Mode. Upon managing to return fully, he easily prevents Ansem from possessing Riku forcibly when he was nearly overwhelmed. Later on, Mickey was able to hold the massive projection of Sora's Heartless at bay with a beam of light long enough for Sora to destroy the actual form of the heartless. Mickey has the capability to coat himself with light to survive in the Lanes Between even when unconscious and is also capable of traveling through worlds using light, as he easily reaches Riku before Sora could be turned into a vessel of Xehanort. With the Kingdom Key D, he also has the power to open doors to the realm of darkness and can combine this with the power of waking to enter and leave with others trapped inside the realm unharmed.

After coming out, he was able to stay out of the Organization's eyes while simultaneously keeping watch of some of their activities without requiring aid from Riku or his allies, knowing enough to be able to deduce the Organization was planning to stall time, although due to having only himself to rely on, he was not able to gather as much information on their activities as Riku could with DIZ helping him.
