   The secret ending opens with
   Terra
   and
   Master Xehanort
   standing in a black abyss. The two have a faint glow around them, as they are actually their hearts inside the new
   Xehanort
   , and are conversing. Master Xehanort wonders aloud how Terra can still remain there after being possessed. Terra responds that it is still his body and heart, and he will eventually expel Master Xehanort.
  </p>
  <p key="d891358b-c9ce-4c1d-98b4-f5c4b3ece835">
   Master Xehanort merely shrugs this off, convinced that Terra will not be able to counter the darkness as he could not handle his own, but Terra reveals that
   Master Eraqus
   is residing within him, and no matter what the cost, he will not stop fighting until he has foiled Master Xehanort. The elderly Keyblade Master shows no concern, and gleefully informs Terra that possessing him was merely one of many roads he chose to take.

   's castle. Braig approaches him and attempts to start conversation but finds himself completely rebuked. Shocked at his lacking response, Braig immediately deduces that the new Xehanort surely has lost all of his memories. Looking into Xehanort's eyes, he asks precariously if the man standing before him is actually Terra, but Xehanort still does not answer.

  <p key="ba2b97c6-5035-4b2a-9c99-58b6ace289da">
   Braig pats him on the back and states lightly that it doesn't matter, and that he's "got his back." As the two walk on,
   Ienzo
   and Ansem the Wise appear in the hall, holding hands and eating
   sea-salt ice cream
   . Just before they turn a corner, Ienzo stops, gaining his master's attention. Ienzo turns his head to see Braig and Xehanort walking away together behind them. Ansem also looks back thoughtfully at the backs of Xehanort and Braig.

   Aqua
   appears next to him, asks his name and how he ended up in the Dark Realm. Ansem remarks how rarely he has guests, says it is his second time on these shores (the first being referred to in the
   Ansem Reports
   from Kingdom Hearts II) and explains that his memory has faded almost completely, "much like the first time," (again, also explained in the Ansem Reports) so he has difficulty recalling his past. It appears that he was sent to the dark margin after the explosion of the machine he created to encode Kingdom Hearts, in The World That Never Was, during the events of Kingdom Hearts II.

   Darkness
   multiple times, but they were always saved by a boy wielding his Keyblade. Hearing this, Aqua asks if the boy's name happens to be Terra or
   Ventus
   . Ansem tells her that it is neither of them and explains further that it has been over a year since he had met the boy. He reflects aloud that through seeking vengeance he did many terrible things to the boy and his friends, causing so many people to suffer.
