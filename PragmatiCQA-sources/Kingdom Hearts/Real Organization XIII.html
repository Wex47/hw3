   Young Xehanort
   . Tasking him to seek out as many splintered versions of his heart as he could, Ansem bestowed Young Xehanort the power to manipulate time in order to fulfill this goal. While Young Xehanort traveled through time to collect hearts worthy enough to serve the new Organization, Ansem and
   Xemnas
   both attempted to access Kingdom Hearts through their own methods, though both failed and were subsequently destroyed, resulting in the recompletion of
   Terra
   and later Master Xehanort himself, who assumed control of the new Organization.

Despite this, Xehanort retreats to the roof of the cathedral at the top of the town, and the trio chase after him. When they arrive, Xehanort summons the χ-blade and fights the heroes one last time, but despite summoning and using the power of Kingdom Hearts, Xehanort is ultimately defeated once and for all. Once the other guardians arrive, the heart of

As Xehanort begins to die, he is caught by Eraqus, and together the two ascend to Kingdom Hearts in the afterlife, leaving the guardians to use the χ-blade to close Kingdom Hearts, ending the threat of Xehanort once and for all.

He was requested to join the Real Organization by Saïx in order to complete his work on the Replica Program, which would result in the creation of nigh-perfect replicas that could become full-fledged humans and act as vessels for the time-traveling members of the Real Organization. However, his real motives of joining was to use his work on the Replica Program to atone for the misdeeds in the past, and to supply his replicas to those who truly deserve them. Secretly, Saïx was also assisting Vexen in this ploy as well.

    - Eliminated by Sora, Donald and Goofy. Xehanort explains that his motives for everything was to reset the world with the light of Kingdom Hearts, as the darkness within the hearts of the weak polluted the world, devouring what was left of the light. He also reveals that while he himself used darkness, he was only using it to fulfill his goals, and that the world needs someone to lead and dictate their destinies. Nevertheless, the old Keyblade Master finally accepts his defeat thanks to
    Master Eraqus
    , whose heart emerges as a spirit from Terra's heart. Xehanort then hands over the χ-blade to Sora and finally joins Kingdom Hearts alongside Eraqus in the afterlife. He was the thirteenth and final member to be eliminated.
