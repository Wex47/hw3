   The fact that he acts as the mastermind behind Lexaeus and Vexen shows that his rank in the Organization may in fact be higher than his number would lead one to believe. This is further reinforced by an additional scene in

   where he is seen to have a conversation with Xigbar. He reprimands Xigbar's habit of eavesdropping, and even talks down to him, stating that he should get back to work. When Xigbar informs him that he was hoping to just have a "friendly chat" with him, Zexion tells him he has more work to attend to, and finishes the conversation by telling Xigbar that if he is through working, then it would be in his best interest to get rest. In addition to this,
   Saïx
   had him eliminated so that he could rise in the ranks of Organization XIII.

   Zexion to some appears to be emotionally distant, but this is not completely true, as observed in his death. Upon hearing Axel's dialogue with the Riku Replica, Zexion's horrified reaction shows that he clearly does not want to die. He has an undying sense of duty to the Organization, and goes to almost any length to ensure the success of his missions. At times, he can also be humorous and jest with other members when the moment shows itself.
  </p>
  <p key="e5b7db53-966f-46c9-98f0-e7828c2b7694">
   A good example of this is in

   where it's shown that he and Axel are having a friendly gamble at which Organization member in the castle will be the next to die (something they've been apparently doing ever since Vexen got killed by Axel). Axel proves to win that particular round when he accurately predicts that Marluxia will be the next to die. Zexion is also particularly cheeky towards Vexen, giving dry and smart retorts when Vexen attempts to reprimand him with his superior ranking.
  </p>
  <p key="b4cc6f24-777e-4c5d-ab00-7495c99225cb">
   Zexion also prefers not to fight his opponents directly. As shown by his attempts to deceive Riku, Zexion prefers to use his powers of illusion to manipulate his enemies rather than directly fight them.
  </p>
  <p key="9545a071-9955-4ea9-bbca-961a0bbe7b61">
   It’s very likely Zexion values his bond with the Organization due to its founding members being his fellow apprentices to

   Despite being one of the Organization's founding members, Zexion physically appears to be among the younger members, and is certainly one of the smallest in stature (save for Roxas). He wears the signature black Organization cloak, boots, and gloves, though his cloak's sleeves are slightly bell-shaped. Zexion has bright aqua colored eyes, though only his left one is clearly visible, the right one being covered by his long, layered bangs.

On his left side, his bangs, though still rather long, are shorter than the right side, partially covering his ear. A few strands of hair fall over the exposed section of his face. The back of Zexion's hair is quite a bit shorter than the front.

   Zexion asks if he should repeat himself on what he thinks about eavesdropping, although Xigbar explains that he wasn't since he couldn't hear anything, asking Zexion if he knew anything about it. Zexion tells Xigbar that he would very much like to get his own work done, as should Xigbar, reminding him that they need to prepare the new facility at Castle Oblivion, but they still needed more hands on deck. Xigbar questions what Xemnas wanted with the castle, and although Zexion assures him that Xemnas revealed his intentions to them, Xigbar interrupts and tells him that there was something Xemnas didn't share. Xigbar explains that the Chamber of Repose is part of a pair, and that the Chamber of Waking is the other. He explains that it was constructed by someone other than Xemnas, and that it was where he would find his other "friend". Zexion silently stares towards the hooded Xigbar, pondering on what he had just heard.

   After Sora had been lured into Castle Oblivion, Zexion discovers two other scents deep in the dungeons of the castle. One of them belongs to a Maleficent formed from someone's memory, having been given life by Castle Oblivion's unique properties. Originally, he mistakes the other scent to be that of "the

   ". Eventually, however, Zexion and his cohorts determine that the scent belongs to Riku, who had appeared in the castle by force of will after Sora's arrival. Vexen hypothesizes that the darkness in Riku's heart,

   , caused Zexion to mistake him for "the Superior", calling the effect "fascinating." Specifically, Riku's heart is plagued by the presence of Ansem.

   he creates with combat data from the real Riku. However, Vexen is eventually killed on Marluxia's orders by Axel, whom Zexion and Lexaeus had been unsure about trusting. Axel later tells them he had performed the deed only to gain Marluxia's trust, and continues to cooperate with Zexion in tracking Sora and Riku.

   Seeing that Vexen's efforts to derail Marluxia's plan had failed, Zexion sends Lexaeus to sway Riku into joining them, but Riku refuses to allow darkness to control him and defeats Lexaeus in combat. With the last of his strength, Lexaeus manages to knock Riku unconscious, rendering him helpless. However, before he can finish the job, Ansem takes control of Riku's body and finishes Lexaeus with the power of darkness. Riku is then enveloped in his own personal darkness, where Ansem tries to seize his body once more—however, he is saved by

   After Lexaeus dies in his failed attempt to subvert Riku's resistance to darkness, Zexion discusses the Organization's fate with Axel and learns that Larxene has been killed as well, bringing the number of Organization members eliminated to three. Axel tells him that he himself was defeated by Sora as well, and that Marluxia is almost certainly the next to go. Zexion decides that with the possibility of Marluxia dying soon, Riku is no longer needed, and heads off to intercept him.
  </p>
  <p key="34e19311-9a98-4c63-8fdc-9a5c2f83db24">
   Zexion appears before Riku while he is between floors of the castle, immediately after the death of Marluxia. As the force of Marluxia's death shakes the castle, Riku halts with surprise and comments how a very strong scent in the air has died. Zexion materializes in front of him and tells him that Sora has just defeated Marluxia. Riku is surprised to learn that Sora is also in the castle, but Zexion tells him he would never be able to face him after having such darkness in his heart. He then gives Riku a

   While he explores it, Zexion reappears, and continues to play on his guilt, telling him Sora will always oppose him as a host of the dark. Zexion vanishes and Riku winds up facing a

  <p key="0980a2ff-f715-401e-b141-30f0b7613382">
   He wounds Sora, whose disguise falters to reveal Zexion, who had been using his powers of illusion to deceive Riku. Zexion is astounded by Riku's ability to control the darkness, and is also enraged at his perseverance. He decides to engage Riku in combat himself, albeit wounded, but still puts up a rather difficult fight. However, Riku eventually overcomes and defeats Zexion.
  </p>
  <p key="b7f41eca-657a-460d-b229-fbc37d71bcb5">
   After escaping from Riku, Zexion appears in the meeting room he shared with Lexaeus and Vexen, flabbergasted as to how Riku can wear darkness the way he does as no one has ever done so before. Waiting for him are Axel and a companion. In a panic, Zexion thinks Axel's companion is Riku himself, but then realizes it's only the

   </a>
   . Zexion suggests they pit the replica against the real Riku, though Axel directs the replica's attention to his lack of wholeness. He tells him that if he can find strength that the real Riku doesn't have, he can become a whole person of his own, rather than a mere puppet or whole copy of Riku.
  </p>
  <p key="cec0d018-1923-4bb7-89a5-e9301b5d822e">
   Axel then suggests that he should start by eliminating Zexion and take his powers for himself. Zexion is horrified by Axel's suggestion and tells him he can't do that, but before he can do anything, the replica grabs and absorbs Zexion's life force, taking his power and causing him to become the Organization’s fifth member to fade away; judging by Axel's line of Zexion finding out "way too much", Axel purposefully set this up in order to move Saïx up within the ranks of the Organization.

   , he has a unique fighting style; he steals and hoards Riku's cards until he has enough to use it in his own deck. He creates copies of his lexicon and telekinetically suspends them in the air and has them attack the opponent, which is his standard attack and steals Riku's attack cards. His standard sleights creates either a tornado of dark energy or a sphere of magnetic energy that drags Riku in, and then damages him while stealing his cards. When Zexion hoards enough cards, he copies the Soul Eater and copies himself, gaining the uses of two new devastating sleights. First is "Dark Punisher", where Zexion's copies vanish while Zexion grabs Riku and drains his HP, while the other is called "Catastrophe", in which he and his copies vanish and then reappear near the perimeter of the island and each fire an energy beam. The beams meet and slowly form a ball of energy as Zexion and his clones rotate around the island before the energy ball explodes over the entire island.
  </p>
  <p key="add90f8b-ca3c-4665-82b8-ed84e2fe8484">
   His standard attack now becomes a combo with each of the copies slashing once in turn. Meanwhile, the lexicons are spreads out through the island encased in blue flames. Each of those lexicons support and act as the health of a clone. Destroying a lexicon causes a clone to disappear, and the destruction of the last copy frees all the stolen cards, and Zexion reverts to attacking with his lexicons until he hoards enough cards again. However, even if Riku manages to steal his cards back, Zexion occasionally prepares a countermeasure of sorts by planting a dummy Soul Eater card amongst the scattered pile for Riku to collect. The card is distinguished by the "wing" of the blade's design being orange instead of red, as well as the Soul Eater facing the opposite direction. If the card is collected then used, it damages and stuns Riku momentarily, giving Zexion an opening to steal cards again. In addition, he can effectively restore all the destroyed Lexicons even after Card Break.
  </p>
  <p key="29aba930-dca9-4aea-9d3e-12b06b16fc1a">
   Zexion also has access to the "Elixir" Card, which will allow him to reload all his cards, and he can use his enemy card to gain the ability to inflict confusion with any strike.

   , Zexion returns as an optional boss. Zexion's fighting style is totally different; however, in the islands, his Absent Silhouette's only attack is to seemingly ensnare his prey in his lexicon, through use of illusion, causing them to hallucinate and physically feel any damage they believe they are taking. Once they have fallen victim to the illusion, they begin to see an area where lexicons float around, being conducted by Zexion, who makes himself appear as a lexicon himself to hide.
  </p>
  <p key="45c25467-d799-46b2-91c0-679cceac5d2c">
   Only the reaction command, Dispel, used on Zexion after depleting his fake HP frees them from the hallucination. Meanwhile, they are either bombarded by lexicon copies and explosions, ensnared in life-draining lexicons, or have their commands mixed up. However, if the right commands are selected, HP, MP, Munny balls, or experience points can appear, while another command temporarily removes all the decoy lexicons.

  <p key="1072aaff-0e02-4824-b73c-ff04324ea031">
   His greatest attack involves creating another illusion, which causes the victim to see a pitch black room, save for three spotlights, one of which will be blue. The blue light will rotate between the three lights thirteen times until it comes to a complete stop, after which the entire area will be bombarded by meteors, with Zexion's laughing heard. However, the spotlight where the blue light stops on will be protected by a barrier. Zexion is also forced into the barricaded area, leaving him vulnerable to attack.

   , Zexion has a Limit Break called Meteor Mirage. During Meteor Mirage, Zexion and his open lexicon are brought into the air. While in the air, Zexion summons many balls of dark indigo energy to bomb the field, dealing a large amount of damage to enemies hit by the barrage. During the bombardment, Zexion cannot move around to hit enemies that are further away with the meteors but, if you press B, you can cancel the limit to run to a better position and then press A to resume the attack.
