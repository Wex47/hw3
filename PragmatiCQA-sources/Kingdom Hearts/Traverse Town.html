   After the battle, Sora deduces that they won't be able to find Riku and the King in Traverse Town, but thinks they still may be somewhere in Castle Oblivion. Though everyone doesn't understand Sora's situation, they wish him luck and leave. However, Aerith returns briefly and tells Sora that she and everyone else may be nothing but a figment in Sora's memory (as Sora explained how he got to Traverse Town previously). It is proven true when Donald distracts Sora momentarily and she is not there when he looks back; Donald and Goofy couldn't see her. Sora now believes Aerith was right.

Using his powers, Joshua also creates two new districts, the fourth and the fifth district, and keeps the players from noticing when Sora and Riku fall asleep.

   Sora arrives in the First District, exclaiming in surprise upon discovering his new attire, quickly assuming that it "...must be more of Master Yen Sid's magic". Sora next discovers that Riku is no longer with him, and begins to shout Riku's name across the town. Here, Sora is met by a rather grumpy Neku, who scolds him for making so much noise, causing the surprised Sora to topple off of a balcony. Having already learnt Sora's name, Neku examines the budding Keyblade master's hand, and determines that Sora is not 'a Player'. Having explained to Sora exactly what a Player actually is and his current state of need, Sora offers to become Neku's game Partner, leading Neku to explain that his pact is with somebody else. Sora then offers to be a friend, to which Neku responds less than optimistically. Neku then leads him to the Second District, where the pair are attacked by Dream Eaters, at which point Sora discovers Neku's name. After an explanation about the role of Dream Eaters in the Game, Neku shows Sora how to create a Dream Eater. Neku then leads him to the Third District to settle his deal with Young Xehanort. However, the black-cloaked fiend appears to double-cross Neku, and then attempts to attack Sora, causing Neku to defend his new friend, stating that it wasn't part of the deal to hurt Sora. Sora abruptly falls asleep while Neku fights him, before awaking later to find both Neku and Young Xehanort to be gone.

   Having woken, Sora recounts the events before his slumber in his mind, concluding that it would not be right for Neku and the figure in the black coat to be in league with one another. Navigating his way to the newer areas of Traverse Town, he chances upon an amnesiac Rhyme, whom he believes could be Neku's Game Partner. He then decides to take Rhyme to Neku, and after searching, finds him in the Fifth District. Neku shows disbelief that Sora would still place his trust in him, even after having tricked his friend. Having explained the reasons behind the trickery, Sora forgives him, and then introduces Rhyme, who then vanishes mysteriously; Young Xehanort returns and leaves Hockomonkey to deal with them. Victorious, Sora meets Joshua, who teleported there from a second version of Traverse Town, which is where Riku is, and learns that he saved Rhyme by making her vanish. However, since the portal only works for Joshua , Sora is unable to travel to Riku. The small group discuss matters further, while watching the goings on in the other half of the world, with Neku, Rhyme and Sora all expressing a desire to meet with their friends...

Having introduced themselves to each other, Joshua explains to Riku what a Portal is, and the concept of Traverse Town's having been split into two. Joshua states that he would like Riku to help him find Rhyme, who's memories, according to Joshua, are the key to his Portal. Joshua then speculates that perhaps Sora might be on the other side of the portal, causing Riku to forget his initial mistrust of the boy and listen. Riku then agrees to aid Joshua in his search. They walk to the Second District, where Riku learns how to create Dream Eaters; they are attacked by Beat, who has been tricked by Young Xehanort into trying to take down Joshua in exchange for safe passage for Rhyme and himself. However, contrary to Beat's wishes, the Dream Eaters under his command ignore Joshua's presence and attack Riku instead. Joshua can be see chuckling to himself at this point. After a short conversation with Beat, who muses about his wanting to protect the one person who matters to him: Rhyme, Riku falls asleep.

Following some further teasing from Shiki, the two head to the Fifth District, where he learns of her deal with Young Xehanort. The enigmatic being wonders how Riku got into Sora's dreams, which is where he is, but puts the matter aside, sending Hockomonkey to attack him. After returning from the battle victorious, Riku sees a hologram of Sora, Neku, Rhyme and Joshua in the other Traverse Town.

   Sora arrives back in Traverse Town in the Fifth District to find Joshua waiting for him expectantly. After a short conversation about Joshua's tendency to sit above those he is addressing, he comes down to talk with Sora. The mysterious boy comments somewhat randomly on how Sora is turning more into Neku each day, but fails to elaborate on his meaning. They converse for a time about Riku, before the conversation turns to the players in the Reapers' game, who have all managed to find their game partners once again. Joshua outlines the basic principles of the game, and explains the concept of the missions which they need to complete in order to win the game. The task of this particular mission though, is to eliminate the formidable
   Spellican

   , while Shiki falls backwards into the fountain itself. When Sora states that he will deal with the Dream Eaters, Neku protests, saying that he doesn't need Sora's help. Sora however, is able to convince Neku that in order to look after Shiki, Neku needs to let him do the fighting. The stubborn boy reluctantly gives in, and Sora quickly dispatches of the Dream Eaters, though Spellican manages to escape to the other version of the world. Sora is then introduced to Shiki, before proceeding to embarrass Neku by telling Shiki how Neku had searched for her everywhere, and that he had also stated that "he needed her". The two game partners then converse for a short while, in which time Shiki comments that she thought it sweet how Neku had searched for her.

  <p key="c0557aab-cf2e-4a4c-af66-ed9acdd975b7">
   Joshua then arrives, explaining that Spellican has escaped to Riku's imagining of the world, and that it is necessary that they trap the Dream Eater in one place - the Third District. The three run off to fulfill the task, but Neku stops, before inquiring in a nervous voice as to whether they are going to make it home to Shibuya. Joshua reminds Neku that if he gives up on himself, he consequently gives up on the world. Neku then wishes for confirmation that he will see Joshua in his home world; Joshua expresses surprise at this question. However, Neku states that he considers Joshua to be his friend, and the other comments that perhaps it is Neku that is turning into Sora.

   Sora arrives at the Third District, where Spellican promptly appears via a Portal from Riku's version of the world. With Neku and the others handling the smaller enemies, Sora proceeds to take on the larger Nightmares summoned by Spellican. The large Dream Eater, however, continues to prove elusive, as it escapes to
   Symphony of Sorcery

Neku and Shiki express disappointment that they were unable to complete their mission, but their fears are soon settled when Sora offers to go after Spellican.

Riku sets off to aid Beat and Rhyme, but is stopped by Joshua, who explains that there is another problem at hand. When Shiki and Rhyme crossed the Portal between the two versions of the world to rendezvous with their partners, the time left on their game timer clocks were different. From this, the two conclude that the two versions of Traverse Town are in fact, two distinct worlds imagined by different people. Joshua comes to the conclusion that they are in a dream. Having finished conversing, Riku sets off for the Fountain Plaza.

   Upon his arrival, Beat, in a similar manner to Neku, denies that he needs any help from Riku. This however, turns out to be an act, as Rhyme describes how just a moment before, Beat had been asking about Riku's whereabouts, before introducing herself. Beat expresses his annoyance at Rhyme's continuous jabs at him, and Riku jokes that the two are "cut from the same cloth". Riku and Rhyme continue to laugh about Beat's act, as the Spellican begins to become impatient, before eventually squawking loudly at the trio. The large Dream Eater summons multiple smaller Nightmares, which Beat and Rhyme stay to deal with, while Riku chases the elusive Spellican himself. As he chases however, Spellican summons a herd of stampeding

Riku is thanked by Joshua, Rhyme and Beat, but given a warning by Joshua; because he is inside a dream, the dream may attempt to lie to him to convince him that it is in fact, real.

The east side of town includes the entrance to the Third District, as well as a set of roofs that can be climbed to reach treasures and a hidden entrance to a balcony in the Third District.

   Home to Flick Rush Coliseum, the Fourth District appears to be based on a more modern city than the other districts, which are Victorian in effect. Julius' journal entry suggests that this and the other new areas were created by Joshua. Many closed shops line the district, with a tower in the center (the building seen on the world map and in the image alongside this section) that has many lights hanging from it. Next to the Coliseum are the doors leading to the Fifth District, the handles being decorated with
   Hockomonkey
   's face on them.

   The Fourth District can be reached by passing through the Fountain Plaza, which houses an enormous fountain (which has a base shaped like a heart) and several more closed shops. One path leads to the Post Office, a giant area filled with numerous boxes of unsent letters containing many gadgets and gizmos to aid maneuverability through the area. At the end of the room is an elevator that leads up to mailbox in the 1st District. A second path leads to the Back Streets, a series of winding and confusing streets that lead back to an entrance in the 1st District near the Cafe.

   Reached solely from the Fourth District, the Fifth District is roughly the size of the Third District. The entrance area has palm trees on the edges of the platform leading to bridge to cross of the stream of water. There's a sign on the other side of the bridge, but it cannot be read. A Garden takes up most of the district, labeled "Flower &amp; Plant" while other buildings are inaccessible as seen by the shut windows. There are two alleyways on either side, both empty; it's suggested the other buildings could be used as dwellings for residents of Traverse Town. The top of the Garden has a glass roof, letting sunlight in for the plants inside; at the back is a two-level wall, which is also below another large window. Inside the Garden is a large gate keeping anyone from going any deeper into the area; this may lead to yet another area of the town, or lead to a small area where the entrances to the buildings lining the sides of the Fifth District are. The battle with Hockomonkey takes place here in Sora's story or within the Garden, in Riku's case. It also houses the first sleeping Keyhole.

   . The area consists of intertwined streets with tall, dark-colored houses lining all sides. Unique to this area is that the streets are not only on one level, but lie in both an upper area and a lower area, with bridges standing where one street crosses the one below. Another interesting feature of this area of Traverse Town are the two flowmotion waterways in roofed tunnels which arc around the back of the houses. Prominent on the walls of the houses is graffiti art, reminiscent of the characters of The World Ends with You.
