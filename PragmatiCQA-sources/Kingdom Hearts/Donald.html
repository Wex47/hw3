Donald and Goofy arrive in the Third District, where they attempt to fight some Heartless, but are unable to defeat them, and a massive explosion sends them flying through the air and right on top of Sora, where they immediately recognize the Keyblade in his hand.

Donald proceeds to tell a depressed Sora to cheer up if he wants to come with them ("You can't come along looking like that, understand? No frowning, no sad face. Okay? This boat runs on happy faces!"). Sora attempts to look happy, but only ends up making a fool of himself, much to Donald and Goofy's amusement. Nonetheless, Sora agrees to accompany them, and the three set off.

   Sora, Donald, and Goofy set off to many worlds, defeating Heartless, the Disney villains, and sealing
   Keyholes

   Deep Jungle

   Having been explicitly ordered to follow the Key, Donald and Goofy have no choice but to leave Sora and follow Riku, much to their regret. But eventually, with the aid of Beast, Sora catches up with Riku. With the Beast lured away by a Heartless feigning to be his beloved
   Belle
   , Riku attempts to eliminate Sora once and for all with a dark blast. However, Goofy comes to the rescue and blocks the attack, finding himself unable to betray Sora after all that they had been through together, and Donald rejoins them as well, saying, "All for one, one for all". Amazingly, the strength of their friendship also strengthens Sora's heart, and because his heart became stronger, he is able to regain the Keyblade, meaning that Donald and Goofy are no longer going against orders.

   They also come across Kairi's body, devoid of her heart. When Sora discovers that Kairi's heart rests within his own, he chooses to release it by stabbing himself with the dark Keyblade left behind by Riku, despite Donald and Goofy frantically trying to convince him otherwise. While Kairi's heart is restored, Sora's is lost, and he becomes a Heartless. Donald is clearly distraught by this, running over to Sora as he fades away and desperately screaming for him to come back, to no avail.

Donald and Goofy bravely make a stand against Ansem, but both know that they might be no match for him alone. Before Ansem can make his strike, however, Riku is able to take control, holding back Ansem temporarily. Donald and Goofy then attempt to escape with Kairi.

   Sora, having encountered a
   mysterious figure
   , goes with Donald and Goofy to
   Castle Oblivion
   . Inside, they discuss going further into the castle, realizing that all four of them, including Jiminy, feel that Riku and the King are in the castle. But before they can progress, they meet the mysterious man once more. Donald, assuming the man to be a Heartless, attacks, but finds out that none of his spells will function (It is never told how he relearns his spells as they progress into the castle as he is still used for magic as a friend card).
  </p>
  <p key="ba88068a-8c96-408b-9078-7c5684211346">
   The man reveals that Sora and his friends forgot every single ability they knew as soon as they entered the castle. In addition, the figure remarks that in this castle, they will find someone they know. Granting Sora a card, the figure leaves, and the others are compelled to follow.
  </p>
  <p key="9e31a9ad-fbff-4492-b298-8dee3f07a5d8">
   Sora, using the card, goes deeper into the castle, only to find that he is in Traverse Town. In addition, Donald and Goofy have disappeared, being at the mercy of the cards that control Castle Oblivion. After learning to battle, Sora reunites with Donald and Goofy, who have also gained new clothes. The three continue on, meeting memory versions of the people they have encountered in

   Unfortunately, as they progress through the castle, they find that their memories are slowly fading. One example would be how Donald forgets the name of the castle they had visited before: Hollow Bastion. But at the same time, they experience memories they had forgotten long ago, such as
   Naminé
   , a supposed former resident of Destiny Islands, and a friend of Sora. But in truth, their memories are being manipulated by Naminé herself.
  </p>
  <p key="1138c3e1-647b-43ea-be84-389eacba3444">
   Also, they begin to encounter members of

  <p key="ba776757-e850-40ec-9535-2cd3662cba7d">
   But they also meet Riku, who apparently is also striving to reach Naminé, but has once again turned on Sora. Donald and Goofy reason that Riku just forgot that Sora and he are friends, but Sora still slowly succumbs to anger at all the things that have been happening to him.
  </p>
  <p key="3e8ba96a-31c1-46d0-b69e-feb986c13d1d">
   The three, after Vexen had been eliminated by Axel, become separated once Sora's anger at the Organization's manipulations overcomes him. When Sora is caught off by Riku, who in turn is knocked unconscious by Naminé shattering Riku's memories apart, Larxene comes in for the kill. But Goofy and Donald come in the nick of time, saving Sora and defeating Larxene. It is then that they learn of Naminé's true nature, as well as the fact that the Riku before them is only a
   replica
   of the real person.
  </p>
  <p key="0ced4e98-e5cd-4bc3-b5e2-93b1e5f36007">
   Naminé tells them that she can restore their memories, but only after they defeat
   Marluxia
   , the lord of Castle Oblivion, who had been manipulating them the entire time they were in the castle. The three then travel to the 13th floor of Castle Oblivion. By this point, however, Donald and Goofy have forgotten about King Mickey, only recalling that they are looking for someone important.
  </p>
  <p key="767f95f2-48ec-456b-86de-9a3cbe7bd00f">
   As they make their way to Marluxia, the three also make an important promise: that no matter how far apart they are from each other, or if they have forgotten each other, they will always be friends. Using that promise as strength, they go on.
  </p>
  <p key="80a1c273-2ec2-4e40-bfbe-619e63c681e2">
   The trio then confronts Axel and Marluxia, with Marluxia using Naminé as a human shield. Marluxia escapes, but the three manage to defeat Axel, and soon after chase down and defeat Marluxia (after a round against a replica, and then the real thing). Naminé then leads them to
   Memory Pods
   , where they can sleep while Naminé fixes their memories. Donald and Goofy say goodnight, and leave, while Sora and Naminé say goodbye.

He also seems to be afraid of Daisy as shown at Disney Castle when she yells at him for missing their date.

  <p key="f881993f-4e82-4b2d-b2c2-8862f646f7c5">
   He also has somewhat of a greedy side, as commented when Sora and Goofy expressed worries that Donald would lose himself to the curse of the Aztec gold in
   Port Royal
   ; or when
   Abu
   stole a sparkling ruby and Donald became infatuated with it.

   Donald is an anthropomorphic duck with white plumage, a yellow-orange bill, legs of the same color, light blue eyes, and a short tuft of feathers on his head, visible under his hat. His outfit is a modified version of his original blue sailor's suit (in fact, he wears his original clothes in the opening of

   ). His blue hat, which resembles a beret, has a belt in place of a normal brim, and sports a zipper that spans the length of the hat. His high-collared jacket is navy blue with sky blue lining and cuffs. There are three pouches, all of which are blue with yellow lining, along the middle of the jacket; the center pouch is secured by a flap, while the other two use silver zippers.

  <p key="823d50d7-527f-460a-9b69-7eb07ad02c2c">
   The middle pouch is framed by two other silver zippers that span the entire length of the jacket, from the top of the collar to the bottom. He has a short, blue cape with yellow lining that he wears draped over his shoulders, kept in place by a silver strap. Donald also wears a thick, gold bangle on each of his wrists, and, like his cartoon version, he does not wear pants.

   , Donald is seen in a much different outfit during his tutelage under
   Yen Sid
   . Donald's hat in now much taller and resembles a stereotypical witch's hat, as well as the hat on his Mage's Staff. It is dark blue, has a wide brim with gold lining, and the tip curls in a very angular fashion. His navy jacket is now much longer and has a blue addition to the bottom that covers the lower half of his body. The sleeves are long and resemble those of a sweater, sporting vertical creases. The jacket now has two large, yellow buttons down the front, a gold-lined pattern of ovals, rather resembling Mickey Mouse's ears, on the lower half, and a blue belt tie around the waist.

   Donald also wears a shorter, light blue coat over his jacket, this one with more bell-like sleeves, gold lining and cuffs, a turtleneck-esque collar, and the two silver, vertical zippers present in his jacket in

   Donald's weapons

  <p key="86dd25b7-b2da-42eb-9e45-85967dc30931">
   Donald is the primary caster
   party member
   , and is capable of casting the same
   magic
   as Sora, while he picks up new spells by progressing through the game. His level is always slightly below Sora's at the start of the game, which works against him as he tends to fit the role of a 'glass cannon' due to his low
   HP
   . His
   Strength
   and
   Defense
   are generally fine, although the latter is on the low end for the first part of the game. As a spellcaster he does start with a total of three
   MP
   , maxing out naturally at ten (gaining one for each tenth level).
  </p>
  <p key="604600e9-8c18-4da0-a167-f1bf9fd51884">
   Although Donald can manage in melee combat, and does not do too poorly with his more Strength-oriented weapons, due to a lack of special attacks and low HP this is more often than not a bad choice. Instead it is recommended to customize his parameters to 'constantly' use magic, even if he tends to waste MP while doing so more often than not. His offensive spells can be devastating when used at the right moment. This is especially the case if you give him
   accessories
   that raise his MP, further boosting both his direct damage and maximum spell output.
  </p>
  <p key="ee7e7184-f3ec-4ab0-897d-730b70c8da71">
   As a downside he tends to fare poorly against bosses, as they often possess high resistances to magic, largely nullifying his potential, and deal enough damage to knock him out more often than not. And despite Donald's healing spells being being exceptionally useful when he times them right when you hit critical health, he can be equally unreliable by not healing you at all. In the late game he becomes a genuine powerhouse regardless, when he has enough staying power to last in a bossfight, and enough MP to repeatedly heal everyone and also throw around defensive
   Aeroga
   shields.
