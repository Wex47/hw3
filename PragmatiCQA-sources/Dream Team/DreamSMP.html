    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="c6f6d428-b90e-4dc4-a331-7c183c4ab46a">
   Dream is an excellent strategist, and is incredibly well-composed most of the time. He is a natural leader, seasoned in the art of military combat and, prior to his imprisonment, was often never seen without fully enchanted armor and several weapons. He is mysterious by nature, taking care to mask his true intentions and hide behind his composed persona in order to maintain a level of respect and fear.
  </p>
  <p key="32247bd2-99a8-4fbd-b255-9b24ef474ec5">
   Dream values control, and reacts violently towards any signs of a loss of control - this is proven by his instinctual reaction to declare war on the newly budding independent nation of L'Manberg. Above all else, Dream hopes to unite the server as "one big happy family," and most of his actions lead to this greater goal - Dream is devoted to this cause, often disregarding personal attachments to further his own progress.
  </p>
  <p key="06d58374-415f-42ac-a054-1703570c7297">
   Dream cites attachment as the greatest power of the server, and as a result, sought to control it, even aiming at one point to obtain and control one item of value from every server member. Prior to canon, he was once closer to some other members of the server, such as
   <a href="SapnapSMP.html" key="bc491cd8-499a-4ac2-acda-4c07a71458b2" title="Sapnap/SMP">

   , but would come to favor his ambitions for unity over his attachments, cutting his own ties in order to become uncontrollable. This would ultimately fail, as he was not able to cut his attachment with Tommy, causing his downfall.
  </p>
  <p key="d8087090-8ce7-4bb0-afc5-28c9dd6fba96">
   Dream often shows extreme confidence when he assumes he has the upper hand, though this facade easily falls as soon as his plans start to fail: when it appears he is about to die in the Disc Confrontation, Dream is reduced to begging for his life. He is typically difficult to anger, and usually appears detached from the server, frequently appearing as some sort of higher power - this idea is furthered by the method in which he acts to help
   Pogtopia
   during the rebellion. Dream is careful to remain distant from others, but the reason for this is debatable.
  </p>
  <p key="cc12afa7-c822-457a-9911-02831d0e63ce">
   As time has passed, Dream has developed a God complex, going so far as to proclaim that he is a god after successfully resurrecting Tommy. He has seemingly lost a grasp of reality to some degree, most likely as a direct effect of imprisonment and torture. Even before imprisonment, when he lost his temper, Dream would become dangerously emotional, acting rashly and impulsively - this is clearest in the final stages of Tommy's exile, where Dream detonates all of Tommy's belongings.
   Recently, after Technoblade

However, Tommy claimed that Dream had no dominance over him, as while Dream didn't possess any leverage over Tommy, it wasn't the same the other way around. Tommy then threatened to burn the leather of his dead horse, Spirit. Dream was conflicted and was forced to comply, if only for a few minutes as the L'Manbergians humiliated him. Snapping and realizing that Tommy could forever hold Spirit over his head, Dream then retorted that he didn't "give a

In addition, Dream rewarded L'Manberg by officially recognizing them as an independent nation for the first time and even offering them support from his faction.

However, Dream went through with the idea by crowning Eret as king again, straining his relationship with George, Quackity, and Sapnap. During an argument with Quackity, Dream debated that he had caused no conflict on the SMP, and that Tommy was the instigator of all of the conflicts. Dream painted himself as a peacekeeping figure of the SMP, but the other members denied it.

   Dream was the only one to consistently visit Tommy during his exile, eventually causing Tommy to believe that Dream was his only friend. Dream's treatment of Tommy in exile can easily be classified as abuse, with Dream doing things such as forcing Tommy to give up all of his items every day, and making Tommy feel as though he had to comply with everything Dream said. Eventually, after finding out Tommy had been keeping a secret stash of items from him, Dream blew the items and all of
   Logstedshire

   Punz
   was the only one loyal to Dream throughout the history of the SMP, often acting as his right hand man. Although this loyalty was achieved through a mercenary agreement, with Dream paying Punz vast amounts of wealth for his allegiance, both parties admitted that it had grown to more than just a money contract. Punz stated that he'd still be loyal to Dream even if not for the money, although the sincerity of this statement is questionable.

   On December 17, Dream called Punz to go for a walk with him. On the walk, Dream proposed Punz fraudulently turn against him, and become a spy on the inside of L'Manberg. Dream wanted to create an impression that everyone had turned against him, and that they could rally the population against Dream and overthrow him, when that was not the case. Dream suggested that they could plan a scripted event, where Dream would do something hurtful to Punz, and Punz would pretend to be hurt and leave his side, then, with this new trust and mutual "hate" for Dream, Punz would be welcomed into L'Manberg and provide intelligence for Dream.

Dream confirmed that no one in L'Manberg, except for Quackity, knew about the prison, and Quackity did not suspect or know the true intentions and purpose of it. He reminded Punz that the goal was always for "one united server," or "one giant family"; everyone followed the same rules, and there were no other countries. He claimed that there was something he'd do soon that no one would like him for, then named Punz as leader of his faction, as he did not want his faction to start crumbling.

However, as the L'Manberg festival was ongoing with festival games, it was spotted that Dream started to build obsidian walls around the country, something that he only did when punishing the country. As the citizens swarmed to question his actions, Dream rebutted in regards to Tommy's fault, before leading the citizens to the Community House, where it was blown up and destroyed. A series of conversations would lead to Tommy betraying Technoblade to be on Tubbo's side, and thus Dream's offer of cooperation with Technoblade.

However, as he knew the redstone contraption and redstone could be easily removed and destroyed, decided not to place the needed dispensers, redstone and repeaters just yet.

Dream used repeaters and redstone, along with dispensers, to create a continuous flow of lit TNT raining down into the country. The TNT would continue falling down for around 10 minutes, before they would slow down, with duplicate TNT only falling from one station to another, as Dream would go back and forth refilling dispensers.

Tommy questioned Dream on if he loved the cat (which had appeared in the cell), and he admitted that he did. Tommy proceeded to murder said cat, despite Dream's attempt to block his punches with his body, and commented that this was what happened to everything he loved. Tommy proceeded to call Dream a "sad little man" and proclaimed he didn't believe the revival book was real. Dream then insisted on asking Schlatt about the book, and proceeded to beat him to death in the cell, causing Tommy to lose his final canon life.

Dream vocalized that he could kill anyone he wanted and bring them back and told Tommy that everybody on the server are his puppets. Dream told Tommy that he had to kill him to prove to him that the book is real. He said he could study the revival process by killing Tommy repeatedly, and said that through studying it, he and Tommy could "become immortal together", a prospect Tommy was horrified by. He then went on saying he will bring back Wilbur, and that Wilbur will help him escape. Days later, when Tommy got out, Dream seemed to be a bit upset that Tommy was going free.

However, he folded and agreed to write the note following more torture from Quackity. In exchange, Quackity promised not to torture Dream for the following week. When Techno visited Dream on June 6, Dream shouted for him to turn around, saying that it was a trap and that Sam and Quackity were working together. As Sam trapped Techno in the same cell, Dream was despondent, citing that Techno was his only way out of the prison. Techno, however, asserted that things would be fine, and said that, unlike Dream, he had options: he had friends and attachments that he didn't cast aside. Techno asked Dream for all of the information he had on the prison, and Dream started writing his knowledge down for his new roommate. In the more recent streams, he and Technoblade have seemingly become closer and get along well; Quackity, however, tried to use this against Dream. Technoblade told Dream never to reveal any information to Quackity. Before Dream could break and divulge their plans, Technoblade disappeared, and Quackity left the cell in an attempt to search for Techno with Sam. During this time, Dream hid in the tunnel that he dug under the toilet/sink hole of the cell, tricking Quackity into believing he too had escaped the prison and thus sending Quackity into a paranoid trip.

   put in a new alarm system outside Dream's cell, so that if only a block was broken, the alarm will instantly go off and the guards will be summoned immedietly. This is to prevent any escape attempts. On November 28, 2021,
   Technoblade
   swam through the lava pool with fire res, reaching Dream's cell. Dream was surprised, and told Technoblade about the new alarm system. Technoblade then put down a piece of TNT, and ignited it. This blow up some of the redstone, but sets off the alarm anyways. Technoblade put down a ender chest and gave all the gear to Dream, along with some ender pearls and golden apples. Then, they both swam through the lava pool with fire res. Unfortunately, they ran into Awesamdude and

   , who was at the same time running towards the cell to see what happened. They ender pearled through the lava tunnel, and put up a short fight that ended up with Awesamdude being killed and BadBoyHalo brutally murdered several times. Sam (Awesamdude) then ran back to the Guard's prison room, probably to plan out their next move. Meanwhile, Technoblade uses milk and TNT to break in one of the cells, which surpisingly contains
   Connor
   in it. Apparently he was in prison for "stolen valor" because of a fake military id card at Chick-Fill-A. Technoblade then brings Conner with them and also break

   out, which is the reason why he also came in the prison. However, Dream doesn't care about him, and has several times suggested Technoblade to just get out of here before any more guards reached them. Then, they got back out of the prison using the tunnel that Technoblade dug earlier on.

  <p key="192f6928-ce15-4ede-9fe9-2a7a97f6ff2c">
   When they got out, however, they were instantly attacked by most of the SMP's members. They have heard the alarm sound and Sam has warned them that Dream has escaped, so they came near the prison to investigate. While Dream was fighting most of the SMP's members, Sam threathens Technoblade that if he doesn't tell Dream to return to the prison, he will took Ranboo's last canon life from him. Technoblade didn't know what to do, and while Dream pearls away, Ranboo was killed by Sam. Meanwhile,
   Niki
   spawns some withers in to distract players, and Technoblade, while fighting Sam, decided to make a run for it with Niki, Philza, and Dream. They returned to Philza and Technoblade's house, and they say their last goodbyes to Dream, finally free at last.

      Awesamdude used to have a positive relationship with Dream, as Sam and Dream's factions were allies and Sam constructed the prison Pandora's Vault after being recruited by Dream. However, during the Disc Confrontation, Sam and the others went to fight Dream in his vault, and Sam was the one that escorted Dream to prison when he was powerless.
      <p key="fee719e0-f336-4299-84dc-5f348ac59b1d">
       Following Dream's imprisonment, their relationship has grown negative. Dream, being lonely in the prison, constantly acts out to get Sam's attention and to make him be his friend again. In contrast, Sam has expressed disgust for Dream's actions, especially those towards Tommy during exile, and has stated that the reason Dream is locked up in the prison is his own fault. Sam has also expressed annoyance at Dream's antics, calling him swimming in the lava as him "wanting attention" and giving him less food when Dream burns his clock to get Sam to visit him. He even nearly stopped giving Dream replacement clocks, but was convinced to give him more clocks by Bad.
      </p>
      <p key="5e9ddb5b-b138-4ce4-85e5-04500b7e63aa">
       Sam was horrified by Dream's killing of Tommy and avoided bringing him food for several days because of it. He was also willing to let Quackity go into the prison with weapons to torture Dream for information on the Book of Necromancy and did not listen when Dream called out for him to stop it but Sam did not listen to Dream.
      </p>
      <p key="c8605721-7a4c-4c79-a327-568f9dd7c37f">
       After Technoblade's escape, Dream begged Sam to not tell Quackity he was still in the prison, knowing that Quackity would not hesitate to kill him on the spot. Dream negotiated with Sam saying that his job was to "keep me alive in the prison". Sam was then asking why Dream wouldn't give Quackity the revive book with Dream replying with the fact that Quackity would just kill him. Sam then agrees to not tell Quackity that he is still in the prison, and Dream then asks to be granted more freedom and maybe be able to go to the courtyard. Sam replies saying that it is a security flaw and how Dream wanted the prison to be much worse than it was originally going to be. Dream acknowledges this and tells Sam that he didn't know he was going to end up in there. The conversation ends with Sam saying "you're lucky I'm not telling Quackity you're here!". After all the negotiations with Sam, their relationship could possibly start to become positive again.
      </p>
      <p key="3002f61e-4728-44eb-8867-197e7f02f00f">
       After Dream broke out of prison, it can be assumed he wants revenge on Sam and that their relationship will never be positive.

      Prior to the events of the Disc Confrontation, BadBoyHalo had a positive relationship with Dream since the Badlands and Dream SMP had teamed up a lot previously, and Bad even helped Dream build Pandora's Vault. BadBoyHalo and several other members of the Dream SMP entered Dream's vault to rescue Tommy and Tubbo. There, Bad found that Dream had tried to capture Skeppy to have control over Bad, and Bad was one of the many that aided Tommy and Tubbo in the capturing of Dream. However, after visiting Dream in prison, Bad couldn't help but take pity on him and notice the awful living conditions that he's been living in. He has told Dream that he will try to provide comfortability for him once he officially becomes a prison guard, though he still adamantly believes that Dream deserves to remain in Pandora's Vault
      <p key="7e53004d-8e46-4ac6-be33-bc77663eff2c">
       Despite this, he later became a prison guard and did not act on his suspicions that Sam and an unknown outsider (Quackity) were torturing Dream. This suspicion would generate some degree of sympathy for Dream from Bad however, later causing Bad to hold back and only try to prevent Dream's escape from prison halfheartedly. Bad feels regretful about having not done as much as he potentially could have to stop Dream's escape, but also stated some hope that Dream may not hold his having worked as a guard against him on account of his having smuggled contraband treats in for him with his meals while he was working in that capacity. Bad still views Dream as a threat to the server, despite his concerns for Dream's wellbeing, and their relationship presumably remains generally negative.

      Dream does not have much of an opinion on Eret. He considers them a pawn, dethroning and re-throning them whenever he pleases. The relationship grew very tense after Eret supported Pogtopia, but became neutral again after Eret was re-throned. Dream seems to respect Eret's neutrality and individuality to an extent, saying he would have less power with Eret on the throne than with George. He also thinks Eret makes a good king for the Dream SMP.

      Eryn has been one of the only people Dream has interacted with positively since his escape from Pandora's vault. Dream briefly met with Eryn at the community house, and despite some initial hesitancy from both individuals, the two ultimately began trading, with Eryn initiating and first offering golden apples and then potions (both of which Dream already had in great supply). Eryn finally offered harming arrows, which Dream accepted, trading Eryn a totem of undying in exchange. Eryn received the totem excitedly, and later commented that Dream seemed cool, and he couldn't see how anyone could not like him. Eryn continues to question the demonization of Dream on the server, and currently seems to view him slightly positively.

      Dream and George are usually on good terms. They originally started the server together and stuck together for most of their adventures. They fought and stood beside each other during the Early Dream SMP arc and throughout the L'Manberg Independence War. But as time flew by, they seemed to get more distant. Dream did show some hint of caring for George by threatening to exile Tommy because he brunt down George's mushroom house, but it is hinted that that was just another reason to exile Tommy. However, Dream spontaneously dethroned George after he no longer remained neutral as Dream had instructed. George, along with Sapnap and Quackity, tried to regain kingship with a political protest against Dream's wishes. Later, their conflict was resolved with a deal, and George remained dethroned. However, this time, they left on seemingly neutral-negative terms. Dream expressed to

Her involvement was mentioned in front of Dream, so it's possible this was appreciated.

      After Tommy betrayed Technoblade and rejoined L'Manberg, Technoblade and Philza joined forces with Dream to declare war on L'Manberg. Philza saw this cooperation with Dream as a necessary evil and a means to an end. In the aftermath of L'Manberg's destruction, he had stated that he views this cooperation with Dream as 'just business.'

       When chasing Tommy, Dream seemed to have quit chasing him after Tommy approached Philza. Phil explains that he has no care for Dream and that he helped in the prison break only because he was helping his friend Techno. He also expressed anger for him not only tormenting Tommy but it being the first thing he did once he got out and he said he would "Kill that fucking green teletubby" if he saw him again so he very clearly isn't on good terms with Dream. He also helped Tommy protect himself from him. Dream apparently found out about Tommy going to him for help, and placed a sign claiming to have kidnapped Phil right after Tommy went to see him. This was found out to be a lie to scare Tommy as Phil was in the new world, but it shows their relationship has soured.

      Dream seemed to take a liking to Puffy immediately, following her around for no apparent reason, even without armor, which is rare as Dream is a very cautious person. Due to this, Puffy called him her "little duckling." However, Puffy was one of Dream's main apprehenders during the Disc Confrontation, meaning whatever bond he had is likely completely broken.

After Technoblade's escape, Dream begged Sam to not tell Quackity he was still in the prison, knowing that Quackity would not hesitate to kill him on the spot. The simple act of Sam considering telling Quackity sent Dream flying into a desperate panic.

      Tommy and Dream had arguably the longest and worst rivalry on the server. They got into a lot of conflicts, and most notably were embroiled in
      The Disc Saga
      . They fought on opposite sides as leaders of armies during the
      Dream Team SMP vs. L'Manberg War
      Dream, at first, supported Tommy during the
      Manberg Rebellion
      , fighting for him during the
      War of the Burning Eiffel Tower
      and the

       Battle of the Lake
      </a>
      . However, after getting the revival book from Schlatt, he switched sides, supporting Manberg. He additionally played a huge part in the destruction of L'Manberg, by giving Wilbur TNT, making a deal with him to blow up L'Manberg and attacking L'Manberg along with "Team Chaos" after Tubbo became President.
      <p key="73fdb896-fa28-4567-b4f1-5e9c9774a4e5">
       Their relations soured once again when Dream demanded Tommy's exile and removal from office after he griefed George's house. After it was decided that Tommy would only receive probation as punishment, Tommy attempted to blackmail Dream with Spirit, which backfired and angered Dream. After this, he demanded Tommy be exiled from L'Manberg. Dream made a dirt hut for Tommy several thousand blocks away from the main server, prohibited him from visiting L'Manberg and forced him to destroy all of his items. He visited Tommy to make sure he wasn't planning anything, and exploded all of his items every day. He also made sure no one would visit him, by keeping the invites to a party Tommy had started at his exile home.  However, not long after, Dream found out Tommy was hiding chests full of items he hid so Dream couldn't explode them for pleasure. Dream was very angry at this and out of anger, he blew up Logstedshire and prevented anyone from visiting him until he "learned his lesson." An hour later, he returned to Logstedshire to check on Tommy and discovered that he was missing from the area.

      <p key="362d4b3f-cc59-40e8-aba2-3822a572f6ba">
       After Dream blew up L'Manberg, Tommy confronted him on the obsidian grid, where Dream said that while L'Manberg's story was over, the story between them was not. Dream said that Tommy was 'fun', most likely meaning that they would continue fighting.

       Tommy was planning to leave and visit Dream for the final time to have closure. Tommy entered the prison and refused to agree to visit Dream again, but due to a security threat, Tommy ended up trapped in the prison with Dream. Sam visited him after 8 days and refused to let him out of the prison as the security issue hadn't been resolved. Dream and Tommy got into an argument, and Dream ended up killing Tommy, taking his final canon life. Dream then resurrected Tommy and asked him about the
       Afterlife
       and who was there. Tommy, still surprised and just came to his senses told Dream about the afterlife. Tommy told Dream to never punch him ever again, as it reminded him of how Dream took his final life. Tommy then told Dream to never revive Wilbur and to swear on it. Dream swore that he would use the revival knowledge however he wanted. When Sam rescued Tommy out of his cell, Dream was bitter, perhaps due to him not being able to speak with anyone anymore.

       When Dream broke out of prison on November 28th 2021, he met Tommy in Logstedshire and chased him until Tommy went into Phil's house. This furthers that they despise each other.

He pushed for Tommy to have a severe punishment, suggesting exile from the beginning. Tubbo was hesitant, and tried to find a less severe punishment. This failed when Tommy tried to blackmail Dream after a meeting to discuss his probation. Tubbo was forced to exile Tommy, making Dream very happy. Dream's relationship with Tubbo worsened during the Disc Confrontation when he threatened to kill Tubbo and take his final canon life.

      Wilbur Soot and Dream's relationship had a rocky start, as they were the commanders of the opposing nations in the

After talking to a revived Tommy, Dream said that he was thinking about reviving Wilbur, leaving it up in the air to torment Tommy, because of the knowledge he might have gained in the afterlife. He also described Wilbur while he was alive as "awesome." Dream's threat to revive Wilbur was not empty-handed; he went through with it on April 29, 2021.

The Badlands have not revealed their true intentions to Dream about their plan to take over the entire server, so Dream still believes that they are a trustworthy faction. However, the members of The Badlands confronted him during the Disc Confrontation, and are now responsible for keeping him inside of the vault, so their relationship is presumably negative.
