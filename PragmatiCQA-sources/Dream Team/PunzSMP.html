    When asked about headcanoning his character as trans or non-binary, Punz stated his character does not have a canon gender.
    Additionally, he has referred to his character with both he/him and they/them pronouns.
    This page defers to using he/him for consistency's sake, as he is most commonly referred to with this set of pronouns.

   After Punz was influenced by the Crimson, his chain became a blood vine chain (though the medallion stays the same) and his eyes became red. Recently, Punz's corrupted apperance has changed from his winter version to his casual version. The black stripes on his jacket have now changed to a blood vine red and the medallion on his chain is no longer a normal gold color. His jacket and the tear marks on his jeans appear to be tinted grey.

   Punz's personality has evolved with time, like all others on the SMP. In the beginning, he rarely involved himself with conflicts. Occasionally, he would help people; like giving Tubbo a bee, and helping Tommy. However, this shifted once the major conflicts began. During the First L'Manberg War, he joined Dream's side along with Sapnap and George.  His motives shifted, and even though he continued to help people on the server, he could be easily bought off with money during conflicts. Punz remained neutral in most conflicts, but still enjoyed a good fight. As he rarely got into conflict, he began collecting riches and became one of the richest people on the server with one of the largest bases and a shulker box, courtesy of

For Punz's homework assignment, he drew two stickmen: a larger one labeled "Punz" and a shorter one labeled "KSI." When KSI questioned his assignment, Punz joked about KSI's height, leading to KSI asking Dream to turn him into a chicken as a punishment. As a chicken, George bred Punz with the "teacher's pet" as his class project, resulting in Punz having a chickling. The chick was later killed by KSI, and Punz failed to graduate.

   After Dream announced he would destroy L'Manberg alongside Technoblade, Punz declared that Dream had gone too far and sided with L'Manberg for the upcoming battle. However, this was a ploy to gain L'Manberg's trust, as he and Dream had plotted to install Punz as a spy within L'Manberg prior to the conflict. Punz assisted the people of L'Manberg in fighting off the Hound Army and withers spawned by Philza and Technoblade. Later, when speaking with Tubbo at

   , Tommy remarked how surprising it was to see Punz fighting on their side for once rather than on Dream's. The information Punz had obtained has been "useful." L'Manberg had been destroyed, so it is rather apparent that Punz wouldn't be fighting for L'Manberg or those who were part of L'Manberg's doomsday defense force. However, Punz has obtained information on the people's separate ways, which would allow Dream to start a campaign after his hiding to kill those who have "wronged" him.

Bad then pitched his plan to the three ‚Äì as the Egg was going to breach containment anyways, they would let it spread around the server, and take advantage of the ensuing chaos to gain power.

   The day before the Disc Confrontation, Punz wanted to replace the Punzo Blade of Justice, which was destroyed by a wither blast on Doomsday. He found a sign Tommy left outside his base, asking him to check the seventh floor of his tower, where Tommy left a chest with gold, TNT, diamonds, and netherite ingots. In the room, Tommy left signs describing his distrust of Punz and asking if the payment was enough for his loyalty. Punz was torn on whether to help Tommy, musing to himself that the payment was "more than Dream had ever given" him and reflecting that Dream might be going insane. He also questioned himself as a mercenary, wondering why he felt so conflicted. He then seemed to put aside his thoughts and returned to make a new sword.

   On the day of the conflict, while Sam and others lined up along the Prime Path to say their goodbyes to Tommy and Tubbo, Punz was nowhere to be found. However, as Tommy and Tubbo wished each other goodbye in the Disc Vault, Punz came through the portal, stating that Dream should have paid him more, and led other members of the SMP to Tommy and Tubbo's aid. After the confrontation and Dream's imprisonment in Pandora's Vault, Tommy thanked Punz for coming to help. Tommy later admitted to Tubbo in private that he hadn't thought Punz would actually come, to which Tubbo concurred, saying that he thought Punz hated them.

   Bad held a meeting with Antfrost, Captian Puffy, and Punz at a roundtable that he created. The Egg was getting too hard to contain, so Bad suggests to let the vines spread and chaos be created. He reasons that it would benefit the Badlands, who needed chaos to rise up in power. After the Badlands getting a lot of power, Bad promises to find a way to destroy the Egg as soon as the Badlands have power. Bad invites Punz and Puffy to join the Badlands, Punz agrees and suggests the name Eggpire for the group. After breaking the obsideon that surrounds the Egg, his blue eyes turned red and states he loves the power that the Egg brought.

Antfrost understood his anger and wanted to make amends by planning to gift him a new panda. In the end, the two made amends. When Punz discovers the Egg in Bad's underground cavern, he was distasted and concerned, causing Ant to question him. Despite Punz removing several blood vines he spotted around the SMP, the two didn't seem to hold any grudges against each other, and Punz, although weirded out by Ant's antics towards the mysterious red substances, seemed to be ultimately worried for his well being. After Punz joined the Eggpire and became corrupted by the Egg, Ant is more trusting towards Punz and work together to spread the Blood Vine.

They did fight in the Second Pet War however, with Bad going as far as trying to downplay Antfrost‚Äôs actions and manipulating Punz into thinking he was in the wrong. They didn‚Äôt seem to hold anything against each other post war though. When Punz discovered the blood vines in Bad's underground cavern, he expressed discomfort and concern, causing Bad to try converting him into thinking that it was a good thing. However, this action proved to be useless as Punz didn't change his mind. Despite the dispute of Punz removing the blood vines he sees around the SMP, there doesn't seem to be any bad blood between them, and Punz even expressed some concern over Bad's obsession over the vines. After Punz joined the Eggpire and became corrupted by the Egg, Bad is very pleased Punz succumbed to the corruption and work together to spread the Blood Vine.

      . Their relationship has been compared to that of a younger and older brother, and though Punz has been on the receiving end of many of Sapnap's antics, they rarely hold grudges against each other, Punz forgiving Sapnap for burning down his house and accidentally killing his fox. Punz has helped Sapnap with the construction of builds such as Sapnap's secret base and the Eiffel Tower. Though they have a good relationship, their factions are currently at odds; Punz is responsible for being Dream's spy and second in command, while Sapnap became a member of El Rapids following his falling out with Dream and the Greater Dream SMP. This puts them into occasional conflict, with Punz being ready to fight Sapnap if Dream commands it. They have fought against each other during the Greater Dream SMP Civil War and during the Battle of the Lake. However, during the Doomsday War, the two fought alongside each other on L'Manberg's side (although Punz was acting as Dream's spy at the time), killing a wither together, to Sapnap's delight.

      Tommy and Punz have a neutral relationship. Back in the Disc Saga, Punz was friendly to Tommy, giving Tommy a blaze rod, and trying to help him break the obsidian after Dream trapped his bed. However, they've never really had a positive relationship despite the small friendly gestures of Punz. Tommy attempted to trap his house and jokingly said he was one of his enemies for having a 'z' in his name. In return, Punz just kept ending his sentences with a 'z' to annoy him. Tommy also expressed his disliking for Punz always intervening as manpower on the side of Manberg. Before the Disc Confrontation, Tommy paid Punz gold, TNT, diamonds, and netherite ingots in the hopes that Punz would help him and Tubbo in their confrontation with Dream. To Tommy's surprise, Punz came to their aid in the Disc Vault, and they seemed to be on better terms.

       After Punz succumbed to the Egg's corruption, he came to dislike Tommy and even went as far as to be pleased by the news of Tommy's death, as Tommy had been (and presumably still is) in the way of the Egg's objective.

Though they don‚Äôt interact much nowadays, Tubbo speaks  highly of Punz. He has said that he was "a cool guy" and still respects him, even calling Punz ‚Äúa gentleman.‚Äù Before his position in
