      Fundy takes all of the remaining pieces of debris, but gets spotted by Ranboo. Ranboo allows Fundy to continue, and Fundy replaces the sign originally on the debris wall with badly spelled text and places it on a floating wooden plank.

      Fundy then finds a spider in the minecart of Tubbo's failed ravager teleporter platform, and gets a sticky piston from Ranboo to use to "shake" the spider. After the spider dies, Fundy finds a baby drowned at Party Island, which he names Baby Man, and tries to get it into the minecart, but it dies to sunlight. Later on, he and Ranboo manage to trap another spider and also "shake" it with the piston. They then move the spider to the railway around Party Island, where Fundy adds a spider web tunnel.

      Fundy changes the signs at Ranboo's trident mini-game, but after a failed sign replacement, he then panics and returns the rest of the debris and tries out the trident parkour course. However, instead of attempting the course, he logs off and scams Ranboo of his trident. When Fundy logs back on, he nearly dies to a suffocation trap that Ranboo had set up. After several attempts at the course, Fundy dies on the third level, winding up at his XP farm. He then dies again to get back to spawn and runs back to get his stuff.

     <li key="f341be8a-b6a1-4ea5-b3f9-4c595873cf58">
      Fundy and Ranboo then decide to make a "cinnamon bun" and they collect sand and clay to make yellow terracotta, along with some snow from their ice cream shop and the ancient debris. They display the cinnamon bun, made of debris, in the same location as the debris wall. It has a terracotta base and is "frosted" with snow.

      Fundy repairs the leaves of the L'Mantree, and Punz presses the button on the tree. He gets somehow frozen in time, and Fundy decides to press the button on the tree as well, blinding him in a pitch black void. Ranboo presses the button as well, and gets the same results. Ranboo places down a lever that brings them back from the void, and Fundy places a sign warning others not to touch the button on the tree.

      Fundy vandalizes one of the Techno propaganda posters at L'Manberg, changing the tagline to “YOU want COCK to join the revolution”. Techno logs on, making the two panic and hide in Tommy's L'Manberg house. Fundy then tries out Ranboo's trident parkour course again and manages to complete it. Fundy then starts to add trivia questions in floating containers at the end of the mini-game.

    Tommy and Techno plot to commit "minor terrorism" within L'Manberg. Tommy takes some wither skulls from Techno's secret lair, accidentally causing an achievement completion and concerning those also live on the server. He then tries to distract them with other messages. Techno and Tommy arrive into L'Manberg, and Techno turns one of his propaganda posters the right way around, before spotting Fundy and Ranboo.

      The four go to the L'Manberg multipurpose podium and stage. Tommy and Techno threaten Ranboo and Fundy with a wither and force them to either fight it themselves or return Techno's weapons and have his assistance fighting it. Before Ranboo and Fundy have a chance to decide, Techno spawns it, causing chaos across the city. Punz joins to help whilst Ranboo gives back Techno's sword and axe. The wither causes great structural damage to L'Manberg before being killed by Punz, and Fundy claims the nether star.

      Tommy and Techno then interrogate Fundy for his nether star and the location of Tommy's discs, whilst Ranboo and Vikk watch on. After much resistance, Fundy hands over the nether star, but Tommy continues to interrogate him about the discs. Fundy reveals that a festival is taking place within L'Manberg tomorrow, and that it's likely that the owners of the discs will show up there. After that, he drowns himself in the river under Ponk's dunk tank and dies a non-canonical death. The pair then leave, satisfied with the information given.

      Techno and Tommy walk over to the Community House, where Tommy considers blowing it up to get back at Dream. Techno admits to Tommy that, while he initially considered Tommy to be useless, his actions today proved that Techno could see him as a friend. He reveals his plan to blow up L'Manberg, with Tommy hesitant about the plan. Techno offers Tommy the option to join him or not, but says that L'Manberg will be destroyed either way. Tommy continues by his side for now, but only to get back his discs.

      The two then go to the sewers to breed more dogs for the Hound Army, but they retreat to Techno's cabin after sensing someone digging above them. Techno uses the nether star he collected to make a beacon, and places it on top of a mountain, which Tommy names "Mount Beak On".

They reconvene in the Camarvan to discuss Techno's actions, before heading back into the town center and resetting the "Days since last War Crime" board count to 0. They then head to the apiary and find all of the bees gone, which likely occurred due to the server updating to a new version. Tubbo tries out Ranboo's trident parkour course, but fails on the third level.

      By now, the citizens taking part in the festival have now made their way over to watch. Tubbo, still in shock, asks how this is L'Manberg's fault when Dream was the one keeping an eye on Tommy's exile. Dream explains that his single disc is not enough leverage to enforce the exile. Dream asks again for the disc, explaining that he can easily gain power over Tommy if Tubbo simply handed over the disc. Dream then asks again, but Tommy, overlooking the entire ordeal, puts on armor to make himself visible, interrupting the meeting to deny the claims. Techno follows after in order to defend him. He continues by stating that Tommy wouldn't lie to him, something that Dream refutes.

      Tubbo reaches for his ender chest to hand over the disc, but Tommy stops him. A fight erupts between Tommy and Tubbo as they argue about the discs and the exile. While everyone watches the fight, Techno and Fundy get into a minor scuffle. The fight ultimately ends when Tommy lashes out, proclaiming that the discs were worth more than Tubbo ever was, and they both have a moment of pause.

      Tommy apologizes to Tubbo and instructs him to give the Mellohi disc to Dream, and Tubbo ultimately complies. Tommy professes that the person he became was not who he wanted to be. Techno offers to escape with Tommy so that they can regroup, but Tommy refuses. Instead, Tommy joins Tubbo's side, betraying Techno. Tommy and Techno argue, with Tommy trying to explain himself and Techno audibly disappointed and betrayed by the actions.

      With Dream's and Techno's goals aligning, Dream asks Techno if he has any withers. They create an alliance to destroy L'Manberg at 3:00 EST on January 6, giving the rest of the people time to say their goodbyes. Dream maintains that he is not using the favor for them to team up, explaining that Techno's main goal was to destroy L'Manberg anyway.

      Techno requests his axe back from Tommy, claiming that he is no longer worthy. Tommy refuses to give it back, trying to convince Techno that he shouldn't side with Dream. Despite his words, Techno expresses that he made it very transparent that his goals were always to destroy L'Manberg and lists his reasoning (the betrayals, the executions, etc.) Techno tells Tommy that he made a decision that cannot be undone, but he respects him for it since anarchy is about freedom. He tells him that he hopes he doesn't regret it, and leaves before a fight breaks out.

Niki then challenges Tommy's history, accusing him of lying about destroying the Community House. Tommy defends himself, swearing on Church Prime that he was not responsible for the griefing.
