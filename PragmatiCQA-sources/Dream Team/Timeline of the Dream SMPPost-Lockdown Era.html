      In the distance in the other direction, Fundy sees another house, and walks towards it. Opening the door, it leads to a cave that he explores. In one of the corners, he finds a prison-like cell covered with chains and a skeleton head on the floor. Nearby is a table with a chest incorporated.
     </li>
     <li key="d371a276-eb03-4bf3-95c7-661effdbea83">
      Upon opening the chest, Fundy finds a book inside. Fundy picks up the book, and finds an eighty-seven page letter to himself, explaining who Fundy is. It goes on to warn Fundy of the desert he was placed in, and warning that it is not real. The book also repeats the line that he himself is not real. Upon further reading, he finds that the book spells out a sentence by adding a letter on each page as he flicked through. The letters spell "wake up," and Fundy starts hearing a heartbeat that gradually gets louder.

     <li key="e6f67842-3bcb-44ae-9c8f-d382ea526b81">
      Fundy finds himself back in his bed within his base. Confused and unsure of what happened, he walks to the door to find himself still in the desert. Fundy walks out into the desert, and finds the drug van again. However, only his name tag appears. Fundy think's he's being pranked, and tries opening the door to the drug van again. Like last time, the door does not open.
     </li>
     <li key="7db87208-041a-4fa4-83a6-3fc1d522379f">
      Fundy finds the cave again, and looks closer than before. He heads down, and finds several pieces of carpet missing off the table and the skeleton head now sitting on a shelf behind the table. The chest is still in its original location, and Fundy opens it to find a book placed inside it, again with eighty-seven pages.
     </li>
     <li key="c36dd986-685a-42a1-b29d-867e635f99d8">
      The book again appears to have been written by Fundy, but this time welcomes him back. It is unsure whether this is the second or third time Fundy's been there. The book then mentions two things he can do: either head back to his base and fall asleep again, or continue to read on and read he knows.
     </li>
     <li key="4370ce6b-0e91-4fc6-b5ea-98a946a876cb">
      Fundy chooses the latter, and continues. The book repeats the line "you are not real" once on several pages before repeating the line "you don't want to know the truth" once on several pages. It follows on, repeating "WAKE UP" all across the page and on several pages after that. The heartbeat returns, and Fundy wakes up in his bed at his base.
     </li>
     <li key="de28d28e-3039-4327-a34d-8303dcc7ff8f">
      Fundy, now sounding emotionally distraught, heads to the door to find himself still in the desert. He starts convincing himself that it is real, and that this is all just a joke. Opening the other door, he finds the cave is closer to the base and drug van missing.
     </li>
     <li key="802f3be3-515b-4c3b-8d23-71042e23b98e">
      He heads to the roof, and repeats to himself the option the book gave him of waiting until night time and going back to sleep, continuously repeating to himself that none of this is real and still thinking this is a prank being played on him. A bench also appears on the top of the base.
     </li>
     <li key="ac0948ac-53b4-4e01-8e44-348973ce9c82">
      Having tried and failed to go back to sleep, Fundy heads past the cave to where the drug van was. He finds that the van had been blown up. Scared, he decides he wants to find out what's going on, and heads back to the cave. This time, the entire table except three slabs had gone, and two skeleton heads sitting behind it. The chest is still there, and inside it is another eighty-seven page book and another letter from himself.
     </li>
     <li key="f7c30666-9178-4129-8581-e05a5912050a">
      The book asks why Fundy is so persistent and stubborn for always coming back. Again, it mentions that Fundy shouldn't want to know the truth, but this time explaining that it will hurt him. It also says that the Fundy writing the book doesn't want to be hurt again, and neither does the Fundy reading the book.
     </li>
     <li key="b213dafd-453c-4382-b30b-f054d9c9f19c">
      The book continues by saying it knows what Fundy wants, but begs that he leaves, goes to sleep, and enjoys his life. After another few blank pages, it repeats "WAKE UP" over several pages. The heartbeat returns, but this time, the heartbeat stops as the pages stop repeating "wake up." Instead, the book shows two blank pages before another page with the content "it's not going to work, huh.."
     </li>
     <li key="35d057b3-0029-44af-9d6a-c78ee582e1e8">
      The book carries on, explaining that Fundy's mind isn't safe and that he isn't imagining this. The next page contains "This place might not be real." A blank page follows, then a page with the text "But he is." Confused as to "he" is, Fundy keeps reading as the book asks him to "spare yourself." The book then asks Fundy to listen carefully.
     </li>
     <li key="4a83395a-0b2d-4447-b74e-5191f68744e2">
      "Do not join him. Whatever he asks of you. Do NOT join him" the book read. "his plans aren't as nice as they sound. his intentions aren't what you think they are. He will use you. he will destroy you. everything you ever loved, everyone you ever cared about. do not join him." Still unsure as to "he" is, Fundy also questions why it wasn't a signed book. He does not believe he would write something like this.
     </li>
     <li key="8410957f-779b-480f-a877-650a5e4f744a">
      Fundy turns around towards the entrance of the cave, and finds a signed book on the floor, different from the one he found in the chest. He picks it up, finding it entitled with the current date and signed by Fundy. The book is twenty-two pages long, and starts as a note to self: "hello. I just wrote this book to remember who i am. To remember what is happening. All the books i just found are indeed written by me. Listen to yourself. You suffer from a very odd illness. You suffer from a form of insomnia, within your own dreams. Now the effects of this aren't really known, and even I don't fully know what is going on." The book also states that his actions in his "dreams" are linked to reality, and they could actually happen, meaning that he can predict the future. In addition, the book states that there is a drawback to it.
     </li>
     <li key="cec459b9-bb09-4950-be13-2be5a4793e39">
      Fundy stops reading, and when he emerges from the cave, he finds it nighttime. He heads back to his base to sleep, and throws the book away. However, as he throws the book, he decides to pick it back up and keep it. As he continues to talk himself that he can sleep and return to normal life, he throws the book away again. Nonetheless, he picks the book back up and rereads the second half of where these "dreams" leak into reality, and continues where he left of in the cave: "however... whilst this might be the case for dreams... this also is the case for nightmares... this is your last warning Fundy. Please...for the both of us... just wake up."
     </li>
     <li key="82d4e5bb-e866-4c13-a0d7-b36e1b9a9bfb">
      Fundy wakes up again, still in his base in the desert, and starts thinking he is stuck forever in his "dreams." He looks outside to find himself still in the desert at night. A cloaked figure dressed in black stands at the bottom of the entrance stairs with their back facking him. The figure then slowly turns to face him, and chases him up to the top of his base with the heartbeat sound returning.
     </li>
     <li key="6262556d-1a6f-469a-9d17-395d46ba2bad">
      Fundy finds a bed at the top of the base, and gets into it. The screen goes abruptly black, and a face resembling Quackity's appears on the screen with sounds of poker chips falling and other casino sounds.
