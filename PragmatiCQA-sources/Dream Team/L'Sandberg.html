   new sister countries
   as well. Eventually, Foolish allowed L'Sandberg to be a separate country in his property. However, they built a large wall/toll gate on his land violating the agreement between them and Foolish, leading to Foolish giving them 4 days to take down the wall until he declared war.

He wrote a response to Foolish's last letter in the L'Sandberg mailbox affirming a declaration of war, placing it in the mailbox to frame BadBoyHalo and start a war. He accidentally signed the book, but said that Foolish wouldn't be able to tell.

   He thought it was a joke as he felt being a tyrannical dictator was not in Bad's nature. Nevertheless, he went to Foolish's summer home to check if this was a genuine issue he might have to bring up with

   . On reaching L'Sandberg however, he did not see any signs of a government. He was confused about whether Foolish was talking about the toll gate, since it was easy to go around it. He made a small route around the wall and then left, figuring that if it was important enough, Foolish would send him another letter.

   On May 15, Foolish gathered obsidian and started making a large obsidian wall surrounding L'Sandberg.
   He placed a sign on the wall, telling L'Sandberg residents to pay a toll of 50 diamonds. He filled in the "shortcut" and planned out possible defenses like a TNT cannon, a sand trap, a cobweb trap and placing cacti in L'Sandberg. He fended off mass accusations from his chat of following in Dream's footsteps, saying that there were very few parallels. He blamed L'Sandberg for claiming land right on his house, taxing him for his own property, and telling him to die. He called for L'Sandberg to remove the walls, give him their tower and leave his property.

Tubbo invited Foolish into L'Sandberg for a cabinet meeting, and said that he would remove the toll if Foolish took down the obsidian wall, but Foolish refused. Tubbo called L'Sandberg 'Tubbo SMP' and declared war on Foolish. He offered Foolish two $50 gift cards and then threatened to declare independence. Foolish finally agreed to take down the wall, scoring a major victory for the Tubbo Administration.

He said to Puffy that Foolish had given L'Sandberg more enforced walls for toll entrances but later started removing it, saying that he would expand L'Sandberg and sell it to Foolish. They then had an argument, with Puffy telling Bad to leave Foolish alone as they had already killed him during the

   Sam seemed to like L'Sandberg, saying that it was a nice touch to the summer house. When Foolish protested that L'Sandberg was taxing him on his own land, Sam argued that Foolish building an obsidian wall around L'Sandberg proved that it was separate land from Foolish's house. Bad said that he would sell L'Sandberg. After some bickering on the price between Sam and Foolish, Bad asked each of them what they would do with the L'Sandberg wall. Foolish wanted to tear it down, while Sam wanted to make income from it. Bad accepted Sam's deal and Sam said that he would make L'Sandberg much bigger. Foolish wanted to purchase the tollgate and the tower with ten diamond blocks, but Bad said that the tower could be negotiated to be sold at a later time. Sam then withdrew his previous offer and decided to act as a neutral third party/mediator for the sale.

   Bad admitted that he was in the wrong for violating the agreement and expanding on Foolish's territory and apologized.

Foolish questioned what he would do if someone else did the same thing that Bad did on his land again, and Bad replied that he would help Foolish fight them off. Bad said that the tower would be his embassy to Foolish's house. Thus, the conflict ended peacefully and Bad and Foolish started mending their friendship again.

Foolish tried to explain that this was a backup plan that Skeppy agreed to, and it was in case something at L'Sandberg had gone wrong. He also said that Skeppy had told him that he was tired of living with Bad and wanted a break. Bad thought that Foolish forced Skeppy to say that and declared war on him until Skeppy was returned safely. Foolish said that he didn't know where Skeppy was. Skeppy had chosen the location and Foolish had given him a pager to contact him if necessary. He also reminded Bad that he had kidnapped Finley. Skeppy sent Bad another message, saying that he was cold and hungry. He went to search for Skeppy, and Bad and Foolish agreed to still try to be on good terms with each other. Bad started searching in the Greater Dream SMP, but to no avail.

   Ponk destroyed a large portion of L'Llamaberg for being directly in front of the Supreme fridge. Bad tried to calm Puffy down to not escalate the conflict, but Puffy refused. They also discovered that Ponk had stolen Shelly. Frustrated with Ponk's previous griefings against her, she took down the Supreme fridge with Bad's very reluctant help. They wrote a letter to Ponk about the bad things Ponk had done to them, including kidnapping Shelly, and asked for the location of Shelly and for Ponk to negotiate with them later.

  <p key="e4078793-b75d-402e-b364-c8979f43421e">
   Foolish found out about Bad and Puffy's actions and wrote back saying that the fridge was a gift from Ponk and that he would get revenge on them after going through the "five stages of grief". Foolish killed one of the llamas at the L'Sandberg tower and started calculating the amount of TNT needed to blow up the tower. Puffy wrote a response to Foolish's letter saying that she did not mean to upset Foolish and that she would remove the castle when Bad left the area. Ponk found out about the destruction of the fridge and said that he would sue Bad and Puffy.

   Ant apologized to Foolish about the Red Banquet and Foolish forgave him saying that he never harbored any hatred towards him. Ant also apologized to Puffy about killing Foolish, and Puffy, in turn, apologized for killing Ant. Bad apologized to both Ant and Puffy as well for the Red Banquet.

   On June 7, Ponk sent a book called 'LORE SUIT 07.06' challenging Bad and Puffy to 'a legal battle of wits and looks in a court of lore'. He wrote a mix of true and nonsensical crimes committed by Puffy ranging from theft and griefing to drinking milk with ice and flushing the toilet in the wrong way. He gave them 3 days to respond or else the list of crimes would be considered final. In response, the next day, Bad and Puffy sent a book back to Ponk called 'U IS SERVED!', accepting the challenge and accusing Ponk of an even more nonsensical list of crimes which included mentioning Supreme, being an "ipad kid", stealing Sam's heart and having a name one letter away from 'Punk'.
  </p>
  <p key="43da71a9-b79e-495d-8933-b6de94746fa7">
   Ponk read the response and considered how to counter it. He talked to Sam as well about his legal options. Sam said that
   Tubbo
   was a lawyer (Big Law), but Ponk said that he was expensive and scary to approach. They found out that
   Drista
   was a Judge in
   Kinoko Kingdom
   and thought of bringing her to decide the case and hiring Tubbo/Big Law to be Ponk's lawyer.

   On July 5, Ponk killed Shelly in retaliation for the Supreme fridge demolition.

   On July 18, Foolish returned to his summer home to collect TNT. While considering what to blow up next, he came across L'Sandberg and decided it was time for it to go. He placed a pillar of TNT through the center of the tower and ignited it with a golden pressure plate. The explosion destroyed the majority of the tower, as well as part of the path to the nether portal. Foolish fixed the path, but left the hole and the remains of L'Sandberg.

  <p key="a4243d97-fbff-41bf-85cb-59a4f0dfee7d">
   On August 15, nearly a month after the destruction of L'Sandberg, Bad confronted Foolish about a rumor he had heard that L'Sandberg had been destroyed and Foolish tried to explain it away as an earthquake. When Bad saw L'Sandberg's remains, he wanted to destroy one of Foolish's builds. In the end, he demanded a head as compensation and Foolish gave him a creeper head. Bad wanted to kill Foolish's ravager pet, but felt sad after Foolish named it and backed off. After some negotiations and a very tense trade, Foolish and Bad traded Puffy's head for Karl's head, presumably ending the conflict.
  </p>
  <p key="55df1691-16f1-4091-91cc-28c54e1d58c9">
   Foolish then showed Bad his building project in the Dream SMP. Bad immediately started building a house next to it and claimed that everything within 3 blocks of the house was his land. Foolish brushed his claims off and hinted that another 'earthquake' might possibly happen to his house again.
