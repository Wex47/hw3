   Ponk is a human with dark skin, black eyes, and blonde hair. He wears a red, yellow and black mask covering his whole face with the exception of his eyes. He also wears a black hoodie, white pants and black shoes. He sometimes wears a lab coat over his clothes, to match his doctor persona. After being trapped in an obsidian box over the crimson, Ponk briefly wore red contacts as a way to make the Eggpire think he had been corrupted. However after having his heart broken by Sam, he fully gave in to the Egg, and his natural eyes turned red. They have since returned to normal after the Eggpire disbanded. His left arm is missing, having been cut off by Sam.
   He also has bionic legs after Technoblade's massacre at the
   Manberg Festival

   Ponk is generally a friendly and kind individual, though he is also known for his occasional trickery. He is usually a neutral party in conflict, typically keeping to himself. However, after
   Schlatt
   became president, Ponk's city prospered, causing him to support Schlatt. He switched to Pogtopia’s side afterward, however, and aided Tommy. Many members of the SMP consider Ponk as an odd character, as he performs many questionable sacrifices and experiments within his city.

   After the war, Ponk decided to become a doctor. He took
   The Socializing Club
   and turned it into a weapons shop and used
   The Therapy Office
   as his office for a while. Later, he established
   Lemon City
   , a nether-themed base that cannot be burned down after his third tree was burned by
   Big Crime

   Tubbo's jungle base
   in retaliation. Ponk began to tame and sacrifice cats within the walls of the city.

   Manberg Festival
   . After the festival, Ponk became Schlatt's doctor and ended up being the only builder for Manberg, building the
   Manberg Hotel
   .  Some time later, tension grew between Ponk and Schlatt, due to
   Schlatt refusing to get treatment for his ever increasing decline in health
   . This leads to Ponk leaving Schlatt and joining Pogtopia as their doctor. When Quackity tried to get Schlatt to sign his presidency away, Ponk gifted Wilbur an invisibility arrow and bow, Wilbur later used this to save Quackity. After that Ponk guarded Tommy during his time in the SMP area, he was ready to fight to protect him, even hitting Dream a few times when he came. During the
   Manberg vs Pogtopia War

   In the Estate Conflict, Purpled made a real estate business on the prime path after realizing nobody had paid for property on the server. His first customer was Antfrost, who seemed a bit confused. While trying to evict Ant’s house, Ponk came. The two charged him 48 iron blocks for his gingerbread house. Jack Manifold then joined, and he and Ant challenged the ruling. Ant and Jack then hinted at claiming Thiccatron, leading everyone to rush towards the community portal. With the disadvantage of the faulty breakout room exit and being unknowledgeable of the server's geography, Jack was able to get to the portal first with Antfrost breaking it behind him. Purpled then tricked Jack to come back with a business proposition. When he returned, Purpled and Ponk rushed to Thiccatron. Purpled and Antfrost ended up getting to Thiccatron first, Purpled and Ant then argued over who claimed Thiccatron. Jack then came later, being outnumbered Purpled was then killed by the two, and his items were taken.

   When Ponk came back, Purpled felt more confident and challenged Ant to a 1 v 1 duel. Jack however, convinced Ponk and Purpled to fight a 2 v 2 instead. Purpled agreed. Everyone had an iron chestplate and a wooden sword. Purpled and Ponk won the first round, Antfrost used a potion, allowing him to win the second round. And the third one ended in a draw, as Ponk cheated. Later, parts of the thiccatron were set on fire by Purpled. Ant and Jack went to stop the fire. Seeing his tree on fire, Ponk yelled that it was his tree. Purpled, realizing so, began stopping the fire. He likely didn't know that Thiccatron was Ponk's but never admitted to it. He claimed that he set the tree on fire to show his power.

He had also found out about Helga from Jack, saying that she was very respected, rich and had many connections (although he again varied on how he found this information).

Ponk also said that Helga had a very strong relationship with Shrimpdick, but didn't clarify further.

Ponk also said that he read about a man named Cornelius in the diary, who was apparently very green.

   A few minutes after the scene, Ponk said that he just had the weirdest dream. He said that he might be related to Jack the potato farmer, seemingly having forgotten that he called Jack his ancestor multiple times. He also said that he learnt about the village from Helga's diary, contradicting his initial story that he read about it from Jack's diary. Ponk then spotted a house on the horizon and felt a connection to it, feeling that it was Jack's house. The house was in horrible condition, with many parts of the walls missing and the entire thing being covered in cobwebs. Ponk saw a sign next to the front door, which read, "JACK'S YE OLD FARM HOUSE". There was also a lemon tree with a sign reading "JACK'S LEMON TREE INSURED BY BANK OF COR*" and a grave with a sign reading "RIP JACK THE POTATO FARMER".

   He entered the house and explored it. He managed to find a bookshelf that turned to be a fake painting. He went behind a painting and climbed down a secret set of ladders until he reached an underground room with many villagers kept in boats in order. There were also one skeleton and two cave spider farms, each with a spawner. He also heard cats inside the walls for some reason. Ponk said that he would be rich but didn't touch the chests, fearing that there may have been someone else there recently. He also said something about a person called Karl, saying that he didn't think that that person was involved in this. He said that Shrimpy/Bob had survived as well and he may have been involved in the house. This may mean that Karl was mentioned in the diary as well, meaning that the diary would contain an actual first-hand experience of one of Karl's time-travel adventures.

   The next day, he checked out the chests in the basement and found an assortment of items, including a Cat music disc and ender pearls. He also found a book and quill in the chest from Jack, which he started reading. Jack wrote of a strange man made of straw with eyes made of emerald (a description which matches
   Foolish Gamers
   ' appearance and color scheme). The book also included something about a new land that used sand as stone and had gold everywhere (a description matching
   Foolish's summer house
   perfectly). It said that the strange man was fascinated by lemons and brought him a caravan of good and 21 'statues' in boats which were possibly the villagers. Two weeks after this encounter, Jack's writings seemed to become more and more incoherent. He wrote about cats in the walls and said that the cats murdered people. He also disliked Shrimpy's interest in his 'statues'. Then, one day, he wrote that he had a sudden urge to murder. He said that Helga was tempting but her husband needed to die, highlighting the tense relationship between Jack, Helga and Jimmy. Jack stopped writing in the journal for the next 135 days, during which most of 'The Village That Went Mad' likely took place. His last journal entry was after 'The Village That Went Mad', babbling about how only him, Shrimpy and the statues were left and that life was good.

   For Valentine's Day, Ponk planned to ask Awesamdude to be his valentine. To do this, Ponk spent several days building the "Woo Station", a minecart ride underground for Sam that was designed to be pleasant if he said "yes" and frightening if he said "no". To gather information on what Sam likes, Ponk hung out with him regularly. During one of these visits, Ponk requested a tour of

Once the Woo Station was complete, Sam rode it and agreed to be Ponk's valentine. The two then had a picnic date, with Ponk building the venue and Sam providing the food.

The three seemed to joke around with him, not taking it seriously until they saw the key card. Niki seemed interested, but the other two disagreed and soon all three wanted nothing to do with it. As Ponk tried to convince them, Sam logged on and chased him down for the key card, which he got. Ponk convinced HBomb and Foolish to distract Sam whilst he stole the remaining eleven keycards, and he succeeded in doing so until Sam tracked and chased him down - taking a canon life in the process.

   Drista
   be the judge and
   Tubbo (Big Law)
   be Ponk's lawyer, though it is currently unknown whether the law suit will be followed up on. During this time, Ponk confronted Sam about taking his life and cutting off his arm during the Keycard Incident. Sam revealed that he holds no regrets for it, and feels that Ponk brought it on himself by refusing to give Sam the keycards. Ponk responded by stating that karma would catch up to Sam eventually, and that Ponk would offer his support to Sam after it does.

   Some time later, Ponk and Foolish messed with Sam by dressing up as Robin and Batman respectively and accusing him of committing an unknown crime. The two were eventually chased off the premises by

   A few days later, Ponk found Sam standing AFK by his Bank. Ponk then pushed Sam down to the server's spider spawner and released the spiders to kill him (non-canonically) for both revenge and future leverage. Once the spiders killed Sam, Ponk sorted through his dropped items. He kept Sam's sword named "Warden's Will", as well as Sam's armor and trident.

Then, he confided in Foolish a plan to use Sam's stolen gear as well as their newfound hobby of dressing up as alter-egos to become Sherlock and Watson to "take back" Ponk's missing arm from Sam using "social engineering". Ponk requested Foolish's help to break Sam's will. Foolish agreed to help once it was confirmed that the plan did not involve killing Sam.

Foolish tried to act as if this wasn't true, before saying that it wasn't a big deal. Ponk was furious at Foolish and blew up a bridge between them to symbolize the death of their friendship. They then parted ways, with Ponk hoping that he would never have to cross paths with Foolish again. This incident would lead to Ponk cutting off all ties to the world and retreating to a cave to live as a hermit.

    "A year ago today... L'manburg... did not know it's fate. Did not know... What side of history it'd be on. But now, as we sit and reminisce, We realize, It wasn't meant to be. It never was. From the day Eret uttered those words, L'Manburg was doomed to fall. Burnt down to ashes, Nothing more but rubble, Cobblestone and dirt. This one place, This one place... Used to be great. But now, as faded into time, Faded away... Into extinction." - Ponk while touring the ruins of L'Manburg on the one year anniversary of it's destruction
