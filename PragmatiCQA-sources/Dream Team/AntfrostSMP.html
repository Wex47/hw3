   Antfrost is an anthropomorphic Siamese cat with tan and brown fur. He initially had blue eyes, but due to the Egg's influence, they started shifting color, from purple, to pink, to finally red. He was seen with blue eyes past that date, likely during undercover situations. After being released from the Egg's influence, his eyes turned back to blue.

   . His main focus switched from caring for his animal sanctuary, towards the goals of the the Egg and the
   Eggpire
   . He became willing to chase down and attempt to manipulate anyone for the Egg. He became careless towards people's health, forcing people to get corrupted by the Egg. His one-goal mind resulted in the near-abandonment of his animal sanctuary, which also served as his base.

   Antfrost attended a meeting between himself,

   This plan was somewhat successful with Bad being able to convince Antfrost, Punz and Puffy to go to the Egg without any sort of protection and help free the Egg and allow it to grow in the ruins of L'Manberg. Antfrost helped destroy the obsidian keeping the Egg hidden before showing Puffy the Egg in another attempt to show her the Egg's power. He then planted spores in L'Canyon with the others so the Egg would grow and infect more people.

   Later on January 20, 2021, he and BadBoyHalo met up with Puffy and Sam to try and convince them to join the Egg. They were unconvinced, and asked about his corrupted form, which Bad and Antfrost seemed to be oblivious to. They took them down to see the Egg, but it had little effect.

  <p key="a806bffe-ce95-41fa-81e1-1523d1d8a6ad">
   On January 24, Antfrost met with Tommy, who wanted to see Bad, as 'The Boys' (his Twitch chat) told him that he had something to do with the Egg.  Antfrost was continuously talking in a strange language in in-game chat. Ant and Bad convinced him to come to the Egg room and stand on top of the Egg, and Tommy reluctantly complied. Tommy felt no effect from the Egg but joked that he could hear it talking and that it wanted them to all start swearing. Ant and Bad listened to the Egg, and began to chase after Tommy to the Big Innit Hotel, where
   Sam Nook
   kicked them out for not having hard hats. They threatened Tommy before leaving.

  <p key="61b8fb88-ce83-4caa-b92c-165489bf2ed3">
   Ant and Bad then tracked down and found
   Tubbo
   and Tommy at the Egg, where Tubbo was being bullied by the Egg and sobbing. Ant and Bad attempted to capture them in an obsidian cage before they were promptly saved by Sam Nook. The trio ran to the
   Holy Land

   Foolish

   Sam and Puffy talked to the two of them about getting rid of the Egg because it had scared Tubbo and Ant and Bad had nearly killed Tommy trying to convert him to the
   Eggpire
   . Bad and Ant took them to the Egg Meeting Room (The Egg Hut), where Bad tricked Sam and sent him down a hole where he was trapped above the Egg. Puffy tried to fight Ant and Bad but was chased away. Bad then told Ant that the plan was falling into place.
  </p>
  <p key="8a750366-1ff3-49fb-a76f-afa3d7a2954e">
   Ant went to a meeting with Bad and Punz to discuss the current issues within the Eggpire. They revealed that Puffy had officially left the Eggpire, and that they had hired
   Ponk
   to get them in contact with someone who could kill Puffy. The three of them confronted Ponk who took them to
   Purpled
   in his hideout. After some discussion, Ant, Bad, and Punz asked Purpled to get Puffy to fall into the container above the Egg, like Sam, and to kill her if he wasn't able to. Purpled accepted after receiving a down payment and asked them to leave and not return unless they were invited.
  </p>
  <p key="71c088d7-7ac5-488b-9dc2-f65ee27d8f1b">
   Antfrost went back to the Eggpire meeting place and put Ponk down with the Egg. They discussed what happened to Sam, as he had been broken out by Puffy. They didn't want to do anything, as they believed the Egg had a plan for everyone. They discussed Sam Nook, talking about how they could get rid of him. Ant asked Bad if he was able to contact
   Technoblade
   , and Bad said he was not. The trio set off to look around the SMP, and found that the Blood Vines could not go into the Holy Land. Ant felt unnatural going into the Holy Land.
  </p>
  <p key="d3d6821d-146e-400b-877a-8f049caf82bf">
   Antfrost later checked on Ponk and discovered that he had been given food by someone and suspected Foolish due to a message in chat. He found him at his summer house. Foolish tried to bribe Ant with string and fish but he wasn't amused. Ant asked if he knew anything about Ponk, but Foolish said he didn't and blamed Philza. Ant thanked him for helping the Egg and left.

   On February 2, Tommy stole a piece of the Egg to put in the Big Innit Hotel. This angered Antfrost, who tracked and killed Tommy, along with Ponk and Punz. He was soon chased off by Sam Nook, but came back later, when he was seen talking to the Egg. Sam dropped in and asked him and Bad about the Egg's plans for him, but neither of them answered. Sam offered them food, but they fed it to the Egg. Antfrost gave Sam a seed to plant before Sam left, but Sam later burnt it in the nether.

   room to continue their party. Puffy came in again and yelled at them. After they left the hotel, they found that the

He blocked off the tunnel to the Egg so other members wouldn't notice the Banquet preparations, telling Foolish, who was near the spider farm, that there was a collapsed cave. He planted some Egg seeds at
   Snowchester

After all the attendees' secret weapons were stolen and the Egg survived Sam's explosion, Ant sacrificed Foolish to the Egg using an axe, while mocking Puffy, saying that it was her fault, and that things would have been different if she had stayed with the Eggpire. When
   Quackity

Antfrost proposed that they should apologize to their friends for the events that occurred at the Red Banquet, which BadBoyHalo begrudgingly agreed with. Antfrost met with Puffy and apologized for the events. She apologized for killing him in return and commented that his eyes were back to a blue color, changed back from the red color which came with the Egg's control. Puffy confronted BadBoyHalo for not taking responsibility for his actions while under the Egg’s influence, stating that Antfrost had "[done] all the dirty work." BadBoyHalo apologized.

       Since Ant's first appearance on the SMP (along with Sam's return to the server), Ant and Sam have had a very positive relationship and can be found together a lot. Ant also formed the Badlands with Sam, fought alongside him during the

       , and even attempted to move pandas to Ant's animal sanctuary with him. However, Sam and Ant came into conflict over the Crimson Egg. Ant believed that the Egg should be protected, while Sam believed that it was evil and should be destroyed at all costs, despite Ant trying to convince him otherwise. Sam started to question if he should remain loyal towards him. Antfrost and BadBoyHalo trapped him with the Egg. He escaped due to Puffy's help, but his relationship with Antfrost has worsened due to

       Their relationship has further soured after Sam accused Ant of being partly responsible for Dream's escape due to his taking a break from guard duty. Ant holds Sam responsible for the majority of the blame, and the two have argued fiercely over this, with Sam implying he would become violent if further pressed. While complaining to Bad about Sam, Ant stated his feelings that Sam no longer cared about the Badlands and had de-facto abandoned the faction, further highlighting their strained relations.

After Punz joined the Eggpire and became corrupted by the Egg, Ant was more trusting towards Punz and worked together to spread the blood vines.
