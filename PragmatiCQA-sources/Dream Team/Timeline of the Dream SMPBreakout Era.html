Dream even heard Sam yell Quackity's name to stop him as he was about to kill Dream, knowing that Sam didn't want Dream dead. Sam then states the prison wasn't there to kill the inmates, but to keep them locked up. Dream then repeats that he can't be killed as people like Sam or
      Tommy

Sam reluctantly agrees not to tell Quackity Dream is still here, as Dream re-iterates that Quackity will kill him should he find out. But Dream also states that Sam will still have to feed him, to which Sam tells Dream he doesn't have to, stating they've been eating half meals, whilst Dream confesses they've been saving them, not so they could escape, but just because Sam only gives them raw potatoes.

But Sam explained that Dream had just been a part of an incident where he may have escaped. Dream however mentioned it was secure, but Sam continued on, saying he had sealed it up because it was a security flaw because the prisoner didn't see the light, and continuing to point out the ideas that Dream had knocked back, including steak for the prisoner. Dream acknowledged that he didn't know he would be in here, and Sam explains that Dream thought it was okay for someone else to eat raw potatoes other than him; that now that it's him locked up in the prison, it isn't as fun.

He also cited what Dream had put Tommy through, and instead he should be thankful that he's still alive here. Sam acknowledged that Dream had really commissioned the prison for Tommy to be the prisoner, and that they both know that; to allow visitors so that he could present Tommy off, and to seal the courtyard so that Tommy wouldn't see the light. Sam continues, saying that Dream wouldn't have wanted to give Tommy good food, and instead raw potatoes, and to have a horrible life.

Sam tells Dream he should be lucky that Sam isn't telling Quackity he is still in the prison, and that maybe next time it would be Sam who comes into the cell rather than Quackity. Dream acknowledges what he had said, and Sam orders Dream to the far wall. Sam tells Dream he will be back to fill in the hole, and to be no more shenanigans, otherwise Sam will tell Quackity.

He finishes with the base itself, reminiscing on when Sam and Boomer were in a call whilst Sam dug out and worked out what pattern to make the floor. Purpled arrived late, and broke the entrance to the base, much to Sam's annoyance.

Sam then realized he forgot to show Boomer a couple of areas of his base, so the three returned to Sam's current base. The first was Sam's triple spider XP spawner and enchanting table and room underneath. As they returned to the surface, they were greeted by a skeleton army, which Sam and Ant killed, whilst Boomer hid back in the spawner. Boomer returns to the surface, and the 3 lead the skeleton horses back to the base. They then take the skeleton horses through the nether, and back to the Greater Dream SMP and Ant's animal farm, having a look around whilst they are there.

      Foolish starts at his summer home and decides he needs more dirt and goes over to the main SMP. On the way through the nether, he questions why he's actually even building a statue for XD as XD hasn't been all that benevolent to Foolish (referencing Foolish's recent loss of all his player heads in gambling).

      Foolish tries to give DreamXD a steak, which DreamXD burns in lava. Foolish is offended and tries to type out an insult, but XD smites him with lightning. Foolish tries to protest that he can use lighting too, to which DreamXD responds by raining lightning down on Foolish. A horse and a pig get caught in the crossfire and the horse burns to death and the pig becomes a zombie pigman.

Foolish then apologizes and tries to cut a deal with DreamXD, saying that Foolish will build XD something in exchange for some "illegal" items. DreamXD then holds a pink shulker box for a split second, much to Foolish's excitement.

      DreamXD holds an Elytra and gets the "Sky's the Limit" achievement. Foolish asks for the elytra to make building the statue faster, but DreamXD sets the floor on fire and burns two elytra in front of Foolish. He then equips the elytra and "juggles" slabs of wood by switching them to and from his off-hand. Foolish tries to assert dominance by "juggling" a bed in the same way.

      Foolish rambles to XD about therapy and acceptance to which XD places a sign to respond to. Foolish tries to strike XD with his sword while his back was turned writing the sign, but the attack doesn't land since XD was in creative. XD's sign says "spread the word of god."

      Foolish asks DreamXD if he spreads the word will get "the good stuff" but gets struck with more lightning, much to his indignation. DreamXD places another sign saying "if you earn it you can become a god." Foolish inquires if this is how he can reach "full godhood," wondering if he could become "FoolishXD" and rule with an iron fist up in the skies with DreamXD.

      Foolish gets struck with more lightning at this so he adjusts and says he'd be 'slightly below' DreamXD. DreamXD nods at this and then places a sign that reads 'you can have one godly power bestowed on you' and strikes Foolish with lightning. Foolish questions the lightning strike, wondering if it is DreamXD's way to be dramatic.
     </li>
     <li key="18c9987d-d80f-48f5-90b3-8d8b5e8e7a0d">
      Foolish tries to ask for clarification on the power, and DreamXD responds by placing a sign that reads "I have to see my kingdom first." Foolish wonders if DreamXD means he already had a kingdom or if he wants Foolish to build one.

        Since I've left the greater L'Manberg area, I've had the time to breathe and recollect my own thoughts. Although I've heard very little coming from town, I had a new visitor not very long ago. While he couldn't stay long, his company was nice. We exchanged pleasantries and he was quickly on his way.
       </li>
       <li key="b20cc0f8-5e8e-4b6c-8ef1-fd0357bf337b">
        A few days ago, I went back into town. I was invited to a dinner for friends. While I didn't necessarily know a lot of the people too well who were there, it was nice. It makes me wonder, though. From what I've been told, when there's a big get together, things usually end up heading south, and pretty quickly at that. Before anything could even happen though, it was over. We didn't even get to eat. The faces were nice. It felt like what should be the norm. To have a sit down, even though the intended purpose of our visit did not get to happen. But like I said, things have just been quiet, simply put. Around here anyways.
       </li>
       <li key="e3ad3d24-dd17-416c-9887-fe7e680c5a61">
        Now that I think about it, I have felt more productive than ever. I've continued to build my base of operations. I've found myself enjoying more of my own hobbies. Believe it or not, I've even taken up farming. And I've started putting together more of the pieces. The pieces.
       </li>
       <li key="ddcb9962-6b44-4b8c-9e5e-1dec87c0ce81">
        I've went back and forth between here and town occasionally. Going off of things I've heard, and things I've personally witnessed. I've started to see a bigger picture in all of this. Maybe I'm overreacting; or maybe everybody else is just working in from the corners. Either way, I still have some discomfort.

       <li key="49ea6dfd-aab8-43c9-b148-1517fb15518d">
        I even don't know if anybody is even listening to me. I have no idea. But weirdly, that gives me comfort. It does. Being able to come and give my confessional to a microphone stored away in my hidy-hole has given me a feeling of more control than I have ever previously had. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't do this. If this was taken from me, I'd probably go crazy.
       </li>
       <li key="f8be03fe-09ac-453c-85d8-3b5d6a750ea5">
        I've noticed that this is slowly becoming my diary. While I go off braving the ideas of isolation, in my own edge of extinction, this gives me comfort. A person, who doesn't have anybody to speak to, finally has a voice. Maybe all of this talking will have done me well. I plan on going into town in a few days. Maybe the locals will still be friendly. Maybe I really have, honestly, looked at all of this wrong.

As they swim through, Sam kills Apollo, and on the other side, meeting both Bad and Sam, and starts to fight them both. Bad dies twice to Techno, as Techno and Dream swim through the water tunnel to the next area of the prison.

    Back outside, the group of Sapnap, Punz, Michael and Eryn hear the wind of Bad dying to Techno at McPuffy's, and Eryn mentions how he saw Phil, Techno and Niki by the portal, having been told by them not to tell anyone about their sighting. Niki joins them and tells them about them hearing an alarm.

      The rest of the group question the alarm, to which Niki backtracks, stating she may have just imagined it. She welcomes Michael and Eryn to the server, but Sapnap grows suspicious of the alarm that she mentions, but Niki reiterates that she just imagined it, putting it down to being along in her underground city for a while.

      Sapnap still isn't sure, and privately messages Punz to say that something is up, with Punz messaging back that he doesn't trust her. Eryn meanwhile asks where Niki came from, to which Niki replies that she was getting resources to build a garden.

      The group then head inside to McPuffy's to eat, but as they do, Sam comes running up to tell everyone to go to the side of the prison (near to where the watchtower is), as Dream is escaping. Tommy joins, and tells Sam not to joke about these things, but Sam insists he is being super serious. And reiterates that Techno is in the prison trying to break Dream out. Jack then joins and complains about the alarm being so loud.

     <li key="db964a79-4f3e-4d80-9123-ad46eede0b06">
      Tommy comes to the realization that Sam was telling the truth, as Sam is teleported back inside the prison, as the rest of the group remain by the Southside of the prison between the watchtower and the hypertunnel to Snowchester. Tommy then explains what Dream has put him through, including leaving him in exile and killing him, as to the reason why he should be in the prison.

    Meanwhile back inside the prison, Dream and Techno swim back, and study blueprints for another way in. They find their way into the other cells, and to their surprise, find Connor locked in one of the cells. They find Ranboo in the cell next to them, and make the escape back to the room. Techno equips both Ranboo and Connor with armor, splash everyone with Fire Resistance and all of them swim through the lava back down the path to where Techno broke in.

      The 4 of them make it back to the tunnel Techno mined to get in, and start waking back through. However, Sam follows them through and swims up to catch Dream. They are then met by the group on the shore that was waiting for them, as they themselves realize who was there, and start shooting, with a battle breaking out.

      Sam meanwhile hands Ranboo something which stops Ranboo in his tracks. Dream tries to leave, but Sam threatens to kill Ranboo if Dream doesn't stay. Ranboo starts to take off his armor, whilst Sam continues to threaten to kill him.

      At that point, Ranboo is killed by Sam, and Techno looks to avenge his death. But as he does, the wither which was spawned come for them, so head off for the horses, and start to make their escape with Phil the way they came.

      Those still at the prison start fighting the withers. Sapnap spots Niki trying to spawn a third wither, and starts fighting her. Sapnap breaks the summoning platform, and announces Niki's actions to the group. He joins the rest, as the withers make their way to Punz's house, and then towards the bank.

      Dream, Phil, Techno and Connor reach the portal, and block up the portal on the Nether side as they head through, before Dream, Phil and Techno make their way back to the artic. Sapnap and Eryn lead a group to start chasing them through the nether, but lose the trace. Eryn suggests breaking off pursuit, much to everyone's disgust. Niki meanwhile travels through the portal at L'Manberg, and spots the group going after them.

      Sapnap however spots Niki and suggests following her.

      Sapnap suggests the group splits up, and heads off with Punz. He then speaks to Punz individually, stating that the pair of them are the only ones that have a chance to defeat Dream, and anyone who went with them would have died. They try to work out where Dream and the Syndicate would've gone, and Punz suggests splitting up to cover more ground

      Sapnap returns to the community house, and meets up with Bad and Eryn. Bad asks if they were able to find him, whilst Sapnap tells Eryn all about Dream and what he has done previously. Eryn suggests that he could take Dream down, but Sapnap rejects his optimism, and suggests that Eryn and Bad stick together to look for Dream, whilst Sapnap continues alone to look for him.

     <li key="ca317c51-9a3c-4314-96af-531c72fc7d82">
      Sapnap works through where Dream would go next, working out who he was working with, and questions if he would be the one who kills Dream. He returns to the spot that the group escaped from, and spots Ranboo near the prison watchtower. Sapnap approaches Ranboo, not knowing he is dead, and asks what happened. Ranboo replies joyfully that he has some bread, and leaves the area.

      Sapnap returns his efforts to Dream, swimming to the prison walls to find where they escaped from, to see if there are any clues to their escape, but is hit by mining fatigue, and looks for a cow to get milk. Tubbo logs on, and Sapnap tells him the news of Dream's escape.

    Techno, Phil and Dream meanwhile make it back to the artic, and Techno asks the armor back from Dream. Dream then makes a run for it, leaving Phil and Techno at their homes. Realizing he could bring people back to life, Techno runs after Dream, but is nowhere to be seen. The pair then ask if Niki was making it back, but to their surprise, Connor turns up, shortly followed by Niki who mentions that Sapnap saw her set off the Wither; and the four of them all go to the loft to sellout. Techno also tells Niki that Ranboo had died.

    Tommy meanwhile finds out Dream has escaped, and starts building up walls, before heading to Dnret. As he finds the axe, Dream emerges through the portal, and breaks it. Dream starts to threaten Tommy, stating he will kill and revive Tommy over and over. The pair argue, and Dream explains that he had been tortured by Quackity of which he thinks Tommy knew about, something which Tommy looks confused about. Dream continues to chase after Tommy, and starts attacking him. They stop, talk, before Dream starts chasing Tommy again, continuing to argue as they chase, with Dream ender pearling to get closer to him.

      As they chase, he makes it back to the artic and screams for Phil's help whilst Dream chases him. As Tommy reaches Phil, Dream disappears, whilst Tommy continues to panic. As Tommy hides in Phil's house, Tommy explains how he saw Dream break out, and realizes Phil was there too. Phil reassures him that it was only purely for business, and that it was only to repay a favor.

      Tommy, still panicking, explains what had happened, whilst asking Phil to keep watch. Phil disapproves of Dream's actions, and agrees to take Tommy back to his base. As they walk, Tommy asks why he had to blow up L'Manberg, and Phil explains it had to be done, stating that they cared more about the land and the country rather than the people. He asks Tommy how much better he has felt since he didn't have to deal with arguments. Tommy tries to convince him that the materials are a sign of victory, to which Phil agrees, but tells Tommy that people are way more important. Tommy forgives Phil, but not for the incident itself.

      At that point, Ranboo turns up, a lot more relaxed than previously, and in a different skin, handing both Phil and Tommy bread and explaining he is a lot less stressed now he had been killed. Tommy hands him an allium flower, ushers him inside, and asks what happened. Ranboo explains how he is a lot more free, that he no longer has to worry about books or his memory, and that he can remember everything.

Quackity asks Tommy that if he needs anything to go speak to him, as he can't trust anyone in this world.

Quackity then asks if he has anyone else to look after him, and completes a set of netherite armor. And with that, Tommy leaves him at the MLG tower.
