   While working on their own plans, Sapnap and Karl discovered that Tommy stole Pokimane's welcome book. Feeling a bit vengeful, Sapnap asked Karl if he knew where Henry was being kept, as he'd mentioned being aware of the location earlier. Karl replied that he'd been joking, and had no real clue as to where Tommy had hidden Henry. Sapnap then threatened Karl, who combat logged, before offering him money instead. Karl declined the offer, despite the fact that he wasn't happy about Tommy stealing Poki's welcome book.

  <p key="62846c5b-f21b-4920-ac0e-0cd9c1d0da68">
   On a whim, Karl took Sapnap to
   The Eiffel Tower
   to get a good look at it, unaware that Henry was there. When they arrived, they found a cow leashed to one of the legs of the tower, and upon taking a closer look, found that it happened to be Henry. Karl was surprised, saying he had no idea, believing that Henry was still in Tommy's holiday home. Sapnap then decided that he should hold Henry captive in order to get leverage over Tommy, saying that it wouldn't be in Karl's best interest not to, as Tommy still hadn't returned the book, and he wouldn't have any other motive to do so if they didn't take Henry.
  </p>
  <p key="ed4730c6-5a51-477f-b149-04d88b1655a8">
   Karl was very reluctant about letting Sapnap take Henry hostage, but he decided to let him do it as long as they both agreed that he never purposefully brought Sapnap to Henry's location, since Karl would've felt obligated to tell Tommy about it. Sapnap then unleashed Henry, and began toying with the idea of torturing Henry on stream, something Karl was very much against. While leading Henry off of the platform entrance to
   Skeppy's Mansion
   , Sapnap jumped off the side, killing Henry in the process.
  </p>
  <p key="1af5b867-5b46-4721-9b63-185fdd63bab6">
   Karl was horrified that Sapnap would ever think about outright killing Henry, but Sapnap rebutted by saying that he hadn't meant to do it. Karl, still horrified, told his chat not to tell anyone, and quickly came up with the idea to find a replacement cow.

   As the situation, and their knowledge of Tommy's wrath settled in, Sapnap and Karl starting shifting the blame onto each other. Karl claimed that it was Sapnap's fault for killing Henry, while Sapnap claimed that it was Karl's fault for leading him to the Eiffel Tower in the first place. Sapnap decided the best course of action was to to replace Henry with a random chicken that he found. Both of them were immediately concerned for the future of the server and their own alliances, as Tommy's war mongering ability and endless rage was well known, along with two of his closest allies at the time being

   Sapnap then planned to store Henry's remains in his ender chest for safe keeping, but George logged on to discuss what had happened and come up with a plan. George then mixed Henry's beef with another random one, and Sapnap killed him to retrieve it, eventually ending up with the right meat.

   When Tommy next logged on, his chat started to tell him about Henry's death.
   Tommy didn't believe the statements while heading to the Eiffel Tower in order to make sure Henry was alright. When he arrived, he found a chicken leashed to the tower under the sign that had previously been for Henry. Tommy then found the clip of Henry's death on Sapnap's stream, and began plotting his revenge.

He was unsuccessful as Dream and Tommy managed to encase the top portion in stone. The bottom part was untouched, except for the fact that it was flooded, and subsequently caught on fire from the lava. In addition to this, Niki was annoyed by Karl's Llama - who was walking into her and moving her around, so she pushed it off the Eiffel Tower where it hung from it's leash. Before it was strangled to death, Skeppy realized what Niki was doing and removed the leash, but the Llama fell off and died of fall damage.

Nihachu watched the battle from afar after losing all of her weapons and armour in the previous scuffle and after deciding to join anyway, Technoblade killed her in the confusion leading her to come to the conclusion to continue watching. Eventually Sapnap, Bad, and Skeppy retreated, leaving much of their high powered gear behind, meaning that Tommy, Dream, Punz, Nihachu, and Techno had won the first battle. After the battle was over, most of the gear that was lost from Sapnap's side was returned. However Tommy had collected a lot of the high powered gear, and although he returned some of it, he decided to keep some of it, and logged off before anyone could confront him about it. Tommy and everyone in the call also agreed to keep this whole war secret from Schlatt and Wilbur to avoid any further conflict.
