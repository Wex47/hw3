   Her species has been confirmed to be a fairy.
   Although she appears human-like, she appears to have a connection with the flowers around her house, which tie very closely to her life force and her health to the point that even when thousands of blocks away from her home, she grew very sickly and weak when the vines leeched at her roses.

   Hannah is a kind and helpful individual who spends much of her time on the SMP cleaning up messes and decorating areas. She is an excellent builder and decorator, having cleaned up and decorated multiple public places on the SMP such as the tree farm and spawn. She has also gifted her roses to multiple people on the server.

   However, when faced with conflict, she does not hesitate to intervene and take action. She is very unlike some on the server, who are hesitant or avoidant of the conflicts around them to some extent and do not want to cause more damage. Hannah will readily take extreme actions in the name of solving problems and keeping peace--such as when she killed her dogs so that they would not suffer and succumb to the influence of the Crimson.

   Hannah is sometimes unaware of the extent of certain conflicts on the server and can underestimate them, believing them to be easily solved by something as simple as placing a rose. However, as seen with the Crimson, this is often not the case, and it can lead her to be put in danger or harmed.

   For the first few months on the server, Hannah wasn't involved in any conflicts. She built a path to the Rose Residence and gave all of the members a rose from her. She also went mining in the nether a lot, and managed to get hold of a lot of netherite. She interacted with a lot of people, but always seemed to make friends with them. Hannah spent a lot of her time harvesting Wither Roses and planting them around the Rose Residence. She also started a wheat farm and used the products to create an entire field of cakes for everyone.

Hannah agreed and went mining for gold, but only came up with seven causing Ponk to try and kill her. Hannah said she would give him nine more to keep the deal and Ponk gave her an item frame telling her to put it up. Hannah places the picture to find it is a huge picture of Steve Harvey. She destroys it and burns the picture in lava. She wakes up the next morning to find a ladder up the side of her house and an attic at the top. The attic is covered in pictures of the Kanye picture she burned and one picture on the floor, which is of her in her house taken from a bird's eye view. Her blast furnaces had also been stolen. Ponk arrived at her house for the gold, but she didn't have it yet so Hannah hid in the attic. Ponk tried to break into her house through the ground but she dropped lava on top of him. Ponk left, vowing revenge. Hannah returned to her house after mining for a little while to discover her entire house had been filled with dirt by Ponk. Hannah then went to nether to get the gold, but the portal was blown up by Ponk and she ended up falling into the lava with all of her stuff including the gold and dying.

   Hannah is very clearly sick whenever she is in proximity to the Egg and tries to leave but Ant and Bad won't let her. Instead she places roses, hoping that they would combat the strength of the Egg and saying they improve her health. However, The Egg tells Bad and Ant it likes Hannah and not to kill her. Instead, they trap her in a box right above the Egg, and Hannah states she will be there for a while, and that she suspected something like this may happen. Hannah then shows her roses in her inventory, saying that she thought that they were enough to last her the night, but it wasn't after Ant took some. She then complains about feeling faint before passing out in the Egg room.

   The next time Hannah wakes up from fainting is the next day when Sam comes to save her, but the two discover that her skin has been completely leached out of all color. Sam walks down the Egg, making Hannah follow him. She says that she still feels very ill with all her roses gone, and could not even sprint, but that the Egg was speaking to her and she wants to listen.

   When they reach the house, Hannah discovers that it is covered in blood vines, the color had been leeched out of the walls like her skin and all of her roses had vanished and all that was left were white tulips. Hannah attempts to convince Sam not to destroy the blood vines, despite the fact he pointed out they'd almost destroyed all of her roses. Hannah said the Egg was making her punch Sam, be rather angry and more, and Sam tries to reconvince Hannah about how harmful the Egg could be to her.

However, once she has hidden in the basement she hears the Egg telling her to go and reveal herself. Hannah climbs out of it and goes around the house to where she can see Sam and the Eggpire arguing, seeing this she doesn't know whether to reveal herself like the Egg wants her to or hide like Sam wants her to. Before she can come to a decision, the Eggpire leaves. Sam gets angry at Hannah for leaving her basement on the Egg orders, but Hannah promises not to listen to it anymore. The two part ways, and Hannah wonders whether to keep the promise.

Whilst Bad and Puffy argued, Hannah stood in the background quietly chanting 'Sacrifice.' Ant murdered Foolish and, although a bit has taken back, Hannah immediately asked who to kill next.

Once the Eggpire left, Bad commanded them all to split up as Purpled was still chasing them. It is unknown where Hannah went after that as nobody has seen her since. In a short lore explanation, Hannah said that her character is still heavily influenced and infected by the Egg, but also confused - not realizing the consequences and still believing she can run the bank with Sam.

      Hannah was at first not happy about the blood vines, as it was covering her house. It also made her feel faint, sick and unwell. Hannah decided to take this problem with her own hands and visited the Egg, but Antfrost and BadBoyHalo trapped her in a box near the Egg. Sam rescued Hannah from the Egg, at which Hannah felt sort of attached to the Egg, saying it was speaking to her constantly. Sam burnt the remains of the blood vines in Hannah's house, and Hannah stated that it 'hurt' her when he did so. However, Hannah ultimately agreed with Sam that the Egg was a bad thing, but as he left she wondered if what she had said was true.

       When Hannah woke up with no memory of the server, she felt a pull to the Egg Room. However, she didn't like the sound of the Egg but still was going to enter, before anything happened Sam led her away. When her memory returned, Hannah wasn't sure why she wanted to go there but she knows that the Egg wants her to return.

       Hannah later met up with members of Pro-Omelette with her skin back to normal and feeling better. She agreed to help them fight the Eggpire by hiding weapons in holes and the basement. Despite being oddly quiet during meetings, Hannah seemed to no longer like the Egg especially when she at first declined the Banquet's invite due to fear of the Egg room. However, it later appeared as if Hannah was faking even being against the Egg, as she helped at the Banquet.

On top of this, flowers and nature "keep her alive" and give her power, as stated by Hannah herself. This is also the reason the Blood Vines affect her differently, as they are also nature-based.
