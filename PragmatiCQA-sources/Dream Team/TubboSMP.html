   Tubbo is a human with light skin, light blue eyes, blond hair, and long bangs. In fanart, he is more often depicted with his real-life dark hair, usually as a means of better differentiating him from
   Tommy
   , who has a similar blond and blue-eyed skin. He has multiple burn scars from his execution during the

   .
   He has also been confirmed to be short. In fanart, he is sometimes depicted with short, stubby ram horns, originally in reference to a fan theory of him being Schlatt's son. Tubbo's skin was originally Tweek from South Park, which Tubbo in real life is a big fan of.

   His official L'Manberg uniform matched those of his peers: a blue blazer over a white dress shirt with a red sash around the waist, cream breeches, a black-and-white tricorn hat, and long black boots. His presidential uniform, a simple navy suit with golden shoulder pads over a white undershirt and red tie was influenced by the former design and formerly belonged to

   Tubbo plays the character of a hyperactive, earnest, and somewhat naive sidekick. He is often seen following
   Tommy
   around, usually assisting him in his pranks and hijinks. Tubbo is fairly easygoing and optimistic if a tad phlegmatic, and tends to be more of a follower than a leader. He likes to do as he’s told and is easy to push around, which has caused several problems for him in the past. He’ll go with the flow of most things as long as they don’t directly interfere with his morals, which he sticks very close to. Tubbo hears voices in his head, and said that this is what his Twitch chat is in the canon of the SMP.

   Tubbo is somewhat scatterbrained but an all around loyal and good person. He knows what he can and can't do and prefers to just stay within his own boundaries. He also is very lawful, knowing where his loyalties lie, and is a poor fibber when it comes to facing authorities like

   - even when he knows it’s the morally right thing to do. He shows a surprising capability for manipulating situations, indicating that his character is more intelligent than he typically lets on. Tubbo knows almost every glitch and exploit in Minecraft and is able to work basic and above redstone. He is also one of the best builders on the server, which makes him a valuable asset.

   , Tubbo’s loyalty to Tommy and Wilbur was his priority, although it was put on rocky waters when he became Jschlatt's right hand man. He at first submitted to Schlatt’s authority and attempted to hunt the two of them down, but due to his morals and his friendship with the fugitives, he decided that doing the right thing was more important than bending to power and chose to become a spy, thus making his character come full circle. He remained a passionate, thoughtful ditz who kept his smarts under the radar to avoid suspicion. He stayed extremely loyal to his original allies, and never betrayed them even when offered the biggest of bribes.

   Tubbo was often overlooked in favor of his arrogant counterpart, however, and many times had his own good deeds ignored by whoever’s authority he was under. On multiple occasions, he ended up doing things against his will due to his difficulty with saying no and standing up for himself. After the events of the

   , he looked to take matters into his own hands. Tubbo was hoping to prove that the country could take a turn for the better after the disastrous reigns of Schlatt and Wilbur, and he looked forward to finishing projects and starting new ones, as he had always been enthusiastic about mega structures and builds. In the beginning, Tubbo seemed to be behaving in a similar fashion as Wilbur had during the early L'Manberg stages: a leader who didn't fight, used words, and displayed strong charisma.
  </p>
  <p key="f45eefc7-fe8d-454d-b7d8-dd90bfdf4da4">
   However, this did not last long, as Tubbo easily folded under the pressure of both his cabinet peers and outside forces in an attempt to please his people and keep the nation safe. This meant he was often pushed around by others, notably Quackity in the formation of the Butcher Army. He also exiled Tommy at

   accused him of acting like Schlatt, he snapped at them for not respecting his authority, as he had often not been taken seriously enough and had finally reached a breaking point.
  </p>
  <p key="b027ac29-486b-467f-b31d-c9302c6640ab">
   After L'Manberg was reformed into a communist state under his own orders, Tubbo realized that peace wasn’t always an option and turned his focus to securing borders and building up the military in anticipation of attack from foreign parties. Despite this, he made no moves to reinforce his country against outside threats, instead resorting to the use of the
   Butcher Army
   and spent more time stealing from his own citizens under the guise of "taxes." He began to make less moral decisions, including holding

   without trial. He also generally began to drift away from L'Manberg's original principles of peaceful and diplomatic conflict resolution.
  </p>
  <p key="a4a54f37-c963-4601-9a8b-7b3644f59024">
   Despite all of his flaws, Tubbo was very aware of his downward spiral and his parallels to Schlatt. He almost broke down in a conversation with

   , talking about how almost everyone had left him, similarly to how everyone had left the previous president. When Quackity wanted to execute Ranboo for being a traitor, Tubbo was the one to step forward and defend him, having been in the exact same position as a decorator of a festival while also being a spy, and also indicating that his character was still suffering from trauma leftover from the Manberg Festival months prior.
  </p>
  <p key="e39ef712-ea2a-4be5-96ae-1bb09c00b55f">
   Tubbo's major flaws as a leader of L'Manberg were his short-sighted decisions and his perfectionist visions, as well as his inability to stop others from pushing him around. Tubbo only did what he thought was the best for the country in the short term. He exiled Tommy, but failed to pay heed to what L'Manberg valued most: isolationism and independence from being given choices by other factions. His idealistic and poorly thought-out decisions led to consequences that seemed beneficial at the time, but would ultimately result in nothing but further damage.

   Though Tubbo still appears as his usual silly self, a good part of it is a front for his self doubts, suppressed anger, and PTSD. After his administration and the events of the Doomsday War, Tubbo was shown to believe that he was the worst president to have sat in office - even though his proceeders were dictators and terrorists. He founded

   - at first, seemingly in order to create a safe haven for himself and other refugees of L'Manberg to live in peace - but it was later revealed that he had plans to create nuclear weaponry in Snowchester. He often stated that the nuclear weapons were for protection rather than active use, but nonetheless, their existence indicated that the events over the course of the server had left the impression on him that being more powerful than others was the only way to be safe, as Dream and

   had consistently proven throughout the storyline of the Dream SMP. He built the nukes out of apparent paranoia and guilt over his previous failure with the aim of protecting himself and the other residents from outside forces. Though he built nuclear weaponry, he didn't destroy them when Dream said that he cared about the item attachments, not the people.

   , when Dream was threatening to kill him, Tubbo told Tommy to keep Mellohi and let him die, saying that the disc was more important than he was. Tommy ignored him and gave the disc to Dream anyways, which appeared to upset Tubbo. At a later point, when Dream gave Tubbo and Tommy time to "say goodbye," Tubbo once again displayed passively suicidal behavior. He told Tommy, who was vehemently protesting, to give up and accept his death, like he himself had already done. Tubbo said that he had "done enough in life" and that it was "about time" he died, displaying no resistance to the concept. He was saved by the arrival of
   Punz
   and the rest of the SMP members who joined them, but without their interruption, it seems that Tubbo would have willingly died to protect Tommy and the discs. In a similar fashion, after his interaction with the

   , Tubbo repeatedly strayed towards lava and magma cubes - and while the actions were likely exaggerated on purpose, it still shows that his mental health had declined over the course of his presidency of L'Manberg, and he will need time to heal from the effects that it had on him.

    Flaws
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="b1af00b8-6f1b-454b-96bd-16ef559f7f69">
   Tubbo is incredibly trusting, loyal, and ready to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. While this is not inherently a flaw, it has often led to his manipulation, as people easily gain his trust to fulfill their own plans. As someone who often finds himself in positions of power, this trait is incredibly dangerous, with Tommy, Quackity, Dream, and Jack all using him or making him believe things at different times to achieve their own personal goals.
  </p>
  <p key="2e6fb991-13a6-4311-b92b-8ee50720483e">
   Tubbo often is reckless and endangers himself and others in the pursuit of an idealized future. His perfectionist attitude clouds his judgement in the present. For example, he became incredibly obsessed with "fixing" Ranboo's memory issues in a misplaced effort to help him, ignoring both that Ranboo did not want others to affect his memory and that his procedure's first attempt nearly killed Ranboo.

    Mental health
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="212b376c-e214-456d-a477-e5bbd756feef">
   Tubbo struggles with issues of self-worth and self-esteem. He is passive when others criticize his actions and is easily impressionable, taking criticism to heart and allowing himself and others to believe in his weakness. One example of this is when Tommy, in a fit of rage, told Tubbo at the
   <a href="Green Festival.html" key="fe9a9a15-3ae0-4474-9c5b-5e12c6c6eda0" title="Green Festival">
    Green Festival
   </a>
   that the discs were worth more than him;
   though Tubbo was hurt, he never argued against this and later asked Tommy to let him die in exchange for the discs multiple times during the
   <a href="Disc Confrontation.html" key="4de5496d-8560-4d08-abe6-2bdbbce64f12" title="Disc Confrontation">
    Disc Confrontation
   </a>
   .
   Another example also occurred at the Green Festival when Dream called Tubbo an idiot and the worst president L'Manberg had ever had;
   Tubbo later blamed himself for the destruction of L'Manberg because he believed that he was a bad president to the nation, and he held this belief was at least partly due to Dream's speech.
  </p>
  <p key="42381adf-702b-49e9-8fb5-7ae477284a5e">
   He also has a tendency to repress his emotions and trauma. Tommy said he has ‘thicker skin’, in comparison to Tommy, who is very open about his feelings and isn’t afraid to have trauma responses. This is not exactly true - Tubbo has been criticized in the past for showing emotion, mainly by Schlatt and Wilbur. Additionally, as Tubbo tends to believe the things people say about him (see above), statements like that would stick to Tubbo, and he would internalize it. Ranboo seems to have a good understanding that this is how Tubbo is, stating that Tubbo isn’t devoid of issues, he just prefers to ignore them and focus on other people’s problems.
  </p>
  <p key="5cffc4a8-2128-4646-ab78-6b063cbf6cf6">
   He also tends to be pessimistic or realistic without showing it, speaking in optimistic tones but acting in a completely different manner. An example of this is the
   <a href="Disc Confrontation.html" key="af16a4f9-e17e-48f7-8e08-628db3ee3385" title="Disc Confrontation">
    Disc Confrontation
   </a>
   and the conversation he had with Tommy leading up to it; while they were traveling towards
   Dream's mountain
   , he spoke optimistically about their chances,
   yet during the confrontation itself, he willingly accepted his incoming death and asked Tommy to keep the discs and sacrifice Tubbo for them.
  </p>
  <p key="efa07c42-f14c-4118-9f89-9966829b14bd">
   He is generally very self-sacrificing, even to the point of putting a suicide switch inside the nukes built as part of Project Dreamcatcher,
   indicating his willingness to die if it means keeping his loved ones safe. Another example of this is when he jumped in front of one of Technoblade's fireworks during the
   <a href="Doomsday War.html" key="0af29d73-8554-4be8-a4d5-c7ddf1ce03f6" title="Doomsday War">
    Doomsday War
   </a>
   in an attempt to protect Tommy, which instead resulted in both of them (non-canonically) dying.
   Despite only having one canon life left, he generally does not seem to care much about dying,
   and continues to act recklessly.
  </p>
  <p key="841a621e-1127-48e4-ab47-6a5c2bb9d670">
   He has also stated that if forced to choose between Tommy and Ranboo, he would rather "take himself out of the equation."
  </p>
  <p key="5fc9d2c4-dafd-499c-982b-a0aa0d1b9bef">
   Tubbo also occasionally uses drugs and/or alcohol, both in light-hearted moments and more serious ones. Examples of this are Connor's "Big Drama" party on January 23, 2021,
   the aftermath of the successful Project Dreamcatcher test launch on January 26, 2021,
   and the aftermath of exiling Tommy on December 4, 2020.
   He used to regularly eat pufferfish, calling them "stress relievers" and even offering them to others.
   Tommy also made Tubbo potions (drugs) as a present in an attempt to placate Tubbo and stop him from exiling Tommy from L'Manberg.

   . Tubbo teamed with Tommy, and the two of them tried on many occasions to get the two discs back - even succeeding a couple of times - but never for long, as the discs always seemed to end up back in Dream's possession. Their closest call was when Tommy once managed to retake one of the discs from a height and dropped it down to Tubbo, but Tubbo was unable to find it in time and Dream got to it first.

  <p key="ae95a51a-1840-4627-b884-e9871e6752c4">
   During his first month or so on the server, Tubbo became fast friends with several members that he hadn't already been familiar with — most notably Punz, who gifted him a pet bee named Spins. Tubbo was very grateful for Spins and kept him on a lead at his house. He was also a key player in

   , which began when Fundy non-canonically killed Tubbo and stole his diamond pickaxe, seemingly unprovoked. Tubbo and Purpled, who was another victim of Fundy's "mugging," sat down with Fundy to settle it in the newly-built
   Socializing Club
   , but they were interrupted by Tommy. Tommy was irritated at Tubbo for being caught up in something unrelated to getting his discs back, and it escalated into a battle. The fighting quickly dissolved into a confusing mess, though, as the whole place was ridden with pre-laid traps, and eventually, all parties agreed to return all items to their rightful owners and call it a day.

  <p key="4529a434-904b-4e84-8cf1-bb62b8d041ba">
   Once their issues were resolved, Tubbo agreed to return his attention to regaining Tommy's discs, and used a glitch to see into Dream's mountain base. They didn't find the discs, but they

   find a stack of diamonds, which they eagerly stole in hopes of using for negotiation. Through a series of complicated bargaining, Tommy was able to retrieve the discs, but was left on the run from Dream and with a limited amount of time to get them into an ender chest. He told Tubbo that he only had seven of the eight obsidian blocks necessary to make one, and Tubbo informed him that he had an extra piece of obsidian at his house. Using it, Tommy was able to craft the Ender Chest and get the discs inside of it just before Dream non-canonically killed him, thus securing his discs for the time being.

    court case

   with the same people that had been involved in the Socializing Club conflict, during which he and Fundy acted as judges when Tommy accused Purpled of scamming and attempting to kill him. Purpled argued that he had been told to do so by a large donation and requested that Tommy gave him his armor back, as Tommy had stolen it earlier. Tubbo took Purpled's side and pointed out that if the armor was returned, the issue could be resolved, but while he and Tommy were arguing, Purpled managed to sneak out of the courthouse and no formal verdict was ever decided on.
  </p>
  <p key="04d3d720-e040-4263-8c3d-a2b303523c7e">
   For a while, things ran smoothly. Tubbo turned his focus to surrounding his house with mob and item farms, and formed a zombie XP farm with Sapnap behind Purpled's UFO. Shortly later, Tommy accidentally killed Spins while attempting to "high-five" him. Tubbo was furious and griefed his base, and Tommy in return burned down his house. Tubbo and several others cornered him outside of the spawn region before the problem was resolved. Sapnap and Dream helped Tubbo fix his house once the conflict had died down, and Punz gave him a second bee, this one named Spunz.

   He and Sapnap later dug out a room beneath his house in hopes of creating a secret villager farm, which was technically against the rules of the server. It ended up being found by Dream, who killed all of Tubbo's villagers, disabled his iron golem farm, and warned him not to bend the rules. Tubbo, still wanting to get away with what he could, went on to instead build up a hidden jungle base, where he started another villager farm. It was only accessible from an ice boat on the Nether roof, and he felt confident that it wouldn't be found. Fundy discovered the base, but agreed not to tell Dream about it.

Tubbo lost his first canon life to Sapnap in the event. He was very hurt afterwards, as he and Eret had previously gotten on well and had grinded for materials together.

After several fights, Tommy exchanging everything Dream lost for Spirit's leather, the disappearance of Dream's maxed netherite sword, and Sapnap joining and betraying Tommy and Tubbo, the skirmish came to an end.

One of these pufferfish, named Phukkit, was passed to Fundy by accident before finding its way into Eret's hands, who then returned it to Tubbo.

   During yet another schism between Tommy and Dream, Tommy asked Tubbo to represent him in King’s Court as Big Law, but that court case never actually happened, as Dream never showed up. He later helped Tommy and Jack in scamming Dream out of Tommy's pets, Tubbo's bee boxes, and a fake Mellohi (as Tommy had already gotten back the real one) in exchange for a fake Spirit, Beckerson,
   Mars
   , and Dream's sword.

   He then created a new alter-ego, "Big Crime." Under this alter-ego, he burned down Ponk's Third Lemon Tree and killed one of his pet chickens, Bebbles. Ponk trashed his jungle base in retaliation, but he rebuilt it fairly easily. Tubbo later had a small skirmish with Fundy and
   Karl
   over stolen valuables, although the situation quickly defused after some negotiations.

As Big Law, he was present during the Presidential Debate in his courthouse, King's Court, and directed a significant fraction of the debate, being quoted as saying "You don't allow shit, bitch" to George before being replaced by Karl as director. After these events, he and Tommy burned down the unfinished mansion of Quackity, who was now their political rival. Tubbo later started to work on a

   On the night of the election, he invented a new but short-lived alter-ego: Toob. Soon before the results were announced, he and Tommy met up at a bench outside of Tommy’s house where they exchanged some sentiment, and Tubbo gave Phukkit to Tommy as a token of good luck. He then took Tommy and Wilbur to his partially-completed bunker, impressing them both. When the results were shown and it was revealed that

Tubbo tried to escape with them through the use of an invisibility potion, but was called up to the podium before he could follow. After quickly (and non-canonically) killing himself to have the potion wear off, he stood on the podium, where Schlatt made him Secretary of State for his
   administration
   , and ordered him to show Wilbur and Tommy "the door," the implication being that he ought to chase them out and kill them. While he did attempt to pursue his friends, he was not efficient in the job and didn’t put his full effort into it, and they both managed to escape into the wilderness through the use of his bunker. He was then forced, alongside many others, to tear down L'Manberg's walls. He did so reluctantly, but at the time he seemed begrudgingly willing to obey his new “emperor.”

  <p key="d0ea22cd-3c67-46fe-b364-ad330dcc25c9">
   Afterwards, he managed to convince Schlatt, through much struggle, not to tear down the Camarvan, as it was one of the oldest monuments of the land. He was still pressured into to destroying Wilbur's birthday signs, though. Schlatt suspected that Tubbo wasn't entirely pledged to him and confronted him about it, comparing him to a conch shell and threatening him. When

   After L'Manberg was renamed to Manberg, however, Wilbur, Tommy, and Technoblade convinced the already dissatisfied Tubbo to become a double agent for their commune (later named

   At Wilbur's request, Tubbo started to document what he experienced in Manberg as Schlatt's right hand man. He was later asked by Niki to join the
   Manberg Rebellion
   with her and Eret. Although supportive of the cause, Tubbo did not fully commit due to his role as a spy, as he felt guilty deceiving his fellow citizens, and thus far Schlatt hadn't done anything too terrible. Tubbo did take Niki to his bunker, however, where they started planning to monitor Schlatt's actions. He was soon messaged by Punz in regards to a possible alliance, and they met up in the Camarvan to discuss matters. There, Punz offered Tubbo several useful and valuable items, which Tubbo reluctantly took, and the two went their separate ways. He also began an archive of the History of L'Manberg, storing books in his bunker, and was asked to formally join Pogtopia by Wilbur and Techno. He said yes, and agreed to help in automating their potato farm.

   For a short while, he seemed to be doing his job as a spy well. He maintained Schlatt's trust and only visited Pogtopia when he could afford to. Technoblade also shared one of his horses - Spots - with Tubbo in order to make his traveling easier. Tubbo and Wilbur once had to sever the
   Prime Path
   in order to avoid being discovered by Schlatt and Quackity, which angered Tommy, but the rift didn't last long. He also participated in a brief scheme with Techno, Tommy, and Quackity called DoD (“Dogs on Drugs”) in which they bred an army of wolves with the intention of using them to threaten Schlatt and his supporters (or to coerce people into buying their drugs, as they told Quackity). It never amounted to much, though, and Tubbo ended up taking them all to his dock in L’Manberg and leaving them there.
  </p>
  <p key="0ec3b3b1-3af6-4c59-8b00-61f71453f41c">
   After a few weeks, Schlatt began noticing Tubbo's disappearances and questioned him on them, requesting that they had a formal meeting. At the meeting, Tubbo defended himself by claiming that he was still carrying out his duty by searching for Wilbur and Tommy. Schlatt commended him for his loyalty and shared his plans to burn down forests, drain oceans, and take down buildings on the original L'Manbergian land. Tubbo later relegated this information to Wilbur. Wilbur was starting to lose faith in Tubbo, though, and so to regain some of his Wilbur's favor, Tubbo told him about the mounting tensions between Quackity and Schlatt. He then finished the automated potato farm.

   When Schlatt declared that he would be throwing “a celebration of democracy,” Tubbo planned and decorated for the festival at Schlatt’s command. He was also tasked with giving a speech near the end and was excited to have a chance at being heard, declining Tommy’s offer to help him write it. He worked with Fundy and Karl to set up carnival games and attractions and was looking forward to the event as a whole, glad that something good was coming out of Manberg.

  <p key="17cfe7ab-5fb9-4b7d-b599-e82009878fd7">
   He was later pulled aside by a confused and rattled Tommy, however, who took him back to the bench near his home and informed him of Wilbur’s
   TNT plot
   . Tommy told him to be careful at the festival, as it would likely go downhill quick, and the two of them determined that the Mellohi disc Wilbur had given Tommy was a fake since the real disc was still in Tommy's Ender Chest in his house. Wilbur later met with Tubbo and told him that he wanted to blow up Manberg right after Tubbo’s speech, requesting that he didn't speak to Tommy and worked a code phrase into the very end: “Let the festival begin.” Tubbo vocally agreed with Wilbur’s plan, responding casually and with composure to avoid causing unnecessary conflict. He expressed discomfort with it after he had left the call, however, and told his stream that he hadn’t forgotten what Tommy had said.
  </p>
  <p key="5b38bc31-de50-4b81-aeaf-b2ed9411f651">
   During the festival itself, Tubbo mostly had fun with the other citizens of Manberg, enjoying the mock fights and dance floor. He briefly excused himself to meet up with Wilbur and Tommy to make sure that they had arrived safely, and Wilbur criticized his compliant nature, calling him a “yes man” and scorning his lack of decisiveness before urging him to go on and give his speech so he could detonate everything. After heeding a last warning from Tommy to be careful, Tubbo did as had been asked of him and returned to Schlatt's side to await his cue.

  <p key="853d14b0-b401-4a9d-8966-85aa6f2901f0">
   Once the right time had come, he went to
   the podium
   and gave his speech without a hitch, finally making the decision to end it with the given code phrase, submitting to Wilbur’s destructive wishes — but before anything could be done, Schlatt and Quackity began encasing Tubbo in concrete, trapping him on the platform to reveal that Schlatt had known that he was working with Wilbur and Tommy. Schlatt called him an idiot and pointed out that all of his disappearances had been obvious. He then asked Techno to come up to the platform and kill Tubbo with his rocket launcher. When Tubbo messaged Wilbur asking what he should do, Wilbur told him to do nothing as Technoblade was on their side— but after only a bit of hesitation, Techno fired the rocket launcher anyways, taking Tubbo's second canon life as well as killing Schlatt and Quackity in the process.
  </p>
  <p key="c07710d4-860b-43cb-a55a-7d39de8cce60">
   Afterwards, Tubbo regrouped with Tommy in his tunnel and the two of them returned to Pogtopia to find Wilbur, Technoblade, and Niki, who had come back with Wilbur. At Wilbur's urging, Tommy challenged Techno to a fight, angry at him for having killed Tubbo, but ended up losing fairly quickly. Tubbo stated that he forgave Techno and didn’t want any more infighting than they could afford. He, Tommy, and Niki then listened to another one of Tommy's discs, Blocks, at a ridge overlooking the stream that flowed in to Manberg territory, promising to stick together no matter what and to do everything in their power to avoid the destruction of their nation.

   Tubbo did not do much between the events of the festival and the 'season one' climax, instead settling into more of a background role. He was offline when Quackity joined Pogtopia, but he still showed a considerable amount of trust in him - most likely because he had assassinated Schlatt before swapping sides, which seemed to be a pretty good indicator of trustworthiness.

After Dream made it known that he would be fighting for Schlatt and that there was a traitor amongst the Pogtopians, Tubbo avoided voicing suspicions about anybody aloud. He was pulled aside again by Tommy, who took him back to the bench and gave him Mellohi as a symbol of trust, hoping to prove that he wasn't the traitor and that he knew it wasn't Tubbo, either.

   Just prior to the events of the climactic battle, Tubbo met up with his allies at his L’Manberg dock: Techno, Niki, Quackity, Fundy, Eret, and Jack Manifold. One of the first soldiers to prepare, Tubbo had geared himself out with an unenchanted netherite axe, crossbows that were specifically designed to shoot either arrows or rockets, and full enchanted netherite armor (except for the helmet). After being ambushed several times by Dream and Punz, they instead met with Wilbur and Tommy as they came from the
   L'Mantree
   , a tree that had been standing since the beginning of the server and was protected by an obsidian wall. After a last trip back to Pogtopia, Technoblade led everyone to his own
   bunker
   , which was an arsenal of potions, weapons, armor, and other equipment. Tubbo was able to stack up even more, although he also stole a few stacks of emeralds that were not intended to be taken.

   Tubbo rushed into the actual fight side-by-side with his comrades and allies, starting by sprinting along the Prime Path and eventually managing to retake one of Eret’s towers. The combat — consisting of the Pogtopians against Schlatt, Dream, Sapnap, Punz, Purpled, and Karl — was brief, and the Pogtopians were able to take down their opponents with relative ease. After Dream surrendered, Tubbo followed him and the others to the Camarvan where he witnessed Schlatt's final canon death from heart failure. He was the first to provide a reaction by exclaiming,

   Upon returning to Manberg — or as the name was quickly switched back to, L'Manberg — Tubbo watched Wilbur's coronation for Tommy to become president, and then Tommy passing the power to Wilbur, and was finally given the authority himself. He was startled and caught off guard by suddenly being handed the presidency, but he felt honored and was glad for it all the same. Tubbo wished for L'Manberg to become a strong and prosperous but peaceful nation.

   After his improvised presidential speech, he came down from the podium and was greeted and congratulated by many of his fellow Pogtopians. After only a few minutes, however, Technoblade came forward, and, seemingly out of the blue, opened fire on Tubbo — mortally wounding him in a non-canon assassination. Tommy, Fundy, Quackity, and the others were quick to jump to his defense, but Techno declared that the whole reason he had joined Pogtopia had been to take down the government, and he didn’t appreciate having a new one be established right in front of him.

  <p key="0bd5afa2-a3bf-4490-8e5f-1a06b897a311">
   Tubbo was shocked by the twist and was slow to get back to L'Manberg. He missed the majority of the action, including Wilbur blowing up L'Manberg, Technoblade summoning the Withers, and Philza killing Wilbur as his debut to the server. When he finally did make it back, he was confronted again by Technoblade and was shot once more, but he responded with impressive calmness, only displaying strong charisma through words before leaving to help his friends fight the Withers.

  <p key="99b081af-1df3-4d07-80bd-80417fc7ed7a">
   He rejoined the calamity, and Tommy told him to stay close for fear of separation, which had thus far only resulted in one or both of them being put into serious danger. They managed to kill the Withers, and although Techno escaped and Tubbo was left as the “president of a crater” as Wilbur had put it before dying, he expressed that he was still looking forward to what the future held.

   Once the destruction had cleared up, Tubbo and the New L'Manbergians gathered at the L'Mantree to determine who would be remaining in New L’Manberg. Players who wanted in were Tommy, Purpled, Eret, Fundy, Niki, Quackity, Karl, Jack, and Philza. Tubbo then named his cabinet; the Vice President would be Tommy, Fundy would be the foreman, Quackity would be the Secretary of State, Karl would be the Creative Head Director, and Niki would become Secretary of Treasury. Eret, Purpled, Jack Manifold and Philza would become citizens, with
   CaptainPuffy
   later joining them. Although Karl and Purpled had been fighting on the opposite side, Tubbo was unbothered by that and allowed them entry into the nation anyways.  
He and Tommy then returned to their spot at their bench to listen to Mellohi and reflect on the events of the day. They were joined by Dream in a brief moment of peace before the next chapter, and Tubbo stated that he would dedicate the majority of his attention to the reconstruction of L’Manberg.

   Tubbo got to work on the very next day, immediately beginning reconstruction by purchasing three sets of diamond tools from his villagers at his old jungle base. Tubbo distributed the tools to the players who needed them and began to tear down the annoying rubble, as well as finally removing the remaining decorations from his own execution. He also constructed a new stage/
   podium

Tubbo and Ghostbur worked together to rebuild much of what had been destroyed and established a bit of closure that had never been achieved with Wilbur.

  <p key="b3baca32-34e6-4345-b6de-7d13e83a064a">
   However, before too long, Tubbo's ideals of peace started seeming rather detrimental to the country's safety. He disbanded the military that L'Manberg formerly had, prohibiting any type of armor in the Capitol while not enforcing the ban of weapons. Tubbo also created the MAD policy, or Mutually Assured Destruction. He made it so that destructive items such as flint and steel, lava, TNT, and end crystals were not to be used within Capitol grounds.

   Tubbo, as president, continued his old antics. He griefed Fundy’s base with blocks along with Tommy and stole materials from some of his citizens. Philza criticized Tubbo for committing such crimes, even going as far as saying that he would side with Technoblade if Tubbo wouldn't become a good role model for the rest of the nation. Tubbo laid off a bit after that, but was once more lodged between a rock and a hard place when Tommy burned down GeorgeNotFound’s house as a “harmless” prank. Since George was the king of the

Dream only told him that he wanted an official meeting with his main council, and so Tubbo quickly gathered Tommy, Quackity, and Fundy together.
  </p>
  <p key="5d76c717-c04e-47f4-8069-663bec9010ee">
   Dream pinned the blame on Tommy, calling him out for griefing George’s house as well as accusing him of several other crimes that he had not taken part in. He threatened to build his walls up to the block limit and enclose the whole nation if Tommy was not brought to justice. Anxious to satisfy him, Tubbo held a trial for Tommy in which he was found guilty and non-canonically executed, but Dream insisted that it was not enough. He reiterated his threat, this time stating that if Tommy was not exiled within three days, he would follow through. Tommy attempted to regain the advantage by using Spirit's remains as a bargaining chip, but it only served to anger Dream further, and he yelled that he'd lost attachment for everything except the discs, as those were what gave him control. After Dream had gone, Tubbo was angry with Tommy, and the two of them broke into a bitter argument over what their next course of action ought to be. Tommy later attempted to make it up to him with a gift of several potions (made with help from Ghostbur, Sapnap, and
   ConnorEatsPants
   ), but Tubbo was not keen on making amends until the verdict had been decided.

  <p key="3a91cff5-13fc-440b-91eb-9e4075bc9ed8">
   On the day of the exile, Tubbo was still uncertain of his decision, torn between his morals and loyalty, and he looked to his cabinet for advice. They wanted nothing to do with the responsibility of the choice, though, and only told him that it was his to make. When Tommy logged on, he started talking about a plan to fight Dream rather than submitting to him, insisting that they could bring Techno to their side by convincing him that Dream was a bigger threat than they were, and that when it was all over, they would betray Techno. Quackity and Fundy seemed to follow through, and anticipated Tubbo to agree. Outwardly, he acknowledged that it could work, and reluctantly accepted an apology from Tommy.
  </p>
  <p key="1cd85336-57d3-4ecf-8b00-fa9d73e6f674">
   When they met again with Dream at the wall, however, Tubbo second-guessed himself again, and in the heat of the moment, decided that it would be best for the nation if Tommy were exiled. Quackity and Fundy, both enraged, demanded an explanation, and Tubbo snapped back at them for undermining his leadership. Tommy, feeling upset and betrayed, protested that he was Tubbo’s best friend, but Tubbo only responded by asking Dream to escort Tommy out of his country. Once Tommy had gone, Tubbo defended his choice, insisting that it had been for the good of the country. His cabinet was upset with him, however, and he only really got empathy from
   <a href="RanbooSMP.html" key="79b751b2-4e5b-480b-a263-0ed4b744b5e0" title="Ranboo/SMP">
    Ranboo
   </a>
   . Tubbo told Ranboo that he hadn’t wanted any of this to happen and made him an honorary member of the cabinet as his minutes man. Ranboo also confessed that he had taken part in the burning of George’s house, but that he respected Tommy for not having condemned him to a similar punishment. Tubbo later admitted regretting the exile and called it a stupid decision, saying that he missed Tommy.
  </p>
  <p key="334ad599-3977-4901-abb8-5debfc8170e3">
   Dream was happy with Tubbo's decision, however, and held up his end of the deal. The obsidian walls were removed over the course of a few days. Dream recognized L'Manberg as a country and allowed Tubbo to draft up his own borders. They seemed to be getting along more easily and even played a game of chess together (which Tubbo lost). He hesitantly brought up the prospect of visitation rights for Tommy, at least around the holidays, but Dream was skeptical of this and Tubbo eventually backed down.
  </p>
  <p key="58b1ad31-9569-4a14-b49a-d00b47596e1e">
   A few days into
   Tommy's exile
   , Tubbo met up with Ghostbur, who showed him
   Logstedshire
   and Tommy's tent. Tubbo admitted that he already regretted having exiled Tommy. He still believed Tommy was a liability to the nation, but he missed him. Ghostbur, still under the impression that the exile was like a vacation, told him that the longer Tommy stayed away, the better their reunion would be. After returning to L'Manberg, Ghostbur gave him a
   compass
   pointing to Tommy's tent named "Your Tommy," matching Tommy's "Your Tubbo" compass. Afterwards, Tubbo frequently held it in his off hand, and later told Ranboo that he planned on keeping it on him at all times. He also referred to the compass as his most valuable possession on the server.
  </p>
  <p key="d0d4ec91-ae74-4770-a553-3b90b8c99da6">
   Shortly after this, Quackity pulled the cabinet into a meeting and demanded that they go and hunt down Technoblade from his retirement to make him pay for his warcrimes the month before. While Tubbo had doubts, he did not voice them and instead went along with Quackity's plan. He, Quackity, Fundy, and Ranboo then formed "the
   Butcher Army
   " and set a date for their vengeance.
  </p>
  <p key="bf4598bd-7a56-4a47-bbdc-9e74f03389e9">
   As a side-plot, Tubbo was marginally involved in the arc of
   <a href="El Rapids.html" key="f8e2d40d-266b-4c0b-a291-932bde58c502" title="El Rapids">
    El Rapids
   </a>
   . When Quackity formed “Mexican L’Manberg” and declared it as its own nation, Tubbo pointed out that it was still technically a part of L’Manberg, and that as the president, he wanted some percentage of involvement in its affairs. Quackity eventually agreed to let him be the Secretary of State since it was a field he had experience in.

  <p key="0e468184-5619-4c8a-a6fb-8bcf4491eebb">
   In a separate stream, Tubbo watched Tommy in his exile and fled each time someone noticed him. He was holding the compass that Ghostbur had given him. However, this was later proven to be a hallucination by Tommy when Tubbo stated out-of-canon that he had never visited Tommy and hadn't seen him since he had been exiled.
   The compass was later destroyed by a charged creeper, much to Tubbo's dismay - and seemingly to Dream's delight, as he told Tommy that Tubbo had voluntarily destroyed the compass in order to drive them further apart.
  </p>
  <p key="02d3a07b-02ad-46df-88bd-6803f7ece1af">
   The Butcher Army decided to take action on December 16, 2020.
   Tubbo and the others sacked Philza's house and stole the compass that Techno had given him. Tubbo put Phil under house arrest for refusing to tell them Techno’s location. They followed the compass to
   Techno's cabin
   in a distant snow biome and ended up taking Technoblade as their prisoner under the threat that if he didn't listen to their demands, his horse,
   Carl
   , would be killed by Quackity. Although they told Techno that he would have a fair trial, it was quickly revealed that there was no trial and they simply intended to kill him through any means necessary. They put bars around him and prepared to drop on anvil on top of him, but before they could, Punz and Dream interfered. The execution ultimately failed, leading not only to Techno’s escape but to a second canon death for Quackity.

   In the aftermath, Tubbo finally decided that he wanted to visit Tommy.
   He took the path through the Nether and exited into Logstedshire only to find it demolished. In shock, he looked through the remains and discovered an exceedingly high pillar. Connecting the strings between his observations and what Ranboo and Ghostbur had told him about how unhappy Tommy was, Tubbo came to the conclusion that Tommy had committed suicide from jumping off the pillar. Speechless, he only said, "surely not” before the screen turned completely dark. Shortly after, he tweeted that Tommy should have a funeral.
   While there was never an official funeral held, Tommy did get a grave built for him outside of central L’Manberg next to Wilbur's.

   Prior to Christmas, Tubbo and Ranboo built a bee dome while listening to holiday songs in central L'Manberg. They kept flowers and grass inside as well as several bees, as Tubbo had stated earlier on that he missed keeping bees as pets. On his birthday, Tubbo was gifted another pet bee by Fundy and Puffy, named BeeInnit as a mock replacement of Tommy. Tubbo put it on a lead and jokingly said it was just like having him back before leaving BeeInnit at Philza’s house.

   On Christmas, December 25, during a non-canon, non-lore stream, Tubbo and Tommy worked together to do some mining and to do a Q&amp;A with their stream chats.

   Soon after, Tubbo and Dream were attempting to move Niki’s pet Fox, Mushroom, from Pogtopia to L’Manberg, but it accidentally died of fall damage while being led by Tubbo. Not wishing to be held responsible, Tubbo told Niki that the fox died of a stroke, but Niki soon found out the truth causing her to get upset with Tubbo. Punz, knowing that he felt bad about it, gifted him a fox of his own which Tubbo named Squeeks. This led to a brief

   in which Sapnap chased Tubbo around and tried to kill Squeeks, but it was eventually resolved with help from Niki, Punz, and Dream, and Squeeks was left near the L’Manberg embassy.
  </p>
  <p key="a3eedbc7-1ce4-4fdc-8a48-7d03abb2f430">
   Later on during the same stream, Fundy and Niki approached Tubbo and told him that they no longer wanted to be a part of L’Manberg. Tubbo was sorry to see them go, but he understood why they were leaving and wished them luck, helping them come up with a name for their new settlement:
   Dry Waters
   . Fundy ended up forgetting where he’d established the nation, though, so he returned to L'Manberg, however Nihachu still left and moved into a secret base Tubbo didn't know about.

   On December 28, MrBeast hosted another event on the server - this time a hunt for $100k in gift cards. In another non-canon stream, Tubbo searched for it, mostly with Tommy, Wilbur, Philza, and, for a short time,

   After their failed attempt at executing Techno, Tubbo and his cabinet constructed a plan to kill Dream, as Quackity had pinned him as their next largest threat. Tubbo, taking inspiration from Schlatt, came up with the idea of having a festival which they would say was to celebrate their friendship with Dream, but was in actuality a plot to kill him. He and Ranboo covered most of the decorating, and when questioned about Techno and Tommy, Tubbo only said that they ought to focus on one thing at a time.
  </p>
  <p key="4befa7f7-1430-42dc-81ff-74a06b1502a0">
   On January 5, the festival took place. Tubbo expressed his doubts and fears to Ranboo before the festivities began, saying that it felt like history was repeating itself, and asked for Ranboo's opinion on whether or not they were making the right decision. Ranboo said he thought they were in the right before Fundy joined the call.
  </p>
  <p key="0b06a26c-5c43-4ee7-b081-77762c844bc5">
   The cabinet held a meeting to discuss what was going to happen, and Quackity told Tubbo that he wanted
   <i key="6dabd63a-2eb6-426a-bf7f-df7a4729cabf">
    him
   </i>
   to be the one to kill Dream. Tubbo accepted the challenge and told Quackity that if he failed to do it, L'Manberg would belong to him. Tubbo gave a brief speech that heralded the start of the festival, and they all played games that Ranboo and Fundy made. While everyone else was having fun, Tubbo and Quackity spoke to each other about Dream's answers and wondered if he would actually show up. After a while, Dream messaged Tubbo and told him that he would be late.

  <p key="3901b2fd-d478-44d4-a2f4-d9b559eef012">
   When Dream arrived, the cabinet saw him building obsidian walls around the nation again. Distressed, they approached and asked why, and Dream only told them that Tommy had fucked up. He then led them to the remains of the newly-griefed

    Community House

   , claiming that Tommy was responsible for the destruction. In utter disbelief, Tubbo asked how L'Manberg was associated with it, and Dream replied that as long as Tubbo had Mellohi, they would be affiliated. Tubbo tried to reason with Dream, but he demanded Tubbo hand over the disc or else he’d build up the walls; and once again, Tubbo immediately folded to the threat and prepared to give the disc away. Before he could, though, Tommy — having been watching with an invisibility potion — intervened along with Technoblade. Tommy angrily asserted that he wasn't behind the demolition of the Community House, and told Tubbo not to give Dream the disc. In response, Tubbo only snapped that Tommy had proven many times over that he couldn’t be trusted. Tommy then called Tubbo a "shit friend," and Tubbo took Mellohi out of his Ender Chest in preparation to give it up. Tommy told Tubbo that he was the one who had betrayed him, and Tubbo, switching to his axe, fired back that Tommy had betrayed everything they had built first. The two former friends started fighting in the middle of the crowd, and everyone else made space for them to settle it and come to a decision.

  <p key="3da896cc-d497-4b14-8dc0-a2a22042d995">
   Their fight only lasted a minute, however, and abruptly came to a stop when Tommy yelled,
   <i key="e9c9a3e0-a34b-48ee-a497-b55cc2c7eaa4">
    "the discs were worth more than you ever were!"
   </i>
   After that sentence, they both froze as the weight of the words sank in. Tommy instantly regretted it, and to prove that he hadn’t meant it, he asked Tubbo to give Dream the disc. Tubbo did so. Technoblade told Tommy that they could still get out of there together, but Tommy, realizing that he was pursuing a path he'd never intended to follow, replied that he was on Tubbo's side and turned on Technoblade.

   Dream proceeded to mock Tubbo on his choice, calling him a buffoon, an idiot, a fool and a terrible president. He called Tubbo out for being stepped on and shoved around by everybody, and for being inconclusive, and for giving Dream the one thing he needed to destroy L'Manberg. In the middle of the mockery, Dream also exposed Ranboo as a traitor, revealing Ranboo's memory book which included his visits to Techno's cabin. Tubbo, shocked and defeated, agreed that he was a horrible president, worse than both Wilbur and Schlatt.
  </p>
  <p key="7a3eae3e-108a-4555-9e38-dcb27b9d350f">
   Dream then asked Techno if he wished to team up to destroy L'Manberg, and Techno readily accepted. They gave Tubbo twenty-four hours until his country's death and then left, leaving the L’Manbergians with a single day to prepare and come to terms with what was to happen.

   After Dream and Techno had gone, Tubbo immediately pardoned Tommy and lifted his exile, even allowing him to take charge despite suspecting him of terrorist attacks. They made chests that they were to fill up with supplies and gear to prepare for the war. A few people criticized their actions: many people felt as though defending against Techno and Dream, two incredibly powerful military fighters, was hopeless regardless of their numbers; many others hated Tommy and felt insulted that Tubbo let him come back after he had caused so much trouble. After addressing the immediate concerns, Tubbo approached Tommy outside of his home and tried to speak with him in private for a moment, but each struggled to find the right words to say. Tommy said that he couldn't do it right then and that they would exchange words the following day. Tubbo hesitantly backed off, agreeing to give him space for the time being.
  </p>
  <p key="973743a6-e861-41f1-807e-b08a16d51de9">
   Despite setting up war chests, Tubbo chose not to do any preparations of his own, instead greedily hoarding his stash of enough diamonds to equip everyone and eight netherite ingots to himself. Additionally, Jack Manifold gave Tubbo five netherite scraps, which Tubbo immediately stuffed into his Ender Chest for his own personal gain. In spite of his words, he did not have much faith in their chances, and since he was on his last life, he was primarily focused on keeping himself alive.

  <p key="de0cd999-bbbf-41a4-8b7c-d53b5167db8d">
   In private, Quackity told Tubbo that he wanted to execute Ranboo for being a traitor. In response, Tubbo lost his temper at Quackity, and pointed out that this

    was
   </i>
   history repeating itself
   , remembering the steps leading up to his own death at the Manberg Festival. Quackity then told him that the nation required order and asked Tubbo to think about what Dream had said to him; if Quackity had his way, the nation would enter an age of "law and order." Quackity threatened to leave L'Manberg for good, arguing that he couldn't commit treason if he was out of L'Manberg. Tubbo knew it to be a bluff, however. They wished each other good luck with preparations and returned to the others.
  </p>
  <p key="53b11adc-9604-4094-b0be-2ff854c11268">
   Tubbo joined back to the others arguing over whether they should bother to fight. After the debate had concluded without any clear victor, he gave a speech, saying that he was glad to see everyone working together and that it meant a lot for him to see everyone stand side by side despite their differences in stance. Unfortunately, his reassurance did nothing to calm those who doubted him, and many later would leave the defense. He then said that he assumed everyone knew their role, but then left without offering any clarification; many of the defenders, left without a clear direction, left soon after him, leaving their war chests empty.

  <p key="cdab531c-a0dd-4c81-9366-12d3b90171f5">
   On the day of the war, Tubbo logged on to find a supply room sabotaged by Fundy, a greatly diminished army, and no concrete plans for defense. He was upset but not surprised, and shared another tense moment with Tommy at their bench in which they awkwardly reconciled and agreed to just do their best and keep each other safe, as both only had one life left to lose.

   January 6, 2021, was the day of the Doomsday War.
   When Technoblade, Dream, and Philza arrived half an hour before they had said they would, Tubbo was not at all prepared and did not have time to prepare his defenders for war. He was still making preparations when Tommy contacted him in a panic, claiming that the attackers were already beginning the destruction. When Tubbo and several others rushed to the scene, they found Techno surrounded by the
   Hound Army
   . Failing to recognize the implications, Tubbo fired a shot at Techno before his troops were ready; because of this, the war dogs quickly overwhelmed the defenders and Techno was able to non-canonically kill them all before they had a chance to push back.
  </p>
  <p key="475951e0-5b86-46b3-bacd-fbf116512a02">
   Tubbo spent much of the remainder of the war in a state of constant fear, and failed to effectively deal with any of the threats the Anarchists put forth. Tommy took charge for most of the fighting, rounding everyone up into the Camarvan and coming up with battle tactics on the fly, and Tubbo once more fell back into the role of a follower. In the middle of the chaos, Techno was able to back Tommy into a corner and started arguing with him over his betrayal the day before. In rage, he fired a missile from his rocket launcher at Tommy. In an effort to protect him, Tubbo tried to jump in front of it, but the explosion ended up non-canonically killing both of them anyways.
  </p>
  <p key="82b627e9-60d0-4639-9ff0-032a34780462">
   Not long afterwards, Niki, having turned on her former home, burned down their last symbol of hope: the L'Mantree. As Dream finished rigging up his TNT machines and the bombs fell, Tubbo stopped trying to fight the Withers and instead found a high perch, staring at the destruction with the knowledge that he had failed his country for the last time. Tommy joined him and apologized again for all of the mistakes he’d made, and Tubbo only answered with a simple and bleak, “it’s okay.” Ghostbur and Quackity found them as well, and the four sang the
   L’Manberg national anthem
   for the final time as the nation crumbled in front of them, although they couldn’t remember all of the words.

   In the wake of the desolation, seeing L'Manberg as unrecoverable, Tubbo decided to turn away from his failed country to build a village and escape his past. On January 7, 2021, he moved to a snow biome where he built a home and planned other creations, naming the settlement
   <a href="Snowchester.html" key="00b4a6db-fbcf-4a0f-9d4f-5e5aceee7989" title="Snowchester">

   He was discovered by Tommy, who complimented it, but urged Tubbo to come back to his home and move in with him.
   Tubbo agreed to temporarily do so, but still remained in Snowchester for the most part.
  </p>
  <p key="57ac084b-3d6a-4e9f-b84e-60fdd507cc01">
   Then, looking for citizens, Tubbo invited Jack Manifold to come live with him in Snowchester. Although Jack at first refused, Tubbo persisted, and managed to convince him by sharing the fact that he and Tommy were planning to kill Dream. Unbeknownst to Tubbo, however, Jack was allied with Niki in order to kill Tommy, seeing him as a danger to the server that was getting away with all of his offenses unpunished.
  </p>
  <p key="f373f73d-0cb6-4e07-b972-07552435062c">
   Tubbo also invited Ranboo to come and see him, and decided to try and help Ranboo regain some of his memories, claiming to be a witch doctor.
   When Ranboo asked why Tubbo was helping him, reminding him that he had betrayed L’Manberg, Tubbo only replied that he liked to think he had a forgiving personality. Various tricks were tried, but no results came through. Tubbo eventually gave it up and turned his attention to building another tunnel from Snowchester to Tommy’s home.
  </p>
  <p key="6b8d4abe-8e40-4404-9523-d8f2fde7b98d">
   Ranboo also told Tubbo that he had saved Squeeks before Doomsday, and Tubbo happily made an attempt to bring Squeeks to Snowchester— but as with Mushroom, Squeeks died along the way. Tubbo was saddened by the loss, and soon after returning to Snowchester, he leashed up an arctic fox as a replacement.

  <p key="60417d69-79c5-48fe-9b07-05370e14873f">
   On January 16, 2021, Tommy met up with him and revealed that his home — or their shared home, really — had been burned down by Dream and a threatening sign had been left stating that Tommy and Tubbo would have to meet him alone on January 20 or else he would burn Tommy’s discs.
   A compass had been left labeled

   Tubbo started "
   Project Dream Catcher
   " with Jack Manifold on January 17 and 19, 2021.
   He said that he wished to replicate the
   Manhattan Project
   , in which the U.S. studied and created nuclear weapons to bomb Japan during WW2. The following bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to the end of the war. Tubbo stated that Snowchester was only a cover for this project.
  </p>
  <p key="b6206855-c928-4cf8-a7f5-b78124c0ce8f">
   Note that, in the real Manhattan Project, the atomic bombs may have ended the war, but they led to rapid escalation and the threat of mutually assured destruction in the Cold War. In the real Project, there were multiple keycards that had to be used simultaneously so to minimize the chances of a few errant individuals causing armageddon; in Tubbo's version, in which any keycard holder can activate the nukes by themselves, this chance is maximized.
  </p>
  <p key="fa7a03d2-b3b6-4aad-b0db-c06852cc05e8">
   Tubbo built the nukes with help from Jack Manifold through the use of a texture pack that modified in-game sticks. He intended to use the nukes against Dream, hence the name of the operation, but after the Disc Confrontation, that plan was made void. Tubbo kept the nukes in their vault, however, believing that he would find other uses for them, or that they could at least serve as a good defense for Snowchester.

   On January 20, 2021, Tubbo and Tommy set off to confront Dream, using the compass as a guide.
   They first bid their farewells to most of the other players on the server while walking along the Prime Path, fully aware that they were likely to never come back from their journey.

  <p key="ae00d41f-6b3b-4dcf-974c-babc84133af4">
   After a lot of walking and a long boat ride, they arrived at their destination and met Dream on top of a mountain where they immediately began to fight it out. Dream built an obsidian tower and placed a jukebox at the top, playing Mellohi in a way of taunting them. Tubbo occupied Dream while Tommy was seemingly able to make it up the tower take back Mellohi, but Dream then made it clear that he had been using only a fraction of his strength and easily beat Tubbo down to half a heart. He then told Tommy to give him the disc back or he would kill Tubbo. Tubbo insisted that he was willing to make the sacrifice, and told Tommy to just take the disc and run, but Tommy didn’t listen and gave it back to Dream in exchange for Tubbo’s life - only for it to be revealed that the disc had been a fake replica anyways, and that Dream had only been toying with them. In his own words, "playing with [his] food." He mocked them for their stupidity and weakness, then forced them to dispose of their items in typical pit fashion. Left without a choice, they followed him down a waterfall and into
   Dream's vault
   .

   Dream led Tommy and Tubbo through the corridors while explaining that it had always been about control, and that he was collecting valuable items on the server to hold leverage over everybody. He stated that while he would not kill Tommy, as he was important for keeping the server active, Tubbo was expendable - and so now that he had served his use (to make Tommy stop fighting long enough to trap him in the prison), he would have to die. He gave Tubbo and Tommy a chance to say their goodbyes, and despite Tommy's protests, Tubbo came to terms with his fate, saying that he had been described as a pawn and that this was checkmate, and bid Tommy farewell.

Tommy and Tubbo were able to run behind them, but once seeing that Dream was powerless, Tubbo watched as Tommy took Dream's items and killed him twice. He was then trapped in his own prison by Sam and Sapnap, and his armor - the Nightmare set - was given to Tubbo.

   They retrieved Tommy's discs, which had been in picture frames in plain view, and returned straight away to their bench spot outside of Tommy's home. They played Mellohi and spoke with what was presumably Wilbur's spirit (outside of Ghostbur) for some time, celebrating their victory before parting ways. Tubbo went back to Snowchester afterwards and hung Dream's armor up in the vault, stating that he had no desire to see it worn again. He then exchanged words with Quackity and Jack Manifold, with whom he expressed that he was glad not to have needed the nuclear weapons, but he wished to keep them just in case Snowchester or its inhabitants were threatened.

Tommy was immune to the Egg's effects and warned Tubbo of its potential danger. Upon entering, he was wary at first and did not want to make contact with the Vines, but as soon as he came close to the Egg, he inexplicably removed the Hazmat suit and touched it, seemingly just out of sheer curiosity. After a couple of seconds he started crying, saying that the Egg was saying terrible things to him that he refused to repeat.

   Before the pair could leave, they were confronted by Bad and Antfrost, who were both very much under the Egg's influence. They attempted to trap Tommy and Tubbo near the Egg with obsidian, and Tommy, still being unaffected by it, opted to allow himself to be caught in order to give Tubbo time to escape. Before it could escalate much further, however, Sam arrived and helped them hold off Ant and Bad. They briefly returned to Church Prime and then to the site of the hotel. Tubbo hadn't been taken over or heavily swayed by the Egg like most others, and he afterwards said himself that he didn't hate it, but he had an overall negative reaction to it. He later told Ranboo that it had shown him "many images of dead families" and mentioned to his stream that he wanted to use a nuke on it.

   Tubbo starts to suspect Foolish, as he lives in a desert where there is a lot of sand and he could've gathered them. But, when visiting the outside of the prison earlier, he saw some sand being misplaced or didn't look natural like someone had shoveled them in a hurry to craft TNT.

   After Tubbo finished the investigation, he placed his book on the lectern and noted that fast food restaurants, namely McPuffy's, had started appearing after Tommy was locked with Dream. He then visited the Egg after shooting a flame arrow at the McPuffy's building. The Egg gave no response. After this, he did not continue the investigation.

   On March 26, 2021, Tubbo decided that the nuclear weapons he and Jack Manifold had been keeping in Snowchester as part of Project Dreamcatcher should be moved to a location outside of Snowchester to protect the things he loved there.
   Jack and Tubbo began to build a silo outside of Snowchester, but as they were about to move the nukes to their new location, they discovered that the nukes had vanished, presumably stolen by an unknown entity. Tubbo then revealed that the nukes had a built-in detonation switch, and that this meant somebody now had the ability to detonate a nuclear weapon without requiring the keycards. However, this switch would also kill the person setting the bomb off, making it effectively a built-in suicide switch.

   On June 1, 2021, Tubbo began investigating
   <a href="Las Nevadas (country).html" key="83666bbe-1bd4-49b6-8943-ef39746d0f10" title="Las Nevadas (country)">

   safe.
   He named this plan "Operation Cookies," as he was disguising the outpost as a cookie shop. While constructing the outpost, Tubbo met
   Foolish
   , who told Tubbo he was leaving Snowchester, saying it was a "change of pace" for him. Tubbo continued to work on the outpost over the next couple of days, expanding it to include walls and an armoury.
   Ranboo also helped him work on it, decorating the inside and building farms for wheat and cocoa beans to make the cookies they were allegedly selling there.
  </p>
  <p key="727f733e-2cb4-4501-ad50-2c866477dd79">
   On June 9, 2021, Quackity, Fundy, and

   raided and griefed Tubbo's outpost, and Quackity placed a threatening note. However, Ranboo removed this and instead placed signs warning that griefers would be punished with violence.
  </p>
  <p key="2a8bed24-a0af-47b2-8252-1cf1a04ce84f">
   On June 18, 2021, Quackity, accompanied by Foolish,

    Purpled
   </a>
   and Fundy, confronted Tubbo and Ranboo about the outpost.
   After a private conversation between Tubbo and Quackity, during which Tubbo admitted that he didn't want to take down the walls because he had "noticed a pattern of his builds being destroyed" and wanted to protect the outpost.
   Quackity, meanwhile, wanted him to take the walls down because he personally had bad associations with walls, a reference to his time in the Manberg cabinet.
  </p>
  <p key="27c84f88-4966-4942-bf12-12b295dfe5a6">
   They returned to the rest of the group, and continued to argue. Quackity felt threatened by the outpost and demanded that the walls be taken down, but Tubbo argued that the outpost was outside of Las Nevadas territory, so Quackity had no right to ask this of them. Quackity also began to build his own wall around the outpost, and said that he would take his wall down if Tubbo took down his own. Ranboo also acted defensive of the outpost, saying that they hadn't been violent towards others, and that they weren't threatening to Quackity as they were only selling cookies. However, Tubbo did call the outpost a "military outpost" when prompted by Quackity, and it was unclear whether Ranboo was aware that the outpost wasn't actually a cookie shop.
  </p>
  <p key="477f2893-3e08-46c9-b794-87785b10a063">
   Tubbo proposed using the nearby river as a territory marker, but Quackity refused, saying that he was going to cover the river and that he needed the space to expand Las Nevadas. Tubbo suggested he expand in the direction of Wilbur and Tommy's fort instead, but Quackity seemed hesitant to do so. He also refused to expand across the sea, as Eret's cobblestone pyramid was over the water and he didn't want to start conflict with them. He also suggested that the outpost be turned into a Snowchester embassy, but Tubbo refused.
  </p>
  <p key="72b5f194-6f96-430b-b333-c8df2cfc7329">
   The confrontation ended with Tubbo threatening Quackity with nuclear warfare.
   He then left, and he and Ranboo returned to the outpost. The two of them listened to the
   <i key="eb474ac6-53a7-425f-b01b-0671bb5cc65c">
    Mall
   </i>
   disc together, and talked about what had just happened.
   Ranboo said that he didn't hold anyone's actions during the L'Manberg era against them, and that Quackity was probably a good person. Tubbo recalled how Quackity had called for Technoblade's execution, and that despite Tubbo being the president, Quackity had served as the de-facto leader of the Butcher Army. He also told Ranboo about the fact that Quackity had wanted to execute Ranboo after the Green Festival, but Tubbo had talked him down.
   Tubbo then opened up to Ranboo about his death at the Manberg Festival,
   notably recalling the events wrongly and stating that Quackity had been pressuring Technoblade to perform the execution, despite the fact that in reality, Quackity had been strongly against the execution itself, and had been attempting to persuade Schlatt to call it off when he discovered the true nature of the plan.
  </p>
  <p key="8588e1a9-b83e-4805-8e61-6a042cf5ac6e">
   Tubbo suggested for Ranboo to write something in his memory book about something being off with Las Nevadas, and Ranboo asked Tubbo if they were doing the right thing. Tubbo said that depended on whose side they were on, and that he had done bad things and Ranboo had done bad things by accident. Ranboo asked Tubbo if that made him a bad person, but Tubbo said that it didn't. Tubbo told Ranboo that they would keep all of their valuables inside of Snowchester, and that they would only have conflicts in Las Nevadas and the outpost. He also said to expand the outpost all the way to the ocean, and Ranboo shared his doubts about this. Tubbo reassured him that this was only in case "all hell broke loose."
  </p>
  <p key="f8c5e33f-87f8-4a96-ac36-8a6f0dc8c3d3">
   Later that same day, he helped Tommy and Ranboo build a memorial for Ghostbur.
   He told Tommy about the outpost, but Tommy responded that he would rather stay with Wilbur at their fort.

   On the day of L'Manberg's independence, Tubbo arrived at L'Crater, singing the anthem. Wilbur, who had also been singing the anthem and Ranboo then arrived. Wilbur greeted Tubbo with joy, as he hadn't properly talked to him yet, and reassured him that - while he'd been very overwhelmed during his resurrection, he had since calmed down. In an attempt to continue his path to the future, Wilbur apologised to Tubbo for making him President, taking claim of the crater as a whole, and Tubbo forgave him.
  </p>
  <p key="fe7d7f82-c34b-4e90-b821-e6c82e52e06e">
   Tubbo proceeded to inform Wilbur that he hadn't created the crater they stood in front of, describing how Phil and Techno had worked with Dream to destroy the nation that Tubbo had tried to remake. Wilbur reacted incredulously at the information - not the action, but the reasoning - before reacting with positive surprise at the news that somebody had cared enough to rebuild his nation, thanking Tubbo for the action. He tried to invite Tubbo to the Paradise Burger establishment after he admitted that he felt aimless, but Tubbo declined, saying he didn't trust Wilbur yet.
  </p>
  <p key="f1c116e5-df11-409a-9f24-685969076af4">
   Confused, Wilbur attempted to ask why, but when Tubbo stood his ground, he instead complimented him and asked him simply to visit. When Tubbo decided to stay put, he accepted that too, instead leaving him with a rabbit's foot that Tommy had given him and leaving with Ranboo.

   A day later, on Wilbur's stream it was revealed that after the destruction of the Las Nevadas burger place at the hands of Wilbur and Ranboo, Quackity had hired Tubbo to serve as the manager and chef of the newly rebuilt Las Nevadas burger place.  Later on, Tubbo would go live and speak to Quackity.  He would say that although he didn't mean Walltown as a sign of aggression and he just wanted to keep a eye out, the day  of the Walltown conflict he "wasn't himself" and agreed to annex Walltown into Las Nevadas.  They talked about the restaurant, with Tubbo thanking Quackity for letting him work at it,  and Quackity told Tubbo that lots of plans were being made for Las Nevadas, that the country was moving forward in a good way. He told Tubbo that he trusted him, since they were both in the L'Manberg cabinet, creating a "Tubburger" advertisement.  Tubbo then went over to Paradise Burgers and spoke with Ranboo, with Tubbo telling Ranboo that he was shocked how much he trusted Wilbur, and Ranboo told him that he didn't completely trust Wilbur, but believes he must have changed, and Tubbo telling Ranboo he was the happiest had been in a while.  Tubbo told Ranboo about how he handed over the Cookie outpost to Las Nevadas, however Ranboo thought Tubbo handed complete ownership of the outpost to Quackity, saddening Ranboo, causing him to make a excuse to run out of the van,  bewildering Tubbo.

   On the 28th of November 2021, Sam approached Ranboo and arrested him under strange conditions. It later turned out Sam had told Ranboo that he had Michael, This meant that Ranboo felt forced to cooperate. Technoblade had been working on rescueing Dream already and during a stakeout he saw Sam escorting Ranboo into the prison. Techno, Phil, and Niki staged a rescue, and Ranboo lost his final life. But right before losing his final life, Ranboo gave an photo to Techno that turned out to be Michael in front of a portrait of Ranboo and Tubbo.
  </p>
  <p key="6bc137da-bfcf-4b74-bb61-e0e6a5b788dc">
   Looking for answers Phil and Niki were hesitant to give, Techno decided to visit Tubbo in the hopes of getting some clearer responses. They met up in Snowchester, where Tubbo first lied to Techno about their relationship and avoided the question of who Michael was, so Techno revealed that Ranboo had died and showed Tubbo the image. Tubbo was silent for a while and finally showed Techno Michael's bedroom. (Techno already knew of the bedroom because he'd snooped around upon arrival.) Tubbo then found out Michael was no longer in his bedroom. He then revealed that Michael was his and Ranboo's adopted son. Techno and Tubbo made a temporary alliance to try and find Michael and they found a sign by Eret saying that Michael was safe and that they needed to reach out to him, but Eret was unavailable at that time (Likely non-canon).

   A bit after, Karl invited Tubbo over to Kinoko, and he explained that he's been making an underground metro system including one that went to Snowchester from Kinoko. Tubbo clearly was uncomfortable with the idea, as he'd build Showchester as far away from anyone else on purpose, wanting to make it hard for people to bother him.

      MICHAEL is Tubbo's and Ranboo's adopted child. They found him on December 1st, while gathering materials for the meeting room, and put him in a hole promising to come back and save him later. They eventually rescued MICHAEL as a date on Valentine's day, but during the journey, the original chicken that MICHAEL was riding on burned in lava.

Ranboo and Tubbo declared MICHAEL as their adoptive son on February 23 after joking about being "canonically married." Tubbo later went on to say that MICHAEL was three years old, but it is unknown if this was supposed to be a joke or not.

      All events considered, Dream is Tubbo's worst enemy on the server. The two have had a complicated relationship in the past, however, had got along before fighting against each other in wars several times on quite a few occasions. While they were opponents during the early stages of the Disc Saga, and Dream had previously destroyed Tubbo's villager and iron golem farms, they seemed to be on overall fine terms before the

      , but afterward Dream feigned respect for Tubbo's leadership. While Dream was still an enemy of Tubbo due to his possession of Tommy's Cat disc, they were on neutral terms for a bit of time.

       When Tommy griefed George's house, Dream wrapped L'Manberg in obsidian walls and pushed for him to be exiled. Tubbo tried to find a less severe punishment, but Tommy's attempt to force Dream to take down the walls with no punishment caused Dream to threaten Tubbo with building the walls up to the block limit. Tubbo ultimately made the decision to exile Tommy, choosing his fear of Dream over his sense of kinship with Tommy, which greatly pleased Dream and boosted the two of them into an

       positive relation. However, Tubbo deeply regretted exiling Tommy,  which put him at odds with Dream's goals. They outwardly acted cordial to one another, as Dream wanted Tubbo to believe that L'Manberg was better without Tommy, and Tubbo wanted Dream to believe that he had no reason to see L'Manberg as a threat. Dream praised his leadership and finally claimed to respect L'Manberg as a country, although in reality, he was only satisfied with Tubbo's presidency because he was easy to push around.

       After Dream helped Technoblade escape from his execution on December 16, Tubbo was angered and made plans to organize a festival similar to the

       ." The Green Festival would seemingly be to celebrate their friendship, but Tubbo and his cabinet were secretly plotting to assassinate Dream at the event, recognizing him as a tyrant and wanting to take him out before he could do any further harm to them. Tubbo decided that he himself ought to be the one to kill Dream, although he was not overly confident in his ability to do so. Dream arrived late to the festival, however, and began rebuilding the walls around L'Manberg. When asked why, he led everyone to the remains of the

       , blaming the damages on Tommy. He demanded Mellohi from Tubbo, insisting that as long as he had the disc, L'Manberg would be a thorn in his side. Once he'd gotten the disc, he viciously ridiculed Tubbo, calling him an idiot and a pushover and stating he was the worst president L'Manberg ever had - worse than Wilbur and worse than Schlatt, claiming that he'd just given him all of the power he needed to have complete control over L'Manberg.

       , Dream nearly killed Tubbo multiple times and used his life as leverage over Tommy. Tubbo was delighted to see him taken down and refuses to wear his set of armor, despite it having been given to him. Unlike Tommy, he seemingly has no desire whatsoever to see Dream in prison. Upon finding out that Dream had killed Tommy, Tubbo asked if they could kill Dream for it despite still being in denial of Tommy's death.

      Tubbo and Eret were good friends during the initial war for L'Manberg's independence, but after Eret's betrayal, Tubbo was rather scared of them for quite some time. Once the conflict had died down, however, Tubbo was willing to give them another chance and they became friends again. Their bond strengthened once Schlatt took over Manberg, as they both opposed him, and they incorporated Niki into their trio. Nicknamed "TEN" (Tubbo, Eret, Niki), they spent a decent amount of time together plotting against Schlatt. Tubbo and Eret fought together during the

      The next day, Quackity killed Schlatt and left to join Pogtopia,

       They also discussed plans to rebuild the Camarvan once they had won back L'Manberg,

       on January 5, 2021, Quackity gave Tubbo a pep talk, since Tubbo had been decided to be the one to execute Dream.
       Tubbo stated in return that if he were to fail, "everything would be Quackity's call" from then on,
       effectively making him the new president. However, this never happened, since Dream was never executed and the Festival instead turned into a fight at the destroyed Community House. During this fight, it was revealed by Dream that Ranboo had been disloyal to L'Manberg,
       which prompted Quackity to later suggest to Tubbo that they should execute Ranboo, as Quackity wanted to protect Tubbo from being betrayed and hurt. However, Tubbo reacted very negatively to this and immediately stood up for Ranboo, getting angry and shouting at Quackity, and comparing the idea to his own execution at the Red Festival. He stated that if Quackity tried to execute Ranboo, it would be treason.

       However, since Tubbo started building
       Walltown
       , his outpost near Las Nevadas, the relationship between the two became somewhat strained. Quackity griefed the outpost together with Fundy and Slimecicle, and on June 18, 2021, he and Tubbo had a disagreement that reached a point where neither of them was willing to back down, with Quackity wanting Tubbo to take down the walls of the outpost because he feels threatened by it,
       and Tubbo refusing to do so because he wants to protect the outpost, as his builds have a history of being destroyed.

      <p key="923139dc-cc25-433f-b344-350f577ed093">
       Quackity said to Tubbo during their discussion that he didn't have the time or energy for a conflict with him, and instead proposed that they work together.
       He also stated that he was only acting to protect his country.
       However, Tubbo refused to back down and instead ended up threatening Quackity with nuclear warfare
       and left, leaving their disagreement unresolved.

      <p key="962a6f78-64df-49f5-97ad-4cb7afde96b2">
       Tubbo also seemed to partially blame Quackity for his execution at the Manberg Festival, despite the fact that at the time, Quackity was actively trying to prevent the execution itself from happening.
      </p>
      <p key="d9baa52c-442a-4a2d-9c97-2ce8eab57d52">
       Despite this, Tubbo seemed to have no qualms about being hired to work for Las Nevadas's burger place on August 4, 2021, and agreed to allow Walltown's annexation into Las Nevadas land.
       With this, Tubbo and Quackity put the conflict behind them and agreed to start on a clean slate,
       though they are both still aware of and have spoken about their shared history as part of the L'Manberg cabinet.
       Additionally, in a later conversation with Ranboo, Tubbo appeared to have shifted the blame for his death at the Manberg Festival away from Quackity, or at least accepted that his death that day had been inevitable. He also seemed to admire Quackity for what he had achieved in building Las Nevadas.
       The two are now on good terms.

       Tubbo then gave Ranboo a tour of the server and was the first person he listened to

       After the festival, Ranboo was extremely upset, as he believed that their friendship had been ruined because Tubbo would know what he had been doing, as Dream had given him Ranboo's memory book. He referred to Tubbo as "the closest person he had" and said that he would never get the way Tubbo looked at him out of his head,
       further showing how important their relationship was to him. Ranboo even expected Tubbo to kill him. Noticeably, when Tubbo asked him where he was living a few days later, he left out the fact he was now residing with Technoblade and Philza, demonstrating the remaining lack of trust between them.

       Ranboo hesitantly agreed, but after the experiments failed, he expressed multiple times that he would never do any of Tubbo's tests again as he doesn't like being experimented on. Eventually, the two made up to a point where Ranboo stated in his book that he did consider Tubbo a good person, but did not trust him enough to tell him about his hallucinations of Dream.

       While constructing Snowchester in the following few months, Ranboo and Tubbo became closer friends. They decided to get "canonically married" on February 23, 2021,
       originally for tax benefits (since Eret had instated a tax on the server), but realized they were happy together and have stayed married since. They also decided that MICHAEL, the baby zombified piglin they found during Ranboo's original tour of the server, is their adopted son, and have committed to raising him together.

       They are both aware that they keep secrets from each other, such as Ranboo not telling Tubbo about his "experiments", and this does not negatively impact their relationship.
       Another example of this is the fact that Ranboo was not fully aware of the events of the Manberg Festival
       until Tubbo told him several months into their marriage.

       They have stated to Tommy that they "fell in love" after their marriage.
       They often joke about divorce and that Tubbo is only in the marriage for gold digging purposes, but they do have a very positive relationship. As with all people he cares about, Ranboo is very protective of Tubbo, and one of his main reasons for joining the Syndicate was to protect Tubbo and MICHAEL,
       and when his goal was to prevent conflict on the server, he cited that protecting people who did not deserve conflict, like Tubbo, was one of his motivators for wanting to do so.
       He also often gives Tubbo gifts,
       including while in (presumed) enderwalk,
       and on Tubbo's three-year anniversary of streaming on Twitch on May 15, 2021, the two of them then had a picnic in front of Tommy's house, prepared by Ranboo.

However, he does not seem to be aware that the outpost was originally built to spy on Las Nevadas, rather than to sell cookies; this is another secret that Tubbo has not told Ranboo about. Ranboo is generally very supportive of Tubbo, and will even stand up to others for him. An example for this is him defending Tubbo and the outpost towards Quackity on June 18, 2021.

       Ranboo seemed shocked and confused by this information, and when Tubbo mentioned the scars he had gotten from the Festival, Ranboo admitted that he hadn't wanted to bring them up,

       During his own presidency, Tubbo was often compared to Schlatt because of the decisions he made.
       These comparisons, combined with Tubbo's low self-esteem and harsh view of his own presidency, led him to also compare himself to Schlatt, and after the events of the

      , however, Technoblade took Tubbo's second canon life under Schlatt's orders, leading Tubbo to lose a lot of trust in him. He still forgave him, however, knowing that internal conflict would serve no purpose in helping them overthrow Schlatt in the long run. All the same, the assassination was a traumatic event for Tubbo, and likely contributed massively to his negative development.

       Tubbo showed subsequent concern about Techno's loyalty regarding his destruction of the detonation button. His faith in him was partially restored after the reveal of his bunker, and they fought with one another during the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, but their relationship quickly plummeted back to negative as soon as Tubbo was appointed president. He suffered another (non-canon) assassination at Techno's hands immediately afterwards, but in spite of that, and in spite of Technoblade releasing a pair of Withers on L'Manberg, Tubbo originally did not want to go to war with him and said that he had respect for Technoblade sticking to what he believes is right.

       Later, however, Tubbo began putting up Wanted posters for Techno all around L'Manberg, insisting that he still had to pay for his war crimes. When Quackity formed the "Butcher Army" with the goal to kill Technoblade, Tubbo joined with little hesitation. They hunted Technoblade down out of retirement and brought him back to L'Manberg for public execution, as both punishments for his crimes against the country and as revenge for Tubbo's own execution. Techno escaped, however, leaving any chance at good relations between the two of them essentially nonexistent.

       Tubbo didn't seem nearly as rattled by Wilbur's declining mental state as Tommy was, and instead handled it quite calmly; when Wilbur told him that he wanted to blow up Manberg, Tubbo responded casually and claimed that he agreed with the plan simply to avoid an argument, when in actuality he was hoping to help Tommy prevent the mass destruction.

He even mocked Tubbo, calling him the president of a crater, and Tubbo arrived back in L'Manberg shortly after his death. He never held a formal funeral for Wilbur, which he later claimed was because Ghostbur was still around, although this is made less convincing by the fact that he said to "let him rot" before Ghostbur had appeared on the server.
