   George is a human with beige skin, black eyes and brown hair. He wears a blue t-shirt that has a red rectangle (referencing the street brand "Supreme"), with a tiny white rectangle on it; jeans and white sunglasses, commonly referred to as "clout goggles". During his kingship, he sometimes wore a golden crown, with different colored gems engraved into it. During
   The Beach Episode

   George, though close with his friends, does not show much care to the happenings on the SMP, often sleeping through or ignoring important events on the server. He often followed his best friend Dream on the server, prior to George's dethronement. George seems to be able to move on quickly from his losses, and many members think he is naive and weak due to him not participating in most of the server's conflicts; he spends nearly all of his time dreaming, and it has been implied that he has a sort of derealization, where he conflates reality with dreams.

   's voice quickly replaced his conscious' voice, saying to George that if he had become the Vice President of L'Manberg, El Rapids would have never existed. George traveled to a field near his old house, and found Lore Woman, a mysterious figure with Lore Man. He saw Quackity, and he and George forgave each other for all the wrongdoings they had caused.

   After a few small fights, Lore Man stated that he and Lore Woman were George's true parents. George was then handed a sword by Lore Man, stating that he wanted George to kill him. In the dream, Lore Man stated that he had one canon life left, and George killed Lore Man in both real life and in his dream.

   George eventually woke up, and noticed that he was holding the same sword he had killed his father with. George's conscious then stated that he had to make his father proud, and George walked off into the sunset.

   The four of them traveled to the L'Manberg crater, and Mexican Dream was happy about it having been destroyed. They then went to Karl's old house, and burnt Quackity's room underneath it. Bad decided that they should blame this on the

  </p>
  <p key="d6abaa06-2e9a-463d-a00f-a377a2260239">
   DreamXD and George went around doing several "pranks" on Bad and Niki though George quickly noticed that DreamXD was not capable of telling what pranks were supposed to be, and kept taking it too far and intimidating them. Eventually, wanting to make George laugh, DreamXD dropped Niki out of the world into
   hell
   as another prank.

  <p key="11c5d2f7-d174-443f-83aa-1ca57a72a3df">
   George stated he was finally done with DreamXD, and ran away to his melon farm. DreamXD followed him and said he would give George anything to make him accept him, and George asked him for netherite armor. DreamXD gave it to him, and George said they were now friends forever.

  <p key="7fc50d5a-022a-425c-9d2f-c644f417ac2f">
   George met up with Quackity, and passed out. He woke up and checked to see if the armor he had gotten was real or not. He seemed to question reality, and passed out again.

   On August 28th
   , George happily met up with Karl on the Prime Path. George expressed excitement over having won MCC 16 despite not actually winning the event. Karl and George visited Master Oogway and tried to set him free by breaking the fence but they depart shortly after realizing the turtle did not wish to be free.
  </p>
  <p key="8688584d-79f0-428f-b105-50787de852fb">
   Karl then insisted he had to give something to George and brought them to Kinoko Kingdom in search of an ender chest. Upon realizing Kinoko Kingdom had no ender chests Karl took them back to the community house where Sapnap joined them.

  <p key="8484464c-2bf7-4ab7-8d79-72490f4d8561">
   Sapnap lead them to his base where they saw his dogs and he let them use his ender chest. Beckerson the fish momentarily fell on the ground with no water panicking George, Sapnap, and Karl but he was saved and placed back in Sapnap's ender chest. Karl sent Sapnap away so he could speak to George in private and returned Dream's shield to him much to George's shock and joy. Sapnap returned halting their conversation and they left his base for a moment. Karl asked George if he wanted to use the ender chest subtly suggesting to him he should put away Dream's shield and George went back and put the shield in the ender chest for safe keeping.
  </p>
  <p key="f22d094c-6d07-4f2f-a3ea-ed610d80c4a0">
   George and Karl then went to rob Punz of his belongings. Punz arrived and killed George for stealing from him. George broke down into sobs over losing a canon life. George, however, calmed down when he suddenly remembered he had six canon lives and is now down to five.
  </p>
  <p key="6a27a4e2-9c0d-45de-86c3-d7d1c0a4dc23">
   George and Karl were then joined by Badboyhalo and Antfrost. George stole some of Antfrost's weednip to try and make Antfrost and Bad agree to help furnish his and Karl's house in Kinoko Kingdom. George ran to the nether and threatened to jump in lava with the drugs if they wouldn't agree to help decorate because he doesn't care about losing another canon life since he has five remaining. They agreed to help furnish the house and Karl took the group back to Kinoko Kingdom to show off his and George's house that they wanted help with decorating. George then left the group and returned to his beds at spawn so he could go back to sleep.

   On October 21st
   , George arrived to where Tubbo was making a pumpkin farm and saw gambling with DreamXD occurring. George wanted to gamble as well but his items were of lesser value than Tubbo, Ranboo, Foolish, and Ponk's so he was unable to gamble for the high stake items they were. George's gamble was six diamond shovels for his own head making his bet 1 in 6 as opposed to the 50/50 others were betting against, George won his bet and received his own head. DreamXD then suggested George could gamble all the contents of his ender chest for a contraband item but George refused and would not say what he had in the ender chest.

  <p key="35b09eea-58f4-4c34-b7f6-6ecfa63b55be">
   George attempted to steal the items other people were winning or betting so DreamXD made him fall out of the world but George kept returning to cause trouble. DreamXD locked everyone but George into a bedrock box to complete a gamble with Foolish for the head of the ender dragon. After this DreamXD put George into a box with a viewing hole so he was unable to interfere with the proceedings. DreamXD proclaimed George the king of chaos during all of this as well.

   On October 22nd
   , George woke up from his sleep and realized he had no items on him. George then went to go find some items for himself and ran into Tommy and Awesamdude on the prime path. Tommy asked George what he was planning on doing to which George responded he wanted to spend the day looking for a trident to enchant. Immediately afterwords Tommy died in a trident accident and George used that as an opportunity to steal his trident and other belongings.
  </p>
  <p key="e252f637-b74f-4ccf-ad5c-b7b650705aae">
   George and Awesamdude met Tommy at his home where Punz also arrived to see what was going on. They took a visit to the balls to conduct business and Tommy placed tnt that Punz set off killing the fish living inside the balls and Tommy. George tridented away afterwords and told Tommy to meet him at the court of justice. George and Tommy debated over if George was in the wrong for stealing Tommy's things. Punz decided George was in the wrong and spleefed the blocks underneath him sending George to the ground causing him to die of fall damage and drop the stolen items. Punz also spleefed Tommy causing him to fall to his death.
  </p>
  <p key="0809fab4-186b-44fb-a4ac-7d5070c7b700">
   George ran from spawn back to his death location racing Tommy who wanted to collect his things. When George arrived he was unable to see Tommy, Punz, and Awesamdude. George assumed they had invisibility potions before they walked into his vision and then vanished again. Tommy tried assuring George everything was going to be okay but George was alarmed and frightened by their consistent disappearances from his vision. When George attempted to pick up the items on the ground he was unable to touch them.
  </p>
  <p key="a3a1af7f-e2ab-4d53-add4-c462375d568e">
   After that Tommy left the group and George enlisted Awesamdude and Punz's help in finding a trident. As they made their way to an ocean George stopped to stare at the entrance of Pandora's Vault before moving the group along. George and Awesamdude went out on a boat looking for drowneds with tridents or as they call them 'gurgerlers'. Punz went ahead in different areas using his trident to help them. After a period of time George was able to get a trident and Awesamdude took him to get it enchanted. George named his trident, 'Try Dent' and they returned to the main part of the server.
  </p>
  <p key="2102950e-a7d2-4118-b210-818e3d4a2423">
   George joined many members of the server in welcoming the new member, Eryn. As a greeting George non-canonically killed Eryn for the first time. George spent time with other members of the server before going to find Tommy at his request. George introduced himself as the king of the server still and gifted Eryn a glass block before departing.

   George spent the first part of his day cleaning the oceans with Sapnap
   . After the proceedings were done he messed around with other members of the server such as Jack Manifold, Eret, Punz, Foolish, Callahan, Connoreatspants, and Boomer. George once again experienced people disappearing from his field of vision with Foolish and Boomer. Foolish and Boomer led George to Snowchester where they met up again with Eret and Sapnap. George proceeded to kill Boomer, he and Sapnap attacked Foolish, and then George attacked Hannah who died trying to run and George stole her things. George used Hannah's diamond helmet and boots to repair his own diamond helmet and boots.

  <p key="1a1bd480-c75f-4a49-a3ca-dcacd4165bce">
   George then decided to go looking for
   Michael
   the zombie piglin baby. George ran around the mansion in Snowchester calling for Michael in a menacing way while Niki pleaded with him to stop. Sapnap found Michael in one of the side houses and George and Punz joined him there to threaten killing Michael. They kept trying to goad others into killing Micahel as well for example telling Foolish he can have his stuff back if he kills him. Sapnap gave Hannah a spruce plank and George told her to bludgeon Michael to death with it before swapping out for a raw pork chop saying it would be more ironic if she killed Michael with that. All the while Eret and Niki watched from the roof and Niki begged them not to hurt Michael. George threw an egg as Michael which made him hostile and Michael attacked George who had to flee because his armor had the thorns enchantment.

   They continued to play around with Michael who was angry and George and chased him outside much to the amusement of George and Sapnap but worry of Niki. Hannah and Eret were able to get Michael in a boat and push him back inside where George continued to throw eggs at Michael and look around in Tubbo and Ranboo's things. George, Sapnap, Hannah, and Punz left to come to an agreement over who would kill Michael. While they were gone Eret was able to take Michael to safety somewhere where George and the others could not find him. The group interested in killing Michael abandoned their plans and travelled back to the main SMP. Punz attacked George who retreated to the Holy Lands and tried to bait Punz into killing him. They entered Church Prime to ring the prime bell. George asked for Foolish, Punz, Hannah, and Bad to meet him at the community house where he suggested a game of them killing each other.

   George then continued hanging out with Hannah and Foolish. George practiced his bowing skills by firing at Hannah who was flying through the sky, hitting her successfully a few times.

      Dream and George are usually on good terms. They originally started the server together, and stuck by each other's side during events such as the L'Manberg Independence War. But as time flew by, they seemed to get more distant. Dream did show some hint of caring for George by threatening to exile Tommy because he burnt down George's mushroom house, but it's hinted that burning down George's house was just another reason to get Tommy exiled. However, Dream spontaneously dethroned George after he no longer remained neutral as Dream had instructed. George, along with Sapnap and Quackity, tried to regain kingship with a political protest against Dream's wishes. Later, their conflict was resolved with a deal, and George remained dethroned. However, this time, they left on seemingly neutral-negative terms. Dream expressed to
