  <p key="f340d58a-5bee-4d9a-92fa-711b4acf8ed4">
   Drista made her first appearance on the SMP on October 10, 2020, after Dream had mentioned that his mom had told him at the lunch table that she'd gotten a notification that Tommy was streaming.
   Dream then went on to explain that it was most likely his sister's doing, who was a fan of Tommy and was probably watching the stream at the moment. Tommy and Dream then began joking that Tommy's video about speaking to Dream's mom was his second most viewed video on his YouTube channel, and Dream offered to bring his younger sister on in a similar fashion.
  </p>
  <p key="077ea7d4-80a3-4b9c-b6fd-7c595fcbcb6e">
   Almost immediately after joining, Drista began to poke fun at Tommy in a friendly way, saying that he is a child, which he reiterated that she is too, as he was 16 while she was 14. She spent the majority of her visit with Tommy while Dream popped in in the background every once in a while. She played through Dream's character, and mainly spent her time playing and joking with Tommy.
  </p>
  <p key="f503229a-101b-48ab-91fb-6b03e606434b">
   Tommy had her help build his
   Disruption Hole

  <p key="ada54be4-d15c-498e-8764-e8e1fe2098cf">
   Eventually,
   Technoblade
   popped in for a moment to make his well known joke of joining the server, saying his own name and then leaving. Tommy pulled him into a call with them and claimed that Drista was the winner of a competition where the prize was to meet Techno. Drista pretended to be Techno's biggest fan, berating him in a similar joking manner as she had to Tommy.

  <p key="74d1eb13-6e5e-42ed-a95a-52308e509366">
   After the call with Techno, Tommy gave Drista a short tour of the server before the two continued work on their project. Drista then realized that she was technically the "owner" of the server and used her operator powers to kill Tommy. He then tried to trick her into giving him operator status, but she instead banned him temporarily before bringing him back. She then changed her own game mode to creative before Dream intervened and made her change it back to survival.
  </p>
  <p key="03448531-afbd-4b3f-a08a-3897c9811fb0">
   Dream also pretended to punch Drista, which she joked about that he did really punch her. It was later clarified as a joke, but ensured a good laugh.

  <p key="d3cfbfec-cf62-472f-bf17-1b89dfea19aa">
   Drista and Tommy then got into another argument where Drista told Tommy's twitch chat to get "#TommyInnitIsCancelled" trending while Tommy asked them to get "#DristaIsNotPog" trending. #TommyInnitIsCancelled ended up trending on Twitter for the duration of the stream along with the term "Drista." Drista then got into Dream's Twitter account and Tommy tried to convince her to post something, but Dream returned again to stop them.

  <p key="b4b5cb26-31bb-424f-859f-664b175b9593">
   Tommy and Drista then continued working on Intimidation Tower for a while until she decided to leave, and Tommy ended the stream.

   Drista made her return on December 14.
   When she met up with Tommy, she started messing with him by attempting to kill him with lava and going into Creative Mode. Tommy, who was
   canonically exiled
   , asked Drista to ask Dream if he could be let back in the SMP at least temporarily, and Drista accepted. After multiple attempts of trying to stab Dream with a fork, he said yes. However, they were stopped by
   Punz
   waiting outside the nether portal to the Dream SMP. Punz tried to kill Tommy before Drista stepped in and tried to hold him off, accidentally breaking the Nether portal. This made Tommy panic while he tried to get obsidian to get back into the nether. After the conflict, Tommy had to tell Punz that Dream had let him come back, to which Punz stated, "Tommy, you get 1 hour, MAX."
  </p>
  <p key="d49ac24d-f991-456d-9bef-095955340054">
   Tommy and Drista first came across Quackity through VC. Quackity stated he had a gift for Tommy, but Drista didn't seem to like this and said that she also wanted a gift. Before Quackity was physically there, he made a couple of inappropriate jokes. Tommy told Quackity off for the jokes, and Drista teleported Quackity to make it quicker. Upon being teleported, Quackity immediately stripped, and Tommy had to step in front of Drista telling her to look away. Drista killed Quackity three times shortly after, showing a bit of annoyance towards him.
  </p>
  <p key="bae6c706-f4b3-48eb-9f9d-289dfd5ad30e">
   After the meeting with Quackity, Tommy and Drista came across one of the butcher posters that Fundy made and expressed confusion at the picture. Tommy and Drista then started walking along the
   Prime Path
   before Drista started commenting about a spot on Tommy's shirt, describing it as "poo." Shortly after, Drista decided she wanted a dog. Tommy said it was fine, so Drista spawned a total of 7-8 dogs and tamed all but one. She then gave bones to Tommy so he could tame at least one of them.
  </p>
  <p key="74af9663-7457-45f2-942e-c580603160e6">
   Later, Tommy and Drista came across Tommy's embassy and the Bench. Tommy asked Drista to play the "Pigstep" disc in an attempt to grab the disc.

   , not knowing that her dogs would attack him. Some of her dogs died due to Awesamdude's Thorns armor, causing him to engage in a small fight against Drista and Tommy. Tommy later told her to do /kill Awesamdude, but Awesamdude immediately left to preserve his life.
  </p>
  <p key="ca8b411d-7c06-4291-8516-e7509cf3a83f">
   In the aftermath of the fight, the trio headed to L'Manberg. Drista gave bedrock to Tubbo, and Techno managed to kill Tubbo and pick up the bedrock. It is the second piece of bedrock currently in the possession of players. She placed a shulker box which Punz broke and managed to take, sparking a lot of chaos in the process. Punz quickly logged off, and the conflict calmed down until Tommy told Drista to do the command "/ban Dream." She instead responded by banning Technoblade, Tubbo, and Sam.

  <p key="77055bca-9aa9-4abc-b9be-311d836dadc8">
   Some time later, a party was hosted, and Drista attempted to spawn a wither but was stopped. She also constantly got in "fork" fights with Dream at the encouragement of Tommy and Techno.

   Initially, Dream hopped on the SMP as a cameo to say he was out of prison jokingly during a stream with Drista on March 28, 2021.
   However, the two decided to return to the SMP and hang out. He and Drista obtained items from the Community House and the nether hub, and the two joined VC with Ranboo, who spoke with the two shortly. Drista then toured the
   Big Innit Hotel

   The three started messing around, and Drista jokingly killed Jack and Quackity on and off.

   George shortly afterward said that he would trade all of the items in his ender chest for a full set of netherite armor. If the coin landed on tails, the trade would go through. If it didn't, George would lose all of his items. It landed on heads, and George lost everything.

After he tells her why, she gives him a stack of seeds. He also has to tell her that Dream is in prison, and he shows her what her brother did. The duo then return to Tommy's base and she just randomly starts filling the chest Tommy has open with seeds. When Tommy mines a gold block and has to make room for it, she drops a stack of gold blocks.

  <p key="c9c9eb49-e0aa-4f5c-9977-5abfcc17a6b4">
   Drista's sixth visit to the Dream SMP was prompted by her anger at TommyInnit, Awesamdude, and Foolish for killing her dog, Bruno.
   Upon arriving, she chased Tommy to Las Nevadas, and together, they gambled with the casino slot machine while discussing the death of Bruno. After getting cornered in the slot machine, Tommy called out to Dream, and Drista put Dream on. Tommy used Dream as a distraction and fled, but Dream quickly informed Drista and allowed her to pursue Tommy. The two eventually talked it out with Tommy agreeing to do what she wanted for the rest of the visit.
  </p>
  <p key="4f1e6730-7086-4e1e-bd61-53768fc1fe7c">
   The two then started traveling to Tommy's house. Tommy mentioned that he wanted to grief
   CaptainPuffy
   and stated that Puffy was "born evil." The two then started catching up and asking each other what they have done since the last time they met. Drista then stopped Tommy near
   Punz's house
   to force Tommy to tame a wolf which she killed shortly after. After killing the dog, Drista insisted that they grief Sapnap simply because she didn't like him.
  </p>
  <p key="2220e619-72be-4402-b996-f56a445251b9">
   Tommy and Drista were then distracted by Puffy's prank on a beacon and on Tommy's house. Tommy started destroying the prank while speaking to Drista about sports and his mother.
  </p>
  <p key="0f6504cb-b56f-4853-b9ba-ab68fd1d7b69">
   After finishing the destruction of Puffy's prank, the two started navigating towards Kinoko Kingdom to retaliate against Sapnap. Drista once again asked Tommy to tame another wolf that she subsequently killed. After Drista killed the wolf, the two continued down the Prime Path, also discussing an IRL meetup and Tommy's scent. Tommy then realized that Drista and Sapnap were in the same house IRL and proceeded to tell her that she should bring Sapnap into the room. Drista agreed, and upon entering the room, Sapnap was greeted with Drista holding a fork and speaking a made-up language. After Sapnap left, Drista and Tommy discussed drugs while walking towards Kinoko Kingdom.

   Shortly after, Sapnap logged onto the server and attempted to drive them away from Kinoko Kingdom. However, Drista spawned in a pig and saddle for Tommy to ride on while she flew away with a lead connecting it, allowing Tommy to fly. The two then added Sapnap in the voice call and demanded control of Kinoko Kingdom, which ended up in a shouting match with echo and high-pitched voice filters. After the voice filters, Tommy decided to "air strike" Kinoko Kingdom by igniting TNT while flying with through pig and Drista. He bombed portions of buildings around the kingdom before leaving the area to go target other structures.

  <p key="b2d5edb9-5b85-4e71-81bb-142afa4654bc">
   After leaving Kinoko Kingdom, the first thing they targeted was

   Church Prime
   with Drista insisting they should and Tommy arguing against it. The two also contacted Technoblade to ask for advice on how they can heal the pig.

   After Tommy and Drista decided not to target Church Prime, Sapnap contacted the two with a request to join them in their bombing sprees while offering forgiveness for bombing Kinoko Kingdom. The two agreed, and Sapnap joined them in the bombing spree. The three then agreed to invite Technoblade and asked Dream for Techno's location. Dream pointed towards the prison, and Drista, Sapnap, and Tommy started flying towards it to break Techno out. Since the prison is constructed of bomb-proof materials, Drista teleported Techno out. With Technoblade among them, the squad's ranks increased to four, and the four traveled away from the prison to grief and attack more locations.
  </p>
  <p key="63186869-61cd-4be0-a421-1965547343be">
   The first target was Jack Manifold's hotel. Tommy initially refused to target the hotel, but Drista convinced Tommy to do so. After igniting the first piece of TNT, Tommy realized that they could blow up the hotel to force Jack to abandon it and allow Tommy to reclaim and rebuild. However, before bombing more of the hotel, Tommy turned their attention to the "You 💔 Little Penis" sign.
  </p>
  <p key="958ff0a4-f61e-4a66-8787-2d69efc912e0">
   Though there was disagreement over whether or not to destroy the sign, the four bombers ended up on top of the sign to destroy it and place TNT. The four then ignited the TNT and watched from afar, but due to the insufficient amount of TNT placed, some of the signs still remained, reading "ENIS". The four agreed to leave it and name their bomb squad "ENIS."
  </p>
  <p key="2ac55ce8-c83a-4fc9-8b4b-8ac38bd9505f">
   The Enis Squad then regrouped on the ground near the canon life graveyard. Drista inquired as to why Tommy has a grave when he is still alive. Tommy expressed discomfort at the inquiry, and it was implied he didn't want to talk about it. Tommy and Drista then left the other two, and the mood was lightened significantly when Drista messed with the sign on Tommy's grave, making it read "rip Pussy."

   After moving on from the graveyard, Drista and Tommy began to discuss swear words. The conversation eventually lead to Tommy inquiring about Dream's personal life; namely, whether or not he has a girlfriend. Drista refused to answer at first, but eventually stated that he does. Tommy then asked for a picture of this girlfriend, and, while Drista sent it to him, she stated that Dream's girlfriend is "nice" and that they have met. The picture in question was then revealed to simply be a photo of George heavily edited to make his face seem more feminine and his hair longer.

   The two continued bickering as they make their way to Tommy's house which Tommy planned to rebuild. Shortly after they arrived there, however, Puffy appeared, both logging onto the voice call and meeting them on the SMP. She and Tommy fought with one another, ending in Drista once more banning Tommy from the server. After Tommy promised to "be nice," Drista unbanned him. Their banter then resumed, and they discuss drugs, hacking, and whether or not they are friends. The conversation evolved into another argument; this time about Drista's potential forgiveness of Tommy.

   After Tommy stated he had to end the stream, the two agreed that Drista would forgive him on three conditions, which was to give her sea pickles, to build her a hotel on the SMP, to spawn her a new dog to replace the one he helped kill. Tommy gave Drista the sea pickles, and they then established that this dog would be named Brunoto in memory of the first Bruno.
