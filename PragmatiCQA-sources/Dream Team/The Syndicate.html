   Technoblade was tasked with finding members for their new faction. He began searching the ruins of
   L'Manberg
   when he received a message from Niki, inviting him to her city as she had heard he wanted to talk.
   Upon meeting, the two spoke about anarchy, and Technoblade talked about how impressed he was because she burned
   L'Mantree
   . Niki said that the offer to join him in anarchy was tempting, but declined his offer because her goals were currently different from anarchist ideals.
   Technoblade left her and said that he wasn't going to ask people for a while, as he thought Niki would be great and that he probably couldn't convince anyone else if he couldn't convince her.

   During this meeting, Philza revealed the meeting room and its features like the meeting table (made out of an end portal that cannot be activated), the secret entrances and exits, the qualities of the room, and the ender pearl stasis chambers. The meeting room is located in the stronghold under the ocean near Technoblade, Philza, and Ranboo's bases. They discussed the following:

    The Egg
    and the
    Eggpire
    : Brought up by Phil, they discussed their preference against the Eggpire and their personal experiences with the egg. Technoblade suggested talking to people not directly involved with the egg. Phil said that there is the possibility that the Syndicate would have to make an "omelette," referencing the new sub-faction "Pro-Omelette."

    Snowchester

    Tommy
    's death: This fact was brought up by Ranboo. All members (except for Ranboo) agreed that it was virtually impossible for him to die and that they were not convinced he was dead.
    This suspicion turned out to be correct; Tommy had been revived by the time the meeting took place, but the Syndicate was unaware of this until Tommy left
    Pandora's Vault
    six days later.

   After the events of the first meeting, the Syndicate set out to investigate Snowchester. Upon arriving at Snowchester, the group met up with
   Tubbo
   , who gave them a tour of Snowchester. Tubbo told them that Snowchester was not a country, but simply an isolationist and militaristic colony. Tubbo also showed the members of the Syndicate the nukes, and when the group asked why Tubbo would need nukes, Tubbo cited that it is simply for self-defense. This made the Syndicate extremely suspicious of Snowchester. However, since Snowchester had not done anything with the nukes, the Syndicate accepted the self-defense excuse.

   On June 1, 2021, the members of the Syndicate met up at
   Technoblade's cabin
   to celebrate his birthday. They set off a few fireworks, joked around, and ate some cake. Philza decided to tell the members about Wilbur's revival which surprised both Techno and Niki, as well as upsetting the latter. The four of them talked about how
   Schlatt
   's return would be even worse. They also brought up
   Ghostbur
   , which caused Niki to freak out, but the others managed to calm her down. They then started to talk about the new risks of governments popping up.

   Whilst Technoblade left to talk to
   someone
   , Phil told Ranboo about "her," a woman that allegedly helped grow a forest that had recently sprouted near the cabin, although the contents of this conversation are unknown. When Techno returned to the others, the group continued celebrating his birthday. Phil then showed the other Syndicate members the training area under the cabin. When Phil asked who Techno was speaking to, Techno briefly talked about it, although he didn't mention who he talked to or what they were talking about in great detail. Most of them didn't persist although Niki assumed it was Wilbur because the person 'sounded like someone with empty promises'. The members then decide to just party and forget about it for the time being.

  <p key="6f594cbe-9daf-4da5-8c7c-f0c5c74323aa">
   Niki starts to distrust the members of the Syndicate for not telling her of Ghostbur or of Wilbur's potential revival sooner. She wonders if everything she had done with them had been for nothing because now Wilbur would retake the spotlight and manipulate her again.

   On November 28, 2021 Technoblade gathered the members of the Syndicate that were not imprisoned. Philza and and Niki showed up to the meeting and Techno discussed the plans to break Dream out of Pandora's Vault and how Sam had imprisoned Ranboo. With this development, the Syndicate planned to break Ranboo out of Pandora's Vault alongside Dream. Techno discovers his dog at this meeting and names him
   Apollo
   , recruiting Apollo into the Syndicate. Technoblade gives Niki the materials to make withers in the event that things go south for the jailbreak plans.

  <p key="10280fc7-ed56-47a1-9f1a-5fc0f7837c3b">
   As they reach the prison, Phil and Niki stay outside as Techno and Apollo dig underground to go to the prison. After digging under the ground, Techno and Apollo approached the lower walls of the prison in an area where the alarm system did not reach. Techno gave himself and Apollo fire resistance and broke into the prison. They began to swim through the lava and sneak into Dream's cell. Dream is shocked to see that Techno came back and is also confused at the fact that he had brought his dog. Knowing that breaking any blocks would trigger the alarm system, Techno used TNT to blow up multiple blocks at once and allowing Dream to exit his cell. Techno gave Dream full netherite and fire resistance so he could fight the following battle. The alarm system went off, alerting Sam and BadBoyHalo that Dream was escaping. As Dream and Techno began running through the prison, Sam reached them and killed Apollo in the lava. On the other side of the lava, Sam and Bad met Techno and Dream and fought them. Bad was killed twice by Techno and Sam was forced to retreat. Sam went to alert others that Dream was escaping. Techno and Dream, now without Apollo, retraced their steps and broke into a cell in the cellblock in hopes of finding Ranboo.

  <p key="f0e3cecc-8eed-4592-b830-8a21d08b8ceb">
   Instead, they find
   ConnorEatsPants
   who claimed to be arrested for 'stolen valor'. After a brief conversation, Connor joing the prisonbreak and Techno used a lever to open the cell door. After leaving Connor's cell, they take a turn and break Ranboo out of his cell. With this, Ranboo also joined the prisonbreak despite his reluctance due to Dream being out. As they all retraced their steps and Techno gave Ranboo and Connor netherite, they found their way to the broken part of the wall where Techno came in from. They began to run through and attempt to finally leave when Same caught up with them and fighting began in the tunnel.

  <p key="7aa0663f-f1d2-45f8-b543-fc1d02c5f021">
   The jailbreak team managed to escape the tunnel, only to see the large army Sam had gathered outside led by Tommy and
   Sapnap
   . With heavy fighting ensuing, Niki fled the scene after Sapnap caught her spawning withers to cause chaos. Sam, knowing Ranboo's weakness was his care for
   MICHAEL
   , threatened he would kill MICHAEL if Ranboo didn't stop and take off his armor. Ranboo complied and Sam took Ranboo as a hostage. If Dream didn't come back, Ranboo would die. Dream, not caring about Ranboo, did not comply with Sam's demands. Sam, following through on his ultimatum, killed Ranboo. This shocked Techno as two members of the Syndicate had died in under a single hour: Apollo and Ranboo. Techno and Dream ran to Philza and got on horses, running away and using the Nether to escape whilst Niki escaped using a portal to
   Logstedshire

The Syndicate members seemed quite impressed with the community, as they were a "colony" formed only as a safe haven to protect themselves from outside threats. Technoblade later voiced his concerns of Snowchester based on their use of nuclear weapons, but decided to just keep his eye on the faction as it didn't seem as if it was doing anything exceedingly tyrannical.
