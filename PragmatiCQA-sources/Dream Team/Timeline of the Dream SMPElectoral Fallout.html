    The Electoral Fallout
   </b>
   occurred after
   The L'Manbergian Election
   . After POG2020's loss,
   L'Manberg
   saw a huge shift in power, and was rebranded to
   Manberg
   under the new leadership of
   Jschlatt
   . The power shift in L'Manberg and the banishment of Wilbur and Tommy sparked a
   rebellion
   , and many plots to overthrow
   Schlatt
   were developed.
