   Tubbo Administration
   quickly began to rebuild L'Manberg.

   Technoblade is an anthropomorphic pig. He wears a crown, a white dress shirt, a red royal gown, grey pants, and black boots. He is generally drawn by fans and animatics as either a human wearing a pig mask/hoglin skull, a human with pink hair and a red royal gown, or a pig wearing royal attire that closely resembles his Minecraft skin. Notably, Technoblade has expressed his preference towards the more pig-like of these depictions, implying that this is what he considers to be canonical.

   Technoblade is an anarchist who seeks the end of government and oppression. He fights for whichever side promises to fight against tyranny, and allows him to use his weapons of mass destruction to achieve his goals. He does not care much for the interweaving loyalties of the other SMP members. Techno has stated that "the only universal language is violence," but will occasionally make grandiose speeches to other people in order to try and resolve things peacefully. However, when this doesn't work, Technoblade is quick to resort to violence.
  </p>
  <p key="a744a4a3-89ce-45dc-88cc-168d5d12df05">
   Technoblade is also a proud man, and shows off his skills and equipment whenever he can. He claims to have mapped out the entire SMP in his head and calls himself the "Human GPS." Technoblade also has a lot of material possessions, and is always on the search for the most powerful items on the server.
  </p>
  <p key="65ffec2c-722b-45dc-9fc3-0291b734cf6e">
   Despite his violent and seemingly uncaring façade, he will do everything in his power to protect those he cares most about, most notably Phil. He also seems to hold remorse regarding his involvement with Pogtopia, wishing that Pogtopia and himself worked together to fight against tyranny rather than trying to establish another government. As an additive of this, Technoblade has an unwavering sense of loyalty towards his personal beliefs on anarchy. It is implied by his codename of "Protesilaus" in the Syndicate that Technoblade is more than willing to fight and die in the frontlines just so he can end what he perceives as tyrannical leaderships.

  <p key="5ddd018c-28b0-4227-b082-12f94e9dc85f">
   After the
   Manberg vs Pogtopia War
   , Technoblade stated that he had given up his violent ways, and retired far away in an arctic so that no one could find him, except for Phil, to whom he had given a compass that led to his base. He still showed no hesitation in defending himself, but was willing to leave L'Manberg alone after the war, and was trying to change from his violent ways. He started a bee farm and a turtle farm, and seemed quite happy with his newfound pacifism. During this retirement, however, he had secretly grinded for more than a hundred wither skulls, which he kept in a secret vault. After being hunted by the
   Butcher Army
   , having his weapons stolen and sentenced to execution, Techno was forced out of retirement, and returned to his violent ways in order to get revenge and destroy the L'Manberg government once and for all, becoming an "aspect of justice/balance." He stated that if people pay him with service and friendship, he will return that service and friendship tenfold. If they serve him injustice, he will repay the injustice with a thousand times the amount they served him with.

  <p key="98f0d6b3-5886-4e26-9b3d-9c9ee8193cf1">
   Technoblade’s main flaws are his loyalty, his wrath and his Pride. Technoblade is unwaveringly loyal to those he considers his friends and allies, and is willing to go to nearly any length to keep them safe. Earning Technoblade’s loyalty is difficult, however, and if Techno ever feels as though someone he trusted has wronged him, he holds an intense grudge. This leads to his wrath, as he often quickly and decisively strikes out to utterly destroy whoever he feels has wronged him and his friends. One of the most notable examples of this combination of loyalty and wrath is when, after feeling betrayed by
   TommyInnit
   , being almost executed by the Butcher Army, and having seen how L'Manberg had put

   , completely destroyed L'Manberg.
  </p>
  <p key="e3c79a54-9da0-4429-95a9-d5b47c928b3a">
   Another major flaw of Technoblade is that he is quick to resort to violence. Rather than trying his best to pursue a peaceful resolution through negotiations or bartering, he will hastily turn to extreme amounts of violence. These violent tendencies are often prompted by either his incapability of handling peer pressure, or
   the voices in his head
   encouraging him to do as such. However, Technoblade frequently tries to disregard these voices, and will almost always try to find a peaceful solution first, even if he quickly gives up on peace in favor of violence.
  </p>
  <p key="35837ac4-6374-4147-b896-6964e9083fbd">
   Techno stands strongly to his beliefs. He truly believes that people are better off without the existence of governments. However, this can be seen as cruel, as his methods can cause immense pain for many as seen from past L'Manberg citizens such as Tubbo and Tommy. Adding onto this, Techno has an issue conveying his true feelings towards things, which can make many people see him as overly prideful and selfish. An instance of him conveying his true feelings would be in his will, where he states that he hopes Tommy can find what he’s looking for. This is a contrast from Techno saying that he despises Tommy for betraying him.
  </p>
  <p key="ddebaf4d-f997-4024-a8ec-ecc332e627d4">
   An enduring flaw of Technoblade is his tendency to fall into pressure when situations are focused solely on him. When Jschlatt told Techno to execute Tubbo, he ended up bending to it and killing Tubbo despite trying to say he shouldn't. In the Prison Break, Techno is pressured by Sam when he takes Ranboo hostage, which eventually leads to Ranboo's death.

   This led to Technoblade joining the Dream SMP to aid in the founding of
   Pogtopia

Technoblade denied these accusations, stating that if he'd truly been paid to kill Wilbur and Tommy, he would have done so already. The following day, Dream contacted Technoblade to show support and gave Technoblade supplies, including netherite ingots and an enchanted golden apple.

   At Pogtopia, Tommy confronted him for killing Tubbo, believing him to have betrayed their cause. Wilbur, siding with Techno, dug a pit for the two to brawl their emotions out in. Techno didn't hold any ill will towards Tubbo or Tommy, but agreed to the fight. When Techno won, Tommy continued to voice his anger at Techno, failing to recognize the reason behind using the pit for conflict. Finally taking things completely seriously, Techno told Tommy that the time for talking was over, reminding him that the only universal language is violence and that they already spoke that language, in the pit.

   After the Manberg vs Pogtopia war, Technoblade found that his base and cow farm was robbed and vandalized by L'Manberg and their allies, making it unsafe to live near the country. Technoblade cut off contact from his closest ally, Phil, to protect him, and started to search for land for a new home. He stumbled upon a snow village in a barren snow wasteland and built a
   cabin
   to store his valuables and regain what was stolen.

   He eventually called on Philza a week later for help transporting his rare Halloween mobs and the sole remaining cow to his retirement home. After being helped, Techno then gave Phil a compass that would be able to lead to his base as well as a few emeralds as a token of friendship and appreciation, demonstrating a close relationship between the two. The two searched for turtles and bees and worked on farms together. In the passing days, Techno reflected on his violent past, realizing that much of his rage stemmed from
   voices in his head
   and that his violence harmed those around him. Because of this, he took on an oath of pacifism, aiming to be a good person.

   On December 16, 2020, the
   Butcher Army
   , a secret police force from L'Manberg aiming to execute Technoblade, made their move. They took the compass that led to Technoblade's cabin from Phil's home and placed him under house arrest. Phil secretly messaged Techno, warning him that the bounty hunters were on their way, which gave him just enough time to prepare. When the Butcher Army arrived, they stated that Techno was to come to L'Manberg to face trial. Techno pleaded for them not to do this, saying that he had changed his ways to be peaceful, but that he would not go back without a fight. When they failed to listen to these warnings, he caved into his voices, and killed Tubbo and Fundy, which was half of the army. However, Quackity stopped the fight by taking
   Carl
   , Techno's prized horse, hostage and threatening to kill him. To save Carl, Techno surrendered to their demands, dropping his armor, potions, and weapons, and coming with them. However, he secretly kept a totem of undying and was escorted back to L'Manberg, where it was revealed that it was not a trial at all, but an execution.
  </p>
  <p key="74870926-41dd-493b-b015-53d7884a166c">
   In L'Manberg, Techno saw Phil under house arrest, and was filled with new grief and rage against the L'Manberg government. Techno was trapped in a guillotine while Tubbo gave a short speech. However, the execution was interrupted by
   Punz
   , who attacked the L'Manbergians and placed TNT on the podium. In the chaos, Quackity activated the guillotine, dropping an anvil on Techno. Techno equipped his totem of undying, allowing him to escape death and flee. Dream (who had sent Punz and been spying on the events) rescued Carl, met up with Techno, and pointed at a tunnel leading to the
   Final Control Room
   , which had basic gear for making an escape. Quackity managed to follow and confront Techno, where he expressed his hatred for Techno, his desire to accumulate power in L'Manberg, his plan to kill him right there. However, Techno managed to kill Quackity with a pickaxe and steal the majority of his items, escaping through the
   sewer system
   to his base. On his voyage back, he reflected upon events and realized that his pacifist vows could not be upheld. Techno permanently broke his vow of peace and turned back to his violent ways.

Dream attempted to manipulate Tommy with his words, saying that Tommy had betrayed Dream by escaping his exile and hiding from him. Technoblade stopped Dream, stating that "he is with me." He explained that they were business partners and Tommy was under his protection, unless Dream wanted to call in
   his favor

On their last mission together, Techno and Tommy withdrew three wither skulls and some soul sand to be used for leverage for Technoblade's sword, Orphan Obliterator, and possibly his trident or axe. The duo descended to meet Ranboo and Fundy and gave them an ultimatum: Techno summons the wither and attacks them, or he summons the wither, they return his gear, and Techno helps them kill the wither. Before they had a chance to decide, Techno summoned the wither. Ranboo rushed off to get the Axe of Peace and the Orphan Obliterator. After killing the wither, Fundy claimed the nether star, but Tommy and Techno quickly teamed up to terrorize him. In their interrogation, they discovered that a

   After the nation fell and Techno's revenge was exacted, Techno and Phil returned home with the remainder of the dogs, talking about different farms and the life of anarchy. Dream chose not to speak with the anarchists afterward; their loose alliance ended with the desolation of L'Manberg and they went their separate ways. Remembering Ranboo, Techno and Phil agreed that they could give him shelter, but Techno wanted to keep his emotional distance after the last person he took in, Tommy, betrayed him.

   Ranboo was given amnesty and a permit to build a small house near a mountain where Phil would build a kennel for the dogs, as they eventually needed to move out of Tommy and Ghostbur's unfinished house. As thanks to Techno for letting him stay, Ranboo remade the Axe of Peace, which Tommy had lost in the fighting. Techno tried to act aloof and indifferent towards the gift, trying to preserve his "tough" image, but he clearly was touched by this gesture and Ranboo's consideration.

   Ranboo and Techno went on a journey to a woodland mansion. Techno brought along an elite task force from the
   Hound Army

   After Ranboo revealed the location of a stronghold near Techno's base, Techno and Phil went on a small mission to explore it. The two wound up lost in the halls of the catacomb, but they eventually found each other and discovered a large room with 12 indestructible blocks forming a square (the portal room). The two did not know what to do with the portal blocks, so they decided to make a table out of it. They began building chairs and flattening out the room so that no one would fall into the pit of lava and die. They placed a sign behind the founder's chair that said: "Sic semper tyrannis." This would be the motto of the Syndicate, and it translates from Latin to English; "Thus always to tyrants." The two began to plan out other things for the room: pearl stasis chambers to teleport members into the room, water elevators for a quick exit, and converting the upstairs igloo basement into a secret entrance for the members of the Syndicate.

   The day after founding the Syndicate, Techno began his quest to recruit specific candidates. He decided that Niki would be a good candidate, but before he could send her a message, she sent him one saying she knew he was looking for her and asking where he wanted to meet. She sent a message of coordinates that led to her work-in-progress underground library and storage. Techno said he was impressed with Niki's boldness and resilience toward government on Doomsday and questioned her on anarchy. She replied by saying that all she knew about anarchy was causing destruction, terrorism, and chaos. Techno told her that there was much more to anarchy than just those 3 words, though they were a large part of the anarchist ideology. He told her that the real core of anarchism is freedom of choice, to be free of leaders and do what you want. Techno then asked if she wanted to be an anarchist, to which Niki replied by saying that she needed time to figure out what she was going to do, as she wanted to focus on her personal goals first of killing Tommy and Dream for lying and destroying her life. Techno asked her how, but she refused to tell him and Techno left, wishing her luck.

Bad discovered that Ranboo was spying on their conversation, and managed to trap Ranboo next to the Egg with the intent of brainwashing him; Techno quickly gave Ranboo his trident and an ender pearl, letting him escape. Now angered that Bad had threatened Techno's "associate," Techno and Puffy attacked Bad and suggested that he would blow up the Egg. Puffy and Techno officially named the group of people that Puffy has been leading against the Eggpire - "pro-omelette," before taking Ranboo and Steve back home to recover.

Philza decides to tell the members about Wilbur's revival which Technoblade takes calmly. The four of them speak about how Schlatt's return would be even worse and they bring up Ghostbur which causes Niki to freak out, but the others manage to calm her down.

   On June 6, Techno planned to visit Dream, telling Philza before leaving. Phil was not in support of the idea, saying that 50% of the people who visit the prison die. Before the departure, Technoblade handed Phil his will, which further increased Phil's doubt. But once he knew he couldn't change Technoblade's mind, he relented. Technoblade arrived at the prison and followed the usual entrance procedures. As he was on the platform towards Dream's cell, Dream paniced and told Techno that Quackity and Sam were working together in order to trap Techno in the prison with Dream. However, it was already too late. Sam told Technoblade that he could do with a "nice, long stay" for being the most likely person to rescue Dream and let down the lava flow, trapping Techno inside. Dream was extremely frustrated because the only person who could help him get out of the prison was now trapped in with him. However, Techno stayed calm and said he believed his friends would be willing to help him escape. He also tasked Dream with getting a book and quill and writing everything he knew about the prison. Dream was confused about Technoblade's upbeat attitude but did as he was told.

Techno did tell Dream to do so, but while shaking his head no. Quackity then gave up and decided to kill Techno, using a diamond pickaxe to remind Techno of how he had killed him before. However, while trying to do this, Techno was teleported to The Syndicate's meeting room by Philza. Techno was glad to have escaped, but annoyed because he had told Phil to teleport him after three days, not three months. Techno promised that he would break Dream out of prison and destroy it block by block. He then recovered his items and went to coordinates given to him by Dream, which led to the mountain where they had first met. He dug into the ground and discovered a chest full of blueprints.

       picked up the Axe of Peace from one of Tommy's deaths, and intended to use it as leverage or bargaining on a later date, and didn't care if he dangled it above Tommy's or Techno's heads. Ranboo has recently made Technoblade a new axe as a replacement for the Axe of Peace as gratitude to Techno for letting him stay. The original axe was in Sapnap's possession at the time. The axe was temporarily placed in Dream's collection, but was quickly retrieved after a large force of Tommy's allies arrived to save him. Tommy possessed the Axe of Peace, but due to his imprisonment and death in the prison, it was in the prison visitor locker room until Tommy's resurrection and release.

It was seized by Tubbo during Techno's execution. Ranboo later returned it to Technoblade alongside the Axe of Peace. Techno retrieved it after escaping from pandora's vault

       It was also seized by Tubbo during Techno's execution. Tubbo kept the trident for movement quality of life, but used it very poorly. During the Hostage Exchange, Tubbo lied to Techno that he gave the trident to Fundy and actually kept the trident in his ender chest, unwilling to give it up. This item was believed to be recovered by him during the Doomsday War, however, Techno is unsure if the current trident he has is his old one, as Tubbo never repaired Techno's trident and the trident Techno recovered was almost at full durability.

Techno doesn't seem to care much about Moon since it's "annoying," and even originally named it  "Fool" in a pure moment of impulse after it walked into the corner it was originally trapped in. It was later renamed on December 9 due to a donation from a user by the name of "DJ Moon."

      Manberg vs Pogtopia war

      As an authority figure and warden of the prison, Techno already disliked Sam, but after Sam trapped him in the prison his dislike grew much further though he remained calm about it. He currently seems to be planning to take him down and get out. When Techno broke Dream, Ranboo, and Connor out of the prison, Sam killed Ranboo after showing him a picture of Michael. Techno attempted to kill Sam but was unsuccessful as many people were attacking him, forcing him to retreat with Dream and Phillza.

      Puffy used to recognize him as a chaotic member. One a knight should stand against at all costs. However, after the events of the blood vines and the formation of the Eggpire, she began to see Techno's point of view and saw that power corrupted. She wrote in her captain's log that it was time for anarchy and that she planned to ally with Technoblade. She also defended Techno and Ranboo against Bad when he tried to lure them to the Egg, and took Techno's advice on marketing the anti-Egg side as "pro-omelette." Both Puffy and Techno are in the same stance against the Eggpire.

      Technoblade and Dream have a friendly rivalry. Technoblade fought alongside Dream in the
      War of the Burning Eiffel Tower
      while they assisted
      Pogtopia
      's efforts. During the final battle, Technoblade did not agree with reinstating the government, so they both created a mini group called "Team Chaos" and spawned Withers that destroyed L'Manberg.
      <p key="197a7393-a074-4c83-b17b-8d11f9b0963a">
       Later, Technoblade and Dream met up on top of a mountain for Dream to give the former a woodland mansion map to get Totems of Undying.

After becoming trapped in prison with Dream, he and Techno bonded, and Techno considers them close friends, and worked together to try and break out of prison. Over the three months they spent together in prison they became friends. After Techno escaped via stasis pearl he left Dream behind but followed the coordinates Dream gave him to the place they first met and found the chest he had hidden there.

       On November 28. 2021, Techno repaid the favour and broke Dream out of prison. However, the two continuously disagreed on what actions to take during the breakout, with Dream prioritizing his own safety over recuing Ranboo, greatly frustrating Techno.

      <p key="643085f5-a854-4094-becb-c1194750b1a0">
       Despite the two parting ways on even terms, there was some uneasiness between them after the breakout. Techno refused to let Dream keep the armor he gave him during the breakout, demanding he return it while the Syndicate surrounded him and only let him keep the sword and shield. While Dream stated he owed Techno for helping him when he left the cabin, during the confrontation under Snowchester he said the opposite, that he didn't owe Techno anything and returned the Axe of Peace to demonstrate that. There was noticeable tension between the two, likely due to Dream abandoning Ranboo after escaping the prison.

He appeared to be genuinely afraid when Quackity showed his pickaxe and shouted the same words he himself spoke during their duel, and expressed to Philza both his relief at getting out, and his concerns that Quackity was about to kill him.

       However, on the day of the Manberg vs Pogtopia war, Techno revealed his true stance by killing the new president, Tubbo, and destroying the remains of L'Manberg with withers. Tommy was infuriated, calling Techno a traitor. However, Technoblade denied the accusations, stating that he had exhibited his anarchist ways long before the war. After the events of the war, partial amends were made with Technoblade, but these did not diffuse the tension between the two. Tommy blamed Techno more for the destruction of L'Manberg than Wilbur. Post-exile, Technoblade visited Tommy, mocking him and drawing parallels between Tommy and Theseus.
      </p>
      <p key="155beb0f-9fbe-44c4-89b8-9a2131cfeb87">
       After Tommy's escape from
       Logstedshire
       , he secretly moved in under Techno's cabin. Techno quickly found out, and he decided that he was willing to form an alliance with Tommy so they could achieve their goals. Upon forming their alliance, Techno revealed his second bunker to Tommy and provided him resources. While the two still had tension, they worked together to gain strength. When Dream confronted Tommy and planned to take him, Techno stopped him, stating that Tommy was his mutual partner and forcing Dream to let him go.
      </p>
      <p key="78ed2f72-1cf9-4d7c-aff4-9b75db1c1185">
       During "The Decision," Technoblade expressed that Tommy could be useful, and perhaps even a friend. However, he also made it clear that such friendship was conditional on Tommy staying allied with Technoblade and his ideals. Unfortunately, Tommy was unable to believe in Techno's ideals, leading to his betrayal during the confrontation at the Community House by siding with L'Manberg. Techno asked Tommy to return the Axe of Peace, stating that he was not worthy, but Tommy refused.
      </p>
      <p key="69ce85ca-068a-4d80-91d5-c4715d771356">
       Their relationship is still incredibly complicated, with both of them feeling betrayed by one another. This was demonstrated during a heated exchange on Doomsday in which both of them vented out their anger, spurred on by betrayal. It seems evident that both Tommy and Techno saw each other as friends rather than purely business partners towards the end, thus making Tommy's betrayal all the more bitter.
      </p>
      <p key="60fffbd6-d1da-4043-b32f-f281b952bce7">
       After finding out that Tommy had died Techno does not fully believe and claims that he's glad he's dead due to his betrayal.
      </p>
      <p key="639f5b02-4584-41d8-a1ef-96fbde86c877">
       When writing his will Technoblade wrote for Phil to tell Tommy he hopes he finds what he’s looking for, this hints that Technoblade’s look on Tommy has changed and is more neutral than anything.

      Tubbo and Techno were both formerly Pogtopian, but Technoblade and Tubbo seldom interacted. During the festival, Techno killed Tubbo on orders of Schlatt despite Tubbo's belief that Techno was on their side; however, Tubbo quickly forgave him for this, as he understood Techno's motives.
      <p key="dbb981ed-4c30-400c-8dbe-92226ce2d338">
       Techno considers those who wish to establish a government as enemies. When Tubbo declared himself the president of L'Manberg, this negatively affected their relationship. Techno's relation with Tubbo was further strained after Tubbo and the Butcher Army hunted him, and after Techno destroyed L'Manberg.
      </p>
      <p key="c79d8bde-3a2d-4fdd-9904-088175408a28">
       After the war, Tubbo founded the community of Snowchester, an isolationist militaristic colony with no centralized government. Though Techno approved of this change in lifestyle, their long history and Tubbo's possession of nuclear weapons continue to strain their relationship.
      </p>
      <p key="def57257-136e-4719-a46d-740350b52f27">
       After the events of the prison break-in to rescue Ranboo, Techno went to seek out Tubbo after being given a picture of him, Ranboo, and Michael. The two agreed to team up to rescue Michael, who had, from their perspectives, gone missing, and appear to be putting their differences aside as such. They agreed that L'manburg was in the past and only seem to be slightly cautious around eachother.

      Because of Techno's relationship with Dream, it can be said that relations between him and the Dream SMP are positive. Dream SMP citizens have assisted Techno multiple times. However, this positive relationship is somewhat canceled out by his heavy dislike for governments, which the Dream SMP happens to have.

      While Technoblade was an ally of the Pogtopian effort, Techno remained an anarchist, eventually breaking away from the country at the end of the Manberg vs Pogtopia War to destroy L'Manberg. After destroying the country, the
      Tubbo Administration
      formed the Butcher Army to hunt Technoblade. In revenge, Techno attacked the rebuilt country with Dream during the Doomsday War, utterly destroying it and creating a massive crater where it once stood. Given that L'Manberg's destruction dissolved the faction, their relationship ended very negatively.
