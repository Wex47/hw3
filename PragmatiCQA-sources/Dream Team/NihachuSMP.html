   Niki is a human with light skin, long-lashed brown eyes, and shoulder-length blonde hair which dyes pink. She has many casual outfits, but the one she currently uses is a gray jacket over a black crop top, camo-patterned shorts, and black boots. During peacetime and while expanding her horizons with dates and more builds, she often wore a striped red, orange, cream, and blue sweater, long black pants with a belt, and blue shoes.

   She also had a business suit worn only when needed, which appeared to be a typical tuxedo with the addition of the tricorn hat, and a temporary Christmas outfit where she sported a checkered sweater, long leggings, and a Santa hat.
  </p>
  <p key="9a11a9ad-d240-43db-8db8-f4272b9f5c78">
   Her villain outfit, ironically is quite similar to her outcast one, with her owning some new peach pink hair, brown boots, and a cream white shirt, as well as Wilbur's old coat and cloak that he wore back in his own spiral. She now sports some dark blue eyes instead of her usual light brown eyes. She tied her hair back once again and her skin tone has darkened by a little. She also wears some black jeans, a brown belt, and a golden necklace around her neck, all of which is from her outcast era.

  <p key="c5bfd18b-afc5-4abd-b57c-c04e5b72c694">
   Niki's new casual skin, has light pink hair with cat ears. She also sports a black jumper with a grey patterned stripe and grey trousers. She has also worn variations of her causal skin; for Pride Month the grey stripe was changed to the Bi Flag, during a black and white stream she wore a colour drained version of the outfit and has worn 3D glasses in tribute of The Gays, The Girls and Jack Manifold (Her MCC Team).

   During her early days on the server, Niki was very generous and thoughtful. She often gifted people items, specializing particularly in handcrafted cakes from her bakery. Upon first glance, she was easy to dismiss as a stereotypical quiet girl, as she tended to steer clear of avoidable conflict and was always polite and friendly with everyone she came across, but in actuality, there was far more to her than met the eye.
  </p>
  <p key="f628dc28-8c8b-4f96-b659-5aae97c47dac">
   While she did often keep to herself, she was by no means a pushover. She was independent, resilient, and very strong-willed, believing firmly in her morals and having no qualms with standing up to and speaking out against those she saw as enemies. When

   took charge of L'Manberg, she was very vocal with her disapproval, heedless of the danger that she was putting herself in, and later pledged her full loyalty to

   Tubbo
   in order to retake the country. A lot of the time, she felt overlooked and unnoticed by everyone, but kept this hidden, leading to her rising feelings of internal resentment. Although not intrusive, she has always been very observant and curious, and watches things that intrigue her until they are out of sight.

   All of her negative resentments have finally begun to spill, resulting in a harsh change in her former beliefs of forgiveness over revenge. She now actively seeks reparations from the person she thinks wronged her, and is desperate to be recognized for herself for once in her life. In these pursuits, she has even been partnering with Techno's Syndicate, despite her former allegiance against him.

   After working with Jack for a long while, Niki had a change of heart. She realized that her anger at Tommy was only because of the built up emotions of other events. Such as her partner, Puffy, not speaking to her and Wilbur dying at the hands of Philza. These things led her to direct the anger at an easy target - Tommy.

  <p key="fb90eba3-3810-4010-a096-39436ee167d8">
   Despite these realizations, Niki still wishes to be recognized for what she had done for everyone. She still believes that the old members of L'Manberg do not appreciate what she had sacrificed and done for them. Wishing to find people who will understand and care for her, Niki joins her old enemy - Technoblade. Her ideals change to anarchist ones, but she also wishes to rekindle her old L'Manberg habits.

When it failed, she went to the boxing match with the others and watched everyone fight it all out, much to her disgust. Deciding to take a break she walked to the nearest ender chest where she put her sword. Looking up, she saw Tommy standing opposite her and immediately returned to the boxing, as if she saw nothing.

She herself was then caught in the crossfire and returned to find Wilbur fighting with Tommy. She tried to speak to him, but was forced to return back to the podium for Schlatt's second speech.

   The next couple of weeks were relatively uneventful for Niki, save for her date with Captain Puffy. It began when Puffy gifted her a red poppy. She accepted it with gratitude, and the two then went together to the
   Holy Land
   , where Puffy had pre-arranged a picnic spot for them. It consisted of a classic red and white carpet surrounded by sunflowers and roses. There was a lantern at each corner as well as rendered images of Niki's IRL pets, Zuko and Toph. The food they shared was lettuce, baked potatoes, pie, and "champagne." Niki was openly enthusiastic and heartfelt about the date, and they were able to joke and laugh about a mistake in the images' plugin, setting them off on a good start.
  </p>
  <p key="1daa1c74-ab7c-4031-92c8-c76f3a49af73">
   Their main goal was to build something together once they'd finished their picnic. After a brief discussion, they decided to visit Niki's bakery while they asked Niki's chat for suggestions on what to build. They eventually narrowed it down to either a cottage, a coffee shop, or a flower shop, and ultimately decided on a
   flower shop
   .

  <p key="19100205-b074-4954-9031-acc72dead489">
   Whilst mapping out the location, Tommy and Ranboo came past, the two tried to get out of Niki's vision but she quickly spotted them. Both Tommy and Ranboo were acting awkwardly and seemed to be confused. Puffy and Niki brushed it off as their normal behavior.
  </p>
  <p key="907b8777-4425-4659-9045-90fb0583410e">
   Later, Niki and Puffy both witnessed Ranboo and Tommy burning down

   house, but neither of them knew it was George's or the significance of this. So they returned to the Flower Shop.They enjoyed building it together, and although Fundy and Ranboo later jokingly attempted a takeover, the two women defended their shop, leading the other two to instead build a rivaling ice cream shop nearby.
  </p>
  <p key="3250da4a-8a0f-428d-aa2e-1a6c9b98458c">
   Things seemed to be going pretty well until Dream showed up. Dream started asking them odd questions, such as where the border was drawn between

   and L'Manberg. They answered to the best of their ability, but were then shocked when he began building an obsidian wall around the borders. He didn't directly answer any of their questions, which they found to be unsettling, as Puffy was a member of the SMP while Niki was not. They informed Tubbo, Fundy, and Ranboo of the turn of events, and Tubbo declared that he would meet with Dream to discuss what was happening. Their date ended on unsure terms, but Puffy gave Niki a "promise ring," stating that she was happy with the date. The ring was later destroyed in a creeper explosion, much to Niki's dismay.

   Niki was beginning to suffer consequences similar to Schlatt's rule. She had no armour or weapons because they had all be stolen and never had a say in anything despite being a member of the cabinet. Her bakery business was at an all-time low, despite being promised a better life under Tubbo's rule. She was beginning to lose faith in everyone, but always kept her happy persona on in public.

   As Niki would later learn, the conflict was because Tommy and Ranboo had burned down George's house, and since George was the then-king of the SMP, Dream interpreted it as an act of war on L'Manberg's behalf. Ranboo's involvement was mostly kept quiet, and so Tommy took the fall for the damage and was exiled to avoid war between the nations. This caused the

  </p>
  <p key="3030fe35-f091-4947-9948-e1684c971aa2">
   During the early stages of the trial, Tommy blamed the burning of the house on her, but it was disproven quickly due to her being on a date with Puffy all day. That was why him and Ranboo were acting oddly earlier, and Niki felt betrayed that they wanted to blame everything on her. Niki came forward with her case that she and Puffy saw him do it, but nobody listened to her points and ignored the fact that there were two eyewitnesses.

  <p key="cd0575ad-91f2-4f3f-b211-04aad9777e30">
   Niki visited Tommy once with Fundy during his exile, but she was rather upset with him for not having thought of L'Manberg as a whole, blaming his actions on her for no reason and for putting her relationship with Puffy at risk. She never came to see him on any other occasions, deciding that he could deal with the consequences of his actions himself.

   Niki recieved a message from Tubbo that her fox, Mushroom, had died of a stroke whilst being transported by him back from Pogtopia. She was upset, but didn't blame Tubbo because it had happened of natural causes. Later, Fundy joined the two of them and told Niki that Tubbo had killed Mushroom and was lying, but Tubbo denied this. Fundy later approached her and they could build a new city together in 'Australia'. Tubbo was sad to see them go, but understood their mindset.

   Ranboo came along with them, and the three walked for about a thousand blocks before Fundy told them he'd forgotten the co-ordinates. Annoyed by this, Niki and Ranboo left Fundy to continue searching for the place. Dry Waters hasn't been mentioned since, and Niki moved permanently into her Underground City.

   Niki returned to L'Manberg after some time away alone in time to catch the festival that Tubbo had planned out in an attempt to assassinate Dream. She participated in party games alongside her friends and former co-citizens, including Puffy, Fundy, Eret, and Ranboo. She found, much to her disappointment, that people were still ignoring her and speaking over her.
  </p>
  <p key="7a8c637a-c0d2-4645-a4ce-9ec9f64ef8d4">
   She followed along with the crowd, however, and witnessed the confrontation between Tubbo, Dream, Technoblade, and Tommy at the destroyed

    Community House

   . As Niki watched Tubbo and Tommy fight it out, she seemed upset that her allies were arguing, but soon began to smile and walked away from the Community House, not bothering to witness the outcome. Niki heard that the fighting had stopped and she stands on the path nearby, overhearing what was happening. She was angry to see Tommy so easily allowed back into L'Manberg, especially after seemingly condemning the country to the mercy of Techno and Dream, and expressed resentment towards him for all of the lies he'd told and mistakes he'd made in the past. She yelled from the crowd at him, and everyone teamed up on her to shut down her feelings of self-doubt. Tommy even called her stupid for doubting everyone. Niki felt like it mirrored the first festival, where she stood up to Schlatt and everyone else shut her down, and that time she was right.
  </p>
  <p key="ab3c4755-c707-4ffc-95bc-ecba83c0afd8">
   She was upset at the reveal of Ranboo's treachery, and at first argued with him after his outburst regarding sides, but soon came to wonder if he was making a valid point after all. She was disappointed as she listened to Tommy and Tubbo's speeches about taking down Dream. She was no longer a member of L'Manberg herself, and was often ignored despite being one of the founding members of L'Manberg along with Tommy, Tubbo, Fundy, Wilbur and Jack Manifold. Niki was starting to feel more and more distant from her former country, thinking that perhaps much conflict could be avoided if L'Manberg were not around at all.

  <p key="385bae40-ae39-4e64-868d-1b1c071b90d0">
   After all was said and done, and they were given a single day to prepare, she returned to her prior business and talked with Eret and Jack Manifold, where she was able to cool off. Along with Fundy and a few others, she aimed to follow in Ranboo's footsteps and get the entire server to unite together, proving that personal relationships are more important than obligations or sides. She also formulated an "upcoming goal" of her own, although she told no one what it was. She started changing her secret city into a secret library to store anything that can help her accomplish her own means. While her intentions are not fully known, she

   On the day of the attack, Niki announced that she would not fight, and would instead allow L'Manberg to be destroyed, as she wanted everyone else to open their eyes and see that the country's current state was nowhere near what it had been intended to be. The way she saw it, it was no longer about freedom or peace, and that was all she had ever wanted from it. All of the conflict was around this one place, and these people so maybe if the symbol of hope was gone, then they'd stop the fighting and the killing.
  </p>
  <p key="2be53313-ef53-468c-a8d8-222c3702208d">
   Before the war began, she apologized to Ranboo for lashing out at him the day before, and joined together with Fundy after he stated that he agreed with her assessment and destroyed a large amount of L'Manberg's stored materials. However, as they walked together, Niki seemed uncomfortable with how maniacal Fundy was acting, and how he'd laugh every time she said something.

  <p key="13a9905c-3a65-4a4f-8cd7-c1bcf467556c">
   She also had a few hushed words with Puffy before being interrupted by Tubbo. Once both had left, Niki expressed a desire to protect Puffy despite the amount of chaos which had gone down since their last date.

   During the majority of the fighting, Niki watched from the sidelines, occasionally dropping her own TNT on any areas that she saw had not yet been demolished. A little way through, Quackity confronted her about doing nothing. She ignored him and laughed at the idea for fighting for L'Manberg. Afterwards, she went into some underground tunnels underneath L'Manberg and placed TNT underneath before igniting it.

She afterwards found a high perch and watched L'Manberg burn from above, delivering her own soliloquy.

Still begrudging Tommy nearly everything that had happened during her time on the server, Niki worked with Jack on a revenge plot, the goal being to lure him onto the test site and get him killed. Thus far, they have worked out that Niki will pretend to befriend Tommy by claiming that Dream had manipulated her into burning the L'Mantree down. In an effort to get on his good side, she started constructing a cobblestone tower containing pictures of Vikkstar and the Queen of England.

   Niki continued building her city underground, wanting less contact with other people as she feels all they will do is either die or betray her. She refuses to eat food anymore, and whenever she gets hungry just jumps off a ledge to reset her food bar. She also suffers from insomnia although she calls it 'night terrors'. The lack of sleep sometimes causes her to hallucinate. Her bedroom looks like a jail cell, with bars across the front to stop her from sleepwalking.

   Niki also wants to build a jungle and aquarium in the city so she can be outside without having the fear of other people noticing her. However, over time her carefully planned-out city began to grow disconnected and chaotic, with random things strewn everywhere. Due to her lack of sleep and food, Niki has devoted a lot of time to writing in her diary. Whenever she wakes up or thinks of something she sits down and starts writing and talking to her diary, as if it is a real person. She has desks and books everywhere in the city so she can sit and write whenever she wants to not feel alone.

Sapnap insisted they all went to MacDonalds instead of checking out the alarm, meaning she couldn't leave. The others began robbing the MacDonald's stall jokingly and throwing food at eachother as Niki grew frustrated when Sam arrived. Sam instructed everyone to run to the prison as Dream had broken out and they were overpowered, acting shocked and they all ran when suddenly Tommy joined vc as panicked as the rest of them, others followed after. They all arrived at the prison confused and shouting one another whilst Niki watched silently, Sam was teleported away and Tommy took charge. Eryn became suspicious of Niki and began interrogating her, but Tommy interupted them and Eryn rode away with the others. Niki set off many withers as Dream escaped to outside the prison. Sapnap ambushed Niki as she went to set up one and informed the others as she ran for her life.

   In her haste she escaped to L'Manberg and used the portal to return to go to the Nether, only to spot everyone in pursuit of the others running down the path. Sapnap and Eryn found Niki and chased her through the portal to
   Logstedshire
   where they lost her although Sapnap got her pickaxe. Confused, Niki searched Logstedshire, wondering what it was and found its blown up remenants as well as a pile of blue left by Ghostbur, she silently returned to the Nether and then to Techno's house.

   Niki found
   Connor
   there but not Ranboo. She was informed that Ranboo had been killed in the escape and she was horrified. Connor accepted Techno's invitation to join the Syndicate before leaving to build a dirt house nearby and the three discussed how weird it was that he was in prison and had full netherite despite that. Connor returned and the four sat down to discuss things further. Techno showed Niki a picture Ranboo gave to him before he died and it was a picture of

   Jack Manifold later came to see her in her city. He questioned her about what she had done that day. and she initially gave vague answers but soon broke down saying she had to help Ranboo and that she wished that it had never gotten to the Withers. The two argued with Jack saying she shouldn't have let Dream out for Ranboo and her saying she couldn't let Ranboo stay in there. Jack asked why Niki would help Techno with his favour and Niki argued he was his friend leading to this confrontation: "Techno- he's my friend!" "Wasn't I? Wasn't everyone?"
  </p>
  <p key="61f3efa3-eae9-4d7e-ad53-e1b715b03ab4">
   After they stopped arguing, Jack told Niki about where he'd been and said that he felt that the world was against him but Niki was the only one who seemed to agree with him. They soon argued again, but this time over the value of their friendship. Niki admitted to Jack that she never tried to look for him, but that she was busy and he wasn't the centre of attention and she wasn't going to help him as she felt like she tried her best to do what's right - get Ranboo out of prison. As the two continued, emotions ran high until Niki gave in and said she only wanted to give people happy lives and second chances and that she wanted Jack to help her in her underground city of peace, he didn't have to be involved with Technoblade anymore and he didn't have to run away. The two made up and apologised, accepting their own flaws and Jack gave Niki the co-ordinates to New Manifold Land so they could keep in touch.

      Niki and Puffy went on a date in late November, allowing them to know about each other more.  Along with building a flower shop together, Puffy gave Niki a diamond "Promise Ring." It is easy to see that their relationship is positive. During the Doomsday War, Niki expressed her claims to not let Puffy die and save her. However, Puffy fought for L'Manberg which Niki betrayed by burning down L'Mantree.

       Niki has said she tried to get in contact with Puffy, but she never replied. Unbeknownst to Niki, it was because she was dealing with a problem with the egg. This led her to feel abandoned by Puffy. During the Red Banquet however, the two seemed closer - dancing together and talking.

      Dream and Niki had a relatively neutral relationship until they took opposite sides during the
      Pogtopia Manberg War
      . Since then, Niki had shown a consistent dislike towards Dream. Due to her stance in the

      , their relationship is probably neutral. However, Niki plotted to kill him and helped imprison him so threat soured their relationship. Niki did briefly consider the notion of seeking some form of aid from Dream in her efforts against Tommyinnit after failing to assassinate him with a nuclear weapons test initiated by Jack Manifold. However, this was largely out of desperation. After she learned that Dream killed Tommy, she is much happier that the outcome is temporarily satisfied. However, following her change of heart and forgiveness towards Tommy, Niki's previous opinions on dream had returned and she disliked him once more.

       Hoping to help her friend Technoblade, Niki helped break Dream out of Pandora's Vault by providing distractions to cover the breakout. She does not seem to have any outward reservations about this, and when later confronted about her role by Jack she makes no negative references to Dream (even implying she is unsure of her views on him, as she also feels they had also gotten it wrong with their hatred of Tommy). Niki also tells Jack that being her friend won't require him to be involved with "the Syndicate, Techno, or Dream" implying that she remains open to being involved with Dream again in the future, at least if her friends need her to be. At present, she doesn't seem to harbor much animosity towards him, but is likely still cautiously uncertain.

      Niki first met Eryn outside McPuffy's while she was trying to distract the group he was with from the then ongoing prisonbreak of Dream, initiated by the Syndicate. She welcomed Eryn to the server and the two exchanged pleasantries. Following this, things turned briefly sour as suspicion of Niki's behavior grew, and the alarms at the prison were confirmed to have been tripped. When Niki was ultimately exposed by Sapnap trying to spawn Withers to cover the escape of Dream and Technoblade, Eryn would eventually persue her with the others. However, in a callback to their earlier amiability, Eryn passed up the chance to prevent Niki's escape, allowing her to run right past him in the nether, and reach an exit portal. Eryn repeatedly crouched to show his friendly intent, and Niki returned the gesture as she waited to travel through the portal. Recognizing his help in her getting away, Niki is likely currently on positive terms with Eryn.

    "Dear Friend. I hope this letter finds you well. By the time you will read this, I will be long gone, so don't come looking for me. Don't worry— we shall see each other soon, but I am writing to you in hopes you can bring out my word to the people. L'Manberg lies in shambles. The election is over and Schlatt has come to power. [...] Our once beloved nation has turned into a nightmare on Earth. He tore down our walls, wanting to expand into enemy territory and took our names from us, renaming L'Manberg

    . He casted out Tommy and Wilbur. [...] Taxed me, took my belongings and threw me into jail for not complying. I managed to escape and am safe for now, but people are looking for me and I don't know what will happen if they find me. Fundy has turned to his side, the man I trusted and being his running mate. The man I thought could be trusted with our nation, the man I went to war with. He burned my flag, our symbol, [...] and rebuilt it in a new nation's name. Now I know that he only wanted power. I don't know who to trust anymore. I feel like everyone has turned against me. Tubbo is standing by Jschlatt's side and he is even wearing his suit. But I will not stand and I will not fall for a selfish leader who does not care for his people and who can only see revenge and hatred. And will do anything to just stay in power. I will not stand and I will not fall for a nation who forgot where they came from. I will not stand and I will not fall for the tyrranist that has taken everything I love. All I know is that Mister JSchlatt is putting way to much on his plate and it is time someone takes it from him. So please, friend, I need your help. JSchlatt has planned a festival and he has invited every citizen on the Dream SMP, L'Manberg, and everyone in between. I don't know what he is trying to achieve. He says he has an announcement, and I don't know what it is. Friend, I need your help, I need you to be there in case anything goes wrong and if anything happens to me, you will have to tell the people if I cannot. I am counting on you, I am trying to come up with a plan, so please follow along, but also, please take care of yourself. I have been emotional before and I know that if I get angry, no one is too strong to get in my way.
