   to make a hotel in his name. He was entrapped with Dream in the prison for at least a week because of a security issue that was brought up while he was visiting. However, after an argument about the Book of Necromancy not being real, it led to Dream killing Tommy, taking his final canon life. Two days later, Dream resurrected Tommy, restoring at least one of his canon lives, although his current amount of lives is unknown.

   After Sam released Tommy from prison, Tommy saw Sam as unfit to be warden of the prison, and aimed to break into the prison to kill Dream once and for all. Tommy failed in this effort, causing Dream to revive Wilbur from the dead. Tommy stuck around Wilbur but later on when Dream escaped the prison, he was alone and mostly is seeking help from Philza currently.

   In a stark contrast to Dream, Tommy has shown a heavy theme of attachment and sentimentality. He cared deeply about his pet cow Henry, and is very protective of the people he cares about.
   He also idolized Wilbur during the early L'Manberg days, becoming his second in command. His attachment to his music discs, especially Cat and Mellohi, was the driving force of the conflict known as

While Tommy went through more phases where he caused trouble for attention, he learned more about the people he cared about.

   Tommy's self-esteem was extremely low likely due to the abuse he had endured, resulting in him finding it hard to believe that Tubbo would ever visit him. As a result, he always shrugged sightings of Tubbo off as hallucinations. He seemed to have grown attached to Dream, needing him as company, as he was always checking what Tommy was up to. He even stated that he "owed everything to Dream" and saw him as a friend.

  <p key="b890d6b3-f9ca-40cc-8f73-fcc50a5fc774">
   Tommy's pride and ego are often seen as parts of selfishness, where he obsessively tries to obtain what he sees as rightfully his with little regard to others' well-being. For example, he willingly gave up the discs to Dream in exchange for L'Manberg's independence,
   but immediately planned to steal them back, as he still saw them as his. This selfishness tends to push people away or annoy people, as much of what he sees as "his" is stolen or belonging to a community.
  </p>
  <p key="892a6a11-c091-4168-8a5c-0ade089fdb76">
   Tommy also tends to be incredibly short-sighted, often charging into conflicts with little resembling a plan or consideration of consequences. This often lands him in deep trouble, where he suddenly becomes reliant on others to bail him out or protect him. As a result of this poor planning, he often comes up short on materials and tools, choosing to steal from others rather than get proper gear for himself. As an additive of this, Tommy often refuses to take accountability for his negative actions, despite making it glaringly obvious that he was the one who committed said action in the first place. His unwillingness to take responsibility for his actions can sometimes stoop as far as to gaslight other people.

   Tommy's mental health had unintentionally been a troublesome issue from the beginning of the fight for L'Manberg's independence, and it had been noticeably on a sharp decline after his second exile. After being exposed and forced into war and battles at a young age, it had been clear Tommy had a longing for the childhood that he and Tubbo lost. To gain back what had been taken away from him, he constantly attempted to substitute it with his discs, playing them on his bench while watching the sunset with Tubbo. In addition to the discs, he continuously committed various crimes with Tubbo. He believed they were mild and just for pure entertainment, but they nevertheless often lead to consequences.

   attempted to keep Tommy sane throughout most of the early parts of the exile, yet Tommy's mental state would continue to go downhill. Dream's manipulation and gaslighting enforcing Tommy's powerlessness and the absences of both Tubbo and L'Manberg were all factors which contributed to Tommy's mental decline. It got so severe that Tommy was implied to be considering suicide on multiple occasions.
   During Quackity's visit on December 14, 2020, he went so far as to attempt to kill himself several times at even minor incidents.
   He also generally engaged in self-destructive behavior, seeming to no longer care about keeping his health bar up, and would walk around on extremely low health,
   even letting mobs hurt him without fighting back. He would also carry hay bales in the Nether to stop fall damage, but refuse to use them and land on the ground with extremely low health.
   Tommy claimed to be unable to sleep at night, and often showed signs of sleepwalking when he could, often walking into the ocean and other bodies of water and being on the verge of drowning whenever he logged onto the server.
   He described this to Quackity, and also said he "never woke up from the nightmare that was life."

  <p key="414dbe2a-62b3-4407-a251-8ce5cbd6f0b7">
   Tommy would often receive gifts from his friends from outside of exile.
   However, Tommy would consistently insist that these gifts were out of pity and not genuine friendship.
   This mindset contributed to Tommy's inevitable belief that no one cared about him, which was only further pushed by Dream, who insisted that this was true.

  <p key="d6ca2861-46c7-42a8-8479-ee7dbcb2e773">
   Tommy's friendships weren't the only thing that Dream manipulated. Dream negatively influenced Tommy in many ways. He sabotaged the beach party invites Ghostbur sent to the people of L'Manberg, acted as if he were Tommy's only friend, and almost daily would gather Tommy's gear and weapons to destroy them.
   This was all a part of an elaborate plan to keep Tommy powerless, but since only Dream would keep Tommy company, he believed Dream to be his only friend, even saying that he owed everything to him.
   He also had to endure gaslighting from Dream.

  <p key="13a5bbff-c42f-4280-9515-d329b2aca0b4">
   Tommy also showed signs of post-traumatic stress. He stated that Wilbur inviting Tommy to be the "bad guys" during his spiral in Pogtopia was all he could think about as he tried to sleep.

  <p key="b47b6768-dfa7-4d64-bf73-2d8ed180fdf4">

   After leaving Logstedshire to live with Technoblade, Tommy's mental health drastically improved, and he started to act similarly to the way he had done pre-exile. His skin returned back to normal, his eyes regained their color, and he found that he'd gotten back the "pep in his step." Tommy also began to mention how things like the lava no longer were affecting him. He openly said that he was aware Dream had been manipulating him during his time in Logstedshire, yet couldn't help but want to come back to him.
  </p>
  <p key="2511894f-a647-4d06-966e-40be89aac953">
   Though, despite his mental health vastly improving whilst living with Techno, he still appeared to hold some regret for deserting Dream, voicing that he wished to see him again. Tommy also still had repetitive issues with how he felt about Dream, stating that thinking about him confused him.
   Later on, Tommy also stated that he "didn't like who he was around Dream."
  </p>
  <p key="02c48d11-6fd6-4c03-860c-08c88ae0db7f">
   During this period, Tommy began to experience anxiety and PTSD-like symptoms when returning to locations that held trauma from his past. Tommy's thoughts tends to get disjointed, which showed when he talked—he often sounded panicked and confused. He described this to Techno as his "head getting all spinny," and relied on him to tell him what to do in these situations. When Techno showed Tommy where he'd been able to escape from after his attempted execution, Tommy was horrified to find that it was the
   Final Control Room
   .
   This was the place where he and the other L'Manbergians had originally been betrayed by

   </a>
   . Tommy could barely explain anything when Techno repeatedly asked him what had happened—all he could manage to say was that he didn't want to be there. He was struck by a similar scenario when he and Techno traveled back to Logstedshire, and was unable to stay there for very long before needing to leave.

  <p key="8d1aaedd-27bd-409e-a5d2-7d2b8bd660f5">

   Despite winning back his lifelong friend, Tubbo, Tommy still suffers from trust issues due to Eret and Wilbur, freezing in fright when he discovered that Ghostbur was serious when he said that he wanted Wilbur to come back. During the first attempt in resurrecting Wilbur, Tommy seemed scared even, whispering out Wilbur's name and muttering, "oh no..." He then raged, crying out for Ghostbur's name and holding onto the blue that Ghostbur held. It's obvious Tommy is more comfortable with Ghostbur than Wilbur, and doesn't want him to return. Though Ghostbur wanted to bring back Wilbur, Tommy decided that he didn't want to take part in this, and left.

   Despite most of the server allied with Tommy against Dream, many people were planning to kill Tommy for their own benefit.

Though it seems that Sam failed at getting Tommy's trust, as he had left Tommy to die by Dream when Tommy was visiting him. And leaving Ghostbur behind with Dream and forcing Tommy to not go there or else he would kill him. But it seems that Tommy sees

   After completing the Big Innit Hotel, Tommy went to visit Dream in what he believed would be the final time, stating he wanted to "close the book" and move on.
   As he went through the prison, he made even more comments which implied he suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to the trauma caused by Dream and all the wars. However, as he was visiting Dream, TNT was set off in an unknown location around the prison, causing security issues. These security issues lead to Tommy being trapped with Dream, which caused him to spiral into what strongly resembled a panic attack.
  </p>
  <p key="fd91fa47-f2ba-475b-b0ba-510d4d03b891">
   This scene is very implicative that Tommy suffers from claustrophobia, the fear of tight spaces. Alternatively, due to him not reacting in such a manner during his previous visit, it could be Tommy panicking over the realization that he may be trapped with Dream for up to a week, which Dream makes sure to remind him is similar to his exile.
  </p>
  <p key="a93cbb82-95ed-4c3c-a9ed-13b4a9304195">
   After a week of being trapped in prison, Tommy started making fun of Dream and told him that he had seen Jschlatt's grave. Dream then told him to go see Jschlatt personally, and killed Tommy, taking his last canon life away by punching Tommy to death.
   After Tommy got revived by Dream,
   it seemed that Tommy got PTSD when Dream punched or even pinched Tommy,
   screaming in pain of what Dream had done to take Tommy's final canon life. Due to this, Tommy now knows that Dream has power, even being scared more than ever when Dream wanted Tommy back into the afterlife for more information about life and death.

   After a number of days locked in the prison, Sam came to visit Dream and found Tommy. Tommy then began to freak out, alerting Sam who then let Tommy out, much to Dream's displeasure. Tommy still has PTSD, as he screams every time he gets hurt, saying how he wants to be on full hearts all the time. He also shows many symptoms of C-PSTD. He does not like it when anyone holds some sort of weapon. He reunited with Tubbo after leaving the prison and he refused to talk about his death, and stresses out every time someone brings it up.

   When chopping down logs in the nether, he was suddenly attacked by a number of piglins. He experienced extreme PTSD as he said "F*CK YOU" several times to the piglins, referencing his remembrance of how Dream killed him.

   After the second death of his cow, Henry, he seemed to revert back to his old tendencies from his second exile, staring into lava and stating that it is "too much." He also seems to react less to damage after Henry's death, but that might just be the content creator who plays him forgetting to act it out. On the other hand, this may be another sign of him regressing back to his exile mentality, as during exile he often didn't care about or even welcomed damage. However, he did reach out to CaptainPuffy for therapy, so there may be an improvement in his mental health sometime in the future if he goes through with it.
  </p>
  <p key="bde7c456-4164-4cdb-a78e-6ea610c0f918">
   It is also implied that Tommy has extreme paranoia due to these traumatic events. For instance, he takes ownership of the Holy Lands due to claiming that it was for resources like diamonds. However, it may instead be due to him wanting to regain some control with his life. This paranoia is further implied when visiting Quackity's new nation, during which he willingly helps Wilbur with a headquarters instead of joining Quackity due to the former promising safety.

Tommy had always looked up to Wilbur, but after Wilbur revealed his plan to blow up Manberg, the two started to grow apart. Tommy considered Tubbo the only person he could trust, as they were very close friends. Tommy wanted to save Manberg and restore it to L'Manberg instead of destroying everything, so he started a plan attempting to convince Wilbur to abandon his plans of blowing up the nation. Tommy mined a giant hole, the

   After Manberg surrendered, Tommy watched Schlatt as he drank alcohol and took more drugs and protein supplements. Tommy aimed the bow at Schlatt, ready to assassinate him. However, Schlatt suddenly died of what was presumed to be a heart attack or a stroke.

  <p key="559fd625-a671-4c77-a011-b7e9b4963658">
   Tommy was named President of the newly re-established L'Manberg by Wilbur. However Tommy did not want power and gave the position to Wilbur, who then passed it to Tubbo. Tommy congratulated Tubbo on his promotion, and Tubbo responded by naming Tommy Vice President.

   However, Technoblade, who opposed any form of government, then assassinated Tubbo, shocking and angering Tommy.

Technoblade accused Tommy of taking power and continuing the same dictatorship that Schlatt had established. Technoblade then told Tommy a story about Theseus, a mythical Greek hero who killed the Minotaur but was exiled in disgust by the townspeople and died alone. Technoblade ended the conversation by telling Tommy that he would have nothing against him for being a hero only if he was to die like one. Techno then summoned two withers.

Tommy managed to do a substantial amount of damage to the withers before being killed by Technoblade. Tommy's items were retrieved by Philza, who had just logged onto the server and killed Wilbur, taking Wilbur's last canon life. Tommy then pleaded for Technoblade not to kill Tubbo once more, for it would just be a pity kill by then. Techno, satisfied with the results, left, and Tommy then told everyone who supported New L'Manberg to head to the L'Mantree. There, Tommy gave a speech about comradery, friendship, and a united L'Manberg to bring the members together and motivate members to rebuild.

Tommy disliked the fact that Tubbo was being too passive and hadn't politically changed much of L'Manberg.

   In retaliation against the griefing, Dream began building obsidian walls around L'Manberg. After being confronted by Tubbo and other members of the cabinet on November 29, 2020, Tommy was taken into custody and accused of the crime.
   The L'Manberg administration held a trial, Tommy stuck with their plan and blamed Nihachu, but she had an alibi. After some more arguing, Tommy was found to be guilty. During the trial, Tommy defended Ranboo, claiming that he had done it alone. Tubbo decided to give a sentence of two weeks of probation, though Dream was unsatisfied and wanted Tommy to be exiled. Dream gave the administration a few days to reconsider the punishment, and Tommy remained in his probation for the period.

  <p key="1d441e45-5dd2-4dd3-af3a-cd263f7d92a6">
   Days later on December 2, 2020, the L'Manberg administration held a meeting with Dream in the Holy Land to negotiate Tommy's punishment.
   During the meeting, Tubbo, Tommy, and Dream signed a treaty that put Tommy under probation for three more weeks; if Tommy misbehaved, he would be under probation until he was eighteen, and the walls would be doubled. Dream was happy with the agreement, but Tommy wasn't satisfied and revealed his possession of Spirit's leather. Tommy then threatened him into taking down the wall immediately, saying that Dream had no longer had any actual leverage over him anymore. Dream appeared to start taking down the walls, but he then lashed out and stated that he only cared about Tommy's discs. Dream demanded that Tommy be exiled and gave the administration another three days to decide or face the consequence of the wall.

   On December 4, 2020, the day of the decision, Tommy and the cabinet met up to make their final decision.
   Tommy suggested that they engage in a large conflict in order to take Dream down for good, citing that very few people on the server were actually willing to side with him, and that they could contact the Badlands or Technoblade to aid them in the effort. Everyone was hesitant at first, especially Tubbo, but after more of Tommy's persuasion, everyone agreed to the idea.

   Upon meeting with Dream, Tubbo made the last minute decision to exile Tommy without the consent of Fundy and Quackity, stating that a conflict wasn't what was best for the nation and that siding with Technoblade would be a mistake.

   After the decision was made, Tommy was escorted out by Dream. Ghostbur followed the two. After reaching a new location, Dream forced Tommy to destroy all his items and built a shack for Tommy to reset his spawn. Tommy complied with Dream's demands, and by the end of the day, Ghostbur had built a new settlement that they named Logstedshire, or Logsted for short. Dream constantly visited to check up on Tommy and destroy his items.
   In addition, Dream used the opportunity to manipulate Tommy's emotions, putting himself in a positive light and painting himself as Tommy's friend.

  <p key="481f650b-7969-499f-8402-59e2e5cad3b6">
   At first, many members of the server visited Tommy in Logstedshire and left gifts.
   Initially, Tommy accepted them and maintained good relationships. However, Tommy quickly began to consider them pity gifts. In addition, Dream discovered the gifts and forced Tommy to destroy them. Ranboo often visited Logsted and set up a secret mail system where they could share
   letters
   . Through this, Tommy communicated his emotions while Ranboo shared the events occurring in L'Manberg and Dream SMP. This connection, combined with Ranboo's neutrality, allowed them to develop a positive relationship that was more resistant against Dream's manipulation. Eventually, Tommy decided to build a secret underground storage area for some gifts and valuables.

  <p key="cafe1ce1-a81d-4ff6-a96e-4ea12d717d4c">
   During his exile, Tommy deeply missed Tubbo. He often saw visions of Tubbo, cried over past images of them together, and expressed concern over any conflict happening to Tubbo. Despite Tommy's emotions for Tubbo, Tubbo did not visit Tommy as he believed Tommy did not want to see him, ultimately leading to some disconnect between the two and allowing for Dream to paint a negative perception.
  </p>
  <p key="5e08cc98-d53c-4af1-8cd6-034dcdf1fa23">
   Tommy's perception of other members was further fractured after their failure to attend his beach party. The beach party was planned by Tommy with the help of Ghostbur and Dream as an event for Tommy to connect with the other members, but Dream had disrupted the distribution of invitations by misleading Ghostbur, leading to Tommy being alone and developing mostly negative perceptions of members other than Dream. After the events of the beach party, Tommy only considered Dream a true friend, even fracturing his relationship with Ranboo.
  </p>
  <p key="b6cbfd91-94a4-4acf-8a2b-2da03a509651">
   Over time, Tommy's mental health began to decay due to his isolation. Ranboo and a few other members attempted to help him, but Tommy was severely scarred by the failure of his beach party. Tommy started considering fighting back and defying his exile, but he ultimately was unable to gain courage to do so. During his last days, Tommy was visited by

   On December 15, 2020, the day after Drista's visit, Tommy expressed his desire for death to Dream and continued with his daily routine.
   However, Dream discovered Tommy's secret room and blew up Logstedshire, forcing Tommy to restart his exile. After Dream left, Tommy started building a tower to commit suicide. Atop the tower, Tommy fought his emotions and eventually realized that he had been freed from Logstedshire. He jumped into a water pool and fled the area before deciding to locate
   Technoblade's cabin
   . There, Tommy realized that he could stay there and leach off of Techno's supplies. He then dug
   an area
   under the cabin, hoping to stay hidden from Dream and Technoblade while having access to supplies.

    Technoblade's execution
   </a>
   on December 16, 2020, Technoblade returned to find Tommy wandering around his cabin.
   Tommy attempted to hide, but Techno had already noticed him and dug into Dnret. After much bantering, Technoblade proposed an alliance for Tommy where Tommy would aid Techno in destroying L'Manberg, and Techno would help Tommy regain his discs. Techno attempted to persuade Tommy that Tubbo was corrupted by government and used it as an excuse to destroy L'Manberg. However, Tommy wanted to protect the country since it was Tubbo's goal to protect the nation, maintaining a protective stance of Tubbo. Eventually, Tommy reluctantly agreed to the alliance after Techno toned it down to "terrorism." As an ally, Tommy gained access to Technoblade's resources. The two worked together to gain more resources and plotted their course of action.

   During his time in the Arctic, Tommy reconnected with Ghostbur and Ranboo. The two explained their circumstances and defended themselves after the events in Logstedshire. Eventually, Tommy started forgiving the two.

  <p key="58e3c7ea-9bb0-425c-bfb9-4e0550ff5738">
   Together, Tommy and Techno made secret trips to L'Manberg and terrorized the nation. Each visit, they worked on developing a
   secret hound army
   underneath the nation. Upon being inquired by Dream on the whereabouts of Tommy, Technoblade denied any knowledge. However, Dream deducted that Techno had been sheltering Tommy and revealed his knowledge. Dream chose to not take direct action, informing Techno that he didn't need to since he only needed to keep Tommy in exile. Nevertheless, Tommy and Techno continued their secret trips to L'Manberg and terrorized citizens in order to regain Techno's items. During one visit, the two caused enough chaos to be noticed by Dream. Dream met the two on their return at the community nether portal, and he attempted to manipulate Tommy into following him. However, due to the alliance, Techno defended Tommy, asking if Dream wanted to cash in his favor from the execution to gain custody of Tommy. Dream gave up and allowed the two to leave, and Tommy stated that Dream was powerless and feared him.

  <p key="fff5d798-6e5b-4ca0-9b34-0fbca59954ad">
   After more trips to L'Manberg, Techno eventually started to gain a positive perception of Tommy and extended a formal invitation to join him in his quest to destroy L'Manberg. Previously, Techno stated that he had previously thought of Tommy as weak character, but over time, Tommy demonstrated his strength and courage. However, refusing the idea of destroying L'Manberg, Tommy stated that he simply only wanted the alliance for regaining his discs. Despite this, the two still maintained a strong relationship and worked together as allies.

   Technoblade believed Tommy was worthy of his respect and trust, so he gave him his Axe of Peace before going into the parts of the Greater Dream SMP.

   However, when they went in, they saw that the Community House was destroyed, and that Dream was blaming Tommy for it, even though he had had nothing to do with it. Dream also said that he knew Tommy had been here, breaking his exile. Tommy and Techno then went in and revealed themselves to the whole crowd. Dream asked Tubbo to give him the second disc. Just as Tubbo prepared to do so, Tommy interrupted them. Tubbo and Tommy had a spat over the whole situation, with Tubbo blaming Tommy for going to L'Manberg during his exile and Tommy yelling at Tubbo for betraying him, saying that the discs were worth more than Tubbo ever was.
  </p>
  <p key="15efdb11-6a85-417e-bac8-182e038b1f00">
   Tommy then realised what he'd done, and reflected that he didn't like who he had become. He told Tubbo to give the disc to Dream and said that he wanted to side with Tubbo, breaking off the agreement with Techno. Techno respected his decision, and asked for his axe back as Tommy was no longer judged worthy. Tommy refused to give it back, asserting that his worth came from himself alone, attacking Techno using the same tools, food, and armor Techno had given. Tubbo announced that Tommy was no longer exiled and was a member of L'Manberg; however, multiple citizens did not forgive his past of griefing and lies.

   January 6, 2021, was the day of the final confrontation for L'Manberg.
   Calling back to the day before, Tommy promised to talk to Sapnap beforehand. Before they met up, Tommy swam around in the ocean, hoping to find Mars, although he knew it was unlikely. However, he managed to encounter Mars swimming near the shore, and collected him in a bucket. Running over to Sapnap to the Community House, Tommy apologized for everything he had done. He recognized his mistakes, and tried to fix them by handing Mars to him. Tommy told Sapnap that he did not have to accept his request, but he would greatly appreciate it. Sapnap accepted his request, keeping his calm composure, although it was clear he was overjoyed.

   Technoblade arrived at L'Manberg early and spawned his Withers, taking the L'Manbergians by surprise. He had also brought the Hound Army with him to distract the L'Manbergians while Dream prepared to start detonating TNT from his grid in the sky.

  <p key="c391e8fe-d9c6-47f3-a2fd-51128e1c0fc3">
   As Dream dropped the TNT from his TNT grid above, Tommy and Techno began to argue with each other, shouting across the battlefield, whilst Tubbo listened. Technoblade told Tommy that the latter had never thought of Technoblade as a friend, simply using him as a weapon, seeing him only as "The Blade." Tommy shot back, saying that they had spent hours together, but was interrupted by Technoblade shouting back to not speak to him of loyalty. Tommy continued to call Technoblade "selfish," but after Technoblade killed Tubbo for being the president, and when Tommy told him that he had killed Tubbo when he wasn't the president, he told Tommy that back at

   , both him and Wilbur hadn't stepped forward to save Tubbo as Technoblade was being peer pressured, instead watching. Techno further explained how he was willing to fight a 1v30 to protect Tommy. After arguing for a few more minutes, Technoblade attacked Quackity for having actual armor, ending the argument. Soon after, Tommy and Tubbo were killed and respawned elsewhere, further from L'Manberg as the bed next to them had been destroyed. Both Tommy and Technoblade felt betrayed by each other after the conflict.
  </p>
  <p key="2edaf3be-fb45-4515-87b4-0c5c9e18ad14">
   Although Tommy tried to protect the home he cared about with Techno's own gear, many people had no longer cared for the nation and supported the riddance of it. He repeatedly muttered to himself, "L'Manberg is gone." To Tommy and Tubbo, the unfinished symphony will forever remain unfinished; to Fundy, Niki, and others, the symphony wasn't worth finishing. He lost all hope when he saw the L'Mantree had been burned down by someone, who was revealed to be Niki. Tommy, Tubbo, Ghostbur, Fundy and Quackity sang the L'Manberg anthem, though none of them could remember the national anthem in full, and the
   book
   containing the finished anthem had been destroyed in the explosions.
  </p>
  <p key="bc0c65df-c272-4c06-9ea5-12d9ebf2988a">
   To plan the incoming new era, Ghostbur came in to tell Tommy that he wished for Tommy to bring Wilbur back to life. Tommy then sat on the bench outside his house with Quackity, Tubbo, Ghostbur, and Jack Manifold and played the disc that he had played during exile. After the eye of the storm, Tommy had to promise himself that he would fix things.

   Upset at the sight of the ruins of L'Manberg on January 7, 2021, Tommy told himself that he had to continue moving forth, or else all of the effort he had placed into the country that exiled him twice would go to waste.
   He began by searching for Tubbo, and found him at a snowy biome, building

  <p key="eb6d7454-be95-47f4-8b84-e30643eed8aa">
   However, Tommy didn't want to settle down for a vacation home just yet. He told Tubbo that he had set almost everything aside for L'Manberg, for Tubbo, for Wilbur, and many others. Tommy then said that Technoblade didn't have to destroy L'Manberg like he did. He could've just spread his ideas and hopefully converted others to his side. Tubbo agreed with this, and he said "We're getting all philosophical and shit." Considering they only had a week before Dream was going to leave somewhere far away, they had to hurry and finish the Disc War. Tubbo seemed reluctant, wanting to keep his last life as well as Tommy's, but agreed. They returned to the Dream SMP, where they hollowed out and fixed Tommy's basement and embassy. They also began to construct a war room.

   Tommy began his quest for the discs by trying to upgrade his armor. He went to Ponk and Sam for help and they complied with his request. Ponk mentioned that he had found a full set of netherite armor at Techno's base while he was trolling it. Ponk and Sam gave him the resources required and Tommy upgraded his armor to netherite. Tommy then asked if the two knew where the Axe of Peace was, but they did not. Tommy then headed to the Spider XP Farm to enchant his armor, but Ranboo was already at it. Ranboo then enchanted Tommy's gear.

   On January 16, 2021, Tommy logged onto the server at Dream's request.
   He found the area where his house used to be completely destroyed and covered in burning netherrack, with a chest placed in the center that had two signs on top of it. The signs read "Come meet me Wednesday. You and Tubbo ALONE. If anyone else shows up the discs are gone forever." It is presumed that these signs were left by Dream, although it was later heavily implied that the house had been destroyed by Ranboo during another one of his blackouts. Tommy repaired his house and began preparing for a final showdown. He spent hours grinding off camera for resources that would be beneficial for the "final battle." He obtained netherite ingots, diamonds, and forged them into powerful armor, rivaling Dream's own. He enchanted them with the most powerful enchantments and obtained a Sharpness V sword which he enhanced even further.

   On January 19, the day before Tommy and Tubbo were supposed to meet Dream, Tommy toured around the server, talking as if he was sure he would die on Wednesday.
   He wanted to "say goodbye" to the server, and ended up visiting the ruins of George's house, as well as

   January 20, 2021, was the Wednesday Dream's signs had referred to - the day of the final battle for the discs.
   Before they left to meet up with Dream, Tommy and Tubbo had asked each other how they felt. While Tubbo seemed optimistic, Tommy felt uneasy. They discovered most of the SMP members had stood further in front of the Prime Path, where they then said their goodbyes.
  </p>
  <p key="533394e0-757b-41b5-8a43-68955e1d5d04">
   Tommy and Tubbo then followed Dream's compass to
   a mountain in a savanna far away
   . The meeting ended up being a battle between the three of them. However, Dream revealed afterwards that both the discs he had with him were fakes, and threatened to kill Tubbo unless both of them surrendered. Tommy reluctantly agreed and both of them were taken to
   Dream's vault
   , a large underground room that would potentially contain every single valuable item on the server; including the Axe of Peace, Techno's horse Carl, Ghostbur's sheep
   Friend
   , Tommy's cow Henry, Tubbo's fox Squeeks, Skeppy, Sapnap's fish Beckerson and Mars, Purple's dog DogChamp, Sam's dog Fran, Punz's shulker box "Punzo Shulker," a piece of bedrock (either Tommy's or Techno's), Ranboo's cat Enderchest, and of course, Tommy's prized discs, Mellohi and Cat.
  </p>
  <p key="94751534-70a1-4d9d-bff1-380e2f6e9e75">
   After showing him the collection and their spots, he took Tommy back to the main chamber and said to say his final goodbye to Tubbo as Tubbo would be killed and Tommy would be transported to Pandora's Vault. Tommy was reluctant to say goodbye so he tried to stall for time. It turned out to be a blessing, as Punz, Eret, Quackity, Captain Puffy, Callahan, Ranboo, Ponk, HBomb, Nihachu, Jack Manifold, Bad, Antfrost, and Sapnap came out of the portal that would've acted as Dream's escape plan. Dream was pressed back to the collection room where Tommy pulled out Dream's crossbow and boldly stated that Dream wouldn't dare kill him. Tommy then said to Dream to give him all of Dream's items. Dream reluctantly complied and the Nightmare bow, Nightmare sword, Nightmare axe, Nightmare armor set, the shield, the totem of undying, the gapples, the Notch apples, and everything else was given to Tommy. Tommy then killed Dream twice before Dream started begging for his life by saying that he could bring others back to life. Dream asked if Tommy wanted Wilbur back alive, but he already knew his answer. Tommy decided to leave Sam to lock him up in the prison, since he told Tommy he had built the prison; if anyone had to lock him up, it should've been him.

  <p key="869a16a7-b710-4374-adb3-ccb6ef157373">
   The discs finally secured in his enderchest, Tommy and Tubbo walked up to the bench, in disbelief. Their moment of peace was disrupted by what at first seemed to be Ghostbur by Tommy. He had explained that as a result of the weakening of the barrier, Wilbur was to somehow contact Tommy and Tubbo from the afterlife. When Wilbur voiced his pride on Tommy, Tommy skeptically sprouted out questions, refusing to laugh at any jokes from Wilbur and never answering his questions. When Tommy told Wilbur that he had only kept Dream alive to resurrect him, Wilbur shouted out in anger, crying out how he never wanted to be alive again. Wilbur and Tommy argued back and forth until Wilbur's voice faded from them, but not before telling Tommy that he was proud of him. Tommy and Tubbo then awkwardly laugh over the fact that Dream could possibly resurrect Schlatt.

Sam ordered Tommy to make him vow to not giving the security guards all the blame, if any unordinary events such as jailbreaking or the security of Pandora's Vault having complications were to happen. Tommy then proceeded to throw his items in a chest, being given a unique lock or key via a book, and placed his key inside his ender chest.

   Tommy finally reached his destination and greeted Dream as his prison cell was sealed shut once more by Sam. Tommy asked how Dream's life had been inside the prison and he responded how bland his life was as he kept sleeping, writing books, swimming in a one block hole and how he had been eating raw potatoes and how sorry he was for all he had done. Tommy didn't start to even pity Dream, as for all he knows he could be manipulating him again to feign pity and sadness. Tommy berated Dream about how he acted towards him, pretending to be his best friend and all the bad things he had done, and Dream told Tommy that he didn't care if the people hated him now as he was in jail and he would serve his time, hoping that Tommy would forgive him once he had served his time.

  <p key="741ad6ab-05d7-4345-b0e5-47fcb1c4ab77">
   Dream at the very least wanted someone to talk to, as he had been alone in the prison for a long time, and Tommy, well aware of this, executed his next agenda. He gave Dream five "homework assignments," saying he would return on January 24 to check on his progress. Dream agreed to make
   five novels
   for Tommy just so he can visit again. Tommy questions Dream before he leaves on who he misses the most and Dream responds with nothing and then proceeded to be questioned by Tommy he decides to call the guard, Sam. Sam requested Tommy to stand near the water hole in Dream's prison room to be (non-canonically) killed by a potion.

   Tommy respawned outside of Dream's prison room, went through all the security protocols again, but quicker as he didn't have to go through the quarantine protocols again. Tommy thanked Sam as he left Pandora's Vault. After leaving, Tommy talked about how amazed he was at the redstone contraptions he had seen inside the prison. He then proceeded to play with his new trident, taken from Dream during the Disc Conflict, venturing to many different locations having fun after that tense moment in Pandora's Vault.

   took him to see the Egg, but without the Hazmat suits typically necessary to get close to the Egg without being affected by it. However, despite this, Tommy seemed unaffected by the Egg, and was able to escape back to his construction site, where Sam turned Bad and Antfrost away for not wearing hard hats. From there, Tommy invited Tubbo to visit the Egg with him. The Egg made Tubbo cry, and the two of them only barely escaped from Bad and Antfrost when they were rescuted by Sam Nook.

   Wandering around, he met
   Puffy

He discovered Puffy had been planning on retrieving Sam after Bad and Antfrost's plan to force him into loving the Egg, and came along, despite Puffy's hesitance to drag him into a mess right after the Disc War finale. Although they quickly rescued Sam, he seemed to be in a drowsy state, as Tommy would say. During the 14 hours exposed to the Egg, Sam was forced to give up all of his items in his inventory, as well as his armor. To prevent himself from starving, he had to eat his own flesh. Disgusted, both Tommy and Puffy lent Sam food, taking away his flesh.

   Sam repetitively asked to go home, so Puffy and Tommy led him back to his base. Much to Puffy's dismay, they discovered one of the blood vine seeds planted in Sam's base. However, Sam didn't seem to mind, claiming he was tired and wanted his dog by his side. The two left him there to recover. Returning to the construction site, Tommy found Sam Nook, to which Puffy said her farewell, and Tommy continued the tasks given.

   On January 26, Tommy went to Sam Nook for the instructions, but was irritated because it meant he had to stop watching Endgame. He was then met by Niki who said she could help him and began leading Tommy to a snowy taiga biome.
   Unbeknownst to Tommy, Niki was in fact leading him to the location of a nuclear testing site so that he would die. On the way there, Tommy got continuously distracted by the trees and stopping to rant about Endgame. This made him unknowingly save his life because they were a few seconds late to the testing site and upon arrival found a huge crater where the nuke had been detonated.

   Whilst cutting back some weeds, he was approached by Jack Manifold who wanted a job. Jack claimed it was because he was poor, which Tommy believed as he had recently stolen most of Jack's stuff. However, in reality Jack wanted a job so he could grow closer to Tommy and backstab him after the nuclear plan failed.

Tommy noticed this behavior, but didn't peg it to him constantly annoying Jack, and told Sam that he did not trust him. Sam agreed to keep an eye on Jack for Tommy.

   On February 21, Tommy decided to visit Dream in prison a final time to get closure.
   He went through the standard procedure with the Warden, though he didn't need to sign the waivers he'd signed before. After entering the maximum security cell, Tommy told Dream that this was his last visit ever. Dream tried to convince him that he had changed, but Tommy did not believe it as he recounted the trauma inflicted on him by Dream.
  </p>
  <p key="9716bc25-949d-4aa2-adb1-d28ca76adf67">
   After Tommy had said goodbye to Dream, they then heard TNT explosions outside the prison. Tommy questioned Dream about the disturbance but Dream said he was just as confused. When Tommy called for Sam to let him out, Sam said in chat: "You’re going to have to hang tight Tommy. The prison is on lockdown. There has been a security issue." This enacted the maximum 7-day lockdown of the prison that Tommy had agreed upon in one of the waivers, meaning Tommy was trapped with Dream in the same cell. Tommy, in a panic, screamed to be let out and threw Dream's things in the lava. For the first time since entering the cell, Dream yelled at Tommy, to which Tommy yelled back. Tommy considered jumping in the lava to escape, but he realized that it would take his last canon life.

  <p key="2e1408ed-3829-4adb-bab1-e0c441090150">
   On March 1, Tommy was seen annoying Dream, mocking Dream and pacing around the cell.
   Sam then arrived and informed Tommy from across the lava that he could not leave yet, as Sam still did not know what had caused the explosions, and that he may be in the prison longer than the agreed upon one week. Tommy, frustrated, grew all the more agitated at Dream, blaming him and even punching Dream while Sam gave out potatoes. After this, Tommy accused Dream of lying about the Book of Necromancy, which Dream readily denied. Tommy, however, did not give out on his accusation, recalling that practically everything Dream had told him so far had been a lie. Dream, infuriated, started punching Tommy, only stopping when Tommy informed him he was at 2 hearts. Tommy told Dream he needed potatoes to heal but Dream refused to share. Tommy then said he knew Schlatt was dead, and that he had seen his corpse. Dream then resumed punching Tommy and killed him, taking his final canon life.

   Due to the time dilation of the afterlife, he experienced about one month and eighteen days at least in the void, during which he bickered and mainly talked to Wilbur (as Schlatt slept quite a lot). In his perspective, Wilbur still seemed very unstable. Tommy grew increasingly more annoyed with Wilbur as time passed. Refusing to play solitaire with Wilbur again as it was boring, even misbehaving to annoy Wilbur. It's not clear exactly what happened in the afterlife prior to the final few moments Tommy had before getting resurrected by Dream.

   Dream abruptly revived him on March 4, before interrogating him about his experience in the
   Afterlife
   .
   Tommy voiced anger at Dream, answering warily and backing away from him, saying that he had been in the afterlife for two months despite only having been dead for two days. Though he once threatened to kill Dream in return for his growing god complex, he backed off when he realized that killing Dream would only leave him locked up in the prison alone forever, and so he decided to leave him alive. Instead, he tried to get Dream to swear that he would never resurrect Wilbur. Tommy then became upset when Dream rejected this and swore that he would use the revival book however he wanted, saying that he would bring back Wilbur to escape from the prison with the help of Wilbur, which caused Tommy to get more frustrated and anxious. Here, Tommy was also shown to be extremely sensitive to all kinds of stimuli, panicking whenever he took damage
   and jumping at loud sounds.

   On March 12, Sam released Tommy from prison.
   Tommy visited several people such as Tubbo, Jack Manifold, Connor, Ranboo, and Quackity. He told them about what Dream had done, and argued with some of them. He fought with Jack Manifold over the Big Innit Hotel, which Jack had taken over under the presumption Tommy had passed away. Most people who saw Tommy walking around the server were extremely startled and walked away from him upon seeing him. Tommy felt as if the members he spoke to had all celebrated his death and didn't actually care about his return. He also revealed that he wants and is planning to kill Dream and Technoblade. It also became apparent during his first hours out of the prison that Tommy had severe PTSD and would panic every time he took damage, no matter the source, as it triggered flashbacks of being beaten to death by Dream, as well as him still being extremely sensitive to all kinds of stimuli including loud sounds and taking damage.
  </p>
  <p key="67d7c0ea-7a09-44a8-a618-a57560d9782d">
   A few days later on March 14, Tommy confided in Tubbo and Ranboo that he was planning to kill Dream and wanted their help.
   Tubbo was hesitant at first, but Ranboo agreed with Tommy on the fact that Dream was incredibly dangerous. After this, Tubbo agreed to help them both and Tommy revealed his plan. He brought up the explosions that had created the security risk that had locked him in

   stake out tower
   near the prison that was tall enough to see onto the roof of the prison. They made the tower out of crimson wood and later add dark spruce, oak and wool to the palette, but this was later taken down and replaced with stone bricks and spruce wood when Tommy finished the tower on March 27.

At first, Tommy seemed to question whether or not Henry was the real Henry, as he thought that he had died and Sapnap ate his flesh, but Ranboo raised the idea that Dream tested the revive book on Henry. Tommy and Ranboo tried to rescue Henry, building a steep and narrow staircase from the bottom of the bunker up to the surface. Henry died of fall damage only moments after getting to the surface, much to Tommy's displeasure. Ranboo and Tommy did manage to rescue Friend, who they took to
   Tommy's holiday home
   . Tommy sent an in-game message to Ghostbur asking if he remembered Friend. Ghostbur replied that he did, and that Friend is one of his only two bad memories. He left the game before Tommy could tell him that Friend was alive and well, though Tommy didn't seem to care.

   He stated that he "didn't have much time left," mirroring the way he would often speak in the later stages of his exile.
   The three of them started to build replicas of the Final Control Room and the main cell of Pandora's Vault in a space they dug out underneath the watchtower Tommy had built near the prison. They then headed to the remains of Logstedshire, where Tommy reflected on the pillar he had built on December 15 after Dream had blown up Logstedshire.

   Eret had placed inside Wilbur's chest. The book simply said "I'm Sorry -Eret," which seemed to calm Tommy down. He stated that "times have changed, but so have people," indicating that he forgave Eret for their betrayal during the original L'Manberg war.

On top of the tower, Tommy told Tubbo that he was planning to break into the prison, and that he needed Tubbo to gather wither skulls in order to prepare. He also asked Tubbo not to tell anyone, not even Ranboo, about this plan. He stated that he was going to finally kill Dream.

At the very last moving platform, however, Tommy raised the Axe of Peace too early, and was caught. Sam ordered Tommy to come back, and felt incredibly betrayed by this breach of trust.

Tommy looked over the balcony and stated that it would be a good place to "just jump off and just end it". He stated that this was a joke. Wilbur and Quackity expressed concern, and told him to not jump off the rails. Whilst the other two discussed Wilbur's resurection, Tommy lowered himself from the balcony using a water bucket. He called for help, and Wilbur used another water bucket to let Tommy to swim back up. Tommy claimed he did not know how he fell over the edge. Tommy joined Wilbur and Quackity in discussing future plans, in which Tommy decides that he will not join Las Nevadas. They spoke about visiting the prison, as well as both Tommy and Wilbur's revivals. While Wilbur was interested in visiting the prison, Tommy wasn't. Wilbur left Tommy as Tommy left Las Nevadas, going to Wilbur's future headquarters and playing his music disc, Cat.

   Later on December 5, 2021. Tommy was in Techno and Philza's training room. After getting told by Philza advices on how to encourage himself, he set out to his base and later found a trap, falling down a hole under his base. He then opened a chest and plays the broken disc, 11. When he heard his conversation with Dream the other day in the disc he panicked and ran to Philza's house but when he found a sign saying "I got him too :)", he lost his confidence and hid himself in Tubbo's old house. At which Sapnap visits him after hearing Tommy freak out and talking to himself. They devised a plan to kill Dream together and later Tommy met Phil outside the house and tell him in on his plan with Sapnap. Sam Nook is later activated by Philza and Tommy, telling Sam Nook to reinforce Tubbo's old house as it was their new safehouse now.

It had been in Tommy's possession until he died while taking down Ponk's Lemon Tree, and when Sam Nook recovered Tommy's items the crossbow was not there.

       Sam and Tommy had a very good bond, as Sam defended Tommy very often. He programmed Sam Nook to protect any of Tommy's friends(specifically Tubbo)and Tommy at presumably any cost. Sam Nook defended Tommy against BadBoyHalo, Antfrost, and the egg. Sam himself was very protective of Tommy, especially since Dream told Sam what he had done to Tommy (or at least some of it). Sam has stated that he doesn’t want Tommy's mental health to get worse than it already is.

       When Sam, as the Warden, locked Tommy in prison due to a security issue, their relationship grew tense. After a week of being trapped with Dream had gone by their relationship strained, with Tommy begging to be let out. Sam still refused as he hasn't discovered the security issue yet and left Tommy in the prison, which led to Dream taking Tommy's final canon life. Sam originally expressed much guilt for not being able to get Tommy out of the prison in time. When Tommy saw Sam again, he was furious at him for not being able to save him in time and not letting him out when he begged, claimed he would sue Sam for keeping him in the prison for over a week. His trust in Sam was completely broken.

       Their relations soured once again when Dream demanded Tommy's exile and removal from office after he griefed George's house. During the days before the griefing, Dream had already been committing various crimes around the server and pinning the blame on Tommy, indicating that Dream had already been working towards demanding Tommy's exile, and simply took the opportunity to do so when Tommy actually committed a crime of his own. When it was looking like Tommy would only receive probation as punishment, Tommy attempted to threaten Dream, taunting him with Spirit's leather, which backfired and angered Dream. After this, he demanded Tommy be exiled from L'Manberg, threatening Tubbo and the rest of L'Manberg if Tommy wasn't exiled.

When Tommy was escorted, Ghostbur was killed by Dream, reviving Wilbur. After Dream escaped from prison he confronted Tommy and threatened to kill and revive him in an endless cycle, vowing to make his life "a living hell" as vengeance for his imprisonment. Tommy fled to Philza for protection, but this only caused Dream to move to more indirect methods of mental torment, such as trapping Tommy's house and leaving threatening signs.

      After Wilbur's appearance as a ghost, Tommy was at first rattled and acted rather cold towards him, but over time he came to accept Ghostbur for who he was and has even stated that he prefers him over Wilbur. However, Tommy had made it clear that this does not mean he enjoys his company all of the time. He is seldom willing to tolerate Ghostbur's rants about his state of depression, complaining that it ruins the current mood.

       After the destruction of George's house and Tommy's trial, Tommy asked Ghostbur if he'd help him if he was to be exiled. Ghostbur, with what memories he retained of their previous exile, agreed to do what he could. When Tommy was being taken away by Dream after his exile, Ghostbur tagged along to keep him company and to provide comfort, and the two of them founded Logstedshire together. Ghostbur often visited during the early stages of his exile, and crafted the pair of compasses,

       , Ghostbur admitted to Tommy that he wanted to be resurrected, and while Tommy was reluctant to assist, he joined Philza, Ranboo, and Eret in the attempted revival. Nervous about the event, Ghostbur asked Tommy if he wanted Wilbur back, to which Tommy only responded that Ghostbur was "poggers" and Wilbur wasn't. After the initial failure, he decided he didn't want to be present anymore and excused himself, but he and Ghostbur still seemed to be on good terms.

       After a long period of not being on the server, Ghostbur returned once again. Coincidentally, he showed up on the same day Tommy &amp; co. were making a plan to take out Dream once and for all, thus getting himself involved with the plan, helping Tommy build a watchtower outside of Pandora's Vault to keep an eye out. This all culminated when the final plan went into action. Ghostbur went inside to visit Dream, while Tommy snuck in behind him with the use of an invisibility potion. Some shenanigans later, Ghostbur ended up alone with Dream after Tommy had been discovered, leading to the resurrection of Wilbur, and thus, the "death" of his ghostly counterpart. This left Tommy in despair at the loss of his dear friend and in fear at the revival of an old enemy. Soon after his revival, Wilbur tried to take Friend, Ghostbur's pet sheep, with him, claiming that he remembered, to which Tommy protested, protecting the only thing that he left of his old friend.

Their relationship strengthened when Mexican Dream accidentally visited Logstedshire during Tommy's exile. Mexican Dream provided Tommy company and even comforted him when Tommy started crying over pictures of his life before exile. Tommy grieved greatly upon the death of Mexican Dream. In the Afterlife, Tommy seemed a bit annoyed by Mexican Dream's constant loud presence, but it seems their relationship remained roughly the same.

       During exile, Ranboo maintained his loyalty. Throughout Tommy's exile, Ranboo remained supportive and was one of the two people who Tommy continued to call a friend. Ranboo often supported Tommy, and the two had a mailbox where they could communicate with each other often in
       unsigned books
       . Ranboo attempted to convince Tommy that he had been manipulated by Dream, but the manipulation overpowered their relationship. As a result, Tommy started seeing Ranboo in a negative light. After Tommy left to join Techno, Ranboo explained his loyalty to Tommy, restoring their relationship.

       When Tommy was revived and got out of the prison, Ranboo was shocked but didn't ask too many questions about him being alive again. Tommy was overwhelmed and considered Ranboo to be pressuring him into talking.

He was later also proud to present him as an endorsement for POG2020.

       , Tommy was very distraught,
       and ended up fistfighting Technoblade
       because he was so upset and angry on Tubbo's behalf,
       despite Tubbo seemingly forgiving Techno.

       Following the end of the Manberg Rebellion with the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, Tubbo was made president, with Tommy as his second in command. Tommy was excited and happy for Tubbo when this first happened,
       but later, Tommy was open in his statements that he'd never wanted Tubbo to be president, causing rifts between them especially going into the Exile Conflict. He confided in Ranboo that the reason he hadn't wanted Tubbo to become president was because he had known it would drive them apart.
       Eventually, wanting to protect his country and not start further conflict with Dream, Tubbo chose to exile Tommy, leaving a lasting dent in their relationship.

       Tommy even hallucinated Tubbo appearing in Logstedshire multiple times, proving how much he missed him. However, Dream's manipulation focused on destroying Tommy's relationships, and caused Tommy to go through many cycles of anger and forgiveness.
       Meanwhile, in L'Manberg, Tubbo regretted exiling Tommy, and called it a stupid decision, saying that he missed Tommy.
       He always carried his

       , the two had a large fight, started by Tommy being upset at Tubbo for wanting to give Dream Tommy's disc Mellohi.
       He incorrectly assumed that Tubbo knew what Dream had done to Tommy in exile. He was also upset that Tubbo hadn't visited him, and Tubbo said that it had been a mistake to trust Tommy. They ended up fighting each other in a PVP battle while accusing each other of betrayal, and the fight culminated in Tommy saying that the discs were worth more than Tubbo had ever been. However, this caused Tommy to realize that he was no longer acting true to his ideals, and he ended up leaving Technoblade and returning to Tubbo's side. He also asked Tubbo to give Dream the Mellohi disc, and Tubbo complied. Tubbo then officially un-exiled Tommy from L'Manberg, and Tommy apologized for the things he had done.

       saying that Tubbo was his one weakness and most valuable friend, and implied multiple times that he thought he would be nothing without Tubbo.
       While Tubbo was ready to accept his own death, Tommy fiercely protested and refused to give Tubbo up.
       After the two got to safety, they celebrated, bonding over everything they had accomplished.

       When Tommy visited Tubbo after he got out of the prison, Tubbo was shocked, saying that he wasn't real. After this, Tubbo was seen stalking Tommy, which in Tommy's eyes was Tubbo seeing him as "science" and treating him differently, which he disliked. Tommy also resented the fact that in his eyes, Tubbo had replaced Tommy by marrying Ranboo while Tommy was in prison.

      <p key="8bb306a6-2c65-42cf-94fa-ff8dfd9ab5b8">
       However, Tommy seems to have accepted their marriage.
       Since then, Tommy and Tubbo seem to have returned to a positive relationship, building TNT cannons together and Tommy telling Tubbo and Ranboo about his plan to kill Dream. Tommy also implied that he wanted to undertake this plan alone in order to keep Tubbo safe.

      Wilbur was Tommy's mentor. While the two clashed with each other in a fashion that one might expect from siblings, Tommy looked up to Wilbur immensely, admiring his leadership. Tommy saw Wilbur as his brother, and considered him one of his best friends.
      During most of Wilbur's life, Tommy was his disciple and second in command. Under Wilbur, Tommy learned to be loyal to his nation, and it was Wilbur's positive influence that led him to sacrifice his discs for their freedom. During the election, the two formed POG2020 to consolidate power, and after the election, they were banished together, living in the newly established Pogtopia.
      <p key="784c14d8-d480-4f8b-ac40-ec8757be41bc">
       However, due to Wilbur's declining mental state, their relationship grew strained, and Tommy was forced to reconsider his idolization of Wilbur. He began losing his trust in him, and his attempts to dissuade him from executing
       the TNT plot
       all fell short. At the end of the Manberg vs Pogtopia war, Tommy believed that he was coming back around, and initially attempted to reinstate him as president - but he was quickly proven wrong when Wilbur detonated L'Manberg and was killed right in front of him.

       Despite his wrongdoings, Tommy did not fully blame Wilbur for L'Manberg's destruction (instead of placing that blame on Technoblade), and seemed to have a conflicted opinion on who Wilbur used to be, and who Wilbur became before his death. He evidently feared the potential repercussions of resurrecting him, however, and while he had stated before that he missed him and wished to honor his original ideals, it seemed that he preferred Wilbur dead.

       However, when Dream revealed during the

       that he had the power to resurrect dead people, Tommy instantly thought of Wilbur, and this was one of the main reasons why Tommy chose not to take Dream's third and (presumably) final life.
       After the confrontation was over, Wilbur spoke to Tommy from the afterlife, and Tommy explained to him that the possibility of bringing Alivebur back was important to him, despite Wilbur disagreeing and not wanting to come back to life.
       This showed that Tommy still missed Wilbur, and wanted to have the possibility of bringing him back to life.

       After his revival, Tommy stated that Wilbur should never be revived, even believing for a short while that he was worse than even Dream,

       Tommy was extremely upset by Wilbur coming back and claims that he's worse than ever. He doesn't trust that Wilbur has changed and keeps an eye on him, not allowing Ranboo to be alone with him. However, as time has gone on, Tommy has been working hard to impress Wilbur by collecting stone for him and staying by his side. Later, when Wilbur and Quackity were fighting over his loyalty in Las Nevadas, Tommy chose Wilbur.
