   Puffy was previously a sheep with rainbow fur. She wore black sunglasses and a purple cape with the Twitch icon.
  </p>
  <p key="7046e804-043c-4f06-8e35-f92d96bfe890">
   She recently appeared as a human with long brown hair, tan skin, green eyes, and sunglasses. She wore a sheep onesie reminiscent of her previous skin.
  </p>
  <p key="e63cfa8d-ffff-456b-9037-86352989c290">
   In her Snowchester attire, she retains her long brown hair, tan skin, green eyes, and sunglasses. She wears the standard-issue Snowchester clothing: a thick brown vest and pants over a long-sleeved, checkered, beige shirt that is lined with cream fur and accompanied by boots and a hood.
  </p>
  <p key="de755be7-8e5a-462f-98da-2c3d2e8f447b">
   In fanart and her official Twitch icon, she is an anthropomorphic sheep who wears a red pirate jacket, a white long sleeve shirt, and a black pirate captain hat.
  </p>
  <p key="b35c50d7-ac29-460d-bd09-825a9306fba2">
   In her most recent skin, which was updated during her origin story lore stream, Puffy is a human with green eyes, sunglasses, a captain's hat, and a captain's dark grey or faded black long duster with gold buttons. Her hair is split-dyed half white to represent the sheep skin and half brown, her actual hair color. Puffy has said that this is her permanent skin.

  </h2>
  <p key="2836cc76-f68e-4d1d-b8db-14b63d51b6db">
   Puffy is a bubbly, kind, and friendly person. She generally gets along with everyone in the SMP and considers most of them her friends. She often acts out of kindness and helps people no matter where they stand, expecting nothing in return, such as when she built Tommy a Christmas tree during exile to cheer him up. She also has an urge to help rebuild the SMP to look natural and have it not filled with explosions and rubble, joking that she is one of the "janitors" of the server. She often takes on a parental role, even calling Dream her "duckling" and showing concern about protecting Tommy, Tubbo, Ranboo, and Purpled, the kids on the server.
  </p>
  <p key="ec2ea523-7226-4a08-abeb-37d976b4741c">
   However, she also has a chaotic side, as shown by the time she and Dream blew up parts of the server and blamed it on Tommy. She enjoys pranking others as long as it does not go too far. She tries not to cause lasting harm to others with her actions, and prefers to resolve situations peacefully. Some of her ultimately harmless pranks were building a giant llama for

   Puffy has a knack for building. Some of her notable projects include remaking the Duck Statue into a turkey for Thanksgiving, building the
   Rainbow Target (L'Targay)
   , her mushroom house, the Temple of Hype, rebuilding the Community House after it was destroyed, and her Snowchester house and windmill.
  </p>
  <p key="daefceb7-a895-4477-bf98-71b6908c0e9a">
   She shows that she is one of the only caring adults on the server to Tommy and Tubbo, as the others seem to either dislike Tommy or simply not care about him. For example, when Bad attempts to capture Tommy for the

  </p>

   Puffy has also been shown to be a capable leader, as she has been seen as the leader of the unofficial resistance against the Eggpire. However, she realizes that she may have waited too late to act and feels a great deal of guilt for how things have turned out because of it. Her closest friends and allies, Bad, Ant, and Dream, all turned out to be some of the server's major antagonists. Feeling conflicted because of her friendship with Bad and Ant, she did not commit to doing "whatever it takes" or face the fact that she might have to kill her former friends until after Tommy died.

  <p key="6122a8a0-73d7-4813-8edb-cc9381104c40">
   Even though Puffy wants to help the minors of the server, she acknowledges that she failed to help Tommy while he was locked up in the prison. She tried to protect Tommy's hotel from a takeover by Jack Manifold while he was locked up. She and Jack argued and ended up agreeing to meet in court, where Puffy planned to sue Jack for ownership of the hotel on Tommy's behalf. However, that date never came, as Dream murdered Tommy in prison. Puffy was devastated, saying to herself that she was both disappointed by her friends' actions and a disappointment to them by her failure to act in time or save the people she wanted to protect. She even began to wonder if she should simply leave, stating that she failed both Dream and Tommy.

  <p key="cb55c9b3-3cb3-446f-b0f1-4b8a71217553">
   It seems that while she previously helped Tommy escape the Eggpire and rescue Sam, she did not truly grasp how much danger Tommy and everyone else was in until Tommy died. Her caring and somewhat naïve nature made her ignore the facts of what Bad, Ant, and Dream were capable of because she wanted to believe the best of her friends. Most notably, she still held out hope that Dream would reform and wanted to visit him, only truly abandoning him after he killed Tommy. Although she has pledged to help and support the children of the server now that Tommy is dead, she has begun to doubt herself and has not taken any major steps towards that goal yet.

  <p key="e9df8090-6677-4e30-8956-88806ca5991c">
   She is still capable of admitting to mistakes, which becomes evident when she shows remorse for ever helping the Eggpire expand. With the beginning of her origin story arc, however, her ability to admit her faults seems to be swinging too far in the other direction. She became hyper-critical of herself and blamed herself for everything.

   The events of the Red Banquet have had a drastic effect on her psyche, specifically the death of Foolish and her killing of Antfrost. The realization of Bad's selfish exploitation of trust and lack of care for innocent lives has turned Puffy bitter and spiteful towards the entire server, now hardened and unaccepting of trust after reflecting on the actions of Dream and the Eggpire. She sees war as the only option, believing any possibility of peace to be long gone, and has abandoned her morals for this crusade. Her demeanor has transformed from that of a motherly figure to the very thing she previously despised the most: A bloodthirsty warmonger with no qualms about destroying the world around her.

   Puffy was most likely born on a ship or in a small town. She was possibly part of (and maybe the leader of) a group of pirates, who wore the typical captain gear (black and red suits). She seemed to have crashed on a ship during a storm on November 15, the day before she "joined the server," causing her to lose most of her memories from before the crash. The sight of her ship triggers memories of familiar sights and feelings, but she is very averse to exploring those. According to an old diary she found on the ship, she has a mother, she was searching for a mysterious treasure, and her family has some sort of "curse."

   Puffy and Niki went on a date on November 28, 2020. The date with Niki began with a gift of a red poppy from Puffy. Niki took the gift with gratitude, and Puffy lead Niki down the trail and across
   Church Prime
   , where Puffy set a picnic spot for the date. The picnic area had the classic pattern of a red and white carpet with sunflowers and rose bushes. Each corner had a lantern, and behind the carpet was an image of Niki's pets, Zuko and Toph. To the side of the carpet was a chest, and inside it was lettuce, champagne, pumpkin pie, and baked potatoes. Niki was openly enthusiastic and heartfelt about it, and they were able to joke and laugh about the mistake in the images plugin, giving the beginning of the date a good start.
  </p>
  <p key="020c47e9-c3bb-42b7-aaeb-5923a0058a34">
   The main plan for the date was for them to build a shop after they took down the picnic area. After a small discussion, they decided to visit Niki's Bakery, where they asked the chat what they should build and gained ideas for the style. Puffy read out the options of a cottage, a flower shop, and a coffee shop. Niki considered all of the options to be good ideas, but she found a flower shop to be the most favorable out of all, and thus, a
   flower shop
   was in construction. Ranboo and Fundy later attempted to take over the shop, but Niki and Puffy managed to defend it, leading the two invaders to build a rivaling ice cream shop. During their time in the shop, Dream visited the shop, and bought flowers, saying after that George would love them. Fundy, in disbelief, confronted Dream, to which he quickly responded that it was a typo, and promptly gave him a gentle kiss after. A few moments later, Dream whispered to Nihachu to get more flowers, and to not tell Fundy about it.

  <p key="bfc9bccf-e136-422d-bdec-79b0d46bec28">
   After they touch up the bits and surroundings of the flower shop, Dream begins to ask odd questions, such as, "Where is the border of L'Manberg?" Confused, Puffy and Niki began to walk over to Dream, and in shock, found him building an obsidian wall. They asked him questions and even voiced their confusion, but Dream continued on the labor, answering very vaguely or shortly. They informed Ranboo, Tubbo, and Fundy about it. Tubbo decided to schedule a meeting for them to discuss, with hopes of resolving the conflict so Dream can take down the border. At the end of their date lies danger and uncertainty, especially with Puffy and Niki on opposing sides. Puffy then gives Niki a diamond that was named "Promise ring."

   After the creation of the Eggpire, Puffy built an underground base beneath one of the towers of Eret's castle. There, she maintains a room with a large wall of signs describing troubling events on the SMP and her efforts to figure everything out. This was initially an attempt to recreate Fundy's first wall of signs and theories, but she now adds to the sign wall as she gathers new intel and theories about what's going on. In order to keep a closer eye on BadBoyHalo, she moved this underground base right beneath Bad's mansion, hiding the entrance behind a photo of CatMaid Skeppy. After Tommy's death, she recruited Eret to the pro-omelette cause, showed him the base under Bad's house, and invited him to add to the sign wall any time he found more intel.

She started EggChamp, which is similar to PogChamp and wouldn't stop talking about it. Puffy began to protect the Egg from everyone who opposed it and worked alongside BadBoyHalo and Antfrost. She let the vines grow into her house and celebrated it, saying The Egg would cause a new era.

   When Sapnap blew up part of the Egg, she and Bad covered The Egg in obsidian to ensure nobody would hurt it again. Due to the obsidian blocking it, Bad woke up from the possession. Although it took Puffy longer, she did as well. Bad, Punz, Ant, and Puffy were now in charge of making sure the Egg wouldn't hurt anyone else as it did them. However, Puffy and Ant still felt some attraction to The Egg, saying that the vines looked pretty and the Egg was amazing.

   Over time, Puffy and a few others were put in charge of keeping The Egg away from the rest of the SMP. They did many experiments on the Egg, such as seeing what happened if they put wool nearby and eventually covering the entire Egg with several layers of obsidian to stop it from breaking free, but Puffy still wondered what would happen if the 'wonderful Egg' was let out of containment.

Afterward, Puffy expressed how she felt conflicted: she agreed with Niki that Tommy did some unforgivable things and that she struggled to see him leading the defense, but strongly believed in the ideals and people the country represented. She was tired of choosing sides and conflicts but recognized that neutrality was, in itself, a decision.

Both of them saw it as The Egg had chosen her rather than as a warning, and invited her down to see it, which she refused. However, she requested for their appearance at the meeting place and praised The Egg and was generally positive but wrote in the Captain's Log, Undercover Mission: Egg.

   Sam came to confront the three of them about the propaganda Bad had been putting up. Puffy came upfront about her negative feelings towards The Egg and even got Sam a hazmat suit when the others tried to lure him down without one. She reminded them that she'd never uprightly said that she agreed with their ideas and the Eggpire. Despite being swayed slightly, she held her ground, but managed to be discreet enough that the Eggpire still had faith in her. Bad tried to convince her that they would destroy it once everyone had been united under it, but she said that it made no sense and argued against him, leaving the Egg room. Bad told her to sleep on it because she would soon come around, to which she called him delusional, but Ant and Bad said they had a Plan B that was a surprise. She managed to gain their respect again by talking to them for a bit longer.

After Dream murders Tommy in prison, Puffy says she does not know how to even begin to process the fact that her duckling had killed Tommy and become the worst of everyone. She decides she no longer wants to see Dream in prison for a long time, possibly ever. She says she hopes he is alone in there for a very long time.

After going between Captain's Cookies and Puffy's Pastries, she chose the latter per Foolish's request. With Foolish's help and Tubbo's approval, she took down part of the wood fence marking the borders of the town, terraformed the area, and began her house. At Tubbo's jungle base, she traded for a nametag which she used to name a pig Blitz. Blitz is currently hidden in the basement of her house. Her house includes a windmill, and she hopes to make a place where food is provided. She changed the logo on her shield to the Snowchester flag and is now a member of it.

   The day after the Banquet, she reflects on what happened while walking down the Prime Path. She feels like it is her fault that the Banquet even happened, and that she failed as a parent, friend, and protector. Any trust that Puffy had left for Ant and Bad is now gone, since she believes that they chose to kill Foolish first to hurt her. She no longer thinks of them as friends, or even humans. While she does not regret it, Puffy is willing to face the consequences of killing Antfrost.

   She goes down to her room under Eret's castle, takes a look at her old signs, and realizes that everyone on the server has a dark side and could turn at any moment. Puffy then rewrites the first page of her Captain's Log. Instead of what it means to be a knight she writes about what it means to be a villain, noting that no one on the server is to be trusted, -- even herself. Puffy tells herself that if she knew what was going to happen at the Banquet she would have killed them all. She claims that trust is the biggest weakness there is and that the Banquet was her last straw, now wanting to bring an era of bloodlust to the server.

      Bad and Puffy developed a good relationship when they worked on digging the Statue Room together.

      Puffy was initially very friendly with Dream and supplied Dream with large amounts of materials. She mentioned that she leans towards Dream's side, likely due to Dream's strange habit of following her around at random points in time for no determinable reason. She admits he tugged on her heartstrings, and they seem to have a special relationship.

       After the Doomsday War, Puffy realized that Dream was the reason all of this chaos was happening. She took part in saving Tommy and Tubbo from Dream during the last battle for the discs, but still feels terrible for Dream. Despite knowing the horrific actions he took, she hopes Dream will finally understand the amount of pain Tommy had to go through in exile by being put in prison. Though Puffy celebrated Dream's imprisonment, she still cares for him and wishes him the best. She hopes that he can change with time if given the chance.

      Puffy and Eret's relationship has gotten better since her initial sheep prank with their wool. She was a sworn knight of Eret, and Puffy has said that she is allied with them, along with BadBoyHalo, Nihachu, Antfrost, Awesamdude, and (somewhat) Dream. However, since the events of the Doomsday War and the creation of the Eggpire, her list of allies has changed and Puffy has given up the title of Knight of Eret. Although no longer a knight, Puffy still has a neutral or positive relationship with Eret, whom she still considers a friend. Recently, she recruited them to the side of the pro-omelette movement and showed them her secret base.

Because the two have opposite relations towards Tommy (as Niki plans to kill Tommy but Puffy being a parental figure towards Tommy), it is unknown whether or not their relationship will end up in shambles as a result. The tiniest glimpse of hope of the two heavily relies on the Syndicate, which Niki is a part of.

       Niki has actively tried to get in contact with Puffy, but she was unable to get back to her due to a problem with the Egg, which caused Niki to feel like she'd been abandoned. During the Red Banquet, the two seemed closer - dancing together and talking.

       After witnessing Ranboo's Silk Touch hands ability, Puffy became slightly scared of and worried about him. She places Ranboo high up on her list of people who need therapy once her office opens. She hopes therapy might help him figure out his enderman Silk Touch ability as well as delve into the mysteries of his enderman half.

      Puffy used to recognize him as a chaotic member, one a knight should stand against at all costs. However, after the formation of the Eggpire, she began to see Techno's point of view and saw that power corrupted. She eventually concluded that to destroy the blood vines, maybe they need the blood god. She writes in her captain's log that it is time for anarchy and that she plans to ally with Technoblade. She also defended Techno and Ranboo against Bad when he tried to lure them to the Egg, and took Techno's advice on marketing the anti-Egg side as "pro-omelette." Both Puffy and Techno are in the same stance against the Eggpire.

      Before Tommy's exile, Puffy and Tommy had a rocky relationship. They had a relationship of constantly pranking each other, and getting back at each other. When Tommy was exiled, she made a personal Christmas tree for him, and he seemed to appreciate the gift.

       After Tommy's death, she went around the server making different memorials for him in his most famous locations. She feels regret for not being able to protect him and wants to honor his memory the best she can. She blames herself for Tommy's death because she believes she should be the adult protecting the kids. Puffy then becomes frustrated as well when everyone forgot Tommy's death in less than 24 hours, making his death and himself seem meaningless.

       When she discovered the book Tommy had wrote in her TheraPuffy office, she was shocked and was concerned, thinking that someone must've pranked her. When she convinced herself that it was from the real Tommy, Puffy immediately made another book for therapy and placed it in Tommy's home, hoping for Tommy to see it.
