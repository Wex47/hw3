  </p>
  <p key="da68bae6-86c4-4134-a879-bb2b0719a947">
   He invited everyone to come except for those who should not be named (

   As Wilbur and Tommy returned to
   Pogtopia
   , Wilbur contemplated whether they might actually be the bad guys, as he couldn't find any flaws in what Schlatt was doing. He said that Schlatt had been elected democratically, and that them fighting back was actually the thing in the wrong. Tommy reminded Wilbur of everything they'd fought for, and how Schlatt was undermining everything
   <a href="L'Manberg.html" key="8dd7a7f4-547f-4eca-8f6e-41685132070f" title="L'Manberg">

  </p>
  <p key="f4508bc9-f511-4575-be57-d3965948b66c">
   Wilbur decided that even though what they were fighting for was good, they would become the villains, and burn the whole thing to the ground, stating that "if he can't have L'Manberg, than nobody can". He then told Tommy about how he knew

    Dream

  </p>
  <p key="61313004-092d-4daa-bc5d-0f98a9a8411c">
   As Tommy began to ponder his decision, Wilbur began monologuing about his state on the server. He didn't believe that anyone who'd promised they'd help them were actually going to, and that in the end, they'd just betray him to Schlatt just like
   Eret
   had in the first war. Wilbur knew that two of his closest allies from the first war,
   Tubbo
   and
   Fundy
   , his own son, would betray them the first chance they got.
  </p>
  <p key="08983886-86e7-42d2-b80a-84a061839efa">
   Tommy returned with a decision, telling Wilbur that he was being reckless and irrational, but Tommy would still follow him, even if he disagreed, he just wanted to find a better way. Wilbur retaliated by saying that Tommy was scared, and trying to find the easier way out. Once again, he told Tommy that he'd never make a good President, because he was too afraid of what other people would think of him.

   In Manberg, Schlatt,
   Quackity
   , Tubbo, and Fundy began to plan and prepare for the festival that would take place in a week's time. Schlatt gave Fundy the responsibility of cleaning up and building the new podium to make it look nice for their guests.
  </p>
  <p key="307989b0-0e5a-47c7-b7c3-57abe5011c2f">
   Schlatt gave Tubbo the honor of giving a speech at the festival, as long as the word "lettuce" was used at the end of every sentence.
  </p>
  <p key="9da390c6-0b6d-4657-82af-95bcdd57d283">
   While planning for the festival, Schlatt noticed that Tubbo had suddenly gone missing, and the three remaining Manbergians went to go investigate the bunker where they had assumed Tubbo would be. Once inside, they scoured the room for Tubbo, but couldn't find him at all. Eventually, Fundy showed them a false wall, that revealed Tubbo's Archives, a room filled with relics from the history of the server.

  <p key="f9614c3f-0cb6-42dd-b61f-0a7d22a90a78">
   Tubbo returned to Pogtopia, and Wilbur asked him what Schlatt had told him. Tubbo gave him a brief rundown as to what had happened, before revealing that Schlatt had given him the task to write and deliver a speech. Wilbur, angered by this, outwardly asked if a speech about democracy might be something a betrayer would partake in.
  </p>
  <p key="9ae7a3d4-d44c-428f-bf0c-4ee2723fb298">
   Schlatt, Quackity, and Fundy then joined into their call, beginning down the tunnel into Pogtopia to find him. Schlatt questioned Tubbo as to what the tunnel was, and where it lead to, but Tubbo lied by saying it was a tunnel he was in the process of building that would lead to an Watch tower outpost where they could work to farm Totems of Undying for their very death-prone president. Impressed by his "right hand man", Schlatt gave Tubbo the responsibility of planning the entire festival, rather than just the speech.
  </p>
  <p key="95cbe22f-e1b1-45b6-8c4e-1135ab646c1a">
   Wilbur and Tommy blocked up the walls leading into Pogtopia as Tubbo distracted the Manbergians, and Tommy ran back to the Dream SMP Lands on Techno's horse. Tommy reached Pokimane's statue, and desperately threatened to blow it up, as well as the flag Fundy built. Dream arrived, and gave Tommy some TNT to help. However, while Tommy was in the process of doing so, Schlatt, Quackity, Fundy and Tubbo stood by and just laughed, stating that they could care less if Tommy destroyed it. Tommy, outwardly disheartened, got back on his horse, before exclaiming that the whole thing had been a ploy to keep them from digging into the walls of Pogtopia.
  </p>
  <p key="c817b8cd-4a41-4963-9fd1-30ccf2e893a4">
   Tommy stated that he was confused, and for the first time, actually scared. He said that everyone had gone nuts, and he didn't know what was happening to Wilbur. Tommy felt that the only person he felt he could trust was Tubbo.

  <p key="bf9ef04b-03d5-4399-8f80-64411e00acba">
   Wilbur requested a private meeting with Dream, revealing his plan to plant TNT underneath Manberg, and asking if Dream could supply him with some. Dream almost immediately agreed to give him TNT despite Tommy begging him not to. Wilbur then asked why he wanted L'Manberg to rise again, as both he and Tommy pointed out that Dream had outright opposed them at first.
  </p>
  <p key="d54a866a-edf5-4f85-b37e-bd83bdf78a49">
   Dream explained that Schlatt's ambition was a threat to the server, and his own hold on power. When he'd realized that L'Manberg just wanted a separate place to exist on their own, he'd accepted that they weren't an actual threat. Manberg on the other hand, posed a bigger problem.
  </p>
  <p key="f6af9ec4-10ee-46ac-bead-e359143b1730">
   Tommy said that what Wilbur wanted to do was wrong, and that there were other ways to go about this. He aimed at Wilbur with his bow, asking for the TNT, only for Dream to protect Wilbur over helping Tommy, revealing that he only had his own interests at heart, not a loyalty to Tommy, as it had previously appeared. Wilbur announced that Tommy was never in charge, and that he needed to make a decision. Tommy said that he'd never betray Wilbur, but that this isn't the right route.
  </p>
  <p key="a330225a-8687-4037-aaab-b9b79e378a67">
   Wilbur revealed that he was going to detonate the TNT while Tubbo gave his speech on the festival day. Tommy left the call and stated that this couldn't be how all of this ended, he didn't sacrifice both of his discs for Wilbur to throw it all away.

  <p key="d9d4ad79-089f-4614-a9b0-612d5d0fa38e">
   Wilbur began to console himself down in Pogtopia, reassuring himself that Tommy would come around eventually, citing how he'd been quick to challenge Dream to a duel, and the other reckless things he'd done during the first war. For the first time, he stated that he was comfortable with a decision he'd made since being expelled from Manberg. He was reminded of the others in Manberg at the festival who might not necessarily be allied with Schlatt, but Wilbur said that whoever got caught in the crossfire was an unfortunate casualty, Wilbur also said he felt no remorse offing Eret after all he'd done.
  </p>
  <p key="e6c1006a-05b6-4273-9e17-0a37cd2a35c3">
   At the end of his monologue, Wilbur reflected on Technoblade's allegiance, stating that he expected Techno to betray them for the losing side, as Techno didn't care about who he was fighting for, just that he was fighting.

   As Tommy headed back to his base in the greater Dream SMP to meet with Tubbo, Wilbur reconnected, as told Tommy, somewhat sarcastically, that he could still be president one day, and hold executive power, but that he'd need to get back on Wilbur's good side. Tommy agreed, but focused on telling Tubbo Wilbur's plans.
  </p>
  <p key="7ef13209-783b-4bfd-87db-174ab39afc65">
   Tommy rebuilt the bench and jukebox outside his house, and he and Tubbo began discussing their own plans. While getting out discs to listen to, it was revealed that Wilbur had lied when he promised he'd give Tommy back the other Mellohi disc, and had actually given it to Tubbo. Tommy wasn't sure how he felt about Wilbur at the moment, and asked why Wilbur might've kept his disc. Tubbo replied that it might've been because Wilbur wanted power over Tommy, to keep him around if things went bad.
  </p>
  <p key="fbc6439c-6bd8-4eb4-83ee-e1dea314d1e8">
   Tommy then told Tubbo that the festival wasn't going to be a good day, despite Tubbo being excited for it, and revealed that Wilbur wanted Tubbo "blown up", and they needed to work together.
  </p>
  <p key="8ab48952-8539-47ed-b832-23060752393f">
   Tubbo then also revealed that he was in possession of "Cat", and though Tommy said he was sure BadBoyHalo had it, Tubbo said he was 90% sure it was the original. They both realized that they had all of the discs, and no one had leverage over them anymore, and if they wanted, they could just run away together somewhere safe, but at the end, Tommy decided that they needed to finish this like men.
  </p>
  <p key="f0f28bd5-e987-43c0-8676-59e60a8d375d">
   They both agreed that they couldn't trust anyone, including Wilbur for the moment, unless he snapped out of whatever insanity he was going through now. Unbeknownst to them, Schlatt, Quackity, and Fundy had been watching them talk. Schlatt then told Tommy that he had openly admitted that the Embassy was technically a part of Manberg, and a place not safe for Tommy. Tommy then ran off.

   As the Schlatt, Quackity, and Fundy began to wrap up their plans, Quackity suggested that they might want security for the night of the festival, just in case, to which Schlatt agreed and assigned Fundy the security role. Ponk also dropped by and provided them with some emerald blocks and tipped arrows. After Ponk and Fundy both logged off, Schlatt and Quackity began to discuss Quackity's role. Quackity wanted to have a part to play in the festival, and Schlatt agreed that he should fill whatever position they needed. They bonded for a while and talked privately on mute before Schlatt logged off.

   In the days leading up to the festival, Ponk travelled to Manberg and built several attractions such as a dunk tank mini-game with prizes, a llama on a coaster that encircled Party Island, a giant lemon tree and a flower shop.
  </p>
  <p key="e718d153-aa23-4704-974f-da6d66a1beb8">
   Fundy further decorated the area and completely rebuilt the Electoral Podium with blackstone bricks, slabs and magma blocks, giving it a more sinister theme. The new podium had a black throne with horns for Schlatt to sit on during his speeches and an expanded seating area.
  </p>
  <p key="45894a29-ad12-4809-85b3-ac77a4bc9fd1">
   Tubbo, along with Karl, decorated the podium seating area and then built several booths, a wipeout parkour course in the lake, an ice rink, and a fighting ring.
  </p>
  <p key="97fd5c50-f13a-4945-bc82-4b5be068a1e9">
   While Karl was out of the call, Wilbur came to talk to Tubbo, and revealed to him that he'd placed TNT beneath the entirety of Manberg, and that on the day of reckoning, Techno would release Withers to terrorize the remaining citizens. He told Tubbo that he really didn't want to see him hurt through all of this, and that he wanted Tubbo to run away instead of being a part of the festival. Tubbo, not willing to give up something he'd worked so hard on, told him that he couldn't, so Wilbur instead asked him to put a code word into his speech that would tell Wilbur he was ready for him to detonate the TNT. If everything went well, Wilbur then told Tubbo that he wanted him to take down the flag.
  </p>
  <p key="fc2232d2-e639-49cb-8542-f10f82b863fd">
   Tubbo then said that he was happy that it might mean the war would end soon, but Wilbur said that he believed that war would never end on the SMP, and that it would go on forever. Tubbo then asked if Wilbur even wanted L'Manberg back, and Wilbur said that he didn't know, before saying that if he didn't end up in charge at the end of it all, there would never be another L'Manberg ever again.
  </p>
  <p key="c9ac3b48-3021-402e-8402-60e287d9e684">
   Wilbur then forbade Tubbo from speaking to Tommy, telling him that he didn't understand what needed to be done, and belived that Manberg was something that could be saved. Tubbo agreed, but when Wilbur left, Tubbo said that he hadn't forgotten what Tommy had said to him a few days previous, but didn't state which side he would end up on at the time.

   This new revelation of Wilbur planning to bomb Manberg led to division in Pogtopia over whether or not this was a good course of action.
  </p>
  <p key="cf5451a2-2d75-4245-9ecf-5640e56c8bcf">
   Tommy was still overly against it, stating that Wilbur had gone mad, while Wilbur believed that eventually Tommy would "come around" and join his side. Tubbo remained neutral, having heard both sides and feeling pressured by both. Technoblade still maintained that he was simply an anarchist that wanted destruction, taking Wilbur's side over Tommy's.
  </p>
  <p key="e3d6b166-9eb8-40a2-9b39-b82ae89ecfa2">
   Eret and Niki, two apparent supporters of Pogtopia, had been planning their own explosive plot, unaware of Wilbur's plan, meaning that they had supported the general idea to nuke Manberg, while not knowing about the specifics of Wilbur's plan. While Eret was stockpiling explosives two days before the day of the festival, he claimed it was all for him, and did not seem to have any knowledge or intent to bomb the festival. It was later revealed by Eret that they had planned to blow up the Second White House that Fundy had built before the election results.

  </h3>
  <p key="88ffe983-1adc-4e07-9c9d-12919daffb86">
   On the day of the festival, Wilbur called Tommy to go over the plans one last time. He gave one final plea to Tommy, asking him to join his side and help him blow up Manberg. Tommy then said that he was with him, despite being hesitant. Thrilled that Tommy agreed, Wilbur told Tommy that Tubbo would say the line, "now let the festival begin", in his speech, and that as soon as Tubbo said it, Wilbur and Tommy would hit the button that would detonate the TNT, and kill everyone. Tommy asked Wilbur if this was what Tubbo wanted, as he wouldn't do anything Tubbo didn't want to do. Wilbur reassured Tommy that Tubbo was on Wilbur's side when he discussed the plan with him, and Tommy told Wilbur, "I think I'm with you."
  </p>
  <p key="fef40b88-2eea-4e82-93da-08e0edfbf11d">
   However, Tommy expressed once again that he didn't think they should blow Manberg up, and said that they could still reclaim it without destroying it. Wilbur told Tommy that he had changed, in which Tommy protested that he hadn't changed. Wilbur brushed over Tommy's comment by telling him that they should set up a base close by Manberg to keep an eye on what was happening. He then asked Tommy if they could just be friends for today, even if they didn't agree with each other. Tommy agreed, but told Wilbur that it wouldn't prevent him from stopping him. Wilbur then showed Tommy that he still had the TNT Dream gave him, and had used the TNT that he had acquired from a "different source" to plant underneath Manberg.
  </p>
  <p key="dd7b2b55-4d93-4f39-8cc5-8afdc58dfac7">
   The two of them began stocking up in one of Eret's towers, and Tommy gave Wilbur a piece of cake labeled as "Niki's". Wilbur then accused him of trying to sway his decision by showing him things from the past. He then said that he didn't care about any of the citizens, and that they meant nothing to him. He was still under the impression that Tubbo wasn't on their side, saying that he talked to Wilbur like he did to Schlatt.

  <p key="ff13967b-d3ea-4ff5-8aa6-c53a32326c17">
   Tommy and Wilbur set up a quick base in the NASA building next to the podium. Tubbo noticed them, but simply nodded at them and pretended not to have seen them. They had planned to sit there and watch the opening of the Festival, however quickly realized that their base was in a terrible location, as everyone gathered right next to the building to listen to Schlatt give his speech. Tommy asked Wilbur where the button was, but Wilbur refused. Tommy kept persisting and asked where the button was, before Wilbur told him that it was over the hill by the White House. He claimed that he had told his chat where the button was.
  </p>
  <p key="425c57ca-62fb-4bd3-b724-1c150e240924">
   There was a brief standoff between Schlatt and the festival guests in a different call, as they were too lazy to move, and Schlatt wanted them to move to his call. Eventually they gave in after Schlatt said that he would Paypal them all $5 if they moved VC's.
  </p>
  <p key="d6dcc0d6-23bf-4552-8889-c9b31288510f">
   Tommy then begins to show his real distress over the situation, and told his chat that he didn't want Wilbur to blow it all up. He showed concern for Tubbo because Wilbur had shown to him that he didn't actually care about Tubbo, and that he didn't know what to do. Tommy started questioning whether or not Wilbur was actually right about Tubbo not being loyal to them, but convinced himself that Wilbur was in the wrong, and that Wilbur was the villian.
  </p>
  <p key="1a382d16-2410-4e85-a883-e4d04b1c6187">
   Schlatt then began his opening speech, and told the people gathered that he just wanted to throw a party to celebrate Manberg and democracy. After completing his speech, Schlatt, Quackity and Tubbo joined the crowd to officially begin the festivities.

  <p key="1c9ab25a-5ab3-4ae1-8c77-36093a1f9754">
   After the opening speeches had concluded, Wilbur told Tommy that he wasn't sure about going through with the plan, as those were his friends he would be betraying. Tommy told Wilbur that he didn't have to do it, that they could still take Manberg back another day, and that they didn't have to blow it up. However, Wilbur stood firm that it was their only opportunity to blow it up, and that they wouldn't get a more perfect opportunity than this one. Tommy continued to tell Wilbur that they didn't have to do this, and looked down at the people below to see just how happy they were. Tommy asked Wilbur if he didn't want their friends to be happy, to which Wilbur had no response.
  </p>
  <p key="6bbbc2a9-a255-4bf7-a76c-c1968fb9bfa9">
   Wilbur decided to tell Tommy exactly where he had put the TNT. According to Wilbur, he put 20 pieces of TNT underneath Schlatt's throne, a line of TNT underneath the red carpet in the audience seating, and another line of TNT leading to the path to Party Island. They decided to ask Tubbo about Schlatt.
  </p>
  <p key="ab815482-c3f3-45d1-8e69-d6f5c2b4ca57">
   Wilbur asked Tubbo if Schlatt was a good leader, and Tubbo responded saying that he had made positive improvements, but had some weird ambitions. He then asked Tubbo if he was happier with Schlatt in charge, to which Tubbo said that he was much happier when Wilbur and Tommy were in charge. Wilbur revealed that he didn't think Schlatt would stop even if they were to blow Manberg up, even if there was nothing left to rule. Tubbo told them that Schlatt had gone from rock bottom and come back, and that he was the type of person that would build it from the ground up again.
  </p>
  <p key="f0c2940c-4116-4bcb-82cc-95ce91740003">
   When asked whether or not they should blow up Manberg, Tubbo stated that he didn't think they should, and that there were alternative options, to which Tommy agreed with him. Soon after, Tubbo had to leave, as he had to rejoin the festival activities.
  </p>
  <p key="40c7d172-6630-4955-9655-9ee8493a50f6">
   Wilbur decided to leave it all up to Tubbo, and left it up to him on whether or not he would actually say the detonation line. Tommy confronted Wilbur, saying that he shouldn't be pinning the responsibilities on Tubbo, as this wasn't Tubbo's journey; it was Wilbur's. Even though Tubbo made it clear that he did not approve of blowing up Manberg, Tommy said that he would still do what Wilbur wanted, as that's just what Tubbo did. Wilbur said that he handed Tubbo the reigns to see whether or not he really was just a "Yes" man, and could actually think for himself; Wilbur's logic was that if Tubbo really cared, he wouldn't say the line and save Manberg and their friends.
  </p>
  <p key="de8de783-9c72-4139-b081-f4a56e86c33b">
   Tommy and Wilbur suddenly spotted a pile of chests placed by Ponk that were labeled with the names of the server members on them, including theirs. They decided to run down and grab the goodies inside while everyone was distracted by the boxing tournament. However, when they opened their chests, they realized that there was nothing of value in their chests; Tommy's had two poisonous potatoes and an emerald, while Wilbur's had three rotten flesh, two ink sacks and a gold nugget. However, their plan to dash in was foiled by a creeper that blew up behind Wilbur, and blew up some of the chests, and sent Wilbur flying into the air before killing him due to fall damage.

   After finishing some final rounds of boxing, Tommy told Tubbo to do his speech, and the attendees of the festival gather at the podium once again. Schlatt goes on to complement Tubbo, despite the many times he may mess up, he's still Schlatt's right hand man. Schlatt then proceeded to hand the mic over to Tubbo, and let him commence on with his speech.
  </p>
  <p key="063a5dd1-d040-445d-82bf-34e2e733b9bb">
   As Tubbo goes on with his speech, Fundy tries to shoot a zombie that comes near Schlatt, but almost hits Schlatt instead. Techno then kills Fundy, as he almost murdered his own president.
  </p>
  <p key="2c112526-19c8-4664-ac87-31ddc6847907">
   At the very end of his speech, Tubbo said the code line in a very casual voice, just as Schlatt asks him if there was anything else he wanted to say. Schlatt then hands Quackity some yellow concrete powder, and starts boxing Tubbo in at the throne. Wilbur runs to press the button, but can't find a way to get there. However, he turns to see Tubbo being boxed in, and runs immediately back to Tommy to see what is happening.
  </p>
  <p key="db19e463-00f2-4638-bb4b-0d2be3054d64">
   Schlatt revealed that he knew that Tubbo was a spy for Tommy and Wilbur, and that he was committing treason. He stated that he knew what Tubbo was doing, and that it all added up; the tunnels underground that lead to Pogtopia, his absences from events, and his mysterious disappearances. Schlatt called Tubbo a traitor, and that nothing good happened to traitors. He called Techno up to the podium, and asked him to "take care of [Tubbo]". Techno was pressured into killing Tubbo, but in the process, ended up also accidentally killing Schlatt and Quackity, as his crossbow had multi shot fireworks on it. He then turned around and started shooting into the audience, killing several people. This event would become known as the
   Manberg Massacre

   After Techno killed Tubbo, Wilbur yelled at Tommy to go, as he ran to find the button. Tommy pearled to the podium, and started yelling and attacking Techno in disbelief that Techno had actually killed him. Tommy killed Quackity yet again, then killed Ponk, before being hunted down by everyone, and finally being killed by Purpled. In the middle of the chaos, Wilbur ran to find and press the button, but couldn't find it. After the festival, Karl stated he was the one who had found the button and broke it in a tweet., although this was likely a joke.
  </p>
  <p key="4c7e12ee-2599-4f4a-bcb2-307b226b0932">
   Tommy and Tubbo raced to meet back at Pogtopia, while Wilbur stayed in Manberg to find a flint and steel to manually set off the TNT. Tommy and Tubbo question Technoblade's loyalty, as he had killed Tubbo, instead of sparing him.
  </p>
  <p key="4d7ce864-8704-4378-b179-4943c2f1b8d2">
   Everyone gathered back at the podium as the mayhem calmed down. As a result of Tubbo now being ousted from Pogtopia, Fundy was promoted to Tubbo's position, and became Schlatt's new right hand man.
  </p>
  <p key="61abb781-1629-46ab-99d4-ef5fccb12cfb">
   However,
   Nihachu
   yelled at Schlatt, asking how he could execute Tubbo. She finally breaks, and yells that she didn't even want to be in Manberg. Schlatt told Niki, "You don't want in in this country, you can get the fuck out of here." Niki didn't seem too bothered by this, having already moved out due to previously being imprisoned. Wilbur approached the podium, with no disguise, or any attempt to hide himself. Schlatt told him that he really let Tubbo "do that" (be a spy), and it was like he was watching a two faced person. Schlatt revealed that he understood the tunnels that Tubbo had built, implying that he knew where Pogtopia was.
  </p>
  <p key="27afe054-9c9a-49d5-9bf6-57fa7fd1087f">
   Wilbur told Schlatt that if he was going to kill anyone else there, to kill him, and not anybody else. Schlatt said that he wouldn't kill anybody else, and asked, "What, do I look like the bad guy?" To which Techno responded, "Well yeah, kinda." Techno defended himself by saying that he did do his job, and joked that it wasn't in his contract. Tommy suddenly appeared and asked, "Techno, what contract?" Techno explained that it was a verbal contract, and that you're legally binded to it in California. He tried to reassure Tommy that he was trying to help Wilbur, but Wilbur was making it hard for him to help them.
  </p>
  <p key="438d57e4-92e3-47ce-9163-ab61c7a431f9">
   After Schlatt said that he was planning on executing Niki in addition to Tubbo, Wilbur told Niki to run, before starting to attack everyone around him, and another battle ensued. Fundy and Quackity told Schlatt that he was being careless, and that he shouldn't murder another person during the festival. Wilbur and Technoblade get out of Manberg, but Niki is killed (Non-Canonically) by a persisting Ponk. Ponk is then slain by Tommy once again. Niki respawns in the boxing arena, runs out of Manberg, and tries to find her way to Pogtopia.

  <p key="fd3f144b-073e-41f2-8110-320adc8eb233">
   Tommy went back to Pogtopia to scrap together what little pieces of equipment he could pull together, while Tubbo stole armor and weapons from the chests in Ninja's Drug Alley. They regrouped in the tunnels near Tubbo's bunker, and got back into Manberg, but are noticed by Antfrost, who alerts Badboyhalo and awesamdude. They run over to Tommy and Tubbo, who then escape out of Manberg through the tunnels.

   As the Pogtopians escaped, Quackity, Schlatt and Fundy met in the White House and Fundy exclaimed that the festival has been ruined. Schlatt revealed that he didn’t care what happened to the festival since Tubbo, a traitor, had planned it. Quackity asked Schlatt how he knew that Tubbo was a traitor, as he was so confident about it.
  </p>
  <p key="f3267d9d-8416-4d31-aeb3-d5ec857fe00a">
   Schlatt said that he did some calculus and geometry, and the pieces started adding up in his head. He said that a "dark, disgusting" side of Tubbo was shown, and asked Quackity and Fundy if they remembered Tubbo's library. They replied yes, and Schlatt went on about how Tubbo kept going down there every single day, and was chilling there with "Lover Boy" (Wilbur) and Tommy. Schlatt revealed that he had explored the tunnels that Tubbo had built, and had found the entrance to what he described as "a fucking cave these people have been living in". This revealed that Schlatt now knew the location of Pogtopia, but this information was not passed on to any of the Pogtopians, who had no clue that Schlatt knew where they had been hiding. When asked about also trying to execute Niki, he laughed and said she was annoying anyway and wouldn't be missed.

  <p key="73668448-4ca7-4d82-8bea-59a038e55db4">
   Ant, Bad and Sam spotted Tommy and Tubbo escaping through the tunnels, and tried to find the entrance and where they had gone. Suddenly, they see Tommy and Tubbo pop up from the bunker again. Once Tommy and Tubbo see them, they immediately backtrack back into the tunnel, but not before Ant, Bad and Sam follow them into the tunnel, and explore Tubbo's bunker a little bit. They go back up to meet Schlatt at the dunk tank, as he had stated that there was no one left there at the celebration.

   After moving calls, Tommy yelled at Techno, and asked him why he killed Tubbo. Techno told him that he was put under a large amount of peer pressure, which was why he did it. Tommy told him that he could have just killed Schlatt, but Techno protested by saying that he did inadvertently kill Schlatt and Quackity.
  </p>
  <p key="91b6964d-8a48-4943-9967-7feaf3bba111">
   Wilbur told Tommy that this just proved his point, that no one was on their side, not even the people they thought they could trust. He continued on by saying that people only listen to the people who have the most power, and that no one cared nor had any honor in this situation. To Wilbur, it wasn't about him; it was about blowing up Manberg.
  </p>
  <p key="bc2330b5-9aa8-4575-bdca-df6c55131c62">
   Tommy asked Wilbur once again where the button was, and Wilbur told him that it was over the hill, but again, he couldn't find the button. Wilbur told him that he had built a room for it and all, but just couldn't find the button. Tommy asked Tubbo if he wanted to look for the button, and Tubbo agreed to come with him. They pop out of the bunker, but are spotted by Ant, Bad and Sam, as mentioned before. They run back to Pogtopia without being chased.
  </p>
  <p key="7a3909dd-e154-4597-b74a-c1010da36c8a">
   Niki finds her way to Pogtopia, as Wilbur states that no one actually cared once again, and that everyone was just there to commit chaos. He questions Techno about why he was really there, and Techno admits that he was there for the chaos, but to be fair, he had been upfront about wanting anarchy from the start. Tommy said that Techno didn't mean to kill Schlatt, but he did mean to kill Tubbo. Techno tried to protest again that he was under peer pressure to do so, but Tommy stated that there was no fair in this situation, and asked him if he just bent to peer pressure, to which Techno responded, "Yes, immediately."
  </p>
  <p key="53e87527-5b0b-4780-9c07-d39b805108f1">
   Wilbur laughs, and stated that it was exactly what he predicted. He said that for today, Manberg would be safe, and he wouldn't blow it up, obviously due to the button being destroyed. Niki was confused, and Wilbur told her that he didn't mention to her that he was going to blow up Manberg. Niki quietly said, "But it's your country......"
  </p>
  <p key="2055765c-56cd-400b-8daf-10babab3f4e0">
   The Pogtopians regrouped back at their base, with the addition of Tubbo and Niki. Wilbur told Tommy that he forgave Techno for killing Tubbo, and would do so in a heartbeat. Tommy protested, saying that he didn't forgive Techno for killing Tubbo. Tommy told Techno that he could get out of Pogtopia, to which Techno replied, "Do you really think you can take down Manberg without my help?" Tommy told him that he could stand next to his president.
  </p>
  <p key="4cc17062-37c6-4c7e-b804-1bf18647f6a0">
   Wilbur then turned to Tubbo, and told him to tell Techno how much he hated him. He egged Tubbo on by mentioning that he had killed him in front of a crowd, to which Tubbo said, "Yeah, screw you," in a very unenthusiastic voice. Tommy confronted Techno over the fact that the whole reason why he joined the server was to take down the government, yet he had just complied with the same government he wanted to take down. While they were talking, Wilbur decided to make a "combat hole".
  </p>
  <p key="75a1f572-61b1-4222-afb2-6f4cf6b707cf">
   Niki asked Tommy to talk to her in private for a second, and Tommy agreed. Niki told him that she was getting very weird vibes from Wilbur, and asked if he was ok. Tommy responded no, and that he had gone insane, as shown by him wanting to blow up Manberg. Niki said that it was his country, and that he had fought for it. She sadly asked, "What happened?". Tommy replied, "He's become the villain, Niki."

   Instead of trying to resolve the conflict, Wilbur egged Tommy on to fight Techno in the combat hole. Tommy agreed, and Wilbur told Tubbo to rile Tommy up before the fight. Tubbo told them that he did kind of forgive Techno, as he was under a lot of peer pressure, and that he had just gained fans, which should be seen as a win for them. Tommy interjected, saying that Techno had literally betrayed him, and that they could have taken back Manberg. Tubbo reminded them that even if they were to blow up Manberg, it wouldn't be a win, as they would just start from ground zero all over again. Wilbur asked Tubbo if they shouldn't fight in the pit, but Tubbo gives in and says to just let them fight in the pit. Before they start dueling, Wilbur provoked Tommy by saying he would never be president, because he followed his emotions too strongly, and wasn't driven by political goals.
  </p>
  <p key="6a3c68c9-61aa-481b-83b8-f8bf459ba1aa">
   Tommy told Techno that he wasn't doing this for Wilbur, he was doing it because he betrayed Tubbo. They dueled, and Techno won.
  </p>
  <p key="f0d18809-64b5-44a3-af48-651c48bfb158">
   Before leaving for the day, Wilbur told Techno that he didn't care if Techno was on their side or not, as long as he was willing to cause mass destruction and chaos with Wilbur. Techno agreed, and stated that he had the ability to unleash two creatures that could cause mass destruction, hinting towards the six Wither Skulls in his possession. Wilbur asked if the next time he was going to blow up Manberg, that Techno would be there to pop some Withers in, to which Techno agreed.

  <p key="66cd9c57-c8bc-44f2-ae3c-5a0fef2cace4">
   Fully convinced that Wilbur had gone crazy, Tommy, Tubbo and Niki realized that they couldn't let this happen. They decided to sit together and listen to one of Tommy's discs, "Blocks" as the sun set. Tommy asked Tubbo to take off his suit, and never wear it again, and Tubbo agreed. Tommy said that they had to build back up, and that they were going to get back L'Manberg, but they weren't there to tear everything else down; instead, they were there to reclaim what was theirs. He stated that Schlatt was a villain who only wanted his own power, but didn't trust anyone else.
  </p>
  <p key="6ef54c08-fbed-438e-94fd-4f5c0d69b738">
   Tommy continued on by saying that he had thought that everyone was happy under Schlatt's rule, but evidently, they weren't; Tubbo was essentially just a minion for Schlatt. He said that they needed to get more people on their side, and to expand Pogtopia by making more rooms and such. They also needed to get more gear, preferably better than what they had before. Because now they weren't just trying to take down Schlatt, they were going to have to take down everyone else as well.
  </p>
  <p key="f197d5c0-c586-4c10-85de-108f0d8fb043">
   As the sun disappears, Niki says 'We will figure something out.' Reassuring the others that L'Manberg can still be saved.

   Meanwhile, back in Manberg, Schlatt, Quackity, Fundy and Ponk met up with Ant, Bad and Sam at the dunk tank. Ponk offered up a sacrificial cat named "Sacrifice" intended for killing during the festival proceedings. Schlatt murders the cat without hesitation, which disgusts the onlookers, except for Ponk. Up until this point, Ant, Bad and Sam's position in the rebellion had been unclear and unknown. But after witnessing the cat murder, the three members made up their minds, and decided that they could not side with a cat killer.
  </p>
  <p key="f72b637f-fc36-4367-b918-55ceb3286971">
   Schlatt reinforced his idea to take down the Camarvan, due to its "ugliness" and replace it with an large apartment complex called the "Manberg Hotel". He also made plans to build a "freedom statue" on the election podium to commemorate the execution of a traitor (Tubbo). Quackity and Fundy advised Schlatt against taking down the Camarvan and tried to find alternative options that could satisfy him. Ant, Bad and Sam, who were attempting to run away, raced back to protect the van after hearing about Schlatt's plan to dismantle it. Bad sided with Fundy and Quackity and told Schlatt not to destroy the Camarvan, stating its historical importance to the server as a whole. They eventually agreed not to tear it down, but at the very least they would put a wall around it. Sam attempted to shoot Schlatt, but failed. Schlatt then attempted to murder Antfrost, thinking that he was a cat due to his skin and Bad defended him.
  </p>
  <p key="c5a6810c-329c-4a91-8bfe-84e3dfefa937">
   The trio decided to attempt to kill Schlatt again, and they succeeded, with Sam shooting Schlatt with his bow and killing him. A few minutes later, Sam shot and killed Schlatt again. Ant, Bad and Sam met in a different call, and they discussed what had just happened. They all agreed that killing the cat had gone too far, and also the language that Schlatt was using was something that a president should not use. Sam proposed that they could start a nation, as he had his secret mountain base that was far away from the rest of the server, and he had unlimited resources. Bad and Ant agreed.
  </p>
  <p key="9da962c9-85f8-49c5-957e-7f370a8c23b7">
   Bad proposed that unlike the other nations, they didn't have to become violent, and try and take over each other's land; instead, those who wanted to live peacefully under their banner of freedom could do so. They decided to make the mansion and Sam's base their main bases, and Ant asked if Bad could get Skeppy to join their nation. Bad said that he could probably get Skeppy to join them, and Sam said he might be able to get George and Sapnap, his current roomates, on their side. They realized that they needed to get Punz on their side, as Punz was usually the deciding factor in all of the wars previously.

   Schlatt continued to make plans to demolish ugly structures in Manbergian territory and brought up the original White House behind the podium, which had been built by Wilbur, Tommy and Quackity before the election. Quackity strongly disagreed with him as it was his build and it have been constructed during a time of peace. Schlatt and Quackity argued over what to do with the White House and they eventually planned to reach a conclusive decision at a later time. As an alternative, Fundy showed Schlatt the unused Second White House that he had built before the election and gave him the option to relocate there, which Schlatt considered.
  </p>
  <p key="5893b9df-ea7e-4190-b0db-2749eaa7b1c0">
   After Schlatt finally logged off, Quackity, in private, stated that Schlatt kept undermining his authority and did not respect his opinions on any matter. He mentioned that if the original White House was gone when he logged on next, there would be an "issue", hinting towards a possible betrayal.
  </p>
  <p key="96d41433-51af-4693-bef3-f659a6662c54">
   While exploring around Manberg, Fundy stumbled across Tubbo's bunker, and decided to investigate. He followed the tunnel all the way down to the end, and found Pogtopia. He wandered around the base for a little bit, and recognized signs of Tommy and Wilbur, which confirmed that it was their base. Fundy decided that he needed to talk to Tubbo in private.
  </p>
  <p key="07b726e6-2ca4-42b9-8e4f-1117dc9628e2">
   Fundy admitted that Schlatt had started off as a great leader, but it wasn't what the nation needed, despite all the work he had done. Just like Ant, Bad and Sam, Fundy was just as upset over Schlatt killing the cat. However, Fundy wasn't entirely sure what exactly his plans were, or what side he supported. He decided to start writing in his spy's diary once again, and wrote about the troubles that had just occurred. Fundy was conflicted on whether or not Tubbo betraying Manberg was for better or for the worst. He concluded that before making any more decisions, he needed to talk to Tubbo first.
