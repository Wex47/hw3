   is a faction that was formed by various server members who were neutral during
   The Manberg Rebellion
   , with the goal of maintaining eternal conflict between the other factions. Its original members were

   Antfrost

   Awesamdude
   , with
   Skeppy
   joining the faction later, just before the
   Manberg vs Pogtopia War

   Pogtopia
   and

    Manberg

   . This faction is one of the most developed militarily, as all of its citizens are equipped with full enchanted netherite armor, potions and tridents. The faction is currently primarily inactive, due to its citizens mainly focusing on the conflict surrounding

   The three members were already on bad terms with Schlatt after he had killed two cats for no reason in front of them. These events, coupled with their choice of not wanting to support
   Pogtopia
   , led them to form a third party, the Badlands. They decided to form a council rather than choose a leader for their faction and planned to recruit other members to their cause. Their first course of action was to claim all of the lands around Pogtopia and

After Bad and Sam rushed in to defend Ant, and Sapnap chased them away, Punz and Sapnap retrieved the panda, only for Punz to accidentally kill it with the thorns aspect on his armor.

   As the date of the
   Manberg vs Pogtopia War
   was announced, Bad and Sam both claimed that the Badlands would support the Pogtopian effort against Manberg. However, a few days later, while the members searched for pandas, Bad discussed their faction's true plans for the war on November 16. He stated that they would only fight on the side of Pogtopia to keep the conflict going, and would switch to Manberg's side if they began to appear weak. Their main goal was to continue the war for as long as possible and cause eternal chaos between both factions. Their secondary goal was to have their claimed land officially recognized by the King of the Dream SMP, who was

   at that point in time. Bad designed a banner for their faction, and the members placed these banners at the entrances of Ant’s animal sanctuary, Skeppy and Bad's mansion, and Sam’s mountain base, to mark their territory.
  </p>
  <p key="ea29aec5-8174-485c-8944-7f589418e21d">
   Hours before the battle was set to begin,
   Skeppy
   officially joined the other three members in the Badlands and helped them gear up for the war. During the war, the four members followed the Pogtopians closely, but did not directly interact with them. As the war concluded, and the Badlands members witnessed

   form
   their new government
   , they switched to
   Technoblade
   's side, after he revealed his plans to continue the destruction of L'Manberg using his two withers. Together with Techno, and the Dream SMP's main military force (consisting of Dream, Sapnap and Punz), they wreaked havoc within the borders of the re-established L'Manberg, destroying the land further and attacking the citizens who tried to fight the withers.
  </p>
  <p key="33b98782-a4e9-4547-9d77-761adfa9a7b2">
   After the withers were killed and Technoblade began to retreat from the area, the Badlands members gathered together and declared victory for their faction. Their reasoning was that they had achieved their primary goal, and now, there was an entirely new conflict forming between New L'Manberg and the anarchists.
  </p>
  <p key="f6111a89-b4e8-416e-ac8f-2b1a58116842">
   The Badlands then tried to recruit Eret, saying that the king's help would go a long way to help them legitimize their claims, since they wanted to use his castle. They were then informed by Dream that Eret had already been dethroned and
   George
   was the new king. Bad suggested that they could kill George and then ownership of the castle would move to Eret who might then want to join the Badlands. They abandoned the plan later on.
  </p>
  <p key="66feb052-8909-4319-9762-dbb003a11bb5">
   They then tried to convince George instead to formally acknowledge the Badlands' independence and land ownership, but George refused their offer. Later on, Bad discussed with Dream, where he agreed to recognize George's kingship in exchange for Dream giving the Badlands technical independence, by which the Dream SMP faction still recognized the Badlands' territory as their own, but would call it the Badlands to avoid conflict for now, in a similar way to L'Manberg
   .

  <p key="484e0bde-294d-47ea-8a45-10432a6d84bf">
   Bad stated that the Badlands would only support Mexican L'Manberg if their faction and territories were officially honored by George. Bad reiterated his faction's initial objective, which was to be granted all of the lands beyond Eret's castle and Skeppy and Bad’s mansion. Their land would be two infinitely long strips of the entire server, that enclose the central warring nations from two different sides. Bad claimed that he would maintain peace in their own territory, as a neutral third party.
  </p>
  <p key="3bfd5e80-86f1-43ec-9faa-3f8e347ca0e6">
   Quackity, George, and Sapnap rejected Bad's offer, stating that he was being unreasonable and asking for too much land. They mention that even the current king, Eret would share the same opinion as them. They tried to compromise by suggesting that Bad could take half of the proposed land, either the area past the castle or the area past the mansion. However, Bad replied that he wanted no less than 100% of the land, saying that “Trying for all is better than settling for half”.

   As Quackity and Bad continued to negotiate, their meeting was interrupted by Dream, who attacked Quackity, forcing the others to flee. Bad ultimately decided not to side with Mexican L'Manberg, planning to find an alternative option to get the Badlands recognized.

    - Due to the Badlands holding a sizeable amount of territory for their small faction, they are able to acquire large amounts of resources quickly, using them for war purposes. They also have one of the best redstone engineers on the server (Sam). This allows them to make extremely efficient automated farms that will allow them to create powerful enchants to apply to their armor and weapons.

     Potions

    - Unlike most of the factions who use conventional weapons (swords, bows, crossbows, tridents, etc.), the Badlands use potions on a wide scale. Due to their redstone engineer creating an automatic potion brewer (a.k.a "a Drug Machine" dubbed by Tommy), the Badlands can create vast amounts of beneficial potions to enhance their combat effectiveness as well as create some harmful potions that will weaken their enemy's combat effectiveness.

   The Badlands claim all land south of Eret's castle and all land north of Bad and Skeppy's mansion - essentially all the land on the server. However, they have no control over almost any of their land and no one recognizes their claims either.

BadBoyHalo also claims that Kinoko is encroaching on Badlands territory.
