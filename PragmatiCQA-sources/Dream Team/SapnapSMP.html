   Sapnap is a human with white skin, black hair, and midnight-blue eyes. He wears a t-shirt with a flame design on it over a long-sleeved black tee, black pants, and black checkerboard shoes. He also wears a white bandana around his head.

  </h2>
  <p key="2e892fb2-6963-4f4e-b096-923dfc2be3d9">
   Sapnap is hot-headed and stubborn, and fiercely loyal. He is a bit of a class clown type, and can seem a bit stupid at times. He refuses to back down from a fight and enjoys causing chaos by playing pranks on others. However, he can also be shy and lacks social confidence around others, as pointed out by
   TommyInnit
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b223f0f7-98f1-4abf-863a-39c76d0c941c">
   Sapnap also shows a strong protective streak, especially towards those that he cares about, like his fianc√©s and Kinoko Kingdom.

  <p key="59418336-af6a-4373-ad79-2cee20c225da">
   During the
   Final Pet War
   , Sapnap realized that words were far more powerful than weapons. Sapnap became somewhat peaceful, only using violence as a joke with his friends or as a last resort when diplomacy failed. Sapnap decided that he had to remake amends with people he had wronged, just like
   Wilbur Soot
   before his corruption.

  <p key="ca179b9d-4f45-42c5-863c-fa6006d9979c">
   Wilbur has said that Sapnap's D&amp;D alignment is true neutral.

Early on in the war, Sapnap supported the L'Manbergian ideology and even seemed in on the idea. However, due to him being an American and not European, he was denied membership. Due to this, Sapnap stayed loyal to Dream and fought with him. Sapnap and Dream executed Tommy and Tubbo in response to the
   Declaration of Independence

   Sapnap was then challenged by Fundy to a 1v1 duel to resolve this whole dispute, and the conditions were that if Sapnap won, he would get his pets back, and Fundy would accept defeat and move on. If Fundy won, he would keep Sapnap's pets, get his items back, and Sapnap must leave L'Manberg. Sapnap won the duel. At the end, he mirrored the events of
   Fundy's bee game
   , by taking Niki's fish and threatened to burn them and telling Fundy to pick one. Nonetheless, he revealed that it was just a trick and he gave Fundy the fish, telling him that he fought well.

Sapnap tried to keep the peace between the two (to no avail), initially thinking Karl was making an insensitive joke, but later noting that something was up with Karl - presumably referring to his memory loss. During the falling out, Karl told Sapnap as the Head of Military to make Quackity leave Kinoko. After that, Sapnap tried to reassure Quackity, but while Quackity allowed Sapnap to visit Las Nevadas, most likely removing him from the citizenship blacklist, he refused to allow Karl in, leaving Sapnap stuck in the middle in the conflict.

   On the day of the breakout, Sapnap was hanging around with Ponk, Callahan, Punz, and several other SMP members. They were placing a order at McPuffy when Sam came running up and telling them that Dream is escaping and everyone should head to the south side of the prison immediately. They went over to the prison, followed by Tommy. Tommy seemed very freaked out while Sapnap reassures him that they would keep him safe. After some time later, they were met with Technoblade, Dream, Connor for some reason, and Ranboo, escaping the prison. Sapnap then fires arrows at Dream, and a full-blown fight broke off. Dream was trying to escape, fighting several SMP members and was trying to tell Technoblade that they have to go. Sapnap then spots Niki spawning in the withers, which were causing a lots of trouble. Niki then flees with Dream, Technoblade and Philza. Sapnap chased them down but was accidentally blocked by Eryn. Then, a meeting was summoned with all SMP members that were at the prison. Sapnap and Punz then split up to search for Dream.

   Sapnap went to Snowchester, as he figured that Dream would want his set of armor back, and the armor set was hidden there. He got to the armor and took it, along with Dream's sword. Then, he hid below a trapdoor, waiting for Dream. Dream then made his appearence there, and Sapnap made his move. Dream was surprised that he was there, then tried to convinced Sapnap to give him his armor, but Sapnap refused. Sapnap said that he wasn't suppose to escape, and he should return to the prison. Dream said that he doesn't want to rot in the prison and get tortured. Sapnap then asked who tortured him, and Dream answered that Quackity was torturing him to get information on the revival book.

   Dream then asks again for his armor back, and said that if he gave him the armor, he would go away. Sapnap didn't believe him, and Dream approached Technoblade, who was spying on them from afar with Tubbo. Dream gave Technoblade the Axe of Peace, and Technoblade left with Tubbo. Dream then blocked the entrance with some obsidian so that he could talk with Sapnap. They then argue with each other about the armor, and Sapnap said that he knows this is just the beginning, and he would not give Dream the armor. Sapnap then said that if he wants the armor, he will have to take it from him. Dream said that he doesn't want to fight, and it can end peacefully. Sapnap said that he was itching for a fight, and that he could pay a visit to Kinoko Kingdom. Dream then said that he would find where that is, and pearled out of the place. Sapnap chased him down. Dream threatened about blowing up Kinoko Kingdom with TNT, and repeatedly asked Sapnap for his armor back. They then proceed to keep fighting each other. Dream kept talking about Kinoko Kingdom. Sapnap then chased Dream down and said that he doesn't have a choice, but lost track of him. He searched everywhere in Snowchester, but couldn't find him.

   Sapnap then rushed back to Kinoko Kingdom to meet Karl. He told Karl that Kinoko Kingdom is not safe, and Karl asked why. Sapnap told Karl that Dream is out again, and Dream is not happy that Sapnap took his stuff.  Karl said that's messed up, and asked why he took his stuff. Sapnap asked what he meant, then explained if Dream gets this armor, he would feel good in it and would do whatever he wanted to. Karl said that he is the head of military, and he would follow his direction, but if his kingdom gets hurt, he would be severely disappointed. Sapnap was still confused on why Karl is acting weird, but said that Kinoko Kingdom needs to prepare for war. Karl said that he would get Tina, while Sapnap began to prepare.

      Bad is Sapnap's father, he apparently found him under a rock and took him in. Bad has described Sapnap as a "happy accident." Bad fought alongside Sapnap during the
      Battle of the Lake
      after he was framed by Tommy and Dream for burning down the Eiffel Tower. Sapnap is mostly unaware of Bad's relationship with

      Sapnap, much like George, was also Dream's best friend, and he often followed along with Dream's actions.
      <p key="e552f6b2-9b70-4351-a90a-31464cb25cfc">
       However, Sapnap found out about Dream's monologue to Tommy about his relationship with the discs, and how they were the only thing he cared about on the server. George was then dethroned, and Sapnap took his place on George's side. The opposing sides had an argument, but it leads to both of them getting what they wanted.

       Dream's relationship with Sapnap deteriorated tremendously in later months. Sapnap did not side with Dream on multiple occasions, including the Doomsday War against L'Manberg. During the Disc Confrontation, he was one of the people on Tommy's side, and personally took Dream to the Pandora's Vault himself along with other ex-Dream SMP Faction members. Sapnap has also remarked that he would take Dream's last canon life if he escaped the prison before he was let out by the other members.
      </p>
      <p key="059c7051-4492-4bea-b350-8632b4747731">
       Despite this, Sapnap seems to genuinely believe that Dream can be good and has encouraged him to have better behavior. He still seems to care about Dream a lot and considers him his best friend, despite stating he's been personally hurt by Dream.
      </p>
      <p key="c29471d5-bc3c-41e5-8068-1ef50939e577">
       However, when Dream escaped from Pandora's Vault, he attempted to bargained with and eventually tried to kill his former friend, Sapnap, over his old set of armour, as well as threatening to destroy Kinoko Kingdom if he did not comply. After this, Sapnap teamed up with Tommy for killing Dream.

      . Their relationship has been compared to that of a younger and older brother, and though Punz has been on the receiving end of many of Sapnap's antics, they rarely hold grudges against each other, Punz forgiving Sapnap for burning down his house and accidentally killing his fox. Punz has helped Sapnap with the construction of builds such as Sapnap's secret base and the Eiffel Tower. Though they have a good relationship, their factions are currently at odds; Punz is responsible for being Dream's spy and second in command, while Sapnap became a member of El Rapids following his falling out with Dream and the Greater Dream SMP. This puts them into occasional conflict, with Punz being ready to fight Sapnap if Dream commands it. They have fought against each other during the Greater Dream SMP Civil War and during the Battle of the Lake. However, during the Doomsday War, the two fought alongside each other on L'Manberg's side (although Punz was acting as Dream's spy at the time), killing a wither together, to Sapnap's delight.
