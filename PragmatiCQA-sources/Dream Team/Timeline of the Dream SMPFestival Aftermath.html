    The next day,
    Tommy
    joined with a vendetta. He traveled to Manberg with the intention of killing Quackity and Schlatt. Tommy listened to the men as they planned out what they'd do next. Schlatt wanted to stick with his plan of deconstructing The White House, which Quackity still disagreed with. The men began to argue as Tommy listened from a distance.

      Schlatt screamed at Quackity, commanding him to destroy the White House, which he reluctantly started to do. Tommy aimed at Schlatt with the intention to kill him, but as he listened to them argue, he decided not to shoot. As Schlatt continued to harass his Vice President, Quackity quickly became fed up with how he was being treated and decided to resign. Quackity then killed Schlatt and retreated from Manberg.

    Tommy mounted his horse and chased Quackity into the woods. When Tommy caught up to Quackity, the two of them talked about what Tommy had just witnessed. Quackity told him that he wanted to overthrow Schlatt. Tommy then asked if Quackity wanted to join Pogtopia, which Quackity did.

    Wilbur tried to press the button but was restrained with cobblestone by Tommy and Quackity. They conversed for a long time, trying to convince Wilbur not to destroy it all. Wilbur then escaped the cobblestone, and stood staring at Tommy, who blocked Wilbur from pressing the button. Calmly, Wilbur asked him to move, which Tommy did. After a long moment of silence, Wilbur broke the button.
