   Sam was a friendly neutral party on the server and a sweet person, wanting to help people and often going around and offering them pumpkin pie. However, he was also a member of the Badlands, a faction aiming to cause chaos on the server, and was willing to do morally grey things for personal gain, such as building Pandora’s Vault as a commission

   Sam, after becoming the warden of Pandora’s Vault, became very committed to his duty. His personality completely shifts when someone wants to enter the prison, becoming cold and stern. He prioritizes keeping Dream locked in prison above all else, even the welfare of his dog Fran.
   He will harshly uphold the rules of the prison, going to the lengths of torturing Ponk and cutting off his arm for stealing keycards.
   His mental health is clearly degrading, with trauma caused by being trapped with the Egg and from spending so much time in close contact with Dream. This leads him to make bad decisions, as well as to seek solace away from the rest of the server.
   While he still believes what he is doing is morally good, from an outsider POV it can often appear not to be.

   Sam's enlistment in the Badlands put him against Pogtopia and Manberg. However, he had personally established good relations with the members of Pogtopia. When they heard that Dream allied with Manberg and betrayed Pogtopia, the Badlands sided with the Pogtopians.

Sam was somewhat conflicted, as he was loyal to the Badlands but also wanted to maintain positive relationships with both Tommy and Tubbo.

   Sam continued his work on the Guardian XP Farm and also attended Schlatt's funeral. After the funeral, he arrived at BadBoyHalo's mansion with Quackity, Puffy, Bad, and Punz, where Quackity revealed his true ambitions to resurrect Schlatt and use him as a political figure to overthrow Tubbo. Bad, Sam, and Punz pledged loyalty to Quackity, allowing him to carry on with his plan. Quackity gave Sam Schlatt's organs so that they could resurrect Schlatt on a night with a full moon. However, Sam and the rest of the couple questioned the plan. Sam didn't want to betray his friends Tubbo and Tommy, Bad did not care about the plan due to him having larger priorities, and Punz was fearful due to an old saying that when a living being is revived, that person will return stronger and more vile/evil than before. Sam kept the remains within his base so it is unsure of what he will decide. This event is most likely non-canonical, as it was never brought up again.

   Dream recruited Sam to build Pandora's Vault, a maximum security, inescapable prison. He was given a time limit of 20 days, and began construction in an ocean that is part of Badlands territory. BadBoyHalo was upset about his shoreline, but Sam and Dream explained the situation to him, and excited him about the rise in property value.

Bad has since come to his senses and stopped himself and others from being controlled by the vines. Sam was psychologically impacted by the Crimson, terrified by how fast it spread and how it impacted his friends, and fellow faction members. He claims the Crimson spreads "bad juju."

They told him that they made a faction called the 'Eggpire' in an attempt to control the whole server. Sam wasn't happy about this, and neither was Puffy who was only there to gain information and destroy the Egg. Despite Ant and Bad trying to convince him, he deflected their attempts about the Egg being able to help them. Puffy then brought his attention to Ant's change of color, and Sam grew even more adamant that Ant and Bad were crazy.

   Sam was later tricked and trapped by Bad and Ant in an obsidian chamber above the Egg for a few days, exposing him to its influence. He was rescued by Tommy and Puffy. Sam's judgment and opinions seemed to have shifted after he was rescued, seeming confused and woozy. When asked how he felt about the Egg, Sam stated that the Egg was ‘pretty okay' which alarmed Tommy and Puffy. Puffy also pointed out the red gem on Sam's crown seemed to be pulsating or seemed to be beating in a way. Sam was supposedly forced to eat himself by the Egg when asked about the experience.

Sam then broke down, telling Ranboo that Dream had laughed when Tommy was killed, and that during his imprisonment, Dream had talked almost exclusively about Tommy. He also said he had a reason to believe Dream would never kill Tommy, and that he would never let Tubbo visit Dream for the same reason.

   On September 14, Quackity requested a prison visit to Techno and Dream, in an attempt to obtain the revive book. He ordered Sam not to step in, no matter what. When Quackity started threatening to kill Dream and Techno, Sam called for Quackity to stop, but refrained from stepping in. When Techno mysteriously vanished from the prison cell, panic ensued. They searched the prison for him, but to no avail. Sam and Quackity returned to the main cell to find that Dream had vanished as well. In panic, Sam locked down the prison and turned on the prison alarm. Quackity demanded Sam to unlock it so he could rush to prepare to defend Las Nevadas from any kind of attack. Quackity gave Sam one last order: Search the prison for Dream and Techno. Sam agreed, and unlocked the prison so Quackity could escape.

   Immediately, Sam began searching the prison for Dream. After searching every room, he re-checked the main cell and found Dream hiding in a hole he and Techno had dug earlier. Sam was furious but relieved that Dream hadn't escaped. Dream begged Sam not to tell Quackity, as Dream argued that Quackity would kill him. After a long conversation, Sam reluctantly agreed to keep Dream's location a secret. Sam also expressed that he thought Dream commissioned the prison for Tommy, and purposefully altered Sam's original ideas for the prison to be more inhumane so Tommy would suffer.

   Sam visited Ranboo at his house, the next day, to tell him that he needed to be arrested. Despite Ranboo saying that he didn't want to be imprisoned anymore, Sam insisted, saying he knew why Ranboo wanted to be locked up before and now agreed with him. Ranboo hesitatingly followed him, asking how long he would be in the prison. Sam answered that it depended on how long things took, but he would need to get some information. He took all of Ranboo's items, except some food, and guided him to the prison.

   On November 28, Sam and Bad were summoned into the prison by their stasis chambers, indicating that the prisoners had broken something. After dying and being re-equipped with prison armor and tools, they investigated and found Technoblade and Dream breaking out. They tried to stop them, with Bad dying multiple times in the process. They blocked up the prison's entrance route, not knowing Techno had broken in through another area. Sam then asked Bad to give him five minutes to warn everyone and pull a lever on a stasis chamber to summon him back.

   He started warning everyone that Dream was escaping. He then travelled to Las Nevadas to warn Quackity. Quackity was very angry since he had been told earlier that Dream had already escaped, and they could have made better security measures for Dream after Techno's escape. Sam convinced them, nevertheless, and was teleported back, just in time. Sam and Bad caught Dream, Techno, Ranboo and Connor during the escape and chased them to the outside. They were met with many people attempting to stop Dream. Sam ordered Ranboo to remove his armor by threatening MICHAEL. After Ranboo obeyed, Sam threatened to kill him, hoping to bring Dream back. When Dream refused to return, Sam killed Ranboo. Techno attacked him, but was chased off by the mob of people.

   Bad met Sam in the prison the next day, saying that he had packed and was ready to leave. Sam was watching the cell in case Dream hadn't set his spawn, and might die and spawn back there. Bad tried to convince him that it was futile, but failed and left. Sam later decided to heed his words and left. He talked to himself about how he didn't have a purpose anymore and that no one really tried to stop Dream, not even Bad or Ant. He sealed the prison, locked the doors, and turned off the lights, finally closing the prison for the forseeable future. He travelled back to his getaway island and considered that it wasn't just Dream who was freed, but also him being set free from the prison.

      Sam and Ant had a very positive relationship, which could be seen generally throughout Ant's first days around the server and Sam's return. They could be found roaming around the SMP together a lot, and also formed the Badlands together with Bad. Sam and Ant worked as a team during

After the blood vines spread, Sam repeatedly rejected the Egg's influence, which resulted in Bad and Ant trapping Sam near the Egg and exposing him to it.

Ant holds Sam responsible for the majority of the blame, and confronted him on flaws in the prisons design/planning and information sharing with the guards. Ant would later confront Sam again, along with BadBoyHalo, and criticize his conduct as Warden, including the arrest and killing of Ranboo, before angrily quitting as a prison guard in protest.

Bad took these claims harshly, and (correctly) suspected that Sam was allowing Dream to be tortured by someone from outside the prison off the records and outside visiting hours. Bad confronted Sam along with Antfrost, and accused him of misconduct as the prison's Warden for the arrest of Ranboo, killing of Techno's dog, and suspicious activity in Dream's cell. This angered Sam, who denied the accusations and continued to highlight Bad's supposed failings during the escape. Sam also berated him for his apparent drunkenness, frustrating Bad who repeatedly insisted it was apple juice, to the point that Bad quit his job as a guard in protest, leaving with a call for Sam to come find him when he was ready to be honest with him.

      When the Egg was first discovered, Sam was already weary of the vines, trying to destroy them at every turn. When Bad and Ant were corrupted by the Egg, he was extremely against their plans to take over the server, and their plans to use Tommy and Tubbo. This caused him to be trapped near the Egg, in an attempt to corrupt him and made him suffer for about 14 hours, before being rescued by Puffy and Tommy. Sam was extremely tired and weary. This is likely due to the intense exertion required to keep himself free from the mental effects. It is unknown if he managed to keep up his defenses until he was saved.

       Sam came to his senses and went into his base to find big vines around his base. He managed to clear the vines with TNT and tools, and while doing so, heard the Egg whispering that it would do something to Fran, his most beloved pet. He burnt the remains in soul fire. He then met Ant and Bad in the Egg room, trying to find out what the Egg said to them and what its plan was. He lied to them, saying that the Egg had talked to Sam and told him to go somewhere far away. Ant gave Sam a spore of the Egg, telling him to spread it. Sam awkwardly left the Egg room.

Sam still interacts with Tommy positively, and even requested Tommy's help in testing the Egg's blast-resistance. Sam also expressed anger at Dream when he revealed he thinks Dream commissioned Pandora's Vault for Tommy. This suggests that Sam is still protective of him, even after the events of Tommy's break-in.
