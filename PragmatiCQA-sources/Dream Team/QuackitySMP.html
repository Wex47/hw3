    In a past stream, Quackity counted the death caused by Technoblade's rocket launcher and went according to Wilbur's Reddit list.
    However, in a series of tweets clarifying canon deaths by Dream, Dream stated that only Tubbo's death counted during the festival due to it being scripted.
    Quackity later also confirmed on March 19 that the Manberg Festival death was not canon and he had two canon lives.

   Quackity is a human with light skin, black eyes, and black hair. He wears a blue shirt and black pants in his casual appearance. However, fans tend to draw him closer in appearance to his actor, with a darker skin tone and usually wearing a blue or black beanie.

   arc, he switches to a white shirt (which may have bloodstains), gray trousers held up by gray suspenders, and a red tie. In the case of the latter, Fundy has stated that there are about 17 of the same suits in his closet; while mourning Slime/Charlie, his shirt became crumpled, he lost his suspenders, his hair grew longer, his skin tone was paler (presumably from spending an extensive period of time indoors researching slimes), and he was seen crying. Despite this, he is sometimes seen naked/undressed, mainly for comedic reasons.

   Quackity fluctuates between chaotic and lawful, almost on a whim, but his greatest desire is to have a sense of belonging.
  </p>
  <p key="047e59d2-f5c8-475b-b8ea-9b4f134409b0">
   During his time running for President in the election, he showed off more of a chaotic, rowdy side, which continued until the installment of the
   Jschlatt Administration
   . He also stated during this time period that he believed everyone had some good in themselves and was willing to work for a better future for everyone.
   As time progressed, Quackity realized that Jschlatt had no intentions of giving him any respect or equal power, which was his true desire. He defected to Pogtopia, growing a bit less chaotic and more responsible for his actions. It is also implied that his experiences in Manberg caused him to start becoming disillusioned with the ideal of words over weapons, as his repeated negotiations with Schlatt didn't gain him any respect.
  </p>
  <p key="8e8b048e-4b19-4792-89c7-a012a7141db7">
   Before the final war in the events of the Manberg Rebellion, Quackity and Tubbo spoke candidly about their fears and future, eventually both agreeing to fight the war to the end despite their worries of being outnumbered. After the war, Quackity joined the New L'Manberg as Secretary of State, where he garnered a more important role as a leader while still displaying much of his chaotic nature. During Schlatt's funeral, he cussed out the former leader while pissing on a photo of him.

  <p key="460f2788-f0d4-4a75-b867-3ea70a0d5a76">
   During the events of the Exile Conflict and the Dethroning Fallout, Quackity displayed a level head that hasn't often been seen on his character. While discussing Tommy's griefing of George's house with Tubbo, he wasn't as lenient as he might've been in the past, along with managing to go toe-to-toe arguing with Dream following George's dethroning.

   for not wanting to be alone and left behind by others. There are some implications that most of these traits are shaped by the traumas he had previously endured, and that he was psychologically projecting on them heavily at the time. Nevertheless, despite the morally dark method of recruitment, Quackity treats the members of Las Nevadas well, and is respectful of their opinions. It's also revealed that Quackity has some form of desire to leave behind a legacy.

   Quackity demonstrates a recurring insecurity regarding his physical appearance. During his early appearances on the server, it was mostly played jokingly over his "piss neck", asymmetrical face, and other oddities over his Minecraft-skin, which he claimed to be because of a "condition".
   Later on, it takes on a more serious note as it relates more to his traumatic experiences, from one of the cornerstones of Schlatt's mocking (over his backside) to eventually his facial scar from his duel with Techno.

   , he was often unwilling to act when he knows there is an oppressive power structure or to call out people who hurt him. He would grit his teeth and bear abusive actions, so long as people he knew are safe. At most, he mainly engaged in acts of passive resistance, like freeing Niki from imprisonment in secret. He usually only became proactive when it reached an ultimate boiling point, most prominently seen with Schlatt and his destruction of the White House.

   for knowledge of the revive-book. This is heavily entwined with a vengeful streak, as in those two instances, part of the driving force behind them were revenge for either himself or those that he cares about - the former for blowing up Manberg during the war and more personally, traumatizing him during

   Moreover, despite claiming that Las Nevadas had no room for emotions, Quackity has a very impulsive streak and acts on his emotional instincts more often than logic. He mentioned in the "Foolish joins Las Nevadas" stream that he goes to sleep and often doesn't have a plan on what he'll do the next day.

   arc, Quackity shows a manipulative streak when it comes to recruiting people for his nation, going hand in hand with his charisma. He is also incredibly prone to self-projection during the same endeavors. However, it is also heavily implied that he believes no one would willingly stay by his side unless he holds something over them or tricks them into

   Quackity has also shown a desire for power and control ever since the

   , causing him to be willing to sacrifice morality and justice in exchange for vengeance and control. This is most likely rooted in his experiences in the
   Jschlatt Administration
   , due to his own lack of power and control over the country to make it better during that time period.
  </p>
  <p key="c39c4d37-4950-4d67-aff3-f59383295514">
   To sum up, many of Quackity's character flaws, in some way, correlate to his traumatic experiences in one way or another. One of the known exceptions to this is his petty streak, often doing minor things to annoy or upset people he dislikes, or doing little shows of wealth and character to humiliate someone else.

However, Schlatt brushed off his suggestion, claiming that imprisonment was "not enough". By the end of the Festival, Quackity had started to become disillusioned with Schlatt's rule, but refused to leave because he felt an emotional attachment to the country. When Schlatt shared his new policy, with one of the projects including the dismantling of
   The White House

However, Schlatt changed the topic of the contract to the TNT he had found under Manberg and accused Quackity for the TNT, stating that Quackity hated Manberg and wanted to take Schlatt down with Manberg. Schlatt wounded him, but Wilbur obtained an arrow of invisibility from Ponk that would allow Quackity to escape undetected. Tommy and Quackity met up in the forest, but Wilbur was nowhere to be seen.

In horror, Quackity and Tommy fled to Pogtopia, only to find that it was covered in buttons by Fundy. Wilbur arrived minutes after, to state that he pressed the button but no TNT was ignited. Wilbur was ecstatic about the buttons in Pogtopia, pressing each one to scare Quackity and Tommy. The Pogtopians were then approached by Fundy, who arrived from the underground Prime Path. Quackity was wary of Fundy, as he thought that Fundy was an expert military strategist and much more dangerous than Schlatt. However, Fundy was also an inside spy in Manberg, just like Tubbo. Quackity listened with interest as Wilbur read Schlatt's weaknesses out loud from
   a spy's diary

Quackity was killed by Dream during the meeting as a warning shot, and Dream told him to stay out of the conflict. However, Quackity argued his position, which was that Dream instigated every conflict on the server.

In the end, Quackity managed to negotiate the recognition of Mexican L'Manberg, but in return, the nation would have to be renamed. The name "El Rapids" was adopted, as Quackity was known for sharing the expression, "I'm just chillin' in Cedar Rapids."

Quackity brings up Las Nevadas and yells about how they built an entire country without him. Karl says he knows nothing about Quackity aside from the fact that he took one of his lives, leading to the two being confused. Sapnap tries to break them up as they shout and argue, with Karl asking what history Quackity was yelling about.

       Quackity says that he cares about Bad, misses being friends, and thinks that he is still in there underneath the control of the Egg which adds to his desire to destroy it. When he placed TNT all over it Bad confronted him and tried to stop him.
At the Red Banquet, Quackity confronted Bad again, telling him that he had gone too far. He brought Technoblade and Purpled to fight him and they drove out Bad and the other members of the Eggpire.

At first, Quackity believed it was something that could give him the ultimate power he wished to achieve, but he saw far deeper into the Crimson than any other mortal has on the server. He saw the Crimson corrupting Bad's mind, clouding it. Out of fear, Quackity fled, scared of the effects and symptoms of the Crimson. He was helped in his escape by Karl.

This negative relationship was furthered after George was dethroned by Dream in favor of replacing him with Eret, and Quackity, along with Sapnap, took George's side. After the Exile Conflict, in which Quackity realized that Dream assisted Technoblade with his escape, Quackity was convinced that the Butcher Army needed to get rid of Dream since he always interfered with L'Manbergian affairs. Dream also proved to be a major obstacle in the recognition of Mexican L'Manberg, once again making him feel powerless and convincing him Dream was an extremely tyrannical character.

He watched everything happen while Quackity tried to fight back. When the withers were killed and the TNT had stopped, Fundy told Quackity and others that he was more than happy with what happened. Quackity was disappointed and asked Fundy if his actions really mattered at the end, which left Fundy satisfied, feeling that everyone had learned their lesson. 
Fundy saw Quackity in his dream and that Quackity reminisced on their shared past before telling him that he's worthless unless he joins him. He then woke up to Quackity at his door. Quackity convinced him to come to visit Las Nevadas and told him that he should join after working on himself and developing more self-worth and gave him a plot of land to build anything he wants to on.

However, Quackity stated that he had his own plans regarding the Manberg conflict and Schlatt. Quackity wanted equal power with Schlatt, but Schlatt had total power and refused to give Quackity any semblance of equal power.
Internal conflict developed after Schlatt started calling him "Flatty Patty", and their relationship status started to fluctuate, occasionally getting along well, while sometimes becoming arguably abusive. At some point, Quackity tried to impress Schlatt on multiple occasions, showing that he valued Schlatt's opinion even up until his death
       , only for his attempts to go unacknowledged at best. Quackity also greatly disliked Schlatt's habit of alcoholism.

       during the Festival, and Schlatt secretly commissioned Tubbo's public execution on a day that was supposedly for fun and celebration. Schlatt also rejected Quackity's suggestion of jailing Tubbo instead of executing him, stating that it was "not enough". As Schlatt drifted away from what Quackity thought was right, he promised himself that if Schlatt destroyed the White House, he would leave.

Quackity repeatedly try to protest against Schlatt's decision, but was intimidated by Schlatt into helping destroy it. Schlatt then proceeded to heavily belittle and insult Quackity, leading Quackity to resign from his position as Vice President, eventually killing Schlatt himself after being mocked one too many times.
       After this, Tommy recruited Quackity into joining Pogtopia because of their shared interest in overthrowing Schlatt.

Later on, Wilbur hired Ranboo for his Paradise burger van to oppose Quackity's burger restaurant in Las Nevadas, additionally making them business rivals. Ranboo also seemed upset that Tubbo had agreed to annex the outpost into Las Nevadas territory, indicating that he still saw Quackity as an enemy of sorts.

      , Quackity helped trap Tubbo in a box on the
      L'Manberg Podium
      ,
      thinking Tubbo was to be put in jail, but immediately protested when he realized Tubbo was to be executed.
      The next day, Quackity killed Schlatt and left to join Pogtopia,
      and later apologized to Tubbo.

       , Quackity and Tubbo trusted each other, discussing together who the Pogtopia traitor could be and even considering running away together, although they both made the decision to stay and fight. They also discussed plans to rebuild the Camarvan once they had won back L'Manberg,
       and also agreed that they blamed George for everything that had gone wrong since the election,
       with Tubbo saying that Quackity shouldn't blame himself.
       After the war, Tubbo made Quackity his Secretary of State as part of the
       Tubbo Administration

       During their time working together in the
       Tubbo Administration
       , Quackity could be quite harsh on Tubbo, but wanted the best for him. He urged him to use his authority to stand up to Dream. The
       Butcher Army
       and

       , Quackity gave Tubbo a pep talk, since Tubbo had been decided to be the one to execute Dream.
       Tubbo stated in return that if he were to fail, "everything would be Quackity's call" from then on,
       effectively making him the new president. However, this never happened, since Dream was never executed and the Festival instead turned into a fight at the destroyed Community House. During this fight, it was revealed by Dream that Ranboo had been disloyal to L'Manberg,
       which prompted Quackity to later suggest to Tubbo that they should execute Ranboo, as Quackity wanted to protect Tubbo from being betrayed and hurt. However, Tubbo reacted very negatively to this and immediately stood up for Ranboo, getting angry and shouting at Quackity, and comparing the idea to his own execution at the Red Festival. He stated that if Quackity tried to execute Ranboo, it would be treason.

       , despite Quackity having left L'Manberg after his disagreement with Tubbo the previous day, Quackity returned to fight for L'Manberg,
       and sang the
       L'Manberg National Anthem
       with Tommy, Tubbo and Ghostbur while surveying the destruction that had been done.

       Quackity was one of the people to come to save Tommy and Tubbo during the

       , and he acted friendly, waving to the two of them while everyone else was confronting Dream.
       Afterwards, he paid a visit to Snowchester, warning Tubbo not to trust anyone (including Quackity himself), showing that he still cared about Tubbo and wanted to see him safe.
      </p>
      <p key="251892ba-4298-45b1-b38c-e8d26fc2c774">
       Despite their disagreements, the two parted on terms of mutual respect, and Tubbo has stated that he considers them friends.

      <p key="9e9e2007-702e-40da-804e-b5825973cc0e">
       However, since Tubbo started building
       Walltown
       , his outpost near Las Nevadas, the relationship between the two became somewhat strained. Quackity griefed the outpost together with Fundy and Slimecicle, and later on, asked him to take down the walls of the outpost because he felt threatened by it,
       which Tubbo refused to do because he wanted to protect the outpost, as his builds had a history of being destroyed.
      </p>
      <p key="1564a7d3-82f5-49a1-bf75-fbb07bb4c97b">
       Quackity said to Tubbo during their discussion that he didn't have the time or energy for a conflict with him, and instead proposed that they work together.
       He also stated that he was only acting to protect his country.
       However, Tubbo refused to back down and instead ended up threatening Quackity with nuclear warfare
       and left, leaving their disagreement unresolved.
      </p>
      <p key="1d04fad6-c629-4dd6-aec7-bc090311bca1">
       Tubbo also seemed to partially blame Quackity for his execution at the Manberg Festival, despite the fact that at the time, Quackity was actively trying to prevent the execution itself from happening.
      </p>
      <p key="99fce78b-8ce2-4f55-abb1-8000955ef99f">
       Despite this, Tubbo seemed to have no qualms about being hired to work for Las Nevadas's burger place on August 4, 2021, and agreed to allow Walltown's annexation into Las Nevadas land.
       With this, Tubbo and Quackity put the conflict behind them and agreed to start on a clean slate,
       though they are both still aware of and have spoken about their shared history as part of the L'Manberg cabinet.
       Additionally, in a later conversation with Ranboo, Tubbo appeared to have shifted the blame for his death at the Manberg Festival away from Quackity, or at least accepted that his death that day had been inevitable. He also seemed to admire Quackity for what he had achieved in building Las Nevadas.
       The two are now on good terms.

      Despite being competitors during the SWAG2020 vs POG2020 Election, the two developed a fairly neutral relationship. Wilbur and Quackity got to know each other when they built
      The White House
      together, and Wilbur saw that Quackity cared for Manberg, though they didn't agree on policies. Quackity thought that Wilbur and Tommy's banishment was too harsh, revealing empathy for him, but Wilbur also blamed Quackity for getting Schlatt in power. The two had a difficult relationship in Pogtopia, frequently switching between borderline romantic and incredibly tense.
      <p key="654f0527-fe1a-42f0-b7bb-0bd75a031e7f">
       Before visiting Dream, Quackity visited Wilbur's resurrection shrine, writing a
       letter
       to him and leaving it in a chest. In that letter, he wrote that Wilbur was his "dearest friend," showing that he had come to like Wilbur even more than when he died.
      </p>
      <p key="cf9b1b6c-7191-4bba-9087-958f6d7fd40f">
       Wilbur found the note after his revival and immediately sought Quackity out, displaying a similar level of fondness and eagerness to join him. When rejected by Quackity, he immediately acted petty about it, arguing with him loudly - though, he also bounced back very quickly from this, and admitted that he had a very confusing relationship with him (that might, once again, be borderline romantic).
