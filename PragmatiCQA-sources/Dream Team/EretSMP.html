   Despite their betrayal of L'Manberg, Eret is a very kind and caring individual. They often leave pink wool in people's chests with the message "You Matter," and usually spends their time building. Their most substantial build is their
   castle
   , also known as the Pride Palace. Eret enjoys talking to many of the members of the server, as they are very amiable, and willing to speak to anyone no matter what past or previous conflicts they may have had. They even allowed

   Eret has a strong sense of justice, and feels the need to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Notably, Eret deeply regrets their betrayal, as they wanted to help Pogtopia in their efforts. Unfortunately, Eret got rejected almost every time they tried to help Pogtopia, as their betrayal always got brought up. Eret is trying to prove their loyalty, and while this is challenging, they are willing to do what they can in order to show that they truly wants to support people.

   Eret works towards the greater good and wants to bring the SMP back to its glory days and use their position as king to do so, but has been fairly directionless in their attempts ever since their original betrayal and has become increasingly indifferent towards the crown as it has caused others, such as the

   Eret's main flaw is their need to succeed. They betrayed their friends to become king when they thought Dream would win, but betrayed Dream when they saw that Pogtopia was more likely to win the war. They would go to whichever side is more likely to win, then betray them when they lose. They are reluctant to hurt their friends, but will ultimately put their own success over them in the end. This, however, has changed, as they have decided that they want to use their position as king for good and to protect the other members of the server. However, they fail to see that this is likely a futile effort, as in the end, the position of king doesn't actually give any power and is only a meaningless title.

   Foolish

   At the beginning of the war, Eret joined L'Manberg's side, building up
   the walls of L'Manberg
   and preparing the nation for war. However, Dream made a deal with Eret, where Eret would become king of Dream SMP if they betrayed L'Manberg. Eret agreed to the terms, as they believed that it would redirect the server into a state of peace, and was a win-win situation.
   Eret then lead the L'Manbergians into the
   Final Control Room
   , where they said their famous quote, "Down with the revolution, boys! It was never meant to be." After the betrayal, Wilbur and Eret had a negative relationship, but Eret realized the selfishness of their actions, and their relationship with the people they betrayed has since mended.
   To never forget that day, they placed a book titled "
   I'm Sorry
   " in Wilbur's chest in their recreation of the Final Control Room for the museum.

   After the war, Eret used their authority as king to build giant
   watch towers
   on the edge of L'Manberg's borders, which overlooked the area and kept the nation in check. The prank war with Fundy was still going on, and Fundy pranked the towers. Eret responded by rebuilding them with obsidian pillars. Later, Fundy covered the windows of the towers with rainbows, and Eret was pleased, so they commissioned

   As king of Dream SMP, Eret was instructed by Dream to maintain a neutral position and to distance themself from political turmoil. Eret ignored these instructions in favor of his developing morals, and warned Schlatt about destroying history and offered support to Pogtopia. However, Tommy and Wilbur rejected the help, as they still didn't trust them after their betrayal. Niki was imprisoned for openly supporting Pogtopia, and they secretly helped her escape. Then, Eret publicly supported her afterwards, despite being a known enemy of Manberg. Fundy trusted Eret and told them about his plot to take Manberg down from the inside. Near the Manberg Festival, Eret and Niki worked together on a plot to blow up the Second White House.

   Eret did not attend the festival, but soon became aware of support swaying to Pogtopia. Encouraged by this shift, Eret became more open about their support of Pogtopia. However, the only member willing to speak to them was Niki, who had joined in the wake of the festival. Eret found Dream's old crossbow, and gifted it to Tommy in order to gain trust.

   In the war, Dream contacted Eret, stating that Eret was simply a figurehead and therefore shouldn't take a stance. Dream warned that Eret was only king because Dream said so. Eret came to the decision that it was better to help their friends reclaim L'Manberg than act as a figurehead. In response, Dream dethroned Eret and placed George in power, removing Eret from the throne.

   Having lost their throne for the cause, Eret fled to Pogtopia, where they rallied with the other rebels and told them the news. Eret was awestruck when Techno revealed his impressive cache of weapons and supplies, taking a spare set of netherite armor with them. Eret was a soldier within the war, and fought alongside their comrades. After the war was won, they listened to
   Tubbo
   's presidential speech. They survived the massive TNT explosion under Manberg, as well as Technoblade's withers. Dream later clarified that Eret still was allowed to live in their castle, but as a subject and not a ruler; Eret chose to stay, rather than find a new home.

However, he could not be officially adopted until there was official consent from Philza, who was Fundy's nearest and alive relative. While Philza had actually considered approving the adoption, Eret did not show up on the day of the adoption, disappointing Fundy and thus leading to Philza's withhold of his signature. It was later revealed by Eret OOC that Fundy had not told them in advance regarding the adoption, and when they were notified, they were celebrating Thanksgiving and were unable to be on the server. However, they also clarified that the adoption was not off, and that they are only waiting for an appropriate time when the three of them can officiate the adoption altogether.

   Eret, feeling insulted, went back to Dream SMP to find a totem on their own and reflected on their own views on government. They deeply regretted betraying their friends in the original war, and felt bad that they had earned their crown through betrayal. At the same time, they believe that their position as king lets them make things better, and they said that they try very hard not to order people around. Wilbur inspired Eret's own reign through his strong leadership, and Eret always felt as though Wilbur could spark hope in a way that they never could. That was why they worked so hard to bring him back, built a historical museum, and tried their best to help their people. Ranboo and Phil called back, and they went off to find a totem together.

After these discussions, Eret returned to the historical museum project, memorializing events that they missed and expanding the world map to include
   Snowchester

Eret theorized that the Egg's rapid growth could have been boosted by their attempt at resurrecting Wilbur, as the blood vines started to appear in force shortly after the event. The two of them shared information, and spent some time clearing out the vines around Eret's fortress and neighboring areas. Afterwards, Foolish mentions that their work cleaning the server reminded him of the time they spent together "cleaning up that mess from the wither cult." Eret remembers no such thing. Foolish, confused, asks about the time they climbed a mountain fighting trolls together. To make sure that Foolish isn't mistaking Eret for someone else, Eret removes their sunglasses, revealing their blank, pupil-less eyes. Foolish says that Eret is the correct person, and they walk away from each other, confused.

The two of them received invitations to the Red Banquet, and agreed to go; Foolish gifted them a Rolex to wear to the event. Eret still had no memory of the events Foolish remembered, and resolved to ask Foolish about their past after the Banquet ended.

   The Banquet, however, was not the celebration they had hoped it would be. Badboyhalo trapped the participants in, and asked for people to come forth and receive their death in service to the Egg. Eret was the first to step forth, calling the Eggpire monsters for violating the attendees' trust. Ponk argued that Eret was the last person to speak of trust, but Eret owned up to their own betrayal, and had learned much since then.
   Hannah
   brought Eret over to the Execution block, where
   Antfrost
   prepared to sacrifice them. Foolish, however, challenged the captors, trying to summon his lightning to smite the Egg. However, Foolish's powers were suppressed by his proximity to the Egg. The members of the Eggpire mocked Foolish, and decided to sacrifice him first, returning Eret to the captive crowd. Eret watched as another friend was cut down.

      Eret had gained a somewhat negative relationship with Quackity after he got Schlatt into power. On Election Night, Quackity and Eret were to be married. However, this failed, as Quackity believed Eret to be a ghost and killed them, causing Eret to call him a bastard. The two occasionally talk, revealing that they still have some sort of relationship. After the conflict with El Rapids, the two seem to have an even more tense relationship, despite the agreement with the country.

      Tommy was initially fond of Eret, as he was keen on being their friend when they first joined the server. However, after Eret's devastating betrayal during the
      Dream Team SMP vs. L'Manberg War
      , Tommy's tone changed drastically. It appeared that Tommy had a great vendetta for Eret, consistently speaking poorly of them whenever he got the chance. Eret attempted to assist Tommy in his Pogtopian endeavors, but they were immediately shut down every time. Eventually, Tommy accepted Eret's willingness to help and fought alongside them during the
      Manberg vs Pogtopia War
      . However, after being exiled by Tubbo, Tommy still refuses help from Eret and admits that it's because he still holds a grudge for Eret's initial betrayal. However, it seems like Tommy has forgiven Eret, calling them the True King during the final battle of the Dream SMP. Eret showed up to help Tommy and Tubbo during the

       Wilbur was also a role model for Eret regarding his ability to rally a group of people to a common cause and give them a sense of hope. This, along with the fact that they wanted Wilbur to forgive them for what they did, is the reason why Eret wanted to help with Wilbur's resurrection.
