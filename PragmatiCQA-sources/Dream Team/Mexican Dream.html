   Mexican Dream had a similar appearance to
   Dream
   except all of the white is replaced with the colors of the Mexican flag. Another feature that separated him from Dream was his goatee. His species is unknown, although it is possible that he is part of the same species as Dream.
  </p>
  <p key="3db3d9d5-35d0-47ef-985d-907229f1d19b">
   After canonically dying, Mexican Dream turned grayer, like
   Ghostbur
   , with tears flowing from his eyes on his chest. His arms also gained a white stripe each due to the erroneous switch to the Steve model while still wearing a skin meant for Alex. This was fixed in a later appearance.

   He is also frequently called "Big Q"
   or "Quackity"
   by accident, possibly due to a vague similarity in appearance.

  <p key="239a2f0c-aa5c-4faa-a9fc-33cd55d1c60f">
   Mexican Dream had possibly the most distinguishable personality on the server. He lead El Rapids like a gang and was not afraid to get into a fight. He was very prideful of his culture, willing to blackmail and shame people, ruining them over Twitter if he heard anything that could be an insult to his Mexican heritage. He likes to talk about his friends, especially Juan Mendez.

   Mexican Dream seemed to be addicted to cocaine and used drugs as a coping mechanism when Juan Mendez 'left' him. He was also very appreciative of high value items and substances such as Yeezys. Mexican Dream also took up speed running as a hobby, listening to

   Mexican Dream seemingly had a backstory unique from others. Presumably raised in Tijuana, Mexico, he seemed to have lost most of his family at a young age, and grew up "on the streets" with "the boys". Juan Mendez was a big influence in his life, teaching him how to read and count and also being his drug-dealer. When offered a tent, he refused, stating he'd spent his whole life in tents. He said the only flooring he knew was "the concrete of the streets".

   Mexican Dream mostly spoke in an American accent instead of his usual Mexican accent, perhaps to make it easier for Sam to understand him. Sam initially mistook him for Quackity, but realized his mistake when they were face-to-face. Sam gave Mexican Dream some cocoa beans, saying that he knew that Mexican Dream liked them, implying that Sam had met Mexican Dream before. Mexican Dream then acted as Quackity and gave Sam a tour of Manberg.

   Mexican Dream insinuated that Tubbo was racist against Mexicans, and shortly after, Sam and Mexican Dream murdered Tubbo, stole his stuff and ran. Mexican Dream apologized to Tubbo shortly after and promised to return his items. They put the items in a secret chest for him near the

Mexican Dream and his goons then made a break for it, in a familiar manhunt format, ultimately surviving.

   On December 13, 2020, Mexican Dream was trying to get to Tijuana from the Nether when he stumbled across Tommy and Dream during
   Tommy's exile
   (although this may have just been an excuse to visit Tommy).
   Tommy toured him around
   Logstedshire
   and he expressed confusion as to why Tommy was so far away from everyone else. He then tried to mug Tommy and teach Tommy how to mug at the same time. Tommy decided to build a home for Mexican Dream in Logstedshire, so he could live with Tommy as a roommate. Dream attempted to mug Mexican Dream but ran away from Logstedshire after Mexican Dream started playing Mexican music.

  <p key="ffb41dab-c201-48bb-b2e9-faee8baf7683">
   Mamacita
   then arrived. Mexican Dream and Mamacita began dancing to Mexican music while Tommy wondered if he was hallucinating. Mexican Dream revealed his relationship with Mamacita to Tommy and Mamacita said Mexican Dream was her "one and only" partner. The three built
   a house
   for Mexican Dream, talking and joking around with each other. Mexican Dream set up a picture of his 'homies'. He said that Juan Mendez taught him how to count and read while Mamacita "taught me how to love". Later, Mexican Dream and Mamacita comforted Tommy while he cried at pictures of Tubbo and remembered the time before his exile. Mexican Dream placed a large picture of Bugs Bunny with the caption, "FUCK I'M HIGH," and began to cough blood. Tommy ran away, while MD did drugs, and came back to overhear an argument between Mamacita and Mexican Dream. To repair their relationship, Mamacita and Mexican Dream shared quality time with a crafting table. Later, Mexican Dream saved Mamacita and Tommy from a mob 'drive-by', buying them enough time to escape before he lost his first canon life to a zombie. Unfortunately, Mamacita had to leave just when Mexican Dream returned to Logstedshire.

  <p key="99797e4c-e950-4d30-93b0-86e1ccb6077a">
   Dream returned afterwards. He was rude and careless to Mexican Dream, forming a rift between them. Dream took down the picture of Juan Mendez and then, shot an arrow at the image of José Mendez
   . Mexican Dream jumped in front of the bullet, dying to save José's life and losing one of his own canon lives. Nonetheless, Dream took down the images of Mexican Dream's homies and hung up a picture of one of their heads. Mexican Dream returned back to the scene and grieved for his friends, making
   a gravestone
   for them. He then retrieved a full set of enchanted netherite armor and an enchanted diamond sword from an ender chest. He proceeded to chase a running Dream ready to kill him, but due to the weakness of his weapons and armor, Mexican Dream lost his last canon life to Dream fairly quickly after the duel commenced. Tommy, distraught by Mexican Dream's death, created a monument to honor his death in Logstedshire. Dream held a memorial in which he paid his respects and admitted that Mexican Dream was better than him. Tommy then gave a final speech, talking about how Mexican Dream was his last true friend.

Once he recognized them, they started celebrating their reunion. Mexican Dream told Sapnap about how Dream had taken his last canon life.

Mexican Dream seemed to remember that he was the president of Mexican L'Manberg and said he was worried about meeting him. Sapnap and George then decided to attempt to revive him with a totem if he revealed why he was crying.

Sapnap realized he didn't actually know if Dream had taken down Mexican L'Manberg, which made Mexican Dream angry at him.

He now knew the Quackity dream was true, since his latest dream was accurate, and Quackity had actually destroyed Mexican L'Manberg. He then said that he had another vision about Quackity, money, gambling and Las Vegas. He 'smelled the machines' and walked in the direction of

He later tried to recruit Dream into Mexican L'Manberg, made fun of him, and jokingly called him a racist. But, he seemed to get jealous when Mamacita said that she loved Dream.

    Mexican Dream met Mamacita while recruiting for Mexican L'Manberg. One of the first things they did together was drugs.

      This is most likely a joke about the Mexico border wall that former American president Trump claimed he was going to build.

   <li key="2aaaac76-be0e-4a6a-9983-11b35e456681">
    Mexican Dream had a problem with coughing out blood during the time he visited Logstedshire, but he seems to not have this problem anymore as a ghost.

   <li key="4261fa8a-fc03-4f8a-be6c-d4fe0e0b587d">
    Quackity somehow knew that Dream had taken Mexican Dream's last canon life.
   </li>
   <li key="19eacb0d-1d4b-4add-abfc-8e9e7c7b1aed">
    Mexican Dream and Quackity somehow simultaneously forgot about each other post-El Rapids.

     <li key="445a3d21-d7d0-45b4-a844-2e8053aae701">
      Sapnap also somehow forgot that Mexican Dream was canonically dead, despite Quackity telling him about it earlier.

   <li key="38829866-c511-4d49-af9a-722c602963a9">
    When Mexican Dream first inquired about Mamacita's love life, she said that she loved Dream, meaning that Mamacita and Dream may have been in a relationship at that point.
    However, she seems to have broken up with Dream, currently being in a relationship with Mexican Dream.
   </li>
   <li key="77ebb34e-4371-4d6d-9d14-71cda8569072">
    Mexican Dream has the ability to play Mexican music whenever he thinks about it
    , similar to how Dream
    and Mamacita
    can play speedrun music by thinking. This may be a trait of Dream's species. He also has better control of this ability, playing music with almost no breaks or interruptions in the audio, unlike Mamacita's or Dream's  music.

   <li key="ee63f97f-bb9a-438e-95ad-db267fa1206a">
    Mexican Dream also has a good American accent.

    Mexican Dream is the only person to lose a canon life to a mob.
   </li>
   <li key="d73cd210-caa1-47e0-9d2d-6a55f69b93ae">
    Mexican Dream is the fastest person to lose all three canon lives, doing so in 10 minutes and 56 seconds. The previous record-holder was
    Schlatt
    who did the same in one month.
   </li>
   <li key="eb699920-833c-4ca0-a676-6a94cfe9bd89">
    Mexican Dream was the first person Tommy thought of resurrecting after learning of the revival book.
   </li>
   <li key="5ed04fa0-555c-4c6f-bf1a-55fd50ac2cc7">
    Mexican Dream may have appeared in
    Ghostbur
    's vision alongside
    Schlatt
    after the
    first failed resurrection attempt of Wilbur
    . However, this may not be the case, as it has been confirmed that Ghostbur and
    Wilbur
    are both different individuals.

    Since his SMP debut, Mexican Dream has made appearances outside the SMP as well, featuring in a TommyInnit mod video
    and one of George's streams
    .
