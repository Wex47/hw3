   Fundy is depicted as an anthropomorphic fox. He has orange fur with a white muzzle and white ears. He typically wears a white shirt with grey lines and a black jacket with black pants. He also wears a hat that matches the one worn by Jotaro Kujo from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, black with golden decals.

   It has been stated countless times that his mother is a salmon, and his paternal grandmother is a refrigerator, although the canonicity of these statements is questioned by the community. It is unknown what species his paternal grandfather is. Wilbur has claimed that Fundy is a furry, but Fundy does not like being referred to by this title, so he is likely a fox - although it is unknown why he was born a fox. Like his father, Fundy did not inherit wings or the single canon life from his grandfather, however it is unknown if Fundy can live for centuries like Philza can.
  </p>
  <p key="6abe76de-ddd8-483f-997d-b9dc698bc89f">
   His age also remains dubious due to conflicting reports. Wilbur said that Fundy is around 14 canonically,
   however we don't know if this is his real age due to Wilbur's memory being affected. Fundy has given conflicting evidence himself, stating that his character was “around 20,” although immature for his age.

    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="9729f322-e563-4f9a-a646-7086d0cb7ce9">
   Fundy is very creative and loves to set up structures and come up with elaborate schemes. He looks after his belongings and is loyal to a fault, as shown during the events of
   <a href="The Pet War.html" key="0ec2ebf5-8283-4ec7-bceb-1ca64ea1a78a" title="The Pet War">
    the Pet War
   </a>
   . He usually refuses to forgive people for the wrongs that they have committed, preferring to get back at them in various ways. As an additive of this creativeness, he is very mischievous and enjoys playing pranks on others. His pranks are usually “very over the top,” but ultimately harmless, as are most of his schemes. He can also be a little stubborn at times and gives in easily to frustration.
  </p>
  <p key="4f40dadf-3e0c-4c66-8b8a-931f32fb5d41">
   Although Fundy was likened to a child, he is very capable and can manipulate situations to his own advantage, as shown by his sly behavior in the "bee game" with
   Punz
   and how he covered his position as a spy during his time as a high-ranking official in Manberg. He has a certain charm that is summed up in the following: he is a good liar who can come up with falsehoods easily and trick others on the spot, though not everyone falls for his trickery and scams.
  </p>
  <p key="b56db337-cc55-4cd9-b904-19be65eaa8cd">
   Throughout his life, Fundy was treated as a child by Wilbur, even as he grew older and tried to take on greater responsibility in life. From the L'Manberg Revolution onward, he watched his own father focus his attention on Tommy and Tubbo; this treatment, on top of his tough relationship with a father who still treats him as a child, forced the two further apart. Ignored, he grew increasingly eager for approval, and wanted to be seen as his own person. Although he is able to act as himself and have accomplishments and has a lot of friends, he still seeks the validation of an authority as a replacement for the lack of it from his own father.
  </p>
  <p key="b517356f-aca1-4f0a-8ea2-90da206ff9f7">
   This key motive becomes the driving factor in his later decisions; although he originally intended to act as a spy against Manberg, he went to extreme lengths to earn the approval of Schlatt. His confidence in his beliefs wavered as Schlatt fed him the approval that he sought from Wilbur. Schlatt essentially became the "father figure" that he lacked by giving him credit and acceptance for what he did. As a result, he ceased to write in
   his diary
   for a while. However, deep down it seems that he didn't want Schlatt to fill that position, as after witnessing him kill a cat, he immediately returned to his original plan.
  </p>
  <p key="982f9da4-ddae-4b3f-87fa-e33273c8b649">
   His desire for acceptance was also eventually severely destructive for his mental state. After a series of rejections and the realization that his actions meant nothing to anyone, Fundy snapped, turning to a villainous path because he thought there was no other way to get others' attention. While he was able to distance himself and heal, he still retains the emotional damage of many abandonments, which worsened his original insecurities, leading to the insecurities and mental state of present-day Fundy.
  </p>
  <p key="70db8704-89d1-48fb-9adb-f6a43a339e5e">
   At his core, he is deeply insecure, alone, and fearful of abandonment, making it very easy to exploit his insecurities for personal gain. As depicted by his dream's landscape, he feels that after so much desertion there is no one there for him and there is no one he can truly trust. At the same time, however, he still searches for approval, making him very easily manipulated, as all people have to do is feed him the compliments he seeks and he will latch onto them, hoping for more approval.
  </p>
  <p key="b0f01681-adcf-42ae-993a-bd729bbcd8d4">
   Although Fundy and his father were not on the best of terms towards the end, Wilbur's death, alongside the status of his mother, are very sensitive subjects for him, as is his status as an orphan. He states that he dislikes his father for his unavailability and infantilization during the revolution and his subsequent disappearance from his life through his death, and claims not to want to bring his father back to life, seeing how he was at the time of his death. However, later glimpses at his inner mind hint at a desperate longing for the kinder, more available version of his father from his childhood, something that has long been locked away from him.

   Fundy does not easily maintain healthy relationships due to others' constant rejection of him, and has difficulty being trustful of others. In the past, friends failed to support him if he switched sides or had conflicting views on a situation, instead electing to feel betrayed and leave him, which led to his vicious and self-destructive cycle of getting attached to someone and winning approval from them, then them leaving. Nevertheless, he fished for their approval, reflecting his childhood desire for acceptance, despite knowing deep down that they would leave and that he was being used.
  </p>
  <p key="b86637e6-aec2-4e63-af08-0435262b40c1">
   Fundy is also very much in denial of his own trauma and emotional pain, and prefers to keep everything to himself. While he is subconsciously aware of his abandonment issues and internal turmoil, and even pulled himself out of a dangerous spiral, he is not much better off after it. He prefers to put up a cheerful front and pretend that he is happy with his circumstances, but when under stress, his true feelings are easily uncovered--he feels alone and terrified, desperately wishing for people to love him, and yet he knows that no one truly will. He also does not trust anyone with his feelings, believing that others will simply treat it as a joke and make fun of him about it, which locks his feelings further within himself.
  </p>
  <p key="e4fa4c60-dd43-479d-bdf5-e0fb53e88de4">
   Fundy is very playful and often presents himself as a trickster. It can lead to many people liking him, but it will also lead to unforeseen consequences when not kept in check. He often starts prank wars and pranks people on the server for fun, which can develop bonds with others. However, his pranking behaviors have become increasingly destructive; it is difficult for him to understand the line between a funny prank and an outright damaging action. This is in part because he has always messed around and been the butt of jokes on the server, and also because people tend to not take him seriously. It also leads him to believe that many things, even things that are outright terrifying such as his dream, are because people are "toying with him."

   Shortly after Sapnap killed Fungi, Sapnap apologized, nearly ending the conflict. However, Fundy escalated it by forcing Niki to kill Sapnap's favorite fox,
   Sketchers
   . Sapnap killed Fundy's enderman as a response, and Fundy responded by taking his anger out on Punz, an ally of Sapnap, in a bee game. Fundy's bee game forced Punz to play a game of chance that killed his bee, Beenus. After the bee game, he lost his pants "drip but brown" and developed a negative relationship with Punz, painting him as a villain. Fundy declared the conflict as a war shortly after.

   Fundy took the offensive against Sapnap when he used a screenshot from George's stream to track down Sapnap's pets then take them hostage. Fundy attempted to gain leverage by claiming he killed some pets, but it only angered Sapnap, leading him to kill Niki's chickens and steal her fish. In addition, Fundy also angered Punz by asking him about what happened to Beenus, leading to Sapnap blowing up Fungi's grave.

   After Schlatt won presidency, Fundy immediately followed his orders, helping tear down the walls of L'Manberg. He secretly approached Eret, asking for their opinion on the matter before revealing his plan to act as Schlatt's right-hand man to take the country down from the inside. Eret approved, but when Niki approached, he acted as a supporter of Schlatt, destroying most of the L'Manberg flag before being killed by Eret. To document his role as a spy, Fundy wrote
   A Spy's Diary

   To build trust with Schlatt, Fundy redesigned the flag, changing the blue to purple and removing two of the X's. While building the flag, he was targeted by Pogtopians, leading him to discuss the matter with Schlatt. Schlatt loved the flag and promoted Fundy to Viceroy Chairman of Manberg. Fundy later rebuilt the flag out of obsidian and magma blocks after his original one was burnt down by Tommy, leading Schlatt to once again promote Fundy, this time to Archbishop of Manberg.

After Phil continued to refuse to disclose the location, he joined the other members in ransacking and trashing his house, smashing the flowers outside. While leaving, he quickly threw an "I still love you grandpa!." which Phil did not take well.

   Technoblade along with Tommy were on their mission to retrieve all of his items back. These included the Orphan Obliterator and the Axe of Peace.  They met up with Ranboo and Fundy in L'Manberg. Techno threatened to spawn a wither. He gave them a choice, either give him his items back and he helps to kill the wither and spare their lives or get killed by the wither as well as Techno and Tommy. Ranboo gives him his stuff but Fundy keeps the nether star with him. This infuriates them both and they corner him in a house and order him to give the star as Techno wanted to craft a beacon. After a lot of shouting Fundy ends up giving the nether star but starts crying. Vikkstar breaks the block under Fundy causing him to fall into the lake below. Fundy keeps crying and makes no effort to surface out. He eventually dies by drowning. This gave the lake the name Lake of Tears.

   , Fundy made a plan to permanently destroy L'Manberg as he was fed up from fighting over the same land again &amp; again. He sabotaged all the important supplies of L'Manberg and asked Niki for assistance, which she agreed. They didn't actually side up with Technoblade but also didn't support the L'Manbergians. Fundy &amp; Niki looked at the destruction of their country and caused some minor chaos. Niki burned down the L'Mantree, and although Fundy wasn't there, he approved of it. They were then assumed to enter a villainous role.

He then started forming a plan with Puffy to connect all the plotlines and hopefully find the cause of everything that was going on. He then talked to Tommy who asked what the Egg was which Fundy responded "red cum." Tommy accidentally let this spill to BadBoyHalo who responded with "Fundy will be taken care of."

After hearing more and more of the Egg, he attributed it to Dreamons, explaining to Puffy what a Dreamon is and what the Dreamon Hunters do, seemingly intrigued and passionate, saying "So would you say it's... unexplained?" The continuation of the Dreamon Hunters plot is not concrete, but is being hinted at through these statements and a few others by Tubbo.

   The next day, Fundy, Philza and Ranboo met up in the SMP and attempted to use TNT to clear out some of the Egg vines. Fundy seems to dislike the Egg, especially after seeing Antfrost's infected eyes. Antfrost, after seeing Fundy blow up some of the Egg vines, made him follow Fundy. They went to the Eggpire meeting room where Antfrost trapped Fundy in the Egg briefly. However, Philiza and Ranboo used a water bucket to rescue Fundy from the Egg.

   Fundy had come up with a social experiment he wished to make. It was a simple button in the Community House. Pressing the button would give a 50/50 chance of blowing up the Community House, or would dispense diamonds, as Fundy wanted to see if people were greedy enough to fall for it and press the button. He visited his mob farm, showing the chests full of gunpowder he had, but he still needed sand to create TNT. At first, he attempted to trick HBomb into thinking the TNT would be used for a 'giant firework' but once that proved useless Fundy called for HBomb to be his maid. Once the two gathered up enough sand, HBomb left and Fundy finished his social experiment. CaptainPuffy would go to press the button for a sub goal, blowing up the Community House once again.

   Fundy headed to his base and asked Niki and Ranboo, who were also on the server at the time, to sleep. Fundy started dreaming. In the dream, he woke up in his bunker, and walked outside. The outside of his bunker seemed to be in a desert, and Fundy quickly found a replica of the drug van from L'Manberg. In disbelief, he started muttering that it was not real, and walked towards the drug van. He found two nametags: his IGN and Wilbur's IGN. He started repeating that the van was fake, and tried to enter it. He, however, had no success. In the distance, he found another building - one leading to a room in the ground. Fundy went into the room, and eventually found a book. In this book, it said that he had wrote it. It kept on telling him that everything around him was not real, and that he wasn't real. Fundy continued to through the pages, and they all told him to "wake up." as a heartbeat noise grew louder.

   Eventually, Fundy woke up again in the same dream, and walked outside. He went to the drug van once again, but this time, he only found his nametag. Fundy kept repeating that it wasn't real and that he was being pranked once again, and decided to visit the other building from before. However, this time, the cave had a skull in it, and the book was different. The book read that Fundy did not need to know the truth about himself, and repeated that he had to "wake up" once again. As a heartbeat noise grew faster, Fundy woke up in the dream again. Fundy, being incredibly scared and questioning reality, opened the door to get out of his bunker again, trying to convince himself it was all a prank being played on him. He found the drug van no longer there (blown up), and the other building being closer to his base. Fundy went inside of the other building once again, and found a different book than the last two times. This time, the book asked him several questions, told him he will be hurt by "it." told him to enjoy life and kept on telling him to "wake up" once again. As the heartbeat noise grew louder than ever, a new book dropped down. This book told him that he needed to be safe, and that he suffered from insomnia.

   Fundy woke up in his dream for the last time, crying as he questioned everything. Fundy, wanting the dream to be over, opened the door. He found a dark and weird figure, who chased Fundy as he ran screaming to get to the top of his base. Fundy eventually got to the top where a black bed that was not seen there before was laying, but the figure seemingly followed him as he tried to force himself to sleep. The screen then faded to black as Fundy screamed, and Quackity's face seemingly appeared with casino sounds.

   Not long after Wilbur Soot was revived from the dead, Philza came to break the news to him, this deeply saddened and angered Fundy, who said that Wilbur should stay dead. Fundy opened up to Philza about all of the nightmares he has been having, and that he can't sleep. Philza offhandedly mentioned that Wilbur had won the elections, but Fundy corrected him, causing Phil to find out that Wilbur had been lying to him in his letters. Fundy would say goodbyes to Philza, and Fundy would destroy his old base and moved to a small cottage in the woods.

   ⁷On May 22, 2021, Fundy had a nightmare that saw him meeting Quackity outside his cottage in a mesa biome, with Fundy very confused about how he was there.
   Fundy went through the biome, containing various historic structures of L'Manberg. Quackity brought Fundy to a crumbling Eret's tower and told Fundy that he and his memories didn't matter, and that nothing would ever matter, as it would be at one point forgotten by time. Quackity told him that he needed to change, that it doesn't have to be this way, as he had big plans, and said he was inviting Fundy to the new nation. He also told Fundy he would die if he didn't join him, counting to ten before Fundy woke up. He found himself back in the woods, and Quackity came up to his door.

Wilbur cared about Fundy to the point where he said he built walls to save him, while Fundy was always a bit hesitant about Wilbur. Fundy started to dislike his father right before he rose to power, and eventually started following Schlatt, Wilbur's biggest enemy. However, he ended up disliking Schlatt and appearing at Wilbur's original revival attempt, showing that he likely missed Wilbur.

      Fundy has shown frustration over the government of L'Manberg. During the Manberg-Pogtopia era, Fundy burns the L'Manberg flag. Although it is most likely to get on Schlatt's good side, it is implied that the burning of the flag also expresses Fundy's mistrust of L'Manberg and his frustration on the conduct of his father, Tommy, and later President Tubbo. Fundy expresses that he misses L'Manberg very much deep inside, even though he is shown to have neutral feelings about it. In a dream, Quackity shows Fundy snippets of L'Manberg and Fundy expresses joy and fondness, reminiscing about his times in L'Manberg.
