   initially constructed the beginnings of the Courthouse as a gladiator arena, but he decided to make it further away and made the current one into a courthouse along with George and Dream.

   During the Courthouse's construction, George intentionally killed Callahan by flicking all the levers while Callahan was standing on the glass, causing Callahan to fall in lava and die, losing 32 levels.
   He later killed Callahan again in the lava. Sapnap wanted to use the Courthouse and decided to hold a trial for George's murder of Callahan. George agreed to the trial 'for the good of the server' after putting away his items, saying he would win. He asked if the chat could be judges, but he was denied.

   Dream

   Ponk
   acted as the judges. Dream and Sapnap asked him for his defense. He said that it was an accident and he was just testing the levers and Callahan happened to be there. They then asked Callahan for proof that he actually had 32 levels and they later found out that Callahan said that he had 32 levels before the crime occurred. Dream, Sapnap and Callahan voted 'guilty', flicking 3 of the 4 levers. Ponk, however, voted 'not guilty', leaving the last lever and saving George. Sapnap flicked the lever anyway, throwing George into lava and killing him.

The rest of the players, not knowing the context of the situation, saw that Sapnap killed George twice as well as his own horse and decided to hold a trial against Sapnap.

   Bad took the leading role, starting the court proceedings and talking to Sapnap about the law. Sapnap argued that George stole Joffrey first, and that him murdering the horse was an unfortunate accident caused by George's actions. George rebutted by stating that it was not his fault that Sapnap was reckless when trying to retrieve the horse. He also said that the horse probably wasn't Sapnap's.

   Sapnap, Dream, Callahan and Bad were the judges for this case. George said that sitting on a horse was not illegal and his chat was voting 'innocent'. Sapnap kept on punching George leading to Bad shooting Sapnap and killing him twice. Dream said that if Sapnap misbehaved again, he would be banned for the night. George accused Sapnap of abandoning his horse in a lake and making the fish in the lake get ill and throw up. Bad brought up Spirit, Dream's horse that died because of Sapnap. Sapnap said it was a freak accident, but Bad said it might have been freak neglect.

   Dream said that everyone had died and justice had been served. Bad suggested putting Dream on trial, because he flipped all the levers without asking anyone, which counted as a perversion of justice, but Dream said that there was video evidence and there was no point. Bad also suggested leaving a lever for the chat to decide. Dream protested, but Bad said that if Callahan was killed for flipping one lever, Dream should definitely be put on trial for flipping all four. Dream said that if they were talking about perversion of justice, Sapnap was a pervert, which made Bad point a crossbow at Dream and force him to go to the Courthouse.

   They decided to set up a poll and leave one lever for the stream. Sapnap, Bad and Callahan agreed to vote Dream 'guilty' and Sapnap flipped three levers, leaving the last one. They asked Dream to make his case. Dream pleaded innocent. Bad said his crime was perversion of justice by flipping all the levers regardless if anyone wanted to vote guilty or not. Dream said he wasn't a pervert and the court would have voted the same anyway. He then said that Sapnap had flipped all three levers, but Bad said that Sapnap had done it with the knowledge of the judges. Bad added that Dream had no credibility when he took the justice system in his own hands. Dream said that if he hadn't done that, Sapnap would have just voted 'not guilty' to save Callahan despite the fact that he was clearly guilty. He then said that he would put Sapnap on trial after this for perversion of justice.

He said that Sapnap had voted 'not guilty' for Callahan despite there being video evidence of Callahan's crime. Sapnap said that he hadn't seen the evidence, so he didn't want to vote on a man's death without knowing about the situation. Dream replied that Sapnap was just being lazy and not looking at the evidence. Sapnap accused Bad loudly of not having looked at the evidence himself.

   During one of his streams,
   Purpled
   was given a 1000 bit donation asking him to kill Tommy. Despite the fact that Purpled tried to avoid conflict as much as possible, he agreed to do the hit, as it was a substantial donation.
  </p>
  <p key="c485afec-d322-4446-a7b5-b754f91339e9">
   While Tommy was playing one of his music discs for him, Purpled decided that it would be the perfect time to kill him. Unfortunately, Purpled's hotkeys were not set up correctly, so he was unable to use his shield, causing him to fall off a cliff and get killed.
  </p>
  <p key="6c50fa14-1d06-4ce8-bac3-038269047176">
   Tommy quickly stole his diamond armor and asked for 25 diamonds in compensation from Purpled. Purpled disagreed with this, and attempted to ask for a cheaper cost. After noticing the situation,
   Tubbo
   and
   Fundy
   arrived asking what had happened. The two explained their quarrel and proceeded to negotiate. Tubbo and Fundy told Tommy that he should just give the armor back, as it would be good etiquette. Tommy became annoyed at the two, and decided to join a private call with Purpled.
  </p>
  <p key="7d8efeaa-f7cc-47b9-9c69-c22637b1b019">
   Purpled sneakily stole Tommy's jukebox and decided to offer Tommy a "new" jukebox and 5 diamonds in return for the armor. Tommy declined the offer and left the call. Strangely enough, right as Tommy left, an enderman appeared. This intimidated Tommy, so he decided to accept Purpled's offer, and once Purpled began giving Tommy his items, he swiftly ran away without paying Tommy the diamonds.
  </p>
  <p key="2ec1d8a4-4839-417f-8994-c1b5df0950ff">
   After that, Purpled headed to his UFO base. While there, he met with Tubbo and Fundy, and not long later, Tommy went to Purpled's base and demanded that he pay the diamonds. Fundy offered a diamond, but Tommy declined, stating that Fundy was only trying to give him a diamond out of generosity. Fundy asked Purpled if he agreed to the deal, and Purpled replied by saying that he wasn't sure. Tubbo exclaimed that it would be a perfect time to have a "court moment," to which Fundy agreed with this notion.
  </p>
  <p key="d602838e-f79f-459b-b4c2-0caaaa26403e">
   The group agreed to have a trial discussing who was at fault in the situation. Tubbo and Tommy got their suits on while Purpled quickly got a pickaxe and some steak out of his chest in case anything were to go south.

   At the courthouse, Tubbo decided that he would play the role of the judge while Fundy would be the executioner.
   Purpled would be the defendant and Tommy was the plaintiff, as he accused Purpled of committing the crime. Tubbo and Tommy took a seat at the desk and Fundy stood next to the levers. Purpled was forced to go into a cell with a glass floor that had lava under it. As everyone got settled in, Tubbo brought order to the court and asked to hear Tommy's case first.

  <p key="240ad0c2-a386-4db4-a8bf-8a25e3e965df">

   Once Tommy finished explaining his story, he demanded compensation and a formal apology from Purpled for not only trying to kill him, but for trampling his crops as well. Tubbo then allowed Purpled to explain his side. Purpled started to explain how he had no intention to kill Tommy or anyone for that matter, and only did the hit because he was given a substantial donation. He continued on by begrudgingly talking about how he failed to kill Tommy and lost all of his things.

After a long manhunt for the group, they managed to get back to Mexican L'Manberg, where Dream could not follow them again.

   This case was a result of the griefing of George's house.
   Dream said that this crime had particular importance due to Tommy's and George's high positions on the SMP and wanted Tommy to suffer severe consequences. The defendant in the case was Tommy. He protested his innocence until they reached the courthouse and put him in a cell. Tubbo would be the judge and
   Quackity
   would be representing Tommy as his lawyer. Tommy asked for Tubbo to be his lawyer, but was denied. Fundy was allowed to be the one who flicked the levers.

   Tommy started arguing continuously, frustrating Quackity and Tubbo. Finally, Tubbo allowed Fundy to flick one lever, shutting up Tommy. George made his case, saying that his chat had alerted him that Tommy had burnt down his house, even though the chat is supposed to be non-canon. But he also revealed that the chat said that
   Ranboo
   participated in the griefing as well. Tubbo ordered Ranboo to enter the other cell. Tommy protested heavily at this, saying that Ranboo was only put in custody because of George's word. Tommy said there were three witnesses-
   Niki
   ,
   Puffy
   and Ranboo. But when he pressured Niki, she remained silent. Tubbo warned that Tommy was coercing Niki to speak on his behalf and said that he would have his time to speak. Ranboo was then asked to speak. Ranboo began by saying that he had extremely bad short-term memory and that he couldn't remember. Since both witnesses didn't speak for him, Tubbo flicked the second lever. He then asked Tommy to present his case and to make no commotion or start yelling.

   Tommy immediately confessed, saying that it was a perfect crime and that no one saw him. He said that he didn't think George would notice and started laughing at him. Tubbo then flicked the third lever, leaving Tommy one lever away from dying to lava. Tubbo said that he had been advised to banish Tommy, but hoped they could settle the case by giving him probation instead. Tubbo said that as the terms of the probation, Tommy would be stripped of his vice-presidential powers, and would have to report all his activities to Fundy daily for two weeks. After some arguing, he then flicked the fourth lever, sealing Tommy's fate (although Tommy managed to save himself from the lava by placing a water bucket).

   They then moved on to Ranboo, but both Tommy and Niki vouched for Ranboo and Tommy saying he did the crime all alone. Ranboo was acquitted, ending the case. However, Dream was not satisfied, even though George himself had said that he was okay with the punishment Tommy received. Dream subtly threatened L'Manberg to exile Tommy and gave them three days to change their mind.
