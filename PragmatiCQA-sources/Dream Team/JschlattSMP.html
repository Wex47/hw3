   Schlatt was a human with tan skin, black eyes, brown hair, and a beard. He wore a black suit with a red tie and black shoes.
  </p>
  <p key="5429ec50-6af0-4766-aa64-a3a92622ec42">
   Schlatt was most likely born a biological human. However, in
   A spy's diary
   , Fundy explicity states that Schlatt had an 'aching body', which helped motivate his alcohol and smoking addiction due to wanting to suppress this feeling. In addition, Schlatt was incapable of swimming - and Fundy believes that this was due to some form of muscle atrophy. Fundy adds that Schlatt used protein supplements to regain his strength, however it is implied that these slowly lost their effect over time. As a ghost, Schlatt temporarily sported translucent red ram horns, supporting the popular theory that his character was a ram hybrid.

  <p key="98bc8e86-4652-42a2-a1d6-11090a0e7740">
   As a ghost, Schlatt has explicity made it clear that he is incapable of going outside. However, this might either be a placebo effect or a simple lie, as Schlatt did go outside during
   The Haunted Mansion
   , and he was able to go to Las Nevadas in order to gamble with Quackity.

   Schlatt was a charming, self-centered, tyrannical leader with a knack for manipulation. He was a calm and calculated individual who is rarely brought to anger, making the majority of his movements from behind a podium. As a leader, he preferred having absolute control, only pretending to take on the suggestions that his cabinet offer. He was very confident to the point where he would confront his enemies without a single piece of armor or a single weapon on his person.
  </p>
  <p key="b89a6508-2246-408f-b1ef-ea3415c75e59">
   He did not have much patience, becoming tired of activities that took too long. Schlatt also lacked professionalism at times, even going so far as to drinking whilst performing a presidential speech and allowing an underage child to drink alcohol at an event.
  </p>
  <p key="6199fdd8-80ae-4522-bde1-00c40c9b7f94">
   It is hard to gauge when Schlatt trusted or distrusted someone, as he guards his perception of his people very closely. Even when it appears he fully trusts someone, he keeps a close eye on their actions just in case. It is not clear where Schlatt's trust lies, if he trusts anyone at all.

   , but he retains his interest in protein powder, alcohol, working out, and cigarettes. Wilbur's first attempted revival allowed Schlatt to appear in the living world as Glatt, later being found working out in a cave filled with workout equipment by Quackity. Glatt explains that he had spent nearly all of his time working out (and learning Spanish on the side), due to claiming that he was incapable of leaving the cave. Occasionally, he is joined by Tommy (during his temporary death), Wilbur, and Mexican Dream at his gym. Glatt also mentions that Dream visits him on occasion, although this may have been a misspeak/misunderstanding, as he could have actually been referring to Mexican Dream.

   Schlatt's ultimate flaw is his independent attitude. He centralizes power into a single position so he could "rule better than the two tyrants," even though he himself is becoming a dictator, with no power to alternate positions of "vice president," "secretary of state," or "archbishop." He doesn't ask for help due to him believing that he could take on the world, though this oversight would eventually lead to his demise.

While running away through Tommy's tunnels, Wilbur proposed a compromise with Quackity and asked if they wanted to combine their parties into SWOG2020.

   Schlatt brought in many rules as the emperor of Manberg. The rules being to raise taxes on Niki, build an apartment complex on the caravan, give every citizen of Manberg a suit, and drain every lake and kill all animals. He also ordered several actions, including imprisoning Niki for standing up to him, ordering Fundy to burn down the L'Manberg Flag in order to replace it and getting everyone to try and hunt down Wilbur and Tommy.

   Schlatt called for a meeting in order to announce that Manberg would be having a festival in the name of democracy. He placed Tubbo in charge of the planning, trusting him to set the whole event up and giving him the role of a key speaker. His initial intentions with the festival were unclear, since Schlatt has always been vocally against democracy.
  </p>
  <p key="95a2e495-2b1d-453a-bf5e-909742ed3cd9">
   The festival began smoothly, and Schlatt oversaw the events in a good mood. However, his true intentions became clear once Tubbo's speech drew to a close. Schlatt enclosed him in yellow concrete, revealing that he knew about Tubbo's work with Pogtopia and his conspiring against Manberg. He sentenced him to immediate execution, making it clear that the festival was never intended to be a festival at all, but a public punishment of a traitor to the state. Schlatt ordered Technoblade to do the deed, pressuring him into using his rocket launcher to kill Tubbo. The explosions ended up killing Schlatt and Quackity as well.

  <p key="cc326f70-e1cf-4270-ad7e-217135d12122">
   Schlatt and Quackity reclaimed their position on the podium with Fundy joining them in Tubbo's empty space. When Wilbur arrived for a confrontation, Schlatt did not care for his theatrics, waving him away and referring to him condescendingly as 'lover boy'. As fighting broke out among the citizens, Schlatt took a step back.

  <p key="10edc72f-7395-425f-a3e9-65185b60a08c">
   Once it was over, he ordered the citizens to come back to their seats in order for him to make another speech. Niki started to speak up against him, but he shut her down by exiling her. He then asked for arrows in order to shoot her, but forgot that Tubbo was dead and so he had nobody to give him them. He turned to Quackity to ask him, but the confusion gave Niki enough time to escape. Schlatt then insulted Niki and Tubbo saying he was glad the festival ended in death and ruins, causing some conflict between him and the others.

   After telling Quackity to take the White House down, Quackity refused and challenged Schlatt's power. The two got into an argument over the amount of power Schlatt had, prompting Quackity to kill Schlatt and run. Schlatt ended up taking down the building with the help of Ponk, who was at the time, his only real supporter.

  <p key="281ad35c-e424-4a92-a3ab-4eaa2afba20b">
   Schlatt agreed to meet Quackity to discuss the
   building of the Manberg Hotel
   . In actuality, the discussion was a part of "Plan Ass", an attempt for Quackity to secretly transferring all presidential power from Schlatt to him, thus securing Pogtopian control over Manberg once again. However, Schlatt saw through this plan and changed the topic of the contract to the TNT he had found under Manberg (placed by Wilbur) and accused Quackity for the TNT, claiming that Quackity hated Manberg and wanted to take Schlatt down with Manberg. He then proceeded to wound Quackity, but Wilbur had obtained an arrow of invisibility from Ponk that would allow Quackity to escape into the forest behind Manberg undetected. Deep in the forest, Schlatt caught up with Quackity and Tommy, the latter of whom was witnessing the event from afar. Schlatt coughed and laughed as he said that the TNT was no longer under Manberg, but under
   Pogtopia
   . This was later revealed to be a lie, but the claim left the Pogtopians in a newfound state of discord and panic.

   During the war, Schlatt did not appear on the battlefield at all. After Dream and the rest of the Manbergian forces surrendered to Pogtopia, the members of the server involved in the conflict found Schlatt drinking heavily while lifting weights in the Camarvan. Schlatt spent the last minutes of his life arguing with Fundy and Quackity and hitting them with a broken bottle, dismayed by their betrayal - shocked at Fundy revealing his true allegiance, and then continuing to insult Quackity. He then mentioned smelling toast and his arm not being able to function properly; it was there that he finally passed away from a heart attack or a stroke, depending on who you ask. Briefly after his death, his ghost seemingly returns to insult Quackity one last time, i.e. calling him a "flatty patty", to Quackity's dismay and everyone else's amusement.

   At some point after Wilbur's first attempted revival, he became an actual fully-functional Glatt. He appeared in the Overworld and sent an unsigned book to Quackity, requesting that he travel to a set of coordinates. When Quackity got there, he saw a dead Schlatt, working out in a cave fully furnished with workout equipment. Schlatt explained that he was unable to leave, and had spent nearly all his time doing bench presses, and was also learning Spanish on the side. Occasionally, he was joined by Tommy (during his temporary death), Wilbur, and Mexican Dream. Schlatt explained that Dream also visited occasionally, and carried a book that was used to resurrect Tommy. Schlatt wanted Quackity to use that book on him. Quackity was reluctant, saying that Schlatt had treated him awfully, but proposed a bet: they would travel to Quackity's business of Las Nevadas and would gamble. If Schlatt won, he would be revived, but if Quackity won, Schlatt would remain dead and would serve Quackity's business forever. It is implied that Schlatt won, as Quackity later traveled  to

He took Connor hostage and told the party in order to get him back they'll have to find all three nether stars at the end of each hallway. The halls all had a series of parkour challenges, mazes, and/or other puzzles they'd have to complete. Glatt picked off one to three attendees after every hall. When they completed all the puzzles, it was revealed that Glatt was just an old, lonely ghost that just wanted friends.

      Schlatt refused to get treatment for his ever-increasing decline in health

      Schlatt and Quackity won the election as a team by pooling votes. As a result, they gained a positive partnership early on in The Manberg Rebellion. Schlatt allowed Quackity to keep him in check as the second in command of Manberg since he allowed Schlatt to win. However, they had disagreements, as Quackity had conflicting opinions on some of Schlatt's policies and even called Quackity Flatty Patty. After Quackity refused to take down The White House and challenged Schlatt's power, the two got into a huge argument where Quackity resigned. In Schlatt's final moments, Quackity expressed that Schlatt had ruined Manberg, and as a response, Schlatt uttered "Flatty...Patty" as his final words. Quackity appears to triggered by being called Flatty Patty and was greatly upset when Glatt called him that.

       When Quackity encountered Glatt in his underground gym he struck a deal with him that if Quackity got the revive book from Dream and lost the bet then he would have to bring Schlatt back to life but if Schlatt lost then he would have to be an unpaid employee of Las Nevadas.

      Tubbo had a fairly neutral opinion on Schlatt during his time working as his right-hand man as part of the
      Jschlatt Administration
      , despite how he was treated badly and threatened on a regular basis. Schlatt made fun of Tubbo,
      shouted at and insulted him.
      He openly disapproved of Tubbo's link to the original L'Manberg, attempting to remove the Camarvan and only being stopped by Tubbo managing to convince him to keep it
      and acting suspicious of Tubbo after he, Quackity and Fundy discovered Tubbo's underground archive of books related to L'Manberg's history.
      He also insulted Tubbo for wearing the L'Manberg revolutionary uniform, saying it smelled bad.
      <p key="3cae14c3-1cd1-4985-9fee-7e94f60cf9c4">
       Tubbo often lied to Schlatt to get out of trouble or to cover up his spy activities. For example, he told Schlatt that the
       Underground Prime Path
       , the tunnel that had been built to Pogtopia, was a tunnel Tubbo was digging to get to a Pillager watchtower so he could collect Totems of Undying for Schlatt,
       and lied about his whereabouts during the beginning of the Manberg Festival, during which he had actually been talking to Wilbur and Tommy in secret.

       At the Manberg Festival, Schlatt ordered Technoblade to execute Tubbo for being a traitor, having discovered Tubbo's spy activities for Pogtopia.
       As a result of this, Tubbo came to the realization that he had never been on Schlatt's good side. He fought against him with a passion during the
       Manberg vs Pogtopia War
       , and was relieved when Schlatt died. He attended Schlatt's funeral and seemed gleeful and happy that Schlatt was dead, going as far as to throw his bones in the river with Quackity.

       During his own presidency, Tubbo was often compared to Schlatt because of the decisions he made.
       These comparisons, combined with Tubbo's low self-esteem and harsh view of his own presidency, led him to also compare himself to Schlatt, and after the events of the

      Schlatt and Wilbur were once political allies, with Schlatt re-joining the server to endorse Wilbur's party. Since Schlatt's election and subsequent exiling of Wilbur, the two saw an increasingly tense relationship. Schlatt disliked Wilbur's leadership style, even the one he employed during his sanity, but he acknowledged that Wilbur is a threat to his nation, acting accordingly in order to stop him.
      <p key="aa394286-97b9-42b5-b896-68b98a2168fa">
       Schlatt seemed to be attempting to orchestrate Wilbur's movements to benefit him to some degree being well aware of his declining mental state. This is evident in how he toyed with his TNT room - though it's not clear if he did this on purpose.
      </p>
      <p key="3af73164-9886-46c2-b522-b6b75eaa6dc8">
       After Wilbur’s death, he and Schlatt were left together in the afterlife. During his short reunion with Tommy and Tubbo, Wilbur expressed his distaste for Schlatt and was opposed to the idea of either of them being resurrected, so their relationship seemingly hasn’t improved much if at all post-dying.
