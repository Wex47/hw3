Together, they carved into the hillside until they hit upon the natural ravine that would eventually become their new main base of operations. They had very few materials to work with, as Wilbur had been killed shortly after fleeing the country, and Tommy had been unprepared for their exile. After being contacted by Technoblade, Wilbur reluctantly allowed him to join their ranks, and the three sheltered in the ravine, naming themselves Pogtopia and beginning plans to reclaim their lost place in Manberg.

Initially, Wilbur refused to give him permission, but Tubbo showed him a document full of Schlatt's plans for Manberg, he allowed the act, and Tommy burned the flag down in the name of Pogtopia and L'Manberg. Niki, who had been standing her ground and fighting, asked to join Pogtopia due to her no longer having a safe home, but Wilbur refused the offer - saying that they were to busy to accept new members. Niki, upset by this, ran away to

   Tubbo constructed a secret tunnel from his bunker in Manberg to Pogtopia's base in order to make travel easier and more discreet. This significantly sped up the journey time, but also caused several close calls with Schlatt and Quackity. They were saved on one occasion, though, when Schlatt said that he simply "couldn't be bothered" and left (although it is later found out that he was well aware of the tunnel's existence for some time beforehand). Tommy later connected the tunnel's floor to the
   Prime Path
   so that he could continue to farm money during his exile. He spilled the secret to Quackity in hopes of earning his trust and destabilizing the administration, but the plan went south, so he had to resort to temporary blackmail to keep things quiet. Quackity seemed keen on helping later on, though, insisting that he wanted help build the path to Pogtopia. When asked why he wasn't reporting it to Jschlatt, he just shrugged it off, saying that it was his off-day, as he though it was the weekend when in actuality it was Tuesday. Upon finding this out, he ran off, but was shot in the head by Tommy as a non-canonical death, and it was played off as an entirely forgotten incident .

   Caught up in the strain of losing his nation and feeling betrayed by nearly all of his allies, Wilbur descended into mental instability and was reduced to a paranoid wreck, not trusting even his fellow Pogtopians and developing a vicious desire for the destruction of L'Manberg. The first instance of this was shown after he and Tommy were returning from spying on Schlatt's announcement of the
   <a href="Manberg Festival.html" key="fb1ece53-521a-4834-8068-6506354e2080" title="Manberg Festival">

He stated that their L'Manberg was irretrievable and far behind them, and that forcefully outing Schlatt, who had technically gotten into power through fair and legal means, would make them the "bad guys", as he put it. He embraced the idea rather than shying away from it, however, saying that they might as well be bad guys, and brought up the prospect of the
   destroying a L'Manberg that was no longer theirs

   ...Which isn't relevant to anything, but it's too funny not to include. In any case, Wilbur set up a control room similar to Eret's in a cave behind Manberg, consisting of signs with lyrics from the anthem and a single button that he linked all of the TNT to after rigging it beneath Manberg in an optimal pattern. He planned to detonate it after Tubbo's speech during the festival. Technoblade assisted him readily, along with Tubbo and far less willing Tommy.

   After the
   Manberg Massacre
   , there was a lot of tension in Pogtopia. Tubbo had been outed as a spy and executed by Technoblade, causing everyone to wonder whether they could trust him. Niki also joined Pogtopia after officially being exiled from Manberg and immediately made conflict with Wilbur - arguing with him over the TNT plot, which she was completely against.
  </p>
  <p key="3e36ace4-6d95-4d84-8bcf-cec2a4e22cf3">
   Wilbur decided to hold off on his initial TNT plot, but still intended to completely demolish Manberg at a later date, and Techno fully supported this plot of anarchy. While Wilbur believed that no one on the server had morals anymore, it no longer mattered to him, and he was perfectly content with his and Techno's plan much to the others dismay.
  </p>
  <p key="c10ebcd3-90cf-448c-96f3-0d048e94268d">
   Tommy still refused to support their wishes of destruction, reluctantly acknowledging that Wilbur had lost his mind, and already having lost all of trust in Technoblade after Tubbo's death at the Festival. Tommy, Tubbo, and Niki were all on the same moral side, holding faith that they could still restore L'Manberg, and vowed to stick together.

   During the
   White House
   deconstruction, Quackity had a massive argument with Schlatt, being called a "flatty patty" and being belittled even though his votes brought Schlatt into power. In a fit of anger, Quackity shot Schlatt, taking his second canon life and resigned, joining Pogtopia in the effort against Schlatt. Tommy spoke to him afterwards, and Quackity was passionate about joining their resistance, insisting that Schlatt had not been the person Quackity had thought he was when he'd made the coalition government.

  <p key="0ca18b1d-13e0-42d7-ae18-da2ec0f542e8">
   Wilbur didn't seem to care one way or another about Quackity's arrival, as he had little faith in his allies to begin with and no longer seemed bothered with loyalty. He took Tommy and Quackity to his control room with the intention of blowing up Manberg right on the spot, but he was finally dissuaded when they sealed themselves inside with him, insisting that they would die with him if he were to press the button. Wilbur reluctantly took the button down, relinquishing control of Pogtopia's rebellion to Tommy, but as soon as the two had their backs turned, he replaced it and swore that he would be back for it later.

   After Nihachu's birthday party, Wilbur grew tired of the slow pace of the planning, so he turned to the control room and threatened Quackity with the detonation of his bombs. Quackity scrambled to appease him, finally settling on a deadline for more action to be taken: Friday, November 6th. He also promised Wilbur that if Plan Ass showed any signs of failing, he would be allowed to move on to Plan Bomb and destroy everything. Wilbur was satisfied with that answer and logged off in the control room out of sheer anticipation. Later that week, Quackity warned Technoblade and Tommy of the ultimatum.

   Quackity met up with Schlatt under the guise of signing the permit for the new
   Manberg Hotel
   , but in reality, he planned to trick the president into signing his power away. Wilbur and Tommy watched from a distance as backup. Schlatt saw through the lies, however, and said that he had found the button room and moved the explosives to Pogtopia. Things quickly went poorly, causing Quackity and Tommy to flee and Wilbur returning to the control room to try and set off the bombs. As feared, however, Wilbur's attempted detonation attempt failed, so all three had to retreat back to Pogtopia. Quackity and Tommy tried to confront Wilbur on the fact he pressed the button at all, but he ignored them when Fundy arrived, revealing that he had never really been on Schlatt's side, either. Fundy leaked Schlatt's weaknesses and addictions and showed Wilbur
   his diary
   , promising the Pogtopians that he had never intended to betray them.

  <p key="61c4bdb8-af4f-4fbd-8749-97dc6645e337">
   Shortly afterwards, BadBoyHalo returned out of nowhere, and Wilbur had the realization that the power dynamics were shifting. Everyone was on Pogtopia's side only because Pogtopia looked to be coming out on top, and Schlatt was powerless since he was alone. Dream arrived before any further plans could be made, however, and informed the rebels that in spite of his previous actions to help them, he and Dream SMP would be fighting alongside Schlatt in the upcoming war and supplying Manberg with resources. Dream then warned the group ahead of time that a traitor was among the ranks and briefly spoke to Tommy about his discs before leaving the Pogtopians to their own concerns.

   Upon the dawn of the new war, Pogtopia formally entered its preparation phase. After much grinding, the Pogtopians were still not overly confident in their abilities, but Technoblade then revealed his underwater base that was filled with rare and powerful items such as netherite armor, enchanted items, strong weapons, and many different kinds of potions. The Pogtopians stormed L'Manberg with a newfound passion, and after only a short battle, Dream and his allies surrendered, because - quote - "Schlatt's an idiot". Pogtopia and Manberg then entered the Camarvan to watch a drunk Schlatt. After Schlatt started attacking Fundy, Wilbur asked Tommy to use Dream's crossbow to kill Schlatt. However, Schlatt died of a heart attack just before Tommy could carry out the deed.

   The war had officially been won and L'Manberg was restored. Dream said that he had lied about the existence of a traitor to make Pogtopia nervous. Tubbo was elected president by Wilbur due to Tommy passing up the position, but during Tubbo's speech, Wilbur excused himself and left the speech discreetly. After the speech was over, they had just begun taking down the festival decorations when Dream revealed that there was actually a traitor - Wilbur. Wilbur meanwhile went into the button room to detonate L'Manberg, but

But Wilbur went through with the plan, anyway, pressing the button and destroying at least half of central L'Manberg. Meanwhile, Technoblade, realizing that they planned to instate a new government, took the opportunity to (non-canonically) assassinate Tubbo. He then attacked L'Manberg, joined by the Dream SMP and the Badlands, just before L'Manberg blew up. He then spawned two withers in L'Manberg, decimating it even further. Wilbur was killed for the third and final time by

   as per his request and Technoblade abandoned his former allies and turned to a life of seclusion, leaving Tubbo and Tommy as the respective President and Vice President "of a crater", in Wilbur's own words. Dream revealed that he had made a deal with Wilbur: regardless of the outcome on November 16th, he would re-rig the control room and blow up L'Manberg. Pogtopia was dissolved on the 16th of November, 2020 shortly after the war; annexed by L'Manberg, becoming a state/district of the country.

   After L'Manberg was retaken, Pogtopia was abandoned and has since fallen into a state of decay. The ravine, along with all of its supplies, has been left uncared for. The torches have all been removed, leaving the corridors dark, and the potato farm was also left behind, leaving its crops to be ruined by the lack of proper management. Buttons have been placed everywhere by Fundy as a means of causing psychological trauma to its former residents. Pogtopia went from being a glorious communist/anarchist utopia that consisted of members of differing ideals to an abandoned ghost ravine in a state of disrepair. There were no longer any citizens of Pogtopia, as its purpose had now been completed.
