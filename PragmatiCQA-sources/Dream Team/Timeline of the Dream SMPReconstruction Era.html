    L'Manberg's Reconstruction Era
   </b>
   , followed
   The Manberg-Pogtopia War Era
   . The L'Manbergians must rebuild from the ruins that are left from the destruction of the past era. The
   Tubbo Administration
   has re-established peace in the territories of
   L'Manberg
   . Technoblade has retreated far into a tundra forest to avoid attack from angry L'Manbergians. However, there is also the looming threat of the
   Badlands
   and
   Dream SMP
   . Tommy, who refused presidency of L'Manberg, is on a mission to reclaim his discs while having to face the consequences of being Vice-President.
