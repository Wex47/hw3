   and mess with his house, though it's not certain exactly what he'd done to do so. In retaliation, Sapnap burned down one of Ponk's many Lemon Trees, only for the fire to kill Sapnap in the process, and grow wildly out of control, burning almost the entire tree down. Ponk grew enraged, and gained support from

   , and the two began planning their retaliation against Sapnap.
  </p>
  <p key="fad4d26b-dee8-42af-bc2b-8766703f4ef7">
   The day of reckoning came after Tommy and
   Tubbo
   joined the server, beginning when Tubbo had attempted to try to help rebuild Ponk's destroyed lemon tree, feeling bad for him. He ended up giving up after running out of resources, and was contacted by Alyssa to come to her house, as she'd found a sign saying that he'd stolen one of her diamonds. However, since Tubbo had not picked up any diamonds before, which was proved when he picked one up and received the achievement. Ponk then deduced that it was Tommy who'd taken the diamond, as framing someone sounded like a very "Tommy-like" thing to do.
  </p>
  <p key="a2975338-d182-4876-8aca-c98cad74b17a">
   Ponk and Alyssa then left to confront Sapnap, with Tubbo following after them. When they arrived, Sapnap began chasing after them, severely higher powered and more geared up than them. Ponk then noticed that Sapnap had a Netherite chestplate on, but knew that Tommy was the only one to have one at the time, and it must've been stolen from him. Sapnap asked for an apology from Ponk for griefing his house, but he refused, stating that Sapnap should be the one apologizing for destroying his lemon tree.
  </p>
  <p key="4052d248-12de-4030-8a76-6b3cf6542835">
   As their conflict continued, Sapnap's house was eventually burnt down by Ponk and Alyssa. Tubbo immediately tried fixing it, exclaiming that nothing on this server was sacred to anyone. Soon after,
   Punz
   logged on, asking what had happened. Once he was caught up to speed, Punz stated that he was on the side of justice, and would not be playing favorites. Sapnap announced in the middle of it all that no one could touch Punz or Tubbo.

   Not long after, Tommy logged onto the server, already mad that someone had messed with his base, and knowing that Sapnap had stolen his chestplate. Shortly after joining, he joined a voice chat with Sapnap and demanded his armor be returned. Sapnap said that he was willing to return it if Tommy joined him in fighting against Ponk and Alyssa. Tommy asked for his things back again, saying that he would only negotiate once his things had been returned, to which Sapnap begrudgingly agreed. He then told Tommy that they could become the most powerful people on the server, as long as Tommy had his back.
  </p>
  <p key="998f7799-7642-431f-b4b0-38ccc1f66303">
   Sapnap then explained the situation to Tommy, and said that he'd taken Tommy's things to ensure his victory, and asked him to pick a side. Tommy considered it, saying that he didn't want to team with Ponk or Alyssa at all, and wasn't warm to the idea of teaming with Tubbo after he'd accidentally caused Tommy to lose his stuff the day before. Tommy agreed to help Sapnap after he was set on fire by Alyssa.
  </p>
  <p key="ae270d57-32ab-4d12-a2cc-7f820304a37c">
   Once Tommy accepted, Sapnap instructed him to get into position and prepare for a fight. Completely unprepared, Tommy jumped into the fray, and was immediately killed by Alyssa, and joined their voice channel to demand his things back from them. Ponk decided to give Tommy his chestplate back, while Sapnap gave Tommy the rest of his items.

   During the intense battle, Dream logged onto the server in order to stop the fighting. Though they were slightly concerned by the development, it didn't stop Tommy and Sapnap from shooting and successfully killing Ponk. After gaining some newfound confidence, Sapnap and Tommy decided to kill Dream. The two then ambushed him, easily taking him out, since he was only in iron armor.
  </p>
  <p key="c37d1d93-1b70-4f03-a1e3-93d05311642f">
   While Tommy was gloating about killing Dream to Ponk and Alyssa, Dream took the time to steal Tommy's most prized possessions, his music discs Cat and Mellohi. When Tommy discovered this, he began negotiating with Dream, who simply asked for an apology.
  </p>
  <p key="53fc6995-1945-4eba-a840-824b2a2dff59">
   Sapnap then took the time to steal one of the discs back, giving Tommy the chance to hide it underground to keep it safe from Dream before engaging in another battle with Dream, ending up with both discs in his possession. He then went to hide them off-screen, keeping them in the mountain near his base, thinking them to be safe.

   Still angry about being bested by Tommy, Dream carved out all of the lands underneath Tommy's home in a desperate search for the discs. Though Tommy had hidden his screen to keep Dream and others from finding his discs, he hadn't turned his sounds off, and Dream used them to locate where Tommy had hidden them. Dream then kept the discs to himself, even threatened to burn them, telling Tommy that he won't give them back unless he gave over his Netherite chestplate. After a short confrontation, Dream ended up killing both Tommy and Tubbo twice, forcing them to give up.

   and a Pizza Hut date, Dream began to play Tommy's music discs in front of him to taunt him. In a time-consuming and tense build battle on Punz's front lawn, which resulted in Tommy and Tubbo repeatedly stealing back the music discs only to lose them again when Dream hunted them down to take it back. Finally, Tommy managed to grab the disc from Dream, and drop it into the trees for Tubbo to pick up. However, Tubbo wasn't able to actually find it, only saying that he'd heard the item pickup sound before both of them had combat logged to protect themselves. When they relogged, they found that the tree had no disc and that it was still in Dream's hands.

  <p key="b3d0ea7e-2dd8-4906-a9dc-a1d2c2340e2d">
   Eventually, Dream got bored of fighting the two, and began to burn fake discs in front of Tommy to try and get a reaction out of him. It worked, and Tommy agreed to do a trade. At the moment they began trading, both of them faked one another out, with Dream dropping fake music discs with Tubbo later picking it up and Tommy grabbing the Netherite chestplate back after dropping it then logs off before Dream could kill him, leaving both parties without what they wanted. Little did they know, some things weren't right.

   Tommy, tired of waiting for something that might help him get leverage to get his discs back, went to retrieve Tubbo from Fundy's
   socializing club
   , which ended in them teaming up to kill
   Fundy
   and
   Purpled
   . Because Tubbo had prior knowledge about different glitches, he and Tommy exploited a composter glitch that allowed them to see underground to find Dream's secret base. They spotted it near Tommy's own base, hidden in the mountainside. However, when they arrived, Tommy's discs were nowhere to be found, and instead, Tommy and Tubbo stole Dream's full stack of diamonds, which they assumed were his most prized possession.

  <p key="e1e2c90a-b1f7-4fb2-add2-4100ebc33039">
   After not being able to find the discs in Dream's base, Tommy then accused Punz of finding it before them and taking the discs for himself, as Punz had been mad at them for doing a "Fortnite Build Battle" on his front lawn, as well as stealing some of his things, most notably, three golden apples. Dream logged on quickly after, causing Tommy to forget about Punz for the moment, and instead confront Dream in hopes of getting his discs back. Tommy tried to negotiate with Dream's diamonds in exchange for his discs, but Dream gave his same demand as before, the Netherite chestplate or nothing in return. Finally, Tommy gave up trying to scam Dream because Dream promised that he could keep the diamonds

   the music discs if he just gave over the chestplate, to which Tommy agreed. Everything went off without a hitch, but Tommy then realized that Dream wouldn't stop coming after them so easily, and that he'd need to make an Ender Chest in order to keep the discs safe forever.

   He attempted to get them from Fundy, but he flat out refused after how Tommy had been treating him previously, specifically at the socializing club conflict. Tommy then went to Punz in hopes of getting them, and Punz agreed, as long as Tommy brought him back an apple. Because he never specified a golden apple. Tommy then races at the tree hoping to get an apple and when he got it he immediately brought it to Punz. Punz was notably disappointed but didn't care because Tommy technically fulfilled his request and gave Tommy some blaze powder and ender pearls.

   He then went to mine the obsidian with Dream hot on his tail, managing to mine 7 out of the 8 he needed as Tubbo attempted to fend Dream off. Low on hunger, Tommy told Tubbo that he only managed 7, but Tubbo exclaimed that he had extra obsidian in his chest back at his base. The two met at the last second as Tommy completed the ender chest, and managed to save all of his things inside, just before Dream killed him.

  <p key="e01faec0-9e4f-4fe1-a991-3e9575183fe5">
   For a while after the first war, things were relatively uneventful, but once
   Skeppy
   joined, and got in possession of Spirit, the leather remains from Dream's first and only horse, things began to change. While Skeppy was rushing to an Ender chest to secure it, he was blown up and died, causing his things to go everywhere. In a mad dash to get it back, he was interrogated by Tommy and Tubbo, but managed to secure Spirit and put it into an Ender chest, though it was a close call.
  </p>
  <p key="f706e656-83d4-4c8c-a12c-1b4ba7d5b743">
   Soon, Dream found out that Skeppy was in possession of the leather, and offered to kill Tommy and Tubbo in order to get it back, as the two had been harassing Skeppy. Though he wouldn't agree to that, Skeppy and Dream began other negotiations. Skeppy asked for both of Tommy's discs in return for the leather, but Dream stated that they were much too valuable for that.
  </p>
  <p key="2e4c84e3-62b0-48e9-a9df-359b5926bbf9">
   Tommy then got into the negotiations, as he didn't want the discs to be separated, and Dream agreed to let Skeppy and Tommy come to an agreement, and left the call for a few minutes. Tommy then attempted to blackmail Skeppy over a few tweets he'd made, but it didn't do much to further his case. He then tried to bring Quackity in to intimidate Skeppy for the discs, though this ended up failing.
  </p>
  <p key="62290b34-303f-41c5-9e89-0781e0e03558">
   Finally, Dream met with Skeppy with Tommy and Tubbo watching from outside. Dream offered one of the discs for the leather, while Tommy and Tubbo were offering Netherite armor. Though he wanted both deals, eventually, Skeppy agreed to trade the leather for the disc, Cat. Dream and Skeppy successfully traded, with both of their prizes ending up in Ender chests, but not knowing this, Tommy and Tubbo attempted to kill Skeppy, only making more bad blood between them.

  <p key="6704eea2-6b84-4ca2-b831-0c1b1f2748a0">
   On a trip back from his 'summer home', Tommy accidentally ran over an AFK Dream with his minecart, killing him and giving Tommy the ability to steal all of his items, including a full set of enchanted Netherite armor and sword. Tommy and Tubbo believed that they might then have the ability to get the discs back as Skeppy and Dream were both on the server at the time.
  </p>
  <p key="f8f660c0-908c-4857-916b-99d204e5cf42">
   Both of them weren't willing to trade discs, but Dream did offer Spirit in exchange for his things back, which Tommy considered. He and Tubbo then went on to kill both Skeppy and Dream with their higher powered gear. Dream then went on to say that he didn't actually care about his gear enough to trade the disc, as he could eventually get it all back, but that Spirit would be a fair trade. It was also around this time that Dream found out about Tommy's beloved cow, Henry, and knew that it could be used as a bargaining chip.
  </p>
  <p key="5994dfb2-b6df-42bb-9b03-5ae07fd92323">
   Wilbur then came online to try and convince Tommy to give Dream's things back on behalf of L'Manberg. Tommy and Tubbo decided not to, which resulted in Dream killing Tommy's horse, and Tommy killing Dream. Tommy then tried to negotiate with Skeppy, but Skeppy had already felt slighted by Tommy and wasn't willing to trade.
  </p>
  <p key="c586b906-2853-4c64-8ad9-0ceb2b174060">
   Tommy and Tubbo created a plan to get back the disc from Skeppy after agreeing with Wilbur and giving Dream's armor back in exchange for the leather. The only hitch was that Dream's Netherite sword was still missing. Tommy attempted to trade with Skeppy, but Skeppy refused, and it was at this time that Dream realized his sword was missing, and threatened Tommy's cow Henry in order to get it back. Tommy swore he didn't have it, and told Dream he'd give him his own sword, Shank, in return.
  </p>
  <p key="cf1a5a8e-3e78-4d66-8cb9-7fc1d3c6feaf">
   After sorting things out with Dream, Tommy tried to trade with Skeppy, but now Skeppy was demanding five sets of Netherite armor in exchange for the disc. Tommy considered trying to kill Skeppy to get Dream's sword back, as his chat was telling him that Skeppy had it, but Dream made the mistake of showing Tommy that he had a disc on him, and Tommy realized that if he could kill Dream before he banked it back into an ender chest, he could get it back.
  </p>
  <p key="ac2ba845-5029-44e4-916d-1628f69ead02">
   At this time, Sapnap had agreed to act as a hired mercenary for Tommy, in exchange for payment. They agreed to jump Dream and try and take the disc, while Tommy lured Dream to his base with the promise of the leather for free. Dream tried to lie, and say he didn't have the disc on him, but Tommy didn't believe him, and Dream began booking it towards the nearest ender chest. Tubbo then began breaking as many ender chests as he could find as Sapnap and Tommy fended him off. They then holed up in Tommy's summer home while waiting for Dream, and it was then that Tommy realized Dream might try to kill Henry as leverage.
  </p>
  <p key="d411ff57-0247-4af8-8156-01ada9b1c2f3">
   The four fought one another for the disc, but when Sapnap ended up killing Dream, he found that Dream indeed didn't have the disc on his person. Sapnap then decided not to give Dream's stuff to Tommy as his own leverage, betraying Tommy for the second time.
  </p>
  <p key="6bcd1ff4-ebc2-43a2-8f74-a9f60b3be3ae">
   Dream then killed Tommy and Tubbo, taking Tubbo's Netherite armor. He then attempted to trade for the leather, offering Tubbo's Netherite armor and even a lifetime immunity pass for Henry, but Tommy refused. After this, Tommy and Dream agreed to temporary peacetime.
  </p>
  <p key="deccd8c1-245a-40bf-a75d-1e36d2a9e055">
   It was then that Tubbo revealed to Tommy that he'd had Dream's sword all along, one of the most powerful bargaining chips after the discs and Spirit, meaning Tubbo and Tommy could gain the upper hand.

   For a while, things were peaceful, until Sapnap accidentally killed
   Niki
   's fox,
   Fungi
   , killed Tommy's cow, Harold, and almost killed Tommy's favorite cow,
   Henry
   . Both Tommy and Niki found out, and were angered by it. Tommy proceeded to break all of the windows in Sapnap's basement, while Niki demanded revenge. Niki told Tommy that Sapnap's most prized possession was his fish,
   Beckerson
   and
   Mars
   , and in an act of vengeance, captured Beckerson while accidentally letting Mars go free. After regrouping with Tubbo at his base, Tommy realized that Mars was actually Sapnap's fish, while Beckerson was

   's. Tommy ended up with Mars and Beckerson, and while he wasn't able to get into contact with George or Sapnap. Though he technically wasn't able to get in touch with Dream at first, he nearly leaked Dream's phone number to a viewership of 40,000, which ended up getting Dream's attention.
  </p>
  <p key="52d6e2ac-7c41-4a36-b123-c1ddaa4d0c40">
   It turned out that Mars and Beckerson actually meant a lot to Dream, and that Tommy would be able to use them as leverage to get it disc back. Not wanting to do that, but still feeling cocky, Dream blocked himself into Tommy's jukebox room and started playing Tommy's disc. Tubbo and Tommy broke through the back wall and managed to steal the disc from Dream long enough for Tommy to put it in his ender chest, only to realize that it was a fake. Tommy tried to call Dream's bluff, and told him to "burn the real disc" only for Dream to refuse.

  <p key="15ae1f29-9686-4aef-b4f2-ded93d769683">
   Tommy asked Tubbo to become "Big Law", his lawyer persona in order for them to wager a court case against Dream. However, Dream never showed up, and was instead running around the server. Tommy was tipped off by his chat that he might want to go see his summer home, only for him to find that Dream had kidnapped Henry the cow, and Tommy's Llama, and was holding them hostage. He told Tommy that in exchange for all of his leverage, (the fish, along with Spirit's leather), he'd give Tommy the remaining disc back. They started conspiring with

  </p>
  <p key="dbd0de5b-6e50-42d0-adc7-e70ef04761cc">
   Tommy then tried again to scam Dream making a fake Spirit, by having Jack drop him it in one of the community chests. Dream accidentally ended up with the fake, but was unsure whether it was the real one or not. Tommy managed to hide the real Spirit underneath the floor of his house after muting his stream's video and audio.
  </p>
  <p key="1e01ec9a-b693-4298-92e1-3c53fd5e8b58">
   Dream then gave Tommy the final deal, he could have his pets, his disc, and Tubbo's bee boxes back in exchange for Beckerson and Mars, the real Spirit, and Dream's sword. However, Dream believed that he had the real Spirit, as when he looked at Tommy's inventory in his Ender chest, Spirit wasn't there, as it was really underneath Tommy's floor. The two made the trade, but Tommy waited to celebrate until Dream had logged off, in case of Dream killed his pets. Dream saw this, however, and logged back on.
  </p>
  <p key="ddde1320-ae4a-4284-83a1-f992721b3e99">
   Tommy was about to go defend his pets when he realized that he'd also been scammed. The disc he'd stolen from Dream after the jukebox incident was the real thing, whereas the one he'd gotten from the most recent trade was the fake copy. Dream didn't end up killing Tommy's pets, and the two were relatively peaceful for quite a long time.

   During the meeting, Tubbo, Tommy, and Dream came to an agreement, until Tommy pushed his luck, stating that he wasn't afraid of Dream, as Dream had nothing on him anymore. He wasn't in possession of any of the discs, and held no leverage. Tommy, on the other hand, held in his ender chest the remains of Spirit, who'd previously been important to Dream in the past. Tubbo didn't believe that what Tommy was doing was the right choice, despite it appearing to work, as they lead Dream to the obsidian walls he'd build to break them down, he eventually started building them back up.

  <p key="eb8a6eaf-268f-4557-94b4-4e7f6504e431">
   Dream then jumped down from the wall and gave a monologue about the discs, and their importance to him, and more importantly, that Spirit no longer mattered to him in the long run. Tommy and Tubbo had a further schism between them as they began to argue about what was important. Tommy thought his discs, and believed that Tubbo, who'd been with him from the start would stick by his side forever, and Tubbo believing in the new era of L'Manberg he was building, and the shaky peace he was honor bound to uphold with Tommy's greatest rival.

   gave Tommy a Chirp disc while he was in exile, however, after Dream came to meet with them, Tommy handed it off to Bad. After Dream left, Bad hid the disc under Tommy's chest where he later found it. Tommy then spent his stream making himself an ender chest to store the disc, along with his diamonds and "How to Sex 2". Tommy was gifted Pigtstep by Bad on Christmas Day. This is called Fake Pigstep as Hbomb94 gave Tommy the real one.

   After escaping exile to hide beneath Technoblade's retirement home, Tommy was caught by the man himself, who confronted Tommy about what he'd done. Following some deliberation, Techno eventually agreed to help Tommy retrieve his discs, as long as Tommy helped with some "mild terrorism". The two then agreed to gear up heavily before engaging in any sort of battle.

   On December 27, after extorting Tubbo and Ranboo for the return of two of Technoblade's items, Tommy and Techno were confronted by Dream at the community nether portal as they were attempting to leave. Dream then revealed to Tommy that he'd gotten Tommy's disc back from Skeppy. As the conversation furthered, Dream threatened to burn Tommy's disc unless he came with him, until Techno stepped in to protect Tommy.

   On January 5, the L'Manbergians held a festival in an attempt to kill Dream, however, in the middle of the festival, Dream arrived only to begin placing obsidian around the country. He then began shouting about how Tommy had fucked up, and that they needed to pay. When they questioned why he was doing so, he leads them to the Community House, which had been destroyed, as he claimed, by Tommy. He told the L'Manbergians that they needed to pay for Tommy's crimes as he was supposed to be in exile, while Tubbo argued that it had been Dream's job to take care of Tommy while he was there.
  </p>
  <p key="5cee451b-3e51-4191-b711-1a5fce53fd29">
   Dream then argued that as long as Tommy's disc, Mellohi, was still in Tubbo's position, they were connected to him, and demanded that he hand it over. Tubbo at first thought about it, only to be interrupted by an invisible Tommy, who revealed himself to them all and begged Tubbo not to give it over. They argued for a short while until it fully escalated into an all-out fight, where the two were splashed with potions before battling it out in what remained of the center of the Community house. The two didn't manage to do much damage to one another, shouting at one another all of their pent up aggression from the past few months of being away from one another. It wasn't until they began yelling about the discs, and Tommy shouted "The discs were worth more than you ever were" that he realized he'd taken it too far, and stopped fighting.

   Tommy, suddenly ashamed of the person he'd become, told Tubbo to give the disc to Dream, and after Tommy said that he hated the person he'd become, Tubbo handed it over to Dream. Dream then laughed, saying that Tubbo was an idiot, and he now had exactly what he needed to destroy L'Manberg for good.

   Dream confronted them, showing them brief glimpses of the disc, before Tommy attempted to attack him, saying he was giving him no time to think. He eventually fought them off, asking them to talk, which they obliged.

Tubbo told him that it would be fine if he were to die to save the disc, but Tommy couldn't bear to do that, opening the Ender chest and taking out the disc, giving it to Dream. Dream then began to laugh, saying that the discs were fakes while dropping and blowing the fake Cat and Mellohi disc with TNT. He then stated that he would never give them over and won't do the same mistake he did the last time, he just wanted to make a show of the power he had.

   Dream then demands that the two of them place all of their things into a hole for him to blow up, exactly what he did during Tommy's exile. While the two placed all of their things in the hole, Dream asked Tommy for the Axe Of Peace.

He also showed them places for items, pets, and even people, as it appeared he had a plan to take Skeppy away from Bad as Bad only cared about Skeppy. Dream then told Tommy that he couldn't kill him, but he had a prison he could put him in, to keep him around.
