   Following the announcement of the festival,

    Manberg
   </a>
   worked to clean up the city to prepare it for the big day.
   Ponk
   ,
   Tubbo
   , and
   Karl
   all worked to build up structures and games for the festival, and Manberg enjoyed a week or so of relative downtime.
  </p>
  <p key="5d6a6d0c-1638-428c-95bd-ec9c5b6f4b23">
   On the other hand, tension grow heavy in Pogtopia as
   Wilbur
   began to wonder if he was actually the good guy, or if he was actually a villain bringing down someone who'd turned around a country he couldn't.
   Tommy
   insisted that they weren't, but was unable to convince Wilbur that all hope wasn't lost. Wilbur began planning to blow up Manberg on the day of the festival. He asked
   Dream
   for TNT, who provided it for him easily, despite Tommy's objections.
  </p>
  <p key="5def4103-e667-40d5-982e-dc2f5794e69e">
   Wilbur then laid the TNT beneath Manberg, and waited for the day of the festival.
  </p>
  <p key="9a616c07-2cb5-45f6-b00a-538cb42ea09b">
   The festival was relatively normal at first, with the guests and the hosts enjoying the festivities. It wasn't until
   Tubbo
   's speech that things started to go wrong. When Tubbo finished speaking, Schlatt revealed that he knew Tubbo was a spy, and sentenced him to death for treason. He asked
   Technoblade
   to do the job, which he did after several minutes of 'peer pressure'.
  </p>

   Back in Pogtopia after Tubbo's death, Tommy confronted Techno, no longer wanting to be on the same side as he was. The Pogtopian forces shattered into fragments as Wilbur and Techno both demanded the complete destruction of Manberg's government, while Tommy, Tubbo, and Niki stayed with the original Pogtopian ideology to reclaim L'Manberg at all costs.

   The day after the Festival, Tommy headed over to Manberg with a single goal, to assassinate Schlatt. At the same time, Schlatt ordered
   Quackity
   to take down
   the original White House
   . Tommy aimed at Schlatt with a bow while Schlatt and Quackity continued their argument from yesterday about taking the White House down, the distribution of power between them, and the policies that were enacted by Schlatt.

   In the end, Quackity told Schlatt that he needed to find a new Vice President and killed Schlatt before escaping into the forest. Schlatt proceeded to dismantle the White House by himself,
   Ponk

   Tommy had overheard the entire argument and decided to find Quackity in the forest. The two built a shakey trust, and Tommy allowed Quackity to join
   Pogtopia
   . Tommy mentioned to Quackity about how
   Wilbur
   has gone insane and how the festival went a lot better than it should have.
  </p>
  <p key="cf1e7c3c-9b05-4e1b-8821-fca9996e02ec">
   Tommy then informed Wilbur about Quackity joining the faction, and showed Quackity Pogtopia. The pair then decided to troll Schlatt (like
   Skeppy
   ) by making Manberg less family friendly, building a giant cobblestone phallus in front of the Manberg flag. Wilbur, Tommy and Quackity found a monument to “Crying About It” that Schlatt had placed where the original White House stood. They all reminisced about building The White House together, and Wilbur leaked his explosive plan after saying that it was the only location not covered in his TNT.

   Wilbur then showed off the room where he had put the button for the TNT. He had meant to go there during the festival, but had forgotten where the entrance was. He then gave a quick speech about he was ready to blow Manberg up and end it all. In the middle of it, Tommy accidentally sent a private message to Wilbur instead of Quackity, and their plan to stop him was revealed. They then tried to convince Wilbur to calm down and not hit the button, resorting to locking him in a cobblestone box blocking his reach. Tommy told Wilbur that they wouldn't leave the room, and that if he blew it up, he'd blow up them as well.
  </p>
  <p key="7582423d-6eb4-41e2-94b9-73d51dd7bcad">
   Wilbur decided to concede, but referenced the literary trope of "Chekhov's Gun" (a dramatic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed), which implied that Wilbur would detonate the TNT sooner or later. He then broke the button and said he would go with their plan.

   Tommy and Quackity left the room so Wilbur could have a moment to himself and think, and during the time, he sung the L’Manberg National Anthem to himself and placed the button back. Wilbur then sealed the room behind him and the three began to make plans.

   After Niki's birthday party, which several members of the server attended, Karl, Niki, Quackity and Wilbur hung out, singing songs and chilling out. After Quackity sang a "love song" to Wilbur, Wilbur suddenly told Quackity that he was "scum". He then went on to say that he had been waiting for this moment, that he had been waiting for someone to stream so he could do this in front of an large audience. He suddenly ran off to Manberg, saying that he was going to press the button and blow it up.
  </p>
  <p key="d6d1034f-e2c7-4046-936b-74b98788be7f">
   Quackity, Niki, and Karl ran after him, begging him not to blow it up (though Karl was confused about what was happening). Quackity tried to reason with Wilbur, but Wilbur retorted by asking Quackity when he was going to go through with Plan Ass. Quackity asked Wilbur to give him a few days to set up the meeting, and Wilbur agreed. They made a deal; Quackity would go through with Plan Ass, and Wilbur wouldn't blow up Manberg. Wilbur gave Quackity until Friday, November 6, to go through with the plan. If he didn't go through with it by then, Wilbur would blow up Manberg. Quackity agreed, and they both logged off for the night.

   While searching for a name tag to name his horse, Tommy came upon Ponk, who offered him a deal. In exchange for a doctor's license in Pogtopia, he would give Tommy a book written by Dream for George's birthday. Tommy, deciding that he could put the book to good use for Dream/George clicks, agreed, writing and signing the book stating that Ponk was free to sell essential oils in Pogtopia for the next 20 days, where they would renew the contract.
  </p>
  <p key="ea6e0914-4dec-4482-b4ae-e343a0f26532">
   When Tommy asked Ponk why he was asking for a license, Ponk replied that things in Manberg weren't going as well for him, and he didn't technically have the ability to practice.

   Tommy then began heading around the server, discovering Techno's horse breeding cave.

   Before meeting with Schlatt, Quackity devised a plan to hopefully transfer power without Schlatt being aware. He created a book, which he pretended was building plans for the new Manberg Hotel that Schlatt wanted to get started. The document was 100 pages long, with the very final page containing a clause that meant that immediately after Schlatt signed it, Quackity would take power. Quackity's main worry was that if he tried to assassinate Schlatt, Fundy would simply take over, and at that point, Quackity believed that Fundy was still loyal to the President.

  <p key="0c4a16b5-c884-42c6-b2b7-2ca9c54abdce">
   He met with Tommy in Ninja's House to discuss, and Quackity showed him the book, having him read out the contents. They both agreed that it was a good plan, and Quackity went to set up a meeting with Schlatt. In their brief conversation, Quackity managed to convince Schlatt to meet him at the podium, despite his blatant disregard for what Quackity was trying to say.

   Quackity then went to meet with Schlatt at the podium as Tommy rendezvoused with Wilbur at one of the towers that overlooked the podium. As Quackity and Schlatt discussed terms, Tommy and Wilbur listened in, thinking that they might actually have a shot at getting Schlatt to sign the papers. Things started to go sideways as Schlatt began reading more into the document, which Quackity had hoped he wouldn't. He then discovered the final page of the document, and began confronting Quackity not just about his underhandedness, but also about the location he discovered beneath the remains of the White House, Wilbur's TNT room.
  </p>
  <p key="6c7ed69f-df60-466b-af06-14b704c183b4">
   Tommy went to join Wilbur on top of the NASA building as things escalated, to the point that Quackity began to seem in serious trouble. Wilbur then shot him with an invisibility arrow, allowing him to escape. Quackity, along with Tommy, began running towards Pogtopia, only for Schlatt to follow after them. As they went, Schlatt began to taunt them, saying that Pogtopia was no longer the safe haven they believed it to be, and that he'd put the TNT that was beneath Manberg to good use.

  <p key="883946ef-f5ad-407f-b7db-fd4f5a2086c5">
   Tommy and Quackity didn't believe that to be true, before realizing that Wilbur was missing.

   Quackity and Tommy arrived in Pogtopia to find it griefed entirely in different colored buttons. The three concluded that it was Fundy who had placed them, and Quackity and Tommy worked to keep Wilbur from pressing the buttons. Wilbur said that he hadn't checked completely, but that the redstone connected to his TNT had been disconnected. He then reaffirmed his statement about Chekov's Gun, meaning that he still plans to blow it up.
  </p>
  <p key="55c21f28-8f8d-453a-9317-ee4ca287d020">
   Wilbur then decided to get in contact with Fundy, who happened to already be making his way to Pogtopia. Quackity and Tommy patronized Fundy, saying that they didn't want his help or anything to do with him, but Wilbur said to let him speak. Fundy then revealed the truth, that he was in no way loyal to Schlatt, and had been acting as a spy the entire time. He gave Wilbur and the other proof in the form of his Spy Diary, reading out a passage from Page 15, where he states classified information about Schlatt's health.
  </p>
  <p key="3d344d87-bdb6-45fc-8053-04a490f29c08">
   Surprised at the new information, Quackity asked what Fundy wanted with them, only to be interrupted by the arrival of BadBoyHalo, at whom the four began swearing to get him to go away. Wilbur then asked him back, as he began to realize something after Fundy's confession. Schlatt no longer had anyone on his side, he was completely alone, and with their powers combined, they could easily take him down in a war and reclaim their home.
  </p>
  <p key="a224c189-97c4-4e8f-9e80-58dc9eae84b4">
   Tommy then stated that they didn't have to blow it up, they could reclaim it, and make it theirs again. Quackity then agreed, saying that things could be like old times again, hopefully peaceful.

   Dream then came online, and contacted those in Pogtopia, saying that Schlatt had given him something. He then joined their voice call, saying that after Schlatt gave him the undetermined thing, he had an obligation to defend Manberg, and to an extent Schlatt. Though he was asked several times why, Dream never revealed the reason. Wilbur then proposed that the finish things in a gentlemen's manner, holding a specific date for the final conflict. They settled on November 16, 10 days from that date, for it to be held. Tommy then stated that they would need to start gearing up, and preparing for war, only for Dream to counter, saying that he'd be making similar preparations for Schlatt. Dream then stated that there was a traitor in their midst, one that they wouldn't expect, and one that would hurt more than Eret.

  <p key="e7fb369e-24de-4fcd-b1ae-3f02062587fa">
   The members of Pogtopia began accusing one another of being traitorous, with Wilbur asserting that he'd already made his loyalties clear, Fundy saying that he wouldn't have gone through with what he'd done if he wanted to betray them again, and Quackity and Tommy stating that they were too far into the game to go back. Wilbur stated that it was most likely Technoblade, which Dream didn't deny.

   Tommy then asked about his missing disc, Cat, and who actually had it. Tubbo said that it was in his ender chest, and a confused Dream asked Bad if he still had it, who then replied that he'd given it back to Skeppy. Dream asked Tubbo how he'd gotten it, who said he'd gotten it from Karl. Dream then said that Karl had a lot of discs, and there was a good chance that it wasn't the real one.

   Tommy then tried to blackmail Dream with the book he'd gotten from Ponk, and Dream stated that he didn't really care. Tubbo returned Tommy's discs after revealing being behind the floor trap that had killed Tommy earlier that day. Dream tried to take the fake discs, but Tommy managed to pick them up before him. Tommy then decided the burn the fake discs, to make sure there wasn't any confusion later, only for Dream to put out the fire and take both of them. After some conversation, Dream then said he'd ask Skeppy about whether or not he'd ever traded the disc.

   After annexing Rutabagville, Dream spread his Manbergian banners around the server, acting as propaganda to convince people to join Manberg's army. However, Tommy was able to destroy them so Dream gave up on spreading the banners, and instead went on to a more manipulative movement. Dream gave George a banner without George knowing what is was for and manipulated George to put the banner on his shield. After George put the banner on his shield, Dream happily said that he was now indoctrinated into the Manberg army. George seemed unscathed by his reaction. However, when Dream gave Awesamdude a banner, Sam hesitated and instead kept the banner for safekeeping instead of putting it on his shield.
