   felt that despite his power, no one in L'Manberg bothered to listen to him. To fix this, he and the vice-president,

   Quackity

   Prior to the debate, the POG2020 and SWAG2020 parties had already begun their campaigns.
   In POG2020, Wilbur and his running mate, Tommy, created a
   book of policies
   .
   Tubbo
   also switched to SWAG2020 briefly after realizing that POG2020's policies would ban
   Karl Jacobs
   from entering L'Manberg; however, this was short-lived, and Tubbo was one of POG2020's firmest supporters.

    Fundy
   </a>
   wished to break away from POG2020 and be Quackity's running mate, which Wilbur dismissed as his 'rebellious' phase. They created a wall of signs framing Quackity, their opposition, with pieces of tweets taken out of context. Quackity decried this as a smear campaign and after some arguing, challenged POG2020 to a debate, who accepted.

   and was a popular member of the server that could swing the election considerably. After initial disorganization and chaos on the way to the Sky Courthouse (including Wilbur punching George off the bridge to the Sky Courthouse claiming he tripped), both parties and some supporters on both sides gathered for the debate.
  </p>
  <p key="d4ec1b73-511a-4b41-89bf-16be2e9ee2e0">
   The parties had a brief moment to themselves. On POG2020's side, Tommy asked Wilbur to not murder the opposition. Wilbur maintained that he did not punch George. They wrote signs saying, "primarily, freedom, secondarily, likes". On SWAG2020's side, Quackity and George condemned POG2020's physical attacks on SWAG2020 members and reaffirmed their belief in their policies. When the parties got back together, Fundy said that he would run his own presidency, saying that he had a bakery and could deliver cookies and ice-cream to citizens of L'Manberg. When informed that the ballots had closed, he took SWAG2020's side, after Quackity promised him ten bakeries. They talked about endorsements, before beginning the debate.

   On POG2020's side, Wilbur was scared for Tommy, because George was a smart man, but nonetheless, put his full belief in Tommy's debating skills. On SWAG2020's side, Quackity told George he would have to match Tommy's energy to not look weak. He had also gotten a $2500 book from Sapnap some time back and thought that Wilbur gave it to him to drop out of the race, before finding out it came from Karl. George realised that Tommy may have bribed Karl with the book. Both parties came back together and Tommy and George took the podium.
