   Tom was whitelisted on July 9, 2021 onto the SMP, confusing everyone who was playing. While walking into the woods, he met
   Tommy
   and
   Tubbo
   . Upon being questioned as to why he was invited, Tom told the two that
   Dream
   whitelisted him because Dream thought it would be funny since he and Tommy shared similar real names. Dream had searched the phone book for someone with a similar name so he could add them to the SMP. He also shared many similar traits to Tommy. His voice was the same as Dream's leading them to believe that he was actually Dream impersonating as a new member of the server.
  </p>
  <p key="96444687-c10d-47e9-8238-b67843943c3c">
   After some conversation, the group walked to
   Tommy's house
   where Tom started stealing from. Tom said that his surname was Simmons, reminding Tommy of a traumatic name mix-up at a school awards ceremony. However, before he could finish the story, Tom walked out of the house. The three then started cleaning up under Tommy's house. Tommy asked Tom many questions about himself and Tom's answers were always similar to Tommy's answers.
  </p>
  <p key="c105dcc5-5f67-4f4c-a96a-b650ac00ece7">
   Tommy asked if Tom thought the
   <a href="Minecraft Manhunt (series).html" key="cf83a833-f78b-41b2-8ff2-95028d8b7cf9" title="Minecraft Manhunt (series)">
    Manhunts
   </a>
   were faked. To answer the question, Tom called his friend, Detective Dream who logged onto the SMP. Tubbo and Tommy immediately started interrogating him. He said that he was a real detective. Tubbo somehow concluded that he must have laser eyes and commanded him to use them on him. Tubbo was right as Detective Dream did have a laser eye monocle, using them to deform his face. Detective Dream then died after punching Tubbo's wolf. He whispered to Tommy that Tubbo was probably faking his face injury. He then left after Tommy asked for Tom. Tubbo then planned to kill Tom when he logged back in because Tommy said he should only have one "Tom" friend.
  </p>
  <p key="6a557320-be62-4159-85cf-91ce13e96bec">
   Tom heard about his plans, and logged back on as a man named John wearing a duck onesie to hide from Tubbo. After some time, he admitted that both John and Detective Dream were actually his disguises. Tubbo apologized for attempting to kill him. Tom then trapped Tommy and Tubbo under the house. After talking to each other, Tommy and Tubbo came out of the box and they all decided to move on from the incident. Tom helped them take down
   Karl's house
   and spent the rest of the stream talking to Tommy, Tubbo and
   Connor
   . Tubbo killed Tom for threatening to eat a god apple. They then joked that Tom had lost two canon lives already. The four then took turns doing stand-up comedy. At the end of the stream, Tom said that he would visit again.

   Tom logged on three days later on July 12 and met
   CaptainPuffy
   . Puffy welcomed him to the server, and after pointing out the massive
   beetroot farms
   , she asked him if he liked beets or potatoes. Tom said he liked potatoes, and Puffy immediately called him her favorite member of the SMP.
   Puffy then asked about Tom's least favorite member, and Tom said it was
   Ponk
   because his name sounded funny.
   Puffy then asked Tom about his opinion on
   Sapnap
   , George, and Dream. Tom answered with "pog," "sexy man," and "cool."
   After questioning Tom, Puffy punched him to see if he was in creative mode, which made him punch back and then run away into
   the sewer system
   .
   Puffy mistook the sewers for his home which made Tom swear angrily in chat and walk off.
   She then asked if he had a home, and after some rude dialogue, he said that
   Wilbur's Wooden Ball
   was his new home.
   After some more conversation, Tom left the server.

   After a few months, Tom logged on September 22 again to meet
   Karl
   and
   Foolish
   while they were building a nightclub for
   Kinoko Kingdom
   . After swearing and being mean to
   <a href="MichaelmcchillSMP.html" key="5a9239cb-8fba-47d4-b2aa-c37f71bb7f60" title="Michaelmcchill/SMP">
    Michael
   </a>
   at Karl's suggestion, the group talked about building the nightclub. They needed blackstone to finish the club, and Tom suggested mining it from
   Punz's house
   . While they were travelling through the nether, Karl was replacing a part of the path only for Tom to walk through the hole in the path and die from fall damage, losing all his items. They regrouped at Punz's house and mined his floors up.
  </p>
  <p key="3ce71afe-972a-4001-adf4-062a011963fc">
   Punz
   joined the server hearing of this, and the group decided to act as house remodelers. He immediately started attacking them, killing Tom twice despite their attempts at bluffing. The others combat-logged and made fun of him, but Punz trapped their log-out locations. After a few minutes, they gave up and returned his blackstone. The group then asked for some chains to decorate the club in return. Tom tried to insult Punz while Punz worked on crafting chains, but got his words mixed up so much that he just quit the game.

      Initially, Tommy thought that Tom was just Dream because of their voices and the fact that he had many of the same traits as Tommy. He also reacted negatively to Tom's full name, remembering it as a misspelling of his own name that was used in the past. Tom even tried to trap Tommy and Tubbo but let them go easily. He also attacked Tommy a couple of times when he was hungry, as well as later swear at him in whisper. When Puffy asked Tom about Tommy, Tom said "eh". Tom also said that he watched Tommy's streams, although this may not be canon.

      Tubbo and Tom got along decently well at the start, with Tubbo interested in the similarities between him and Tommy. Later on, during Tom's act as Detective Dream, Tom 'deformed' Tubbo's face with his laser eye and died to Tubbo's wolf. Tubbo planned to kill Tom, so Tom disguised himself as John. He later revealed his disguise and reason for it and Tubbo apologized. Tom tried to trap Tommy and Tubbo but let them go easily. Later on, Tubbo killed Tom when he threatened to eat a god apple.
