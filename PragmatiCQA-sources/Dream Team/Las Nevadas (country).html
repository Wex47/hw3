    Las Nevadas
   </b>
   is a nation created by
   Quackity
   . It was created at some point between January 23, 2021 (when Quackity partnered with
   Awesamdude
   to build it) and March 16, 2021 (the first time it is shown on-screen). It is meant to be an entertainment and gambling haven. At first, few people knew about its existence as Quackity rarely talked about it to anyone. However, as more citizens and employees joined, it became a well-known place with numerous players either visiting or starting conflicts with Las Nevadas.

   Las Nevadas is a massive terraformed area south of
   Eret's cobblestone pyramid
   and
   Snowchester
   . The area was once a lush forest close to spawn, but was terraformed to be similar to the real-world city of
   Las Vegas
   which is surrounded mostly by desert. Las Nevadas stretches from coast to coast and on the narrowest stretch of land between the two water masses.

   On January 23, 2021,
   Quackity
   visited
   Awesamdude
   while he was doing construction work on the
   Big Innit Hotel
   .
   Quackity said he was tired of the never-ending conflict on the server and that he needed a distraction. He talked about how he didn't have enough emeralds to buy from villagers. Sam said that he was planning to build a bank where anyone could trade valuables for cash vouchers backed up by the bank, essentially the beginnings of an economy, which Quackity got excited about.
  </p>
  <p key="95154dd6-2002-4777-913d-471bdfa15358">
   Quackity then said that he wanted to build an entertainment center to make money. While Sam provided the money from the bank, Quackity would provide the means to waste that money and together, they could have complete control of the server's economy and then, the server itself. They started talking about the possible future, of getting people addicted to gambling, making them take loans, sell their houses and their belongings, maybe even sell their best friends. Quackity started expressing his frustration about how no one listened to him and took his warnings about
   Dream

Purpled quickly noticed and nearly killed Quackity, but he threatened to blow up the UFO, which held Purpled off. He explained his reasons, and offered Purpled a mercenary job to attack the Eggpire at the Red Banquet. When Purpled asked about the money, Quackity said that he was making a new and prosperous country and offered to show it to him. Purpled agreed to take the job and went with Quackity to visit Las Nevadas.

He then gave Purpled an offer to join Las Nevadas and make a greater legacy. Purpled, still extremely angry, considered this offer and walked to the UFO without answering. Quackity, frustrated that Purpled wasn't listening, said that the offer would still be on the table before leaving.

Quackity expressed anger at this, saying that the joke wasn't funny, before telling Sam to proceed with the actual list of potential members. This likely means that the offer of citizenship to George, Sapnap, and Karl has closed, due to a mixture of anger at them for leaving him out of their country and wanting to keep them out of the difficulties Las Nevadas would face on its way.

   The first name on the list was
   Foolish
   . Quackity was interested in recruiting Foolish particularly after finding bits and pieces about his past, learning he was a great and feared warrior. Sam had read quite a bit about Foolish and said that Foolish had killed many people in a job gone wrong, according to his sources. Quackity said that none of their pasts' were clean either and they needed skilled warriors in case they met enemies like
   Technoblade
   . He told Sam that he would talk to Foolish.

  <p key="12abca01-d008-4df0-bb86-47c50ef19712">
   Quackity met Foolish at
   his summer house
   and asked him how he was doing after his canon death at the Red Banquet. He asked if Foolish was connected to any countries at the moment before pitching the idea of joining Las Nevadas. Foolish declined, saying that he liked to take a slow pace. Quackity revealed his knowledge of Foolish's past, but Foolish rejected his past beliefs and said that he was much happier now.
  </p>
  <p key="06c1bf0b-31ab-4f56-afaf-8a46968d9ebb">
   Quackity then said that Foolish's summer house was truly worth very little, because no one else used it or cared for it at all. It was an empty shell that would slowly erode away until there was nothing. Quackity said that it reminded him of Foolish, a once-feared and brave warrior, who now settled for having a bleak, mundane life wasting his talents by building things no one cared about. He then revealed that he had chosen not to save Foolish during the Red Banquet, hoping to change his mindset from his current one back to his former self. Foolish was enraged, shouting that his life was thrown away for a sales pitch. Quackity said that he too once believed in peace and had received nothing but suffering. He offered Foolish the deal again and walked out of his house.

  <p key="538f730c-818a-4257-a0b9-d050eb9e706a">
   Foolish gave himself a day to think. He wondered whether his death at the Red Banquet was necessary, as a wake-up call for him to change his ways. After some consideration, he decided to join the next day, but not to trust Quackity fully.

   One day, Quackity was, for an unknown reason, planning to blow up
   the restaurant
   in Las Nevadas when he saw a hole in the walls (he was wearing elytra throughout the scene, although it is unknown if the elytra is canon or just for cinematic effect). He broke through the walls, determined to kill whatever was living there, but found
   a person
   hiding there, seemingly spying on him. Before the person could speak properly, he knocked him out.

  <p key="4cbd7577-b20d-4e68-989c-0131a822093e">
   When the person woke up, Quackity started interrogating him, asking him who he was. The person asserted throughout the interrogation that he was definitely a real human being and "not a piece of goo that has crawled to the surface over hundreds of years, disguising myself as a person." Quackity asked him if he saw anything. The person said that he saw Quackity swoop into the restaurant and had heard some conversation of taking advantage of the human psyche through gambling addiction. He had also heard something about destroying a purple guy's UFO.
  </p>
  <p key="aac74927-62be-44a6-92a3-601d08aa40c1">
   Quackity said that he needed to kill him and apologized in advance. Quackity asked if he had seen anyone else. The person said that he had seen Foolish, full of regret. He had seen a green guy,
   a red-shirt-blond guy
   and
   a dead-but-not-anymore guy
   . Quackity realized that the person had accidentally become a very good spy. He then said that the interrogation was a method of welcoming him and took the person back to Las Nevadas, saying that he could give him a better home than a hole in the wall.

   that he used to wake up in before, this time as a mesa biome. He found Quackity standing outside his house. Quackity asked Fundy how he had been and to take a walk with him. While Fundy was completely confused, Quackity lead him to an area where the ruins of

   Fundy said that the place brought a mix of good and bad memories. Quackity said that those memories didn't matter and that Fundy himself had never really mattered. Quackity said that he now had big plans, and as a fellow L'Manberg cabinet member, he wanted to bring Fundy in on these plans. But he needed Fundy to join him. After a moment of indecision, Fundy decided to join Quackity and ran towards him just before he woke up. Confused, he checked outside his house just in time to see Quackity arriving.

   After two days, Fundy visited Las Nevadas again and talked to Quackity. Quackity said that Las Nevadas was necessary for himself, choosing a new path instead of wallowing in self-pity. He was fed up of feeling powerless, something Fundy related to. But, he didn't want Fundy to join until he worked on himself as a person and found his self-worth. Quackity then lead Fundy to a plot of land and told him to build himself a home and to leave his cottage in the past. Fundy agreed to visit again, thanked Quackity, and left.

Tommy said that Quackity had started a new country called 'Las Nevadas' but he hadn't seen it yet. They traveled there and were astonished at the scale of the builds. They met Quackity and Wilbur mistook the 'PROJECT NEVADAS' book for an invite to the country and accepted. However, Quackity said the book was not an invite and that Wilbur was too unpredictable to be made a citizen. Wilbur insisted that Quackity needed to let him join and that he had leadership experience, but Quackity refused.

   On June 18, Tubbo and Ranboo decided to expand Walltown and built a large wall in the direction of Las Nevadas. Quackity, accompanied by Foolish,

Quackity felt threatened by the outpost and demanded that the walls be taken down, but Tubbo argued that the outpost was outside of Las Nevadas territory, so Quackity had no right to ask this of them. Ranboo also acted defensive of the outpost, saying that they hadn't been violent or threatening to anyone as they were only selling cookies. Quackity's group began to build their own wall in front of the outpost, and Quackity said that he would take his wall down if Tubbo took down his own.

  <p key="e8c33b63-ec1a-4bdd-8f2f-68a8bbe6589b">
   Tubbo admitted that he didn't want to take down the walls because he had "noticed a pattern of his builds being destroyed" and wanted to protect the outpost. Quackity, meanwhile, wanted him to take the walls down because they were being built in the direction of Las Nevadas, which he saw as a threat. Tubbo called the outpost a "military outpost" when prompted by Quackity, although Ranboo was likely unaware that the outpost wasn't actually a cookie shop. Tubbo started to understand Quackity's perspective, but still didn't want to tear down the wall.

  <p key="9c44ff18-a622-409a-9ad9-34bcb007fc9c">
   Tubbo proposed using the nearby river as a territory marker, but Quackity refused, saying that he was going to cover the river and that he needed the space to expand Las Nevadas. Tubbo suggested he expand in the direction of Wilbur and Tommy's fort instead, but Quackity seemed hesitant to do so. He also refused to expand across the sea, as
   Eret's cobblestone pyramid
   was over the water and he didn't want to start a conflict with them. He also suggested that the outpost be turned into a Snowchester embassy, but Tubbo refused.

   On August 4, Wilbur and Ranboo met Quackity and showed him their burger van. Quackity thanked them for destroying parts of the restaurant as it gave him a chance to improve it. He had also hired Tubbo as the restaurant manager, saying that he was a brilliant employee. Wilbur was shocked by this, as Tubbo had denied his offer to work at Paradise. Tubbo himself did not know that Wilbur was selling burgers, but accepted it, saying it was part of the competition and that managing the restaurant had given him a new purpose. Both Quackity and Wilbur left the meeting visibly frustrated.

   Wilbur asked Ranboo how much he knew Tubbo and Quackity, and Ranboo lied that he didn't know Tubbo that well. Wilbur gave Ranboo TNT and asked him to secretly rig up the casino and the needle, going into an in-depth analysis of how Ranboo could rig the area, and offered to help him as well. He told him that this plan was to protect innocent people like Tubbo, Fundy and Slimecicle. He reaffirmed his trust in Ranboo before leaving.

   Quackity and Tubbo started talking about the restaurant. They eventually reached the topic of Walltown, and Tubbo apologized for the conflict, saying that he wasn't himself that day. On Quackity's suggestion, Tubbo allowed Las Nevadas to annex Walltown, signing a contract for the same. Tubbo talked to Ranboo afterward and told him about the annexation, which Ranboo was hurt about. Tubbo returned to Quackity and discussed about Wilbur destroying the restaurant and about future plans for the restaurant.

   On November 27, it was revealed that following Techno's escape from Pandora's Vault on September 14, Quackity returned to Las Nevadas and alerted Slime to contact everyone in the faction so that he could warn them Techno and Dream (who had not actually escaped at the time) had broken out of jail. Purpled then came up to Quackity and Slime and told them about a strange double-chest that was allegedly not placed by anyone from Las Nevadas next to the casino. When Quackity and Slime went to investigate it, Purpled pulled a lever that caused the two to fall onto an underground platform suspended over lava, hidden under the sands of Las Nevadas.

   Purpled then confronted Quackity over the destruction of his UFO and demanded the tome of resurrection from him, to which Quackity refused to give, not that he had the knowledge contained in the book to begin with. Purpled responded by knocking Slime into the lava beneath the platform, and as Slime lost his first canon life and returned to a dormant state, Purpled escaped from the pit trap through a hidden passageway while Quackity fell into grief.

   During the weeks following Purpled's betrayal, Quackity spent almost all of his time holed up in his library in The Needle researching slimes and documenting his and Slime/Charlie's shared memories in an attempt to help Slime/Charlie regain sentience, while Foolish stepped up to help Quackity in his quest
   and constructed the Las Nevadas bunker, which was based on the map of The Skeld from
