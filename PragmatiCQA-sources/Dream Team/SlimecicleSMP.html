   Charlie appears as a human with light skin, neon green eyes, and light brown hair. He wears a white shirt with 3 red lines on it (referencing "Yeah, I'm a Gamer" merch) and light blue pants. He has slime on his head and shoulder from his iconic Slimecicle character. He also wears a pair of glasses with eyes printed on them and a sash on his waist (a reference to his DND character,
   Br'aad
   , who can be found wearing the same sash).

   When he first joined the server, he had not fully written his character. As a result, several statements he made are no longer considered canon.
  </p>
  <p key="e7102b8e-fe12-42ab-8f48-36ef5e518f5c">
   After a long hiatus, Slimecicle returned to the server, where it was revealed that he was completely made of slime and was only pretending to be human. As a slime, he has no bones and can squeeze into small spaces. He also cannot close his eyes, and has described that "everything is a membrane". Slimes are also seemingly capable of disguising as other objects, such as fauna, flora, and blocks, and changing their appearances. He may also be very old as he implied that it took hundreds of years to take human form. Quackity has officially confirmed that Slime is over millions of years old.
  </p>
  <p key="445afd09-f720-4a32-b65f-5ab7e6bc065a">
   It is confirmed that his clothes are made of slime when he changed them to match the Las Nevadas official outfit, saying he "goopmorphisized" and claiming his clothes could not crease because it was "all goop". In this same video, Slimecicle says he sees in full panoramic vision.
   It is noted that Slime reacts strangely to water, claiming that he must keep himself hydrated. Enough water could hypothetically make him expand and grow to massive sizes.
  </p>
  <p key="8a0eea7c-f25c-4aa0-9797-ec11999157db">
   Slimecicle is constantly coughing and expelling slime, which if consumed in small numbers allows him to access their senses as seen in Fundy. If someone takes part of his slime, as Tommy did to kidnap him, he is forced to follow to retrieve his slime and become whole again, in a similar fashion to a magnet. His body itself is extremely malleable, allowing him to move through small spaces and go through doors.
  </p>
  <p key="64c0ae48-1af8-4567-87a4-49c912b37d50">
   When he died, he seemed to enter a completely dormant state, covered in slime. It's implied he cannot react to the outside world and that he doesn't remember anything in this state, though this remains unconfirmed. During this dormant state, he wrote in a book and left, which could mean he still retained some autonomy despite being asleep.

  <p key="769f9613-5ce1-4254-aa08-683084afcb16">
   Slime is generally unaware of human social cues, and can come across as naive as a result. It’s difficult to take what he says seriously because of his generally playful and fun nature. He believes everything anyone tells him, unless they are contradictory to each other's statements.
  </p>
  <p key="7e1550e9-b738-45ad-a10d-fb3650324e8a">
   Slime also likes to refer to people in a specific way, saying their full name and often where they're from whenever he addresses someone. For example,
   Quackity
   is "Quackity from Las Nevadas."
  </p>
  <p key="5fa80396-6f36-400a-beaa-81ff41f73212">
   Slime also has a nihilistic side, wherein he may sometimes mention the death of the universe, and the inevitability of death for everyone.
  </p>
  <p key="0c045528-8bee-45a9-8fab-5b348f9f2d04">
   During Lessons from Quackity, over the course of the stream he began to get quieter and more timid, showing a more introspective side and speaking calmly about the horrors he'd seen. By the end of it, his outward personality had changed entirely, leaving him more human-like and afraid similar to Quackity.

   Slimecicle's character is a piece of slime that has presumably spent most of his life in the ground, developing into a sentient being with human-like features over millions of years of growth. Even before he officially joined the server, it is heavily implied that he was observing people and events on the SMP without anyone knowing he even existed, until finally being discovered by
   Quackity

   Slime wakes up in a hole (This is the cause for Slimecicle entering holes whenever he meets new people, Large groups of fans call these greeting holes) and Quackity begins to question him on what he had seen while in the restaurant. He reveals that he overheard a conversation about a purple guy (
   Purpled
   ), two green guys (
   Awesamdude
   and
   Dream
   ), a guy with a red shirt (
   TommyInnit
   ), and a guy who was dead but isn't anymore (
   Wilbur
   ). Quackity threatens to kill Slime for knowing too much, but quickly changes his mind after realizing that Slime is an accidental spy and could be useful to Las Nevadas. Slime appeared unfazed by this incident, eagerly accepting Quackity's offer of friendship. Quackity gives Slime both a job and a new name (Guy), and the two later call each other best friends.

   On May 27, 2021,
   Quackity
   introduced Slime to Las Nevadas, and tried to teach him concepts like gambling and self-defense. He explained that gambling was only good for them if other people did it. He then brought Slime to a finished machine in the wall of the casino, and tried to teach him about it. He gave Slime some diamonds to spend on it, but Slime eventually wasted them all, because he got addicted to gambling, as well as spinning around and pressing the button and the machine's lights and sounds. Quackity dragged him away and was trying to teach him how to eat when
   Connor
   arrived there. Quackity had to restrain Slime from attacking Connor in accordance with his self-defense lesson. Quackity then showed Connor the machine and gave him some money to use. Connor wasted the money and asked for more, prompting Quackity to give both Slime and Connor loans, but they wasted that money too. Connor expressed his desire to stop gambling at one point, but Quackity told Slime to keep Connor from leaving by threatening him with a diamond sword that Quackity provided for him.

   After Connor left, Quackity gave Slime some diamonds he could use to "purchase" the diamond sword for himself, and used the opportunity to teach Slime how purchases work. Quackity then explained to Slime that he was in debt to the casino because of all the loans Quackity had provided. When Slime asked how one goes about paying off a loan, Quackity gave Slime a job he could do for him to erase his debt - spy on a purple guy (
   Purpled
   ) who, according to Quackity, tried the machine and got angry enough to attack him, and storm out of the casino. Quackity then provided Slime with a bed in his home before leaving Slime to sleep.

   Quackity streamed on November 27th, 2021. The stream began with Quackity speaking with Charlie, discussing how he was leaving for the prison a few weeks later. He told Charlie that he could die, making him upset. Quackity compared Charlie to a younger version of himself, claiming that the only reason he could trust Charlie was because he knew very little. He promised to rear Charlie into being his apprentice, and promising that when Quackity died, he would take his place. Charlie was taught many lessons, over time learning about Quackity and his trials and tribulations in the SMP. He learned about every betrayal, and over time began to sound more and more human. They grew close, sharing quiet moments and bonding over time until Quackity left for the prison. Quackity claimed that Charlie was his closest and longest friend. During this, we also learn that Charlie has his own room.

   When Quackity returned, Charlie was quickly ushered to Las Nevadas in a panic. It was revealed that he had taken on Quackity's face scar. They came across Purpled, and after a short shouting match, Purpled lead them to a chest. Charlie checked inside the chest and found nothing, only to turn around and see Purpled with a lever. The ground fell beneath them and they fell into a cobblestone room with lava underneath, Purpled demanding for the revival book while Slime hid in a corner, telling Quackity that Purpled was "trying to help, but [he] didn't realize". After a small altercation, Purpled pearled to Charlie and pushed him into the lava. Quackity jumped in after him as Charlie died, thanking Quackity for showing him what it was like to be human before dying. Quackity called after Purpled in tears, making Charlie lose his supposed first canon life.

   The stream cuts to weeks later, with a disheveled Quackity holding a book and entering the hole he had trapped Charlie in when they first met. He falls into a small room and approaches a green, dormant Slime. He tells Slime that he's been writing everything about their friendship in books and journals and leaving them in chests in hopes that Slime would read them and remember. Quackity says that Slime needs a name, and he decides to name him as he's more than just slime. He's named Charlie, and Quackity continues to speak to Charlie. He says that he hopes that he can hear Charlie talk and joke one day, and checks inside the chest and finds a strange, new book. At first, it's seemingly full of gibberish that Charlie wrote. Quackity is ecstatic to see that Charlie is alive, and runs off to decode it.

      to spy on him. Purpled was angry about this, asking why he was spying on Purpled, but Slime tried to distract Purpled by saying Purpled was the one spying. Purpled expressed distaste for Slime, refusing to dap him up. He would ask Slime for directions to

      , where they somewhat got along.

       This changed in Quackity's stream on November 27, Purpled pushed Slimecicle into lava, so it is assumed he is negative towards him.

      After spying for years hidden as a piece of slime in the restaurant, Slime was seen by Quackity, who was in the midst of attempting to blow the place up. Quackity decided to hold him hostage and forced Slime to tell him who he was and what he had heard in the restaurant, or he would kill him. Slime then revealed that he was really just a mutated piece of slime, and had been hiding in places around the server for years, watching and observing its inhabitants. He also told Quackity that he knows information about
      Foolish
      and his regrets, about a purple guy (
      Purpled
      ), two green guys (
      Awesamdude
      and
      Dream
      ), a guy with a red shirt (
      TommyInnit
      ), and a "sooty" guy who was dead but isn't anymore (
      Wilbur
      ). After finding out that Slime knows so much, Quackity realized he now has an accidental spy and seizes the opportunity to "hire" Slime, later calling him his assistant to
      ConnorEatsPants
      . Slime and Quackity's relationship is friendly, somewhat due to the fact that Slime has only ever spoken to a few people.  Quackity refers to Slime as his best friend and the closest person to him on the server. Slime later returns the sentiment, once he actually knew what a friend is.
      <p key="4ee82bfe-aa19-4e97-9380-65ebb2ead7c3">
       Quackity later takes Slimecicle under his wing and raises him as an heir when he dies, teaching him lessons on being human. Quackity tells Slimecicle that he'd never had a positive relationship last this long, and that he was special.

       When Purpled throws Slimecicle into lava, Quackity jumps in an attempt to save Slimecicle from burning. Slimecicle refuses, thanking Quackity for teaching him how to be a human, and dies, reappearing in a dormant state. He spends hours in his library researching on slimes in an attempt to awaken Slimecicle, and writes journals to help him remember things. Quackity also named him Charlie, showing how much he truly cared for the slime.

      and
      Quackity
      's territorial dispute regarding Tubbo's outpost, and the two ended up interacting after Ranboo heard an explosion from outside the outpost's walls and went to investigate. During their interaction, Slime became confused after Ranboo expressed that he isn't human, and assumed this meant Ranboo was also made of slime. He admitted that he too was a slime only pretending to be human, and started calling Ranboo "brother" and dubbing him "Rangoo." With this newfound bond, Ranboo attempted to teach Slime how friendship works, telling him that friends don't force each other to do things that they don't want to do, and that people can give each other gifts for nothing in return. Slime dug himself into the ground to "process" what Ranboo told him, and reemerged a couple of minutes later saying that he thinks he understands. Either way, he showed appreciation for what Ranboo taught him, and even after Ranboo told him he is, in fact, not also made of slime, he still seems to trust him.

      Foolish
      , Tommy took Slime hostage, stealing 33% of his body mass (his "controlling goop" as Slime calls it) and trapping him in a pit in Fort Big. Slime himself didn't seem to dislike Tommy for this, and seemed to enjoy his role as a prisoner, not fully understanding what it meant. Tommy thought, after learning from Slime himself that Slime was observing him while he was in exile, seemed to hold contempt towards Slime for not helping him during that time. Despite this Slime liked Tommy, and holds no ill will against him.
