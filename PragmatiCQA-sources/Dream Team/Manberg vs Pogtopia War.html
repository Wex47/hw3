   After obtaining netherite, Quackity called it a day and the two went back to the Overworld and entered the public spider grinder and enchantment area. Due to Quackity's inexperience with Minecraft, Bad had to teach Quackity about enchantments and levels. At the end of the stream, Quackity obtained half enchanted netherite armor, a netherite sword, and half enchanted diamond armor. However, Quackity lost the armor the next day after dying whilst AFK.

   Tubbo stated that he wanted to use a TNT duplicator to bomb out a massive area, but TNT duplication was patched in a recent update of Minecraft, so they couldn't use that. Sam then said that he had a large cache of TNT and gunpowder, so they could use that to destroy the underground. Using this method, the two found a large amount of diamonds, gold, iron, and a single emerald ore underground. Using a silk touch pickaxe, Tubbo mined the diamonds so they could bring the diamonds back to Sam's base and use a fortune pickaxe there. Once arriving at the base, the two used the fortune pickaxe and obtained 114 diamonds. Splitting them between each other into two groups of 57, the two agreed to go mine for ancient debris.

   Arriving at the public spider grinder, the two used profits from the grinder to make beds for mining. After they obtained enough wood and wool, the two headed back into the Nether to grind for netherite. After a while, Tubbo obtained sixteen ancient debris and Sam had achieved enough to make a full set of netherite armor. Tubbo logged off for the day with his goals complete. Sam continued to grind, obtaining stacks of iron, gold, lapis, and redstone. While mining, he had also found two zombie spawners and a mineshaft that contained several spider spawners as well as chests with golden apples and name tags. Sam turned the zombie spawner into the second spawner mob farm on the server, and shares with Tubbo and Ponk.

Tommy rushed Sapnap hoping to earn a quick victory, but he failed to land critical hits and found himself on one heart with Sapnap at almost max.

However, it did minimal damage to Eret, dealing only a tenth of his health and a smaller amount of damage to his armor. Tubbo, on the day before the war, armed his own crossbows.
