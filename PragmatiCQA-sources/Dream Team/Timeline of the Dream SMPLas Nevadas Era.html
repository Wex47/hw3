    Ranboo returns to the "table" he discovered the day before to set up a lab for experiments.

      Ranboo gets iron block and string from his base. He then crafts bows for dispensers. Ranboo trades for glass at Techno's base, crafts a dispenser, and retrieves his experiments log titled in an enderman language from a hidden chest.

     <li key="0a643b03-6402-442b-a172-6c566631668b">
      Ranboo gets his trident to fly out, and before setting off, he notices a letter from Foolish asking Ranboo if he can ask other endermen to stop littering over the summer home. Ranboo returns to his base and shows his latest page in his memory book. He gets his shovel, brewing stands, and glass bottles from his base before heading to the table.
     </li>
     <li key="4b956654-0763-4c89-8de5-fbd3e62335a1">
      On the journey, Ranboo talks about how the table "feels different" from the one in the Syndicate room; it resonates with his enderman side. He also reiterates how he feels that the enderwalk is no longer as bad as he initially thought and hopes that the experiments can also potentially help him remember more.
     </li>
     <li key="e6387520-ba47-431b-a94c-2af17f865c74">
      Ranboo arrives at the table and swaps the floors and most of the walls of the room with iron blocks, which he says are more stable. He sets up several brewing stands and a three-high water column in the corner. Ranboo then fills empty bottles with water and places them in the stands. He then mines nearby redstone and sets up a dispenser rigged to shoot arrows at the controller. The dispenser contraption faces towards the water column.
     </li>
     <li key="f63893ce-0a66-4de0-91c2-c1dc8307a7c6">
      Ranboo explains the theory behind the experiment: Endermen naturally can't be damaged by arrows so he might have the ability to dodge arrows when near the table.
     </li>
     <li key="2ef6cdea-f5a2-4684-8c18-18fb0d10c0d4">
      Before proceeding with the experiment, Ranboo notices the eye of ender within the table again and wonders what it can mean. He goes on and explains that his past experiments are no longer insightful, but experiments done at this new table can push his understanding of himself further.
     </li>
     <li key="4fb4551f-2b66-4aa9-a3b3-5703c9458ae9">
      Ranboo retrieves a chest from the stronghold and places items within the chest before lighting up the area. He then hesitates and explains that he's become more understanding and positive towards the enderwalk. He explains his current theory: The enderwalk is still Ranboo, but with all of the memories he's lost.
     </li>
     <li key="f34475a2-c17b-4749-9e26-89e96ed2627b">
      Ranboo asks if it's better to live safely in ignorance or to risk his safety to find the truth. He doesn't trust the enderwalk entirely and fears what can happen afterward. He shows the first of forty-three pages of his
      experiment log
      , focusing on the last of three points: to remember. He then places the log back in the chest and reveals that one of those pages gives "the solution." However, Ranboo is unsure as to what it can do.
     </li>
     <li key="20defd6f-ce32-4751-ae59-2f17c5cbcfdb">
      Ranboo admits to his particles that the experiment setup is a deception; the dispenser was designed to knock him back into the water column, which would trigger the enderwalk state and hopefully provide "the solution", but also not knowing what the outcome would be.
     </li>
     <li key="beee4a20-09d5-4e02-a893-a085d0d63931">
      Ranboo decides that the experiment is too dangerous as is. He then decides to return home, enclosing the room behind him and leaving the setup as the last resort if something bad happens.

Techno adds that he feels he is not being valued as a prisoner. Dream tells Techno he's been storing potatoes and hands Techno a couple. Dream interjects that he was being tortured to which Techno tells Dream he can't relate, exclaiming he is the favorite prisoner as a reason.

Dream explains Quackity's motive of trying to get the details of the revive book. Techno switches Dream's attention to the revive book and asks how it works. Dream explains that he has the knowledge and that he gets a book which he burns to bring people back to life.

Dream is hesitant about the plan even after Techno mentions having it as some sort of insurance and escape plan. Dream remains hesitant about giving Techno the knowledge, and Techno claims that Dream forgot how to write it down. Dream, however, reclaims that he does have it written down, but refuses to give it to Techno. Techno tells Dream that all he hears is a lot of excuses, and Dream likens the argument to the one about
      his house
      . Techno tells Dream that he has a house now by being in prison. Dream agrees and explains that he lives in the prison rent free other than being tortured every day. Techno likens the torture to Californian house prices.

Dream then guesses that there is then an elder guardian underneath the cell if they break the block. Techno suggests attacking the guardian with his bare hands with Dream continuously bringing him back to life if he dies beating it up.
