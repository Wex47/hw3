   Niki attempted to convince Tubbo to officially join the rebellion after conversing with HBomb and touring him around the server. It appeared that while Tubbo was interested, but was reluctant to commit to the cause due to the fact that he didn't want to betray Schlatt's trust completely.

   Wilbur and Techno began working more on excavating Pogtopia, during which Wilbur inquired about a chest Techno had covered with dirt. He claimed it was a gift from "god" to be given to Tommy when he arrived.

   Tubbo began building

   Schlatt joined and began asking Tubbo questions about where he'd been, and to come back to Manberg to assist him. Schlatt said that he'd take things down inside the L'Manberg eventually, starting with the "elton john house" and ending with the Camarvan.

   While in Manberg, they found that Fundy was rebuilding the flag, now with a new purple design. Wilbur, disgusted by what his son had done, ordered Techno to shoot Fundy off of the flag. Techno nearly got caught by Schlatt while in Manberg, until Tommy suddenly joined the server out of nowhere, and distracted everyone as he threatened to burn down Manberg. Wilbur told Tommy to show restraint, for now.
  </p>
  <p key="c29e4255-5c06-4fea-8b94-ac049e9dce8e">
   As Wilbur and Techno returned home, Fundy and Schlatt then began talking, and Fundy wholly rejected Wilbur as his father. Schlatt then promoted Fundy to Viceroy Chairman of Manberg. Immediately after, Wilbur told Tommy to burn everything to the ground, but leave Fundy alive. Tommy burned down the flag on his orders, but the fire was immediately put out by Fundy. Tommy then burnt down a nearby forest, which had been one of the things in Schlatt's to-do list. Wilbur berated him for doing so, and Tommy left abruptly in shame.

   In order to try and win back some of Wilbur's favor, Tubbo filled him in on Quackity growing independence from Schlatt, as in the words of Tubbo, "Quackity's sick of having a fat ass". He no longer wanted to be seen as an object, and simply wanted to be appreciated.

However, Niki and Tubbo were completely unaware, and still believe that Fundy was on Schlatt's side.

Dream also told Tommy that Schlatt is no Wilbur, as Wilbur ruled with peace and kindness, and Schlatt does not follow the same principles. However, due to Schlatt technically being a democratically elected leader, Dream can't get involved directly, as it would break the peace treaty between the Dream Team and Manberg, which is why he has been continuously stating that he must help from the shadows. Nevertheless, Dream stated that Schlatt must be overthrown.

Suddenly, Techno killed Ant, claiming that Ant was going to go through their base to expose where it was. Tommy protested, saying that Ant was their only good worker.

   After winning the battle, Tommy made everyone promise not to tell Schlatt, as Schlatt would mobilize his only men and begin to assault the Pogtopian base.

   Tommy decided to extend
   The Underground Prime Path
   underground into Pogtopia in order to expand his money making schemes. While on his way to build, Quackity found out about the fact that the tunnel lead all the way from Pogtopia to Manberg, and threatened to tell Schlatt. Tommy tried to give him drugs to keep him quiet, but Schlatt found it anyway.

   Wilbur and Tubbo attempted to close up the path that diverted to Pogtopia, angering Tommy, who said that they were griefing his money making scheme. In a moment of heated anger, Wilbur told Tommy that "he wasn't the president, and that he would never be the president", causing Tommy to shut down at the insult and leave the two of them alone.

   Eventually, Schlatt logged on and began touring around Manberg, collecting his supporters. He ended up finding the bunker beneath Manberg, which Tubbo tried to cover up, saying that it was something he'd built for Schlatt personally.
