    Hours before the festival is set to begin, Bad, Ponk, Punz and Awesamdude further expand the old underground Dreamon Hunter base near the XP farm. Awesamdude places a haste beacon in the room to help them mine out the area faster.
   </li>
   <li key="74e04237-f717-4da7-a849-dfebbd9b0436">
    Techno meets up with Awesamdude to collect sugar cane from his secret mountain base. In preparation for the festival, Techno arms himself with new weapons: a multi-shot firework crossbow, a netherite sword and a riptide trident. He flies with the trident for the first time, during rainy weather.

    Tubbo moves his dog army from the center of Manberg to his boat dock in order to protect them.

   <li key="0b02b4b4-4d5d-4a4b-884e-525319b58125">
    Ponk sets up "festival tokens" in chests for all of the attendees to collect.

   <li key="1b76cfc7-0d19-4865-8326-d17855a408d8">
    Schlatt joins and praises Tubbo for his efforts in preparing the event. Tubbo shows him around the festival venue and they meet with Quackity on the newly designed electoral podium.
   </li>
   <li key="7ef78577-4e2c-4baf-ad55-3dec963c2f5f">
    The other festival guests meet up and try Ponk's Dunk Tank mini-game and then visit his flower shop. Quackity summons them in game chat and they all take their seats in front of the podium.
   </li>
   <li key="6acc7788-5531-4046-8b59-7bbe75aae814">
    After a speech from Schlatt, who stood atop the electoral podium with Quackity and Tubbo, the group of attendees went to Party Island to enjoy the festivities. During this, Tubbo sneaks away from the festivities to meet with Tommy and Wilbur.
    <ul key="11072493-7b9a-4763-bf53-4d88343c0261">
     <li key="ee67d9f8-15a2-4532-a46f-b8f664fc6571">
      Quackity, who was suspicious of Tubbo, began to follow him away from the party but was ultimately distracted by Schlatt entertaining the crowd. Moments later, when Quackity went to where he'd last seen Tubbo, nobody was there.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="afbceb15-910f-40c0-8114-8fe69fd006a4">
    Wilbur, after seeing how happy his friends are, begins to have second thoughts about blowing up L'Manberg. He tells Tubbo to meet with him and Tommy before his speech where Wilbur ultimately puts the decision to blow up L'Manberg in Tubbo's hands.
    <ul key="a989e5d7-35f4-4eee-acf6-0d097ea26284">
     <li key="f3ab786a-fdb3-499e-852f-d65b8543c684">
      However, seeing that he and Tommy had chests for them among the others and finding that they had given them trash, Wilbur solidifies his decision to blow up L'Manberg, further believing that Tubbo isn't with them as he was the event organizer.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="c07e47cd-8da8-484a-93ab-3b0b8a3c3f43">
    When Quackity returned to the crowd, he asked Schlatt if he'd seen Tubbo recently. Just as Quackity asked though, Tubbo came running back from the L'Manberg Flight and Aeronautical Organization building where Wilbur and Tommy had been hiding.
    <ul key="6e7c89b8-719f-43bc-9f56-a665383305c0">
     <li key="a66d4203-a799-4cc6-8238-8b96354e1fc5">
      Schlatt and Quackity questioned Tubbo as to where he had been, though the three of them were quickly distracted by a boxing match between Techno and Fundy that was about to begin.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="5d3459f9-788c-4bc8-b810-3564e3ab305b">
    Techno quickly won his boxing match against Fundy after secretly drinking a strength potion. After them, Tubbo and Awesamdude boxed, which Tubbo won. Tubbo then faced Quackity in a match, which Tubbo won. Later, Schlatt boxed Fundy, though it proved to be an unfair fight as Schlatt kept his armor on and shot Fundy with arrows.
   </li>
   <li key="f95949fd-24fe-4d1f-a604-496e80d1b012">
    The group then returned to the podium for Tubbo's speech. As Tubbo concluded his speech, Schlatt slowly began to laugh. Schlatt asked Tubbo if he had anything else to add to his speech. Tubbo responded with "Let the festival begin", which also happened to be the codeword for Wilbur to blow up the festival.
    <ul key="e6e4de2b-5d51-4b2d-a6d2-ecfe72fca0da">
     <li key="a4cb263b-eff0-472c-b025-38764c04b96a">
      Schlatt then gave Quackity blocks to enclose Tubbo in concrete where he stood. As the two of them enclosed Tubbo, Schlatt revealed that he knew Tubbo was working with Wilbur and Tommy.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="7af0d0bf-b1f2-4ab8-9643-30014183a4ce">
    Schlatt then asked Technoblade to come up to the podium, and asked Techno to kill Tubbo. Niki and Fundy both spoke out against Schlatt's command, but both were ultimately ignored. Techno apologized to Tubbo, then shot him with a firework fired from his multi-shot crossbow, which subsequently killed both Quackity and Schlatt as well.
    <ul key="99daa189-3706-4955-960d-c01a17300483">
     <li key="57b91b2f-2f7d-41e3-b4a2-ca711d1956b0">
      Techno then turned to face the crowd and fired at them multiple times. This event would come to be known as the Manberg Massacre. Altogether, Techno killed eight people, including Schlatt twice. After murdering the crowd, he quickly fled the scene. As the chaos began, Tommy and Wilbur jumped down from the roof of the nearby building. Tommy instantly targeted a recently respawned Quackity and killed him on the podium.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="dd0e2889-ff79-4d77-8b41-405d46b70611">
    Wilbur ran for the button that would ignite the explosives rigged under the festival; the button was supposed to be hidden on a hill behind the podium. Wilbur desperately searched for it, but it was too late, the Manbergians had rallied themselves and were now hunting Tommy.
    <ul key="82832917-119c-4b8f-bb91-f7a7bec9734f">
     <li key="d4f45fb1-d60c-4553-afb6-e09bf9a91cc4">
      Purpled quickly killed Tommy, and with Techno gone, Wilbur retreated to Niki's bakery in search of materials for a flint and steel. He returned to the podium only to find Schlatt, Quackity and a newly promoted Fundy standing atop it, staring down at a crying Niki, with various crowd members behind her.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="96bfbf2d-6eb1-4fec-91ad-d47b71458e74">
    In a rage of broken emotions, Niki told Schlatt that she didn't even want to be in Manberg and was a spy like Tubbo. In response to this, Schlatt told her to leave or be executed. Wilbur then walked up from behind Niki, and stood next to her as they stared back up at Schlatt. Calmly, Wilbur marveled at Schlatt's murder of Tubbo, in return, Schlatt taunted Wilbur about allowing Techno to take the shot.
    <ul key="bef0c733-7f52-46ee-8289-4e4c0b229f89">
     <li key="8fb63eef-db60-44db-9259-489f1061ca78">
      Purpled quickly intercepted Wilbur's approach to the podium, only to be blocked by Technoblade who stood with shield at the ready to protect Wilbur.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="cc1e1344-3afa-4a24-8a39-29c5df9a304c">
    Wilbur then told Schlatt that if he were to kill anyone else, he should kill Wilbur, nobody else. Schlatt only laughed in his face, claiming he wasn't a bad guy and wouldn't kill anyone. Upon hearing this, Techno began questioning Schlatt's word and mentioned a verbal contract he'd had with him. A contract which was unknown to Tommy and Wilbur.
   </li>
   <li key="50437cd9-8d05-4be2-8625-6d1b69255b9a">
    Tommy joined the call and questioned Techno about this contract, Techno simply responded that he was trying to protect Wilbur. As the conversation escalated, Wilbur turned to Niki, and told her to run. As she ran, Wilbur and Techno began attacking the remaining crowd members and the two retreated towards Tubbo's Dock.
   </li>
   <li key="3f0979b9-d697-4429-a2f7-b14f3cde8992">
    Niki ran from Manberg, towards Tommy's old base, with Ponk following close behind. Neither of them had armor, but Ponk was determined. Niki then found herself running down the
    Prime Path
    as she tried desperately to evade her pursuer, but she didn't last much longer. Ponk soon killed her with a torch, only to be slain by Tommy.
   </li>
   <li key="715d0e22-4621-4630-8bff-bb28f57062cd">
    As Wilbur and Techno reached their destination they were separated, with Wilbur diving into the ocean and swimming along the shore towards Pogtopia. Techno stood on the dock where he'd last seen Wilbur, he found himself staring down Purpled, who decided not to attack Techno, and retreated towards the podium.
    <ul key="e586191d-e8a0-44d6-a09d-4218eee52062">
     <li key="991c7f24-88d5-45b5-b704-394fcf93c5cb">
      Niki soon began to make her way through the Manbergian backwoods towards Pogtopia, she looked back at the towers and buildings along the border of the country, then headed in the direction of her friends. She overheard a conversation between Fundy and Schlatt, where Schlatt insulted her. He then asked Fundy what he thought of Niki, and Fundy said she was a traitor, angering her greatly.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="2d1222ec-4c22-497a-9d9d-e84043e50f9b">
    Meanwhile in Manberg, Quackity, Schlatt, and Fundy meet in the White House and Fundy exclaims that the festival has been ruined. Schlatt reveals that he doesn’t care what happens to the festival since Tubbo, a traitor, had planned it.
    <ul key="253e7fa8-5018-47ee-9566-d49d02408160">
     <li key="c3703a7f-802c-45c2-a641-78ed7f5b1596">
      Schlatt also reveals that he discovered Pogtopia via Tubbo's tunnel and knew of his intentions from the start. Quackity continues to question his loyalty to Schlatt after witnessing Tubbo's execution.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="e5add8d3-5f4f-470e-a976-16eeafc35253">
    The trio then reconvene with the remaining festival attendees at the dunk tank. Schlatt sacrifices a cat offered by Ponk which disgusts Fundy, Awesamdude, BadBoyHalo, and Antfrost.
   </li>
   <li key="fd118625-01f6-4c4d-abe5-ba056dd0d431">
    Schlatt reinforces his idea to take down the "ugly"
    Camarvan
    and replace it with an apartment complex called the "Manberg Hotel". He also makes plans to build a freedom statue on the election podium. Quackity and Fundy advise Schlatt against taking down the Camarvan and try to find alternative options that can satisfy him.
    <ul key="ac372d22-0341-4557-8f7c-31fac9a205a0">
     <li key="6b586100-9f89-4ede-a887-126febcbb502">
      BadBoyHalo tells Schlatt not to destroy the Camarvan due to its historical importance. Schlatt then attempts to murder Antfrost, and Bad defends him. Schlatt is killed by Awesamdude multiple times, aiding in their escape.
     </li>
     <li key="605fdd79-e81a-416e-aed9-548d660842a4">
      Schlatt also plans to take down the original White House which Quackity strongly disagrees with as he helped build it during a time of peace.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="c4081d08-f012-42bc-92c9-2ef2b3279bf5">
    As Wilbur escaped Manberg territory, he joined a call with Tommy and Tubbo who both questioned him as to why Techno had betrayed them by killing Tubbo, but Wilbur didn't have answers for them. So, they decided the best course of action would be to reunite at Pogtopia.
    <ul key="dd094958-2a8b-45d1-bbc2-8fd45edde797">
     <li key="62a7428b-80a2-42b1-9016-4ac4e140c98a">
      As Tommy, Tubbo, Wilbur, and Techno reunite at Pogtopia, tensions began to rise. While Wilbur and Techno wanted chaos and destruction, Tommy and Tubbo just wanted their home back, and Niki only wanted her family back.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="944dcb99-22ff-44ea-9d0f-aac69e31cd3d">
    Niki arrived at Pogtopia with the help of Wilbur, only to find things getting heated between Tommy and Techno. To simultaneously ease and worsen tensions, Wilbur decided to make a Combat Pit for Tommy and Techno to duel in.
    <ul key="e34309b4-adf3-43ec-82a6-4efee6823918">
     <li key="6f4b19b5-265d-46ce-902e-95fe0d8852d8">
      In reaction to this, Niki privately asked Tommy if Wilbur was ok, as she was worried about him. Tommy replied that Wilbur had gone insane, and that he'd planned to blow up Manberg. Their conversation was cut short by Wilbur telling Tommy and Techno to enter the pit, and duel to the death.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="5796d436-8d77-4d74-a5f8-ea0bd69b863b">
    Though Tubbo asked if everyone could get along, Wilbur was already too far gone with his maniacal plans. Wilbur taunted Tommy as he and Techno stared each other down in the pit below.
    <ul key="63e83bc7-bc24-4f6b-9e4b-ef38c1431c4f">
     <li key="28206e0d-75aa-4211-ae28-119991405b45">
      All Niki and Tubbo could do was watch as Wilbur continued to scorn him. Quietly, Tommy claimed that he wasn't doing this for Wilbur and he threw the first punch, claiming to do it for Tubbo. Technoblade landed the final punch, killing Tommy.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="fc5ddc0b-91cd-4fc0-95c7-f6f703a02ca9">
    Niki found herself following Tubbo to the Pogtopian potato farm as the fight ended. They sat together in silence as they listened to Techno and Wilbur plot for the further destruction of Manberg. While the two men chuckled together in regards to their delusions of grandeur of bombs and alliances, Tubbo and Niki quietly walked up to the surface entrance where they met Tommy.
    <ul key="031896f2-614f-48f7-8af3-888fd5ae2438">
     <li key="b1f5a53d-4876-432c-a5ac-52e5b8a0ed36">
      Reunited, the three Pogtopians returned to the depths of their home to converse with Techno, as Wilbur had logged off. The conversation was short-lived however, as Techno soon returned to his base as he'd continued to disagree with the others. Soon after, he logged off as well.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="a15aeb42-4e26-408c-8e35-c71f74f57e44">
    Tired, worn-down, and feeling beaten, Tommy, Tubbo, and Niki returned to the surface. The three of them wandered together through the woods surrounding Pogtopia as the evening slowly engulfed the light of the day. With a jukebox and one of Tommy's original music discs (Blocks) in their possession, they traveled to a ridge overlooking the stream which went into Manberg territory.
    <ul key="e5bb0b2d-436f-4cfe-be95-0116210892b1">
     <li key="eb44ff03-0191-499e-aa8a-6cb681d9ee84">
      The three Pogtopians vowed to stick together. No matter what, they couldn't lose now. Together, they sat atop the trees looking to the west at the setting sun. It was then, as the sun dipped beneath the horizon, that Niki quietly told her two companions that everything would be alright and they'd be in this together, because there was still hope L'Manberg could return.
