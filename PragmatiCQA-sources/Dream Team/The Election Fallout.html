   On September 22, 2020, at the
   L'Manberg Podium

   At first, it had seemed that POG2020 would be the chosen candidates, winning with their 45% of the votes. However, Wilbur reminded everyone that Quackity and Schlatt had agreed to combine their campaigns, Schlatt2020 and SWAG2020, meaning that their individual 30% and 16% combined into a total of 46%, beating POG2020 by 1%.
  </p>
  <p key="43c77ea9-a46c-45c6-be65-b0d9c7451174">
   Schlatt was then declared the new president of L'Manberg, with Quackity and George as his Vice Presidents.

   Tubbo went out to search for Tommy and Wilbur, but turned up nothing. Niki attempted to speak with Tubbo, and convince him that what was happening wasn't right, and that they had to do something.

  <p key="4082794a-dad8-4332-a0cd-a3135bc805c4">
   After getting far enough away that they hoped they wouldn't be tracked, the two began to build a base just outside of the

   While Wilbur explored the area underneath their base to try and expand, Tommy returned to civilization to see what he could recover before disappearing again. He managed to gather some items, stealing Fundy's skeleton horse, before nearly being spotted by Quackity, who happened to be in third person perspective at the time. Tommy escaped back to the woods without being followed.

  </h3>
  <p key="0b5aa3d9-e905-48b6-8fdd-168b420fe772">
   In his first official speech as President, Schlatt stated that they needed to take down the wall around L'Manberg. Quackity and Schlatt began pressuring the others to dismantle the wall, despite the protests of Tubbo and Nihachu. Tubbo begged Schlatt not to take them down because of the history behind them and what they'd stood for during the war. Schlatt then forced Tubbo to destroy two signs on the outside of the wall that read "If you destroy these, you hate your viewers", much to the outrage of everyone around them, including Quackity.
  </p>
  <p key="2fb55983-6ece-4ff4-8ca4-dfeee323d7ae">
   Quackity then tried to stand up for Tubbo, both because he disliked how Schlatt was treating him, and because Quackity himself felt under appreciated. He attempted to stop him from continuing to take down the walls, until Schlatt assured him that they were simply expanding the walls, and that they'd put the wall back up eventually, just with bigger borders. He pointed out a specific tall building in the distance, including it in his ideas of conquest. Eret was angered by this, as the building belonged to him, and didn't want it to be taken by Schlatt.
  </p>
  <p key="7e35eae7-ffb6-4600-8f83-d9e4e1293699">
   As they continued to tear down the wall, Eret warned Schlatt that his actions would bring a second war, to which Schlatt rebuffed that he wasn't afraid of war. Eret then began messaging Tubbo, telling him that what Schlatt was doing was a bad idea, that he was becoming a dictator, and that his actions weren't just. Tubbo, still worried about how Schlatt might react, didn't respond and continued to take down the wall.

  <p key="cd5076e4-a5ef-404b-9abf-697ee5b16cf1">
   While talking with Schlatt about what his plans for the previous home of L'Manberg were, Tubbo learned that Schlatt was planning on building a massive monument. When Tubbo asked if it would be of Tommy and Wilbur, Schlatt was so angered that he responded by saying that he should have their names banned so he never had to hear them again.
  </p>
  <p key="8f9c7d01-6c66-40ab-b40b-bf4871f029fd">
   Tubbo then went into the
   Carmarvan
   to reminisce on the first war, and the history behind it. Schlatt caught him doing this, and told him that this time was not for reminiscing. He began destroying what was left of the van, only for Tubbo to try and stop him. He attempted to convince Schlatt, as his right hand man, that this was a bad idea because he'd be destroying history. For a second Schlatt appeared to consider it, before he began to yell at Tubbo and threaten him for questioning his power. However, he didn't end up destroying the Camarvan.
  </p>
  <p key="b74ee131-bebd-4aa5-becb-5e97846821dc">
   Quackity then asked Tubbo if he could talk to him privately after Schlatt asked Tubbo to destroy a something that had been made for Wilbur. He confided in Tubbo that he thought Schlatt had gone crazy, and wasn't sure what to do about it. Tubbo, still bitter, blamed Quackity for causing all of this, as if he hadn't allied with Schlatt in the first place, none of this would've happened.

   After being alerted to the fact that Techno had joined the server, Quackity and Tubbo asked if Schlatt was worried. Schlatt responded that he wasn't, as he'd actually called in a favor, and that was the reason Techno was here at all. He assured the two that Techno was a sleeper agent, and that he'd betray Tommy and Wilbur when they needed him most.
  </p>
  <p key="6952c042-c790-47e6-8983-f97083d5737b">
   Schlatt decided to give a second speech, pronouncing that L'Manberg needed a new name for a new era, and that they need to drop the proverbial "L", renaming the country to Manberg. Tommy and Wilbur were horrified by the new name, along with Niki, who couldn't believe that he'd ever do such a thing. Outraged, she stormed off, and Schlatt asked Quackity to go and confront her.

   Quackity went to 'confront' Niki about her dissent for Manberg, but instead asked to hear her side, and see if he could do anything about it. She pointed out that Schlatt didn't respect Quackity, and that she was horrified about what they did to L'Manberg. Quackity asked if she had any sort of solution, and she said that they would all have to ally together in order to fight him and win. Niki believed that Schlatt didn't care what he took, just that he took it, and that he would take everything they had. Quackity wanted to help her, but began messing around and messaging Schlatt not to come into the building with them, prompting Niki to punch him, and not knowing he was only on half a heart, killing him.
  </p>
  <p key="79c22df6-7014-4ee1-8067-c15e8d85cbc0">
   Quackity then told Schlatt to imprison Niki for killing him, which he did gladly. She escaped up to
   Jack Manifold's
   balcony, where Schlatt trapped her with iron bars and dirt. He told her that there was no more L'Manberg, and that she was their prisoner now. Quackity, realizing that he'd done the wrong thing, helped Niki escape, and pretended like she did it herself, with Eret backing him up. She later thanked him in a private chat, which he nearly said aloud right to Schlatt.

   While Niki was being confronted by Schlatt and others inside, Tubbo took the time to sneak away to talk to Tommy and Wilbur. Wilbur asked Tubbo if he liked Schlatt very much, to which Tubbo replied that he didn't, and that his job was just following Schlatt around and doing everything he said. Tubbo was then asked if he wanted to be their "spy on the inside", and Tubbo replied excitedly that he'd love to be their Hercules Mulligan.

Quackity confronted Schlatt about his abuses of power, and how Quackity should matter in decisions, as during their conversations with Tommy, Schlatt said his opinion didn't matter. Schlatt attempted to manipulate Quackity into forgetting the whole thing, but Quackity reminded Schlatt that without him, he wouldn't be here, as they needed both of their votes combined in order to be where they are now.

   Quackity told Schlatt that if their ideals continued not to align, they wouldn't work together for much longer. Schlatt agreed with the sentiment, stating that he did need Quackity, and that they couldn't do this without each other.

   Wilbur, Tommy, and Techno began building a new city in the ravine beneath their base, which Tommy dubbed

   and Eret began to track the Pogtopians to their base, and explored the inner depths of the ravine, only to discover Techno within the ravine in the potato farm he'd been constructing to feed Pogtopia.

   While exploring the ravine, Tommy discovered a strip mine he believed might lead somewhere important, and ended up finding that it lead him to his bunker which he created in case of emergencies during the War for L'Manbergian Independence. He found that he was able to access his base through it, and further, the entirety of the inner city.

   and Eret found Wilbur crouched beneath a tree. Eret explained to Bad that he supported Wilbur, and the two made their way back to the main area of the server.

   Schlatt went to sleep in a bed, but ended up on "life support" after being pronounced dead by Tubbo and Ponk. Quackity was pressured to take power by his chat, who heavily insisted that he overthrow Schlatt. Instead of directly doing so, Quackity made multiple gestures pointing towards assassinating Schlatt, such as removing the plug for his life support.

  <p key="38c60b46-a0b9-4b34-ac72-bcad40bb8227">
   Schlatt recovered enough to move, and they discussed current events. At one point, Quackity held a crossbow in his hand loaded with one arrow seemingly ready to fire at Schlatt's head to assassinate him for the presidential title, even having Ponk telling him to do so, though he didn't end up going through with it.
  </p>
  <p key="f2850d65-7f36-4e63-9199-15a2b30c3fa3">
   Quackity began to consider contacting Tommy, knowing that he might be in need of an alliance with how power hungry Schlatt was becoming. He sent a message, but Tommy didn't seem to notice it before logging off. No other attempt at communication about an alliance was made publicly between the two.

   Fundy came to Eret asking him about his opinion on the destruction of the L'Manbergian wall, and Eret claimed he believed it was disrespectful to L'Manbergian history, and disagreed with the dictatorial role that Jschlatt had begun holding. Fundy told Eret of a plan to win the full trust of Jschlatt so he could gain the power to take him down from the inside, and Eret claimed he was willing to support Fundy's plan.
  </p>
  <p key="8491300c-34ba-4b63-b3d8-7d909380140c">
   Fundy then revealed to Eret and Niki that he wanted the L'Manbergian flag to be removed, which created tension between Fundy and Niki, who had built the flag in the first place. Soon after, Eret caught Fundy attempting to destroy the flag, and killed him. Eret stated that he wanted to respect the server's history, and strived to support its people, whether they were his friends or enemies. Fundy later burned down most of the L'Manberg flag, much to Niki's dismay. Eret and Niki just barely stopped the fire, and the flag was reduced a only quarter of what it once was.

   Eret later decided to burn down the electoral podium, claiming that everything that happened was not history, it was tyranny.
