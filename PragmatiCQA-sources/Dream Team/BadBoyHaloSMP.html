   is one of the original eight members of the SMP, of which he is eighth, and joined on May 10, 2020. He was the leader of the
   Badlands
   , and aimed to spark eternal chaos and wars throughout the SMP. He later was corrupted by
   the Egg
   and founded the
   Eggpire
   . He played a major role in the spread of the
   Crimson
   across the server as one of the most loyal to the Egg. He later revealed that was due to his desire to be with his best friend,
   Skeppy
   . He is the father of
   Sapnap
   . Due to his nature as a demon, he has infinite lives unless Skeppy loses all of his.

   BadBoyHalo is a generally kind individual who will often help people regardless of their side in conflict. He hates swearing, particularly on his streams, and will often tell people off for naughty language, most notably Tommy and Quackity. He can be seen as somewhat of a "dad friend," and Sapnap sometimes refers to him as "DadBoyHalo." He attempts to stay neutral at all times, and only chooses sides that he believes will benefit the Badlands in the long run. Despite his want for peace, he's been shown to have a chaotic side, particularly wanting to fan the flames of war so long as the Badlands are not involved.

  </h3>
  <p key="9c45250d-ecb7-4d5a-a2aa-40caf8e98d95">
   When Bad discovered the Egg inside his statue room, it quickly clouded his mind with a strong desire to protect the Egg and to aid in the spread of its vines across the server. While Bad's personality remained fundamentally the same, he went through some noticeable changes, one being quitting calling out others' usage of swearing, something he took much pride in in the past. He also quickly became violent with whomever threatened to harm the Egg, even if they are good friends - when Sam tried to break the Egg, Bad and Ant threatened they would either have to kill him, or blow up his base as revenge. Despite that, he still had an aversion towards violence, but his love for the Egg surpassed his civility. The only thing Bad seemed to cherish more than the Egg was Skeppy.
  </p>
  <p key="ea3167cc-983f-42f0-acdc-69d840df9702">
   After once again being corrupted by the Egg, Bad became a religious zealot toward the Egg, wishing for the entire server to become covered with the blood vines. Bad became considerably less merciful, and much more frightening. He doesn't hold back from taking action to rid those who get in the way of the Eggpire - trapping and forcing people who were once his friends to succumb to the Egg's influence. He shows no hesitance nor remorse against the thought of killing Tommy, even when Puffy and Sam plead for him to acknowledge that he's only a child.
  </p>
  <p key="77d16bcc-ad12-467c-b8e9-5b6fafdaa948">
   He also became incredibly manipulative, stopping at nothing to convince others that the Egg is the only means to true peace on the server – the way

   </i>
   can get what they want in the end. He stretches the truth of the Eggpire to Ant, Punz, and Puffy, saying that the end goal was always, after the initial chaos, to contain the Egg and in turn save the entire server, being regarded as heroes worthy of glory, though his conversations with the now-corrupted Antfrost seem to contradict the goal of the Eggpire - they live to serve the Egg and continue its mass spread. He lulls Sam into a false sense of security, feigning coming to his senses and momentarily breaking out of his brainwashed state, convincing Sam to trust them and give up his items, just to trap him in the obsidian chamber above the Egg and leave him there for hours to fall victim to the corruption and mutilate himself. Bad tries to lure in Quackity by attempting to convince him that Bad only cares about

   Even though he is a generally bubbly and friendly individual, he will start cussing people out with his own form of swear words (i.e: muffinhead, what the muffin) due to him disliking swears. Whenever someone swears, he would stop whatever he was doing and begin his routine of yelling language and then lecturing them by using his own dictionary of curse words.
  </p>
  <p key="f0460a34-f287-4064-b2c2-5e0d0ef24b57">
   Bad's biggest personal weakness is Skeppy, as the closest person in his life and will stop at nothing to protect him, even if it costs putting himself in harm's way. He's continuously shown that he's willing to risk it all – his freedom, his safety, his happiness – if it means Skeppy is alright.

  <p key="dfcd144a-f289-45db-845c-eaf1c443875a">
   BadBoyHalo discovered an unknown crimson lifeform, later formally referred to as the Egg, while constructing his statue room and was one of the first to be possessed. BadBoyHalo seemed to be extremely protective, almost maternal, of the Egg; calling it his "baby" and showering it with other forms of compliments. Every other member who was presented the Egg seemed to be take a disliking towards it, with the exception of Captain Puffy, Ponk, and Antfrost, and couldn't seem to understand why Bad was so protecting of it. Bad seemed to be able to hear the Egg speak to him, and would threaten to hurt anyone if they harmed it, incasing it in obsidian later, to ensure its safety.
  </p>
  <p key="9dcd858b-995d-419f-88ab-71fa58578191">
   Sapnap attempted to blow up part of the Egg and cracked it, making Bad panic. He said he needed flesh to heal it, and asked Sapnap and Awesamdude to sacrifice one of themselves. Sam and Sapnap returned with holy water, threateningly. Bad wasn't too upset, and just wanted to convince Sam and Sapnap that it's fine and express to them that the Egg was angry. However, as the two started destroying clumps of vines outside of the statue room, Bad yelled at them to stop.
  </p>
  <p key="8ed2a0e9-6aa8-4ea5-9c06-e3ce6091c6d4">
   When Bad wasn't focused on the Egg, he behaved mostly the same as usual. He'd done his best to help out and be there for his friends. Bad gave Tommy several gifts during his exile, most notably the music disc Chirp, and made sure he knew it wasn't just out of pity. He built Tommy a Tubbo statue with the help of Puffy, which was destroyed by Tommy not long after.
  </p>
  <p key="f44ff889-3f87-4774-aa53-f3f0d10d9940">
   In an effort to protect the Egg from outside harm, Bad and Ant covered it in obsidian, covering it with another layer later on. Afterwards, Bad and Puffy noticed that they cared less about the Egg and didn't mind destroying its blood vines around the server. Ant later joined and agreed with the two, helping them to destroy almost all of the blood vines around the server, leaving only Ponk's mutated vines 'Lil Red and the Egg itself intact.
  </p>
  <p key="071a3534-927a-4677-a7f6-f514d2327bfc">
   After Skeppy trapped himself inside of the Egg, Bad grew much more against the Egg and only expressed concern towards his friend. When Skeppy emerged a day later Red - and seemingly totally apathetic towards his once-best friend - Bad was horrified and tried everything he possibly could to turn Skeppy back to normal. At this point, Bad was totally broken out of the Egg's control, and just wanted his best friend back. All attempts to help Skeppy ultimately lead nowhere, and Bad was forced to leave Skeppy alone; and cope with the rift in their relationship alone.
  </p>
  <p key="44a10cc7-000b-43a9-ac47-e1cbddd1b6cc">
   Bad and Ant dedicated themselves to experimenting on the Egg in an attempt to learn more about its influence and how exposure to the Egg can affect different blocks, like obsidian and the colors of wool. Bad and Punz also found out it grew even bigger, and Bad discovered a way to keep infected people safe from the Egg while it is uncovered by completely quarantining the Egg into the statue room; protecting the outer SMP and whoever may enter with a barriered obsidian entrance, hazmat suits, and the holy water of Church Prime.
  </p>
  <p key="42d5a6af-c178-4b20-829a-dbf5fd66631f">
   Bad and Ant have attempted multiple experiments in order to free Skeppy from the Egg's influence, though each test resulted in Skeppy getting even more strange and unfamiliar, much to Bad's despair. Antfrost called Bad out for being noticeably more violent than usual, trying to convince Ant that killing Eret may somehow be the key to saving Skeppy. Bad gets defensive, remaining adamant that he is still himself and not under the Egg's influence whatsoever. Ant remains suspicious.

  <p key="b6f46c6a-6ad6-474a-9914-eac66b258fdd">
   Bad fully succumbed to the corruption of the Egg and has been plotting the Egg's takeover of the SMP. He purposely hosted a meeting between himself, Puffy, Antfrost and Punz above the Egg in an attempt to lull them under its influence. Bad had been able to hide the fact that he has been re-corrupted, tricking his allies into thinking that he is still completely himself.
  </p>
  <p key="2b2dcbeb-79f3-4f89-aec7-32450198e47b">
   The plan was somewhat successful with Bad being able to convince Ant, Puffy, and Punz to go and visit the Egg without any sort of protection and assist him in breaking down the obsidian entrance containing the Egg within the room, and planting blood vine seedlings in the remains of L'Manberg. The others were immediately put under the Egg's influence; the only person not to be fooled was Puffy, who used her book to break the spell over her. However, she still hesitantly helped Bad plant the seeds in order to gain his trust. The four of them founded the
   Eggpire
   ; a name suggested by Punz.

   Tommy approached Ant and Bad about investigating the Egg. Bad took his chance and showed Tommy around the Egg, convincing him not to wear a hazmat suit. Tommy came down to the Egg with them, Bad and Ant urging him to get closer and stand on top of it. Frightened, Tommy hesitantly does what they say, to a surprising result; Tommy expressed complete his neutrality towards it, confused and quickly turning the situation into a joke. Bad and Ant were shocked that Tommy wasn't affected, discussing amongst themselves that perhaps Tommy would be better suited as a sacrifice, and chased Tommy out of the room.
  </p>
  <p key="85fc41a4-6efb-4733-869a-8a69e75cb04e">
   Later, Tommy returned with Tubbo and Bad appeared with Ant. The Egg made Tubbo cry - him proclaiming how mean it is - and neither Ant nor Bad were fooled by Tommy and Tubbo's attempts to cover it up. Bad managed to box Tommy up in obsidian and spoke to him, but Tommy wasn't taking him seriously. Awesamdude's alternate persona Sam Nook burst in and saved Tommy and Tubbo.
  </p>
  <p key="8a816382-1a88-4216-942d-d976e39bccff">
   Another day, Bad called a meeting for the Eggpire. Antfrost, Puffy and Awesamdude turned up. Ant and Bad discussed feeding Puffy to the Egg, much to her disgust and Bad also brought up the fact that Tommy and Tubbo had been down to the Egg. Unable to hide her feelings, Puffy lashed out at him about putting the children in danger's way. Sam brought out a lot of opposition and Bad was disappointed to hear that he was still completely against the Egg, and whatever the Eggpire was. After a debate back-and-forth between the four, Bad recognized his approach was failing, and that both Sam and Puffy weren't going to be so easily convinced. Bad changes his approach; now appearing momentarily freed from the Egg's influence and coming to his senses - which Sam fell for completely. Bad pretends to agree with Sam and say that he and Ant need to get a hold of themselves. Bad, after removing his disguise and showing his true now-white cloak, slows down, and asks Sam one last time if he's absolutely sure he's against the Egg. Disappointingly, Sam's mind had not been changed. After convincing Sam into handing over his items, and giving Bad a reconciling hug, Sam had been successfully manipulated into a false sense of security. Bad pressed the button that opened the center of the table, leaving Sam to plummet into the depths of the obsidian chamber located directly on top of the Egg.
  </p>
  <p key="4d6a4d77-367a-46eb-9e28-479560e422ad">
   With Sam and Puffy both now panicking, Bad ordered Ant to attack Puffy, who was forced to flee from the meeting room. Bad talked down to Sam, stating that he was to stay down there until he learns to love the Egg just as much as Bad and Ant and that he was not coming out until then. Puffy managed to escape into her own Secret Bunker without the others capturing her.

   When Bad later learns through Ant that Puffy and Tommy helped Sam escape his prison, he shows no remorse, only annoyance, and the event seems to solidify the thought that they need to take care of Tommy and Puffy before they continue being a hindrance and getting in the way of any more of the Eggpire's plans. Bad and Ant discuss potentially kidnapping Puffy's son, Foolish, as punishment for prematurely releasing Sam.

   Bad went to visit Techno at his house and told him he wanted to show him something (the Egg). Several times on their journey to the Egg, Bad thought he saw someone (Ranboo) following them, but dismissed it as nothing. When they arrived, Bad tried to entice Techno with promises that the Egg could give him the power to topple any government.
  </p>
  <p key="1d342b16-2464-4186-9360-d0ef41bad4cf">
   The egg started to speak in Techno's head but, much to Bad's dismay, it was just used as another one Techno's many "I have 316k people in my chat and all of them are canonically voices in my head" bits with Techno saying that he had at least 300 thousand voices already in his head so he didn't notice the addition of one.
  </p>
  <p key="989f85fe-f243-4430-83bc-9ed5ec65751d">
   As they spoke, Puffy revealed herself from where she'd been hiding and spoke against him, telling Techno about the Eggpire being a government. Bad discovered that Ranboo was spying on their conversation, and managed to trap Ranboo next to the Egg with the intent of brainwashing him. He pearled away whilst Puffy and Techno were distracted, but returned soon after to find that Ranboo had already been rescued. He didn't fight, knowing that the three would best him immediately as they did before. Instead he let them leave and Puffy started the resistance against him - "Pro-Omelette."

   Bad and Ant went to Hannah's house and discovered Sam and
   Hannah
   clearing out blood vines on her house. They asked why and were told that Hannah was allergic to the Egg so the vines needed to be removed for her safety. They attempted to turn Hannah but she was adamant that the Egg was a bad thing. Bad then convinced her to come down with them to see why the Egg was hurting her. Hannah got more sick the closer they came and couldn't enter the Egg room without planting roses around her. The Egg told the Eggpire not to hurt her as it liked Hannah. Instead they trapped her in an obsidian box above the Egg and left her there.
  </p>
  <p key="e0204f4e-ba77-40a1-ade3-0e9c6a621e25">
   The next day Punz, Ant and Bad came down to the Egg to find Hannah gone and obsidian destroyed. They headed to her house and discovered her house completely covered in vines and its color leeched out. They confronted Sam about Hannah's disappearance who claimed to have no idea where she was. They left the house, unaware that Hannah was hiding inside.

   On March 14th, Quackity attempted to light TNT around the Egg and blow it up, but was spotted by Bad and Punz. Quackity retreated to the secret red hallways near the Egg room, and threatened to light the TNT, placing TNT as he backtracked. Bad and Punz followed him into the hallway. Bad told Quackity that he couldn't get in the way of the Egg, as it would get in the way of his mission; without the Egg, he  has nothing. Bad commanded Punz to go after Quackity, and the two cornered him in the hallway. Quackity still threatened to light the TNT and ordered Punz to leave him and Bad alone. Quackity told Bad that they had to get rid of the Egg, but Bad said that Quackity didn't know what would be brought down on him. Quackity pretended to think for a second, but lit the TNT, destroying the area, and seemingly, the Egg along with it.

   Bad first started heading to the Egg room, prepared to talk to it. When he finished speaking to the Egg, he spotted Skeppy walking around the Egg room.  When he tried to engage in friendly conversation with him and suggest they spend time together, Skeppy told him to go away and wanted to spend more time with the Egg, calling Bad selfish and saying they weren't friends. This caused Bad's loyalty to the Egg to waver as he told it to shut up and called it stupid when it got in the way of him and Skeppy. The two got into a very deep argument, and Bad ended up accidentally pushing Skeppy into lava, taking both of their first canon lives.

  <p key="98b3efd9-617c-4548-ae6c-aec127eed540">
   Bad was one of the organizers of the Red Banquet, and helped invite members. On the Banquet Day, Bad continued to affirm that the banquet was set up in hopes of "turning a new leaf." Foolish, Puffy and Eret expressed hope for a brighter future, though both remembered the damages inflicted upon their respective properties.
  </p>
  <p key="b5c20702-2024-4b89-ad1f-0b32920e2542">
   Bad finished the round of toasting with a second speech, promising that the banquet would be an event that no one would ever forget.
  </p>
  <p key="c649f430-e0a1-49f7-b834-e7f7cdbd4559">
   As Bad continue to speak, lava began flowing down and created barriers around the guests, trapping everyone in the room. Bad concluded his speech by saying, "Thank you for coming, everybody...Prepare to die." After this, Ranboo was not seen; it is unclear if he stayed for the remainder of the event. Puffy is disappointed, but admitted that she planned for this occurrence and hid a stash of equipment before the event. However, when she opened her stash, it is empty. Hannah stepped to the Eggpire's side, and announced that she had to serve the Egg and tipped them off beforehand. Sam activated his final backup plan, deploying TNT directly on top of the Egg; however, the explosions dealt minimal damage and the Egg rapidly regenerated. Bad explained that, after
   Quackity's attempt to destroy the Egg
   , they took "proper precautions." He revealed that the banquet was a ruse, and that the egg required energy gained from death to hatch.
  </p>
  <p key="ba061a44-c35e-4bc4-aebb-893f8632f4c3">
   Eret spoke out against them, calling them monsters because they betrayed everyone. Bad mocked Eret, calling it ironic that they said that when they betrayed before, but Eret said that they now knew it was wrong, as Hannah should. Hannah then guided Eret to a sacrificial pit, where Bad prepared to kill them. Foolish stepped forth and asked if the Egg could withstand a barrage of lightning; however, as everyone looked at the Egg, no lightning appeared. Powerless, upon Puffy's shocked gaze, Foolish took Eret's place as the first sacrifice and was slain by Antfrost whilst Puffy screamed at them to stop.
  </p>
  <p key="58702c5f-c128-4c0b-9505-6b65ab480358">
   As Bad gloated over the first death, Quackity broke through the wall of the banquet room, demanding that he stop. He demanded that Bad re-evaluate what he was doing, and believed that Bad was letting himself be manipulated. During his speech, he stealthily gave an axe to Puffy. Bad explained that the Egg would give him something that no one else could, and so he couldn't consider stopping. He pointed out that Quackity was outnumbered, and that he should've brought an army if he wanted to stop them. Quackity, undeterred, said that he didn't come alone. Technoblade and Purpled entered the room behind Quackity, accompanied by members of the
   Hound Army
   . Furious, Bad accused Purpled of being a traitor, as they had hired him to attack Puffy, but Purpled said that Quackity had the better offer. Beyond that, Bad was in shock that Techno would choose to side with Quackity, given their long history as enemies, but Techno stated that the Eggpire needed to be stopped, and that he was willing to work with Quackity to make that happen. Bad gloated that they outnumbered them 4 to 3, but Puffy exclaimed "Well actually...Antfrost you're dead!" and murdered Ant with the axe, taking Ant's first canon life.
  </p>
  <p key="1879e2dd-0649-4532-a962-38cd7acf1953">
   This caused chaos, and they all started to blindly fight each other, whilst some unarmed members left so they weren't hurt in the crossfire. In the ensuing battle, Quackity, Techno, and Purpled all overpowered the Eggpire so Bad ordered them to retreat. Hannah protested against it, but eventually all members were running for their life. Purpled chased them for a time, but wasn't able to track where they went.
  </p>
  <p key="849d13d8-148a-45ab-aa65-0549f9fe6acb">
   After their retreat, Bad, Ponk, and Hannah split off and went into hiding. As he traveled, Bad became distraught over the loss of the Egg and told himself that he needed what the Egg could provide, but didn't want to hurt anyone; reflecting on the death of Foolish, he wondered if he was wrong. He went to speak with a unknown person.

  <p key="9d497c0d-9025-41ab-a2ed-16ae72d123b0">
   Seemingly free from the Egg's power, BadBoyHalo met up with Antfrost, and the two apologized to Puffy for their actions whilst under the Egg's control.

      BadBoyHalo and Antfrost are both fellow Badlanders. The two are great allies, fighting in the
      Second Pet War
      and
      War of the Burning Eiffel Tower
      together. The two have bonded over the shared connection towards the Egg, having the same intense need to protect the Egg and have the vines spread across the entire server. Bad and Ant are the only two who are able to hear the Crimson speak to them. Together, they have planted several spores around the server and feed the vines to improve their rapid growth. After breaking free from the Egg's mind control, they and Puffy plot to save Skeppy and stop the spread of the blood vines, as well as study the vines and the Egg. After getting re-corrupted, Bad and Ant were under complete control of the Egg and are happy to work together to spread its influence. They were working together to expand their Eggpire.

       Since escaping the egg's influence, Bad and Ant have remained good friends, and bonded over their shared animosity towards Awesamdude's conduct as Warden of Pandora's Vault, where they worked together. Ant supported Bad emotionally and reassured him that Sam's criticism of his work as a guard was blame shifting. They confronated Sam together, and both resigned from their guard jobs in protest, with Ant having encouraged Bad to speak out for himself.

      Awesamdude was contracted by BadBoyHalo to build a piston door in his mansion. The two made a deal for the build, where Bad would give him some supplies in return for Awesamdude building the door. After the Manberg Festival, Awesamdude joined Bad in creating a third faction, as they disapproved of Schlatt's tyranny.

       Sam came into conflict with Bad and Antfrost over the Crimson Egg. While BadBoyHalo and Antfrost are adamant about protecting the Egg, Sam suspects that it is evil - "bad juju" as Sam says. After re-succumbing to the Egg's corruption, Sam takes a stand against both Bad and the Eggpire; most notably horrified with Bad attempting to lead Tommy into danger and worsen his mental health. Bad manipulates Sam, fooling his friend into thinking he'd finally come to his senses, before dropping Sam into the Egg's chamber and trapping him inside for a day, leaving Sam incredibly shaken up and traumatized. During Badboyhalo's visit to Pandora's Vault, he has claimed that their relationship is neutral. Although Bad may or may not realize it, Sam deeply despises the Egg's influence and plans to turn against the Eggpire from the inside.
At the Red Banquet, Sam tried to destroy the Egg by dropping TNT on it but Bad and the Eggpire had prepared for this. Sam had fully revealed himself to be against the Egg though it seems the other members already knew this, making them officially enemies.

       Their relationship probably got even worse following Bad's resignation in protest from his job as a guard for Pandora's vault after Dream's breakout. Bad confronted Sam about his conduct as Warden, being most notably upset about his killing Technoblade's dog, murdering Ranboo, and (he correctly suspects) allowing an outsider to access the prison outside visiting hours and routinely torture Dream. Bad now deeply distrusts Sam, and their relationship is highly strained.

      Puffy and Bad were good friends, usually helping each other with building projects. When Puffy was new to the SMP he allowed her to live inside Bubbles the duck statue, and re-built Bubbles together when it was destroyed by Tommy. Puffy offered to be Bad's "Walmart," or "Discount Skeppy" as Bad calls her, whenever he is missing his friend. Despite their positive friendship, Puffy has made jokes about their friendship being one-sided, and that Bad never stops mentioning Skeppy enough to appreciate her company. Bad and Puffy also bond over the both of them being corrupted by the Crimson Egg and are shown to be equally infatuated with the Egg. After breaking free from the Egg's mind control, they and Antfrost plot to save Skeppy and stop the spread of the blood vines, as well as study the vines and the Egg.

       When a fully corrupted Bad invited Puffy to join the Eggpire, she only agreed so she could spy and eventually put an end to his plan that was to let the Egg spread across the entirety of the SMP, enabling complete chaos, which would give the Eggpire the chance to silently take over. When Bad and Ant allowed Tommy and Tubbo to go down to the Egg without hazmat suits, Puffy screamed at them for endangering the children afterward, resulting in the two of them chasing her attempting to kill her. Puffy has since then said that she hates Bad, but still mourns the loss of their friendship.

      Bad was the first in the server to be charmed by the Egg, though eventually lost his blind loyalty after it had corrupted Skeppy, however he later once again became accepting of the Egg. He let it corrupt and influence him, leading to the creation of the Eggpire. He currently leads the charge of the Eggpire and is heavily corrupted from the Egg's influence. He is the primary way that the Egg communicates its intentions with the rest of the SMP. Bad does the Egg's bidding and is even able to understand the Egg's speech, listening to its demands. However, after Skeppy was telling Bad about he prefers to hang out with the Egg than Bad, Bad got mad at the Egg, calling it stupid. It is unknown if Bad actually meant this or if he was just angry in the moment. Thus leaving the status unknown. Bad seems to care about Skeppy more than he cares for the Egg.

      Prior to the events of the final battle of the Dream SMP, BadBoyHalo had a positive relationship with Dream, as the Badlands and Dream SMP had teamed up a lot previously, and Bad even helped Dream build Pandora's Vault.

       BadBoyHalo and several other members of the Dream SMP entered Dream's vault to rescue Tommy and Tubbo. There, Bad found that Dream had tried to capture Skeppy to have control over Bad, and Bad was one of the many that aided Tommy and Tubbo in the capturing of Dream.

       Following Dream's escape from Pandora's Vault, Bad has expressed both sympathy for Dream given the dreadful nature of his treatment in prison (namely his torture by Quackity, which Bad suspects), and regret at having perhaps missed an opportunity to try harder to stop Dream's escape as a result. Bad expressed hope that Dream would overlook his role as a guard, and hold no hard feelings towards him, as a result of his providing Dream contraband treats while he was locked away... though this hope largely faded when met with a rebuttal from Antfrost. Bad's perception of Dream is presently complicated by his mixed feelings of fear and empathy.

      Quackity often enjoys messing with Bad because of his view on using vulgar language, and Bad tries to move Quackity away from using such language. At the end of the day, they are good friends.
      <p key="774819da-922d-4135-a311-03ac78ca9929">
       This has somewhat shifted since Bad has been corrupted by the crimson. The two have differing views of the Egg, and had a long conversation and argument about its influence. In the end, Quackity told Bad he would be sure to get in the way of his goal of having the Egg influence everyone. Quackity also tells Bad that he believes that he has no real power.
      </p>
      <p key="67ad97ee-f588-46ad-a33a-d3b0866eaf54">
       Quackity says that he cares about Bad, misses being friends, and thinks that he is still in there underneath the control of the Egg which adds to his desire to destroy it. When he placed TNT all over it Bad confronted him and tried to stop him.
At the Red Banquet, Quackity confronted Bad again, telling him that he had gone too far. He brought Technoblade and Purpled to fight him and they drove out Bad and the other members of the Eggpire.

      Bad is Sapnap's father, he apparently found him under a rock and took him in. Bad has described Sapnap as a "happy accident." Bad fought alongside Sapnap during the
      Battle of the Lake
      after he was framed by Tommy and Dream for burning down the Eiffel Tower. Sapnap is mostly unaware of Bad's relationship with
      the Egg
      . However, Sapnap stated he wanted to kill the Egg, to which Bad protested, showing that they have very differing opinions on the subject.

      To what used to be best friends and roommates in the quartz mansion they built together, Skeppy and Bad used to be one of the closest pairs in the Dream SMP. Despite occasionally arguing with one another, the two would do anything for each other at the end of the day. However, that came to a halt when the infection of the Crimson Egg had corrupted Bad. After the question, "Do you love the Egg more than me?" that Skeppy increasingly pressed on Bad, it had come clear that their relationship was no longer what it was before. In a moment of clarity from the Egg's effect on him, Bad told Skeppy he would choose him, and showed little concern for the Egg after Skeppy trapped himself inside of it – eager to save his friend no matter what.
      <p key="74ad1461-a4fb-496a-8e30-d7212b7c7600">
       After Skeppy was corrupted, their relationship had strained further. He showed apathy towards Bad. The rift only continued to grow. As Bad became fully corrupted by the Egg, he lost hope in ever saving Skeppy. During the confrontation with Quackity, It's heavily implied that Skeppy is Bad's heart's one desire; the Egg promised Bad that as long as Bad succumbs to the corruption, that he can be with Skeppy. Throughout everything, all the chaos and pain, all Bad wants is Skeppy, and if it means being brainwashed and used as a pawn, then so be it. However, he expresses some concern about the amount of time Skeppy is spending with the Egg despite also being corrupted. Bad cares about Skeppy more than he cares for the Egg.

      They've had bad relations from the start with Tommy always messing with Bad by cursing. They also fought against each other in the
      War of the Burning Eiffel Tower
      after Tommy attempted to frame Bad for burning down the tower.
      <p key="d77affbe-6e79-41e1-8dda-b32722415f09">
       During Tommy's exile, Bad gave him some gifts, including a Chirp disc. Tommy was hesitant to accept them, thinking they were "pity items," but showed gratitude nonetheless.

       After Bad has succumbed completely to the Egg, he's shown to be incredibly irritated by the corruption's lack of effect on Tommy, stating that everyone is either for the Egg or against it - but no one is allowed to be neutral. Bad deemed Tommy a threat against the Eggpire's plans, and planned to kill Tommy under the order of the Egg. When Tommy lost his final canon life, he celebrated.
