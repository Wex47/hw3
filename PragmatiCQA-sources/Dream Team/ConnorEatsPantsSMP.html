  </h2>
  <p key="c5bdad78-de5a-47f8-a975-ccac6425573a">
   Connor is somewhat socially awkward
   and tends to keep to himself, avoiding social interaction when he can.
   He tends to get embarrassed or upset easily when other members mock him, becoming overly defensive
   or hiding behind others,
   implying that he is somewhat insecure about himself.
  </p>
  <p key="81da3c03-e202-4bb0-aa95-5988b905d676">
   Despite this, he is the self proclaimed "main character" and "most important person" of the SMP, although it's not certain how much of this is a joke, and how much is a genuine desire for importance on the server, as he states he plans to become "number one" on the server in the future.
   Despite this, he makes little effort in achieving this goal. His
   diary
   implies that he is disinterested in doing things that he finds too difficult or too time-consuming, which could explain the lack of any action in that regard.
  </p>
  <p key="b2c3cbd0-bcfa-4107-aa9b-62bb5c80b337">
   Connor is also somewhat of a facetious person, often making joking claims that either confuse or provoke those he speaks to. He is not above lying and stealing,
   however, as he has done both under the guise of "borrowing items."
   Though he usually keeps to himself, he often acts as a humorous distraction to cheer people up.
  </p>
  <p key="38e5c0ae-ca43-48ad-8bea-4bb3c1a64e81">
   Connor seems to be somewhat interested in the server's politics, as during the

    Exile Conflict
   </a>
   he chimed in with his opinions on the matter several times. After Tommy's death and resurrection inside Pandora's Vault, Connor stated that he supported prison reform efforts, further supporting his interest in server politics.
  </p>
  <p key="629ae96a-ed69-437b-bb1d-8e8410237dab">
   Connor also seems to be generally forgiving of those who harm him. He's stated that he has trauma from the time Tommy and Techno kidnapped and tortured him. He seems to have forgiven Tommy for this, although he says he's still "dealing with the trauma", saying he doesn't consider Tommy a bad person despite his actions towards him.
   He also calls Tommy his friend in his diary, saying he misses him.

Connor then asked Purpled if he had any pants to give him, to which Purpled reluctantly gave him his netherite leggings, telling him to give them back afterward. However, Connor logged off of the server with the pants.

  <p key="feb8e1ef-f64e-413d-879e-4c24f3fe7482">
   A while later, Tommy greets Connor, telling him to make a list of the people he likes and dislikes. He shows Connor his home, and Connor inquires about the discs, causing Tommy to decide he needs to give Connor a proper tour of the server. They come across

   Connor meets

   Phil introduces himself to Connor, remarking about the two having been in
   Minecraft Monday
   together.
   Connor decides he doesn't like Phil and Puffy, since they keep making fun of him. Tommy and Connor proceed to make Phil their "bitch", demanding he do things for them, and attacking him. Connor makes Tommy live in Ninja's house, before turning around and deciding Tommy can have his house back.

   Connor meets up with Puffy again, who seems to have changed her attitude towards him. She offers him armor, to which he states he only wants pants. Puffy gives him a pair of pants that she received from Fundy, before leaving Connor alone again, this time with a more positive impression. He then talks to Schlatt (non-canonically) and runs into Technoblade, and later Puffy again. Puffy seems to have returned to making fun of him, and Connor once again decides he doesn't like her for being mean to him.

   He later runs into Punz, and asks him where he can find diamonds, to which Punz responds by accusing Connor of asking him for free things. Connor denies this, and Punz tells him that he has a low chance of managing to steal anyone's diamonds, to which Connor says he doesn't want to steal. Punz leads Connor to a storage room and gives him diamond blocks, telling him that he's the only generous person on the server. Punz warns Connor not to talk to Sam, saying "he's a terrible person". Connor thanks Punz for his help before leaving.

   Connor immediately decides to ignore Punz's warning and find Sam and try to scam him, before changing his mind after hearing how far away his base is. He instead messages Sam to ask for free things, to which Sam kindly responds by saying he can give him things. Connor accidentally replies using the public chat, which freaks him out as he doesn't want Punz to know he's talking to Sam.

   Sam comes to Connor's house to give him diamonds and iron blocks, only to be attacked by an invisible player. Connor tells Sam that his house is known to be haunted. Sam shows Connor the spider spawner, and Connor tells him he thinks "the spirits" are following him. Sam tells Connor can have the crops from his old farm before leaving.

   When Connor returns home, the invisible player is in his house again, which confuses him. Connor runs off, distressed about the strange invisible person who keeps following him. Connor decides to sacrifice an animal to attempt to appease the "spirit" following him. The "spirit" punches Connor while he's looking for an animal, which frightens him. He finds a dog, and he's hesitant to hurt it. Despite this, he kills the dog, as the "spirit" eggs him on. This seems to appease the "spirit", who leaves.

   Connor finds another dog and wants to tame it, so he steals bones from Skeppy's mansion. He names the dog "Toby Cumbeast" after Tobuscus. He later returns to look for a nametag, and while he doesn't find one, he takes a Netherite chestplate, defending it by saying he's just borrowing it.

Tommy threatened to leave, which was followed by Connor stating that he will cry if Tommy left, in order to make it uncomfortable for the other guests. The situation was diffused by Slime who made a "This party is fire" pun, setting the party house on fire.

   After this, Schlatt joined the party, chasing Tommy out into the woods behind Connor's home, as the party house was exploded by Sam. Tommy then killed Schlatt. Connor then drank a slow fall potion and performed an impressive party trick in front of the party goers. Schlatt proceeded to kill Tommy and log off to keep all his stuff. He logged back on and then was killed by Punz after he took a lot of fall damage from trying to use a riptide trident.

   On the 1st of March, sometime after the death of Tommy, Connor logged onto the server, expressing a desire to canonically kill someone to “get into the lore.” His target was Karl, but after Karl failed to respond to a private message, he contacted Sam instead, who appeared as Sam Nook in front of the Big Innit Hotel. Connor pulls out a “script” and briefly reads through it, afterward approaching Sam Nook. Connor expresses a desire to stay in the hotel. Despite Sam Nook’s insistence that Connor would not be able to book a room until Tommy returned, Connor does so anyway after being shown a suite. Sam Nook does not object to this, and states to give him a call if Connor needed any amenities. Connor then states that he “lives here now.”

   , The Haunted Mansion. Both he and Karl seem somewhat confused when Karl first appears at the site, as they both recognize each other right away. Connor seems to be aware that Karl is a time traveler, asking if his visit to the shack is "one of [Karl's] things that he does."
   Soon after introducing Karl to the rest of the cast, Schlatt arrives, leading the group to his mansion. He had Connor press "Schlatt's very special button," after which Connor is pulled away with a fishing rod and seemingly kidnapped by Schlatt. The cast was then urged to find three Nether Stars in order to free Connor from Schlatt's clutches. This ended up simply being a ruse with no real end goal, as everyone has subsequently taken between Connor's disappearance and the retrieval of the three Nether Stars ended up being alright. Connor and Schlatt explain that they had worked together in order to trick the cast into coming below the mansion to party.

While he was walking around the SMP, he saw Little Penis Land being replaced with a graveyard. Angered by this, Connor left a sign stating that he is evicting the graveyard from his land, calling the members who built it "colonizers" and "racists". During the stream, he also visited

   Around May 27, Connor was found visiting Las Nevadas on his own by Quackity &amp; Slimecicle. Then Quackity would ask him why. Connor answered that he had heard about a new city and wanted to check it out, saying he thought some friends of his might be here. He seems to recognize Slimecicle, remarking about how he found a job, and seems to be disappointed when Slime doesn’t recognize him.

   Slime and Quackity continue to peer pressure Connor into gambling, and Slime shows him how to use the slot machine. Connor tries and wins three diamonds, which he says he’s going to invest in because his family is falling apart. Slime urges him to gamble more, which Connor complies with. Connor starts to get worried and tries to tell the two that he should stop as he’s going to run out of money soon.

   Slime pulls out a sword, telling Connor that he can’t leave, which makes Connor panic and agree to keep gambling. This happens a few more times as Connor tries to get them to let him stop, only to be threatened again into continuing.

   On an unknown date, Connor was imprisoned in Pandora's Vault on account of "stolen valor" for using a fake military ID at a Chick-fil-A. He was locked in one of the lower-security cells, where Ranboo would eventually be put as well. During this time, Connor talked "too much" with Ranboo, apparently making him feel overwhelmed about his imprisonment.
   Ranboo has said that Connor "will tell you everything you

      When Connor could not find the entrance to the roof of the Nether on the server, he ran into BadBoyHalo near the rebuilt Community House. From there, Bad showed Connor to the roof pathway, with a bit of a scuffle over swearing along the way. After this point, though, Bad follows him to the jungle ice path, back, then out to where Connor places his new nether portal, and then all the way back to the SMP's main area. Connor then stated that he liked Bad to his chat, saying that he is his new Minecraft friend.

       , Connor agreed (albeit through Tommy threatening him with an axe) that the former vice-president could have his home back. He also told Tommy that, while he was still traumatized from the prior kidnapping, he felt that Tommy was not a bad person, just conflicted.

       When Connor held a party, Tommy called his party lame and asked Connor to give him one reason to stay. Connor answered by saying that he wouldn't be Tommy's friend if Tommy didn't stay at the party, which worked in convincing Tommy to stay. At least until Connor's party house was destroyed. Connor later regretted inviting Tommy to the party, saying that Tommy ruined his party.

       In Connor's diary, when Tommy died he wrote that he missed him, showing that Connor cares about Tommy.

      While Connor was being held hostage by Tommy and Technoblade in exchange for Technoblade's weapons, Tubbo only stood by and watched helplessly even when Connor was crying out for help. He did give back Techno's weapons in exchange for Connor's life, but did not directly try to stop and try to save him when there were so many openings.

       Connor has outright stated his distaste for Tubbo's uselessness and has declared that he will not be voting for Tubbo in the next elections. Tubbo, baffled, responded that he was not even a citizen of L'Manberg.
