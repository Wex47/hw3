   while mining out his statue room before December 6, 2020. Since then, it has grown much larger and exhibits a strange phenomenon of weeping vines and tendrils that have been found across different locations of the SMP. The Egg appears to be sentient, talking to the infected in a strange language and also conversing with Foolish in English. Bad revealed during the
   Red Banquet
   that the Egg can indeed hatch, but it is unknown what it would hatch into.

    Blood Vines
   </b>
   , consist of nether wart blocks, crimson nylium, red wool, redstone, shroomlights, and more recently, red nether bricks, netherrack, and magma blocks. They reek of iron, and taste like metal. They appear to be slowly growing across the SMP, although recently with help from the infected, the vines are gradually being destroyed across the entire server except for the statue room. Notably, no vines have been seen in the outer parts of the server such as
   Technoblade's cabin
   , with the exceptions being Sam's base and
   Snowchester
   (where they were planted).

   There are two factions which have been formed because of the Egg: the
   Eggpire
   made of  members who have been controlled by the Egg to worship the Egg and use forceful ways to recruit other people, and the Pro-Omelette started by
   CaptainPuffy
   , which is made of people trying to stop the Egg growing and reverse its effects on the Eggpire's members.

   Fundy has theorized that the Egg is somehow related to
   Dreamons
   , as the trophy room was originally dug by BadBoyHalo to assist the
   Dreamon Hunters
   .

   The Egg has the ability to communicate with people in strange whispers from an unknown language. Some of those affected by it have the ability to articulate, hear and understand the Egg's whispers, eventually being entranced by the Egg and obeying it. Others, however, may develop an instinctive dislike for the Egg while yet others are completely unaffected by it. The Egg manipulates people by promising to grant their deepest desires.

   The members of the Eggpire have been promised things in return for serving the Egg. Ant was promised power, Punz was promised chaos, Bad was promised Skeppy, and Ponk was promised comfort. Hannah is the only member who was never offered something by the Egg.

  <p key="32c6f99a-6790-4f22-b0d8-aad0b30c7d6b">
   This may be the reason why Tommy does not seem as affected as others have been, since he already had everything he ever wanted, such as the discs in his ender chest.

   People corrupted by the Egg will start showing more affection to the egg. Gradually, they will become more and more subservient to the Egg, until they have no personal identity, doing anything and everything for the Egg. They are prompted to spread the corruption through placing crimson nylium and crimson roots, the main source for the blood vines outside the statue room. However, it is also possible that the vines travel through spores collected on those who have recently visited the Egg, as mentioned by
   Sam
   , who was quick to wash himself and others who interacted with it off with holy water from
   Church Prime
   .

   The corrupted seem to only be affected when the Egg is uncovered, as encasing the Egg with obsidian released the members from the trance. This is, so far, the only known method to stop the Egg's influence, but was abandoned after the Egg grew larger after absorbing the obsidian. Members freed from corruption can fall back under it again.

   After performing experiments using wool with the vines, it was observed that the vines had the ability to turn blue objects red and red objects white, while the color white was unaffected by the vines. This was notably observed when
   Skeppy
   turned red after being trapped with the egg for a certain amount of time. Following Bad,
   Antfrost
   and
   Punz
   's possession, the red on Bad's clothes turned white, and Ant's blue eyes slowly shifted into purple, before turning into red. Punz and Ponk's eyes both turned from blue and brown respectively to red, while the black stripes on Punz's jacket and his medallion turned red as well. When Hannah was possessed, the red on her clothing turned into shades of black, grey, and white, and her house ended up also becoming monotoned and drained. The vines also appear to turn regular water into lava.

   The Egg has the ability to corrode any barricade that encloses it. This can be observed when the Egg was surrounded with obsidian which corroded into crying obsidian over time until it was absorbed by the Egg, making it larger. It is unknown if this only applies to obsidian, as other blocks do not seem to affect the Egg's influence.

   After being dealt great damage (e.g. explosions from TNT), the Egg will slowly repair itself with magma blocks, hurting anyone who steps on it. The Egg has also learned to defend itself by attacking anyone who tries to chip off a part of the main source. It first did this to Puffy, but not

   However, after Puffy accidentally set off a creeper explosion in the Egg room resulting in partial damage to some of the vines, the vines encased themselves in crying obsidian to act as a shield, returning to their natural state a few seconds later. The Eggpire revealed during the

   that they had managed to give the Egg this ability after
   Quackity's
   attempt to blow up the Egg.

   For a time the Egg seemed to have no effect on
   Skeppy
   , as he was only opposed to it due to the affects it had on his friends and felt nothing near the Egg. However when Skeppy got trapped in the Egg he became heavily brainwashed by it, negating this immunity.

  <p key="a6c0ed87-0e21-4bd1-bbf1-712f55c47100">
   When Tommy was shown the Egg by Bad and Antfrost, despite not wearing a Hazmat suit, he appeared to be immune to the Egg's influence. One possible reason for this was his wish at the time to stay indifferent to conflict - when told by
   Sam Nook
   to be the 'hero', destroy the Egg and save everyone, he came to the realization that breaking the Egg 'would cause the biggest war on the server' as from his perspective that the Egg hadn't hurt anyone yet, and people seemed to like it. Instead, he took a piece of the Egg to try and draw attention to his hotel, much to Sam Nook's disapproval, which remains in his ender chest.

  <p key="1b59b442-8fa1-43e1-aa57-eb71d7a02c90">
   Once
   Ponk
   was no longer influenced by the Crimson, he appeared immune to the effects. When Bad tried to drop him into the obsidian box near the Egg, he was unaffected and started fooling around and asking for pastries. When Ponk was released, he started speaking fluent French. However, after coming to believe Sam had cheated on him, he became vulnerable to its influence once again. He is currently likely under the Egg's control.

   Ranboo initially believed himself to be immune to the Egg's influence, never hearing it speak, but after temporarily being stuck in the cage above it, confronted the Egg, hearing and understanding what it said. The Egg seemed to know about his internal conflict, calling him a traitor and mentioning
   Dream
   . However it is unclear if this was actually the Egg, as Ranboo has experienced auditory hallucinations before. Ranboo considered destroying the Egg, but didn't due to worries it would harm those under its control.

    Obsidian - Known to slow the growth of the egg/vines. If the egg is encased in obsidian, its powers are stopped. No vines grow, and no members are influenced. However, it is not a permanent solution. Over time, the obsidian cracks, turning into crying obsidian and eventually being absorbed into the egg. Obsidian was used in the containing of the egg and in the creation of the airlock to the cavern. However, the containment also concentrated the egg's power, making it stronger once removed.

    Soul Fire - Soul fire, a type of fire that burns only on soul sand or soul soil blocks, appears to kill the blood vines, turning them to stone. This was seen near

    Holy water from Church Prime - Used to protect from the influence of the egg. After washing off in the holy water, those who have come into contact with the egg/vines are rid of its influence. However, the effect seems to be less effective over time with more visits to the chamber. The inability of the creation of an infinite source of holy water outside the church leads to the theory that it could become diluted. Holy water may not always remove the corruption. This is shown when Hannah drank a lot of holy water after her long exposure, yet still succumbed to the corruption and betrayed the pro-omelette.

   Many years before the events of the SMP,
   a masquerade
   was held by an odd rich character known as Sir Billiam III. Karl landed in his mansion during one of his time-traveling episodes and managed to convince him that he was rich enough to attend the masquerade. Many guests arrived for the party, some of whom Sir Billiam already knew. During the party, however, strange power outages started happening during which people were murdered. The guests tried to find the murderer, but failed and the only people left at the end were Sir Billiam, his butler and Karl. Sir Billiam then led Karl to a strange and eerie room behind a painting. He was revealed to have protected a mysterious and familiar egg behind the painting and revealed he fed poor people to it to satisfy its hunger. He had actually held the party to gather people whom the Egg would consume. He went on to reveal that the Egg has some sort of power to control and manipulate others. The Egg “persuaded” the party attendants to slaughter each other. Sir Billiam recognized himself as the guardian of the Egg, as he found it inside an abandoned and run-down mansion and had renovated and built around it. He then told Karl that the Egg was hungry and needed another sacrifice. Despite Karl protesting that he was a rich person, he was chased down and murdered by Sir Billiam's butler.

   In the Dream SMP. the Egg was first found inside

   by BadBoyHalo at an unknown time when he was expanding his statue room. On December 6, 2020, he revealed it to Dream and Sam, who each claimed to have never seen it before.
   Bad slowly grew an attachment to it despite Sam and Dream stating that the Egg looked mysterious and was potentially a threat.

   Shortly after, a clump of vines was seen forming outside

   BadBoyHalo and Skeppy's mansion

   In every encounter, Bad was seen protecting the Egg. He also complimented it, using words such as "pretty" and "majestic" to describe it. He even nicknamed it his baby. All other members who saw the vines took an immediate dislike towards it, with the exceptions of Captain Puffy, Ponk, and Antfrost, who seemed to understand why Bad was protecting it. Bad and Antfrost were the only members able to listen to the Egg, and they stated that the Egg expressed that it would kill the two if someone were to try to destroy the vines. Following their hypnosis, Bad and Antfrost planted vines at
   Punz's tower
   and Sam's base in both George and Sapnap's rooms. Punz later destroyed the segments of the vines planted within his territory. Over time, Captain Puffy also began to get corrupted by the Egg. She appeared to be mesmerized by the Egg and nicknamed it "Eggy."

  <p key="05dc6db4-1c65-4dea-adda-34ff46323f56">
   Bad and Ant attempted to convince others to listen to their instructions and stare at the Egg. Sam, concerned for his friends, tried to convince them to remove the Egg but failed to do so. He attempted to remove the Egg himself but was intercepted by Bad and Ant. Punz witnessed their fight and stopped to converse with them, ending the fight. Bad and Ant led Punz to the Egg with Sam accompanying them, and Punz found the egg strange but figured it was harmless and left the area with Sam to continue decorating for Christmas.

   While decorating, Punz explained that he also viewed the Egg as a potential threat and that he was pretending to be passive in order to not cause conflict. Sam believed that the two of them could take Bad and Ant in a fight and destroy the Egg before anything happened, but Punz disagreed and believed they should wait and observe first. The two agreed to not do anything about the egg and vines until they obtained more allies.

   It appeared that Ponk had also taken an affinity towards the Egg and had been partially corrupted by it. In his casino, he found a crimson nylium sheltered in a glass box called "Lil’ Red." and described it as cute. After finding more vines at
   Thiccatron
   , he started finding it weird but didn't bother to take them down. Upon finding the Egg in the statue room, Ponk touched it. However, unlike Punz, he said he heard the Egg make a growling sound and found it creepy. In another stream with Sam, he agreed with Sam's idea that the egg and vines were "bad juju." In addition, Ponk was also creeped out by the ones who became mesmerized by the Egg. Nonetheless, Ponk didn't remove the vines after it grew and still worked directly next to it. Even with his care for the vines, he later warned Jack Manifold to be careful around them and to bathe in the water at Church Prime should he ever touch the vines.

After Ponk informed Jack of Church Prime's cleansing effects, Jack returned to the Egg with the intention of farming primes.

Sam threatened to destroy parts of it, claiming that it was going to continue to infect things and that they had to deal with it before it got out of hand. While down in the statue room,
   Sapnap
   joined Sam, agreeing that they needed to get rid of it. He suggested using TNT, and together, he and Sam blew up a small portion of the Egg. Bad was horrified, checking on the Egg and seeing if he could rebuild it. He then relayed to Sam that it had made the Egg angry, pointing at the cracked sections comprised of magma blocks. Sapnap then stood on one saying that the Egg was hurting him. Bad suggested that Sam or Sapnap sacrifice themselves to the Egg because it needed flesh. However, Sam and Sapnap retreated to Church Prime to cleanse themselves in the water. Bad and Puffy later wrapped the Egg with obsidian as a precaution. On his return to the prison, Sam encountered Skeppy, who asked for his help clearing out the vines. Skeppy revealed that his and Bad's mansion had been taken over by them.

   After the Egg was encased, Bad realized that he didn't feel as attached to the Egg as before. This was shown with his surprisingly calm response to Skeppy telling him that he had broken the vines in their house. After mining some vines and not feeling the uncomfortable effect of doing so, Bad and Puffy realized that the Egg's influence had ceased. Ant was alarmed when he saw them removing the vines and reluctantly joined them before agreeing that the vine attachment was weaker. The group, along with Skeppy, traveled to the Egg to remove more of its vines. However, in the process, Skeppy grew curious as to what the Egg looked like and broke a piece of the obsidian. Immediately, Bad, Puffy, and Ant went back to being protective of the Egg. Skeppy realized what he had done and asked for them to have some alone time to conform with the Egg. The others complied and exited the room. Shortly after returning, the three felt something was different. It was then discovered that Skeppy had covered the Egg in obsidian again, trapping himself inside in the process. The group thought of ideas to free Skeppy without destroying the obsidian while mining every vine on the server, but failed to develop a plan.

   The next day, Bad attempted to free Skeppy on his own. Bad mined two blocks of obsidian, opening up a tunnel connected to the wall behind him. After successfully breaking the two pieces, Bad instructed Skeppy to run out before quickly covering the hole again. He managed to free Skeppy, but due to prolonged contact with the Egg, Skeppy's color changed to red. In addition, Skeppy spoke in a monotone voice having no emotions or desires other than returning to the Egg. Bad then called Puffy for help. The two tried to stop Skeppy from going back in the Egg by making Skeppy remember when he used to be blue. As the first attempt, Bad gave fourteen (an ongoing meme on Skeppy's channel) diamond blocks. However, the red Skeppy burned all the diamonds in fire. In the next attempt, Bad gave Skeppy sand (a block Skeppy loved). Nonetheless, Skeppy destroyed the sand. Unhappy with Bad, Skeppy then destroyed the statue of him built by Bad. As a last attempt, Bad tried to make him jealous by making "Discount Skeppy" (Puffy with Skeppy's skin) stand on a crafting table. The plan still failed, and red Skeppy remained unaffected.

   Skeppy then ordered Bad and Puffy to put all of their stuff in a chest and then attempted to kill them both. He successfully killed Bad, but Puffy managed to kill Skeppy with a sword she secretly kept. In killing red Skeppy, Puffy gained possession of Tommy's disc, "Cat" and gave the disc to Bad. After Skeppy respawned, Bad returned the disc to Skeppy. After regaining items, Skeppy fled to the forest. There, he declared that he had moved out of the mansion and built
   his own house
   , inviting Bad and Puffy to move in with him. The two, losing hope, accepted the offer, and Bad became emotional because he lost the Skeppy he knew.

   On December 21, Bad and Ant began experimenting on the Egg. They placed red, white, and blue wool near the Egg. After some time, they returned and observed that the red wool had been sapped of its color, the white wool remained unchanged, and the blue had been turned red.

   With the help of Punz, Bad went to uncover the Egg. In order to protect Bad from being put under the Egg's influence again, Punz suggested that they wear the uniforms from Church Prime, as water from the church often had positive effects in curbing the effects of the blood vines. After they uncovered it, they discovered that it had apparently "eaten" the second layer of obsidian placed over it, growing substantially since it was covered in the first place. Bad deduced that it had grown at least four blocks bigger since they'd covered it. It was also covered in darker patches of red resembling nether wart bricks, and the water they'd placed inside along with the red and white wool had been turned to lava, and Bad collected the lava for later sampling. The two began to wonder if it was even an Egg, or maybe in reality, some sort of seed.

   After returning to Church Prime to wash off under the water, they contacted Ant, relaying what they'd discovered. Donning their uniforms once again, Ant joined Punz and Bad to take a look at the Egg. They ultimately decided to keep it uncovered, instead sealing it inside the statue room itself, with obsidian being placed over all of the entrances, along with creating an area to decontaminate with Church Prime water.

   While inside the statue room, Bad found that the blue wool that had been turned red by the power of the Egg, and then had been placed under church prime water had turned back to blue. This left him optimistic that he might still be able to turn Skeppy back to his normal self.

   On December 30, 2020, Bad and Eret decided to venture into the statue room with the Egg to collect gunpowder from the chests for Eret's firework project. Bad asked Eret about his knowledge of the Egg and its vines, and Eret mentioned that he was disturbed by their presence. Bad and Eret went to Church Prime to put on the church uniforms/hazmat suits as a precaution. Bad told Eret that they couldn't spend too long in the statue room, or else the uniforms would begin to lose their effectiveness. Bad also commented that he hadn’t been down in the room since the last time he and Punz had uncovered and isolated the Egg. As they entered the room, they went through the decontamination chamber first, rinsing themselves in holy water.

  <p key="f4db8a79-7502-40ff-ac3e-efa659523bde">
   When they entered the statue room, they discovered that the Egg had grown even larger and that the vines from the Egg had reappeared and grown rapidly, spreading further than ever before and covering a large portion of the room. Magma blocks had begun to reappear around the base of the Egg and rows upon rows of long red vines extended from the ceiling. Bad and Eret were shocked at the sudden growth of the Egg and quickly collected the gunpowder they needed, before leaving the room immediately and rinsing themselves off with holy water. As they walked back to Church Prime to return the uniforms, Bad showed Eret the vines that he had left on top of Punz’s tower, telling him that if those vines started growing, there had been a containment breach in the statue room. Eret decided to rinse the gunpowder that they had collected in the holy water in Church Prime, just in case there were still spores or remnants of the Egg on the items.

   A few days later, Bad checked on the Egg again, this time with Quackity. Bad noticed that the blood vines had spread even further across the ceiling and towards the other corner of the statue room, and had also started to cover the statues of Bad and Skeppy. Bad was concerned that there could be a containment breach in the future as the vines were creeping closer towards the entrance of the decontamination chamber that he had set up.

   When Puffy went to check on the Egg alone on January 3, 2021, it had nearly reached the obsidian airlock. Even though she wore the Church Prime "hazmat suit," she did not seem completely immune to the Egg's effects as she still talked about it in a positive way, calling it "Eggy." After washing off in holy water (both the ones in the airlock and the source water at the church) she came upon

This lead to the theory that the Crimson's effects may be amplifying or mutating in a manner to have residual effects on the host. This was not seen when Bad and Quackity checked on it a few days prior, possibly due to Puffy entering alone.

   On January 9, 2021, Bad went by himself to check on the Egg and discovered that the blood vines were now covering the entire room, although the Egg itself didn't appear to have changed size. As he walked closer to the Egg, he found out that the Skeppy statue had been corrupted and was now completely red, and his own statue was being drained of its red colour, turning white. He became enticed by the red Skeppy statue and approached it slowly, before realizing that he was falling under the Egg's spell again. He hurried out of the room and towards Church Prime, while desperately resisting the urge to go back and look at the red Skeppy statue. As he cleansed himself from the effects of the Egg in the holy water at the church, he speculated that the potency of the Egg’s effects within the statue room had become even stronger ever since he isolated it. He decided to organize a meeting with members who had come into contact with the Egg, such as Ant, Sam, Puffy, and Eret, to discuss their next plan of action.

   After showing Ant the damage done to the server while he was gone, Bad took Ant to see the Egg. What was once a containable spread had turned into a massive infection, with the Egg now having grown to consume all of statue room. Ant was shocked at the growth, questioning why Bad couldn't have contained it any better, and Bad protesting that he had done as much as he could. They tried to evaluate what they could do next when Skeppy suddenly logged on, catching them both off guard.

   On January 14, 2021, Bad, Punz, Ant, and Puffy met up to discuss what they would do with the Egg. Bad proposed that the group release the Egg and its vines, saying that the Egg would only get more potent and would breach containment anyway, as well as arguing that it would be beneficial to the Badlands due to the chaos it would cause around the server. Ant was in full agreement with Bad, and while hesitant at first, Punz also agreed. It took much longer to convince Puffy, but she eventually complied.

   While the group was destroying the Egg's containment, Punz lost all previous hesitation toward the plan and said that he loved the chaos it would cause, and even encouraged the planting of the vine's seeds in the L'Canyon. This led to Puffy voicing her concerns about it, saying she didn't know how chaos would lead to peace. However, Bad shut her down, claiming that the chaos caused would only be temporary and that the Badlands would unite the server as well as kill the vines later on. He showed her the Egg, and told her to let it show her the power. While he was staring at the Egg, Puffy wrote in her book not to trust the Egg, no matter what anyone said.

Ant and Bad appeared and tried to trap Tommy and Tubbo with the Egg, which almost worked because Tommy complied and told Tubbo to run away until Sam Nook intervened and got them away, going to Church Prime.

   The next day, Puffy was in a state of distress hoping Sam was okay and Tommy found her and they agreed to break him out. She and Tommy went down to the Egg and destroyed the cage, letting Sam free. However, Sam’s usual red gem on his crown seemed to be beating or pulsing in a way, as described by Puffy. In addition, Sam started speaking and acting strangely, and it was almost as if his motivation and dedication was sapped or drained. He told them that the Egg took all of his stuff and he told her he wanted it to stay. Apparently when he ran out of food, he was forced to eat his own flesh. Horrified, Puffy and Tommy quickly left with him. When they reached Sam's house, they found a small vine growing inside. Before Puffy could destroy it, Sam told her he wanted it to stay.

   Sam, after recovering from the Egg's possession, destroyed the blood vines that grew in his base. The Egg continuously whispered to him during this, telling him that the Egg could protect Fran. Sam then got rid of the Blood Vines with TNT and his tools, burning the remains of the Egg with Soul Fire and goes to Fran, protecting/encasing her in the wall. He then visits the Egg room, implying that it has grown a lot and tried to get close to the Egg when Antfrost showed up. Sam acted like he had been corrupted and asked Antfrost what the Egg had told him when BadBoyHalo came as well. Sam tried to get the two to tell him what the Egg had said to them but didn't manage to get them to speak. Sam then told them that the Egg had wanted Sam to go somewhere and was given a spore from Antfrost, telling Sam to spread it. Sam then left awkwardly and tossed the spore away while running out of the Egg room.

Techno went down to the Egg with Bad and the two talked. Techno heard the Egg speaking but the voices in his head drowned it out.

Bad pearled away and Techno dropped down his trident for Ranboo. Although it took some convincing, Ranboo escaped from the Egg. Puffy and Techno also named her loose resistance against the Egg, calling it the 'Pro-Omelette' in reference to Techno joking about eating the Egg.

Ant decided they should have a celebration because they could finally move into the final phase of the Eggpire’s plan.

The Egg told Bad and Ant that it liked Hannah and didn't want them to kill her. Instead they trapped her in the obsidian cage above the Egg and stated that she would be there for a while.

When they reached her house, Hannah tried to convince Sam not to destroy the vines, despite the fact that they'd almost destroyed all of her roses. Hannah said the Egg was making her punch Sam, be rather angry and more, and Sam tried to convince Hannah about how harmful the Egg could be to her.

After exploring everywhere, she discovers her own house and comments on the beauty of it - saying it looks like something she would do. Hannah says she needs to build a house out of pink wood before it is too late. She harvested crimson wood at the community tree farm, and started building a house near Fundy's gameshow set. Realizing that she didn't have enough wood, Hannah went in search for more and said she felt a pull to a certain area, meaning the wood must be there. It turns out to be the Egg and it started speaking to her - telling her to come and join it. Hannah didn't want to join, but still thought that the materials for her house were in there so she entered. Before she went, Sam arrived and slowly led her away.

  <p key="24deb948-c787-493e-a0f5-14a5f450e3cb">
   Hannah told Sam that the last time he met him, she was about to go to sleep. Sam remembers, and Hannah tells him that she was searching for wood for her house. Sam, confused tells her that she had already had a house, and Hannah starts thinking that she had been dreaming, and that she woke up in the server. Sam tells her that she had joined a few months ago, while Hannah repeats that she had just joined. Sam shows Hannah's first house, and states that she had built it. He also tells her that she had made the path to the house, along with the cakes along it. Sam also tells her that she was the manager of the bank, and Hannah seems to remember. Hannah tells him that she was building her house, while Sam tells her that she had already had a house. Hannah seems to remember her old house, and Sam reminds her of her animals, and the two go to Hannah's graveyard. They found all Hannah's animals gone, and the sheep pen broken. Hannah remembers her animals, and repeats that she had fallen asleep, and had woke up in the server. Sam states that she had been on the server for a while, and Hannah tells Sam that she was searching for wood in the Egg room for her house. Hannah accuses Sam of stealing her animals, but they find the rest of her animals are safe. Hannah then takes Sam to her new house, and Sam destroys it with TNT. Sam tells Hannah that she already had a house, and Hannah argues that her dream told her to build the house, and had instructed her to get crimson wood from the Egg room. Hannah hits Sam with a sword, and the two clear the remains of the house. She starts thinking that she had been sleepwalking a few times, and Sam tells her to get rest, and that she needed to get her things. Hannah asks Sam if he had removed part of the crewmate statue at the bank, and Sam replies that he didn't. Sam states that he would be working on the bank soon, and asks Hannah if she could still work as the bank manager. Hannah states that she could still be the manager of the bank, and promises to get some rest. She gave Sam some obsidian to keep her inside her house, which he reluctantly does. After this, Sam no longer hasd his trust in Hannah - knowing how hard the Egg has tried to get her corrupted.

   On April 7, 2021, BadBoyHalo began to remove some of the vines due to the negative image of the Eggpire. On the same day BadBoyHalo and Antfrost revealed that they were planning a
   Red Banquet
   in the statue room and claimed it was an attempt at peace. They sent out the invites the same day, starting with Sam who agreed to go. They then asked Foolish, who was extremely wary of them but eventually also agreed to go. Finally they asked Puffy, who eagerly agreed to join them as she believed that her friends were finally back to normal. Once it was over, Bad told Ant that everyone who came to the Red Banquet would have a new perspective on everything.
  </p>
  <p key="aba06d12-6b2f-4728-b16a-602570c28ff3">
   Over the span of about a week leading up to the Banquet, The Eggpire invited other members of the server to come. Eret was invited by Bad as an honorary guest and they promised to dress up for the occasion. Sapnap was invited by Bad as well, who agreed to come as Bad is his adoptive father. Hannah was fixing up her house to hide weapons in the walls for Pro-Omelette when Ant showed up and invited her to the Banquet - she at first denied due to being scared of the Egg room, but eventually accepted because Pro-Omelette wanted her there.

   Quackity entered a series of underground tunnels near the Egg made of nether brick using information from a secret source. He took several stacks of TNT from his enderchest. Quackity mined through the hallway, and arrived in the statue room. He then layered the Egg, the surrounding area, and the entrance to the Egg room with TNT.
  </p>
  <p key="48a9d367-fd9e-4d0b-aff4-0cbbb783f6d0">
   Quackity went to light the TNT, but was spotted by Bad and Punz. Quackity returned to the hallway, and threatened to light the TNT. He continued placing TNT as he backtracked, but Bad and Punz followed him into the hallway. Bad told Quackity that he couldn't get in the way of the Egg, as it would get in the way of his mission; without the Egg, he has nothing. Bad commanded Punz to go after Quackity, and the two cornered him in the hallway. Quackity still threatened to light the TNT, and ordered Punz to leave him and Bad alone. Quackity told Bad they had to get rid of the Egg, but Bad said that Quackity didn't know what would be brought down on him. Quackity thought for a second, but lit the TNT, destroying the area.

   After the TNT explodes, lava is seen all around the hallway, and a figure is traversing the caves to get out with just a redstone torch. The Egg's voices can be heard.

   On April 18, 2021, BadBoyHalo went into the Egg Room that had been decorated with a table and a dance floor in preparation for the Red Banquet. He noticed Skeppy on top of the Egg and tried to coax him down, to which Skeppy refused, telling Bad to leave him alone. When trying to convince Skeppy to go on a walk with him, Bad said that if Skeppy hadn't been there when Quackity tried to blow up the Egg, it would have been destroyed. Bad pleaded with Skeppy, telling him to stay away from the Egg. Skeppy yelled back, calling him selfish for not wanting him to spend time with the Egg. Bad retaliated in disbelief and shock, demanding Skeppy to apologize for calling him selfish after all the sacrifices he's made for their friendship. Skeppy refused and Bad punched him a couple of times before finally punching him into a small pool of lava while yelling, “ It’s just a stupid egg Skeppy,” killing him and taking his first canon life. Bad stood in horror and shock for a few seconds before blacking out.

  <p key="411a2a7d-1ce0-44a9-aaff-dcc4232676d6">
   The Red Banquet took place on April 25, 2021. BadBoyHalo, Antfrost, and Ponk welcomed all the guests and gave them appetizers and drinks. After partying for a bit, they all went to the long table to have the main course presented by Ponk. Some of the guests made speeches. As Bad was presenting his speech, lava was pouring down, trapping everyone in a small part of the Egg Room. Bad ended his toast with “Prepare to die.” All the guests were in shock and panicking as Bad led them to the Egg to tell them the real plan behind the Banquet. Puffy was the angriest as she thought she could trust her friends once more. The Egg needed to hatch, and to do so, it needed energy from deaths that were caused near it.
  </p>
  <p key="86aff476-a7b4-4f19-b542-5ceff9750863">
   CaptainPuffy had enough and went to the secret chest she planted under the table that had weapons and armor, but found out they were gone. Hannah revealed that she was on the Eggpire’s side and gave the armor to the Eggpire. Sam had another trick up his sleeve and set up a TNT trap above the Egg, but it failed. After the events of Quackity’s explosion, the Egg had explosion-proof, turning to crying obsidian and back to normal if exploded. Bad was going to sacrifice Eret first, but chose Foolish after he said he was going to destroy the Egg with lightning, but nothing happened. Antfrost killed Foolish while Puffy was screaming at him to stop. Bad and Ant blamed his death on Puffy because none of this would’ve happened if she didn’t leave the Eggpire.
  </p>
  <p key="f0a6693c-00c5-4aee-86ba-9cee21af3773">
   Later, Quackity joined and tried to convince Bad to stop and let everyone go, but he wouldn’t budge. Quackity secretly gave an axe to Puffy and killed Antfrost with it. Technoblade followed by his Hound Army and Purpled joined and a fight broke loose, causing the Eggpire to retreat. The Eggpire fled through a nearby tunnel and split up, in case Purpled was hunting them down. Bad got on a boat and started to regret what he had done at the Banquet. Purpled, Technoblade, and Quackity lead the guests to safety and plan to lock the Egg away and experiment on it to see if it can be neutralized or destroyed in another way.

   For the next four months, the Egg remained contained without causing any problems. Sam wanted to move the Egg into the bank that he was building to secure it better. He requested Tommy's help with finding a vulnerable spot near the Egg to uproot it. During their experiments, Tommy discovered the Egg's protective capabilities and found out that he could no longer break the Egg without taking damage, like before. It was revealed that all of the vines in the statue room had gained the protective capabilities. He freaked out and they left the room.

Following the containment of the Egg, sometime in the near future he regretted what he did in the Red Banquet, possibly showing his detachment from the egg.

He does the Egg's bidding and is able to understand the Egg's speech. He is currently unable to enter the vicinity of Church Prime for unknown reasons. When Bad tried to corrupt Quackity, Quackity told him to learn to control the Egg so he can control the people. Bad mentioned that the Egg wouldn't like it but he would do it if it benefited him. He has been extremely loyal to the Egg by attempting to execute every single order given to him by the Egg.

       Despite his loyalty to the Egg, he has demonstrated some form of underlying resentment and bitterness towards it, snapping at it when it tried to talk to him during his conversation with Skeppy and called it stupid when Skeppy told Bad he wanted to spend more time with it, showing that Bad still cares about Skeppy more than he cares about the Egg.
After being driven away from the egg by Technoblade and Purpled, Bad once again doubted his relationship with the egg, claiming that he wants to hurt anyone and questioning if he was in the wrong for his actions at the Red Banquet. Following the near future, Bad says that he was in the wrong for his actions, possibly showing his detachment from the Egg.

      Hannah was at first not happy about the blood vines, as it was covering her house. It also made her feel faint, sick and unwell. Hannah decided to take this problem with her own hands and visited the Egg, but Antfrost and BadBoyHalo trapped her in a box near the Egg. Sam rescued Hannah from the Egg, at which Hannah felt sort of attached to the Egg, saying it was speaking to her constantly. Sam burnt the remains of the blood vines in Hannah's house, and Hannah stated that it 'hurt' her when he did so. However, Hannah ultimately agreed with Sam that the Egg was a bad thing, but as he left she wondered if what she had said was true.

After this, Ponk was not heard of until Tommy tried stealing a piece of the Egg. Ponk was seen throwing his trident at Tommy and trying to get Tommy away from the Egg.

      Skeppy was previously against the Egg, but was corrupted after being trapped inside for an extended period. Unlike the others who were corrupted by it, he didn't try to get anyone else infected, but instead just wanted to go back inside the obsidian where the Egg was. It seemed that there was still a little bit of Skeppy left in him though, due to Puffy shooting him off a tower with an arrow and him doing an MLG water, something he is known for being good at.

       It is theorized that instead of the Egg acting as voices inside the corrupted's heads, it is directly controlling Skeppy, having taken over his body and turned it red. He was cured later on, however it is unknown whether or not that stream was canon or not. Skeppy is still currently corrupted by the Egg, spending most of his time near it. Bad also mentions that Skeppy is the one who repaired the Egg after
       Quackity

      Sam was one of the first to raise concerns about the Egg and he believes that it should be destroyed as soon as possible, comparing it to something out of a horror movie.

       He headed into his base after changing from Sam Nook and cleared his base from the Blood Vines with TNT and tools. The Egg told Sam that the Egg will hurt Fran, his most beloved pet if Sam didn't comply and join the

Antfrost then gave him a spore of the Egg, telling Sam to spread it and awkwardly left the Egg room, leaving the two. Burning the spore in the nether.

       After Sam went to save Hannah, he discovered that Hannah's house was leeched out of the redness and now was grey and white. Sam wanted to save Hannah from the Egg but was scared of the Egg room in the EXP farm. Sam then went in there, meeting Foolish AFK in the farm and goes in the Egg room, afraid of the Egg and shaking a little bit. Sam frees Hannah from the Egg, after that Sam rescues Hannah and walks her down the Egg, making Hannah follow him to her house in which Hannah hides from the Eggpire members. Sam protects Hannah and questions her why she was running away, she told him that the Egg was calling out to her. Sam assures Hannah that the Egg was bad and Hannah trusts him.

      Puffy used to be corrupted and a strong ally of the Egg, always trying to defend it and nicknaming it 'Eggy' and starting her own version of pogchamp - Eggchamp. Puffy was always complimenting the Egg and filled her house with blood vines so she could be closer to it. When the obsidian was put on the Egg, she awoke from the mind-control and never wanted it to happen again.

       Puffy is extremely concerned about the Egg/Eggpire and how it will impact the server, going so far as to be undercover in the Eggpire to try and stop them. She had seen her friends be corrupted before her very eyes and just wants some peace. 
After she was outed as a spy, Puffy officially broke all ties with the Egg, however she still has influence over the corrupted's actions, with them allowing her to escape and trying to corrupt her instead of killing her, although this.

       Later on, she officially founded 'Pro-Omelette' to fight against the people who were corrupted and recruits Technoblade and Ranboo. She is seen as the 'leader' of the loose resistance and is currently trying to restore the corrupted to how they used to be. She has also worked alongside Sam and Tommy, and shown Eret the Pro-Omelette base who agrees to supply her to lead it. She has destroyed all posters for the Eggpire and replaced them with ones for Pro-Omelette. She was also the one who made the Eggpire HQ to "FUCK THE EGG" because she was frustrated about how they were celebrating the death of a child, with her later booting the entire Eggpire out of Tommy's House and the hotel.

       At the Red Banquet, she believed that they could finally find peace but kept a precaution of weapons hidden in the banquet table. She was always ready to destroy the Egg and never dropped her guard despite everything. Most of the Red Banquet was understandably to set her up, with them all targeting her loved ones. She was forced to watch her son, Foolish, be murdered brutally in front of her whilst she was helpless and unable to do anything. Puffy then killed Ant with an Axe Quackity slipped her without remorse. She was traumatised over her sons death, but made a deal with herself to never be fooled by the Egg ever again.

Other than that, not much is known about how the Egg would affect them. Puffy also showed them her secret pro-omelette base, and they decided to join her resistance.

At first, Quackity believed it was something that could give him the ultimate power he wished to achieve, but he saw far deeper into the Crimson than any other mortal has on the server. He saw the Crimson corrupting Bad's mind, clouding it. Out of fear, Quackity fled, scared of the effects and symptoms of the Crimson. He was helped in his escape by Karl. He later discussed the Egg with Bad, saying he would definitely get in its way.
