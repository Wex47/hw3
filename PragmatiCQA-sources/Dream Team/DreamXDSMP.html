   DreamXD's in-game appearance is the exact same as
   Dream's
   casual wear - a white smiley-face blob on a bright-green background. As the smiley-face blob is canonically a mask worn by Dream, the same is likely true for DreamXD. This is because Dream was the first human he saw. It takes a lot of energy for him to appear in his human form and to talk to someone when they are awake.

  <p key="3a4b8547-d57d-42cf-84bd-f7fc546c1ba6">
   Due to the fact that he is a god, he has canonical access to creative mode. In addition, he is able to send other people to hell, as showcased when he did so with
   Niki
   . He also claims to be a part of Dream.

   Technoblade's
   portal. He also can be protective, as shown by him making sure
   George
   doesn't get hurt. However, he also has a malevolent side of him, where his voice deepens and he becomes extremely aggressive. He also takes offense very easily, usually smiting anyone who critizises him.

   DreamXD first joined the Dream SMP during the
   Dreamon events
   , appearing as the
   Dreamon
   who
   Tubbo
   and
   Fundy
   exorcised and subsequently separated from Dream.
   It is unknown if this is still canon.

  <p key="672a4087-6eca-414e-a89e-27e812d0f7b6">
   He later reappeared on January 18, 2021, destroying an end portal to prevent Philza and Technoblade from activating it. Upon Techno and Phil expressing disappointment (in addition to their reassuring DreamXD that they were only going to use it as a table), DreamXD returned and created an intentionally incorrect end portal so that they could not activate it.
  </p>
  <p key="ff125f38-fd00-4fdb-82f6-15999fb37b33">
   On February 26, he reappeared and accompanied
   George
   ,
   Quackity
   , and

   while George tried to build a McDonalds. During this visit, DreamXD seemed to worship Master Oogway and protect George.
  </p>
  <p key="fde9cbcd-8463-4f15-a18a-505cead5582e">
   On March 31, DreamXD appeared in George's
   lore stream
   . He saved him from BadBoyHalo and talked with him for a while. George asked for netherite, and DreamXD switched his voice to a demonic one, accusing George of using him. Later in the day, he asked if they could be friends, and George tried to teach him to behave with other people on the server, as well as how to make jokes. During the stream, DreamXD threatened BadBoyHalo and Niki, convinced it was funny, as George explained to him that he shouldn't do that to people.
   Later, it would be revealed that George was actually sleeping during the entire stream, and that what happened was merely a dream.
  </p>
  <p key="9411b371-5a5b-432e-aee6-1cfc4304863b">
   On May 19, DreamXD returned to join the arguments between
   Foolish
   and Bad at
   L'Sandberg
   . DreamXD smited both Foolish and Bad on numerous occasions and also provided the heads of several users to the pair of them.
   During DreamXD's visit, Bad pointed out how Foolish had built an entire temple with no statue to DreamXD, but Foolish quickly said he already had plans for it and would make it soon. He later made the statue in a special room in his temple.
  </p>
  <p key="19d02c4d-b84e-4b57-8606-c23afc494741">
   On June 21, Dream attempted to use a revive book to revive a still-living Technoblade. DreamXD was summoned, and granted one wish to the two. Technoblade asked for a bell in order to sell out, and DreamXD granted the wish before vanishing.
  </p>
  <p key="327c65c2-a150-4749-9733-aeebcce5f3dc">
   On October 21, DreamXD logged on to gamble with Tubbo, Ponk, Foolish, Ranboo and George. George repeatedly attempted to steal the gambling items and was killed multiple times by the group. DreamXD won most of the gambles, but Tubbo got a Pufferfish Spawn Egg and Ranboo got a chorus plant and endstone block.

    Foolish and the DreamXD statue
   </span>
  </h3>
  <p key="423be021-f1c1-4a8e-a662-06960f1c3f9d">
   On November 23, DreamXD appeared before Foolish as he was at the early stages of building a giant
   DreamXD statue
   that would almost reach build limit height. He ordered Foolish to finish the statue and '
   spread the word of god
   '. He also stated that if Foolish "earned it", he would be able to become a god. However, Foolish would still not be on the same level as DreamXD. Instead, he would have one godly power bestowed upon him
   .
  </p>
  <p key="7db1d024-35bc-45d7-ba0f-9c7288ec7ad7">
   On November 30, DreamXD talked to Foolish as a voice in his head while he was building the statue. Bad, who was also talking to Foolish, was very confused as Foolish seemed to be having a conversation with himself. DreamXD warned Foolish that he had 2 weeks before the statue must be completed, but also stated that he does not know "how long two weeks are", showing that he is unable to perceive time the same way mortals do. He answered a few questions that Foolish had of him, revealing his pastime of "drinking people's souls when they die" and liking "people who kill others", again expressing his rather aggressive side. He referenced his conversation with George from a few months back when he introduced DreamXD to the concept of jokes. He also stated that he talks to people most commonly when they are asleep, explaining why he interacts with George frequently
   .
  </p>
  <p key="25d85311-cc33-4edf-8d27-1ad56238c320">
   On December 3, DreamXD once again spoke to Foolish in his head. He said he was bored and demanded entertainment in the form of death. Foolish promised to keep an eye out for people to kill. DreamXD seemed unaware of simple things such as karoke and pets and decided Foolish was his pet after hearing the definition, which Foolish attempted to argue against. Antfrost showed up dressed as a maid Wallibear attempting to annoy Foolish much to DreamXD's amusement. When DreamXD saw the statue, he was enraged that it was made of dirt before Foolish explained that it was just the first version of it. He swapped the dirt for different blocks such as gold to try out different looks before restoring it. He got bored and gave Antfrost some TNT, and Ant promptly blew up the base of the statue. DreamXD then spawned in many vexes and left Foolish to deal with them.
  </p>
  <p key="afb47236-8092-4272-9f8e-9f190938210e">
   On December 10, DreamXD visited Foolish again to check on the statue.
   Callahan was also visiting Foolish at the time, and DreamXD commented that Callahan was also his pet once, until he wasn't, also implying that he gave Callahan powers. Callahan also seemed to be scared of DreamXD. DreamXD said that the statue was magnificent and eventually said that he would give Foolish one wish. Foolish asked for 'creative mode', to rule the End, world domination, flying, WorldEdit and floating but DreamXD denied all those, some more aggressively than others. While considering the power, they walked around in Foolish's house. DreamXD was disgusted by Foolish's first statue of him but was impressed with his pyramid. He then said he would come back later and that he would kill Bad as well. He later talked in Bad's head and started scaring him.
  </p>
  <p key="a6432912-7065-4952-b91f-dc52bf55ac09">
   He visited again the same day
   He spotted Bad and tried to kill him before kicking him out of Foolish's house. He was disrespected by Eryn, and ordered Foolish to kill him. He made Foolish immortal for the fight (every time he 'died', he would get the same effect as if he was holding a totem), but Eryn mamaged to survive and leave. Then, DreamXD decided to let Foolish keep the immortality as his power, but warned him it would have limited uses. He then decided to call Foolish a friend instead of a pet. He revealed that he had dropped two books into the world a millenium ago, one of them found (the revive book) and the other still undiscovered, but with a different godly power. After some conversation, he left. Foolish spotted Bad near the area. Bad denied having heard anything and accidentally let slip that he was going to search for the book, so Foolish started attacking him but let him go. He then started preparing to find the book himself.

      DreamXD interacts with George more compared to most players. However, he very quickly got angry when George asked for items, saying that he was using him. During a conversation with Foolish, he revealed that he interacted with people usually when they were asleep, which is likely why he interacts with George the most, as George is known to be asleep very frequently.

      DreamXD has interacted with Foolish frequently, possibly because of their shared godhood. He took Foolish's side in the L'Sandberg conflict by smiting Bad repeatedly. He later asked Foolish to build him a statue and to spread the word of God in return for full godhood. He checked on the statue's progress and talked with Foolish about himself, and they bonded over insulting Bad and making jokes about him. Foolish tends to be somewhat outspoken with DreamXD, which has angered him in the past. When DreamXD learned what a pet is from Foolish he decided Foolish was his pet. After the competition of the DreamXD statue, he declared Foolish one of his best friends and also still his pet. Their relationship seems pretty positive, as DreamXD interacts with Foolish more than anyone else.

Later, when he was talking in Foolish's head, Bad assumed Foolish was talking to him and tried to talk back multiple times, causing DreamXD to get slightly annoyed and make jokes with Foolish about him. He later gave Bad nightmares of his family dying repeatedly. He also left another visit with Foolish to avoid him.
