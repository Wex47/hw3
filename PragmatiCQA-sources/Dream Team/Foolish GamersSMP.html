   There are many different types of totems, shark-fused being only one of them. Early in a totem's life there comes a time when one ends up fusing with a specific thing. This could be elemental like fire, or animal like shark. Totem children go through this evolution at 5 years of age. During evolution, it is normal for a totem child to not survive.
   It is implied in different conversations that culturally, totems are very warlike. Totem children are expected to take bullets for their parents. In totem culture, there is a myth about a "pure" totem. This chosen totem is one who has never gone through an evolution and fused with something.
   It is unknown if the chosen totem has any special powers or significance besides being a thing of legend. It is also currently unknown what the difference between a totem of undying and a totem of death is.

   Foolish is a friendly, easy-going, and kind member of the server. He gives netherite ingots with custom names to fellow server members whenever he can. He enjoys building, demonstrated by his large build projects and willingness to help with and give advice on other people's builds. However, he is absent-minded, easily distracted, and not very bright. His pushover nature lets others mess with him and he often goes along with it. This makes him out to be the comedic relief of the server. He gets skittish when scared or stressed, and keeps to himself unless someone else strikes first. Nevertheless, he is a pacifist and refuses to kill, although will make an exception for sacrifices and indirect killings. This also extends to his naively forgiving nature, where he is willing to give second, third, and fourth chances to people. Because of experiencing death for the first time, Foolish is fearful and uncomfortable around the subject. However, after joining

   , Foolish has resolved to find a balance between pacifism and violence, so he can protect people close to him. Also, at times, Foolish can have a quick temper, which could be a hint at his old self's hot-headedness.

   Foolish was once an A-class warrior and a "totem of death". He had been tasked with an "easy job": a peaceful heist with a big reward and no innocents. It was related to
   The Village That Went Mad
   . According to one of the villager's diary entries, Foolish was called the "strange man" with a "body made out of straw but eyes of emerald". Apparently, Foolish was fascinated by lemons. He introduced the villagers to a new land of sand and gold, brought them a caravan of unknown good, and gifted them 21 statues. He also talked about ancient magic. Eventually, the villagers murder each other and the Village is last seen on fire. It is implied that Foolish is to blame for driving the Villagers "mad", though a further explanation for this is not yet provided. This is supported by

When the dinner begins, Foolish starts the toast, saying he is sick of hearing "let bygones be bygones" and that he is "all about second or third chances...in the hope of something new and promising" for the

   . However, when it is BadBoyHalo's turn to toast, Foolish along with the guests are trapped with the Egg by lava. Hannah had also betrayed them for the Eggpire by giving up the backup weapons and armor. Before Eret could become the first to be sacrificed to the egg, Foolish stepped forward to destroy the Egg with lightning, only to find out that his powers are suppressed in the Egg's territory
   . He was the only sacrifice at the banquet, killed by Antfrost near the Egg right in front of Puffy and losing his first canon life.

   Foolish awakes at his summer home, in the temple's beacon. At first, he is fearful and in denial that he, a god, had died. He finds the Egg speaking in his mind claiming it's "in his soul." It claims that Foolish knew of it before but has forgotten as it is even more ancient than him and knows who he is. Foolish explains that he has chosen a life of building to repent against the time where he was reckless with his power and to feel in control. It asks him to join the Eggpire but Foolish continues to refuse to say he no longer wants to be a totem of death and tells the Egg to "go to hell." He escapes the voice for the time being by entering the holy water of Church Prime.

   , Quackity meets with Foolish at his summer house, greeting each other at the front as if they have met before. They catch up, with Foolish brushing off any mention of the Red Banquet, and discuss their affiliations. Quackity moves on to invite Foolish to his new country as he was "the first person [Quackity] thought of". Foolish is honored by the invitation, but turns it down; he is content with just being at his summer home and living a simple life. However, Quackity refutes this, implying his knowledge about Foolish's life from "far back". Foolish tries to explain that he once believed in peace through fighting but now knows it only leads to fear, power and hatred. Quackity dismisses this and asks to buy Foolish's summer house from him, offending him by labeling its worth as 1 diamond--all his builds are just "empty shells" that will be lost to time just like Foolish. Quackity then reveals that he had let Foolish die at the Red Banquet. Foolish is enraged by this and Quackity taunts him to kill him with his trident, justifying his choice to help him realize that being a pacifist makes no difference and so he should go back to "how [he] used to be". They continue arguing about power, peace and potential before Quackity leaves, leaving the invitation open to Foolish.

Quackity does not divulge to Foolish what has been going on in the prison, but promises to talk with Foolish at a later time. Foolish stops trying to break in, and seals up the passage he dug. Occasionally Foolish will check out his break in attempt to see if the passage is still there.

   On December 11, 2021, DreamXD logged on and was surprised to see that the DreamXD statue was done. Foolish said that he still needs to finish the base part of it, but DreamXD thinks that the statue is complete now. They talk about a lot of stuff, but most importantly, Foolish got immortal power as a reward for building the DreamXD statue. However, this power is limited, and once it runs out, he will just be a normal person like everyone else. The way this power works is that every time Foolish loses all of his hearts, which normally would kill him, a totem would be popped even if he wasn't holding one. Foolish basically has an infinite amount totems, which makes him immortal and invincible. The totem comes from his body, as he is a totem of undying.

Sam and Foolish later encountered Puffy and had a chat about Totems. He then offered to show Foolish his home, he agreed and was amazed by Sam's knowledge of redstone and building skills.

Sam denied Foolish returning the help, sounding very scared of what Foolish is capable of. Nevertheless, Foolish stands ready to assist Sam against the Eggpire. One day while hanging out Foolish and Sam got into an intense staring contest while doing so Sam got lost in Foolish's eyes and when Foolish asked if he liked what he saw Sam told him yes. Sam then told Foolish to ask him on a date when Foolish did so Sam told him no as he was with Ponk then later on Sam told Foolish to ask again and this time Sam said yes so they went on a date however since Foolish and Ponk were friends and Sam had a complicated relationship with Ponk he decided to call it a hang out instead of a date.

       Eventually, Foolish brings up them being "old pals" who cleaned up the "mess from the wither cult," "went on an adventure to the mountains" and "fought off trolls" in the past. However, Eret does not remember any of this and thinks Foolish is mistaking them for the wrong person, but Foolish insists that this happened even after confirming their identity. Eret is wary of the idea that Foolish knows something that they don't. Both confused, they part ways with Eret thinking that Foolish is just messing with them.
