Smiling gently she gives them two days to make a decision and sends them off with a barrel of wine Mero had demanded. Daario smiles over his back at her as they depart. Once the sellswords are gone, Daenerys drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at Mero's back, instructs Barristan that if they must fight the Second Sons, he is to kill Mero first.

He explains that he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains, but they ran into a "philosophical disagreement" over her beauty. He then produces their severed heads. Intrigued, Daenerys rises from her bath and asks if Daario will swear fealty to her. He bends the knee and swears his sword, his men and his heart to Daenerys.

   Tyrion spends the wedding feast mostly by getting deeply drunk and making light of his father's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife. Tyrion, drunkenly proclaiming himself "the god of tits and wine," reminds his father that Tywin has long called him "a drunken little lust-filled beast," so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem. At the same time, Joffrey is himself drinking too much wine, and losing what few inhibitions he has, his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both Sansa and Tyrion. Against Cersei's ineffectual protests, Joffrey gets up and, flanked by his Kingsguard, taunts Sansa that she's still found a way to marry a Lannister. Joffrey then reflects that it doesn't matter which Lannister gets her pregnant, and openly says he might want to rape her after Tyrion is done with her, while the Kingsguard hold her down.

   Joffrey then declares it time for the
   bedding
   ceremony (which involves the men at the wedding stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed) but Tyrion angrily insists there will be no bedding ceremony. When Joffrey keeps pushing the matter, a furious Tyrion slams his dagger into the table and threatens that Joffrey will "be fucking [his] own bride with a wooden cock" if he doesn't let it drop. As the court stands in shocked silence, Joffrey seethes with outrage and Tyrion defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred. After a tense moment, Tywin defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony, and placates Joffrey by claiming Tyrion's outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk. Taking the hint and using it as an excuse to avoid punishment, Tyrion visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is, intentionally humiliating himself, and says he only made a bad joke. It isn't clear if anyone in the room, including Tywin or Joffrey, thinks that Tyrion's outburst was simply due to inebriation, but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass. Tyrion, while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand, escorts Sansa to their bedchamber.

   Once they are alone in their quarters, a tense moment passes as Sansa nervously and slowly undresses.

   . Before they enter, two crows land on a branch on the heart tree, and begin to squawk loudly.

   Later at night, Sam tries to light a fire, but is frustrated in his attempts; Gilly tries and does it easily. Meanwhile, Sam suggests that Gilly name her son, but she does not know any boy names. Sam gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. Gilly likes the name

   Suddenly, they are interrupted by a thunderous squawking of the crows. Sam and Gilly go outside to investigate, and discover hundreds of crows filling the nearby tree and on the structure itself screeching violently. Gilly is then horrified to see a
   White Walker
   approaching them, and knows that it is after her child. As the Walker emerges from the trees, it is shown to be the same one that spared Sam before the battle at the Fist. Sam draws his sword and orders it to halt its advance, but the Walker simply grabs his sword blade with a resounding clang. There is a crunching of ice and then the sword itself shatters in his grip. The Walker swats the much larger and heavier Sam aside with one backhander, then continues to bear down upon Gilly who refuses to give up her baby. As the monster reaches out to seize the infant, Sam staggers back to his feet, pulls out his

   dagger, and runs at the Walker in desperation. With a mighty howl that mixes with Gilly's screams, Sam plunges the black glass blade into the Walker's left scapula.................. and the Walker lets out an unholy guttural screech of agony. Whirling to face Sam, its face blanches as it recognises him and screeches again, this time in disbelief. It falls to its knees, and shatters, leaving nothing but white dust and the dagger. The dagger is left behind as Sam and Gilly race away in a panic. The crows fly out of the trees and chase them, screaming their hatred.

      On a looser level, the entire episode deals with "second sons" of various forms: Tyrion is the spurned younger son of Tywin, and is being forced into marriage to further his father's plans; Sandor is the second Clegane son, but unlike his brother Gregor he has turned his back on the Lannisters; Stannis was the second Baratheon son after Robert, and is struggling with how to claim the throne of his deceased brother; Gendry is

      TV viewers might think it foolish that Sam left the dragonglass dagger on the ground where the White Walker died, instead of recovering such a valuable weapon. In the books, Samwell only had one dragonglass dagger (later, Mormont gave him another dagger as he was dying, which shattered when Sam used it against a wight), and he told Grenn to pick it up after killing the White Walker. However, the next time that Samwell appears in the TV series (two episodes from now in "

    Melisandre claims generally that there is power in king's blood, but does not specify what it is. In the novel, she claims it is the power to wake stone dragons. It is unclear what are those "stone dragons" - fossilized dragon eggs or the stone carvings of dragons at Dragonstone.

    Actual live leeches were used when Melisandre performs her blood ritual with Gendry. Live leeches were used because they appear in closeup, both when she holds them and when they crawl around on actor Joe Dempsie's chest.

    Why did Tywin state that the bedding could be dispensed with? It is out of character for him to agree with Tyrion on anything. Perhaps he thought the bedding ceremony was not "dignified" enough for the Lannisters, or it brought back unpleasant memories of his late wife's bedding (according to Barristan Selmy, Aerys acted indecently on that occasion, verbally and physically), or it simply seemed to be the easiest way to diffuse the situation, given Tyrion's clear hostility towards the idea.
