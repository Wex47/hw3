   House Tyrell's overall disposition is adequately represented by their sigil of a rose: a rose's beauty often hides the fact that it has thorns. Though the Tyrells do try to be just and fair, their benevolent demeanor serves to lull their enemies into thinking that, like the Starks, they are utterly beholden to honorable conduct. In reality, the Tyrells are just as cunning as the Lannisters in court politics and intrigue, though they often prefer a more subtle approach. Thus they strike a pragmatic balance between the Starks' honor and the Lannisters' ruthlessness.

   then arrives at Renly's camp as an envoy from King Joffrey. While in camp, he engages Margaery in conversation, alluding to the fact that Renly is actually a homosexual, trying to lure her allegiance (and that of House Tyrell) away from Renly. To Baelish's surprise, he finds that Margaery is not intimidated by him or his court intrigues. Baelish also did not anticipate that, as it turns out, Margaery is fully aware that Renly is in a homosexual relationship with her own brother Loras, but she does not care. Margaery honestly believed that supporting Renly's claim to the kingship was in the best interests of House Tyrell, so she agreed to the paper marriage. Indeed, she actively supported the idea.
   However, in private, Margaery also shrewdly explains to Renly that he has to impregnate her, as the best way to truly cement the alliance between their two Houses is if "you put your baby in my belly."

   King Renly is then assassinated in his tent under mysterious circumstances. As Ser Loras stands vigil over his body, Margaery urges him that it is not safe and they must return with their army to Highgarden. Littlefinger then arrives in the tent, and while Loras is angry with him and overcome with grief, Littlefinger calmly explains to him that Stannis's army will arrive within the hour, and when they do, the Tyrells' former allies in the Stormlands will fight each other over who gets to hand Loras and Margaery over to Stannis as prisoners. Margaery agrees with the sense of what Littlefinger is saying, and that if they have any hope of getting revenge on Stannis for Renly's death (which they accurately suspect he was responsible for) they must live to fight another day. After Loras leaves, Baelish tries to assess the position of Margaery and of House Tyrell. Noting her marriage to Renly, he asks Margaery if she wants to be a queen. Margaery cooly responds that she wants to be "

   that they should seize Renly's untimely demise as an opportunity to forge a new alliance between House Lannister and House Tyrell. With House Tyrell on their side, the large armies and resources of the Reach will support King Joffrey's faction in the war. Tywin feels that trying to woo the Tyrells to their allegiance is the obvious course of action, criticizing Baelish for acting like he's the only person who could have thought of that, but nonetheless he sends him to try to broker the alliance with House Tyrell.

Just as Stannis's forces were turning the tide and about to take the city, the Lannister army led by Tywin and the large Tyrell army led by Loras arrived from the Riverlands and the Reach, and caught Stannis's army in the flank. Stannis' army was almost completely destroyed, though Stannis himself managed to escape with a small fraction of his men.

Thus, she says, the more politically savvy women of House Tyrell are left to clean up the mess. Sansa confirms the rumors that have been coming out of the capital: Joffrey is a monster. Lady Olenna says this is "a pity" but takes the news calmly. She thanks Sansa for her honesty, and assures her that her son Mace is too set on entering Margaery into a royal marriage to call off the wedding at this point.

In the novels, they actually have two older brothers, Willas and Garlan, who were omitted from the TV continuity, as Loras was repeatedly said to be

   Later, an small part of these forces is annihilated by the Lannister-Tarly forces at the

   , leading to Olenna's death, thus eliminating the once formidable great house.

  <p key="3c1ebb4e-634d-4a82-b479-35cbf25c9037">
   As the second richest house, Tyrell soldiers seem to be well-equipped, yet still far behind to the Lannisters. This is particularly evidenced by the high quality swords and weapons purchased due to the Reach's fertile lands.

   Despite the Tyrell army being diverse and ornamentally impressive in design, their vassals seem to follow this motif (bright colored armor and steel plates) despite their preference to be considered as independent houses. Most notably,

   It is relatively quite unknown how the Tyrell army is experienced in terms of warfare since most of their army didn't partake in pitch battles during the War of the Five Kings. Numerous battles such as the Battle of the Blackwater showed it’s capability in combat, wherein the combined cavalry of both House Lannister and Tyrell easily managed to crush

   's army with ease. Although it can be considered that they fought using mounted soldiers which gives an advantage compared to the foot soldiers used during the battle. Later in

   , it is revealed that the Tyrell army is incapable of fighting as stated by Olenna Tyrell by grimly stating "It was never our forte". This can be an assumption that House Tyrell is more reliant and dependent on their more marital vassals like the Tarly’s and other houses to fight their battles.

  <p key="58d17dd6-3153-4ce7-845c-0aed7b4aaf64">
   The Reach is controlled mostly by House Tyrell, mostly due to Harlan Tyrell’s surrender of Highgarden to
