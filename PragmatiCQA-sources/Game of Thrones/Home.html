Balon tells her that they will continue fighting, but Yara argues that invading the North is pointless since they are unable to hold the strongholds they conquer against the mainland armies and the strongholds in the mainlands aren't really valuable to the Ironborn because they are so far away from the sea. Balon says that one of the reasons that the invasion wasn't successful was because Yara wasted men when she attempted to rescue Theon, which she says she will not apologize for. Yara continues to try to convince Balon to end the rebellion, saying the only reason they were able to take strongholds in the North in the first place was because the Northerners were in the south fighting a

   Balon starts walking on the swinging rope bridge that separates two of the towers of Pyke. Through the storm, he sees a man standing on the bridge who is blocking his way. He tells the man to get out of the way, but the man reveals himself to be Balon's younger brother,

   , telling Balon that he is the Drowned God. Balon inquires about a rumor that Euron lost his senses during a storm and his crew had to tie him to the mast of the ship to prevent him from jumping overboard. Euron doesn't deny the rumor, and explains to Balon that he cut the tongues out of all of his crew members because he wanted silence. Euron then says that Balon is too old to rule and that he's been ruling long enough and it's someone else's turn. Balon tells Euron that he isn't a true Ironborn because he lost his wits during a thunderstorm and tries to stab him, but Euron throws him off the rope bridge to his death.

   At Balon's funeral, Yara tells the priest,
   Aeron Greyjoy
   , Balon's youngest brother, that she will find the person who did this and feed them to sharks while they're still alive. She swears to do this upon the Salt Throne and Aeron explains to her that she isn't the ruler yet, because the law says that the
   Kingsmoot
   chooses the next ruler. Yara argues that her father wanted her to rule, but Aeron says that he doesn't make the law.

In the books, the Greyjoys do not prominently feature in the third novel either, and because it was the longest novel it was split across two TV seasons (Season 3 and Season 4), so they were not predicted to appear prominently in those. Apparently to keep them on screen to some extent, the TV series invented the sideplot of Balon and Yara receiving a taunting letter from Ramsay (and a box containing Theon's severed genitals) in the Season 3 finale, prompting her to announce that she would mount a rescue attempt against the

    Kingsmoot
    subplot, spurred by the introduction of Balon's younger brother Euron, and Asha (Yara in the show) herself becomes a POV narrator. This extended into the fifth novel. The showrunners, however, chose to condense both the fourth and fifth novels into

      Several reviews remarked that the ironborn characters seemed to have more screentime in this episode alone than in the past three seasons combined: at nearly six minutes, it is actually slightly less than in the past three seasons put together - but still close, and each a dialogue-heavy scene. The Yara and Balon scene at the end of Season 3 lasted only three minutes, while Yara's attack on the Dreadfort in Season 4 was a little under five minutes long but included less dialogue - for a total of eight minutes compared to the six minutes in this episode alone. This does not include Theon as his plotline was removed from the Greyjoys as a faction (other ironborn did appear with Theon in the
      Surrender of Moat Cailin
      sequence in Season 4, which lasted about five minutes, but Balon and Yara didn't reappear).

For Euron this was largely irrelevant because he wasn't in the islands at the time, but in the book version the baptism ceremony that Theon undergoes was conducted by his youngest uncle, the priest
    Aeron "Damphair" Greyjoy
    - thus when Theon's baptism ceremony appeared in Season 2's "

Even Theon back in Season 2 criticized Balon for this, because it would gain little, and when the war on the mainland eventually ended, either the Starks or Lannisters would turn their full attention to the Greyjoys. Yara's remark about sending men to die for "pinecones and rocks" is part of a longer speech in the novels, in which she has her men dump treasure chests filled with actual pinecones and rocks at the feet of the assembled ship captains: a sarcastic display of the "riches" that trying to conquer the North has brought them, paid for with blood.

    Yara angrily warns her father that the wars on the mainland are drawing to a close, and the mainland powers will soon turn their attention back to them - specifically reminding him what happened the last time they provoked the mainland powers too far in the Greyjoy Rebellion and they lost. She says that she watched from the castle tower during the
    Siege of Pyke
    as enemy armies broke in, and she lost two of her brothers that day, and Balon says he lost three sons, because after Theon was taken as a ward he considered the boy dead to him. The two older Greyjoy brothers who died in that war were
    Rodrik Greyjoy
    and
    Maron Greyjoy

    Battle of Seagard
    . Of course, given that Balon and Yara are outright shouting at each other about this, it is possible they are just speaking loosely about the fine details in their anger.

When Jon executes Slynt, it is because Slynt is insubordinate and disobeys orders multiple times, though it does exact justice for Ned Stark. The way Jon interacts with Slynt does not necessarily mean, though, he'd have treated Theon the same, because there is a great difference between them: Slynt was one of the Lannisters' henchman, who owed no loyalty to the Starks; Theon grew up with the Stark children and initially fought on their side, but later he turned against them and performed atrocities at the North (at the
      Stony Shore
      and Winterfell), on his own. Jon might have not managed to suppress his personal feelings toward Theon.

    This episode also marks the return of Bran and his companions at the
    cave of the Three-Eyed Raven
    , after their storyline took the year off in Season 5. As the showrunners explained, Bran's material largely caught up with the current novels by the end of Season 4: it had less material than other subplots so they adapted it at a faster pace relative to the other storylines. They felt that Bran finally meeting the Three-Eyed Raven was a very good stopping point, and combined with the large number of storylines being condensed into Season 5, it really made sense to just leave his subplot "on hold" and return in Season 6 once he had made more progress in his magical training.

However, in the TV version, Hodor is played by actor Kristian Nairn, who was 38 years old when Season 6 was filmed: there probably weren't many seven feet tall teenaged actors to pick from at the audition, so the TV series cast Nairn. This being the case, TV-Hodor simply happens to be twice as old as book-Hodor - and therefore, unlike his book counterpart, TV-Hodor actually is roughly in the same age group as Eddard Stark (Nairn is actually 15 years younger than

    The appearance of the Children of the Forest has been drastically upgraded since they were last seen in the Season 4 finale - apparently due to a combination of advances in CGI while they spent the year off in Season 5, along with a significantly increased budget (up to $10 million per episode in Season 6). The redesign brings their appearance much closer to how it was described in the novels, as well as in the animated "
    Histories &amp; Lore
    " segments featuring drawings of them: glowing slit eyes like a cat's, nut-brown skin (spotted like a deer's), and overall less human-like facial features (the books also describe them as having four-fingered hands that end in claws, but they aren't visible in this episode). Some descriptions of the Children in the books imply that they look almost like humanoid squirrels (the name the giants call them literally translates as "little squirrel people").

      In the Season 4 finale, extensive CGI was actually used to soften the Children's appearances so they seemed much more rounded and infantile. Still, the previous episode didn't apply the other features that the Children prominently have in the books, such as their coloration - which somewhat implied at the time that the Children look white/Caucasian. This episode corrects this to portray them with the nut-brown skin and "dappled" (spotted) coloration described in the novels: the Children don't really look like any human ethnicity, as they are a non-human race altogether.

Ramsay even brutally kills Walda and her newborn son with his hunting dogs. The similarities end there: while Ramsay's actions in this episode are certainly very violent and disturbing, they are likely not an invention of the TV series as the Dorne subplot is, and are a culmination of a plotline set up long in advance. While the Bolton storyline in the TV series has surpassed the current novels, it is implied that Ramsay might kill Roose in the next novel - for much the same reasons as in the TV show: Ramsay has proven to be short-sighted and impulsive, Roose has lost faith in him, and Roose might make any child he has with Walda his heir instead. Curiously, in the second and fifth novels Roose outright expresses his fear that Ramsay will try to kill any trueborn children he has with Walda - perhaps as a foreshadowing.

Benioff further explained how this wasn't meant to be an unexpected or gratuitous "surprise" by pointing out how Lord Karstark doesn't even flinch when Ramsay stabs Roose in front of him: it had become obvious to characters around the Boltons that inevitably, either Ramsay would kill Roose and the rest of his family, or Roose would disinherit and/or kill Ramsay.

Adding to the ironic nature of Roose's death, Ramsay even kills him in similar fashion to how he killed Robb Stark: hugging him close and plunging a dagger into him (Roose into Robb's heart, and Ramsay into Roose's stomach), and

      George R.R. Martin himself remarked in the Season 5 featurette on "Bastards of Westeros" that Roose and Ramsay are something of a dark foil to the relationship between Eddard Stark and Jon Snow. Roose derided Ramsay for his bastard status, and through his actions taught him to betray anyone and break any rule if it meant securing power for yourself. In contrast, Eddard taught his sons about honor and the responsibilities of command, that "the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword" - a lesson Jon put into effect when he executed

    's execution by Robb back in Season 3. Harald is actually a condensation for the TV series of several different Karstark characters who had a longer subplot in the novels. This episode confirms that Harald is Rickard's own son, rather than some other relative. In the books, Lord Rickard had three sons: Harrion, Torrhen, and Eddard Karstark. The second two were killed by Jaime Lannister. The TV series apparently thought it would be too confusing to have more than one character named "Eddard" like Eddard Stark, so it moved the names around, instead stating that Harrion and Torrhen were killed by Jaime. In the books Harrion was captured by the Lannisters (it is unknown where he is held, and whether he is still alive) while Rickard's old uncle Arnolf sides with the Boltons - not because he resents the Starks for his nephew's death, but because he seeks to take over Karhold. The TV series simply condensed this and moved around the names of the sons - thus "TV-Harrion" died like "Book-Eddard", while "Harald" in the TV version is like "Book-Harrion" merged with uncle Arnolf.

      Harald's actions in this episode are peculiar if not incomprehensible. While his lingering hatred for the Starks is understandable, it made no sense for him to just stand idle as Ramsay murdered the rest of his own family. In the first place, Roose was the one who killed Robb, and although his motive had more to do with his own self-preservation and the elevation of his house than avenging Harald's father, Roose still did Harald a favor by killing his father's executioner. Second, Walda and her baby shared blood with

    to infiltrate the Night's Watch and befriend Jon in order to find Bran and Rickon, Ramsay suggests that they kill Jon as well since he has Stark blood and may be a threat, even though he is a bastard in the Night's Watch and thus has renounced any possible claim to Winterfell (though this may also be based on Ramsay's jealousy of Jon). In that episode, Roose doesn't respond to Ramsay's suggestion. In this episode, Ramsay again makes the suggestion of murdering Jon, this time to get to Sansa, but this time, Roose completely shoots down the idea, claiming that Jon is a bastard and now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and murdering him is not only considered a heinous crime in Westeros, but would also turn the entire North against the Boltons. After murdering Roose, Ramsay is now free to pursue his vendetta against Jon, at the time unaware that Jon is already dead.

    . In the books, they do indeed currently have the largest armies: the Karstarks returned back to the North after Robb executed Lord Rickard so their force were not present during the massacre at the Red Wedding, and as a result they are the only major House in the North (besides the Boltons) whose army is still relatively intact. The Umbers and Manderleys did have their main armies massacred at the Red Wedding, but even after this they still have the most remaining forces. The Umbers are the closest House to the Wall and have a strong warrior tradition of fighting wildling incursions: thus while their remaining forces are old men and young boys, they are a very capable fighting force disproportionate to their size. The Manderlys, meanwhile, rule

      While these are the three vassal Houses in the North with the most troops, it is unclear why Ramsay would think the Manderlys would fight for him. In the books, Lord Wyman's son
      Wendel Manderly
      was killed at the Red Wedding, and hates the Boltons for their role in the betrayal (Wendel even appeared in the TV version, albeit in a non-speaking role). The Karstarks in the books do support the Boltons (the TV series condensed this slightly, see the note on "Harald Karstark"). In the book version, the Umbers do "fight for the Boltons" in a sense: their forces are divided between two of

The half composed of all the green boys too young to march south with Robb when the war began is led by Mors "Crowfood" Umber, which fights against the Boltons. The half composed of all the old men who stayed behind is led by Hother "Whoresbane" Umber - but even he only grudgingly marches his forces with the Boltons because the Greatjon is held prisoner by the Freys (who took him alive at the Red Wedding, explicitly so they could use him a political hostage).

Even after Joffrey dies, she proves to be a very incompetent mother for Tommen, though in the opposite way: while Cersei could never bring herself to chastise Joffrey, no matter how ridiculous or outright murderous his behavior became, she becomes incredibly domineering towards Tommen. As if making up for her prior lack of control over Joffrey, whenever Tommen shows the least signs of backbone or will of his own, she ruthlessly suppresses him by having his whipping boy Pate beaten, or worse: she orders Tommen to whip the boy himself until he bleeds, otherwise she'll have Pate's tongue ripped out, knowing well this will break gentle Tommen's heart. Ultimately she barely raised Tommen, and after he became king she largely expects him to be her obedient puppet, not "strong".

Back in Season 4 Daenerys received news that the slave-masters had already retaken Yunkai (though later they were at least willing to enter a peace agreement with her in Season 5), while the council she set up to rule over Astapor was overthrown by a former butcher named
    Cleon
    who declared himself emperor (the books explain the details that Cleon leads an army of vengeful freedmen who re-institute slavery - just with the roles reversed and the former slave-masters as the new slaves). The political machinations with Yunkai and Astapor were a much longer subplot in the novels - culminating in the
    Siege of Astapor
    - but the ultimate end-point is the same. In the books, a plague breaks out in Astapor which decimates its defenses and it eventually falls to Yunkai's reformed army after a siege. Most of the population is killed in the ensuing bloody sack of the city, though afterwards Yunkai is devoting resources to try to rebuild Astapor.

    in King's Landing, as explained in the "Histories and Lore" featurettes), and subsequent generations grew smaller and smaller until the last two were stunted creatures that died young at only the size of cats. The discussion about chaining up the dragons in enclosures is had by Daenerys, Barristan, and Jorah in the novels, though Tyrion also muses on it: they disagree that this is necessarily what made subsequent dragons smaller, as by that logic men who live in small huts would be small and those who live in castles would grow to be giants. Others suspect it was the heavy inbreeding that harmed their health (there were only

      Tyrion's point about dragons being very intelligent and that they will respond well to perceived acts of kindness as a result are touched upon in the novels. Dragons do seem to be intelligent, moreso than dogs or horses, and some maesters speculate that they might even be as intelligent as humans - but no one has been able to successfully test this. Dragons are very fickle creatures, however, and their behavior is enigmatic - given that they are inherently

    The "Behind the Throne" featurette for this episode explained that when the crypts the dragons are being chained up in were introduced in Seasons 4 and 5, they were filming in the cellars of Diocletian's palace in Croatia - but filming in Croatia this season was minimal, so they couldn't film there anymore. The production team realized that they crypts are mostly just a large, empty cellar, so it was relatively easy to recreate it as a digital extension. The stairs in the front of the crypts which Varys and Tyrion stand on were real, and careful reproductions of the original on-location stairs. They noted it helped to have Tyrion walk into the crypts with only a single torch to light his way - as a result the rest of the crypts were kept in shadow, which makes it easier to hide that it's just a digital recreation and not the original stone cellar anymore.

As the scene continues, Rhaegal is the first one that Tyrion unchains, and Viserion the second.

      It is appropriate that Viserion is shown as the one who first comprehends that Tyrion is there to unlock them, and lowers his neck so Tyrion can release him: in the novels, Viserion is described as the most friendly towards other people out of Daenerys's three dragons. He's thus the dragon that would be most ready to understand a human's attempts at interacting with him.

It is speculated by fans that Melisandre has foreseen their fates in her visions, and orchestrated the ritual in order to take the credit she did not deserve for their deaths, in hope to prompt Stannis into sacrificing Edric Storm/Gendry. Such act is not out of character for Melisandre; she herself admits, both in the show ("

Their assumptions are later shown to be wrong, however: recall how Joffrey said he felt the war was over at the beginning of Season 4, even when Jaime urged that the war couldn't be considered truly over so long as Stannis was alive (even if his armies were mostly destroyed) and the ironborn rebellion hadn't been dealt with at all. In-universe historians, as it were, are still undecided on whether to continue to call the ongoing conflicts the second phase of "The War of the Five Kings" or something else.
