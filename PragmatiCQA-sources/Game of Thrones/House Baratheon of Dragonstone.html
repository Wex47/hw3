   Following his defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, Stannis falls into a deep depression, shunning the company of his bannermen and wife, and allowing no one but Melisandre to see him. When Davos Seaworth returns to
   Dragonstone
   , he gets into an argument with Melisandre and attempts to kill her when she mentions his dead son, so Stannis orders him thrown into the dungeon.

   Later as Melisandre prepares to depart Dragonstone by boat, King Stannis Baratheon speaks with her. He is worried that his enemies think he is defeated and laughing at him, as Renly laughed at him, and that now even she is abandoning him. She assures him that she still thinks he is the
   Lord's Chosen
   , but she must travel to the

   to obtain something vital for his cause. Stannis doesn't understand, but then Melisandre implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king's blood as an offering to the Lord of Light. She can't kill Stannis himself to achieve this, but any of his brother King Robert's
   bastard
   children who managed to survive the purge would be equally suitable.

   Melisandre finally arrives back at Dragonstone with

    Gendry

Stannis is less than impressed by the sight of the bastard boy who is technically his nephew and is bemused when Melisandre orders him fed, bathed, and clothed, believing it pointless as they intend to sacrifice him. Melisandre reveals, however, that it is merely a pretense to keep Gendry feeling secure, in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife.
  </p>
  <p key="9061d842-f658-4987-af07-fc8668d8cc2d">
   Later Davos Seaworth, still languishing in his cell, is paid a visit by Stannis. Davos protests that Gendry is an innocent who has never done him any wrong, but Stannis argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory, which Stannis believes is the only way to save every man, woman and child in Westeros from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path and asks how Davos can doubt the power of Melisandre's god when Stannis has seen visions of "a great battle in the snow" and Davos saw the creature she gave birth to. Davos speculates that the real reason Stannis came is that deep down, a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong and he knew Davos would tell him the truth he needs to hear, regardless of how it would be taken. After extracting a promise from Davos that he won't act against Melisandre again, Stannis has Davos released.

   As Stannis and Davos enter Gendry's quarters, they find that Melisandre had tied Gendry to the bed and placed leeches on his body. She explains that Davos wanted a demonstration of the power in king's blood, then removes the leeches and lights a fire in a nearby brazier. At Melisandre's direction, Stannis throws the leeches into the flames and recites the names of three people he wants dead: "The usurper

   Later, the news reaches Dragonstone that Robb Stark was betrayed and killed at the Twins. Melisandre claims that her spell with the leeches was responsible, though Davos argues that it wasn't magic that motivated the Freys and Boltons to turn on Robb. Stannis feels that Melisandre has proven that her magic with Gendry's blood worked and that sacrificing him will ensure victory. Before they can act, however, Davos frees Gendry. Stannis is outraged that he disobeyed his orders, and is prepared to execute him, but before he can Davos hands Stannis a letter from the Night's Watch:

   have returned. Stannis, despite seeming interested, doesn't change his mind until Melisandre agrees with Davos that the real threat to the realm lies north and has nothing to do with the War of the Five Kings. Stannis brings Davos back into the fold, needing someone to rally more troops to his side, deciding that they should march to the Wall and help the Night's Watch against the threat of the White Walkers.

   At the outset of the War of the Five Kings, Stannis had the smallest army of any faction, with only his immediate vassals from islands in Blackwater Bay offering support. Stannis did, however, have the largest strength at sea, with most of the
   Royal Fleet
   siding with him, because he had commanded them for years as
   Master of Ships
   under Robert. So a few ships remained loyal to the Lannisters that they could not hope to challenge Stannis's control of Blackwater Bay. Davos further bolstered Stannis's strength at sea by hiring the
   sellsail
   fleet of the pirate

   After Renly's assassination, many lords of the Stormlands and at least two houses of the Reach (
   <a href="House Florent.html" key="464e4ba7-dccf-402a-99e5-8c37e86da0c5" title="House Florent">
    House Florent
   </a>
   and
   House Fossoway
   ) bent the knee to Stannis, increasing his troops to more than 10,000. Stannis led them in a massive assault on King's Landing, but most of his forces were destroyed in
   <a href="Battle of the Blackwater.html" key="f44ee937-831f-4ecd-b820-301b9cbe4abc" title="Battle of the Blackwater">
    the resulting battle

   , mainly due to the arrival of the

   's reinforcements.

  <p key="a86e6bb9-d459-47a6-a1e5-868b183be219">
   The defeat effectively knocked Stannis out of the war for over a year, as with no major armies or fleet he was now functionally trapped on Dragonstone; he had about 4,000 fighting men and 32 ships left.
   The only thing that prevented a major Lannister assault finishing him off was that the Lannisters still lacked sufficient sea power.

  <p key="7a463b79-b602-4dbf-ad88-5c55baebd178">
   Stannis managed to receive a loan from the

   ,
   which he used to hire sellswords, increasing his troops to 6,000. However, most of his soldiers abandoned him, leaving around 1,300 infantrymen to
   fight the Boltons
   ,
   which were quite easily and swiftly destroyed by the massive Bolton cavalry.

   Despite being outnumbered, Dragonstone men seem to be well-equipped and well-trained although at the cost of morale. Dragonstone soldiers are distinguishable from other Stormlander soldiers, as they have burgonet helmets of grey steel with cheek guards. They are armored with long uniforms of plate-and-mail armor and black coats, while their kite-shaped shields have the sigil of their house. Their men also require morale, as seen during the Battle of the Blackwater, where most of Stannis's army retreated after seeing the combined Lannister and Tyrell army leading to the surrender of the Stormlords. Their men also cannot handle extreme conditions as seen during his intentions to retake Winterfell from the Boltons, which lead to the desertion of his already exhausted and demoralized army.
