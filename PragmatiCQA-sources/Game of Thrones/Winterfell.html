Outside, Jon, Davos, and several horsemen then prepare to ride south to White Harbor while Sansa watches from the castle battlements and she and Jon bid farewell to one another. Petyr, emerging from the catacombs, gazes at Sansa.

When Sansa tells Bran he is Lord of Winterfell as Eddard Stark last trueborn son, Bran responds he's not a lord because he is the three-eyed raven. Sansa asks what this means. Bran tells her he can see everything and has knowledge of all, but he must learn to see better in preparation for the when the night returns. He proves his all-seeing knowledge by describing the night Sansa was married to Ramsay to Winterfell and tells her he is sorry for what she went through. Sansa leaves, shaken.

   Meanwhile, Arya returns to Winterfell. Arya rides up to the gates and dismounts but the guards don't believe her when she says identifies herself. They are that Arya has been dead for years. Arya asks that they send word to Maester Luwin and Rodrik Cassel, who can prove her identity (not knowing they are both dead). The guards brush her off that no one by those names is at Winterfell. Arya asks for Jon, but they say he actually just left Winterfell. Arya asks who is in charge of Winterfell then when they say "Lady Stark", she learns they are referring to her sister Sansa. The guards try to brush her aside again, but she expertly dodges them and insists that one way or another she's getting in. She explains to them that if she is Arya, they'll be in a lot of trouble for stopping her, and if she isn't, she won't last long in Winterfell anyway. Mildly concerned, they agree to let her wait in the courtyard but insist that she stay put while they go get Sansa. As soon as they take their eyes off her, Arya slips away. The two guards go to inform Sansa. They think it is nothing important and believe Arya is "some winter town girl" but when they reveal the girl asked for Luwin and Ser Rodrick, Sansa realizes the girl is Arya and knows where she has gone.

   Sansa finds Arya where she expected, in the crypts looking at their father's statue. They are happy to see each other but are unsure of what to say. Arya asks if she has to call Sansa "Lady Stark" now, to which Sansa insists yes, and laughs. They smile and hug, though still a bit unsure. Arya notes that Jon left her in charge and smiles when Sansa says that she hopes Jon will be back soon. He will be both surprised and happy to see Arya, Sansa remembering how happy Jon was to see her when they were reunited. The sisters then look sadly on their father's grave statue. Arya says it doesn't really look like him. Sansa acknowledges that everyone who knew his face well is dead. Arya points out they're not.

   Sometime later, Brienne is going through a vigorous sword practice session with Podrick, knocking him down when he overextends himself. Impressed, Arya interrupts and says she'd like to spar with Brienne - the woman who beat the Hound in combat. Sansa and Littlefinger watch on silently from the walkway above as Brienne and Arya spar until they reach a stalemate, with each of them holding a blade at the others' throat. Arya takes her leave of Brienne, both mutually impressed, as Sansa looks down baffled at how her sister received such a deadly skill level.

   Later, in Winterfell's council chamber, Arya observes Sansa presiding over a meeting of the Northern lords. Saying that the King in the North should stay in the north, Robett Glover and Yohn Royce imply they made a mistake in their choice of a ruler and that she take over power in the absence of her half-brother. However, Sansa insists Jon is their true ruler who is doing what he believes is right for their people and that she is his regent. Following the meeting, Sansa confides her frustration in the Northern lords with Arya.

   Much later, Arya stalks Littlefinger as he is walking through the grounds of Winterfell. She follows Petyr into his personal quarters and catches him chatting with Maester Wolkan. She eavesdrops on them and after they leave, Arya enters Petyr's chamber and finds a scroll written by Sansa in the mattress. This is the scroll that Sansa wrote to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to bend the knee to Joffrey. Arya, unaware that Sansa had written the letter under duress from Cersei in an attempt to save their father, is horrified. Arya scrunches up the letter and sneaks out of the room, oblivious to a grinning Littlefinger watching from behind a wall.

   Later on, Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family, but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya traveled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon was saved from defeat when Littlefinger and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay.

   Later, Sansa asks Littlefinger about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talks to Brienne because she has sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark's daughters. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice.

   The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.

   Later, Sansa enters Arya's quarters and opens a leather case containing several "faces", including the late Walder Frey's face. When Arya comes in and catches her, Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her. Arya responds Sansa's men are not here. She tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the

  <p key="ced7d4d0-5a7c-4aff-85f3-deb18ab311ed">
   Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and, as she approaches Sansa with her dagger, wonders what it'd be like to become Sansa. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger.

   Sansa discusses the potential threat that Arya poses her with Littlefinger. Littlefinger tries to manipulate her, encouraging her to think as he does. He tells Sansa to ask herself what Arya's worst possible motivation is. Seemingly overcome with horror at the thought that Arya would want to take her place and reign as

   After a period of contemplation on the battlements, Sansa orders Arya be brought to the Great Hall. In the Hall, Sansa and Bran are seated at the great table, the hall lined with Stark and Arryn men and a few key lords such as Yohn Royce and Littlefinger. Arya is brought in and asks Sansa if she "really wants to do this." Sansa replies it's not about what she wants, it's about justice. She lists a series of crimes perpetrated against House Stark and asks Littlefinger how he intends to answer the charges. Thrown, Littlefinger tries to figure out what is going on. Sansa reveals his murder of

   to recall the exact words Baelish said as he held the knife to Ned's throat. Littlefinger realizes he has no recourse and demands that Lord Royce take him, the Lord Protector of the Vale, to safety. Bronze Yohn refuses him. In desperation, Littlefinger falls to his knees and pleads for his life, insisting yet again how much he loved Catelyn and how much he now loves Sansa, but Sansa, unswayed by his pleadings, sentences him to death and promises she will never forget all the lessons he taught her. As Littlefinger tries to speak, Arya slits his throat with the catspaw Valyrian steel dagger. Littlefinger slumps dead to the floor.

  <p key="feabe7c3-ee91-4493-a451-ace9e7d89d23">
   On the battlements, Sansa and Arya discuss Littlefinger's plots and how much they, as people, have changed. Arya tells Sansa that she wouldn't have been able to survive what Sansa did. Sansa disagrees, saying Arya is the strongest person she knows. The sisters muse on another of their father's sayings about how lone wolves die in the winter, but wolf packs survive. They realize the truth of his words as their remaining family needs to stick together.
