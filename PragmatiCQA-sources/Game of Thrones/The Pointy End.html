The Dothraki grow angry at not being able to take the spoils of victory, as that is the Dothraki way. She starts claiming all the women they see to protect them. The angry warriors take their complaints to Khal Drogo, but he is amused at his wife's fierceness. He tells them that Daenerys may keep the women she has claimed, they can find others. One man won't listen, and angrily accuses Drogo of being slave to a foreign whore.

    In the books, Sansa is not with Septa Mordane when the Lannister men attack. She had gone to see Cersei to ask her to intercede with Lord Eddard about breaking her betrothal to Joffrey and sending her back to Winterfell. She doesn't realize that she is betraying all of them to their enemies. Cersei says she will help, but then has Sansa escorted to a tower room and kept there under guard.

    Ser Alliser treats all of the recruits badly, but he takes a particular dislike for Jon. It is not gone into in the series, but Ser Alliser was a staunch defender of the Targaryens and when Robert took power he was forced to join the Night's Watch. Therefore, he is unhappy with his work in general and Eddard Stark in particular. Jon, being Ned Stark's illegitimate son, receives special attention, and the idea of Eddard being a traitor fills him with glee.

    , Ned Stark originally wasn't going to appear in this episode at all because he is imprisoned. However, the network grew wary of this because they felt that Ned was the main character and audiences needed to see him - despite the writers' insistence that it is an ensemble show (and would expand to characters beyond Ned in Season 2). Therefore, the network sent in a request to "keep Ned present" in this episode, which is why he briefly appears again in it - though only for a few seconds, as a guard kicks him awake, just for the narrative to check in on him. The off-screen guard was actually played by Conleth Hill (Varys) - they filmed the small exchange immediately after the other, dialogue-heavy scene in the dungeon between Ned and Varys.

    Varys accuses Ned that his mercy killed Robert, namely that by telling Cersei he learned the truth about her children - he prompted her to have Robert killed. Varys ignores (or is unaware of) the accurate order of events: Lancel kept offering wine to Robert in "

     <li key="a981fe5a-44bf-4980-ad9d-6587ab67501e">
      The fact that Cersei was perfectly calm during the conversation with Ned also implies that she has already given Lancel the order to make Robert drunk.

     <li key="eb585af9-0622-40b6-bbc2-70312fe5d34d">
      Moreover, how could Cersei deliver Lancel the order when Robert, Renly and Barristan Selmy were around? It is more likely she has given the order before Robert went to hunt.

     <li key="46fac374-4987-4ed4-be6a-96901ca38747">
      According to the show and the novels, Cersei had various reasons to have Robert killed, before her conversation with Ned:
      <ul key="69f3aa8c-b744-4d1e-8331-bc567ee607a5">
       <li key="955d541c-c68f-40a7-83c3-0370f30b16de">
        Cersei hated and despised Robert from their wedding night, and her hatred increased with time due to Robert's whoring and drinking habits. Robert's refusal to punish the Starks for the recent hostilities toward the Lannisters (Tyrion's kidnapping and the
        brawl between Ned and Jaime
        ) might have been the last straw in Cersei's eyes.
       </li>
       <li key="d1a87e8a-9458-468e-933f-4ff092e85a00">
        Cersei might have learned, from her spies and henchmen, about Ned's investigation. She figured it was just a matter of time before he found out her secret and told Robert about it.

       <li key="0fa7fce1-e1a6-4345-a7e8-1538026c1491">
        Varys tells Ned in the novel that Cersei would not have waited long in any case, because Robert was becoming unruly, and she needed to be rid of him to free her hands to deal with his brothers.

        to Robert, and they were not very discreet about their intention. Cersei figured that if Robert married Margaery - the Tyrells would gain a lot of political power at the expense of the Lannisters, and she wouldn't allow that to happen.

     <li key="ab61400d-6a4c-4cfa-8d99-b3cc03f80367">
      In the novels, the joke is repeatedly mentioned by various characters (among them Jaime, a miller, a Lyseni captain, a squire in Harrenhal, and mostly Tyrion), either aloud or in their thoughts, as a euphemism or as a joke about the legendary wealth of House Lannister.

    Tyrion tells his father that his "friends" require 3,000 arms and armors. This does not necessarily mean that he has managed to rally 3,000 clansmen; he says the same number in the parallel book scene, although it is specifically mentioned that only about 300 clansmen have followed him. Perhaps Tyrion means that he promised to arm not only those who came with him, but also those who stayed at the Mountains.

    Robb tells Catelyn that he assembled 18,000 men; the
    Lannister scout
    , who probably made a rough assessment of the Northern troops, says that he counted 20,000 (a deviation of 11% is plausible). Rather than keeping the scout captive or kill him, Robb releases him, taking advantage of his miscounting to mislead the Lannisters; indeed, as revealed in the next episode, they fall for the trick, expecting 20,000 at the
    Battle of the Green Fork
    . Theon, Catelyn, and the Greatjon disapprove of Robb's act; apparently they fail to understand that it is not a foolish act of mercy, but a cunning trick.

    The fight sequence between Syrio and the Lannister guardsmen had to be changed slightly. In the book the Lannister guardsmen did not have fronted helmets or metal armor, so Syrio was actually able to break bones and even kill some of them by striking at the right bones or the eyes. For the TV series, the design of the Lannister armor meant that things had to be changed so the guards were less severely wounded.

    Arya's flight from the Red Keep was originally more elaborate, showing her going past the dragon skulls from the fifth episode and escaping out that way. This was cut for time.

   <li key="98883a14-732a-492b-bd38-f063ad253114">
    The scene where Arya kills the stableboy was scripted closer to the book, with the stableboy pathetically asking Arya to take out the sword and promptly dying. Martin regrets that this was cut and unsure why it wasn't used.

    Ned's cell below the Red Keep is the same set as the crypts under Winterfell.

    In the books, Varys's skills at mummery and disguise are far more elaborate. In the TV series, he is kept more recognizable.

    Mormont's raven
    is a controversial character amongst the fans according to Martin, and some were happy with its removal from the series.
   </li>
   <li key="48e9964b-0814-45ad-a07b-494f75837e17">
    Martin notes that the books give a better feel that a large amount of time passes to allow the messenger raven to get from King's Landing to Winterfell. This had to be compressed for the TV show to keep the story moving.

    Originally, the script showed several of the Northern banner lords receiving a raven and preparing to march to Winterfell. Roose Bolton would be shown in the middle of flaying a man, and Greatjon Umber would be excited at the prospect of a new war, etc. This sequence was cut for reasons of expense; filming that many separate location shots all at once would have used up most of the budget for the entire season. Martin notes this is par for the course for him, as he was always criticized in Hollywood for writing scripts that were too long and too expensive.

    According to Martin, Dinklage was the one and only choice for the role of Tyrion. There were no other actors auditioned.

    Martin is not too concerned about Ghost growling or barking, noting that while that works in the book, on-screen it looked a bit odd, so he was given some sound.

   <li key="95211be4-f051-4ff5-82b9-5d8c2f13907e">
    Martin notes that it was Jason Momoa's idea to put in a fight scene to show Drogo's physical prowess, which is only ever talked about otherwise. The scene itself was extended with new material from David Benioff and D.B. Weiss to show the fight between Drogo and Mago. (In the book, Drogo's ultimately fatal injuries occur "off-screen" and do not involve a fight with one of his followers.)

   <li key="ff42baa7-80ba-477b-9300-9648b9819c8c">
    Martin comments on the danger of the 'butterfly effect' in adapting the series, noting that in the book Mago is not killed and in fact will reappear later on, while Mago in the TV series is dead and done for.

   <li key="8da9de57-0b94-42c2-9ad5-fd9cde6d1ccb">
    Martin also notes that the Winterfell feast scene had a lot more speaking lords and characters in the book, but had to be trimmed down for the TV show for reasons of cost and clarity.

   <li key="2fb69ad6-a58b-45ac-9e65-cd13f7649fbe">
    The hunt for the child actors was the hardest part of casting. Martin notes that a lot of child actors veer towards either reciting lines blandly while just looking cute, or going way over the top instead. Finding young actors capable of hitting the right balance was tricky, but they managed it in the end.

   <li key="1c214f05-3048-4efb-9314-dc70de55103b">
    Martin feels that Osha was the character who was changed the most from the books to the TV series, as Natalia Tena is much younger than the character in the novel. However, Martin felt her performance was impressive enough to justify the change.

    Martin has been asked many times if Samwell Tarly is based on

   <li key="507c1ea4-8945-41ff-b12b-5ae8a55481b3">
    Martin is pleased that the TV series retains the strategy and tactics from the books, which would have been easy to lose for time.

    In the script, the mountain tribes, Tyrion, and Bronn arrived at the Lannister camp on horseback. However, Martin thinks they exhausted the 'horse budget' for the season by this point and couldn't have them in the scene.

    Martin notes that Charles Dance was another actor they really wanted in the series.

    Bronn's line about his father was changed during filming. Martin notes the new line is funnier.

   <li key="6a556eaf-ce06-44eb-a73d-b1d4f5d74c11">
    Martin is very impressed by the way Dance moves the wine cup away from Dinklage during the scene, but it wasn't in his original script. He's unsure where it came from.
