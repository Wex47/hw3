   to identify families and individuals. These heraldic devices are also carried by armies on the battlefield as a sign of status, as well as allegiance to those noble Houses.
  </p>
  <p key="00df28f8-79d6-4e9b-87d5-0f790bee09a4">
   Heraldic designs can vary widely. They may consist of a simple pattern of colors, but more often feature animals (either real or mythological) and/or physical objects. Specific sets of rules govern what form a heraldic design may take.
  </p>
  <p key="e9d9754e-3bcb-47cf-bfc6-848b0860e95c">
   Only members of noble families have the legal right to formally display their own heraldry, though
   <a href="Knighthood.html" key="ff08d3e8-ee91-442c-b47a-7a999ebe1a12" title="Knighthood">
    knights
   </a>
   also gain this right after the conferring of their title: When a
   commoner
   or lowly
   mercenary
   gets knighted (even if he is only a poor
   hedge knight
   with no land and no right to sit in judgement), he legally becomes a member of "the nobility" and can invent his own personal heraldry. The followers of a noble family can also display that family's heraldry (i.e.
   Lannister
   foot-soldiers can carry banners with Lannister heraldry), but it is illegal for the smallfolk to simply invent and use their own heraldry.
  </p>
  <p key="afa2fc92-7ead-4278-aaed-4fd2e049c189">
   The heraldry of each noble House is accompanied by
   a specific set of words, or "motto"
   that is unique to that House. These typically take the form of boasts or battle-cries, such as
   <a href="House Baratheon.html" key="5825955d-1b84-470c-bd7d-6529d7c29554" title="House Baratheon">

   's "Family, Duty, Honor".
   <a href="House Stark.html" key="1577ee89-d3f0-4761-b000-35e25312d1f3" title="House Stark">
    House Stark
   </a>
   is a major exception, as its words are not a boast but the ominous warning "
   Winter is Coming
   ". House words do not typically appear on the heraldry itself, in both the books and the TV series.

    Heraldry in Westeros and in the real-world

  </h2>
  <p key="2647932c-f391-4d2b-b9ce-d004751643e8">
   In the real-life Middle Ages, a formal set of rules governed heraldry designs:
  </p>
  <p key="196f8f01-9239-4aeb-95d7-32d793db1d55">
   The colors used in heraldry are formally known as "tinctures", and these are divided into three basic categories: "colors", "metals", and "furs".
  </p>
  <ul key="add5cc73-0b67-4c76-8c91-92fba9cd5768">
   <li key="22026e21-271a-458b-8e43-af7079583e83">
    Red, Green, Blue, Purple, and Black are considered "colors". Certain other colors, such as Brown, were added in later centuries as new dyes became available to Medieval Europe.
   </li>
   <li key="7c79be7c-a6d2-441e-b162-c19ff9db4b69">
    The two "metals" are Gold and Silver, though both of these terms actually encompass a spectrum of hues: gold, orange, and yellow are all considered Gold, while white and grey are both considered Silver.
   </li>
   <li key="f8e4c170-550d-4519-88c6-95cb5824e3c8">
    "Furs" such as Ermine and Vair are technically patterns, not single colors, but are arbitrarily lumped in with colors and metals as a sub-set of "tinctures". Ermine is supposed to resemble the tail pattern of a stoat (specifically a stoat's winter fur, known as ermine), and Vair is supposed to resemble the belly coloration of a type of squirrel.
   </li>
   <li key="fe727568-edc5-4139-8763-762c38b5dc3f">
    Each tincture officially consists of one specific shade with no variations; i.e. there is only one shade of Blue which can be used, with no variation between light blue and dark blue (which are fairly arbitrary labels in any case).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="f92e8942-7d81-4701-8863-ad5ed7d374ce">
   The most important rule of heraldry is the
   rule of tincture
   :
  </p>
  <p key="5bc83779-5459-402d-9df8-310eed82ef68">
   By this ruling, a design cannot be half red and half blue, or half gold and half silver. For example, the sigil of House Lannister is a gold lion (metal) on a red field (color). It would not be permitted to have a gold lion on a
   <i key="b076cddc-7cbd-4e70-8726-e707740a17b5">
    silver
   </i>
   background, because silver is also a metal. Ostensibly, this is because heraldry is supposed to help identify different armies on the battlefield, and should be easily distinguishable at a glance.
  </p>
  <p key="b803947a-8d36-449d-93e2-dc8636d4c75d">
   There is a major loophole to the rule of tincture, however: An object may be depicted as "proper" - using the color it possesses in nature - regardless of what other tinctures it is touching. This explicitly allows the animal or object featured in a heraldic design to break the rule of tincture. For example, the sigil of House Stark is a grey
   <a href="Direwolf.html" key="2edd9aa3-4cf0-4c72-a94b-1a2b5b7c9c2f" title="Direwolf">
    direwolf
   </a>
   on a white field, which would normally break the "no metal against metal" rule (since both white and grey are considered Silver). However, because direwolves are actually grey in nature, this is simply being displayed "proper". In contrast, it would still break the rule of tincture to put a purple direwolf on a blue background, because direwolves are never purple in nature, and a purple direwolf cannot plausibly be said to be displayed "proper".

   Different versions of heraldic designs may be fitted into the available spaces on various objects, such as flags or armor. However, since these designs were originally painted onto shields, the official shape of an overall piece of heraldry is usually the shape of a shield, known as an
   <i key="e3ed3c0e-d216-4187-8693-8afd96a93a8b">

    Dorne
   </a>
   : Military tactics in the deserts of Dorne favor quick hit-and-run attacks, as opposed to columns of slow and bulky armored knights, who would soon suffer from lack of available water. Thus instead of using the full shields of heavy knights, the Dornish favor lightly armored and mobile riders who fight with small rounded shields. This is reflected in the heraldry of Houses from Dorne, which are officially in the shape of a perfect circle, not an escutcheon.

The symbol did not change in-universe, this was simply a retcon: even carvings in the

In the books, it is a red eye (with a black pupil), which is surmounted by a black crown being held aloft by two black crows (the background color isn't described). This is wordplay on his nickname, "Crow's Eye". Season 7 of the TV series also introduced a personal sigil for Euron, but because he isn't missing an eye in the TV version and is never called Crow's Eye, the crow element was removed, and just combined with the regular Greyjoy heraldry: as a result, Euron's personal sigil in the TV version is a gold kraken on a black field, with a third red eye inscribed onto the head of the kraken.

It isn't clear if this was a deliberate change for the TV continuity, or more probably, if the TV scriptwriters also made the common mistake of assuming the Baratheons didn't use a crowned stag before Robert seized the Iron Throne. The practical result of all of this is what exactly Baratheon heraldry should look like in any potential live-action adaptation of the
