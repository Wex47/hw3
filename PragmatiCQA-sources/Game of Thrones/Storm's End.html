   Storm's End's construction was attributed to
   Durran
   , a legendary figure of the
   Age of Heroes
   , who earned the hatred of the sea god and the wind goddess when he took
   Elenei
   , daughter of the two gods, as his wife. In rage, the two gods sent massive storms to destroy Durran's keep. Durran defied the gods and built a larger and more formidable keep, but it was also destroyed. Durran's seventh keep, built allegedly with the aid of
   Bran the Builder
   , withstood the rage of Elenei's parents and gained the name of Storm's End.
