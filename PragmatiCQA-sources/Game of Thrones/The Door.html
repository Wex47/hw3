When Euron states that his only regret is not killing Balon years earlier, he is met by resounding cheers from the crowd. Theon then counters that Euron had spent years gallivanting overseas while Yara was commanding Ironborn ships and men. Yara then suggests building a massive fleet to attack and make their mark on Westeros.

   that the Night King is now able to locate Bran, who is now marked on his right forearm, and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the White Walkers and the wights out of the cave.  As a result, they must leave immediately and Bran must "become" the Three-Eyed Raven. Bran asks whether he is ready, and the Raven says "No" at which point Bran's eyes whiten as he enters another vision.
  </p>
  <p key="83dd4421-3862-49ad-ab6d-d58a43616066">
   As Meera and Hodor are preparing to leave they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible, indicating the arrival of the army of the dead outside of the cave.  The Night King and three White Walkers start marching towards the cave. The Children of the Forest try using magic projectiles to fend the Walkers off, but are overwhelmed. They light a fire around the entrance which prevents the

   from entering but the Walkers extinguish a pathway and walk through.  The wights end up climbing over the Weirwood and dropping through roots at the top of the cave. Meera desperately tries to get Bran out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened Hodor to carry Bran away to no avail. Using a dragonglass-tipped spear, Meera kills the first White Walker that enters, and fights alongside the remaining Children of the Forest to try to fend off the wights until Bran wakes up. Wights begin to swarm the cave, killing all of the Children of the Forest except for Leaf, as Meera starts yelling at Bran to warg into Hodor.

   . While still in the vision, Bran hears Meera's cries to warg into Hodor and the Three-Eyed Raven tells him to listen to her. Bran wargs into both the present-day Hodor in the cave and Wylis, the young version of Hodor in his vision.

As the wights are closing in on them, Leaf sacrifices herself, using magic to cause a huge explosion, buying the other three enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel. While the Three-Eyed Raven and Bran are still sharing a vision, the Night King kills the Three-Eyed Raven, and his figure within Bran's vision blows away as ashes and rags.

   With some difficulty Hodor pushes the door open and pulls Bran through, coming back to help Meera close the door just as the wights approach. Meera grabs Bran's sled and tells Hodor to bar the exit, shouting to "Hold the door!". Inside Bran's vision, Wylis notices Bran, who links the present Hodor to the past Wylis. Wylis begins to seize when he enters the mind of his future self. As Meera continues to yell "Hold the door!" to present-day Hodor, within Bran's vision Wylis falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure. Eventually, "hold the door" slurs into "Hodor," as his condition deteriorates and it becomes apparent this is the moment Hodor lost the ability to say any other words, and his destiny was fixed.

   Present-day Hodor braces himself against the door long enough for Meera to disappear into the snow with Bran's unconscious body on the sled. Inevitably, the wights break through parts of the wood and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed Hodor. With no possibility of escape for him, all that is shown at the end is young Wylis in the past seizing and crying out "Hodor."

    12,000 years ago, initiating the
    Wars of the First Men and the Children of the Forest
    which lasted for around 2,000 years. The Children were gradually pushed back by the more numerous and larger humans, and in desperation they did resort to various magical "superweapons": they called down the
    Hammer of the waters
    to break the arm of

    , about 8,000 years ago. By the Long Night, the White Walkers were killing all living things, and had apparently turned on the Children, and they were only driven back when the Children of the Forest united with the First Men to drive them back and build the
    <a href="Wall.html" key="8f942cc0-96b7-40ec-be3f-c48c2d540dfc" title="Wall">

    . It is unclear why they would create the White Walkers even centuries after the Pact was made: it's possible that they were created late in the wars but ultimately abandoned, but then returned 2,000 years later. Another possibility is that a sub-faction of the Children created the White Walkers because they thought humans would inevitably crowd them out of Westeros.

      The current novels have made no mention whatsoever that the Children of the Forest actually created the White Walkers. There have been a few scarce hints about the origins of the White Walkers - only in the sense that it was implied that they aren't really a "race" but a malevolent force created by someone else. Martin also said that he isn't sure if the White Walkers really have "a culture" as we would understand it. With this revelation in mind, it's clear why: they are not an independently living race, but a race of living weapons created by others (weapons don't have their own culture). The White Walkers don't reproduce naturally: in the novels

The production team pointed out in behind-the-scenes featurettes how the White Walkers in Seasons 1 to 3 didn't really wear armor but were typically bare-chested, but then they shift to wearing some armor in Season 4: this was explicitly supposed to be a subtle hint that Samwell actually managing to kill one with a dragonglass dagger in Season 3 made them realize (or perhaps, reminded them) that there are things which can actually kill them, so they need to protect themselves in some fashion. The Child of the Forest that tries to stab one wasn't expecting the White Walkers to now be wearing armor, as in the TV show this was a recent development (in the books they are described as wearing armor since the opening Prologue). Meera realizes it is wearing armor and skillfully aims for its unprotected neck (as according to the traditions of the

    As their bodies weren't burned, it's possible that Hodor, Summer, and the Children of the Forest who were killed (excluding Leaf) might be reanimated as wights. In a post-episode interview
    Kristian Nairn
    (Hodor) jokingly pointed out that the camera never actually shows Hodor's death, so for all he knows he might be called back to the set to film again some day (though he is fairly convinced that Hodor as a human is in fact dead).

These vision/memories are now loaded into Bran's mind, so that even without the Three-Eyed Raven he will continue to experience more important visions of the past in subsequent episodes.

Nairn would know because he didn't play it like that; also the character is visibly saying "hodor" in fear, and Bran never speaks when he wargs into his mind. Bran only warged into Hodor's mind earlier in the cave to make him stop panicking, so he would get up to save both Bran and himself: by the time they are at the door Bran wasn't controlling him anymore. Nairn therefore stated that Hodor indeed voluntarily made a heroic sacrifice in the truest sense: once he was at the door and no longer being controlled by Bran he could have run to save himself but that would have let the wights through and they would have killed Bran and Meera. Notice that during Hodor's last stand there comes a point where, despite his terror, he sees that Meera and Bran are successfully getting away into the cover of the snow storm, and Hodor gets a look of grave determination on his face and leans hard into the door again. Nairn stated that Hodor's dying thought was happiness that Bran and Meera would survive.

The Umbers took considerable losses but have a strong martial tradition as the northernmost House, always fighting wildling incursions, so even their remaining forces of old men and young boys amount to a fairly considerable army.

The Stark children actually have some partial claim to Harrenhal given that their maternal grandmother was herself a Whent.

    under them, and so on. The feudal patchwork is uneven in every region: some "major Houses" are actually quite poor and weak, and only considered major because they answer directly to the Great House and no one else - i.e.

    . Other major Houses are so strong and wealthy, such as House Manderly, that some of

   <li key="4e1928bc-ccbd-4855-b224-a10c79c61300">
    The point is that when Jon says that there are "about two dozen" other vassal Houses in the North besides the Starks and Boltons, the actual number of "major" Houses in the North in the novels is
    <i key="9c1fcbb0-5f8d-4940-a670-dbd91afed73a">
     fourteen
    </i>
    - and that includes the Umbers, Karstarks, and Manderlys, which Jon apparently wasn't including. The other Houses mentioned in TV dialogue were the Mormonts (Jorah's family), the Cerwyns (Ramsay flayed their lord alive in Season 5), the Glovers (who rule the
    Wolfswood
    , and have minor vassals such as
    House Forrester
    ), and the Hornwoods (in the books Ramsay killed the old woman who ruled their House by flaying her fingers then leaving her to starve to death in a tower). The Reeds are also staunch Stark loyalists, and Meera Reed is seen in this episode. Other Houses from the North haven't been mentioned as prominently in the TV series but they have been indicated on maps in past seasons: Dustin, Ryswell, and Tallhart are south of the Wolfswood on the southwest coast. Three other Houses that were sworn directly to Winterfell but which aren't very prominent even in the novels are House Locke (which mostly does whatever the Manderlys do), and the eastern and western branches of House Flint. In addition to these, there are actually about 40 or so very small noble Houses in the northwestern mountains of the North, north of the Wolfswood and northwest of Winterfell. While technically they are in the top tier of vassals because they directly serve the Starks, they are very weak - all of their armies combined consist of less than 3,000 men - which is slightly less than what a more powerful House like the Manderlys can raise individually. Of these Northern Houses, all of their armies were destroyed at the Red Wedding, except for the small local forces of the Reeds and mountain clans, who stayed behind to harass invaders.

      Thus, the only way that Jon could reach a count of "about two dozen" other major families is if first, he added some of the weaker and less notable ones like the Northern Mountain clans into the initial count of 14-17, and even then he was sort of rounding up.

    to command the Tully armies and guard their southern flank while he tried to kick the Greyjoys out of the North. The TV series condensed this so that Robb was going to try to return south to make a strike at Casterly Rock, so Brynden just came with him - also viewers may have suspected the coming ambush if some characters weren't present. Either way the end result seemed to generally be the same - alone of Robb's lieutenants, Brynden was the only one that still remained alive and free. Afterwards the situation in the Riverlands was left unclarified in subsequent seasons. In the books, the main Frey army moved south to lay siege to Riverrun and has been encamped around it ever since.

      fell to some advanced Frey raiding forces (because the Tully garrison didn't know about the betrayal), but then Brynden regrouped the main Tully army which was still in the field, then retook it, but then the main Frey army came and surrounded them. Jaime Lannister would eventually send the captive Edmure Tully to negotiate a surrender, but in the confusion, Brynden was able to escape and his whereabouts are unknown. Either that or the TV writers wanted to somehow address the fact that no one mentioned in the past two seasons that Riverrun was still left unconquered.

      in the novels either. In the books, Brienne stayed in the Riverlands searching for the Stark girls and never went to the North (though these storylines are being adapted at an uneven pace). Thus sending Brienne back to Riverrun to try to open a line of communication with their Tully allies puts Brienne back onto her subplot from the books, and is a fairly plausible reason for her to go back south within the context of the TV show.

      Most of the Northern armies were destroyed in the massacre at the Red Wedding. Their Riverlord allies, however, led by the Tullys, were not present at the massacre and thus in the novels their armies were not totally destroyed - but facing the brunt of the combined Lannister/Tyrell armies, with no natural defenses between them, and now with their Northern allies massacred, most of them simply surrendered rather than face annihilation. The Tully garrison under Brynden held out in spite of them, but he only had about 200 men left under his command (more than enough to defend the castle, but not keeping on extra mouths to feed during the siege). Thus on the one hand, more of the Tully armies survived than the Stark armies (which were totally destroyed), and it is true that Sansa would try to at least contact them. On the other hand, the Tully forces are now totally surrounded by the main armies of the Lannisters, Tyrells, and Freys, and not in much of a position to help anyone. Of course, as the showrunners point out in the "Inside the Episode" featurette, the fact that Sansa didn't kill Littlefinger because she hopes to ally with his large Vale army in the future is meant to indicate that she isn't just thinking about the immediate battle in front of them, but is thinking several steps ahead to how they're going to face the Lannisters to the south, on a scale of

    meeting with Sansa Stark in
    Mole's Town
    in this episode is questionable. Sansa stayed with Littlefinger in the Vale in the novels, and never even met Ramsay Bolton - thus Littlefinger riding to within sight of the Wall itself to meet with her like this never happened in the books and is the result of heavy story condensations.

Actually, a small riding party can move much faster than a large army, these three locations are not ridiculously far apart, and at that point in the war, the Lannisters controlled all of the major highways in the region (specifically the Kingsroad), and it was still pleasant autumn weather - thus a single rider

      Consider that in the TV version, Littlefinger said the Vale should start gathering its army and heading north after his spies heard the news that Sansa Stark escaped Winterfell. Sansa escaped Winterfell in the first episode of Season 6, and reached Castle Black in the fourth episode (albeit she didn't have horses to ride until the second episode). Littlefinger was shown receiving news of Sansa's escape only in the preceding episode (four). It is possible that scenes in different locations are not necessarily presented in chronological sequence relative to each other, so Littlefinger's scene in episode four could have chronologically taken place immediately after Sansa fled Winterfell in the season premiere. Nonetheless, in that time Littlefinger would have had to muster the knights of the Vale, ride from the Vale to Moat Cailin, then alone from Moat Cailin to Winterfell, then from Winterfell to Mole's Town - not even factoring in how Littlefinger could avoid the Bolton armies controlling he center of the North.

      The other unstated option is that Littlefinger may have arrived at the Wall by ship, at the eastern end at

      , then ridden west to Mole's Town - apparently not riding to Castle Black itself due to fear of being recognized or attacked by some of the other characters there (Davos wouldn't trust Littlefinger). This is somewhat more plausible, the Boltons don't have any strength at sea to stop travel by ship, and Littlefinger has at least one ship at his disposal - but his ship might still need jets attached to travel the

    sews together new Northern-style riding clothes for herself and Jon Snow (see "
    Costumes/The Seven Kingdoms - The North
    "). Previous episodes have established that Sansa is skilled enough at sewing to make her own clothing; even in Season 1 she was first introduced in a sewing circle, and the production team explained Sansa's subtle costume shifts across Season 1 as Sansa altering her own clothing to try to fit in more with the southern styles in King's Landing. Subsequent seasons see Sansa's costume change subtly as she moves away from Cersei and towards Margaery, while making an overall return to a Northern style. Then at the end of Season 4, she created her own entirely new "Dark Sansa" outfit as Littlefinger's protégé, entirely out of materials on hand at the Eyrie.

It is somewhat condensed from the novels: Theon wasn't present, and another major candidate was his other uncle Victarion Greyjoy - who has been officially cut from the TV show. In the novels, the three Greyjoys - Asha (Yara's name in the books), Euron, and Victarion - were the only serious candidates to go beyond the first round of introductions. There were three other early fringe candidates who present themselves, but gain such little support that they soon give up. Asha's platform was to pull back from the mainland, make peace with the north and form an alliance against the Iron Throne, while Victarion wanted to just continue raiding as Balon had. Euron then makes his claim and announces that he wants to conquer

    In the novels, Euron was actually
    exiled
    from the Iron Islands for raping (or seducing) the wife of his brother Victarion. The only reason Balon wouldn't let Victarion kill Euron is because
    Kinslaying
    is accursed in the eyes of gods and men. Afterwards Euron sailed to the far east and became the terror of the world's oceans. As Victarion was cut from the TV version, no mention is made that Euron was exiled, and it is simply said that he was away for years raiding far away foreign lands (which is essentially the same in both versions).

   <li key="1d1fda26-de25-405b-ab0a-649bbd03c0c3">
    Unlike in the books, in the show Euron openly and brazenly admits that he committed an act of
    Kinslaying
    ; even Ramsay Bolton - one of the worst villains in the show, who murdered at least three of his kin (four if killing a stepmother counts as kinslaying) - wouldn't openly admit such crime (he claimed that his father was poisoned by their enemies). On the other hand, even in the books Euron doesn't really care how suspicious it looked that he arrived on Pyke literally the day after Balon's death, and is flippant when Yara/Asha implies that he killed Balon. Generally, as he says in this episode, the ironborn believe in "paying the
    Iron price
    " (taking what you want with your own strength), so none of them bother to press the question further. In the TV version the ironborn captains are impressed by Euron's sheer audacity at taking what he wants, which is a major aspect of their culture. In the books, Asha claims that Euron does not care about the taboo of kinslaying (and she is correct - he performed three kinslayings so far, though no one knows that), and if someone accused him of being afraid of being called a kinslayer, he would probably murder one of his own bastard sons just to prove that he is not.

      Drowned Men

    Euron asking where his niece and nephew are, then cheerfully saying "let's go murder them", would be odd for other ironborn characters, but Euron is simply that brazen.

    House Blacktyde
    , who defiantly voted for Asha; since it is not a kinslaying, none of the ironborn has any objection.

After Yara/Asha loses, she returns to Deepwood Motte, where she receives a taunting letter from Ramsay, implying that Theon is alive. Tristifer Botley tells her that in the past a Kingsmoot was ruled unlawful because the old king's son was away at sea at the time and wasn't allowed to present his candidacy as was his right. This apparently gives her the idea that if Theon can be rescued, it can be argued that the first Kingsmoot can be declared unlawful because Theon was denied his candidacy - Theon isn't popular enough to beat Euron himself, let alone become a king (most of the ironborn do not even care if he is alive or dead, and only two have mentioned him as a claimant), but it could be used as a pretext for a second round of voting, now that several major lords have grown so wary of Euron that they might switch their votes to Asha this time. Aeron and the other Drowned Men hate Euron, so they would probably accept her proposal. Before Asha can act on this she is captured by Stannis, where she is reunited with her brother, whom Stannis intends to execute. Their captivity in Stannis's camp and the upcoming major battle between Stannis and the Boltons means a second Kingsmoot will only occur if they both somehow manage to survive and return to the Iron Islands. Apparently the TV series, based on knowledge of the next unpublished book, just condensed both elections together into one Kingsmoot to simplify events.

Victarion, who hates Euron for raping his wife years before, obeys the order to set sail but secretly plans to force Daenerys to marry him before Euron can, then return and overthrow Euron, perhaps by using the combined Iron Fleet/Targaryen army. The TV version condenses this so that Yara and Theon essentially take Victarion's place - but instead of taking the fleet east while secretly planning to betray Euron, they have openly turned against Euron. It is unclear how drastic of a condensation this is, given that it is heavily implied that Yara/Asha and Theon were going to return to the Iron Islands on their own soon,

      the anti-Euron factions on the Iron Islands were hoping to ally with Daenerys against both Euron and the mainland (for all anyone knows, Asha and Theon may follow after Victarion to Slaver's Bay in the next novel - assuming they survive the coming battle at Winterfell).

    in the novels is the main "national" fleet of a sort for the Iron Islands, but unlike in the show, it is not the entirety or even the majority of the ironborn naval forces (which, according to a semi-canon source, consist of about 500 ships): each major vassal House has its own military forces and fleets, while the Iron Fleet is sworn directly to the ruler of the Iron Isles. It is composed of the best ships and crews the ironborn possess, and numbers about 100 ships - each of them about three times larger than the standard longships possessed by the vassal Houses. Thus the episode's line that Yara and Theon took their "best ships" is accurate, though it isn't clear how many ships they have in the Iron Fleet in the TV version (or if they took only a fraction of them).

     <li key="5acc88d2-202a-441e-96e1-594cc2ef0a44">
      Euron's command to build "a thousand" more ships might strain these numbers but it is unclear: the Iron Fleet itself only has 100 ships in it but they are larger than the regular ones and considered an elite force, and the other combined vassal Houses of all seven islands probably have more numerous albeit smaller ships. It depends on whether Euron meant "1,000 full sized war galleys" (which is implausible) or "1,000 raiding longships and skiffs" (which is much more plausible, though still a large number).

     <li key="bc5ce1ef-7a10-4443-96fc-71ac2cfa2b13">
      In the novels, Euron does not order to build even one ship (let alone one thousand), because he does not need to; even after sending the Iron fleet to the Slaver's Bay, he still has hundreds of ships at his disposal, and it is sufficient for the next stage of his campaign against the Reach.

     <li key="85dc9f59-c23c-4bbe-8156-ddec6439f5a2">
      The phrase "a thousand ships" is perhaps a reference to the novels: in "

    In the books, the Kingsmoot is held on

    have always worn driftwood crowns (some relatively simple, others ornate), as they are provided by the sea itself. Even Balon had a driftwood crown in the novels - curiously, all of the rival kings in the war have crowns in the books (also Robb Stark and Stannis Baratheon), but in the TV version only Joffrey (and Tommen), Renly, and now Euron have been shown with crowns. There also isn't one "driftwood crown" passed from generation to generation. Even in past centuries, when one king died his crown would be broken up and returned to the sea, and the new king made his own new crown.

    It took two days to film the Kingsmoot scene itself, and another two days to film the scene of Euron's drowning and coronation (which was more difficult due to the underwater shots). Pilou Asbæk (Euron) said that for any one take his head was submerged for about 30 to 40 seconds - and he pointed out that this doesn't sound like a long time, until you actually try to hold your breath underwater for that long while someone is holding you down.

    Euron's speech at the Kingsmoot is considerably more crass and filled with low-brow humor than in the book version - which in the episode is shown to greatly help win over the crowd of ironborn, being mostly pirates with crude senses of humor. Several critics reacted negatively to this change, while others theorized that this was Euron pandering to his target audience - and the confusion stemmed from the fact that it's only his second appearance in the TV series.

      he heaps them with praise and panders to their basic attitudes to rape-pillage-and-burn, but in private he shows a much higher level of intellect and expresses disdain for the ironborn who he has duped into following him with false gifts and empty praise. Cutting out all of these setup scenes so that Euron's jovial act at the Kingsmoot is only the

    . In the play, King Richard III is portrayed as an evil and scheming tyrant, and he is infamously hunchbacked and ugly. Richard III was a king from the House of York during the Wars of the Roses, however, and they were later deposed by their rivals the Lancasters at the end of the war, who founded the Tudor dynasty - and Shakespeare was writing during the later reign of the Tudors. Martin was fascinated with how history always has more than one point of view, which is one of the reasons he gave POV narration chapters to both the Stark and Lannister characters in his story - there isn't one "good" and one "evil" side, but both have their own views. Similarly, Martin was particularly fascinated with criticisms of Shakespeare's play which argue that "Richard III" the Shakespearean character and villain isn't historically accurate, but just Lancaster/Tudor propaganda which skewed the story of events after they defeated him. Thus, Martin wrote Tyrion as almost a revisionist Richard III if these criticisms were true: he is ugly and stunted (as a dwarf), and he is very cunning, but Tyrion is also actually a well-meaning and sympathetic character and not particularly villainous. Therefore, in the exaggerated play in this episode, we essentially see what Martin thinks might have happened to the

    Old Valyria
    , worked to death in the vast mines to feed their masters' ever-expanding hunger for resources. Over time, they came to see death as a "gift" to release fellow slaves from their hellish suffering - and in time, honed their skills to give "the gift" to the slave-masters too. Where Jaqen's story diverges is when he says that

    was "founded" by the Faceless Men - in the novels it was not. For that matter, the Season 5 Blu-ray set's animated featurette on "
    Braavos (Histories &amp; Lore)
    " explained that Braavos was founded when a slave uprising took control of a slave transport fleet, killed all the slave-masters on board, then sailed to the far northwest corner of Essos where the slavers wouldn't find them. In the novels, the Faceless Men came to Braavos at some later point - though they did help the city grow and flourish, by secretly killing its political enemies across the Free Cities.

      Jaqen's claim that the Faceless Men came to give "the gift" to their slave masters in addition to their fellow slaves has led some fans to believe that the Faceless Men were somehow involved in the Doom of Valyria, the massive fiery cataclysm that wiped out the Valyrian Freehold.

The current novels have hinted that Melisandre is far older than she actually appears, however, and now the Season 6 premiere has confirmed that she casts a magical glamor over herself to give an appearance of youth when she is very old. Thus Kinvara is probably using a magical glamor of youth as well - and it seems fitting that an even more powerful priestess than Melisandre would be able to sustain a magical glamor of an even more youthful appearance.
