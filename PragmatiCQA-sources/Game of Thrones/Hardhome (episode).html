   , Wun Wun, and others are trapped inside the townhall, which is set upon by wights and catches fire – in the confusion, the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost.

   On top of a hill overlooking Hardhome, several White Walkers mounted on undead horses observe the battle, including the

   . Noticing them, and realizing the need for dragonglass, Jon and Loboda go to the burning townhall, only to be confronted by a
   White Walker
   warrior. While Loboda faces the threat, Jon Snow goes for the dragonglass. Loboda is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the White Walker's
   ice blade
   . Jon just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the White Walker. Jon retrieves
   Longclaw
   and defends himself against the White Walker and both combatants are astonished to see the

   Seizing the opportunity, Jon strikes the White Walker, shattering his body into fragments of ice, confirming that Valyrian steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass. The Night King, watching the entire battle from a distance, seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events. Meanwhile, Karsi fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children. Frozen by the horror, she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death. The White Walkers deploy another large host of wights, letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above Hardhome. Jon, Edd, Tormund and the remaining defenders flee for their lives.

   Shielded by Wun Wun, who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them, they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance. As Jon and the others look on in horror, the Night King raises his arms triumphantly; all around it, the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights, including Karsi. The Night King and his army continue to stare in silence as they retreat.

    to keep Jon informed of his status. The last that Jon hears from them as of the end of the most recent novel is a frantic and hastily written letter pleading for help, saying that they are surrounded by "dead things in the woods" and even "dead things in the water" (perhaps wights wading through the bay to attack their undefended side). Benioff and Weiss explain that they felt it was important to actually show what happened, and to send Jon Snow along as a POV character the audience is familiar with.

      following their defeat by Stannis. Ultimately many agree to his terms because they know that to stay north of the Wall with the White Walkers is certain death, though a large number fled back to Hardhome.

   </li>
   <li key="8c700e5f-cece-4b77-9d92-ea1d8e610f0b">
    The decision to actually show the
    Massacre at Hardhome
    , or at least to make it a major set battle sequence near the climax of the season, was actually made relatively late in production on Season 5, after extensive re-writes. Snorri Þórisson, the line producer in Iceland, explained in July 2014 that the original plan was to film the Hardhome sequence there in November 2015 (because other scenes set
    <a href="Beyond the Wall.html" key="88a8e4a5-b01d-4fd3-acee-4037ab0b7a95" title="Beyond the Wall">
     Beyond the Wall
    </a>
    were filmed on-location in Iceland), but after rewrites increased the size and scale of the battle sequence at Hardhome, these plans were canceled, and instead a fully realized set was built on-location at Magheramorne Quarry in Northern Ireland (the same quarry where the
    <a href="Castle Black.html" key="abbfdc2f-45f6-470f-806a-2533e7bf5d44" title="Castle Black">
     Castle Black
    </a>
    set is located). A larger fight sequence meant they needed three full weeks to film the battle, and the window for filming during Iceland's winter months was too small to accommodate it.
    These rewrites may have led to several continuity errors with the rest of the Night's Watch storyline later in Season 5 (see "Notes" for the next two episodes).
   </li>
   <li key="ed80243d-57e7-4af8-aea0-18d82d0c0f1d">
    The battle sequence at Hardhome took a full 15 days to film, and involved about 400 extras and 50 stuntmen.
    Ultimately about 220 extras were used: after training the original set in fighting moves, the producers then held "tryouts" by having them mock fight each other, then picked who they felt were the best ones.
    <ul key="b2ac55fa-9ba0-441c-8b7f-2a7ab6199796">
     <li key="b3c01b04-aa8b-4d7e-acb5-bef11390e831">
      Hardhome was built as a fully realized set in Magheramorne Quarry. Not only the buildings were real, but the entire wood log palisade wall, which was 300 feet long and 18 feet high.
     </li>
     <li key="6c212648-3b84-4a5d-b498-2e78222dcf40">
      At one point many wildlings start panicking and try to rush the boats on the shore to escape, but too many pile in, causing some of them to capsize. This was achieved entirely with practical effects: the production team actually brought a crane in to pull ropes which flipped over a rowing boat containing 15 stuntmen. The lake at the quarry was freezing, and a safety team was present in the water just off-camera in scuba gear to rescue anyone in case they got trapped or knocked unconscious.
     </li>
     <li key="f580041f-cb5a-4dc4-9ffb-7c5bd94099df">
      At one point, Benioff and Weiss's script for the battle was on an even larger scale, showing the army of the dead slaughtering the tens of thousands of wildlings camped outside of the palisade walls, with vast sweeping camera shots. As they explained with a chuckle in a behind the scenes featurette, director Miguel Sapochnik had to rein back the scale of what was shown, pointing out to them that it was well beyond what their budget would allow. Instead, Sapochnik suggested that only the fight within the palisade walls be shown, as the wildlings struggle to keep the wights from breaking in; the slaughter of the thousands of wildlings outside the walls is only heard as muffled screams through the walls. Benioff and Weiss liked this idea, not just because it would cost less, because they realized that one of the rules of horror film is that what is not directly seen but only hinted at is much more scary.

      This makes Jon only the second character in the TV series to have killed a White Walker (he has not yet in the novels because he didn't attend the
      battle of the Fist of the First Men
      and didn't go to Hardhome), after Samwell killed one back in Season 3. Jon is also the only one to have killed a wight (
      Othor
      back in Season 1, many more now), though in the novels, Samwell also killed a wight when he was fleeing south back to the Wall with Gilly.

      Interestingly, both weapons that are lethal to White Walkers are not particularly useful against their minions. Sam discovered it by trial-and-error in the novels: as he and Gilly are attacked by a wight, he stabs it at its back with a dragonglass dagger, but the dagger shatters to pieces; Sam manages to kill it by shoving a piece of burning wood into its mouth, setting it ablaze. Dragonglass isn't very useful against wights because it is very sharp but very brittle, shattering if used as a sword, better used as arrowheads and daggers. Against wights, dragonglass is just a sharp but brittle blade, when what is really needed are numerous hacking attacks to physically carve them apart. In contrast, a Valyrian steel sword isn't entirely useless - but unlike against the White Walkers, against the wights it is just a very sharp and very strong sword, which can cut through objects better than other weapons. Fire is still the best way to kill wights because they are very flammable, as if their flesh was coated in pitch (even a small flame will make their entire body quickly catch fire). Samwell asks Melisandre about this in the novels, saying, "The dragonglass only shattered when I tried to stab a wight," and she smiles and answers, "Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh. Steel and fire will serve for them. The ones you call the Others are something more" (in the novels the White Walkers are alternatively called "the Others").

        Because the wights that fall off the cliff onto the ground have to seamlessly transition into getting back up and attacking, interacting with the other actors, they couldn't be CGI for the entire shot. Instead, the stuntmen playing the wights fell from a safe height onto a box rig - so they would realistically bounce when they hit the "ground" before getting up again to fight.

The only people who have discussed her so far were her children (Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion) or their father Tywin, so understandably, they just referred to her as "mother" or "your mother" without giving her full name.

A major point is actually that at this stage in the war, those who have been fighting for years are nearly exhausted (the Starks, Lannisters, and Baratheons), while because the Arryns and Martells have remained neutral so far, they still have full and fresh armies which are now in a position to alter the game board significantly. Like the Tyrells, the Greyjoys have been in the war so far but they haven't been very badly bloodied yet - their main action was to declare their independence from the mainland and then make a few opportunistic raids against the North (a few of which were defeated by the Boltons, but their losses numbered in the

It is further odd that Tyrion doesn't mention the Martells, as due to the Lannisters murdering Elia Martell and her children the Martells would want revenge on the current regime and would be obvious allies for Daenerys. Tyrion may have thought that as Myrcella is betrothed to Trystane Martell the trouble could have ended, but considering the recent death of Oberyn Martell the rivalry between Dorne and the Iron Throne could be exploited.

In the deleted scene, Pycelle explains that he is loyal to Tywin because he has built House Lannister into the strongest House in Westeros, and he genuinely believes that the strongest House is the only one that can maintain peace and order over the fractious lords of the Seven Kingdoms. Tywin bluntly asks him what he will do if the Lannisters are no longer the strongest House, and he simply says that hopefully that will be generations from now, when he has long since been rotting comfortably in his grave. Cersei isn't the effective leader that Tywin was, however, and throughout the season Pycelle has become gradually disgusted with how she has been weakening the Lannisters: stacking the small council with sycophants like the disgraced ex-maester

If Stannis tries to simply surround Winterfell his forces would starve in the snow before the Bolton garrison does. Castles in Westeros are used to stockpiling food supplies for months or even years at a time during winter, so sieges can be quite lengthy if the garrison manages to gather enough food stores beforehand.

Stannis said last season that he had about 4,000 men left. Visually he had about 3,000 men at the

      Arya uses the name "Lanna" for her false persona. In the novels, she actually called herself "the Cat of the Canals" - a reference to
      Syrio Forel
      's training which urged her to be agile like a cat, and in memory of her mother

      . Arya in the TV series is older and wiser during her training, however, so she probably realized that using a variant of her mother's name from her past life was a bit conspicuous - and thus just picked a different name entirely. "Lanna" actually is the name of a minor character in Braavos, a prostitute mentioned in passing - it would seem that the TV writers re-used that name to try and still use a name that matched the Braavos setting. A small in-joke reference is made to Arya's "Cat of the Canals" pseudonym from the novels, however: just as she says that she walks to the canals every day with her cart, a
      cat
      crosses her path in the street.

      Genoa
