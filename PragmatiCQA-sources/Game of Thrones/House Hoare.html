   novels, House Hoare of Orkmont is an ancient ironborn family from the time of the First Men. During the era of the kingsmoot, several Hoares were chosen as kings. The most famous ironborn king in this era: under King Qhored Hoare the realm of the ironborn reached the peak of its expansion, and it was said that all the western coast of Westeros where the salt of the sea could be smelled or heard the crashing of waves were under their control. Although it is unlikely that this assertion is literal, since with all probability places like Oldtown or Lannisport have never been ruled from the Iron Islands, it is still remarkable that the ironborn could hold places as distant as the Arbor and

   House Greyiron put an end to the kingsmoots after seizing power and ruled as hereditary kings for 1,000 years, though the other ironborn Houses chafed under their rule. About 4,000 years ago, however, the Andals finally got around to conquering the Iron Islands - they had first invaded the eastern portions of Westeros 6,000 years ago, but it took them many centuries before they finally came to the Iron Islands, because they were far away on the western coast, separated from the mainland, and very poor in and of themselves making them not an attractive target.

   House Hoare was not an Andal family, but along with several other ironborn Houses they allied with invading Andal adventurers in order to overthrow the hated reign of the Greyirons. This is similar to how even

    House Lannister

   started out as a First Men family before intermarrying with the Andals. The head of House Hoare married the daughter of one of the Andal chieftains who came to the isles: in a subsequent contest House Hoare were proclaimed as the new hereditary kings of the Iron Islands.

   The Andals that came to the Iron Islands acculturated to the ironborn traditions, however, and little changed on the isles. House Hoare (now partially descended from the Andals) continued to rule the Iron islands for almost four thousand years.

   About three generations before the Targaryen Conquest, the ironborn under House Hoare entered into a new great age of conquest. The ironborn took all of the Riverlands from the Storm Kings, who had killed the last River King 300 years before. Harren the Black ordered the construction of Harrenhal, the greatest castle of the Seven Kingdoms, on the shores of the
   Gods Eye
   , a long away from the sea. The construction took forty years, and was finished the day Aegon I and his sisters landed in Westeros. Believing himself safe within his walls, Harren decided to remain within his castle. Aegon burned it with his dragon, incinerating Harren and his sons alive and thus ending the Hoare line.

  <p key="6b994c92-963e-41f0-8d78-91ee682f5375">
   Harren's own younger brother was
   Lord Commander of the Night's Watch
   at the time of the Targaryen Conquest, but kept to his vows of neutrality and stayed at the Wall instead of leaving to help his family, even as his own brother burned at Harrenhal and his entire House was wiped out.

  <p key="04ee9edc-1335-4e95-9bab-7ab1b78f9f8f">
   House Hoare officially went extinct when Harren died, but it only went extinct in the male-line. House Volmark, an ironborn noble family from
   Harlaw
   , descends from House Hoare through the female line (much as
   <a href="House Tyrell.html" key="252e74e1-329a-408a-b613-54ba936d6368" title="House Tyrell">
    House Tyrell
   </a>
   descends from the officially extinct
   House Gardener
   through the female line). Specifically, House Volmark claims descent from the younger sister of Harwyn Hoare, the grandfather of Harren Hoare. House Volmark never had a particularly strong claim against House Greyjoy, however, due to a combination of the ironborn being misogynistic and not placing much value on female-line descent, and because of the unusual elected-kingship customs of the Iron Islands. The Volmarks did try to lead uprisings against the Greyjoys in the first two generations after the Targaryen Conquest, but they had little support and were easily put down. House Volmark is still active in the present day.
