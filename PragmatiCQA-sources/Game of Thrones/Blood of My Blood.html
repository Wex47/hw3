   and the Iron Throne. Pursuing wights are also seen. Meera cannot go on any further and tries to wake Bran, who comes out of his visions to say "They've found us." She can hear wights approaching through the trees. With no more energy left to pull Bran, and barely enough to draw her sword, she apologises to Bran for failing him, as the wights come into sight.

  <p key="697ebf23-88b8-4e6f-84b0-b2d4f41d8a2b">
   Just as all appears hopeless, a mysterious rider appears and attacks the wights with a sickle and a flaming flail. Once the wights in the immediate vicinity have been dealt with, he urges Meera and Bran to come with him because "the dead don't rest," and they escape on horseback.

   Gilly, defending Sam from Randyll's verbal assault, mentions Sam's heroism on three different occasions in which Sam proved himself to be a greater warrior than Randyll will ever be. But in doing so, she inadvertently reveals her origins from North of the Wall. So Randyll doesn't seem to take in her point about Sam's qualities but instead only hears that she is a wildling.
  </p>
  <p key="3323615d-e1dc-4443-8c8e-cc2d0e06c456">
   Randyll reveals his prejudice towards wildlings and his contempt for Sam. Melessa, thoroughly angered by Randyll's behavior, declares that Sam isn't the one dishonoring House Tarly, Randyll is. She then storms out, taking Talla and Gilly with her. Randyll eventually agrees that Gilly and Little Sam can stay at Horn Hill; Gilly will work in the kitchens, and Little Sam will be acknowledged and raised as a

   Sam later apologises to Gilly for not standing up to his father and that he will be leaving at first light. However, he shortly returns to her, declaring that he has changed his mind, and says that they need to stay together as they belong with each other, and that they are all leaving right now. On the way out he takes

   The High Sparrow refuses and fends off Jaime's threats to kill all the Sparrows by saying each Sparrow yearns to die in the service of the Gods. After a tense few moments he proclaims it will not be necessary, as there will be no Walk of Atonement. Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the faith. To Jaime's astonishment the doors of the Sept open and King Tommen emerges, escorted by his own guards, and walks down the steps to join the High Sparrow and Margaery in a demonstration of unity between the crown and the faith. The crowd burst into cheers after Tommen's speech, demonstrating that the High Sparrow now has the support of both the crown and the smallfolk.

Cersei says that he should go to Riverrun and show everyone how easily a Lannister can take a castle, as to attack the High Sparrow and his fanatics would probably result in Jaime's death and destroy everything they are working for. She does not need Jaime to be in the city for her trial, it will be a trial by combat and she has the unbeatable

   As the play is finishing, she sneaks backstage and poisons Lady Crane's rum, hesitating before doing so. She is still backstage as the mummers come in, and Lady Crane recognises her as having been in the audience earlier. The two converse and Arya realises she has much in common with the actor. Arya suggests to Lady Crane that Cersei's final speech is out of character to the real Queen Mother – Cersei wouldn't be grief-stricken, she'd be outraged and out for vengeance. Impressed with Arya's insight, Lady Crane compliments her again and asks if she enjoys pretending to be someone else. Apparently uncomfortable at what she has done, or unsettled by the question, Arya makes an excuse that her father is waiting for her and she leaves.

    In the books, as Samwell and Gilly are heading south to the Wall, they are surrounded by dozen of wights. They are saved by a mysterious figure riding a giant elk, who keeps his face hidden, escorted by many ravens. He tells them he was sent to find someone, and Sam is not "the one." After Sam and Gilly cross paths with Bran and his companions as they head through the Wall in the opposite direction, this mysterious man joins Bran's group and escorts them north. This figure doesn’t identify himself. Sam and Gilly come up with the nickname "Coldhands" for him, given that his hands are as cold as a corpse’s – it soon becomes apparent that Coldhands is in fact some kind of reanimated corpse serving the Children, but unlike the wights, Coldhands's eyes are not glowing blue but black, he can talk and has a will of his own. He helps Bran and his companions reach the cave of the three-eyed raven, but does not enter with them, because the cave is magically warded against dead things.

     <li key="78b6a7a3-4d6b-46d2-997d-7fb50415696d">
      There has been rampant speculation among book-readers that Coldhands actually is Benjen Stark, somehow saved and changed by the Children of the Forest. A point against this is that when Bran asks Leaf about Coldhands, she says that the White Walkers killed him “a long time ago.”

      gave to his editor was later made public, with hand-written annotations from both of them. On one page, the editor circled Coldhands’s name and wrote “Benjen?” – but Martin responded by writing “NO” in capital letters next to it.

     <li key="2e3c77ea-a395-495c-a7e8-c0c323eda006">
      In the Inside the Episode featurette for this episode, however, Dan Weiss openly refers to him as “Coldhands Benjen.”

       <li key="665e0e57-7bce-47cd-9524-5efe3fc3234b">
        1 – Coldhands actually is Benjen in the novels; in which case, either Martin always knew and simply lied to his editor to keep it a total secret, or, Martin simply changed his mind at a later point.
       </li>
       <li key="874527aa-0fbe-4533-8721-d33f1f457575">
        2 – Coldhands and Benjen are separate characters in the novels, however, Benjen is now the same kind of creature Coldhands is – undead, not fully resurrected, but with his consciousness intact. In this case, Coldhands was foreshadowing Benjen’s return. Coldhands is the only person shown in the novels that the Children reanimated – but nothing says they didn’t reanimate others.
       </li>
       <li key="94c89c2a-70e6-4a07-9101-2855603dbd8d">
        3 – Coldhands and Benjen are separate characters in the novels, but Benjen never died and had to be reanimated, but was off doing other missions for the Children elsewhere - in which case the TV show is outright merging aspects of both characters together to simplify the narrative.

    The books don’t have a term for the kind of creature that Coldhands is (or that TV-Benjen is revealed to be now). As Benjen stated, he was impaled with a sword by a White Walker and left to die so they could reanimate him as a mindless wight, but the Children of the Forest intervened and plunged an enchanted dragonglass dagger through his heart to hold off the other part of the Walkers’ magic. He wasn’t “resurrected” the way Jon Snow and

    Benjen tells Bran that he is “the three-eyed raven” now. In the Inside the Episode featurette for the previous episode, the showrunners more clearly explained that the reason Bran didn’t immediately flee the cave when they knew the Night King was coming is because the old three-eyed raven was frantically “uploading” all of his memories and visions into Bran’s mind, so Bran could keep experiencing the visions even after he died. The way the showrunners describe it in the featurette for this episode, “three-eyed raven” is something of a title (perhaps used for the most powerful living
    Greenseer
    ?), but also much more than that: in some ways the old three-eyed raven’s memories live on in Bran, so he isn’t purely “Bran Stark” anymore but a mixture of the two.

    ’s appearance in the flashback oddly contradicts all other representations of him made by the TV series, particularly that he is outright cleanshaven. In the books, Aerys’s madness reached a point where he was too paranoid to allow any blades in his presence (except those of his Kingsguard), resulting in him not cutting his hair and beard for years. He also stopped cutting his fingernails - nor did he clean himself regularly. By the time of Robert’s Rebellion itself, Aerys looked like some kind of insane homeless vagabond: his filthy, matted hair was so long that it hung below his waist, his uncut nails several inches long. The odd point is that other parts of the wider “TV continuity” kept this detail: since Season 1, the
    Histories &amp; Lore
    animated featurettes included in the Blu-ray releases accurately depicted the Mad King with a long, unkempt beard. It is unclear why the TV series flashback changed this detail.
   </li>
   <li key="64442108-be38-4c46-92a5-cd41d651cb3f">
    Also in the brief flashback to Aerys II’s death, there were no dragon skulls in the Iron Throne room – which were stated to have only been removed after Robert Baratheon usurped the throne. Given how brief the flashback was it probably wouldn’t have justified the time and resources for the production team to make such substantial changes to the throne room set. An accurate point is that the throne room in the flashback has spiked iron braziers filled with burning fires around the support columns – not the decorative filigree design of vines and flowers seen on the columns in Season 1. When Joffrey redecorated the throne room in Season 2, he explicitly said he was restoring it to what it looked like back when the Targaryens were in power, because he thought it looked menacing and impressive. The symbol of the seven-pointed star set in the stained glass above the throne wasn’t present in Season 1 either, but was apparently another feature from the Targaryen era that Joffrey restored.

    These flashbacks are the first time other members of the
    Alchemists Guild
    have been depicted: before, only their leader Wisdom
    Hallyne
    appeared on-screen (in Season 2). It was unclear if Hallyne’s costume in Season 2 was meant to be some kind of uniform that all of the pyromancers wear, but the ones in the flashback are seen wearing the same costume he did. No particular mention has been made in the novels about whether or not members of the guild wear some kind of uniform. It’s possible the new costume team starting in Season 6 simply based their uniforms in the flashbacks on Hallyne’s costume in Season 2, extrapolating that it was some kind of uniform.

No mention is made in the TV series about who the crew was on the ship that Samwell and Gilly traveled on.

Daenerys was his last living relative, being the great-grandaughter of his younger brother, and news that she was both alive and had hatched new dragons briefly gave the dying Aemon a second wind, but it was not enough.

    Curiously, the episode presents it as if Samwell and Gilly actually arrived at Horn Hill first, and haven’t been to Oldtown yet. Oldtown is the main port for all of the southern half of the Reach, so their ship would probably have had to land there before they continued on to Horn Hill. Given that they debarked off-screen, it is entirely plausible they landed somewhere farther east like in the Stormlands and then just continued overland.

In the novels, Sam read in an ancient book at Castle Black that “dragonsteel” can kill White Walkers, and he and Jon speculate that this may mean Valyrian steel, but as of yet they haven’t been able to test this. Therefore, it is possible that in the next novel, Samwell will confirm in further readings through ancient books at the

    Hannah Murray (Gilly) and Kit Harington (Jon Snow) came up with a prank to play on
    John Bradley-West
    (Samwell) this season, sort of to make up for that fact that his co-star Murray had to have such an ugly costume all this time and he didn't. The showrunners thought it was hilarious and went along with it: they scheduled Bradley-West for a fitting at the costume department in a ridiculous new outfit that looked like some absurd variation on something Henry VIII would have worn. Surprisingly, Bradley-West didn't realize it was a prank at all - he rationalized that the show has never actually shown what people in the south of the Reach dress like before, and Samwell was supposed to be a bit of a bookish fop yet son of a powerful nobleman before he came to the Wall, so he thought that it was meant to be an in-universe joke that Samwell's formal wear at dinner was supposed to look silly.

    has some similarities to the Tyrells but also several differences. The difference is quite notable because the Tyrells themselves also appear prominently in the episode (albeit Margaery isn’t wearing her signature style, but Olenna is along with their servants).

      emulate the style of the Lannisters’ clothing, and even their servants wear simplified imitations of their style (i.e. Cersei’s handmaidens dress like her). The Tyrells’ personal servants previously seen in King’s Landing also emulate how the main Tyrell family tresses.

      The Tyrell style of dress seen with Margaery and her handmaidens is plunging necklines, short cuffed shoulders (to contrast with Cersei’s long billowing sleeves), and sometimes backless gowns which show more skin. The dresses for Margaery and Olenna also have a symmetrical cut running down the exact middle of the torso – this is to contrast with Cersei’s Lannister style, which also has a cut running down the front, but which is off-center and asymmetrical. Margaery and her handmaidens also wear their hair swept back away from the face – both to show more skin, and to contrast which how Cersei wore her long hair down, as if shielding her body like armor.
     </li>
     <li key="4b3a14d5-4733-4bbd-93b4-dcabd5b82559">
      The Tarly style, in contrast, has very large puffy shoulder pieces – the Tyrell shoulders are short and peaked (though neither of them are like the long wrist-length draped sleeves of the Lannister style). Talla’s dress that she lent to Gilly even has form-fitting wrist-length sleeves beneath the large shoulder pieces. The Tyrell style has a symmetrical cut running down the middle, but the Tarly style is entirely one piece on the front of the torso (it sews up in the back, not the front). The Tarly neckline is more of a broad U-shape, not the sharp plunging neckline of Margaery’s Tyrell gowns; none of them are shown with backless gowns. Moreover, the color scheme is entirely different – not the greens, teals, and golds of the Tyrells (from their rose sigil), but the colors of the Tarly’s own sigil, primarily warm reds with dark green as a secondary color (as their sigil is a red huntsman on a green background, and the Tyrells also have a green background, they plausibly could wear green colors just like the Tyrells – but they choose not to, emphasizing the color in their heraldry that the Tyrells don’t use). Their hairstyles are somewhat more like the Tyrells but not exactly: Melessa wears some of her hair up but parts also spill down her front – sort of like the earlier stages in Maragery’s style before she perfected it. Talla’s hair, meanwhile, is exactly like the style of Margaery’s handmaidens – possibly because Talla is younger and thus more imitative. When the Tarly women clean and style Gilly’s hair, however, it isn’t swept up at all but falls completely down.

    That the Tarlys’ costume style does not imitate the style of their Tyrell overlords actually matches their backstory quite well, and was probably a very deliberate choice by the costume designers. A plot point in the novels is that the Tyrells actually didn’t use to be kings over the region they rule, the way the Starks were kings in the North and the Lannisters were kings over the Westerlands. The ruling family of the Reach (
    House Gardener
    ) was destroyed during the

    to them. The Tyrells do descend from House Gardener through the female line, but many other families in the Reach actually had a better claim to Highgarden –

     House Florent
    </a>
    is even a
    cadet branch
    of House Gardener, with direct male-line descent. Therefore, many deride the Tyrells as “upjumped stewards”, and it is a plot point that many of their vassals do not respect them the way that the Starks’ and Lannisters’ vassals respect them because they used to be their royal families. Melessa Tarly herself was outright born a member of House Florent, and thus probably wouldn’t have great love for the Tyrells. Instead, the Tyrells’ hold over every vassal House in the Reach is somewhat loose, and they have to be masters of court intrigue to keep them all in line. Thus it makes sense that the Tarlys actually don’t emulate the exact same costume style as their Tyrell overlords.

      made absolutely no attempt to emulate the Tullys’ style of dress at all, because they outright resented their rule. Thus just as the Freys didn’t dress in the same style as the Tullys, the Tarlys don’t dress in the same style as the Tyrells – hinting at their somewhat more decentralized hold over the Reach.

      The Tarlys have further reason to not feel compelled to emulate the Tyrells. In ancient times, the Tarlys actually were kings – albeit not over all of the Reach, but over their own petty kingdom in the eastern portions, in the foothills of the

      </a>
      . The Reach as a whole used to be divided between four petty kingdoms: the two big ones were the Gardeners in the north and the Hightower in the south, but the Tarlys ruled their own small petty kingdom in the southeast in the foothills of the
      <a href="Red Mountains.html" key="872c0e45-bf9a-4f99-a319-8078fdcf1723" title="Red Mountains">

      House Redwyne
      used to rule the

      The Reach is in several ways analogous to real-life medieval France: both are the “heartland of chivalry” and both are very large and populous kingdoms, offset by a large number of hostile borders which they have to divide their larger armies between (negating the advantage they have from their large populations). In the real life Middle Ages, there was a major cultural divide between northern and southern France, the north with a continental climate and heavy soils and the south with a Mediterranean climate. Similarly, there appears to be a major divide in the Reach between the northern and southern halves, divided by the
      Mander
      River. In ancient times, the Gardener kings (and their Tyrell stewards) ruled over the northern half from Highgarden, while the southern half was ruled over by the kings of
      House Hightower
      from their seat at

      . This divide extended to the point that during the

      </a>
      , the north and south of the Reach outright joined opposite sides in the war, dividing the region in half. Thus, historically, there is also much to justify that families from the southern half of the Reach like the Tarlys have very different looks and fashions from those in the north like the Tyrells.

    Gilly's son
    Baby Sam
    appears prominently in this episode. Continuing from his previous brief appearance earlier in the season, this raises some issues with the TV series'
    Timeline
    . Two years are stated to pass between Season 1 and Season 3, and Gilly's son was born in Season 3, but afterwards it is unclear how much time is supposed to be passing in the TV series, i.e. at a steady pace of one year of story time per TV season to keep up with how fast the child actors are aging, or perhaps slowing down (events in the novels took less time). The only other hint about the passage of time is that Roose Bolton said in the Season 3 finale that he was going to marry Walda Bolton, then in Season 5 she said she was pregnant, and in early Season 6 gave birth. Thus

    around one year must have passed since Season 3, but if one TV season equals one year, as many as three years may have passed since then. Gilly's son brings this issue into focus because he was outright born in Season 3. Samwell and Gilly arrive back in the Reach in the fourth novel, when her son is still only about one year old and thus "a baby". If time is moving slower in the TV version, her son shouldn't be "a baby" anymore but possibly a "toddler" up to 3 years old. The TV series has apparently addressed this possibly discrepancy by being deliberately ambiguous: the child actor they cast to play Gilly's son this season is clearly bigger than a one year old baby and looks around 2 to 3 years old, but they avoid stating exactly how old he is.

Like the Lannisters they are one of the more wealthy of the kingdoms, so they can afford to give their infantry a large amount of steel plate (in contrast to the Northerners, who mostly have just leather armor and chainmail). As the Reach is the heartland of chivalry in Westeros, unlike the Lannisters their armor looks much more like “classic” Western European armor.

    from his position, with both men taking off their armor on the spot and throwing it on the ground in anger. Tommen even uses similar phrases when dismissing Jaime ("You have served your house and your king faithfully"). Tommen, however, does not act on a whim, nor does he humiliate Jaime so bluntly, nor does he completely dismiss him. Even Cersei admits that Jaime can still further the Lannister cause extremely effectively. Moreover, in sharp contrast to Selmy's dismissal, except Kevan and the guards - no one else is present at Jaime's dismissal, and no one taunts him.

      As explained above, in the books Jaime is already in the Riverlands dealing with the Tullys and Freys, so he doesn’t need to be sent there. Indeed when he receives Cersei's letter, in which she informs him about her imprisonment and trial by the Faith and begs him to save her, he burns the letter in disgust; he knows well that his treacherous sister is guilty of all the heavy crimes she is charged with (among them incest, fornication and the murders of Robert and the previous High Septon) and has no intention to save her, even he had both hands.

     <li key="a4e6c0e7-8eda-4803-8eea-be2df00e1730">
      In the books, Jaime is never dismissed from the Kingsguard, because he wasn’t present to confront the Faith Militant – and as Barristan pointed out they are meant to serve for life. A king can demote a member from being the

      but not from the organization entirely – though even in the books, there have been some precedents for dismissing a man from the Kingsguard (following Selmy's dismissal, Ser
      Boros Blount
      was also dismissed from the Kingsguard, though temporarily). In Season 4, Tywin even said he would pressure the old
      High Septon
      to grant Jaime a special reprieve to release him from his vows – given that the

     <li key="e5d191b2-0f9c-4b55-b1e1-8d5c54b46297">
      If the TV series has outright dismissed Jaime from not just his position as Lord Commander but as a member of the Kingsguard, this would theoretically make him
      Lord of Casterly Rock
      since Tywin is dead, and he comes ahead of his sister in line of succession. In the books, after Cersei’s imprisonment, their uncle

      steps in to take over rule of House Lannister and has no intention of letting Cersei wield power again, as she nearly destroyed their family with her inept leadership.

The only difference is that as a result the TV show didn’t insert Bronn into the background in various minor scenes, just to establish that he is still in the storyline (as done in past seasons before a character’s main storyline picks up). Overall the TV show was able to work around his schedule without any major difficulty. Given Jaime’s line about giving Bronn a sack of gold to make an assassination, apparently Bronn has just been in the background, off-screen in King’s Landing up to this point.

      In the books, when Tyrion kills Tywin at the end of the third novel, Tywin dies in agony as feces from his bowels pours out of the open wound, and then when he dies he voids his bowels. The chapter is told from Tyrion’s internal POV narration, and in his inner thought monologue as he walks away Tyrion bitterly thinks the wry observation that “Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold.” The TV version omitted this line when Tyrion killed Tywin – probably because it would have been very difficult to portray on-screen: it’s one thing for Tyrion to have a wry thought about his father’s death in his inner monologue, but the TV version couldn’t use that, and to have Tyrion verbally cracking a joke aloud at Tywin’s corpse wouldn’t have matched the serious tone of the scene in either the book or TV versions; as a part of the hilarious play, though, the joke seems to fit perfectly.

    ". Official promo images for the Season 5 finale actually showed Arya retrieving Needle from that Wall, but this did not appear in that aired episode. Southern-unit production for the TV show shifted almost all of its locations from Croatia to Spain in Season 6 (except for a few pickup shots), so what probably seems to have happened is that back in Season 5 the production team knew they wouldn’t be able to return to the on-site filming location in Croatia the next year, so they filmed Arya retrieving Needle - now in her Lanna costume, which she wasn’t wearing when she hid it there in the first place. Given that Arya hid her sword in a specific wall they couldn’t simply reproduce that part of Braavos in a different location in Spain.

      subplot: the characters don't show up again for a considerable amount of time, and the showrunners were uncertain if they could fit their subplots into the show at a later point, so the actors had to hope with the audience that one day they would return. Like the Greyjoy subplot in Season 6, the Frey/Tully subplot starting now actually happened in the fourth novel - contemporaneous with Cersei's rule as regent (before her arrest). Had the TV series only run for seven seasons these subplots might even have been omitted entirely, but the confirmation after Season 5 that HBO was willing to stick with the series through eight seasons allowed these delayed subplots to be worked back in.

      As Menzies also pointed out in his interview, Edmure isn't supposed to look starved or heavily tortured: he didn't have a hellish imprisonment like Theon Greyjoy did, the Freys needed him alive as a valuable hostage so they kept him reasonably well fed and healthy - though he's still been somewhat mistreated and roughed up.

      The interview also directly asked Menzies if Edmure was in the Freys' dungeons for a full two and a half years since he was captured at the end of Season 3. Menzies responded that he actually doesn't know how much time is supposed to have passed between the Season 3 finale and his return in this episode. This touches upon the issue with the TV series's
      Timeline
      that while it was stated that Season 3 was two years after Season 1 (so that one TV season equals on year in the story), it is unclear how much time is meant to have passed by Season 6 - it could be as much as three years or at the least around one year. Menzies said he had the impression that Edmure has been imprisoned for at least one full year, but he didn't know more beyond that (in the books it was closer to one year, but time may move more slowly in the TV version).

    is a holdover from the fourth novel, just like the Greyjoy Kingsmoot subplot. Season 5 condensed most of the fourth and fifth novels into one season, for several major characters such as Cersei, Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon Snow, but it was impossible to fit every single subplot into one season, so others were either omitted or pushed back to Season 6. This results in the TV version having to slightly rearrange events to reintroduce the Siege of Riverrun subplot:

       Brynden “The Blackfish” Tully
      </a>
      didn’t go to the Red Wedding – instead Robb Stark left his great-uncle with the Tully army at Riverrun to hold their southern flank. The TV show had Brynden present at the Red Wedding but he happened to step out of the main hall to relieve himself right before the ambush began, thus he was able to simply fight his way out of the attack on the camps outside, and Roose Bolton subsequently tells Walder Frey he’s concerned about his escape. Apparently the TV version wanted to lull viewers into a false sense of security by having Brynden physically present at the wedding (it would seem improbable that the entire Stark faction would soon be wiped out if all of them were present in the same location).
     </li>
     <li key="7ceeefb1-b246-40b7-a450-00430ef41ed1">
      In the novels, therefore, Riverrun never needed to be “retaken” because it never falls to the Lannisters or Freys in the first place: Brynden pulled back most of his remaining men to the castle, gathered large amounts of supplies well in advance of the invading armies, and set in for a lengthy siege. The Siege of Riverrun begins in the middle of the third novel (after the Red Wedding) and continues as a running subplot for much of the fourth novel until Jaime arrives there – the siege isn’t directly shown before that, but is going on in the background of the narrative, as characters sporadically receive reports that the siege is still ongoing. Seeing no need to waste men taking the castle given that the Tullys had no hope of rescue, the Frey army simply settled in to surrounding the castle to wait the garrison out, for months or years if need be.
     </li>
     <li key="a9e19692-581a-41b2-bd91-36f8ffaa2074">
      In the TV version, Brynden apparently spent the past two seasons off-screen rallying the remaining Tully forces that were in the field and regrouping them. Then, he retook Riverrun in a surprise attack, quickly overwhelming the light Frey garrison that wasn’t expecting him, because Brynden knows the layout of the castle much better than they do. Apparently the TV version changed it so that Brynden “retakes” the castle because it might have been awkward to introduce that Brynden was besieged at Riverrun for the past two seasons off-screen but no one thought to mention it in this entire time. It is unclear why the last two seasons didn’t introduce that Brynden is besieged at Riverrun – the exact circumstances of who actually controlled Riverrun at that time was left deliberately ambiguous. At most it was said that the Lannisters had named Walder Frey as the new lord of Riverrun, but whether he actually managed to take the castle was left unsaid. One possibility is that the showrunners were uncertain if the Siege of Riverrun storyarc could be introduced at all before confirmation that the TV series would last for eight seasons and not only seven; the other possibility is that they intentionally didn’t introduce it as early as Season 4 because they feared the audience wouldn’t remember it across so long a time period.

    The North’s armies were totally destroyed in the massacre at the Red Wedding – but the armies of their Riverlands allies were not present at the massacre, and still remained relatively intact. Nonetheless, they had just lost all of their Northmen allies, Robb Stark was dead with no apparent heir, and they now faced the brunt of the combined Lannister/Tyrell armies – leaving them still hopelessly outnumbered. Moreover, because the Riverlands are located south of the

    , they also had no natural defenses or choke points to defend against these enemy armies. As a result, after the Red Wedding most of the River-lords simply surrendered rather than face annihilation – though even this quick surrender ultimately meant that most of their soldiers survived to fight another day. Thus in the books the Freys are having trouble maintaining a firm hold over the Riverlands and several major castle-seats remain besieged but defiantly unconquered.

      In contrast, when Stannis and Jon Snow later try to rally the vassal Houses in the North (as occurs in Season 6), most of their armies were destroyed so all they have left are a handful of young boys and old men – thus while the Lannisters won’t send the Boltons any armies to help them hold the North, the local forces have been so drastically reduced that they think the Bolton army alone is capable of handling them. The Riverlords still have far more men, but as seen here the Lannisters are capable of quickly sending proportionately larger armies into the Riverlands to deal with them.

      and

      have also risen against them. In the books, none of those has taken active rebellious actions against the Freys: most of the Riverlords simply surrendered after the Red Wedding, but along with the Tullys at Riverrun, Lord Tytos Blackwood also refuses to surrender and remains besieged in his castle-seat at
      Raventree Hall
      . Thus Raventree didn't "rebel" either, but has remained uncaptured albeit besieged this entire time. In the fifth novel, Jaime arrives at Raventree Hall and persuades (non-violently) Lord Blackwood to surrender (it does not happen in the show).

Given that there are several dozen Frey family members, this hasn't significantly impacted their military capacity yet, though they do find it insulting.

    There are many dozens of Frey characters in the books, and at least a dozen who perform distinct actions. The TV series has, understandably, heavily condensed most of their actions and given them to only two of Walder’s sons (though Walder is said to have numerous children and dozens of grandchildren, they’re just in the background in the TV version). As Lord Walder recalls in the episode, during the Red Wedding, Lame Lothar stabbed Robb’s wife

    to death while Black Walder slit Catelyn’s throat. In the books, Robb’s wife Jeyne Westerling wasn’t even present at the Red Wedding and is still alive (and was not pregnant with any child by Robb). Instead, as somewhat alluded in the TV version, Lame Lothar is the steward of the Twins and his father’s right-hand man, cunning and intelligent, and responsible for carrying out the fine details of broad objects his father sets. Lord Walder may have decided to betray the Starks, but it was Lame Lothar who planned out the fine details of how and when the ambush would occur and assigned specific tasks to each group of Freys. Meanwhile, “Black Walder” in the TV version is a condensation of two major Frey characters, along with a third minor one. In the books, “Black Walder Frey” is one of Lord Walder’s great-grandsons, and Catelyn sees him killing several Tully vassals during the massacre in the main hall; “Walder Rivers” is Lord Walder’s eldest bastard son, and he commands the Frey soldiers in the assault on the Stark army in its own camp outside the castle walls. The TV version combined them both into one character, officially named “Black Walder Rivers”. Also, Catelyn’s throat was slit by Raymund Frey – a very minor character who hasn’t reappeared since, so the TV version gave it to their version of Black Walder (given that Black Walder was present in the main hall in the book version).

    in the TV version but not in the books. Therefore, Walder’s new ninth wife who he got to replace her is an invention of the TV series (and so far, her name hasn’t been established). In the books, Catelyn’s last desperate act was to hold one of Walder’s
    lackwit
    (mentally disabled) grandsons hostage with a knife to his throat, but Walder bluntly said she could go ahead and kill him because he wasn’t of much use (displaying that he hypocritically doesn’t really value his own family members). Rather than introduce too many new characters, the TV version just streamlined this so Catelyn grabbed his wife Lady Joyeuse instead, and ultimately killed her as Walder said she was replaceable.

The Freys send about half of their forces to besiege Riverrun, roughly 2,000 men - thus, if they're basing this on the books, the numbers actually are accurate that the Tullys'

    In the Inside the Episode featurette, the showrunners point out that Daenerys is expressly quoting the speech that Drogo made in Season 1 episode “

    While Daenerys has surpassed her current content from the novels, it seems as if the scene with Drogon from this episode and her burning of all the assembled khals in episode 4 “

    Histories &amp; Lore
    ” featurettes for Season 3 stressed that the Dothraki fear only two things: the ocean and dragons. They fear travel on the sea because they don’t trust any water a horse won’t drink, and think it therefore must be poisoned. Meanwhile, for many centuries, the Dothraki were kept in check by the

    , with the dragons all gone, did the Dothraki dare to sweep out of the eastern plains and attack the rest of Essos. Apparently the Dothraki fear the power of dragons to the point of almost religious awe.

      In the TV version, in the “Inside the Episode” featurette for “Book of the Stranger”, the showrunners stressed that they wanted Daenerys to defeat and kill the khals without outside help – even help from her own dragon. This may hint that they actually split one event from the novels into two different scenes, removing Drogon from Vaes Dothrak. With Drogon removed, in order for Daenerys to set the fire herself, they simply had the Dothraki keep multiple braziers of fire -which were top-heavy enough that a 5’2’’ tall girl could easily knock them over - inside of a very flammable thatched tent. The Dothraki might be stunned that Daenerys wasn’t burned in the previous TV episode, but they would be even more impressed by a live dragon, which to them is practically a demigod. Then again, no one is sure what exactly will happen in the next novel, and it may play out as in the TV version.

    In the episode, Daenerys talks with Daario as she rides about her realization that she is a conqueror, not a peacemaker – she doesn’t compromise with her enemies but takes what she wants with fire and blood. In the novels she came to a similar decision in her last chapter, while she was still stranded with her wounded dragon before the Dothraki captured her – though the chapter did it in a way which would have been difficult to portray on-screen, with Daenerys delirious from thirst and actually “conversing” with vivid hallucinations/memories of characters who aren’t really there.
