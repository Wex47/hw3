   In Winterfell itself, Sansa uses a corkscrew she pocketed earlier to escape her room, and seeks out the tower to light her signal. After the candle is lit, she sees the Boltons clash with Stannis's army and sees this as a time to slip out of Winterfell. Desperately running across the ramparts, she is stopped by

Myranda tells Sansa that Ramsay needs her to have an heir and for nothing more afterward - but says Ramsay does not need all of Sansa in one piece to accomplish that. Sansa braces herself for the worst as Myranda tenses her bow. However, Theon finally breaks the Boltons' hold on him and causes Myranda to misfire. He grabs and hurls Myranda over the ramparts and Myranda screams as she hurtles to her death, being killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below. Sansa and Theon run, but with Ramsay just returning from the battle, they find themselves with nowhere to go. Hoping to land in deep snow and survive the long fall, the two of them grasp their hands together and jump off the rampart.

Raff went to Braavos as a guard for the Master of Coin sent to treat with the Iron Bank. Raff in the novels is interested in perversely young girls, and Arya does attempt to seduce him - but them stabs him and sadistically repeats the words Raff taunted Lommy with, making him beg her to carry him before killing him. She doesn't need to steal a Faceless Man mask because Raff doesn't recognize her (she is much older and dressed differently than when they last met and she was disguised as a boy - though Meryn knew Arya much better than Raff, from her time in the Red Keep, so it makes sense that she would need a disguise for him in the TV series).

Retroactively this might give more sadistic implications to Meryn beating up Sansa at Joffrey's command back in Seasons 2 and 3, Beattie acknowledged, but he also said he wasn't aware they were going to condense these elements of Raff's character into his back then - apparently the condensation was only decided on in Season 5 or maybe in Season 4 - so he didn't play his scenes with Sansa like that (just that Meryn blindly follows orders, no matter how ridiculous).

Polliver was killed in a fight with Sandor and Arya at an inn, but Arya taunted him the way she did Raff when she killed him in the novels.

The process involves a blood magic ritual to help the face bond to the wearer as if alive. Then again the TV series moves this around slightly to still say that Arya goes blind from wearing the face, because it is dangerous for untrained people to try to use it. In the book, Arya is given a poisoned drink as punishment, and wakes up blind.

      Apparently, when Arya returns to the House of Black and White, "Jaqen" was one Faceless Man, and another one was impersonating the
      Waif
      . The Waif is an acolyte, she can't shapeshift - so it isn't clear if in this specific episode, what we see is a Faceless Man

      they were all the same individual shapeshifter. Alternatively, the "Jaqen" who dies in this episode actually was the man she was talking to throughout the season - but the Faceless Men consider themselves to be "no one" to such an extent that they view themselves as interchangeable. After all, the entire "

      " identity was just a false persona that the shapeshifter had adopted. It remains unclear if Arya ever even met that same shapeshifter from Season 2 again after she arrived in Braavos, or if this was just another Faceless Man the entire time. In the novels, it actually was a different Faceless Man, whom she nicknames "The Kindly Man". The writers intentionally left the situation cryptic (as it is supposed to be in the story); when directly asked,

      In the books, it is strongly implied that another assassination in Westeros (which has not occurred in the TV show) was carried out by the "Jaqen H'ghar" that Arya met at Harrenhal, explaining why he was in Westeros in the first place. This other assassination and Arya's arrival in Braavos happen reasonably close to each other in time, and the distance between Westeros and Braavos is great enough, to imply that "the Kindly Man" and "Jaqen from Harrenhal" can't be the same individual. Thus there was some confusion with the TV writers that they were omitting this other subplot and instead stating that the same individual Faceless Man that Arya met at Harrenhal simply returned to Braavos - though again, Cogman remained coy that there is no one "Jaqen". Instead, it is entirely possible that the "Jaqen from Harrenhal" remained in Westeros and may yet be encountered next season.

    (Arya Stark) explained how difficult it was to shoot the scene of her pulling face after face off of the dead Faceless Man: "It was very, very complicated. It was madness, actually, when I think about what we did. I had a body double on set that day [for the last shot, when the final face is her own]. You know the cloak that Jaqen was wearing? They made the hood of the cloak out of wire. It was rigid, so the fabric wouldn't move and fall about. Then each different person would lie into the rigid cloak, and they'd shoot my hand doing the motion of taking off the face. Then I got in, and my double did the hand motion over me. So I met, like, seven different people all for three seconds each. They cut it all together in post-production to made it look like they were taking off faces."

    When Arya goes blind at the end, the clouded look in her eyes is not a CGI effect at all: Maisie Williams actually wore large, 16 millimeter-wide contact lenses. They did not simply give her eyes the appearance of being blind, but cannot be seen through. Thus when Arya is wildly turning around unable to see her surroundings, Williams genuinely couldn't see anything.
    Incidentally this fits with Williams's previous efforts to play Arya's physicality as described in the novels: Arya is described as left-handed in the books, so Williams has pervasively played her as left-handed, even though in real life she is right handed (to the point that she performs all of her swordfighting or archery moves left-handed). Book-Arya is now blind, and correspondingly, Williams's special contact lenses make her

    , reporters on a set visit noticed a debate happening among the production team on set regarding a nude male extra (apparently the man who flashes Cersei). The extra was clearly circumcised, but no major religion in Westeros practices circumcision (or apparently even in Essos), so they weren't sure if they should retain the actor - however they ultimately decided the shot was so brief that no one would notice.

        most of all, because it was his idea to send Myrcella to Dorne in the first place - even though her father Tywin later confirmed the marriage-alliance because he thought it was a good idea, too.

The Tyrells are actively trying to undermine Cersei and consolidate their own power, but she also blames them for things that they logically could not have done. So it is in keeping with the novels that she would focus her blame for this on Tyrion moreso than on the Martells themselves. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) was also spoken with in the same interview, and he implied that he thought Trystane would indeed end up as a hostage in King's Landing - though offering no explanation as to why Ellaria would endanger Doran's son this way.

    Myrcella hasn't been shown to know that Jaime is really her father in the novels. On the other hand, she is described as being by far the smartest of Cersei's children - just as out of Tywin's three children, it was Tyrion who inherited the famous Lannister intellect, so too among Cersei's children, it was Myrcella who inherited the family intellect. Tyrion has also complained to Cersei in the novels that it was obvious to anyone who spent a long time living in the Red Keep, and was willing to consider the shocking possibility, that none of Cersei's children were Robert's. Tyrion bluntly asks her if she thinks he is as blind as their father is - Tywin was smart enough to see the clues if he

    According to actress
    Nell Tiger Free
    in a later interview at MYM Buzz in June 2017, Myrcella's death was originally supposed to be more graphic. The exact details are unclear, but apparently the reaction to the poison was going to be so violent that she would cough up pieces of what Nell thought was her brain: "...originally what happened is they gave me those mashed up bananas with like blood fake blood, and my brains were supposed to be all over the ship and stuff." Nell believed that the producers ultimately cut this out and had her death relatively quick "because they wanted Myrcella’s death to reflect her life, and wanted it to be sweet — which is rare for [Game of] Thrones.”

Previously, Stannis told the Iron Bank in Season 4 that he had about 4,000 men left, perhaps including the baggage train, as when he attacks at Castle Black a visual count shows that he had around 3,000 men. Previously in Season 5, Roose Bolton said that his scouts reported Stannis's army, swelled by foreign sellswords, numbered about 6,000 men - meaning that half of his army were sellswords.

The Bolton army actually numbers a little over 2,000 - it seems larger because they are mounted and Stannis's men are on foot, though cavalry are worth more than infantry. Stannis's men were also exhausted from their grueling march through the snow, while the Bolton forces were fresh - you can even see that many men in the rear of Stannis's army break and flee, though Stannis in the front holds firm. Going by these figures, it would seem that what Stannis's officer meant that "Many men deserted before dawn, nearly half",

    The "deaths" of Jon Snow, Stannis Baratheon, and Myrcella Baratheon were filmed somewhat ambiguously, compared to actually seeing their corpses - Jon is badly injured and dying, Myrcella falls poisoned, and Brienne swings her sword but we don't see it actually connect with Stannis. The attack on Jon plays out much the same way in the novels: he is stabbed multiple times, falls to the ground and at least loses consciousness, but then the chapter ends on a cliffhanger. The HBO Viewer's Guide lists all three as "deceased".

Coupled with several other casting announcements, it appears that Season 6 actually will cover several subplots that were skipped from the most recent novel (see below). However, most of Season 6 will still be based on a single book, which probably means it won't be as heavily condensed as Season 5 was.

    's naked
    walk of atonement
    is loosely based on what happened to
    Jane Shore
    , the mistress of King Edward IV of England (who, like Robert Baratheon, was a great warrior who won the crown on the battlefield in his youth, but became fat and ill-suited to rule in later life). After Edward IV died his brother Richard III usurped the throne ahead of his nephews. He deeply resented Jane, so he had her arrested and made her perform a penance walk, a common punishment for harlotry. Jane Shore did not perform the penance walk naked, however, but had to walk barefoot through the streets of London wearing only her kirtle (petticoat), which given the times was still said to have gained significant male attention (the main source of the humiliation was that this was a punishment normally meted out to harlots). Martin has said that the Wars of the Roses were one of the major inspirations for his novels: the conflict was between the Yorks and Lancasters, while in Westeros the conflict is between the Starks and Lannisters (clearly named after the real families).

Cersei's wig does not undergo any chemical processing at all (which is used on some of the other wigs to make them the exact color they need to be). Rather, the wig maker sourced individual colors and strands of hair, which were then individually knotted onto a lace cap one strand at a time to achieve the perfect golden blonde blend.
    While it is unconfirmed if the Cersei wig cost $7,000 dollars, it is certainly one of the more expensive and elaborate wigs used in the TV series, easily costing several thousand dollars. It isn't clear if the actual Cersei wig was destroyed in the scene where Cersei is shorn, or if it was a stand-in wig.

That's an immediate feeling. It's really important. What was slightly daunting was what was going to be taken away. It can change how you feel, but it can't change how she is." Headey also said that she still wears a different wig after Cersei's hair is shorn, instead of dying her own hair, "a really heavily, heavily cropped cut-up wig."

    Lena Headey (Cersei) isn't actually naked in the walk of atonement scene: actress
    Rebecca Van Cleave
    served as a nude body double, and Headey's head was then digitally added onto van Cleave's body (her neck doesn't quite match in some shots if you look carefully, and the body isn't exactly her height and shoulder width). The producers did try very hard to find a double whose body frame matched Headey's: 1,000 actresses applied to be the double, and of these seven finalists were flown to Belfast so the producers could choose the one that most closely matched. Headey was asked if she wanted to help pick out the body double but she declined, saying, "I was like, 'Listen guys, she happens to have a beautiful body, but I don't do casting. If somebody is brave enough to do this, I applaud it." Headey was present with Van Cleave during actual shooting: she would walk her double through each shot, giving step-by-step insight into Cersei's mindset. Van Cleave was fully nude, Headey wore a simple beige shift. They would then alternate between shots, with Headey stepping in for those close-ups that didn't involve full nudity (thus Headey actually did "perform" the barefoot walk through the streets, though the camera wasn't always on her). Because Headey was present during all of the jeering by the crowd of extras, she said it helped give a genuine emotional reaction when she appeared on-screen for closeup shots. Van Cleave said: "Lena was so good about walking beside me and guiding me into what Cersei was thinking and the movements. We were playing tag team — 'You’re it!' — and trying to make light of the fact we’re all covered in everything and going through this together." The large crowds used in the scene contained 500 extras. The entire sequence took three consecutive days to film.
    There were initially some objections about doing the nude walk in Dubrovnik's streets, made by the Church of St. Nicholas which is located about 60 meters north of where the walk ends. They later withdrew their objections on the condition that it not actually cross into holy ground.

      Why a body double was used was unclear at the time - given that Headey has done nude scenes before (such as in the film

      ), and back in March 2014, she even spoke about the upcoming scene in such a way that it seemed she was interested in performing it herself.
      Headey only said that she chose not to perform the nude scene "for several reasons".
      One possible but unconfirmed explanation was that in February 2015 (after filming had ended), Headey revealed that she was pregnant with her second child - but she was so upset about how the media had been invasive about the divorce of her first marriage that she would not reveal who the father was, or any other details about her personal life. Months later, Lena Headey announced via Twitter that she gave birth to her daughter on July 10, 2015.
      The scene, however, was filmed in the first week of October, 2014.
      Subtracting nine months of pregnancy from July 10, 2015, Headey probably only conceived her second child around mid-October, maybe early October at the earliest - so Headey probably

      pregnant when this scene was filmed, but conceived the week after it (assuming this wasn't an overly long pregnancy). Moreover, filming of the scene was also delayed for some time due to complaints about filming it in public, and it took time to hire a body double: it is implausible that Heady discovered she had

      that her body double is actually wearing a pubic wig to cover her genitals - the TV show has done this several times before, i.e. with Melisandre. In the same issue Headey was again vague and only said "I obviously chose not to be naked for several reasons."

      in April 2016, just prior to the Season 6 premiere. Headey confirmed that she chose to use a body double simply because when production came up to this point, she felt she would be so distracted by being naked that she would not be able to give the same emotional response that Cersei-the-character is supposed to have in the scene. She also cited that she has done nude scenes before and the simple fact that it was a nude scene had nothing to do with her choice. As she explained, the script calls for Cersei to be absolutely stoic and unemotional during the whole ordeal, only starting to cry just as it ends and she enters the castle. Headey didn't think she could keep her face this unemotional if she was actually naked in front of a large crowd - not that she would break down crying, but rather, Headey felt she couldn't restrain her

    Several professional reviews criticized the logistics of the scene - not Headey's choice to use a body double in the first place (which Benioff and Weiss had no control over), but that the CGI used to match Headey's head to the double's naked body was too noticeable (though given that it was Headey's choice, there was only so much the production team could do to work around it). Also,
    <i key="4036f5b3-4511-4a93-84e7-df2369722f0a">

    </i>
    criticized that a major point from the novels was lost by casting a 27 year old body double, given that both Cersei the character and Lena Headey are over 40 years old. In the novels, the naked walk is even more humiliating, because while Cersei was famously beautiful as a teenager, two decades of time and three pregnancies have taken their toll, and her naked body is viewed negatively and as less attractive. Cersei used to wield her beauty like a weapon to intimidate others, but when the crowd sees the effect multiple pregnancies and time have had on her body, she loses a large part of her mystique. As a result, they no longer fear her and then openly mock her.
    It is possible that there weren't many actresses willing to be a nude body double who both had a body that fit the book's description of Cersei's during the naked walk and who also closely matched Headey's general body proportions. In which case, the production team picked from actresses willing to be a nude body double for this scene.

   Stannis leaves the Wall about a third of the way into the fifth novel, what would be about two thirds in a normally structured novel (as the fifth one follows only half the characters, it contains what would be two novels' worth of storyline for each subplot).

On top of this, much of the last two episodes of Stannis's storyline isn't even from the fifth novel - the TV producers jumped ahead, to condense in additional material from the unpublished sixth novel, such as the burning of Shireen and Stannis's fight against the Boltons and eventual defeat.

   In the novels, therefore, Stannis's march against Winterfell is quite different. Rather than losing men, he has gained thousands of new Northern allies, and their advance is a serious threat to the Boltons. The odds are still against them, but even Roose Bolton is deeply concerned that Stannis's assault might so badly weaken his armies that the rest of the North will rise up in revolt to overthrow the Boltons. The fifth novel ends on a cliffhanger, as the battle occurred off-screen and the outcome is unknown. The Boltons seem to have at least taken significant losses, but Jon Snow receives
   a letter from Ramsay Bolton
   claiming that he has killed Stannis and demanding that he hand over Melisandre, Stannis's wife and daughter (who remained at Castle Black); there are, however, reasons to believe the contents of the letter are false, among them that no piece of skin is enclosed - in contrast to Ramsay's former letters.

On the other hand, the Boltons are in a very inconvenient position: although they have a better shelter and more food supplies that Stannis, Roose has been forced to send the Freys - his only reliable allies - from Winterfell, leaving the Boltons with many Northern guests who deeply loathe them and may rise against them at any moment; Roose has also sent the White Harbor troops, unaware that he has given Lord Manderly an opportunity to join forces with Stannis.

  <p key="8d328976-8f6b-4abe-afbc-44d8c07bdfc9">
   In contrast, in the TV version's heavily condensed version of events, which used up not only all of the fifth novel's material but also some of the sixth novel's (all in a single TV season), Stannis's march against Winterfell comes to an abrupt end after many of his men flee before and during the battle, in which his remaining forces are promptly defeated off-screen.

   In the novels, the Battle of Winterfell was the major battle serving as the climax of the fifth book. In the TV series, the

   ") was instead treated as the major battle sequence climax of Season 5. In the novels, it only appeared off-screen because Jon Snow did not personally go there and his preparations to go on a rescue mission to Hardhome alongside Tormund are interrupted by the arrival of the pink letter. Line producer Snorri Þórisson confirmed in July 2014 that the Hardhome sequence was significantly expanded in rewrites which occurred late in the production schedule of Season 5. The original plan was to film at least something of events at Hardhome in Iceland in November 2014 (because Iceland was used for scenes

   before). However, the window for filming in Iceland's winter months is very narrow - when the Hardhome battle sequence was expanded to the point that it took a full 15 days to film, production had to be moved back to Northern Ireland. Thus it is unclear if the

   The Stannis/Bolton storyline also intersects with the Night's Watch storyline, and these condensations affect it in the finale as well. At the end of the fifth novel, Jon receives a threatening letter from Ramsay Bolton. He reads the letter aloud to the Night's Watch and assembled wildlings and announces he will march south and confront Ramsay, effectively compromising the political neutrality of the Night's Watch. It is after

   correct: if Jon strictly adheres to the Watch's political neutrality, the Boltons will destroy the North and the Watch. However, attacking the Boltons breaks the Watch's political neutrality to stay out of the realm's wars and if they fail, it might invoke the wrath of the Lannisters against the Watch. The TV version, in contrast, presents Jon's attackers as only motivated by an unwillingness to let go of their old grudge against the wildlings. In the novels, the mutiny against Jon results from the build-up of tensions with a faction of the Watch due to Jon's efforts to ally with and save the wildlings, lack of resources to feed everyone being sheltered at the Wall, and fears that Jon is politically aligning himself with Stannis. In particular, Bowen Marsh is afraid they will face the wrath of the Iron Throne in response.

  <p key="21d2fda4-4bdf-4ab6-9082-03af0dd13824">
   In the TV series, the reason Thorne and the other mutineers stab Jon for saving the wildlings, after Thorne let Jon and the wildling refugees through the Wall, is unclear. If Thorne and the others wanted to betray Jon because he was saving the wildlings, they could have just refused to let them back through the Wall in the immediately preceding episode. It is possible that Melisandre's news about Stannis's death and the Bolton's victory influenced their decision, but if so, it was not mentioned, in order to increase the shock of their betrayal. Further, Melisandre never abandons Stannis to flee back to Castle Black, but remains at the Wall with Stannis's family and some of his soldiers, explaining that it is one of the "hinges of the world" and her magical abilities are much more powerful there.

   . Olly is a character invented for the TV show (loosely Olly is a condensation of aspects of several other characters). Alliser Thorne is not at Castle Black when the mutiny occurs, because he is sent earlier by Jon on a scouting mission beyond the Wall. Thorne, who dislikes Jon much more in the novels, outright accuses Jon of wanting him to refuse his assignment as Janos Slynt did to provide an excuse for Jon to execute him. He obeys Jon's command, but does not leave quietly: he warns Jon that he'll return to settle the score, alive or as a wight. In the novels, the remaining older and high ranking officers at Castle Black grow increasingly frustrated with Jon's resettling of the wildlings south of the Wall, and even repairing several abandoned forts along the Wall and restaffing them with wildling garrisons. The first to stab Jon is Wick Whittlestick, next is the First Steward
   Bowen Marsh
   , followed by at least two others, but the chapter is told from Jon’s perspective, and as he is losing consciousness he doesn't take note of who they are. The TV series had

As it turned out, neither Yarwyck nor Marsh were given significantly more scenes in Season 5, and instead,

  <p key="bb51d489-70f2-4819-99ce-6af6ab52f71e">
   It remains to be seen how the TV show will explain the apparent logical discrepancy: why would Thorne let Jon and the wildlings through the Wall, only to then stab Jon for commanding him to do so - when Thorne could have just refused to let Jon and the wildlings through the Wall in the first place, as the wildlings already through the Wall outnumber the Castle Black garrison a hundred to one. Muddying the question is that it is unclear in the TV version at what point Thorne decided to betray Jon and what the actual tipping point was that made the mutiny happen specifically when it did - whether Thorne even intended to betray Jon when he let the wildlings through the Wall, or if Thorne did want to betray Jon then but feared being seen as a traitor by the other Watch members atop the Wall if he kept the gate closed, etc. But while these choices appear unclear at this point, if it is clarified in Season 6 that, for example, Thorne decided to turn on Jon only

    - Arya goes blind at the end of the fourth novel, but is still alive. Arya's storyline was one of the ones focused on in the fourth novel, which then took time off to deal with the other storylines in the fifth novel - but the end of the fifth novel then devotes a few chapters at the end to check back in on how the storylines from the end of the fifth novel were doing. Arya has two more chapters in the fifth novel which have not yet been adapted. Arya also doesn't kill Raff (Meryn Trant in the TV series) in the fifth novel, but in a chapter from the sixth novel which Martin officially released on his website (it had been completed long ago, and he apparently wanted viewers to know what Arya's climactic scene this season was based on).

    . In the novels, Robb left Brynden in charge of defending Riverrun so Brynden was not present for the massacre at the Red Wedding. Instead, he continues to command the besieged Tully garrison at Riverrun, still fighting in the name of King Robb even though, at this point, the garrison has no realistic hope for long-term survival, much less victory. The TV show had him come to the wedding (apparently as a condensation or to lull suspicions of the impending massacre), but it still has Brynden escape. In the TV series, Brynden happened to step out of the castle to relieve himself just as the massacre started, avoiding the slaughter in the main hall, and thus managed to simply fight his way out of the assault on the camps outside. It is implied that Brynden may have fled back to Riverrun, but ultimately the TV version did not reveal what happened to him.
