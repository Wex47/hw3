   Like most of the Free Cities, Tyrosh was founded as a colony of the
   Valyrian Freehold
   . Established as a military fort to monitor and control shipping activity in the
   Stepstones
   , the city's real fame arose from a completely unexpected source; the waters surrounding Tyrosh were home to an unusual type of sea snail that produced richly colored dyes when properly treated. Colorful garments soon became immensely popular with Valyrian nobility, and thousands of merchants flocked to Tyrosh to take advantage of the commercial opportunities. The fort grew into a proper city within a single generation, and over the centuries Tyroshi dyers were able to develop a huge variety of different colors through various processes. In the present day, the Tyroshi still have a love for loud and garish colors, often dyeing not only their clothes but their hair in bright, gaudy hues (in the novels,
   <a href="Daario Naharis.html" key="acf9d7fc-e76e-473b-97c0-d97fbf9a0a22" title="Daario Naharis">
    Daario Naharis

   ' hair and beard are dyed bright blue, and his mustache is dyed gold, but the TV series decided not to include this since they felt it would distract from the performance).
  </p>
  <p key="7020e4a3-4685-4eb5-831e-31878968b50b">
   Tyrosh is also known for its creation of ornate armor and elaborate torture devices. The armorsmiths of the city produce intricate helms shaped like animals and birds and often decorated with precious metals. Pear brandy is the signature drink of the city as well as a popular export, and a pastry known as "honeyfingers" is popular among the citizens (Daario Naharis even remarks that when he was growing up, he and his mother were so poor that getting enough food was a problem- occassionaly they had to manage with just a sausage and a honeyfinger, and he even asks Daenerys if there are honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms).
  </p>
  <p key="e67fc37d-848a-4c91-a8d7-6e0d3d943a2b">
   Tyrosh is actively involved in the
   slave trade
   , with slaves outnumbering freeborn citizens three to one. The Tyroshi are famously aggressive in their search for slaves, even sailing to lands beyond the
   <a href="Wall.html" key="1dccc4fb-36e0-4df1-8420-511c1cae19d6" title="Wall">

   for the slave market.

  <p key="796290a5-ff07-4290-96cf-0b61b49c8d67">
   The leader of Tyrosh is the Archon, chosen from among a council made up of the city's wealthiest and most prominent citizens. A number of different religions have a presence in Tyrosh; a monument known as the Fountain of the Drunken God is dedicated to the eponymous deity, and the Temple of Trios honors the three-headed god of the same name. The faith of
   R'hllor, the Lord of Light
   , also has followers in Tyrosh (as in many of the other Free Cities).
