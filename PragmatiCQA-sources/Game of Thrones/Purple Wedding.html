   champion dwarf

   , which he proclaims to have seen firsthand. Tyrion finishes by cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is clearly mad with lust and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night, which draws a few stifled yet audible chuckles from the crowd. Enraged and humiliated that Tyrion outwitted him, Joffrey stalks over and empties his wine goblet onto his uncle's head, oblivious that his actions are observed with increasing and obvious disgust by his bride, the guests, and even his mother and

Tyrion fills it but silently refuses to kneel to Joffrey, prompting Joffrey to repeat the demand in increasing, petulant rage. Margaery distracts him by indicating the arrival of the traditional
   pigeon pie

   Tyrion obliges and hands Joffrey his cup. Unbeknownst to everyone, w​hile they were distracted by the pigeons coming out of the pie, Olenna slipped the poison into Joffrey's cup. After Joffrey takes a gulp, he starts coughing, and so he takes another gulp of wine to quell the cough. His coughing becomes more violent and it quickly becomes so severe that his throat closes and he cannot breathe; Margaery notices and shouts that he is choking. Lurching forward, Joffrey falls to the ground, desperately gasping for breath and convulsing so violently that it causes him to vomit. Panic erupts amongst the guests, and Lady Olenna shouts for the Kingsguard to help their King.

   and Cersei rush to his side to aid him, but he continues to gag, as blood runs out of his nose and his face turns grotesquely purple. With his last strength, the King attempts to point accusingly to his uncle, seemingly believing him to be the culprit. Tyrion, meanwhile, has picked up the wine goblet, inspecting it for poison. The scleras (whites) of Joffrey's eyes turn red and begin to bleed and wheezing out his last breath, he dies.

   While later speaking with Margaery about Tyrion, Olenna states that he is innocent, and implies that it was her who poisoned Joffrey in order to protect Margaery from the mental and physical abuse that Joffrey had quite clearly inflicted on Sansa whilst she was his betrothed. Olenna's decision to kill Joffrey stemmed from her previous conversation with Sansa, in which she described Joffrey as a "beast". Baelish later revealed to Sansa that he had bigger plans for the Seven Kingdoms, but betrayed the Lannisters and sided with the Tyrells since he did not trust Joffrey.

   novels, the assassination of Joffrey at his wedding receives no name, unlike the Red Wedding, and is simply referred to as "Joffrey's wedding". The term "Purple Wedding" is a fan-term referring to the wine used to assassinate Joffrey and the fact that purple is a color associated with royalty; and, of course, to draw a parallel with the infamous

   and the HBO production team have been known to use it.
   As Martin explained in an interview with
   <i key="c0efe9db-52a3-4e8c-bdb8-54c47be151a0">
    TV Guide
   </i>
   , "It's what the fans call the Purple Wedding, based on the color of the wine, which plays a big part."
  </p>
  <p key="fdf50e57-89fa-40d5-87c3-db788ada5a95">
   According to Martin, the conspirators want Joffrey to appear to die accidentally by choking, rather than a public assassination like the Red Wedding;
   Cersei, however, does not fall for that. Her paranoid mind, which so often makes her see imaginary enemies and schemes, correctly makes her realize Joffrey has been murdered, and later she also figures the Tyrells are to blame (but she incorrectly blames Tyrion too).

   One of the differences between the show and the books is that Sansa is given a hair net, not a necklace. After getting away from the wedding hall, she examines the hair net, and is shocked to see that one gem is missing. She immediately understands the significance, and why Dontos instructed her to wear the hair net.
  </p>
  <p key="f8a670c9-f354-4e64-a75f-1885a79d5734">
   Another difference is that during the commotion, Tyrion examines the chalice, which still contains a bit of the wine. For unknown reason, Tyrion spills its contents, as if attempting to dispose of incriminating evidence. Some of the witnesses in
   his trial
   mention that. As things turn to be, the act of spilling the wine does not worsen Tyrion's position, because the trial is just a farce.

   </a>
   told her that her hair net was crooked and straightened it; only then Sansa realizes how the poisoning was performed. Littlefinger reveals a part of the scheme: it has started when he came to Highgarden in order to form an alliance between the Tyrells and Lannisters. He realized the Tyrells wished to marry Margaery to
   <i key="cd7fa6c1-89ce-41bb-8001-299d9bb16531">
    a king
   </i>
   - not necessarily Joffrey. Olenna questioned Littlefinger about Joffrey's nature; he was too subtle to tell the truth, so he praised him to the skies, whilst his men spread disturbing tales amongst the Tyrells' servants. Olenna, of course, wouldn't have let Joffrey harm her precious granddaughter. Littlefinger predicts that soon Tommen will marry Margaery, and the great western alliance will be preserved (for a time, at least).
  </p>
  <p key="690340e2-a1ed-4aa9-a9e5-c2257b4d222d">
   Large part of the scheme, however, remains unrevealed by the point the books reached. It is unclear, for instance, how far Margaery was involved; whether Olenna put the poison in the goblet herself, or handed it to another accomplice; who else was involved; etc. There are various fan speculations about the scheme, among them that
   Garlan Tyrell
   was the one who put the poison in the wine: he was sitting near it, and he is the only other Tyrell who could be trusted (

   disagrees, pointing out that many of the guests and servants were moving about; when Joffrey and Margaery cut the wedding pie, every eye was on them, and no one watched the wine chalice; anyone who was on the dais (among them the king's family, the bride's family,

Loras thinks it was Sansa, claiming that she was only person in the hall who had reason to want Margaery and Joffrey dead; why did she run afterward, unless she was guilty? Jaime figures Tyrion may be innocent after all, but has no way to find out the truth since Sansa escaped. He decides to leave the murder mystery unsolved, and make sure no harm happens to Tommen too.

Oberyn's words imply that there have been two parallel, independent plots to murder Joffrey by poisoning. It is unknown how Oberyn sought to kill Joffrey (perhaps the scorpion-shaped brooch, which he gave Joffrey at the breakfast prior to the wedding, was coated with poison); whatever his plan was, the Tyrells have beaten him to it.

   In the fourth novel, Cersei becomes annoyed as a result of Margaery's growing influence over Tommen. Suddenly she realizes the Tyrells had a strong motive to kill Joffrey: he was too stubborn to be influenced, in sharp contrast to his sweet gentle brother, so the Tyrells disposed of him in order to make Tommen a puppet king, whom Margaery could easily control. While that conclusion is partly-correct, Cersei concludes wrongly that Tyrion was the co-conspirator; that the Tyrells helped him escape from prison by bribing the gaolers (that explains, in Cersei's mind, the Tyrell coin which Qyburn found in one of the gaolers' cell); and maybe they conspired to
