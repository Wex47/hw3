If a prequel series is made, there is a good chance it would want to depict the War of the Ninepenny Kings and "rise of Tywin"/Reyne Rebellion storyarcs - even though they climaxed during the reign of Jaehaerys II, who doesn't exist in the TV continuity. However, if they did appear they would chronologically occur so many seasons into a prequel TV series that the narrative would probably just continue after Aegon V died to wrap up loose plot threads, extending directly into Aerys II's reign.
