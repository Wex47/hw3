   Since the outbreak of the
   War of the Five Kings
   , the problems in King's Landing have multiplied, particularly the worsening food shortages. The
   Crownlands
   do not produce enough food to feed the large population of King's Landing, so food is mostly imported from the

   to be taken back to the Red Keep by an alternate route. After being subjected to the japes and jests of the crowd, including shouts of "bastard!", "monster of incest!", "Stannis!", and a sarcastic "Hail King Joffrey!" someone throws a cow pie at Joffrey's head.

  <p key="94a0defa-6739-4648-b67d-00e842588c1f">
   Enraged at the excrement thrown in his face, Joffrey demands that his guards seize whoever threw it. With mounting tension between his guards and the commoners nearby, Joffrey becomes livid, and screams: "Just kill them! Kill them all!"
  </p>
  <p key="af50b5c7-9872-4573-a9e4-a5b7fe95dc8b">
   However, Joffrey discovers that his orders count for little when his guards are heavily outnumbered by an angry mob, rather than in the safety of the Red Keep with its large garrison. His few dozen guards, despite their weapons and armor, are outnumbered a hundred to one and chaos quickly ensues. Individual Lannister and City Watch men are swarmed by vicious rioters whilst the
   High Septon
   is dragged down screaming by the crowd and literally torn to pieces. Tyrion is visibly horrified when he sees this and realizes that in the commotion,

Joffrey, still hysterically demanding that all the rioters be executed, is slapped and scolded by Tyrion for inciting the starving crowd and absurdly overreacting to having cow dung thrown at him, describing him as a "vicious idiot". Tyrion continues the search for Sansa's whereabouts, but Joffrey petulantly refuses to order his Kingsguard to rescue her (

   Much of the city remains in chaos for some time, with random violence and looting spreading across the capital. The pent up frustrations with Lannister rule and the starvation conditions in the city, which Cersei had flippantly ignored for months, now came back to haunt Joffrey's court. So far, along with the

   , this has been one of two occasions during his reign in which Joffrey was very nearly deposed and killed. It also served to show how little loyalty he really had among the people.

When she is brought back, she has a deep bleeding gash on her scalp, and says, "They... they were throwing things... rocks and filth, eggs... I tried to tell them, I had no bread to give them. A man tried to pull me from the saddle. The Hound killed him, I think. His arm... he cut off his arm."

   In the fourth novel, someone asks Jaime if Tyrek has been found. Jaime wonders about the incident: As he was told, Varys was not present to see Myrcella off to Dorne, thereby avoiding the riot. He had
   agents and informers
   all over the city so probably knew the riot was about to happen, but did not forewarn Cersei; did he incite the riot and kidnap Tyrek? Since the youth served as Robert's squire alongside Lancel, he might have had knowledge about the circumstances surrounding
   the king's death
   ; such knowledge is highly valuable, a fact which Varys knew well. It is unknown whether Jaime's suspicion is correct, and what has become of Tyrek.
