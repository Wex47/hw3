   migration, and it was also politically independent for many generations. It is also geographically very isolated, located in the extreme south of the continent and separate from the rest of it by mountains and harsh deserts. After the

Dorne was the only region to successfully resist invasion by the Targaryens, using guerrilla warfare, and only united with the realm one century ago through peaceful marriage-alliance.

   While the Common Tongue is geographically quite uniform, the biggest internal distinction is between the upper and lower classes. Noble-borns, as well as other upper class people such as wealthy merchants, tend to speak a more refined and "proper" form of the language, because they can afford a better education.

   The Common Tongue is virtually the only language spoken throughout the entire continent of Westeros. It is stated that about half of the wildlings can only speak the Old Tongue, generally those that live farther away from the Wall or isolated in the mountains. As for the other half of the wildlings, it isn't clear what proportion are bilingual, or perhaps only know the Common Tongue. For that matter, it isn't clear for what proportion the Common Tongue is their primary or secondary language. Nonetheless, the

   Martin has made no such comments about the "Common Tongue" in his fantasy world, and while Tolkien's Middle-earth was intended to indeed be our world in a lost prehistoric age, Martin has stated that the fantasy world of

   is truly an alternate world with no connection to our own. Thus it would seem that the English used in it doesn't "represent" the "real Common Tongue" through universal translation for the sake of the reader (and TV viewer). The Common Tongue just happens to be exactly like English - though confusingly, this also means that at times it uses English

   George R.R. Martin has admitted that logically, the different constituent kingdoms of Westeros probably have their own distinctive accents, but given that he is not a trained linguist or philologist, he has made little or no attempt to represent this in his writing.

   , which will make hiding his identity difficult - thus acknowledging that there is such a thing as a "westerlands accent" relative to a "riverlands accent" or "Vale accent". Apparently this is comparable to the slight difference between New York and Los Angeles accent relative to heavily Spanish-accented English (or London and Bristol accents, compared to something radically different like a Scottich Gaelic accent).

   Apart from the Northern English/"First Men accent" used for the Northerners and wildlings in the TV series, the only other major ethno-linguistic group to have arrived in Westeros are the
   Rhoynar
   , ancestors of the modern
   Dornish
   . The Rhoynar originally had their own language but gradually abandoned it to take up the language of their Andal neighbors - much as the independent First Men in the North gradually adopted the Andal language as well. Dorne was also politically independent far longer than the North ever was: the Targaryens conquered six of the seven kingdoms in the

   </a>
   three hundred years ago, but Dorne successfully repelled their invasions using guerrilla warfare, and was only brought under the control of the Iron Throne one century ago through peaceful marriage alliance. Probably due to this drastically different ethnic and historical background, the novels state that there is a distinctive Dornish accent, more distinct than any other regional accents (people who don't consider Ned Stark's Northern accent different enough from "standard" Common Tongue to comment on it

    World of Ice and Fire
   </i>
   sourcebook (2014) specifically mentioned that the accent is due to their speech being influenced by the original language of the Rhoynar - not merely due to their geographical and political isolation in Westeros, though this isolation helped keep the Rhoynish/Dornish accent distinct over the centuries. There are no clear examples of what it is supposed to sound like, but the text consistently describes it as a "Dornish drawl".

   At first it was somewhat curious that the original Rhoynar language didn't survive in Dorne: the Old Tongue of the First Men was displaced because the Andals conquered them, but the Rhoynar conquered Dorne (by unifying with the local power of House Martell), and indeed the Dornish were never conquered by any outside force. Even when the Andal conquered the First Men, it may have taken many centuries for the Old Tongue to completely die out in southern Westeros, but that conquest occurred 6,000 years ago - compared to the only 1,000 years ago that the Rhoynar migrated to Dorne. Yet the
   <i key="93838cdd-d862-4e17-858e-d2657e6c6717">
    World of Ice and Fire
   </i>
   also provided a direct answer to this: when the Rhoynar first migrated to Westeros they were fleeing the Valyrians who had conquered their homeland, and their warrior-queen
   Nymeria
   wanted to convince the faint of heart among her people that there was no going back (their wanderings as a refugee fleet were so desperate that some actually did try to return, only to be captured by the Valyrians). Nymeria's most famous and direct action to prevent any of her people trying to flee back was to burn all of her ships after they landed at Dorne. Nymeria didn't even want her people longing for their old lives in their old homes, however, but to focus on building a future in Dorne, so she encouraged the Rhoynar to actively switch to using the Common Tongue used in Westeros (similarly, the Rhoynar converted
   <i key="2a31b3e9-cd6e-4223-bc70-509a7b2643fe">
    en masse
   </i>
   to the Faith of the Seven, abandoning their original worship of the river-goddess of the Rhoyne). Nymeria married Mors Martell and her descendants in House Martell ruled over all of Dorne: it is said that the three successors of Nymeria's grandson outright

   speaking the original Rhoynar language at all. This is specifically why the original Rhoynar language died out in Dorne in only a century or two, despite the Rhoynar in Dorne never being conquered by any outside force. The original Rhoynar language, however, still ended up influencing how Dornishmen speak Common Tongue with a notable accent.

   have been happy to develop a "Dornish drawl" accent, but the TV producers never asked him to. Thus any accents used by Dornish characters are inventions of the actors and/or directors, not rationally thought out the way the Dothraki accents were.

   As the first major Dornish character cast for the TV series, the accent that actor
   Pedro Pascal
   came up with for Oberyn Martell loosely set the standard for other actors playing Dornish characters to follow. Pascal himself noted that the book chapters described the Dornish as speaking with a distinct accent, and that the Dornish should logically speak differently because they are isolated from the rest of Westeros (far to the south, separated by mountains and deserts):

  <p key="ff03f9ae-95fa-45ef-b66b-b5c90ca1bcee">
   There were some fears before Season 4 aired that the Dornish accent used in the TV series would just be a loosely made-up stereotype of a "Hispanic accent", given that Dorne is heavily inspired by medieval Spain. Pascal, however, explained that he actually based Oberyn's Dornish accent on his own father's real-life Chilean-Spanish accent:

This is in part because there are not simply local "accents" of German, but regional "dialects": not as subtle as the difference between northern England (seen as a bit more rough and working-class) and southern England (considered refined, "standard" English). "High German" is the standardized version for governmental and public use, so it doesn't quite have regional "accents".

Daenerys, however, switches between all three languages frequently: in Season 1, this meant that the audio would switch from the German dub actress (Gabrielle Pietermann) speaking in "Common", to Emilia Clarke's original audio speaking in Dothraki.

The upper-class/lower-class divide is easier to show and present in the Portuguese dub: as with other dubs, the upper-class characters speak more formally (sometimes arrogantly like Tywin), while working-class commoners speak more loosely, with more slang and grammar errors, etc. Most characters from beyond Westeros who have an accent in the English version don't have one in the Portuguese dub (Shae, Jaqen, etc.), though Syrio Forel again speaks with a Greek accent (Greek-accented Portuguese).
