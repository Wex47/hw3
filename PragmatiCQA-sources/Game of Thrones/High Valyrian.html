   As for Low Valyrian, Tyrion could speak some Braavosi reasonably well, knew a smattering of Myrish, and a few phrases of Tyroshi. Tyrion apparently could not speak Pentoshi. Tyrion himself says that Low Valyrian is "not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues". However, the fact that Tyrion knows High Valyrian and some dialects like Braavosi, but cannot understand others, lends a large amount of evidence to the position that they have reached the point where they are not mutually intelligible and are truly separate languages.

   In contrast, the Low Valyrian of Slaver's Bay, which is influenced by the old Ghiscari language, is more uniform. It is stated that while the Low Valyrian of Yunkai is a different dialect than that of Astapor, they are still mutually intelligible. However, a great multitude of other languages are spoken in large numbers in Slaver's Bay, due to the large influx of slaves from many distant lands.

    A Storm of Swords
   </i>
   - Daenerys II) confusing descriptions are given about what variant of Valyrian is spoken in Slaver's Bay:
  </p>
  <ul key="be1a082c-c86b-46a6-b77b-e4af26e4a718">
   <li key="7d7b2c5e-edd6-482c-b03a-4adb5ab1d3d2">
    "Even the Ghiscari tongue was largely forgotten; the slave cities spoke the High Valyrian of their conquerors, or what they had made of it."
   </li>
   <li key="754f7025-c5c2-4dcd-9d4b-3f9428cd60c9">
    "Kraznys' High Valyrian was twisted and thickened by the characteristic growl of Ghis, and flavored here and there with words of slaver argot."
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="b7ac0625-443d-4fec-95f4-61490bc1d51b">
   It isn't clear from this if Kraznys is speaking in "High Valyrian" or if he is speaking in Ghiscari Low Valyrian - the Romance version of the language which developed in Slaver's Bay, twisting the language much as French twisted Latin.

   When asked, David J. Peterson explained that even in the books, Kraznys is speaking Ghiscari Low Valyrian. This chapter was narrated from Daenerys's POV and she is simply commenting on how much they have "twisted" High Valyrian - to the point that it is the different language of Low Valyrian.

   In the TV series, Peterson explained that in Season 3 Daenerys always speaks in High Valyrian, not Low Valyrian - albeit she quickly picks up several specific terms from Ghiscari Low Valyrian. Specifically when she says "a dragon is not a slave" (

    Zaldrīzes buzdari iksos daor
   </i>
   ), the word "buzdari" is actually Ghiscari Low Valyrian for "slave". The High Valyrian word for slave is "dohaeriros", but Daenerys used the common word for "slave" in Low Valyrian to emphasize to Kraznys that she could understand what he was saying in Low Valyrian.
   Given that Kraznys understands her response, he apparently knows High Valyrian as well, but prefers speaking in his mother-tongue. Melisandre and Thoros explicitly state that they are speaking in High Valyrian during their exchanges in "The Climb".
