   derisively says he doesn't believe the pyromancers' claims about wildfire, as there are always charlatans on the side of battlefields selling "pig shit" to soldiers and claiming it has magical properties. Hallyne insists that the abilities of wildfire are indeed very potent. Bronn then points out that even if this is true, wildfire is too unstable to be used safely in catapults by inexperienced troops: the moment one of the catapult teams drops a single jar, it could burn the whole city to the ground by accident. Hallyne then opens the guild's vault to reveal to an awed Tyrion that they have amassed over 7,800 jars of wildfire, enough "to lay King's Landing low". Tyrion agrees and commands Hallyne to begin producing wildfire for his purposes instead of Cersei's.

He realizes the ship is unmanned so he halts his archers, but then sees the ship is emptying wildfire into the bay from pipes at its rear. Tyrion had all eight thousand jars of wildfire loaded into the ship. At Tyrion's command, Bronn fires a burning arrow into the wildfire, which detonates the ship in a massive explosion that pulverizes Stannis's ships closest to the blast. The spreading fire engulfs most of the remaining fleet. Hundreds, if not thousands, of sailors and soldiers under Stannis's command are burned alive. Stannis continues his attack on King's Landing but with the losses from the explosion, he loses the battle and is forced to retreat to

   Wildfire is similar to real-life
   napalm
   or
   Greek fire
   , both highly combustible liquids used in combat. Greek fire was famously believed to be used by the Byzantine Empire throughout its history (roughly the 4th to the 15th Centuries CE), and so may have been a technology known to medieval peoples.
