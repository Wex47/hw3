The Tyrell army will surround the Great Sept, intimidating the Sparrows into releasing Margaery and Loras, without any blood actually being shed - and by the time Tommen finds out what they've done he will already be happy with the outcome. Kevan's interest is now turned, but he still expresses reluctance should they fail. Cersei is able to make him change his mind by exploiting his hatred towards the Sparrows for taking his last remaining son and heir

   . When Missandei defends Daenerys's actions in liberating slaves, Razdal contends that slavery has existed for centuries. Tyrion brings up that they do not require slaves in order to profit, noting that he matured with vast wealth to his name back in Westeros, where no slavery is sanctioned. Razdal and Belicho look at each other, insulted, while Yezzan merely looks away from Tyrion. He appears to be contemplating the dwarf's words. After hearing their offer, Tyrion proposes a counter-offer. He offers to give them a seven-year grace period to phase out slavery and to compensate slave owners, however they must end all backing for the

   Tyrion and his entourage are later confronted by a crowd of former slaves in the Meereen throne room. A

   demands to know when Daenerys will return while
   another
   is appalled at the idea of Tyrion negotiating with slave traders. Tyrion insists he is doing his best to rule the city in Daenerys's absence. The freedmen do not trust Tyrion, a foreigner and a newcomer, and look to Grey Worm and Missandei for reassurance. Despite their misgivings, they both publicly back Tyrion's diplomacy in front of the freedmen. In private, Grey Worm and Missandei warn Tyrion that the masters will outmaneuver him, despite his best efforts to do the same to them.

She calmly reaches over and clamps her hand on the basket of a burning brazier; yet she doesn't flinch. The khals expressions turn to amazement and fear as they realise too late just whom they are dealing with. In a flat tone, Daenerys informs them they aren't going to serve; they're going to die. With these words she topples the brazier, setting the floor of the hut alight in seconds. The khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly spreading fire, only to find the temple's single door barred, the bodies of the two men guarding it lying dead outside. Khal Moro is the only one left as he turns to face Daenerys, who pushes the last brazier over in his direction. Khal Moro is engulfed by flames and his screams don't last long.

    , Jon appears in the scene but is seen standing behind Ned and Robb and is placed beside Theon Greyjoy, as they shared a similar social position as an illegitimate son and a ward respectively. Additionally, as Cersei Lannister remarks in the fourth novel, she noticed the Starks doing their best to hide Jon during her visit with King Robert Baratheon to Winterfell, which could be an effort by Ned to protect Jon by hiding him from Robert and the Lannisters. In the novels, Jon and Sansa didn't have any on-page scenes together at Winterfell in the first novel - Jon was always closer to Arya, who was also a social outsider of a sort.

      Though Sansa and Jon don't have a particularly close relationship in the books, they think of each other several times throughout the series after their family's separation. Some examples include Jon recalling how Sansa had taught him how to talk to girls and, while regarding the beauty of a winter morning, fondly thinks that Sansa would call it an "

      Sansa and Jon have not reunited as of the end of the most recent novel. Jon's storyline in the TV series surpassed the novels when he was stabbed to death, while Sansa's has loosely surpassed the novels but also been heavily condensed: in the novels she stays in the Vale and never even meets the Boltons. It is entirely possible that she will meet Jon again in an upcoming novel and their reactions will be very much

      Sansa's view in this episode that she was "an ass" to Jon may be somewhat of an exaggeration in comparison to her behavior toward him in the novels. While Sansa looked up to and shared many similarities with her mother (who completely ignored Jon, but didn't mistreat him according to the standards of Westeros), and she and Jon have the most distant relationship of the Stark children, they think of each other fondly in the novels, following their family being separated into different directions. Growing up, Jon and Sansa's paths did not cross much since Sansa was very aware of social standings, enjoyed feminine persuits, was tutored by Septa Mordane, and spent time with her mother while Jon spent most of his time with their father, brothers, being tutored by Maester Luwin, and shared interests with Robb and Arya, with whom he was very close. As a result, while Sansa and Jon shared each other's company during family activities in the novels (such as Arya's memory of Robb and Jon playing a prank on their younger siblings in the crypts), Jon had less interaction with Sansa than he did with Robb, Arya, and Bran.
     </li>
     <li key="1f811626-06fd-4e2e-92f0-ef79eceb0837">
      Jon and Arya mentally note that Sansa was always careful to refer to Jon as "half-brother", even since she was old enough to understand what "bastard" meant - perhaps under the influence of Catelyn - but she never mistreated or mocked Jon. In the second novel, Jon remembers how Sansa took time aside to help teach him how to properly court girls when he asked her to, so Sansa's relationship with Jon was evidently better than Catelyn's relationship with him was.

      The reunion between Sansa and Jon is the first time any of the separated Stark siblings have reunited since splitting up in Season 1 (except for Bran and Rickon, who separated at the end of Season 3). There were several chances of reunion - Arya arrived at the Twins right after the Red Wedding started, Arya's arrival at the Vale, Jon attacking the mutineers while Bran was nearby, Arya trying to sail North to Castle Black - but in every case, the reunion was prevented for various reason, to the point where the Stark children almost reuniting but just barely missing each other has become a running joke in the fandom.

    As of the end of the fifth novel, both Jon and Sansa are led to believe the other three remaining Stark siblings - Arya, Bran, and Rickon - are probably dead. In the TV version, Brienne actually encountered Arya briefly and informed Sansa she was alive two episodes ago - information they can now share with Jon.

    as he was passing through the Wall (as he did in the novels) and made him swear not to tell anyone in the Season 3 finale. Unlike in the novels, however, Sam tells Jon anyway, as seen in Season 4. Thus, if Jon and Sansa presumably shared information off-screen, they now know that there is at least some chance that all three of the other Stark siblings, who were believed dead, might still be alive.

      In contrast to Jon and Sansa, Ramsay "preferred being an only child," and to achieve this, he murdered his father, his stepmother and his infant half-brother. This made Ramsay the last living member of House Bolton - and the only people who fight for him are those he can intimidate into serving him.

In the subsequent Season 5 Blu-ray set, the "

    The Fighting Pits of Meereen

    Dave Hill
    writes the "Histories and Lore" featurettes - Hill understands the relative value of the Gold Honor given in the novels, but apparently never corrected Benioff and Weiss about this.

He also summarizes his encounter with her from that episode: he outright offered her a fleet of ships to transport her army to Westeros and just leave Yunkai's slave-masters to their own devices, which he felt was a generous and mutually beneficial offer, but she refused and insisted on staying to topple the slave-masters. His return now is not an invention of the TV series due to economy of characters: after meeting with Daenerys in the third novel (much as he did in Season 3), he later returned in the fifth novel, in which he was one of the lead politicians arranging the Yunkai/Astapor/Volantis slaver-alliance now opposing Daenerys's rule over Meereen.

    . Exactly which of the three major cities of Slaver's Bay TV-Yezzan is supposed to be from is therefore unclear.

    . This specific design was previously used on-screen at Astapor in Season 3. In the novels the different cities actually use slightly different variants of the harpy symbol. The symbol of the old
    Ghiscari Empire
    , which originally founded all three cities as colonies, was of a harpy grasping thunderbolts in its talons. As for the empire's present-day descendants, Astapor uses a harpy with chains and open manacles in its talons, Yunkai's harpy holds a whip and open slave collar, while Meereen's harpy holds nothing. Only the Astapori harpy has explicitly appeared on banners (or sails) so far in the TV series: it is unclear if it is meant to be the

      </i>
      its own unique costume style, out-of-universe. During production on Season 5, the few scenes taking place in Volantis were only in one episode and squeezed in very much at the last minute - after the budget and time for making entirely new sets and costumes had completely been spent on other new locations which appear much more prominently, such as

       Braavos
      </a>
      . Necessity being the mother of invention, however, the production team was still determined to make functional sets and costumes for the brief scenes set in Volantis - by quickly repurposing and modifying pre-existing sets and costumes (in the industry, this is sometimes known as "
      kitbashing
      "). In the Season 5 Blu-ray commentary, costume designer
      Michele Clapton
      explains the process and that ultimately she was very proud of how it turned out and how much work her team put in with limited resources. The cast and crew also had fun trying to guess which bits and pieces of the Volantis set dressing were from what other parts of the TV show. For specifically the
      <i key="ca08c44f-6577-4f87-9a0e-cd780d9ed8b8">

      , with some slight alterations, and intermixed with other pre-existing costumes from Slaver's Bay (see "
      Costumes/The Seven Kingdoms - The Vale of Arryn
      "). Notice that the Volantene envoy's costume is the same style that the characters in Littlefinger's scene from this episode are also wearing, just with some more jewelry and a few pieces changed up. Given the increased budget for Season 6, compared to previous time constraints, it is unclear why the costume department didn't invent a new Volantene style from scratch. Then again, Clapton left the TV series after Season 5 and was replaced this season by
      April Ferry
      as head costume designer: it is possible that Ferry was simply trying to be accurate to the "previously established" Volantene look from Season 5 when she designed the costume of this envoy, not realizing that the "Volantene style" in Season 5 was simply a kitbash of the Vale and Meereen.

People from Yi Ti are East Asian in appearance - Martin has stated that it is loosely this fantasy-world's analogue of Imperial China.

    The showrunners in the Inside the Episode featurette seem to believe Daenerys is always fireproof. The nature of her relationship with fire is mysterious and ambiguous in the novels; Daenerys herself isn't certain whether she is fireproof, and doesn't test it again by jumping into another funeral pyre. In the next unpublished novel she might indeed again miraculously survive a fire unburned.

The lighting of the shot doesn't exactly match the background, which might lead to the assumption that they digitally added her head onto a body double (as was done with Cersei in the Season 5 finale). Actually, the reason the lighting is slightly mismatched is because Clarke filmed the closeup nude scenes on a closed set - not the large on-location set in Spain with hundreds of extras in the crowd (and also, of course, because she couldn't actually be standing unburned in the middle of a raging fire).

      That being said, George R.R. Martin pointed out that even in Season 1, "Osha" in the TV series was very different from "Osha" in the novels (who is older, more stoic, and not as sarcastic). In fact, TV-Osha was one of the very rare cases in which Martin said that (from Season 1) he actually enjoyed the TV version better than the minor character Osha is in the novels - in no small part due to the strength of
      Natalia Tena
      's performance. This is why they gave her more screentime in Season 2; and why she was even brought back for Season 3 (in the novels, Osha leaves Bran right after escaping Winterfell, but the TV version kept her around until they arrived at the Wall). Thus while Osha's death may be an "invention" of the TV series, most of "TV-Osha" was itself an invention of the TV series - she wasn't this prominent of a character in the novels to begin with.

    and their cannibalistic tendencies.

      It's also possible that this is an oblique reference to Osha's storyline in the novels: rather than Last Hearth, she took Rickon to
      Skagos
      . The novels hint that she may have been there before, and the inhabitants of Skagos are rumored to also be cannibals.

    ": she claims that she wants to serve Ramsay, because the Starks mistreated her, and attempts to seduce him sexually. Unfortunately, Ramsay does not fall for the trick, because Theon told him what Osha did in order to help the Stark boys escape (and maybe also because he is more cunning than Theon).

    Jon wonders how come Ramsay refers to himself as "Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North". Sansa tells Jon that Roose is dead, killed by Ramsay. How could Sansa know that, especially if Jon didn't? Ramsay killed his father

    The episode introduces the notorious "Bastard letter" that Jon receives from Ramsay near the end of the fifth novel, in which Jon's reaction to it is actually what leads to the mutiny against him.

      In the show, no doubt is introduced that Ramsay wrote the letter, for its contents are consistent with the previous scenes. In the book, however, there are several anomalies about it - the most conspicuous is that no piece of skin is enclosed, like most of Ramsay's letters - which led to fan speculations that it was not Ramsay who wrote it.
