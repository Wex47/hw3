Tyrion convinces Mord to carry a message to Lady

   and, in exchange, he will give Mord the gold he had with him when he was captured. Lysa summons Tyrion, believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit, but all he confesses to is being a liar, a whoremonger, and a player of disgusting practical jokes. He maintains his innocence of the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder, specifically that of Bran Stark.

  <p key="18bb0076-4f84-4541-8c6f-a7054c54d488">

   Vardis Egen
   agrees. Egen is unwilling to fight Tyrion however, as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable. Tyrion names his own champion: his brother Jaime, considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm. At this Lysa does object, as Jaime is not present and she does not want to wait. She demands that he pick a champion from those present. Tyrion desperately asks for volunteers, and after a long pause during which it seems that Tyrion's cause is lost, the

He says he knows that Jorah wants Daenerys, but he doesn't care. He just wants the eggs so he can hire an army, but he can't get past Ser Jorah and must leave the eggs. Mormont watches him as he leaves.

   Drunk, bitter and angry, Viserys interrupts a feast for Daenerys and Drogo. He angrily demands his payment in return for giving Daenerys to Drogo. He draws his sword, which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city, and threatens Dany and the unborn child, while Irri translates to Drogo.

   seizes him and breaks his arm, making him drop the sword, and kicks him to the floor. Drogo melts his golden belt of medallions in a pot, while Viserys begs Daenerys to help him. Ser Jorah tells her to look away, but she won't. She watches as Khal Drogo "crowns" Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head, causing Viserys to cry out horridly in agony. Viserys falls forward, his head making a loud clang as it connects with the floor. As Daenerys watches her brother die, she coldly states that, having been killed by fire, Viserys was no true dragon.

      It may also have a metaphorical meaning in that the word "crown" can also refer to the top of one's head or the entire head. So, a "golden crown" when "crown" is used this way, could mean blond-headed or, to use the terminology from this episode, "golden haired." This would refer to Ned's revelation of Joffrey's parentage.

    Actor Sean Bean had the flu while filming this episode, so the fevered appearance that Ned Stark has after being stabbed in the leg (particularly when he first wakes up in bed and speaks with Robert and Cersei) is actually a genuine physical reaction by the actor.

   <li key="254e15e0-c448-4140-bf6d-becde75af513">
    According to Emilia Clarke, for the scene where Daenerys eats a horse's heart, the prop she used was made of gummi bear-like material; it tasted awful even though she likes
    Gummi bears
    . Her difficulty choking it down is her actual physical reaction. The gummi-heart was injected with fake-blood which was basically a sugary syrup, so that it could burst out as she bit into the heart. The crew kept injecting it to maintain moisture. By the end the actress was covered in the stuff which was like glue and everything stuck to her. When she used the bathroom she stuck to the toilet seat.

    Viserys notes that Jorah Mormont is blocking him from leaving with the dragon eggs by saying "Here you stand", and Jorah stares him down by replying and emphasizing "Yet here I stand". According to semi-canon sources, the motto of House Mormont is "Here We Stand". It is not clear if this was an intentional reference.

    Originally the meaning of the phrase "make the eight" was unclear. However, it appears to be a reference to the fact that the Riverlands, having been under the occupation of the King of the Iron Islands at the time of Aegon's conquest, is not counted as one of the Seven Kingdoms in the TV series. In the novels, the term is considerably looser and more open to interpretation.

    , but the maps do not reveal at what end of the island the castles lie. It is possible that Joffrey omitted the castles of the Night's Watch on the Wall due to their extra-legal status, and also he was speaking of the "lords and ladies" who would come to a royal wedding, which the Night's Watch doesn't have.

    There was a discussion of how Jack Gleason should play this scene. At first he was going to be disingenuous, but then it was decided that he was more weak than evil, as he is not utterly corrupted until he inherits the throne. He is sincerely apologizing as he did really want a girlfriend. The scene was filmed in an overly romantic way to make it seem melodramatic.

    Viserys's death scene had to be performed in only one take, because it would ruin his costume after the first and only attempt. Smoke machines were strapped to his back and chest, a bald cap was made to resemble molten gold across his face, and the props department forged a gold-like substance that was poured over his head.

    Viserys calls his sister "Dany". Daenerys is referred to by that name in her POV book chapters by the writer, but is very rarely addressed as "Dany" by other characters, both in the books and the show. In fact, Viserys is the only book character who ever used it, and only on one occasion - in the parallel book scene.

    The meaning of Jon Arryn's last words "the seed is strong" is finally revealed in this episode: in modern terms, the meaning is that the Baratheon genes are dominant over the Lannister genes, thus it is unlikely that Cersei would give birth to three golden-haired children in a row - unless Robert is not their biological father.

    For the scene where Viserys is 'crowned', the prop department attached smoke machines to Harry Lloyd's back and front and placed a bald cap over his head to make it look like his hair and skin was being burned. They also created a gold-looking (but cold) liquid to pour over his head. Due to the complexity of the scene, the scene had to be nailed in one take, which was successfully achieved.
