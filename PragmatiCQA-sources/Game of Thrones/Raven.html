   , only a small handful of ravens are intelligent enough to be trained as message carriers, and as such are greatly prized. Even more rarely found are ravens who are so intelligent that they can be trained to fly between multiple locations; a bird who is capable of travelling between four or even five castles occurs only once a century.

   actually do this, but simply aren't coaxed to do it as frequently as pet parrots are. Unlike parrots, which often have high-pitched voices, real-life ravens have a much deeper vocal range and can thus (if given sufficient training) make surprisingly accurate replications of human speech. It is also stated that ravens can speak the language of the

   The white ravens used by the maesters of the Citadel are not albinos, but a separate sub-species. This is evidenced by the fact that their eyes are black, not red as is typically seen in albino animals. White ravens are larger and generally more intelligent than normal ravens, thus they are bred and used for only the most important messages, such as notification that the erratic years-long seasons are changing.

   says at one point that while doves and pigeons can both be trained to carry messages, the maesters don't use doves because ravens are larger and more clever: They have the physical strength to fly longer distances as well as the intellectual capacity to accurately remember the longer path they must take; they are also able to fend off attacks from larger birds of prey - such as hawks - much better than smaller doves or pigeons can.

   in real life, but a raven is not a kind of crow. In-universe, Maester Aemon says that "the crow is the raven's poor cousin", and there are several differences distinguishing them: Ravens are somewhat larger (almost the size of hawks) and have larger bills; crows have a more rounded tail, while ravens have a more pointed tail; crows make a high-pitched "caw" sound, while ravens make a low "croak" sound; crows live around 8 years, while ravens can live for up to 30 years. The collective noun for a group of crows is a "murder", but the collective noun for a group of ravens is actually "unkindness" (alternatively, "conspiracy"). As carrion birds, both crows and ravens will eat corpses on a battlefield, but euphemistically "crows" are more often spoken of as carrion-eaters, i.e. that a battle will make "a feast for crows".
