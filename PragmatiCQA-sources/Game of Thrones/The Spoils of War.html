She explains to them that if she is Arya, they'll be in a lot of trouble for turning her away, and if she isn't, she won't last long in Winterfell anyway. Mildly concerned, they agree to at least let her in the courtyard but insist that she stay put while they consult Sansa so they can disprove her identity. As soon as they take their eyes off her, however, she slips away. The two guards go to inform Sansa and try to wave it aside as just some impostor, but when they mention she asked for Luwin and Cassel, she instantly realizes it must be Arya, and already knows where she has gone.

   Sansa finds Arya where she expected, in the crypts looking over their father Ned's grave. They are happy to see each other but so much has happened to both of them in the past few years that they are at first awkward, unsure of what to say. Arya asks if she has to call Sansa "Lady Stark" now, to which Sansa firmly insists yes, and laughs. They smile and hug, though still a bit unsure. Arya notes that Jon left her in charge and smiles when Sansa says that she hopes Jon will be back soon. He will be both surprised and happy to see Arya, Sansa remembering how happy Jon was to see her when they were reunited. The sisters then look sadly on their father's grave statue. Arya says it doesn't really look like him. Sansa acknowledges that everyone who knew his face well is dead. Arya points out they're not.

This confuses Sansa, and Arya explains that she'd been keeping a list of everyone she was going to kill, at which they both laugh. Finally, Sansa asks how Arya got back, but she only says her road wasn't a pleasant one. Sansa says hers wasn't either. They hug again, earnestly and warmly. Sansa then informs Arya that Bran is home too. Arya is elated, but her face falls when Sansa makes no mention of

Bran says he thought Arya was going to King's Landing, and when Sansa asks why she would head there of all places, he again startles them both by saying it's because Cersei is on her list of names (which he can't possibly be aware of through normal means). Sansa asks who else is on her list, but she says most of them besides Cersei are actually dead already.

Arya uses her speed and agility to compensate for Brienne's strength and size to overwhelm her - until Brienne actually manages to bring her brute strength to bear on a fast moving target by landing a kick on Arya's chest that sends her falling down. Ultimately, they reach a stalemate, with each of them holding a blade at the others' throat. Brienne asks Arya who taught her to fight like that, and she simply responds, "

   The Lannister-Tarly lines around Jaime and Randyll, however, manage to rally under their leadership. The Dothraki charge into the Lannister lines head-on, but meet stiff resistance as their spear wall holds firm. Though they are outnumbered, the Lannister soldiers are better armed with heavy infantry, and highly disciplined, battle-hardened veterans from years of war. Dothraki horse-archers let off shots before charging into their ranks, but highly-trained Tarly archers return fire, doing as much if not more damage, as the Dothraki wear less armor.

   The Lannister army holds their line for a time, but their enemy has the advantage of weight in numbers, and the tide turns slowly against them. The sheer tide of horses smashes through the shield wall, opening up gaps for those behind to charge through. For a moment it looks like Jaime might at least be able to force the Dothraki to a standstill - but then Daenerys wheels out of the air again, devastating the Lannister formations. No longer trying to punch mere holes through their lines, she switches to outflanking the Lannister ranks, burning a vast horizontal swath of men from left to right, obliterating much of the Lannister wagon train in the process.

   Nonetheless, Jaime manages to rally his remaining forces a second time, desperately taking command of a group of surviving Lannister and Tarly archers and directing them to concentrate their fire at the dragon: Drogon might not be vulnerable to common arrow fire, but his rider is. If they can manage to kill Daenerys herself, who has risked appearing in open battle, the entire war could end in a day, no matter their losses. Daenerys sees the attack coming, however, and banks Drogon up so the arrow volley harmlessly bounces off the armored scales on his belly. He then blasts the archer formations with fire. Jaime avoids the flames and is surrounded by enemies, but he manages to carve a path through the Dothraki with his

   's anti-dragon scorpion-bolt launcher (as Jaime cannot fire it one-handed), which they happen to have on hand and which was one of the few wagons not destroyed in the flames. After a moment's hesitation, Bronn fights his way back, killing several Dothraki until one cuts off his horse's leg and sends him sprawling, losing his large bag of gold in the process. Bronn continues to fight his way back on foot, chased by the same Dothraki warrior, who follows him into the wagon he was looking for, just in time to stare down the business-end of the loaded scorpion. He barely has time to realize his fate before Bronn fires a bolt into him, flinging him twenty feet and pinning his corpse to another wagon. Bronn reloads the scorpion as fast as he can (it is meant to be crewed by a team of men), spots the dragon in the distance, and fires, but misses. Daenerys is startled by the scorpion-bolt flying a few feet from her head, scans the battlefield, and spots Bronn on the scorpion as he reloads.

  <p key="9295f3fe-3b93-4e0e-8a18-460ac89067f0">
   Enraged at this direct attack on Drogon, Daenerys then leads Drogon on a direct charge diving straight down at Bronn on the scorpion launcher, who waits for her to approach close enough that he hopefully won't miss before she is right on top of him. He fires another shot, which impales Drogon's right shoulder. The mighty dragon lets out an awful screech and collapses in shock, helplessly dropping into a free-fall from hundreds of feet in the air.

  <p key="7ba33b41-f006-42b4-abff-b4cb4db60f94">
   Bronn is elated, only for Daenerys to quickly break Drogon out of his fall right before they hit the ground, which would have killed them both. The surviving Lannister soldiers then realize that not only is the dragon not dead, he is in a lot of pain and extremely angry. Hovering above the river, Drogon sets his sights on the device which did this to him and angrily sends a fire-blast at the scorpion, destroying it a matter of seconds after Bronn narrowly jumps out of the way to safety.

   The dragon's armored scales are so tough that the scorpion bolt only managed to cause superficial damage. Nonetheless, the flesh wound grounds Drogon, and he howls in pain and fury, destroying the burning scorpion with a swipe of his tail. Any masses of enemy soldiers that are foolish or unlucky enough to get near him are burned alive. Daenerys dismounts and desperately tries to remove the scorpion bolt.
  </p>
  <p key="61addd8b-0784-4637-baaa-449c95d49206">
   By this point, the devastation caused by the dragon and the sheer number of Dothraki have totally overwhelmed the Lannister lines, and with the scorpion destroyed, their last hope is gone and the battle turns into an utter rout and massacre. The Dothraki, who live for combat, show the fleeing Westerosi no mercy and cut them down gleefully on and off horseback.

Tyrion looks gravely on the battlefield, realizing that these are in fact his own countrymen from the Westerlands and House Lannister being massacred, men who Tyrion had previously fought alongside at the Battles of the Green Fork and Blackwater. Many burning and dying men rush to the river to try to extinguish the flames.

  <p key="c62a533d-3688-4f55-99db-e0180f54b833">
   Jaime, however, sees that Daenerys is grounded and immobilized, and realizes he still has one chance; if he can kill Daenerys, even now, he can end her invasion. Jaime grabs a spear and charges his horse across the flaming battlefield to make a death-run for Daenerys as she tends to her dragon. Tyrion swears under his breath, calling his brother a "fucking idiot", angry that he's going to get himself killed.
  </p>
  <p key="ed6afc43-b985-4922-bde1-d915be03af01">
   Just as Jaime is nearly on top of Daenerys, however, Drogon notices him amidst the chaos of the battle. Shielding Daenerys behind his head, the dragon opens his mouth and his throat glows with the promise of fiery death. Just as Drogon unleashes the flames, Bronn rides in and tackles Jaime off his horse, leaving their poor mounts to be consumed instead. They both fall into the river, where Jaime is weighed down by his armor, and sinks beneath the waters, in danger of drowning.

      ", writer Bryan Cogman stated that the way the producers conceptualized Season 7, after so many other seasons split amongst half a dozen disparate storylines, is that it is centered around three "axis" points, or sets of characters: King's Landing, Dragonstone, and Winterfell, plus a side-adventure with Samwell at Oldtown. King's Landing includes Jaime when he's in the Reach, Yara Greyjoy was part of the Dragonstone storyline even in her battle on the Narrow Sea, etc. The key point is that they used to conceptualize of it as the "Arya storyline", the "Stannis storyline", etc. In Season 7, Arya doesn't reach Winterfell until this episode, but it's broadly titled as part of the "Winterfell" storyline more than the "Arya storyline" at this point, as it merges back in with that.

    tried to kill Bran with ("

    "). Catelyn brought it south to King's Landing to try to find its owner, then left it with Ned, and it was last seen on Ned's desk in the
    Tower of the Hand
    when Littlefinger was idly eying it while discussing that Cersei's children were all actually bastards of incest. Littlefinger betrayed Ned in the throne room soon afterwards, and the dagger was never seen again in the TV show - presumably, Littlefinger just picked it up again from Ned's chambers, given that it is a very valuable blade.

      The dagger originally belonged to Littlefinger, but he lost it in a bet on a joust. He deliberately tells Catelyn that he lost it to Tyrion, in order to turn the Starks and Lannisters against each other; that was the purpose he hoped to achieve by making Lysa write her sister about Jon Arryn's death, falsely blaming the Lannisters. In the books, Catelyn finds out too late that Littlefinger lied - he lost it to Robert (as Tyrion points out to her, Littlefinger admitted that Loras unexpectedly beat Jaime in the joust he bet on - but Tyrion would never bet

      In the books, during the brawl in the throne room, Littlefinger snatches the dagger from Ned and holds it to his throat. In the show he acts the same, but it is not clear which dagger it is. It later appeared in the second novel, when Tyrion arrived in King's Landing on commented on the fact that Littlefinger had it (both of them knowing he lied to Catelyn that Tyrion had won it in a bet). Littlefinger draws the dagger, glances at it casually as if he had never seen it before, and mischievously says that it's a very plain weapon (absurd, given how valuable it is) and Tyrion can have it if he wants. Tyrion realizes he's taunting him because he thinks Tyrion can't get to him, and wants Tyrion to know it. It's unknown what happened to the dagger after that, but Littlefinger presumably still has it in possession; in the third novel it is mentioned that he uses a dagger to cut food, but it is not specified which dagger it is.

      Bran refuses to accept the dagger for the same reason Jaime refuses to accept
      Oathkeeper

Given that there are less than 200 surviving Valyrian steel blades in Westeros it isn't unusual that there might be a codex somewhere containing a listing of all of them.

Presumably, all three of them should be using the titles "Prince" or "Princess" now, but it hasn't come up in dialogue so far this season.

In most of these cases, the larger fighter eventually wins as soon as they have one opportunity to bring their full strength to bear. Arya used water dance moves to move around the slow but armored Sandor, who ultimately pinned her sword against his armor then punched her (not out of malice but to teach her the point that armor may slow a man down, but for a

Brienne herself fought the highly skilled Loras Tyrell - by no means small but relative to her huge size - and finished their match by simply tackling him to the ground with brute force. In the gladiator arena, Daario said he thought it was interesting when the smaller but faster fighter was able to outmaneuver a larger man, though admittedly that only happens about one times out of ten - at which, as if on cue, the larger gladiator decapitated the smaller and faster one with a single swing of his sword. In this episode, Arya outmaneuvers Brienne with speed and agility (and lands what

      Aegor Rivers
      , one of Aegon IV's Great Bastards). They have an excellent reputation and will always honor a contract once signed. They were founded by losing soldiers from the

    Cersei clearly states in dialogue, that Westeros is "a continent", not just a country or a large island, an important note for those only going by the TV series. Casual viewers can easily mistake Westeros for a Britain-sized island, especially with the time condensations and the seemingly speedy travel of several characters. George R.R. Martin has stated that his inspiration was essentially to make a fantasy-British Isles... upscaled to roughly the size of South America.

She actually isn't (as Tyrion, Jaime and Kevan repeatedly point out in the novels), but this isn't a major invention of the TV series - his words should not be taken at face value as sincere, he's blatantly just trying to flatter Cersei with excessive praise (similarly, in prior episodes, he complimented her on destroying the Faith Militant as religious fanatics, but she realized he didn't remotely care about that, he'd lend money to religious fanatics so long as they pay him back).

    and several other foreign

The difference is apparently that people in Westeros don't just fear the Dothraki for being "foreign", but additionally as conquering "barbarians" who can't be controlled; in contrast, kingdoms in Westeros have actually hired foreign sellswords from the Free Cities for many centuries, who in theory are more controllable and not "savages". Sellsword companies aren't as common in Westeros as in the Free Cities but they aren't unheard of: in the books, Tywin Lannister himself hired several sellsword companies to supplement his forces, such as the Brave Companions. The Lannister army besieging Riverrun at the
    Battle of the Camps
    also had a Tyroshi sellsword company in it, who afterward, struck their banners and briefly fought on Robb's side, without complaint.

However, in the novels, when Winterfell is surrounded, Theon positively considers Luwin's suggestion to surrender and join the Night's Watch (though not as a chance to redeem himself - he only thinks about the benefits he can get, including bedding wildling women, and does not give any thought about the atrocities he committed). Before Theon can surrender, though, the Bolton forces arrive and attack Winterfell. It is unknown what would have happened had Theon joined the Watch - whether Jon would have killed him or not.

      In the novels, Jon is aware of Janos Slynt's part in his father's downfall and hates Janos for this, but wouldn't abuse his authority as the Lord Commander in order to settle the score with Slynt, as a man is pardoned of all crimes when he takes the black. When Jon executes Slynt, it is because Slynt is insubordinate and disobeys orders multiple times, though it does exact a little bit of justice for Ned Stark. The way Jon interacts with Slynt does not necessarily mean he'd have treated Theon the same, because there is a great difference between them: Slynt was one of the Lannisters' henchman, who owed no loyalty to the Starks; Theon grew up with the Stark children and initially fought on their side, but later he turned against them, performed atrocities at the North (at Stony Shore and Winterfell), on his own.

    - and that leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. He sympathizes with the residents of that region who were robbed of their food supplies, although they were the Lannisters' enemies; he does not offer them any compensations, just forbids his men to loot the leftovers from villages they pass through, and advises people to plant and pray for one last harvest. In the end of the novel, the sight of the falling snow worries him a lot: if it snows in the Riverlands, it may soon be snowing on Lannisport and King’s Landing as well; winter is marching south, and half of the Lannisters' granaries are empty; any crops still in the fields are doomed, and there would be no more plantings, no more hopes of one last harvest. In this episode, Jaime's army outright seizes grain stores from the Reach as spoils of war, even directing Bronn to help encourage resistant farmers to part with their stockpiles.

      We don't know if the Lannisters will fight the Tyrells like this in the next novel, though it does seem likely that Cersei will blow up the Great Sept, which would result in that (whether they'll take Highgarden itself is another matter). Unlike the Riverlands, therefore, this campaign in the Reach is outright war, in which case Jaime seizing their grain stores may not be seen quite as dishonorably as seizing the grain of nominally loyal subjects in the Riverlands who surrendered (even Lord Randyll doesn't shy away from seizing all the grain). Stealing the enemy's food stores often happens in wars - in the books, even Robb Stark's forces captured large herds of cattle during his campaign in the Westerlands.

    The battle between Drogon and the combined forces of House Lannister and the Reach is reminiscent of the
    Field of Fire
    , a pivotal and highly devastating battle during Aegon's Conquest in which House Targaryen defeated Houses Lannister of the Westerlands and Gardener of the Reach using dragons, ending the Gardener line and making the Lannisters bend the knee to Aegon I. The Field of Fire was located a little farther west than this, however: Jaime appears to be in the northeast of the Reach, while the Field of Fire was in the center-north, stated to be where the
    Goldroad
    currently runs (Jaime is on the

    's special anti-dragon bolt launcher is called a "scorpion", apparently a very advanced one. This is as opposed to a "ballista". A
    ballista
    is a huge stationary weapon that needs to be constructed on-site (either as a siege weapon or a defensive weapon for a castle). A
    scorpion
    is smaller than a ballista (technically a kind of ballista), which can be carried by armies on the move and set up comparatively easily. An army couldn't easily carry a full-sized ballista with them, nor hope to set it up in enough time to fight off a suddenly appearing dragon. The difference between a ballista and a scorpion is somewhat like the scale difference between a trebuchet and a catapult. Both ballistae and scorpions are mentioned in the novels as siege engines used in Westeros, but this is the first time a "scorpion" has been referred to as such in TV dialogue.

    to defend against a direct assault by Daenerys on her dragons. Actually, while not overtly stated, this is not implausible: even Jon Snow pointed out in the preceding episode that if Daenerys was going to make a direct assault on King's Landing with her dragons, she would have done it

If Jon realized this, it would probably be apparent to Cersei, Jaime, and Qyburn as well - in which case they correctly anticipated that Daenerys wouldn't use her dragons against the city, but would against their field army, so they deployed the scorpion where they thought she was most likely to attack with her dragons.

    Regarding Dothraki battle tactics seen in this episode, they charge straight at the Lannister heavy infantry. Historically, the Dothraki have held infantry in contempt, thinking they are only fit for being run down by mounted cavalry. They also use their mobility to quickly envelop and outflank enemy infantry, due to being light cavalry not encumbered by heavy armor. Their riders are also armed with both

      This was seen at major historical battles such as the

      and
      Battle of Qohor
      . While it may seem foolhardy to
      <i key="84486600-5b4a-4f4e-8361-4f21580ea6e9">
       directly
      </i>
      charge enemy spearmen, the Dothraki are not entirely wrong in this respect: like most pre-modern armies in real life, most armies in Westeros and Essos are feudal levies who don't actually want to fight to the death for their lords: charging them head-on will very often make them panic and break formation, thus it is actually a fairly reliable military tactic. One Lannister soldier is shown shaking, a reminder of the Dothraki's reputation.
     </li>
     <li key="0c4e495d-7358-4cde-a23c-64e7104f8f7d">
      The Dothraki are actually highly skilled tacticians, they just prefer to make frontal assaults - given that untrained infantry usually break under them. Even if they don't break, they will at least pin down the enemy spearmen, then the Dothraki's more mobile light cavalry flanks will quickly envelop and encircle them.
     </li>
     <li key="fabdbabd-c158-42e4-9e7c-9810130df747">
      The only times a Dothraki frontal charge against spearmen won't work is if they're highly disciplined, well-trained soldiers who will hold their formation. This happened at the
      Battle of Qohor
      about three hundred years ago, in which an
      <a href="Unsullied.html" key="98f92d21-f80f-4504-9cf0-b9e803d0392a" title="Unsullied">
       Unsullied
      </a>
      legion managed to hold off a massive Dothraki horde outside of Qohor, because they are robotically disciplined slave-soldiers who have no fear of death. For this reason, Unsullied are one of the only infantry soldiers that the Dothraki actually respect.
     </li>
     <li key="3d2891d6-e939-4277-a397-9d62ac700ab4">
      The Lannister heavy infantry in this battle are like the Unsullied: disciplined veteran soldiers, under the capable leadership of Jaime and Randyll, who stay in their formation and manage to hold the Dothraki charge to a standstill for a time. The Unsullied at Qohor, however, were positioned with the city walls at their backs, so they couldn't be encircled. Jaime's Lannister army was caught out in the open field, so while they hold their own against a frontal assault for a time, the Dothraki start gradually outflanking them.
     </li>
     <li key="a8be528c-7fb3-47f4-a845-797aa390ff23">
      Drogon's attacks add the problem of giving the Dothraki openings in the defense line and making formations a target. Daenerys's first flame attack created an opening that allowed the Dothraki start encircling them. Lannister formations that managed to hold against the Dothraki, like islands amid their swarm, only became concentrated targets for her dragon's subsequent bombing runs. Ultimately the Lannister infantry were faced with an impossible choice: break formation and get run down by the Dothraki cavalry, or stay in formation and wait for the dragon to pick them off from the sky.

      , the Targaryen dragon-riders shifted tactics in response once again: careful to take their dragons on quick dive-bombing runs and not to stay near the ground for too long, to make it harder for enemy scorpion-launchers to hit them (particularly in their eyes). Case in point is the
      Siege of Rook's Rest

    if she wants to ensure their safety. Dragons are just animals, albeit intelligent ones, but without a rider they will let their anger get the better of them and charge headlong at enemy archers and scorpion-launchers - increasing the chance of killing them. A human rider is needed to deploy them using intelligent tactics, and keep them from needlessly risking their lives: i.e. Daenerys made Drogon turn his head away from arrow volleys, and managed to rouse him out of shock from the scorpion-bolt hit before the fall could kill him. Thus, if she had brought brought Rhaegal and Viserion with her and Bronn had hit one of them, he may well have succeeded in killing it. She previously used all three at the
    Second Siege of Meereen
    with the other two just following her on Drogon - but they were attacking a surprised naval force, unprepared for their assault.

      , a similar problem occurred, when
      Rhaenyra Targaryen
      had more dragons than current riders (six that had no current riders, or had never been ridden). Rhaenyra was even based on Dragonstone at the time, just like Daenerys. To overcome this problem, Rhaenyra put out a search for "

     Battle of the Whispering Wood

    . In the fourth book, he uses that lesson in an opposite manner - he takes precautions even when it seems unnecessary, to prevent anyone from taking him unawares as Robb did to him. Had Jaime acted that way in this episode (by sending scouts and placing sentries around his host), he might have been forewarned in time and could have arranged the troops in a better position, and prepared the anti-dragon weapon. Under such conditions, it is uncertain the outcome of the battle might have been different, but Daenerys's victory might have been more costly than it was.

    Jaime's desperate victory-or-death charge against Daenerys at the end of the battle is entirely within character for him: in Season 1, the TV show had to leave the Battle of the Whispering Wood off-screen for budgetary reasons (Jaime actually mentioned it by name to Olenna in the immediately preceding episode). The books describe what happened: when Jaime's cavalry were totally surrounded in an ambush and all hope of victory was lost, he spotted Robb Stark himself on the battlefield, and much like this episode, made a desperate charge straight at him - thinking he still had a slim chance of ending the Northern rebellion then and there if he could kill Robb himself. A preternaturally skilled swordsman and considered one of the top two or three warriors in all of Westeros, Jaime did manage to carve a path through Robb's bodyguards which killed many, but eventually their numbers overcame him and they piled on to Jaime to take him alive.

    Though Tyrion has effectively turned against his family and sided with Daenerys, it is obvious that he still holds a degree of familial loyalty for Jaime, as it was Jaime who freed him from the dungeons of the Red Keep, enabling him to escape Westeros before being executed for murdering Joffrey (which was done by Olenna Tyrell).

In this episode, Tyrion spots Jaime on the battlefield and silently begs Jaime to flee for his life, confirming that despite Tyrion working against his family, he does not want his brother to die (it is highly likely that he is indifferent towards Cersei dying, as Cersei effectively used Joffrey's death as an excuse to try and have him killed instead of trying to find the real culprits).
