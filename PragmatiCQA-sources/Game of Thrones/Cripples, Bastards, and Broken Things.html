   a truly boring book about the lineages

   Syrio
   . Arya asks whether Bran would be able to live in King's Landing with them now that he's awoken, but Eddard states that he would have to regain his strength first. Arya then comments that Bran had always wanted to be a knight in the King's Guard, but will no longer be able to due to his paralysis. Eddard confirms this to be the case, but states that Bran will be able to do many other things such as become lord of a holdfast, sit on the King's council, or raise castles. When Arya asks if she would be able to become any of those, Eddard instead tells her that she will marry a highborn lord and have lords and princes for sons. However, Arya is not pleased with this response, telling her father, "that's not me." She goes back to balancing on one leg as Eddard looks on.

   Jory Cassel
   to question Jon Arryn's former squire, Ser
   Hugh
   of the Vale. However, deducing that Jory was not a knight, Ser Hugh simply rebuffs him and refuses to speak with him due to his much lower rank. Eddard's investigation leads him to a smithy in the city, where he meets master smith

Mott has Gendry show Eddard a bull's head helm he made as a sample of his work which Eddard commends, but Gendry adds that it's not for sale. Mott scolds him but Gendry states he made it for himself, and Eddard assures Mott he's not offended.

Littlefinger sits next to Sansa, and remarks that she and Joffrey have had a lover's quarrel (as Joffrey is still giving her the cold shoulder). Baelish then tells Sansa that Gregor, the "Mountain That Rides", has a dark reputation: he pushed his little brother Sandor's face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young, burning him severely. Littlefinger recommends that Sansa not spread that story around.

    The scene with Viserys and Doreah in the bath discussing dragons was filmed for the previous episode but moved to this episode for timing reasons. Writer Bryan Cogman was unaware of this change until he saw the final episode. One of the dragons mentioned in this scene, Vermithrax, is a nod to the 1981 fantasy movie

    The episode title came out serendipitously, as the theme of outcasts, cripples and bastards was not in Bryan Cogman's mind when he wrote the episode but emerged naturally.

    Bryan Cogman was a big fan of Owen Teale from his work on stage in New York and was thrilled to see him cast as Alliser Thorne.

    The relationship between Samwell and Jon Snow is Bryan Cogman's favorite in the whole series.

   <li key="d936d451-4abc-478a-a0f2-2ae6d7c2c234">
    The Vaes Dothrak scenes were actually filmed in Northern Ireland (with some CGI enhancements, such as the large cliffs). This surprises Kit Harington, who assumed it was one of the scenes shot in Malta.
   </li>
   <li key="2c599dd6-8ce9-4090-a3b4-ecdc66bd0974">
    Bryan Cogman's take on the
    sexposition
    scenes was that Doreah's line from the second episode, "Men like to talk when they are happy," is accurate, and the sex scenes expose characters when they are vulnerable and thus more open to show their true natures.
   </li>
   <li key="797d8995-9092-4cb6-ab32-569e7f80d983">
    The episode is heavy on establishing backstory and mythology, which again was not planned in the writing but happened to turn out that way.
   </li>
   <li key="460673e8-6e05-4a25-9b4c-79afdcbdb8c3">
    The small council scenes were among Bryan Cogman's favorite. They were filmed very close together over a period of several days.

    During Sam and Jon's exchange in the messhall, Kit Harington's idea was to jump over the table to playfully hit Sam. However, he 'totally stacked it' and ended up on the floor. The director drily suggested just shooting it as it was written.

    Kit Harington and John Bradley-West got stuck in the Castle Black lift for well over an hour when it suffered a mechanical failure. Kit started getting worried when a nurse was called on-set just in case they suffered injuries.

   <li key="ac44962f-c911-4523-8d7f-31724dfed66e">
    Bryan Cogman and Kit Harington are both fans of Sansa's character development and feel she gets a bad rap from some parts of the fanbase.
   </li>
   <li key="7aa8c6a2-a531-48c5-adf7-d931c0bdb894">
    The tourney scene was much larger and more elaborate in the script, more like the scene in the book, but had to be trimmed back. Amongst the problems was a very tight schedule for filming the tourney scenes for both the fourth and fifth episodes which prevented too many shorts or montages.
   </li>
   <li key="318ec931-78a6-4bd4-93b4-b0433faae6de">
    Bryan Cogman acknowledges that it would have been better to have had Sandor tell Sansa his backstory in person (as in the books) but there were production reasons this was not possible. He reassures fans that the Sandor/Sansa subplot will still unfold, only differently to in the books.

   <li key="396425c4-2897-46cd-957c-89bb49c6a8df">
    The scene between Eddard and Cersei in the Hand's quarters was the first scene filmed for the series (aside from the pilot).
   </li>
   <li key="3a561cdd-cfe3-4eed-bae7-a263cd23c85f">
    Cogman preferred not to change George R.R. Martin's dialogue or writing unless absolutely necessary for production, money or time reasons. His approach was, "Why mess with perfection?"
