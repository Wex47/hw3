Jaime makes it clear that Cersei lied to him as well, and that she never had any intention of sending her army north. Jaime tells her that Cersei has

   Tyrion tries to step in, but Daenerys quickly stops him because Tyrion was wrong about his sister too. Tyrion argues that the fact Jaime knew of the cold reception he'd get at Winterfell but came anyway surely has to mean something, but Daenerys suggests Jaime came north with the intention of worming his way into her confidence with Tyrion's help, and potentially assassinating her. Sansa surprisingly takes Daenerys's side, agreeing that they can't trust him, that Jaime
   attacked their father in the streets
   and tried to destroy her house and family the same as he did Daenerys's. Jaime quickly retorts if it's an apology they are seeking, they won't get it. He says they were at war, and that everything he did, he did for his house and his family and would do it all again. Bran interjects: "The things we do for love."

She then looks to Sansa and adds that without Jaime, she wouldn't be alive; moreover, Jaime armed and armored her, and sent her to find Sansa and bring her home because he swore an oath to her mother. Sansa eventually agrees that they should let Jaime stay, without seeking approval for this from Daenerys first. Daenerys looks at Jon and asks his advice on the matter. Jon says they need every man they can get. Daenerys eventually acquiesces, and Tyrion sighs in relief.

When Daenerys, Tyrion, Jorah and Varys are walking down a corridor, Daenerys vents her anger about Cersei's betrayal. She says that Tyrion either knew Cersei was lying or allowed himself to be duped by her.

Gendry asks Arya if she has something better to do, for which she replies, "Have you made my weapon yet?" He remarks he'll get to it after he's done making a few 1,000 more arrowhead style weapons first. Arya says he needs to make hers first, and that it should be stronger than the weapon he's currently working on. Gendry says it'll be safer down in the crypt anyway. Arya asks if he'll be in the crypt, and he says no. She then questions, "but you're a fighter?". Gendry says he's done his share and even fought a few. He even describes the

Arya adds, "I look forward to seeing this one," and throws the last dagger, it landing exactly beside the other two weapons.

Jaime says he isn't that person anymore. Bran states that he still would be if he hadn't pushed him out of that window, and that he'd still be Brandon Stark. Curious, Jaime simply asks, "You're not?" Bran replies that he isn't, and that he is something else now. Jaime is curious why Bran isn't angry at him, and Bran says he isn't angry at anyone. Jaime asks why Bran didn't tell anyone the truth. He replies that Jaime wouldn't have been able to help them in this war if they had been able to murder him first. When he asks about 'afterwards', Bran says, "how do you know there is an afterwards?".

   While Tyrion is walking about the castle grounds inspecting everything, Jaime approaches him. The brothers are back together, saying a quick "here we are" to one another. Up on a staircase, one of the Stark military men spits down near the Lannister brothers, where Tyrion replies "and the masses rejoice". Jaime asks Tyrion what they think of their new Queen Daenerys. After reminding Jaime that she's now his new queen as well, he remarks the people remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought

And when Jaime states that Daenerys didn't seem to be sure of his brother, Tyrion agreed saying he didn't blame her. During their conversation, Tyrion finds out through Jaime that Cersei's pregnancy wasn't a lie.

   Jaime says for Tyrion to not be too hard on himself, that Cersei fooled him more than anybody. Tyrion states that Cersei never fooled him, that Jaime always knew exactly what she was and he loved her anyway. Tyrion tells Jaime he never imagined he'd die at Winterfell, bringing a past joke between the two of exactly how Tyrion pictured himself dying. As Tyrion is talking, finding some black humor in the prospect that being killed by the undead will deny Cersei the satisfaction of having him killed, Jaime is distracted and walks away to look out in the distance at Brienne, who is overseeing sword practicing in the yard.

She states it is great ground and with the rise it would give good advantage. Quickly, she finally turns to him and asks what he's doing, knowing they've never had a conversation this long without him insulting her. He finally admits that he came to Winterfell because he's not the fighter he use to be, and that he'd be honored to serve under her command, if she'd have him.

Daenerys requests a private audience with Sansa; once Royce is gone, Daenerys remarks on how she thought they were on the verge of agreeing in regards to Jaime, and asks Sansa why she changed her mind. Sansa replies that she trusts Brienne's judgement completely. Daenerys responds that she wishes she could have faith like that in her own advisors. Sansa tells Daenerys that Tyrion is a good man; he was nothing but decent to her while she was captive in King's Landing. Daenerys replies she chose Tyrion for her Hand not just because he was good, but also because he was intelligent and ruthless when necessary. Daenerys adds, "He never should have trusted Cersei," to which Sansa replies, "You never should have either."

   Wanting to clear the air and find common ground between them, Daenerys acknowledges she and Sansa have similar experiences: they have complicated families, they're both women who've been trusted with ruling in a world where few women can do that — and they've done it well, to which Sansa agrees. However, Daenerys notes that despite this, she can't help but feel they're still at odds with one another but then realizes, "Your brother." Sansa admits she is wary of Daenerys because Jon clearly loves Daenerys, remarking that men do foolish things for the women they love, and their emotions can be manipulated to exploit them. Daenerys replies she's only known one goal all her life - the Iron Throne - but then she met Jon. Now, she's at the North, having brought her armies north to fight the Army of the Dead. Taken aback, Sansa responds she should have thanked Daenerys when she arrived and Daenerys confides she is here because she loves Sansa's brother and trusts him completely, "He's only the second man in my life I can say that about." When Sansa asks about the first, Daenerys replies, "

Tyrion declares that he and Davos will signal Jon and Daenerys at the right time to ignite the trench around Winterfell, but Daenerys overrides him, declaring he will be in the crypts for his own safety; if the battle is won, she will need him. Davos suggests the dragons will be helpful on the battlefield, but Jon notes they need the dragons near the godswood to protect Bran, when Bran is luring the Night King in for an ambush; they'll hold the dragons back to keep the Night King from suspecting a trap, then when their enemy makes his move for Bran, they'll strike. Arya asks if dragonfire will stop the Night King, to which Bran can only reply he has no idea, as no one has ever tried that.

   At the large fireplace in the main hall of Winterfell castle, Tyrion and Jaime are drinking and talking. At one point, Tyrion says he'd love to see

Eventually Davos joins them to warm himself by the fire, as does Tormund who instantly hones in on Brienne, bragging how he killed a giant at the age of 10. He then tells them how he got his surname 'Giantsbane' by being nursed be a

   Jaime refills his drink and mentions aloud, that the tradition isn't necessarily true. He states that any knight can make a knight.

   his sword

Of course, Daenerys finds it nearly impossible to believe, especially that the truth came from two men so close to Jon.

      As Benioff acknowledged in the Inside the Episode featurette, while Jenny's Song is famous in the books, only the first lines have actually been presented in the text, so they had to invent the next few lines to fit with it. The full importance of the song hasn't been revealed, but it was about
      Jenny of Oldstones
      - a commoner that the Targaryen crown prince abdicated to marry. The crown then passed to his younger brother, and then to

      , the Mad King, setting in motion the events surrounding Rhaegar, Lyanna, Jon, and Daenerys's lives. There is some speculation that Jenny's Song might have even been the specific one that Rhaegar performed during the great Tourney at Harrenhal, singing and harping the mournful song so beautifully that Lyanna Stark wept and fell in love with him.

Unfortunately, the intended display of power doesn't work, as both Sansa and Jon end opt to let Jaime stay, so Jaime can help them battle against the Army of the Dead instead of being killed. The whole event leaves Daenerys upset that her supposed allies either openly disagree with her, or in the case of Tyrion, have failed her.

    Sothoryos
    , the third continent, which is loosely their Fantasy world's version of Africa. Missandei explains here that the people of Naath are peaceful, and cannot defend themselves. The books give more detail: the Naathi "cannot" defend themselves due to their religious beliefs, which command utter pacifism. Their religion forbids them from taking any life, to the point that they will not eat the flesh of animals, and are strict vegetarians. So great is their devotion to pacifism that they are forbidden to resort to violence even to directly defend their own lives. Unfortunately, this has made them a favored target for slaver-raids from foreign lands.

      The books further reveal that the reason the Naathi have survived so long despite their extreme pacifism is that the island is home to a terrible plague, carried by butterflies, which causes the flesh to literally slough off a man's bones like wet parchment. The Naathi themselves are immune to this disease, but a drawback is that outsiders cannot survive on the isle for more than a few hours. This dialog doesn't take into account if

Not only are all of the towers in place, but everyday things such as functional baker's ovens, kitchens, brewing vats, etc. Another major new addition was the Winterfell library set, where Sansa and Daenerys have their long discussion scene (which is incredibly detailed, even featuring direwolf heads carved into the ceiling beams).

    We have no idea if Arya and Gendry will begin a relationship in the books, as the TV series has surpassed the current novels. So far, there have not been any hints of romance between them; in fact, Arya at first intends to kill Gendry once he discovers she is a girl, and what stops her is not her conscience or any romantic feelings - but the simple fact that he is armed and stronger than her. She feels a bit sad when he decides to remain with the brotherhood, but soon gets over it; in the fourth novel, she barely gives him any thought.

The TV show streamlined this to have Gendry hiding out in King's Landing itself.

      skims through quickly to find any important parts. Therefore Turner found the sex scene first, and quickly phoned Williams, urging her to immediately read ahead to it.  Even then, Williams explained, she honestly thought it was a prank by the showrunners - as they have been known to do, on multiple past occasions, when they gave cast members fake scripts (i.e.

      killing Theon at the end of Season 2, Jon Snow getting horrifically burned when he first killed a wight in Season 1).  Soon after, however, the showrunners assured her that it wasn't a prank, and that they hadn't done any script pranks for the final season.  By the time of the table read, she realized it was actually going to happen:  "I got to the read-through and I'm reading the scene and thought, 'Oh, we're actually going to do this. When do I shoot this? I need to go to the gym.' A whole list of things."
     </li>
     <li key="e918a2ba-b250-4212-bbdd-e5385167d885">
      She went on to explain that the showrunners gave her control over how much nudity to actually have in the scene (apparently there was no body double), saying:  "David and Dan were like: 'You can show as much or as little as you want. So I kept myself pretty private. I don't think it’s important for Arya to flash. This beat isn't really about that. And everybody else has already done it on the show, so..." - Williams did say she was a little embarrassed when it came to actual filming: "In the beginning, everyone was really respectful. No one wants to make you feel uncomfortable which kind of makes you feel more uncomfortable, because no one wants to look at anything that they shouldn’t look at, which in turn makes you feel like you look awful because everyone is kind of like - " [averts her eyes] - "You want people to act more normal."

     <li key="b1f810c6-4873-4944-8661-b841bd81b6ff">
      As for the emotional significance of the scene for Arya, Maisie Williams confirmed that this wasn't just Arya having random casual sex because she might die tomorrow, but a growing emotional intimacy with Gendry and reclaiming part of her humanity after being consumed with killing for so many years: "It was really interesting because it’s a very human relationship for Arya. This is something she's stayed away from, an emotion we've never really seen her engage with. David and Dan were like, 'It's the end of the world, what else would you have her do?' This may be is a moment where Arya accepts death tomorrow, which she never does — 'Not Today.' So it was that moment where she says, 'We're probably going to die tomorrow, I want to know what this feels like before that happens.' It's interesting to see Arya be a bit more human, speak more normally about things people are scared of."

        Two days after the episode aired, Maisie Williams did post a message on her Twitter channel pointing out that no matter how uncomfortable viewers may have been, "If u feel uncomfortable just know that my mother and my step dad and my 2 sisters and my 4 brothers have all probably watched this too ahahakillmeehehe".

   <li key="fafd9321-10b9-4c0b-bbdd-fb48302a19cb">
    Screenwriter Bryan Cogman in a post-episode interview reiterated Maisie's statements that Arya was reclaiming part of her humanity, and had her own agency in the sex scene:  "She's been so focused on one thing for so long, which is vengeance, and almost forgetting herself and forgetting what it is to be human. That was very much what the time with the Faceless Men was—it was about erasing humanity.  This is her facing what she thinks might be her imminent demise.  It's like she's thinking, 'I want to be a human being. I want to be a young woman. I want to experience this stuff, and I want to experience it on my terms' - and she drives the scene...Gendry's more than happy to go along with it, but it's all on her terms."
   </li>
   <li key="71981c1c-4048-4e68-9a26-e7e14ea5587a">
    Cogman did stress that Arya is a "woman" now ("a teenager", "not a child") and not having underaged sex, pointing out that Maisie Williams is herself 22 years old.  He scoffed, however, that it was "foolhardy" to figure out Arya's exact age given how sloppy ("murky") the timeline has gotten on the show.  In contrast with Cogman, however, the official HBO Twitter channel prominently tweeted out hours before the episode aired that Arya is 18 years old now.
    According to timeline kept by

   The short answer is that the TV writers did not thoroughly keep track of the internal
   Timeline
   . Particularly, travel time stops following established information, so that journeys that should have taken weeks or months could take plays in days - or even a few hours, as was the case with the

    It generally seems that the TV show continued to follow the rule that one TV season equals one year, though somewhat more loosely, and as more of an average in the later seasons.

    An internal event which can be timed is that Gilly's son was born on-screen in Season 3. This puts an upper limit on how much time has passed in the TV series: something like "ten years" can't have passed between Seasons 3 and 8 due to unstated, off-screen time skips, otherwise Gilly's son would look like a ten year old.

   In the books, the age of legal adulthood in Westeros is 16 years old - though the TV series apparently made a tacit retcon of this up to 18 years, due to legal restrictions on depicting very young characters having sex: specifically due to Daenerys's sex scenes in Season 1). Because Daenerys's birth is tied to the end of Robert's Rebellion (being born after her father died at the end of it), Robert's Rebellion had to be pushed back from 15 years before the beginning of the narrative in the first book, to 17 years before Season 1. Most younger characters were then aged-up by two years to match this. Daenerys was still, fundamentally, a 16 year old having sex with

  </p>
  <p key="86b1cabd-28a8-4b60-a6a0-2f5647531c69">
   Cogman explained that this was the most difficult script he ever wrote for the TV show, as it didn't have a single through-plot or battle, but consisted of various character reunions.  The challenge this presented, he pointed out, is that characters who haven't seen each other for multiple TV seasons logically

  <p key="b8166828-435e-4d67-83dc-7f637a3ed6c2">
   Cogman lamented that his first draft of the script that he submitted to Benioff and Weiss was awful, because "it was a Wikipedia page".  The showrunners then sent back his draft covered with revisions written in red ink, to "streamline" the dialogue.  Many lines of dialogue were removed from throughout the script, and instead replaced with non-verbal moments of the actors reacting to each other with their eyes and facial expressions.
  </p>
  <p key="b2516d61-3c65-42ab-9d58-e6a9dea1528d">
   Among the scenes significantly affected by these revisions:

  <ul key="b0db5d83-24c1-4760-a01d-dc052d7967bd">
   <li key="1e0759c7-3bb2-4ecd-859f-3806fdee2e1a">
    Jaime's trial scene was originally much longer, as Brienne recounted all of her journey with Jaime in great detail.
   </li>
   <li key="b4d0b9bf-41c7-4c06-9cb3-593403742d59">
    The final scene of Jon telling Daenerys his real parentage just ends in a one-line reaction from Daenerys, before they are interrupted.  In the original draft, the scene continues on for a significant amount of time beyond that, as they fully discuss all of the ramifications of this.
   </li>
   <li key="17ad8d6d-b5ad-4d90-b603-16d272601fc9">
    When Theon is reunited with Sansa, in the final version all she does is hug him.  Originally, Cogman wanted to have a full scene of dialogue beyond that, as Theon and Sansa fully talked out and reflected on their shared trauma as victims of
    <a href="Ramsay Bolton.html" key="cfa29f26-05b6-4378-8b6a-d09d38dcd8e4" title="Ramsay Bolton">

    , what they went through and what they'll do now.  Cogman said he struggled to write this scene for two weeks, but ultimately didn't even include it in the first draft he submitted.
   </li>
   <li key="7be14c40-4aba-4ff8-b702-f362f5cda530">
    The most drastically changed scene was the one of Davos and Gilly, which was totally redone from scratch.  In the original version, Davos and Gilly would be talking and stumble onto the fact that they both only recently learned how to read, and then realize that
    <a href="Shireen Baratheon.html" key="f68e52ef-6e5a-42b8-b995-3a33fa6bc2d8" title="Shireen Baratheon">
     Shireen Baratheon
    </a>
    taught both of them.  Benioff and Weiss convinced him that this was "contrived", so they rewrote it into a scene of Davos and Gilly serving soup to refugees, when a girl with a burn scar on her cheek shows up - non-verbally reminding them both of Shireen, though in this version the name "Shireen" isn't spoken aloud, but playing off the actors' facial reactions.
