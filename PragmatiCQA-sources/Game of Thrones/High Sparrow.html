   The man who would become the High Sparrow was born to a fairly well off cobbler. After his father's passing, the young Sparrow continued and greatly improved the family business. Many highborn citizens sought out his wares and were happy to pay hefty sums. In turn, the man took extreme pride in his work, often spending night and day crafting a pair of shoes. The Sparrow became ever richer and adopted an extravagant lifestyle. He sought to distance himself from his humble roots and thus began to mimic the nobility who bought from him. The soon-to-be septon was known for giving lavish parties that ended in debauchery. After one such night with too much wine and women, the Sparrow woke up at the crack of dawn. Ashamed of what he had devolved into, the Sparrow up and left his life, not even bothering to put on his shoes. He began to minister to the less fortunate because he now felt they were closer to the Seven than anyone.

He adds that the smallfolk are many while the nobility are few, and asks what will happen when the many stop fearing the few. He then leaves her.

   built on top of it. He tells her of the limited known history of the chapel, making plain his love of the simplicity in how it represents pure faith and compares it unfavorably to the grandiosity of the Great Sept. He uses this comparison to show how the highborn, like the Tyrells, can be stripped back to reveal the pure truth beneath their facade and then openly wonders and asks what they will find of Cersei once they strip back her finery to reveal the truth beneath.

The Queen has shown true devotion to the Seven and has even brought Tommen into their ranks, so there is no need for punishment of any kind.

   The High Sparrow presents himself as humble, pious and wise. He is unmoved by life's luxuries and abjures materialism. While some other septons are indifferent toward the small-folk and their problems, the High Sparrow consistently shows concern and compassion.
  </p>
  <p key="7fbe2ed6-6c4c-49ec-9d34-cc4500d5dc30">
   However, behind this harmless facade, he is ruthless, fanatical and unwavering in his beliefs as well as a shrewd, devious and Machiavellian political player with a blade-sharp mind and a deep understanding of the narcissistic mindsets of many of the political players of Kings Landing. He manipulates Cersei's resentment toward Margaery to gain control of King's Landing through the Faith Militant. Later, he gains influence over the naive and weak-willed King Tommen Baratheon, obtaining even more power through deliberate manipulation and exploitation of the young king. He also psychologically tortured Cersei, Loras, and Margaery to obtain a confession on their "sins".
  </p>
  <p key="aa03b04b-5ff7-4355-8b78-706fd67d73fd">
   It's unclear if he really believes in his piety or if his humility is only a facade to obtain power. He has shown to display a smug smile when he knows he has the upper hand in a conflict, and he displays a rather arrogant certainty in his interpretation of the will of the Gods. Even if this is so, whether he does it for a genuine greater good strengthened by faith or for his own political agenda and hubris - perhaps a combination thereof, as is often the case with those of similar ambitions - is unclear. Despite this, he appears to be unafraid of death, remaining calm when Jaime threatens to cut him down, though this could just be because he gauged, quite correctly, that Jaime would not kill him if it were to mean his own death afterwards although he did seem shocked when he discovered that Cersei had laced the Great Sept of Baelor with wildfire just before his death.

   However, despite his brilliant manipulations and his army of followers, the High Sparrow's blind devotion ultimately led to his death. As Cersei put it; because he had no use for anything in the material world, he was unafraid of any threat the material world could produce. Somewhat similar to

   , a lack of fear limits a person's understanding as to how scared people think, thus making it difficult for them to manipulate those people. The High Sparrow was over-confident that Cersei was powerless against himself and his followers. Therefore, he was unable to comprehend how extreme her actions would become in order to eliminate them (i.e. blowing up the Sept of Baelor with wildfire and killing dozens - if not hundreds - of innocent people in the process).
