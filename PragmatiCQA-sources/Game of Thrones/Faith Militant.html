   Members of the Faith Militant typically garbed themselves in rough-spun robes of dyed black wool, which they fasten around their waists with chains. They arm themselves with clubs, maces, and cudgels. To show their absolute devotion, they carved their foreheads with the Seven-Pointed Star, the symbol of the Faith of the Seven.

   The Faith Militant traces its roots to the original Andal Invaders who set out to conquer Westeros. The Andals had carved the Seven-Pointed Star into their foreheads, a practice that the Faith Militant would adopt. As Andal Warriors fought the First Men, Septons had attempted to convert them, and were met with the same brutality. Eventually many of the Faith's followers took up the sword to defend and preserve it from it's enemies, and so the Faith Militant was founded.

   Visenya
   and
   Rhaenys
   ), and none of the siblings were wholly devoted to the Faith, the Faith wasn't in much position to oppose the victorious Targaryen armies or the dragons. Aegon I however, understood to tread lightly with the Faith, and both sides came to agree that incestuous marriage was a relic of the past destined to fade. Aegon I intended for the practice to end in the future generations of his dynasty and promised it to the Faith, who in return did not press the matter for the remainder of his life.

  <p key="3a896d9b-e7e1-4d34-b70b-3c390be2b357">
   When Aegon’s eldest son, King
   Aenys Targaryen
   , wed his daughter Princess
   Rhaena
   to his son Prince
   Aegon
   , it was met with outrage as the agreement with Aegon I was broken. This would spark the
   Faith Militant uprising
   , in which the High Septon denounced the Targaryen Dynasty and many noble lords followed their lead, attacking the Targaryens and their followers. Aenys, proved to be inept in the face of the revolt and was completely overwhelmed. The lords who supported him were attacked by the Faith Militant all across the Seven Kingdoms, and members of the Faith Militant nearly killed Aenys and his family when they scaled the partially completed walls of the Red Keep, but failed due to the efforts of the Kingsguard.
  </p>
  <p key="53d96fa8-1c8c-47ad-bec5-510cbdd8104a">
   After Aenys died, he was succeeded by his younger half-brother,
   Maegor the Cruel
   , who seized power ahead of Aenys's children and struck back against the Faith Militant. Maegor's first act when arriving in King's Landing was to challenge the Faith Militant's leaders in personal combat, to which they accepted. Ser
   Damon Morrigen
   , a leader of the Faith Militant, proposed a trial by seven - the more dangerous but theoretically more holy variant of a traditional

   Ser Damon and six of the Faith Militant fought Maegor and six members of the Kingsguard
   . Out of the fourteen men, only Maegor himself was said to have lived and proved that the throne was rightfully is.
  </p>
  <p key="49f56643-218a-4f46-9a2e-72aaef104d1b">
   After surviving the trial by seven, Maegor promptly mounted his father's dragon,
   Balerion
   , flew to the local Faith Militant chapter's headquarters at the Sept of Remembrance, and
   burned it down with hundreds of members inside
   in the middle of the morning prayers. Maegor demanded the complete destruction of the Faith Militant and made war on the order wherever he found it. The order refused to surrender and instead raised their own armies and won over many lords who supported Maegor. The uprising would last for the duration of Maegor's reign.

   Inside the Sept, Queen Margaery attempts to convince the High Sparrow that Cersei is planning something: she knows fully well the consequences of not being present at her own trial, and yet she has chosen to fail to appear anyway.

   novels, the Faith Militant is the collective name of two military orders: the Warrior's Sons and the Poor Fellows. They were also known as the "Swords and Stars" for their symbols: the sword for the Warrior's Sons and the star for the Poor Fellows. The TV series apparently simply condensed them into one order, "the Faith Militant".

   The Warrior's Sons were the higher order, composed of knights and younger sons of high lords. Similar to the

   , noblemen who join the Warrior's Sons swore to give up all inheritance, marry no wives, and father no children. Their swords were sworn directly to the service of the
   High Septon
   . They were named specifically for the Warrior, one of the
   aspects of the seven-in-one godhead
   , who represents martial prowess (i.e. if this were Greek mythology, they would be called "Ares's Sons"). The Warrior's Sons tended to be well-trained and well-equipped knights, and had a reputation for fanaticism and brutality against enemies of the Faith.

   The Poor Fellows were the lower order, whose members are commoners. Women could not join the Warrior's Sons, but they could join the Poor Fellows (few if any women would have the professional martial training and expensive military equipment to join the Warrior's Sons). The Poor Fellows were vastly more numerous than the Warrior's Sons, though this was their only advantage. Its members tended to be poor penitents with nothing to lose by joining the order, armed with only axes and clubs. The sheer numbers of the Poor Fellows could be overwhelming, however, and they could quickly replenish their forces - given that potentially anyone who followed the Faith of the Seven and who could swing a club could become a Poor Fellow.

   of the Warrior's Sons was a rainbow-colored sword shining in the darkness - rainbows are more commonly used in the novels as a symbol of the Faith, because they are one beam of light refracted into seven colors, and thus a metaphor for the Seven-in-One God. The TV series consistently avoided showing such symbols, apparently because they might be seen as silly by casual viewers. The Poor Fellows, meanwhile, used banners or simple badges consisting of a red Seven-Pointed Star - just like the normal Seven-Pointed Star symbols found throughout most of Westeros, which were thus easy to acquire, though they made sure to color them in red (apparently to signify battle). The TV series simplified both orders into just "the Faith Militant", and doesn't specifically give them a new banner so much as they just use the Seven-Pointed Star very prominently - though the TV series has usually used a

   Unlike in the show, members of the Faith Militant are not required to carve the Seven-Pointed Star symbol onto their foreheads. Most of them paint the star on their brows or sew a badge of it to their clothes. Only the zealous among them carve the star into their chests, not their foreheads.

   tread lightly around the Faith, and was able to placate them during his reign. The Faith's leaders never approved of Aegon I's incestuous marriages and bloodline, but they did not openly speak out against it either, in a grudging and unspoken truce. After Aegon I died, however, the Faith did rise up against his two sons,
   Aenys
   and
   Maegor
   . While they had no sisters to marry, Aenys eventually grew foolhardy enough that four years into his reign he announced the marriage of his son and daughter, at which point the Faith exploded into open rebellion. The Faith Militant uprising spread across southern Westeros, and lasted throughout the rest of Aenys's reign - which lasted less than a year - and subsequently throughout Maegor's six year reign. Maegor would brutally crush the Faith Militant's armies but they inflicted grievous casualties on his forces, and new popular revolts under the banner of the Poor Fellows popped up faster than he could destroy them. Maegor enacted laws forbidding any holy man to carry weapons - later known as Maegor's Laws -, while putting a bounty on the lives of members of the Faith Militant: a Gold Dragon for the scalp of a Warrior's Son, a Silver Stag for one of a Poor Fellow.

   The uprisings only ended after Maegor died and his nephew, Aenys's son
   Jaehaerys I
   took the throne. Jaehaerys was a very skilled diplomat, and negotiated a peace with the Faith of the Seven, for which he is remembered as Jaehaerys the Conciliator. The compromise he reached was that the

The Faith would also have to accept the laws which forbid holy men to carry weapons, and disband the Faith Militant, but otherwise would be left unmolested by the crown. The Faith's leaders accepted, and peace was restored. As a result, the Faith Militant has not existed for about 250 years by the time of the

   A slight difference with the Faith Militant's revival is that in the TV series, Cersei suggests it to the High Sparrow (and even
   <i key="b27bf849-0139-4109-8d8a-475eb79f45ba">

   the High Sparrow the new High Septon) as a political bribe, thinking the new Faith Militant would therefore be loyal to her. In the novels, the Sparrows stormed the election held by the
   Most Devout
   and forced them to elect the High Sparrow as the new High Septon. Further, while the crown owed House Lannister about three million

   and about two million Gold Dragons to the

   </a>
   , House Tyrell and several Tyroshi trading cartels (together) - it owed nearly one million Gold Dragons to the Faith of the Seven, which it has also heavily borrowed from. The High Sparrow refuses to acknowledge Tommen and denies Cersei's request that the Faith simply forgive the massive debts the crown owes them - but says that he will give in to her requests on the condition that the crown grant him the right to reform the Faith Militant. Thus in the TV series reforming the Faith Militant was Cersei's idea (knowing the High Sparrow would be tempted by the offer), while in the novels it was the High Sparrow's idea. Either way, even in the novels, Cersei's decision to
   <i key="9e4c0efc-81b2-44ef-9aae-bf81335a0665">
    accept
   </i>
   such an outlandish request is seen as absurd. She thinks she can handle the Faith Militant and doesn't understand that having the debts to the Faith forgiven in exchange for letting them have their own army is just trading one problem for another. Accepting the request to rearm the Faith Militant is also the specific point at which even

   The Blu-ray commentaries explained that this change - Cersei herself coming up with the idea to re-arm the Faith Militant - was made to make her complicity in her own downfall all the more apparent. It was a bit too convoluted to quickly convey on-screen that

   a request to re-arm the Faith Militant was absurd, and several other terrible decisions Cersei made at this point in the novels were also cut (outright insulting the representative of the Iron Bank and refusing to pay off the loans, using the

   she took from the Faith to re-build the
   Royal Fleet
   at kingdom-beggaring cost, etc.). Thus the writers wanted to make the main thematic point clear that no single outside group managed to bring Cersei down: more than anything else, her downfall was due to her own staggering inability to rule effectively.
