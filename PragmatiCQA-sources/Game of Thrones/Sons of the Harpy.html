   Tyrion, his advisors, and the representatives of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis enter into negotiations at the Great Pyramid in Meereen. They reach a compromise agreement that will see slavery in Slaver's Bay phased out over a seven-year period and all slave masters compensated.

   As a result, peace returns to Meereen. However, the three slave-trading cities break their peace treaty and attack Meereen, bombarding the city. This attack coincides with the return of Daenerys on her dragon

   novels, the Sons of the Harpy are also a resistance movement of
   Ghiscari
   citizens with ties to the
   Great Masters
   and the aristocratic slaver families of Meereen. They target freedmen,

    Unsullied
   </a>
   , and "shavepates" - Meereenese that have accepted the rule of Daenerys Targaryen and have shaved off their ostentatious Ghiscari hairdos as a sign they have abandoned the customs of the 'old' Meereen. They are not described wearing masks; in fact, they are never even seen in the books by the POV characters.
  </p>
  <p key="f8515225-dfe7-4812-a762-f1933809ea9c">
   Their membership seems to be drawn from those who benefited from the old regime, particularly the old aristocratic families of the Great Masters, but Daenerys cannot confirm which former slave-master families are supporting the Sons of the Harpy and which ones are not. She strongly suspects the
   House of Pahl
   , among others, but the main problem is not even knowing who they are: as an insurgency, they are conducting a "shadow war" in the alleys of Meereen, ambushing Daenerys's soldiers and loyalists, as well as freedmen, when they are alone or in small groups, then fleeing back into the night to avoid retaliation. Whenever they kill, they leave their mark near the murder scene - not a mask but a harpy drawn in the blood of their victims. Daenerys's loyalists have not managed to capture or kill even one of them.
  </p>
  <p key="8432e464-d713-40dd-a5c7-dcaa8d39fce2">
   At first, the Sons of the Harpy limited their attacks to unarmed freedmen, cutting them down in the streets or breaking into their homes under the cover of darkness to murder them in their beds. Later they have grown bold and moved to kill Daenerys's soldiers, starting with
   Stalwart Shield
   .

  <p key="1725a0fa-e6da-46ba-a4cd-adb5ea0ebe0d">
   The Brazen Beasts have taken dozens of the Harpy’s Sons, and those who have survived their capture have yielded names when questioned sharply, but the identity of their leader remains unknown.
  </p>

   </li>
   <li key="3ffeec56-91e3-45a5-859e-ad86e324e579">
    Three freedwomen weavers who made a beautiful tapestry for Daenerys. The Sons of the Harpy broke their loom and raped them before slitting their throats. It is implied they were the former slaves of Grazdan zo Galare, who had petitioned Daenerys for compensation from some of his former slaves who had opened their own weaving shop, using skills learned during their time as his slaves under the tutelage of a late slave.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="79ba245f-7106-4cae-90cb-f695fedf6880">
   Unlike in the show, the Sons of the Harpy never act in broad daylight. So far in the books, Grey Worm and Barristan Selmy have never had an encounter with them.

  <p key="16883366-12c7-4528-a53a-f78784666b28">
   Although it has not been proven conclusively, there are strong circumstantial evidence that indicate Hizdahr is in league with the Sons of the Harpy, maybe even their leader:

  <ul key="66e58059-497f-4bb9-b199-372070368dff">

   </li>
   <li key="e99044af-0d3f-4378-8cb1-362e4446aeb4">
    While watching the pit fighters, he offers Daenerys honeyed locusts. Later it is revealed the locusts were poisoned. Luckily, Daenerys did not eat any. Strong Belwas ate a lot and nearly died as a result.

    He acts rather meekly when provoked by the Yunkai Wise Masters and the leaders of the mercenary companies they hired.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="e06bcf48-3262-43bc-bc24-18cf041ef3d0">
   Following Daenerys's departure, Ser Barristan Selmy is convinced of Hizdahr's guilt and has him thrown to jail. Soon afterwards, the Sons of the Harpy renew their attacks, claiming many more victims than before (twenty-nine in one night) - which strengthens the suspicion against Hizdahr. They have not only left their mark near the bodies, but also messages like
   <i key="d2cfce28-8987-4528-b2a1-dc3e172d7d1d">
    "Dragons must die",

   .
  </p>
  <p key="236fcbc1-3349-4f33-b98e-7f4eaf3fb6a7">
   At the point the novels reached, the Sons of the Harpy have not been stopped yet, not even slowed down. Ser Barristan and others who remain loyal to Daenerys form a council to rule Meereen till she returns, but they do not have time to take care of the Sons of the Harpy due to much more urgent matters: Yunkai is leading a new alliance of slaver-powers to besiege the city.

   The Sons of the Harpy seem vaguely similar to the
   , a Jewish splinter group that formed one of the world's earliest assassination units. During the Roman occupation of Judea (modern-day Israel and the Holy Land) in the first century C.E., the Sicarii operated in much the same way the Sons of the Harpy did under Daenerys's rule; committing hit-and-run killings against both the Roman oppressors and local inhabitants who sided with them, and then quickly slipping away to avoid capture.
  </p>
  <p key="1d154831-23e2-400b-8866-802d83f096ce">
   The political goals of the Sons of the Harpy, as a group opposed to the abolition of slavery carrying out acts of terror against former slaves, are reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan.
