   However, Stannis also cut off the four fingertips at the knuckles from Davos's right hand (as Davos is left-handed) as punishment for his past smuggling crimes. Thieves in Westeros are often sentenced to having fingers or the whole hand removed, but Stannis only took the fingertips of his non-dominant hand. Davos submitted to this punishment willingly, judging it a fair exchange in return for improving his family's future prospects. He also mentions in a featurette that he submitted to the punishment for the sake of sheer justice, saying he "avoided punishment for too long" and that this was the first instance he had ever seen of true justice being served. He wears his severed finger bones in a pouch around his neck and believes they bring him good luck.

   He chose the name "Seaworth" for his family's new noble House, as a reference to his smuggling past. Highborn members of older noble Houses disparagingly called Davos "the Onion Knight" for his actions, but he has embraced this title and proudly took an onion on the sail of a black ship for a sigil and sewed the onion onto his ship's sails.

   Davos is one of Stannis's most loyal and reliable vassals and arguably his best friend, but is treated with disdain by some of the other lords of Westeros for his low birth. Stannis himself points out that it was the low-born Davos, and not the high-born lords, who saved the lives of Stannis and his castle garrison. Davos is one of the only men who can (even grudgingly) influence Stannis's decisions, because he values Davos's honest advice above that of noble-born flatterers.
   Davos has several sons, including
   Matthos
   , who serves with him on
   his ship
   and is a scribe for Stannis.
   He is proud of his son's education but remains illiterate.

Stannis subsequently sends Davos to Castle Black to plead with Jon to send some men and supplies, promising Jon enough men to man all nineteen castles of the Wall in return, on the basis that as Davos is Hand of the King, Jon will take more notice of him than a common messenger. He is reluctant, on the basis that as Stannis's Hand he cannot abandon his King, but he is convinced to go when reminded he is following his king's command.

   Davos Seaworth is very loyal to his king. He is considered to be the closest friend that

    Stannis Baratheon

   ever had, which is impressive enough because Stannis had few friends due to his pitiless and cold personality. Davos's sense of personal loyalty has also, ironically enough, put him at odds with Stannis, especially when

    Melisandre
   </a>
   was concerned - Davos openly mistrusted, and ultimately hated the Red Woman, but also feared that Melisandre would corrupt Stannis with her prophecies and promises of greatness. Stannis admitted to Davos that he admired the man for his loyal nature, and how unfazed he is by other men's perceptions of him - this coming from

   is extremely impressive, as few people could boast such a thing. Davos is also a very dedicated man in his own right, originally opting to ensure that his son
   Matthos
   had a better life than he did, since Davos grew up in absolute poverty in
   <a href="King's Landing.html" key="ec16ea2c-c49b-4b26-9484-a02e1712bfb7" title="King's Landing">

   </a>
   , using their aligning poverty in
   Flea Bottom
   as a way of gaining the young man's trust. It is almost hopelessly ironic that Davos's good nature and compassion is met with outrage or controversy by anybody else.
  </p>
  <p key="f1176128-5319-46ab-9320-cdab4ca8988f">
   Davos has no prejudice towards followers of another religion (which he himself expresses to Melisandre) but he believes that the
   <a href="R'hllor.html" key="3adb322b-26ec-4db0-b794-3b0d16fbfdc9" title="R'hllor">
    Lord of Light
   </a>
   himself is evil on the basis that his favor requires followers to burn people alive at the stake. He is shown to be rather frightened of the powers that Melisandre possesses, as shown when he witnesses her create a shadow to kill
   <a href="Renly Baratheon.html" key="df300ffa-1d39-4a14-871a-3bfb5ebe8b3b" title="Renly Baratheon">

   </a>
   . It is unfortunate that his warnings against Stannis utilizing Melisandre and her powers to achieve his goals fell on deaf ears, since doing so would have meant avoiding an untold amount of destruction (which ironically is the reason that Melisandre used to persuade Stannis to keep her as an ally). Davos is a very practical man, understanding entirely that men and arms and territory win wars, not the hopeful prayers to some fire god. His suggestions to hire sellsword companies to Stannis's cause may have been met with incredulity by Stannis himself, but it would have been a potentially effective move.
  </p>
  <p key="e0e8ed09-8d51-47e2-a04c-f55fbefe07a9">
   Davos had a very close relationship with Stannis's daughter and only child, Princess
   <a href="Shireen Baratheon.html" key="57e66f00-dd3e-4962-8760-3a18102a1bdb" title="Shireen Baratheon">
    Shireen Baratheon
   </a>
   , and was not at all bothered or intimidated by her disfigurement, which is impressive among most men. Davos was close enough with Shireen that she was the person who taught him how to read, and she openly didn't care that Davos was considered a traitor by Stannis and Melisandre because Davos was her friend. Davos even jokingly remarked that he saw similarities between father and daughter, demonstrating that he was almost as close with her as he was with Stannis. This friendship would become a tragic blow to Davos later on when he realized that Melisandre had Shireen burned at the stake to win favor with her precious Lord of Light - he exploded with rage against Melisandre upon hearing her confess and insists that Shireen's sacrifice was completely futile, since it achieved absolutely nothing in the end. Even after

    Jon Snow
   </a>
   decided to banish the Red Woman on pain of death, Davos coldly threatened to execute Melisandre himself if they ever saw each other again, which is a massive departure from Davos's usual nature. To Davos' credit, in his wroth, he still asked Jon's leave to execute Melisandre for murder, emphasising that she'd admitted to the crime, showing that he wasn't as barbaric as other men (also showing his respect and fealty to Jon).
  </p>
  <p key="5442a8d9-e82f-42dc-aa9b-c7ff0201dc8f">
   Davos is unfazed by the condescension he has received from other high lords in

    Westeros
   </a>
   for his common nature, which Stannis commended, expressing more contempt for such lords than Davos himself ever did. Davos was, in a way, of better service to Stannis or whomever he served than any other lord, considering the fact that he was unfailingly loyal to both Stannis, and later Jon Snow. He was not bothered by bastardy or by a person's disfigurements or social shortcomings, as evidenced by his relationship with Shireen and Jon. He is perfectly willing to stand astride the Free Folk after they come south of the Wall, even though he had been fighting against them not so long ago - he developed a good relationship with Tormund, as shown by their exchanging banter the night before facing Ramsay Bolton.

  <p key="2bde23ad-4465-4b63-860b-547dfed69d10">

   . After Jon returned from death, Davos was the first man to greet him and firmly encouraged him to carry on fighting, since there were more important things to dwell on than the purpose of Jon's return. This makes Davos a precious and valuable advisor to whoever he serves. Davos's skills in diplomacy and statecraft were acknowledged by Tyrion, who encouraged King

  <p key="fc3d495a-76ea-4ee7-af6e-df8f4dfe7496">
   Davos also displays a forgiving nature, or at least does not harbor any kind of resentment towards people who could deserve it. He does not blame Stannis for cutting his fingers after he smuggled supplies during the
   Siege of Storm's End
   , nor does he formally blame

   explosion which killed his son Matthos during the Battle of the Blackwater (he casually relays this to Tyrion when smuggling him into King's Landing but without a tone of reproach). The only exception known to Davos's forgiving nature is Melisandre, who Davos swore to execute should their paths meet again. Thus, Melisandre is the only person in Westeros that Davos irreparably, truly hates. However, after he witnesses Melisandre’s choice of death in the aftermath of the

   In sharp contrast to Ned Stark, Davos has a flexible personality: he knows that sometimes it is necessary to compromise one's principles and to break the law - a lesson that Ned stubbornly refused to understand until it was too late. For example: by releasing Gendry, Davos knew he was committing a treason and that might cost his life, but he did it anyway because he knew it was the right thing to do; eventually, Davos's unlawful act saved not only Gendry, but also many more lives (the defenders of Castle Black).
