   sword and Tywin tells him that it is one of two swords of its kind in the capital, and Joffrey rushes to wield it. He promptly begins to slash at Tyrion's gift despite its rarity, and then asks for suggestions on its name from guests in attendance. He settles on the name
   Widow's Wail
   .

   After the breakfast, Tyrion is visited in his chambers by Shae and he informs her that there is a ship waiting for her bound for

   and that their "friendship" is at an end. Realizing that Shae will defiantly refuse to flee in the face of danger, he concludes the only way to convince her to leave King’s Landing and save herself is to brutally reject her. So he tells her, at enormous pain to himself as well as to her, that she is only a whore and he cannot love her.  
When Bronn enters and tries to escort her away, she slaps him and runs out, furious and broken-hearted. When Tyrion later asks Bronn if she is gone, he confirms that she boarded the ship. When Tyrion asks if he saw it sail away, Bronn assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her, that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and Varys. He then advises Tyrion to go and drink until it feels like he did the right thing.

Loras leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover Renly (riding a mount resembling Loras), and Sansa looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother Robb is killed after having his wolf's head knocked off. Joffrey expresses his delight with the play and prepares to give the
   champion dwarf
   a purse but then mockingly suggests that Tyrion fight him as well. Tyrion cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that Joffrey should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the

   , cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is "clearly mad with lust" and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night. This draws a few stifled chuckles from their guests. Enraged and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his wedding guests, Joffrey petulantly pours wine over Tyrion's head and orders him to serve him wine as his
   cupbearer
   .

   Tyrion approaches Joffrey, who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table. Sansa hands the goblet to Tyrion, and he fills it with wine and hands it back to Joffrey. The king demands that Tyrion kneel before him but Tyrion refuses. Margaery interrupts the tense moment and says it is time to cut the
   pigeon pie
   . Joffrey hands the goblet to Margaery, who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother Olenna. Joffrey draws his new sword, cuts the pie, and several white doves fly out.
Sansa and Tyrion attempt to leave the feast, while Margaery serves Joffrey a piece of pie. Joffrey commands Tyrion to serve him wine to wash down the pie. Tyrion hands the goblet to Joffrey and he quickly drinks all of it. Joffrey tries to speak, but begins coughing. He grabs his throat, and Margaery and Olenna exclaim that he is choking and needs help.

Joffrey points an accusatory finger in Tyrion's direction, as he examines the wine goblet (though it is not made clear if Joffrey is accusing Tyrion or merely the wine). Joffrey's eyes turn red, blood runs from his nose, he stops convulsing, and dies. Cersei sobs with grief and orders the Kingsguard to seize Tyrion for the poisoning of her son.

He chastises Ramsay for instead flaying and castrating Theon, making him useless as a political hostage because now Balon has given him up for dead, given that he can no longer further the Greyjoy line.

    he tried to negotiate (indeed, his first message to Balon was to send him Theon's severed genitals in a box), and the main reason he was a valuable hostage to begin with was because he was (formerly) capable of furthering Balon's bloodline. This basic logic seems to have escaped Ramsay - who often tortures or kills defeated enemies without thinking of the repercussions.

    Podrick directly asks Jaime if his new prosthetic hand is made of solid gold, and is told that it is actually gold-plated steel. In the books, Jaime's prosthetic hand is indeed made out of solid gold. One of the reasons it was made out of solid gold was because gold is so much heavier than steel, so the muscles of Jaime's right arm would still get sufficient exercise, instead of atrophying from lack of use. Also due to the great weight of solid gold, Jaime discovers that it makes quite an effective bludgeoning weapon. However, steel is still heavy enough for such purposes, while being much tougher than gold, making it also able to defend against blades for example.

    Benioff and Weiss have stated that they wanted to have the dwarf actors riding pigs in their mock-joust, as described in the novels, but ultimately could not.

    It was actually costume designer
    Michele Clapton
    who came up with the idea that the dwarf playing Renly in Joffrey's mock-joust would be riding a puppet of Loras instead of a puppet horse. When she showed her original designs (which didn't include a stylized mount) they liked them, but said that the dwarf-Renly wasn't distinct enough and asked her to think up something more Renly-specific (and reflecting what a crass sense of humor Joffrey has).
    In turn this costuming decision may have affected the actual script, as it's not clear if Loras was meant to leave in disgust in earlier drafts of the episode.

    A few lines from the exchange between Cersei Lannister and Ellaria Sand appeared in the "Bastards of Westeros" video featurette which were ultimately cut from the finished episode. In the final version, after Cersei says "I can't say I've ever met a Sand before", Ellaria coldly responds, "We are everywhere in Dorne, I have ten thousand brothers and sisters". In the intervening cut lines, apparently after Cersei says she's never met a Sand before, she continues, "I'm not quite sure what to call you", to which Ellaria retorts, "...'Ellaria' works for everyone else." This is apparently followed by Ellaria's line that Sands (acknowledged bastards) are everywhere in Dorne. These brief lines weren't included in the official "deleted scenes" in the Season 4 Blu-ray set, though the "Bastards of Westeros" featurette is included in it, as well as being publicly posted by HBO's Youtube account.

    During Jaime's (possibly well-meaning) warning to Loras that if he marries Cersei she will soon have him assassinated, he also warns that if he manages to impregnate Cersei she will kill the child too, "long before it draws its first breath". This may be a reference to that in the books, the one time Cersei actually became pregnant by King Robert, she secretly had an abortion rather than have his child. The TV series changed this with comments in Season 1 that Cersei actually

    have a child with Robert during their first year of marriage (when she briefly thought their marriage might work out), but he died of a fever soon after birth. This doesn't necessarily preclude the possibility that in the TV continuity, Cersei became pregnant by Robert again at a later point, and then secretly had an abortion.

    The sounds of Joffrey choking at the end of the episode were mostly replaced by mixing different sound effects (because it would have been impossible for the actor to sound like he was choking, unless he was actually choking). While it takes about 30 seconds of screentime for Joffrey to choke to death, the sound effects editing took around six to eight hours. Some animal sounds were used, as well as a recording of a woman impersonating a choking baby. The last wheezing gasp that escapes from Joffrey as he finally dies was supplied by co-producer

    In the Blu-ray commentary, it is stated that the visual style of Bran's visions when he tries to warg with a weirwood tree (a quick flashing montage) was directly inspired by the style of the Devil's Tower visions in Stephen Spielberg's

    When Joffrey uses his new Valyrian steel sword to hack Tyrion's gift of a rare book to pieces, an air blower was put within the book prop in order to make the cut papers from the book shoot into the air convincingly.

    Olenna removes one of the crystals from Sansa's necklace when she fingers it, but Dianna Rigg wasn't supposed to rip the piece off herself (as it might break in an unexpected way). The plan was for the production crew to switch out the necklace in the next shot, however they forgot to, and they only realized when viewing the footage that the missing necklace crystal (which is a vital plot clue) was still in the final shot. The missing crystal had to be digitally removed in post-production.

    When Joffrey demands that Tyrion bring him his cup of wine, he scoffs that he should hurry up because "this pie is dry!" Lena Headey (Cersei) and Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) thought the line sounded so much like a sex double-entendre that they couldn't keep a straight face when they heard it no matter how hard they tried, and kept bursting out laughing, causing significant delays in the filming schedule.

    For the shot in which doves fly out of the oversized wedding pie, an air cannon was rigged inside to make a

    gush of air, to encourage the flock of doves to fly. The first time they used the air cannon it as too powerful, frightening the doves so they all flew out in one direction, clumping together instead of the more natural flock-in-flight they needed for the shot. The scene was then refilmed with the air cannon put on a lower setting.

    Ironically, Olenna consoles Sansa for Robb's death, commenting "Killing a man at a wedding? Horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing?" - and a few moments later, she performs exactly the same act.
