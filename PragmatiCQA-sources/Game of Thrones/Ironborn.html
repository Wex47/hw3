   The modern ironborn are an intermingling of the blood of the original
   First Men
   settlers of the islands and the
   Andals
   who
   <a href="Andal Invasion.html" key="9bbcd108-a57b-421d-871f-c0b261c28a86" title="Andal Invasion">
    followed
   </a>
   six thousand years later. While the Andals and the
   <a href="Faith of the Seven.html" key="038379a1-b0b7-41da-8985-2972893c63a5" title="Faith of the Seven">
    Faith of the Seven
   </a>
   came to dominate everywhere else below the
   Neck
   , they found less purchase on the Islands. While a few converts to the Faith of the Seven may be found there even in the present day, most of the Andal invaders converted to the native deity, the
   <a href="Drowned God.html" key="150c67ce-b627-4626-bb32-ce4738750650" title="Drowned God">

   , instead. The Andal invaders completely acculturated to the distinct "ironborn" culture, and their invasion had relatively little impact upon the Iron Islands. Thus the ironborn are ethnically composed of the same First Men/Andal mix as most of the rest of Westeros: they are culturally, not ethnically distinct.
  </p>
  <p key="eaa2fa9b-ec7e-4268-8c7f-b488903734af">
   One of the few notable changes was that the ironborn switched to speaking the

   has frequently compared the ironborn to Vikings from the real-life Middle Ages. Given the analogy that the entire continent of Westeros is supposed to be an oversized version of the British Isles, the ironborn also loosely correspond to Celtic raiders from medieval Ireland, as well as raiders from other outer islands in the group (the Isle of Man, the Orkneys, the Shetlands, etc.). Of course, at various points in history, the Vikings established permanent raiding bases in Ireland and the outer isles, so often these raids were from Vikings who
   <i key="89e0029a-b0be-4fd9-832c-74e977b65743">
    lived
   </i>
   in Ireland.
  </p>
  <p key="069cfb73-6498-4cf7-8a1e-da19b4bfcf63">
   In the books, the ironborn are also called "ironmen" interchangeably, but never "iron islanders".
  </p>
  <p key="ed8fa2e2-d308-40c9-b966-f9f44e0dfe3e">
   It is forbidden for ironborn to kill other ironborn in such manner than spills blood; killing without spilling blood, like by drowning, is tolerable. Kinslaying, with or without spilling blood is forbidden: Euron, who murdered Balon and two more of his brothers, never admitted any of those killings in public (in the show he does admit openly killing Balon).

   As a part of the Old Way, there are no slaves in the Iron Islands, only thralls. It is not semantics: a thrall is bound to service, but he is not a chattel. His children are born free, so long as they are given to the Drowned God. Thralls are never bought nor sold for gold. A man pays the iron price for thralls, or else has none. Soon after Euron is crowned, he issues a royal decree which allows to sell captives as slaves, thus violating the Old Way.
  </p>
  <p key="a64b2f5b-234d-4db0-95de-68b51293849f">
   As a part of the Old Way, ironborn prefer hand-to-hand combat, using swords or axes; only on rare occasions (harrying of the
   Stony Shore
   ) they shoot arrows at their opponents. They do not besiege castles in order to starve their enemies out, nor do they use any siege machines, because in their eyes there is no glory in such fighting methods.
  </p>
  <p key="82ae7820-90f9-4d84-a1b3-84e342a0ac1e">
   Illiteracy is common among the ironborn, perhaps because they believe physical force is enough to obtain what they want, and do not bother to produce anything of their own, as the motto of House Greyjoy implies. When Theon arrives at Moat Cailin, he urges the ironborn to read the message from Ramsay, although he is almost certain that none of them can read. Rodrik Harlaw (Balon's brother-in-law) is known as "the Reader" for his passion for books, which is regarded by most ironborn as somewhat strange, as they consider reading to be an unmanly habit (though Rodrik is actually a strong warrior, he just thinks history books are interesting).
  </p>
  <p key="eeb025d9-c0ca-4699-b47d-5da839cf665a">
   The Iron Islands are too sparse and rocky for breeding good horses. Most of the ironborn are indifferent riders at best, more comfortable on the deck of a longship than in the saddle. Even the lords ride garrons or shaggy Harlaw ponies, and ox carts are more common than drays. The smallfolk who are too poor to own either one, pull their own plows through the thin, stony soil.
  </p>
  <p key="70f8f6e9-a120-4c63-abe1-ff735d605f70">
   The ironborn prefer to fight from decks of ships. At battles which take place on the mainland, the ironborn mostly fight as an infantry; since they lack the discipline to stand a charge of an armored horse, they may find themselves at a disadvantage if their opponents are cavalrymen.
