   Daenerys's war for Westeros left much of the Seven Kingdoms devastated. Dorne and the Reach descended into chaos for a brief period of time, while countless people were killed by Daenerys's dragons, including Lannister and Tarly soldiers at the Battle of the Goldroad and innocent civilians at the Battle of King's Landing. This wide-scale death and destruction led to Daenerys's assassination and the legal extinction of House Targaryen, though the Targaryen bloodline continues to live on in Jon as the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.
  </p>
  <p key="4ecdbc46-3476-405a-9ff6-1e066c602144">
   While the war destabilized and weakened the realm, the fallout from the conflict allowed the remaining leaders of Westeros to peacefully negotiate a resolution, preventing any further civil war for the time being. The Iron Throne was permanently destroyed, and Tyrion declared that the King was to be chosen from
   Great Councils
   rather than through bloodline and inheritance. Daenerys's followers left Westeros without any further bloodshed, while Sansa's request for the independence of the North was granted. Upon this, the Seven Kingdoms are reorganized into the Six Kingdoms. This smooth transition of power allows the Westerosi to rebuild their country and introduces the idea of election based on merit at a larger scale in Westeros. In some ways, this fulfills the legacies of Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon, and Varys with her desires to "break the wheel" that allowed the few, powerful noblemen to prey on the many smallfolk.

   Daenerys personally commands a legion of Unsullied heavy infantry (just under 8,000 strong) and hordes of Dothraki light cavalry (just under 100,000), giving her easily the largest army in the entire conflict. House Tyrell and the Dornish, who act in alliance with her and her advisers directly, can field further ground troops (from both the Tyrell army and the Dornish militias) and provide naval support (in the form of the Tyrell-aligned
   Redwyne Fleet
   ). Her greatest military asset is her three dragons, making Daenerys the only person in the entire known world capable of launching an aerial assault on her enemies. However, Daenerys has suffered a series of defeats, between the assault on the Targaryen fleet, the fall of Casterly Rock and the sack of Highgarden. This results in Daenerys losing many of her Westerosi allies, as well as the detachment of her fleet that transported her Unsullied troops to Casterly Rock, who have taken moderate casualties and are stranded at Casterly Rock. Impatient with the cautious plans that Tyrion had advised her to follow, but still unwilling to harm civilians by burning cities, Daenerys forms a plan of her own and wins a decisive field victory at the Battle of the Goldroad. Following the battle, the surviving Westerosi soldiers bend the knee to Daenerys, increasing her forces. In the aftermath, she reluctantly agrees to negotiate an armistice with House Lannister in order to keep her gains while dealing with the oncoming threat of the army of the dead. Later, Jon eventually bends the knee to Daenerys and they fall in love; by extension, she is also allied with the Vale of Arryn, which has pledged to support the Starks in the Great War.

   Having accepted a marriage agreement from Euron, Cersei acquires over 1,000 Greyjoy ships to serve as her royal fleet. Using the gold plundered from Highgarden, and immediately after making an armistice with Daenerys, Cersei secretly orders Euron to sail to Essos and ferry over the Golden Company, putting 18,000 mercenary infantry and 2,000 cavalry, at her disposal. While she is still badly outnumbered, Cersei intends to use the Golden Company to mop up the remains of whoever wins the Great War – either the Targaryen-North alliance or the army of the dead – and finally reign unopposed. This devious move, however, has cost her Jaime, her greatest supporter and commander of her forces, as he leaves King's Landing to honor his oath to fight the army of the dead. Currently, although none of the southern kingdoms has the strength to fight her (except the Vale of Arryn and possibly Dorne), she only occupies the Crownlands, the Westerlands, and fragments of the Riverlands and Stormlands. However, with the conclusion of the Great War resulting in a victory for the living, Cersei is in a much better position, as not only has the entire army of the dead been eradicated, but the forces of House Targaryen and Stark have suffered severe losses as a result.

   Euron commands the freshly rebuilt Iron Fleet, crewed by Houses loyal to him. The new fleet is visually impressive and apparently more than a match for any other fleet in the world; he proves his prowess when he strikes a first blow against the Targaryen alliance, destroying the majority of his niece's fleet and captures Yara, as well as Ellaria and Tyene Sand, essentially stripping Daenerys of two of her Westerosi allies. He then ambushes the remainder of the Targaryen fleet at the Fall of Casterly Rock, destroying the armada and stranding the Unsullied.

   However, Euron's position has been substantially weakened with Theon's liberation of Yara, who has sailed back to the undefended Iron Islands with her remaining men to take them back from Euron, thus possibly costing Euron his seat. However, he still has a numerical superiority over Yara's remaining forces, and with Theon's death in the Great War, now has one less threat to his rule.

It is also somewhat hinted that Euron has truly gone insane and is in service to some sort of dark demonic powers (either the White Walkers or
   those beneath the depths

   Littlefinger hasn't mentioned Stannis in his plans yet, or how his sudden appearance in the North may alter any of his plans. Stannis loathes Littlefinger, and accurately suspected for years during Robert's reign that Littlefinger was a traitor. Stannis may kill Littlefinger if they ever came into contact again rather than ally with him.

   For the moment, Littlefinger is strengthening his grip over the lords of the Vale, bribing off old aristocratic families who are deeply in debt (apparently with massive amounts of money he embezzled from the Iron Throne). His entry into the war still seems some way off, so he is focusing on the first step in his plan: his alleged bastard daughter "Alayne" (Sansa) winning over and betrothing Harold Hardyng.

     Second War of Conquest
    </b>
    ": as the War of Conquest consisted of Aegon Targaryen invading and unifying the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros into one Realm (even though Dorne joined two centuries later), this name assumes that it will happen again, while the Seven Kingdoms are still essentially the same Realm that Aegon created, and most factions follow the monarch who will sit on the Iron Throne, except the North and the Vale, who follow the King in the North. This name would only be applicable if Daenerys wins and unifies all Seven Kingdoms under the Iron Throne again.
