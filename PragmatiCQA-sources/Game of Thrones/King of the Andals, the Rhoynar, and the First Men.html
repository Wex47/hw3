   Histories &amp; Lore
   featurettes. Though generally assumed to follow the book series, the genealogy of all kings has not technically been established in the TV continuity. One major difference to the line of kings in the book series is the removal of Jaehaerys II Targaryen, who in the book series is the son and successor of Aegon V and the father and predecessor of Aerys II. The removal is intentional, possibly made to simplify the Targaryen family tree as Aemon relates his genealogical connection to the rest of the Targaryens to Jon Snow in Season 1.

   Though it would contradict the books, there is technically "room" for further kings in the sequence of rulers in the TV continuity. As stated, the relative order of the kings mentioned above is known and matches the books, but as opposed to the books, the regnal dates for most kings have not been mentioned. Though the relations of some are known (Aegon I is mentioned to be Aenys I's and Maegor I's father, Aegon IV is mentioned to be the son of Viserys II and the father of Daeron II, who in turn is mentioned to be the father of Aerys I and Maekar I, and the succession Maekar I - Aegon V - Aerys II is explicitly confirmed), for many it is currently left unclear whether their genealogy matches the books or not. For instance, Maegor I is mentioned as having been succeeded by his nephew in "
   Maegor the Cruel

   ", with no indication as to when he reigned or who he succeeded. Though they are known to have reigned in the same order relative to each other as in the books, the successions from Jaehaerys I to Viserys I, Aegon III to Daeron I, Daeron I to Baelor I, and Baelor I to Viserys II, and the genealogies of these kings relative to each other, are never explicitly confirmed in TV continuity material, meaning that the insertion of additional kings is possible while still maintaining internal consistency.

   It would appear that the TV series initially chose to continue using the shortened title "King of the Andals and the First Men" because it is what they had been using for three seasons, and they wished to remain internally consistent (the other option was to suddenly start using the full title without explanation, introducing a rather large retcon that this is what they

   This isn't necessarily an inexplicable situation within the TV-continuity itself: Dorne was actually independent from the Targaryen realm for two centuries, and when they entered united with the Iron Throne they were allowed special privileges (such as maintaining their own equal primogeniture system, and even styling their ruling family as "
   Princes of Dorne
   ", not "
   Lord Paramount
   of Dorne". Thus it is possible that, in the TV continuity, the Targaryen kings simply never referred to themselves as Kings "of the Rhoynar" as well, even after the marriage-alliance (but still as "Lord of the Seven Kingdoms"), to acknowledge the fact that Dorne is still "ruled" by its own Princes, even if it is now subject to the Iron Throne (further acknowledging that Dorne is essentially a
   semi-autonomous region
   of the Seven Kingdoms). It might have been one of the conditions of the marriage-alliance in the TV continuity.

Aegon I had declared himself king of all of Westeros just before his army even landed on the continent, Dorne included. While Dorne had been able to resist his armies and dragons through guerrilla warfare, Aegon himself never acknowledged that this was a permanent state of affairs.

   </i>
   control over it (comparable to how medieval English kings would at times hold titles of lordship over "Wales", "Ireland", and "France", despite not controlling all or even most of these territories). At no point (as readers sometimes have assumed) did Aegon ever "promote" the

   when he invaded and not an independent "kingdom", instead making up the "eighth" kingdom of sorts). Dorne was always the seventh of the "Seven Kingdoms", the Targaryens just refused to ever officially acknowledge that they did not actually control it - in the novels' continuity. In the TV continuity, therefore, the Targaryen kings may have just acknowledged for the first two centuries of their dynasty that they didn't actually rule the Rhoynar people in Dorne, and that one of the special privileges of Dorne uniting with the Iron Throne through marriage-alliance one century ago is that the Targaryens didn't suddenly add "King of the Rhoynar" to their title.

The title was also consistently given as "King of the Andals and the First Men" throughout Season 5, omitting the Rhoynar. The single use of the full book version of the title in the Season 4 finale therefore simply appears to be a script error and not canonical.

The TV writers could have retained the original version which omitted "of the Rhoynar", or they could have initiated a retcon by adding in "of the Rhoynar" from Season 4 onward: instead they inconsistently flip-flopped between the two forms. It is possible that the two terms are simply interchangeable.

  </h3>
  <p key="bde20ffc-3b60-4dbf-bb77-b806ec847dd9">
   In the three hundred years between the Targaryen Conquest and the War of the Five Kings, there has never been a ruling queen: a female heir of the current monarch inheriting power in her own right. The first four Targaryen kings all had male heirs who were also their eldest child. However the fifth Targaryen king, Viserys I, only had one surviving child by his first wife before she died, a daughter named
   Rhaenyra Targaryen
   . With no other heirs, Viserys I and his court raised Rhaenyra with the expectation that she would be the first ruling queen. However, Viserys I remarried late in life, and had several sons with his second wife, the eldest of which was his son Aegon II.
  </p>
  <p key="b0b9dcdf-efe7-4fd7-91d9-f1c4c84acc1c">
   When Viserys I died this sparked a succession war between Rhaenyra and Aegon II, known as the Dance of Dragons, which raged from 129 to 131 AC (about 170 years before the War of the Five Kings). Aegon II ultimately had Rhaenyra fed alive to his dragon, but her supporters continued to fight in the name of her children, and not long afterwards Aegon II himself died childless. As the only remaining heir of Viserys I or Aegon II, Rhaenyra's own son Aegon III inherited the throne (Aegon III's own sons both died childless, and ultimately Rhaenyra's younger son Viserys II succeeded to the throne).
  </p>
  <p key="dc77efa8-9941-492c-9860-0a0ff66002df">
   After the
   <a href="Dance of the Dragons.html" key="3fd9394f-e291-4c6b-8e4b-2de89ceb61aa" title="Dance of the Dragons">
    Dance of the Dragons
   </a>
   , the Targaryens revised the official royal succession laws to follow an extreme form of male-preference primogeniture, placing female heirs behind all possible male ones, i.e. if all of a king's sons died childless, his own younger brothers would inherit instead of his daughters (their nieces). Such was the case when after both of Aegon III's sons died childless, his daughter Daena was skipped over in succession for Aegon III's younger brother Viserys II. These altered inheritance laws ensured that there was no ruling queen in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Many historians point to the succession of Rhaenyra's son Aegon III after Aegon II died as proof of the legitimacy of Rhaenyra's claim to inheritance in the civil war, and while she lived she did personally use the title of queen. Officially, however, Rhaenyra is considered a rival claimant and is not counted in the formal line of succession. Any possible future ruling queen by the name of "Rhaenyra" would be titled "Rhaenyra I", not "Rhaenyra II". As this would lead to controversy over whether to acknowledge Rhaenyra's claim during the Dance of Dragons, subsequent generations of the Targaryen family simply avoided the issue by never naming any subsequent daughters "Rhaenyra".

   At the end of season 6, where King Tommen Baratheon commits suicide after the destruction of the Sept of Baelor, Cersei Lannister has proclaimed and crowned herself as Queen of the Andals and the First Men. Cersei considered herself the first true ruling queen in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Although Cersei's claim to the Iron Throne was not explored in detail, it may have derived from her being the widow of King Robert I and the mother of Joffrey I and Tommen I, effectively the heir to the Baratheon dynasty seeing as House Baratheon was extinct at the time of her coronation.
