   Waif
   obstructs her path and latches the door. Arya wants to know what happens to the bodies she scrubs clean, but the Waif tells her that she will know when the time is right. Frustrated at the lack of answers, Arya demands to play the game of faces. The Waif tells her that Arya has already tried playing the game but failed. She again asks Arya who she is, to which Arya replies that she is no one. The Waif simply tells Arya to get back to work and is about to walk away when Arya asks her who she is. The Waif tells Arya a story about how she was the only daughter of a widowed Lord, who remarried, producing another daughter. Her stepmother, in order to secure her own daughter’s future, tried to poison her. The Waif found out about this and sought out the help of the Faceless Men to exact her revenge. The Waif then asks Arya whether she believed the story, surprising Arya. When Arya doesn’t respond, embarrassed that she bought the Waif’s story, the Waif tells her to get back to work, hinting to Arya that to pass the game of faces, Arya must be able to lie convincingly. Later, when Arya is asleep,

   comes to test Arya again. This time, when he asks Arya who she is, Arya tells him how she came to join the Faceless Men, trying to slip in a few lies into the story. However, Jaqen is able to tell when Arya is lying and hits her with a switch whenever she does. He strikes her repeatedly when she insists she hated

   and spent every penny he had. He tells her that his daughter is suffering and needs to find peace. Arya sits besides the girl and tells her a short false story, about how she was sick too, but her father brought her here and when she drank from the temple's well, she was healed. This persuades the sickly girl to drink the poisoned water from the well. The water gives the peace of death to the sickly girl, and Arya, having successfully proven that she can lie, is brought to the
   Hall of Faces
   with Jaqen H'ghar, a great underground chamber that houses thousands of faces. All the faces had been taken from the corpses that the acolytes wash in the
   temple
   . The Faceless Man then asks Arya if she is ready to give up who she is to become "no one". After a moment of silence, he then states that she is not ready to become "no one" (she is too attached to her past as a Stark), but that she

   an expedition beyond the Wall
   , but there
   was a mutiny

Cersei contemptuously claims that her uncle doesn’t have the courage to lead an army, while Jaime is away on a “sensitive diplomatic mission.” Baelish proposes that the soldiers of the Vale could fight instead but Cersei is unsure of Baelish’s ability to lead an army. Baelish convinces her, stating that he "lives to serve". All Baelish wants in return is to be named

   after learning of her grandson’s arrest. Olenna tries to talk Cersei into releasing Loras. Cersei sticks to her claim that it was the Faith Militant who arrested Loras and she had nothing to do with it. Olenna warns Cersei that her actions have endangered the Lannister-Tyrell alliance – the very alliance that is supplying the capital with food. Cersei informs Olenna that the
   High Septon
   has called for a preliminary hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit and expresses confidence that Loras will be acquitted.

To support his testimony, Olyvar tells the High Sparrow of a birthmark Loras has that is shaped like Dorne, much to Loras' shock and fury. Deciding that this is more than enough evidence for a holy inquest, the High Sparrow has Loras arrested. Since Margaery bore false witness before the Gods, she is arrested too. As Margaery is forcefully dragged away, she calls out for

   , Reek gives Sansa away to Ramsay (who actually allows Reek to call himself Theon Greyjoy) during the wedding ceremony, which is officiated by Roose Bolton and attended by many Northern Lords. Later when they retreat to the bedroom, Ramsay first interrogates Sansa about her virginity, then orders her to take her clothes off. Reek turns to leave but Ramsay tells him he must stay, taunting him “you grew up with her as a girl, now watch her become a woman." Annoyed by Sansa's hesitancy, Ramsay angrily rips open the back of her dress and pushes her face-down over the side of the bed. As he unbuckles his clothes, Sansa obediently remains still but begins crying softly. Reek is visibly distraught and begins silently crying himself, as Ramsay proceeds to rape her, and forcibly consummate their marriage.

As it so happened, while their match was arranged, both Myrcella and Trystane fell madly in love with each other, proverbial star-crossed lovers from rival Houses. Myrcella has actually been having a rather enjoyable time in Dorne since she was last seen in Season 2.

    simply has no clergy or priesthood whatsoever, explaining why Roose Bolton officiates the ceremony himself (as he did in the novels). In the Faith of the Seven, marriages are officiated by a
    Septon
    or
    Septa
    , such as when Tommen and Margaery married earlier this season. As presented here, the ceremony seems relatively simple, with the bride and groom exchanging brief vows officiated by the groom's father - though it isn't clear if this is a rule, or if Roose happened to be the one to officiate in this instance.

      In the first novel, Sansa is 11 years old, but she was aged-up to be 13 in Season 1 of the TV series. Also,
      time moves more slowly
      in the TV continuity (at the rate of one year per TV season), so that about four years have passed by Season 5 - making Sansa around 17 to 18 years old at this point in the TV series. In the novels, the legal age of majority in Westeros is 16, though girls are often married off younger than this - as Sansa was to Tyrion - if they have
      flowered
      already. The TV series has Samwell Tarly make some comments which imply that the legal age of majority in the TV version was also increased by two years, to 18 years old. The show is constantly unclear on its timelines and ages tend to be muddled as a way for the writers and producers to mitigate whatever controversy may arise from depicting children or teenagers in 'adult' situations.

      A point brought up between Ramsay and Sansa on their wedding night is the status of her virginity - she tells him the truth, that Tyrion was kind and gentle that he wouldn't force her to consummate the marriage (he was disgusted that his father forced him to marry her). TV-first viewers might wonder if Ramsay wouldn't simply be able to tell if Sansa was still a virgin when he had sex with her for the first time, breaking her hymen (called a "maidenhead" in the books). The novels actually give some extra cultural background about this - Cersei around this time ponders making the accusation that Margaery isn't a virgin anymore, but realizes this would be impossible to prove: because girls from noble families in Westeros spend so much time riding
      horses
      for basic transport, almost none of them have intact hymens by the time they marry. The husbands of noble-born girls usually just have to take them at their word that they are virgins.

      Stephanie Blacker
      became pregnant and could not return. Instead a third character was invented,
      Tansy
      (whom Myranda also mentions in this episode), for Ramsay to kill, though as a result of these production issues the point was a bit lost that Ramsay will gleefully kill any of his loyal servants on a whim.

    According to Finn Jones, who plays Loras Tyrell, the
    Sparrows
    motivates were not religious at all but using religion as a guise for a power grab. Finn Jones said about the Sparrows in an interview that "It's paupers fed up with the elitist rule."
    Evidence for this is backed up by the fact the Faith Militant didn't prosecute Olyvar for the same crimes they charged Loras with, even though he confessed to all of them.

    Olyvar, a homosexual prostitute, had witnessed first hand the Faith Militant's homophobia during the second raid on Littlefinger's brothel when a male client and male prostitute were verbally and physically assaulted by a group of Sparrows. One is to assume Olyvar struck a deal to testify aganist his former lover Loras in exchange for not being charged for the same crimes.

      Just because Olyvar knows that Loras has a birthmark on an intimate body part - that does not support his testimony. As Loras's squire, as Olyvar claims to be, his duties would include dressing and undressing his master, providing plenty of opportunities for him to see Loras naked in a non-sexual context. Loras’s lack of presence in flying into a rage, rather than simply laughing off the scar and continuing to deny, is unfortunate.

The TV series has been deliberately ambiguous about the status of Willas and Garlan - they actually were listed in the official HBO family trees in Season 1, but were subsequently omitted, and have never been referred to otherwise. The producers seem to be strongly leaning to the position that they simply don't exist in the TV continuity - though they have avoided outright stating this. It is similar to how in Season 2 the writers were careful to say that

    , who foreswear all claim to inheritance when they join. The conversation heavily implied that the only Tyrell heirs would be through Loras or Margaery - if Loras couldn't inherit, they said the Tyrells' only heirs would be Margaery's Lannister children with Joffrey. This ignores the detail from the novels that even without their other two sons, there are numerous minor Tyrell cousins. Whatever the case, even that scene between Olenna and Tywin never stated in as many words that "Loras and Margaery have no brothers". Similarly, in this episode he is called the heir to Highgarden, but the writers avoided directly stating that Mace Tyrell has

Or perhaps Willas could be introduced as a cousin. Even so, for the moment, Willas and Garlan do not exist in the TV continuity, and it seems strongly implied that Loras is an only son.

    Littlefinger's goals remain unclear in the TV series, given that it is heavily condensing the narrative from the books. In the fourth novel, he tells Sansa that he plans to wed her to Harrold Hardyng, the heir to the Vale, after Robin Arryn dies (he will probably not live to adulthood in view of his poor health). Sansa reminds Littlefinger she is still married, but he assures her it is no problem: this is only a betrothal; the marriage must wait until Cersei is done and Sansa is widowed. When all the pieces are in place, at the wedding Sansa will reveal her true identity, and will have it all - Harrold, the Eyrie and Winterfell.

      Littlefinger does not say explicitly if he intends to "help" Robin die. His actions, hoever, imply that he does: he orders maester Colemon to give the child

      in order to stop his wretched shaking. Colemon does not like the idea and explains to Sansa why it is dangerous, but complies. In any case, Littlefinger cannot have Robin die too soon after his mother's death, for it will look very suspicious in the eyes of Lord Royce and other lords of the Vale, who loathe Littlefinger and keep an eye on him.

      Littlefinger says nothing about Stannis and the Boltons in particular, and the current affairs at the North in general. Therefore, it is unclear at that point where is Stannis's host, whether the Boltons have already come to Winterfell, and how Littlefinger intends to deal with them, if at all.
     </li>
     <li key="3fef24fe-5439-460f-a71e-5267a68c019d">
      Littlefinger says that his plans will take four or five years to come to fruition; by then, the Boltons may be long destroyed either by Stannis (who is still alive in the books) or northern houses, and it is impossible to predict who will have possession of Winterfell. Therefore, Littlefinger does not plan any military campaigns at that point, but focuses on the first stage of his plan: "Alayne" must charm her would-be-husband.

   <li key="6880054b-6df9-4359-b34d-5098539f9d6f">
    In the TV series, Littlefinger explains to Sansa that he thinks Stannis will defeat the Boltons (he is an experienced military commander and the rest of the north would gladly turn on the Boltons to aid him): if Stannis wins, he will make Sansa the new ruler of the North, but on the chance that Stannis is killed, she will still be in a position to subvert the Boltons from within. The Boltons were also only willing to risk angering Cersei by marrying Sansa Stark because they are desperate to secure their hold over the North before Stannis's attack - meaning Sansa couldn't wait to marry Ramsay until after Stannis is defeated, it had to be before their confrontation. In this episode, Littlefinger outright tells Cersei about Sansa's marriage - in order to manipulate her into granting him permission to lead the Vale's armies to the North to defeat the Boltons. This way he can seize the North

      The complication this introduces is that Cersei specifically demands that he present her with Sansa's head. It isn't clear if Littlefinger is outright willing to kill Sansa, given his obsession with her, or if he is just promising that to Cersei's face in order to placate her. If the latter case, it is possible that he intends to fake Sansa's death so he can have her in his possession again. Alternatively, he might just be lying to Cersei's face to buy time -

Cersei was going to find out about Littlefinger's betrayal sooner or later: in the novels, it would be sooner, once she heard that the Vale's armies had

Once Margaery is officially Tommen's new Queen, however, the Tyrells no longer pretend to be getting along with the Lannisters, and start openly demanding concessions. As a result, the Tyrells are literally revealing their "true colors", and they switch from softer teals to darker greens and are more liberal with the amount of gold fabric they wear. Margaery has actually been dressing this way for much of the season, but the difference is more obvious with Olenna's costume. See "

    It is no empty boast that Jorah is one of the most skilled knights in Westeros: in his youth, he was actually quite a successful tournament knight. This is assuming that the backstory is the same as in the novels, and the TV series didn't change it to have Tyrion being facetious (there is no reason to think this). Jorah's tournament victories are how he impressed
    Lynesse Hightower
    to wed him (though she later left him due to his lack of wealth). The "Tourney at

Tyrion is also not inventing the detail that Jorah even defeated Jaime Lannister that day - he didn't unhorse him, but he did break nine lances against Jaime at the joust, after which the judges declared him the winner (Jaime was one of the best tournament knights alive but he wasn't invincible; in Season 1 the TV show mentioned that Loras also surprisingly managed to defeat him on one occassion). Jorah's passion for Lynesse was so great at the tournament that he personally defeated at least seven men (including Jaime and Lord

      Tyrion doesn't tell Jorah that his father is dead in the novels, and how he died. During the Battle of the Fist of the First Men, Sam sends two messages by ravens to Castle Black and the Shadow Tower, reporting that the ranging force is under attack (without specifying who the attackers are). The defenders of Castle Black, fearing that the ranging force has been destroyed by the Wildlings, send distress messages to all kings and lords at Westeros. Pycelle brings one of those messages to the Small Council, and that way Tyrion is aware that Jeor Mormont is probably dead - although Mormont is killed later, and not by wildlings but by the mutineers at Craster's Keep. Only after the loyalists return to Castle Black (around the middle of the book) do they report that Mormont was killed by the mutineers - but the defenders do not send any more reports to the Small Council, thus all Tyrion could tell Jorah was that his father was probably dead, killed by wildlings. The third novel is very long so the TV series split it into two seasons of material, Season 3 and Season 4. The TV series used the

      as the climax of Season 4, and it happened at the end of the third novel - but due to the way the content was split, both Jon and Samwell return to Castle Black by the Season 3 finale. The result was that the Night's Watch storyline had to be padded out in Season 4, because in the novels the battle occurred very soon after they returned (the equivalent of if the battle happened in the second or third episode of Season 4, not episode nine). Samwell is shown writing letters to all of the high lords of Westeros in the Season 3 finale, warning them that the White Walkers have returned and that Lord Commander Mormont is dead (only Stannis responded to help). Tyrion is only arrested some weeks afterwards when Joffrey is poisoned at the

    recalled that Sansa's wedding dress caused some production issues on-set: it is supposed to be snowing, but the dress was so big and heavy that it acted like a snow plow, clearing a path in the snow. Because the scene was filmed in multiple takes, this would have made it obvious that Sansa walked up and down the aisle multiple times, when in-universe, she is only supposed to have walked down the aisle once (more than just footprints in the snow, which plausibly the other characters might have made before she arrived). Therefore, extra time and energy had to be spent resetting the snow between each take. Moreover, because when they arrive in their wedding chambers Ramsay rips the back of her dress open, the prop-dress was engineered to be easily ripped, sewn with weak cotton thread. This scene was also filmed in multiple takes, so it had to be sewn back together between each one.

    The main cause for the rushed production of this sequence was the restrictive nature of filming at the Alcázar of Seville, a real-life royal palace in Spain and UNESCO World Heritage site. The production team only had one week to film in this location, and the preserved nature of the site meant that the physical placement of cameras was limited.

      : Jaime's and Bronn's infiltration of the Water Gardens and Ellaria's assassination attempt were written in the script itself as night-time raids, which would make more sense for both of their plans and could've lended a more appropriate atmosphere for the fight scene. Many reviewers were also puzzled at why both Jaime/Bronn and the Sand Snakes would mount a brazen daylight attempt to reach Myrcella if they were worried about infiltrating past the castle's guards.

    Much later, in August 2015, the episode's director
    Jeremy Podeswa
    was asked about the Sand Snakes fight scene in an interview with
    <i key="14f5b1a9-adea-48cc-85f5-2e5edf72b73c">
     YahooTV
    </i>
    . Podeswa confirmed that he personally oversaw filming on the scene (it wasn't delegated to someone else). In the interview he admitted that filming in the Alcazar castle affected how the fight sequence was filmed, given that it is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the Spanish government almost never allows filming within it, so there were restrictions on what they could shoot - i.e. they couldn't film a tight action scene in the corridors of the castle's interiors. Instead, Podeswa said that filming in the outer plaza of the castle was the only choice. Podeswa admitted that filming in the open plaza was problematic because it was much too open of a space to film a fight scene, meaning that they had to resort to static wide-shots instead of being able to zoom in on individual blows as they would in a more narrow area. They apparently realized these problems even as they were filming, because Podeswa admitted that the film crew moved in potted plants and trees around the edges of the fight in an attempt to make the plaza appear a little more narrow (notice the small trees planted in box frames around the edge of the scene - all of these were moved in, not permanent parts of what is otherwise a very wide and open plaza).

    To complicate matters, the fast, kinetic Dornish fighting style in the TV series is heavily based on the Chinese
    <i key="f99dd35f-f6f7-40e9-b0d1-9ef8fb84fae6">
     wushu
    </i>
    martial art, as seen with
    the Oberyn/Gregor fight
    in Season 4, which is difficult to master in a relatively short amount of time. As a result, stunt doubles have to be heavily relied upon in such scenes. To hide the presence of stunt doubles, the camerawork has to make frequent quick-cuts in closeup, and also film them from faraway in wide-shots - the drawback being that the audience can only see those complex moves from a far distance, without the camera zooming in and out to follow the movement of the weapons, so the expert stuntwomen's fast moves are ultimately difficult to see anyway.

   <li key="5f904a03-b3ff-4b37-bf77-076dfcc2ec8c">
    The rushed production on the scene extends to its editing, with several basic continuity errors between shots: near the end when Nymeria Sand runs up to Myrcella she is clearly holding her large whip in her right hand, but in the

    shot when the camera angle shifts to Myrcella's side to see Nymeria approaching her, Nymeria's whip has suddenly disappeared, and she is instead holding a dagger she uses to threaten Myrcella. The shot wasn't simply flipped horizontally in editing, in which case Nymeria's left hand would be holding her whip - instead, she is using her left hand to grab Myrcella's arm, and her whip has simply vanished. It is possible that they could only film a limited number of takes given their tight time schedule for filming at the location, and simply didn't have time to do any quick reshoots - in which case there was only so much that could be done in post-production editing to try to hide it.

      It also isn't clearly explained why Nymeria grabs Myrcella and tries to flee with her, when their intention is to kill Myrcella, not kidnap her. Though given that Ellaria expressed a desire to send Myrcella back to Cersei "one finger at a time" in the episode "

    Another factor that may have affected the production of this sequence is that the show's new stunt coordinator,
    Rowley Irlam
    , did not have an opportunity to spend many weeks of coordinated training with the three Sand Snake actresses:
    Keisha Castle-Hughes
    (Obara) lives in New Zealand,
    Rosabell Laurenti Sellers
    (Tyene) lives in Italy, and
    Jessica Henwick
    (Nymeria) lives in London, so they were all trained remotely by Irlam. While the actresses worked extensively for weeks to use their weapons correctly, in the end the three of them, together with

     Nikolaj Coster-Waldau
    </a>
    (Jaime), did not spend as much time all together on the same set practicing a complicated three versus two person fight sequence.
    A key point that the actresses repeatedly emphasized in interviews is that the Sand Snakes are supposed to fight
    <i key="898d5d61-4eae-4c58-b202-19743b61fc36">
     as a team
    </i>
    , synchronizing their attacks. Nymeria in particular doesn't independently attack other people but is supposed to alternate between Jaime and Bronn, tripping them up with her whip to create openings for her sisters to attack. Therefore, to a far greater degree than when two other characters happen to be in a multi-person fight scene (such as when Bronn and Jaime fight off several Dornish guards earlier in the season), it was actually crucial that the Sand Snakes fight as a coordinated unit.
    <ul key="c818add6-9db5-487e-9783-ec55e0a79a3d">
     <li key="1fa55175-304e-4b20-9bb6-b29e176d6765">
      Two of the three actresses that the TV series cast as the Sand Snakes had no prior stage fighting experience, compared to other physically demanding roles in which the TV series simply cast professional stuntmen to play the parts.
      Laurenti Sellers (Tyene) even clarified in an interview with
      <i key="5b43c1c6-a2f6-4f57-921c-11b760c8b5c8">

      </i>
      that while the actresses spoke of extensive "training" with their weapons, she considered "training" and "fight choreography" to be two separate things, and admitted that they only started learning the fight choreography quite late in the production process.
      Keisha Castle-Hughes
      , however, is an Emmy and Oscar-nominated actress, and actually had a fair amount of prior weapons experience (thought not stage fighting), as due to her half-Maori background she said she was familiar with the spear-like

    Matt Easton of Schola Gladiatoria, a Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA)/Historical fencing expert, posted a
    of the fight scene. Although he disliked the scene, he admitted that upon careful slow-motion rewatch, actors and stunt men were actually performing what he judged as more or less adequate and realistic fight moves (i.e. Obara parrying with the blade of her sword then whirling her spear to club her opponent with the other end). He felt that the lack of choreography training for the fight (as admitted by Laurenti-Sellers) showed a little, but on the whole wasn't outright terrible. The only part of the actual fight he criticized was equipping Nymeria with a whip, which isn't very practical: he assessed that she was supposed to be acting in a support role to the other two girls, tripping out Jaime and Bronn with her whip, which he felt

    make sense, but the choreography failed to use it adequately. Nonetheless, Easton's final assessment was that the fight work itself was either good or at least tolerable. As Easton summed up,
    <i key="dbd5ecd2-83f3-4532-88ae-3352b164fd7f">
     most
    </i>
    movie fight scenes actually look like this on-set, because the stuntmen aren't actually hacking at each other with weapons, but the camera will zoom in on a moving sword in such a way as to make it look like that. Instead, Easton squarely laid the blame on what he judged to be awful camerawork and editing for the sequence (which as the director admitted, stemmed from insisting on filming inside a UNESCO World Heritage site and not a sound stage, despite major physical limitations as a result).

[...] The writers are walking a very fine line here. They handled it well tonight, telling a gothic tale of innocence sacrificed, which at times recalled Angela Carter and Neil Jordan’s dark and haunting The Company of Wolves, and hinted perfectly at horrors to come, but they must be careful not to tip from there to gratuitous violence for its own sake."

You can assert the former, but you have to argue the latter, using the text and the language of the artistic form at hand. For me, the scene of Sansa’s rape was tremendously unpleasant, but the care taken in the staging, acting and shooting of the scene made it impossible for me to regard it as lazy or slapdash. [...] Instead, this scene felt of a piece with the way I’ve always understood “Game of Thrones” and George R.R. Martin’s “Song of Ice and Fire”: as a story about the consequences of rape and denial of sexual autonomy. […] Sansa Stark isn’t ruined, as a character or as a person, because she was raped.

    "Sansa’s choice to marry Ramsay and walk into that room. She feels marrying him is a vital step in reclaiming her homeland"

    Bryan Cogman later discussed the scene at length in the Season 5 DVD commentary

   . Cogman explained that the decision to merge Sansa's storyline with the Bolton storyline in the first place was made not because of the shock of the wedding night but because they wanted to have Sansa back in Winterfell, trying to reclaim it from the Boltons, as well as encountering Theon again, which would allow for the two actors to play off each other:

  <p key="a13d3800-8be7-4953-b08f-992309aff8bd">
   Earlier in the commentary, Cogman stressed that once this decision was made it was a foregone conclusion that if Sansa married Ramsay he would mistreat her on the wedding night:

  <p key="e9dd9005-1e1f-4db5-93cb-24905a3d5a6f">
   Cogman didn't actually address the question of why they chose to merge Sansa with Jeyne Poole in the first place. He seems to be describing it as a two-step process which may have occurred years apart - though the description is so vague it is impossible to discern. There are generally two scenarios:

  <ul key="83e6113e-bf16-40d4-b114-0afc98620b69">
   <li key="57c9e2bc-6ffa-460c-8dd8-e2d16c1533c9">
    1 - The writers experimented with the idea of "sending Sansa to Winterfell" since Season 2, apparently as a betrothal, focusing on that she's meet Theon again there, and the effect this would have on his redemption arc...but hadn't yet decided that Ramsay would outright rape Sansa. Years later, while scripting Season 5 itself, they felt locked in by this prior decision and had no choice but to have Ramsay rape Sansa, or else be untrue to the situation. In this case, the incongruous rise of "Dark Sansa" in Season 4 only to become a victim again in Season 5 was simply due to lack of long-term planning.
   </li>
   <li key="06dab4b0-3fa5-4499-9343-4f495ec5f935">
    2 - The writers did plan to have Ramsay actually rape Sansa since Season 2. When Cogman describes this seemingly two-step decision - first the desire to send Sansa back to Winterfell, second the realization that Ramsay would probably rape her - it was actually all part of one big writers' room discussion, possibly across days or weeks, but which was ultimately
    <i key="45b36e3e-d956-489c-a0b4-37b7908c7499">
     settled
    </i>
    during Season 2, long before Season 5. In this case, the writers knew even during the rise of "Dark Sansa" in Season 4 that she would fall down to be a victim again in Season 5, and it is unclear what exactly they intended her character arc to be as a result.

   Cogman also discussed in the DVD commentary that some critics were upset and felt that

   at the end as Ramsay tears Sansa's clothes off was changing the scene from being about Sansa to being about Theon - though other critics felt this was more tasteful. Cogman reiterated and confirmed the position of the latter group of critics: he felt the

    entire

   scene was from Sansa's perspective and about Sansa, not Theon, and the camera only focuses on Theon's reaction at the end because they felt it was more tasteful not to actually show Ramsay raping Sansa on-camera:

   <i key="e605136f-fc52-45e1-9a51-6388f4349f5d">
    did
   </i>
   , in fact, consciously choose to zoom in on Alfie Allen's face during post-production editing: they were so impressed by Alfie Allen's non-verbal performance during the shot that they felt they owed it to him to zoom in on the existing footage to showcase it. As originally filmed, the camera just pans away to a wideshot of the room, and Theon happens to be in it - they zoomed in on the existing footage during the editing process (thus, if you look very carefully, the screen resolution is slightly lower during the final shot of Allen's face - because it wasn't actually filmed as a closeup shot). Other critics picked up on the EW summation article, and based on it defended that the camera focuses on Theon purely as a discretion shot, instead of actually showing Sansa being raped - when these were actually two separate and unrelated decisions: first, not to actually put the camera on Sansa while she is being raped, and second, to zoom in on the footage of Allen's face, specifically to show off his performance during a scene which was originally supposed to be "about" Sansa. In Cogman's own words, continuing immediately after the longer quote:

   after denying that the shot shifted attention from Sansa to Theon, he admitted that they zoomed in on the shot to show off Allen's performance.

   Cogman did stress in his Blu-ray commentary that Sansa's storyline isn't over yet, that her rape might be setting up things in Season 6, but he didn't want to give them away before they aired.

   Speaking later in December 2015, director Jeremy Podeswa said that the widespread negative reaction to this rape scene and change from the novels actually did reach executive producers David Benioff and Dan Weiss
