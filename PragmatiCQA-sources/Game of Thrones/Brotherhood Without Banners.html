   The core of the Brotherhood are formed from the force of 100 soldiers, that Eddard himself sent out under the command of Beric Dondarrion to bring Gregor Clegane to justice, when news came that Gregor was raiding villages in the Riverlands. In fact, it was Tywin's intention to goad Eddard into confronting him in order to use it as a pretext for war, and he knew Eddard's strong sense of justice would prevent him from letting Gregor's depredations of the smallfolk go unanswered. Thus the Lannisters anticipated this response and laid a trap for the men sent by Eddard at the Battle of Mummer's Ford, in which most of the force was destroyed. The goal of the trap was actually to lure Eddard himself out of the safety of the capital city in order to kill or capture him during the ambush. However, Tywin was not aware at the time that Eddard was injured during
   a brawl with Jaime
   , thus could not lead the hunt for Ser Gregor in person, inadvertently thwarting the Lannister plan.

   About a third of Dondarrion's force led by Thoros manage to cut their way out of the ambush, though Dondarrion himself was killed. His body was recovered, however, and when Thoros reflexively recited a prayer to the Lord of Light over his deceased friend, much to his surprise Dondarrion magically returned to life. The few survivors led by Dondarrion were cut off behind enemy lines, and decided to form the Brotherhood to continue to harass Gregor's forces, still following Eddard's orders to make the Lannisters answer for their crimes. Eddard supplemented Beric's expedition with members of his own personal guard, thus several members of the Brotherhood are the last survivors of his household guard from Winterfell who accompanied him to King's Landing. One of them, Harwin, was even present when Eddard and his sons found the six

   pups in the first chapter of the first novel. They continue to fight in memory of Eddard, but after seeing the suffering of the smallfolk as both Lannister and Stark forces burned out villages to deny them to the enemy, they began to fight for the ideal of protecting the smallfolk from both Lannister and Stark soldiers. It is stated that about one third of Dondarrion's original one hundred men died in the ambush at Mummer's Ford, thus the original core group of the Brotherhood consisted of about thirty to forty men (it is unclear how many were from Eddard's personal guard), though this was later supplemented by smallfolk and deserters from different sides in the war.

   At the Tourney of the Hand, Anguy won the archery contest and Thoros won the melee contest. This is why they arrived in King's Landing, and were available when Eddard ordered Beric to lead out a group of able knights to bring Gregor Clegane to justice - the soldiers who formed the original core of the Brotherhood . Thus the connection might be lost on the TV audience that one of the reasons the Brotherhood is such a disproportionately capable fighting force is because so many of its initial members were elite fighters who came to the capital city to participate in the Tourney of the Hand. For example it might a bit contrived in the TV series that, as if by pure chance, the Brotherhood's lead archer Anguy just happens to be preternaturally skilled with a bow. The books actually do explain that he is a professional archer so skilled that he actively competes in tournaments, and indeed recently won first place at a

   , the Brotherhood is one of the few remaining pockets of resistance against Lannister control in the Riverlands. The one or two dozen original members of the Brotherhood who used to be part of Eddard's personal guard (such as Harwin) are thus one of the only groups of Stark soldiers who managed to escape death or capture in the war. Even after the Red Wedding, they continue to fight the Lannisters in the name of King Robert and Lord Eddard.

   Although the Brotherhood claims to protect the smallfolk, they sometimes rob the same people they are supposed to protect, as they did to the
   Old woman prisoner
   . She told bitterly that Beric "took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it. Can I eat a bit of raggy old paper, I ask you? Will it give me eggs?". The Brotherhood members that encountered Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie intended to treat them similarly: take their horses and pay with a paper. To justify their acts, they claim that they will pay after the war is over, and that they can make better use of those items than their previous owners by fighting for the good of the realm. Even if the Brotherhood intends to honor its obligations, it is not much of consolation to the poor people they rob.
