Daenerys states that good mothers do not give up on their children; they discipline them if needed, but never give up on them. She nods to Daario to push one of the leaders further forward. A sudden burst of flame from Rhaegal sets the man aflame before he is torn apart and eaten by both dragons. Daenerys suggests that the dragons may determine the innocence of the captives and touches Hizdahr's back as if she wanted to push him but then she pretends she wants not to overfeed the dragons and lets the rest of the men be led away.

   Grey Worm wakes up later with Missandei sitting beside him. He asks if Barristan Selmy survived the attack by the Sons of the Harpy but Missandei shakes her head. Grey Worm thinks he has failed Ser Barristan, his men and Daenerys – a claim Missandei denies. Missandei tells him he shouldn't be ashamed for being wounded given that he was ambushed and outnumbered, but Grey Worm says he is ashamed that he was afraid when he was stabbed. Missandei says that everyone fears death. However, Grey Worm says it isn't death he fears, it is the thought of never getting to see Missandei again that terrified him. Missandei is noticeably touched and kisses Grey Worm.

   Daenerys asks Missandei whether she should reopen the

Daenerys visits the imprisoned Hizdahr, who begs for his life. Daenerys tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits, but only for free men. She also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of Meereen to forge a bond with the people of the city, and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already. She leaves a very confused Hizdahr to ponder that he will live, and that he will soon be Meereen's prince consort.

Jorah is struck silent too, as Drogon is even bigger and more majestic than when he left. So distracted are they that they don't notice when the statues on a nearby aqueduct stand up and leap at the boat: they are
   Stone Men
   - victims of

   so far gone that they have been sent to live out the rest of their lives in quarantine in the ruins. Jorah tells Tyrion not to let them touch him and fights them off.  However, as Tyrion is tied up, he is cornered at one end of the boat with a stone man advancing on him while Jorah battles more at the other end.

   to eventually reach Meereen. Tyrion seems up for it and Jorah goes to look for firewood so they can make camp. However, once out of Tyrion's view, he pulls back his sleeve to inspect the cracked skin on his wrist, confirming that he had been infected with greyscale during the fight with the Stone Men. He looks at Tyrion and then glances in the direction of Meereen, knowing that even if he dies, he needs to get Tyrion to Daenerys.

    's great hall was spun around into the opposite position from where it was last scene, to signify the change in ownership from the Starks to the Boltons - also helping to make the old and familiar set look slightly unfamiliar and unsettling, given that the Boltons live there now. The Boltons also couldn't physically remove every Stark direwolf statue from the castle (some of them are load-bearing, others would have taken a lot of work to remove, etc.) but if you look closely, the Boltons did at least smash the faces of every direwolf statue or edifice.

    Also explained in the Blu-ray commentary, the main Winterfell set (filmed in Banbridge, Northern Ireland) was greatly expanded in Season 5. The original sets from Seasons 1 and 2 primarily consisted of the outer courtyard, the feast hall, and one interior bedroom which could be redressed (for Eddard and Catelyn's room, Bran's room, etc.), but otherwise there wasn't an extensive interconnected interior set. For Season 5, the production team constructed a complex of staircases, corridors and bedrooms, all added on top of the existing courtyard and feast hall.

    of the "Seven Kingdoms" proper: Jon Snow and Stannis Baratheon at the Wall (and the Boltons in the North), Daenerys in Meereen, and also Arya and Tyrion in the Free Cities. Martin pointed out that there are a few narrative parallels between events in different regions that are not immediately obvious as a result, i.e., he meant to intercut Cersei chapters in King's Landing with Daenerys chapters in Meereen, contrasting how each queen is challenged to hold their rule together. The TV series intercut this material, however, as it was originally conceived. Therefore, in the preceding episode, the rise of radical movements in both regions are presented in parallel - the

The creation of the Wall is what led to the divide between the Seven Kingdoms to the south and the "wildlings" - who are basically just anyone unlucky to be born north of the Wall. Thus the Night's Watch and the wildlings believe they have been enemies for the past 8,000 years or so.

    Michael Condron

Earlier in the novel, Roose does remark to Reek that he is concerned that if and when Walda does start bearing Roose children in the near future, it will cause strife as Ramsay will see them as a threat to his position as Roose's heir. Roose tells Reek about Domeric's death, heavily implying he was murdered by Ramsay. Roose claims that "Ramsay will kill them all, of course. That’s for the best. I will not live long enough to see new sons to manhood, and boy lords are the bane of any House. Walda will grieve to see them die, though".

If a lord has a bastard son, and later has a lawful son by his married wife, the younger but lawful son is his legal heir. If that elder bastard son is later legitimized, however, his own supporters would say that he is now the heir because he is eldest, while others would argue that even a legitimized bastard ranks behind a younger but lawful son. Both Roose and Ramsay are aware of this, and as the writers explain in the Inside the Episode featurette, Roose is using Walda's pregnancy as an implied threat that Ramsay had better start behaving, otherwise Roose can simply name Walda's child as his legal heir at his own discretion.

Ramsay lived with her for most of his life as a simple peasant, though eventually she urged him to go to the Dreadfort to seek out his birthright as Roose's son. In this episode Ramsay says that she simply died when he was an infant (some time after she brought him to Roose), so apparently the TV continuity simplified it so that Ramsay has been living at the Dreadfort for many years.

      Oddly, Ramsay actually seems to care about his mother. This even extended to the point that he developed a warped fantasy interpretation of his own origins, that Roose genuinely fell in love with his peasant mother like something out of a fairy tale. In the novels Roose did not recall the story about how he raped the miller's wife to Ramsay himself, but mused about it aloud to Reek. He also callously observed to Reek that the miller's wife ultimately didn't turn out to be nearly as good of a lay as he had thought she'd be, she was hardly worth the rope he used to hang the miller, "so all in all it was a dismal day." The TV version moved the dialogue around somewhat: in the novels, when Roose is upset with Ramsay's growing cockiness and lack of restraint (publicly flaying alive lords who displease him), he bluntly says "All you have I gave you. You would do well to remember that,

    The TV series doesn't mention a detail from the novels: the Boltons often practice the banned practice of "First Night", in which a lord has the right to have sex with a commoner's wife on their wedding night. The miller and his wife therefore married in secret without Roose's knowledge to avoid him exercising this "right," though he stumbled upon them during a fox hunt anyway. First Night was banned in Westeros over two hundred years ago by King
    Jaehaerys I Targaryen
    , though a few unscrupulous lords such as the Boltons still try to exact it from their commoners if they think they can get away with it (Roose scoffs that he thinks some of the Umbers still do it in secret, as well as the poor mountain clans northwest of Winterfell, and on the isle of
    Skagos
    to the east, but this is unconfirmed).

"First Night" became particularly in vogue during the 1990s, when George R.R. Martin was writing much of the first novels and developing the Boltons, due in no small part to the prominence it had in the 1995 film

Even when the film was released, medieval historians vocally complained that this was an utterly inaccurate portrayal of medieval society, and no such right ever existed, nonetheless it became ingrained in pop culture perceptions of the period.

    Roose says that when Ramsay was first presented to him as a baby he at first wanted to throw his infant bastard into a river, but then he looked at him and saw that he was his son. The novels specify the detail that when Roose looked at the baby Ramsay he saw that he had inherited his own distinctive Bolton eye color: very creepy pale "ghost grey" eyes, so pale that they are nearly white, like the pupils are specs of dirt in ice (in the TV series, both Roose and Ramsay do have very pale blue-grey eyes). Seeing that the babe had his eyes and was clearly his son, the taboo against

However, while Roose's comment about Ramsay is in the books, Tywin's line that he initially wanted to kill Tyrion in his grief was actually invented for the TV show - so if anything, in reverse order, the TV writers were probably inspired by Roose's later line to Ramsay when they gave similar dialogue to Tywin back in Season 3.

Myranda says that Ramsay promised to marry her - while confusing at first, on closer analysis this was apparently just something Ramsay said as pillow-talk and didn't mean seriously.

      Tansy
      in the woods around the Dreadfort for petty amusement - but Violet was never seen again. Apparently the actress who played Violet got pregnant and could not return to the show, but the original intention was to have Ramsay kill Violet with his hunting dogs - showing that, as with his own
      master torturer
      whom he killed in Season 3, he really doesn't care about any of his underlings and will randomly kill them for flippant reasons. Because the actress could not reappear they had to use a new girl "Tansy" in the scene instead, lessening the point compared to killing Myranda's accomplice Violet.

Aemon and Samwell can't be reacting to recent news about Daenerys (though the episode intercutting between the two storylines might give this false impression). Of course, the message Samwell reads mentions nothing specific from this season, only that Daenerys conquered Meereen and chose to stay there to protect the former slaves - which happened in the middle of last season. Time moves more slowly in the TV continuity than in the novels, at the rate of about one year per TV season.

Why this change was made is unclear, though apparently it was to simplify the relationship between Daenerys and Aemon.

The novels do seem to give an explanation, however: once Samwell actually did express interest in joining the maesters to his father - who responded by chaining Sam by his neck to the wall in a prison cell, and then leaving him there for three days. Apparently, due to the strong martial traditions of House Tarly, Randyll thought it would be humiliating for any Tarly to give in to such bookish matters - and in contrast he thought it was less embarrassing if Sam at least joined the Night's Watch, which is a sworn military order.

Then again, they are interesting to Samwell because they are rare scouting reports about wildling clans and locally written books - the Night's Watch isn't exactly considered a bastion for higher learning.

      that he began to suspect that his character was being killed off when his filming schedule was shorter than usual. He read all of the novels as research for the role, and Barristan actually becomes a Point of View narrator in the fifth novel and would therefore have quite a lot of material - which made him more suspicious. He asked Benioff and Weiss and they confirmed that his character was being killed off. McElhinney was deeply confused and instead of simply accepting it, tried to argue against them that the story they were adapting would be much better suited if they didn't remove Barristan's substantial material.
      Apparently, from other interviews, Benioff and Weiss wanted to make room for Tyrion to meet Daenerys by the end of Season 5, and be her new anchor to current political events in Westeros: Barristan filled the exact same role from Season 3 onwards, and without him Daenerys would need to turn to Tyrion as a new advisor.

Missandei's reluctance to counsel Dany is somewhat odd even in the context of the series, however:

      Of course, it's possible that the ruins Jorah and Tyrion sail through aren't "Old Valyria" itself, but part of the outskirts of the massive city. "Old Valyria" itself is centered in the middle of an island formed when the Doom shattered the
      Valyrian Peninsula
      , not near the new coastline. In contrast, looking at a map, if Jorah was making the shortest route to Slaver's Bay by cutting across the northern parts of the Smoking Sea, he'd sail past the ruins of the satellite Valyrian cities

      and
      Tyria

That being said, the southern part of the Valyrian Peninsula around "Valyria" itself was the heartland of an empire which lasted for over 5,000 years, and it became densely filled with their massive construction projects - i.e., the "urban sprawl" of the "greater Valyria metropolitan area" covered most of the southern peninsula. The entire sub-region was often simply referred to as "Valyria," as if it was one big city. In short, Jorah and Tyrion might just be going through one of the outlying regions of "Valyria" that isn't

Jackson left the show after Season 3 ended, though the general point she made seems to have stuck with the rest of the production team: people can be very surprised at just how quickly nature will reclaim ruined buildings and leave them overgrown with vegetation if they are left undisturbed by further human action. This principle would hold true for both a half-ruined castle complex in Westeros or a ruined city in Essos. Therefore, the ruins of Valyria have also become overgrown and subsumed by the jungle, to an even greater extent than Harrenhal.

They didn't just take the exact same scarring pattern and cover more of their bodies with it: logically, they have a more advanced and severe case of the disease, so the scarring is not only more widespread but more pronounced, dark grey and with very deep cracks like stone (compared to Shireen's scarring, which isn't as discolored and doesn't have such deep cracks).

      jumped into the river from a height of 21 feet, without computer effects. The production team had to work out the physics in advance to determine how deep an object of his weight would plunge into the water from such a height, and on determining that the riverbed was too shallow, dredged it to be another seven feet deeper. The ruined pillars of the aqueduct that the boat approaches, which the Stone Men jump off of, where built out of polystyrene around an existing bridge at the on-location river.

      The closeup shots of the fight on the boat itself, however, were very difficult to shoot, and had to be filmed at a disused swimming pool that they converted into a water tank. When Tyrion is dragged underwater at the end of the fight, Peter Dinklage and the stunt men were

      film trilogy, when Sam Gamgee falls into the river at the end of the first film, a wind machine was blowing in the actor's hair to make it look like it was moving in water, but on closer inspection his clothing is dry and isn't clinging to him as it would submerged in water. Instead, for this episode Dinklage was indeed dragged 10 feet underwater, by one of the Stone Men stunt performers who was weighted down. Just off-camera, other crewmembers were also present at the bottom of the swimming pool wearing scuba gear, who gave Dinklage and the stunt men breaths from extra oxygen tanks between takes.

    The Season 5 Blu-ray commentary confirms that the way the stone man first appears before jumping into the water - above Tyrion, out of focus, and motionless so the audience doesn't realize he's already been on screen for some time - was a deliberate nod to a similar scene in Ridley Scott's classic scifi-horror film

    At the end of the episode, Jorah and Tyrion have passed through the Smoking Sea and are on the western shore of Slaver's Bay - Meereen is on the opposite, eastern side of the large bay, though still many hundreds of miles away. Daenerys left

    in the Season 1 premiere, and only ended up in Meereen by the Season 4 premiere, but in contrast Tyrion has come very close to Meereen in only about half of one TV season. This is simply because Tyrion is more or less going in the direct and quickest route, while Daenerys passed through many other and much more distant lands before arriving in Meereen by a circuitous journey. Daenerys spent months heading to
