   . She does not simply translate, but offers Kraznys commentary on Daenerys's words and diplomatically leaves out Kraznys's insults to the Khaleesi, remaining as professional as she can when Kraznys describes the acts used to discipline and strengthen the Unsullied.
  </p>
  <p key="cb47bca6-cdff-451e-809f-ed8d2ab820e5">
   Daenerys meets with Kraznys and other Good Masters and announces her intention to buy all of the eight thousand Unsullied for sale, but Kraznys says she cannot afford them. The slaver grows increasingly insulting and condescending - which makes Missandei struggle to interpret politely. Daenerys then adds she also wants to buy the hundreds of young men still in training. In exchange, she offers one of her

   . The Good Masters agree, but Daenerys also asks for Missandei as a gift and a show of good faith for the upcoming transaction. He agrees, and Missandei follows Daenerys.
  </p>
  <p key="d44caa7a-24a3-48f8-85a8-7746045b35c8">
   Daenerys asks the young slave for her name and if she has any living family, but she says she does not. Daenerys warns her that she is heading into war and she may be killed or may fall sick and die, to which Missandei simply recites the Valyrian aphorism: "Valar morghulis". Daenerys responds by correctly interpreting, "all men must die" but also adds that "we are not men", making Missandei grin.
  </p>
  <p key="4457f59a-e236-4321-84a9-d494fd1bbcec">
   Missandei, sporting a new dress to match Daenerys's outfit, is present when Kraznys and Daenerys conduct their exchange. She interprets their exchange until Daenerys fluidly begins issuing orders to the Unsullied in perfectly accented
   Low Valyrian
   , at which Missandei stares in shock. Missandei survives the subsequent sack of Astapor and marches out of the city with Daenerys.

   . That night, as Daenerys bathes, she is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks no fewer than nineteen languages. Missandei says this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of
   Dothraki

Suddenly, an Unsullied enters and holds a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He explains he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains, but they ran into a philosophical disagreement over her beauty. He then releases Missandei and produces his captains' severed heads.

   Missandei is later on hand as Daenerys waits for word of the infiltration of Yunkai
   and when Yunkai's gates open. She at first recites a prepared speech on how Daenerys has freed the slaves, but the khaleesi interrupts with a speech of her own. When the freed slaves begin calling Daenerys "mhysa", Missandei explains the word's Ghiscari origins and its meaning, "mother".

   Missandei remains Daenerys's aide-de-camp in the weeks following the fall of Yunkai. When an irritated Daenerys locates Grey Worm and Daario, Missandei informs them that they have been at their contest (balancing their swords to see who will have the honor of riding at the queen's side) since midnight. Missandei is amused when Daenerys threatens to expel the winner of the contest from her army. Later on, Missandei discusses the
   Great Masters
   with the queen, and suggests that if they are smart, they should be afraid.

   At the gates of Meereen, Missandei interprets the words of Meereen's champion to Daenerys. She is clearly reluctant to accurately interpret the Meereenese Valyrian and cleans up the language slightly when relaying the message. A few minutes later, when Daario is selected as the champion, Missandei makes complimentary remarks about him, which Daenerys brushes off.

  <p key="c6af7ba4-f88e-46cf-8a56-eb11447881a4">
   Missandei is revealed to have been teaching Grey Worm the Common Tongue. As the lessons progress, Missandei and Grey Worm discuss their lost homelands (

   Siege of Meereen
   . Missandei then takes residence in

Later she discusses what happened with Daenerys, who says Unsullied aren't interested in women. Missandei says he was, though, surprising as it seems. Daenerys asks her whether, when a slave is castrated, the masters take both the "pillar" and the "stones." Missandei does not know, and Daenerys asks whether she's ever wondered. Missandei thoughtfully confirms she has.

   Grey Worm later comes to apologize, but she tells him there is no need. She expresses sympathy over what was done to him, but he replies that if it had not happened, the course of events that eventually led to their meeting would not have occurred, which visibly moves her. As he turns to leave, Missandei says she is glad he saw her, to which he says he is as well. She is later present when Jorah is dismissed from Daenerys's service and banished.

She is present later when Grey Worm wakes up from lying unconscious in three days. Grey Worm states that he feels ashamed of himself for being afraid, to which Missandei responds that all men fear death. Grey Worm then says that the reason he was afraid wasn't because of death itself but because he would never be able to see "Missandei from the Island of Naath" again.

   Missandei is touched with tears by this and leans over to give Grey Worm a kiss. Missandei is later asked for advise by Daenerys regarding her current situation. Missandei say that she doesn't think she is fit to give advice to a queen, which Daenerys thinks is absurd and states that she thinks Missandei is as fit as anyone to have a say in this. Missandei says that instead of listening to her counselors Daenerys should perhaps listen to her heart instead. This leads to Daenerys reopening the fighting pits and proposing to Hizdahr.

   Whilst Varys is dealing with

When Tyrion tries to engage them in a drinking game, Missandei says that neither of them drink. When Varys finally enters and rescues them from the conversation, Missandei cautions against immediate reprisals against Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, since they need their troops to protect Meereen. Missandei states the Masters of Slaver's Bay only speak one "language" (violence and war), and they must answer accordingly. In the end, Tyrion convinces Varys to use his network of

   hostage
   of Cersei, who quips that Daenerys's reputation as the "Breaker of Chains" did not help her protect her closest friend.

   Daenerys quickly arrives with her remaining forces at the gates of King's Landing, where Missandei is held hostage, and demands that she be returned to her. Both Daenerys and Cersei also request each other's unconditional surrender. Although Tyrion attempts to appeal to Cersei's love for her unborn child and Daenerys's inevitable win, Cersei refuses to abandon the Iron Throne, quietly telling Missandei that if she has any last words, now is the time. Looking first to her lover, and then to her queen, she defiantly shouts "

   decapitates Missandei with a single swing of his sword, her head and body falling onto the ground below. Whilst Grey Worm is horrified and turns his face away, Daenerys, seething with rage, watches before silently turning away and withdrawing from the city.

   Daenerys and Grey Worm grieve Missandei's death at Dragonstone. Daenerys mournfully holds Missandei's slave collar, remarking it was the only thing she brought with her when they crossed the sea. Grey Worm burns it while he and Daenerys silently watch.
