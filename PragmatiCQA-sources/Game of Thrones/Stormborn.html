   Dany then confronts Varys about his role in hiring the assassins to target her; Varys reminds her that his choices were limited to either feigning continuing loyalty to Robert by arranging the assassination, or refusing and losing his head for it. She distrusts Varys due to his track record of switching allegiances. Refusing to be intimidated, Varys points out that incompetent rulers do not deserve blind loyalty, then recounts his lowly origins as a castrated slave and tells her that his true loyalty lies with the oppressed masses. Varys tells Daenerys that if all she wants from him is blind loyalty, she may as well have him killed, but he is much more useful to her and to the Realm alive, and that he believes she is the last hope for the people. Dany accepts his fealty on the condition that he not conspire against her - instead, she has Varys swear that if he thinks she is failing the people, he'll tell her when she's wrong and be as honest with her as he has been today. Varys agrees. Seemingly satisfied, Daenerys also warns Varys that if he betrays her, she will burn him alive. Varys replies that he would expect nothing less from the "Mother of Dragons."

If the young boy was afraid of drowning, he'd be thrown into the sea. If he drowns, it would be "good", and if he learns to swim, it would be "good" because only the fit survive. Grey Worm recalls that he was never the biggest/fastest/strongest but he was the most fearless warrior until he met Missandei. She replies that she also has to deal with fear and kisses him. Missandei strips naked and proceeds to undress Grey Worm. Grey Worm is reluctant to remove his trousers (presumably not wanting to horrify her with his castration scars) but eventually acquiesces to Missandei's wishes. The two of them then share an intimate sexual encounter.

Tyene retreats below decks to protect her mother Ellaria on Yara's orders, while Obara and Nymeria fight against Euron's Ironborn. Obara fights Euron, who kills her by impaling her with her own spear. Nymeria attacks him with her whip but Euron strangles her to death with it.

Theon clings to driftwood and sees Obara and Nymeria's corpses impaled on and hanged by the neck from the prow, respectively. Euron's fleet starts sailing towards King's Landing as Yara's fleet burns in the Narrow Sea, while Theon watches helplessly as the ship carrying his sister disappears into the night.

    . Her mother went into labor soon afterward, during a massive storm that smashed to pieces what little was left of the Targaryen fleet anchored at Dragonstone, before dying in childbirth. Being born during this ill-omened storm, she earned the nickname "Daenerys Stormborn". The episode itself opens with Tyrion and Daenerys referring to this.

      The original title of this episode was actually "The Mad King's Daughter", as Bryan Cogman revealed in a post-premiere interview.
      His initial draft of the episode had someone refer to her as "the Mad King's Daughter" in every other storyline, and these were actually filmed, but the lines were trimmed for time from the final version (i.e. Cersei calls her that in the final cut, but someone would have called her that too in the Winterfell storyline). The idea was to stress that no one in Westeros really knows Daenerys because she's been in exile her whole life, and her father was an infamous, literally insane tyrant, so many people would realistically be somewhat wary of her.

    Cogman went on to say in his post-premiere interview that with so many once-separated characters now meeting again, there was a danger in the writing process of going into "recap mode": two separated characters summarizing their experiences even though we, the audience, already saw this, so it would waste time and narrative focus.

     <li key="3ae42387-e035-42ea-95f4-76890773067d">
      In the original draft, for example,
      <a href="Varys.html" key="390e1ffc-ff1e-4492-a9d4-528ebb098697" title="Varys">
       Varys
      </a>
      's scene with Daenerys was actually much longer, as he gives a summary of the current political situation across all of Westeros for her to plan out her next move - this was actually filmed, but edited for time/focus.
     </li>
     <li key="491c1eaa-93e5-4606-b93b-472a0c748b45">
      Similarly, his original draft included a scene - which was removed from his second draft and never even filmed - of Theon and Tyrion on Dragonstone having a conversation about Sansa - Tyrion was in a sham marriage to her and worries about her safety, and Theon explains how they escaped Winterfell. This was never even filmed and cut from the script fairly early, by the second draft revision, because they'd just be using up screentime summarizing things the audience already saw (not to mention, why Theon and Tyrion wouldn't have had such a conversation in the days they first met in Meereen, which was weeks or months ago). Cogman said one of the primary reasons he initially put it in was just because

      (Theon) are two of the best actors in the cast, so he wanted to have a scene showing them off together.

    </ul>
   </li>
   <li key="ea21e70f-441c-4fab-aa36-8ff97094cbcb">
    Cogman also remarked in his post-premiere interview that while filming Season 7, even the actors were surprised at times at how fast the pace is going, that is, how much time passes off-screen between scenes: we see a character writing a letter sent by messenger-
    <a href="Raven.html" key="482e6d1f-a3c2-4525-af11-29753fa1d40f" title="Raven">
     raven
    </a>
    , someone else receiving it in another part of Westeros, then the original sender reacting to a response letter in the same episode. Cogman emphasized that this isn't inherently a contradiction in the internal
    Timeline
    of the TV series, it's simply that the pace of the narrative is officially faster i.e. in Season 1, Ned Stark and his family travel from Winterfell to the
    <a href="Inn at the Crossroads.html" key="0315f634-b23d-4bd1-8b6c-2cc7bd48c963" title="Inn at the Crossroads">

    within a single episode, because many weeks of travel happen off-screen. Weeks and months of narrative pass for

     Robb Stark
    </a>
    while on campaign in Season 2, as well, when scenes aren't directly connected. The timeline only becomes an issue when there is an overt contradiction. For example, Grey Worm leaves Dragonstone and arrives at Casterly Rock, on the other side of the continent, by ship in the next episode, which confused some reviewers - but nothing actually limited how much time passed between these episodes (presumably, weeks pass off-screen); it would only be a contradiction if, for example, Grey Worm arrived at Casterly Rock and said "we left Dragonstone

    " - only four times in the past six seasons, making this the fifth time. It is called "Essos" by name in both Daenerys's scenes and by Cersei. Essos is a loose fantasy analogue of Eurasia, and indeed is so vast that characters usually refer to a more specific region, such as "the
    <a href="Free Cities.html" key="f8282b11-6694-4f9b-a24b-96a1719e821e" title="Free Cities">

    Daenerys and Tyrion remark on how she was born on Dragonstone during a large storm similar to the storm currently sweeping over the island at the time. As explained in the "General" notes above, the storm she was born during was so massive and dangerous that it destroyed what was left of the Targaryen fleet at anchor. A preview chapter from the sixth novel explains these weather patterns: because

Apparently, Varys returned to Dorne by the end of last season, then the Martell fleet met the Targaryen fleet in the Narrow Sea (contrary to the claims of some critics, it was never visually established that he sailed all the way back to Meereen again for no reason, but that time passed of-screen).

      Bryan Cogman (who also wrote "Oathkeeper") explained in subsequent interviews that he likes putting in historical details like this to try to weave disparate story elements together (the Targaryen storyline in Essos isn't in utter isolation from the Westeros storylines, they used to rule Westeros). However, he said that while he actually did write more historical references for this episode, they were ultimately cut for time, because it was a lot of exposition that wasn't directly relevant to the current plot. In the finished version, Olenna only vaguely refers to the fact that she lived through the reigns of Daenerys's father, and his father before him - and there were just as many wars then as there are now.

    The prophecy of
    The Prince That Was Promised
    is mentioned very prominently in Daenerys's conversation with Melisandre; it has been mentioned only sporadically in earlier TV seasons, but was much more prominently foreshadowed in the novels. The TV producers stated that they tried to avoid setting up
    prophecies
    when possible, because it ties them in to a future storyline that they don't have an absolute guarantee they'll be able to finish. The novels also explain that the High Valyrian word for "prince" used in the prophecy is gender-neutral - sort of like "Ruler That Was Promised" or "Leader That Was Promised" in English. The phrasing consistently used is "Prince

Yet when Maester Aemon hears that Daenerys is not only alive but has hatched three new dragons, the possibility occurs to him that Daenerys is the prophesied figure, at which he laments that in all these years it simply never occurred to him that the "ruler who was promised" could also be a woman. This scene only occurs in the TV series, as Daenerys hasn't heard of the prophecy yet in the books - but if in the books it didn't even occur to a very well educated scholar and Targaryen like Maester Aemon for so long, it isn't unreasonable that it wouldn't occur to TV-Daenerys either after a brief mention. Aemon even says the prophecy was made

Peterson said of the issue, "When I saw it in the script, I didn't even question it. Seems fine to me now." Peterson also used the example that even in English, it is common for occupation nouns to be non-gendered - "surgeon", "doctor", "actor" - but if you refer to a "surgeon" out of context,

      In the books, Aemon goes on to explain that dragons themselves were a hint that a "prince" can be male or female - people forgot how dragon reproduction worked after they died out, but dragons can actually switch from female to male and back to female again, as mutable as flames - apparently this influenced High Valyrian to not use specific genders for terms regarding powerful figures. The TV show hasn't introduced this point about dragon biology.

    Low Valyrian

Thus the "Valyrian" that Grey Worm and Missandei were speaking in Season 3 is actually a variant of Low Valyrian, and not exactly the same language that Daenerys is speaking in now.

Selmy also tells that Ned tried to dissuade Robert from sending assassins after her (Barristan was present at the Small Council scene in which was discussed in the books, but he was absent in the TV version - though others could have just told him about the assassination plan, similar to how Renly told Loras about it); Daenerys, however, doesn't change her mind (at least not yet) about the Starks, reasoning that if a child is set upon by a pack of hounds, it does not matter which one tears out his throat. It remains to be seen how she would treat Ned Stark's children, who like her weren't yet born at the time. She forgave Tyrion and was willing to work with him, not holding him responsible for the death of her kin, so she may act the same towards Jon, but it is uncertain.

    In Season 1, King Robert had a discussion with Cersei about the effectiveness of the Targaryens using a Dothraki horde in Westeros. Cersei repeated her father Tywin's assessment that the Dothraki are excellent as a cavalry force against field armies, but they are not equipped for or skilled at castle sieges. Robert countered that the Dothraki don't

      Actor
      Jacob Anderson
      has explained in several interviews during the series that they wanted to have an arc to Grey Worm's character development, starting out as a slave-soldier stripped of his emotions by hellish training until he was just a robotic killing machine, but gradually discovering his humanity. As explained in Season 5, when he cries out in pain as he was stabbed and nearly died, Grey Worm had nothing to live for before so he didn't fear death (Unsullied will unquestioningly fall on their own swords if their owner commands it) - but Grey Worm explained that he cried out not out of pain, but out of fear, because now that he knows Missandei he has something worth living for and now fears death. As seen in this episode he is struggling with these new emotions and has been trained to think of any fear as a weakness, even love.

Voight's character is a crippled Vietnam war veteran left a paraplegic, unable to feel or move anything from the waist down or to achieve an erection (similar to Grey Worm's lack of a functional penis); therefore to still be intimate with Jane Fonda's character he performs oral sex on her (which she says is the first time she's ever had an orgasm). Cogman noted that the scene was somewhat infamous and revolutionary when it first came out, because cunnilingus for female pleasure had rarely been depicted in mainstream movies before (though as with this episode, it's not as if they depicted on-screen unsimulated genital contact, any more than fellatio scenes in the TV show were ever unsimulated).

      In real life, if an adult man has his testicles removed, he can still achieve an erection. If a boy has his testicles removed before puberty, however, it is difficult to impossible for them to achieve an erection with the remaining shaft of the penis - due to the lack of hormones during the puberty years that would normally be supplied by the testicles. This is a moot point for the Unsullied: both their testicles and penis shaft are removed when they are no more than five years old. Even eunuchs who have had their testicles and penis removed can possibly still feel other sexual stimulation, such as anal sex, though these nerve responses are much more stunted if they are castrated before puberty. Kraznys actually explains within the novels that eunuchs can sometimes achieve an erection if they only have their testicles removed, so this is why the Astapori cut off all of the Unsullied's genitals, just to be sure.

      In real life, there are various
      historical accounts of eunuchs
      engaging in sexual or at least romantic activities. For example, the ninth century medieval Islamic travel chronicler
      Al-Jahiz
      describes being surprised that the warrior-eunuchs used as guards at the court in Baghdad (sort of like the Unsullied) were quite masculine in their behavior, yet still engaged in "passive / feminine" sexual acts (receptive penetration, as the only parts left to them).

    The books introduced the idea of the Unsullied forming emotional or romantic relationships with a different Unsullied character named "Stalwart Shield", and the TV series actually introduced the same subplot in Season 5 (though they renamed him "
    White Rat
    " to keep the naming convention of the Unsullied). He was an Unsullied who was killed by the Sons of the Harpy while he was in a brothel. Daenerys is confused why he was in a brothel, but as shown on TV (and the books explained more explicitly) he just came for a prostitute to lay with him and hold him tenderly - the Unsullied were taken from their parents and families, and never knew basic physical intimacy. They are still capable of making emotional attachments to other people now that they are free. When Daenerys asked why Stalwart Shield/White Rat would go to a brothel like this in the novels, Grey Worm responded that

    As for the physical mechanics of the Grey Worm/Missandei sex scene, in which he performs cunnilingus on her, this brings up several points about
    gender and sexuality
    in the fictional world of Westeros and beyond. The real-life Middle Ages didn't actually have the same categorization scheme of sexuality that industrialized 20th century society had: rather than a heterosexual/homosexual dichotomy, they had a penetrator/penetrated dichotomy (or top/bottom). Their definition of "sex" was very phallocentric due to being a male-dominated society, with an all-male priesthood dictating social mores. As a result, as confirmed by medieval scholarship, medieval society didn't conceptually recognize cunnilingus as "sex" because no one was being penetrated with a penis - though in contrast, fellatio
    <i key="f4665437-45f0-4faf-ab68-cc614c2c0d31">
     was
    </i>
    considered "sex" because penetration with a penis was involved. That doesn't mean that people didn't do it, but they just considered it foreplay, etc. One result of this is that they had very little conception of female homosexuality, even to condemn it, because they didn't consider it "actual sex".

       On the other hand

      , Westeros is different from the real Middle Ages in several respects, and they apparently

       do

      priesthood of both men and women (such as Septa
      Unella
      ). These women, as full priests, also write religious dictates on sexual morality, and they would understand that women can achieve sexual pleasure without a penis but other means. The novels

       does

      recognize female homosexuality (and frowns upon it). The Faith wouldn't officially criticize female homosexuality in Westeros unless their society considers "sex without a penis" (such as cunnilingus performed by a eunuch or another woman) as "actual sex". Thus,

A few years later they returned and captured all of its castles and towns, but the Dornish launched a brutal guerrilla war against their occupation forces. The Targaryens responded by burning any castle which rose against them with dragonfire, but the Dornish armies would flee when the dragons came and return as soon as they left. When Queen

The writers actually admit in the Blu-ray commentary for that episode that Drogon was able to be wounded with spears in that attack because he was just a juvenile at the time - which is true. Dragons' scales get thicker and harder as they age, until

      dragons' scales are practically impervious to swords, spears, or projectiles. Contrary to myth, a dragon's underbelly isn't any more soft or exposed than the rest of its hide: the eyes are the only weak spot on an adult dragon, the only part of them that isn't covered by their armored scales. There are historical examples of juvenile dragons being injured with human weapons, but the only thing that can pierce an adult dragon's hide is really another dragon. After Meraxes died, subsequent wars involving dragons did shift tactics to try to aim for their eyes with heavy projectiles - but the dragon-riders were very wary of this as well, so they were more careful to make quick bombing-runs on ground targets and evade projectile fire. A major example is the
      Siege of Rook's Rest

    blog made an update post for this episode, explaining that all of the dragon skulls in the Cersei scene are real props, not CGI. First, the art department made 3D sculptures, then the props department made full-sized skulls based on them out of polystyrene. Head sculptor Darren Fitzsimons stated that the prop of
    Balerion
    's skull is "about 30 feet long, 11 feet high, and 16 feet wide," and it took his team six weeks just to sculpt it (before painting and plastering). They kept a real sheep skull in their office as a comparison when making the surface texture.
    In the books, it is said that Balerion was so large that he could comfortably swallow a war-horse

    Notice that the dragon skulls are all different sizes, because they died at different ages - one of them is even no larger than a dog's head. Several characters have remarked in prior seasons (as in the books) that the dragon skulls got increasingly smaller the more recent they were - implying that younger generations of dragons got stunted through inbreeding.

    Last dragon
    was indeed a stunted, sickly, inbred creature who died young, not much bigger than a dog. In Season 1, Viserys mentioned to Doreah that the more recent dragon skulls were smaller until the last was no bigger than a dog's, and in Season 4, Tywin repeated this information, dismissing that the last dragon's head was the size of "an apple" (exaggerating), though Joffrey pointed out that the oldest skull was the size of a carriage.

    , he lived to be two centuries old before he died (of old age, one of the only Targaryen dragons to do so). Decades-old dragons like Balerion were practically invincible, with scales harder than steel - Qyburn's scorpion-bolt would have no hope of penetrating them, only piercing his eyes.

      Even compared to earlier Targaryen dragons, Daenerys's dragons are growing unusually fast (possibly due to the resurgence of magic in the world they brought), because it sometimes took a decade or two for them to reach a size at which they could be ridden. This is a discrepancy even in the books, however, and the vague explanation used to handwave it is that, much like individual dogs, individual dragons just grow at their own rates unique to each one.

He felt reviewers who say this dislike the character of Sansa and fail to assess that Sansa's counterpoints are just as valid as Jon's. Cogman also states that Sansa raised her objections during the council meeting in "Stormborn" because Jon did not consult her in private before publicly announcing his decision. The following is a transcript of the relevant exchange from this interview:

      Cogman: " - She's 'undermining' him? I mean, so? He's only been king like a week. And everyone's like, 'oh, she's undermining him in public'? Well, let's think about it for a second. He has just walked in there and said Aegon[sic] Targaryen's daughter has arrived with what are essentially nukes, invited him to come down, and he's going to go. It's a crazy, risky plan! And his reasoning is sound, but her reasoning for being like 'what the hell is wrong with you?' is sound. And why shouldn't she raise it there, you know, he didn't bother to consult her in private before the meeting. So I feel like I get defensive of her. And also, this is something that's important to remember, she's just a kid. He's a kid. They're kids thrust into these leadership positions. And it's messy, and their relationship as brother and sister is messy and complicated. So I guess she could have used some more tact, but a) it's not as fun to write or perform, and b) she loves him, she tries to stop him because she thinks he's risking his life.

Despite Jon unknowingly being Ned's nephew as opposed to his son, Sansa's statement is still correct: Jon is the son of Ned's sister Lyanna, so either way, Rickard was still his grandfather by blood, albeit through his mother rather than through his father (on that side, Jon's paternal grandfather is Aerys II Targaryen, meaning that his paternal grandfather was responsible for the death of his maternal grandfather).

    is shown as being an active "political player" (in the "game of thrones") and making political arguments on her own that affect large-scale strategies. In the preceding episode, she argued for giving the lands of the Karstarks and Umbers to new Houses while Jon argued for letting the children of the Karstark and Umbers retain their family lands as they had no part in their fathers' crimes. In this episode, Sansa makes an argument against Jon leaving for Dragonstone because Daenerys's father killed their grandfather, while other Starks who have gone south face perilous situations. Jon accepts the mission as a risk and does not want to leave the North, but he stands by his decision to go to Dragonstone as it is their best chance to get the weapons and allies needed to defend the North against the Long Night and he is the only one present who has experienced the threat they are all facing.
    Jon appoints Sansa as his regent, giving charge of the North to Sansa while he is gone, and Sansa accepts the responsibility. This marks the first time Sansa is officially in charge of anything politically.

    , the first time that King Aerys showed himself in public in many years. At this event, everyone in attendance was stunned to see how visibly insane the king had become, randomly switching from rage to laughter to crying without provocation, reacting to hallucinations that weren't there, and his physical appearance had deteriorated into ropes of matted hair and inches-long fingernails. Thus Lord Royce can say with validity that he remembers the Mad King, from personal observation, not just that he heard second-hand news about his atrocities or fought Targaryen forces in the war.

Apparently, he was at least informed off-screen that Jon is King in the North now (it's common knowledge across Westeros at this point, even Hot Pie knew at the inn when Arya came), so he sent his letters directly to Winterfell - there's no indication that they were sent to Castle Black first.

    , with its continent-spanning empire, judged this to be the largest concentration of dragonglass in the known world - that's why they created a colony there to begin with.

    Dave Hill
    gave an interview a few days before this episode aired in which he stated that was indeed an official change in the TV continuity: in the books, dragonglass only kills White Walkers. Wights can only effectively be destroyed by fire; dismembering them is ineffective, as Jon found out while fighting Othor (in the book), for the severed body parts continue fighting independently. Hill didn't give a reason why this change was made - possibly because it would be too difficult to work with large numbers of stuntmen actually being set on fire (while wearing protective layers); changing it so that dragonglass works on wights as well allows for more manageable fight choreography. Hill said that this change was introduced during the
    Battle at the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven

      In the books, Sam discovers by trial-and-error that dragonglass is ineffective against wights and fire is effective. On the way to Castle Black, a wight attacks him and Gilly (in the show it was replaced with an Other). Sam stabs the wight with a dragonglass dagger, but it shatters to pieces. Sam stabs the wight with his steel dagger, but it just bounces off the wight's iron mail (it would hardly matter even if the wight was not armored - at best Sam could cut a limb of it, and it wouldn't stop the wight). Desperately, Sam grabs a burning piece of wood and shoves it into the wight's mouth, immediately causing the whole creature to burst into flame and be destroyed. Later, Sam tells Melisandre about the anomaly, that what kills Others (White Walkers) is ineffective against wights. She explained, "

    part in Eddard's death). It's possible that Sansa told Jon more of Littlefinger's treachery off-screen, but even Sansa isn't aware of the full extent of Littlefinger's crimes - she knows that he continued to serve the Lannisters, but only to later betray them by killing Joffrey. Littlefinger makes it clear that he loves Sansa, but adds "as I loved her mother", likely giving Jon the (quite truthful) impression that he harbors (unrequited) lustful feelings towards Sansa, and prompting Jon to threaten Littlefinger with death if he touches Sansa. Additionally, Jon is aware Littlefinger is responsible for Sansa's marriage to

    , the man who raped and abused Sansa - one of Jon's younger sisters. Littlefinger's part in Sansa's suffering at the hands of the Boltons and his implied intentions towards the only family Jon knows he has left are certainly enough to send Jon into a rage. As seen in Season 2's "Garden of Bones", Littlefinger can get a little too enthusiastic about his desire for Catelyn/Sansa when talking about it, letting his act slip enough that his stalker-crush becomes apparent to other people.

      In many cases (but not all), a monarch would normally send an envoy, as Sansa suggested; if the monarch goes himself, it may give the impression that he is lesser than the monarch who invited him. Robb acted that way by sending his mother Catelyn to Renly Baratheon's camp rather than going himself. Additionally, there is the possibility that Daenerys hates Jon's House for supporting Robert Baratheon against her father. In the books, Daenerys feels that way (due to her brother Viserys's skewed narratives), and has not changed her mind yet.

As such, he has the most information and will need this information when he explains the situation to Daenerys in an effort to form an alliance with her against the Night King as opposed to an envoy who has not seen or experienced the Night King or his army. A few other people have seen the Night King and survived the attack at Hardhome: Tormund, Tormund's wildlings, Dolorous Edd, and a few Night's Watch members, but they are not at Winterfell and are on other missions. Samwell and Gilly have seen White Walkers and Sam fought one, but they are south in Oldtown. Even if Jon could send them, he would risk insulting Daenerys by sending such an envoy when she asked to meet with Jon in person. Jon is afraid enough of the Night King that he's willing to risk anything to convince Daenerys to ally with him.

      . At the inn, the owner gave Hot Pie a job as a cook due to his skill at it (as he was a baker's apprentice). Not being martially skilled, he felt Arya's dangerous journey wasn't really for him. Though he stayed behind, they wished each other well.

      Hot Pie refers to the fact that Arya disguised herself as a boy while she was with the Night's Watch recruits (on Yoren's instruction), as the Watch doesn't take female members. Arya was around 11 going on 12 years old then so she was able to pass for a boy - Hot Pie is a bit hard on himself by saying Arya's too pretty to be mistaken for a boy

        This is the first time in the show that someone tells Arya she is pretty. In the books, Arya was not considered to be traditionally beautiful, in contrast to her sister who is widely acclaimed for her classic beauty. Eddard and Jon are the only ones to tell Arya she is pretty. Because Arya is a tomboy, interested in more traditionally masculine pursuits, and didn't mind getting dirt on herself, she earned nicknames such as "Arya Underfoot" and "Arya Horseface". However, as the novels go on, characters begin to notice Arya's growing beauty as she matures. This is similar to Lyanna. Eddard has remarked that Arya looks like Lyanna at her age, and Lyanna grew up to be very beautiful.

      Similarly, Hot Pie still refers to Arya as "Arry", the boy's name she adopted as part of her disguise. It is the name that Hot Pie knew her by for a long time, though by the time they parted in Season 3, he knew she was really Arya Stark. Of course, Hot Pie also has an ongoing habit of mixing up names, so continuing to call her "Arry" out of habit fits his character.

      Arya says bids farewell to Hot Pie by saying, "Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed" - even though he is in the relatively safe position of working as a baker at an inn (albeit the ongoing war is ravaging the countryside). Hot Pie confidently responds that he's like her, he's a survivor. Apparently, this exchange is an in-joke at how Hot Pie has managed to survive all the way from Season 1 to Season 7 - despite not even being a Starring Cast member or important lord, but just a

      . Of 19 human characters introduced in Season 1 who are still alive, only three were never promoted to "Starring Cast" on the show: Sweetrobin Arryn, Ilyn Payne, and Hot Pie. Not being as socially important as the other two (who are nobles), there was never any guarantee that Hot Pie would survive from one episode to the next (even less than the Starring cast on

    In behind the scenes videos from prior seasons, the showrunners said that Arya was losing herself in violence and revenge, but several major critics assessed that Arya's mental state wasn't visibly affected despite the number of people she killed. In this episode, however, much of this consequence is shown: Arya's reunion scene with Hot Pie depicts her as numb and emotionally dissociated, still somewhat detached after just killing several

The Lannister soldiers she ran into last episode weren't in a position to tell her about it either, because they were out in the field (they pointed out that they were common soldiers and didn't have messenger-ravens, and weren't in communication with their home castles).

    The merchants in the background of the inn remark that if Daenerys besieges King's Landing, food prices will triple, provided that they get to the city before the siege starts and everyone starves. The same thing happened at the beginning of the War of the Five Kings, with food shortages leading to the

When the Tyrells were supporting Renly, the Starks and Lannisters were fighting over the Riverlands, and Stannis was blockading sea shipments, King's Landing was cut off from its major food suppliers, reduced to just a trickle from the immediate lordships of the Crownlands. The books went into this in some more detail, with Tyrion explicitly noting that drastic hyperinflation was setting in at the food markets - one Gold Dragon coin, which before the war was worth a knight's horse (the medieval equivalent of a nice automobile), could now only buy six skinny piglets or a side of beef; in the first novel a baker in King's Landing told Arya that a loaf of bread coast 3 Copper Pennies, but when Tyrion visits the same market in the second novel, 6 Copper Pennies can only buy one melon.

      There are more hints in the novels about Nymeria's survival and activities in the intervening books, which are peppered with sporadic reports that an unusually large wolf is leading a growing wolf pack in the Riverlands, feasting on the slain after battles and harassing farmsteads. Common wolves fear men and will avoid them whenever possible, but the huge Nymeria has no fear of man and leads her pack on bold attacks for food - catching their targets unprepared, who are used to just having to scare off wolves instead of fighting them outright.

    to being "Arya Stark". In both the books and novels, a running theme with Arya is her loss of identity: how she keeps adopting new fake names to hide her identity (i.e. Arry the refugee boy, among more in the books) until she is adopting fake personas in her

    and decides to come home. Arya is still slowly pulling back from her adopted personas and remembering herself before the war began: in this episode, Hot Pie calls her "Arry" multiple times throughout their scene but she doesn't correct him. Only when she sees Nymeria does she outright state her identity as "It's me, Arya".

    In the Inside the Episode video

It was a direct callback to the Season 1 scene in which her own father Ned said that she's grown up to be a proper lady and rule over a castle, but Arya said, "That's not me" - she wanted to keep being a tomboy and learning to use a sword. She wasn't denying it was Nymeria that she saw - as the showrunners state, what Arya meant was she realized and accepted that, like herself, a direwolf can't be tamed, Nymeria has her own life now with her wolf pack, and she can't expect her to give that up to come back with Arya.

    It is unclear why Sam gave Jorah rum as an anesthetic, rather than
    milk of the poppy
    , which is commonly used in Westeros for that purpose (it is their version of morphine). Even without any medical background, Sam should have known that. It's possible that he couldn't take any without being noticed when Ebrose forbid from trying the experimental treatment - though this wouldn't explain how he did manage to acquire all of his surgical tools and ingredients to make the anti-greyscale medical ointment.

      An explanation could be that the access to milk of the poppy is limited and strongly supervised, like in modern days the access to morphine for everyone in a hospital.

    Cressen
    (though it left her face scarred). Ebrose counters by pointing out information also from the books: that greyscale can rarely be cured in infants or children, but not adults, and only if it is treated fairly early - Shireen was a baby and it was treated early, but Jorah is an adult with an advanced case, and thus beyond known treatment. Ebrose also says that Jorah should have cut his arm off to stop the spread (which sometimes works but often doesn't), and the only remaining option (besides suicide) would be to ship Jorah to the ruins of
    Old Valyria
    with the
    Stone Men
    . Ebrose also says that greyscale takes years to actually kill someone, leaving them in great pain for perhaps 10 to 20 years. The loose figures given in the novels are around 5 to 10 years, though it is not unheard of for someone to live 20 years with it. The novels only vaguely mention that when the infection grows inwards and starts warping the flesh of the brain, it can drive victims to madness, without giving a time scale for it; in this episode, Ebrose thinks Jorah might have only 6 months at best before he goes crazy from it (and he was infected nearly 2 years before).

Jorah is in a great deal of pain in this episode - though Sam says he's cutting through the greyscale scars, down to the next layer of

Ellaria responds that there is a boy in every port in Dorne, which Yara responds, "A boy, a girl. Depends on the port." This implies, but doesn't confirm, Yara has had sex with men and women.

In the books, the ironborn are noted for wearing heavy armor plate into battle on the high seas - which no one else does, because if they get knocked into the water they won't be able to swim.

    In a post-premiere interview, writer Bryan Cogman stated that there was truly no way Theon could save Yara even if he tried to at this point by the end of the battle, with the fight clearly lost and badly outnumbered. Theon would have died if he tried to save Yara, and all three of them knew it (Theon, Yara, Euron). However, Cogman explained, particularly in ironborn culture, they value bravery as warriors, and think the right thing would have been for Theon to self-consciously fight to the death trying to defend her, rather than retreat.

      Showrunners Benioff and Weiss in the Inside the Episode video also comment that Euron's men mutilating all of the corpses on the ship is very triggering for Theon, and Euron's threats of violence, and they actually admit that it would have been unrealistic for Theon to quickly overcome his massive trauma and PTSD symptoms after his torture by Ramsay Bolton.

      Euron has a chameleon-like behavior in both the books and TV series, adopting different personas as the need arises: braggadocious and crass with his low-brow soldiers, swaggering and charming to Cersei, etc.; when it comes to battles, however, he prefers to stay safely at the rear, sending others to fight - and afterwards he takes the whole credit to himself. He did not even have the guts to kill Balon by his own hands (it is implied he hired an assassin of the Faceless Men for that purpose). He does show his "bravery" against those who are too weak to resist him, among them four of his brothers (Harlon, Robin, Aeron and Urrigon) and captives that his subordinates have taken.

    Euron leaves Obara's corpse impaled on the prow of her ship with her own spear, and Nymeria's corpse hanging from the prow by her own whip. In the books, Euron is indeed very fond of tormenting prisoners by lashing them to the prows of his ships, before going into battle and ramming enemy vessels.
