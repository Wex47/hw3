She offers them a choice - bend the knee and join her in her quest to make the world a better place than ever before, or refuse and die. Tyrion looks at her apprehensively upon hearing this. Only a few kneel at first; Drogon, apparently insulted by their refusal to accept his mother's command, bellows at them and most quickly yield. However,

   Daenerys signals for three Dothraki men to apprehend him, but Dickon suddenly speaks up insisting he will have to be killed too. Randyll, horrified, tries to silence his son. Tyrion reminds Dickon that he is the future of House Tarly and insists that he submit, reminding him what happened to House Tyrell. Randyll silently nods in agreement to Dickon, indicating his tactic approval to his heir to bend the knee so Dickon may be spared. Dickon refuses to relent on his decision. Tyrion proposes to Daenerys about having them committed to the cells for a time instead, but Daenerys, being ruthless but pragmatic, does not wish to grant the reputation of putting traitors in chains, or many would take advantage. She resumes her sentencing for them both, as they hold hands. Drogon unleashes his dragonfire, burning Randyll and Dickon alive and reducing them both to flame and ash in seconds, killing them instantly. Terrified, the remaining soldiers instantly kneel as Tyrion reflects uneasily over the execution.

However, Sansa insists Jon Snow is their true ruler who is doing what he believes is right for their people and that she is his regent. Following the meeting, Sansa confides her frustration in the Northern lords with Arya, who calls Sansa out for diplomatically handling their concerns instead of shutting the lords down. Arya thinks that she should not let the lords get away with insulting Jon and hints at assassinating them. Sansa disagrees, at which Arya calls attention to the fact that Sansa is using their parents' chambers and that she still thinks she's better than anyone else – perhaps she even thinks that she will need the support of the northern lords if she wishes to seize the North for herself, even if she tries not to think of it. Disturbed at her younger sister's homicidal streak and hurt by the accusations, Sansa tells Arya that she has "work to do."

   Davos, as the only one who might be able to smuggle Tyrion into King's Landing, reluctantly agrees, but also thinks such a mission is risky even for a smuggler like him. Jorah volunteers to go north to help capture a Wight while Jon volunteers to lead the expedition, since the Free Folk won't follow Jorah and he is the only one who has the most experience facing their enemy. Apparently on the verge of tears about the idea of Jon leaving, Daenerys responds that she did not give Jon permission to leave but Jon reminds her that he is the King in the North. He tells her she has the power of life and death over him but that he trusted her even though she was a stranger. He pleads with her to return the favor by trusting him.

Jon playfully quips to Daenerys that if their mission is unsuccessful and he doesn’t return she at least won’t have to deal with the King in the North anymore. Dany responds that she’s "grown used to him", hinting that she may have feelings for him. Jon wishes her good fortune in the wars to come before he leaves. Dany and Tyrion watch as Jon Snow and his party depart on their boats for Eastwatch.

Jaime sees no other path to victory; Tyrion now stands against his own siblings with a foreign invader possessed of a large, fearsome army and three ferocious dragons. Cersei dismisses his protests, however, making it plain she intends to fight to the death rather than surrender her throne, and expects the same from Jaime and the rest of the Lannister military.

The guards are satisfied, if slightly disgusted, with Davos's explanation and bribe and prepare to depart, but Tyrion arrives at that exact moment; realizing it's too late to turn back and not look suspicious, Tyrion walks past them to the boat while looking downward.

This metaphor hasn't been used in the novels, and indeed, the idea that Daenerys has some grand hope of reforming all of society is an invention of the TV series - she does want to stop things like slavery and overthrow bad rulers, but fundamentally, she does want to be the hereditary monarch over everyone else.

      In the books, such attitudes are not entirely without precedent, specifically during the later
      Blackfyre Rebellions
      . The first rebellion was a civil war fought by internal factions in Westeros, but after
      House Blackfyre
      lost, its survivors fled into exile in the Free Cities, and for the next 50 years they sporadically launched four subsequent rebellions. While there they founded the

       Golden Company
      </a>
      to be their core fighting force (which Cersei actually mentioned in the previous episode). By the fourth rebellion, forty years after the first, they were surprised to have very little support from within Westeros itself - even noble Houses who

      Daemon I Blackfyre

      Note the contrast between Randyll's attitudes towards Daenerys, and how other characters are judged by the reputation of their fathers, such as Jorah Mormont and Gendry. Samwell and Jon felt that they owed Jorah simply because

      </a>
      saved their lives, while Tormund was angry at Jorah for his father fighting the wildlings. Jon trusts Gendry because their fathers were allies. Other characters outright condemn Daenerys as "the Mad King's daughter" without even knowing her. For Randyll, however, Daenerys's lineage meant nothing either way - with no loyalty to her father's rule
      <i key="788365e0-0dfa-4998-a7a3-cb8301f886df">

     <li key="98bcff3f-c7ed-42f1-89d3-4ef46f0a3bb8">
      Randyll Tarly also makes it clear that he won't submit to Daenerys because he is disgusted with Tyrion - a man who, admittedly, killed

      Randyll brings up
      Tywin's death
      , and his own death is in notable contrast with it. When Tyrion confronted Tywin with a crossbow while he was on the privy, he started trying to explain his way out of the situation, then daring Tyrion on, thinking Tyrion couldn't possibly kill him, despite all of the abuse he had heaped upon him. Randyll, meanwhile, faces death with dignity, and would rather die than accept Tyrion's offer to try to have his life spared by taking the black. Moreover, Tywin mistreated his son so badly his entire life that it ultimately drove his son to kill him, while when Randyll is executed, his son Dickon

     Mad King
    </a>
    , who burned his enemies alive in the throne room. In the Inside the Episode video, showrunner David Benioff said that Daenerys isn't supposed to be outright vindictive or crazy, but ruthlessly rational, and it's supposed to be unclear if she or Tyrion are correct. In her view, she gave Tarly a fair choice about whether to surrender or not, several chances to bend the knee and he refused knowing what would happen, and his execution helped convince other wavering Lannister survivors to bend the knee.

     <li key="525e0137-1e3c-49b5-b745-19bba7dd86fa">
      It seem unfair to compare Daenerys's actions to those of her father, as the Mad King was a sadist who enjoyed the suffering of his victims, in the books he is even described as being sexually aroused by their suffering while they were being burned. In contrast, Daenerys only uses fire as a means to an end, to show her power over dragons and prompt her enemies to bend the knee like Aegon did during the Conquest of Westeros centuries before her. She is not taking any pleasure in their death, as highlighted by how her utterance of "Dracarys" is more solemn and soft than usual. By the same token, execution by dragon-fire, while "longer" and more painful than a simple beheading, is still swifter than burning someone at the stake and letting the fires slowly consume them, which the Mad King was known to do. Simply put, it took Randyll and Dickon far less time to die than Rickard Stark. Such subtleties, however, might have escaped from the spectators. Perhaps it would have been preferable for Daenerys to execute Randyll and Dickon by beheading, to make a point without being associated with her father.

      </a>
      - which has always been customary for defeated lords in Westeros for centuries. It's unknown if Daenerys would have given him the option or not, but it's a moot point, because Randyll then interjected that he wouldn't join the Night's Watch even if she did extend the offer.

      Tyrion's suggestion to imprison Randyll, hoping that spending several weeks in jail will make him change his mind about surrendering, is perhaps a reference to the way Jon deals with Arnolf Karstark's son Cregan in the fifth novel. After learning from Alys about Arnolf's treachery toward Stannis and when Cregan comes to Castle Black to forcibly take Alys away against her will, Jon imprisons Cregan, who did come to forcibly take Alys so he could marry her to Arnolf against her will. Jon gives Cregan a chance to yield; Cregan refuses, makes idle threats and claims he will never yield. Jon decides not to kill Cregan (because the Watch is supposed to remain neutral in respect of political affairs of the realm), and keeps him imprisoned, after warning him that spending time in an ice cell will make him change his mind; if he does not, Stannis will execute him.

     <li key="dc824e5a-31bc-4711-9293-2661036a8047">

      in that count either, even though Ellaria and the three Sand Snakes have been dispatched as well. There are two possible scenarios, which the TV writers may have simply never devoted thought to: the first is that this confirms the younger Sand Snakes are in fact alive, but doesn't explain why they don't just send Dorne's armies to help Daenerys. The second possibly is that, being bastards, Ellaria and the Sand Snakes were not considered to be "House Martell", and that like the Baratheons, Tyrion considers "House Martell" (Doran and Trystane) to have been killed off in the preceding War of the Five Kings. Ultimately, the situation in Dorne remains unconfirmed.

    Sansa argues with Arya about how to handle the Northern and Vale lords - with Arya bluntly saying she thinks a few executions for treason would keep them in line, while Sansa says that there's more to "ruling" than that, and beheadings aren't how you get people to work together, combining their strength towards a common goal. This has shadows of Sansa's original Vale story arc in the novels - which Season 4 seemed to be setting up, only to then merge Sansa into the Bolton storyline in the north (in which

Instead, Sansa stays in the Vale with Littlefinger, gradually winning over the support of more and more of the Vale lords, through a combination of bribes, funding younger sons to take over Houses that won't come over to their side, and various other subtle political manipulations.

      No one knows exactly what will be revealed about Rhaegar in future novels, but a major theory is that Rhaegar simply intended to polygamously marry Lyanna Stark as his second wife. The Valyrians were known to practice polygamy, and in the original Conquest-generation of the Targaryens, Aegon the Conqueror was

      later warred with his son

      was a potential explanation for why
      Daemon I Blackfyre
      went to war with his brother out of love for his half-sister, even though he was already married to someone else. An in-universe theory that several historians have is that Daemon simply intended to revive the Targaryen custom of polygamy - or somehow, thought he could get away with it despite it being banned for nearly 200 years. It's possible that Rhaegar, like Daemon Blackfyre, thought he could get away with polygamy in secret. In which case, Rhaegar's "annulment" of his marriage to Elia would be a drastic oversimplification of what really happened in the books.

      for a lord getting an "annulment" from a wife who already gave him a male heir - it is impossible, as this would be a "divorce" - and thus there is no precedent for what would happen to Rhaegar's two children by that first marriage. It's possible that the TV writers simply didn't think out the implications of this change. Rhaegar could only ask for an "annulment" by claiming that Elia's first two children weren't actually fathered by him - but there's no evidence he claimed that either. Given that this might not even occur in the novels,
      <b key="1482dcfb-cc60-4138-a755-8589663c81f2">
       it is unclear if Aegon and Rhaenys should be treated as bastards or not
      </b>
      (be it Targaryen or Martell bastards), or if the TV writers still intend for them to be Rhaegar's legitimate children. Ironically, this causes so many contradictions that it would have been easier to quickly explain that Rhaegar wanted a second, polygamous marriage.
     </li>
     <li key="903ec94d-b898-4b3d-a0e8-dcb5889bf249">
      In the novels, Elia Martell is believed to be barren after the difficult births of her two children. Rhaegar could possibly use this as an argument despite the fact that his wife already gave him a suitable heir. Rhaegar believed that "
      The Prince That Was Promised
      " prophecy was, in fact, referring to a triarchy of Targaryens and needed another child. Thus it wouldn't make sense for Rhaegar to de-legitimize his first two children, when he wanted a set of three.
     </li>
     <li key="bdbd8d5c-5cb4-4ba1-b0d9-d2ddbbdecaf9">
      Moreover, if Rhaegar did secretly get an annulment in the books, it was also a poor political move as the Martells were staunch allies of House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion due to one of their own being part of House Targaryen through marriage. Given that the Martells were furious at Rhaegar for humiliating Elia twice in public (at the tourney of Harrenhal and by "kidnapping" Lyanna), it is likely that repudiating his wife and consequently disowning his Targaryen/Martell children would have enraged the Martells much more, had they discovered it. The fact of almost certainly losing the allegiance of a key ally in a time of war, could explain why Rhaegar kept it secret

    . Rhaegar was Daenerys's older brother, so as Rhaegar's lawful son, "Jon Snow" ranks ahead of her in the line of succession - he even ranked ahead of Rhaegar's younger brother Viserys. This also means that his legal surname is in fact "Targaryen". Lyanna's dying words to Eddard in the Season 6 finale flashback also all but stated that "Jon" isn't even his real first name, that his parents intended for him, but a cover name that Eddard came up with (apparently Jon's real name is obviously a Targaryen-style one).

    sourcebook,
    specifically devoted to the TV series saying Rhaegar got an "annulment". While acknowledging that no one currently knows exactly what Rhaegar did, they heavily criticized the idea that he got an "annulment", and suspect it is an extreme condensation of the TV series - one that creates more plot holes than it solves, for all the above reasons: they strongly suspect that Rhaegar
    <i key="a4003bbb-28cb-4508-b6cf-7cc3fb2dd5e1">
     polygamously
    </i>
    married Lyanna as a second wife, and "annulment" doesn't work like that in Westeros. They did, however, address several related points:

     <li key="a470f163-921b-466d-a48b-f806d32df03a">
      They suspected that this was an attempt by the showrunners to make no question of Jon Snow's legitimacy as Rhaegar's heir, when his claim would
      <i key="cf293898-278d-4ceb-9e3c-ea91c31aa070">
       always
      </i>
      be subject to question - even in this scenario for the TV series. The question of legitimacy was a frequent cause of major wars in the real Middle Ages, and both sides would often claim legal loopholes to try to discredit their rivals' legitimacy (i.e. Henry V claiming rule over France due to "Salic Law" inheritance). This isn't a matter of what is legalistically right - each side would try to interpret the situation to their benefit. If Rhaegar polygamously married Lyanna, Jon's enemies would say that this marriage was unlawful (because the Faith has never acknowledged them). Rhaegar annulling his marriage to Elia first wouldn't solve this problem - Jon's enemies can just claim that Rhaegar's
      <i key="d77c0dc5-e93a-41f2-a5c5-aef0adb8abfe">

      was unlawful (making his second marriage bigamous and Jon a bastard).
     </li>
     <li key="6b0965c3-c46e-4363-988a-4de897da9805">
      They reaffirmed that "annulment" doesn't work like this in Westeros: it isn't given to a man whose wife already produced heirs for him (like how in real life, Henry VIII wanted to annul/divorce Katherine of Aragon even though she already gave him a daughter). It has been repeatedly explained even in the TV series that Sansa's marriage to Tyrion can be set aside specifically because it was never consummated. It would have been easier to just claim that divorce exists in Westeros in the TV continuity.
     </li>
     <li key="2a5634af-4c27-45ac-8659-738551eff42f">
      In real life, laws about divorce, bastardy, and legitimacy changed considerably over the course of the Middle Ages: in earlier centuries little emphasis was put on issues of bastardy, but as the Catholic Church grew in power and stressed it, this became a major issue for succession law by the 1400's (and the War of the Five Kings is based on the Wars of the Roses from the 1400's). English Common Law diverged from the "Canon Law" of the Church which was followed in the rest of Western Europe, however, and Martin has remarked that Westeros's laws and customs are loosely inspired by English Common Law. Many people who were considered legitimate under Canon Law were considered bastards under English Common Law. Under Common Law, if someone's parents only married after they were born, they were still a bastard; moreover, unlike modern "divorce", under Common Law, and "annulment" retroactively meant that the marriage was never real, and thus any lawful children produced in a marriage that got annulled were retroactively declared bastards.

     <li key="af2a46b2-bd07-4f89-9ce9-b778a4abb94d">
      At the same time, Elio and Linda point out that Westeros's laws don't

       exactly

      work like English Common Law when it comes to this: there are cited examples of children born out of wedlock who

       were
      </i>
      legitimized upon the subsequent marriage of their parents, which isn't how English Common Law works. Westeros in some ways puts much more emphasis on legitimacy: the real Middle Ages never branded bastard children with a series of special surnames the way that Westeros uses "Snow" and "Sand". They also acknowledge that the Crown is more powerful than the Faith in Westeros, when it was often the other way around in Medieval Europe: the King on the Iron Throne unquestionably has the power to legitimize bastard children, without input by the Faith, while in Medieval Europe a King had to get special permission from the Church to do so.
      Aegon IV Targaryen
      , the Unworthy, famously
      legitimized
      all of his bastard children right before his death - Rhaegar could, plausibly, have just had Jon Snow declared a legitimized bastard (either by his father or waiting until he succeeded him as king) - and this might even be what he did in the novels (without necessarily marrying Lyanna), but the TV series may have shied away from this because Jon's status as a "legitimized bastard" puts into question if he really outranks Daenerys in the line of succession.

The matter is somewhat academic given that both children died before Jon was even born, but it does affect how Rhaegar exactly intended to deal with his Dornish allies: annulling Elia and rendering her children bastards would have made them abandon him or even start a war. At best, if Rhaegar practiced polygamy and took Lyanna as his second wife but declared that Elia's son would still be his heir, the Martells would not be happy given that Lyanna's children could potentially try to undermine Elia's.

The parallels between the two scenes are intriguing, but little more can be definitively said. In the final version, it somewhat seems that Qyburn is talking to Cersei about symptoms from her heavy

      In the novels, the relationship between Cersei and Jaime has turned sour to such extent that each of them contemplates about disposing of the other. Moreover, Lancel's tearful confession makes Jaime realize that Tyrion's last words about Cersei's promiscuity are true, and that she is guilty of all the crimes she is charged with (among them the murders of Robert and the previous High Septon). Jaime severs his relationship with Cersei symbolically by burning her distress message. Thus, even if in the novels Cersei is pregnant and Jaime (who has not returned yet to King's Landing) is informed about it, it may not make any difference to him.

    It seems strange that Cersei knew Tyrion was in her grasp - but did not seize the opportunity to capture him. A likely reason was that she was biding her time. As even she admits to Jaime in dialogue that their recent defeat means she's too afraid to openly challenge Daenerys: killing Daenerys's Hand would likely have provoked her into attacking King's Landing. Moreover, Cersei explained that she correctly guessed Tyrion would only have risked returning in order to offer some sort of truce, which she desperately needs to stall for time to come up with a better plan.

      Subtlety like this, agreeing to a truce in order to make a long term plan relying on intrigue like Tywin, is somewhat uncharacteristic of Cersei. In the fourth book(Seasons 5 and 6), Cersei comes up with a series of crude, ill-planned schemes, without any consideration of long-range applications, all of which somehow go wrong. It is beyond her to plot a clever scheme like Tywin would come up with, because, as Jaime commented, she has wits but no judgement and no patience. If she had an opportunity to capture Tyrion in the books, she probably wouldn't miss it even if she could accomplish more by waiting for a better opportunity. It is entirely possible though that Cersei has simply learned her lesson from her experiences with the High Sparrow and realized that she can't use short-term schemes anymore.

This is a bit of nuance from the books that is difficult to convey on-screen: in Tyrion's POV narration chapters, he repeatedly remarks aloud that he intends to kill Jaime (though near the end of the fifth novel it is implied he starts changing his mind).

      Cersei, on the other hand, figures out in the novels that the Tyrells are responsible. Annoyed at Margaery's growing influence over Tommen, Cersei suddenly realizes the Tyrells had a strong motive to kill Joffrey: he was too stubborn to be influenced, in sharp contrast to his sweet gentle brother, so the Tyrells had him replaced with Tommen, whom Margaery could easily control as a puppet king. Cersei's additional conclusions, however, are entirely wrong: she believes that Tyrion - not Littlefinger - was the Tyrells' co-conspirator; that the Tyrells helped him escape from prison by bribing the gaolers (that explains, in Cersei's mind, the Tyrell coin which Qyburn found in one of the gaolers' cell); that Tyrion and Sansa are hiding in Highgarden; and maybe the Tyrells were involved in Tywin's murder too. Those conclusions, combined with Cersei's paranoid delusions, drive her to execute her scheme against Margaery, which eventually backfires at her.

In the books, Thorne indeed arrived at King's Landing, but because he had alienated Tyrion while he was at Castle Black, Tyrion made him many days before finally giving him an audience. When he was finally received by Tyrion, the wight-hand had rotted away (from its constant thrashing) to the point that it couldn't move anymore and wasn't suitable proof. Tyrion teased Thorne as if he was talking nonsense, and sent him away - though the book makes a point that Tyrion thought it might be true, and if the messenger had not been Thorne, Tyrion might have treated him differently. The video heavily edits Weiss's comments, however, so he might have just been more broadly referring to the idea from the books of taking part of a wight south as evidence of their existence.

When questioned about this, Jon explicitly says that they know almost nothing about the wights, and he wants to capture a few so they can try to study them. Bowen Marsh and others, who have already grown displeased at Jon's conduct as the Lord Commander (especially about accepting the wildlings to the Watch), disapprove of the idea. The corpses, however, remain still, maybe because there are no Others nearby to reanimate them.
