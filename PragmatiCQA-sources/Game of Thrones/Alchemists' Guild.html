The damage is devastating, but Stannis continues his assault with his (significantly reduced) remaining forces.

This long steady decline was interspersed with two major resurgences during the past three hundred years: first during a long period of over two hundred years when they enjoyed Targaryen patronage, and then (after a fifty year gap caused by the fiasco with Aerion Targaryen) a second resurgence under the Mad King,

   three hundred years ago gave rise to a major resurgence of the order. Even at this point they no longer possessed all of the magical abilities that myths claimed they once did, but the Targaryens relied upon them to produce wildfire, as a special weapon on the battlefield which was more reliable than dragons. After the dragons died out in a major Targaryen civil war 150 years ago, the Targaryens became even more reliant upon wildfire, and the Alchemists enjoyed even more extensive royal patronage.

   The order entered into a final resurgence began about forty years ago, when King

   </a>
   succeeded to the throne, who became popularly known as "the Mad King". Aerys spiraled into insanity throughout his reign, and became increasingly obsessed with fire, particularly wildfire (the purest and hottest combustible substance known). This resurgence spanned the two decades of Aerys's reign, and while this period was brief, it not only undid the damage of the Aerion Brightflame incident but saw the Alchemists extend to high positions at court they have never had before. The pyromancers became the Mad King's trusted agents, as he began to frequently execute those he suspected of plotting against him by having them burned alive with wildfire. This only made even more lords oppose Aerys, which in turn created more suspected traitors whom Aerys felt he needed to burn.

   , and Aerys appointed another four in rapid succession before the war ended. In the final days of the rebellion, Aerys grew so frustrated with the third of these, Lord Qarlton Chelsted, that he had the pyromancers burn him alive with wildfire, and then appointed Wisdom Rossart himself to replace Chelsted as Hand of the King - though Rossart had functionally replaced any Hand as Aerys's closest advisor ever since Tywin left. Nonetheless, Rossart served as Hand for barely two weeks before the

   , killed both Aerys and Rossart. The TV series has not mentioned this, but over the next several days during the chaos of the Sack, Jaime proceeded to hunt down and kill the other leading Wisdoms of the Alchemists' Guild, to ensure that none with knowledge of the wildfire plot survived. These included Wisdom Belis and Wisdom Garigus. The loss of so many of their senior leaders at once severely hobbled the Alchemists' Guild for years to come.

   Aerys's penchant for burning people alive saw him make much use of the alchemists' skills, but King Robert had little use for them and they faded away in terms of power and influence after Aerys's death.
