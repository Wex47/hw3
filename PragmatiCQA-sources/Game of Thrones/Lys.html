   As with most of the Free Cities, Lys was founded as a colony of the

   . Due to the area's natural beauty and mild climate, the
   Valyrians
   established Lys as a retreat/resort. Since it was founded from scratch by the Freehold rather than being a conquered territory, Lys retains stronger Valyrian bloodlines than any of the other Free Cities. Even the

   often possess Valyrian features, including light-colored hair, skin, and eyes. The Valyrians themselves had platinum-blonde to silvery-white hair and purple eyes (as exemplified by the
   Targaryens
   ), though in the present-day common features associated with the Lysene are blonde hair and either blue, green or violet eyes. In contrast to Lys, the inhabitants of the city's great rival Myr tend to have dark hair, dark eyes and olive skin. Even the Targaryen rulers of

   sometimes looked towards Lys in search of wives and lovers, as much for their Valyrian blood as their beauty: Prince
   Daemon Targaryen
   , brother to King
   Viserys I
   , had a
   paramour
   from Lys, a dancer named Mysaria. King
   Viserys II
   had been married to Lady Larra Rogare from Lys in his youth, and had three children by her, including the later
   King Aegon IV
   , and the famous Prince
   Aemon the Dragonknight
   . King Aegon IV's last mistress, Serenei, came from Lys as well, and bore him a daughter named Shiera, whilst dying in childbirth.

    Slavery

   is legal in Lys and the city has a fairly large slave population, outnumbering freeborn citizens three to one. The pillow-houses of the city are far-famed, and they are known for producing the finest bed-slaves and
   prostitutes
   in the world. Beauty and blood purity are highly valued by the Lysene, who deliberately breed attractive slaves together in the hope that their offspring will be even more lovely and refined. Besides its bed-slaves and prostitutes, Lys is known for its production of tapestries, perfumes, and sweet wines. The alchemists of the city also produce two rare and deadly

Lys and Myr remained subservient to Volantis until the city overreached and launched an attack on Tyrosh. Myr rose in rebellion and an exiled Lysene lord liberated the city with the help of 100 warships loaned to him by Braavos. Additional forces from

   Lys regained its independence following the war, but the alliances soon fell apart, so that Myr and Lys have been perpetually warring with each other for the better part of the past three hundred years. The great rivalry of Myr and Lys is usually played out in the Disputed Lands between them, so-called because they are constantly changing hands between the two. Volantis and Tyrosh sometimes get dragged into these wars on one side or the other, as the alliances shift around.
