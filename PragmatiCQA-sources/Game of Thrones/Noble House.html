The most powerful vassal Houses may themselves field armies of a few thousand and control large regions, while the smallest Houses may be little more than impoverished landholders with only a few men to their name.

   has admitted that his system of nomenclature for noble Houses isn't very precise, as major and minor lords are both called simply "lords" (as opposed to differentiating between "duke" and "baron", etc). Each of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms has about a dozen or so major Houses, i.e. House Umber is sworn to House Stark, rules a large area of the North, and several minor Houses serve the Umbers. House Cassel, meanwhile, is a minor House, sworn directly to House Stark, which has no minor Houses serving it. Thus there are

   sourcebook, generally unique to Westeros. It seems that none of the great cultures of Essos organized their elites into houses, with the possible exceptions of the culture of Slaver's Bay (in the books they are referred to as Houses, but as great families in the TV series). It is explicitly stated that the Valyrians did not as well, as Aegon the Conqueror had to design the trappings of a Westerosi great House for the Targaryen family from scratch. This doesn't mean that Valyria or many of the Free Cities weren't organized around elite families, just that the power invested in such families was somewhat less official than in Westeros.

   Some of the noble Houses have a marked propensity for physical traits which are passed down through the generations. Although no one in Westeros has a concept of "genetics" as such, it is sometimes understandable that "the seed is strong" and that f.e black hair tends to be a dominant trait over blonde hair. Some of the notable examples include:

   This high propensity to pass on specific traits has led some to suggest that the humans of Martin's world have less complicated genetics than real-world humans, as the consistency of such traits across generations without significant inbreeding is unlikely. Martin himself was probably more worried about telling a good story than about being true to modern understandings of genetic complexity, and made do with a basic understanding of Mendelian genetics.
