   . It was formed by successful traders and craftsmen. Its name comes from the abandoned iron mine in which the bank's founders placed all their funds. The mine had a single entrance, which they sealed with heavy gates and iron bars and protected by guards hired jointly by all the members. The Iron Bank has moved to new, grander quarters since that day, but the mine is still employed as a depository, as well as being a historical site of the city.

   that wartime spending drastically increased their already significant debts to the Iron Bank, to astronomical levels. The Crown now owes the Iron Bank "a tremendous amount of money", and that the gold mines of the Westerlands actually ran dry three years ago. Therefore, even though Tywin admits the Lannisters can trust nobody except themselves, they need the Tyrells' wealth and resources on their side. Cersei suggests coming to some arrangement with one of their representatives, but Tywin dismisses the idea, since the Bank is a monolithic structure that cannot be avoided, lied to, or swayed.

   and two of his colleagues. When they ask the bank to fund their continuing campaign in Westeros, Nestoris points out their weak position and is ready to dismiss them. Davos speaks up, relating how he came into Stannis's service, how the latter is a just man who keeps his word, and how he is the best chance for the Iron Bank to get its money back upon the chaos that would follow the death of the elderly Tywin. After Tywin is gone (and with Tyrion arrested, soon to be either dead or disowned) the only leaders "House Lannister" will be left with are the despised Cersei, Jaime, and the boy-king Tommen - none of whom have great political or financial skill. This gives the bankers some second thoughts about how successful the Lannisters will be in the long run, and they agree to extend a new provisional loan to Stannis.

Instead, she decides to send Lord Tyrell himself to Braavos to negotiate a new deal with the Iron Bank, hoping that sending such a high official to treat with them in person will placate them.

   novels, the Iron Bank of Braavos is the most powerful banking institution in the known world, richer and more powerful than the banks of all the other eight Free Cities combined, and with a fearsome reputation when collecting debts. When princes or kings default on their debts or are foolish enough not to honor their agreements with the Iron Bank, new princes and kings appear with the Iron Bank's support. These new princes and kings then honor the previous debt along with paying back the money the bank loaned them in claiming their new power, lest they suffer the same fate as their predecessors. "The Iron Bank will have its due" is a common saying among Braavosi, almost as common as the saying "A Lannister always pays his debts" is in Westeros.

   ", and was also informed that half of this debt was to House Lannister. The episode's dialogue did not, however, break down who the remaining debt was owed to. In the books, it is explained that the Crown owes about two million Gold Dragons to the Iron Bank, the Tyrells, and several Tyroshi trading cartels (together), and nearly another million to the leadership of the

This is a shocking insult, given that Cersei is in no position to give orders to a foreign bank the Lannisters are heavily in debt to, and it backfires spectacularly. This is the last straw for the Iron Bank, making them realize that Cersei will never regain firm enough control over the Seven Kingdoms to pay them back, causing them to officially switch their support from the Lannisters to Stannis. First, the bank puts a freeze on all outstanding loans in Westeros, crippling the already severely damaged economy of the realm. Second, the Iron Bank agrees to extend massive new loans to Stannis, enough to hire a new sellsword army of over twenty
