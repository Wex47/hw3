   A major feature of the world the narrative is set in is that it experiences long seasons of varying length, usually lasting at least a couple of years each. Historically, the seasons have been known to last up to a decade in extreme cases, though these only happen once every century or so. The length of the seasons is completely unpredictable and varies randomly. There is some very loose correlation that a long summer is often followed by a long winter, but this is more of a trend than a rule. Conversely, seasons may be unpredictably short: the
   Year of the False Spring
   was so-named because an entire spring season occurred during it which lasted only two months. The

   keep a close eye on the length of the days in order to try to predict how long the current season will last, but this is an inexact science at best. The continent of Westeros extends much farther north than the continents of Essos and Sothoryos, and so is much more adversely affected by long winters. Meanwhile, Essos and Sothoryos are closer to the equatorial regions, which are typically warmer.

  <p key="f5036284-b376-4bf3-ba1d-8690c19de153">
   Even so, there are hints that the seasons may not always have been this way: characters still define "a year" as a twelve month period, not a full cycle of summer to winter. Months are the same as in real-life, roughly a thirty day period; the term "moon-turn" is commonly used for "month".

  <p key="2c9cce67-acba-415c-8333-9d0617a55ece">

   The unpredictable and years-long seasons of the world Westeros is in are in some ways more akin to mini-Ice Ages and warming periods, such as happened in the real-life Earth, though never to this degree. The "
   Medieval Warm Period
   " was a period of rising average temperatures across the northern hemisphere from the years 950 to 1250, which was followed by the "
   Little Ice Age
   ", an equally long period of falling average temperatures. The major difference is that these "mini-Ice Ages" occurred gradually over a period of two or three centuries on real-life Earth: Westeros, in contrast, can shift within a matter of years or

   At the time the TV series opens, the world has been experiencing a summer that has lasted for nine years, which is unusually long, and the maesters fear that a similarly long (or even longer) winter will follow. According to

While the winds and rains can be dangerous, the water the storms dump when they make landfall has also turned the southern portions of the Stormlands around Cape Wrath into a lush temperate rainforest. The storms pass over the Stepstones to reach the Stormlands, the island chain between Westeros and Essos at the southern end of the Narrow Sea, before curving west to hit the Stormlands. If they went a little farther to the west, however, the storms would make landfall in Dorne, and dump all of their rains there - but because they don't, Dorne remains a parched desert land. On rare occasions one of these super-hurricanes will sweep even farther north, past Massey's Hook and into Blackwater Bay, where it will ravage islands like Dragonstone.

   sourcebook (2014), the Order of Maesters in Westeros, and other learned men across the world, have studied astronomy for centuries, and by observing the movements of stars across the night sky, have determined with relative certainty that their world is a round globe. Isolated tribes or simple farm peasants in Westeros who have no education, of course, might still colloquially believe that the world is flat, but they are mistaken. Apparently, their better knowledge of astronomy is one of the reasons they consider one twelve month period to be "a year": this is how long it takes for the movement of the stars to reset (as their planet moves around its sun - though it hasn't been stated if they understand that it isn't the other way around, with the sun orbiting around the world).

They also understand that a ship could sail north over the pole and reach Yi Ti on the other side—provided that there is no landmass or arctic ice in the way. However, as of yet no ship has ever successfully circumnavigated the globe. Ships that have sailed west of Westeros and returned report finding only a vast ocean, and other ships simply never returned. Even the far south of Sothoryos and eastern end of Essos are unknown to men in Westeros. There have been some attempts to navigate north over the pole, but all have ended in failure due to dangerous ice and other unknown dangers.

   Westeros and the other lands in the known world are apparently located in their planet's northern hemisphere: the climate gets colder to the north extending into polar regions, and warmer progressing south towards the equator (it would be the opposite if in the southern hemisphere). Martin has said that Essos isn't quite as badly affected by the years-long winter seasons because it is closer to the equator, but he has never identified exactly where the equator is — or even if it is known. That is, it is unconfirmed if the equatorial line runs through Sothoryos and the Summer Isles, or, if the equatorial line is even farther away to the south, and is unknown even to explorers from the Summer Islands. Sothoryos has not been fully explored, but a handful of travelers' reports indicate that it is

   as long north to south as Essos is long west to east.

   Nonetheless, while their globe is bigger than real-life Earth, it is not so utterly vast that that everything from the Wall to the Summer Islands is in the same climate zone: there is noticeable variation from polar regions to tropical regions. For all we know, however, regions like the Summer Islands which we would consider to have "tropical" climates are actually located in their world's "sub-tropics", and the "tropics" around their equator are so hot that they are truly uninhabitable to humans. Another hint about their world's size is that constellations in the night sky are noticeably different between the Wall and southern latitudes such as Dorne and the Summer Islands, meaning that the curvature of the globe is noticeable across such a distance (if their world were 100 times the size of Earth, the angle of curvature would be so low that they wouldn't be able to see different constellations between these latitudes).

   Little is known of the "solar system" and astronomy of the world Westeros is set in, though in general, it appears to be roughly identical to real-life Earth. Astronomy is rarely mentioned and not very important to the narrative, but there has never been any indication that it is particularly different from real-life. The world in the fictional narrative has one sun. One moon orbits the world, going through lunar phases that make up a "month" (known as a "moon-turn"), equal to a real-world month.

  <p key="ed78624b-33bb-4218-be1a-9b73cd5baf6c">
   The solar system that the world is set in is known to have seven other planets besides the world the story takes place on. The peoples of the world don't appear to realize that these are other worlds like their own, i.e. that people can stand on (it's not even clear if they understand that the Moon is another "world" people can stand on). Planets are termed "wanderers" as they move across the night sky relative to the stars, which are fixed (incidentally, in real life the word "planet" comes from the Ancient Greek word for "wanderer"). On real-life Earth, ancient cultures (such as Classical Greece) only knew of five planets in the night sky, not seven. However, this does not necessarily mean that their solar system is different from our own, just that their rate of discovery is different. Uranus was only discovered in the seventeenth century, and Neptune in the nineteenth, using astronomical telescopes: even Galileo in the sixteenth century, using his simple telescope, was able to detect Neptune, though he mistook it for a star and thus is not credited with its discovery. However, the people of the world that Westeros is set in actually do possess simple telescopes, which are frequently used to aid astronomical observations of the night skies. The best telescopes, which they call "far-eyes", come from the master-lenscrafters of the Free City of
   <a href="Myr.html" key="eeb6379a-01f3-432e-b4a2-53ba842adbda" title="Myr">
    Myr
   </a>
   , and are thus referred to as "Myrish-eyes". Therefore, it is entirely possible that they discovered their equivalent of Uranus and Neptune already, because they possess a few technologies such as basic telescopes which real-life medieval Europe did not yet possess.

  <p key="d741139e-9878-4730-adc5-dfdef20a296e">
   It is unclear if the seven "wanderers" (planets) have formal names in the narrative . The only individual one identified was simply called the "red wanderer"—apparently their analogue of Mars. In the Seven Kingdoms it is associated with the Smith from the Faith of the Seven, though the Free Folk call it "the Thief"—because when the red wanderer appears in the constellation of the Moonmaid, they consider it a good time of year for a man to ritually "steal" a woman from another village to take as a bride.

   While there is no apparent physical difference between the astronomical bodies of the fantasy world and real-life, certain culture-specific aspects are different, specifically that cultures in Westeros developed different constellations than those in real-life. There is no indication that the stars are outright arranged differently. Rather, because the Ancient Greeks did not exist in their world, logically, figures from Greek mythology such as "Orion" were not used as shapes for constellations: they played "connect-the-dots" differently with the stars in the sky, using figures from their own mythology. For example, one constellation is known as the "Crone's Lantern", referencing the Crone from the

   The unnamed world on which Westeros is located experiences erratic and extremely long seasons, which usually last at least several years and have been known to last a decade. It is vaguely implied that this was not always so, as characters still refer to a "year" as a twelve month period, etc. Martin has stated that the ultimate cause of these long seasons is magical, and not technological (unlike the

   Most of the storyline is centered in the continent of Westeros, thus the worldview given to the audience is only the narrow perspective of the medieval population living there. Their society has not explored and mapped out the entire world. Much of the eastern continent of Essos is known fairly well to them through trade contact, but even so, the edges of their maps are simply blank space waiting to be filled in. George R.R. Martin has stated that his medieval fantasy world is based on specifically medieval

   The basic conceit of the setting is, "what if the British Isles were the size of South America?" to the point of being a continent unto themselves. Martin has stated that the continent of Westeros is specifically based on an over-sized British Isles, and that it is roughly the size of South America. The "Seven Kingdoms" of Westeros are loosely analogous to the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy, the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which they established in the British Isles after their invasion. The North is intended to be loosely analogous to Scotland. Just as the Anglo-Saxons invaded the Celtic inhabitants of Britain, the

Valyria's surviving colonies went on to become the Free Cities, which share several features with medieval Italy or other medieval urban areas in Western Europe. The Dothraki from the central-eastern plains of Essos are loosely based on steppe nomads such as the Mongols (with some additional elements of Amerindian plains peoples).

Sothoryos is analogous to Africa, but just as Western Europe did not possess much knowledge of Africa or East Asia in the Middle Ages, neither do people in Westeros. The audience shares the perspective of the characters, because of Martin's narration (shifting third-person limited) style, and thus we only know what they know. It's a thematic point that the lands north of the Wall are unexplored and poorly mapped, just as they would be to a Roman soldier standing on Hadrian's Wall looking north to the edge of the known world. Martin has stated that he therefore will never reveal an omniscient map of the entire world his stories take place in:

   If the analogous situation holds that Westeros is their word's equivalent to the British Isles, Yi Ti is the equivalent to China, and only the north coasts of Sothoryos have been explored, this would mean that only less than a fourth of the entire globe is known to men living in Westeros (the northern half of their eastern hemisphere above their equator).

   Martin has also stated that the storyline in his books is partially (and loosely) inspired by the War of the Roses, the civil war that occurred in England in the late 1400s following its defeat in the Hundred Years' War. Just as the War of the Roses was fought between the

   In May 2017 a commenter on Martin's blog directly asked him what the name of the planet is that Westeros and the other continents are set on—comparing it to how Tolkien's "Middle-earth" is a continent, but their word for their planet overall is "Arda"—that is, what would an educated Maester in the Citadel refer to their own planet/world as. Martin responded that they would probably just call it "Earth"—there is no more elaborate name (such as the fan nickname "Planetos").

   The major difference between the early-draft map that HBO has been using for the TV series since Season 2 and Martin's finalized map in

   is that the
   Jade Sea
   curves to the north in the early draft, but it curves sharply to the south in the final draft. Yi Ti is located on the northern coast of the Jade Sea, so the early draft map that HBO uses places it at a much more northerly latitude than in Martin's final draft version. This would substantially alter Yi Ti's climate, which is actually sub-tropical in the final draft map. In the final draft, the Hyrkoonian cities of
   Bayasabhad
   ,
   Shamyriana
   , and Kayakayanaya are oasis-cities in vast rain-shadow desert on the eastern shoulders of the Bone Mountains. In contrast, the early-draft HBO map depicts them as port cities on the coast of the Jade Sea, west of Yi Ti.

   clearly appear in the opening credits sequence, however—from Seasons 3 to 4 onward—just not in official HBO guide maps. Naath and Sothoryos appear where they do in the books and in accurate detail—given that they first appeared in the "Map of Slaver's Bay" and its surrounding first released with the third novel in 2000. Prior to Seasons 1 and 2, the novels already gave the general indication that the Summer Islands are south of the Narrow Sea (southeast of Westeros and southwest of Essos), but west of Sothoryos. Because the TV series already had this information, the appearance of the Summer Islands in the Season 3-4 opening credits generally matches this—but an official map of the Summer Islands was not released until
   <i key="5e298964-ae64-439f-a2aa-d58f42f12f55">

   also mentions the existence of another large landmass south of Asshai and east of Sothoryos, called "Ulthos". It is explicitly unclear to characters in the narrative if Ulthos is a separate, fourth continent, or simply a very large island or subsection of Essos or Sothoryos. Even Asshai is shrouded in legend to people in Westeros, and they have heard nothing of "Ulthos" other than the name in accounts about Asshai's geography—emphasizing that there are blank corners of the map that have not yet been explored by people from Westeros.

   . Thus it is reasonably accurate for regions of the eastern continents which are well-known to Westeros through trade contact (the Free Cities, Valyria, Slaver's Bay, etc.) but in the extreme far east near distant Asshai, myths and legends cloud the facts, resulting in descriptions of cannibals, "bloodless men", and "winged men" on the map which should not be accepted by the reader as objectively true. As George R.R. Martin himself explains:

   based on Martin's instructions, was asked about the discrepancy between the TV map (based on earlier drafts) and the now-canon world map for the books he drew, which are different east of the Dothraki and Qarth. Roberts offered his unofficial opinion that it isn't really an "inconsistency", because again, the world map he drew is intended to be a map written by educated people

   , and their knowledge about semi-mythical lands of the very far east is simply inaccurate to begin with (such as real-life maps produced in Medieval Europe that got the geography of China completely wrong). Thus neither the map the TV series was using
