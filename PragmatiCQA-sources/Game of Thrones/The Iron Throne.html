Grey Worm says it won't be over until Daenerys's enemies are defeated, but Davos asks him, "How much more defeated do you need them to be? They're on their knees!" Grey Worm tells Davos he only obeys the queen's commands; Jon asks Grey Worm what are those commands. Grey Worm replies he has orders to kill all who follow Cersei Lannister and that these men chose to fight for her. Grey Worm takes out his knife to execute the men, and Jon tries to stop him. Immediately, all of Daenerys's soldiers take aim at Jon, while the Northerners accompanying Jon draw their swords. Davos diffuses the confrontation, telling Jon they should speak with Daenerys. As Jon and Davos leave, Grey Worm starts to slit the prisoners' throats one by one.

He replies, "I freed my brother, and you slaughtered a city," with a look of disgust, throwing away his "Hand of the Queen" brooch. Outraged by this show of defiance, Daenerys tells her men to take him away. Perturbed, Jon and Tyrion make eye contact before Jon turns to face Daenerys. They share a tense silence before she leaves.

Before she leaves, Arya tells Jon in reference to Daenerys, "I know a killer when I see one."

   murdering his lover and father
   and betraying their queen. When Jon tries to tell Tyrion he didn't, Tyrion says he did... and he'd do it again, now he's seen what Daenerys is truly capable of, telling Jon, "I chose my fate, the people of King's Landing did not." Jon is disturbed by what Daenerys did and is unable to justify it, but believes the war is over now. Tyrion questions Jon, "Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?" He goes on to say, "She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She 'liberated' the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all". Jon angrily responds that Tyrion has been counseling her, and Tyrion agrees, "Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood." Jon is upset by the notion that blood defines who they are, saying Daenerys is not

He forces Jon to pause when he asks, "Would you have done it?"; he tries to make Jon see that, if he had been in the same place, knowing what it's like to be on dragonback with that power, Jon wouldn't have done the same thing. Tyrion realizes Jon doesn't want to betray Daenerys. He goes over Daenerys's history of killing evil men, and how everyone supported her for it, but she grew more and more powerful, more convinced of her rightness. Tyrion says that Daenerys is convinced it is her destiny to make the world better for everyone and will do whatever it takes to build the ideal world she wants, no matter how many must die to make it reality.

   's words, Jon reflects, "Love is the death of duty." Tyrion agrees and says that sometimes, duty must be the death of love, "You are the shield that guards the realms of men. You've already tried to do the right thing, no matter the cost. You've tried to protect the people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?" Tyrion acknowledges assassinating Daenerys is a terrible thing he's asking Jon to do, but says it's also the right thing. As Jon struggles with the idea of killing the woman he loves, Tyrion says he won't be the last man she executes and asks, "Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?" Jon accepts being executed by Daenerys if that is her choice. He apologizes to Tyrion that it came to this, but Tyrion tries again, "And your sisters? Do you see them bending their knee?" Jon says his sisters will be loyal to the throne, but Tyrion responds that the reason Sansa told him about Jon's parentage is because she doesn't want Daenerys to be queen. Jon says that's not up to Sansa; Tyrion agrees, but tells Jon he needs to make a choice, "And you have to choose now." Jon looks rattled as he leaves.

I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet." Jon confronts her over Grey Worm executing the Lannister prisoners in the streets but Daenerys defends it is necessary. Jon protests, "Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children! Little children, burned!" Daenerys says she tried to make peace with Cersei, but she used their innocence against her, "She thought it would cripple me." Jon urges her to forgive Tyrion and the people of King's Landing, who she's ordered to be executed. He pleads with Daenerys to make them see they made a mistake, make them understand she isn't this person, "Please, Dany." However, Daenerys says she can't and is resolved, "We can't give in to small mercies," she rallies. Jon urges her that they need a world of mercy, but Daenerys tries to convince Jon that her way is the way to the better world. A distressed Jon asks her how she knows, and Daenerys assures him it's because she knows what is good and gently tells him that so does he. Jon tearfully says he doesn't know and asks, "What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good?" Daenerys simply replies, "They don't get to choose." Daenerys embraces Jon and, sincere, she tells him to join her and that she wants him to help her break the wheel, trying to convince him of her new vision. Heartbroken, Jon declares, "You are my queen, now and always." They kiss and as they do so, an anguished Jon drives his dagger through her heart. Stunned, Daenerys collapses as Jon catches her. She dies in Jon's arms as he weeps over her body.

Yara wants Jon executed, but Arya warns her not to say another word about killing her brother or she'll cut her throat. Davos defuses the situation, saying they've had enough of cutting each other's throats. He gives Grey Worm's men credit for their aid in the war against the undead and if it weren't for them, they would have lost. He suggests Grey Worm take land in the

   Grey Worm says they do not need payment, they need justice for Daenerys's assassination and insists Jon cannot go free. Tyrion reminds him that he does not get to decide that, the power rests with their new queen/king. When it's pointed out there isn't one, Tyrion says that as the most powerful lords and ladies gathered, they can pick one from their number. Grey Worm relents and tells the assembly of lords and ladies to decide the new ruler. They start looking at each other. Edmure Tully rises from his seat and starts to give a speech putting himself forward for the position, but is cut short by Sansa who asks him to sit down. Edmure is visibly embarrassed by this and sits down. Sam, familiar with the voting system for the

   , suggests that the new ruler should be chosen by "everyone" - not only lords but all the people of the kingdom. This is met with scornful laughter from almost everyone, with Edmure and Lord Yohn comparing the idea of giving votes to the smallfolk with giving votes to horses and dogs.

   When Tyrion is told that perhaps he wants the crown himself, Tyrion disagrees as he is hated by half the people for serving Daenerys and the other half for betraying her. When Davos asks who he thinks should be king, Tyrion responds that stories unite people and are powerful things. Proposing an
   elective monarchy
   , he concludes, "And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? A boy, pushed from the tower, who couldn't walk but learned to fly. The crippled boy who crossed the wall and became the

   ’s cruelty. Tyrion asks Bran whether he will accept the crown, even though he does not want it. Bran replies, "Why do you think I came all this way?" Tyrion waits for the reactions of the other leaders. All of them slowly start saying "aye" one by one. Sansa is hesitant about this and says that she believes Bran will be a good king, but the North will once again be an independent kingdom. Bran gives his assent to her demand. Bran wants Tyrion to be his Hand but Grey Worm objects to it. He says Tyrion has to atone for his sins. King Bran says Tyrion has made a lot of mistakes and he will spend the rest of his life rectifying them; this will be his atonement, but Grey Worm is still unsatisfied.

   . Tyrion explains that while the purpose of the Night's Watch was served, it continues to serve a quarantine for the banished, poor and unfortunate. Sansa and Arya wanted Jon to be pardoned, while the Unsullied wanted his head. The compromise makes neither party happy but both have accepted it, Sansa and Arya understanding that Bran needs to make peace. Jon shakily asks, "Was it right? What I did?" Tyrion corrects Jon, "What we did." However, Jon responds that killing Daenerys doesn't feel right. Tyrion tells him to ask him again in ten years. Jon believes they won't ever see each other again, but Tyrion is not so sure, "A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world."

   Sansa, Arya, and King Bran meet Jon before he leaves. Sansa asks for Jon's forgiveness, but Jon hesitates. He then responds that Sansa has gained independence for the North. However, Sansa replies the North has lost its king. Jon tells her, "Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for." The siblings share an emotional hug. Jon tells Arya she can come and see him at Castle Black, but Arya gives him a sad smile when she tells him she's not coming back North. Sansa asks her where she's going. Arya's going west, "What's west of Westeros?" Jon returns her sad smile, "I don't know," and Arya tells him, "No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going." Jon asks, "You have your Needle?" Arya tells him she has it right here and starts to cry. Jon wipes away Arya's tear. They share a long hug. Jon turns to Bran and kneels, "Your Grace, I'm sorry I wasn't there where you needed me." However, Bran responds, "You were exactly where you needed to be," in his usual quizzical fashion. After this Jon gets up, and, after a few moments of looking at his brothers one last time, he leaves for the boat that is waiting to take him to Castle Black. The Starks separate, never to meet again.

      Daenerys's death, by coincidence or design, is somewhat similar to the death of Alexander the Great. It has been suggested by both contemporary and later writers that Alexander was poisoned by his generals to prevent him from launching an invasion of the Arabian Peninsula. Unlike Jon, Alexander's generals were not so much bothered by the promise of death and destruction; rather, they were tired of living their entire lives on campaign. Like Daenerys however, it was becoming apparent that Alexander was obsessed with conquering rather than ruling.

    Jon's act of killing Daenerys, the woman he loves, to save the world from more destruction is perhaps a reference to the legendary

    At most, 14 houses are represented at the meeting at the Dragonpit (assuming the Starks are the only ones with multiple members present). While many houses (e.g., Tyrell, Bolton, etc.) have (seemingly) been driven into extinction over the course of the show, there are still more than 14 houses remaining, especially if one counts minor houses and knightly houses. Then again, all great houses are represented, so presumably, the subservient houses would follow the choice of their liege-lords. The lack of representatives of more houses, and the presence of nobility not powerful in their own right (for instance, Arya, Samwell and Brienne do not have any titles of their own) can be explained by the meeting at the Dragonpit not originally having been intended to act as an election of a new monarch, but as the trial of Tyrion and Jon.

    Although the realm will now be known as the Six Kingdoms, the name is still a misnomer as there are eight regions remaining: the six kingdoms are the Vale, the Iron Islands, the Westerlands, the Stormlands, the Reach, and Dorne, while the Crownlands and the Riverlands remain within the realm.

      The moniker "Seven Kingdoms" actually predates Aegon's Conquest, and historically referred to the kingdoms of Westeros even when they were all independent, and when there were more or less than seven kingdoms in total. Indeed, the Targaryens still used the title "Lord of the Seven Kingdoms" when in reality they only ruled over six, as Dorne had yet to be conquered. Thus the change of name to "Six Kingdoms" is a bit striking, but it could be argued that the name is meant to affirm the independence of the North and the relinquishment of any claim on the North by the ruler of the remaining kingdoms - whereas the Targaryens used "Seven Kingdoms" in order to assert their claim on Dorne, Bran uses "Six Kingdoms" to show his respect for the North's independence.

While Eddard concedes that this is true, he reassures Arya that there are other ways for Bran to rise to a high station in life; speculating that he might become a great lord in his own right, raise castles like

      book is ironic, since he is the character with the most POV chapters than any other of the viewpoint characters in the actual novels (48 chapters, by the point the novels and the sample chapters reached), and also appears in many more chapters of other POV characters (Jon, Catelyn, Sansa); he appears in 67 episodes of the TV show, more than any other show character. This meta-reference could have been intentional by the writers of the show. Also, it is quite strange that Ebrose would not mention Tyrion in his book, considering that he plays a huge part in the War of the Five Kings: his abduction by Catelyn caused the early engagements between Houses Stark and Lannister; his defense of Blackwater Bay caused Stannis to fail to conquer King's Landing; the assassination of his father started the downfall of House Lannister.
