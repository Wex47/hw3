    ,
    Lord of Riverrun
    , set himself forward as a candidate for the crown, citing his battle experience as a veteran of two wars, as well as his experience with statecraft as credentials. This suggestion was promptly quashed by his niece, Sansa Stark, who sternly told her uncle to resume his seat.

    Choosing
    of
    Lord Commanders
    in the Watch, and a system that Tyrion had previously mentioned to Daenerys herself). This idea resulted in mocking laughter from the assembled lords, with Edmure and Yohn comparing the idea to giving votes to horses and dogs, and was quickly rejected as well.

    Finally, Tyrion suggested the idea of an

    , which Tyrion had also mentioned to Daenerys). This would also remove the possibility of unskilled or inexperienced leaders inheriting the throne. Tyrion claimed that nothing was better at uniting disparate people than a good story, and for that reason he suggested as monarch Brandon Stark, for his story of survival against extreme odds, and his abilities as the

   Despite the support gained for Brandon Stark, his sister Sansa was the only assembled member who did not immediately accept his crown. Saying that the
   Northmen
   had suffered too much to ever accept the rule of an outsider again (as could well happen in the future with an elective monarchy), she demanded that the North once again become its own sovereign kingdom, "as it was for thousands of years." This was granted by Brandon, who was thereafter hailed as

   Both Tyrion and Jon had recently been convicted of crimes, and the council was originally convened to decide their punishments: Tyrion had been arrested on the orders of the late Daenerys for treason, due to freeing his brother from the

   assassinating Daenerys
   , following her razing and massacre of King's Landing; she had stated in her victory speech that she would do the same in future conquests around the known world, and he was attempting to prevent further massacres. Grey Worm, commander of the Unsullied and one of Daenerys's greatest supporters, was particularly keen to see them both executed.

   After Brandon Stark was named king by his peers, he pardoned Tyrion and named him
   Hand of the King
   (a position Tyrion had previously held under Joffrey Baratheon and Daenerys herself). Grey Worm protested against this, and Tyrion initially rejected the position, saying that he had made too many mistakes in the past to be useful or worthy of the post. Bran acknowledged this, and made it clear that as his Hand, Tyrion would spend the rest of his life fixing the mistakes he made. Jon was later exiled to the
