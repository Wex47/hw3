Both men had claimed the Iron Throne: Stannis as the legitimate heir after his brother's death, and Renly on the claim that he could be a better king than his brothers. Meanwhile, in King's Landing, Eddard Stark confessed to treason and recognized Joffrey as the King in an attempt by the

However, while this was a tactical victory, it was a strategic failure: Robb Stark's actual grand strategy had been to invade the Westerlands in order to lure the Lannisters back away from King's Landing, then lure them into a trap so that Gregor's army could be surrounded and destroyed. Instead, Gregor's army was temporarily defeated but left mostly intact, allowing the Lannister forces in the Riverlands to regroup and then leave Harrenhal to rush to the defense of King's Landing when Stannis Baratheon later attacked. Robb Stark blamed Edmure for not waiting to lure Gregor into a trap to the west; even though Robb gave him no clear orders that this was his intention.

   As the onslaught of Stannis's attacked continued and the city seemed about to fall, the combined armies of House Lannister and House Tyrell, under Tywin Lannister and Ser Loras respectively, charged and broke through Stannis's flank, sending his army into a panic and fleeing from the field.

   The decisive Lannister-Tyrell victory also coincided with several egregious political blunders made by Robb Stark.

   Tensions continued to exist in the alliance between the Lannisters and the Tyrells, a relationship which was beneficial to the latter but not necessarily for the former, especially due to the casualties and debts the Lannisters suffered in their battles with Robb's army. The Tyrells' popularity had also been rising in parts of the Kingdoms such as

Joffrey's death ended up being beneficial for the Lannister-Tyrell alliance: he had been an unpredictable, incompetent and universally hated ruler whose impulsive, sadistic decisions had taken a devastating toll on his kingdom. Tommen, by contrast, was a shy, gentle-natured boy who could be counted on to delegate matters to wiser advisors, such as Tywin Lannister and Margaery Tyrell. After his coronation, Tommen reappointed Tywin (his grandfather) as Hand of the King and also granted him the title of

Tommen was also betrothed to his brother's widow, Margaery, in order to keep the loyalty of House Tyrell, whose supplies were needed to feed the Kingdom and whose gold was needed to pay the Crown's debts; his early friendship with Margaery, despite their age differences, helped ease some of the tension between the Lannisters and Tyrells.

In addition, Baelish and Bolton both know that the weakening power of the Lannisters (as a result of Tywin's death) was no longer a sure guarantee for their power and that they needed to secure new allies to maintain what they have gained thanks to the war: Baelish proposed an alliance between the North and the Vale, for protection against their enemies and to react against any Lannister retaliation once they learnt that Sansa has wed Ramsay.

  <p key="3ea758dc-b17b-42cb-9f27-1088fab5127f">
   Baelish returned to King's Landing on the orders of Queen Cersei, where he informed her that the Boltons planned to marry Sansa to Ramsay. He also told her that Stannis has left

   and was marching on Winterfell. Cersei was reluctant to send an army up north, despite her fury at Bolton's betrayal, because the weather had started to turn and winter had finally arrived. Baelish requested permission to lead the

   As Stannis marched on Winterfell, the winter snows intensified and trapped his army somewhere between Winterfell and Castle Black. As the weather worsened, supplies became scarce, horses froze to death, and men started to abandon Stannis: the
   Stormcrows
   , a mercenary band of five hundred men, deserted in the dead of night. Stannis nevertheless refused to heed his Hand, Ser

Melisanre, however, believed that it was still possible to move towards Winterfell, and suggested that by sacrificing his

  </p>
  <p key="bc97a59d-0ec2-4cee-8509-85e1cfca50bc">
   Due to the deep snows, Roose Bolton chose to remain at Winterfell: a siege in winter would force Stannis's troops to freeze, starve, and mutiny. While Ramsay wanted to meet Stannis in the field, the worsening weather would have been too difficult to maneuver an army, so he was instead granted twenty men for a raiding party. Achieving total surprise, Ramsay's sabotage wreaked havoc on Stannis's camp; his few remaining supplies were destroyed, as well as the few hundred horses he had left.
   In his desparation, Stannis conceded to sacrificing Shireen so that his army could move once again. He ordered his Hand to return to

   , a thaw came about that allowed Stannis to mobilize his army towards Winterfell.

  <p key="fbdea4fe-dc80-4b09-8e8f-49e535ea75b0">
   As Stannis prepared for his final march on Winterfell in the morning, he received word that a full half of his remaining men, including all of his sellswords, deserted in the night, taking the last of the horses with them. His wife,

   was found by his bannermen after hanging herself from a tree in the night, and his red priestess Melisandre had been seen leaving camp for Castle Black in the early hours. In spite of everything, Stannis ordered his soldiers to prepare for an assault on Winterfell.
With the former Stark stronghold in sight, Stannis readied his men to give siege, only to be met by a numerically-superior charge of Bolton cavalry, completely enveloping his army. Severely outnumbered, weary, and without cavalry of his own, Stannis gave battle as his own men started to flee.
  </p>
  <p key="db68ab4f-3b27-4c60-9192-3860bfcb2fc8">
   After the bulk of his remaining army was slaughtered to a man, Stannis found himself alone a nearby forest, standing over two dead Bolton bannermen but injured. Slumped down at the base of a tree, he had been tracked down by

   With Stannis's defeat, the Boltons claimed a great victory, discouraging further resistance against them. By this time, most of the Northmen had, if ever reluctantly, accepted their rule. Houses

   . House Bolton's rule over the North was now seemingly unopposed; Sansa's escape, however, has weakened their claim. Roose Bolton feared that, without her under their hold and without her to carry Ramsay's heir, the other Northern Houses would have an excuse to oppose them when the Lannisters march north to punish his insurrection of organizing Sansa's marriage to Ramsay. His fears were strengthened when Lord
   Harald Karstark
   came to Winterfell, revealing that the hunters sent to find Sansa had been found dead.

   openly declared himself King of the Iron Islands only slightly after Renly died, so there were never five kings actively fighting each other at one time. Nonetheless the name has stuck, and it does still refer to the fact that five kings were involved. For the TV series, however, it might be somewhat accurate, depending on when Balon Greyjoy's secession of the Iron Islands "officially" began. Renly was killed at the beginning of the

   It is generally a four-sided war, between the Lannisters, Starks, Baratheons, and Greyjoys. Renly's brief time as a claimant, controlling most of the armies of the Stormlands and the Reach, did affect the strategic position of the Lannisters, but he didn't set out to engage them on the battlefield. Instead the Tyrells had cut off the Roseroad, effectively blockading resources and foodstuffs from reaching the capital, and Renly was content to sit back and let the Lannisters exhaust themselves against the Starks while he built up his own strength to overwhelming levels, at which point he intended to march directly on King's Landing. Also while there are four "sides", this does not include political machinations and large territories changing sides, i.e. the

   , and particularly House Tyrell of the Reach, which considerably tipped the balance of the war when they switched their allegiance to the Lannisters. Due to simple geography, of course, any one faction isn't actively fighting three others all the time. Simply due to the fact that they are located on opposite coasts of the continent the Greyjoys (off the west coast) and

   (off the east coast) aren't actively fighting each other while he's on Dragonstone. Stannis does nominally consider the North to be in rebellion against him, but in practice doesn't actively fight the North, because he's more concerned with retaking the capital city from the Lannisters. As seen in the TV series, the Starks do send peace overtures to the Baratheons, but Stannis refuses to allow the North to secede and take away vast territories which he feels are rightfully his. While the Greyjoys aren't actively fighting Stannis, they are not on the side of the Starks or the Lannisters, and are truly looking out only for their own interests.
