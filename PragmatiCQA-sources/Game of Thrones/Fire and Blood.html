Kevan and other commanders debate whether to attack, fall back and raise reinforcement armies, or sue for peace. Tyrion points out that any chance of negotiating with Robb Stark died when his father Eddard was executed. The Lannister army is now exposed, so Tywin decides to retreat to

   explains that when Daenerys "saved" her, she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the Dothraki. They had sacked her village, looted all they owned, and those not killed were enslaved. She has now gotten her revenge, not only on Drogo, but on Daenerys' child Rhaego; now her "

   " can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents. Duur agrees that Daenerys saved her life, but she says to ask Drogo what life is worth when all else is gone.

   is lashed to a pillar of the pyre as well. She tells Daenerys that she will not scream while she is burned alive. Daenerys replies that she only wants the maegi's life. Ser Jorah believes that Daenerys intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider, as they can sell the eggs and travel far away. Ignoring Jorah's pleas, she kisses his cheek, and sets the pyre alight. Mirri Maz Duur does indeed scream as she burns, and Daenerys calmly walks into the flames. She stands below the pyre as flames appear to consume her.

    Pre-season casting announcements suggested that Vincent McCabe was playing Rickard Karstark. However, in the episode he plays one of the Lannister bannerman (the one who has Harys Swyft's lines from the book), while Karstark is actually played by Steven Blount, who is credited as such. However, Blount's character is never identified on-screen.
    John Stahl
    debuts in Season 2 playing Lord Karstark and is identified by name in dialogue. This leaves the matter open whether Blount and Stahl are playing the same character, or whether Blount is playing a separate (and unidentified) northern lord.

    Alik Sakharov
    to David Benioff, who used it in the script.

    The scene where Bran was riding on Osha's shoulders also featured real snow, as it was filmed late in the schedule just as the UK's worst winter in decades was beginning.

    Rickon was another tricky role to cast, as he had few lines in the first season but had to make his presence felt. They lucked out in finding a local boy, Art Parkinson, who could sell the role well. However, Dan and David incorrectly refer to Art Parkinson as being from Northern Ireland. Parkinson is from County Donegal which in fact a part of the Republic of Ireland.

    Michelle Fairley liked to hang out with the crew between takes rather than retreating to her trailer, no matter the weather.

    Richard Madden had had a big party in his hotel room the night before the scene between him and Michelle Fairley at the start of the episode, adding to Robb's tired and distraught appearance.

    Jack Gleeson developed a perfect posture for Joffrey to sit on the Iron Throne. The producers removed later references to how he should be sitting as they knew Gleeson would do it justice on his own.

   <li key="89d710bb-0f31-4a83-8c43-48d7ed9b2784">
    The producers brought forward Marillion's mutilation from the third season to the first because they wanted a character the audience had met before to be punished by Joffrey rather than a random newcomer who doesn't appear before or after. They note Ilyn Payne's professionalism in remembering to cauterise Marillion's wound.

   <li key="41115706-b411-483b-9e82-1185f8c18e7b">
    The producers reiterate there will be more developments to come in the second season between Sansa and Sandor.

    Benioff and Weiss were inspired by Charles Dance's performance in

    The scenes in the Red Waste were filmed on Malta, with the ocean replaced by a desert landscape via CGI. The actors had to be positioned in such a way that the background could be replaced as easily as possible.
   </li>
   <li key="25a29035-03b3-4a80-b6b0-e8262caf468e">
    At one point David Benioff and Daniel Minahan were in Belfast working on shoots for an earlier episode while D.B. Weiss and Alan Taylor were in Malta working on another, and swapping dailies at the end of every day. Season 2 is being filmed in a similar manner.
   </li>
   <li key="33d19baf-b9e8-49a9-b460-1661e8436237">
    The producers are aware of the criticisms that the direwolves don't appear as much as in the book, but every time they were put in a scene it would double the shooting time, so they had to be used economically. More impressive direwolves will appear in Season 2.
   </li>
   <li key="8f344caf-d8e8-442e-9f49-fff25ffc78b3">
    The scene where Jon flees from Castle Black caused several injuries, with a stuntwoman running into a tree by accident and another stuntperson falling off their horse. Benioff and Weiss judged it worth it just to hear Samwell Tarly's 'girly scream'.

   <li key="33fe864a-8976-4403-8159-4f9438ef8814">
    The scene where Pycelle limbers up and shows that his infirmity is an act was inspired by the Keyser Söze reveal in

    The producers love Aidan Gillen and Conleth Hill's performances so much that they wrote scenes with just the two of them verbally sparring for the sheer joy of it.

   <li key="9c7e225f-ea48-4b0f-905e-d863e30c75da">
    As Arya leaves King's Landing, she looks back at the skyline. The plan was that the Great Sept of Baelor would be CGIed into the background and Arya would be remembering her father. However, it was felt that this drew attention away from Arya as the focus of the shot so the sept was not painted in.
   </li>
   <li key="05dae2cb-58d1-42f8-9687-f3971ad9fbc1">
    The producers lament the costs of building the Castle Black and Eyrie sets and then having to leave them unused for the entirety of Season 2.

    There was never any question that the final scene of the book would be the final scene of the season. The producers confirm that the dragon on Daenerys' shoulder is

   <li key="a289fce6-c525-462b-8169-6eabf9f7dc3b">
    To shoot the final scene, the team did not have enough time at 'magic hour' (the moment surrounding sunrise) to get everything done in one go, so it was shot over three days.
   </li>
   <li key="5157b41f-1163-4d58-9c7a-4d705d17ae05">
    The music for the final scene was recorded live with a big orchestra in Prague, one of only two times this was done for the score.

    During the filming of the pursuit of Jon Snow through the woods, a lighting generator failed, causing a stuntwoman to crash into a tree. She required eight stitches.

   <li key="610c9bda-5453-40a6-ac79-46ac919c4ac2">
    For the scene where Joffrey shows off the severed heads of his enemies to Sansa, specially-made replicas of Sean Bean and
    Susan Brown
    's heads were used. However, for the other heads the prop-makers scrambled to find existing replica heads from stocks. One of the other heads is actually
    George W. Bush
    in a wig, which the producers stress was not a political statement.
