    overrun and conquered almost all of the continent
   </a>
   . Their attempts to conquer the North, however, were defeated at every turn, in part because the narrow lands of the
   Neck
   which separate the North from the rest of the continent are an ideal strategic choke point, defended by the ancient castle of
   Moat Cailin
   . After many centuries the Andals and First Men made peace, as individual Andal kingdoms carved out of southern Westeros became more concerned with fighting each other than uniting to crush the remaining independent First Men of the North.

In many other regions, the Andals established themselves as the new aristocratic class ruling over the First Men, though after thousands of years these ethnic lines have blurred to a large extent. Some of the noble Houses of the First Men survived by intermarrying with Andal invaders: even

   Many people living in Westeros have at least some blood of the First Men in their ethnic makeup, though this is more common in the lower classes. Even so, the southern kingdoms of Westeros became so thoroughly dominated by the Andals and their culture, that Westeros is often referred to as "the Land of the Andals" in

   has stated that the series was loosely inspired by the War of the Roses which occurred in Britain during the fifteenth century. The First Men loosely parallel the original Celtic inhabitants of Britain, while the Andals who later invaded and conquered Westeros are loosely parallel to the Anglo-Saxon invasions of Britain during the fifth and sixth centuries. The Anglo-Saxons never conquered the Celtic peoples living in the region that would become modern Scotland, in the north of the island of Britain, who remained ethnically and culturally distinct. Similarly, the Stark-held North resisted the invasion of the Andals from the south, and like Scotland remained ethnically and culturally distinct. Both Scotland and the North benefitted from being separated from the rest of the island by a narrow isthmus: Wales also wasn't immediately conquered by the Anglo-Saxons, but in its case this was due to mountainous terrain - in Westeros,

   The Anglo-Saxons did intermingle on some level with the Celtic/Romano-British inhabitants of what would become modern England, but they were subjugated and largely subsumed by the Anglo-Saxons. Similarly, people in the southern kingdoms of Westeros have some partial descent from the First Men, in regions where the Andals conquered and intermingled with the First Men instead of wiping them out entirely.
