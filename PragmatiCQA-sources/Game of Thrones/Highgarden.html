Indirectly mocking Cersei, Loras pointedly says that Margaery has previously been greatly involved with charity work for the poor back at Highgarden. Cersei also mocks Margaery's revealing dress by sarcastically asking if she is cold, to which Margaery counters that the climate is warmer in Highgarden - though thankfully, the Tyrells' blood runs quite warm. Margaery also- perhaps deliberately- comments on the Reach's provisions of food to the capital, reminding Cersei of the importance of House Tyrell's support in the war.

   novels, Highgarden is among the most beautiful castles in the Seven Kingdoms. Situated on a broad, symmetrically shaped hill, the castle includes three concentric tiers of white stone walls, which increase in height and thickness as one travels upwards. Between the outermost and middle walls is Highgarden's famous "briar maze", a labyrinth of beautifully maintained hedges that serves two important purposes; entertainment for the castle's inhabitants and deterrence against enemies (any invaders who manage to penetrate the outer wall would have no easy task finding their way through the elaborate growth of thorns and greenery).
  </p>
  <p key="fc218562-f99d-471c-a45c-40f48dfee73e">
   The inner rings of Highgarden are a beautiful complex of towers, courtyards, colonnades and statuary, and greenery is just as prominent inside the walls as in the fields outside; ivy, grapevines and climbing roses can be seen snaking around the buildings, and gardens and arbors are filled with flowers. Water features are also common inside the walls, with pools, fountains and even man-made waterfalls visible throughout the complex. The TV series takes this layout into account, the hill on which the castle stands is covered by the forest.
  </p>
  <p key="886ccca9-322e-4bbc-8a0c-92309bfeb098">
   Highgarden is also notable for its places of worship. The castle sept is lined with rows of stained-glass windows depicting
   the Seven
   as well as

   trees known as the Three Singers. Said to have been planted by Garth himself, the branches of the trees have become so enmeshed over the centuries that they resemble a single tree with three trunks.

  <p key="fc136da1-b15e-4469-8d6a-7b1fd36364d5">
   A fine selection of horseflesh can be found in Highgarden's stables, and pleasure barges offer river cruises on the Mander. Outside the walls, meadows and fields of flowers can be seen in every direction, along with fruit orchards rich in peaches, melons and fireplums.
