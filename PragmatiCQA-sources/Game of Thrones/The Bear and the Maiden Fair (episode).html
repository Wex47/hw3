   about cutting his and Ygritte's rope loose on The Wall, nearly killing the both of them in the process. Orell tells Jon that he doesn't see Ygritte complaining about what happened because she is a

   and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation, also telling Jon that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her. During the journey through the woods, a clearly jealous Orell confronts Ygritte and says that he would be a better man for her than Jon Snow, while continuing to express his distrust in Jon. Jon also tries to persuade Ygritte that the wildlings' cause is doomed to failure, reminding her that six

Theon is distrustful at first, fearing that this is another of his tormenter's tricks. Theon cannot help himself but be aroused when one of the women who has become naked straddles him and begins a rocking motion. Suddenly, the familiar horn sounds and the

The boy claims he too has heard about Theon's famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part. When the sadistic youth brandishes an odd knife, Theon realizes the boy means to remove his penis. Horrified, Theon begs for mercy, but the boy quips that this is mercy as he's not killing Theon, merely altering him. Two large men hold a screaming Theon down while the boy moves in to emasculate him.

   and that numerous armies throughout history have tried and failed to conquer it. However Daenerys is not threatened, commenting that a hard-fought battle would give her Unsullied much needed practice. Razdal tries a different tact, asserting there is no need for their factions to fight, that Yunkai is willing to overlook her attack on Astapor and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to Westeros. In exchange, they ask that Daenerys leave Yunkai in peace.

  <p key="85581b07-98a0-49d2-af4e-d8d6f143b01d">
   Daenerys makes a counter-offer: she will spare the lives of Razdal and the slave-masters of Yunkai if every slave (men, women and children) in the city is set free, and given as much food, clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services. She warns that if her offer is rejected, Yunkai will be shown no mercy. Razdal takes offense, promising that Yunkai will be more of a challenge for her than Astapor or

   and his siblings roar in anger; Razdal protests that he was promised safe conduct, to which Daenerys counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother. After the dragons prevent his slaves from reclaiming the chests of gold he brought with him, Razdal storms out of the pavilion, muttering curses. Daenerys tells Jorah to find out more about Yunkai's "powerful friends" before she commits herself to an attack on the city.

   When their party makes camp, as Qyburn checks Jaime's stump, Jaime questions how the former Maester lost his chain. Qyburn explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness. Jaime is disgusted by this revelation, but Qyburn counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions Jaime on how many he has killed compared to how many he's saved. Jaime responds that he has probably killed thousands, but he saved half a million lives when he killed the Mad King to save the population of

   for his daughter's safe return. However, Locke refused the offer; still under the misapprehension that Tarth owns every sapphire mine in Westeros, Locke is convinced Lord Selwyn is trying to cheat him. When Qyburn mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing Brienne before they die in battle or winter, Jaime, feeling guilty because his lie to protect Brienne has invertantly placed her in greater danger, urges Steelshanks to return to Harrenhal. Though the man initially refuses, Jaime uses the promise of a reward and the threat of Tywin Lannister's retribution to convince him to go back.

   Upon arriving at Harrenhal, Jaime is shocked and furious to find Locke and his cronies have thrown Brienne into a bear pit, facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself, as they all mockingly sing

   . Jaime orders Locke to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants, but Locke dismisses the offer, getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of Brienne being torn apart. In desperation, Jaime leaps into the pit to help her; before the bear can harm either of them, Steelshanks shoots it with a crossbow, distracting the beast long enough for Jaime and Brienne to be pulled out of the pit. Locke tries to stop them from leaving, but Jaime angrily tells him that Lord Bolton cares more about getting him back to King's Landing alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy, and backed up by Steelshanks and his men, Locke is unable to stop them. Jaime then departs Harrenhal with his escort and Brienne in tow.

Joffrey is puzzled at why Tywin doesn't think they should do anything about her, but Tywin reminds Joffrey that the last Targaryen dragons were stunted inbred creatures who weren't a threat to anyone, and Daenerys' dragons are probably just curiosities at best, not grand weapons of war. Moreover, Tywin says that even if Daenerys' dragons

When Joffrey protests that he hasn't been counseled on anything, Tywin says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform Joffrey should he deem it necessary. Before taking his leave Tywin smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten Joffrey squirming on the

      This episode was originally announced by George R.R. Martin on his blog in 2012, almost a year ahead of transmission. The original planned title was "Autumn Storms." In January 2013 he announced that the title had been changed to "Chains." However, due to scenes from another episode being moved into it, it was decided to retitle the episode to "The Bear and the Maiden Fair." Thus Martin himself didn't write the scenes that include the bear (which all occur in one big chunk at the end of the episode).

    The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of the
    House Lannister theme
    . In the
    official soundtrack release
    it is titled "A Lannister Always Pays His Debts."

    Parts of this episode were filmed in Los Angeles, USA, because they involve a live actor-bear (named
    Bart the Bear
    ) and there are various legal restrictions on international transport of large animals such as
    bears
    .

      explained, she chose Bart out of three potential stunt-bears: one from Utah (Bart), one from Canada, and one from Europe. Bart was then flown from Utah to California, where a partial duplicate of the bear pit set at

      Christie explained that she was actually with Bart the bear in the pit, though in real life the crew was being friendly to the bear and saying encouraging things to keep him calm. Christie said that she did every stunt in the bear pit - except for one, when she has to pretend that the bear is hitting her. A stunt double was used for that specific, brief shot, though in real life Bart was just playfully pawing at the stunt man.
