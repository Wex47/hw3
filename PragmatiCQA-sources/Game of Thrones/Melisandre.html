   Cressen stands and offers an apology for his actions on the beach before inviting Melisandre to share his wine. He draws from the cup before handing it to Melisandre. Cressen steadies himself on the table and his nose begins to bleed: he had poisoned the drink. Melisandre drinks from the cup anyway and then watches the Maester collapse, his blood spreading on the stone floor beneath him.

   Stannis asks Melisandre what she said to Matthos. She reveals that she told him that "death by fire is the purest death." Stannis questions her intent and she says only that it is true. She senses that Stannis is concerned and claims that armies are toys to the Lord of Light. Stannis suggests that she tell her god to burn them. She says that she can tell Him nothing but prays for, and obeys, His commands. Stannis reports that Renly has 100,000 men whose allegiance should be his. Melisandre urges him to have faith. He tells her that in a real war the side with the greater number wins, that he cannot take King's Landing without Renly's men and cannot defeat Renly's army.

She says that Selyse is sickly, weak and shut away in a tower and that she disgusts Stannis. She says that Selyse has given Stannis no sons, only stillborns and death. She promises him a son. He repeats the promise as she kisses his ear. He returns her kisses and lifts her onto the table, scattering the models onto the floor as he begins to have sex with her.

Melisandre explains that Stannis has taken the fiery heart of the R'hllor for his sigil. Renly says that she must be the fire priestess he has heard so much about and jokes that he now knows why Stannis found religion late in life. Stannis warns his brother to watch his tongue.

   Renly says that he is relieved that Stannis is not really a fanatic and calls him charmless, rigid, and a bore but not godly. Melisandre admonishes Renly to kneel before the Lord’s chosen and says that Stannis was born amidst salt and smoke. Renly jokes that she makes Stannis sound like a ham. Stannis again warns his brother. Catelyn admonishes the brothers as the discussion continues, with Renly reminding Stannis no-one supports his claim. Stannis, for the sake of
   their mother
   , gives Renly the night to reconsider and offers to restore him to
   his seat

She asks him if he is afraid, calling him Onion Knight, and he retorts that he has been told that the night is dark and full of terrors. She says that he has carried more unpleasant cargo in his time. She asks if he is a good man and he says that he is a mixture of good and bad. She counters that if half an onion is black with rot then it is a rotten onion and asserts that good and evil are absolutes. Davos asks which she is and she says that she is good. She says that she is a champion of light and life. They beach their rowboat and Melisandre asks Davos if he loves

Stannis is accepting of her methods and Selyse is wholly trusting of her, whilst Davos retains his skepticism. Melisandre later dines with Stannis and Selyse. She makes small talk when discussing the

   Months later, Selyse speaks to Melisandre, who is enjoying a bath. Melisandre quips that the Lord of Light told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath, but the joke goes over Selyse's head. Melisandre praises her for this, however, since most jokes are lies, whilst Selyse is devoted to truthfulness. Selyse again asks if they should avoid them due their untruthful nature, to which Melisandre states that they should not always be ignored.Cementing her position as Melisandre's most devoted follower, the Red Priestess tells Selyse about her use of potions and illusions in serving the Lord of Light, the idea being that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on.

She also mentions that she does not know if Shireen is actually sinful or simply born out of hate for Selyse.

She implies that it is not her decision and she must do as the Lord of Light commands.

   When Davos interrupts Melisandre's conversation with Jon in the hall of Winterfell and challenges her about Shireen's death, she shows remorse at the sight of her burned wooden carving and confesses her culpability. Though she argues that she burnt Shireen at the command of her parents, when Jon asks her for any last defense, Davos denounces the order as evil and threatens to execute her personally. Jon exiles her from the North for her crime of infanticide, after which she is seen riding south from Winterfell.

Arya recalls the last time they met, where Melisandre prophesied that Arya would shut many eyes forever: brown eyes, green eyes, and, as Melisandre now reminds her, blue eyes.

  </h2>
  <p key="c72c54e2-356a-458a-b4a7-48fb1d0eeb4d">
   Melisandre was best defined by her seemingly unwavering faith in R'hllor, which seemed to dominate every move she made. A religious fanatic, she attributed many, if not any, great thing to be done in the world as an act carried out by the Lord; however, funnily enough, she does not credit herself with anything she does in the fire god's service, describing herself as simply a vessel for his will. She was extremely intelligent in her own way and appeared to have an uncanny understanding of other people, which enabled her to either gain their trust or to subdue them in a confrontation without it coming to blows between them, which sets her apart from women like Cersei Lannister (who subdues them by threatening them with her own family's power) and Margaery Tyrell (who actually got people to trust her and feel comfortable around her). The latter was a person whom Melisandre especially contrasted with in this regard, because almost everyone felt uneasy around her, in spite of her calm and serene behavior.
  </p>
  <p key="30a2538c-b120-4972-ab05-157cf02d3d4e">
   Melisandre had a habit of being exceptionally changeable in spite of her absolute faith in R'hllor, which was demonstrated several times. When she first met Stannis Baratheon, she convinced him that he will win the war with great ease on the basis that he is the one true king, and went to extremely great lengths to ensure that this victory was carried out (to the point of using Shadowbinder magic to murder Renly Baratheon, which proved to be a wasteful move since Stannis ended up losing the Battle of Blackwater Bay anyway). When Stannis brooded over losing at Blackwater Bay, he actually threatened her and she still remained faithful to R'hllor, although she did not willingly admit that her god wronged both her and Stannis by causing the loss at Blackwater Bay - a suggestion which Melisandre ought to believe because she was convinced that the Lord of Light decides all destinies, and seemed to have protected the usurping lords who stood against Stannis. She defended herself by assuring Stannis that the war between Stannis and his enemies would be long and costly, but eventually he would succeed.
  </p>
  <p key="bd499600-a0e6-403b-9b98-6e4dbdc26f8e">
   Melisandre was a woman who was completely aware of her own enigma - in fact, her enigma was something that she relished. Very little is truly known about her past other than generalizations that she gave to other people; she claimed that she had been fighting for far longer than Stannis ever had (something which is strongly supported by how old she was revealed to be), and was revealed to actually be a ferocious opponent in her own right, as she subdued Stannis when he attacked her by reminding him of how he needed her alongside him. She also frightened Davos with her own powers, especially by alluring him in anticipation for what he was about to see. One prime example was when Davos returned to Dragonstone, and Melisandre maintained control over Stannis by provoking Davos into attacking her, which led to him being arrested. In spite of her animosity, Melisandre was not above realizing that Davos was still of use to Stannis and that he would be needed in the coming war. Melisandre was also completely able, and adept, at using her own sex to her advantage, seducing Gendry into being a part of her ritual for Stannis - however, when Robb Stark was killed as a result of this ritual, Melisandre scorned Davos for wanting to see the Lord's power, since the ritual still has not brought Stannis closer to the Iron Throne, even though Melisandre performed the ritual herself.
  </p>
  <p key="7adb6c40-7c4f-451d-b42d-ba12fd3f394b">
   Melisandre, although apparently representing a god who is good and true, could deliberately be incredibly ruthless and cruel. She was completely willing to erase hundreds of lives in representation of her faith in the Lord of Light, to the point of outright murdering good men and allies under the assumption that it would win Stannis favor with her god. She saw nothing wrong with burning people publicly, and behaved as if they had been freed from their sinful bodies and become assets to the Lord of Light, comparing it to how a woman screams before she gives birth and is immeasurably happy afterwards - Shireen Baratheon was quick to point out the drastic difference being that women giving birth are not ash and bone afterwards. Melisandre spoke of the sinfulness and cruelty of her enemies, even though she herself could be cruel and even arrogantly and unapologetically sadistic, shown prominently when she taunted Davos with the concept that the mass-casualties at Blackwater Bay were his fault because Melisandre was not there, and how she used Mathos's own death (which happened right in front of Davos) as an example to this. The worst example of her cruelty by far was when she convinces Stannis to burn his own daughter alive in public, indifferent to the screams of both Shireen and her mother, and the brutal despair that Stannis experienced afterwards.
  </p>

   As the War of the Five Kings climaxed and devolved into disaster, Melisandre's faith began to crack. She began to lose faith in Stannis as the Battle of Winterfell came closer at hand, but remained at his side for the most part; however, after the deaths of Shireen and Selyse (the latter of which Melisandre was partly responsible for), Melisandre fled the battle, perhaps in fear of Stannis's rage, and was unable to do anything to help Stannis crush the Boltons in battle, even though she claimed to Davos that she would have eased Stannis's victory at Blackwater. Melisandre's faith was crushed at the news of Stannis's defeat and the concept that she was wrong, and she became more withdrawn than before. She seemed to transfer her faith to Jon Snow, who actually proved to be the man who would win a great battle in the North, and supported him after she resurrects him. This was a surprising turn for Melisandre because she supported Stannis so strongly under the impression that he was the one true king that would defeat the great evil to come, only to transfer her faith to somebody else. On the other hand, this was an understandable move by Melisandre because she tried to maintain her faith in the Lord of Light, in spite of the misfires and obstacles that came her way. It should be noted that during her service to Jon, Melisandre stopped proselytizing her faith and only used her magic for benevolent purposes, adopting a more subdued approach to her religion and future events and ultimately behaving similarly to

   Melisandre's inadvertent cruelty and ruthlessness, as well as her extremely costly faith in the Lord of Light, finally exploded in her face when Davos finally confronted her over the death of Shireen. Having quarreled with Davos over the true greatness of the Lord of Light from the beginning, Melisandre was defenseless when Davos berates her over the wastefulness of her sacrifices and the fact that, in spite of her claims to represent a great god, she purposefully burned a child at the stake on the basis that she had king's blood in her veins. Melisandre was unable to speak when Davos condemns the Lord of Light as evil because of what he 'made' Melisandre do, and has the gall to shame Stannis and Selyse as equivalently responsible for Shireen's death, even though, out of the three of them, Melisandre was the only one who did not show restraint or remorse in the act. She was unapologetic about her own blind faith, and maintained her philosophy that the Lord of Light is influential in the battle between good and evil, and the fact that she committed unforgivably evil acts in representation of good.

   Even though Melisandre claimed to possess superior knowledge about the Lord of Light, she faced several incidents and outcomes which she proved unable to predict or even understand. She was speechless at the revelation that Beric Dondarrion had been brought back six times by the Lord of Light, which she deemed impossible. She was also disappointed at the concept that there is nothing after death, even though she convinced herself and tried to convince many others that death would be a release into someplace much greater than the hell that everyone lives in.

   However, despite in many of her dreadful flaws, Melisandre's true and only goal in life was to ensure that fire would defeat ice and thus prevent the destruction of mankind by taking part in the efforts to destroy the white walkers. Even after being banished from Winterfell by Jon Snow for murdering Shireen, Melisandre still remained truly loyal to Jon Snow and his cause, as she knew that he was needed to defeat ice and death for good. She bravely and honorably returned to Winterfell before the

   to use her magical powers to help keep the dead away, which proved to be advantageous in the battle, and was even the one who instructed Arya to finally slay the Night King and his army of the dead for good, by telling her to defy the god of death. She also showed no fear of dying, as she informed Varys after being banished from Winterfell that she would purposefully return to Westeros one final time to die, and after the dead are all destroyed, she walked off into the snow, removing her bewitched ruby choker, and succumbed to old age and died peacefully, having realized she had served her divine purpose in the world and probably allowing her to be finally with the Lord of the Light in the afterlife.
