   A short time later, Drogo arrives at Illyrio's estate. After taking a glance at Daenerys, Drogo rides away without dismounting from his horse. Viserys is concerned, but Illyrio assures him that, if he did not approve of Daenerys, they would have known. After their departure, Illyrio and Viserys discuss the quest to sail back to Westeros, and Viserys inquires when the wedding will take place. Daenerys is not pleased with the arrangement and blurts out that she does not want to marry Drogo. Viserys insists that Daenerys will marry him, because in return, Drogo will give Viserys the army he needs to retake their father's throne from Robert Baratheon. Viserys adds that he would let his sister be raped by all forty thousand of Drogo's men and their horses if it meant getting his throne back.

  </h2>
  <p key="24f2e68c-e201-4ee8-8585-2a1cda0178b5">
   Viserys was cruel, condescending, arrogant, aggressive, sadistic, temperamental, and immoral. Much like Joffrey Baratheon, Viserys believed that his birthright entitled him to obedience and reverence from those around him and would throw temper tantrums when he was not treated with the respect he thought he was owed, despite having done little to earn it. Viserys described his temper as "a dragon", but also referred to himself as such, thinking himself one of the greatest Targaryens to have ever lived. Viserys's temper hopelessly outweighs his common sense, making him rash, temperamental, impetuous and reckless.
  </p>
  <p key="079c78c8-dcce-4dbf-af79-6127c15bc470">
   Viserys was also prone to grandiose delusions and believed himself to be a mighty warrior, like his brother Rhaegar Targaryen. In truth, he had never wielded a sword against an opponent in his life and knew nothing about combat or warfare. When he was attacked by Dothraki, he did not fight back himself but instead tried to get others - such as Jorah Mormont - to do it for him, despite having recently belittled the man and insulted his concept of loyalty. Viserys never expected any true consequences to come from his more rash actions, reacting in shock and awe when Daenerys fought back against him.
  </p>
  <p key="616d2d2b-0f7e-44d4-8ae6-bf20ff4fbc79">
   Viserys's arrogance is a trait he shares with his father; both thought themselves invincible. For Aerys, he opened the gates of King's Landing to his old friend

   and his army, despite his remaining loyalists warning him it was a trap. This act of utter folly led to the

    Sack of King's Landing
   </a>
   and his own death. Viserys, on his part, foolishly believed that the Dothraki would never strike back at him for threatening their
   Khaleesi
   , and that he had the right to bare steel against them. His self-conception of being 'the dragon' blinded him to the fact that
   <i key="a0bd494c-22d7-4eef-a855-cbb93e8552d8">
    no man
   </i>
   could shed blood or bare steel within Vaes Dothrak. Similarly, this mistake cost Viserys his life.
  </p>
  <p key="b556afb3-d657-4b02-b54c-7e9f4aec26d1">
   In regards to his sister Daenerys, Viserys viewed her as nothing more than property to abuse or dispense with as he pleased. On the day he was to marry his sister over to Khal Drogo, he even fantasized that men will write that his reign began on that day, even though it was more an ascension of her status than his - he never inquired, nor cared, as to whether or not she wanted to be married to a Dothraki. As he said to her about her marriage to Khal Drogo, "We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all forty thousand men and their horses too, if that's what it took." Despite this, Viserys never considered that her loyalty to him could waver. As Khal Drogo was preparing to "crown" him, he begs for her to intervene, despite giving her absolutely no reason to do so. In fact, only moments before, he had threatened to cut her open with a sword during her pregnancy.

   early in his life, and having to beg everyone for money and shelter rendered Viserys cruel and bitter. She clearly once had some affection for him as her only living blood relative, since, in tribute, she named her dragon, Viserion, after him.
  </p>
  <p key="80d49d29-9cbe-4fc1-b5c3-22c96f26a5f0">
   Viserys was an immoral person, as evidenced by how he callously implied that, under his rule, Jorah Mormont would not face consequences for the crimes of selling slaves. A good king would have been appalled at the crime, as Jorah himself regretted it, but this reinforces the idea that Viserys saw other men, especially
   <a href="Smallfolk.html" key="74eaed64-7c69-447b-b8b1-3f3965c1bb30" title="Smallfolk">
    common men
   </a>
   , as only a means to an end. He also did not hesitate to questioning other people's honor, integrity or duty. When Jorah caught Viserys trying to steal the dragon eggs in order to buy his own army to take the Iron Throne, Viserys told him that he noticed the way Jorah looked at his sister. However, Viserys also told Jorah he didn't care and that he could 'dine on' Daenerys however he wanted, so long as he let Viserys go. Viserys desired power and loyalty but deserved neither.
  </p>
  <p key="07031a8f-6643-4919-8a72-925d38765025">
   Much like Joffrey Baratheon, Walder Frey or Janos Slynt, Viserys was a small, pitiful man who believed himself to be great. Like them, he kept demanding loyalty without ever proving himself worthy of it, always thinking that his pedigree, or status, would assure him impunity. However, unlike them, Viserys was not fortunate enough to have a powerful family protecting him, so, lacking the foresight to understand his actual situation, he never realized that he truly had nothing apart from his name, which he would never live up to, and his sister, whom he mistreated until she began despising him as well. Refusing to learn from his mistakes, Viserys's faults ultimately resulted in his death.
