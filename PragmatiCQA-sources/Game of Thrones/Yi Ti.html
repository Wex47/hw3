   Yi Ti is one of the oldest and most advanced societies in the known world. It was already ancient when the
   Valyrians
   were still shepherds and had not yet trained

   (over 5,000 years ago); even the ruins of fallen cities in Yi Ti dwarf the largest cities in Westeros. Many valuable commodities - such as rare spices, gems, and silks - are found in Yi Ti, making the region incredibly wealthy; its princes are said to live opulently in houses of solid gold, feasting on meat powdered with pearls and jade - if the stories can be believed.

   Unlike the other ancient civilizations of Essos, such as the
   Ghiscari Empire
   and the
   Valyrian Freehold
   , Yi Ti never collapsed due to internal instability. Nor has it ever been been conquered by outside forces. Thus Yi Tish culture has endured unbroken longer than any other civilization on record.

   Yi Ti's religion includes several gods but is focused around two primary deities: the
   Maiden-Made-of-Light
   and the
   Lion of Night

   East Asian
   , we're talking Yi Ti." Elio said Yi Ti was "definitely inspired by
   Imperial China
   ," particularly its rule by divine god-emperors.
   Martin himself also stated in his blog that Yi Ti and surrounding nations are his world's analogue of Far East Asia, and he directly addressed the question of why no East Asian characters figure prominently in the narrative:

   In real-life, early modern Europeans referred to East Asia in general as "the Far East". This term does not exist in Westeros: instead the collective term they consistently use for Yi Ti and the other distant lands east of the
   Bone Mountains
   or around the Jade Sea is "the Further East" (specifically spelled with a "u", even though "farther" with an "a" is more typically used to connote large geographic distance).

   Yi Ti is tropical in climate, with immense jungles just inland and stretching across great swaths of the landscape. Centuries of human civilization, however, have carved out vast patchworks of green farmland from the verdant rainforest; its climate and agricultural patterns are somewhat similar to southern China.

   Few Westerosi has ever traveled all the way to Yi Ti, though a handful of adventurers have made the long journey. Among them was the famous navigator Lord
   Corlys Velaryon
   , father-in-law of
   Rhaenyra Targaryen
   and nicknamed the "Sea Snake". He sailed to Yi Ti nearly 200 years before the
   War of the Five Kings
   and brought back enough rare and valuable spices to make the
   Velaryons
   , for a time, one of the richest families in

   . The famed explorer
   Lomas Longstrider
   also traveled to Yi Ti. A few Westerosi have traveled to Yi Ti and it is known to be a real place, but most people know very little about it, and it is still semi-legendary to people living in Westeros (much more so than

   Shivering Sea
   . The Jogos Nhai are nomadic people who follow the religion of the
   Moonsingers
   . Ships traveling east to Yi Ti and lands beyond have to pass through the Jade Gates, also known as the Straits of Qarth because they are near and controlled by Qarth. Qarth has amassed great wealth by using its fleet to exact tolls from east-west shipping passing through the straits.

   map book was only released in fall 2012, however, between Season 2 and Season 3 of the TV series. The TV series was given an early draft of the world map by Martin at the beginning of Season 2 before he made several major revisions to the geography of the eastern regions. The Viewer's Guide map drew the Jade Sea as extending far to the north of Qarth, almost up to the same latitude as
   <a href="Vaes Dothrak.html" key="1ef79d0c-a1ab-48f5-9c25-5a5321ec4748" title="Vaes Dothrak">

   . The subsequent official map book, however, revealed that Qarth is actually at the extreme northern end of the Jade Sea, and as one proceeds east the shoreline gradually curves to the south, not sharply to the north. In the book-continuity, this means that Yi Ti's capital city Yin is slightly south of Qarth, roughly near the same latitude as
   Old Valyria
   . The HBO Viewer's Guide, however, was not updated to take into account the new official maps produced for the book-continuity: instead, Season 3 onward continued to simply re-use the previous map designs used since Season 2. It is not clear if this is a conscious choice, and that world geography is officially different in the TV continuity from the book continuity, or if this is simply an oversight. As a result, however, it cannot be said with certainty if Yi Ti in the TV continuity is in the same geographic area as it is in the book continuity.

   Similar to the real-life concept of

   Lion of Night
   , a destructive male figure who punishes the wicked, and the
   Maiden-Made-of-Light
   , a female figure who preserves and defends the good. The people of Yi Ti also worship their emperors as living gods: while there have been different dynasties over the millennia, they believe that the very first emperor (eons ago during the

   ) was the only son of the Lion of Night and Maiden-Made-of-Light, known as
   God-on-Earth

   8,000 years ago. Several civilizations have rival claims to be the eldest, particularly Yi Ti, Qarth, and the

Yi Ti claims that it had an even older empire for many thousands of years before that, during the Dawn Age, but which was destroyed during the Long Night and had to be rebuilt. The tales of this Great Empire of the Dawn (as it is known) are grandiose and apparently mostly legend, filled with emperors who lived for centuries and warred with the gods. Still, only a few generations separated the confirmed founding of both; Old Ghis slightly before the Long Night and Yi Ti slightly after - yet Old Ghis was destroyed 5,000 years ago by the rising
   Valyrian Freehold

In comparison, the Ghiscari Empire lasted about 3,000 years and the Valyrian Freehold about 5,000 years. The civilization of Yi Ti is therefore extremely advanced because while it has had its share of civil wars, its society never truly collapsed in the way that western Essos did after the

   Lomas Longstrider described Yi Ti as "the land of a thousand gods and a hundred princes, ruled by one god-emperor." For many millennia, the country has indeed been ruled by a series of divine god-emperors, but in recent centuries their power has greatly diminished, extending no further than the boundaries of the capital city. The real power has come to reside in strong regional princedoms, numbering about a hundred or so but nominally all part of the same empire.

   Yi Ti's original capital city after the Long Night was Yin, a major port on the southern coast at the mouth of a large river. The capital shifted around to different cities over the millennia depending on which dynasty was in power, and at times was in the cities of Tiqui and Jinqi. In the present day, the capital is once again in the ancient city of Yin, with the god-emperor living in a palace nearly the size of

   Yi Ti has a long and extensive history dating back 8,000 years, but only a vague outline of it is known to the maesters in Westeros. Since the Long Night, Yi Ti has been ruled by eleven dynasties of emperors: the longest lasted seven centuries, the shortest only half a century. Sometimes the transitions between dynasties were peaceful, other times they were violent. On four occasions, the fall of one dynasty did not immediately lead to the establishment of a new one, but led to prolonged periods of civil war and anarchy, the longest of which lasted over a century (similar to the
   Three Kingdoms period
   in ancient China), but even this was never enough to outright destroy the literary record, knowledge, and continuous history of Yi Ti's civilization.

    Scarlet Emperors - perhaps the most infamous dynasty. They greatly expanded the empire and strengthened central power. Some were great statesmen, others ruthless but competent, and still others ruthless and incompetent. They moved the capital from Yin to Si Qo (which was left in ruins after their dynasty ended). Many members of the dynasty were wicked and cruel, though Lo Doq ruled wisely and well for thirty years. He survived the numerous assassinations within the imperial family by pretending to be a lackwit struck with an affliction that made him limp and drools when he tried to speak.

   The large island of Leng lies just off the coast south of Jinqi, though it is more of a small "region" than simply an island, as it approaches the
   Disputed Lands
   of the Free Cities in size. The island is heavily forested. Leng was colonized by Yi Ti many centuries ago - "colonized" in the imperial sense, as the island already had native inhabitants, whom the Yi Ti settlers pushed out (loosely similar to the historical tensions on Taiwan island between Chinese settlers and
   Taiwan aborigines
   - or perhaps, of Japan with
   Yamato
   settlers pushing back the indigenous
   Ainu people
   to the north). The Yi Ti settlers started on the northern end of the island, closest to the mainland, and gradually spread southwards, conquering and enslaving the natives. Even the name "Leng" is a Yi Ti name applied to the island. In modern times, three cities are on the island. On the northern tip of the island is Leng Yi, and the central city is Leng Ma: the inhabitants of both cities are descended from Yi Ti settlers. The inhabitants of Turrani, however, at the southern tip of the island, are descended from the original native inhabitants of the island, who resisted the gradual encroachments of Yi Ti settlers from the north.

   About four hundred years ago the Yi Tish settlers on Leng broke away from the rule of the emperors in Yin and set themselves up as an independent nation, ruled by their own

   line of god-empresses. The settlers who revolted against the mainland made common cause with the remaining indigenous Lengii people on the southern third of the island. The Lengii are among the tallest peoples in the world, standing seven to eight feet in height, and very slender, with teak-brown skin. Golden eyes are common amongst the Lengii, and it is said they have sharper eyesight than any other people in the world. Their women are famously beautiful. The people of Leng still "revere" the god-emperor in Yin as part of their religion, but they only "worship" their own line of god-empresses.
