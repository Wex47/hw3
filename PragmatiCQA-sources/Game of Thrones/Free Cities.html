Also known as the "hidden city" - as its existence was kept secret for many years after its founding - Braavos was not devastated by the loss of central Valyrian control the way that the other eight Free Cities were, and after the dragonlords perished in the Doom, Braavos was happy to stop hiding its true power from the world. The city gradually increased in strength while the others were tearing themselves apart in civil wars, and in the present-day Braavos is now considered the most powerful of the Free Cities, with extensive control of the sea trade and large fleets of both merchant ships and war galleys - in contrast with how Volantis has the largest and strongest land armies.

   has stated that the Freehold is essentially his fantasy world's equivalent of the Roman Empire, so the Free Cities would be his equivalent of the medieval Italian city-states which formed in the centuries following the empire's collapse. Lorath, Tyrosh, and Lys are located on islands off the coasts, while Norvos and Qohor are inland to the east. The rest are major seaports on the mainland. Since they cover a large area, the Free Cities actually have quite wide variations in climate: Myr, Tyrosh, Lys and Volantis possess warm, coastal climates similar to the Mediterranean, while Norvos and Qohor have continental climates more similar to France or Germany (though culturally, they are not even remotely similar to anything found in medieval Europe).
  </p>
  <p key="ae943510-c1e3-4864-a143-66fd937bd9b0">
   Officially, the term "Free City" refers to a system of government; the cities' founders purchased contracts from the Freehold to exercise semi-autonomous rule over their internal affairs, though the Valyrian
   dragonlords
   still set their external policies (such as the
   wars
   with the

   people). This is somewhat similar to the
   "free imperial cities"
   of the Holy Roman Empire in the real-life Middle Ages, with their own local governments answerable only to the German emperor. Because they already had a measure of self-governance, the Free Cities were able to survive the chaos following the Doom of Valyria more or less intact. In contrast, many direct colonies - which were totally dependent on Valyria itself - did not fair nearly as well. Only a few of these direct colonies in and around the Valyrian peninsula survived:
   Mantarys
   ,
   Tolos
   , and
   Elyria
   .

   Volantis was the first colony founded by the Valyrian Freehold in western Essos. Its citizens consider themselves the true heirs to the old empire and still carry on many of its traditions. Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh were established as mercantile centers; in these cities, trade is considered the most honorable profession, and personal wealth counts for more than birth or lineage. Lorath, Norvos, and Qohor were founded by religious dissidents who wanted to escape the widespread tolerance of the Freehold and practice their own beliefs without interference. Due to its central location, Pentos is something of a hybrid between the northern and southern Free Cities and shares qualities from both general groups.

  <p key="2800f74f-1f2e-4b51-8895-be2db3aa879f">
   Braavos in the far north was founded by a diverse group of slaves fleeing Valyrian tyranny. As a result, it technically wasn't a "Free City" in the sense that all the others were, but by tradition it simply gets lumped in with the rest. For this reason, Braavos is sometimes known as the "Bastard daughter of Valyria". In terms of size, Volantis is physically the largest city and the most populous, but Braavos is now the richest and most powerful. Volantis has the largest army, but Braavos has the largest navy and greatest financial power.
