Jon turns and asks how she was able to sneak up on him, prompting Arya to ask how he survived a knife to the heart. Jon responds, "I didn't". Arya runs to Jon and they embrace, Jon lifting Arya in his arms. Jon asks Arya if she still has Needle and Arya unsheathes it. He asks if she's ever had to use it and Arya quietly responds, "Once or twice." After a silence, Jon shows her Longclaw. Arya admires it but remarks it's too heavy for her. Jon confides that he could have used her help with Sansa in the Great Hall and Arya surmises that Sansa doesn't like Daenerys. Jon says that Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone but, to Jon's confusion, Arya defends her sister. She states Sansa is the smartest person she knows and is defending her family. Arya tells him not to forget he's family too and hugs him.

   After Strickland leaves, Euron arrogantly propositions Cersei to have sex with him, as a reward for his successfully completed task. Cersei is not amused by his brashness and tells him as much, but as she badly needs her remaining allies, she accepts. Later that night, after they have finished, Cersei is still bitter about her lack of elephants. She sips at a glass of wine while Euron asks how he compared to her former husband King

Tormund and Beric worry that the White Walkers' army will reach Winterfell first, but the wights are slow moving and on foot, and Edd's men brought horses which they can ride to outpace them. As they discuss what to do, Umber re-animates as a wight, trying to grab Tormund but unable to free himself from the wall. Beric sets his sword on fire to kill the wight, which bursts into flame at its touch, also igniting the symbol of the spiral.

    This episode achieved record viewership numbers. According to the narrowly defined Nielsen figures - which only measure people who watched it live on the HBO TV channel - viewership was 11.8 million on first viewing, surpassing the Season 7 premiere's 10.1 million (and falling just slightly short of the record setting 12.1 million of the Season 7 finale). The overnight and streaming services audience is much larger - particularly with the rapid growth of streaming services year by year - but is also less easy to measure. Tentative estimates put the combined overnight and streaming viewership for the Season 8 premiere at

Apparently the nearly two year long gap between Season 7 and Season 8 did not result in a decline in site traffic once the active airing season resumed. The record high one-day traffic for the wiki was 9.1 million, which happened twice: after the Season 6 finale, and again after the Season 7 finale.

    Lyanna Mormont notes her confusion as to how Jon should be referred now that he isn't King in the North. Because Jon retained his bastard surname after being crowned, it stands to reason that he wouldn't be a lord even after losing his crown. This appears to confirm that Jon, despite being crowned and later given the title and position of Warden of the North, still does not carry the right to be considered a Lord. This can be confusing as merely three episodes later, Gendry expressed to Daenerys that he can't be Lord of Storm's End due to his bastard status. Why Jon is exempt from this is never fully explained, and could be considered a minor plot hole.

Davos states that the Northmen are loyal to Jon, and that they - as well as the freefolk - do not know Daenerys, and would never accept her as their Queen. He mentions how stubborn they are, and how their loyalty must be earned. Davos raises the possibility of a marriage alliance between Jon and Daenerys being beneficial for the security of the realm. He refers to their potential union as that of a "just queen and an honorable man." Varys dismisses this suggestion, however, saying that Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to "lonely old men." He says the young respect the wisdom of the old, but keep them at a distance because the old remind them that "nothing lasts." Since Varys only acts in the interest of the realm, this suggests that he thinks either their union would not be for the best, or that it won't last.

      physically possible for someone to instantly bond with a dragon the way that Jon Snow does with Rhaegal - provided that they are a member of the Targaryen bloodline (some candidates were roasted alive, others quickly bonded - dragons are fickle).

The real issue with the scene is that neither Jon Snow, or more importantly Daenerys, even

      In the Inside the Episode featurette, showrunners Benioff and Weiss discuss their ideas for this subplot at some length, and apparently they had a lot more ideas for it than actually appear in the episode. They wanted Jon and Daenerys's romance to have some connection to dragon-riding, and state that the waterfall they land near was actually Jon showing off his childhood hunting grounds to her (though how they came to his hunting grounds if

They do remark that Jon is somewhat oblivious about how significant it is that he can ride a dragon - though in fairness, even in the books, Jon Snow hasn't been exposed to dragons and might simply be unaware of bonding with one means he must be of Targaryen blood. Daenerys, however, should be aware of how significant this is.

      Daenerys cheerfully tells Jon to just hold on to any part of the dragon he can, and ride it as best he can. Daenerys's dragons aren't big enough to ride yet in the current novels - except at the very end of the fifth novel, when she unexpectedly rides Drogon out of Meereen. Otherwise, it is a

       commonly known
      </i>
      historical detail that the Targaryens rode dragons using custom-made saddles, big enough to fit them. Additionally, the riders were chained down to these saddles - so if the dragon banked too quickly or flew in a loop they wouldn't just fall off. It is bizarre that by this point in the TV series, Daenerys hasn't attempted to have more permanent saddles made for her dragons.

        As for how to ride a dragon, the historical Targaryens used riding whips much like used on a horse - but made of steel chains, as anything less wouldn't really get their attention. When Daenerys rides Drogon at the end of book five, she quickly notices a basic difference between riding a dragon and riding a horse: horses are prey animals, but dragons are predators, and thus their reactions are different. Horse-riders must strike their mount on the

         opposite

        side from the direction they want it to turn: if the rider wants a horse to turn right, they need to strike it on the left side, and as a prey animal it will turn away from the perceived threat. In contrast, dragons are aggressive predators, so if the rider strikes them on the left side, they will turn left -
        <i key="f80c0ce2-e2fe-449f-90b8-1b23d1ee519a">

          The aforementioned method, however, does not work on Drogon, as Daenerys soon finds out: since he is so strong (and as a teenage girl, she is so small), the whip only annoys him. Daenerys recalls legends that the dragonlords of old Valyria controlled their mounts with binding spells and sorcerous horns, but she has neither, only a word and a whip, which are not helpful. Even the early Targaryen kings at least had prior experience with dragons, but Daenerys only has trial and error. Drogon lets Daenerys ride on his back, but not to control him; neither the whip nor words can turn him if he does not wish to be turned, thus she is unable to return to Meereen.

    during their migrations is that the First Men used bronze weapons and armor, which are much more durable than obsidian. Dragonglass is razor-sharp and very effective as an arrow-head or for slashing daggers, but it is already so brittle that it shatters under force (thus dragonglass arrowheads actually cannot penetrate metal armor). In Season 7 production interviews, writer
    Dave Hill
    admitted that they made an outright change from the novels when they established that wights are vulnerable to dragonglass weapons, just like the White Walkers. In the novels, only
    <i key="3d3d8f14-85e1-4ca1-9752-03768889547c">

    can kill wights, and dragonglass has no special effect on them. Apparently this change was made in order to make practical fight scenes (dozens of flaming stunt men in fire-suits would be too much of a safety risk). Thus Gendry "forging" Sandor an entirely new battle-axe made of obsidian (as opposed to even an axe with obsidian edges attached to it) probably won't happen in a future novel.

    In Season 7, after Cersei got pregnant with another child by Jaime, she noticeably stopped drinking wine - which she'd been heavily self-medicating with since the war began. In this episode, however, she is shown drinking a glass of wine after having sex with Euron - this may possibly be a hint by the writers that Cersei had a miscarriage and isn't pregnant anymore. It's unclear if in the books, people understand that drinking alcohol while pregnant can potentially damage an unborn child - but the TV writers may have just decided that maesters do know about it, in order to include a visual hint.

The Golden Company is the largest and most refined sellsword company in all of the Free Cities, and at this very high end of the spectrum, they are organized as a formally structured and will-disciplined private army, with their own officers and commanders.

At the time it wasn't clear if this was a mistake or a retcon, but given that this is now the number that has consistently been given through Season 8, the TV-version is now officially retconned to 20,000 men. In the books, they also had 1,000 horses - and thus 1,000 men were cavalry, the other 9,000 infantry. The TV show similarly doubled this to 2,000 horses (apparently meaning they have 2,000 cavalry, and 18,000 infantry).

She said that showrunners Benioff and Weiss had to spend a lot of time arguing to her that Cersei is a survivor, and would do anything to survive.
    In this case, Benioff and Weiss were correct on several points: in the books, Cersei actually has sex with

    The scene of Euron and Yara seems loosely based on "The Forsaken" sample chapter: Aeron is held captive in Euron's ship; Euron keeps taunting and tormenting Aeron, physically and emotionally; Aeron defiantly tells Euron to kill him and get it over with, but Euron refuses, claiming that he wouldn't kill his little brother. This statement is nonsense, of course, since Euron has already revealed to Aeron, in his previous visit, that he killed three of his brothers, two of them (Harlon and Robin) by his own hands, and
    had Balon killed
    too, presumably by hiring a
    Faceless Man
    . He also says enigmatically that "

    " - which seems to be the real reason for keeping Aeron alive; it is speculated he intends to use
    sorcery
    in the imminent naval battle against the Redwyne fleet, and for that purpose he has captured Aeron and other sorcerers (one of whom is perhaps
    Pyat Pree
    ).

      No clear reason was ever given for why Euron would take Yara prisoner instead of simply killing her outright, and presenting her corpse to Cersei as a gift. Since he killed his own brother Balon, it is obvious that he does not care about the taboo of
      kinslaying
      . Euron currently keeps Aeron captive in the books, but because he intended to use him as a sacrifice. The only reason in the TV show might just be that he's insane and enjoys tormenting her.

    The last of the guards that is killed on Euron's ship, as Theon drives an axe into his head, was also a cameo - by the episode's own writer,
    Dave Hill
    . He is difficult to recognize, of course, due to first appearing on-screen after the axe is already firmly planted in his face. It actually took four and a half hours to apply all of the prosthetic injury makeup to him.

    's men sneak onto Euron's ship using bows and arrows to quietly kill the crew, but Theon himself uses an axe. In the books, Ramsay Snow actually cut off his index and middle finger from one hand, and his pinky from the other, making it impossible for him to use a bow well again (as he used to be an expert shot); Theon has been reduced to such a poor shape that he cannot fight in any manner, shooting arrows or hand-to-hand combat. The TV show only depicted him losing his pinky finger - probably because it would have been difficult to digitally remove the actor's fingers from many shots. Whatever the case, his use of an axe instead of a bow may be a nod towards this.

Yara is still in the North as of the most current novel, but develops hopes that she can ally with the Drowned Men to have Euron's

    taken captive by Stannis

In "The Spoils of War", he angrily reminds Jaime that he still has not received the promised reward; Jaime gives Bronn a bag of gold and promises that after they win the war, Bronn can choose from any castle he likes - but then Bronn lost the bag of gold in the ensuing battle.

      In the books, Bronn actually married Lollys, and went on to have a running subplot in which his steady rise in fortunes throughout the books continued: as a result of one of Cersei's half-baked schemes, Bronn killed the husband of Lollys's older sister
      Falyse
      , causing her to flee (and later be killed in Cersei's dungeons). Bronn started out as a random wandering sellsword that Tyrion met at an inn in the first book - but by the end of the fifth novel, he has become the acting Lord of House Stokeworth, with several hundred swords at his command. The TV show cut all of this out, and instead sent Bronn with Jaime to

Qyburn's words are incorrect: Tyrion has never broken any promise he made to Bronn, and it is unlikely that Jaime acted behind Cersei's back to deny him of his reward.

    may no longer exist as a formal organization by this point. Their numbers were gutted after Thorne's rebellion at the beginning of Season 6, and Jon Snow re-garrisoned their castles using wildlings (who did not "join" the Watch). Dolorous Edd was simply left in charge as Acting Lord Commander because so few men were left. For years beforehand, the declining numbers of the Watch meant they only manned three out of the nineteen castles on the Wall anymore:

    , and the
    Shadow Tower
    at the western end. In this episode, Jon cites that there isn't really a reason to defend the other castles after the massive breach at the eastern end of the Wall, so he sends messages to the remaining garrisons to abandon them and fall back to Winterfell. The few survivors of the attack on Eastwatch then run into Dolorous Edd and the retreating garrison from Castle Black when they both reach Last Hearth. Presumably the garrison from the Shadow Tower, and any others Jon recently stationed men at, retreated south as well.
