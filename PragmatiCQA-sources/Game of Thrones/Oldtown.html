   Oldtown is almost as large and populous as King's Landing, but is far cleaner, more beautiful and more efficiently run. King's Landing was rapidly constructed within the first century of rule by the
   <a href="House Targaryen.html" key="c2a72cc3-5c1b-447c-a413-168f0c6361d0" title="House Targaryen">

   . This rapid expansion didn't keep pace with organized "city-planning", resulting in numerous slums forming such as the district known as
   Flea Bottom
   . Many of these slum districts are poorly organized, ugly, and filthy because their placement wasn't thought out during the rush to slap down new buildings. By contrast, Oldtown is thousands of years old and grew only in incremental steps which were well planned out beforehand. The result is that Oldtown is a much better organized and beautiful city without the squalid slums of King's Landing, while being only slightly smaller than the capital itself. Oldtown also has its own City Watch, separate from the

   septs
   . It has an immense port which plays host to ships from across the Seven Kingdoms, the

   Oldtown has had the misfortune, as a large city, of being struck twice by major plagues in the past century. In 209 AC, a great pandemic known as the
   Great Spring Sickness
   swept across all of the Seven Kingdoms. It killed tens of thousands, particularly in the major cities. It was bad in
   Lannisport
   , worse in Oldtown, but worst of all in King's Landing, where two out of every five persons died. The death count wasn't quite as severe in Oldtown, but still high. Only one generation later, during
   <a href="Pycelle.html" key="01dbf459-d205-46af-8b5f-597a00e6a59f" title="Pycelle">

   's youth (220s to 230s AC), Oldtown itself was hit by an even worse disease, the "grey plague" (a more deadly cousin of
   <a href="Greyscale.html" key="6cc9c278-469a-4c17-8ab3-2ba8ea6f15b4" title="Greyscale">
    Greyscale

   ). According to Pycelle, the outbreak killed up to half of Oldtown's population, and three quarters of the maesters in the Citadel. The only reason it didn't become another, even more destructive pandemic is because Lord Quenton Hightower ordered the gates of the city sealed and all ships in the harbor burned to prevent the disease being spread further. While this did prevent another pandemic, many trapped inside the city's quarantine caught the disease from those who were already sick, and perished. After the quarantine ended, the survivors dragged Lord Quenton and his young son from their horses and slit their throats. By the time of the

   , some seventy years later, Oldtown's population is slightly smaller than that of King's Landing, but it may have been larger over a century ago, before the double-blow of these two epidemics, and when King's Landing was smaller.

   No one knows exactly how old the city really is, as it's true origins stretch back before history and into oral tradition. There was always a major settlement at the mouth of the Honeywine (though it did grow and expand considerably over the millennia). The First Men apparently founded the original town that later became a city relatively soon after they first began migrating into Westeros 12,000 years ago, across the nearby
   land-bridge
   at the time linking

   . A few maesters argue that there may have been even earlier settlements at the mouth of the Honeywine that the First Men built over - perhaps a trading post maintained by anyone from the
   Valyrians
   to the

   to the Summer Islanders (or a combination of them), where their fishing fleets could take on fresh water and perhaps even trade with the non-human races that dominated Westeros's wild forests at the time (the

   ). The base of the Hightower and underground levels seem to be the remnant of some ancient structure, made of an oily black stone found in a few other ruins across the world. The evidence, however, is very sketchy and inconclusive.

   Oldtown bears many similarities to real-life
   . This Egyptian city - founded in the 4th Century BCE by Alexander the Great - was (and still is) a major port on the Mediterranean Sea, receiving ships and cargoes from all over the world. The Citadel of Oldtown, with its enormous library and status as a place of learning, is very similar to the famed Library of Alexandria, the pre-eminent educational center of its time. Perhaps most strongly, the Hightower of Oldtown is a clear parallel to Alexandria's famous lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
