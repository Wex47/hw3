Jon replies that Daenerys shouldn't be alone and Varys admires that Jon is worried for her.

She tells Tyrion that he told Varys, "You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her," and thus feels Jon has betrayed her. Tyrion says he needs to be aware of this information so that he and Varys can be prepared for anything Daenerys might face, but Daenerys is suspicious of Sansa's motives for telling Tyrion. Tyrion admits it was a mistake to tell Varys without Daenerys's permission and Sansa told Tyrion because she trusts him. Daenerys responds, "She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down." Tyrion asks for Daenerys's forgiveness, saying they want the better world she wants and their intentions were good, "Varys as much as anyone. But it doesn't matter now."

Give them that chance." When he does, he will ring the city's bells, indicating the full, unconditional surrender of Cersei and her army. He pleads with her not to attack unless he's done this deed. Reluctantly, Daenerys agrees. Before Tyrion leaves, she informs her Hand that

Davos is trying to usher people to safety while an increasingly fearful Cersei looks on from the Red Keep in alarm as the carnage continues and fire comes down from above. On the ground, Jon finds one of the soldiers grabbing an innocent woman and intervenes to stop the soldier from raping her. The soldier attacks Jon and Jon is forced to kill him.

He and Jaime fight, saying that he will personally deliver Jaime's severed head to Cersei so she can kiss it one last time. Although Euron stabs Jaime multiple times, Jaime is able to overpower Euron and impales him through the stomach with his sword. He walks away, severely injured, as Euron utters his final words, smiling: "I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister."

Gregor beats down Sandor and lifts him up against the wall, preparing to gouge out his eyes. Just as Gregor does this, Sandor grabs a knife from his side and stabs Gregor clean through his eye. Even this does nothing to stop Gregor, who begins pulling the knife from his eye. Knowing that none of his attacks will truly kill Gregor, Sandor knows what he must do. Mustering up enough courage to face his fears, Sandor runs and tackles Gregor through the badly damaged wall behind, sending them both hurtling hundreds of feet into the fiery remains of the city.

   Cersei is all alone in her castle when she sees Jaime, bloodied and badly wounded following his fight with Euron. The two of them go deep into the Red Keep, where Tyrion had told Jaime to go where there would be a boat waiting for them on the beach to take them away from the city. However, they find their path has been blocked by rubble. A frightened Cersei begins to cry, saying that she does not want to die. Jaime tells her not to look at the crumbling keep, "Look at me, just look at me. Nothing else matters, nothing else matters, only us." Hearing the Keep above them caving in, the twins embrace for the last time as the ceiling caves in on them, killing them both.

    The pale white horse found by Arya at the end of the episode may be a reference to the Book of Revelation from the Christian Bible: Revelation 6:8 refers to a rider of the white or ashen horse being death, and where ever the white horse goes, death follows with it. Arya was affiliated with the
    Many-Faced God
    of Death, and the horse is leaving behind a burning city with thousands dead.

     <li key="14e27538-4f35-4434-952d-08fbecb5db63">
      An interesting theory, however, an ashen or pale horse is more grey in color.  A white horse has a different meaning in the Book of Revelations: "So I looked and saw a white horse, and its rider had a bow. And he was given a crown, and he rode out to overcome and conquer." Then a later verse states, "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war…"

Therefore, she started with a dive bombing run from above the clouds and stayed on the move once she got into firing range, using strafing instead of bombing maneuvers. Second, while the scorpions' piercing power and possibly reload time were greatly improved, it seems that their turn speed and aiming time were the same as the earlier models, again meaning that all Daenerys needed to do was keep on the move.

    says there are a million people in King's Landing. Still, it does not mean the number is correct; Tyrion might have spoken loosely, underscoring the fact that there are many innocent people who may be killed. Or, it may be possible that he's referring to the addition of the numerous small folk that have entered from the surrounding countryside, as seen in the episode.

   <li key="e4bd374b-f607-453d-b3d1-8fa488c25169">
    Cersei's death does not necessarily refute Maggy's prophecy about the "Valonqar" (a prophecy that was only made in the books). In view of how far the TV show has strayed from the novels, and how much Jaime has grown to hate and loathe Cersei throughout the fourth novel (he even contemplates killing her) - it is still possible that he will be the one to kill her in the novels, according to one of the most common fan speculations about the aforementioned prophecy. It can also be argued that Jaime did indeed kill Cersei, unintentionally leading her to the collapsing tunnels beneath the Red Keep.

   <li key="a556ec74-dd1b-4207-8059-efd0867539b0">
    Jaime's statement "I never really cared much for them [the residents of King's Landing]" totally contradicts what he wholeheartedly told to Brienne in "Kissed by Fire" - that he killed Aerys in order to save those people; this is also reason he joined the northern troops in the fight against the army of the dead ("I promised to fight for the living"). It is unclear why Jaime would make such a false statement, which is in sharp contrast to his previous words and deeds, and shows him in a very bad light. There are several possible explanations: perhaps he was simply being defeatist (as he clearly did not believe that he would be able to convince Cersei to change her course of action); perhaps he no longer believed himself worthy of redemption (after choosing to go back to Cersei); or possibly his attitude may have been an attempt to dissuade Tyrion from freeing him, knowing that it would lead to Tyrion's execution.

    It is unknown why Yara has not joined Daenerys's forces, after she has
    taken the Iron Islands
    (as reported in the previous episode). Maybe Yara's loyalists are currently too few, and she has not yet established her reign over the Iron Islands, thus could not rally sufficient forces to assist Daenerys; another possibility is that she had to keep her forces nearby, in case Euron returned and attempted to overthrow her.
