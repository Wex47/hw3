   Tyrion later plays a drinking game with her and Bronn in an attempt to learn more about Shae's past, but she refuses to reveal specifics. Tyrion tells her that he thinks her mother was a whore and her father deserted them, she says emphatically that he is wrong, and she doesn't want to speak of them. He seems more on the mark when he talks of her ambitions until he gets to the part of saying she was low born, she indicates he is wrong, thus she was not low-born. Shae deflects Tyrion's questions and learns about his past instead, particularly the incident involving his marriage to
   Tysha
   . When Tyrion was 16, he fell in love and secretly married a young wheelwright's daughter whom he helped protect from two rapists, but the girl turned out to be a prostitute hired by Jaime to make a man of him. When

Meanwhile, Ros, who seems to be acting as Littlefinger's aide, reminisces about the day Sansa was born, when all the bells in Winterfell were rung in celebration. Ros asks Shae to watch out for Sansa, particularly in regards to Littlefinger. Shae replies that she is always watching out for her.

  <p key="6a3b9373-7e53-4a53-b91b-4dbc3e95c0e7">
   When dressing Sansa in her chambers, she heeds Ros' advice and warns Sansa about Littlefinger, pointing out that Baelish has offered to help Sansa for nothing in return because he's after something. Sansa naively says that he's an old friend of her mother's, but Shae suggests that Baelish is actually sexually attracted to Sansa. This disturbs Sansa, but she thinks it is simply impossible, as Baelish is so much older than her. Shae continues to warn Sansa that Baelish is manipulative and men usually only want "one thing" from pretty young ladies, and "love" often isn't what they're after.
  </p>
  <p key="c2814dfb-bdbe-42be-9563-f1f6597f2628">
   Later, Shae sneaks into Tyrion Lannister's new chambers and, despite his warnings that his father threatened to kill her if he found her with him again, she starts undressing Tyrion and asks him to protect Sansa from Baelish. Tyrion says that he doesn't have enough power or influence any more to attempt to do that, though Shae accuses him of being attracted to Sansa, which he cheerfully denies. It also comes out that Tyrion had sex with Ros back in the North, though Tyrion points out it was before he met Shae. They playfully bicker about it as they start having sex.

   When Tyrion is forcibly promised to wed Sansa by his father, he decides to go to Sansa's chamber but finds Shae with her. He asks for a private word, but Shae wants to be there and Sansa declines to dismiss her. Tyrion gives Shae a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to Sansa. Later, while Littlefinger departs the city without Sansa, Shae is with her as she weeps looking at his outgoing ship, which he had previously offered as an escape, but was rebuffed in favour of her hopes of being engaged to Loras Tyrell.

   Having found out that Tyrion and Sansa are to be wed, she gets extremely annoyed with Tyrion, because she realizes that she will see him less and thinks he might be attracted to Sansa. Tyrion gives her golden chains as a gift, but she immediately refuses to accept them and says she is nothing more than a whore to him.
   After Tyrion's wedding night, Shae angrily comes into the chamber to take the bedsheets but, when she sees no sign that their marriage was consummated, she is pleased.

   Shae becomes increasingly marginalised as Sansa and Tyrion grow closer, which, although increasingly platonic, makes Shae feel somewhat isolated. However, both Tyrion and Shae silently find humour in Sansa's naivety and innocence when it comes to vulgarity. Shae later watches the ships in the bay when Varys comes to speak with her. He tells her that she can't spend her life with Tyrion even though she obviously loves him, because Tyrion is the last hope for the Seven Kingdoms' current regime. Shae is his greatest weakness, which neither Tyrion nor the realm can afford.

However, he tells her that it is not a good time and says he has far too many problems. She is nervous because he already has rejected her many times in the same fashion and she is afraid that he does not love her anymore. Tyrion assures her that she is the only woman he loves and Sansa is only a child whom he had to marry. Then she furiously mentions that Varys tried to give her diamonds for her departure and asks if Tyrion had anything to do with it. After a moment of silence, she leaves the room very annoyed. Her presence is noticed by Cersei's spy, who immediately goes to tell the Queen about Shae.

   , a breakfast is hosted by Joffrey and Margaery, and Shae is present. Cersei informs her father that Shae is the whore that Tyrion brought to the capital against his wishes. Varys meets Tyrion and tells him that he has friends across the Narrow Sea who could help Shae if she were to leave King's Landing. Tyrion is reluctant at first, but when Varys reminds him of Tywin's threat, he starts to consider the option. Cersei spots her and points her out to Tywin. He then tells Cersei to have Shae brought to the
   Tower of the Hand
   before the wedding. Shae visits Tyrion is his chambers again and he tells her she will leave with the ship that is waiting for her in the bay.

   She assures him that she isn't afraid and is willing to fight Cersei and Tywin together with Tyrion, but he tells her that she is a whore, while he is a married man and although he enjoyed the time spent with her, that time is over. She starts to cry heavily. Tyrion tells her that she will have a comfortable life in Pentos and Bronn will escort her to her ship. When Bronn tries to touch her, she slaps him and runs away. When Tyrion later asks Bronn if she is gone, he says that she boarded the ship. When Tyrion asks if he saw it sail away, Bronn assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her, that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and Varys. He then advises Tyrion to go drink until it feels like he did the right thing.

   , Shae appears as the final witness of the crown, clearly having been found by Cersei's agents. She falsely accuses Tyrion of having kidnapped her and forced her to become his whore after which she witnessed Tyrion and Sansa plan the murder together, accusing Sansa of desiring revenge and forcing Tyrion into co-operating by denying him entrance into her bed.

   , one of the trial judges, openly questions Shae's story, clearly unconvinced. Broken, Tyrion pleads with Shae to stop, only for her to defaintly turn to him and remind him that she is a whore (mirroring what he said to her in order to convince her to leave). He repudiates his father's deal for him to join the

   Later on, after Tyrion is broken free by Jaime Lannister, he stops and goes to the tower of the hand with the intent of confronting his father, only to discover Shae is lying in his bed wearing the golden chains Tyrion gifted to her. She sees him and grabs a knife to kill him, but Tyrion jumps on her and they struggle for a while. Upon realising that Shae intends to kill him, Tyrion retaliates and by grabbing the chain and strangling her to death with it. Horrified at what he has done, Tyrion silently apologizes to Shae's corpse, and takes
   Joffrey's crossbow
   from the wall and goes on to murder Tywin in the privy after the latter calls Shae a "whore" one too many times, before escaping to

    Personality

  </h2>
  <p key="9faefa88-7832-41ec-a685-ce4e3bd2f431">
   Shae began as a curt, willingly mysterious woman with a cynical attitude and a sharp, often biting tongue. Being a prostitute for most of her life, forced to sell her body (initially by her own mother) since age nine for men whom treat her like a mindless sex object to survive has left her somewhat jaded as she refuses to say anything about herself or past life and wishes to not care about the concerns or wellbeing of others. It was Tyrion who observed that Shae wanted a different life than the one she had then. Beneath this she is a much more loving, loyal and strong-willed woman who will protect those who treat her well. As stated by others she knows how to defend herself and gets by using her skills in self-defence as well as her voluptuousness and sex appeal.
  </p>
  <p key="e3532c4d-1ea8-4f58-b022-e6ef2050234b">
   Up until her betrayal, Shae genuinely cared about other people. Despite her relationship with Tyrion beginning as a customer/employer one they grew to love one another, that being said during their run they did endure tribulations which tested both of their wills. Her decisions to stay with Tyrion even when his face was wounded after the Battle of the Blackwater and refusing Varys' offer to leave King's Landing in return for diamonds proves she was not the shallow whore she painted herself out to be. Tyrion's love for Shae was so great that even after she incriminates him at his trial for killing King Joffrey he admits to Tywin that he still loved her. She also grows attached to Sansa Stark as she disguises herself as her handmaiden. She goes as far to threaten a handmaiden with a knife if she told the Queen about her flowering and Sansa felt comfortable confiding her disgust over Joffrey with Shae.
  </p>
  <p key="661ef665-5806-4ce7-a81b-fc698b93af78">
   Shae, however, is not without her own insecurities. Although throughout his marriage with Sansa, Tyrion assures that he has no romantic feelings for her whatsoever and even refuses to consummate their wedding she allows her jealousy to get the better of her, feeling envious over Sansa's highborn status and great beauty as Shae a common handmaiden and even worse, whore can not hope to have a relationship with a Lord. Moreover when Tyrion could not leave King's Landing with her as he has to fulfil his duty as a Lannister she believes he enjoys his marriage with her and will forget her eventually. Tyrion preys on these insecurities later on by degrading her as a whore and treating their relationship as if it was another encounter and she leaves King's Landing in tears.
  </p>
  <p key="f2660692-31c4-4f13-8db5-ad250a7a6a32">
   When she did return to the city, her jealousy was replaced by bitterness and anger. With her suspicions over Tyrion and Sansa seemingly confirmed she incriminates the two of them further by saying they planned King Joffrey's assassination together and manipulating his words of love to antagonise and humiliate him during his trial. She goes further by having an affair with his father, Tywin who has an equal amount of hatred for his son and outwardly attacks Tyrion when he finds her in his father's bedchambers either out of fear that he was there to kill her or initial anger. She ends up being strangled with the chains that symbolised their love.
