   . However, one fateful day four hundred years ago a cataclysm - which became known in later years simply as "the Doom" - laid waste to the Valyrian capital, its people, and the surrounding lands. The string of volcanoes near Valyria known as the
   Fourteen Fires
   exploded in a massive eruption, consuming the city of Valyria in ash and flame, and the entire region was wracked by corresponding earthquakes. The
   Valyrian Peninsula
   itself was shattered and the ocean came sweeping in, becoming the area now known as the
   Smoking Sea
   - which no sailor dares cross and which is believed to be haunted by demons.

  <p key="ec57ba3f-0b66-42d8-ab3c-74e0122767b4">
   The exact cause of the Doom remains unknown: some believe the volcanic eruption was a natural disaster, while others believe it was inadvertently triggered by the Valyrians' own sorcery. Whatever the cause, Valyria was destroyed, and all their dragons were lost with it, along with Valyrian recorded history, spells, and knowledge. With its center of power destroyed, the Freehold collapsed. Of the mighty families of dragonlords who ruled the Freehold, only one survived,

   , which had re-established itself on
   Dragonstone
   in Westeros years before the Doom. Most importantly, the Targaryens on Dragonstone possessed the only Valyrian dragons that survived the Doom, the only remaining dragons in the known world.

While the other Valyrian colonies were left in chaos, Braavos was an island of stability because it had no political or economic ties with the Freehold, and quickly rose to become the most powerful of the Free Cities.

   Valyria has remained a smoking ruin in the four centuries since the Doom. Even attempts to pass through it, much less resettle it, end in disaster - to the point that even pirates are too afraid to sail through the Smoking Sea. Ships rounding the Valyrian Peninsula make sure to stay a long distance away from the mainland, due to the belief that demons and other dangers still haunt the region. The Free Cities exile some victims of advanced

   novels, the Doom of Valyria was an epochal event which dramatically changed the course of world history. Massive tidal waves caused by the eruptions and earthquakes resulted in giant tsunamis which struck many far away coasts. The three major cities of Slaver's Bay were shielded from the tsunamis by the Isle of Cedars, a large island between the bay and Valyria; however cities on the Isle of Cedars were swept away by the waves, and the island has been uninhabited ever since.

   The Doom occurred in exactly the year 114 BC, 112 years before the Targaryen conquest of Westeros began in 2 BC. Twelve years before the Doom, in 126 BC, Aenar Targaryen relocated his entire household to
   Dragonstone
   , a small volcanic island off the east coast of Westeros. The Targaryens were one of the forty major families of dragonlords in the Valyrian Freehold, though they were not one of the more powerful ones. Aenar was encouraged to flee Valyria by the prophetic dreams of his daughter, which warned of the coming disaster. Along with them the Targaryens took five dragons, who became the only dragons to survive the Doom. Balerion was one of these, but the other four later died through unrevealed circumstances. They did leave eggs behind, however, and from these hatched Vhagar and Meraxes.

   The Doom is partially inspired by ancient disasters such as the destruction of Pompeii by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius; author

   has said that the Valyrian Freehold itself is loosely analogous to the Roman Republic in his fantasy world. It is also partially inspired by myths about the fall of Atlantis.
