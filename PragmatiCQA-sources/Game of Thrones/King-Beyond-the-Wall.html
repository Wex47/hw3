   Uniting the fractious and independently-minded tribes - who often have radically different traditions, customs and laws from one another, speak different languages, and are always after each other's throats - into a single force is extremely difficult if not downright impossible. Uniting all of the wildlings is only possible with a very intelligent leader of impressive military skill and personal charisma. Most of the time, the wildlings are nowhere near united.

   It is unclear if there were other Kings-Beyond-the-Wall who did not invade in the past millennium. There have been many other Kings-Beyond-the-Wall in the seven thousand years before that, stretching back to the construction of the Wall about eight thousand years ago.

   Previous Kings-Beyond-the-Wall included Joramun, Gendel, the Horned Lord, Bael the Bard, and Raymun Redbeard. These are only the most famous and successful Kings-Beyond-the Wall, however: given that the Wall has stood for 8,000 years (according to legend) there were assuredly several others in those many millennia, though they apparently met with less success and therefore are not as well-remembered. This also doesn't include the many frequent, though much smaller, raids around or over the Wall by individual wildling tribes. In Season 3 episode 7 "

   ", Jon Snow tells Ygritte that six times in the past one thousand years the Seven Kingdoms have been attacked by a King-Beyond-the-Wall who united all of the wildling tribes, and six times they were defeated. This information is not from the books, however, George R.R. Martin himself wrote the script for that episode.
  </p>
  <p key="112fb7dd-5a15-4b6d-9ba3-b7c76a337bc5">
   Joramun was one of the earliest, if not the first, Kings-Beyond-the-Wall, given that the Night's King is said to have been the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch (in contrast with Jeor Mormont, who was the 997th Lord Commander). Joramun must therefore have lived relatively soon after the Wall was constructed eight thousand years ago. According to legend Joramun awoke giants from the earth using a magical horn and made common cause with the King of the North to destroy the
   Night's King
   , a formidable and evil sorcerer who had taken over the Night's Watch in its infancy.

   Gendel was actually joint king with his brother Gorne. They lived three thousand years ago (after the

   of the south, which was six thousand years ago). The brothers and their army bypassed the Wall by digging an extensive tunnel network underneath it. Eventually their invasion was stopped by the Stark King in the North, and Gendel slain. Gorne retreated back to the tunnels with his surviving followers, never to be seen again. It is suspected that they didn't know the tunnels as well as Gendel did, or that there was a cave in. The Night's Watch destroyed the entrances on the southern side but never explored all of the tunnels. Legend holds that the descendants of Gorne's followers live in the tunnels to this day, having degenerated into feral cave-dwellers.

   After Gendel and Gorne came the Horned Lord, whose name is lost to history, and who allegedly used sorcery to pass the Wall. His invasion occurred either one or two thousand years after Gendel and Gorne, the historical record is unclear (though either way, it was in the hazy period over one thousand years before the Targaryen Conquest, which is the period when the Seven Kingdoms as they were later known truly started to coagulate from smaller kingdoms).

   The historical record is particularly murky regarding Bael the Bard. According to legend he lived centuries after Gendel and Gorne, but there are some who deny that he ever actually lived, though the invasion he is associated with is known to have occurred. As the legend goes, Bael infiltrated Winterfell itself disguised as a minstrel, and even seduced the daughter of the current Stark lord and impregnated her. Years later, Bael's son became the new lord of Winterfell, and led his army north to repulse the wildling invasion led by Bael. Ultimately Bael was killed by his own son, and when his mother heard the news she killed herself, because she still loved him. Given that Brandon Stark is referred to as a "Lord" and not "King" in the tale, this may indicate that the invasion took place after the Targaryen Conquest. Mance Rayder, when infiltrating Winterfell in attempt to save "
   Arya Stark
   " from the Boltons, used the alias "Abel the Bard" - perhaps an anagram of Bael.

   Relatives of a King-Beyond-the-Wall are not considered as royalty among the wildlings. Mance's baby son and his sister-in-law Val (both omitted from the show) are referred to as "wildling prince" and "wildling princess" by Stannis, Selyse and their subordinates, but these titles mean absolutely nothing to other wildlings. Jon, who has learned a lot about the wildlings' customs and traditions while traveling with them, explains to them countless times that "the babe is no more a prince than Val is a princess. You do not become King-Beyond-the-Wall because your father was", but his words fall on deaf ears.
