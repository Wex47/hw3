   The Children of the Forest were a sapient species that resembled humans in overall shape but significantly smaller in stature, with adults being no larger than human children. Their facial anatomy is mostly identical to that of a human albeit being very rounded and soft, like that of a young child. They also have disproportionately large and expressive eyes (like human babies), which are set wider in their face than would be normal for a human child of the same height and stature.

   Their skin is shown to be a pale gray-green with an apparent rough to wrinkly tecture, similar in appearence to plants. Similarly, their eyes have been shown to be all lime green in color. Like humans, the Children of the Forest do possess hair, however, they only possess hair on their head and lack eyebrows and body hair. The Children of the Forest also seem to possess an indigo-colored blood.

   by crossing a land bridge known as the Arm of Dorne. The First Men began cutting down the Children's forests, including the sacred weirwood trees, leading them into conflict with the Children. The two races fought
   a desperate series of wars for dominance
   for the next two thousand years, during which the Children of the Forest destroyed the Arm of Dorne and flooded the
   Neck
   through the
   sorcery of their greenseers

   After two thousand years of violence, the Children of the Forest and the First Men fought one another to a standstill. The two races agreed to peaceful coexistence and signed the Pact on the
   Isle of Faces
   in

   The Pact lasted for another two thousand years before the enigmatic

   invaded from the uttermost north, bringing death and destruction to both races. The Children of the Forest allied with the First Men to drive back the White Walkers in the
   War for the Dawn
   eight thousand years ago. After the defeat of the White Walkers, the Children, much-reduced in number, are said to have helped
   Bran the Builder
   raise the

   with their powerful magic to prevent the White Walkers' return.
  </p>
  <p key="92f3d4f0-0756-44ca-be07-be756badab06">
   The Children of the Forest never had a large population to begin with, and they took heavy losses in the struggle against the White Walkers, from which they never truly recovered. Over the following centuries they gradually declined throughout Westeros, until they had all but disappeared by the time the
   Andals
   invaded Westeros
   six thousand years ago.

  <p key="b5496749-c28f-44cc-b3b6-830ecd127003">
   The few who remained were hunted or driven off by the Andals during their conquest of the continent, believing their magic to be an abomination to their Faith of the Seven. The Andals cut down the sacred heart trees in the south (except on the Isle of Faces), but the First Men of the

   , where the Andals would never follow them. By the time that
   Aegon I Targaryen
   conquered and united the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros three hundred years ago, there had been no contact with the Children of the Forest for thousands of years.

  <p key="4351a6d7-f34b-4106-b066-d98360640967">
   According to the knowledge of the

   , the Children are either extinct, or never existed in the first place and are a purely mythical race. This is disputed by the people of the North, who hold that they inherited their worship of the
   Old Gods
   from the Children of the Forest, who were real and have long since departed the realms of men.
