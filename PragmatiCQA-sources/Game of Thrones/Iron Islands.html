   The Iron Islands are small and rocky, swept by fierce storm winds, with poor soil and hardly any natural resources. The few poor crop fields that are present have their rocky soil plowed by thralls, men captured in raids and forced into servitude; even the noble houses of the islands usually cannot afford draft animals, and the
   Old Way
   discourages the ironborn themselves from farming, anyway. While located at roughly the same latitude as the

   Nagga
   the sea dragon, built his hall and throne from her bones, married a mermaid, and ruled for a thousand years. Due to the poor soils and limited natural resources of the Iron Islands, the ironborn adopted a warlike culture of raiders and plunderers. Over the centuries, they developed a reputation as hated reavers who pillaged the weaker settlements on the mainland. Following the
   Burning of Harrenhal
   and the deaths of King
   Harren Hoare
   and his sons, the ironborn were driven back to the Iron Islands. House Greyjoy then became the dominant house and rulers of the Iron Islands.

Ramsay threatens to send more "bits" of Theon unless Balon withdraws his forces from the North. Balon disowns Theon since he disobeyed his orders and cannot further the Greyjoy line. However, Yara disagrees with her father and assembles a strike team of the best killers and warriors in the Iron Islands to rescue her brother from the Boltons.

   Old Wyk
   ,
   Orkmont
   ,
   Pyke
   , and
   Saltcliffe
   . There are also several smaller islets surrounding them, usually considered to be administrative subdivisions of the main seven.
   Lonely Light
   is the smallest and most distant of these, a small atoll of land located eight days' travel northwest of Great Wyk (for comparison, Pyke and Harlaw are only one day's travel apart). Old Wyk was the first of the islands to be settled (despite being located on the far side of the archipelago from the mainland), and the ironborn still hold it to be sacred. Great Wyk is the largest island, and thus the only one on which certain noble Houses derive more of their wealth from the land than the sea (such as
   House Goodbrother
   , which gains its wealth from iron mines in the island's central hills). Harlaw is the second largest island, and is the wealthiest and most densely populated of all the islands. Pyke is currently the strongest due to the Greyjoys' status as overlords of the Iron Islands, but this was not always the case. Before the War of Conquest,
   <a href="House Hoare.html" key="f0bf0830-ffa8-47d7-a48e-e785e80c5bb1" title="House Hoare">

  </p>
  <p key="3601ebac-d80d-409f-b347-2714b8ffcfa6">
   The economic production in the region is mostly centered on fishing in the abundant seas surrounding them - it is estimated that about seven of every ten ironborn families are fishermen (the rest are mostly raiders). The ironborn consider farming and mining to be beneath them, leaving such work to
   thralls
   . The windswept islands have poor rocky soil, really better suited to grazing than farming, whose fields only produce modest crop yields after backbreaking labor. Few landholders can even afford draft animals such as horses, so their stony fields need to be plowed by human labor. The local farms do not produce nearly enough food to feed the islands on their own: it is said that if the waters surrounding the islands were not so abundant for fishing, the ironborn would have surely starved in winters long ago.

   The four largest islands (Great Wyk, Harlaw, Orkmont, and Pyke) do have mines with abundant supplies of iron, lead, and tin. Their large iron supplies are arguably what gave the islands their name (though the ironborn insist that they gained this name due to the iron strength of their inhabitants). The smaller three islands do not have such resources: Old Wyk is still held in high esteem for its holy status as the first settled of the islands, but Blacktyde and Saltcliffe are not considered to be very powerful or notable. Pyke is not as wealthy as Harlaw and Great Wyk, or even Orkmont: instead the Greyjoys were selected to rule all of the islands after the War of Conquest due to their distinguished lineage stretching back to the Dawn Age, and the great respect they already commanded from the other ironborn. Over time their rule did enrich Pyke island (probably through various shipping benefits, etc.) so that the largest town in the Iron Islands is
   Lordsport
   , also on Pyke island (ruled by
   House Botley
   ). Even Lordsport, however, is modestly sized compared to larger trading towns on the mainland.

   The ironborn have several large fleets of ships, mostly smaller longships, which according to a semi-canon source, consist of about 500 ships. The mighty

    Iron Fleet

   , commanded by Victarion Greyjoy, consists of about 100 warships which can stand against the largest warships produced elsewhere in Westeros. However, the ability of the ironborn to build larger ships is compromised by a lack of natural resources.
