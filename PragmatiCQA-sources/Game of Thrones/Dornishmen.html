As a result, the religion is interpreted more loosely in Dorne than in other parts of the Seven Kingdoms (though its followers are no less devout), with several unique variations and local customs. The Rhoynar also switched to speaking the

   In the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, the Dornish have a reputation for being hot-blooded and sexually licentious. Indeed, Dornishmen have more "relaxed" views towards sexuality and love than the rest of Westeros.
   Paramours
   are not shunned or kept in secret: instead they are held in a similar status as a lawful wife or husband, and it is not unusual for noblewomen as well as men to have paramours. The Dornish also have no particular stigma against homosexual behavior. Similarly,
   bastards
   do not carry the stigma of being born out of wedlock and are raised along their trueborn siblings and cousins, though they are still considered poor matches for marriage due to their inability to receive inheritance.

   to invade by land through the mountains and deserts. As a result there is very little Andal blood in the Dornish ethnic makeup, and even less than the First Men, all overlaid by the later Rhoynar migration.

   Houses from the Red Mountains of the west, the Stony Dornishmen, date back to the time of the First Men: the Daynes, Fowlers, and
   Yronwoods
   . A few Andal adventurers did go to Dorne, and many of them intermarried with local noble families to create new ones: these include the Ullers,
   Qorgyles
   , Vaiths,
   Allyrions
   ,
   Jordaynes
   , and
   Santagars
   . Even the Martells were founded by an Andal adventurer named Morgan Martell. Still, this was not a vast migration of an entire people, the way the Andals settled in some other regions: a handful of Andal

   went to Dorne, carved out names for themselves, and eventually intermarried with the local nobility. There were so few of them and they brought so few followers that soon afterwards their impact on Dorne's ethnic makeup was subsumed. Dorne was overwhelming First Men by blood by the time the Rhoynar migrated to Dorne a thousand years ago - Nymeria herself married Mors Martell, and their descendants frequently married the other mostly-Rhoynar families that settled in eastern Dorne, to the point that in modern times the Martells are held up as an example of a family with classic Rhoynar physical features. The only long-standing impact that few Andal adventurers had on Dorne was that they brought about the conversion of the land to the

   The background of the

   and
   Manwoodys
   has not been mentioned, but as Stony Dornishmen they are probably more First Men than Andal, like the Daynes or Yronwoods. In the east, no mention has been made about the background of the Tolands, Gargalens, and Dalts, though either way like the Martells these Salty Dornishmen now have mostly Rhoynar bloodlines.
