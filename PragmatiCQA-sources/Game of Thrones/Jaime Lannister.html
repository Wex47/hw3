Laying in the mud Jaime is mocked and tormented by Locke and his men, giving him horse urine to drink. However Jaime manages to steal a sword, and unsuccessfully tries to fight them off using only his left hand. Jaime is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand, much less wield a sword and must therefore quickly give up trying. His only hope is that one of the men would give him a small dignified death having a sword in his hand. He eventually succumbs to exhaustion and Locke simply warns him that if he tries that again he'll cut off his other hand.

Brienne says she overheard when he earlier managed to talk Locke out of letting his men gang-rape her. Brienne is confused, and asks Jaime why he helped her, but he doesn't answer. Brienne grows angry, claiming that this is the first time Jaime had to face the real world where things people care about get taken away. And that he's pathetically moping around like a woman.

She is out for Tyrion's blood, and he says that the trial is even worse because at least one judge has always wanted him dead. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei offers a knighthood to whomever captures Sansa. Tyrion insists that Sansa had nothing to do with the murder, despite having the best motive.

   Jaime visits Cersei on her request, but is disappointed when she only wishes to know Kingsguard formations for Tommen, concerned with the safety of Tommen following the assassination of Joffrey. She asks him if he would break his oath to Catelyn by hunting down and murdering Sansa, who Cersei believes killed Joffrey, aided by Tyrion. She then confronts him about visiting Tyrion. Jaime tries to convince Cersei that their brother is innocent, but she refuses to listen and tells him to leave, demanding more protection for Tommen.

   Jaime is ordered by his father to have Tyrion shackled before his trial. It is clear that the trial is a farce, as Tyrion has no one to speak for him, and Cersei has gathered numerous witnesses to provide circumstantial evidence against her brother, all of whom miss out key contextual details. At recess, an angered Jaime goes to Tywin and offers him a deal; he will leave the Kingsguard and take his place as Tywin's heir if Tyrion's life is spared. Tywin immediately agrees, saying that Tyrion will be declared guilty and allowed to join the Night's Watch. Tywin's rapid agreement makes Jaime realize that this was his plan from the start, but he nevertheless agrees. Before the trial resumes, he tells Tyrion of the plan, but can only watch as

Tyrion knew that the deal was everything his father wanted and could not go through with it. Jaime points out that, despite his practice with Bronn, his current skill with a sword would be useless in a trial by combat. 
Tyrion jokes how devastating it would be for Tywin if Jaime were to die in his trial by combat. Jaime then tells Tyrion who Cersei has chosen as their champion: Ser

He insists that Tyrion is her family whether she chooses to accept it or not. She rebukes his claim, saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice, and that she chooses Jaime.

He also warns Jaime on the impulsiveness of the Dornish people, and asks if Jaime set Tyrion free. Jaime claims it was Varys.

Doran insists that for the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne to continue, the engagement of Trystane and Myrcella must stand, and Trystane will simply take his uncle Oberyn's place on the small council.

  <p key="0cfd2602-4afb-4db8-90b1-2bf91cd9fbf0">
   Jaime agrees and allows Brienne to enter Riverrun and try to convince Brynden to surrender. She then removes Oathkeeper and tries to return it to Jaime, since the purpose he lent it to her for (rescuing Sansa) has been fulfilled, but he refuses to take it back, saying that it's hers now. Brienne reminds him that her oath to Sansa will obligate her to fight him if her efforts to find a peaceful solution should fail if he attacks the castle. Jaime responds by saying that he hopes that it does not come to that.

Jaime promises that Edmure's son will be taken care of, that he will be given knights to train, and a keep of his own desire when he comes of age. Edmure ridicules Jaime. Jaime, realising he cannot peacefully try to persuade Edmure into surrendering the castle, responds by warning him that people can do anything for love, threatening that he will kill every Tully in order to be able to return to King's Landing and be with Cersei again. With his family's life credibly threatened, Edmure agrees to cooperate.

Euron ignores the jab, but responds with one of his own by asking Jaime for advice on how Cersei enjoys sex.

Remarking on Joffrey's horrible nature, Olenna proudly admits that she enacted measures to protect her family at all costs, with no regrets, but reflects that her actions pale in comparison to the atrocities performed by Cersei. She tells Jaime that Cersei is a monster; a matter of opinion according to Jaime. While some may dread her, Jaime insists that none will care what she has done, so long as order is restored. Olenna observes that Jaime really does love his sister, and calls him a fool, claiming that she will be the end of him, and that by the time he realizes what a disease Cersei is, it will be far too late for him. Jaime considers this a moot point, of little value discussing with Olenna, although she points out that as an experienced person about to die, she is the perfect person to discuss his life with.

   Olenna again asks Jaime how he plans to kill her. Jaime tells her of Cersei’s idea of having her whipped and beheaded, or flayed alive and hanged, but he talked her out of those ideas. He then produces a small phial and empties its contents into one of the glasses of wine, giving it to Olenna who then drinks it after Jaime confirms that it will be a painless death. Olenna reflects on the horrible way that Joffrey died, and the gruesome details that the poison caused; she admits that part was unintentional on her part, as she had never seen

Shocked into silence, Jaime stares at her, realizing at last who really killed his eldest son and let his brother take the blame, setting in motion the deaths of Oberyn Martell, Tywin Lannister, and Myrcella Baratheon. Satisfied at his horror, Olenna insists that he tell Cersei that she was the one who murdered her son, whereafter a furious Jaime storms out, leaving Olenna to die.

   Upon reaching the Goldroad by the Blackwater river, Jaime and Bronn are surprised to hear what sounds like distant thunder, until they realize it must be approaching cavalry. Jaime and Randyll shout for their soldiers to form up, which they manage to do before the enemy crests over the horizon - a massive, 100,000 strong horde of

  <p key="92c25ec3-9022-4853-befd-236d28235e07">
   The Lannister-Tarly lines around Jaime and Randyll manage to rally under their leadership, however: the Dothraki charge into the Lannister lines head-on, but meet stiff resistance as their spear wall holds firm. Though they are outnumbered, the Lannister soldiers are better armed heavy infantry, highly disciplined and battle-hardened veterans from years of war. Dothraki horse-archers let off shots before charging into their ranks, but highly trained Tarly archers return fire, doing as much if not more damage as the Dothraki wear less armor.

   The Lannister army gives as good as it takes for a time, but their enemy has the advantage of weight in numbers, and the tide turns slowly against them. For a moment it looks like Jaime might at least be able to force the Dothraki to a standstill - but then Daenerys wheels out of the air again, devastating the Lannister formations. No longer trying to punch vertical holes through their lines, she switches to flanking the Lannister ranks, burning a vast horizontal swath of men from left to right. Men are flash-burned into nothing but ash which crumbles upon the touch. Men are cooked alive in their own superheated armor as they struggled to rip it off.

   Nonetheless, Jaime manages to rally his remaining forces a second time, desperately taking command of a group of surviving Lannister and Tarly archers and directing them to concentrate their fire at the dragon: Drogon might not be vulnerable to common arrow fire, but his rider is. If they can manage to kill Daenerys herself, who has risked appearing in open battle, the entire war could end in a day, no matter their losses. Daenerys sees the attack coming, however, and banks Drogon up so the arrow volley harmlessly bounces off the armored scales on his belly.

   Bronn eventually manages to shoot Drogon in the shoulder, but the scorpion is destroyed immediately after by Drogon's dragonfire. To Jaime's disadvantage, the dragon's armored scales are so tough that the scorpion bolt only managed to cause superficial damage. Nonetheless the flesh wound grounds him, and he howls in pain and fury, destroying any masses of enemy soldiers that get near him. Daenerys sets him down and dismounts to try and pull the scorpion bolt out.

   Jaime, however, sees that Daenerys is grounded and immobilized, and realizes he still has one chance; if he can kill Daenerys, even now, he can end her invasion. Jaime grabs a spear and charges his horse across the flaming battlefield to make a death-run for Daenerys as she tends to her dragon. Tyrion, who is watching the battle from a safe distance along with the Dothraki commanders, swears under his breath, calling his brother a "fucking idiot", angry that he's going to get himself killed. Just as Jaime is nearly on top of Daenerys, however, Drogon notices him amidst the chaos of the battle; shielding Daenerys behind his head, the dragon lets out a blast of flame, but Bronn rushes over to tackle Jaime out of the way, saving him from certain death.

As promised, he also tells Cersei it was Olenna who had murdered Joffrey, to her initial disbelief; however, as Jaime talks her through it, pointing out that Olenna had far more to gain from killing Joffrey than Tyrion, Cersei is forced to concede he is telling the truth, and angrily berates Jaime for talking her into giving Olenna a merciful death. Jaime insists that House Lannister will follow House Tyrell into the grave if the war continues, but Cersei, to his dismay, makes it plain she intends to fight on to the bitter end, both of them knowing that Daenerys will do the same, and is more dangerous with the victory she has just achieved. Cersei surmises to say that she would rather fight and die, as she knows she will be killed even if she surrenders.

As the parley continues, proof of the Army of the Dead is shown, and Daenerys tells her story of how she saw them. Jaime asks her of the enemy numbers and he is shocked when she tells him of their overwhelming numerical superiority at around at least 100,000.

Jaime angrily protests that the undead are a threat to every living thing, but Cersei dismisses his concerns, preferring to let Jon and Daenerys exhaust themselves against the Night King, then have her forces deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict, boasting that Euron Greyjoy will soon ferry the Golden Company to Westeros in order to secure the Lannister position. Jaime is beside himself with fury that Cersei and Euron plotted this behind his back, only to be left reeling when Cersei accuses him of plotting with Tyrion to advance the cause of their enemies.

As he turns to leave, Ser Gregor blocks his path, causing Jaime to wonder if Cersei is actually going to have him executed.

   At first glance, outsiders perceive Jaime to be arrogant, cocky, cold, dishonorable, extremely dangerous, disdainful, and sarcastic. To a large extent he is arrogant about his own abilities, but not without cause. Jaime Lannister was arguably one of the greatest swordsmen ever, but the loss of his sword-hand warped his abilities, which did much to humble him. Jaime does not mock others over minor insults the way Cersei does, and he can muster up polite behavior, but he is usually very blunt and straightforward. Much like his brother Tyrion, he typically just says what he is thinking, and has no reservations about mocking those he perceives as incompetent. Despite this, there were men that Jaime admired (like Ser Barristan Selmy, for whom he squired) and, underneath this cold and sarcastic attitude, Jaime is a very complicated man.
  </p>
  <p key="5e37b077-6ebe-4ddc-9e0a-65725fb657c5">
   Tywin Lannister has raised Jaime and Cersei with the principle of ruthlessness as a virtue. Yet even though Jaime Lannister often behaves unapologetically amoral, in his own warped way, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family (Tywin and his three children) aside from Tyrion who shows any hint of honor or principles, whilst Tywin claims to see family as his highest priority but simultaneously is willing to have Tyrion, whom he views as an incalculable disgrace, killed, and Cersei herself ironically sees no immorality whatsoever in anything she does. This is largely based on his arrogance and pride at being a member of the Kingsguard. Jaime became extremely disillusioned with ideals of honor and loyalty when he saw firsthand the atrocities committed by the Mad King, how other "honorable" members of the Kingsguard stood by and did nothing while King Aerys had people burned alive for imagined insults, because they felt bound by vows of faith and fealty - in this sense, Jaime is surprisingly similar to Sandor Clegane, since they both have powerful disillusionments about honor and nobility, yet they both frequently avoid unnecessary violence.
  </p>
  <p key="61b90717-8b2d-42e7-af16-e5b4d1f0ad8e">
   A key difference between Cersei and Jaime is that Cersei honestly believes, in her skewed view of the world, that she is "good", Joffrey is a great king, and all of her enemies are "evil" people trying to destroy her and her children. In contrast, Jaime does not maintain any pretense of being a "good" or honorable man, as he has become apathetic to such concerns - this was influenced by him being hated and loathed by everyone because he killed a man who had infamously terrorized the Seven Kingdoms, opening his eyes to how people perceive goodness and honor. However, he still has some respect for the rules of engagement, as he refused to kill Ned Stark when their duel ended abruptly, since Ned was incapacitated by an opportunistic guard rather than Jaime himself - Jaime personally punished that guard seconds after the duel ended. Jaime also was capable of treating his own enemies rather respectfully, telling Ned Stark that
   <a href="Rickard Stark.html" key="db04d245-6d87-403a-ad07-10d75e702dd0" title="Rickard Stark">

   Jaime was never politically ambitious, much to Cersei's annoyance, and often turns down her frequent urgings that he should try to become Hand of the King, stating that the days are too long and their lives are too short. Political maneuvering is not his way, and he sees himself foremost as a soldier who when confronted with a problem takes out his sword and cuts its head off. Up until the day his hand was cut off, he had immersed himself in combat so much that it is his sole value, and when he does lose his hand, his

   that hand. Brienne of Tarth is quick to tirade to him about him having a small taste of a world where people have their good things ripped from their possession, and after that one small taste he gives up - she mistakes him for a coward at this point. Indeed, Jaime's lack of political thinking leads to him heatedly suggesting that either he or someone else execute the High Sparrow and his followers for manipulating Tommen - at the time, he did not quite see the long term ramifications of such an act because he was angry at the possibility of losing his only surviving child.

   , Jaime begins to redevelop a sense of personal honor once again as he reevaluates his past and future. In no small part to Brienne's influence, Jaime begins to see his father for who he really is and begins to wonder if there are ideals worth fighting for. To this end, he outfits Brienne with new armor and even gifts her the Valyrian steel sword reforged from

   </a>
   . Jaime's new outlook develops to the point where he is disgusted with Cersei for stabbing Daenerys's faction in the back, and announces his intention to keep his own promises (although the undead horror bearing down on the Seven Kingdoms clearly has something to do with it).
  </p>
  <p key="ff2357ef-93bf-40a0-b4bb-a36f3e2bdfbf">
   Jaime is the only member of Tyrion's immediate family who ever treated him with respect or kindness. In fact, he admires Tyrion's intellect and his ability to tell off those who insult him. Jaime never approved of Tywin and Cersei's long history of abuse towards Tyrion, and has always treated him like a brother, the only adult of Tyrion's immediate family to recognize how irrational it was to blame him for their mother's death in childbirth. Indeed, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family who has a reasonably good relationship with all of the others. Among the three siblings, Cersei and Tyrion can't stand each other, but they both like Jaime (both Cersei and Tyrion have acknowledged the only reason they haven't gone out of their way to seriously harm or kill each other is because Jaime would never forgive them if they did). However, in recent times, Jaime's good relationship with Tyrion was tarnished with the death of their father, and Jaime said he would kill Tyrion the next time they meet (though it is unclear if he really meant it). His relationship with Cersei has also deteriorated in the aftermath of Tywin's death since it was Jaime who set Tyrion free and inadvertently allowed him to kill their father.
   Over time, however, and especially after learning that it was Olenna who killed Joffrey, Jaime comes to accept that Tyrion effectively murdered Tywin out of self-defense, a man bound and determined to execute his son; when they meet again in King's Landing, Jaime is initially hostile towards Tyrion, but deep down understands his motives and listens to him, and by the time of the parley in the Dragonpit, Jaime treats Tyrion with the same respect as before, indicating that he has at least partially forgiven his brother.  Over time it becomes clear that Jaime has fully forgiven his brother and shows him the same amount of love and respect as before. This can be seen in the brother's final goodbye where Tyrion tells his brother how much he has meant to him, bringing Jaime to tears as he embraces his little brother one last time.
  </p>
  <p key="70d4177a-d3f8-4cf1-8610-5b9c92118161">
   Tywin was a stern man feared and resented by all of his children, ignoring Cersei for her gender and scorning Tyrion for both his stature and 'killing' his wife in childbirth. However, Jaime is on reasonably good terms with Tywin - not so much that he is "proud" of Jaime so much as he has the "least shame" for him compared to his brother and sister. Even so, Tywin is upset that Jaime willingly joined the Kingsguard, as while it is considered the highest honor for a knight, its members give up the rights to marry or inherit lands, meaning that Jaime cannot be Tywin's heir. Jaime wasn't in a position to act as a father to his biological children with Cersei, though he is generally supportive of Tommen and Myrcella. However, in sharp contrast with Cersei, Jaime isn't particularly fond of Joffrey, nor will he defend his actions the way Cersei does. He shows obvious joy when Myrcella reveals her knowledge that Jaime is her father and is happy about it, and embraces her, since this is the first time he has ever been able to show his feelings as a father to his children. He is equally saddened when Myrcella dies in his arms moments later. He also becomes enraged when the High Sparrow brainwashes his only son, and he contemplates a plan to bloodily finish the High Sparrow's schemes, even though sound judgment states that this plan wouldn't work.

   Jaime's attitude towards violence is also complex: he threw Bran Stark out a tower window to kill him, but later saved Brienne twice (from being raped, then fed to a bear) from Locke's soldiers. The difference seems to be that after witnessing the depravity of the Mad King,
   <i key="db68bcff-e575-4f9f-adc0-733b0d5bfd01">
    needless
   </i>
   violence and brutality deeply offend Jaime, though if he decides that violence and murder are absolutely necessary he will ruthlessly carry it out himself. He threw Bran out of a window because had the boy reported that he saw the incest between Jaime and his sister, Cersei, the woman he loved, then all of their children would be executed, so he felt he had no choice. However, he was dreadfully sorry for crippling the boy and was amazed to learn that Bran was not angry at him. Jaime killed his defenseless cousin Alton Lannister in order to orchestrate an escape from Robb Stark's camp, but he deeply regretted it afterwards, subtly hinting at it to Tyrion and then outright confessing to the High Sparrow about it, showing that he has a greater conscience than he is given credit for. This sets him apart from Cersei, who destroyed the Sept of Baelor and everyone inside (including their uncle and cousin) and around it, and proved unapologetic about what she had done. Jaime also was capable of reproach for the mistakes he made and their consequences, unlike Cersei: he felt guilt for freeing Tyrion because it led to the death of his father, whereas Cersei is blind to her own mistakes, which led to the deaths of her children. The upshot of this is that Jaime has no delusions about his own conscience. He is certainly ruthless when he needs to be, but unlike Cersei or Joffrey he does not act with cruelty for his own enjoyment. Quite the opposite, in fact: the very murder of Aerys that gained Jaime his negative reputation was actually an act of prevention against a potential genocide that would have engulfed all of King's Landing.

Jaime has partly learned from his mistakes: remembering how Robb tricked him by leaving a small decoy force to be overwhelmed while the rest of the army moved to attack more important targets, Jaime allowed the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock (after having emptied its larders) while taking most of the Lannisters' forces south to storm Highgarden; he failed, however, to learn from the same battle the importance of precautions, and that led to his defeat at the Battle of the Goldroad. Regardless, Jaime quickly recognized that the only way he could turn the tide was by killing the enemy commander, even risking his own life for the sake of a chance to kill Daenerys; this demonstrates him to be a man of courage as well as military skill.

   One defining trait of Jaime is his lack of fear of death; he once told Catelyn "the dark is coming for all of us" ("
