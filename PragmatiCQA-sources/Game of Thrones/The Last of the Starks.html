   However, despite any lingering resentment, the mood is lightened and the hall becomes more celebratory, as everyone starts drinking heavily and boasting about their deeds in the battle. Tyrion talks to Davos, who tells him about

Meanwhile, a drunken Tormund laughs and drinks, praising Jon and going over their history: he made friends with an enemy (Tormund himself), got himself killed for it but didn't stay dead (which everyone seems to laugh off as just drunken boasting), and that he keeps fighting. Daenerys watches this exchange despondently and when Tormund declares, "He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A madman or a king!" Jon turns around to look at Daenerys, who gives him a smile and raises her glass. However, after Jon returns her smile and turns back to the conversation, Daenerys becomes more and more downcast as she looks around the hall at the groups of people - first to Tyrion, Brienne, Pod, and Jaime playing their drinking game and then to Jon, Tormund, Davos, who are joined by some wildlings.

   Tyrion, Jaime, Brienne, and Pod continue their drinking game. Brienne correctly guesses that Tyrion was married to

Brienne and Jaime exchange smiles and Tyrion, now very drunk, tells Brienne, "You're a virgin." Brienne's smile fades and Pod takes a drink. Tyrion drunkenly guesses that Brienne has never slept with anyone. Brienne doesn't answer, gets up, and says she must relieve herself.

   Gendry finds Arya
   practicing archery alone in the stables. He happily announces to her that he is no longer a bastard, but has been officially made "Gendry Baratheon" and the new lord of Storm's End by Daenerys. She is very happy for him, but then he says that he doesn't know how to be a lord, and it won't mean anything to him if she isn't by his side: he then gets down on one knee and begs her to

Jon replies that he told her he doesn't want the throne but Daenerys argues it doesn't matter what Jon wants - he didn't want to be King in the North either but people will press his claim and take what is hers. Jon gets down on one knee in front of Daenerys and insists, "I'll refuse! You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say." Daenerys tells him he can say nothing, never tell anyone who he really is. She holds his hand as she says she wants it to be the way it was between them. Jon clasps her hand in his and says he must tell Sansa and Arya (as Bran and Samwell already know) because they are still his family. Daenerys is certain Sansa will press Jon's claim over hers. Jon says Sansa won't do that but Daenerys warns him that Sansa isn't the same girl he grew up with. Jon believes he owes Sansa and Arya the truth but Daenerys begs for him not to tell them, saying the truth will destroy

   Sansa counters that they are not in a strong position to immediately mount a new full-scale offensive, "The men we have left are exhausted. Many of them are wounded. They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate." When Daenerys asks how much time, Sansa says she needs to talk to the officers first. Daenerys tells her, "I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone," but Sansa pointedly reminds Daenerys that this is the same for both the "Northern" armies and for Daenerys's Unsullied. Daenerys tells Sansa that the longer she waits, the more time Cersei has to gather new strength and new allies, just as she recruited Euron and the Golden Company. Jon interjects that the North will honor its allegiance to Queen Daenerys, whom he has bent the knee to, and they will just have to leave the badly wounded back home and march south with a smaller army. At this, Sansa and Arya exchange a look. It is decided that Jon and Davos will lead all of the surviving Northmen/Vale forces and the bulk of the surviving Dothraki/Unsullied forces south down the

They wonder what would happen if the truth came out: Varys acknowledges that the North would obviously switch support to Jon as the rightful heir, and Sansa would make sure that the Vale would as well - instantly losing Daenerys two of the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion asks why they don't just pursue the easy solution: a marriage-alliance. Varys rebukes that Daenerys is Jon's aunt: Tyrion counters by pointing out that

   scorpion
   launcher that previously wounded Drogon. These new weapons are more numerous and much more powerful, punching deep through Rhaegal's iron-hard scales. The first bolt in his chest is soon followed by a second to his wing. The injured dragon's blood-curdling roar of agony is silenced when a third bolt impales him through the throat. Overwhelmed by shock and blood loss, Rhaegal plunges into the sea, where he sinks beneath the surface of the water and drowns. Distraught and enraged, Daenerys tries to make an attack run with Drogon on Euron's ship, but all of the scorpions start raining bolts at her, and she barely manages to turn away and escape with her life.

   Euron's ships then target their ballistae at Daenerys's fleet, smashing them to splinters. Grey Worm urges Missandei to flee to safety by taking the skiff to shore, but they are soon overwhelmed and separated in the chaos. Tyrion barely manages to dodge ballista bolts on the ship's deck as it is blown to pieces, and only manages to survive by jumping overboard, where he is hit in the head and passes out. Some time later, the survivors of the destroyed fleet drag their way onto the nearby shore of Dragonstone, including Tyrion and Varys. Grey Worm stands ashore, only to realize in horror that Missandei isn't with them.

She knows that Daenerys doesn't want to be seen as a tyrant, and the risk of heavy civilian casualties will deter her from making a direct assault. Cersei feels that the Northern and Targaryen armies are so exhausted after fighting the White Walkers that she can regain the upper hand, gaining strength by the day with new allies such as the

He pleads that trying to remove Cersei's tyranny like this would itself be an act of tyranny, and turn the people of Westeros against her. Daenerys says she knows her purpose in this world, to remove tyrants, and she will tear out Cersei root and stem. Tyrion agrees with Varys, and insists that they must offer Cersei the option to flee Westeros with her life (ignorant that

   once offered Cersei the same option, but she is convinced that "either you win or you die" with no middle ground). Daenerys, barely restraining her tears and her rage, nonetheless relents:

   because she thinks Cersei will ever surrender, but because she would look bad if she didn't at least go through the motions of offering it to her - and that way, she feels, everyone will know that Cersei is the one to blame when Daenerys brings the sky crashing down on King's Landing.

   would make a better monarch: he's more temperate, appealing, and also a man - which to many lords in Westeros makes him an inherently better candidate (even ignoring that by simple birth order he outranks Daenerys). Tyrion weakly tries to argue that Daenerys has to be strong, and instill fear in her enemies. Varys says that he will always act in the interest of the people as a whole, and thousands of innocents will die if Daenerys tries to attack Cersei now. Tyrion pointedly asks if he thinks Daenerys will accede if Jon says he wants to sit the Iron Throne instead of her - but Varys silently shoots him a look, obviously implying that he means they should assassinate Daenerys if she chooses to attack King's Landing.

    Miguel Sapochnik
    to direct episodes 3, 4, and 5 of Season 8 - as they see them as one storyarc (comparable to how Season 6's "

    David Nutter
    was reshuffled to direct this episode as well (after directing episodes 8.1 and 8.2).

Though originally thought to be from Starbucks, art director Hauke Richter confirmed the coffee cup was from a local shop in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, where the scene was filmed. The cup has since been digitally removed from HBO Now - but has yet to be removed from several international streaming services.

    It goes unsaid in the episode that as Robert's son, Gendry actually has some Targaryen blood in him. In the books, Robert's grandmother was a younger Targaryen princess, making him the second cousin of Rhaegar and Daenerys - thus Gendry is Daenerys's second cousin once removed, and Jon Snow's third cousin. The TV continuity might have moved this around a little to make it Robert's mother instead of his grandmother (statements on this have been vague).

      male carrying Targaryen blood, such as Gendry, would rank ahead of Daenerys - though Gendry would still rank behind Jon Snow, who is the lawful son of the main branch of the family. Within this same episode, Varys later points out that many lords of Westeros will consider Jon Snow a better candidate simply because he is a male, regardless of his technical rank compared to Daenerys. Of course, an officially weaker claim to the Iron Throne didn't stop Robert from taking it in the first place. There are multiple factors to consider with Gendry's claim relative to that of Daenerys - he is a legitimized bastard, often placed behind younger legitimate children in lines of succession, and he descends from House Targaryen matrilineally (througha female branch); it is possible that female candidates

      In the books, Robert has at least three surviving bastard children: Gendry, Mya Stone (a mountain guide at the Eyrie), and Edric Storm (and maybe a prostitute named Bella, who claims she is Robert's daughter), neither of which exist in the TV series. Gendry's storyline was somewhat condensed with Edric in Season 3 - meeting Stannis for the blood ritual, then being sent away by Davos. In the books, Edric is sent away to safety in the Free Cities. It is unknown if Gendry will be legitimized as Robert's heir at some point in future books, or if perhaps this might be condensed from what might happen to Edric.

      's uncle Victarion (omitted from the TV show) misconstrued that she was offering to marry him as a political alliance, which he considered shocking but not impossible. The Targaryens, of course, could marry their aunts. If Jon accepted a marital union with Daenerys, it could help preserve the peace of the realm. If he refuses on the basis of incest, it could risk a succession war.

    Tyrion says that eight people know the secret about Jon: Bran, Samwell, Jon, Daenerys, Arya, Sansa, Tyrion, and Varys. Technically, Gilly also knows the secret about Jon, as she was the one who discovered the diary entry about Rhaegar's marriage to Lyanna Stark, but it's unclear if Sam ever fully explained to Gilly just how important this information was. It is also likely that Tyrion does not know that Gilly potentially knows, or that he does not deem it important as she does not hold a prominent political position.

After Stannis's defeat at the Battle of Blackwater, the garrison continues to hold Storm's End in Stannis's name. In the fourth novel, Storm's End is besieged by a Tyrell force led by Mace and Lord Mathis Rowan. However, Mace soon abandons the siege to return to King's Landing after the arrest of Margaery by the Faith, leaving a token force with Lord Rowan to continue the siege, but the castle continues to support Stannis's claim to the throne.

      In the TV show, Storm's End was never depicted on-screen for budgetary reasons in Season 2. Stannis was assumed to hold the castle after Renly's death, given that the armies of the Stormlands fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater. After the Blackwater, it appears that Joffrey got control of the castle, as Lannister map markers are shown in the Stormlands in Season 3. With Joffrey's death, the castle would have been inherited by Tommen. After Tommen died, however, it wasn't clear what happened to the title - i.e. if Cersei just claimed it with no right to do so (as she did the Iron Throne) or gave the title to some subordinate.

Arianne Martell was simply omitted. The Dorne storyline was quickly abandoned in Season 6 and only given minimal attention afterwards.

    Euron has taken a great risk by using the same tactics for the second time; moreover, this time it was under tougher conditions - in broad daylight and in presence of the dragons.

    Dragon-scales are as tough as iron, and it shouldn't be possible to penetrate them with scorpions and ballistae. Historically, this has only worked when shooting a dragon through the eye, piercing its brain. On the other hand, in the Inside the Episode video, Benioff stresses that

    With the death of Rhaegal, it is unclear if this means that the race of dragons is doomed for extinction once again, as Drogon no longer has any potential mates with which to breed with. The process of reproduction for dragons is shrouded with mystery in the novels: Although it is established that dragons are born from eggs, the process itself by which dragons breed is unknown. Some, like Maester Aemon, believe that dragons have no fixed gender, but simply fluctuate between male and female. It is unknown if this means that dragons require pairs to breed, or are asexual and can breed individually. There is some slim chance that off-screen, Drogon turned into a female and mated with Rhaegal, to lay eggs later - but increasingly it appears that Drogon may be the last of its kind.

    that Cersei isn't visibly pregnant by this point, thus insinuating either that Cersei lied to Jamie about being pregnant with his child in order to manipulate him, or lost the child to a miscarriage. The timeline of events the show runners have presented is that Jaime impregnated Cersei before he left King's Landing to attack Highgarden. A generous estimate of travel times from book-Westeros would mean that Cersei has to be at least three or four months pregnant during the Season 8 premiere episode. Furthermore, when factoring in the additional time that Daenerys spent traveling down from Winterfell to Dragonstone, several weeks to a month, Cersei would have to be at least five to six months pregnant by this point, making it physically

An example of this can be seen with Gilly, who, according to Sam, was impregnated while they were in Oldtown. This occurs relatively around the same time during which Cersei was supposedly impregnated as well. However, while Cersei has not visibly changed physically at all, Gilly was noted by fans to be visibly pregnant in the

    Tyrion saying the last 20 years of warfare, murder, and misery were all because Robert loved a woman that didn't love him back is a vast oversimplification. While Rhaegar's "abduction" of Lyanna might have been a major factor in the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion, it was really Aerys's brutal and unjust executions of Rickard and Brandon Stark, along with calling for the heads of Eddard and Robert that started the war.

    she already betrayed them. Moreover, appealing to her unborn child's safety is specifically what Tyrion thought won her over to join them in the fight against the White Walkers, so this clearly didn't work before. Of all people, Tyrion should know better. He knows well how treacherous, untrustworthy and selfish Cersei is, how she acts and thinks, and that she lacks any common sense. What reason did he have to believe she has suddenly changed, pregnant or not?

      It is very unlikely that Tyrion's book counterpart would act so foolishly. In the fifth novel, he declares that "Cersei is as gentle as King Maegor, as selfless as Aegon the Unworthy, as wise as Mad Aerys. She never forgets a slight, real or imagined. She takes caution for cowardice and dissent for defiance. And she is greedy. Greedy for power, for honor, for love" - an extremely accurate description of Cersei.

      of him as the perfect son, while enabling his psychopathy. Meanwhile, she basically ignored her younger two children - ironically, playing favorites with her children just as her father Tywin did by ignoring her for Jaime. She does have some moments of expressing concern for them - worried that Tommen might have been poisoned, upset at Myrcella's departure to Dorne, etc. - but these usually came down to her being upset that people were harming something that

    , Alex Abad-Santos wrote an article saying that trying to depict Daenerys as a "Mad Queen" at this point didn't make much sense in the context of the last seven seasons, and that even if the TV writers did intend to present her as becoming an insane tyrant in Season 8, they failed, because as presented her actions were still all rational and the fears of those around her seemed groundless:

      They seem to intend to portray that Daenerys feels isolated that the Northern lords care more about Jon Snow than about her. Nonetheless, even though Jon halts their love-making, he still openly opposes his own sisters by supporting Daenerys as rightful monarch over all of the Seven Kingdoms

      , which successfully overthrew Daenerys's own family and put Robert Baratheon on the Iron Throne. Daenerys isn't suggesting to do anything that Tywin didn't -

      While angered, Daenerys even grudgingly agrees to make a final peace offering to Cersei - which she correctly anticipates Cersei will reject, but relented to purely because she wants the world to know that she went through the token gesture, and it's Cersei's fault for rejecting it.

      Daenerys has no ulterior motives with the Starks, but the episode plays it up as if the Stark sisters are correctly second-guessing her, and that Daenerys is paranoid that they don't support her. Daenerys isn't "baselessly paranoid" if the Stark sisters actually want to undermine her. In the Inside the Episode, David Benioff even spells out that Sansa told Tyrion about Jon because she correctly anticipated he would tell Varys, and Varys would use this information against Daenerys.

     <li key="3489e3ba-29f8-4832-a2b0-180bbe74bdc3">
      Moreover, the TV writers don't coherently explain why the Stark sisters would be suspicious of Daenerys, as if she had some hidden ulterior motive: she
      <i key="0b6b88f2-beee-4ba5-ba9c-ca85a05d9c70">

      </i>
      that she wants to be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, including rule over the North. There is no hidden plot waiting to be revealed. The only verbalization of their motives that Sansa and Arya have given, in the godswood scene, is that Daenerys "isn't one of us".
     </li>
     <li key="9013fac7-a584-408e-98af-06c55a7da984">
      Thus the TV writers seem to be trying to play up that Daenerys is isolated and paranoid even though she isn't, her suspicions are grounded, and while she is angered her reactions are still rational. Even so, they present that this somehow makes her so unstable that
      <a href="Varys.html" key="b2e32301-8995-44b5-9eaa-9ab0674c017d" title="Varys">
       Varys
      </a>
      would try to assassinate her. For that matter, Tyrion's insistence that they must parley with Cersei itself failed, and no amount of mercy would have saved Missandei.

      Another interpretation is that the writers are showing that madness takes many forms, which is true in both the real world and in-universe (particularly among Targaryens who exhibited many forms of madness). Things like isolation and the deaths of her friends may be contributing factors, but not the main reasons for her actions. The showrunners have mentioned multiple times that there is a ruthlessness and cruelty that exists even in the good Targaryens. They could be trying to show that when these traits are allowed an almost free reign, they become dangerous because no one can tell the king/queen no. Even though some of her actions may be justifiable, that does not make them right. In real life history, there have been rulers who have taken actions that may be justifiable, however, they were needlessly cruel. For example, kings like Richard I (the Lionheart) and Charlemagne are widley acknowledged as kings who embody chivalrous virtues. However, both committed mass slaughter against their enemies, in Richard's case Islamic soldiers who had surrendered and in Charlemagne's case, he massacred Saxons who had rebelled against him and killed several of his advisors. So the show's depictions of Daenerys and her madness are not that unbelievable. It is also important to note because both the showrunners and Martin have made it clear that Targaryen madness often doesn't fully manifest until later in life. In the case of Daenerys's father, it was the slight faults of his youth that eventually morphed into his insanity, which seems to be the case with Daenerys herself.
