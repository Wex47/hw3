   Ironrath was constructed approximately 1,500 years ago by
   Cedric Forrester
   and his triplet sons. Cedric and his sons raised their fortress, an imposing stronghold surrounded by towering
   ironwood
   trees, on the edge of the largest ironwood forest in Westeros, placing the Forresters in a position of great strategic advantage. Ironrath is a testament to the strength and endurance of Ironwood. More than one visitor has called Ironrath the most striking keep in the North; even

   Elaena Glenmore
   visits Ironrath on the matters of her betrothal to Rodrik. After their discussion, Lord Whitehill barges into the great hall. He reveals that
   Lady Forrester
   had asked about letting
   Ryon Forrester
   attend his brother and father's funeral. He gives Rodrik the option of letting Ryon if Rodrik kisses his ring, which the player can decide to do. Before he leaves, he states that he will take the rest of the ironwood forests.

   The garrison bangs their shields and burns a cart to announce
   Gryff Whitehill
   's arrival to Ironrath. He claims he is in charge, and forces his men to take quarter in the great hall. Duncan also arrives from a visit to the Wall during the encounter. At the small council meeting in the grove, Rodrik can chose to either expel Gryff from Ironrath or save Ryon.

   Rodrik walks into the great hall, finding in shambles. The family portrait is on the floor, and Whitehill banners hang from the walls. Later, Talia finds a Whitehill soldier stealing from the kitchens, and she bites him after he lays his hands on her. They later converse in one of the wooden towers of Ironrath.

   Elaena and her brother
   Arthur Glenmore
   visit Ironrath in the grove, along with the elite guard of
   House Glenmore
   to help Rodrik with Gryff after Lord Whitehill threatened the Glenmores with destruction along with the Forresters if
   Lord Glenmore
   didn't accept a marriage between Gryff and Elaena.
  </p>
  <p key="be7e0874-651c-4acd-b590-2b5af66e08d0">
   Rodrik and the elite guard capture Gryff and his men in the great hall beating Maester Ortengryn with the help of the guard. They march the garrison to the cellars. After this is done, Lady Forrester has the ravens killed so the traitor of the house can not inform the Whitehills of the imprisonment of the garrison. Lord Whitehill invites the Forresters to
   Highpoint
   , the seat of House Whitehill, unknown of what happened to the garrison. Rodrik, Lady Forrester, Royland or Duncan and optionally the Glenmore guards ride for Highpoint.
  </p>
  <p key="790b5f7d-4b12-4c93-afc0-1cedace87f01">
   After the meeting, those who went return to Ironrath, securing a trade of Gryff for Ryon. If the Glenmore guards are brought, Ironrath is found abandoned. Arthur organizes a search for his sister. If they are not brought, Rodrik finds arrows and drops of blood, indicating a fight, before he hears laughing from the great hall, where Ramsay Snow has arrived and is talking with Talia.

   During Ramsay's visit, he, Rodrik, and Talia walk into the ironwood grove to find Arthur 
Glenmore being flayed. Later, Rodrik wakes up in his chambers, and depending on player choices, Elaena can be lying in his bed as well. Talia comes in and informs Rodrik that the traitor is in the great hall. As Rodrik walks in, the Whitehill banners are gone and Forrester ones now hang in their place. The family portrait remains, with only Asher, Gregor, and Rodrik visible. The traitor is seen stroking the fire, as Rodrik comes in to confront him. Rodrik and the Forresters ride to the coast, leaving Ironrath for the time being to meet Asher and his army.

   If
   Asher
   survived the ambush, he becomes the Lord of Ironrath. Ludd offers to negotiate a surrender if Asher agrees to become his bannerman and marry his daughter Gwyn. Asher accepts these terms, though plans to either ambush or poison Ludd during the negotiation and feast, setting the stage for the White Engagement. This plan leads to the death of either Ludd or Gryff, while the other escapes to warn the army of Asher's treachery.
  </p>
  <p key="89d3a6d1-c023-42a0-9877-c16f28ff7c49">
   If Rodrik survived the ambush, Ludd demands that the Forresters present themselves for execution and immediately begins trying to break down Ironrath's gate with a battering ram. Rodrik takes the pit fighters and sneaks into the Whitehill encampment outside Ironrath that night, killing either Ludd or Gryff and freeing his brother Ryon before quickly returning to his home.
  </p>
  <p key="70d081ee-4486-4c4a-97cf-14fab9b4a4f7">
   The battle then plays out the same way for either lord. The Forresters rally and battle the Whitehills that have already made it into the castle. The Lord duels
   Harys
   , who kills Lady
   Elissa Forrester
   if she didn't die earlier of poisoning, and grievously injures the Lord before being defeated. The Whitehills finally break through the gate and surge in, killing smallfolk and soldiers alike. The Forrester lord is saved from death by his Sentinel and put on a horse to escape the battle. He is seen riding out of Ironrath as it burns, with the Whitehills victorious.
