   themselves do not engage, instead staying in a mounted line far behind the front, content to throw wave after wave of undead pawns at the castle. Jon Snow sees the White Walkers and tries to make a bombing run at them: they might not be the Night King, but any of the hundreds of undead wights each of them has raised will instantly die again if he can kill them. Before Jon can even reach their line, however, a massive cold blast of air forces him back: the White Walkers have magically summoned a huge snowstorm. Both dragons can barely stay in the air, and nearly fly into each other during the whiteout.

As they try to get their bearings, the Night King appears riding Viserion and pursues Daenerys and Drogon.

   The remaining infantry is badly affected. The only infantry still holding up reasonably well by this point are the lockstep legions of the Unsullied, horrifically trained to strip away all fear and robotically follow their battle formations. They hold in their phalanxes, but even these are slowly but steadily being consumed by the scrambling mass of wights. A full retreat into the castle is ordered, and Grey Worm commands the Unsullied to form up a rearguard to protect the withdrawal of their few remaining forces. Samwell Tarly is nearly killed in the retreat, but Dolorous Edd saves him - only to be stabbed from behind and killed. The wights gradually force their way forward in slaughter, even as Unsullied reinforcements step forward to take the place of each that falls.

   The Unsullied are on the verge of being overwhelmed, when the last of the main host gets back through the gates. Desperately, Grey Worm orders that the entrenchments around the castle - which have been filled with flammable pitch - be set on fire. Grey Worm himself is with the last remaining rearguard, who cannot abandon the earthworks if they are not set aflame. Attempts by Arya and the other archers to shoot the pitch with flaming arrows are blown away by severe winds while the snowstorm prevents the dragonriders from seeing their signal to light it. Melisandre appears, laying her hands on the trenchworks and repeats her prayers to the

   , straining with the massive effort. At the last moment, the entire trench ringing Winterfell bursts into flames. Grey Worm and his few remaining men withdraw behind the castle gates, which close. Many wights burn, but then they all robotically halt - instead of mindlessly charging ahead to their destruction. The White Walkers can afford to wait them out.

   Seeing the fight approaching, Arya tells Sansa to flee to the crypts, as she'll only get killed if she remains but Sansa protests she can't abandon her people. Arya gives her sister a dragonglass dagger to defend herself with and when Sansa says she doesn't know how to use it, Arya advises her to "stick them with the pointy end". In the crypts, Sansa meets other women, including

   , he and Varys could still use their great intellects as commanders, to try to see something other people wouldn't. Sansa chides that witty remarks won't make a difference, and the bravest thing they can do now is "look the truth in the face". Tyrion is moved and quips that maybe they should have stayed married - to which Sansa responds, "You were the best of them." Tyrion remarks that is a terrifying thought. Sansa continues a marriage wouldn't work out between them because of his loyalty to Daenerys and Tyrion being divided between herself and Daenerys would be a problem. Missandei defends her queen, saying that without the Dragon Queen, they'd all be dead by now.

   In the godswood, Theon Greyjoy can also hear the approach of the undead army. He starts to apologize to Bran, but Bran politely cuts Theon off, saying that everything he did led him to where he is now: "Home". Theon is moved, but Bran must "leave" now -

   Instead of the hordes of wights rushing through the fiery trenches everywhere, the Night King psychically directs them into a concentrated charge across one spot: many hundreds burn, but eventually their sheer mass extinguishes the flames, breaching the outer defenses. Thousands of them start swarming around the base of Winterfell's great stone walls, then climb over each other in a mass, using their strength to grip into crevices in the stone.

   The Night King makes another run towards the godswood, but Jon and Daenerys predict where he was headed. Jon spots the Night King and pursues him. When the Night King approaches the castle walls directly and is just about to strafe Winterfell, Jon attacks him from atop Rhaegal. Rhaegal clashes with his undead brother and a battle between the two factions ensues in the skies above Winterfell.

   Despite having lost so many men out in the field, the castle's walls are a major force multiplier for the defenders, and they kill many more hundreds of wights as they reach the tops of the battlements. Even so, more keep coming, as the snowstorm reduces the castle to a whiteout amidst the flames. Jaime Lannister is nearly overwhelmed by a dozen wights, but Brienne carves her way to him using her

Recovering, young Lyanna grabs a dragonglass blade and charges the undead giant while letting out a battle cry. The wight-giant casually snatches her up in his hand, however, and holds her up to his one remaining blue eye. The wight-giant clenches his fist, crushing Lyanna's chest in as her bones snap. Yet her hand is still free, and with one last defiant cry, she stabs the dragonglass into the wight-giant's eye: it instantly dies and topples to the ground. Lyanna falls free of his grasp, but dies from her injuries.

Arya, who was knocked out against a stone wall, recovers some time later, stumbling into the Winterfell library. The fighting has moved away from this part of the castle, as wights shamble about looking for survivors to pick off. Using her stealth training from the

Once inside, Beric succumbs to his injuries, but in the hall, Arya and Sandor also find Melisandre, waiting; she remarks that in saving Arya, Beric has fulfilled the purpose the Lord of Light had for him.

   Meanwhile, the dragons are locked in battle in the sky above Winterfell with Jon and the Night King fighting in fierce close quarters mid-air brawl on their dragons. Viserion badly claws Rhaegal's belly, while the Night King readies another one of his dragon-killing
   ice javelins
   - but the dragons are swirling around so chaotically he can't get a clear shot from his mount. Despite his wounds, Rhaegal manages to land a bite on the other dragon, and tears the left half of his face off - but this is not enough to stop him. It is, however, enough to significantly distract the Night King, who doesn't notice Daenerys's approach on Drogon: they collide with Viserion with such impact that the Night King is spilled from his mount, while Drogon tears into Viserion. Rhaegal, however, is badly wounded enough that he needs to make a forced landing, dropping Jon on the ground again before fleeing.

   Drogon sends the badly injured Viserion crashing into the castle while Jon regains himself on the ground, finding he is on the abandoned outer battlefield -- and not far from the Night King, who is proceeding on foot to the breach in the walls leading to the godswood and Bran.

   Daenerys reaches the Night King, and with a command of "Dracarys!" has Drogon blast him with dragonfire. When the smoke dissipates, however, Bran's warning is proven unfortunately correct: even dragonfire cannot kill the Night King, who is completely undamaged. He still has one ice javelin left and as he readies to throw it at Drogon, Daenerys flees and manages to narrowly dodge the shot.

   In the crypts, Sansa and the others can hear a handful of living men desperately pounding on the heavy doors to let them in, but they know they cannot risk a flood of wights passing the barricade. They hear the men's cries which are quickly silenced. The wights themselves cannot find a way in - but there are already plenty of dead bodies in the crypts for the White Walkers to reanimate. Suddenly, many of the interred corpses rise as wights and start clawing their way out of their tombs. They're fairly old and not in the best shape, but the women and children are totally unarmed, and many succumb to the wights. Sansa and Tyrion hide behind one tomb, contemplating on helping the women and children in the fight against the newly made wights in the crypt, with the dragon glass that they were given.

   As Jon fights off the surrounding wights, Daenerys appears with Drogon and burns them up from the air. Jon calls to Daenerys, planning to pursue the Night King, and Daenerys tells Jon to go. After Jon follows the Night King, Daenerys and Drogon land but stay on the ground for moments too long, finding Drogon being swarmed by dozens of wights. He just barely manages to fly away still covered in them, but Daenerys is knocked off his back in the process. However, Jorah appears and helps Daenerys fight off the wights. Daenerys picks up a dragonglass dagger from the ground as well, but they are both exhausted and more wights surround them again.

   Jon, meanwhile, fights his way back into the courtyard of the castle on foot - only to be pinned down by the grounded, but still very dangerous Viserion. A stab from Jon's Valyrian steel sword might kill the undead-dragon, but it is simply too volatile to approach: badly wounded beyond the point a living dragon would have expired, the huge rents in his body leak great bursts of fire, as it continues to crash around through the rubble. Jon is hastily forced to dive for cover, as Viserion catches sight of him and lets loose a torrent of fire, incinerating the courtyard which barely misses Jon. Facing certain death and with the battle seemingly lost, Jon emerges from his hiding place and, resolving to die with what courage he can muster, bellows defiance at Viserion as the undead dragon's jaws gape open, either to devour Jon or blast him with flame.

He only has a moment to leer at her before she drops the dagger out of her left hand and catches it with her still free right hand - and drives the blade into the center of his chest. The Valyrian steel makes contact with the ancient dragonglass shard empowering the Night King, and kills him - shattering him into icy shards.

Melisandre, however, removes her magical choker and drops it on the ground, the glow from its gem fading out - and Davos is astonished to see from a distance that she is now a centuries-old woman (her glamored image of youth removed). Having used up all of her magical power summoning the fires to defend the castle, she takes a few more faltering steps, then collapses, and her body crumbles away into dust.

    that sound like cracking ice, but in terms of "dialogue" leading to characterization, they never said anything. Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss said that they did this on purpose, feeling that the Night King is basically "Death" incarnate, and Death shouldn't talk (it would only diminish him).

      confirmed last season that this was officially a deliberate change from the novels (apparently in order to have engaged action sequences with wights - it would be impractical for all the actors to be fighting them with flaming swords).

      , wights are very vulnerable to fire. In the books, it is explicitly demonstrated that they are unnaturally more flammable than a normal corpse, as if their very flesh was made out of pitch. As Sam finds out by trial-and-error (immediately after discovering that dragonglass is useless against wights), even a single spark is enough to set an entire wight ablaze and destroy it very quickly. While wights are seen being killed by fire in this episode, it isn't as effective as it was in the past: if anything, a tightly bunched mass of wights should be easy to set on fire, as the flames spread from one to the next. It's also unclear if wights could breach a flaming trench as they do in this episode, by just sending so many forward that they somehow smother the flames: it would only add

    's death doesn't make much sense:  it has been established that the TV show changed the rules about wights, to make them vulnerable to dragonglass when they are not in the books.  Generally, what was seen up to now is that dragonglass is a

Given that it is an undead wight, however, she could have simply slashed it

The production team even went to the trouble of building wooden logs covered in dragonglass shards, left hanging over the walls ready to drop on the wights, but which don't actually get used in the battle itself.  The tops of the battlements themselves are covered in dragonglass shards and a few wights do get killed by being shoved into them.

When Ramsay killed Rickon, Jon charges the Bolton forces alone - at which point the Stark formations devolved into a melee, and ultimately had to be saved by an external force (the Vale army). In this battle, it is Daenerys who rushes ahead and breaks formation because she is upset upon seeing the Dothraki being killed, ruining their entire, pre-stated battle plan - and ultimately they have to be saved by an external force (in this case, Arya sneaking up to kill the Night King).

    The production team made frequent remarks leading up to this episode's premiere that they wanted the "battle" for Winterfell to really be a "survival horror" (even though a field battle isn't like that). As this played out, halfway through the episode, after Winterfell is largely overrun the fighting shifts genres into characters sneaking around the interiors of Winterfell trying to run from the wights.

    Throughout the battle, multiple characters near-miraculously survive being gang-piled by nearly a dozen wights, hugging onto them, only to then fight them off with no major injuries.  This happens regardless of how much armor they are wearing.  When other characters have to die due to the plot, however, they are shown being stabbed

The implication is essentially that she vaunted a full 20 feet into the air over the ring of White Walkers to reach the Night King. Consider how much time and effort it took by a full stunt team to set up that platform, and assemble all the wirework - but none of them has (as of yet) put forward a plausible explanation of where Arya jumped from to attack the Night King.

While this may have been the plan at the time, the episode itself does not show any pile of wights near the Night King that would enable Arya to jump at him the way that she did. It remains unknown if the wight pile was consciously left out or if it was just forgotten about with all productions efforts aimed at the actual leap instead of the circumstances that would make it possible in the first place.

      First, the shift to digital cameras (which happened between the filming of the unaired pilot and

      ) actually makes it easier to film in low lighting, so there has been a widespread shift among prestige drama to show off that they can do this.

      Second, the shift from older cathode ray TVs to High Definition digital TVs: ironically, it is actually

      to see a high definition, digitally filmed night scene on a newer HD TV than on an older cathode ray one.  However, few industry insiders seem to realize this, only judging by the optimized screens they have in their production departments, not what consumers might be seeing at home.  So there is a push to show off that they can

      Third, the massive shift to streaming service platforms in the past few years.  Streaming services use a compression/decompression cycle for information, to use as little bandwidth as possible.  But every time a video file goes through this "lossy compression", the image quality gets worse - and the effect is particularly drastic when it comes to low-light images.

      , with only natural light (nearly none), to show off that they could - and many viewers are watching it on High Definition TVs, using streaming services such as HBO Now -

      is a particularly egregious example.  They recommended that production teams should test video on off-the-shelf displays and run it through streaming compression, to check what it will actually look like for consumers.  Their only other suggestion is that the light levels coming off a Blu-ray disc will be a lot better than over streaming services, and you may need to simply adjust the brightness levels on your display.
