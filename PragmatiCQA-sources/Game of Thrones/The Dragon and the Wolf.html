   coming from the North for them all; according to Tyrion, one million people all live crammed together in the city. They will soon become one million more soldiers in the army of the dead. Cersei callously responds that it will likely be an improvement for most of them, her flippancy noticeably angering the normally stoic Jon. Cersei refuses to believe the claims, dismissing them as a ploy to trick her into lowering her defenses. To prove their claims, Sandor returns with the crate containing the wight, which is uncharacteristically silent. Sandor gets the crate open and is visibly frightened by what he sees inside it, which worries Jaime since he knows the Hound is not afraid of anything. Cersei watches the proceedings with a dismissively smug smirk. Sandor finally gives the crate a massive kick and knocks it over; the enraged wight promptly clambers out and charges toward the nearest target - Cersei, appropriately enough. Completely stunned at the sight of the undead creature throwing itself towards them, the Lannister queen and her allies recoil in horror as Sandor pulls the screeching monster back on a chain, its claws inches from Cersei's face, and manages to slice the creature in half when it turns to attack him. The Stark and Targaryen delegations watch it emotionlessly but the Lannisters look on in shock as the wight's upper half continues to move, shrieking and snarling, trying to crawl towards Sandor, who slices off one of its outstretched hands. After a clearly fascinated Qyburn briefly examines it, Jon steps forward and takes the wight's severed hand, using a torch provided by Davos to demonstrate how fire can be used to stop them. He then uses a

   numbers at least 100,000. Euron asks if the wights can swim. When Jon responds, "No," Euron announces to Cersei his intention to withdraw his fleet back to the Iron Isles. He declares that he has been over the whole world and has never been terrified until now. On his way out, he tells Daenerys to retreat to her own

   's death, will be made worthless. Jon responds that while scrupulous honesty may or may not have contributed to getting his father killed, if no one is willing to speak the truth, then everyone's word is worthless, and lies will not help them win the coming fight. Tyrion reluctantly decides that he will go and try to talk some reason into Cersei alone. Daenerys and Jon protest, fearing Cersei may have him killed out of spite, but Tyrion insists it's the only way if they don't want everything they've done to be for nothing and bids them wait.

Tyrion loses patience, retorting that he didn't know Jon had sworn allegiance to Daenerys and that without his intervention, Daenerys would have razed the Red Keep to the ground with everyone inside it. When Cersei questions why Tyrion stopped her, he replies that he believes she will make the world a better place, and that he serves Daenerys to curb her excesses, unlike Cersei, who freely indulges her worst impulses. She retorts that her only interest is protecting those she cares about, musing if Euron didn't have the right idea to flee somewhere safe with those who matter, at which Tyrion realizes that Cersei is pregnant.

Tormund and Beric watch in horror as the entire eastern extremity of the Wall collapses under Viserion's breath and crashes into the sea, leaving a gap between the Wall and the sea large enough for the army of the dead to cross. A road now open to them, the White Walkers direct the wights to begin their march into the North. Wights and giants and other monstrosities march by the thousands into the North as the undead Viserion and Night King fly overhead to lead the march.

    The
    Dragonpit
    appears for the first time in this episode. Although explicitly stated to once have been the home of the Targaryen dragons, the structure is clearly too small to hold full-size dragons, in chambers that ringed the inside of the arena. In the books, it is enormous, easily large enough to have held forty dragons (although there were never more than 20 alive at any time during the reign of the Targaryens). This is the result of impracticalities in filming: the crew had the opportunity to film in an actual Roman amphitheater for the scene, and went with the realism of a real ruin rather than try and CG something that would have been the right size, but might have looked fake. Notice that Drogon - who isn't even as large as some of the centuries-old dragons like
    Balerion
    - can barely fit inside the arena with his wings fully extended. Nor can he possibly fit in any of the entrances - in the books, the main entrance is big enough for thirty knights to ride through abreast on their horses.

Quentyn Martell, as he is about to steal Daenerys's dragons, recalls reading about the fact that none of the dragons bred and raised in the Dragonpit of King’s Landing had ever approached the size of Vhagar or Meraxes, much less that of Balerion; the reason given in the books he read is that the pit has slowed their growth. The far more pragmatic answer is probably that, much like their Targaryen masters, generations of heavy

    As the showrunners point out in the Inside the Episode video, the parley at the Dragonpit is the first time that most of the starring cast members have interacted with each other in the same scene after seven TV seasons: so many major characters appear in it, and they had to plan out reaction shots for each of them (instead of just having some them stand in the background), that it took 10 full days to film the entire sequence. The entire sequence has 17 named recurring characters in it: Cersei, Jaime, Gregor, Qyburn, Euron, Jon Snow, Tyrion, Daenerys, Varys, Davos, Theon, Jorah, Missandei, Sandor, Brienne, as well as (briefly) Bronn and Podrick.

      Starting in at least Season 5, the TV series defined the core of its starring cast by pay grade as specifically five actors, called "Tier A": Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and the three Lannister siblings (Tyrion, Cersei, Jaime). The younger Stark siblings might not have been included because they were under-aged. Nonetheless this generally matches which characters get the most POV chapters in the books (Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, etc.). Thus this scene is the absolute first time in the entire series that all five "Tier A" cast members have been in the same scene together.

Theon and Jon shared a few more scenes in the first episode (the execution, finding the direwolves). Similarly, Tyrion had separate scenes with Jon and later Theon before departing Winterfell. Jon also had a very brief scene with Jaime at Winterfell, which the producers explained in the TV commentary that they put in because they realized these two core characters wouldn't meet again for many seasons.

It's possible that Tyrion was in fact referring to the start of the Mad King's reign, as during the Mad King's reign, the relationship between Aerys and Tywin gradually broke down as Aerys grew increasingly paranoid of Tywin from all the whispers he heard, claiming that Tywin was the true ruler of the Realm. Aerys notably insulted Tywin many times during his reign, often disagreeing with his Hand and doing the opposite of what Tywin suggested, including openly lusting after Tywin's wife,
    Joanna Lannister

    Euron's dialogue asking if the undead wights can swim across water - then being told they can't, and thinking the Iron islands are safe - raises an interesting question applicable to the novels as well. It is repeatedly stated that the White Walkers and their undead armies are a threat to the

    Jaime's final scenes leaving Cersei and King's Landing are loosely transferred from how he left her in the books - which happened much earlier, at the end of the fourth novel. Chronologically, this would have corresponded to the end of Season 5. In the books, the rift between them has begun at their first meeting after Jaime returns to King's Landing; later, Tyrion reveals to Jaime that Cersei has been sleeping with other men. Throughout the first half of the fourth novel, they grow more and more distant from each other, as Jaime is disgusted by Cersei's behavior, and she treats him with contempt. Jaime travels to resolve the
    Second Siege of Riverrun
    (which was pushed back to Season 6), and on the way he meets Lancel, who tearfully confesses about his affair with Cersei and his part in Robert's death; only then Jaime realizes that Tyrion's last words about Cersei's promiscuity were true, and she is responsible for the murders of Robert and the previous High Septon. Since that point, he thinks about her as a treacherous slut, thinks about a way to winkle Tommen from her clutches before he becomes another Joffrey, and even contemplates if Tommen would be safer with Cersei dead. He is also distressed by her erratic behavior which threatens their badly needed alliance with the Tyrells (which only gets worse after he leaves King's Landing). In the meantime, Cersei is arrested by the

    - winter has truly come; after witnessing sadly the devastation that his father's bannermen left in the Riverlands, he becomes worried that there is not enough food for the winter. Next morning, he receives the letter from Cersei, and orders his squire to burn it; he is fully aware that Cersei is guilty of all the crimes she is charged with - high treason, adultery, fornication, incest, regicide and deicide, and has no intention to help her (the fourth novel ends on this cliffhanger image). In the next novel, he continues nonchalantly to Raventree Hall, aware that Cersei may be executed before he returns to King's Landing - and does not seem to care at all.

She is the only one of the three that might vaguely be a result of Tyrion killing Tywin (arguing that the Dornish never would have tried to provoke a war out of fear of their father). Tyrion could also be considered to be partially responsible for Myrcella's death as he's the one who sent her to Dorne in the first place, unintentionally making her an easy target for the Sand Snakes' vengeance after Oberyn's death. In the books, Myrcella is non-fatally wounded by an assassination attempt in Dorne, and Cersei irrationally believes that Tyrion must have been directly responsible, simply as petty revenge against her; she reaches that highly questionable conclusion by associating Tyrion's disfigurement at the battle of the Blackwater with Myrcella's disfigurement (even though this is utterly untrue and makes very little sense even with the information Cersei has available).

      It is unclear why Cersei is willing to admit that perhaps Tyrion did not kill Joffrey; maybe because of Olenna's confession. In the books, Cersei deduces herself that the Tyrells had a motive to dispose of Joffrey, but that realization does not make her remove Tyrion from the lists of suspects: driven by paranoia, Cersei believes that Tyrion and the Tyrells conspired together to kill Joffrey, and maybe the Tyrells were involved in Tywin's murder too.

    Tyrion tells Cersei that he hates himself for killing their father, despite what he did him. In the novels, Tyrion does not feel any remorse or regret for killing Tywin; on the contrary, in the fifth novel he occasionally brags about the murder, and even jokes about it: "Lord Tywin was sitting on a privy, so I put a crossbow bolt through his bowels to see if he really did shit gold. He didn’t. A pity, I could have used some gold".

      On a similar note, upon seeing that Daenerys has only two dragons, Cersei reasons that the dragons are vulnerable, and can be killed. While she's not incorrect, she negelcts to consider that the anti-dragon scorpion built by Qyburn was ultimatley ineffective; and though Cersei would not have known it, Viserion was slain by the Night King, a being of already immense power.

    Despite Cersei claiming to have learned from her father, this episode once more demonstrates how that isn't the case. Tywin might have been ruthless against his enemies but he also understood that sometimes one has to ally with their rivals in the interest of survival. Lady Olenna even said this to Cersei's face, but she flippantly responded that House Lannister had no rival. Here, she is utterly refusing to ally with the Targaryens and the Starks (people whose past with each other would be more than enough reason to undermine an alliance) despite being given irrefutable proof of an even greater threat to all of them because her petty and spiteful nature refuses to allow it.

    Cersei also demonstrates her complete lack of strategical ability beyond killing her enemies by ordering the Mountain to kill Daenerys, Jon, Tyrion and then the others if something goes wrong at the start of the episode. The episode begins with the Unsullied army massed outside King's Landing and the Lannister forces scrambling to prepare for a fight as the Dothraki arrive on their horses to bolster the Unsullied. Though less blooded than the Lannister forces, the Targaryen army took fewer losses in the battles at Casterly Rock and the Goldroad and even with those losses outnumber the Lannisters by a significant margin. The Unsullied and Dothraki, unlike Cersei's army, fight for Daenerys of their own free will and out of genuine loyalty and love for the Dragon Queen. If Daenerys is murdered by Cersei under parley, her forces will descend upon King's Landing and lay waste to the city in revenge; and even if the Lannister forces were to somehow repel them, Drogon and Rhaegal would likely be enraged at the murder of their mother, and would destroy the city.

    Its not clear why the Iron Bank would continue supporting Cersei, considering how they would have likely heard how poorly the Lannister forces faired against the combined forces of the Dothraki and a

   <li key="dfa82e5b-27d9-42cd-ae93-a6cc92ae1db5">
    The meeting between Daenerys and Cersei also highlights the differences between the two as rulers. Daenerys remains polite and reasonable in her speech and bearing towards her opponents, even towards Jaime who killed her father and also tried to kill her only a few episodes ago. In contrast, Cersei is aggressive and flippant towards her rival the moment she arrives and openly derides and insults her as a usurper whose word cannot be trusted.

    Cersei, while falsely promising to assist the North against the army of the dead, states "The darkness is coming for us all" - almost the same words Jaime told Catelyn long ago ("

    </a>
    "): "The dark is coming for all of us." The difference is that Jaime genuinely expressed his lack of fear of death, reasoning that everyone will eventually die; Cersei uses the phrase to feign solidarity, while she actually cares only about herself and the people she loves, and does not care if the rest of the world is destroyed - as she makes it clear to Tyrion in their earlier private conversation.

      Due to the way critics are taught to write and evaluate, critical reviews are usually based on the final aired version of a piece of media, with minimal consideration for behind the scenes information (multiple rewrites, disagreements between writers and directors, etc.) that sometimes result in incongruous scenes. Judging from the showrunners' comments, it appears that the

    concluded in his review of this episode: "As satisfying as it was to watch Littlefinger finally get his comeuppance for trying to set two Stark women against each other, I can’t honestly say it makes up for the past two episodes. I can’t help but think at least some, if not most of Sansa and Arya’s fights were real (they had several scenes where it seems highly unlikely that they were performing for one of Petyr’s spies), and it was only Littlefinger’s clumsy push at the end—or maybe Bran rolling in with the truth, since he was sitting next to Sansa in the room—that made them realized their rift was primarily Baelish’s fault. Even if they were playing him the whole time, surely there was a way for the show to tell this story without both of them turning into weird, awful caricatures of themselves. But still, I’m still so relieved this horrible storyline course-corrected that I don’t mind Littlefinger’s ignoble, ignominious death, or how he basically did nothing but get himself killed in season seven. Thank the gods it happened."

    Likely as a means of highlighting the karmic nature of the scene, the framing of Littlefinger's downfall mirrors Eddard Stark's arrest in Season 1: both walk into a foreign courtroom (Winterfell, the Red Keep) thinking they are about to orchestrate a coup, only for the surprise revelation that they've been double-crossed, and alleged supporters (Sansa and Royce, Littlefinger and the Gold Cloaks) end up turning on them. He then sinks to his knees in the middle of the Winterfell court and pleads for mercy, similar to the shot of Sansa sinking to her knees before the Iron Throne and begging that Joffrey and the Lannister court show mercy to her father Eddard.

Thus, when Littlefinger orders Lord Yohn Royce to escort him back to the Eyrie, it shows how really desperate he is, since old Bronze Yohn never liked him in the first place, accused him of murdering Lysa Arryn after her death and nearly got thrown out the Moon Door thanks to Littlefinger's whisperings to Robin Arryn ("

    ). Sansa does allude to this in her conversation with Arya; the sisters seem to acknowledge, based on another of Ned's stories, that as long as the Starks act as one (a pack), Sansa need not swing the blade so long as Arya is the one wielding it. Alternatively, this might symbolize that Sansa has become more like a southern-style political strategist, but Arya remains very much her father's daughter.

In the novels, King Robert's Small Council actually debated what to do about Daenerys allying with the Dothraki, and one suggestion was to hire a Faceless Man to assassinate her.

        It also carries another possible connotation; Winter has come and the Starks (wolves) and the Targaryens (dragons) have banded together in the face of the undead threat, whilst Cersei has refused to ally with them and is content to stay on her own and leave them to die. The wolf-dragon pact is the pack that will survive, whilst Cersei is the lone wolf who will perish. This is pure speculation, however.

On top of that, the psychological strain of living in a gigantic ruined castle would take its toll: no matter how large the household, it would never fill the castle, and there would always be mysterious noises and the threat of unmaintained buildings collapsing.

      In contrast, Jaime Lannister's generals say that it will take them a fortnight just to gather together a baggage train for their army to head north. Mitigating this is that the Lannister army wasn't expecting to travel north but Daenerys was expecting her Dothraki to go to Winterfell, and the Lannister army is primarily infantry - the Dothraki infamously don't need a baggage train but just carry everything with them on horse to make lightning strikes.

Nonetheless it is the only major port the North has, and the closest thing to an urban center - if modest compared to King's Landing. In the books, Davos made an extended stay in the city to try to rally support for Stannis against the Boltons. The rulers of the city,

      responded to by raising his banners in revolt. Rhaegar should have known that Robert and the Starks would not tolerate such offense but demand justice from his father; he also knew well how his lunatic father would probably react - thus Rhaegar was guilty not only for the deaths of Rickard and Brandon, but also for the following events. On the other hand, Aerys allegedly took such drastic action based on a verbal threat Brandon had made against Rhaegar upon arriving at the Red Keep, a threat that Brandon would probably have been afraid to make if the truth were known; still, it does not exonerate Rhaegar of his responsibility for the loss of so many innocent lives as a result of his deed. The fact that Lyanna was not kidnapped but willingly eloped with Rhaegar makes her responsible, too.

    . The wedding scene of Robb Stark and Talisa in Season 2 (invented for the TV series), also had Faith of the Seven vows conducted by a Septon in front of a heart tree: the producers said the in-universe reason was that Robb was the product of an interfaith household (Catelyn followed the Faith of the Seven), so he just enjoyed mixing the pageantry of both. Talisa's religious views, if any, were never addressed, but since she was quite happy to leave the bigotry of Volantene high society behind, it's reasonable to assume she didn't have a great personal liking for whatever the Maegyr family's religion is.

Aegon I was a conqueror and builder of empire, but Jaehaerys I was a great diplomat, scholar, and law-maker - closer to the kind of man that Rhaegar would admire. Rhaegar was always of a more scholarly bent, and only took up the sword relatively late after he read something in a book (possibly a prophecy). This would also keep Jon's "J" initial.

Alternatively, it's possible that this was meant to shorten the reference in later seasons, to say "Jon was named after the greatest Targaryen king, Jaehaerys", without having to explain that there were actually

Following the prophecy that "the dragon has three heads", it appears that Rhaegar wanted to essentially re-create the original trinity of Targaryens from the Conquest generation: Aegon the Conqueror, and his two sister-wives, Rhaenys and Visenya. Rhaegar's first child was a daughter he named "

      ", and his second child with Elia he named "Aegon". It's possible that Rhaegar hoped his child with Lyanna would be a daughter to finish the set, and he thought he'd name her "Visenya" - so he didn't come up with a male name for Lyanna's baby before he was killed.

      Even if the books give Jon a different name, this scenario is at least internally consistent for the TV continuity (Rhaegar wouldn't give his two living sons the same name, but

Jon asks whether the vision is about Eastwatch; Melisandre is uncertain, since she has seen Eastwatch, and its towers are different than the ones in her vision, but that often the case with visions. She answers Jon "Yes. Eastwatch, my lord"; she cannot tell when it will happen.

      isn't going to be killed and resurrected as a wight-dragon at all. Euron has a magical horn called Dragonbinder; he claims that it can bind and control dragons, but it has not been verified yet. He has given the horn to his brother Victarion, who is currently at the Slaver's Bay, on a mission to bring Daenerys and her dragons to Euron. Even if Victarion can use the horn to control any or all of Daenerys's dragons, he has no reason to deliver them to his hateful brother, on the contrary: he has already decided to take Daenerys and her dragons for himself. Currently, Euron expects the arrival of two enemy fleets (the Redwyne fleet and Lord Hightower's fleet) that greatly outnumber his naval forces, but he is not concerned; perhaps he intends to use sorcery, and for that purpose he has captured Aeron and other holy men and warlocks of various religions, but he has not revealed his plan, whether it involves dragons or not.

      If Viserion is not killed and turned into a wight, that raises the question of how the Wall could be breached in a future novel. There is a legend among the wildlings about the magical Horn of Winter, used by

The TV writers later explained that they copied many details from the books in the first few seasons without realizing what they would build to, until Martin finally revealed his full future outline to them after Season 3 was written - thus it's possible that after that meeting, they revised their own outline of how the TV series would progress, and chose to abandon the warhorn. Ultimately, of course, only the release of the next novel will confirm any of this. By the point the books reached, Sam still has the horn in possession, and it does not seem to have any special properties - yet.

    Several sources such as HBO's Viewer's Guide referred to him as an "ice dragon", though they haven't always been reliable in the past. An "
    Ice dragon
    " is actually a specific mythological creature in their world, allegedly
    <i key="2cc75a31-42db-466d-a9a3-8d92e838cb15">
     made from living ice
    </i>
    and breathing cold blasts instead of fire. Moreover, Viserion clearly died and was apparently resurrected much as zombie-like wights are (such a the wight-horses also seen). After this episode, theories began circulating around news sites that Viserion was actually turned into sort of a dragon version of a White Walker, similar to how the Night King converted

     <li key="47a8c014-c33a-4490-af2e-c47925a654b5">
      The script actually refers to Viserion using the specific phrase "ice dragon". However, it also explicitly describes him as shooting "blue flames", not some sort of ice blast - the way that ice dragons of legend would in the books. Nor is Viserion made of living ice. So what exactly makes Viserion an "ice dragon" is unclear, or if the TV writers just appropriated the term because they thought it sounds exciting.

      The script gives an explicit description of Viserion when he first appears with the Night King on his back:

       "He's done the same thing to Viserion that he did to Craster's sons. Only those were babies, and this is a dragon."

       <li key="96a7b064-bd3e-44eb-bcde-7a53cc6459d9">
        This would seem to imply that the TV showrunners intended Viserion as no mere wight-dragon, but a White Walker version of a dragon. This only introduces further contradictions, however, because the Night King fundamentally
        <i key="9f44dddf-9296-4249-96d1-756422f4578e">
         did not
        </i>
        do the same thing to Craster's sons: they were taken and transformed

         alive
        </i>
        , while Viserion was dead and resurrected. It was strongly implied that the Night King needed living babies to turn into new White Walkers, and thus needed Craster to supply them that way, intead of just slaughtering wildling camps then resurrecting dead children. Viserion, in contrast, was explicitly dead.
