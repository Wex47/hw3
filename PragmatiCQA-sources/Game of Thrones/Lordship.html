This "government" is based on personal oaths of allegiance: while one can speak of "the realm" on a vague level, they do not possess an abstract concept of the "Nation-state" in modern terms.

   The feudal society of the Seven Kingdoms follows inheritance law based on primogeniture, a winner-take-all system in which
   <b key="e906e5b9-4f7e-48bd-b3d6-c88cadfcdd7b">
    the designated heir inherits all of their parents' lands and possessions, to the exclusion of younger siblings

   , in which an elder brother would inherit ahead of a younger brother. Many heirs will still try to provide for their younger siblings, giving them funds to live on or minor holdfasts to rule over in their name. For example,

   The other major rule under primogeniture inheritance law is that
   <b key="8c0d912d-4ac5-4a04-a678-719f341fd05f">
    a lord's children will inherit before the lord's younger siblings
   </b>
   . A lord's younger brother will only inherit once his older brother's bloodline is exhausted, leaving no surviving children or grandchildren. Officially, if a lord dies leaving an infant daughter and an adult younger brother, his infant daughter is first in line of succession. In practice, uncles and aunts often try to claim inheritance ahead of their nephews and nieces, feeling that they are better suited to rule. This is not always without good reason, as a noble House officially led by an infant daughter will be seen as weak and easy to attack by hostile neighbors. There have been many instances where an uncle claimed rule ahead of infant children of their older brother, and indeed had widespread support, and truly had only the best interests of the family's holdings in mind. Of course, there is also much truth to the trope of the wicked greedy uncle trying to cheat the rightful heirs out of the family lands. This sort of situation frequently leads to succession conflicts. Other times an adult daughter or a child son may be deemed unfit to rule, though this would be seen as a stretch by many of their vassals (if the only surviving child is not only an infant but a female, she stands the highest chance of having her succession disputed).

  <p key="e0e48806-3caf-404e-ac5f-c74dcbd40cd4">
   Commonly known as simply "primogeniture", this is the standard inheritance practice throughout almost all of the unified realm of the Seven Kingdoms. In this system,
   <b key="f5bec779-e957-4ccf-a380-23e7a881696c">
    children inherit in birth order, but daughters are counted behind sons.
   </b>
   A lord's daughter would still inherit ahead of his own younger brother, because his bloodline is counted ahead of his brother's bloodline.

  <p key="7c7b0f38-bbf4-4583-8907-afa24ef927ef">
   For example, the birth order in the current generation of

    House Stark

   . The inheritance order, however, is "Robb, Bran, Rickon" followed by "Sansa, Arya". Thus, despite the fact that Sansa is the second-born Stark child, she actually follows her little brother Rickon in the line of succession.
  </p>
  <p key="24d7ac44-b643-481c-ba49-6c9b7a2fa8b2">
   As the children of a lord inherit before his younger siblings, if Robb Stark were ever to father a child,

   Taken to its utmost extreme of putting female heirs behind all possible male heirs, Stannis may officially be ahead of Daenerys in line of succession. Viserys was always ahead of his distant cousin Robert, but Robert was still Viserys's closest male heir, and with
   Robert's death
   not long afterwards (coupled with
   Renly's death
   without issue) this makes Stannis the closest male heir. However, because Stannis has no sons, only his daughter
   <a href="Shireen Baratheon.html" key="0b16c7e5-c8e9-4db4-8579-fbcd30e0420a" title="Shireen Baratheon">

   </a>
   , Daenerys is still ahead of Shireen in line of succession, and without a male heir, Daenerys's claim might still be seen as ahead of the Baratheon line. Either way, King Aerys sentenced the

   traitors
   during Robert's Rebellion, so Daenerys could probably just dismiss Stannis as a traitor to the throne along with his brother.

  </p>
  <p key="f956d447-004b-4f87-970d-7956a46b675c">
   The greatest deviation presented in the society of the Seven Kingdoms is the extreme level of uniformity in feudal practices
   <i key="5371f23f-5ce0-4f23-b0bf-1ca16c6b6e6a">
    on the scale of an entire continent
   </i>
   . Since the 1970s, medieval historians have strongly challenged that "feudalism" was one uniform set of practices in all countries of Europe. For that matter, feudal laws and customs differed dramatically even within feudal countries from one major county or duchy to the next. Current scholarship has concluded that so-called "feudalism", as a universal construct, never actually existed. The very use of the term "feudalism" is considered to be outdated.
  </p>
  <p key="bf22a01d-bc05-437e-a8cb-463fc06de7cf">
   On the other hand, the Seven Kingdoms were unified under the Targaryen kings three hundred years ago, and this may explain the uniformity in feudal practices across the continent. In later books,
   <a href="George R.R. Martin.html" key="400eeb82-b7e7-44ad-bfa3-1aedd8155b05" title="George R.R. Martin">

   </a>
   began incorporating new background information to try to convey that each of the Seven Kingdoms didn't always possess uniform societies. For example,
   <a href="Currency.html" key="ea19268d-da14-438a-bc05-459c70e67f64" title="Currency">
    coinage
   </a>
   across the Seven Kingdoms during the time of Ned Stark is quite uniform, without regional variation. However, by the fourth book,
   <i key="100bacbd-f03c-43fe-a929-a2b5c7005cdb">
    A Feast For Crows
   </i>
   , Martin established that before the Targaryen Conquest the
   Kingdom of the Reach
   minted its own local coinage called "Hands" which were not equivalent to coinage from other kingdoms. The
   <i key="37925aba-5f7e-4993-941f-93b068894548">
    World of Ice and Fire
   </i>
   sourcebook (2014) does point out that even
   Aegon the Conqueror
   did not attempt to impose a uniform system of laws on the Seven Kingdoms after he unified them politically, but let each continue to function under its previous local laws. It was only his grandson
   Jaehaerys I Targaryen
   , whose long and peaceful reign lasted for 55 years, who was ultimately able to enforce a standardized legal code across all of the Seven Kingdoms - even then a process which took many years, and which of course even he was largely able to enforce because the Targaryens still had dragons to intimidate the local rulers into acceptance. Dorne wasn't part of the realm at the time, and because the union was through marriage-alliance when they later did unite with the Iron Throne a century later (still about one century ago), because the union was on equal terms the Dornish were allowed to keep their local laws and customs.
  </p>
  <p key="b2a9ff0d-d54c-42cc-9181-8aca2665bcf9">
   Another major difference is that primogeniture really wasn't practiced throughout much of Europe for most of the Middle Ages. The famous post-Word War II historian Georges Duby put forward a very influential social model of the Middle Ages claiming that primogeniture was practiced throughout Western Europe, but the past thirty to forty years' worth of medieval historians have largely debunked Duby's theories.
