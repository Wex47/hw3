   White Walkers outwardly resemble humans but differ greatly from them in other aspects. They are as tall as most humans and have long wispy white hair, with some also having white facial hair. They have pale grey-white skin which is sinewy and stretched taut across their frames, giving them a somewhat gaunt and mummified appearance despite their overall bulky frame. Their most notable trait however, are their vibrant deep blue eyes.

   The Night King is the supreme commander of the White Walkers, possessing the ability to directly control anyone in his army. It is implied that the White Walkers and Wights have a hive mind, being able to "see" through each other's eyes and sensing when someone in their army dies.

   The show never stated how many White Walkers existed in total or showed all the White Walkers in one onscreen shot. Usually a single White Walker or small groups were shown at one time, making it hard to establish how many White Walkers existed. Twelve White Walkers are shown in the background when the Night King turns Craster's last son. However, it is known that Craster sacraficed 99 sons to the White Walkers. Additionally, four White Walkers were killed on screen at different points in the series: one killed by Sam with a

   White Walkers have a very strong affinity with ice magic and coldness. They are physically far stronger than humans, capable of effortlessly tossing people back tens of feet in the air.
   Since they are inhuman, White Walkers have no physical restrictions. As such, they do not require food or water and seem to be immune to disease, fatigue, extreme cold and extreme heat. White Walkers are immortal. Their arrival is usually accompanied by blizzards and sudden temperature drops.
   Because of this, they can spread extreme cold wherever they go. The White Walkers wield
   swords and spears made from unique ice crystals
   .

   dead creature as wights, including horses, giants, and even dragons.
   They cannot, however, revive a corpse into servitude if it has been burned.
   Once a wight has been created, its eyes turn an icy blue, similar to the White Walkers' own eyes. Wights serve their masters without question.

   The Night King, leader of the White Walkers, possesses the ability to change humans into White Walkers.
   He picks up Craster's son from an icy altar and places an index finger on its cheek, causing the baby's eyes to glow blue and his skin to grow pale, taking on the appearance of the White Walkers. Whether or not this ability extends only to the Night King, all of the White Walkers amongst his caste, or all White Walkers in general is unknown.

   During the Massacre at Hardhome, White Walkers are shown to be resistant to fire due to the extreme cold they radiate, which snuffs out any flames in their vicinity.

   .
   Upon being stabbed by dragonglass, a White Walker's body will begin to freeze into ice from the point at which it was stabbed, causing the Walker great pain. Finally, it will begin to crack and fall apart, eventually shattering into ice. Valyrian steel has the same effect, but works much more rapidly. These materials are also resistant to being frozen and shattered on contact with White Walkers, unlike regular weapons.

   White Walkers are "glass cannons", possessing incredible strength and power but being very vulnerable. Any injury, no matter how minor or significant from weapons made of dragonglass or valyrian steel, will result in their death and the deaths of all things they have reanimated. Because of this, White Walkers tend to stay behind their undead wights or far away from conflict.

   Since the Night King was the first White Walker ever created, his death will cause the death of all other White Walkers, and subsequently, their wights. As such, he is simultaneously the strongest and weakest part of the undead army.

   far north
   , where they vanished. This victory led to a lasting truce between the Children and the First Men; the Children would keep their forests, and the Men could keep their farms, towns, and cities. The truce also marked the creation of both the Wall and the Night's Watch, the latter having been armed by the Children with dragonglass blades, in case the Walkers should ever return.
