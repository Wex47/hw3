   In Winterfell,
   cart loads of dragonglass which has been mined and shipped from Dragonstone is unloaded so that Gendry and his team can set to work forging the many thousands of weapons required for the upcoming battle against the

   The next time Arya sees Gendry, she asks whether he has made her weapon yet.
   He explains to her that he has thousands of arrow-headed spears to forge. After pointing out that hers needs to be much stronger than the one he shows her, Arya demonstrates her throwing skill to him. This encourages him to prioritise her weapon. Later on, Gendry brings Arya her newly forged weapon.
