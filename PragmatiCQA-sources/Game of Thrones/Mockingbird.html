    This episode continues a curious trend, in that the TV series has made no mention so far that unlike the rest of Westeros, Dorne practices equal primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child succeeds to a lordship regardless of gender. In the books, the current head of
    House Blackmont
    in Dorne is a woman, but the TV series changed "
    Lord Blackmont
    " to be a man when Tyrion meets the Dornish embassy in the Season 4 premiere. In this episode, Oberyn says that his

    - and Oberyn's mother was actually the Ruling Princess of Dorne in her own right, inherited from her parents. Oberyn's mother and Tyrion's mother
    Joanna Lannister
    were great friends at the time because they had both served as handmaidens to Queen
    Rhaella Targaryen
    (Daenerys's mother). Of course, this does not preclude the possibility that Oberyn's mother was also present at Casterly Rock or that the

    , only owning what he could carry. He answered Catelyn Stark's call for men to escort her and the captive Tyrion to the Eyrie, but by fighting and winning as Tyrion's champion in a trial by combat there, he entered into Tyrion's service - and by the end of Season 1 had become a direct retainer of one of the leading members of House Lannister. In Season 2, apart from being the chief bodyguard of the acting Hand of the King, he was briefly put in charge of the City Watch. At the beginning of Season 3, his social position was considerably elevated when he was

      The question "who do you think will end up on the Iron Throne at the end of the story?" is commonly asked about the series. Among the book fandom, Bronn's steady rise in power has led to the half-serious joke that at the rate he's going, he should be included on the short list of characters who might actually take the throne by the end of the story.

    Objectively, Bronn's refusal to fight for Tyrion is rational. Unlike
    the previous time he acted as Tyrion's champion
    , fighting for Tyrion this time is a lose-lose situation: either the Mountain kills Bronn, or he kills the Mountain, loses Stokeworth and gains nothing. As Kevan points out in the novel, the people of King's Landing hate Tyrion so much (although he did them a great favor by allegedly killing a monstrous tyrant) that an acquittal will not do him any good: as soon as he steps into the streets, the mob will tear him apart; he'd have no choice but to give up everything he had and leave the city, away from his vengeful sister who'd not let him enjoy his freedom too long. Penniless and homeless, he'd find it difficult to reward Bronn more than Cersei promised, and Bronn knows that well.

Hot Pie also asks if Brienne is a knight because she is wearing armor: in Season 2 episode 2, "

      Hot Pie was actually introduced in the Season 1 finale, and as of this episode has appeared at least once in every season of the series. This also means that he is one of a steadily decreasing number of recurring characters who were introduced in Season 1, reappeared in every season, and who are still alive (the same cannot be said of Joffrey).

    (Hot Pie) explained that the production team wanted a direwolf-shaped bread that looked exactly right (because the joke is that it looks so much more neat than his last attempt) but it would have wasted far too much time to just make one after another until one turned out well enough to use. Therefore, they actually baked something like 70 separate direwolf-bread loaves all at once on the day of filming, then picked the one they felt had turned out the best.

    Rorge
    and his sidekick
    Biter
    are actually major characters in the fourth novel. After they were taken to Harrenhal, they joined the infamous sellsword company known as the Brave Companions, led by Vargo Hoat. In the TV series, Hoat was changed to simply be a Bolton soldier named

     A Feast for Crows
    </i>
    , focuses on Brienne of Tarth's long and difficult search for the Stark sisters while roaming the war-ravaged and lawless Riverlands. As seen in Arya's storyline in Season 4, bandits are now roaming the devastated countryside at will: with the Starks defeated, the Brave Companions turn into the worst of these bandits, burning entire towns in their wake. This turns into a series of encounters in which Brienne personally fights and kills four of the Brave Companions – but never bringing her closer to finding the Stark girls. Within one episode, however, the TV series has made it clear that it will condense this entire long and slow-moving subplot: Rorge and Biter are killed off right away, and the first episode to focus on Brienne's search for the Stark girls ends with her already receiving the accurate tip that she should search for them at the Eyrie.

      Season 3 is adapting the second half of the third novel, but Brienne's narrative in it actually ended with her departure on her quest along with the sword, Oathkeeper. At this point she is approaching the end of her narrative from the fourth novel, though certain other plotlines have also moved beyond where they ended in the third novel (i.e., Bran Stark actually passed north of the Wall at the very end of the third novel).

    Actor
    Brian Fortune
    appears during the Night's Watch meeting as First Builder
    Othell Yarwyck
    , and the episode makes it a point to have Ser Alliser prominently introduce him by name. Fortune previously appeared in Season 1 as an unnamed Night's Watch officer, but who had prominent speaking lines (he officiated when Jon and Sam swore their vows before a heart tree). While the character was officially unnamed, at the time Fortune said that the writers told him he was playing Bowen Marsh, who is the First Steward and another prominent member of the Night's Watch. Based on this information, up until Season 4

    treated him as playing Bowen Marsh, but it has now been directly and clearly established in on-screen dialogue that he is actually playing Othell Yarwyck. The exact reason behind the change isn't clear. While this is a retcon, it actually doesn't significantly contradict previous information, because Fortune's character wasn't referred to by name in Season 1.

    ). Moreover, Dorne remained unconquered by the Targaryens for two centuries, only uniting with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms one century ago. The combined result of this geographical, ethnic, cultural, and political isolation is a very pronounced regional accent. Oberyn's anecdote also highlights that conceptions of "accent" are subjective: he considers fellow Dornishmen to be speaking normally, and that it's the rest of Westeros that speaks with an odd accent.

    The official blooper reel for Season 4 revealed that during the final scene when Oberyn visits Tyrion in his cell, in one take Pedro Pascal accidentally leaned too far backwards against a wooden beam, so that he knocked the flaming torch on the side of the beam nearly out of its holder. Pascal narrowly avoided having the flaming torch land directly onto his shoulder, or lighting his hair on fire.

    The episode also makes it clear that Oberyn is a few years older than Tyrion, having remembered him as a baby. In reality, however, Peter Dinklage is six years older than Pedro Pascal - though of course, Dinklage is also older than the two actors who play his older brother and sister, Jaime and Cersei. In the novels Tyrion is noted for not simply having dwarfism but also a stunted, ugly face in general, so Dinklage's older appearance can easily be explained away as part of Tyrion's infamously unhandsome features.
