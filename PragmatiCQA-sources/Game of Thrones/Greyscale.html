   Greyscale makes the surface of the skin harden and calcify, but in the early stages it is still fairly thin and brittle, so the body's movement makes the hardened tissue split into a network of cracks. The pattern made by the hardened and splitting skin is similar to cracks made in thin ice, and in later and more severe stages look somewhat like patterns of scales. In later stages the hardened flesh becomes mottled grey and black as it dies, resulting in the flesh appearing to have the texture of cracked grey stone, or like grey reptile scales - hence the name "grey scale". The discoloration comes in later stages: Shireen was cured in early stages before the disease could spread beyond her left cheek, before it could become discolored.
  </p>
  <p key="bcae9428-1c18-4633-821b-bd39e913eb64">
   Greyscale kills slowly, often taking many years to progress to a terminal state. Long before that, in the mid-to-late stages of the disease, the infection will spread to cover all of the victim's skin from head to toe, leaving them in agony. An infected person can survive like this for years, living in misery as one of the
   Stone Men
   .
  </p>
  <p key="cec84f81-3b84-4a21-857b-a72f1f60c8ae">
   In the very final stages of the disease, often years after the skin is completely covered, it starts attacking the body's internal organs, hardening them as it did the outer flesh. When it spreads to the brain, the deterioration can result in violent insanity. Most people rarely see these very final stages, however: only some of the Stone Men who have been quarantined off in ruins such as Valyria for many years have time to deteriorate to such a feral state. Otherwise, Stone Men are not thought of as violent but are pitied for their misery, although they are still shunned for being infectious.

   ’s infection suggests the top layer of greyscale acts as a sort of topical tumor on the infected person's body. The presence of pus under the infected tissue is an indicator that the body is still actively trying to fight off the infection. The greyscale most likely overpowers the host's immune system, spreading before the body has had time to build up an adequate amount of antibodies to combat the infection. Removing the greyscale tumors would allow the body's immune system to be capable of fighting off and overcoming the remaining infection. The medicinal ointment applied by Samwell could just be meant to prevent infection from other bacteria or viruses.

Sam finds a cure to Greyscale, presumably while searching through books in a section of the library available only to fully fledged Maesters, however the procedure is difficult, meticulous, dangerous, and rarely successful, having been forbidden due to many failed attempts and sometimes causing the treating Maester to become infected themselves, however Sam goes ahead and tries to treat Jorah. The treatment involves Sam separating and cutting away Jorah's infected skin layer with a scalpel and then placing a medicinal herbal ointment plaster on the exposed underlying tissue. This treatment is very painful and life-threatening for the patient due to the debridement of the skin and implied upsetting of the lower tissue. Such a procedure could cause the patient to die via blood loss or pain-induced shock. The patient's age is also stated to be a factor in treatment, as it's implied that the older the victim is, the less likely that treatment will be successful. Sam successfully cured Jorah of greyscale earning him a reprimand as well as praise for his quick thinking.

   According to
   Kerry Ingram
   (who plays Shireen), originally it took about three hours to apply the full Greyscale scarring makeup to the left side of her face, and about another two and a half hours to take it off.
   By Season 5, the makeup team managed to get the application time down to two hours.
   The Stone Men that appear in Season 5 required large foam pieces that covered all of the head and shoulders, and took about four hours to apply (Shireen's apparently still took some time because it was added on by hand and very detailed, while the more severe Stone Men prosthetics were large foam pieces that could be at least partially assembled prior to application).

   The affected hardened areas of skin also turn mottled grey and black, though Shireen's face isn't very discolored in the TV series - she has been cured of the disease, but in the novels the scars and dead tissue left behind are still grey and black. In Season 5, however, the Stone Men in Essos are actually depicted with grey and black stone-like scarring. According to behind-the-scenes featurettes for the episode "Kill the Boy", apparently this was done to show a contrast between Shireen (who had the disease cured years ago, and was only in its earlier stages before it could spread beyond her cheek) and people like the Stone Men with very late-stage greyscale, with much worse symptoms.

   's elder brother Harlon caught greyscale as a child and allegedly died from it (actually he was killed by Euron - it was not an act of mercy killing, as the wildlings do to those who contracted the disease, but of cruelty). He used to sit grey-faced and still in a windowless tower room and speak in whispers that grew fainter every day as the greyscale turned his tongue and lips to stone.

   Greyscale is considered a death sentence if contracted as an adult, though children have a slightly better chance of surviving it - though only in the sense that a handful of children have occasionally been cured of the disease. The symptoms can be stayed by limes, mustard poultices, and hot baths, though this is just delaying the inevitable. Greyscale kills very slowly, leaving its victims to suffer as their flesh deteriorates. Adults infected with greyscale can live a year or two, sometimes five, and it is not unknown for a few to live another ten years, but it always kills them in the end. Blindness commonly occurs if the infection spreads across the face to the eyes. In its very final stages, the disease turns inward, causing the flesh of muscles and organs to harden and die just like the skin in the outer tissue layers.

  <p key="8fec35f3-2f13-4b49-b1de-3c2d95801311">
   It is believed that cutting off any infected appendages can prevent it spreading throughout the body, though this treatment isn't always effective. Affected patches of flesh lose sensation: if someone is worried that they have caught the disease from an infected person, an early test before full symptoms appear is to prick the fingers and extremities with a knife on a daily basis. If it hurts, that person are safe; if that person can no longer feel the knife, it means they have greyscale, and should cut that body part (it is better to lose a toe than a foot). After Tyrion encounters the Stone Men in the novels, halfmaester Haldon advises him to prick his fingers and toes with a knife, checking to make sure he didn't catch greyscale from them, and he does that occasionally. Haldon warns Tyrion that he will never know for sure if he is clean; he may be going grey even as they speak, turning to stone from inside out, starting with his heart and lungs.

   Very rarely, children infected with greyscale can fight off the infection, though they are still left disfigured. It is feared that the disease still lies dormant in such children, though maesters insist that they are not infectious (i.e. Shireen's father Stannis, Davos, and the rest of their household do not fear that they can catch greyscale from her, but this is still a common superstition about people who survived greyscale). The

   call the disease the "grey death"; they still consider people who survive greyscale "unclean", and will euthanize any child that shows the symptoms.
  </p>
  <p key="4a13c9e2-5162-4ce5-b346-107ed49a56a5">
   There is no one, confirmed cure for children affected with greyscale - it is just that healers who try a variety of methods sometimes end up succeeding. In the TV series, Stannis explains that he brought in every maester, healer, and apothecary on both sides of the Narrow Sea to try to cure Shireen, and the combination of their efforts ended up succeeding - which is apparently also what Stannis did in the novels. None of them know what they specifically did that cured Shireen, or if it was a combination of different methods: basically, in desperation they "threw everything on the shelf" at the disease, and somehow this managed to cure her.

   Greyscale has no direct real-life equivalent: it is somewhat similar to
   leprosy
   in that it tends to disfigure those infected with it, and in how society fears people with greyscale as "unclean". Unlike leprosy, some people occasionally manage to fight off greyscale, though their disfigurements never heal. In this respect, greyscale is loosely also similar to smallpox: people who contracted smallpox could recover from it, but they might be left with permanent and severe scarring. Visually the scale pattern somewhat resembles icthyosis. Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) in a behind the scenes video for the TV series called it "sort of like a very vicious form of leprosy." Moreover, the real-life disease leprosy actually isn't highly contagious, only transmitted by prolonged contact with an infected person's nasal fluids (from coughing and sneezing) while trying to care for them; in contrast, greyscale so contagious that it can be spread simply by skin to skin touch, or even touching objects that an infected person has touched.

   While Shireen Baratheon was introduced in Season 3, no direct explanation was provided for the cause of her disfigurement in on-screen dialogue - meaning that it wasn't entirely confirmed that the disease was also called "Greyscale" in the TV continuity. It was only first mentioned by name in the updated HBO Viewer's Guide for Season 4, confirming the name.
   It was finally identified by name in Season 5 episode 2 "

   Craster's Keep

   her sisters
   died from greyscale, though this easily could have happened.

   It is not Jorah Mormont but another of Tyrion's companions, a sellsword named Griff (actually, the presumed-dead
   Jon Connington
   ), who contracts the greyscale. Connington does not seek a cure; he stoically accepts the fact that he is doomed, content that he has enough time to accomplish his goals, mainly to help the presumed-dead
   Aegon Targaryen
   , the son of Rhaegar and Elia, to ascend the Iron Throne.
