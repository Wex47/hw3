  <p key="bf88549a-db5d-402a-8bad-e6f50ee12af3">
   Dragons have long serpentine bodies, with proportionately long necks and tails. Their bodies have four limbs: two short back legs and two large wings as forelimbs, a body-plan similar to a bat. In later generations, after the dragons went extinct, physical descriptions of dragons became so confused in memory that artwork sometimes depicted them as having
   <i key="cb39f256-a19d-4518-aa31-39e5f01249f4">
    six
   </i>
   limbs - two wings growing out of their backs in addition to four legs - but this is inaccurate, at least in Westerosian legend. The teeth and claws of adult dragons are as long and sharp as swords.
  </p>
  <p key="2de7a05b-d1f1-4caf-afd6-5c8664336d7f">
   Dragons are covered in scales, as well as spines that run down their backs from head to tail. Particularly large ridges of horns frame the edges of their faces, running along the back of the skull and along the jawline, which grow bigger as they mature. Adult dragons possess two sets of frills that run along the backs of their necks and spine, two along the sides of their necks and another two centered closer to the backbone, for a total of four frills. These are formed from webbing that grows between longer spines. When dragons are agitated (or simply excited), they raise and flare these frills - similar to how a furry animal like a cat will raise the
   hackles
   on its back when agitated (or a feathered animal such as a goose will puff up its feathers), in an attempt to appear bigger so as to intimidate its enemies.
  </p>
  <p key="498be337-d875-40e5-a945-b26b9d0d4fa6">
   Dragons are also shown to have a variety of calls, from shrieking roars to low growls or hisses. They can even squeal.
  </p>
  <p key="d185dd45-d319-4069-a3ef-b7a62c88c3ea">
   Dragons are obligate carnivores, with diets consisting entirely of meat. Dragons need to roast their prey with their fire-breath before consuming it - the only animals apart from humans who prefer cooked meat. Dragons can eat almost any kind of meat, anything from sheep to fish. Historical dragons ridden as beasts of war were known to eat fallen horses and even men on the battlefield. Fully grown dragons could swallow a live horse whole.

   The scale color of dragons is highly variable, and historical dragons ranged in color from black to silver, red, gold, and even blue. Some dragons were one solid color throughout, but more often, they tend to have one primary color for most of their body, with highlights in a secondary color along their spinal crests, horns, and wing membranes. Confirmed markings observed so far include:

  </ul>
  <p key="2ce12ec6-066e-4944-8a09-827d29ac20ce">
   In addition to the various scales hues observed between specimens, dragons also displayed eye color variations. Dragons being reptiles, they had vertical slit pupils with large colored irises.

   Probably the most famous attribute of dragons is their ability to breathe fire. Dragon flame can turn flesh to ash, melt steel, and crack stone. Older dragons can produce a more intense flame for longer durations. The bodies of dragons are also very resistant to fire, particularly their own flames, which will not damage their own mouths as they expel them. Some believe that in many ways dragons

  <p key="8f1cc231-89df-49a3-879a-b551e60fa4a8">
   Dragons seem to produce their fire-breath by expelling chemicals out of two tubes either side of their mouths: when these volatile substances combine, they undergo an intense reaction which bursts into a directed jet of fire. Later in the series, this idea seemed to be abandoned. There are several shots where fire is seen emanating from the dragons' throats not out of the tubes in their mouths. During the

  <p key="9e3b5fe8-9d4a-415a-a2a5-ca7fefb908e3">
   Like most reptiles, dragons lay clutches of eggs. Dragon eggs are roughly the size of a human child's head, and as heavy as stone, so they need to be carried with two hands. The outer shell is covered in scales, with vastly different color patterns between eggs, usually matching the color of the dragon inside. Dragon eggs are notoriously difficult to hatch, though they can maintain the spark of life inside of them for decades if not centuries. The secret key to hatching the eggs seems to involve some form of
   blood magic
   : as the
   house words
   of the Targaryens hint, it requires "fire and blood". To hatch them, dragon eggs must be burned in roaring flames, with which another creature is simultaneously being burned alive - a life in exchange for a life. In the wild, this might just be a prey animal that the parent dragon kills, but human sacrifice will do the trick quite nicely, particularly if there is more than one egg to hatch.
  </p>
  <p key="db0f85fa-05e3-4f92-81fa-f79b21747b00">
   The exact details of dragon reproduction fell out of living memory in the nearly two centuries since they died out. Several conflicting theories and rumors have been circulated, some less grounded in fact than others. It is unclear if the mother guarded eggs she had laid, or simply left them to hatch and fend for themselves, or if the father aided the mother in caring for them. Dragons were apparently relatively solitary creatures, though it is unknown if any hierarchical relationships formed within groups of dragons.
  </p>
  <p key="e74f11a0-c42b-404a-b6f1-457479ab213d">
   Dragons, like birds, tend to imprint on whoever is present when they hatch, regarding that person as their parent.

   Newly hatched dragons are about the size of a small cat, but they grow very rapidly, reaching the size of a small dog in about one year, and the size of a small pony in only three or four years. The rate at which specific dragons can grow varies from one to the next, but in some cases dragons can grow big enough to ride after only a few years. It is unknown at what age dragons reach reproductive maturity. Dragons never stop growing as long as they live, and they can live for centuries, though many died in combat before reaching such an age. The largest Targaryen dragon,
   Balerion
   the Black Dread, lived for nearly two centuries and had a skull the size of a carriage.
  </p>
  <p key="80485832-0e23-4f31-b012-bbd627e72ecd">
   However, if dragons are chained or confined into an enclosed space for long periods of time it can hinder their growth and their overall size. Rhaegal and Viserion who hatched at the same time than Drogon were considerably smaller than their sibling, around half his size after being locked under Meereen's great pyramid for almost two years at an early stage of their development.
  </p>
  <p key="e454903b-429d-4baa-b7a9-e0561ddf8f1e">
   When dragons hatch, they do have horns around their faces and along their spines, but they are still quite small and relatively rounded. Their horns grow increasingly longer and sharper as they mature, quickly making the dragon appear more dangerous and menacing to prey or other dragons. The four lines of webbed frills along a dragon's spine only grow to a prominent size after they are about a year old. The bigger the dragon is, the bigger its appetite.
  </p>
  <p key="4e0a5802-1193-433e-aae9-bc1931a77f1e">
   When a dragon reaches adolescence, roughly when they are the size of a pony, they tend to be rebellious to a degree, much like how human teenagers are, even snarling at their imprinted parent. However, as they mature, this trait disappears.

   ", Viserys Targaryen lists off the names of several dragons whose skulls he says he saw stored in the Red Keep. This list is not from the books, none of them were ever mentioned again, and several of the names were inside jokes from the writers. The Targaryens did collect skulls of dragons that were in some cases thousands of years old,

   ones that they possessed since they came to Westeros, so it's possible that these existed at some point or another in Valyria's five thousand year history. His list included
