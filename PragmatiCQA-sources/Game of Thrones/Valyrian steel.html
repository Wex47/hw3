    Valyrian steel
   </b>
   is a form of metal that was forged in the days of the mighty
   Valyrian Freehold
   . When fashioned into bladed weapons, the steel can hold an especially keen edge, remaining sharp forever without the need for honing.

  <p key="8c9d59a2-7092-4938-bd7e-e05b5bc00b65">
   Aside from its sharpness, Valyrian steel is recognizable by its strength and light weight in comparison to ordinary steel,
   as well as by a distinctive rippled pattern visible in blades made from it.

   Like much of the Freehold's recorded knowledge, the secret of forging Valyrian steel was lost in the
   <a href="Doom of Valyria.html" key="f8b841cf-e459-49fe-9a0f-f6ec2acd55f8" title="Doom of Valyria">
    Doom of Valyria

   . After this point, creating new Valyrian steel weapons became impossible, so the original method can only be speculated: Some stories claim that the metal was imbued with magic spells and forged with dragonfire, though no one can confirm or deny this.
   Whatever the case, the material was expensive even during the Freehold's apex, so by the time of the Doom, Valyrian steel swords such as House Stark's
   Ice
   were already valued heirlooms passed down from one generation to the next in powerful noble families.

   Valyrian steel weapons by melting down existing ones, but it's a difficult process. The master-blacksmiths of

   are among the very few who can accomplish this feat, but even they don't know how to create entirely new Valyrian steel,
   and are famously secretive about how the reforging process works. Two smaller Valyrian steel swords can be made out of a larger greatsword, or a large greatsword made by melting down multiple smaller swords, but the amount of Valyrian steel in the world is finite and extremely rare.

   was apprenticed. This is all the more strange because Mott was actually introduced in the TV series in Seasons 1 and 2, so it is unclear why the TV series would then shift away from this plot point (it's possible that the actor was unavailable for Season 4). Either way, the "Histories &amp; Lore" animated featurette from the Season 2 Blu-ray set had already stated that it is the blacksmiths of Qohor who are famed for their ability to reforge Valyrian steel.

   According to legend, Valyrian steel was forged with dragon-fire and infused with magical spells - some say with
   blood magic
   , literally requiring "fire and blood" (like

   . Only 1 in about 100 Maesters has a Valyrian steel link in his chain, and the
   archmaester
   of the field also possesses a ring, a rod, and a mask made from the metal. The rarity of such links isn't because it's a difficult practice to master, but because most Maesters are notoriously anti-magic, while others even refuse to believe such a force still exists in the world, or that it ever did to begin with.

   's younger brother Gerion, apparently ended in failure, with no-one returning from the expedition. At least three times Tywin offered to buy Valyrian longswords from impoverished lesser houses, but his offers were firmly rejected. The little lordlings would gladly part with their daughters should a Lannister come asking, but they cherished their old family swords. This is what Jaime was referring to in "

   Suits of armor can also be fashioned of Valyrian steel, and would have been worth a kingdom even before the Doom. While Valyrian steel swords are rare in Westeros, Valyrian steel armors are even rarer -

    Valyrian steel shares many of its legendary traits with real-life
    Damascus steel
    : Both metals display a flowing water pattern, both were reputed to result in exceptional quality blades at the time, and like Valyrian steel, the true method for crafting Damascus steel has been lost, meaning that true Damascus steel weapons can no longer be crafted.
    Notably, even modern interpretations of Damascus steel are expensive, and a sword made using such material can easily cost twice that of a handmade sword from traditional or high-carbon steel.

    The Japanese
    Mokume-gane
    metalworking technique also resembles the description of Valyrian steel and may have origins from Damascus steel. It shares the distinct pattern of Damascus steel and Valyrian steel, but the method was not lost and often considered superior to Damascus steel (likely because it continued to be perfected to the present day). The actual type of steel used historically in Japan to make swords is called
    Tamahagane
    .
   </li>
   <li key="b6b3fc6e-f7ab-482c-af37-6cfae7b2b6e6">
    A different, but related, inspiration could be
    Ulfberht swords
    . Both types don't always follow medieval middle European designs and the origin of their metal came from Asia (India
    in the case of Damascus steel and through the
    Silk Road
    in the case of Ulfberht). The same applies to rust protecting technique e.g. found with the
    Sword of Goujian
    and others.

    In the show, the flowing water patterns are only visible in close-ups of the props, which would be true of Damascus steel swords as well, given how fine the patterns are. Some Valyrian steel swords are mentioned in the books as having unusual colors (i.e., dusky red and light violet), but this detail has been largely omitted from the swords seen on screen.
