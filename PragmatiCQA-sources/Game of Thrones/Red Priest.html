   Some Red Priests can cast magical "glamours", or illusions which alter a person's appearance. While Melisandre appeared relatively young to most people, it was later revealed that this youthful facade was in fact a powerful glamour to disguise her truly ancient appearance. Although this ability

   Red Priests appear to possess a much longer lifespan than most human beings, though it's not entirely clear why or how this is achieved. While they may live an uncounted number of years, they don't remain eternally youthful and their bodies will continue to age. Magical and possibly alchemical glamours - such as the one used by Melisandre - are used to disguise this aged appearance, so that even ancient Red Priests still seem young and full of vigor. Melisandre was the only Red Priestess confirmed to possess both this long lifespan and the magical powers necessary to disguise it.

   attempted to kill Melisandre by slipping poison into a cup of wine and presenting it as a peace offering. Even after realizing this, Melisandre was still able to drink almost the entire cup without fear, completely unaffected by the poison, while Cressen died moments later from a single sip, which he had taken to deflect suspicion. The red amulet around Melisandre's neck lit up and glowed as she drank, suggesting a connection between the neckalce and the spell.

   Red Priests can see into the future by staring into flames, and they are able to show these visions to others: Melisandre showed a vision to Stannis after his defeat at the

   , as she foreshadowed his fate to him before the battle. Thoros of Myr showed one of his flame-based visions Sandor Clegane, finally convincing the latter that his powers were real. By staring into Arya Stark's eyes, Melisandre was also able to see the eyes of many other people that Arya would "shut forever".

   Like any prophecy, however, these visions can be misinterpreted, or they may not manifest in the way the seer expects. Melisandre claimed that she saw a vision of herself witnessing the Bolton banners falling from Winterfell and Jon Snow fighting there. Certain that this meant that Stannis would defeat the Boltons with the help of Jon Snow, she becomes temporarily despondent when both Stannis and Jon are killed,
   believing that everything she saw in the flames was a lie.
   The vision is apparently fulfilled later, when the resurrected Jon defeats

   ", Beric was revived alive and well, his wounds healed within seconds of being slain. When Thoros later explained to Melisandre that he had also done this for Beric on five other occasions, she was astonished that it happened at all, let alone that it worked six times. Thoros himself insisted that he had no control over this ability, claiming that he was just a lucky drunk who recited the words, and the Lord of Light apparently saw fit to answers his prayers each time.
