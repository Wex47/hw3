   Cersei goes on to praise Tyene's beauty to Ellaria and suggesting that she is Ellaria's favorite. She contemplates how she will execute Ellaria or Tyene, cruelly suggesting Ser Gregor kill them the way he killed Oberyn. However, opining that it would be too fast a death, she kisses Tyene with the

   the girl will die, but also the inevitability of it, as the Long Farewell varies on how long it takes to kill, depending on the strength of its victim's constitution. Cersei tells Ellaria that she will be left alive to witness the event as well as to watch her daughter's "beautiful face crumble into bone and dust", and that she will be made to contemplate the things she has done, even to the point of being force-fed if she tries to starve herself to death. Before leaving, Cersei orders that torches be routinely replaced so that Ellaria doesn't miss a moment of Tyene's demise as Ellaria frantically struggles against her chains in a futile effort to reach her daughter.

    In the Inside the Episode video for the preceding episode, showrunners Benioff and Weiss praised that the four major political figures at Daenerys's council scene on Dragonstone were all women: Daenerys herself, and her allies Yara Greyjoy, Ellaria Sand, and Olenna Tyrell, who all joined her faction in the Season 6 finale. Within a single episode, all of these female political allies have been swept away: Yara and Ellaria captured, and now Olenna defeated and forced to commit suicide.

    In the novels, the Iron Bank first sends a representative (Noho Dimittis) to Cersei, and after he is repeatedly rejected, Tycho Nestoris is sent to make an arrangement with Stannis for settling the debt; that order makes more sense for collecting a debt - first you address the debtor, and if he refuses to pay, use other means to collect the debt. In the show, it is the other way around.

    to outlaw slavery. Although Pentos and the others found loopholes to allow the practice to continue, all the Free Cities in Braavos's sphere of influence nominally outlaw the practice to this day.

     <li key="03d492c2-3171-4ebf-aebc-444090513672">
      A question unaddressed even in the novels is that seven out of the nine Free Cities still practice slavery, while the Iron Bank is said to be the biggest bank in the entire region (bigger than the banks of the other eight combined) - thus, it is so enmeshed in the economies of the other seven that it unclear how Braavos could lend money to these other Free Cities without it being at least

      influenced by the slave trade. For example, if the Iron Bank gives loans to Myrish lace manufacturers,

       Myr
      </a>
      uses a large slave population as laborers. Slavery is illegal in Westeros, too, but characters in King's Landing are described as wearing fine lace imported from Myr (probably made with slave labor or indirectly benefiting from it).
     </li>
     <li key="621f7b8c-766f-4f09-90c1-95b2e7bde23f">
      The novels do mention that Daenerys's initial actions in the
      Liberation of Slaver's Bay
      had far-reaching economic ripple-effects: slaves were the one major export of that region, and without it their local economy is suffering, as are the economies of their importers.
     </li>
     <li key="803bebe3-d3ff-4405-b1f5-cae4088cd8c3">
      It is unclear exactly what the TV writers meant by this exchange: if they were implying the Iron Bank of Braavos is directly involved in the slave trade (which
      <i key="c0fc197a-90e0-40b5-9934-e6175e8e6dcb">
       severely
      </i>
      contradicts the books, and even their own materials which say slavery is outlawed in Braavos), or, if they just mean that disrupting the slave trade had ripple effects throughout the local economies across all of Essos.
     </li>
     <li key="ca4fe758-70c5-4bfb-a8d4-aafb166a9392">
      The conversation between Tycho and Cersei is perhaps based on two scenes of the fifth novel, in both people complain that the disruption of slave trade by Daenerys has negative applications on worldwide economy: Xaro (who is alive in the books) tells that to Daenerys, while Tyrion and Haldon hear the same from a custom officer named Qavo.

    Tycho's comment that Cersei is her "father's daughter" is ridiculous, to say the least: Tywin, despite his cruelty, was a very efficient ruler and politician, while Cersei is totally incompetent as a ruler and in other aspects (as a mother); Kevan, Jaime and Tyrion make a point of that. The novels underscore her foolishness, absurd schemes and decisions, which all backfire at her. One of Cersei's most foolish mistakes is her stubborn refusal to pay the crown's debts to the Iron Bank; as a result, the Iron Bank decides to support Stannis.

Stannis intends to use those funds to hire a huge new army of 20,000 mercenaries from the Free Cities (though it is uncertain those reinforcements can be hired and brought to the battlefield in time). The bank does this because it has totally lost faith in Cersei's ability to lead after a string of debacles, and on top of this was insulted when she simply brushed its envoy Noho Dimittis aside and announced she wouldn't attempt to pay the bank back for the indefinite duration of the ongoing rebellions against her. How the bank will respond in future books is unclear, however, as Stannis is still alive in the novels but not in the TV series - i.e. if given a pure choice between Cersei or Daenerys it is uncertain how it would respond.

    flowering
    in Season 2, and spied on Tyrion and Shae in Season 4. She doesn't actually have an in-universe name, but is credited as "

      Cersei's handmaiden "Bernadette" has switched her clothing to emulate Cersei's new style: short cut hair and black, masculine robes. No one would want to show up Cersei by wearing longer hair than her after it was forcibly shorn off by the Faith Militant. Cersei shifted to black as a mourning color for her father and children, and she wears a lot of metal, armor-like pieces, imitating her father's appearance in some ways. Cersei's handmaidens copying her new clothing style is consistent with the "trickle down" principle of fashion that
      Michele Clapton
      established for Westerosi high society, and which has been visible on-screen throughout the TV series (see
      Costumes/The Seven Kingdoms
      ). In this case, of course, there is a greater element of self-preservation in dressing like Cersei than ever before.

    The question arises that at least a year may have passed since Cersei's hair was shorn by the Faith Militant in the Season 5 finale, but Cersei's hair is still short: it's slightly longer than when they cropped it close to her head, but otherwise has stayed in a close pixie-cut. The answer might simply be that Cersei is

     intentionally
    </i>
    keeping her hair short now. This actually would fit her backstory: as she explained in both the books and Season 2's "

Cersei is an extreme narcissist, and in some ways its implied that she has sex with Jaime because it's almost like having sex with a mirror image of

    Cersei repeats the boast the Euron made in the Season 7 premiere that he is the best ship captain on the "Fourteen Seas". Again, this isn't a term from the novels, though being a fictional fantasy world, there's no reason for them to have an exact equivalent for the phrase "
    seven seas

In fact, it might not actually refer to fourteen distinct bodies of water - the real life term "seven seas" doesn't necessarily refer to seven actual bodies of water either - "seven" is just a lucky/prime number that is alliterative with "seas", so the TV writers may have picked "fourteen" because it is assonant with "sea".

      It appears the TV writers are simply wrapping up the Dorne subplots as quickly as possible as an admission of failure, after the extremely negative critical reception that their truncated adaptation of it received for Season 5.

Henwick said the producers told her that if she couldn't fit it into her schedule, they wouldn't even bother recasting the role with another actor, and simply leave the character's fate unexplained (though ultimately she was able to make it in). The lack of planning around Nymeria's fate seems to reaffirm that the TV writers simply don't want to expend any more effort tying up loose narrative ends regarding Dorne.

The TV series has increased Tyrion's age a few years so the span this occurred in is a little different, but from this and other evidence the pattern loosely holds that each of the four seasons in Westeros, while variable, usually lasts around one or two years - three year long seasons only happen every few decades, and a

It was also brought up that the commoners think a long summer will be followed by an equally long winter, but Pycelle dismisses this as just superstition - they really can't predict how long new seasons will be. Time moves more slowly in the TV series timeline, so the autumn which began the same time as the War of the Five Kings lasted about two years before turning into winter. In the TV series, this autumn lasted five years.

      The books have more explicit scenes of characters worrying about winter provisions: autumn is when they harvest and store crops for the long winter, but instead all of the able-bodied men were off fighting and dying in the war, and the burned out the major breadbasket region of the Riverlands.

    Sansa observes that the steel breastplates that some of the blacksmiths are making (who apparently came north with the Vale army) need to be covered in leather for the cold. The
    costume
    designers have explained this in interviews since Season 1: metal doesn't retain heat well, and additionally, exposed metal armor in freezing temperatures is very cold, so it will actually give its wearer frostbite burns if it isn't protected with a layer of other material. This isn't some special knowledge Sansa would have, though - any child in the north would know this is how they need to equip for the cold, but the Vale lords aren't used to arming for a northern winter.

    Field of Fire
    that no regular army could stand against his dragons; he also joined the surviving strength of all the defeated kingdoms to his own. When Torrhen finally reached the south and saw Aegon's vast power, he realized that fighting was pointless (the North needs every man it has to survive its deadly winters and wildling invasions) - so he surrendered without a fight.

    Daenerys's statement "the last King in the North was Torrhen Stark" is incorrect, because there was another King in the North after him, preceding Jon - Robb. Either Daenerys has not been fully updated about the political affairs in Westeros, including Robb's coronation; or thought Robb could not be considered as a king because his period of reign was so short and unstable; or thought that Robb was never legally crowned, since in her eyes - the Targaryens are still the legal monarchs of Westeros, and no one can declare himself King in the North ever since Torrhen bent the knee to her ancestor.

    Daenerys quips that she "didn't receive a formal education". She was just an exile on the run throughout her childhood, without a true home, bouncing from one patron to the next with her brother until the novelty of their presence wore off and they'd have to go begging somewhere else. She wasn't taught by a maester in a castle like many great lords - though she is a quick study and very intelligent. The novels make this more clear; the history books about Westeros that Jorah gave her at her wedding were the first time she'd had access to thorough information about Westeros.

This was a change from books to TV series though somewhat grey: in the book version, Daenerys does remark in later books that Viserys tried to buy an army with her virginity and she was sold off like a horse, but she actually fell in love with Drogo. In the book version of their wedding night, however, she resists him at first but then says "yes" as they have sex - and the term "rape" was not applied to it as such (due to being a pre-modern society without a definition of marital rape). On top of this, she was 13 years old at the time in the books (though considered of marriageable age because she had had begun
    flowering
    ). Perhaps to sidestep the controversy that would have arisen from trying to defend this as not being rape, the TV show changed it to actually depict her wedding night as rape, and the showrunners refer to it as "rape" in their Blu-ray commentary.

Martin was guarded in his comments and said that if anyone wanted to know why the change was made they would have to ask showrunners Benioff and Weiss, because it wasn't his idea (see the pilot episode article for more information).

    Continuing from the first two episodes, Daenerys's new costume style has shifted to the "old Targaryen style" that her brother Viserys wore back in Season 1 (with a few touches from the other styles she had in her travels). On formal occasions, such as her wedding, Viserys would embellish his tunic with a short ceremonial cape pinned to one shoulder. Daenerys didn't have the short pinned cape in the first two episodes of this season while she was traveling, but to receive Jon Snow in this episode she wears her full formal regalia including a short red cape pinned to one shoulder, like Viserys. Notice the delicate embroidery pattern on it meant to be reminiscent of dragon-scales. See "

      Davos mentions he's heard about the beautiful palm trees and butterflies on Naath. In the books, it is indeed famous for its butterflies - to the point that it is often called, "Naath, the Isle of Butterflies". While beautiful, however, the butterflies are carriers for a deadly and horrific plague which kills any outsiders who visit the island if they stay more than a few hours. The indigenous Naathi people are immune to the "butterfly fever", and this protected them from foreign invasion for many centuries, but eventually foreign slavers figured out that the butterflies are only active in the day, so they could avoid it by raiding the island for slaves at night.

Varys also reveals to Tyrion several secret passages in the Red Keep, which he uses for the same purpose. One of those passages leads to the Tower of the Hand; Tyrion uses it, while escaping from prison, to confront his father.

    made no attempt to free him - it's possible that the Jaime's Lannister contingent simply took him with them when they left. If they did send him ahead to Casterly Rock, it isn't a contradiction that the Unsullied didn't free Edmure: logically, if Jaime knew an enemy force would take the castle, to the point he intentionally removed everything of use (emptying the larders, etc.) if Edmure

      The Battle of the Whispering Wood wasn't referred to by name during the episode it took place in - because due to budget constraints, it happened off-screen. Stark soldiers, however, did refer to it as "Whispering Wood" in Season 2, and Robb prominently said in the Season 3 premiere that his army hadn't had a good fight since "Whispering Wood", because the Lannisters were avoiding meeting his forces in a direct confrontation (so they could exhaust him through attrition).

      en route to Riverrun, he takes precautions (sending scouts ahead, forbidding his men to leave the column without permission, placing sentries, etc.) to make certain he will not be taken by surprise again. Such precautions may seem unnecessary, for at that point the Starks have been brought down, so Jaime does not expect any serious attack; the Brotherhood members hunt down only lone Freys, and they wouldn't attack a large host. Still, Jaime insists on acting warily, consistent with the change he has gone throughout the third novel: once he was rash and reckless, and now he is calculating and cautious.

      in this same episode: the well-defended castle is taken after the elite attacking force suffers numerous causalities from arrows and close combat - even from a token garrison left behind while the main Lannister army left, due to the defensive advantage of such a strong castle. Indeed, in the case of Casterly Rock, the Unsullied took a few casualties but managed to quickly take the castle due to Tyrion's plan to infiltrate it using his knowledge of the sewer line. The Lannister-Tarly force would have no such advantage against Highgarden, even if it only had a token defense.

      in a wager on a tournament joust between Loras and Jaime (right before the story begins), because he bet on Jaime and was surprised when Loras managed to beat him.

        have significantly more moments in the novels which established his presence as a "formidable warrior" with "fighting as his forte" - though even the TV series introduced his earned reputation and abilities in prior seasons. This brings up the separate issue from the Season 7 premiere of the
        Abandonment of Dragonstone
        : the TV series said that Stannis simply abandoned the castle when he left, and during the intervening three years, no one else attempted to claim it (this
        <i key="ac9598da-bba4-4d66-919c-6559e5ebd363">
         never happens
        </i>
        to any castle in the history of Westeros). In the books, Stannis left a small token garrison behind, who nonetheless could have held out for months due to the strength of the castle, so the Lannister and Tyrell fleets were forced to blockade the island. With the rise of Euron's ironborn to the west, the Tyrell fleet urgently needed to return home, so Loras volunteered to forced a quick end to the siege by storming the castle, at great personal risk to himself. All who saw Loras fight were awed by his skill and bravery, carving his way through waves of foes, despite taking numerous severe wounds that he shrugged off, until boiling oil was dropped on him from a tower. The TV series cut this out entirely: thus Benioff claims that the Tyrells are not established as "formidable warriors", in part, because the showrunners
        <i key="5a15a34d-fb4f-492f-a9a0-3ca687a979a4">
         omitted

        a major scene from the novels which establishes Loras as a "formidable warrior" - regardless of the fact that he is homosexual. Even removing the Dragonstone subplot, prior seasons nonetheless

    The fact that Lord Randyll has decided to turn against the Tyrells, despite the reservations he expressed in the previous episode, perhaps implies that House Tarly will act the same in the upcoming novels (though will not necessarily side with the Lannisters).

      In "The Griffin Reborn" chapter of the fifth novel, a group of Targaryen sympathizers discusses whether it is a good time to invade Westeros; one of them says "some of us still have friends in the Reach. The power of Highgarden may not be what Mace Tyrell imagines". There are various fan speculations about the identity of the "friends"; they can be any of the houses of the Reach, among them House Tarly.
