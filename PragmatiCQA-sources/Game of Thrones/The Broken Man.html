Olenna threatens to have her guards come in, but Margaery again defends the septa. She states that Unella has been a true friend and teacher, to which Olenna asks with some horror what the

Olenna retorts that they marched on the Sept for Margaery and Loras' sake, and that Loras is still in prison. She then tries to convince Margaery to leave King's Landing and return to

   Margaery instead pleads for Olenna to return to Highgarden instead. As she emphatically tells her grandmother to return home, Margaery secretly slips a piece of paper into Olenna's hand. In doing so, she seems to have successfully communicated to Olenna that she doesn't quite mean what she's been saying in front of Septa Unella, and Olenna's expression changes, realizing this.

Olenna retorts that the reason all of this is happening is because of Cersei, as she was the one who allowed the Faith Militant to reform and allowed them to arrest Loras and Margaery. Cersei admits that she made a mistake with the Sparrows, but insists that an alliance between the Lannisters and Tyrells is more important now than it ever was. Olenna refuses her, noting that Cersei has neither influence nor support anymore and is surrounded by enemies. She tells Cersei that she (Olenna) will be leaving the city as soon as possible, and that Cersei's utter defeat is her only consolation.

Sansa disagrees, instead opting to try and recruit more houses (

    and thus "broken". In the books, "broken men" is a term for conscripts during wartime who desert and turn into bandits, wretched men living from one day to the next. A character named Septon Meribald gives a lengthy speech about broken men, and how they should be pitied for their miserable state (lowering themselves to animals).

Another clergyman known as the Elder Brother is at a monastery dealing with other refugees from the war - and is heavily implied to have saved Sandor Clegane's life and nursed him back to health in his community.

    just like Sandor's
    and spot a large limping monk digging graves who might be him (they can't tell because he is wearing a large hood and cloak). A third possible hint is that the large gravedigger bends down at one point to pet a dog, i.e. a

The TV version basically condensed Septon Meribald and the Elder Brother together into one character: they are similar characters in the books. In the "Inside the Episode" featurette, however, the showrunners refer to him as "

    In the prior novels, and before in Season 3, the Brotherhood Without Banners was defending the commoners from random raids and slaughter. That they're killing villagers who won't give them food supplies now is a major shift. In the books they would also take provisions from villagers, but they were at least polite about it and would make the token gesture of giving them an IOU note, promising - maybe even meaning to keep their promise - to pay it when the war is over (as they gave Sandor in Season 3, even though like him villagers point out that this is functionally worthless at the moment). Still, this was in contrast to Lannister raiding parties, who killed any who resisted, or just killed villagers to intimidate them, and would not even bother to promise to pay back what they plundered.

    The
    Siege of Riverrun
    subplot is a holdover from the fourth novel which, like the Greyjoy Kingsmoot subplot, was pushed back to Season 6, because Season 5 condensed the storylines for other major characters (Jon Snow, King's Landing, Tyrion, Daenerys) from both books four and five into a single season. In the books, Brynden Tully never had to retake Riverrun from a light Frey garrison - he wasn't present at the Red Wedding in the book version, instead Robb Stark left him behind at Riverrun with the Tully army to hold their southern flank and to guard his wife Jeyne Westerling. After word came out of the massacre at the Red Wedding, Brynden pulled back his men to the castle and gathered ample food supplies for a lengthy siege. The Siege of Riverrun is ongoing in the background from the middle of the third book to about the middle of the fourth book by the point Jaime arrives with a Lannister army to help the Freys.

      as he did in Season 5 of the TV series - the Dorne subplot in Season 5 was so heavily condensed or outright changed that it bore little resemblance to that subplot in the novels. Instead, that was the point in time at which Jaime left for the Riverlands to deal with holdout pockets of Robb Stark's Tully allies - and thus he wasn't present when the Faith Militant arrested Cersei, nor for her impending trial by combat. When he received a letter from Cersei, begging him to come back and aid her, he burned it in disgust (perhaps as a symbolic gesture of severing their relationship for good), since he did not love her anymore, and knew she was guilty of all the crimes she was charged with - high treason, adultery, fornication, incest and the murders of Robert and the former High Septon.

In peacetime the castle is located on a triangle of land where the two rivers meet, with water on two sides: in time of war and siege, the Tullys open several levies to flood the remaining third side, essentially turning it into a small island - making it very difficult to besiege, as any attacker has to divide its forces into three portions to cover each water crossing.

      In the books, the Frey who commands the siege and nearly hangs Edmure on a daily basis is Ryman Frey - eldest son of
      Stevron Frey
      , who died earlier in the war, thus making him Lord Walder's heir. Incidentally, Ryman also personally killed Lyanna Mormont's eldest sister Dacey Mormont at the Red Wedding (though both Ryman and Dacey were omitted from the TV adaptation).

      In the books, Ryman was the Frey that Jaime struck across the face to teach him a lesson about not making idle threats: the TV version condensed this with Black Walder Rivers. As seen in the episode, Jaime struck him with his golden prosthetic hand, badly injuring him and knocking him to the ground. In the books the hand is solid gold, though for unknown reasons the TV series had Jaime point out that it is gold-plated steel - still a heavy, solid-metal prosthetic.

      Guest right
      , killing his own niece and great-nephew while they were guests at the Freys' table. Thus, while not explicitly spelled out in the episode, Brynden doesn't budge when the Freys threaten to kill his nephew Edmure because first, he can sense they're bluffing; but more importantly, he has

        Brynden actually says in the episode that "Edmure is marked for death" no matter what he does. For his part, Edmure also seems to have accepted that the Freys will kill him no matter what happens: notice that he doesn't seem surprised or upset by his uncle Brynden's refusal to surrender, and he doesn't bother pleading to either his uncle or the Freys, but just stoically accepts that he's going to die one way or another.

      Brynden states that Riverrun has enough food supplies to last for two years. In the books, he similarly managed to gather ample food supplies at the castle before the siege began, right after the Red Wedding. In the TV version, the siege wasn't going on off-screen this whole time but is stated to have only recently begun after Brynden recaptured it in a sneak attack, thus he still has two full years worth of food supplies in this version as well. Sieges can last for many years in Westeros, because castles are built with larger storage space to survive the years-long winters.

      , even though it still does not absolve the Freys of their crimes. Running out of patience, Jaime challenges Brynden to single combat, with each choosing a champion, but Brynden instead offers to fight Jaime one-on-one. Jaime agrees, but Brynden, aware of House Lannister's general lack of dignity and honor, balks at the last minute and returns to the castle, whereupon Jaime goes back to the siege camp.

    In the books, Jaime didn't bring a full Lannister army of 8,000 men to Riverrun to assist the Freys: instead, some elements of other Lannister armies were already present, commanded by his cousin Daven Lannister (son of
    Stafford Lannister
    ), who had been struggling in vain to get the Freys in line (Daven is a capable leader and Jaime sympathizes with his troubles). Thus in the book version, Jaime only brought about 1,000 new Lannister soldiers with him as reinforcements from King's Landing. As the siege was a recent development in the TV version, TV-Jaime apparently just brought them all at once (it wasn't stated how many Lannister soldiers were already present under Daven's command in the books). The Frey army surrounding Riverrun numbered about 2,000 in the books (most of the other half of their army accompanied the Boltons to Winterfell to help them hold the North, but this was cut from the TV version).

Martin explicitly did this due to the freedom of constraints he had when writing a novel - after the heavy restraints on his screenwriting for television, which directly commanded that he never have two characters with the same first name. The TV series, however, reversed this in many cases, because it doesn't have as much time to explain character relations as clearly as a book can, i.e. this season the Karstarks are led by "
    Harald Karstark
    ", as opposed to his brother from the novels, "Eddard Karstark" - apparently because it was feared viewers would confuse this with "Eddard Stark" himself. Lyanna Mormont is thus one of the few cases of a repeated first name in the TV series (outside of a dynasty) - probably because it's a plot point that her family is so attached to the Starks they named their children after them.

She has older surviving sisters (the eldest, Dacey Mormont, died at the Red Wedding). Maege did leave young Lyanna as the

Maege did appear in Season 1 but had no speaking lines and disappeared without explanation from Season 2 onwards: her subsequent status after the Red Wedding was unclear in the TV continuity, but this episode directly states that Maege died at some point in the war "fighting for Robb". Maege in the TV series was apparently simplified to not have any other daughters, making Lyanna Mormont the official new head of the House. In the books, Maege's five daughters in descending age were Dacey, Alysane, Lyra, Jorelle, and Lyanna (and Alysane had two small children of her own).

    Following the liberation of Deepwood Motte by Stannis in the books, the Glovers and more northern houses, openly join his army (even though their remaining forces are meager), and their combined strength becomes an increasing threat to the Boltons. The TV series adapted all of this out so Stannis isn't seen rallying any Northern Houses to his side - though in the books, Stannis did liberate Deepwood Motte due to direct advice from Jon Snow, who told Stannis it would make the local Houses start rallying to him.

The very fact that 10 year old Lyanna is now head of her House evidences that many of the adults of fighting age have been killed by this point.

      In turn, this explains why unlike much of the rest of Westeros or even the rest of the North, Bear Island has a strong tradition of producing
      Warrior women
      : Bear Island itself is fairly poor and densely forested (as seen in the episode), so its inhabitants gain most of their sustenance by fishing the surrounding waters. This means that the men are often out at sea for days at a time, unable to react to surprise sea raids made by ironborn or wildling boats that slip past them to get to their homes on the island. As a result, the mothers and older daughters of families on Bear Island had to learn to take up weapons themselves to defend themselves and their homes. While they apparently follow the inheritance laws of the mainland, putting daughters behind sons, so many men die in raids that families from the island fully prepare their daughters to fight and potentially have to rule some day.

      In part this explains why Lyanna Mormont is such a confident, capable, and defiant ruler despite being a 10 year old girl. Many major lords on the mainland don't expect their daughters to come to rule and thus don't train them for it, i.e.

Maege had five daughters and no sons but she did raise the eldest of them, after Jorah fled, with the expectation that she would one day rule Bear Island in her own right. As the elder sisters were omitted from the TV version and Lyanna is the only daughter, Maege had been raising TV-Lyanna for years with the expectation that she would one day rule House Mormont, explaining her confidence and capability in this episode.

      Much of Martin's point with Robb Stark was a deconstruction of the classic Fantasy trope of the romantic young warrior king: in real life, a brash young warrior who did what he felt like and broke vital marriage alliances would end up getting killed. In the books, when it is revealed that Robb Stark broke his promise of a marriage-alliance with the Freys, they ride out of his camp furiously, and even the lords that stay loyal to Robb lose a large amount of respect for him (both the ideal of keeping his vows, and ignoring the practical reality that he

The TV version didn't stress this very much before: after Robb and Talisa's secret wedding in the Season 2 finale, at the beginning of Season 3 she is openly referred to as his new queen by his lieutenants, with little overt criticism. Instead it was almost presented as if Robb was

        In contrast to Jared's outright lies, Rhaegar's criticism of Robb is correct: he took nearly all the northern troops to the south, allowing the ironborn to raid the north freely; he was so obsessed with his vendetta against the Lannisters, that he ignored the reports about the ironborn's invasion and did not even consider to return or send any troops back (unlike in the TV show, Roose never suggested Robb to send Ramsay to liberate Winterfell - it was done without Robb's knowledge and reported to him only afterwards), not even after Wintefell was taken, but only after he heard about the alleged deaths of his brothers - then it was too late; and he did break his pact with the Freys.

Realistically, an alliance between the Reach and the North seemed to be very unlikely because it was the intention of Mace Tyrell that Margaery becomes the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, not of just a part of Westeros (Robb had no ambitions to claim the Iron Throne), even if it meant betraying the rebels and siding with the Lannisters who had started the war with their own treachery.

      ", when Tyrion confronted Tywin about the Red Wedding, the latter cynically responded by asking if it was better to kill thousands of their enemies on the battlefield or at dinner - by killing them in a surprise ambush at a wedding, they were saving the lives of thousands of Lannister soldiers who otherwise would have perished grinding down Robb's dwindling forces. Tyrion, however, sharply criticized his father that the North would never forget such a horrifying violation of the laws of war and guestright. Ironically, time proved Tywin wrong and Tyrion correct: had Tywin done the honorable thing and just ground Robb down through attrition on the battlefield, Robb's surviving followers like the Mormonts and Tullys might have accepted that Robb was a brash failure and grudgingly accepted Lannister rule. Robb's strict adherence to personal honor may have seemed naive and cost him the allegiance of the Karstarks and Freys, but Tywin's use of dirty tactics is now coming back to haunt his family. As Tyrion said at the time, every time the Lannisters destroyed one enemy using dishonorable tactics, all this did was create new enemies who swore vengeance for the Lannisters' crimes.

      An explanation could be that it's Lyanna's personal sigil. In Westeros arms belong to a family, and any trueborn child may use them. This is similar to the practice in German heraldry, and converse to the practice in British heraldry, where only the head of the family may use the family arms; other members of the family have to difference their arms in some way.

      The Hornwoods have sporadically appeared in the background of the TV series since Season 1 - primarily that their heraldry of a moose's head was clearly visible at the Tourney of the Hand. Their banners appear again at the Stark army camp in this episode (a brown moose head on an orange background). Their role is somewhat larger in the books: their lands border the Boltons' territory on the southern side, and when Robb left with most of their armies, Ramsay kidnapped Lady Hornwood, forced her to marry him and raped her, then flayed all the skin off her fingers and locked her in a tower cell until she starved to death - then used this forced marriage (really, abduction) as a nominal claim to seize control of Hornwood lands. Understandable, the Hornwoods have specific reason to hate Ramsay by this point - though all of this was omitted from the TV version.

      "House Mazin", meanwhile, does not exist in the books at all - it is an in-joke reference to screenwriter Craig Mazin, who doesn't directly work on the TV series but gave the showrunners vital advice about the unaired pilot episode. This is the third time it has been mentioned in the TV series, the second this season. A new second-tier "major House" can't easily be fit into the map of the North at this point, given that the books have already clearly defined who controls which territories. There are two in-universe possibilities: House Mazin might be a prominent third-tier "minor House" (similar to how House Forrester are prominent vassals of House Glover, who are themselves vassals of the Starks), or they might be one of the 40 or so minor noble Houses from the northern mountain clans who live northwest of Winterfell - they are all as weak as minor Houses, but are technically second-tier major Houses in the sense that they are sworn directly to the Starks and don't have any other overlords. The books never gave a definitive list of all of the northern mountain clans.

      Sansa also mentions that she wants to try to visit
      Castle Cerwyn
      .
      House Cerwyn
      's castle-seat is very close to Winterfell, directly south of it (their army camp is northwest of Winterfell at the moment). Recall that last season Ramsay demanded that the Cerwyns pay the Boltons taxes as the new lords of Winterfell and the North, but when Lord Cerwyn refused, Ramsay publicly flayed him alive, along with his wife and brother, while forcing his son to watch. Ramsay was satisfied that the son, the new lord of House Cerwyn, then paid his taxes, but Roose was disgusted that Ramsay traded a short-term gain for earning the long-term enmity of the surviving Cerwyns.

    for the TV series, whom she killed in the Season 5 finale. It is quite probable that Arya killing Raff will anger the Faceless Men both because she did it without orders and because he was a major enemy of "Arya Stark" - demonstrating that she will never let go of her past and never be "no one". In the previous episode, the Faceless Men decided to kill her for refusing to kill a target - because seeing the play makes her remember who she is and "Arya Stark" would never dishonorably kill someone who she felt didn't deserve it. Now at this point - barring a few bits and pieces which might have been reshuffled to later episodes - Arya is advancing completely beyond her currently known book material.

      In the previous episode, Arya was smart enough to know the Faceless Men would try to kill her, so she was hiding in the sewers. In this episode, she brazenly goes into a public market to buy passage on a ship, then simply

    , not for Arya. The Faceless Men are supposed to be "no one" and never kill due to personal reasons, but the Waif is clearly resentful of Arya. Jaqen directly ordered the Waif not to let Arya suffer (i.e. to just kill her with a fast-acting poison) but she disobeyed by trying to stab Arya to death - in which case the Waif actually proved that she isn't "no one". In the books, the Faceless Men actually don't blindly accept any assassination contract, but will refuse those they morally don't agree with (though their enigmatic belief system about which deaths are "due" to the
    Many-Faced God
    and which are not can be inscrutable). Thus it's possible that Jaqen wasn't necessarily upset that Arya wouldn't kill a target she didn't think deserved it.

   <li key="67d31ecc-9688-4952-b0d3-ce15b42b9da6">
    If this was a test for the Waif and not Arya, that means that Jaqen (or one of the other Faceless Men) is wearing an Arya face-mask. In the books, the Faceless Men can only use faces from dead people - in this episode Jaqen is even directly shown removing a face from a corpse. On the other hand, the TV continuity has changed this slightly to show that the Faceless Men can use faces that look like a still-living person. In the Season 5 finale, Arya saw her own face on the Faceless Man who poisoned himself - she

This might simply be different in the TV version - perhaps the explanation is that the Faceless Men can take the faces of people with

    . After the Red Wedding, they give Jeyne to the Boltons to marry to Ramsay to solidify their hold over the North - the Boltons know she is an imposter, but with the Lannisters intend to pass her off as the real Arya. The imposter was first pointed out in the third novel, but her identity wasn't revealed until the fifth novel - as the girl is being sent to the Boltons, Brienne is going to try to rescue her, but Jaime takes her aside and stops her, saying he recognizes that she isn't the real Arya Stark (whom he saw at the Red Keep throughout the first novel). Over the years between novels, the popular fandom nickname "Fake Arya" was developed for this mysterious character, before her real identity was revealed.

       is not

      bisexual, nor does she even experiment with women, and if this is the case in this episode it is an invention of the TV series for Yara, distinct from her book version Asha.

       On the other hand

      , as Martin himself pointed out, several female characters in the novels at least "experimented" with having sex with other women, but this was cut from the TV version:

      </a>
      have sex with her as well. Thus it's possible that making TV-Yara bisexual - or "experimenting" - is the TV series's attempt to make up for cutting out bisexual experiences these other characters had in the novels. That being said, if they were going to make a female character bisexual who wasn't in the novels, Yara/Asha is one of the more probable candidates - given that she
      <i key="b57b379c-87bc-442e-ac16-3b7a7b95f2f2">
       is
      </i>
      very sexually active and adventurous in the novels, to an unusual degree for a highborn woman in their culture, but just with men. This is in contrast with, for example, if the TV series decided to randomly introduce certain other female characters kissing another woman, such as Sansa Stark, Meera Reed, etc. - compared to them, this change isn't such a drastic difference for TV-Yara from book-Asha.

      specified that Yara Greyjoy in the TV version is not strictly attracted to only women, but has been sexually active with both men and women. Thus in modern terms TV-Yara is "bisexual" or "pansexual", and not "a lesbian" (none of these, however, are terms that exist in Westeros).

      Therefore the TV version isn't outright stating that these prior character relationships with specific men didn't happen in TV-Yara's backstory (with Tristifer, Qarl, etc., albeit they were never introduced or mentioned on-screen).

    confirmed that the different subplots are simply being presented out of synch with each other, due to time constraints of individual episodes: Arya spent many weeks or months during her earlier training montage in Braavos, but he said that everything from when she sees the stage play onwards (starting in only episode

    <i key="202fb481-96eb-4e36-a83d-b50be4aa319d">

    Meanwhile, Cogman stated that many days and weeks pass by as Jon and Sansa travel along the west coast of the North from the Mormonts to the Glovers - they didn't mean to imply that the Wall, Bear Island, and Deepwood Motte are all a day or two's journey from each other.

    in a matter of days: weeks and months passed off-screen, because it isn't heavily interlinked with the other storylines. The only direct link with other storylines was that Theon escaped from Winterfell with Sansa but then separated from her group to head back to the Iron Islands - however, they split up very early in the season, apparently only a matter of days after they escaped Winterfell (they couldn't get very far

    one year must have passed between early Season 5 and late Season 6 - Walda's pregnancy ties the timeline into place in such a way that can't simply be left ambiguous.

    Cogman admitted in the interview that the writers didn't attempt to develop an exact internal timeline for episodes, as this would have required a vast amount of work and slowed down the writing schedule - but at the same time, that they generally felt free to leave it ambiguous and assume unspecified amounts of time pass off-screen, so long as the storylines

    related but separated by vast distances (Braavos, the Wall, King's Landing, Meereen, the Dothraki, etc.) In contrast, the Stannis/Bolton/North storyline had merged during Season 5, and they should have been treated as linked chronologically.

     <li key="680d1b55-c713-4c67-a22d-01b6c7f7084f">
      There are two plausible in-universe explanations which might be retroactively developed. The first is that Lyanna Mormont simply has a late birthday in the year, and hasn't turned 11 years old
      <i key="81b9e777-53bf-4639-8db9-f774c0ce2edc">
       yet
      </i>
      - i.e. that she had just turned 10 in early Season 5 but is now "10 years and 11 months old" in this episode. The second in-universe explanation is that the characters simply made a mistake about her age: either she was really 9 years old in Season 5 and Jon was mistaken, or she's really 11 years old in Season 6 and Sansa is mistaken.

     <li key="b399ea44-d284-46be-9ab8-d3815da444d2">
      The out of universe explanation is of course that this was simply a dialogue error in this episode and it should be treated as non-canonical, and that Lyanna really is 11 years old in Season 6.
