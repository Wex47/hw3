   The nobility and ruling class of Westeros display various attitudes towards the smallfolk. These range from outright dismissal and contempt to understanding the inherent importance of these people as human beings. The attitudes of individual nobles have also been known to change over time. In general, however, even those nobles on the more charitable end of the spectrum do not make serious attempts to alter the existing hierarchy, or heavily incorporate the smallfolk into the business of governing. Although rare, those among the nobility who have spent time among the smallfolk and/or do not aspire to hold political power themselves, such as

   to discuss the great expense involved in celebrating Joffrey and Margaery’s wedding. In the course of the conversation, Olenna tacitly acknowledges to Tyrion that the Tyrells have a more pragmatic concern behind their charitable actions towards the smallfolk: unlike Cersei, Olenna and the Tyrells are aware of the difficulties of ruling a population of angry and starving citizens, and she insists that an expensive royal wedding will be a good distraction for the common people.
   While this may appear self-serving of the Tyrells, it could also be said to be basic good governance (i.e. happy people are less likely to rebel), and the smallfolk are getting real benefits from it. While Cersei and Joffrey earned the scorn of the smallfolk for mistreating them, Margaery Tyrell quickly became beloved by the smallfolk for easing their suffering.
