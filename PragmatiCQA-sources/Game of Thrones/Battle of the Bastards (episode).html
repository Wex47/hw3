Ramsay rejects a one-on-one combat with Jon, noting that he doubts he can best Jon in a duel but he is confident his numerically superior forces will triumph in battle. Jon counters that Ramsay's men may not want to fight for him if he will not fight for them. In response, Ramsay threatens

   After a meeting where Jon discusses the battle plan with Tormund and Davos, Sansa admonishes Jon for attacking too early, insisting that they should have gathered more men. Jon retorts that this is the largest army they could possibly gather. Sansa, knowing Ramsay the best, warns Jon of his cunning and cruel nature, but Jon assures her that he has faced worse. In the end, he promises to protect Sansa from Ramsay, to which she cynically replies that no one can keep anyone safe.

   The armies gather the following morning as Ramsay brings out Rickon. After menacingly raising a knife, he cuts Rickon's bonds and tells him that they are to play a game. The only rule is to run towards his brother. As he does so, Ramsay pulls out a bow and nocks an arrow, prompting Jon to urgently ride out on horseback to try to save Rickon as Ramsay fires arrows at him. Ramsay appears to have no intention of hitting Rickon with his first shots but, just as Jon approaches his brother, Rickon is struck in the back with an arrow and killed. Devastated and enraged over his brother's murder, Jon charges at Ramsay and the Bolton forces alone. Davos tells the Stark cavalry to charge. The Bolton archers fire at Jon and strike his horse. With Jon now defenseless in the middle of the battlefield, Ramsay orders the Bolton cavalry to charge at him.
  </p>
  <p key="21184bd6-c374-41f5-977d-cf8583fb3a48">
   As Jon brandishes
   Longclaw
   and prepares to fight to the death, the Stark cavalry smashes into the Boltons, narrowly saving Jon from being trampled. In the rear, Davos belays his order to his archers to release arrows into the melee of infantry, as he announces that they would kill his men, engaged in close-quarter fighting, as well the enemy. He eventually sends the archers forward to be of more use in the middle of the battlefield. Ramsay, however, has no such compunction; he has twice the men to lose and little concern for killing his own. He repeatedly and purposefully orders arrow fusillades that kill all combatants in the middle of the field, apparently in an effort to create a strategic barrier of human death in the center of the battlefield.
  </p>
  <p key="65441032-1b3a-4421-b172-b8d1a63e818f">
   The Stark forces seem unaware of this strategy and developing trap. Bolton soldiers are ordered forward to create an impenetrable horseshoe formation of tall shields and spears (in a phalanx configuration) that surround three sides of the Stark forces against the death mound and progressively compresses them into a helpless and dysfunctional mass. Simultaneously, Smalljon Umber leads a group of soldiers across the mound of corpses to attack the beleaguered Stark infantry from behind and complete the deadly envelopment. While
   Wun Wun
   is able to kill a few Bolton soldiers, it is not enough to break their phalanx. Panic sets in and Tormund, sensing futility, urges his wildlings backward towards the pile and possible escape.
  </p>
  <p key="b3c9b9c3-d8ed-4db5-8c40-f8602023f0e8">
   Amidst all of this, Jon is trampled by his own forces, nearly suffocating under a group of men crawling on top of him, but is eventually able to get back to his feet. At this point, where the Stark forces face imminent destruction, a horn sounds out in the distance as Sansa and

   </a>
   arrive with the Knights of the Vale, waving banners bearing the
   Arryn
   sigil. On horseback, they begin to cut down the Bolton soldiers from behind to disrupt the encirclement. Smalljon, momentarily distracted by the arrival of the Arryn forces, is caught off-guard by Tormund, who bites out his foe's throat and then kills the stricken northman, stabbing him multiple times in the face with a dagger.
  </p>
  <p key="19e4a8b1-eca7-4cff-9c6e-e10f8e5c8606">
   As Ramsay sees his soldiers being cut down, he decides to retreat inside Winterfell, but Jon, Wun Wun, and Tormund begin to give chase. His
   general
   insists the battle is lost but Ramsay assures him they still have Winterfell, and the Stark Army is too weak for a siege (despite the Vale reinforcements). Wun Wun, however, is able to break down Winterfell's gates, allowing wildling archers to pour into the castle; the last vestiges of the Bolton garrison are quickly overwhelmed and slaughtered. The giant is nevertheless overwhelmed by arrows and finally killed by Ramsay's shot. Despite the defeat of his army, he taunts Jon, saying he has reconsidered the option of one-on-one combat. As Jon approaches, Ramsay fires three arrows at him with his bow but Jon blocks them all with a
   Mormont
   shield that he picked up from the ground. Before Ramsay can fire the fourth arrow, Jon gets close enough and smacks the bow out of Ramsay's hands before striking him in the chest with the shield with enough force to send Ramsay down. Before Ramsay can stand up, Jon pounces on him and proceeds to savagely beat him with his fists, while Ramsay uncharacteristically does not attempt to defend himself and fight back, merely grinning maniacally through the beating, convinced Jon won't kill him. The smile is soon wiped off his his face however, as Jon continues brutally pounding the coward again and again, only stopping upon finally noticing Sansa, realizing she has as much right for revenge as he does, and subsequently orders Ramsay locked up as a prisoner.
  </p>
  <p key="57ad8739-b55c-4558-8674-e43d6a7a9ca4">
   The Bolton banners on Winterfell are torn down and the Stark banners are raised in their place. Melisandre looks over the courtyard while Davos glares at her from below, clutching Shireen's burned stag. Jon orders Rickon's body to be buried next to his father in the crypts as Sansa demands of Jon to tell her where he is keeping Ramsay prisoner.
  </p>
  <p key="ebebf825-9fe6-4db4-84fb-a231f390095c">
   That night, Sansa goes to Ramsay's kennels to confront Ramsay, who is lashed to a chair within the common area of the kennels. Ramsay, belligerent and sadistic to the end, goads her by telling her how she will never be rid of him because he is "part of [her] now." Sansa retorts that Ramsay's deeds and names will disappear from future memory. He then realizes that his
   hounds
   are slowly approaching him, Jon having deliberately left the kennel doors open to where Ramsay is bound, still covered in his own blood. At first, Ramsay denies his peril, claiming that his dogs are loyal to him. Sansa coolly reminds him that he had been starving his dogs for a week. As they begin sniffing at him and licking their chops, Ramsay desperately orders them to heel, but they refuse to listen, and as Ramsay's smug overconfidence finally crumbles into panicking terror, the hounds attack and begin to tear him apart as Sansa walks away, smirking with dark satisfaction as the barking of the hounds mingles with Ramsay's screams.

Thus, it appears that in the book version, the slaver alliance is going to be boxed in from four directions: the Unsullied/freedmen/sellsword army coming out of the city, the Dothraki mounted horde coming out of the mountains to the east, Daenerys on her dragon from the sky, and the ironborn fleet arriving from the west. The TV version doesn't mention the arrival of the Greyjoy fleet, they simply appear in the next scene in the throne room having already arrived in the city - it's possible that with all the other battle scenes in this episode there simply wasn't enough budget and time left to show

    In the books, Volantis joined the coalition Yunkai has formed against Daenerys, but so far has not taken an active part in the siege and subsequent battle. A massive fleet, consisting of between 300 - 500 dromonds, is on its way from Volantis to Meereen. The besieged and Victarion Greyjoy know that once the Volantene fleet arrives the Slaver's Bay, Meereen will not stand a chance against them. Therefore, the besieged forces inside Meereen launch an attack against Yunkai's army without delay, not waiting for Daenerys to return, while Victarion uses a dangerous shortcut in order to reach Meereen before the fleet.

      According to the released sample chapters, Daenerys's loyalists and the ironborn seem to have the upper hand in the battle against Yunkai. By the time the Volantene fleet arrives, the battle may be decided in favor of Daenerys's forces - in which case Daenerys may return with her dragon to save both the Unsullied

    Director
    Miguel Sapochnik
    explained that putting the Battle of the Bastards and Battle of Meereen in the same episode meant that they were constantly competing for resources. The Battle of the Bastards was actually more easy to fake on a tight schedule, however, because it used actors - but they can't just have the dragons film without a script, they need to plan out every shot of the dragons when they're created with CGI.

     <li key="4ebc8767-fe9c-4d0f-b02a-024f8b898264">
      Sapochnik tried to film the dragons as realistically as possible, filming their aerial moves like World War II fighter planes, etc. A major visual trick he pushed for was also to keep the dragons slightly "off frame" in most shots: it makes them look more real, as if a nature photographer took quick footage of a fast-moving tiger in the jungle before it disappeared again, and didn't have time to frame the shot utterly perfectly. They're so big and fast it would be hard for a cameraman to keep up with them if they were really there. This is a small camera tweak but Sapochnik feels it makes the dragons feel drastically more real.

     <li key="09875a09-e9bc-4419-9a09-1ef5bb78c1c8">
      On-set, the stand-in for the dragons is just a 14-foot high green pole with a ball on top, so the actors can keep the proper eye-line for where the dragon's head will be added in later digitally. Sapochnik remarked on how amazingly weird it was that, whenever this prop appeared on-set, the hundreds of assembled extras (no matter what country they were filming different segments in) would always get very excited because it meant they were "acting" opposite a dragon for the finished episode - even though they could see that in real life it was literally just a 14 foot high green pole.

The joke is that it's difficult for him to summarize an entire season's worth of subplot that Daenerys wasn't present for in just a few sentences, so when it comes tumbling out of his mouth all at once it seems incredulous at first.

    The other slave-masters say that
    Yezzan zo Qaggaz

    , but the TV version drastically condensed this and basically just re-used the name. It isn't even clear which of the slaver-cities TV-Yezzan is supposed to be from: in the books, he was from Yunkai, but he is only seen at Meereen in Season 5 (though Yunkish slave-masters do
    <i key="a29caa8c-e2cf-4365-8de0-42085518f380">

    . Apparently, the TV version of Yezzan is a low-ranking slave-master who just travels between the three cities buying and selling, not a member of one of the old and powerful aristocratic families who is rooted into one place (as he is in the novels).

      Ironically, while TV-Yezzan is the only one of the slaver leaders to live, the book version of Yezzan actually died before the battle began, when an epidemic of bloody flux (dysentery) swept through the camps of both armies. Tyrion actually thought that despite book-Yezzan being the slave-master who bought him at auction, he was a more or less fair and rational man, and during the later political negotiations he was actually one of the slaver leaders who most strongly urged for a truce instead of risking their own destruction by attacking Daenerys again, or perhaps because he wanted to prevent unnecessary bloodshed.

Theon didn't actually make any insults to Tyrion about being a dwarf on-screen back in Season 1, though given that they were both present during the feast at Winterfell it could plausibly have happened off-screen. But during a sexual encounter, Theon had with the prostitute

    Rhaenyra Targaryen
    , who lived 170 years ago, but her younger half-brother usurped the throne ahead of her (claiming that male heirs always take precedence over female ones), leading to the disastrous civil war known as the

As part of the peace agreement between the two factions at the end of the war, it was ruled that Rhaenyra would retroactively not be included in the official list of monarchs but be considered only a rival claimant (even though Rhaenyra actually sat the Iron Throne for about half a year).

    has taken over the rest of the Iron Islands. This is a little more complicated in the books: the "Iron Fleet" is the national fleet of the Iron Islands, sworn directly to the ruler of all the isles, but each of the major vassal Houses have their own local fleets. The Iron Fleet in the novels, in fact, consists of about 100 ships at any given time, but they are the best ships and crews in the islands - three times the size of their normal raiding ships. When Yara and Theon fled with the ship captains loyal to them earlier this season, it was remarked that they "took our best ships". Thus there are in fact only about 100 ships in the "Iron Fleet" itself (large and elite ships), but "all the fleets in the Iron Islands" number considerably more ships - though they are not considered to be part of

This was therefore taken as a hint at the time that the TV series might be omitting the Greyjoy subplot entirely, as Daenerys already had the same amount of ships. Subsequently it was confirmed that the TV show would, in fact, last through Season 8, not only Season 7, and the Greyjoy Kingsmoot subplot was put back into the TV adaptation for Season 6 - hence why the Meereenese fleet which Daenerys acquired in the TV version only was abruptly burned by the Sons of the Harpy in early Season 5, to make the arrival of the Greyjoy fleet necessary again.

Martin directly confirmed that she actually isn't bisexual in the books, nor has she ever experimented with women - though she is very sexually adventurous with men, unusually for a highborn woman (outside of Dorne or at least in the public), fitting her overall tomboy persona (her father raised her as a surrogate son). Several female characters in the novels, however, actually did experiment with having sex with other women: Cersei had sex with one of her handmaidens in a drunken fog (and didn't really enjoy it) and later with Taena of Myr, while Daenerys herself had sex with her handmaiden

    Sapochnik said that putting battles on the scale of both the Battle of the Bastards and the second Battle of Meereen in the same TV season was also a drain because they were directly competing with each other for resources of budget and time. Actually, Sapochnik said that in some ways the Battle of the Bastards was easier to film, given that live-action actors can just fake their way through a fight scene without a script, while

    Sapochnik said that "The strategy and tactical aspect was a key thing for David and Dan. They wanted to specifically focus on that so that we could really see the way Ramsay ensnares and outguns Jon in almost exactly the same way Davos had planned to defeat the Bolton army. I also did a bunch of research into Alexander the Great who was legendary in his strategic battle prowess."

    The initial draft ideas for the battle actually drew more inspiration from the
    Battle of Agincourt
    in 1415 between the English and French. Apparently, this drew inspirations from the lines in

    in the battle describing how men were crawling over heaps of dead soldiers - as Jon Snow crawls through a human crush in the battle. But Sapochnik said that "as needs changed, as did budgets, it became more like the
    Battle of Cannae
    between the Romans and Hannibal in 216 BC." The showrunners pointed out the Cannae reference in the Inside the Episode featurette for the episode. In that battle, Hannibal's smaller army totally surrounded the slower Roman heavy infantry, until thousands of Roman soldiers were standing in a giant circle literally being crushed into each other, shoulder to shoulder: the men on the edges being killed by enemy spears, while the men in the middle were totally trapped by the great press of the human wall and unable to move. Similarly, when the Stark forces are surrounded by the Bolton shield wall in this episode, they are totally crushed against each other, and Jon has to struggle to fight his way up just to breathe.

      The Romans at Cannae were caught in a classic
      double envelopment
      (also known as "pincer movement"). Jon Snow himself mentions this maneuver by name in the episode, and indeed his plan was similar to Hannibal's: have the center of their line make a feigned retreat to allow their flanks to circle around the enemy's sides (though it became a common goal for tacticians ever since Hannibal). Jon hoped to anger Ramsay enough to attack him head on to lure him into this. As the episode demonstrates, Jon doesn't understand that Ramsay has a great low cunning when it comes to laying traps for other people, and

      Sapochnik said he did heavy research on not only real battles but on depictions in cinematic history. He felt that aerial shots were unrealistic because that isn't how men on the ground experienced them, with chaos and mud on the ground, i.e. how the camera is just over Jon's shoulder level with him as the cavalry approach. Sapochnik said his main cinematic influence was the main battle scene in Akira Kurosawa's

   Sapochick also took the unusual step of insisting that the battle be filmed in

   Afterward, with extending the filming schedule an impossibility, the production team quickly assembled a

    First, the showrunners told him their initial unscripted ideas for the battle, and they asked Sapochnik to give them a ballpark estimate of how many days it would take to film a battle scene on the scale they envisioned. After several hours and guesswork, Sapochnik estimated around 28 days. Benioff and Weiss responded that they had already budgeted only 12 days for it. Most hour-long TV drama episodes only take about 10-12 days to film one entire episode. This was all before they even gave him their finished first draft script - which was even
    <i key="b3131092-6823-4d7b-860b-1f2dc0e4aea4">

    <i key="d194b851-9a5d-47e9-a1df-e049fdf5397d">
     42 days
    </i>
    to film as written. Months later, they settled on 25 days (including the parley scene, and all scenes in Winterfell in the aftermath).

     <li key="babc193e-203a-490e-bcf2-8ea9d1a1104e">
      In the first draft script, the double-envelopment by the Bolton forces would have been carried out by their cavalry, not the subsequent infantry charge. This idea survived to the first draft script, but as working out how to shoot and choreograph the horse double envelopment and keeping the dying horses and men consistent from shot to shot in close combat would have been far too difficult to actually film, they later switched to using the Bolton infantry making a shield wall.
     </li>
     <li key="303d5857-a651-458e-ba12-85dd7b81e762">
      The fields had to be brushed over and reset between every take, so the reset wouldn't be obvious in the final version. Resetting the snow took 25 minutes for every take - when the actual cavalry charge lasted only a tenth that long. This was very limiting and Sapochnik said they actually had to carefully weigh how many cavalry charges they could physically do on each filming day, given how much time they had to budget in for every reset.
     </li>
     <li key="1af249f7-97eb-4770-9914-928bfc019f8b">
      The schedule got so rushed by the end that for the last three days Sapochnik's crew simply filmed without a script (not using the script Benioff and Weiss wrote), after getting their permission via e-mail (they were in Los Angeles at the time). Because Sapochnik filmed in chronological order to enhance the actor's performances, this meant that 3 full days of filming from the climax were cut. Instead of filming the original ending, Sapochnik filmed pick-up shots of Jon and other soldiers crawling through the mud of the rain-soaked field - when Jon is almost buried alive by the stampede of wildlings getting crushed, then pushes his way back out.

Roose even stated they couldn't easily hold the North if every vassal House rebelled against them at the same time. When Smalljon Umber aligned with the Boltons earlier this season, he made it a point

      actually died, or if Smalljon tricked Ramsay by passing off a regular wolf's head as his; even the director of that episode remarked in interviews that he thought the prop direwolf head was unusually small (though he did note that the props department assured him it was "the correct size").

    In 2019, the three days of unfilmed material was revealed by Sapochnik to have involved Jon Snow climbing to the top of the mountain of bodies and observing the carnage in an 'all is lost' moment. It was at that point that a Karstark cavalryman would charge at him, with Jon Snow oblivious until the last possible moment where the giant Wun Wun would break through the wall of bodies and punch the horse and its rider away. Sapochnik also alleges, though his memory is hazier of this, that Ghost and a wolf pack would have then arrived onto the battlefield to turn the Battle in favour of the Starks moments before Littlefinger and Sansa arrived with the Vale army.

      It is not known if Smalljon Umber and Tormund Giantsbane would have engaged in a similar skirmish in these original pages. As all the off-page filming occurred between the event of Smalljon Umber's confrontation with Jon Snow to the arrival of the Vale army (save for one pick-up shot earlier in the battle), it is possible Jon Snow originally killed him. In the final version, both men stare at each other for a few moments before going their separate ways. It would make sense for the Smalljon to have been an obstacle Jon needed to cross before he could gain his better vantage point.

      Sapochnik in particular remarked that getting a horse to charge up a mound, coupled that with the shot of the superimposed CGI giant (in reality Sapochnik himself with a giant pole) breaking  through the mound, would have been impossible to accomplish with the time they had, so he attempted to communicate the key thematic beat of the scripted material - namely despair - through a "more real" scenario. Curiously, Kit Harrington revealed that the idea of being crushed alive was one of his greatest fears, the terror which he then imbued into his performance.

In an interview, actor Iwan Rheon claimed that ever since being cast as Ramsay, he had wanted to shoot a scene with Jon Snow, given that they are both Northern bastards who share similar circumstances (each being the bastard son of a powerful Northern lord) but are very different people (due to their contrasting personalities, character, and treatment they received from their fathers), and have now both risen to powerful political positions (Jon becoming the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, while Ramsay is now the Warden of the North). Despite not sharing scenes until this episode, Kit Harington and Iwan Rheon have been close friends since the series' fourth season. Rheon, along with Alfie Allen (Theon) and Joe Dempsie (

      In the novels, it is hinted numerous times that most of Ramsay's actions and ambitions revolve around his intense jealousy of Jon. One notable point is Ramsay's version of the story of his birth: he believes that Roose Bolton fell in love with a woman and they conceived him together, which is precisely what people claim Ned Stark did and is what led to Jon's conception with Wylla. Ramsay learns that he was conceived in a violent rape and not a beautiful romance. Though Jon and Ramsay have not yet met in the novels, Jon knows of Ramsay's actions and despises him. Jon's hatred for Ramsay grows in the fifth novel,

    The production team was very excited that the "Battle of the Bastards" featured in this episode is the largest on-screen battle they have ever been able to depict, due to a significantly increased budget from HBO over the years - in contrast with how they originally intended to depict the
    Battle of the Green Fork
    on-screen in Season 1, but later found that they simply didn't have the budget at the time so they had to leave its events off-screen. Even the budget for Season 2 averaged about $6 million per episode, and the showrunners infamously had to beg HBO for an additional $2 million to complete the

    sequence that year. While exact budget figures for Season 6 are unclear, it is known that the budget now averaged about $10 million per episode - $100 million for a 10 episode season. Of course, the budget probably wasn't evenly distributed across the whole season, and a considerable amount was spent realizing the Battle of the Bastards.

    Director

    said of filming such a large-scale battle for the TV series: "David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] wanted to do a thing of spectacle, a strategic pitch field battle they hadn't had the resources to do back in season 1 or 2. I was particularly interested in depicting both the horror of war and the role of luck in battle."

      The Battle of the Bastards required 600 crew members to film (from cameramen to props masters to the costumes department), 500 extras, and 65 professional stuntmen (for close-up shots). Four separate camera crews were filming simultaneously.

      Another element that the production team was very happy about is that this is the first battle in the TV series which actually depicts cavalry columns charging on-screen (previously they were only mentioned as occurring off-screen). Using large numbers of
      horses
      to film cavalry charges is very expensive, particularly for TV shows instead of feature films. For filming the Battle of the Bastards, no less than 70 horses were used on-location: they didn't simply use only a dozen horses then digitally double them up seven times over - 70 live horses actually appear on-screen. Another complication is that heavy rains in Northern Ireland made the ground at the filming site too muddy to charge on, so the production team had to lay about 160 tons of gravel over the field to give the horses some traction.

Though Tormund states that he has seen what mounted knights can do, since Stannis and Davos "cut through us like piss through snow", Tormund was actually not present for that phase of the battle and did not witness Stannis defeat the wildlings and arrest Mance, as he had already been injured and taken into custody by the Night's Watch. It is possible that the surviving wildling prisoners told Tormund about what happened. The Battle of the Bastards is the first time Tormund himself faces mounted knights, as there were no horses at Castle Black or Hardhome.

    never actually fights with a sword in the entire battle - he only uses a bow and arrow to toy with his enemies. This is in line with a point from the novels: Ramsay has absolutely no military training, and isn't actually a proficient swordsman. He isn't a coward, and he will brazenly charge at enemies, but he has no formal technique, and cannot hope to compare to a formally trained swordsman like Jon Snow. In the novels, Stannis points out that all Ramsay does is sadistically torture prisoners who cannot possibly fight back against him - he's never actually fought anyone in direct combat.

      This episode marks the first time Ramsay is struck in the series. The first who attempted to fight Ramsay was Theon Greyjoy, who was so weakened from captivity and starvation that Ramsay sent him down with one strike. Jon first smacks the bow and arrow out of Ramsay's hands and strikes him in the chest with his shield with enough force to knock him to the ground. Of note, as Jon gets closer to him, Ramsay becomes more and more uneasy and appears genuinely frightened before raising his bow to fire a fourth arrow, since it is the first time that his actions have actually enraged someone rather than scared them, and he is now facing an opponent who is skilled enough to turn the tables and is not afraid to fight and kill him.

    Director Miguel Sapochnik explained some of the character moments they intended for Jon and Ramsay in the battle: they didn't want to portray Jon beating up Ramsay as a stereotypical "hurray" moment victory, but tragically - Jon beating up Ramsay is supposed to play like an "empty victory" due to the fact that the Starks lost so many men and no matter how much Jon punches Ramsay, it won't bring Rickon back to life. This is one of the reasons they just show Ramsay smiling even as Jon is pummeling him: they felt that if they gave the satisfaction of seeing Ramsay afraid, it would in some ways ignore that Rickon died when this isn't really a happy moment for Jon.

     <li key="3f95a5f4-3e4e-45ed-954b-45a39d175608">
      Sapochnik explained that basically the arc they envisioned for Jon across Season 6 was that he had his faith in humanity shattered by the mutiny and for the Battle of the Bastards to be a climactic rebirth when he rediscovers his desire to live - the literal "rebirth" shot when he crawls out of the pile of dying men.

     <li key="6d23bbbb-1a61-4356-af3d-48f6b005289b">
      At one point, Sapochnik "kind of wanted people to start to feel for Ramsay" when he died, but Benioff and Weiss were clear that there shouldn't be an ounce of sympathy for Ramsay and shot down that suggestion. Sapochnik ultimately agreed that this wasn't a time to be morally ambiguous.

Apparently, he just meant this poetically, some last-ditch attempt at saying she couldn't kill all the pain he caused her (such as the case with Theon Greyjoy, who still appears to have a shred of Reek within him).

    One Easter egg noted by fans is that one of the soldiers in Jon Snow's army is a Baratheon soldier, who was seen in the Season 5 episode "The Dance of Dragons." Although it's unclear at first how this soldier can be with Jon, given the desertion and extinction of Stannis's army, there actually is an in-universe explanation. When Stannis orders Davos to return to the Wall to barter with Jon (in truth an excuse to get rid of Davos so he didn't interfere with Shireen's sacrifice), he tells Davos to take several knights with him as an escort. Thus, those same knights would likely have remained with Davos (since they wouldn't have witnessed Shireen's sacrifice), and simply joined Jon Snow's army with Davos. Therefore, it's entirely plausible that the Baratheon soldier was one of the knights who was escorting Davos.

During the Battle of Castle Black, there were several giants seen using weapons, such as the archer who was able to shoot massive arrows right over the Wall, sending men flying clean off. Furthermore, Wun Wun himself used a club during the Massacre at Hardhome to fight off wights.

    , that leaving Ghost behind was premeditated by Jon: "Obviously a big battle like that is no place for a direwolf. They’re not gonna last very long — I mean look at what happened to Wun Wun, the last of the giants." This is entirely logical: Robb Stark used Grey Wind to harass enemy cavalry or in surprise ambushes (enemy horses were terrified by such a giant wolf), but he never used him against fixed enemy positions in a pitched battle. Also, during the Battle of Castle Black, Ghost was fighting in a chaotic, cramped courtyard, ambushing wildlings as they fought the Night's Watch. Ghost would not have lasted long against sustained Bolton arrow fire from behind a shield wall.

Sansa's earlier concern was contradicted when she later outright sent a messenger-raven to Littlefinger at Moat Cailin. The out-of-universe explanation is that the narrative had to have some reason to send Brienne back to the Riverlands, which is where she was in the novels (she never met Sansa in the books and never went to the North). In-universe, she might have thought there wasn't enough time for a messenger to reach Moat Cailin by horse.

We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both" - yet at the beginning of this episode, she insists that there is no possible way they can save Rickon, because Ramsay knows he can never let a legitimate Stark son escape his grasp. It is unclear at what point Sansa is supposed to have changed her mind about Rickon, but it is entirely possible that she said this about Rickon in the heat of the moment while she was worried about him, and the horrible truth later dawned on her that Rickon, as the last known legitimate son of Ned Stark and greatest threat to Ramsay's claim to the North, was doomed anyway.

      1 - Sansa had no idea if Littlefinger would be able to bring the Vale army to Winterfell in time, and never heard back from him, in which case she didn't tell Jon to wait before charging into the battle while badly outnumbered simply because she had no active control over the arrival of the Vale's army. In which case, Sansa had no real "agency" in achieving the victory at all, it was totally dependent on begging Littlefinger to come and help them - nor did Sansa really "defeat" Ramsay and achieve revenge on him: Jon was going to beat Ramsay to death and
      <i key="7236dec0-8150-4f51-be13-39fb3c53e28d">

     <li key="4d5a12f9-ff16-4a82-b39d-f4afbc819fd5">
      2 - The alternative is that Sansa did know that the Vale's army was coming, was in contact with Littlefinger, and was actively involved in orchestrating the events of the battle - in which case she knowingly sent Jon and his army into a potential deathtrap that resulted in many of them being slaughtered, risking Jon's own life and guaranteeing Rickon's death.
     </li>
     <li key="eaa4b580-e389-4cb1-a8fd-4b45f6b13164">
      The article concludes that there is no possible scenario in which Sansa could both be acting nobly and also actively shaping the events of the battle, "These are not compatible scenarios. Either Sansa planned Littlefinger's late arrival — in which case she's responsible for the carnage and for recovering Winterfell, or she didn't (plan for the Vale to arrive) and gets no credit for the victory. She just got lucky." If Sansa had any information about the arrival of the Vale's army, she could have told Jon to wait but didn't. Alternatively, if she had no control over the arrival of the Vale's forces, she had little impact on the victory and was more a "damsel in distress" who Littlefinger came to save.

    In the season finale, Sansa apologizes to Jon for not telling him about the Knights of the Vale. As stated above, it is speculated that Sansa did not tell Jon about the Knights of the Vale because she was unsure whether or not they'd come to their aid and she did not want to falsely raise Jon's hopes. However, the reason why Sansa did not tell him about the Vale army remains unclear as the show does not provide an in-universe explanation.

      panel for San Diego Comic Con 2016, Sophie Turner was directly asked why Sansa doesn't tell Jon about the Vale army. She bluntly admitted that she had no idea and the writers never told her, and she guessed it was just to set up the last minute rescue of Jon by the Vale army, in order to make it "more dramatically satisfying" to build up the tension. Benioff and Weiss were also on the panel but announced at the beginning that they were too drunk to answer questions and didn't respond to any for the rest of it, nor did they intervene to provide an explanation to help Turner in that moment. There is simply no in-universe reason why "Sansa" the fictional character didn't tell Jon about the Vale army.

Otherwise, whatever promises were made about Sansa being an active political leader and getting revenge on Ramsay for her rape in Season 6, by process of elimination she didn't do anything to result in his army being destroyed and the Starks recapturing Winterfell:
