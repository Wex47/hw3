   , who is elected to lead a force of united tribes and clans.  Despite the bravery and perseverance of the Free Folk, all attempted invasions of the Seven Kingdoms have failed, as those who live north of the Wall lack the weapons, training and organization to defeat their southern counterparts. However, wildlings still launch frequent raids against the northernmost regions.

   . Since the White Walkers did not return for the past eight thousand years, the Night's Watch has mostly shifted its focus to preventing the wildlings from crossing south of the Wall, and sending out patrols into the wilderness to keep track of wildling movements. The shift of focus also reduced the Night's Watch from a band of honorable warriors into largely a penal colony for exiled criminals, disgraced noblemen, and
   bastards
   with no where else to go.

   The Free Folk consist of a wide variety of many fractious tribes and village-dwellers, some reasonably refined, others savage and hostile. Different factions have very different cultures and practices, and may speak different languages. They spend much of their time fighting one another over petty squabbles, aside from the times when they are unified by a

   A major difference between the Free Folk and the feudal society of the Seven Kingdoms is that the Free Folk do not recognize a class of hereditary nobility in their society. They take great pride in their "free" status, and only follow leaders who they choose to lead them. While in certain times the clans will unite behind a "King-Beyond-the-Wall", the title and position are not hereditary, as the Free Folk will follow no man simply because of who his father was. The Free Folk will follow a King-Beyond-the-Wall into battle, but they do not perform ceremonies of submission such as kneeling in front of him or referring to him as "your Grace". They call the people of the feudal Seven Kingdoms "
   Kneelers
   ", because they physically kneel to men who they didn't choose to rule over them. There is no social stratification between high-born lords and low-born

   among the Free Folk.
  </p>
  <p key="902e94b6-6102-4328-b8f7-95fdd6beacae">
   The other side of the coin is that without a central authority, the Free Folk are so "free" that they don't really have established and enforced laws. A man keeps what he can take, and continues to hold what he can defend. This is somewhat more brutal and chaotic than the feudal society of the Seven Kingdoms, but in some respects their society is more politically egalitarian.
  </p>
  <p key="d9e4b5e0-9da9-41d6-bc9c-3611a75ce349">
   Lacking any major political structure, as well as arable land, most of the Free Folk are hunter-gatherers and lag behind the "kneelers" in terms of technology and education. As the concept of smithing is foreign to most Free Folk, steel gained through trade or raiding is coveted north of the Wall. Horses are also rare, and so the wildlings have no cavalry to speak of. Most settlements are relatively small and their structures are simple when compared to those south of the wall.

  <p key="031d59ee-5dd0-4950-a4c3-64eba0c880eb">
   The wildlings do not bury their dead, but burn them. This has nothing to do with religion - it is simply done to prevent the

Loosely speaking they may thus be considered part of the "wildlings", though the inhabitants of the Seven Kingdoms generally use the term to refer to specifically the human clans living beyond the Wall. Of course, this is because until quite recently, those living south of the Wall had thought giants were entirely mythical creatures, and were unaware that they actually existed in the far northern lands beyond the Wall.

   Attitudes towards the Free Folk vary but are mostly negative. The Northmen have a bitter feud with the Free Folk due to being at the forefront of the latter's incursions into the Seven Kingdoms. Other kingdoms south of the Wall share similar derisive sentiments, but to a lesser extent, seeing the Free Folk as a light threat and the Night's Watch as an unnecessary organization where criminals and undesirables are sent to join. The Night's Watch itself holds the most bitter views towards Wildlings. For as centuries passed, the White Walkers, the Night's Watch's true enemies, largely came to be considered myths, and Watch's resources have been directed towards fighting the Free Folk for subsequent generations, forgetting the order's real purpose.

   Mance Rayder and Jon Snow repeatedly said that in the present day there are about 90 different wildlings clans, but each large region has multiple clans in it (i.e. there may be over a dozen clans of "Hornfoots"). While Clapton did say that there are six different large wildling sub-groups in the TV series, she did not list all of them, except to say that the Thenns were one. She also didn't specify if she included the

    , previously led by
    Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg
    ("Mag the Mighty"), now represented by
    Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun
    ("Wun Wun"). Clapton's concept for the giants is that they just continually wrap their bodies with whatever scraps of cloth, fur, or animal bone they can find, haphazardly wrapped in materials almost like a mummy. They are immensely strong, capable of single-handedly breaching fortified gates with their bare hands, though they lack intelligence and communicate with a highly simplified version of the
    Old Tongue
    known as
    Mag Nuk
    , or Great Tongue.

   This actually matches up with Mance's comment that the clans in his army speak seven different languages (counting those who can speak the Common Tongue as the seventh). Linguist
   David J. Peterson
   offered the explanation that when Mance said seven different "languages", this included several variant dialects of
   Old Tongue
   . By chance or design, the numbers match up: the six major different wildling geographical sub-groups defined by the costuming department would also probably have six different sub-dialects of the Old Tongue.

   . At the time of the books, they are unified under a King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, a former member of the Night's Watch who fled the Wall and betrayed the Sworn Brothers. With the Wall grievously under-strength, as the first book begins, there are fears that the wildlings may try to invade and that Lord

  </p>
  <p key="d64d8754-075a-42e8-b5d9-4b7eac3c28c3">
   The wildlings are mostly armed with rather primitive weapons, made of bone, stone, wood and dragonglass (it is unclear whether they know that dragonglass is lethal to the Others). The Thenns work bronze, and raiders like the Weeper carry stolen steel and iron swords looted off corpses.
  </p>
  <p key="6f21cde5-1725-427b-92be-fdeba4df3b07">
   When a wildling man wants a wife (wildling or non-wildling), it is custom that he must kidnap her, while risking severe injury or even death by the woman and her relatives, and the woman must fight back. As a rule, the wildlings do not kidnap married women. Ygritte explains to Jon - who is unaware of this custom - that if the man succeeds, it shows that he is strong, brave and cunning, and this is what wildling women seek in men. If the man turns out to be an abusive husband, the wife can always slit his throat. Because Jon captured Ygritte (albeit, he was unaware of this custom and didn't know Ygritte was a woman when he and Qhorin Halfhand captured the group of wildlings in which she happened to be) and because Jon saved her life, Ygritte and Tormund point out to Jon that he and Ygritte could be considered technically married (according to loose wildling customs, which are not strictly defined "laws"). This stuns Jon, who reveals this was not his intent and his capture of her/saving her life was not for sex.
  </p>
  <p key="e60fdd7e-ac37-41c4-a288-67eac6a5a275">
   The wildlings prefer to kidnap women far from their villages, rather than from their own clan, and it is considered a great sin to marry relatives. The Old Gods of the Forest, worshiped by both the Free Folk and the Northmen, don't have as many formal rules as the Faith of the Seven, but their religion still maintains a few fundamental social prohibitions, one of which forbids
   <a href="Incest.html" key="ea18d57e-636c-479e-a3f9-58a53de5d7b5" title="Incest">
    Incest
   </a>
   . While the wildlings have no knowledge about genetics, they understand that inbreeding may result in weak and sickly children. Thus, what Craster is doing with his daughter-wives is considered an abomination, even by the other wildlings and not remotely acceptable behavior by their own standards.
  </p>
  <p key="f0cd744f-2fd3-412c-9291-026cbb2ec2cf">
   Since the wildlings do not receive any formal education, illiteracy is common among them. When Jon shows Tormund the Bastard Letter, Tormund admits that he cannot read.
  </p>
  <p key="ab951d56-b1d0-4f28-9b34-1ade88075a1d">
   Due to the harsh conditions Beyond the Wall, the wildlings have a high infant mortality rate and believe that naming a baby after birth is an ill-omen. Therefore, they do not give their babies names at all until they have survived to two years of age; they do sometimes give their babies "milk names" in the meantime.
