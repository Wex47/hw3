Jorah approaches Daenerys and removes his helmet to reveal his identity, but Daenerys, who still hasn't forgiven him, orders Jorah to be taken away. Jorah informs her that he has brought a gift, and Tyrion reveals himself, meeting Daenerys face-to-face at last.

Daenerys then orders Jorah removed from the city once more. Jorah, with his Greyscale slowly progressing, returns to the fighting pits where

Just as the fight ends, Jorah throws a spear towards Daenerys, who, believing the spear was meant for her, ducks out of the way. The spear strikes a Son of the Harpy who was sneaking up behind her. Much of the audience reveals themselves to be Sons of the Harpy, proceeding to kill everyone they can. Jorah joins the ensuing battle for Daenerys and tries to help escort her out of the fighting pit, but they eventually end up surrounded and vastly outnumbered. At that moment,

   Back in the Great Pyramid, Tyrion addresses both Jorah and Daario's feelings for Daenerys, understanding how one could love the wrong woman. The three argue about Jorah's betrayal, but they will not make any judgments without Daenerys first. The dragon was seen taking her north and it is agreed that Jorah will join Daario to ride and search for her. Grey Worm, still recovering from his injuries, offers to go with them, as does Tyrion. Daario firmly nixes both ideas: Grey Worm is needed to command the Unsullied in keeping the city under control, while Tyrion is the only one of them to have any political experience. Thus, Daario and Jorah depart together, hoping to find their Queen in the Dothraki Sea.

Jorah scans the city and deduces that Daenerys has been taken to the temple of the dosh khaleen. Daario confronts Jorah on his attraction to Daenerys, stating that his age makes her feeling the same way unlikely. Jorah and Daario leave their weapons outside the city, and Daario notices Jorah's greyscale. Jorah assures Daario that he was not infected.

He explains that he does not know of a cure, or how long the disease takes, but that he will "end things" before he becomes a stone man himself. Jorah then tells Daenerys that Tyrion Lannister was right about him; he loves her and will always love her, and begins to leave. Daenerys stops him, and, rather than dismissing him, tearfully orders Jorah to go and find a cure for his disease, so that he may be by her side when she takes back the Seven Kingdoms.

   Jorah's body is reclaimed after the battle and put onto one of the many funeral pyres held for all those who fell fighting the wights. Daenerys kisses his forehead before joining the crowd assembled to listen to Jon's eulogy, after which Jorah's pyre is set on fire by Daenerys herself. Later, Jon assures Daenerys that Jorah would not have chosen another way to die than being killed protecting his queen. Daenerys recalls that Jorah loved her in a way she could never love him back.

   Jorah is a complex character. He was Daenerys Targaryen's most loyal advisor and a formidable warrior. Jorah had a deep respect, loyalty and love for Daenerys, and has always tried to give her reasonable, practical, and effective advice. While Jorah was a moral person and always tried to be honorable, he had done several dishonorable acts out of love or for his own survival. He sold poachers into slavery to pay for his wife's spending habits, fled Westeros to escape execution, and briefly spied on Daenerys in the hope of receiving a royal pardon, though he stopped spying on her after becoming her advisor. Jorah was Daenerys's most level-headed advisor, at least until the arrival of

  <p key="b008fd53-0100-4a0a-9290-f53db82c8b60">
   Jorah was intelligent, literate, and well traveled, knowing the histories of Essos and speaking several tongues, including Dothraki.
  </p>
  <p key="1497b04b-8b28-4cef-ab06-644c3023ac85">
   His relationship with his father, and likely the rest of his family, wasn't approached until the fifth season. Although he never showed any feelings towards

    Jeor
   </a>
   , once he was given the news about his death, Jorah was visibly shaken and deeply upset, even angrily demanding to know the details of his father's death. This was most likely because he was still feeling guilty about bringing his family shame and never fully reconciling with Jeor.
  </p>
  <p key="a2e2bbb1-fa9f-414d-a9fb-bbfca71314ad">
   Although stoic, short-spoken and sometimes cold, Jorah does have the ability to warm up to people once they earn his respect. At first, he treated Tyrion like a hostage, but later, after the two barely survived the sinking of their boat, he started to trust Tyrion enough to leave him untied and later the two men shared their life stories and freely discussed Daenerys and her claim to the throne, although their newfound trust was shattered when Tyrion convinced Daenerys to exile Jorah from Meereen again (which he did to spare him Daenerys's wrath). However, after reuniting on Dragonstone, their relationship seems to be repaired, as Tyrion gives Jorah the coin that the slaver Yezzan had given him, with the promise to bring it back after returning from the wight hunt beyond the Wall. Both of them recognize each other's value to Daenerys, and Jorah even convinced her to keep Tyrion as her Hand even though he had made costly mistakes while counseling her.

   He was also a skilled warrior, though he does have a honor code, and tries not to kill his opponent if such option was possible. This was shown in the fighting pit, where every other warrior was brutally slaughtering one another, but Jorah came victorious without any loss of life in his hands. This worked in his favor since he was aware that Daenerys was becoming increasingly appalled by the needless violence happening in the pit right before Jorah got into the skirmish. And even after using brute force to harm another person, he did seem to try compensate for his actions, as he did give some money to a knocked out fisherman for his stolen boat. Also, Jorah had an immense tolerance for pain as he managed to stay silent during Sam's procedure to cure him of the greyscale even though the Citadel apprentice was effectively cutting off much of Jorah's skin. Jorah was also able to sustain multiple severe wounds inflicted by the wights during the

  <p key="6a68ad33-c729-4c58-aa59-413958e07d75">
   Although he was initially willing to betray Daenerys's trust in order to return to his home of Bear Island, Jorah fully accepted the consequences of the crime that had led him into exile. He admitted that even though he hated

   for wanting to execute him, the then Warden of the North was in his right as Jorah had violated the laws of Westeros. Even when he returned to Westeros, Jorah did not attempt in any way to restore his former position as head of House Mormont. Instead, he fully recognized his much younger cousin

   as the future of their family, and refused to be given back the family sword
   Longclaw
   by Jon, claiming that his father Jeor's wishes have to be respected. Jorah also recalls to Daenerys that he betrayed her even long after she had forgiven him. This demonstrates how humble Jorah could be and his willingness to accept the consequences of his actions instead of trying to cover up his misdeeds.
