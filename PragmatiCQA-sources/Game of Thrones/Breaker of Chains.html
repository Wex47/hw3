As Tywin and Tommen leave, Jaime enters to see Cersei calling for the death of the accused Tyrion and his wife, Sansa Stark. Jaime sends the septon and septas away so he can be alone with Cersei. He tries to comfort her through his affections. She refuses initially, but Jaime is aggressive. Cersei insists that the sept during a private viewing of their son's corpse is a highly inappropriate place for sex, and asks Jaime to stop, saying "It isn't right, it isn't right..." and Jaime refuses to stop, saying, "I don't care, I don't care...".

As Naharis quickly dispatches the Meereen champion by killing the champion's horse, Dany begins her siege of the city by speaking of freedom to the gathered slaves and then catapulting the broken chains of those she has freed across the city walls, demonstrating her previous successes.

This is perhaps a reference to the fan theory that in the book, Oberyn, unaware of the Tyrells and Littlefinger's plan, attempted to kill Joffrey, by using the scorpion-shaped golden brooch (which could have been coated with poison) he gave Joffrey as a gift; the Tyrells, however, have beaten him to it.

    When asked about memorable moments from filming in Season 4,
    Pedro Pascal
    recounted that during the scene where Tywin interrupts the orgy that Oberyn is having at the brothel, one of the actresses playing one of the prostitutes (he didn't specify which one) wouldn't put her robe on between takes. This has been brought up by other actresses filming past nude scenes: repeatedly disrobing over and over again for multiple takes during an entire day of filming, as if performing a strip-tease for the filming crew each time, can actually be more stressful than just staying naked between takes. What Pascal thought was odd was that this was a long day of filming, and the actress would stay naked even during long breaks, to the point that she later sat around in the green room entirely naked, while playing Words With Friends on her iPhone with David Benioff.

   The TV writers were slow to respond to such massive outcry, and what few statements they did make were very vague, leaving reviewers and critics even more confused and to draw their own conclusions. As the premiere of Season 5 neared, it became obvious that

    the implication that Jaime was raping Cersei was never intended by the writers, not in the script, and purely the result of bad camerawork and bad editing

   did they play it as such. This is confirmed by closer freeze-frame analysis of the footage. Even George R.R. Martin wasn't informed that the scriptwriters ever intended such a massive change.

   It is unknown why HBO did not simply re-edit and re-release the episode as soon as possible,

   in Season 1. Apparently, one of two scenarios occurred: the first is that Benioff and Weiss were embarrassed by the bad editing, and somehow felt it was

   - then they avoided making any further comment on the controversy, just hoping that with the passage of time it would fade from public memory without the need to give a clear answer. The second scenario is that Benioff and Weiss simply became honestly frightened that

   they said in response, i.e. "we never intended it as a rape scene", would be taken out of context and they would be accused of rape denial - in which case, apparently it didn't occur to them that while merely

   an explanation was no longer sufficient, re-editing and re-releasing the episode was still an option. Many critics were outright more upset and bewildered that the episode was not re-edited and re-released, and few if any said that re-editing it would be rape denial.

   this controversy, which would not have happened if they had addressing it immediately as simply a technical error. It is assumed (or at least hoped) that at some point they will re-edit and re-release the scene and episode, just as they would for any other technical error.

   However, in a 2017 interview - David Benioff openly admitted that the scene in question was indeed "non-consensual" when questioned about Ramsay and Sansa's wedding night in Season 5 - thus negating all previous statements to the contrary.

    For sure, because there had been a scene in the previous season with Jaime and Cersei, where it was not quite as violent but was very much a non-consensual sex scene, and there was a massive uproar about that. And this was darker.
