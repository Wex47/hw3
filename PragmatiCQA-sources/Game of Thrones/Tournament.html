   (or

    tourney
   </b>
   ) is a great social event featuring competitive contests of martial skill, often thrown by a noble house to celebrate honor and chivalry or mark some event such as a wedding or
   nameday
   . They also allow a noble house to flaunt their wealth and status, as tournaments are enormously expensive. It can take a smaller house years to pay for one tourney.
  </p>
  <p key="bfd606bd-5336-4eb2-ab4e-192c306a5821">
   There is no set format or length for a tournament, with modest ones lasting perhaps only an afternoon and consisting of a few events, while larger ones may sprawl across a week and feature many different contests and challenges.
  </p>
  <p key="4721dd05-8968-42bc-a89f-72c0ad783fb8">
   A tourney may consist of one or more of the following events:
  </p>
  <ul key="eb56fca7-a181-4818-8cb1-6aa7b293ef46">
   <li key="08583842-baa1-4e46-a042-0f956144403f">
    The jousting lists: mounted knights charge one another with lances, with the aim of dismounting one another. The knight who remains mounted the longest is the winner.
   </li>
   <li key="0628a902-5dc3-4037-b8c2-440d903a97f3">
    The melee: a number of men engage in combat using swords, maces and axes. Opponents have to be knocked over and made to yield.
   </li>
   <li key="ddcfeafe-bb91-42d3-8780-90ecb4315da2">
    Archery: archers compete with one another to show who has the greatest accuracy and consistency.
   </li>
   <li key="2d02615a-b52e-4506-a1aa-7188906dddd9">
    Axe-throwing: similar to the archery contest, but with axes.
   </li>
   <li key="ef0186b2-bc4c-41d1-9f45-49567d269ce4">
    Horse-racing: Unarmored riders compete in a simple horse race around a track.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="5e32137a-b7cb-409c-9d16-f2950051bb13">
   Tournaments also attract large numbers of side-events, including puppet shows, mummer performances and so on. Vast quantities of food and drink are consumed at a tourney, and blacksmiths can find plenty of work repairing damaged armor or buying the armor and weapons of defeated knights.
  </p>
  <p key="8aceaaf2-c340-49a8-acee-416c311e9fdd">
   While tourneys are non-lethal and some safety precautions are taken, accidental deaths or injuries at a tournament are not unusual.

   held a tournament at his army camp, to entertain his new allies and boost the morale of his army. It included no jousting but instead consisted purely melee combat on foot. Renly observed the melee with his new wife and

   Brienne fought with her helmet on, so the crowd would not mock her for being a woman and possibly deny her entry. King Renly then offered to reward Brienne with any gift that it was within his power to grant, to which Brienne requested that she might be named to
   Renly's Kingsguard
   so that she could continue to serve him. Despite a few murmurs from the crowd at the unprecedented decision to appoint a woman to the Kingsguard, Renly agreed and granted her request.
