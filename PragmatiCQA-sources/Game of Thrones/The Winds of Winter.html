In the Sept, the gathered nobles hear the muffled explosions before the fire punches through the floor, burning the High Sparrow down to his bones where he stands, then building to such intensity that the Great Sept shatters and crumbles to rubble, flinging debris far and wide and leveling the city for a mile around.

   Cersei, looking out one of the windows in her room, smiles at the explosion even as the screams of the terrified and dying population shatter the air. Meanwhile, from his own chambers, Tommen stares at the explosion in shock and disbelief. After being informed of the explosion and its casualties, including his beloved wife, Tommen takes his crown off his head, sets it down somewhere and then calmly steps out of the window to his death.

   Still feeling victorious, Cersei pays a visit to
   Septa Unella
   , who has been strapped to a table. Cersei awakens her by pouring a pitcher of wine on her face as she struggles. She prompts Septa Unella to confess that she enjoyed tormenting her during her imprisonment, not for the sake of the gods, but because it felt good. Continuing her mockery, Cersei smugly goes down a list, "confessing" that she committed her crimes, including her incestuous relationship with Jaime, causing
   Robert's death
   , and the massacre of the people in the sept because it all felt good. Finally, Cersei reminds Unella of the promise she made that her face would be the last thing the septa saw before her death, to which Septa Unella stiffly declares that she is not afraid to die. Cersei gleefully assures her that she will not die right away and her torture will last many days and brings in Ser Gregor Clegane, who removes his helmet and begins his work. Walking away and closing the door, Cersei echoes the word "shame" three times, just as Unella did during Cersei's
   Walk of Atonement
   while the Septa screams in horror at her fate at Ser Gregor's hands.

   After Tommen's body is found, Cersei's triumph is greatly diminished. Standing by his covered remains with Qyburn, she insists on seeing her son's face one last time. Qyburn asks Cersei what she wants to do about funeral arrangements, since the Sept of Baelor is obviously no longer an option. She tells him to burn the body and bury the ashes where the Great Sept of Baelor once stood, so that Tommen may rest with his

He places a crown on her head and she sits down on the throne. The crowd of nobles assembled to witness the coronation glare at her with undisguised hatred, aware of what she did in order to gain power, seemingly professing their loyalty only out of fear of Cersei's wrath, but she has eyes only for Jaime, whose expression is stony. Cersei has achieved her ultimate ambition to become Queen of the Seven Kingdoms - or at least, what little of it the Lannisters still control.

Furthermore, she cannot bring her lover to Westeros, as marriage is still her most valuable bargaining chip when considering new alliances. Daario begs her to take him, pointing out that kings have lovers on the side all the time, and queens should be no different, but Daenerys stands firm. Daario realizes that

   When he departs, she goes to see Tyrion, who unsuccessfully tries to console her. Dany thanks him, but admits that she is not upset about Daario; rather, she was frightened that she was able to dismiss someone who loves her so much so easily. Tyrion says that Daario wasn't the first man to love Daenerys, and won't be the last. Dany then turns the topic to Tyrion's rule of Meereen in her absence. After defending his actions, Tyrion says that he gave up on believing in himself or in anyone or anything else, but that he believes in her. Touched, Daenerys gives Tyrion a pin she had made for him: the brooch of the Hand of the Queen. Tyrion, struck with emotion, proceeds to kneel in front of her.

     storylines in the TV series have surpassed the books as of this episode.
    </b>
    The TV series adapted certain subplots out of sync with each other. Thus, while Jon Snow's storyline surpassed the books starting in the Season 6 premiere, other major subplots this season such as the Greyjoy subplot and Tully/Frey subplot were holdovers from other novels. Now even these remaining subplots have caught up. The Slaver's Bay storyline surpassed the novels in the preceding episode.

      subplot in Season 5 was drastically condensed, then outright abandoned at the beginning of Season 6.

      In the first finale, Catelyn confronted Jaime in their army camp after he was taken prisoner, and he was fully embracing his arrogant persona as "the Kingslayer", and dismissing Catelyn's accusations that things like "honor" mean anything in a world as grim as Westeros. Jaime later revealed to Brienne in Season 3 that he actually killed the Mad King for very honorable reasons, but out of pride, he doesn't want to acknowledge that he cares what other people think. In this finale, Walder Frey tries to commiserate with Jaime by saying that they're both "the same" as kingslayers. In contrast to his conversation with Catelyn years before, Jaime is visibly disgusted and ashamed at this, now seeming to think there is such a thing as "honor" in the world (and he doesn't want to be like the honorless Walder Frey).

      The first finale included a scene of Joffrey sitting crowned on the Iron Throne, terrorizing the royal court by having a musician's tongue cut out in front of them, giving them great concern about their new monarch. This episode similarly has newly crowned monarch sitting on the Iron Throne for the first time: Joffrey's mother Cersei, and the crowd in the royal court is similarly terrified by their new monarch and unenthusiastic (as she just blew up the Great Sept in a prior scene). Joffrey did sit on the Iron Throne once in a prior episode to that (when Eddard was captured in the coup) but he also explicitly said that his coronation had not occurred yet; thus the Season 1 finale was still showing the "newly crowned" Joffrey on the Iron Throne for the first time.

In this finale, Bran is once again dealing with his aunt Lyanna and Rhaegar - by having an extended vision-flashback in which he discovers that Lyanna actually died

      More loosely, in the Season 1 finale, Catelyn comforted the distraught Robb (after learning of Eddard's death), who said he wanted to kill all the Lannisters. Catelyn reassured him that first, they had to get his sisters back, and then they would kill all of them. This finale is the first episode in which Sansa is shown as safe and in control at Winterfell again, while Arya - though technically free for years - has not only returned to Westeros but exacted vengeance on their other enemies. Meanwhile, the last of Cersei's three children - Tommen - dies in this episode. Thus, by this episode, it all comes full circle: the Stark girls are "back", while "all" of Cersei's own children are dead.

Previously the official motto was only confirmed by one of the

Despite being Cersei's own brother, Jaime was never directly involved in any of the worst crimes against Arya's family: he was already captured when her father was executed by Joffrey and he had nothing to do with the Red Wedding. Though Jaime was responsible for crippling Bran, something that planted the seeds for the Stark-Lannister conflict, Arya remains unaware of this.

Of course, in-universe Walder is probably getting his facts a little condensed together for the sake of making a wry comment at Jaime.

    Jaime's disgust is palpable when Lord Walder says that they're both the same as

    . This may be shifted around somewhat from a similar incident in the novels, when the Freys at the siege of Riverrun say that the knights who accompanied Lord Piper's son to the Red Wedding were "traitors and rebels". Jaime scorns them by reminding them that the Freys also took up Robb's cause, then betrayed him - and that makes them twice as treacherous as Lord Piper. Jaime enjoys seeing his words make Edwyn Frey's smile fade.

After Stevron's death in the novels, the heir to the Twins is Stevron's elder son Ryman; after Ryman is killed by the Brotherhood, his elder son Edwyn is the heir, but he fears that his younger brother Black Walder will kill him to take his place; the TV show has condensed this even further. No other named legitimate Frey sons or grandsons have been formally introduced on-screen.

      Both of the main participants at the Red Wedding itself, Walder Frey and Roose Bolton, died in ways mirroring how they killed the Starks during their betrayal. Arya slit Walder's throat after serving him food, and at the beginning of the season, Roose's own son Ramsay embraced him and stabbed him in a shot visually paralleling how Roose stabbed and killed Robb Stark.

      In all irony, despite all the men who had been killed at the Red Wedding as well as the deaths of Robb's wife and unborn child, Lady Catelyn swore to Walder Frey that if Robb was spared, she would give herself up as a hostage to ensure the Starks would take no revenge against the Freys and Boltons for their crimes, which would have been plausible since the bulk of the Stark army had been annihilated in one night. Walder refused and had both Robb and Catelyn killed, which led to Arya Stark taking revenge by slitting Walder's throat. With Jon Snow retaking Winterfell and the last scion of House Bolton being fed to his own hounds, it turns out that the Starks ultimately

    by pretending to be a peasant refugee, Tywin Lannister recognized that she wasn't actually a commoner because she didn't talk with a lower-class accent. As Tywin explained, the commoners lack the education of more highly-born people and nobles, so they tend to make grammatical mistakes and compress words together: thus they typically say the slurred "m'lord" instead of clearly pronouncing two separate words "my lord". It is unclear if this was intentional but in this episode, when Arya is wearing her shapeshifter mask to look like a serving girl (and is played by a different actress), she clearly pronounces "my lord" as two separate words when she speaks, the way a highborn does - perhaps a subtle hint early on that the serving girl wasn't what she seemed.

      In the fifth novel, Ser Barristan Selmy tells Daenerys that her father lusted after Joanna Lannister and acted indecently at her bedding. Based on that, there is a fan theory that Aerys slept with Joanna (with or without her consent), and he is the father of Jaime and Cersei, or Tyrion's.

    's remains are stored there - explaining that Aerion died from drinking wildfire in a moment of drunken folly, thinking it would transform him into a dragon (and he was wrong). George R.R.

    Throughout Seasons 5 and 6, characters have used the phrase that "The Crown and the Faith are the twin pillars that hold up the realm" to urge why the Iron Throne needs to remain allied with the Faith of the Seven: if one falls, so will the other. It's not clear if this was an intentional visual cue by the director, but notice that when Cersei watches the destruction of the Great Sept, the camera shot is framed in such a way that she is watching it from between

    . Similarly, the window in Tommen's room is framed by two pillars, when he commits suicide by walking out of it. With the metaphorical pillar of the Faith destroyed, Cersei is dooming the other pillar of the Iron Throne itself: specifically resulting in Tommen's death, but more broadly, shattering her already weak hold on power. One of the reasons Tommen killed himself is that he realized no one would ever support the Lannisters' hold on the Iron Throne again after committing such sacrilege.

Cersei, being aware how rash Loras is, is only too happy to agree, knowing full well that it will be a bloodbath and she hopes he gets killed. Loras's performance in the ensuing battle at Dragonstone leaves many in awe: Aurane Waters tells Cersei that he never saw a braver knight. Towards the end, however, Loras became badly wounded: he was shot by two arrows, a mace blow broke some of his ribs, and then he was trapped under an archway from which the enemy poured boiling oil on him. Loras was horrifically burned over most of his body and not expected to live. On the other hand, by the end of the fifth novel, Loras has stubbornly managed to cling to life - barely - against all odds and all predictions of the maesters, so it is not clear if he will pull through. Ultimately, however, in both the books and TV series, Loras ends up being horrifically burned.

In the book series, there are two examples of widows with no actual blood relation claiming the lordships of their husbands if no other viable heirs exist: Lady Donella Hornwood (born Manderly) claims the lordship of Hornwood after House Hornwood effectively goes extinct in the War of the Five Kings, and Barbrey Dustin (born Ryswell), who has ruled as Lady of Barrowton since her husband Roderick Dustin died in Robert's Rebellion. As with Robert taking the throne through conquest, this presedence only represents a convenient excuse: Cersei simply seized control of the capital city with whatever is left of the Lannister armies, because they happened to

      In effect, with the destruction of the Lannister-Tyrell alliance and resurgence of the North, the Lannisters' zone of control has shrunk back to more or less what it was right after Joffrey first took power, so they're no better off than they were originally (in early Season 2). In fact, they're actually far worse off than they were when the war began: Cersei has

Tyrion presumably knew because the Night's Watch sent out ravens desperately requesting aid against the upcoming battle against Mace Rayder, and he was still a member of the small council at the time (in the brief interval between when Samwell sent the letters in the Season 3 finale and when Tyrion was arrested in episode 4.2). A possible explanation is that the Citadel simply didn't get around to reading reports from far-away Castle Black, because they think its the boring edge of the world - comparable to how even the small council scoffed at and ignored letters they received from the Wall in Season 2.

Of course, as Renly Baratheon pointed out in Season 1, the "line of succession" is often just a legal fiction decided at the point of a sword: Robert Baratheon claimed the Iron Throne on the token pretext that he was Rhaegar's second cousin (his grandmother was a Targaryen), but it was ultimately decided on the battlefield. Given that Jon and Daenerys are currently unaware of their shared heritage, it is possible that they will end up fighting each other for the North before they realize they are related.

      "Wylla" actually was a real person in the novels: Arya later hears from young Edric Dayne that she is a wetnurse serving at his home castle,
      Starfall

      Arthur Dayne
      's ancestral sword
      Dawn
      to his family. Apparently, what really happened was that Eddard took the infant Jon with him to Starfall, then hired Wylla as a wet nurse until the newborn Jon was healthy enough to travel the long distance back to Winterfell. Never good at lying on the spur of the moment, when Eddard was asked by Robert who Jon's mother was, instead of making up a random name he picked the name of someone that was still associated with Jon's infancy.

    In the first novel alone, several different rumors are given about who Jon's mother is, and Ned himself even gives somewhat conflicting accounts about it, hinting early on that he was lying about it. Some said he was the product of an affair Ned had not just with some random servant, but with Lady
    Ashara Dayne
    - sister of Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, others that the mother had been Wylla, a maid in service to Ashara, along with other rumors.

      The TV series actually omitted many of the hints about Jon Snow's parentage which had already existed in the earlier novels, which strongly suggested that Eddard was hiding something about Jon's real parentage. In fact, the fan theory that Jon is really Rhaegar and Lyanna's son originated after the first novel alone was released - then only strengthened over the years as new hints were introduced with each subsequent book. The TV series was faced with a delicate balancing act: give just enough hints since Season 1 about Jon Snow's real parentage to set it up, but without making it too obvious before the revelation. Stray hints in a large novel that is hundreds of pages long are not as obvious as hints given in one hour TV episodes, which is probably why the TV series had to introduce them more sparingly.

    and Lyarra Stark were first cousins once removed (her name was already "Lyarra Stark" before they married).

      Another potential marriage-alliance for political goals by Jon Snow may, of course, be with Daenerys Targaryen herself. Due to Jon Snow actually being the son of Daenerys's eldest brother Rhaegar Targaryen, Daenerys is actually Jon's aunt, even though they are roughly the same age. Nonetheless, the Targaryens were known to practice uncle-niece or aunt-nephew marriages in the past (which aren't quite as incestuous as brother-sister marriages).
      Rhaenyra Targaryen
      married her own uncle,
      Daemon Targaryen

It has yet to be seen, however, if Jon and Daenerys will form an alliance or if they will end up fighting each other for dominion over the North, as Daenerys has repeatedly stated in past seasons that she will not settle for anything other than the

      Sansa and/or Daenerys for political reasons. In view of Jon's personality - he was never a womanizer, and has always been conservative about interaction with the opposite sex (never slept with a whore, rejected Ygritte's advances until was forced to sleep with her, etc.) - it is highly unlikely he will marry his kin - let alone marry more than one woman.

When young Ned enters the chamber to find Lyanna dying after childbirth, the camera makes it a point to show him setting Dawn down against the bed. Dawn is made from the metal found in a fallen star (meteorite), and it was covered in the blood of its master Ser Arthur after Ned finished him off with it - thus, a "bloody star". The TV version of Dawn also has a sunrise etched onto the pommel.

      years, unusually long, and there was a spring season before that. Jon was around 16 years old in Season 1 of the TV series, and Sansa stated to be 13 years old. Therefore, none of the Stark children were old enough to really remember experiencing the previous winter (granted, there are occasional "summer snows" in the North during cold spells, mentioned in the TV show, but nothing compares to a full-on winter).

      Cersei previously mentioned to Littlefinger in Season 5 that they could tell autumn would be ending relatively soon, noting that the weather had started to turn. The length of the years-long seasons in Westeros can be unpredictable, but they can get a general sense when a season is drawing to a close, i.e. cold weather in early November/early December still technically isn't "winter", but people can observe the gradual shift.

    As clarified in the "Inside the Episode" featurette, there is a hint of tension between Jon and Sansa about who will rule the North: Sansa is a trueborn daughter and by the laws of succession in the North, should rank ahead of Jon, an illegitimate son. Moreover, Jon makes it clear that he doesn't even want to rule the North and expects Sansa to be Lady of Winterfell, a position Sansa does inherit as of this episode.
    Their assembled bannermen declare Jon as their new king due to his bravery on the battlefield, fighting alongside his and Sansa's army against the Bolton forces, and because he is the North's best chance against the coming storm.
    Thus, through no intention of his own, Jon ends up ruling the North instead of Sansa, who is a trueborn Stark. However, Sansa nonetheless inherits the position as Lady of Winterfell. Ironically, it was Lyanna Mormont, a
    <i key="2d9d4463-2e54-4307-a46b-37535c59f0e4">

    </i>
    ruler, who first declared Jon to be King in the North, followed by the other lords who declare Jon King in the North. The beginnings of a potential rift between Jon and Sansa is very subtly shown in the scene where Jon is declared king. When Lyanna Mormont states that she knows, "No king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark," Sansa is smiling. This could be because she believes Lyanna is about to declare her, Eddard Stark's trueborn daughter, Queen in the North. However, when Lyanna then says, "I don't care if he's a bastard," Sansa's smile seems to fade, with some viewers speculating this may be because she realizes that Lyanna is referring to
    <i key="274a4fd9-7633-4b3d-bd8a-49a452ab4f03">

    , not her. She smiles again afterward because she is happy for her brother, but the smile fades once more when she sees Littlefinger, who is smirking knowingly due to their earlier meeting where he brought up that Sansa should be the North's future, not Jon.

      According to Sophie Turner, Sansa does not actually care to be Queen in the North, and is more upset that she receives no credit or recognition for her large part in making Jon become King in the North during the meeting in the Great Hall. Sansa is worried that Jon will regard her as the little sister he remembers her as and as a result, will not listen or trust her advice as much. Turner notes that while Jon and Sansa love each other, they have some tension between them, and feels Jon is naive to this. Kit Harrington agrees, saying that Jon has not learned his lesson in accurately gleaning how Sansa truly feels, with Jon asking Sansa to trust

        panel at San Diego Comic Con 2016, Sophie Turner was directly asked during the live Q&amp;A segment why Sansa didn't just tell Jon about the Vale army, i.e. whether it was because she was angry at him and wanted to take credit for it, or because she didn't know if the Vale army would come and didn't want to get his hopes up (or anger him for telling off Littlefinger when she had the chance to accept his offer), etc. Turner looked somewhat embarrassed and then bluntly admitted that she had no idea why, in-universe, Sansa didn't tell Jon. The showrunners never gave her specific instructions about it. She then finished her answer by outright admitting that there really wasn't a reason for it other than to make the "dramatically satisfying" moment when the Vale army shows up in the nick of time to save Jon at the end of the battle. Showrunners Benioff and Weiss actually were present at this panel, a dozen feet away from Turner, but made no attempt to interject their own answer: they showed up to the panel visibly drunk, and when their first turn came to speak they openly admitted that they had done so many vodka shots right before their own panel that they were too intoxicated to talk, and asked the moderator to not direct any more questions to them for the rest of the panel. Thus there is no stated "official" explanation for Sansa's actions.

      It is unclear what exactly Jon is supposed to feel grateful to Sansa for in the TV version. In the books, Sansa helps Littlefinger manipulate the Vale lords to come to the North. In the TV version, Sansa simply didn't do much of anything to influence political events in Season 6. Sansa never manipulated Littlefinger into sending the knights of the Vale: when he first met Sansa again at Mole's Town at the beginning of Season 6, he immediately
      <i key="cca12b13-7b7f-406c-b83b-2b336e3b6434">

      to send the Vale army to attack the Boltons - this wasn't a demand that Sansa exacted from him, nor did she manipulate him in any way (to the point that during the battle, she feared Littlefinger might not come at all). Essentially, all that happened was that Littlefinger offered to send the Vale army against the Boltons, and Sansa accepted - late enough that many of Jon's men were killed before they arrived. If Jon should be thanking anyone it would simply be Littlefinger himself. Out of universe, from cast &amp; crew comments, it doesn't appear that they wanted to depict Sansa as petulant or mistaken - it genuinely seems their intention was for Sansa to play a vital role in bringing the Vale army to the North, and they simply don't seem to realize that in the final cut of Season 6, Sansa was never really shown playing an active role in sending the Vale army against the Boltons.

One of the reasons why she didn't like that Jon was living in Winterfell and being raised alongside her children by Ned was because of the possible threat that he or his possible descendants may potentially pose to her children's own positions in the North or their claim on Winterfell. However, it has since been revealed that Jon is Ned's nephew and not his illegitimate son as Catelyn believed, which would likely have made Catelyn warmer towards the idea of Jon ruling the North.

      A concern is that unlike in the books, Jon knows that Bran didn't die during the fall of Winterfell; Season 4 changed this so that Samwell broke his word to Bran and told Jon that he saw his brother and that he was heading beyond the Wall. As a trueborn Stark son, Bran ranks ahead of both Jon and Sansa in the line of succession. Bran is not mentioned by Jon or Sansa but Jon and Sansa have not received any news of Bran, or whether he is alive, for over two years at this point. When Jon went to search for Bran at Craster's Keep and avenge Jeor Mormont's murder, Jojen convinced Bran not to let Jon find him as Jon would want to protect Bran and bring him safely back south of the Wall. As a result, Jon was unable to find any trace of Bran and both he and Sansa remain unaware of where Bran is or if he is alive.

      Wendel Manderly
      was killed at the Red Wedding - indeed he was shown on-screen being killed with a crossbow bolt - Wendel had no speaking lines, but prominently wore a Manderly sigil pin on his tunic and his name was confirmed in the official credits for the episode. In the novels, Wyman played a much more active role planning to feign submission to the Boltons and then destroy them from within - it was Lord Wyman in the novels who made the "Frey pies" out of three Freys he captured, then served them back to other Freys.

      The northern lords, who hailed Jon as their king, unknowingly fulfilled Robb's wish: in the novels, Jon actually is legitimized and named heir to the King in the North by Robb in a royal decree issued by Robb during the third novel. Robb does this, before he goes to the Twins, because he is childless (due to his wife, Jeyne Westerling, being secretly given contraceptive potions by her mother under the pretense of a fertility potion) and his younger brothers, Bran and Rickon, are believed dead. Robb worries that Tyrion will claim Winterfell through his marriage to Sansa. Thus, Robb decides to legitimize his illegitimate half-brother Jon, and names him as heir in his decree, despite the fact that as a brother of the Night's Watch, Jon couldn't inherit any titles. However, before Jon can be informed of Robb's decision, Robb is murdered at the Twins during the Red Wedding.

Ironically, if he simply admitted that he wanted to seize the Iron Throne, this would scare people less than the fear of not even knowing what he's trying to do (i.e. to achieve revenge or acquire wealth).

Sansa reminds Littlefinger that she is still married to Tyrion. He assures this is not a problem: "The dwarf wed Ned Stark’s daughter, not mine. Be that as it may. This is only a betrothal. The marriage must needs wait until Cersei is done and Sansa’s safely widowed". When the wedding takes place, only then Sansa will reveal her true identity.

      Unlike in the show, Littlefinger does not plan any military campaign, nor does he says a word about the Boltons. His plans will take several years to accomplish; obviously, he does not mean to have Robert Arryn die so soon after his mother's death, for it will look very suspicious to Yohn Royce and other lords of the Vale, who loathe Littlefinger and keep an eye on him. Therefore, it is premature for him to plan any campaigns for the armies of the Vale. At that point in the books, it is unclear who (if at all) currently holds Winterfell.

    The scene of Melisandre's exile from Jon is framed similarly to the scene where Daenerys exiled Ser Jorah after she learned about him spying on her. Both Melisandre and Jorah commit crimes that are later revealed to their leader (Jon, Daenerys), by a reliable but comparatively newer associate (Davos, Ser Barristan). Both Jon and Daenerys ask what the accused has to say in their defense. Both confess to their crime. As a result, instead of killing Melisandre/Jorah, Jon/Daenerys has them exiled, with the threat that they'll be executed if they ever return. Also, it ends with shots of the exiled person leaving and walking into the distance, with the one who has exiled them standing from a high point, watching them leave. This similar framing may be intended to reinforce Jon and Daenerys's positions as rightful leaders and/or as Targaryens.

      The possibility remains that the Umbers were originally going to turn on the Boltons during the Battle of the Bastards in the TV version, but that this was cut when production ran overtime. As Sapochnik explained (see Notes for that episode) three more full days of filming were supposed to occur, but production ran overtime and these scripted scenes had to be abandoned. This may have been simply more action scenes, or they may have been scenes which drastically altered the plot. In the books, the Manderly and Umber armies are grudgingly marching with the Bolton army, but Lord Manderly secretly reveals to Davos that they plan to betray the Boltons, probably at a critical point in the upcoming battle. This would have been poetic justice, because both Roose and Ramsay rose to power in the North by betraying their own allies (both at the Red Wedding and several other battles), so the Manderlys and Umbers would be using the Bolton's own trick against them.

      clues that the TV series was setting this up earlier in the series: first, Roose repeatedly warned Ramsay that his pointless brutality (flaying Lord Cerwyn alive) was going to make all of the Northern vassals hate them so much they'd rebel even against the odds. Second, when Smalljon Umber agrees to unite his army with Ramsay, he makes it a point not to swear any oath of allegiance to him - pointing out that this didn't stop Roose from killing Robb Stark, but possibly a hint that Smalljon planned to turn against the Boltons, without being called an oathbreaker. Third, even in the same episode as the Battle of the Bastards, right before it starts Jon Snow insists to his war counsel that Ramsay's soldiers hate him and only serve him out of fear, and will turn on him the moment it looks like he is losing - ultimately this line had no payoff whatsoever.

      If these fairly prominent hints that the Umbers were originally going to turn on the Bolton (but it was cut due to bad time management) turn out to be true, logically the originally scripted speeches given after the battle in this episode would have been quite different (before the rewrite adding in Lyanna Mormont again). In the books, several Stark vassals decide to rebel against the Boltons despite little hope, because they are so insulted that Ramsay raped Ned Stark's daughter (

Subsequently, the Umbers and Manderlys would probably have given speeches to the effect that they were always loyal to the Starks and would never follow the honorless Ramsay Bolton after he raped Ned Stark's own daughter. In turn, when all of this was cut out so that the Northern vassals ultimately never turn against Ramsay, the accompanying speeches had to be thrown out. In which case, the confirmed last minute change to have Lyanna Mormont give a different speech, criticizing the other Northern leaders for their lack of participation, may have been made in an effort to address that fact that the Umbers and Manderlys never actually help the Starks in the final aired version (losing a

        On the other hand, there is - at present - no direct confirmation that the content of the original speech was going to be different from the aired version, only that the identity of the speaker was changed from Wyman Manderly to Lyanna Mormont - at the least, it indicates that the Manderlys were somehow going to do more in the season in the original scripts.

In his second chapter, he explains this to his daughter and heiress Arianne Martell (also cut from the TV series), and says that he is sending envoys to Slaver's Bay, to bring their heart's desire (this line was given to Ellaria in the TV version).

    </a>
    ) gave a public interview in which he confirmed that his character was not originally supposed to die, and his sudden betrayal and death in the Season 6 premiere appears to have been an outright abandonment of the storyline that the showrunners did not intend when they started it. As Siddig explained, he was already contracted for at least four episodes in Season 6 - in advance, so that he was already paid for all four appearances even though he only ended up in one episode in the final version (a rather substantial amount of money given that he is a famous actor and not a background extra). Siddig also said that when Season 5 finished filming he was given no indication that his character would be killed off in Season 6, yet when filming resumed he received an abrupt and mysterious phone call from Benioff and Weiss claiming that they had "always" intended to kill off Doran in the season premiere (which Siddig instantly recognized as demonstrably a lie given that he had already been paid to appear in four episodes). In the novels, Doran was actually a secret Targaryen loyalist and even started sending envoys to Meereen to announce his support to Daenerys if and when she returns to Westeros. Siddig explained in the interview that this is actually how he

    Doran in Season 5: whenever TV-Doran insisted he wanted peace, Siddig played it as if he was lying and planning to betray the Lannisters, giving shifty looks to his guards, even outright telling Areo to expect bloodshed soon. It is unknown exactly at what point the TV writers decided to make Ellaria Sand the new leader of Dorne, despite having no claim to the title whatsoever, though they admitted in an interview that they greatly enjoyed Indira Varma's performance as a more villainous Ellaria, which may have prompted them to kill off Doran and substitute him for Ellaria to give Varma more screen time and possibly portray Ellaria and the Sand Snakes in far more negative lights than in the novels in order to create new villains for the series (as was done with
    Smalljon Umber
    ), given that the sixth season practically killed off a record number of villains, such as Alliser Thorne, Grand Maester Pycelle, Balon Greyjoy, and most notably Roose Bolton, Ramsay Bolton and Walder Frey, with very few remaining, such as Cersei Lannister, Petyr Baelish and the Night King, and introducing Euron Greyjoy.

The showrunners may have picked up on these criticisms: ultimately Tyene Sand didn't have a

    When the three Sand Snakes actresses first met on-set for Season 5, they actually put a lot of thought and effort into how the character dynamics between the three half-sisters and how they would play off each other:
    Obara
    is the blunt, militaristic one, who prefers to address threats head-on;
    Nymeria
    is the cunning, calculating one, preferring to hold back and assess the situation;

     Tyene
    </a>
    is the youngest and most reckless, who just charges into situations impulsively into situations without thinking them through (much to the consternation of her sisters). Due to how drastically truncated the Dorne subplot ultimately became in Season 5, almost none of these actually managed to come across on-screen (Nymeria, in particular, had hardly any speaking lines in the final versions of their episodes in Season 5). Surprisingly, their short scene in this episode actually managed to briefly work some of these characterization points into what appears on-screen: Obara bluntly states the political situation to Olenna (not inaccurately but insensitively, like a soldier); Olenna gets annoyed at her candor, then Nymeria tries to intervene with more delicately phrased and diplomatic/strategic words. That this characterization finally comes across in this episode is probably helped by the fact that this is literally the first episode in which the Sand Snakes aren't trying to either kill or seduce someone, but are actually having a political conversation.

    Olenna remarks that the last time a Tyrell came to Dorne he was assassinated, with 100 red scorpions. This refers to
    Lyonel Tyrell
    , who has been mentioned before in the animated
    Histories &amp; Lore
    featurettes, and lived about 140 years ago. During the
    Conquest of Dorne
    , the young King
    Daeron I Targaryen
    managed to subdue the Martells through a brilliant military campaign, but this was followed by a bitter Dornish insurgency which costs many thousands more men due to attrition. Daeron I left Lord Lyonel Tyrell behind as governor of occupied Dorne, but the Dornish so hated his rule that one day they laid a trap which dumped over a hundred poisonous scorpions onto his bed, killing him.

      Culturally the Reachmen and Dornishmen have been enemies for centuries, as have the Dornishmen and the Stormlanders'
      Marcher
      lords; their enmity waned slightly when Dorne joined the Seven Kingdoms, but increased again after Willas Tyrell was maimed by Oberyn Martell (Willas never resented Oberyn, though). This resentment is given more focus in the novels, but at the same time, the current generation of Martells hates the Lannisters far more for killing Elia, and both the Tyrells and Martells ironically ended up fighting on the Targaryen side in Robert's Rebellion. It was a simmering cultural resentment but didn't affect their major actions. The TV show removed much of this from when Oberyn Martell appears in King's Landing in Season 4 because due to time limitations they wanted to focus on the far more prominent Martell-Lannister rivalry. Nonetheless, this explains some of Olenna's brusque attitude towards Ellaria and the Sand Snakes: the Dornish have very relaxed attitudes about bastardy but the Reachmen do not, and all of them are bastards. On top of that, in the books, Olenna looked down on Ellaria for being Oberyn's unmarried
      paramour
      , which calling her bluntly and openly "the Serpent's whore". Of course, in the TV version, Olenna is more immediately upset that Ellaria and the Sand Snakes

      In theory, the enmity between the Tyrells and Martells should have been greater than the hatred the Martells feel toward the Lannisters. Tyrion says that in the second novel "

      ". As it turns out, Tyrion was wrong and this was never a major factor in their decisions: in the second novel Varys reports that the Martells even seriously considered declaring for Renly, despite the fact that his main allies were the Tyrells, and it was only the marriage alliance with Princess Myrcella that swung them back to neutrality.

He explains that Kevan and Pycelle were doing too good of a job of undoing the damage which Cersei had caused the Lannister faction - and not only is he removing them, but he will frame their deaths on the Tyrells, further driving a wedge between Cersei and her few potential remaining allies. Varys then has his little birds come in and finish off the wounded Kevan.

      This time around, the Targaryen side has several advantages: the North and the Vale aren't helping the Iron Throne, the Riverlands are in disarray, and the Iron Islands are divided into Euron's dangerous but currently grounded faction and Theon and Yara's Targaryen-aligned faction. This may enable Daenerys to take the Iron Throne, but given that the North is bigger than the remaining six kingdoms combined and it is now allied with the Vale, and both have declared independence, Daenerys may very well find her most powerful enemy yet in Jon Snow.

    Though Dorne now officially supports Daenerys Targaryen, another conflict may very well be coming from Daenerys's allies. Since Tyrion Lannister is Daenerys's Hand, he may not react well when he learns of Myrcella's murder, which he will correctly attribute to Ellaria and the Sand Snakes when he learns of Doran and Trystane's deaths. From Jaime and Cersei's children, Tyrion loved Myrcella and Tommen dearly, and the idea to betroth Myrcella to Trystane and send her to Dorne in order to keep her safe from Stannis Baratheon's attack was entirely his, despite Cersei's insistence that Myrcella would be in as much danger in Dorne as in King's Landing, if not more, due to the Martells' famous hatred for the Lannisters, which only intensified after the death of Oberyn Martell. Myrcella's death will surely plague Tyrion with grief

    Among the fleet there are ships with Dornish flags; this is a little unusual, as Dorne has never been a sea power, ever since Queen Nymeria destroyed 10,000 ships. Even though many years passed, the Dornish have never made any efforts to rebuild a fleet. Of course, in the books Tyrion says that every major House along the coasts keeps at least "a ship or three" as a local force to defend against pirates - their presence in Daenerys's fleet may just be a token sign of support.

    , Daenerys insists that no one put her up to it. In the "Inside the Episode" featurette, however, Benioff says that Tyrion actually did bring this up to Daenerys - but Benioff also stressed that Tyrion didn't "manipulate" Daenerys in any way, and the choice was entirely her own: Tyrion simply pointed out to her a very obvious and logical question of how she would tempt the Great Houses in Westeros with offers of a political marriage-alliance if she brought along her foreign sellsword consort. She realized things with Daario simply wouldn't work out given her future political requirements, and decided on her own to leave him behind in Meereen.

Robb, however, was slain at the Red Wedding before he could attempt this. Given that Casterly Rock will appear in

Then. in Season 5, she shifted to white dresses, to emphasize how removed and above it all she seems from the sectarian violence in Meereen. By the end of this episode, Daenerys is wearing the same cut of dress she wore in Season 5, but now in all black - from the red and black colors of the Targaryen

    The leaders of all four of the Great Houses that make up armies in Daenerys's faction now are women: Daenerys herself for House Targaryen, Yara Greyjoy and her faction of House Greyjoy, Olenna for House Tyrell, and Ellaria Sand for Dorne. Meanwhile, the Lannisters are now also formally led by a woman as Cersei has not only killed her uncle Kevan but openly seized power and declared herself ruling Queen.

    It is unclear how Varys could travel so quickly between Meereen a few episodes ago to Dorne, then from Dorne back to Meereen in this same episode. However, the closing scene implies that some time has passed, and also, the fact that ships with Tyrell and Martell sails are with Daenerys's fleet

    and they are near Westeros's waters in this closing shot (as we don't actually see "Meereen", they are on the open ocean). For all we know, Varys took a Martell ship heading east which rendezvoused with Daenerys's fleet heading west somewhere south of the Free Cities.

      It is unclear why Varys would leave Westeros to rejoin Daenerys when she is headed there anyway - the TV show probably just wanted a large scale closing shot of Daenerys with her full fleet and all her allies, a preview of what's coming next season.

      ", however, the Dothraki that Dany had brought with her became violently seasick, as Dothraki have never sailed or ridden on ships before - they fear and avoid the ocean. Thus, it is surprising that not only are the Dothraki in Daenerys's fleet not seasick, many of them are working as ship hands. One explanation could be that this is another indication that a significant amount of time has passed since they left Mereen by the time of this closing shot, so the Dothraki could have gotten adjusted to the sea by then.

      In the novels, Stannis actually leaves a garrison behind at Dragonstone (as would be logical in virtually any situation) when he sails to the Wall, under the command of Rolland Storm. The castle is later laid siege to by the
      Redwyne fleet
      . However, after the ironborn capture the
      Shield Islands
      and begin to raid the Reach, Loras asks Cersei for the command, as he believes Lord Paxter is taking too long, and wishes to free up the fleet as to defend his home. Cersei agrees, hoping that Loras will die in the battle. The subsequent battle was an unnecessary bloodbath in which Dragonstone was captured, but at a steep cost, with almost a thousand men killed (most of them Lannister loyalists), and Loras Tyrell left gravely wounded.

    ", Tyrion lists the current Great Houses of Westeros that either cannot or will not pledge their allegiance to Daenerys, such as House Stark (Robb Stark may have supported Daenerys, but he was betrayed and killed at the Red Wedding), House Lannister (they betrayed the Mad King), House Baratheon (as Stannis was also claiming the Iron Throne) and House Tyrell (though Tyrion claimed that they might switch sides due to Cersei's schemes against them, but would not be enough). He did not, however, mention Houses Arryn, Martell, and Greyjoy. Of those three, House Arryn, under Petyr Baelish is now allied with House Stark, who are seeking independence from the Iron Throne (though Baelish appears to be scheming to challenge Jon's rule over the North), but the Martell army (headed by the Sands) and a faction of the Greyjoys (under Theon and Yara) have declared for Daenerys, and the Tyrells, now led by Olenna Redwyne, have done exactly what Tyrion once suspected they might do. House Baratheon is now extinct and the Lannisters have lost the bulk of their power due to Cersei's actions.

      The main question is now raised, however, by the Northern forces. House Stark is headed by Jon Snow, who has now been revealed to be the secret son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, making him Daenerys's nephew by blood. Even though Bran Stark, as the son of Lyanna's older brother, Eddard, may have a stronger claim to the North, Jon may very well have the strongest claim so far to the Iron Throne, if he is Rhaegar's legitimate son and not his bastard, given that at the time he was married to Elia Martell of Dorne and had two children with her. For Jon's part, it remains to be seen if he will ally with Daenerys to confront the Night King, or if he will be forced to fight her for the North's independence. Though Daenerys has assembled her army and is setting sail for Westeros, Jon, as both a Stark and a Targaryen, now effectively stands as the last major obstacle in her quest to retake the Seven Kingdoms, as he can either prove to become her most valuable ally, or her greatest enemy yet.
