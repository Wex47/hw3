Aemon points out the impracticality of executing every ranger who lays with a girl and says that "the Wall would be manned by headless men." Thorne says that there is a difference between sneaking off to the

   Jon does not defend himself at this point. Instead, he says that Mance Rayder intends to attack the Night's Watch with his army of 100,000 wildlings and gives intelligence on Mance's plan of attack. Both Thorne and Slynt disbelieve what Jon has to say. Aemon, however, realizes that Jon is speaking the truth, and the hearing ends with Jon being allowed to keep his head, although after Jon leaves, Thorne expresses his distrust for Jon.

   The two eventually come upon a tavern. Both hungry, Arya suggests that they attack the men there, to which the Hound expresses reluctance as there are five men. Just then, two men exit to relieve themselves. Arya recognizes one of them as
   Polliver
   , the
   Lannister
   man-at-arms who had

   Needle
   and killed her friend

   . She also notices that Polliver still has Needle and runs off to get it back. The Hound chases after her, stopping her at the tavern's door, but they are seen and choose to go in anyways.
  </p>
  <p key="93ee2ad6-c619-4591-a8d9-d9e6983ac4be">
   It is clear that Polliver and the other men are making trouble and intend to rape the
   Innkeeper's daughter
   . Arya and the Hound go to a table far away from everyone else, but Polliver still recognizes the Hound and walks over to their table and strikes up a conversation. He does not recognize Arya, who he thinks is just the Hound's latest sexual conquest. Polliver implies that he and his men intend to rape and pillage on their way back to King's Landing and invites the Hound to come along. Polliver says that he and his men wear the King's colors and can do whatever they like, to which the Hound leans forward and states emphatically, "fuck the king."
  </p>
  <p key="9f60f819-01ad-46b2-99a3-4c3e32ae2588">
   The conversation then becomes tense and turns into a standoff. They eventually draw their swords. At first, the Hound fights the five men alone while Arya stands in the corner. He easily dispatches two of them and fights off the rest, stabbing one in the groin. Another, however, gets him on the ground, holding a dagger to his throat. The Hound is able to fight him off, stabbing him repeatedly in the head with his own dagger.
  </p>
  <p key="bd0bd78c-d04c-4ee9-bb65-6518b5cee94c">
   Arya then joins the fray, smashing a pot over the head of one of the men and stabbing him with his own long sword. She then slashes Polliver's leg from behind, causing him to fall to the ground. Arya takes Needle from Polliver and stands over his prone form. She echoes what he had said to Lommy just before he killed him, though Polliver still doesn't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about. Arya then repeats what he had said to her when he took Needle: "Fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it." It is at that point when Polliver recognizes her and becomes frightened. Arya then kills Polliver in the same way he had killed Lommy by driving Needle slowly into his throat. Arya and the Hound then leave the tavern, taking with them a horse for Arya and a chicken the Hound wanted.

Ser Gregor was never punished. In the books, what happened to Elia and her children was fully explained in the first novel. In the aftermath of the Red Wedding (corresponding to the Small Council scene in the Season 3 finale), Tywin is surprised that the Freys killed Catelyn Stark, because he wanted her taken alive.

His paramour Ellaria Sand is a bastard daughter of House Uller (presumably why their banner was also not present). It is unclear why the Allyrions were not present.

    explained that the change from having Oberyn arrive with the embassy in the novels to riding ahead so he is first seen in a brothel wasn't just to build up the tension of his introduction, but self-consciously meant to parallel how Tyrion himself was first introduced in the TV series - "rogue member of the family doesn't show up as expected, finds his way into a brothel": when Tyrion first appeared in "
    <a href="Winter Is Coming.html" key="4140c4ca-5675-4efb-b6cc-4febd3d0b331" title="Winter Is Coming">
     Winter Is Coming
    </a>
    ", he was similarly expected in the royal embassy that arrived at Winterfell, but instead he rode ahead, characters asked where he was, and then the camera first shows him in a brothel. As they leave the brothel, Tyrion even overtly draws the comparison that both he and Oberyn are second sons and considered the black sheep of their respective families.

     The Book of Brothers
    </i>
    recording the famous deeds of all the great Kingsguard was actually meant to feature predominantly in the episode he wrote, "

    </a>
    ", as Jaime was looking through it and talking to Brienne (similar to how it is introduced in the novels, in which Jaime is reading through it and talking to another Kingsguard). Jaime is still seen leafing through it in a few subsequent scenes this season, but the major focus on it was shifted to this episode later in production. As Cogman explained, the writers came to the realization that Joffrey doesn't have any major scenes before his wedding in the next episode, so they wanted to invent something for him to do now in the intervening episode; thus the scene of Jaime discussing the book (apparently with Brienne) was shifted to Joffrey thumbing through the book and remarking on it to Jaime.
   </li>
   <li key="987457c0-559b-4282-b56b-33f6a23b8e62">
    Cogman also said that he was tasked with plotting out the overview for Arya's story arc across Season 4, and in this episode specifically he originally intended for Arya and the Hound's fight to just be against another Frey patrol they stumbled into, ending with Arya stealing one of their horses (as she is tired of riding on the same horse as Sandor). The fight with Polliver was going to happen later in the season. Benioff and Weiss, however, "very wisely" felt that it would make a much stronger season opener if the confrontation happened in this episode, with Arya dramatically killing Polliver, avenging Lommy, and getting her sword Needle back.

    trap was sprung. Following his knighting, Bronn was permitted to claim his own knightly sigil: he chose a flaming green chain on a smoking grey field (green because wildfire burns with green flames) to commemorate the battle in which he earned his knighthood. The TV series condensed the battle so the chain subplot was removed, but it did still have Bronn play a vital role in the wildfire trap, by having him personally fire a flaming arrow which ignited the leaking fire ship filled with thousands of jars of wildfire. As the chain was omitted from the TV series, Bronn's sigil based on that omitted subplot was also removed.

    For the Arya and Sandor scenes at the end of the episode, the chicken pieces were not props but real food, because actors needed to be seen consuming them on-screen.

She said, "I didn't have to buy any dinner that night, I was beaming from ear to ear when I walked back to the car with the box full of chicken."
