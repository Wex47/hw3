    , and "wherever Daenerys is" at the moment. Daenerys's travels far to the east explicitly helped show just how vast their fictional world is, i.e. the Dothraki or Slaver's Bay, that it's bigger than just the continent of Westeros. The Season 7 title just focuses on Westeros itself. Another rule was that they physically only have so much time for the camera to move around, so they can only show a limited number of locations in each (never more than six so far). Moreover, they only make specific title animations for locations which they know will be recurring, to justify the time and expense in creating it (they never made an animation for

    The new
    Costumes
    of many characters in Season 7 have shifted to darker colors. The reason behind this is simple: the costuming department felt that because "winter" has officially descended across Westeros, characters should now be wearing dark colors i.e. the time for wearing brighter colors would have been

    Most remaining storylines reappear in this episode. As the showrunners have noted, so many characters are meeting each other again - after scattering in intervening seasons - that they don't need to compete for as much time or take an episode off, i.e. Tyrion is with Daenerys now. Dorne and Olenna Tyrell do not appear but are mentioned. Yara and Theon, despite being part of Daenerys's faction now, also do not appear, but are mentioned. The Daenerys storyline actually only briefly appears at the end of the episode with hardly any dialogue, as a lead-in to when it will be given focus in the next episode.

    Despite Season 7 shifting to a summer premiere, instead of a spring premiere as in past seasons, it still achieved record high viewership numbers: 16.1 million people, in the first full day after it premiered. According to Nielsen figures, about 10.1 million people watched it live on the HBO TV channel, while the rest watched it over streaming services or on DVR. This surpasses the previous series-high record set by the Season 6 finale, which was watched by 8.89 million people on HBO's TV channel. The

The last time a premiere broke even 1 million was the Season 5 premiere (1.1 million) - the Season 6 premiere was somewhat lower at 0.713 million (perhaps due to various controversial or negatively received parts of Season 5, or even some reviews that announced they would stop watching the show if Jon Snow stayed dead).

    Freys who matter to Walder ("Every Frey that means a damn") - i.e. if there are younger Frey sons that had nothing to do with the Red Wedding she didn't invite them. On top of this, the TV show never established that there were "good" younger Frey sons, i.e. in the books,
    Olyvar Frey
    loyally served Robb Stark as his
    squire
    - so loyally that the lead Freys didn't trust him and sent him away from the Twins (alongside his brother Perwyn and nephew Alesander, for the same reason) before the Red Wedding. Given that the TV show didn't introduce them, it didn't have to expend time explaining how Arya spared the innocent ones.

      It isn't overtly stated how Arya found out which Freys were directly involved in the Red Wedding, and which ones were not involved and innocent. She does say the previous feast when she killed Walder was a fortnight ago, and she was disguised as a servant girl at the Twins for an unspecified amount of time before that: presumably she just asked around and investigated with the other castle servants for a while to figure out which Freys she should kill.

      imply that after old Lord Walder dies, the various internal factions of the family's different branches (by Walder's different wives) are going to turn on each other in a fratricidal bloodbath. This involved over a dozen Frey characters, which the TV show has understandably not introduced.

    's fate. In the Season 6 finale, Lord Walder said he was a prisoner in the Twins' own dungeon, but Arya made no attempt to free him. It's possible that the dungeon was too well guarded. Another possibility is that, in the novels, the Freys later send Edmure away to

    As noted in the King's Landing storyline, the Lannisters are running low on soldiers, after losing so many due to attrition in Joffrey's wars.

    When Arya meets the friendly Lannister conscripts, her dialogue can't express it aloud, but it appears that she was assessing whether she should kill them or not - but then stopped because they act amiably, offering to share their meal with her. The camera pans around from her POV to note that they left all their swords piled up out of reach - indicating that she realizes she could probably kill most of them with
    Needle
    before they can defend themselves. In her overt dialogue, she repeatedly tries to

    their offer to share their meal, because she contemplates killing them, and once she accepts their invitation - she will be forbidden of harming them due to the
    guest right
    (which she respects, in contrast to the Freys). After they repeatedly show her hospitality, hand her a cooked rabbit and outright call her their "guest", however, she visibly relents, realizing she cannot kill friendly people who never did her (or her family, as far as she knows) any ill, just because they serve the Lannisters.

      Sheeran's presence brings up a production issue: most actors aren't also trained musicians and singers, so the TV show has actually cut out several major songs that appear in the novels. For example, the
      wildlings

Given how reluctant actors with no singing experience are to sing on-camera, in several respects the only guaranteed way to incorporate these book-songs into the TV show is to have professional singers make cameo appearances to sing them. Indeed, in similar fashion, in Season 2, the lead Bolton soldier singing

At the time, he rationalized that so many bandits were roaming the countryside from the war that there was no way they'd survive until winter anyway, but it would help Sandor and Arya flee the area.

Some time later in the fourth novel, however, Brienne and Podrick came across a monastery where refugees from the war were seeking shelter, and saw a very large and hooded man with a limp digging graves for the fallen. Their interaction with the Elder Brother heavily implied that the gravedigger was in fact Sandor: the Elder Brother said that he found him near death and nursed him, but it was too late, and the Hound died in his arms. It is unclear whether Sandor actually died, or perhaps the Elder Brother was speaking metaphorically - that Sandor's violent past died, and he found peace at the monastery.

    have equally valid points about how to deal with the families of defeated enemies: whether to show mercy, as the remaining members of the Umbers and Karstark families are innocent of their relatives' crimes - or to take the family's lands from these remaining family members as punishment to prevent future disloyalty.

At the same time, as with Jon's decision, this decision comes with pros and cons: mercy may earn favour with the remaining family members or risk the opportunity that they may seek vengeance later on. This is a major moral question treated in the books and very much left an open question - related to the core questions of the series about the nature of "power" and "loyalty". As in the real-life Wars of the Roses in medieval England which inspired the novels, there are examples of both families offered mercy who became loyal supporters, and families offered mercy who responded with betrayal to get revenge. Sansa isn't acting on blind vengeance, but directly points out that their father

The TV show removed some of the criticisms characters make about Robb in later books, that he was a great military leader but made a lot of bad political choices that got him and all of his men killed. Nor does the episode present this as Sansa harshly criticizing Ned and Robb out of disloyalty - the dialogue she is given stresses that she loved them but they made mistakes that got them killed. These criticisms of Ned and Robb are things that have been fueling debates among the book fandom for nearly twenty years, and are not an invention of the TV series to somehow make Sansa seem disloyal to their memory.

Arnolf joins Stannis's march, but intends to betray him mid-battle, and to force Alys to marry his own son to claim rule through her. Alys learns of their treacherous plans, however, and flees to the Wall to seek the aid of Jon Snow. Jon immediately sends

      In the books, due to the Karstarks being younger cousins of the main Stark line, Alys actually closely resembles Arya. Alys first meets Jon and Robb at Winterfell when they were children. She is said to have a long face and dark hair like Arya. The TV version of the character does portray her with the same long face, but with auburn hair, somewhat like Sansa (even though Sansa's auburn hair is explicitly from her mother Catelyn Tully, and isn't a Stark feature). Thus TV-Alys's physical appearance is a mix of features from both Arya and Sansa, perhaps to greater stress that they are relatives when she shared a scene with Sansa in this episode.

      was mentioned as dying during Season 3 (and Torrhen died on-screen in Season 2). The third Karstark brother wasn't named until Season 6, when "Harald Karstark" appeared. In the books, Harrion is still a Lannister prisoner and it is uncertain if he is alive. Robb believed that Harrion would turn against him due to his father's death, but it is Rickard's greedy uncle Arnolf wants to usurp control by marrying off Alys to his own son. The TV version basically condensed Harrion and Arnolf into one character, "Harald" - Harrion being the third son, and Arnolf the one willing to betray the Starks to fight for the Boltons (and on top of this Harrion traded names with his brother Eddard). Thus while Alys is Harrion/Harald's sister in the books, she is his daughter in the TV series.

Jon assures her that there is no feud between them, as he is sworn to the Watch now and explains that a man must put past allegiances aside when he takes the black. Alys explains that she is seeking Jon's protection as he is a son of Ned Stark and begs him, in his father's name, to help her. Jon shelters Alys and assists her as much as he can.

    Ned Umber
    ". His HBO Viewer's Guide entry states that he is
    Smalljon Umber
    's son and that he is currently ten years old. No character exists by this name in the novels - though "Eddard/Ned" is a common name in the North, in part because many Northern Houses named their children after the Starks out of respect - indeed, the third son of Rickard Stark in the novels was named "Eddard Karstark", not "Harald Karstark" as in the TV show. This isn't a very drastic invention because the Umber family tree actually hasn't been fully set out in the novels: it is vaguely mentioned that
    <a href="Greatjon Umber.html" key="ae4bccee-141a-4fa6-9b55-6b9202f10630" title="Greatjon Umber">

    has multiple sons and multiple daughters, but their names haven't been given except for Smalljon, who is plausibly old enough to have children of his own, it just hasn't been mentioned. The subplots involving Greatjon's uncles Mors and Hother were not introduced in the TV series. Thus there were several unnamed Umbers in the books barely mentioned in passing.

      "Ned Umber" is one of the few characters in the TV series who shares a name with another character. When Martin wrote the

      novels he wanted to write without restrictions such as a rule for TV writing about not re-using first names, but he felt this was unrealistic in a setting like Westeros which spans an entire continent. The TV adaptation, with some validity, argued that this worked in Martin's books but would be too confusing in a TV series again, so it avoided re-using names whenever possible. One of the more prominent examples is that "Robert Arryn" was renamed to "
      <a href="Robin Arryn.html" key="221c8270-a884-48d7-865e-a51b7756f82a" title="Robin Arryn">
       Robin Arryn

      ", even though in the books he's directly named after King Robert Baratheon (though in both versions most people just call him by his nickname "Sweetrobin"). Last season, Lyanna Mormont was one of the first characters to actually break this restriction, given that it is somewhat of a plot point that she is named after Ned's sister

      out of respect. Given that "Ned Umber" is an invented or composite character not from the books, the TV writers didn't have to use the name "Ned" again - it seems they very deliberately broke their own restriction for a second time, to emphasize that the Umbers are still northerners and over a broad historical scale were more often than not loyal followers of Ned and House Stark.

    in the same scene (along with Ned's children Jon and Sansa), visually raises a point that it more fully explained in the novels: the North has taken such heavy losses in the War of the Five Kings by now (particularly the Red Wedding and the betrayals of the Boltons) that multiple Houses are led by younger sons and brothers, and even daughters. Jon's insistence that they need to train everyone from 10 to 60 who can hold a sword, male or female, also touches on this point: the North is running low on adult men of fighting age. The books go into more detail that the new armies scraped up to resist the rule of the Boltons are mostly old men and green boys.

In Sandor Clegane's storyline, he also has a vision of Eastwatch while staring into the flames, saying he sees the eastern end of the Wall at the sea. Eastwatch-by-the-Sea has actually been mentioned since Season 1, and about half a dozen times in various episodes across the past six seasons. As it is at the end of the Wall, it is the main port for the Night's Watch - the actual ships are mostly unmanned and tied up by this generation, but it has a harbor that visiting ships can land at. At the beginning of Season 2, for example, Tyrion took great joy in exiling

If for some unexplained reason they had to abandon their fleet and land on the east coast (from storms, etc.), Jon and the wildlings would still walk back to the Wall on the shortest overland route - which is to Eastwatch, not Castle Black farther west. The simple answer appears to be that the TV writers forgot to account for this when they

    In the Inside the Episode video, Benioff clarifies that Jon isn't exactly wrong for being more concerned about the Night King than Cersei to the south, acknowledging Jon is correct that even when the Lannisters were at full strength it would have been difficult for them to send a full sized army into the North itself (which
    <i key="6bfb9e62-31f7-4270-8dea-175b08dfc6af">

    to harm the Starks. Sansa knows Cersei, knows that she really is petty and crazy enough to strike out at people she feels have slighted her even when it would harm her long term position (i.e. sending assassins, harming the Starks' allies elsewhere, something). Case in point, even

On top of this, Wolkan was visibly terrified of Ramsay, so there is no reason that he wouldn't faithfully serve the Starks as well, or that Jon would see a need to punish him (Jon is well aware that maesters are politically neutral and Wolkan had no choice).

    being attracted to her in Season 6 was an invention of the TV series. It does somewhat match the point that the

    actually respect
    Warrior women
    (who they call
    Spearwives

      he feared fans didn't notice: "I wasn't even sure that when I delivered the episode it was really clear. It was like a fun little bit, but I wasn't sure it was really clear that he had these amorous feelings for Brienne. I'm always amazed what fans pick up." The first time that Tormund gives an impressed look at Brienne when they were in the mess hall at Castle Black was just a brief note in that script, but the production team liked it so much they invented more scenes of it.

    killed the two Kingsguard who were standing outside Renly's tent - and in a red rage, bereaved that they had failed to defend their king (and the love of his life). Afterwards, however, guilt over killing both of them weighed heavily upon Loras (one of the reasons that, in the books, he joined Joffrey's Kingsguard, in part to absolve himself in his own mind). The TV episode didn't actually identify Robar by name, however, and it is unclear if - in the confusion surrounding Renly's death - Lord Yohn is supposed to know that Brienne killed one of his sons (or if that was explicitly supposed to be his son, or if the writers lost track of this).

    A few initial recaps were confused if the main wight-giant that the shot of the army of the dead focuses on is supposed to be
    Wun Wun
    , who died at Winterfell last season because he only has one eye - and that somehow this is a flash-forward to after the White Walkers get south of the Wall. This assuredly can't be true for two reasons: first, the undead giant is missing his

Apart from the missing eye (which actually doesn't match up), part of the confusion may simply be from the fact that multiple giants are played by the same stunt-man,

Neither Meera nor any of Bran's other companions brought a sword with them beyond the Wall - Meera just started using it in the cave against wights without explanation, the tacit assumption being that the Children just scavenged it from somewhere. She never used the sword against a White Walker so if it was, in fact, a Valyrian steel sword, its true nature hasn't been revealed. There is as of yet no confirmation of this, given that the pommel design doesn't match a specific description (it doesn't overtly have a Targaryen sigil on it).

She even threatens Tommen with violence at several points (or rather, threatening to torment his whipping boy) because she wishes he was more like Joffrey, (what she perceived to be) strong willed and decisive. Cersei's claim to the title of Protector is also hypocritical, considering she has proved many times to care nothing about the realm beyond herself; indeed, the wildfire detonation she arranged destroyed a good quarter of the city as well as the Great Sept itself.

    Cersei starts drinking wine again in the middle of the scene. In the books, Cersei starts drinking heavily due to stress from the war, even more so after Joffrey and Tywin die in rapid succession. Her judgment was poor to begin with, but by the fourth novel, she is drunkenly stumbling from one folly to the next. Jaime is disgusted by Cersei's alcoholism (in fact, he is annoyed by

      Cersei insists that she and Jaime (and Tyrion) are the "last Lannisters", but then adds the qualifier "the last ones who count". The Lannisters are a large and wealthy family so there are numerous minor
      cadet branches
      mentioned in the novels, from Tywin and Kevan's younger siblings (cut from the show) and cousins (i.e.
      Stafford Lannister
      and his children). The TV show hasn't introduced them all specifically but has made mention that there are other minor Lannister cousins - such as in Season 4, when Jaime pleaded with Tywin that if Tyrion was executed, Casterly Rock would end up being inherited by a minor cousin he's never even heard of.

      In the books, Euron's exile from the Iron Islands had nothing to do with the unsuccessful rebellion. He was exiled some years later, as a punishment for seducing (perhaps raping) the wife of his brother Victarion, who was cut from the TV show. Victarion killed his wife (and Euron's unborn child) and would have killed Euron too, but Balon forbade him due to the taboo of kinslaying. Instead, the TV version condensed this to have him now explain now that he simply went into exile because the Greyjoy Rebellion was crushed (which would mean that in Season 6, he hadn't been back to the Iron Islands for around 14 years).

    Jade Sea
    east of the Summer Sea, and the

    north of Essos. On the other hand, the real life term "Seven Seas" is just an idiom used by several different societies from the Romans to China to refer to "all" the oceans (seven is a prime number). Different cultures would count different local seas or even bays to make "seven" - i.e. in Medieval Europe at various times the Black Sea, Adriatic Sea, Black Sea, and even the landlocked Caspian Sea were included in the count, but at other times the Atlantic Ocean as a whole was counted as one. The term was never really literal. In this context, for example, TV-Euron might be counting the "
    Sea of Dorne
    " and "
    Sea of Myrth
    ", even though they're bays of the Narrow Sea. Alternatively, it's possible that like "Seven Seas", "Fourteen Seas" is just an idiom, and doesn't even need to refer to fourteen specific bodies of water. The TV writers may have just included it as a vague idiom but changed it from "Seven Seas" because that's an idiom from real life, not Westeros.

The "Iron Fleet" is the "national fleet" of sorts of the Iron Islands, with their best crews and ships, sworn directly to their ruler, but each noble House of the isles has their own local fleets. Yara and Theon actually took "the" Iron Fleet to Meereen (much as their uncle Victarion did in the books, who was cut from the show, but did not steal the fleet - Euron ordered him to do so). The discrepancy simply seems to be that both Euron and Yara consider their own fleets to be the

      Euron brags that the Iron fleet is "the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen". In the books, the Iron fleet is indeed one of three most powerful fleets of Westeros (the other two are the Royal fleet and the
      Redwyne fleet
      ), but not the largest; the Redwyne fleet, which consists of 1,200 ships, is the greatest. The entire ironborn naval forces, including the Iron fleet, are not even half that number. In the show, however, it is not mentioned how big the Redwyne fleet is, thus it is possible that Euron's bragging is true. It's also possible he means "greatest" not in the sense of numbers but most skilled - the ironborn live almost their entire lives at sea, and unlike the other fleets, are unafraid to sail in a straight line across the open ocean for surprise attacks (other fleets hug the coasts, making their movements more predictable).

    " is incorrect: the ironborn have not formed any alliance during the war of Five Kings with the Starks, or with anyone else. Robb offered to make a pact with Balon, but the latter refused. The ironborn indeed performed atrocities in the North, but never pretended to be friends of its people (except Theon, before he changed his mind), which really isn't comparable to what the Freys did. If anything, the ironborn betrayed the Lannisters more than the Starks, because they were nominally sworn to the Iron Throne when they declared their independence; Robb considered it a personal betrayal by Theon, and that Balon was betraying a natural ally in principle, but not in a legal sense. Something similar happened at the end of the first Greyjoy Rebellion: when brought before King

    Euron is dismissive of the ironborn when he talks to Cersei and Jaime, even though he was praising them at the
    Kingsmoot
    last season. This actually isn't a contradiction, as the same basic point happened in the books as well: Euron would praise his ironborn followers to their faces, while in private remarking that he considers them all a bunch of stupid, short-sighted fools, easily swayed by his manipulations, and he's really just using them for his own purposes. Balon fought for the glory of the Iron Islands, Euron really just cares about himself. In some ways this is similar to how Cersei isn't really fighting for "House Lannister" or "the Westerlands", but her own power.

    The brief scene when Cersei and Jaime are on the outer walls of King's Landing, watching Euron's ships sail into the bay, appear to have been filmed on the real-life medieval walls of Dubrovnik, Croatia. It was the major

    for King's Landing in earlier seasons (starting in Season 2), but eventually filming there was scaled back and many exterior scenes shifted to filming in Spain. Production did not, however, abandon filming at Dubrovnik entirely, filming a few brief scenes there such as this one.

Euron wears an eyepatch in the books, though it is unclear what it hides, leading to his nickname "Euron Crow's Eye".

In the books this was Joffrey's personal sigil, which came to be used for his whole faction after King Robert died. With Tommen dead and Cersei simply seizing the throne openly, with no claim based on other families like the Baratheons, she abandoned this heraldry and is now just using the standard Lannister heraldry on banners throughout the city, a gold lion on crimson red. The throne room has also been redecorated so that the ironwork design above the throne has a Lannister lion replace the

    John Bradley-West
    (Samwell), it took 50 to 60 hours to film (including camera setup time), across about five days of the filming schedule. He said the point of the scene was a contrast to how hopeful and happy Sam was to arrive at the great Citadel library in the Season 6 finale - now showing how disillusioned he is, at an entry level position literally cleaning up shit, and not making any progress in his research about the White Walkers. Bradley-West said that he filmed the montage scene instead of going to the 2016 Emmy Awards: given that it was a straightforward scene involving no dialogue or other actors, they felt it was something that could be filmed on its own without supervision by most of the rest of the writing and production staff - i.e. it didn't actually take up writing or acting time that could have been spent on something else.
    The prop chamber pot contents in real life were made from "soaking wet fruitcake".
    The initial rough-cut edit of all the montage footage was seven to eight minutes of raw footage (the rest of the 50-60 hours involves setup time).

   <li key="08944724-7bfa-4b8f-8be3-cd9daeb73a8d">
    It is possible that the montage of Samwell emptying chamber pots was originally meant to be comic relief for the very dark Sandor scenes, in which he is digging a grave for the decayed skeleton of a little girl who died because he robbed her. The showrunners actually confirmed that scenes were reshuffled within the episode at the last minute: they were so impressed with David Bradley's performance as Arya-pretending-to-be-Walder that they moved it to be the new cold open. In the final version, Samwell's Oldtown scenes are split into two major blocks - the comic scene earlier, but the second immediately after Sandor's gravedigging scene. It is possible that as originally envisioned, all of Samwell's scenes were going to be in one long block at the end.

    archmaester
    is the foremost expert in a given field of knowledge, like a university faculty, and Ebrose is indeed the archmaester of medicine and healing - thus it makes sense that he is introduced performing a medical autopsy. His willingness to believe Samwell's stories about the White Walkers, due to weight of evidence, gives his TV version some shades of Archmaester Marwyn - a separate character from the books, considered an oddball by the rest of the Citadel because his field of focus is the "higher mysteries" (

    The scene between Archmaester Ebrose and Samwell raises a point about
    medical knowledge in Westeros
    : the novels apparently indicate that they actually don't have a stigma against performing autopsies on human corpses to further medical and scientific knowledge. The real-life history of
    human dissection
    has gone through cycles in many cultures in which human autopsies were forbidden, such as medieval Christianity and Islam, and before that, the Greco-Romans. Famously, late third century Greek physician
    Galen
    had to dissect macaque apes due to prohibitions at the time on performing autopsies on human cadavers (leading to several misunderstandings). In contrast, when

    men, in agony, to try to learn the secrets of death and necromancy. Thus it seems that they have no prohibitions against autopsies. George R.R. Martin has stated that medical knowledge in Westeros is explicitly better than it was during the real Middle Ages - because he didn't want to have a setting in which characters regularly die from bacterial infections before they're fifty years old, etc. The lack of prohibitions on autopsies may have been a factor in this, or at least, is a way to demonstrate that they have more extensive medical knowledge than the real Middle Ages.

    units of measurement
    used in Westeros. Martin never uses modern metric measurements, to reflect their medieval society, in which measurement systems grew haphazardly out of local custom. They use yards, feet, and miles, not metric meters and kilometers. Other systems haven't been encountered as often: they assuredly don't use kilograms to measure weight. The novels have mentioned the "stone" weight unit, but one stone equals about 14 pounds, so there's no way the "147" organ weight refers to those. In Season 4's "

    . Jon laments that it doesn't really matter, because even if they still had all of them, the White Walkers' armies is so big it won't make a difference, "not unless we have a mountain of it". As the blog post points out, Samwell's line in this episode that Dragonstone is built atop "dragonglass, a mountain of it" mirrors his earlier exchange with Jon.

    made of dragonglass, possibly the largest deposit of dragonglass in the entire world (after the
    Fourteen Fires
    around Valyria exploded). The book page that Sam is reading specifies that this was actually one of the major reasons the Valyrians founded a trading outpost on Dragonstone in the first place - its volcano, and the (now-destroyed) Fourteen Fires were their main sources of dragonglass.

      In the parallel book chapter, both Stannis and Sam consider that information as highly important, and Stannis sends orders to the castellan of Dragonstone to mine the material. Jon is not present at their conversation both in the show and the book, but it seems doubtful that Sam wouldn't have told him such important detail.

      Additionally, Davos was present on Dragonstone with Stannis and would surely know about the dragonglass deposits on the island, so Sam's message to Jon may actually be for naught, assuming Davos tells Jon about Dragonstone or has told him already off-screen.

      It is unclear exactly what important information Samwell will find in the Citadel in the books, but even in the book version he already knows that Dragonstone has a large supply of dragonglass before he leaves the Wall...so it doesn't appear that the information in this episode is meant to be

    Samwell says he's sending a letter "to Jon", but in such a vague context it is unclear if he found out everything that happened to Jon after he left the Wall - i.e. if he thinks he's still Lord Commander or if he heard vague reports that Jon left somehow and became the new King in the North. Either way, the message will still get to someone who needs to see it, as Edd would be reading any of the Lord Commander's correspondence.

    black liquid stone
    into various fantastic shapes. The island is also decorated with numerous dragon-themed statues and gargoyles. Its architectural designs seem very strange and foreign to people from mainland Westeros.

    Dragonstone was Stannis's base of operations seen in Seasons 2 through 4, but several major locations on it weren't actually shown on screen at the time, probably due to budget constraints. Most interior scenes focused on the war planning room around the
    Painted Table
    - a large table painted as a large map of Westeros which

    himself used when he was planning his conquest of Westeros. Exterior shots focused on a generic beach with a large dragon statue in the background as a digital insert. Season 7 depicts all of Dragonstone's exteriors, and several new major internal locations, including a fully realized throne room, hewn from the volcanic rock. Stannis sat on this throne in several scenes from the books that were shifted to the council room. Historically, many prior Targaryens from Aegon I to
    Rhaenyra
    sat on the throne of Dragonstone.

    Starting in Season 7, the interiors and carved gates were built on sound stages, but other exterior shots are
    Filming locations
    in Spain. The place where Daenerys lands on the coast is Zumaia Beach. After ascending a vertical set of stairs up the cliff, the much lower and longer set of stairs from the gates to the castle is actually an entirely real location at San Juan in Spain. The map room was also slightly expanded in Season 7 (so more camera could fit around it to film the larger number of major characters in it). As for the stratified rock formation design with the volcanic island's carved chambers, designed by
    Deborah Riley
    , director
    Jeremy Podeswa
    said: "It's a very new look for the show, I think. It has a fascist architecture feel to it, in a way, but it also integrates elements of the actual location in terms of the striated rocks you see on the beach, which is married into the interiors in a beautiful way."

    calls attention to this, saying that they felt it was such a powerful moment after following Daenerys trying to get to Westeros for the past six years that dialogue would only have gotten in the way of Emilia Clarke's performance: "A bunch of dialogue was completely unnecessary for the weight of that moment."

    The new
    costume
    style that Daenerys shifts to starting in this episode is actually not entirely new to the series - she has switched to the "old Targaryen style" that her brother Viserys was seen wearing back in
    <a href="Game of Thrones Season 1.html" key="943761c7-7dc2-442b-8d22-7ef09ba1a763" title="Game of Thrones Season 1">
     Season 1
    </a>
    (as sort of a sign that she has embraced her inner Targaryen nature as a conqueror). Costume designer
    Michele Clapton
    explained at the time that because Viserys was older than Daenerys when the Targaryens were deposed (he was a child), he still remembers what the fashions at the old Targaryen royal court looked like and dresses in them - thus even though his one costume didn't appear very often, it was meant to be a window into what the old Targaryen style looked like: asymmetric cut, peaked shoulder cuffs that are separate from the undercoat, long form-fitting sleeves, and a high collar. Finally, of course, she has also dramatically shifted from her prior blue or white color palettes to finally dressing in Targaryen red and black, the colors of their heraldry. For more information, see "
    Costumes/King's Landing - Under the Targaryens
    ".

     <li key="a7b6aa85-ea93-4db3-9423-3edc6a85754d">
      Season 7 trailers have revealed other variations on this new style Daenerys is going to wear, including a short red cape asymmetrically pinned to one shoulder - like the one Viserys was seen wearing at her wedding to Drogo in the first episode. Just as Viserys only included the decorative cape on formal occasions, Daenerys may only wear it for more formal occasions as well (she doesn't wear it in this episode, while she's traveling).
     </li>
     <li key="0cdbbd13-fc86-4dc7-94bc-fb21ef8c9d12">
      Viserys had very prominent embellishments on his tunic, chief among which was a very large Targaryen sigil that covered his chest. Clapton said she intentionally put this in to make him seem like a pretentious fool: advertising to the world, "I'm a Targaryen!", as if proclaiming that alone will make him a king. Daenerys, however, isn't a self-important buffoon, so her costume decorations - while still in the same general style - are more subtle, working in smaller dragon details and motifs (which, unlike with Viserys, the camera can only pick up in close-up shots).
     </li>
     <li key="7aea437c-7bff-40c1-804c-ab9211b4ab1d">
      Daenerys does retain one of her trademark fashion choices from Essos, however: she still wears riding breeches under her dress. Clapton said this was one of the few constants in all of Daenerys's costume changes - the idea being that she has been dodging assassins her whole life (sent by King Robert or others) or simply wandering around with her brother like a beggar, to the point that she has an ingrained psychological need to be ready to flee any place at a moment's notice (by quickly getting on a horse and riding away).

This is a drastic condensation by the TV writers that doesn't really make sense: it means that for the past three to two years of story time, the Lannisters simply didn't bother to re-occupy an empty castle, one of the strongest in Westeros, which directly controls sea access to their capital city.

    Given how strong the fortress is even this small garrison was enough to deter a direct attack by the
    Lannisters
    : as a result much of the remaining Lannister/
    Tyrell
    fleet, under the command of Lord Paxter Redwyne, was pinned down encircling and besieging Dragonstone, trying to wait them out through starvation over time; the siege might have lasted at least six months, but it was safer option than an open assault, and there was no reason to take the castle quickly. This prevented the Tyrells from dealing with

    An argument could be made that Stannis recalled his few remaining troops to aid in his Northern Campaign once inclement weather and the departure of many of his sellsword soldiers, though this would only justify the abandonment of the castle and not the inaction of the Lannisters for two years, particularly under the leadership of Kevan Lannister.
