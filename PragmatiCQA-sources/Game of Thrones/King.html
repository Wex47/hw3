    queen consort

   is the wife of the ruling king, and gains the position from marriage. She may marry him before or after he becomes king, though if she marries him before, she only becomes the queen when he becomes king. A queen consort can wield various unofficial powers, given that they usually come from wealthy and influential families. A queen consort's main power comes through her influence on her husband, and she does not rule in her own right.

    queen regnant
   </b>
   is a female monarch who rules in her own right, as the heir of a previous monarch or through conquest. Due to the male-preference
   inheritance system
   in Westeros (and much of the rest of the world), ruling queens are rare - a daughter will usually be skipped over for her younger brother, or even other close male relatives. Unlike a queen consort, a queen regnant possesses the full powers of a monarch, issuing orders directly.

   The title of the husband of a queen regnant is never established in the TV series. In the novels the title varies, Daemon Targaryen was titled as a prince (effectively a prince consort) when married to
