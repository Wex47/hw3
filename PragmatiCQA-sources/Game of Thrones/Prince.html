   , however, has historically operated under a traditional elective monarchy. Even in times when the crown was hereditary, the exact system was often uncertain. Thus there was jockeying for position over who exactly is Balon's heir depending on what system they are using: whether it should be his eldest son (Theon), his eldest child (his daughter Yara), or if his younger brothers should be considered next in line of succession, ahead of his children.

   As claimants to the Iron Islands, neither Euron nor Yara Greyjoy use the title prince or princess, each stylizing themselves as king or queen. It is possible that
   Aeron Greyjoy
   , as the brother of two kings, could be considered a prince, but as a priest of the Drowned God, he has not used that title.

   While the title "Prince" in other parts of the Seven Kingdoms is typically used to indicate the heir to the throne, Dorne has ruling Princes (or ruling Princesses). This is a holdover from centuries ago when the
   Rhoynar
   ruled city-states along the
   Rhoyne
   River in Essos. Dorne had a ruling Prince when it was an independent kingdom, and only unified with the Targaryen realm one century ago; not through conquest but through marriage. As a result of this voluntary union, the Martell rulers of Dorne were allowed to continue to style themselves as "Princes" even though they were no longer the absolute sovereign.
