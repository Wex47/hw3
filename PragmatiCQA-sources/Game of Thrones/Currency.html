In the novels, however, a bid of 5,000 Gold Honors at auction for a pair of slaves sent to the fighting pits is actually thought to be an insultingly low offer. This video is closer to the values as presented in the novels, with Daario saying that a champion gladiator-slave can be worth 300,000 Gold Honors.

Braavos hasn't been said to use copper or silver currency in the novels - in fact their coins are made of iron, and thus apparently not
      commodity money
      (based on the precious metal value of the actual coin in circulation) but
      fiat money
      (worthless per se but for its use as a medium of exchange and, undoubtedly to some extent, the reputation of the issuing Iron Bank). As with the example from Volantis, however, it's not implausible that Braavosi currency has smaller denominations made out of other metals, just like the Westerosi Gold Dragon - alternatively, the brothel patrons might have just been paying her in Westerosi money, given that they were part of an embassy that just came from Westeros (the episode only called them "coppers" and "silvers", not what specific nationality of coins they were).

   The Dothraki do not so much function on the barter system, as they use the honor system: they frown upon "trade" but honor the exchange of gifts, such as tribute. Long ago the Free Cities decided that it was often less destructive to just give the Dothraki massive tributes in gold, finished products, and slaves, than to try to fight them off - though a Dothraki horde might still attack if they find the tribute insufficient, or if they just haven't had a good fight in a while. The Dothraki will not reciprocate these "gifts" on an immediate

   explained that this was a key part of his attempt to make the series more grounded and realistic. Martin is fascinated with how morally "good" men such as U.S. President Jimmy Carter (who even taught Sunday school for children) can nonetheless be "bad" rulers because they are ineffective, either in politics or simply at pragmatic economic concerns - and how men who have privately committed morally "bad" actions can nonetheless be "good" rulers, citing how U.S. President Richard Nixon was embroiled by scandals, but he was also very successful at political negotiations with the People's Republic of China (Martin himself gave this Carter/Nixon comparison).

   The coinage used in the Seven Kingdoms is based on the Gold Dragon, and its various denominations, chief of which are the Silver Stag and Copper Penny. As their names suggest they are made of these precious metals. The Gold Dragon currency system is
   commodity money
   , based on the inherent value of the amount of gold or silver in each coin, as opposed to
   fiat money
   - like modern banknotes - in which currency is assigned a theoretical value but is physically just a medium of exchange (banknote paper currency does not exist in Westeros, or even in Essos, and no world culture has ever been described using paper currency in the novels).
  </p>
  <p key="030a7524-7315-47c7-895f-7e0619f81917">
   That being said, sometimes possession is an abstract concept. Thus someone being paid thousands of Gold Dragon coins will not have to physically carry them around, but will be presented with official financial documents declaring the transaction (much as a knight might find it difficult to carry around on his back a castle he has been granted, but can carry around a sealed charter as proof of the land grant). Still, even large sums used in accounting - ranging into the tens of thousands of Gold Dragons - are supposed to represent physical gold coin reserves.
  </p>
  <p key="bf783ec3-7d2b-421f-90ae-74632ec7e350">
   Reflecting real-life medieval practice, the currency of the Seven Kingdoms is not based on a decimal system, but grew haphazardly out of many centuries of rival coinage systems becoming integrated, so the exchange rate between different denominations reflects tradition and not abstract sense. Each of the original independent "Seven Kingdoms" minted their own money, but the coinage system was unified under the Targaryen dynasty after the

   300 years ago. The Targaryen Kings did not completely "nationalize" the minting of coins, as private mints also exist, but coinage is primarily minted by the kingship and is certainly regulated by it.

   The books contain many more examples of different kinds of coins and the relative price of different purchases. As in the TV series, the baker Arya asks for bread (right before her father is executed and the war begins), he says that a loaf costs three copper pennies. During the

   , along with the loss of food shipments from the Riverlands, which had declared for Robb Stark (the Reach and the Riverlands being the two main breadbasket regions of the realm). The shortages were compounded by the influx of refugees from the Riverlands seeking the safety of the capital city, which overburdened its already strained food supply, eventually leading to

   by the starving peasants. After the Tyrells ally with the Lannisters food shipments from the Reach arrive in the city again (i.e. how Margaery is seen giving out food aid in Season 3). Even after this, however, Tyrion notes that food prices are still shockingly high: six Copper Pennies for a melon, a Silver Stag for a bushel of corn, and a Gold Dragon for a side of beef or six skinny piglets. This was after the Tyrells were returning regular food shipments to the city, so the prices might have been higher beforehand, or they may have continued to rise (to four or five times their normal value) while Tyrion was Hand, so the exact ratio of these prices to their normal pre-war value is unclear.

In contrast, during the War of the Five Kings, Jaime Lannister advises Brienne of Tarth that a single Gold Dragon (210 Silver Stags) is a good offer for a knight's horse. Thus the Gold Dragon apparently underwent significant

   of a years-long summer, when both population and food supply start out very high - during the prequels, both supply and demand are proportionately lower than they are in the main series, and relative prices seem to have adjusted accordingly.
  </p>
  <p key="37b726b7-7b30-4e45-817a-139afbf6c0c4">
   The resulting economic cycles would look something like this:
  </p>
  <ul key="9333dcbd-4141-4c75-8f4c-054651ec5462">
   <li key="e60d7f88-c7fd-4946-aa70-77a7068e6294">
    Winter - Food supply is low. Population starts off high, so food demand is still high, while cost of labor is low, so wages stay low even as food prices drastically increase due to demand exceeding supply.
   </li>
   <li key="d2ae40f5-8862-47b2-ad53-fb60b17012fd">
    Spring - So many people died in winter that population is now low, so cost of labor increases, resulting in higher wages. Food supply initially remains low, but so many people died that demand is also much lower. Initially high demand means that prices are high, but wages are also high, balancing out. Numerical value of products is higher but relative purchasing power is balanced (i.e. a single horse is worth around 3.5 Gold Dragons, but one laborer can make 3.5 Gold Dragons in a year).
   </li>
   <li key="7b5ea0ca-6d2c-43ae-bc85-d76840ba11da">
    Summer - Population gradually increases, causing demand to increase and cost of labor to go down. Food supply also gradually increases, however, and in good summers will exceed demand. Thus wages decrease, but prices also decrease - numerical value of products is lower, but wages are also lower, so relative purchasing power balances out.
   </li>
   <li key="d2fdf046-462d-4618-ae29-07f7006d6dde">
    Autumn - Trends from summer reach maximum: very high food supply, and highest population results in lowest wages and highest demand - which ideally will balance out with the high supply. Numerical value of products reaches their lowest but relative purchasing power is still balanced (i.e. a single horse is now worth 1 Gold Dragon, but one laborer can only make 1 Gold Dragon in a year - fundamentally a single horse still costs "a laborer's wages for one year", as in Spring).
   </li>
   <li key="eb17b0a0-34b4-49a4-96bb-7d78b3b33944">
    Winter - The cycle repeats. Food supply is suddenly low but population is still high. Demand now drastically outpaces supply, sending food prices soaring while wages remain low. Relative purchasing power is now unbalanced: a single horse now costs significantly more than the the amount of wages that a laborer earns in a single year (this is just an example figure: it isn't clear how much a laborer actually makes in a single year in Westeros, in fact a single horse seems to be greater than one year's worth of wages).

   prequels compared to the main novel series. One Gold Dragon is considered a good price for a knight's horse in the main novels, while about three and a half Gold Dragons is considered a good price in Dunk's era. Moreover, at one point Ser Duncan uses a single Silver Stag coin (equal to 56 Copper Pennies) to purchase meals for two people at an inn, and receives a handful of Copper Pennies back as change. Presuming he received about a dozen or so Copper Pennies as change, and that this was to cover the cost of two meals, it seems that the cost of a single meal at an inn was about 20 Copper Pennies during the
   <i key="91373048-cc64-4b53-bd5a-28bc23f790cd">
    Tales of Dunk and Egg
   </i>
   era. In contrast, in the main novels just before Eddard Stark's execution, a baker tells Arya that a loaf of bread will cost her 3 Copper Pennies. If the deflation ratio is consistent, the numerical price of a loaf of bread in Dunk's era would be around 9-10 Copper Pennies - which actually does seem to be consistent with the figure that a full, basic "meal" cost Dunk about twice that much.

   longer than that, an 80 year long golden age of peace and prosperity under the Targaryen kings Jaehaerys I and Viserys I. The civil war began in autumn, after Viserys I died, and winter began in the middle of the conflict. Keeping to the supply and demand trends observed at the end of Robert's reign, it is possible that the number value of prices at the start of the Dance of the Dragons was even lower (i.e. one Gold Dragon might have been enough to buy

   The main takeaways from these figures, in short, are that just before the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings the price of everyday commodities such as a loaf of bread was around three Copper Pennies, and

   In the Seven Kingdoms, there is no particular cultural or religious rule against moneylending. Indeed, the Faith of the Seven has been known to lend money to the kingship. Thus, by the time of King Robert Baratheon, the crown owes a vast amount of accrued debt which was lent to it, mostly by House Lannister, the wealthiest noble landholders on the continent.

   . While there had been some war debts (King's Landing had to be extensively repaired after its sack, etc.), the Mad King had been hoarding gold for so long that such expenses were paid off. Tywin Lannister even remarks that the gross income of the crown has increased to something on the order of

   what it was under the Mad King, due to various improvements in administration and an improving economy during the long summer years. Thus it is all the more shocking to Eddard Stark when he is informed that the crown is 6 million Gold Dragons in debt, highlighting just how much Robert Baratheon was beggaring the realm with his many expensive jousts. Indeed, Tyrion Lannister is skeptical that even Robert's expensive tournaments and overall bad management could have produced such massive debts given the strong gross income levels, leading him to suspect that Littlefinger has been embezzling massive amounts of money from the treasury. The Tourney of the Hand, for example, cost 100,000 Gold Dragons in prize money, and is presented as a very large tournament even by Robert's standards. Robert has been king for 15 years in the novels, and 6 million divided by 15 is 400,000 - meaning that Robert would have to have held a massive tournament on the scale of the Tourney of the Hand

   Kingdom of the Reach

Surprisingly, quite a few Hand coins remain in circulation, even though new ones ceased being minted three hundred years ago. A gold Hand coin is only roughly half the value of a Gold Dragon coin. However, gold Hands are also roughly the same size, weight, and shape as a Gold Dragon, which may lead the unwary to confuse them.
