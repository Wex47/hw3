   Originally a community of shepherds, the Valyrians rose to prominence after discovering
   <a href="Dragon.html" key="3514b199-c2b9-4bbf-b41f-3f9cc4faed15" title="Dragon">
    dragons
   </a>
   in a volcanic area of their home peninsula known as the
   Fourteen Fires
   . After taming the mighty beasts, they established the city of
   Valyria
   and became skilled in both
   magic
   and metallurgy. With these skills, they created a unique metallic compound later known as
   Valyrian steel
   , which could be fashioned into weapons far superior to those produced by other cultures.
  </p>
  <p key="3197d2dd-9698-4572-aa88-7d590ada2edd">
   With their dragons and weapons, the Valyrians conquered the surrounding lands and began their outward expansion. Early on, they came into conflict with the
   Ghiscari Empire
   to the east and the
   Rhoynar
   people to the north and west. The Ghiscari fought five wars against the Valyrian Freehold and were eventually defeated, their
   capital
   destroyed, and their people
   enslaved
   . The Rhoynar fought equally hard against the Valyrians until their cities were razed, many of their people also enslaved, and the survivors scattered.
  </p>
  <p key="ac6f20e4-b3a8-4126-be42-55286e4018e6">
   For nearly five thousand years, Valyrian hegemony was uncontested, until "the Doom" destroyed the capital city and much of the Valyrian peninsula. Not only were most of the dragons wiped out, but the Valyrians' spells, knowledge, and recorded history were also lost.
  </p>
  <p key="434a7985-5bc8-4a95-9687-2762f3b1960a">
   The cause of the Doom remains unknown; some believe it was a massive volcanic eruption from the Fourteen Fires, while others think the Valyrians themselves caused it with their reckless use of magic. In any event, the power of the Valyrians was broken and the ruling
   dragonlords
   dead. Soon afterwards, the Freehold's colonies throughout Essos declared their independence and a period of constant warfare began: the
   Century of Blood
   .

    High Valyrian

   , gave birth to a number of
   dialects
   spoken in many of the Freehold's former colonies, such as the modern-day
   Free Cities
   . Valyrian bloodlines and practices also survived in the Free Cities, but to varying degrees: after four hundred years, the surviving Valyrian colonists in the Free Cities have intermingled with the local populations to such an extent that they no longer exist as a major, distinct group. A few aristocratic families in the Free Cities still retain classic Valyrian features - to greater or lesser extents - and possess light blonde hair and distinctive eyes. People with such features are said to have "the blood of Old Valyria" in their veins.

   A few Valyrian noble families also survived on the island of

    Westeros

    House Targaryen

   House Velaryon
   and House Celtigar, settled on neighboring islands. A few noble families were later founded by their servants, such as
   House Qoherys
   (which went extinct within three generations). On the whole, however, the Targaryens and their few followers had almost no impact upon the ethnic composition of Westeros - particularly because they continued the Valyrian custom of "keeping the bloodline pure" by engaging in incestuous marriages whenever possible, rather than intermingling with local noble families.

   The Valyrians are known for their great beauty and possessed physical features not seen among other peoples of the world (at least not commonly). Typically they possessed silver hair and violet or deep blue eyes, though the Targaryens had lost the latter feature by the time of

   To keep their bloodlines "pure" - by which they retained these features - Valyrian noble families often practiced heavily
   incestuous
   marriages, wedding brother to sister, cousin to cousin, uncle to niece, and aunt to nephew.
   Aegon the Conqueror
   took this a step further and married both of his sisters,
   Visenya
   and
   Rhaenys

Lys was founded directly by Valyria, built from scratch and settled by pure-blooded Valyrian colonists, so Valyrian bloodlines are still very strong there. In Volantis, the ruling aristocracy became obsessed with their identity as the first colony of Valyria, and thus believed that they were the direct heirs of the Valyrian Freehold, destined to reconquer all of the other Free Cities. As a result the Volantene nobility is obsessed with blood purity, and practices extreme (
   -like) separation between the free aristocratic families (with pure Valyrian lineages) and the non-aristocrats and
   slaves
   (though Volantis is not only the most populous of the Free Cities but also has the most disproportionately large ratio of slaves in that population, about five slaves to each free man).

   . The Targaryen family still considered itself "the blood of Old Valyria", but not to be a full "ethnic group" anymore. The Targaryens had such small numbers that their Valyrian bloodlines had a negligible impact on the continent's ethnic makeup. In addition to their initially very small numbers, the Targaryens and their vassals frowned upon intermarriage and continued to try to keep the bloodline as pure as possible by incestuously marrying brother to sister (or at least cousin to cousin), significantly limiting their already small impact on the ethnic makeup of Westeros.
