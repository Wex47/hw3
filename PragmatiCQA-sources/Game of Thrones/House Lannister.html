   It is the day of the wedding of Tyrion and Sansa Stark. During the ceremony, Joffrey cruelly and mockingly takes away the chair Tyrion was to use to cloak Sansa and bring her under his protection, forcing her to kneel. During the feast, he continues to berate the two, threatening to rape Sansa and forcing the newly wed couple to partake in a bedding ceremony, but Tyrion, who is quite drunk much to the disapproval of his father, threatens Joffrey. Tywin and Tyrion cool down the situation, and he walks away with Sansa, returning to their chambers where he informs her that his lord father has commanded him to consummate the marriage. As she undresses, however, he refuses to do so and passes out on a nearby chair. Before she sleeps, Sansa tucks him in. The following morning, Shae notices how Sansa's sheets are not stained with blood and that she is still a virgin.

As the small council disperses, Tywin tells Tyrion to stay behind. Tyrion expresses his disgust over the Red Wedding, and Tywin reveals that he had a hand in it, promising rewards and titles to Walder Frey and Roose Bolton, seeking to protect their family and end the war. Tywin once more commands Tyrion to get Sansa pregnant, but Tyrion refuses to rape her. He then asks his father when he has ever made a decision solely for the benefit of his family to which Tywin replies it was the day he was born: he let Tyrion live because of his name and his status as Tywin's son, despite Tyrion being a dwarf and having killed his beloved
   Joanna Lannister
   when she gave birth to him. Tyrion later finds Sansa in her chambers crying.

Many of these witnesses were previously made enemies of Tyrion during his tenure as acting Hand of the King, including Meryn Trant,

   During the recess, Jaime confronts Tywin, believing that the whole trial is a farce manipulated by Cersei. He strikes a deal with his father: he will leave the Kingsguard and assume his place at Casterly Rock if Tywin lets Tyrion live. Tywin agrees, promising to send Tyrion to join the

   Jaime confronts Tyrion in his cell. He tells Tyrion that he is unable to fight for him in his trial, so Tyrion asks that he send for Bronn. Before leaving, he tells Tyrion that Cersei plans on naming Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain, as her champion. Later, Bronn comes to visit Tyrion, who is surprised to find Bronn in more noble clothing. Bronn tells Tyrion that he is to wed
   Lollys Stokeworth
   . Bronn refuses to fight for Tyrion, believing that the Mountain would defeat and kill him. However, he wishes Tyrion good luck. Finally, Oberyn visits Tyrion and tells him the story of how they first met: when Tyrion had been born, their father took him and his sister, Elia, to Casterly Rock, where Cersei expressed her anger over her new baby brother due to the death of their mother,
   Joanna Lannister
   , and her hope for his death, which wounds Tyrion. Oberyn then declares his intentions to Tyrion once more to get justice for the death of his sister at the hands of the Mountain, and tells Tyrion that he will be his champion.

   It is the day of the
   trial by combat of Tyrion
   . Jaime visits his younger brother in his cell, bringing him wine, and the two discuss their simple cousin
   Orson Lannister
   . Tyrion ponders why Orson loved smashing beetles, expressing his dismay that so many innocent beetles had been smashed to death and returned to the dirt. However, the two are unable to come to a conclusion as to why Orson did it. When the bells ring, an emotional Jaime leaves, but not before wishing Tyrion good luck. Tyrion is escorted to the arena, where he finds Oberyn and Ellaria Sand, the former of which is wearing light armor, no helmet, and is drinking wine while his squire,
   Daemon Sand
   , polishes Oberyn's spear; secretly, he is outfitting the spear with
   manticore
   venom
   . As Oberyn walks out into the arena, Ellaria grabs him, telling him not to die, to which Oberyn replies that he won't.

As he walks around the Mountain's body demanding that he admit who gave him the order to kill his sister, niece, and nephew, all the while pointing at Tywin, the Mountain suddenly knocks the Red Viper to the ground. He punches him, knocking out his teeth, and climbs on top of him, where he puts his fingers through Oberyn's eye sockets and confesses to Elia's rape and murder as well as the murder of her children. He then tells Oberyn how he did it: by crushing her skull, and does the same to Oberyn. The crowd is shocked while Ellaria screams in horror. Jaime and Tyrion look on with disappointing and nervous looks while Cersei smirks. Tywin then stands and proclaims that Tyrion is sentenced to death.

Pycelle notes how the poison used is manticore venom and that he cannot be saved, by Qyburn says there is a way that no maester is aware of. Pycelle states that Qyburn is arrogant and dangerous, but Cersei instead dismisses Pycelle, giving the laboratory to Qyburn. Qyburn warns Cersei that the process may change the Mountain somewhat but will certainly not weaken him. Later, Cersei meets with her father, again telling Tywin that she does not wish to marry Ser

   The night before Tyrion's trial, Jaime has the guards knocked out and frees his little brother, telling him that he is working with Varys, who has secured a galley in the harbor. The two embrace before Jaime departs, but Tyrion first takes another path: he sneaks into the
   Tower of the Hand
   , where he finds Shae in his father's bed. She grabs a knife, but Tyrion rushes onto the bed and chokes his lover to death, weeping and apologizing afterwards. He then stares at Joffrey's crossbow on the wall, taking it and finding his father on the privy. Tyrion confronts Tywin over wanting him dead all his life, and Tywin admits to it, but states that he would never let Ilyn Payne take his head because of his Lannister name. Tyrion tells his father that he loved Shae and has just murdered her, much to Tywin's surprise, but he simply passes her off as a whore. When Tywin insists that they return to his chambers, Tyrion says that he cannot: Shae is still in there. Tywin asks mockingly if his son is afraid of a dead whore, triggering Tyrion to fire an arrow into his father's chest. Tywin, in complete shock, declares that Tyrion is no son of his, to which Tyrion replies that he has always been his son before firing another arrow into his father's heart, killing him. Tyrion then goes to Varys, who suspects that Tyrion has done something. Varys places him into a crate with food, and the crate is placed no the galley. He initially walks towards the Red Keep, but when the bells begin to ring, he instead returns to the galley and sits by Tyrion's crate.

The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape; though Brienne implores him to join them to help Sansa take back Winterfell, he refuses to leave his home. Meanwhile, the Lannister and Frey soldiers walk into the castle and secure it, arresting the Tully troops. A Lannister soldier later reports to Ser Jaime that the Blackfish died fighting, which saddens Jaime. Jaime later watches as Brienne and Podrick sail away; Brienne raises a hand as a way of saying goodbye, and Jaime raises his right golden hand back rather than having his men seize the two.

Jaime finally sees that Cersei is an insane and power-hungry tyrant, who is willing to kill and betray anyone and even let the entire realm perish as long as she can have her dominion. Jaime tries to leave but he is stopped by Gregor Clegane. Jaime encourages Cersei to give Gregor the order to execute him, but he calls her bluff and storms out, abandoning her completely.

   Lannister armies seem to be more well-equipped than any other armies that Westeros could muster. This is particularly evidenced by the high quality arms and armor forged directly in the Crownlands and Westerlands, by skilled smithies and armorers. An advanced degree of standardization and role differentiation between cavalry, heavy infantry, archers and sappers is clear.

   Lannister soldiers are typically outfitted in excellent quality armor. Sturdy, red-dyed leather coated over augmented steel armor plates, in a striking combination. This smart design, is not only aesthetically impressive - as per Lannister lavishness - but also ergonomically practical, with the segmented armor allowing for ample mobility and flexibility for the wearer.

   They also have crested steel and leather helmets, with uniquely designed cheek visors which overlap when locked shut, forming a broad facial plate with small eye slots which still give good visibility. The horizontally arrayed crests on their helmets, are a kind of defensive feature to deflect blade strikes. When the facial visors are opened, the soldier can get a better view of their surrounding vicinity, as well as talk with or to civilians more personally in their patrol duties or guard duties. The closed visors also give a deliberate resemblance to the face of a lion, looking directly forward towards it. Arguably, the design is as much for show, as for practical effectiveness.

   . The variant shown in Season 7, was used to injure Drogon.
   It is a lighter model and fired a more basic bolt as a projectile. Apparently only a single unit of this was built as a prototype, and taken into service for Jaime's field army in S7. After this unit was destroyed by Drogon, Qyburn went back to the drawing board and improved the design considerably; with the second model of Scorpion ballistae being a huge improvement on the previous design.

  <p key="cd9fe372-7517-45c5-849f-a6508845500b">
   The improved Scorpion ballistae seen in Season 8, are bigger, heavier, more powerful and fire much more lethal bolts (apparently with design input by Euron, due to the opening, kraken-shaped bladed heads on the much larger and nastier bolts). These bolts visibly have greater penetrative power and can do terrible damage. They are used to brutal effect against both Rhaegal and a portion of Daenerys Targaryen's remaining fleet

   There were dozens of these artillery units, arrayed on the battlements of King's Landing and fitted to ships of the Iron Fleet, with specially trained Lannister and Greyjoy engineer crews manning them. Though deadly even to dragons, they were slow to reload as well as difficult to turn, due to their own size. None of Cersei's or Euron's artillery scored hits on Drogon, and all were destroyed by dragon-fire in short order.

   The official Lannister motto, "Hear Me Roar", is a reference to the
   lion
   on the House's sigil, an animal that is powerful, fierce, and strong. Behind closed doors, however, they are known for their unofficial motto: "A Lannister always pays his debts". On one level, this represent the Lannister richness and their pride for it. They trade for having money (e.g

   ). On a literal level, this boasts their reliability and the honorable repayment. Unfortunately, this also has a dark flip side: when wronged, a Lannister seeks revenge.

   The Lannister colors are gold and crimson. Gold is associated with a crown, and money, something the Lannisters have aplenty, and being the best, as in with a medal, just as the Lannister see themselves as superior. It is also an eye-catching color that demands attention. Like their golden hair, gold is a color of sunny false appearances. Crimson indicates

   and status. Both in the
   and
   eras, crimson (and its natural derivative purple) were colors only warn by important people, such as monarchs and military leaders. Yet they are not truly royalty and gain stature by social climbing and being close to royalty:

   The House sigil, a lion, is also symbolic. Throughout history, lions have always been depicted as kings of the jungle, again signifying their life of royalty.
