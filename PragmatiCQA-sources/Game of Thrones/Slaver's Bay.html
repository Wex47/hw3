   The term "Slaver's Bay" often specifically refers to these three populous cities on the eastern side. Two surviving Valyrian colony-cities at the northern base of the peninsula did survive:
   Tolos
   and
   Elyria
   . Without central control from Valyria after the Doom, however, the two cities fell into the economic and cultural orbit of the three large Ghiscari cities to the east. In the present they are thought of as more of an outlying backwater of the wider "Slaver's Bay" region. The northern side of the bay, between Tolos and Meereen, is sparsely inhabited in the present day, vulnerable to Dothraki raids from the north.

   The region later known as Slaver's Bay was once the heartland of the great
   Ghiscari Empire
   , which flourished well over five thousand years ago, and was one of the earliest civilizations in the

   began to rise to the west, across the Gulf of Grief. Valyrian expansion was driven by their discovery of

    dragons
   </a>
   in the
   volcanic mountains
   of the Valyrian peninsula, which they mastered and rode as weapons of war. The two great empires developed an intense rivalry, and clashed in
   a series of five massive wars
   , but the vast slave-legions of the ancient Ghiscari could not withstand Valyrian dragonfire. Five thousand years ago, the Valyrians finally succeeded in destroying the Ghiscari Empire, burning its capital city
   Old Ghis
   to the ground, conquering its surrounding lands and colonies, and enslaving the survivors. Five thousand years of Valyrian mastery obliterated much of the original Ghiscari culture.

   destroyed the great civilization within a single cataclysmic day - after which Valyria's outlying colonies and conquests reasserted their independence. While their colonies to the west of Valyria developed into the

    Free Cities
   </a>
   , in a parallel development, their colonies to the east overthrew their Valyrian overlords and became the independent city-states of Slaver's Bay. The three most powerful of these cities became Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen.

  <p key="cf049107-6a4e-4feb-997d-1e41f278fbc1">
   The ruling elites of Slaver's Bay practiced large-scale slavery; indeed, their entire economy centered around it. In times of peace they bred them, and in times of war they captured them. Many slaves were taken from distant lands, even places far across the sea such as the continent of
   Sothoryos
   . Due to this ethnic melting pot, combined with thousands of years of Valyrian domination, little of the original culture of the old Ghiscari Empire has survived. Even the language spoken in the present-day Slaver's Bay is a derivative of
   <a href="High Valyrian.html" key="1922d08c-f457-4f05-9260-ae6a5863451e" title="High Valyrian">

   , not the
   Old Ghiscari
   language - which is functionally dead. The
   Low Valyrian
   language spoken in Slaver's Bay is, however, very distinct from the other Low Valyrian languages spoken in the Free Cities, as it was geographically separated and subjected to unique local influences. A few constructions and loanwords from Old Ghiscari such as "mhysa" ("mother") survive into Slaver's Bay Low Valyrian, but it fundamentally remains a derivative of their old Valyrian conquerors.
  </p>
  <p key="a7449cc7-2ad1-4820-83d2-2caf6c9d48c5">
   Despite the vast chronological and cultural gap between them, the local ruling slavemasters of Slaver's Bay prided themselves on surviving scraps of Ghiscari culture, and liked to think of themselves as a continuation of the Ghiscari Empire's old glories - extending to the point that each of the former slaver-cities uses a
   harpy
   as its sigil, as the old Ghiscari Empire did.

   , and marched on Meereen. The
   Great Masters
   issued a threat to Daenerys in the form of 163 crucified slave children, one at each mile-marker on the road to Meereen. This only served to infuriate the Dragon Queen, and she promptly brought her forces to bear in the
   Siege of Meereen
   . After inciting a slave revolt and seizing the city for herself, Daenerys crucified 163 of the Great Masters in retribution for their stunt with the slave children. Upon learning that
   Cleon
   had set himself up in Astapor and the
   Wise Masters
   had restored their control over Yunkai, Daenerys resolved to remain in Meereen to enforce her abolition of slavery, and also to practice the art of governance in preparation for her eventual conquest of

   Valyrian Peninsula
   via the city of
   Mantarys

   During the
   Dawn Age
   , the old
   Ghiscari Empire
   that once ruled the region was bountiful: forests provided abundant wood, fields were plentiful, and the hills were filled with copper for weapons. Copper stopped being as important as it used to be, however, after the forging of iron was discovered and spread across Essos (this iron age began over 6,000 years ago, and the Ghiscari themselves did switch to iron weapons). When the Valyrians conquered the region in the
   Ghiscari Wars
   five thousand years ago, the flames from the dragons burned out all of the forests, so they no longer had lumber. Without the trees to hold the soil in place, it baked and blew away in the wind, and crop yields became meager. No longer possessing valuable surpluses of timber, crops, or useful metals, it is easy to see how the entire economy of the region became so heavily reliant upon slavery. This is ultimately one of the reasons that Daenerys Targaryen's intervention encounters such difficulty - such as the invented scene with the slave
   Fennesz
   (a condensation/representation of several slaves in the novels), who points out to her that their economy has been so heavily based on slavery for so long that simply removing it left many former slaves without livelihoods.
