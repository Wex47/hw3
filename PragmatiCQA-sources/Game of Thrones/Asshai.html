   According to costume designer
   Michele Clapton
   , Quaithe's mask was designed to display a stylistic link to Melisandre, since both of them are from Asshai. Melisandre wears an ornate neck piece featuring a repeated design motif of elongated hexagons, and Quaithe's mask was constructed using the same hexagonal shapes as links, though filled in with metal. Further, the dresses of both characters have the same hexagonal design motif (elongated so they are taller than they are wide). Melisandre has been seen wearing different dresses, she usually wears an all-red one but is seen wearing an alternate dress with an hexagon motif in "

   Red Priestess
   , and Kinvara also wear large hexagon-shaped necklaces, which in Kinvara's case is identical to Melisandre's. It's not clear if all these characters are actually from Asshai, or if the Asshai'i motif has been appropriated by the Lord of Light religion, which is followed throughout much of Essos. Given Asshai's remoteness and the sheer size of the priesthood (note that

   map book places Asshai southeast of
   Yi Ti
   (which is itself east of Qarth), on the eastern shores of the Jade Sea (which has been completely moved from its location on the HBO map). The Saffron Straits link the Jade Sea to as-yet-unknown seas to the east, and Asshai sits at the mouth of the straits. A major river, the Ash, empties into the Jade Sea at Asshai. The river flows out of the Shadow Lands, an area of mountains and hills northeast of the city, which is surrounded by
   Ghost grass.
   Further upriver from Asshai is a ruined city called Stygai.
   Yi Ti
   and the large island of Leng are located northwest of Asshai across the Jade Sea, but the closest islands to Asshai are the Manticore Isles, a small chain of land directly westward (apparently inhabited by very poisonous
   manticore
   insects). "Ulthos" lies across the Saffron Straits from Asshai, but it is unknown if it is another continent or just a very large island. The distance between Qarth and Asshai appears to be roughly similar to the distance between Qarth and
   Old Valyria
   . Asshai is located at roughly the same line of latitude as the island of
   Naath
   , placing it further south than the southernmost points of Westeros.

   sourcebook revealed many details about Asshai. The city is apparently so ancient that even its own inhabitants don't know when it was first constructed, or even who constructed it (they will only say that a city has stood in this location since the world began, and a city will remain there until the world ends). Also, the physical expanse of Asshai is so large that Qarth, Volantis,

   could be accommodated behind its massive land walls. According to travelers' reports, all of the buildings in the city - from palaces to hovels - are constructed of a greasy black stone that seems to diminish any source of light: even the sun is considerably dimmer in Asshai than elsewhere, and the nights are pitch black.

   The inhabitants of Asshai are equally unusual. Despite the city's size and its long history as a major port on the Jade Sea, the local population is no larger than that of a market town. The Asshai'i themselves are described as highly secretive, wearing masks and veils in public and never socializing in the streets of the city. Followers of all religions and practitioners of all sorts of magic are welcome in Asshai, where nothing is forbidden. There are no beasts of burden to be found in the city; crops are impossible to grow in the area (the only living flora is Ghost grass, which is inedible); and even drinking water has to be imported. Apparently the Ash River, which empties into the sea at Asshai, exudes some noxious presence that pollutes/kills off most living things: any animals brought to the city die soon afterwards, deformed - blind fish are the only fauna of the Ash (
   shadowbinders
   are the only humans who dare to eat these fish), and the human population is seemingly rendered sterile from long exposure. For this reason, there are no children in Asshai, and the population apparently "reproduces" by purchasing foreign child slaves and raising them as successive generations of Asshai'i. In a way this somewhat makes them a parallel to the
   Citadel
   of the
   <a href="Order of Maesters.html" key="b438d7f5-0eb5-4291-b998-f5c7c787f70f" title="Order of Maesters">

   in Westeros - more an institution than a bloodline, passing down knowledge from one generation to the next; but while the Citadel teaches scientific knowledge, Asshai teaches magic.
