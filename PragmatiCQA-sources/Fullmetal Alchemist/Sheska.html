After finding her trapped in her home under a collapsed mountain of books, Sheska confirms the Elrics' worst fears - that the book, which she herself had read cover to cover, had indeed been in the First Branch and, therefore, destroyed.

   for their own safety. There, Sheska and Winry are captured by Mustang, though as she spends more time with him, she gradually comes to realize she misjudged his intentions behind not pursuing the culprit behind Hughes' death. Sheska is the one in
   the 44th episode
   who had informed Edward and Alphonse that Hughes had been killed after Mustang had kept this fact hidden from them. Although Edward is angered by this, Sheska, having regained her respect for Mustang, helps Edward understand that he only hid the fact to keep the Elric brothers from blaming themselves. Later after the Elrics left Resembool, while walking outside with Winry, Sheska realized the real reason behind the Homunculi's actions in stealing the Philosopher's Stone and spreading rumors of it being dangerous to create was intended to prevent people from dangerously creating the stone to use for their selfish purposes. In the series epilogue, Sheska returned to Central and begun working for the military again, and also narrated in the
   final episode
   of what happened to Amestris after

She has been fired from several jobs for her preoccupation with books, which is problematic because she has to pay her sick mother's hospital bills. After receiving a large sum of money as payment from Edward and kind words of encouragement from Alphonse, Sheska is able to move her mother to a better hospital and starts to believe in herself a bit more.

    Sheska's photographic memory borders on instant recall, an immensely rare neurocognitive ability that allows a person to perfectly recall information that they have either read, heard, seen, or otherwise encoded into their long term memory. Additionally, this ability is also similar to a rare condition called Hyperthymesia, which is a condition in which a person is able to recall a vast quantity of information in such detail that is known as Autobiographical Memory. To date, only 60 known individuals in the real world are known to have an autobiographical memory.
