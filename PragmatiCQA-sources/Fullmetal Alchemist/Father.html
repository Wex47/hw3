   Father's original personality when he was known as the Dwarf in the Flask is more human-like and beautifully charismatic than when compared to his later self. His later self is stated by Hohenheim to be much more stoic, composed, almost lifeless, and almost always looking bored, the reason being that he had supposedly purged himself of the seven vices (this "purging" seems to have been incomplete, since he acts in sinful manners that reflect the seven vices).
  </p>
  <p key="118248e1-6230-4b29-bddb-9a6e5d4264f0">
   For the most part, he is menacing, dark, and foreboding, though he can have traces of humanity, as, during his first meeting with the Elric brothers and

   , Father shows a somewhat comical, lighter side to his personality, similar to that of Hohenheim, but almost immediately after switches back to his very serious demeanor. Although this change may have been due to the presence of his Greed within him.

  <p key="67b0b324-40aa-4b4f-962c-7da91642b4ba">
   Father is also narcissistic, callous, merciless, pitiless, egotistical, megalomaniacal, deeply selfish, and believes that everyone around him are nothing but tools to be used as part of his plans. The only exceptions to this may be his seven Homunculi "children", as Hohenheim had stated during their battle that one of the reasons he had created them was because he wanted a family of his own, hence his title of
   <i key="7467f240-9253-48fd-9d06-90d84e6e1fde">

   </i>
   , a fact which annoys him but which he also does not deny. The Homunculi personalities vicariously reveal more about Father, since, as he tells Greed himself, they were born out of his own vices, as well as the subconscious emotions that drove them, and everything they feel he has felt himself. This is particularly true of Greed, Envy, and Pride. Greed's desire for possessions was really an attempt to escape the loneliness and desire for close friends he felt deep down, whilst Envy's grandiose hatred of humans covered up a deep-seated inferiority complex and envy of humans, particularly their sense of emotional intimacy, and Pride's great disdain of the human race covers a certain lack of self-reverence. These revelations suggest that deep down, part of what Father wanted to purge was his own unbearable loneliness and jealousy that humans had each other for social, emotional, and physical support whilst he was originally the only Homunculus on Earth. Since he could not be like or part of the human race, and since he feels done with the sickening social deprivation he suffered through for what he felt was too long a time, he resolved to break free of the flask that prevented him from having physical contact with people, and to shun all the "burdensome" feelings he previously desired- longing for experiencing intimate physical and familial companionship with other people- as "inferior" by going for what he deems infinitely greater- the power to chaotically abolish the physical laws imposed upon everything.

  <p key="09598de0-aabc-42ca-9c55-2d4822c55d5a">
   His thirst for power seems to be the only thing more important to him other than himself, noted when he does not hesitate to abandon his Homunculus "son"
   Pride
   in exchange for resupplying his Philosopher's Stone or to absorb Greed into his body to resupply it. Also, though he considers the Homunculi to be his children, he never expressed grief for any of their demises. Unlike

  <p key="fa917b46-3c0c-4aa6-9e02-b7e6d11357da">
   Despite his normally calm, brooding personality, he is shown to be extremely excited when his plans finally come together, showing a wicked, gleefully evil side to his personality, as he was giggling with delight as the nationwide transmutation circle took effect. When outside of his human container and revealing his true form, he is often seen with a sadistic and homicidal grin.

   Father claims that Truth (the consciences of alchemists) is a personal God, and since Father considers himself perfectly good, he also thinks that God is on his side, and that by absorbing God, he becomes absolutely perfect. Father's extremely personal interpretations of Truth's works have a logical flaw, according to

   . Although he claims to have no emotions he actually does display them, sometimes as seemingly friendly ditziness, but also anger and great cruelty. If anything, it's more like his emotions are fairly low key. Hohenheim points out that while he claims to not want a family, the fact that he created seven "children" and had them call him Father betray his motives.

   Back when he had his original, mortal form in the flask, he had a much more polite, charismatic, yet also somewhat sarcastic personality to him. "Full of human emotions", as Hohenheim notes, before he "purged" out his cardinal sins. When confronted by Hohenheim about this, Father reveals that the seven Homunculi were only created so he would become a perfect being. Ultimately, in his final moments, Father's motivation is revealed to be freedom from the laws of the universe itself, and his dedication to his goals makes him all the more menacing.

   Father's first form is a small round mass of black gas with a single eye, a wide toothy mouth, and tendril-like arms, making him resemble the Eye of Truth from inside the Gate (This might be because Father was created from the entity's essence). He wasn't able to perform alchemy while inside the flask, but was able to teach it to the people of Xerxes. He returns to this form after his defeat, being assimilated by the

   During his battle with Hohenheim, Hohenheim gains the upper hand in the battle. However, after Father casts aside his "second form" husk and reveals his true form - which has evolved to be able to exist outside of his container - an unseen battle takes place between him and Hohenheim resulting in Father's victory. In this form, Father is shown to have a strange, almost liquid-like body structure somewhat resembling his ancient flask form. He is able to use alchemy to reshape his own body for any situation. The most common shape he took was that of a slightly obese humanoid with eyes with red irises adorning his black body and a wide grin on his otherwise nonexistent face.

   When Father absorbs around fifty-million souls from the people of Amestris, this form changes to become a giant cyclopean being. Though Father previously cryptically implied that this was his true form all along (though previously much smaller, only encapsulating Father's room) to discourage his sacrifices from escaping. This form is much thinner, showing what looks like a rib cage, a more muscular body, the multitude of eyes and wide grins that were on his previous form are gone, and he now has one large, bulging eye on his forehead.

   Due to his imitation of Hohenheim's body in Xerxes, Father's second form is a container which looks identical in appearance to Hohenheim, excluding hair and skin color, hairstyle, clothing, a few additional wrinkles, and a lack of glasses. Hohenheim has referred to this form as nothing more than a human-like husk that Father uses to hide his true appearance. He is normally seen in the cavity beneath Central in which he and the Homunculi reside, sitting on a stone or cement throne with numerous pipes leading to it. The throne itself also has a physical connection to him, which can be unattached from him via pipes directly protruding from his spine. He uses the pipes to spread the Philosopher's Stone beneath the nation of Amestris. The purpose behind this is to act as a barrier between the tectonic energy of the earth's crust, where Amestrian Alchemy gets its energy from, so that he can stop others from using Alchemy at any time. Doing this, however, has aged his body slightly more than Van Hohenheim, who still looks identical from the time of Xerxes. This process, however, can be countered by a "Reverse Transmutation Circle", which is a concept

   Father's body is created by and contains the Philosopher's Stone that came from half of the souls of the human population of Xerxes (however, he later gave parts of it to create the other Homunculi). Due to this, he is able to perform alchemy without drawing a transmutation circle, clapping his hands together, or even moving at all. It is in this form that Father creates his seven sin

   Father's fourth form looks much like a younger version of Hohenheim. Also, despite looking so young, he keeps the voice of his second form. Due to the sacrifices, Father managed to absorb the entity beyond the gate and now has the "power of God" within him with the Amestrian souls he absorbed keeping it in check, making him the "perfect being". He can now almost completely defy natural order (or, in Father's words, "do anything"). He can manipulate energy and matter to their full extent, turn anything into anything at any scale and create any force at any magnitude.

   He retains his fourth form and the powers that go with it even after having lost the Amestrians' souls, but as he lacks the strength to keep "God" inside his new body, the new power is too much of a strain on him, and as of chapter 107, it renders him vulnerable to counterattack. Reflecting this, Father's appearance deteriorates as the fight goes on: his skin and hair losing their color, pronounced veins appearing across his body, and eventually his face losing almost all human resemblance.

   Chapter 106 also revealed that Father now has the ability to create bodies for the souls inside his Philosopher's stone. In the manga, these beings are not well-made however, and start to fall apart moments after they were created. Father used this ability to distract his enemies so he could unleash a devastating attack.

   However, Homunculus grew envious of the human race, jealous of their mutual emotional support for each other whilst he grew lonely, being only one of his kind.

   However, Hohenheim reveals his own plan: all the Xersesians souls that Hohenheim separated from his body and merged with the earth itself, using the moon's shadow as a circle, force Father to release the Amestrian souls and guide them back to their own bodies. Without the Amestrian souls, Father begins to lose control of "God" and his body becomes riddled with pronounced veins due to the strain. Furious, Father claims that he can always create another Philosopher's Stone using a hundred million or even a billion lives, because there are always more humans that he can draw energy from and he attacks the group with formidable blasts of explosions, that Hohenheim manages to block. Not letting up, Father launches a wave of energy at his human foes, but May transmutes an alkahestric barrier around them all, declaring that her craft's specialty is harnessing the flow of energy within the earth and that, the more energy is thrown at her, the more she is able to use. However, when Father fires another volley, Hohenheim moves quickly to block it with his hands, which burn and crumble as it becomes apparent that he hasn't the energy necessary to compete with Father. As he begins to fall back, Ed and Al rush to his aid, holding him up so that he might keep up the fight and their grateful father redoubles his efforts, straining his Philosopher's Stone. Luckily, Scar activates the Alkahestric reverse-Nationwide Transmutation Circle, which nullifies Father's "buffer" and grants true alchemy to Amestrians. Ed, Al and Izumi continue their assault on Father and Hohenheim explains that they can win if they can force the Homunculus to use up all the energy of his Philosopher's Stone. Greed emerges from the shadows to help the fight, but Father merely deflects all of their attacks and ascends toward the surface.

Hawkeye informs the blind Flame Alchemist that his aim was off and gives him targeting directions for his next massive salvo. As he claps his hands together to compensate for the damage done to his Flame Alchemy gloves, Roy remarks that he hasn't yet gotten the hang of circle-free transmutation and attacks Father with flames again, but Father simply absorbs the flames and reflects them back at Mustang.

However, Greed counters that he knew Father would drop his guard in order to absorb a Stone and explains that his own plan is to drain god energy instead.

Overwhelmed by the multiple onslaught, Father pushes them all back with a wave of energy, shattering Edward's automail arm in the process, but the alchemists remain unfazed and commence a second wave. But when Father blocks a kick from Edward with his arm instead of energy, Hohenheim realizes that the Homunculus is at his breaking point and can barely keep God contained within his body. Bulging and writing in agony as God's eye rises from his gullet and into his mouth, threatening to escape, Father topples to the ground and releases a huge burst of energy which throws everyone from his body.

   Just managing to keep God within his form, Father searches desperately for a soul to make into a Philosopher's Stone and sees the nearby Edward sprawled on a pile of broken concrete and desperately moves to take Fullmetal's soul to replenish his stone supply. Ed, seeing the danger as Father approaches him, attempts to scurry to safety, but finds that his left arm has been impaled on some twisted rebar jutting out of the rubble, pinning him to the spot. Ed, however, is saved by Al, who uses May's help to sacrifice himself in exchange for the return of Ed's original right arm. A distraught Edward calls Alphonse an idiot before releasing himself from his pinned state and beginning a furious barrage of attacks against Father, greatly depleting Father's stone.

   On the verge of defeat, Father reels in shock at being bested by a mere human. Another stunning blow from Ed knocks the Homunculus down for the count, but when the god energy makes another attempt to escape, Father sucks it up, rises to his feet and lunges desperately at Greed to take his Philosopher's Stone from Ling's body. As he plunges his arm inside his son's stomach and begins draining his Stone away, Ling's consciousness grabs hold of Greed inside their shared body, refusing to let him go, but as Greed states, Father's pull is stronger and any continued struggle will only result in Ling's soul being pulled into Father as well. When Ling asserts that he needs Greed's power in order to become Emperor of Xing, Greed claims to accept partnering with the prince for the throne, but knocks him away at the last second, resigning himself to his father's summons. As the avaricious Homunculus declares that this was the only lie he has ever told, he informs Ling that he can still become emperor, as Lan Fan holds the Philosopher's Stone that she took from Wrath's pocket. Drawing out his son's Stone, Father's arm turns slowly gray as he absorbs Greed's carbon armor ability, but with his last moments in the prince's body, Greed summons Lan Fan to his side and she slices off Father's arm with a simple swipe of her kunai. Ling collapses to the ground, restored to complete humanity as the Ouroboros on his hand fades away, while Father howls piteously at his own son's treachery. Though his entire body slowly morphs to carbon via Greed's power, the avaricious Homunculus explains from inside that he has used his armor ability to transform Father's anatomy to one comprised of the weakest, most fragile form of carbon imaginable and his entire being begins to crumble under its own weight. Enraged that his own son would rebel against him to the end, Father destroys Greed's soul. However, ensuring Greed's death was not in vain, Edward uses this opportunity to punch a hole through Father's chest, through which the remaining Xerxesian Souls of his Philosopher's Stone escape. With no power or souls left to contain "God" or to sustain his physical existence, Father is horrified as "God" emerges from his body and grabs him. Father laments the harshness of reality, crying out that he does not understand why reality does not permit him to get his greatest desires, and why freedom seems so impossible to achieve; soon his body disintegrates.

   , yet unaware of Truth's identity as it berates Father for trying to take the power of someone greater than him. Father claims that he wanted all the knowledge in the world and that he wanted to know what God knew. He then goes on to ask what was wrong with wanting, wishing and chasing your desires, showing the humanity he tried to purge himself of. Truth mocks him, saying that taking the power of God didn't make him God, but rather a cunning thief. Demanding to know who he is speaking to, Father is horrified when Truth formally introduces itself and states itself as the Truth as he defines it: giving despair to discourage one from becoming boastful and proud. Truth tells Father that he'll receive his most fitting despair as the Gates open up and hands appear to grab Father. Father begins crying as he desperately asks what he did wrong to deserve this and where he went wrong, showing the flaws he tried to purge himself of. Ultimately, stripped of the freedom he cherished, Father is sucked into the Gate and once again becomes part of the endless abyss within.

    (Childrens): Father expects undying loyalty from his Homunculi children and melts the first Greed down into a Philosopher's Stone as punishment for betraying him and doing things on his own terms, but his definition of "loyalty" is essentially one-sided blind obedience; he does not return the Homunculi's loyalty at all. This is proven near the end of the series, where Father does not hesitate to abandon Pride to escape to the surface in an attempt to create new Philosopher's Stones, after the latter is left in a critically vulnerable state from using the souls in his own Philosopher's Stone to force Mustang through the Gate of Truth. As Ed points out and as Pride realizes for himself, this proves Father demands complete "loyalty" (read: obedience) while giving none in return.

    Father's original flask-bound form was most likely inspired by real-life concepts of Homunculi. Supposedly, if an alchemist was successful in creating such a being, he was to keep it inside of a glass flask for a certain period of time, as it would die in its "infancy" stage outside of it. Father's evolved multi-eyed and multi-mouthed form and its giant incarnation could be a play on the

    fallacy.

    Both Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the latter half of the manga of Soul Eater were developed by Studio Bones, inspiring several new characters in the series, one of which being Table of Contents, a mysterious character that has numerous similarities to Father, acting as the leader of a group of characters based on the seven deadly sins, and was created by another character infatuated with the path of knowledge.

    Father and Envy from the 2003 anime share several similarities, as both have some sort of previous affiliation with Hohenheim, being created by him. The two were considered the first Homunculi in their respective storylines, being approximately 400 years old. It is also interesting to note that Envy's original form resembles Father's fourth form, with both looking like younger versions of Hohenheim.

    In the manga, Father's eyes in his fourth form are dark purple and, like those of Envy, Lust and Greed, have slit pupils. In the 2009 anime, they are golden with round pupils like Edward's, possibly to further imitate Hohenheim's appearance.

    Before meeting the Elric brothers for the first time, Father and Hohenheim's actions are coordinated very specifically to match up in the manga, leaving it ambiguous if he and Hohenheim are indeed the same person. Despite basing itself wholly on the manga, the 2009 anime does not include any of these scenes.

      Considering the gate seems to portray a different alchemic symbol (such as Mustang's transmutation circle) between alchemists, it may also be seen to represent Father's status as a being originating from the gate itself.

      The gate could also represent real power or wisdom gained, as Truth stated that Father "stole his power from others", thus Father's gate being blank could also signify that he neither had any real power outside of his stolen souls nor ever learned anything.

    In Chapter 104, after Father absorbs God, he ends up looking like a shirtless, teenage Hohenheim and spends the next several chapters in that form. He quickly turns into Fan Disservice after Hohenheim's countermeasure strips him of the souls needed to comfortably contain his new power, causing unsightly, bulging veins to pop all over his body.

    When confronted by Truth after the final battle, Truth calls him such for not being able to truly understand the world and humans despite having not only the power to do so, but the time as well. Essentially, he never developed past being the Dwarf in the Flask in his mindset, something Hohenheim realizes prior and calls him out on. This is illustrated in his Gate of Truth: whereas every other Gate of Truth shown in the series has ornate designs on the door symbolizing what they know of Alchemy and the world, Father is the only one who has blank doors.
