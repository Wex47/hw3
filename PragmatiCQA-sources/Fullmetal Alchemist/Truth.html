   Truth is cunning and merciless but fair and wise. It believes in the upholding of alchemy's laws and rules by any means necessary and disobedience of them to result in harsh punishment. Truth always does what it believes is fair in trade and will forcefully take from offenders. Truth holds no bias, options or prejudices as it sees all who break the rules of alchemy as equal in their offenses and thus receiving of equal punishment by losing what they value. Truth shows no favorites of victims and no mercy or exceptions.

   Despite his ruthless personality, Truth is trying to uphold the laws that bind the universe and thus punishes any trying to perform acts that cannot happen. As shown in the end however, it is shown that Truth's brutality has a reason: It wants to teach humans that alchemy isn't everything, that alchemy can in fact be devastating and crippling to those who are not good enough, that they musn't let themselves get arrogant no matter how genius they may be, to learn to accept life and death as it is and to continue on with their lives via the loved ones they still had. Indeed, when Edward was willing to give up his

It then banishes Father to depths of the Gate he had been summoned from, commenting ironically that Father must have known this would be his punishment.

   According to Father, Truth's tolls are often based on dramatic irony, oddly unfitting of Equivalent Exchange, which Truth upholds. Edward had to pay the leg he stood on and the only family he recognized as having left. He then paid his right arm to get Alphonse's soul 'back', which Truth recognized as an equivalent exchange, as one could consider Alphonse being Ed's 'right-hand man', if you will. Alphonse's soul was not used as payment, however, as it was affixed to the result of their human transmutation, which means that his body contributed to the toll. This can be interpreted as its own punishment in multiple ways, such as taking away his sense of touch and cutting him off from other peoples' warmth, or thinking along the same lines, making him become their failed creation and thereby an abomination no one wants to associate with. Izumi lost the ability to conceive at all through permanent scarring of her insides, depriving her even further of her 'motherhood'. The irony in Mustang's case would be that he would not be able to 'see' the future he would make for

   Truth's, in both its actions, visual representation and stated goal is to show those that would abuse their great power are ultimately harming themselves.  This is most evidenced by Ed's final encounter with Truth, as Truth amiably admits defeat as Ed proclaims that all he is human and he doesn't need alchemy; he only needs his friends. Such an interpretation explains some events such as the final talk between the Truth and Father, when Truth says that the Homunculus hasn't grown and evolved through what he experienced, and that he "already knows" what he should have done and why he was punished like he was. The ultimate representation of this was that while Father directed his pleas to God towards the Door, the only entity that could truly be called God was next to him without him realizing.

      Another possible reason for Winry's appearance in the opening "Rain": at this point, the scene is playing a review of Edward's review of his journey to this point.  When he faces Truth originally, and is then dragged backward through his Door (his ten year old self), he glimpses an outline of Trisha, the object of his sacrifice that brought him to the Portal of Truth, and also the most important female in his life at that time. But in "Rain", he sees Winry instead of Trisha, the current object of his affections and, after regaining Alphonse's body, his goal.

     <li key="9ef3b480-f34e-4592-8984-0e09b0892ebe">
      A third possibility, is that Winry-as-Truth, was meant to show what he desired as a trap, fitting the next scene: of him screaming within a Philosopher's Stone, before images of every homunculus except Greed. Winry, his desire that tempts him away from what must be done, and the homunculi, whom he must face to succeed.

    Trivia for connection between the Gate and theosophy) wherein it is believed that "spirituality, philosophy, science, the arts, commerce, philanthropy and among other virtues, lead people closer to "the Absolute". Planets, solar systems, galaxies, and the cosmos itself are regarded as conscious entities, fulfilling their own evolutionary paths. The spiritual units of consciousness in the Universe are the Monads, which may manifest as angels, human beings, or in various other forms. According to Blavatsky, the Monad is the reincarnating unit of the human soul, consisting of the highest of the seven constituent parts of the human soul. All beings, regardless of stature and complexity, are informed by such a Monad." From this, we can assume that, if Hiromu Arakawa intended the gate of truth to be connected to the teachings of theosophy, then the Truth would be the Monad.

     <li key="c5967b1f-14c6-4d81-bbad-51e7fbc77ae8">
      This can be justified by the motto of theosophy, which is "There is no religion higher than Truth". The emblem of theosophy also depicts the Ouroboros in it; the Homunculi are a reference to this, as they are the children of Father, who by extension came from Truth.

      It is also interesting to note that, in the same topic of theosophy, they teach of the root races of humanity (of which we are in the fifth, the Aryan race,) where they teach that the Aryans established "The City of the Bridge", which is said to be below the city called Shamballa. This could be where the first theatrical film idea "Conquer of Shamballa" came from. This could also be interconnected with the theosophical ideas of The Gate of Truth, as

    One could also make a parallel between the meaning of Truth within FMA and the role of some deities in myths, such as Hera, a Greek goddess, in myths involving heroes - which are usually sons of her husband, Zeus. Hera is usually a deity considered to be antagonistic, posing all sorts of difficulties to the hero in question, but the utmost trait associated with Hera is the one of Pedagogy, as well as Pacts and her role in most myths is associated to a sort of "testing" of the hero and his determination. Other deities associated with this symbolic trait are Juno (roman mythology) and Morrigan (Celtic mythology),
