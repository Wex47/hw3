However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Alphonse, devastated by the loss of his mother, began to fear that he and his brother would not be able to survive without her, but twisted hope returned to the boy's heart when Edward vowed that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy.

Coming to understand together that, as humans, they are but a small part of the world and universe as a whole, but that the world and universe cannot exist without a collective of small parts, the boys were able to fully comprehend Izumi's riddle by the time she returned and, as such, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training for the next five months, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. Though instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the "One is All, All is One" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called

Returned to the human dimension, Alphonse's errant soul attached itself to the soulless, inhuman creature that had resulted from the failed transmutation as it struggled futilely to survive. Incapable of sustaining life, the grotesque body died, allowing Alphonse's soul to once again wander toward the other side.

When Alphonse realizes that his new opponent is a disembodied soul bound to an empty suit of armor, just like him, 66 reveals his origins as an infamous serial killer named "Barry the Chopper" who had been pulled off death row and bound to a suit of armor by Lab 5 scientists hoping to experiment with his body and soul. Taken aback by the similarities and high combat strength of his "prey", Barry begins to taunt Alphonse, suggesting that the boy whose soul he claims to be had never existed and that his memories are all fabrications by his brother, substantiated by the people who pretend to have known him. Without the proof of his human body and remembering that Edward had mentioned a topic of discussion that he was too afraid to bring up, young Alphonse falls for Barry's ploy and becomes consumed with doubts about his own existence. Fortunately, as Number 66 is about to take advantage of Al's confusion, 2nd Lt. Ross and Sgt. Brosh arrive on the scene and open fire on his attacker. Suddenly, an explosion erupts within Lab 5, shaking the building to rubble as Alphonse watches in horror and cries out for his brother.

They turn back and request staunchly that Izumi help them find a way to restore their bodies. Reluctantly complying, Izumi puts forth a new idea; she asks Alphonse what he had seen when encountering the Truth inside the Gate when his body was taken, suggesting that with the huge toll he had paid to cross into god's domain, he likely saw a great deal more than either Ed or herself, who had only given up parts of themselves. However, Al remarks that he has no memory of anything that transpired between his disappearance from the human realm and his awakening inside the suit of armor. Deducing that Al's memories must have become repressed from the traumatic shock of the experience, Izumi declares that retrieving those memories may be the necessary key to unlocking the next stage in the Elrics' journey.

Well aware that Martel would be thoroughly outclassed by the swashbuckling statesman, Alphonse vehemently refuses to let her exit the armor and help her battered boss. Roa and Dolcetto return to Al's side and request that he get Martel to safety as they free him from his chains and move to attack Bradley with fatal futility, but as Alphonse attempts to flee, Martel makes a move from within to attack the victorious Führer, who responds by plunging one of his swords deep into Al's armor body, killing her.

Alphonse reveals to Edward that the ordeal and its various shocks have returned his memories of being inside the Gate, but that the information he regained did not include anything new on Human Transmutation. Edward, however, is more concerned with the Führer's actions in having every one of Greed's gang members slaughtered on the spot at Devil's Nest instead of leaving a few to be interrogated about Greed's obvious connection to the strange, Ouroboros-marked pair behind the manufacture of Philosopher's Stones in Central, despite having expressed a desire to get to the bottom of the matter. Suspicious of the military's motives, Edward suggests that they keep a close eye on Bradley's actions from here on.

As Winry bludgeons Edward for wrecking her automail yet again, Alphonse reflects on the events in the southern region and begins to speculate whether the return of his memories grants him the same ability that it gave to his teacher and older brother - the ability to perform transmutations without the aid of a

Barry quickly flees the scene with Ling in tow, but Alphonse hangs back to demand of the Xingese traveler why he has partnered up with the Chopper. When Ling doesn't offer an answer, Alphonse rushes off to catch his brother and finds Edward suddenly attacking Colonel Mustang.

In the morning, the boys return to the hotel but find that Winry has disappeared; they deduce that Winry, having seen the report of Hughes' death, went off into town and their suspicions are confirmed when Gracia Hughes, Maes' widow, calls and asks them to come to her house and pick up their friend.

Al and Winry remain utterly confused by this strange turn of events until Ling suddenly appears outside their hotel room window and explains the situation as he heard it from Barry the Chopper. Ling tells Al that Mustang had faked Maria Ross' death and arranged for her to sneak out of the country with the help of the Xingese travelers as part of an attempt to lure out the mysterious enemy that has been dogging them all this time; meanwhile, Edward's departure with Major Armstrong is part of a rendezvous mission wherein all involved parties pitting themselves against the elusive "Ouroboros gang" would sneak across the border to the ancient eastern nation of

Realizing that the Flame Alchemist is about to begin an all-out onslaught on the Homunculus, Al quickly transmutes an earthen blast shield to protect Lt.

Elaborating that his search for the secret to immortality is for the purpose of gaining his ailing father's favor and rise to emperorship amid dozens of other siblings, Ling claims that Alphonse's current existence is the closest thing to real immortality. However, Alphonse himself explains that his metal body is not as convenient as one might think; as a human soul bound to a metal body, the instability of his existence means that, at any given time - in a year, a century or even a day - the two unlike essences may reject each other and Al will die just as suddenly or unexpectedly as anyone else. Horrified by this news, Winry reaffirms the necessity of returning Al to his human body as soon as possible, but Ling sees the situation differently. He argues that Al's soul could simply be transferred to another body before instability sets in and remarks that, not needing to sleep, eat or feel pain, Al's state is pretty ideal. This statement irritates Al, but before he can object, Winry explodes with fury, admonishing Ling for his insensitivity and ignorance before storming off to her room. Al follows to console her and jokes that she and Edward always get angry on his behalf before he gets the chance. Winry, contemplating all the suffering that Alphonse has endured, urges him to regain his human body as soon as possible.

After Ed posits that Al's current existence would require the existence of his original, living body inside the Gate, Alphonse recalls - by way of the memories he had recovered in Dublith - his sojourn inside the Gate as well as his short time within the transmuted body. If Al's body is there inside the Gate, then all the Elrics have to do is go in and pull it out again just like Ed had done with Alphonse's soul. Just then, Ed is informed by the hotel desk clerk that he has received a call from Izumi, who confirms that the baby she had transmuted did not carry any traits similar to either her family or Sig's. She thanks Edward and hangs up again. When he tells this to Alphonse, the younger Elric explains that he feels the same gratitude, as he had blamed himself for years for forcing their mother to suffer through death a second time. Ed apologizes for putting his brother through that pain and sticking him with such an existence, but Al responds that he is just as culpable. Remembering all the suffering that has occurred as a result of their mistakes, Alphonse remarks that he had begun to believe that getting his body back wasn't worth further pain, but despite having come to understand that his current state doesn't make for an unbearable existence, he realizes that he no longer wants to spend his long nights awake and alone. With new resolve, the Elrics renew their promise to restore their bodies no matter what.

Requiring more information, the Elrics decide that they will need a way to speak with a Homunculus directly. They head off to examine Laboratory 3 for a trace of the underground level, but find nothing, as the entrance has been alchemically effaced. As they wonder what their next move should be, the Elrics are met by Sgt. Brosh, who informs them that Scar has been sighted within the city and has apparently resumed his extermination of State Alchemists. Denny explains that their information regarding the killer has been updated with the fact that a large and ornate tattoo covers the entirety of Scar's right arm, jarring Edward somewhat. Returning to their hotel room, Ed explains to Alphonse that he had met a group of Ishvalans in the Eastern Desert who had known the Rockbells and had seen them die at the hand of a heavily bandaged warrior monk with a facial injury and a tattooed right arm - whom Edward believes may be Scar. With this in mind, Edward declares that they will need to confront Scar, not only to ask him about the Rockbells but also to lure out the Homunculi for questioning. Remembering that they were called "Human Sacrifices", Edward posits that whatever the Homunculi are planning requires the Elrics' participation, making their lives indispensable; if they appear to put themselves in mortal danger in a fight against Scar, the Homunculi will surely appear on the scene. Alphonse spots flaws in the plan, but when Ling and Lan Fan appear at the window, having overheard their conversation and offering their help in exchange for a part of the spoils when they manage to capture an immortal Homunculus, a joint plan comes together.

   Over the next few days, Edward draws as much attention to himself as possible by going around town performing flashy alchemy for the citizens of the capital in an attempt to lure Scar out of the shadows. Presuming that Scar's presence around one of their precious Human Sacrifices will cause the Homunculi to take action, the Elrics have arranged for Ling and Lan Fan to lurk nearby on lookout for the monsters' unique presence. Taking notice of Fullmetal's odd behavior, Colonel Mustang and Lt. Hawkeye stop by to speak with them, but as the alchemists exchange information, Scar himself appears on the scene and attacks. Explaining their plan, the boys persuade Hawkeye and Mustang not to attack and enlist them in the plan by asking them to keep the Military Police from interfering.

   The battle continues as Scar continues to press the Elrics with his deadly skills, but in the meantime the Elrics wonder why the Homunculi have not yet shown themselves and Ling has not signaled their capture. Attempting to stall Scar from attacking further so that Ed can regain some of his stamina, Alphonse demands once again of the Ishvalan how he can condemn alchemy as blasphemy and then turn around to use it himself as a justification for murder. Al condemns the man himself for murdering the Tuckers in East City, but Scar replies that the alchemy they revere so much had turned Nina into an abomination, never to regain her humanity. Not expecting this remark, Al is once again wracked by the guilt of choosing inaction in the face of his and his brother's inability to help Nina back into her normal state; however, Edward comments that Scar's actions have not all been justifiable either. And as Alphonse suddenly notices Winry standing in an adjacent alleyway, he realizes that Ed is about to confront the Ishvalan murderer about the murder of the Rockbells. Though Al makes an attempt to silence his brother, Ed has not realized Winry's presence and makes the chilling accusation in front of her. Shocked and grieved by the sudden revelation that her parents had been murdered by one of their patients, Winry collapses in hysterics and, picking up an MP's dropped sidearm against Ed and Al's vehement protests, takes aim at Scar. Confirming that he is indeed the guilty party in question, Scar admits that Winry has every right to shoot him, but remarks that he will consider her an enemy if she pulls the trigger. He declares to the three young Amestrians that the cycle of hatred will never end until one side is destroyed, but reminds them that it was their people who drew first blood. Ed rushes to Winry, throwing himself defenselessly in front of her to shield her from Scar's attack, but Alphonse moves in just in time to throw off the Ishvalan's momentum and force him back with alchemy. Feeling cornered once again, Scar breaks through a nearby wall and flees. Before Alphonse gives chase alone, he scolds his brother for being so reckless and demands that Ed get Winry to safety.

Al responds by saying that his metal body can be a hindrance sometimes, but a hindrance is not the same thing as a curse; pitying himself in light of his brother's great sacrifice on his soul's behalf would be like denying the brother who kept him alive and the craft of alchemy which allows him to keep moving forward despite all the tragedies. He tells Scar that he will continue to believe in the potential that alchemy has and will not turn his back on it. Dissatisfied, Scar unexpectedly resumes his assault, but Alphonse is saved from harm by Edward's timely and equally unexpected arrival.

The grenade goes off with tremendous force, obliterating the upper third of the Homunculus' body. Almost immediately, Gluttony's body begins to re-form and Ling demands a strong metal cable. Edward quickly transmutes a nearby train rail into steel cable and hands it off to Ling, who ties it tightly around Gluttony's rapidly expanding flesh, effectively trapping the creature more thoroughly the more it continues to regenerate. Ling declares the Homunculus captured, in accordance with his promise. Suddenly, Lt. Hawkeye arrives in disguise, shoots Scar through the leg and orders Ling to place Gluttony in the back of her car before speeding away with them both. Realizing that confirming the lieutenant's identity in the presence of the growing crowd of MPs would cause more trouble, Ed and Al decide to trust Mustang's plan and turn their attention to the slowly fleeing Scar. But before they can deliver a final blow, the boys are interrupted by a sudden interloper - a

Taking his leave, the Führer advises Fullmetal to take good care of her and, now alone with the boys, Winry asks Ed to explain everything as he had promised during Al's absence. After relating the sad tale of her parents' noble death, the three youngsters head back to the hotel, where Winry receives a phone call from her clients in Rush Valley, who are impatient to have her back. She thanks Ed for stopping her from shooting, stating that she would never be able to face any of her new friends again had she become a murderer, and the boys see her off as she boards a train bound for the South Area. As her train starts to pull away, an embarrassed Edward makes Winry a promise - that the next time he makes her cry, her tears will be those of joy.

Approaching Lan Fan, who is now entirely without a left arm, Ed and Al ask if there is anything they can do for her, to which she replies that she would like an automail arm. Impressed by her drive, they promise to introduce her to the Rockbells soon.

   Heading over to where Mustang, Knox and Ling are discussing the nature of the Homunculi and their connection to Central Command, the boys hear the Xingese prince make a shocking declaration: that Führer King Bradley himself is likely a Homunculus, as he bears the Ouroboros mark on his patched left eye and was the one who - working in tandem with Gluttony - injured Lan Fan. Edward and Alphonse are skeptical, suggesting that the Führer's wife and son would surely have noticed him acting strangely, and remarking that - according to alchemical texts - homunculi lack the ability to reproduce. But Knox chimes in with a bit of interesting information - though young

   During their argument, the bound Gluttony becomes agitated at the sound of the Colonel's name. The Homunculus declares furiously that Mustang is Lust's murderer and, in a flash of freak rage, produces a strange volley which simultaneously breaks his bonds and obliterates roughly a quarter of the building as well as a large patch of ground outside. No one is injured in the strike, but everyone is aghast to see how the benign, rotund Homunculus has been changed by his fury, a gaping maw now extending down to his abdomen and lined with rib-like teeth.

   As Gluttony begins another attack, clearly targeting Roy, the Colonel dons his Flame Alchemy glove and declares that the Homunculus must be destroyed here before it either kills them or escapes with their identities. But though the Flame Alchemist engulfs Gluttony in a torrent of fire, the monster simply sucks the flames into his gullet, where they apparently disappear. Panicked, Mustang and the Elrics flee toward the nearby forest treeline as Gluttony gives chase, gobbling up the ground at the alchemists' heels with his mysterious power. They initially split up so as to confound the beast, but after it becomes apparent that the Colonel's injuries will keep him from evading Gluttony effectively, Edward transmutes an earthen dummy of the Flame Alchemist to distract the Homunculus while the Elrics and Lt. Hawkeye help Roy back to the car.

   But - while Riza loads Roy into the car next to where Ling and Knox have placed Lan Fan - Alphonse, Edward and Ling opt to stay behind and get more information out of Gluttony. They thank the adults for all their help, but remind them that capturing Gluttony was their plan and that they have to see it through. After Ed and Ling convince Roy that his job right now should be taking action against King Bradley, Lt. Hawkeye hands Edward her pistol and tells him to use it if he needs protection. Though the boys remember the incident with Winry and Scar in the alley and Alphonse remarks that the pistol is a tool for killing, Edward gravely accepts the weapon. As the others speed off toward the city, the Elrics and Ling head back to the forest where Gluttony is still thrashing about in search of Mustang. In spite of their earlier bravado, the boys find themselves cowering in fear of the howling Homunculus until it once again turns its berserker rage upon them. At that moment, however, the impending combat is interrupted by a black horse which appears on the scene and - verbally commanding Gluttony to stand down - quickly morphs into the Homunculus Envy.

  <p key="97d5c309-8181-4f0a-82d7-a98b85704853">
   Envy makes his way to Gluttony's side, reminding his still-upset brother that they are not allowed to kill Colonel Mustang, regardless of what he has done to their comrade. Spying Ling, however, Envy remarks that Gluttony may swallow the Xingese prince whole so long as he is careful not to harm either of the Elric brothers. Hearing this, Ed, Al and Ling realize that they have a slight advantage in combat. Transmuting a wall to split the battlefield in two, Ed and Al attack the restricted Gluttony while leaving Envy to Ling. Unfortunately, the rotund beast remains largely unaffected by their various alchemical and physical attacks and, before long, manages to cross the barrier to Ling, whom Envy has momentarily stunned by changing shape to resemble Lan Fan. With Ling frozen in Gluttony's path of imminent attack, Edward leaps forward to pull the Xingese prince out of harm's way, but Envy meddles in an attempt to keep Fullmetal from being devoured along with Gluttony's target. Realizing that the struggle has prevented Ed, the prince and Envy himself from evading Gluttony's range of attack, Al reaches out desperately to help his brother, but is halted by the great, blinding flash of the Homunculus' destructive volley. When the dust settles, Ed and Ling are nowhere to be seen; Al stands alone with Gluttony in the ruined forest clearing, the armor boy's extended left arm curiously sheared and the lower half of Envy's body sliced cleanly at the waist in line with the gouged earth upon which Edward and Ling Yao just stood.

   Furious and horrified, Alphonse lunges at Gluttony, demanding that his brother and friend be returned at once, but Gluttony - finally calmed and returning to his normal state - responds that it is impossible. They have been eaten. Overwhelmed by disbelief and despair, Alphonse collapses, screaming, to the ground.

   Alphonse remains sulking in the forest with Gluttony until morning, when the Homunculus mentions that his "Father" will be furious at his having swallowed Envy. Hearing this, Alphonse realizes that there must have been an incredibly skilled alchemist who created the Homunculi and may know a way to free Edward. Regaining his determination, Alphonse asks Gluttony to take him to the Homunculus leader. To Al's surprise, Gluttony leads him back into Central City to a hidden series of tunnels deep beneath the very heart of the capital - tunnels guarded by hordes of monstrous chimeras that allow Al safe passage through their lair so long as he is accompanied by a Homunculus. Eventually, the unlikely duo reaches a large, creepy hall at the end of the labyrinth where Gluttony calls out for his father to emerge. As a mysterious figure clad in white robes descends a nearby staircase in response, Alphonse is shocked to recognize the visage of his own father - Van Hohenheim.

  <p key="c6c90aee-392a-4756-972c-a3d319d64fd6">
   Before Al's surprise can sink in, however, Gluttony's belly begins spurting blood as the strange, tooth-framed eye opens up once more. Suddenly, a huge, hairy, eight-legged, human faced lizard-creature bursts from the eye with a scream and drags itself out onto the floor. Al is further surprised when the robed man refers to the creature as Envy, but not so much as when he recognizes Edward's automail leg sticking out from with the monsters slimy tangles. Pulling the leg out, Al is overjoyed to discover that it is attached to his still-conscious brother; furthermore, Ling is nearby as well and expresses his relief that he and Ed made have finally freed themselves. But as the boys rejoice, the robed Hohenheim appears before them, startling Edward. When the man - noticing Ed's automail - wonders aloud if they are the famous Elric brothers, however, it becomes apparent that, despite sharing the same face, this man before them is not their father.

  <p key="9c1cdaaf-0891-404d-af61-9776ffce0648">
   The absent-minded man does, however, recognize Van Hohenheim's name and shows unreasonable joy upon learning that the one who shares his face is not only still alive, but has borne offspring. The boys try to clear up the situation, but their words are ignored when the robed man notices Alphonse's missing hand. Before either Elric can explain, the mysterious man reaches out his palm and transmutes a new hand for Al out of thin air, without constructing a circle, circulating his energy or even using materials from the rest of Alphonse's armor. The boys are aghast at this apparent refusal of alchemic principles, but before they can make sense of it, the robed man displays even more impossible feats by repairing Ed's external and internal injuries without so much as batting an eye. The robed man remarks that the Elric brothers are vital assets and asks them to take care.

  <p key="d5278689-af59-451a-975e-1cd7dab47f89">
   Al suggests that Ling be treated as well, but the Xingese prince responds violently, demanding that this strange being keep away from him, as he cannot possibly be human. But it seems that Ling needn't have insisted, as the strange man remarks that he only has use for the two alchemists and orders Gluttony to dispose of the "spare". Ed throws himself in front of Ling, explaining that he is their friend, but as the man replies that he couldn't care less, Alphonse reveals to his brother that this strange robed man before them is the one whom the Homunculi call "

However, the "Father" replies that he does not consider humans foolish because their existence is so far beneath him that it would be absurd to give them any consideration at all.

  <p key="63f3a20f-f19e-44ca-9ac7-44bfc2b3af8c">
   Having sat on the fence on whether to attack the man who had just healed them, this statement helps Ed and Al make up their minds and direct an alchemical onslaught at the Homunculus leader, declaring that he is the root of all the recent strife and evil. Though Ling joins the fray, the trio finds their every attack thwarted by Father's ability to transmute without even moving a hair. In short order, Father claims that he has grown weary of their struggles and, stomping his foot upon the ground, completely turns off Ed and Al's ability to transmute. The boys are horrified at their sudden and inexplicable lack of alchemical power and are quickly subdued by Envy while Gluttony pins Ling to the floor.

  <p key="a6841720-243a-4bf5-b01e-33a2843a3e68">
   The Elrics attempt fruitlessly to transmute and Ed asks Envy to explain what's going on with their alchemy, but the monstrous Homunculus merely laughs at him and chides the humans for believing that they could control and take possession of a power that is merely lent to them by a higher power, prompting Father to scold him for saying too much. Meanwhile, Father chastises Gluttony for allowing these humans into their sanctum but notes that the prostrate Ling has remarkable strength and endurance for one of his species and remarks that such a resource shouldn't be wasted. The Homunculus leader states that Ling would make a good pawn and adds that the Homunculus Greed's position is currently vacant as he touches a finger to his own forehead where, a moment later, a vertical eye opens amid the man's wrinkles and begins secreting a shiny, red viscous fluid into the robed figure's waiting palm - a fluid both Elrics recognize as the Philosopher's Stone.

  <p key="0f7ea709-a87d-4ca4-aaf0-a25f62f7d31d">
   Envy replies that Father plans to put the Stone directly into the prince's bloodstream in the hopes of creating a human-based Homunculus. The souls in the stone will attack Ling's own soul and ravage his body mercilessly, but on the off-chance that the boy survives, he will be given immense power. Horrified, Ed and Al struggle desperately to reach Ling, but Envy's overwhelming strength holds them still. However, Ling speaks up from the other side of the room, demanding that the Elrics not intervene. He declares that attaining the Philosopher's Stone has been his goal from the beginning as Father pours the Stone into one of the prince's open wounds. The Elrics watch, mortified, as Ling writhes and screams in agony from the effects of the Stone; Ling reasserts that they need not stop the process before collapsing to the ground. When he rises again, moments later, Ling consciousness is gone Greed has returned in his place.

   However, the brothers quickly learn that Briggs has all but come under Kimblee's control, now that Major General Armstrong has killed General Raven and gone to Central to infiltrate high command. A blizzard sets in, which would prevent Edward from warning Winry's group, but since Alphonse's metal body is immune to cold he offers to go warn the group. On the way, however, Al blacks out (a disturbing occurrence as his metal body cannot sleep) and imagines himself before the Door, face-to-face with his emaciated human body. He becomes trapped in snow drifts, and May and Winry dig him out when they emerge from the mine shaft. Alphonse warns them not to return to Briggs, but blacks out again soon after—at the same time Edward nearly dies in the mine explosion in Baschool, suggesting that the Elrics' bodies and souls are connected as Edward had earlier theorized—so the group dismantles Alphonse's large body so he'll be easier to carry, and Scar leads them to a nearby Ishvalan village.

   There, Alphonse wakes up before he is put back together properly, while the group is poring over Scar's brother's research notebook. The idea of putting Al's pieces together gives May the idea to tear the binding off the notebook, thereby discovering the Nationwide Transmutation Circle. Then Alphonse's idea to flip the sheets of paper over leads to their discovery of Scar's brother's Reverse Transmutation Circle. As the group waits in the village, pondering this new knowledge, May attempts to teach Alkahestry to Al, but they become frustrated with each other, as May commands him repeatedly to "sense the pulse of the Dragon" and Alphonse insists that he can't, and asks her to teach him the theory, to which May only responds "Look, I sense it!" When Envy shows up at the village, May uses long-distance alkahestry to frustrate him, then Marcoh reduces Envy to his true, worm-like form. He informs Al that Edward is missing after a mineshaft in Baschool collapses, but instead of rushing to look for him, Al decides to remain with the group and press on with investigating the Nationwide Transmutation Circle, since that's what Al believes Edward would have done.

   Scar gives Envy to May, telling her to return to Xing now that she has a clue to immortality that will save her clan, so she and Alphonse bid each other (in May's case) a tearful farewell, and Al promises to visit her in Xing to learn Alkahestry. Then Scar and Marcoh leave together and the rest of the group (Alphonse, Winry, Yoki, Zampano and Jerso) go to Reole, since by Al's calculations the tunnel for the circle would pass beneath it. There, Al is reunited with his father, Hohenheim, for the first time in years. After the cold greeting he got from Edward only a few weeks before, Hohenheim expects similar treatment from Alphonse, but he has no hesitation in calling Hohenheim 'Dad.' Hohenheim warns Al not to be so trusting, suggesting he might be working with Father, but then smiles, touched by his son's affection. He tells Alphonse his life story, including the creation of the Little One in the Flask. When Hohenheim expresses surprise that Alphonse so readily believed such a "crazy story," he suggests that the fact that he himself is an empty suit of armor helps him believe crazy stories more easily.

At some point during the time skip he leaves Reole with Winry to join up with Major Miles.

   While Al seems to see himself in the white place before the Door, and think his body is speaking to him, Pride 'possesses' him by manipulating his metal body like a hand puppet. Pride directs Alphonse's body to Kanama, a slum of Central, where Hohenheim is hiding and Edward has just arrived. Pride imitates Alphonse's voice and tries to separate Edward from Greed/Ling and the chimeras, but Ling senses Pride through the Xingese ability to "read the Dragon's Pulse," and briefly takes back control of his body to warn the others. Pride announces his plan to kill Greed and then bring Edward and Alphonse to Central. Thanks to some quick thinking and a few of Lan Fan's flash bangs, Edward manages to break Pride's control over Al. Darius then takes Al's body away from the fight, and he reawakens in his father's care. Alphonse seems to have been aware on some level that Pride was possessing him, since he immediately warns Hohenheim that Pride must be nearby, and after Hohenheim assures Al that he is now free of Pride's control, he says that "it felt like Pride was interfering with my soul" and that it felt "disgusting."

   While Edward and Greed continue to fight Pride, Alphonse comes up with an idea to trap the Homunculus using himself as bait, even though he "knew Brother would be against it." He and Hohenheim return to the fight, where Al feigns an angry attack at Pride, and the diversion allows Hohenheim to trap them both in an enormous earthen dome, where Pride will be completely powerless in the complete darkness. As Alphonse requires no oxygen, he would be safe in the dome, but expected to miss all of the fighting during the Promised Day, as there was no way to get him out without Pride escaping as well. Trapped together, Al argues with Pride about his humanness, and lets Pride play with his helmet.

Heinkel tries to convince Alphonse to leave him, but Al refuses; Heinkel then reveals that he still has the crystal-shaped Philosopher's stone that Kimblee lost in the mines of Baschool. Heinkel convinces Al that the souls within it want to help defeat the power that killed them. Using the Stone, Al gives a rare display of his powerful intellect as well as his fighting ability. He outwits and defeats Pride in a matter of moments and traps him in an earthen dome once again. Then Kimblee and Alphonse talk about the Philosopher's Stone, and Al suggests that Equivalent Exchange can be subverted and that good can be achieved without an equivalent evil. Kimblee scoffs at his optimism and reveals that he still has the spherical Philosopher's Stone.

Alphonse and Edward, fighting together at last, face off against Pride briefly, but when Father's ability to transmute without moving proves too much for May, Edward tells Al to leave Pride to him. Alphonse rushes to May's side and protects her with his body while she partially heals herself.

   After Hohenheim and the Xerxesian souls inside him stop Father's Nationwide Transmutation Circle and return the Amestrians' souls to their bodies, Alphonse, Edward, May, Izumi, Greed and Hohenheim face off against Father again, who now looks rather like Edward.

   Father escapes upward out of his underground lair, and Al goes with Hohenheim, May and Izumi (leaving Roy with Riza and the chimeras) to follow him while Edward, at his own insistence, stays below to fight Pride. Above ground, Father creates a huge explosion and Al throws himself in front of May to shield her. The impact leaves Al in ruins: He had lost his legs and his seal was slightly cracked. When Edward loses his mechanical arm and his left arm impaled on some rubble, Al does the unthinkable. With May's help, he transmutes his soul to exchange it for the return of Edward's original right arm. He is then seen with his body at the gate. Alphonse says he's ready now and all they can do is believe in Edward now; he shakes his body's hand and gains back his body at the Gate. Truth then asks Al if he thinks Edward will try to get him back to which Al responds he will. Truth then loses the arm he stole from Edward as he asks Al what he thinks that his brother will sacrifice to bring Al back.

   When Ed comes for Al, Ed sacrifices his 'Gate' for his brother. Al is surprised as being able to feel again and attempts to readjust to normal life. In the end, he will travel to Xing to study alkahestry with May. Accompanying him are Zampano and Jerso, acting as bodyguards as well as searching for a way to return their bodies back to normal. In the epilogue, he is seen in a picture with Ed and Winry married.

   In a
   gaiden
   , it is revealed that his armor was sent to them from Central, and, thinking of what to do with it, Alphonse decided to have it melted down to be made into automail parts to help anyone else it could in a sign of respect. The helmet however, was salvaged by Den and used as a nest for some bird-lings she found.
