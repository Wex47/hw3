   declare that there is to be a solar eclipse on that very day, suggesting perhaps (in conjunction with Hohenheim's earlier statement) that the eclipse (and perhaps the celestial circle created by the sun's corona around the moon) is part of the ritual that will open the Gate. Though it isn't suggested in the manga or the anime, some speculate that the Promised Day occurs on the equinox. The reason this is speculated is because the equinox is considered holy by many ancient civilizations.

   Despite the combined efforts of everyone involved in its prevention, Father's plan progresses with relative smoothness as he summons the four independent Human Sacrifices (Ed, Al, Izumi and Van) and also sacrifices

   The Nationwide Transmutation Circle activates in
   Chapter 104
   , drawing in the souls of every single human being in Amestris to the center. As the Nationwide Human Transmutation occurs, the individual Gate of each Human Sacrifice is forced open, causing them to conflict with each other. This clash releases enough Human Transmutation energy to open the Gate belonging to the Earth itself. As the massive Gate opens under his control, Father expands his body to massive size with the energy of the transmutation and activates the circle in the sky created by the sun's corona around the moon which resonates with the circle on Earth to open the Gate of the Heavens, which Father calls "

   Fortunately, a countermeasure put into place ahead of time by Van Hohenheim goes into effect in
   Chapter 105
   , activating
   an array which strips Father's body of all the Amestrian souls he had absorbed
   and allowing all of the souls to return to their rightful bodies as called back by their spirits. Scar, activating
   yet another countermeasure
   , reverses the seal Father had placed on Amestrian alchemy, giving Edward, Alphonse, Izumi and Mustang the ability to fight at their full potential.

    In the anime, the center of the circle is actually much bigger than in the manga; it was able to stretch for at least one block's worth in distance from central command. Although, as Father's pawns/co-conspirators demonstrated, one had to at least be at ground level to be safe.
