He has long and stringy black hair that runs down his head, sharp teeth and a single blank white eye with a scribbly outline. His red node that he shares with most of siblings is on the right side of his body, and goes from where his right eye should be, down to the right palm of his hand. He is also commonly seen with chains around his wrists. Sloth is almost always frowning while baring his sharp teeth, only smiling when completing the tunnel, and when dying. The only time he closed his mouth completely is in his debut appearance in the Manga, when the first Greed asks Lust where Sloth is.

   His personality isn't explored much. However, as shown through his few appearances, he is often shown complaining about how much work he has to do. He claims that even simple things such as thinking are a pain and smiles when he dies, stating living itself was a pain. However, he diligently follows the orders given to him. In addition, when frustrated or pushed too far he will become annoyed and resort to full strength and become dedicated in fulfilling his task, as shown by his determination to kill the female general. He is rather simple-minded and doesn't seem to be able to think about difficult or complex strategies. This, along with his clumsiness, means he is not good at stealth or surprise attacks. Unlike other homunculi, aside from Gluttony, he doesn't seem to view humans as inferior, or at least never vocalizes it. Likewise, while fighting or killing he doesn't seem to feel glee or joy, only the drive to finish his mission.

   In combat, Sloth uses his fists and the chains on his wrists coupled with his astonishing physical strength. He is more than capable of crushing and tearing through solid rock and steel with his bare hands and can easily crush a human body with accidental ease. Sloth's hide is also extremely tough, being capable of resisting bullets and merely being staggered by a rocket launcher - however it has weak points: such as on the top of his head and the inside of his body. Nothing short of tank or artillery fire could pierce it from a distance. In his most devastating attack, he hurls himself towards his foes at incredible speed. In fact, his speed is so formidable, he appears to have no means of controlling his momentum and is thus incapable of stopping himself without crashing into something. He claims to be the fastest Homunculus, which is fitting, as the sin of Sloth signifies a wasting of one's potential.
  </p>
  <p key="ad23dddc-9c4b-4a56-a58f-b90253078059">
   Sloth is also extremely clumsy and easily fooled. While incredibly fast, he lacks proper coordination needed to fully utilize such abilities, and thus tends to have a very poor aim as well. He is very slow-witted and apathetic, resulting in opponents getting the better of him simply by outpacing him. His sluggish nature may also explain his low intelligence, as in his last moments he claims that thinking "takes too much effort".
  </p>
  <p key="8e66dde9-291e-47a6-b54a-1d3088c0a24f">
   His regenerative abilities are notably slower than those of the other Homunculi, though the reason for this is unknown. It is in line with his sluggish character and may be an effect of his large frame. He is able to use this to his advantage however, by stretching out the tendons in his muscles, increasing the range of his attacks. However, it has also been shown to be a hindrance as well, as Sloth did not need to be killed nearly as many times as his Homunculi brethren. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that when Alex Armstrong impaled Sloth through the mouth with an earth spike, the Homunculus's Philosopher's Stone apparently lost a lot of energy keeping Sloth pinned before he could slowly regenerate and free himself. This incredibly slow regeneration also led to both Sig and Alex being able to inflict massive, continuous damage onto Sloth (increasing the amount of energy needed to heal himself as well) until he finally disintegrated a short time later.
  </p>
  <p key="8cb6fe19-5c71-4837-919f-55bfcc745bbf">
   Some of the Stone's power may also have been lost keeping Sloth alive while he was frozen in a snowdrift outside Fort Briggs, as it was a fairly long time before he was thawed out. Another theory is that Father never intended for Sloth to be used for combat, and thus gave him only enough souls for self-sustenance while digging the tunnel.

    In the last popularity poll, Sloth is the least popular Homunculus. He is also the least developed and is given the least amount of screen time, as he dies fairly soon after his late introduction. He is also the only Homunculus never to share a scene with any of his siblings.
