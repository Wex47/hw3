Another way that The Grand Arcanum can work is with the user tattooing their body with special texts and designs in order to use it, and when making a Philosopher's Stone this type of usage effectively makes them a living Philosopher's Stone by drawing all the souls into their own body.

Different from alchemy however, it also permits a person to create a Philosopher's Stone by using people's lives being taken in a war or massacre and their suffering when they are being killed overtime, not needing to kill them only to make the stone but using their deaths instead.
