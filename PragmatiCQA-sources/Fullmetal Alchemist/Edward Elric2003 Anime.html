   While having a similar appearance to his manga counterpart, this version of Edward Elric possesses much softer skin features. In the beginning he wore his trademark red jack, but stops wearing it midway through the series and mainly wears the reat of his outfit consisting of a short black hoodless jacket (with white linings on the ends), black-colored sleeveless shirt and pants, a wide brown belt, as well as dark colored boots.

His pants matches the color of his vest. He now wears a long brown coat in place of his old red one.

Despite this he still retains his sense of compassion and refuses to kill an enemy unless necessary.

   Ed discovers that Dante faked her death at the hands of Greed and use the Philosopher's Stone to transfer her soul to Lyra's body. Edward also learns Dante's past with Hohenheim 400 years ago. Edward then was informed by Dante in Lyra's body that she is next to transfer her soul to Rose's body. Dante uses Rose's baby to open the Gate and Ed is sent to the other side of the Gate. When he awakes he finds himself in another body that looks almost exactly the same as his. He sees Hohenheim, who confirms Ed's suspicions that he is in fact in another world. It is revealed that Ed and Hohenheim are in London during World War I. Hohenheim explains that the huge amount of death in this world is the source of all alchemy in their world, he also tells Ed that only his soul and mind crossed through the Gate and that his body is still inside, making it possible to return using his inner Gate.

Ed and Envy engage in a fight, Envy changing from form to form, including Tim Marcoh, Mustang, Maes Hughes and others, trying to take Ed off guard. Ed demands to see his true face and Envy reveals his true appearance, which holds a resemblance to Hohenheim. Dante tells him that Envy was the first Homunculus created when Hohenheim tried to bring his and Dante's son back to life, over four hundred years ago when he died from Mercury poisoning. Using this news as a distraction, Envy transforms his arm into a blade and stabs Ed through the heart, killing him. However, Al breaks free before Gluttony can completely devour him and plans to revive Ed, because his soul is still at the gate and has not yet crossed over. Envy tries to stop him, but fails while meeting Edward at the Gate. Envy learns that Hohenheim is still alive on the other side of the Gate and sets out to kill Hohenheim, against Ed's advice.

He explains to Hohenheim that there is a rocket scientist in Munich who he believes may be able to help him get home. As Ed is on the train, he vows to someday be reunited with Al.

His father sacrifices both himself and Envy to open The Gate to finally send Edward home. Reunited with Alphonse and Winry at last, both of whom are joined by Sheska, he is equipped with new automail. With the aid of Alphonse and the returning Roy Mustang, they manages to infiltrate and defeat Dietlinde, as well as the Thule Society. However, Edward made the conscious decision to cross The Portal again in order to close it from the other side, whist bidding goodbye to both his brother Alphose and Roy Mustang. Back on Earth, Ed finds Noah cradling the dead body of Alfons Heiderich before realizing that Alphonse had managed to hide in a suit of armor, almost identical to the one he was trapped in the anime. After Heiderich's funeral, Ed and Al decide to locate and dismantle Huskisson's atomic bomb and settle in this alternate dimension.
