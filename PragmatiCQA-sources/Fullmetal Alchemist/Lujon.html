   He'd been engaged to a woman named
   Lydia

But as Lust helped him learn more about alchemy, he fell in love with the Homunculus, which Lydia started to realize as she watched the two working together. Lydia was set to marry Lujon, but on their wedding day, he left Lydia at the altar and confessed his love to Lust. Lydia rushed off after him and saw him embracing Lust, then stormed off angry and heartbroken. Lust, knowing she couldn't stay with Lujon as she had other plans and no real affection for him, told him to follow Lydia.

   Sometime after the Homunculus left his side, however, the stone's power slowly began to fade and the fossil disease returned, causing him to flee in search of a new Stone. After some time, he finds Lust again as he'd secretly hoped, and she is quick to replace his old Red Stone for her own gains. When they finally return to town, he confesses his love for her once again; however, she's only brought back a little of her memories of her birth as a homunculus. He's shocked when she coldly kills him. Before dying, she states that he was her mistake (as she and Envy had been hoping for him to become astute and desperate enough to attempt to create a
