   Basque Grand is a rather large and muscular man easily towering over most average sized humans. He is bald, and sports a large black pointy handlebar mustache (much like Grumman although curvier and the tips are longer), and a small scar on the left side of his chin. He wears the standard blue Amestrian State Military uniform, but rolls up his sleeves in combat to use his Transmutation gauntlets.

   , Grand, who held the rank of Colonel, was one of the commanding officers during the Ishvalan Civil War. Despite Marcoh's wishes, Grand authorizes the use of Marcoh's research to amplify the powers of the State Alchemists to quickly end the war, not caring about the lives of the Ishvalans since the deaths of soldiers and civilians is a part of a war. He also has Roy Mustang execute Winry's parents. Despite them serving as doctors in the war and treating both sides,

   Due to the 2003 anime series taking its own turn, the Iron Blood Alchemist's abilities differ greatly between the manga and anime versions of the character, but in both, Grand is a notable combat alchemist. Grand has also been noted to possess considerable strength and is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat.

   In the manga, Basque Grand is portrayed during the Ishval War as wearing two elaborate gauntlets with stylized metal plating on the forearms and the backs of his hands, and rings around the wrists. The rings are inscribed with alchemical markings while the seven plates on each arm are marked (in descending order from elbow to wrist) Inuenies, Occultum, Lapitem, Visita, Interiora, Terrae, Rectificando. In order, meaning:

In particular, Grand displays acute understanding of metallurgy and weapons construction, able to use his alchemy to create massive numbers of armaments and cannons out of rock and stone. In
   chapter 60
   , Grand transforms an Ishvalan building into a huge mass of weapons including several cannons, gatling guns, and chained flails.

   . Though Grand did not have the opportunity to reveal his alchemical style before he was murdered by Scar (barring a single instance in which he transmutes his gauntlet into a form that makes punches more effective, used when he sucker-punches Ed), a flashback to the Ishval War depicts Grand as specializing in the transmutation of firearms. He is shown encased in an iron, egg-shaped mass with several small explosive cannons sticking out of it, firing into the desert. Although, this style may only have been used by Grand because he'd had a government-issued Philosopher's Stone augmenting his abilities at the time.
