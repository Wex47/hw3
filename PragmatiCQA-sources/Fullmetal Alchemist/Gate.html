   , the Gate is a pair of doors resembling a set of large stone tablets engraved with a mural, floating in an endless white expanse. Though there appears to be nothing behind the doors when they are closed, upon opening, they reveal a dimension of information which manifests as a shadowy void with several shadow-like ethereal hands protruding from it and a single large eye within. The shapeless void and its extremities look very similar to the original forms of both Father and the Homunculus

   Though the Gate appears identically to any and all who pass through it, the engravings on the stone doors appear different to each person as a reflection of their true self and to that alchemist's understanding of "The Truth" (all the engravings, in one way or another, are representations of the Universe and the Cosmos). For Edward Elric, who has passed through the Gate no less than four separate times, the mural is a relief of the

Due to this, Gluttony's Gate is full of all the objects he has eaten within a massive sea of his victims' blood.

   In the 2003 anime, the Gate functions similarly to that of the original manga, appearing as a pair of doors in an endless white expanse and forcing the truth of alchemical knowledge into the minds of alchemists who are called to it by the rebounds of Human Transmutation, but its nature is different. Instead of being a source of alchemical knowledge, the Gate in the 2003 series is the origin of alchemical energy and a dimensional portal to another world - the

   . It is explained that, when people from "our world" die, their souls become energy which passes through the Gate and becomes the energy used in everyday transmutations in the Fullmetal Alchemist world. Those who pass through the Gate are separated into three parts - the mind, body, and soul - until emerging on the other side. For those unable to cross properly, parts of the mind, body or soul are taken by the Gate, but those who emerge whole on the other side find themselves in the

    It is interesting to note that the Eyeballs that appear in the manga and 2009 anime whenever the Gate is summoned vary slightly between both media.

    The mural on Edward's gate was designed by Robert Fludd, who was a studier of the works of Paracelsus. This seems like another view of the connection between Edward and his father Hohenheim, as Paracelsus is the person upon which the character of Hohenheim was based.
   </li>
   <li key="f6f2ca77-17eb-418c-a8dd-ad4eccebf0ec">
    The concept of the Gate of Truth could have come from the idea of "Akashic Records" or "Akashic library", an ethereal compendium of all knowledge and history. In this case, the Gate would be the Akashic library and compendium of all knowledge. The term of Theosophy was used during the Renaissance to refer to the spiritually-oriented thought and works of a number of philosophers, including Paracelsus and Robert Fludd.
   </li>
   <li key="a2ba549a-aee7-48ab-87bd-01b5e38d7bee">
    For some unknown reason, the design of The Gate slightly differs after episode 45 of the 2003 anime than it does in the earlier episodes and in the opening scene of Conqueror of Shamballa. A monument of a baby being held up appears on top of the gate that is not there in the other appearances. Its possible that it is a reference to the Gate from the manga, which differs slightly in appearance from person to person, as every time this version of the gate appears it is being opened by Dante, and the gate opened by Hohenheim and Alphonse in the movie had a completely different appearance.
   </li>
   <li key="47223350-f006-4ac7-9795-c18c94140f55">
    The Gate may also serve the purpose of reincarnation in the 2003 anime, as Alphonse said that his brother's soul was still at the Gate in episode 51. This would explain why babies still have strong connections with the Gate, as well as the Gate Children being souls still reincarnating between both sides of the Gate.

    In some instances an inscription on the door is seen, it goes as follows: "Babygulrot, liten, stygg, lever i gulroten skygge, babygulrot." This is a Norwegian poem that translates to "Babycarrot, small, ugly, lives in the shadow of the carrot, babycarrot."

    As stated by Father, whenever an alchemist performs human transmutation and the alchemist is taken to the gate, the Truth takes the organ or limb related to the alchemist's "desire" as a toll, ironically enabling him/her to fulfill it - but providing them with a sort of "lesson" -, as seen when:

    In the 2003 anime, it was heavily mentioned that The Gate exists within everybody.

    The Gate could possibly be a reference to the
    Porta Alchemica
    , also known as the Alchemical Door, which is located near Esquiline Hill. There are two legends about the door, which are:

      A group of alchemists were searching for herbs which would help craft the Philosopher's Stone, when a pilgrim - later identified as alchemist Giuseppe Francesco Borri - came by. He was hospitalized and disappeared the next morning through the door, leaving behind cryptic notes and a little bit of gold. The notes were then inscribed on the gates surrounding the villa.

        Yesod: Basis redemptio = Base redemption branch. Elchai (Hebrew) = god of life (though, interestingly, could also translate to "alchemists/tainted", depending on letter breakups and vowels). Vel sadai (Hebrew) = And not an apprentice. Omni potens= almighty/all-powerful.

      Ed may be represented by the bottom of the chart, which is an earthly connection. If Father was the top of the chart, the closest thing to unfathomable god, then the seven Homunculi may correspond to the seven circles, which serves to directly contrast with their virtuous meaning in Judaism. Truth may correspond to the "unfathomable" space that is beyond the top circle.

    Technically, as using the Gate of Truth requires sacrifices from humans, it's theorically possible to open one's own Gate of Truth by offering a Philosopher's Stone in place of one's self. Thus an alchemist would gain knowledge without the loss of part of themselves.

      Ed partially proves this. Due to himself, Ling and Envy being trapped in Gluttony's stomach dimension, he transmutes himself to open his portal and offering souls from Envy's Philosopher's Stone to compensate for taking Envy and Ling with him through the portal.

        This additionally proves Gluttony's stomach is indeed between reality and Truth, as this forces him to "regurgitate" the trio.
