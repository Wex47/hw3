   A very belligerent state, Drachma is known for its constant on and off struggle against Amestris. Sometime in the early 1900s, both countries have signed a Pact of Non-Aggression, which endured until the end of 1914 in a somewhat shaky state and with constant threats of being broken.

     It's interesting to note that while the Drachma - Amestris border is iconic in the manga and the 2009 anime for having freezing temperatures and snow, in the 2003 anime it is shown to be a dry, almost desert-like area.

    The country of Drachma shares many similarities to the real-world country of Russia. Both have high military power, dress in similar clothing, and both are Arctic countries. Drachma and Amestris, both have shaky relations (presumably due to Amestris' militaristic ideology) and have signed a Pact of Non-Aggression which was later broken, similar to the fate of the
    Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
    between Germany and the USSR.

    Drachma is commonly referred to as "the large country to the north" in the manga and in the 2003 and 2009 anime.
