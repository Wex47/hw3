  <p key="f9e48e11-622e-4e62-be9f-2f88067dbe41">
   Izumi normally wears a long white-collared, button-up blouse that reveals her cleavage of flowing backside, form-fitting grey pants reaching her ankles, and opened-toed sandals that have the letters "W.C." on them.

  </h2>
  <p key="ad7b1950-1f86-4b7b-ba18-2b13af3aee65">
   Izumi usually takes apparent pride in being a "simple, kind housewife" and calmly introduces herself as such to anyone who asks. Her humble exterior ironically belies a fearsome disposition though, with the Elric brothers becoming terrified at the thought of aggravating her, such as when someone calls her "old": She is prone to swift acts of violence and dealing out physical harm, often seen cracking her knuckles when she is angry or wants to intimidate.
  </p>
  <p key="651bf8c8-7f97-47fe-b77a-05c4b30c80ed">
   Though having a great deal of alchemical skill and faith in her alchemical power, Izumi frequently values the idea of working hard and only uses alchemy for things that cannot be done by hand, stressing to others that alchemists are humans and have their own ways. She also is very open-minded and quite curious, noticing differences but respecting them due to thinking all things/beings and their properties complement each other, which lead her to form the creed "One is All, All is One". Additionally, Izumi appears to greatly enjoy traveling as she is often found journeying outside her hometown, a trait she may have passed on to Edward.
  </p>
  <p key="55a96d9e-b443-4d49-93d0-96a34102695c">
   Despite her considerable aggressive nature, Izumi is a remarkably warm, caring individual always willing to help those in need, especially children. Wise and perceptive, Izumi is a great advocate of helping people to make their own way and will usually only intervene on behalf of those with the will—but not the means—to help themselves.

    Master Alchemist:
   </b>
   Though self-taught, Izumi is an extremely skilled and knowledgeable alchemist, excelling in both alchemical research and combat using the conscious manipulation of matter and natural energy. Her specific style of alchemy seems to focus more on her immediate surroundings and how to most conveniently use them to her advantage, from creating a wall to control the overflow of water, knocking out opponents by disrupting the flow of ions in their nerves, to restraining and punching individuals by manipulating earth and stone. She also shares Edward's preference for creating metal weapons in combat, such as forming large spears as well as wielding them with incredible proficiency. She is also capable of alchemically throwing spikes with enough force to topple a large column.

   Izumi braved the elements, nearly dying several times from the extreme cold, wild animal attacks, and assaults from Briggs Mountain Patrol. They even assumed that she was a

Though was captured, the rumor of a mysterious "mountain woman" raiding Fort Briggs would continue to circulate in the region for nearly twenty years.
  </p>
  <p key="714d6ea4-570d-4f86-ab0d-a549abbcbd69">
   After the month was up, Izumi ventured back into town and declared to Steiner that she was now fit to be his alchemy apprentice. However, the shocked man learned of his misunderstanding and told her that he was

   —the older brother of Silver Steiner, who had died several years before— and that he was known for hand-to-hand combat instead of alchemy. In great fury, Izumi assaulted him and knocked him unconscious, setting out to continue her alchemy training on her own. It may be inferred from this that she is a self-taught, yet extremely skilled and knowledgeable, alchemist.
  </p>
  <p key="3abf0f8c-fc1a-4bdf-81da-63ee69099db9">
   One day, Izumi bumped into a young Sig Curtis while dropping a bear she was carrying, which he picked up. According, to the two, it was love at first sight. Eventually, the two became closer, got married and moved to the southern town of Dublith. Once settled down there, Izumi finally got pregnant with Sig's child after numerous attempts, though the pregnancy was a very difficult one as she was constantly ill. Tragically, their child died during childbirth, rendering her deeply depressed and desperate enough to try to revive her stillborn child through Human Transmutation. Due to the teachings of the

   though, the "toll" Izumi was required to pay for opening the Gate resulted in some of her internal organs being removed, rendering her to be both constantly ill and completely incapable of ever becoming pregnant again.

  <p key="18ffdda5-325c-43fe-9f1e-68afa7fa5ae5">
   On a trip through the Eastern region of Amestris several years later, Izumi and Sig stopped in the small town of Resembool where torrential rains had caused the river to overflow and threaten to flood the village. She decided to intervene on behalf of the frantic villagers, thus transmuting a large earthen dam to corralling the overflow with ease. Grateful for her help, the people of

While there, Izumi was approached by two small boys named Edward and Alphonse Elric, who asked to be taken on as her alchemy apprentices. Though refusing first, she acquiesced a bit upon learning that the two boys were orphaned, thus instead offering a trial period in which to prove their worth as apprentices before making her final decision.

   When she returned in a month, Izumi was pleasantly surprised to find the boys not only in great shape, but having properly understood her alchemical creed. Fulfilling her promise, Izumi accepted them into her tutelage, instructing them in both alchemy and martial arts for six months before deeming them knowledgeable enough to return home and continue practicing on their own.

   After they explain how they used her instruction in an attempt to resurrect their dead mother which rebounded, taking Ed's left leg and right arm, as well as Alphonse's body as toll, and then joined forces with the State Military so as to receive access to restricted alchemical documents which may someday lead to their own restoration. After comforting them and lamenting that they made the same mistake that she did, Izumi expels them both from her tutelage for directly disobeying her prohibition of Human Transmutation. Of course, the expulsion renders the Elric brothers her colleagues rather than students, opening a new relationship for the three alchemists. Realizing this, the boys consult Izumi openly about ways to restore their bodies and she posits that Alphonse may have learned a great deal more from his sojourn into the Gate than either Edward or herself because Al gave his entire physical form as a toll rather than just a body part. But when Alphonse reveals that he has absolutely no recollection of seeing the Gate or the Truth, Izumi suggests that trauma-induced amnesia may be to blame and consults a doctor acquaintance while the boys make themselves at home in the Curtis household.

   Izumi is seen later when she receives a call from Edward, who spoke to her, at first vaguely regarding how what he's about to ask will hurt her, and if she didn't want to answer, she can hang up the phone, and even sever their teacher-student relationship (though Edward corrected himself in saying that she already did that before). When Izumi told him to just say it, Edward asked if she remembered about her failed attempt to transmute her child, which she said that she did and that she wouldn't ever forget it, recalling the event. When she asked what this was about, Edward revealed to her how their 'mom' that Edward and Alphonse had transmuted was not truly their mother. Confused by this, Izumi questioned him further, to which Edward finally asked if the child that Izumi transmuted truly her own child. At first she didn't seem to understand, but in an instant after, she understood Edward's meaning, and hung up the phone immediately.
  </p>
  <p key="2b66fd1d-391d-4249-80dc-76994a515e87">
   Izumi later called the hotel that Edward was staying in, having called Pinako earlier to get the number. When Edward answered her after being called by him earlier, Izumi explained that she researched her own and her husband's lineage, and further explained that when she transmuted her child, she had used her blood, her husband's hair, and her deceased child's bones. Izumi then states that the transmuted child had skin and hair color that was impossible for her or her husband, thus confirming further what Edward had been wanting to know.
  </p>
  <p key="2b438152-cfd7-48c3-addc-6d990120220a">
   When she stated that Edward found something out, Edward answered that he confirmed that a dead person could never be returned no matter what, which made Izumi understand that Alphonse was alive somewhere, which meant that he could be restored.
  </p>
  <p key="68fe70d5-32a9-442a-b1c5-0d0bff5477ed">
   Accepting that her 'perfect' theory was also a failure, as she had still believed that she had just been missing something for the transmutation back then, Izumi somewhat humorously stated that she as the master lost face to her student for that. When Edward attempted to apologize, she declined it, saying that it was a punishment for stepping into a territory she shouldn't have been in. After that, she thanked Edward before hanging up the phone, confusing the former student.
  </p>
  <p key="d277daf4-4aab-494b-b980-2943c1e0a531">
   Just as Alphonse was thankful to Edward to find out that they weren't forced to kill their mother a second time, Izumi was overcome with relief that she hadn't put her child through so much suffering a second time, crying from having been saved from the guilt that had been weighing on her all this time, once again recalling how the child she transmuted had died, and how she received the punishment that she deserved. She also mentioned the irony behind the punishment she received along with Edward and Alphonse's, stating that the Truth was cruel, but just.

   Izumi isn't again seen until midway through the story, when she and Sig are on a train and once again encounter her students' father, Van Hohenheim. After leaving the train, they talk about Hohenheim's sons and what they have been doing when Izumi's internal injuries cause her to cough up blood. Concerned, Hohenheim then proceeds to reach inside Izumi's body, rearranging her organs. Thinking that he stabbed Izumi, Sig furiously punches Hohenheim, knocking him a few meters. Asking his wife if she is alright, Izumi maintains that she is fine, and that she can actually breathe better. Finding out that the wound where Hohenheim stabbed her is gone, he states that he cannot bring back her organs because Truth took them, but he did manage to rearrange her damaged internal cavity in the most favorable arrangement possible. Izumi then fearfully asks Hohenheim what he is, to which he replies he's just a person named Van Hohenheim - the Human Philosopher's Stone. After this, Hohenheim presumably informs them both of everything that has been happening in the country, including the

      This is most likely a demonstration of how much Izumi's teachings influenced the boys' alchemy, as a number of vastly different circle configurations have been shown to be capable of opening the gate.

        (However that's mostly in the 2009 anime, the 2003 series is more consistent with its hexagon and heptagon designs and the manga is also consistent with its overlapping squares and pentagon designs. The fact that the 2009 anime has the same Human Transmutation Circle used by the boys in Trisha's transmutation as the 2003 anime creates a less consistent design overall the 2009 anime).

    In the Tale of Teacher short, she mentions she was still a virgin at the age of 18 and seems to have met her current husband while running to the Iron Tavern in the hopes of getting an apprenticeship with the master alchemist Mr. Silver Steiner (he was actually dead and Izumi met his brother) while holding a dead bear carcass.

    One of the things that makes Izumi a unique character is the hairstyle she usually wears: box braids. It is a hairstyle worn predominantly by Black women, where the hair is braided into intertwined strands hanging from the head, typically with braiding hair extensions. It's characterized by "boxy" or square-shaped hair divisions. The braids can also be styled (i.e. ponytail).

      In
      Tales of the Master
      (and
      The Tale of Teacher
      ), she does not have box braids.
