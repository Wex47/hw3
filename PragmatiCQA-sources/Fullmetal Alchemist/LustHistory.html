Also agreeing, the fake Cornello approached them from behind while Lust merely went on to comment that the intervention of the Elrics had been turned into something beneficial. Looking over to the priest, Lust asked how long he planned to remain in that form, only for the duplicate to respond that he was only going with the flow.

Rather than pursuing however, Lust decided that it would be better to report to Father about the Ishvalan and so the duo leave the scene.

   as Hughes' murderer, Mustang appears to kill the woman to avenge his friend, leading the two homuncli to believe he was now content and would no longer investigate them. While Lust berates Envy for agitating Mustang rather than controlling him, Envy merely replies that the dog took its bait and now the Colonel's own men may even be disgusted of him. They also discover that

   had been the one to assault the prison during Maria Ross' escape attempt. Asking Envy where he was, the younger homunculus replies that he doesn't know due to Barry being good at escaping and that they didn't have enough people. Looking over to one of the cages nearby, Lust replies that "he" was all they need, revealing the occupant to be Barry's living body.

   , Lust begins to comment that it was a shame she couldn't finish him off personally before being suddenly shot in the knee by the Colonel. Revealing her regenerative abilities, Lust berates them for thinking they could bring her to her knees before she is then shot multiples times again by Mustang, now through the head and shoulders.

  <p key="3c249a95-fe3f-4d6e-bf06-775395fe53c1">
   Regenerating again from these shots, Lust then compliments Havoc on being able to recognize what she is. "Rewarding" them for knowing so much, Lust uses her fingertips to open her own chest and reveal the Philosopher's Stone deep within her rib cage. Explaining that it was the core of all humans created by alchemy, Lust mentions that they also have feelings and as such love their creators. Deducing that she didn't plan to let them leave alive, Lust agrees and uses her extended fingernails to cut apart Mustang's pistol. Seeing him put on his alchemic glove, Lust immediately cuts apart the waterline above of them, dousing the Colonel and Havoc. Realizing the situation, both men then flee the room with Lust cutting apart everything in her way to get to them.

   Once outside the room, Mustang is moves to decompose the oxygen and hydrogen from the mass of water, leaving Havoc to throw in his lighter in order to ignite the gases. Their teamwork results in an enormous explosion engulfing Lust, apparently incinerating the homunculus entirely. Re-entering the room, the two survey the damage caused by the explosion. However Havoc lowers his guard, allowing Lust to pierce him from behind with her fingertips while hiding underneath some debris. Emerging, the homunculus then fully regenerates while telling the Colonel he wouldn't be able to save his subordinate.

   Refusing to give up, Mustang shoots Lust's chest open with Havoc's shotgun before charging at her. Mistaking his intentions, Lust berates him for thinking that would be able to kill her, only to then be shocked when Mustang buried his hand into her chest, ripping out her core and causing her body to turn to ash. Just as Mustang was about to use the stone to save Havoc, Lust begins to regenerate around the stone and his arm, telling him that it wasn't very gentlemanly of him to stick his hand in her chest. Impaling him with her fingertips as well, Lust reminds him that the stone was her core before dropping him to the ground and destroying his alchemic glove. Convinced both were on the verge of death, Lust then leaves the room while Mustang is left to desperately call out Havoc's name.

   . Asking the latter why he had joined forces with Mustang, Barry simply replies that it seemed like fun to do so, and also commenting that she was the one he wanted to cut up the most. Realizing Alphonse was there as well, Lust angrily expresses her frustration at having to kill two sacrificial candidates in one night. Annoyed by all the talk, Barry then charges at the homunculus only to be instantly cut down, his body reduces to scrap by a single swipe from Lust. Mentioning that she hated persistent guys, Lust then tells the Lieutenant that she would be sending her to the same place she had sent her superior moments ago.

   Realizing the meaning of her words, Hawkeye quickly loses her composure and fires a barrage of shots into Lust's body, depleting all of the ammunition she was carrying before breaking down in tears. Easily regenerating from the assault, Lust simply approaches the young woman with her fingertips extended. Blocking her path, Alphonse moves to protect the Lieutenant and transmutes a spear from the ground beneath them. Surprised that he was able to do so without a transmutation circle, Lust realizes that the armored boy must have seen the

   . Easily cutting apart his weapon, Lust is quick to impale him with all of her fingers. Calling him a confirmed sacrifice now, the homunculus instead directs her aim towards Hawkeye once more before Alphonse reaches out and blocks her other fingers with his left arm.

  <p key="c42cd4eb-3324-4c3d-ae59-8b6fdcd0ff3d">
   Swinging upwards, Lust viciously rips apart his armor just as someone speaks from behind her. Recognizing the new arrival, Alphonse quickly transmutes a large wall from the ground just before Lust is consumed by an inferno of flames. Brought to her knees, her assailant is revealed to be Mustang standing over her. Noticing his condition, Lust deduces that he was using a transmutation circle cut into his very skin and using the flame from Havoc's lighter as a fuel source. Set alight once more, Lust demands to know how he was capable of moving despite the injury she had dealt to him earlier. Holding his side, Mustang reveals to have cauterized the wound with repeated use of his flames, though comments he almost passed out several times.

   Continuing his assault on the homunculus, Lust's body is repeatedly burnt and left to regenerate before being scorched again. Inferring from her comment before, Mustang concludes that there must be a limit to her regeneration. Charging towards the Colonel, Lust makes one last attempt to kill the man and launches on of her fingertips directly at his forehead. However she is incinerated once more and her fingertip is stopped short of his head by mere centimeters, and this time failing to regenerate from the damage.

   Slowly turning to ash, Lust admits defeat and comments that she doesn't mind losing to a man like Mustang whose eyes were so cold and lacked hesitation. She then curses him by mentioning that she looks forward to the day when those same eyes become clouded by suffering. With these final words, her body and Philosopher's Stone are quickly reduced to dust, ending her life. Lust is the first Homunculus to permanently die (Greed, though melted down before Lust's death, was merely reabsorbed into Father's soul and returns later on in a
