   In keeping with her lineage as a natural-born Amestrian and scion of the long-standing Armstrong bloodline, Olivier is a beautiful pale-skinned woman who bears the trademark family traits as she has waist-length blond hair that is noticeably curled at the ends despite being otherwise relatively straight with parts of her hair covering her right eye while she is sometimes seen with a piece of hair strand resting on her left shoulder, light-blue or dark-blue eyes with long eyelashes and her lips are clearly defined and depicted as being rather full, which makes her one of only three characters in the series (the other two being

   Olivier is a severe woman who has a fearsome and commanding presence where she is harsh with her subordinates and peers and coldly merciless to her enemies, the deceptively beautiful woman's schadenfreude has earned her the nickname "Ice Queen" among the Briggs soldiers. Sharp-tongued and highly combative, Olivier is no stranger to furious chastisements and bursts of fiery violence, especially toward those who fail to live up to her high standards and staunch adherence to the "survival of the fittest" philosophy. As such, she has no tolerance at all for weakness or lack of willpower and fosters great distaste for the concept of "

   ", which she views as a mindset promoting easy handouts and unnecessary compromise. That being said, she is extremely perceptive and adaptive, able to coolly judge which courses of action will lead to the most beneficial results, and capable of thinking and acting on the fly in response to unpredictable or mutable circumstances.
  </p>
  <p key="6bcc40c6-60a1-4066-a4ce-e7c63b5f30c9">
   Skilled at reading people and conscious of even her own limitations, Major General Armstrong understands that she requires the support of her subordinates and peers in order to succeed and, though she understands that sacrifice is often a necessary part of her endeavors, never forgets the weight and impact that each person has on the world. As such, she takes her commanding role very seriously and has earned the undying loyalty of her men with her hands-on approach to leadership on and off the field of battle. While she cannot be said to have a "soft spot" for anyone, in particular, Olivier is a deceptively caring and selfless individual, prone to taking great risks in order to protect the lives and well-being of those who have placed their trust in her.

   . As such, she treats him with great disdain, denouncing him venomously in public and tearing up a letter from him unread. But privately she does not blame her brother for what he did considering it a act of bravery for what he did. Alex continues to look at his sister with great respect and appears to foster a slight sibling rivalry with her, but, in her presence, is frequently the subject of physical and verbal abuse. However, as the story enters its final arc, Olivier reveals that she has faith in her brother's strength and is happy to fight alongside him against their common foe. Because of this, her respect and trust for her brother are restored.

In the final arc, Armstrong was furious when she received the report confirming his death, but decided to press on and finish the mission for his sake. She later learned that it was with his sacrifice that

   . Olivier does not falter in the face of battle, hardly flinching when facing tough opponents like Sloth. She is also, like the rest of the Armstrong family, abnormally strong, and despite her slender appearance is able to easily throw Alex around. However, her inability to match Sloth's strength while Alex did means that Olivier merely outmatches Alex in sheer combat prowess, relying more on agility, speed, and combat skill as opposed to brute strength. Above all she is an excellent leader, not faulting at the suggestion of danger as well as making soldiers who were sent to kill her to work under her.
