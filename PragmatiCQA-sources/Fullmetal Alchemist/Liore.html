   to institute a sort of theocratic government with himself as the unquestioned ruler. Fashioning himself as a prophet of Leto, the solar god of Reole, and as a miracle worker, Cornello promised riches and everlasting life, even resurrection of dead loved ones, for those who followed him. Though the people of Reole believed he could truly perform miracles, Cornello was merely performing alchemy, using a small Philosopher's Stone, mounted on a ring he wore, to violate the

Some, like Rosé, refused to believe that God's purpose for humans was to turn them into an army of fanatics. Others believed in the false Cornello, remaining loyal to him. Civil war engulfed the city.

   Reole has little importance in the manga, and has not been mentioned very much after the very first story arc, which dealt with the downfall of Cornello. It has been mentioned is a short reference by Ed and the Briggs officers in chapter 67 to the wars in Amestris. It was revealed that Reole is a crest of blood, one of the points of intersection of the

Later, Reole was rebuilt by the effort of its citizens. In

She then used Scar to win the citizens to himself, using the alchemical powers of his right arm to perform "miracles" in the public plaza, just as Cornello had done before. He managed to convince people that he derived his power from Rosé, now called the Holy Mother, herself. Having gained the trust of Reole's citizens, Scar dug a massive transmutation circle through the whole city - a special array from the Grand Arcanum, an ancient form of alchemy secretly passed down among the

   The array used in Reole to transmute a true Philosopher's Stone once again gained the attention of the military, and this time, Ed was sent into the city to investigate, based on reports that Scar was in the city. Photos taken from the military's new hot-air surveillance balloon showed Scar's massive transmutation circle, which Ed recognized immediately as an array used to create the Philosopher's Stone. When Ed arrived, he confronted Scar and demanded that he destroys the array, expecting that Scar planned to use Reole's inhabitants as components for the Stone. Scar revealed that his plans did not involve using the citizens as components, but rather the soldiers currently surrounding the city. He gave the people strict instructions to not retaliate to anything the military did, thus forcing the military to come in of their own accord, so that the military would not be able to blame the people of Reole for starting the conflict. Then, once the military was inside the city, the citizens were to evacuate the city via a secret escape tunnel. The military, led by Colonel

   circle, wiping out almost the entire military contingent. The deaths, along with the numerous souls already trapped in Scar's right arm, were enough to complete the creation of the Philosopher's Stone, though it was not quite how Scar envisioned it. He had sacrificed his Right Arm of Destruction to stabilize Al's metal body, which the
