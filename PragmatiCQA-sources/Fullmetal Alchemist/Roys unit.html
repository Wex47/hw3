   - Jean is a regular, but capable soldier. Not particularly gifted in any field, he compensates for his lack of natural talent with dedication and effort. His character and loyalty have been proven to Mustang beyond the shadow of a doubt and, therefore, he has been made the Officer-in-Chief of Mustang's Unit, coordinating the work of Breda, Falman and Fuery (but not Hawkeye). Although he has no combat experience, Havoc is the most efficient officer in field missions after Hawkeye.

   . Interestingly enough, this metaphor is not randomly put, as the pieces of chess mirror each subordinate’s character, personality, role inside the unit and, perhaps most of all, his or her relationship with Mustang.

    King
   </b>
   . In chess, the king is the fundamental piece and represents the center of the game. It cannot be exchanged and one cannot attribute a value to it, since it would be infinite. The king is the only piece that cannot be played without and its loss represents the end of the game. A king can move to one empty or enemy-occupied square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) unless such a move would place the king in check. This means that the king cannot sacrifice himself and that one king cannot directly kill the opposing king. It can, however, be used in conjunction with other pieces to create a checkmate scenario. The king is commonly used as a symbol of wisdom, leadership and power.

    Queen
   </b>
   . The only unique piece in the board besides the king, the queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. It is the most versatile piece on the board and the one with the highest relative value. Being one of the most protected pieces, a queen's loss has grave consequences, a direct parallel to the importance Colonel Mustang attributes to the lieutenant.
  </p>
  <p key="f6ebee87-3ef0-40b4-88ed-dbd6fec760bb">
   In modern times, the queen is the only female piece on the chess board but in ancient times, the queen used to be a “male” piece called the "Counselor" (Ferz), reinforcing its characteristics of being the one closest to the king and its importance as the king’s guardian and advisor. This is another characteristic that can be used to define the role of Hawkeye and her relationship to Mustang. She is often seen being his voice of reason or discipline, and is occasionally the only person to whom he will listen. The queen is regarded as a symbol of purity, clearness of mind, and of conscientious decision for starting the game in the house of its own color: White Queen in the white square and Black Queen in the black square (the expression "The Queen gets her color" comes from this rule) – as well as for being the "King’s ferz".
  </p>
  <p key="09c5ba3a-38e6-4a52-9c4f-b4f773e6fb2c">
   The fact that Mustang refers to Hawkeye as “his queen” reinforces the common belief of them being a romantic pairing. It is further noted that when Mustang plays chess, he never sacrifices his queen if he can possibly help it, which also parallels Hawkeye's relation with that rank. As much as he goes to great lengths in a regular chess game to retain that particular piece, he is shown more than once to rush into action when "his queen" is endangered.

    Knight
   </b>
   . It is one of the most agile pieces of the chess board and is the only piece that can “jump over” other pieces to its destination square, regardless if the destination square is empty or enemy-occupied.
  </p>
  <p key="e3873624-5004-42b7-b5ea-a2c70434760b">
   This piece is always in the center of action and is more powerful when located close to the center of the board which mirrors Havoc, as he is always taking part in the action during missions. It is usually one of the first pieces to be played in game and represents both strength and impulse to action. The combination of the queen and a knight is also considered one of the most powerful in chess, a good parallel to Mustang's common strategy of using Hawkeye and Havoc in the field together and his belief that this pair is his "most effective combination".

    Bishop
   </b>
   . The bishop moves in diagonals, requiring great skill to use. Each bishop can only access half the squares of the board, which is an interesting parallel to Falman’s lack of ability in the field. Opposite to the knight, the bishop is more powerful the farthest it is from the center of the board, which is also a good parallel to Falman’s supportive role during missions.

  <p key="a2f21229-b77c-4915-a41c-d8cbbc7714f1">

    Rook
   </b>
   . The rook is a very sturdy, strong piece, moving horizontally or vertically, forward or backward, through any number of unoccupied squares. It is usually a piece players don’t move during the early stages of the game, but once the first rows from the board are clear (meaning, after the attack strategy is in place), becomes very powerful and with great ability to threaten the opponent’s pieces, not allowing them to move.
  </p>
  <p key="75d7f2e4-6a53-4a1d-8c34-dda18fb7b803">
   Like Breda, the rook usually plays a supportive role in chess, protecting the king while stronger/more active pieces like the queen and the knight attack the opponent. But it also can take the main floor of the board as a substitute to a bishop or even the queen, mirroring Breda’s capacities for both gathering information like Falman and operative jobs usually done by Hawkeye.

    Pawn
   </b>
   . The pawn is a very different piece on the chess board. Unlike all the other pieces, pawns may not move backwards and they capture in a different way than they move. It moves only forward one square at a time (except for their first move, where the pawn can move two squares), but captures in diagonal squares.
  </p>
  <p key="29968405-bdba-405c-bc1a-5ef1f3119c15">
   Like Fuery, the pawn is a very altruistic sort of piece, working to protect and aid those that are at his side. Attacking diagonally, they mirror the works of a soldier in a
   phalanx
   whose shield protected the soldier to their left and not themselves. Its usual task is to provide assistance to other pieces, protecting them while they attack. They are also the pieces that prepare the field for the other pieces' strategies to take place.
