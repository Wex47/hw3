   Though it is belied by his laid-back demeanor and his meat-headed appearance, 2nd Lt. Breda is more mentally alert than he lets on and possesses a remarkably keen intellect and strategic aptitude, having graduated at the top of his class from the military academy. Though those of his comrades who don't know him well take him for an imbecile, at first sight, he quickly proves his intelligence through his proficiency with strategy games such as

Described by Colonel Mustang as a "good team player", Breda's duties within Mustang's unit often involve helping the Flame Alchemist gather information and coordinate the movements and abilities of other members. Of Mustang's subordinates, to whom he once referred to as chess pieces, Heymans Breda is the rook.

   . Having been told by a civilian that the soldier apparently visited Tim earlier that day, which is impossible since that was his first time there, Breda immediately senses that something is amiss; so he barges in and finds the house forced into, ransacked and empty. Returning to Central with this new and distressing information, where Mustang told him that the shape-shifting homunculus was most likely the one who beat Breda at collecting Marcoh, Breda is unable to act on any more outside missions because his vacation time is all used up. Even after Havoc announces to his comrades that he's chosen to be discharged due to his injury, Breda visits his old friend in the hospital, bringing him muscle training equipment and free weights and telling him not to slack off and get soft.

    In the OVA "Kids", the young lookalikes of Edward, Alphonse, and Winry pass by a group of kids playing cards on a sidewalk. The kids resemble some of Mustang's men from the series, and one of them looks notably like a child version of Breda. This group seems to be playing some kind of card game, and the child Breda is grinning while the Mustang child hangs his head in shame.

    Mustang names all of his subordinates after chess pieces; Breda's is the "Rook".
