   , the stone gives the illusion that someone is able to override that law. Being that it is an illusion, the powers of the stone itself are not unlimited, and only appears to allow an alchemist to bypass equivalent exchange as long as the stone retains its power. Many of the main events in the series revolve around the Elric brothers' attempts to obtain this stone, in order to regain their original bodies, of whom had to be paid to the

This being the case, it may not always work while bringing a human back to life. If a solid body isn't present, it will not work and sacrifices will be made to substitute.

   It is never explained in the series the exact process of creating a Philosopher's Stone, but it is known that human souls of those who have passed can be trapped and condensed with certain transmutation circles. These thousands or perhaps millions of souls make up both the power and physical existence of a Philosopher's Stone. It is a frequent misconception that the properties of the stone itself allow someone to override the law of equivalent exchange, but this perception is simply an illusion. The power of the Philosopher's Stone allows one to perform feats greater than what one can do naturally, but the stone gets weaker every time it's used because that power comes from the souls, which get consumed in these transmutations. When all the energy is exhausted, the stone also ceases to exist. The raw material of the Philosopher's Stone is a very large number of human lives, ranging from only one human life, to a few dozens, to a few million, or perhaps even more.

   Generally believed to exist only in legend, the Philosopher's Stone has long been sought by alchemists as the ultimate goal of their craft. While alchemy is an amazing preternatural art in and of itself, its scientific limitations are such that the dream of a mystical and mythical object capable of eradicating those limits is one shared by generations of practitioners. Though in more pragmatic times, the legend of the Philosopher's Stone has come to exist only in the fanciful illusions of Romantics, the fabled amplifier is, in fact, an arcane reality.

    The Philosopher Stones break apart and vanish when they are used up; rarely, they will expel a massive rebound just before (as in Cornello's case). Though in the case of a human who is a living Philosopher Stone, they will rapidly age and show transmutation marks on their body.

    It is interesting to note that in the manga/2009 anime, Van Hohenheim, being a human Philosopher's Stone, seemed to be able to use more power from his stone than anyone else, due to having individualized each and every one of the 536,329 souls within himself. The power seemed to be so great that Van was able to block several energy blasts from Father which impressed him.

      This could indicate that while the souls inside the stones are able to amplify alchemic abilities, when the souls are individualized, the energy that each soul willingly share are of a much greater quality than if they were as a mass collection of souls with no true wills.

    Because every human has a soul, each human is technically a Philosopher's Stone, allowing a highly gifted Alchemist to use their own soul to fuel transmutations. However, doing so is believed to shorten the Alchemist's lifespan.
