   Due to its northern climate and mountain altitude, the Briggs mountains in the northern region are snowy year-round, creating a landscape that is described by some as consisting entirely of black and white, but in the winter especially, the already fickle temperatures fall well below zero into frostbite-inducing or hypothermic territory and terrible blizzards roll in frequently without warning. With conditions like these, human habitation is clearly impossible - at least in normal or extended terms - but the frigid sierra is not entirely devoid of life. While flora appears sparse, some species of coniferous evergreens thrive in abundance in the low-to-mid altitudes and the Briggs ecosystem is home to several animal species as well - including eagles, small rabbits, mountain deer, wolves and Briggs Mountain grizzly bears, which are nationally infamous for standing roughly three meters tall on their hind legs.
