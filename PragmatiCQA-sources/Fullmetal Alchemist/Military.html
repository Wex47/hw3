Some soldiers can be seen wearing blue berets. The epaulets on the uniform display the rank of the soldier in question. When entering foreign or dangerous terrain, white coats, hats, and gloves are generally seen adored by soldiers to aid in harsh climates. Police guards generally wear a black version of the uniform to distinguish themselves as special service guardsman. However, individuals with special expertise and services are not required to wear the military uniform, as seen with the case of

   The Amestrian military generally utilizes rifles, pistols, automatic machine guns, and artillery mortars in times of combat or war. Most of their weapons bear resemblance to those used during WWI such as German Lugers, M1911s, Enfield No.2 Snubnose, Mosin-Nagant, machine guns, trench mortars, diminutive FT-17 tanks, and planted landline explosives using dynamite.

   The military is strictly an infantry army-based format, lacking both naval and air-based forces and relying on potent ground-based attacks to counteract enemy forces. The nonexistence of aerial vehicles and the landlocked nature of the country preclude the need for a marine force for force projection from an ocean or sea, or a navy to provide assistance to the marines or to battle other nations in naval warfare. The Army divisions are generally spread out around various fields of battle or stations in different territories of Amestris and no Amestrian bases are known to be stationed outside of Amestrian territory.

The Human Chimeras that are deemed "successes" by the State Military belong to two categories as well. There are those with entirely human outward forms whose internal makeups have incorporated increased senses, versatile physical structures, and abilities identical to the animals with which they have been alchemically spliced, granting them superhuman traits while maintaining an inconspicuous shape. The other category is the form which the military seems to have accepted as their ultimate success in regards to the creation of human chimera is that which is capable of transforming from full human form to that of a man-beast hybrid and back at will.

   The Amestrian State Military has many similarities to the Prussian (and later, German Empire's) military, more so than the Nazis as was previously stated in the trivia. Some of these include:

   <li key="6eb3bcf5-2442-4d53-9ba1-235584bd2d39">
    Standard blue uniforms for Amestrian soldiers.

    The fourragere is usually worn around the left shoulder and arm. However, its design and signification were different before 1870. As there is a confusion with the aiguillette, which can be worn on the right side too, it is also possible Arakawa chose to put the fourragere on the right shoulder to balance the design of the uniform.

    As Voltaire once said of the Prussians, "Most states have a military, but the Prussian military has a state." This certainly applies to Amestris, as the military's commander is the ruler of the government, as opposed to the other way around.
   </li>
  </ul>

   There are also similarities to Nazi Germany, though the styles of the uniforms, and the years the manga and series are set in suggest the primary influence was Prussia and the German Empire they controlled. Most similarities between Amestria and the Nazi regime are due to similarities between Prussia and its post-war successor.
