  <p key="ced7bd2d-1dfd-48bb-a559-f45fbeefc297">
   Gluttony, although under normal circumstances is quite docile, is easily prone to bouts of frenzy in which he uncontrollably tries to eat whatever crosses his path, usually someone he has been given permission to eat; which as a result, in both the manga and anime, causes him to frequently ask Lust (or any other Homunculus that he is partnered with) if he can eat them beforehand. He even asks this question to the people he is fighting at that moment. He particularly likes eating people and even mentions to
   Wrath
   that he prefers eating girls (as he finds them soft and tasty). Despite his hunger-fueled moments of frenzy, Gluttony is very childlike and is surprisingly kindly, demonstrating several times a great love for his siblings (greeting the reborn Greed enthusiastically and showing immense sorrow upon word of Lust's death) and even respects

   . Gluttony also does not appear to share any of his siblings' disdain for humans, and appears to be unaware that the people he eats die permanently. Because of his childishness, lack of self-control and apparent innocence, Gluttony's intelligence is thus limited in regards to usefulness for his siblings and thus has to be 'babysat' by his more aware siblings. He also seems to share a close bond with his older sibling

   whom he, prior to her death, was frequently partnered with. He did have mild awareness though and could hold a grudge, evidenced by his rage and desire to kill Roy Mustang for murdering Lust. In addition, he seemed to have a good memory, instantly remembering Lan Fan while she attacked him despite not being able to see him and quickly recognizing Edward, Alphonse and the others by scent (it is implied his memory is tied to his ability to smell).

   However, there are some noticeable differences in this continuity, Gluttony is very close to Lust and when learning from Edward that she was killed by Wrath, he becomes extremely depressed to the point of moping around constantly until his eventual lobotomization by Dante. After becoming the pure sin of Gluttony, his personality made a drastic change - becoming a mindless eating machine that would attack anyone if they got to close (Dante warns Envy of this new behavior), although this new instinct had made him lose any recognition skills since he attacked Dante on the elevator.

   Gluttony was the result of a failed experiment by Father to create a new Gate of Truth through which he could access the whole of alchemical knowledge. As such, the eye that appears in the expanse of Gluttony's stomach (also enlarging his mouth) when he morphs to his true form is nearly identical to that behind the true Gate, but the space within him is pitch black and everything that has amassed from his eating habits just piles up inside. Due to this, Gluttony's Gate is in a space that lies between reality and the Gate and is full of all the objects he has eaten within a massive sea of his victims' blood. The only way for a living person to escape is to transmute themselves and another any other person who was swallowed without altering anything. This will cause the real Gate of Truth to open and entering from Gluttony's Gate may circumvent the negative repercussions of Human Transmutation and create a bridge back to their reality.

   In the first anime, Gluttony's personality and appearance is identical to that in the manga, but his origins are altered. He is not a false Gate of Truth, and as such he cannot open his ribcage and swallow anything quite so easily. Of the seven Homunculi, Gluttony is the least developed, and almost nothing is known of his presumed previous life as a human. As mentioned in episode 50, Gluttony was created by Dante for the purpose of manufacturing the red stones, as the souls of the people he eats will be condensed into such. He is one of the older Homunculi, being older than the current Pride, Lust,

   , but is younger than Envy and Greed. Of the six others, as in the manga, it is Lust whom Gluttony cares about the most, much more so even than in the manga, and almost always appears alongside her, willing to do exactly as she says. Gluttony suffers from the constant desire to eat, which may contribute to his supposed desire to become human. After Lust's death, Dante removes Gluttony's humanity, retaining only the sin's essence: to eat. She did this because his grief over Lust was annoying her and he was unable or unwilling to eat (and, through this, to purify the Stone)  Dante's act ultimately backfires when he later consumes her.

   During an off-screen time-gap between the end of the 2003 anime series and the movie, Gluttony remained in the underground city and transformed into a large, multi-limbed monster, apparently due to eating the buildings/dirt or devouring Dante and the large amount of stolen lives within. Gluttony, even since being turned mindless by Dante, still holds enough recognition skills to exclusively attack Wrath (Lust's killer) during the movie, giving Al an easy opportunity to use Gluttony to create a gate to the other world. Although he is still transmuted, he is shown to have become quite formidable, and almost defeated Wrath. He and Wrath die at the same time and are the fifth and sixth of the Homunculi to die.

    movie, Gluttony's form makes reference to the three-headed worm like monster, Cerberus, from the Divine Comedy in the chapter Canto VI. The monster was a worm-like monster with three heads that also ate dirt as well as the Gluttonous, surviving in a place with nonstop storms and rain.

    Whenever Gluttony activated his Defective Portal of Truth in the 2009 anime and manga, he was always very angry (not counting the time his Portal was forced open by Ed for himself, Envy and Ling's escape). Whether this is a coincidence or his anger is a necessity to activate the form is unknown.

    Gluttony and Sloth both share the same type of eyes; rather than an iris or a normal shape, they are very tiny and blank in color. Perhaps not coincidentally, since both Homunculi share similar mentalities.

    In the English Dub of the 2003 series, Gluttony spoke in a soft almost growl-like tone (similar to people who get irritated when they're hungry); in season four, Gluttony starts speaking in the same tone later used in the 2009 series.

    In both the manga/Brotherhood and 2003 anime storylines, Gluttony was created specifically to be used as a means to an end, but winds up being unsuccessful in both cases.

      Dante made Gluttony with the intent of having him consume red water and human flesh and allowing it to condense into a Philosopher's Stone inside his body, thus bypassing the need for alchemy and the risks that came with it. (This is also why she made him such a simpleton and made it possible to take his mind away; such a tool doesn't need intellectual depth, it just needs to be hungry.) Although she didn't succeed as hoped, she was still able to use him to condense Al's Philosopher's Stone body down to a more manageable size without using alchemy and wasting the stone's power.

    Due to his nature, Gluttony is often paired with his fellow Homunculi; first and longest with Lust, then with Wrath, then Envy, and lastly, Pride.

      His pairing with Lust and Wrath may have been a reference to the medieval legend of John of Beverley who was tested by God by sending an angel and forced him to choose between three sins: Gluttony, Lust, or Wrath. The man chose Gluttony believing it was the least harmful, but Gluttony was both lustful and wrathful.

    His power to create a false gateway might be a reference to Gluttony being called a gateway sin as best shown in the legend of John of Beverly, as explained above.
