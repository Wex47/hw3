   for generations, having played vital roles in financial, military, and political circles within Amestrian society for 180 years. They are all extremely honorable and hold their family status with great pride often boasting about their noble history which is clearly shown with their eccentric actions. They are all gifted with impeccable strength and the marvelous (yet eerie) glow of their pride can always be seen by those around them, usually seen with a sparkle around their faces. In addition, the Armstrong family boasts a lasting military history, having many members serve as high-ranking officials such as generals across the generations. The family seal is made to resemble the curled forelock shared by all members as well as a similarly curled mustache.
