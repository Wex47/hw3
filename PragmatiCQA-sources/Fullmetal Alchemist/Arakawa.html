   Hiromi Arakawa (荒川 |弘美) was born in Tokachi, a sub-prefecture in the northernmost island of Japan,
   Hokkaido
   . Her family owned a dairy and potatoes farm and Hiromi was raised there along with several sisters. As a teen, she helped her parents at the farm chores and played on the fields. She said manga had always been among her hobbies and that she read and collected manga of all genres, but was partial to
   Weekly Shōnen Jump
   and
   Weekly Shōnen Sunday
   (a magazine to which Arakawa now has a contract, publishing the manga Silver Spoon).
   Kinnikuman
   was one of her favorite manga. As a child, Arakawa dreamt of discovering what was beyond the farms and looked up to the mangaka profession (manga writer) as being ideal, “light” and carefree.

   She went to an agricultural high school and, as she graduated, agreed with her parents she would help them at the farm for 7 years and, in this meantime, would take regular oil painting lessons at town. As that period ended, she moved to Tokyo to pursue her dream of becoming a mangaka and swore to her parents she would only return home once she was able to make a living out of manga. 
Arakawa started working with manga making
   doujins
   with her friends, one of the most known being

   Hero Tales

   One of the first paid jobs Arakawa had as a mangaka was making short comics (the otherwise known as 4koma) for a magazine called Gamest, where she made parodies of the games portrayed in the issues of the magazine. At the time, she used the alias
   <i key="fb212168-d5db-4427-a1d9-8ec2cdf41716">

   . After that, she was accepted as an assistant to the mangaka Etō Hiroyuki, known for his manga
   Mahōjin Guru Guru
   .

   Her first professional solo manga was Stray Dog (1999), a one-shot that was published by
   Enix
   after winning the “9th 21st Century Shounen GanGan Award” contest. The winning of this contest also resulted in a contract with Enix, and the publisher branch,
   GanGan
   , was, thereafter, publishing most of her works.

   , aka Fullmetal Alchemist, started to be published in August 2001 and had regular monthly chapters up to its finale, in June 2010. Initially, it was regarded by the critics with disinterest, but it rapidly gained popularity by its quality and thickness of plot. The success of the manga has rendered two animated series and an extensive franchise. It has also rendered Arakawa one of the most prestigious awards given to a mangaka in Japan: the

   Married and mother of two children, Arakawa has secured a contract with
   Shogakugan's
   Weekly Shōnen Sunday
   in 2011 and is currently publishing the first non-fantasy series of her career,
   Silver Spoon
   . Regarded at first with suspicion (and even discontent) by her most hardcore fans for not falling in the "fantasy" category, Silver Spoon has gathered growing attention from the media and critics. As of April 2012, it had 2.5 million copies printed, a number greatly aided by the winning of the 5th Manga Taisho Award. It was recently announced that Silverspoon is receiving an anime adaptation by Aniplex.

   Arakawa's self-portrait is usually that of a bespectacled cow, as she was born and raised on a dairy farm. This choice of an alter-ego says much about Arakawa's unpretentious (yet consistent) style in writing. She usually tends to write about everyday events with an emphasis on people's feelings, world-views, and conceptions/misconceptions, but tends to permeate it with humor and jokes, to make it entertaining and accessible.

   For Fullmetal Alchemist manga, Arakawa had read alchemy-related books, which she found very complicated due to the fact that some books contradicted others. Arakawa was attracted more by the philosophical aspects than the practical aspects. For the Equivalent Exchange concept, she was inspired by the work of her parents who had a farm in Hokkaidō and always had to give all their effort in order to earn the money to eat. 
Arakawa wanted to integrate social problems into the story. She gathered information watching news programs and talking to people, such as refugees, war veterans and former yakuza. Several plot elements expand on these themes, such as

   , Arakawa was inspired after reading about Europe during the
   Industrial Revolution
   period; she was amazed by how different the people from different countries were, in terms of their culture, architecture and clothes. She was especially interested in England during this period and "added to it her own original flavor to turn it into a fantasy world".

  <p key="9f7eddc6-64f0-4fbc-945b-8e15cbad281b">
   When the manga began serialization, Arakawa had in mind how the story would end. As the plot continued, however, she felt some characters were maturing and decided to change some scenes, resulting in some sketches of the faces of the characters were improvised. In creating the characters' designs, she comments that the manga authors
   Suihō Tagawa
   and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations, and describes her artwork is a mix of both of them. Arakawa made comedy central in the manga because she thinks it is intended for entertainment, and tried to minimalize focus on sad scenes.

From a recent episode, I would have to say volume 7, the end of chapter 27. The interaction of "Who the hell are you!?" "I'm a housewife!!!!!" That's a scene that I wanted to do for a long time." (Perfect Guidebook 1; Fullmetal Alchemist Profiles) on a side note apart from the scene being in Chapter 27 (towards the end, page 42) she also did a similar scene in Chapter 83 (page 24) of FMA.

    "I always draw ridiculous looking self-portraits for this series, so I have a really hard time when I need to draw one for other magazines. It's regrettable how they always use the "underwear" picture from volume one. Really regrettable." (Hiromi Arakawa, 2004)

    "I've been very touched by letters from young boys and girls in the hospital, or even from adults who tell me that they felt better after reading Fullmetal Alchemist," she says. "Reading manga gave me hope as a kid, and it makes me so happy to think that now I've been able to cheer people up with my own manga! It's such an honor, it really is." (Newtype USA January 2006)

    I like
    B movies
    . I take a look at this and that, while thinking, "What the hell is this!? This makes no sense!" till the end. I like that sort of feeling. So an alchemy manga was born because I wanted to have that kind of feeling in my manga. Thanks to everyone who bought it. While getting into it and thinking, "What is alchemy supposed to be like this?" Please enjoy it.(Fullmetal Alchemist Volume 1)

    I left home, and I wasn’t going back until I could make a living on manga. I’m happy that my wish was granted and that I’ve gotten a series, but now I’m busy and have no time to go home. I’m kind of happy and kind of sad.(Fullmetal Alchemist Volume 2)

    Apparently, when my neighbor's 3-year-old daughter found out that I'm a manga artist, she said with a sparkle in her eyes, "I wonder if she draws princesses and stuff?" Sorry little girl, I only draw grubby old men. (Fullmetal Alchemist Volume 6)

    The self-portraits that I draw here are usually not up to scratch, so when magazines do author profiles, it becomes quite a hassle. Repeatedly using the "Fighting Panties" from Volume 1 makes me feel regretful. Very regretful.(Fullmetal Alchemist Volume 8)

    A few friends that also drew manga gathered at the pub regardless of the fact did we drink any alcohol, we would talk excitedly about manga. We will get so preoccupied with the topic, that we always miss the last train. Although we all have the feeling, "We’re so old already, why are we still mucking around like this?" But whenever we hear something like “I want to draw this!!”, the passion from everybody, our spirits are refreshed with new enthusiasm. This time I even got Moritaishi Sensei to draw the omake for me. Wah!! (Happy)(Fulmetal Alchemist Volume 9)

    The cover for Volume 9 seems to be very well liked. I received many letters discussing their opinions regarding it. "Follow me! That’s what it is trying to convey!!" or "Men speak with their backs!!" or "It’s like saying everybody’s fate is resting upon my back, what a great cover!!" and stuff like that. ... Can’t bear to say "It’s because drawing the colonel’s face is really troublesome" ... Can’t say it ...(Fullmetal Alchemist Volume 10)

    This happened when I went for a massage after finishing the drafts for the manga. Because I was really sleepy, I was thinking drowsily about "How should the next chapter develop?", when the masseuse suddenly commented: "Your right shoulder is really tight." I unwittingly answered "That’s because it’s automail." Getting confused between the manga and reality…!!" (Fullmetal Alchemist Volume 11)

    Due to a lack of real publicity photos of Arakawa, a great sum of her fanbase has no idea what she really
    looks like, even to this day. There are some scarce pictures of the real Arakawa in the web, but they are very low in quality and are rarely used as reference. Many fans have mistaken photos of

    Arakawa's birth name is "Hiromi"; Hiromu is reportedly a masculine pen-name she uses in order to avoid putting off shonen readers, akin to "J.K. Rowling".

    Some themes are recurrent in Arakawa's works, especially themes referring to redemption, guilt, coming of age, prejudice (and the overcoming of such prejudice) and others. There are also references that appear in more than one piece, such as the term "Stray Dog", some characters' lines and physical resemblance, chapter titles as well as small jokes and Easter eggs.

    Arakawa is married and has three children: a boy (2008), an unknown gender child born in September 2011 and another child born in early 2014. Her husband and her older child appear in 2011 July's issue of Noble Farmer. She mentions a trip she took with her family to her parents' farm and the first try both her husband and son had of natural milk.
