   While the synthesis of the chimera is an accepted, albeit rare and elusive branch of alchemy, the concept of extending its mutative hand to the realm of human characteristics and abilities falls under
   Human Transmutation
   and is therefore strictly banned as a practice under the authority of the military. On the other hand, though there are alchemists who flout this decree and step across the threshold into monstrous experimentation, it has been publicly stated that all illicit attempts to create a

   has been accredited with the creation of the first chimera capable of human speech, but it died soon after creation because it refused to eat, but the truth of the matter is that his creation was actually a crude human chimera created in secrecy and passed off as an advanced standard chimera to achieve his state certification. It was only during his second attempt at this that his transgressions were brought to the government's attention. However, the State Military itself has been experimenting with synthesizing human chimera in secret laboratories for some time, with limited success. The worst part of it is that Tucker used his wife and later, his

   Human chimera similar to those created by Shou Tucker are marked as failures by the military, having very little social ability and significantly warped forms while experiencing high levels of physical pain due to having internal systems that are incomplete or otherwise insufficient for maintaining their new hybridized bodies; still, having been human at one point, their souls and memories remain largely intact, despite a limited ability to convey their feelings and thoughts to other humans. A step above these complete failures are the chimera that maintain much of their original human forms but with added physical traits that enhance their physical abilities while often making them incapable of blending in with society as normal human beings.
  </p>
  <p key="e2873d08-21c5-454a-82f0-f8f13f9df62b">
   Human chimera that are deemed "successes" by the State Military belong to two categories as well. There are those with entirely human outward forms whose internal makeups have incorporated increased senses, versatile physical structures, and abilities identical to the animals with which they have been alchemically spliced, granting them superhuman traits while maintaining an inconspicuous shape. However, the form the military seems to have accepted as their ultimate success in regards to the creation of human chimera is that which is capable of transforming from full human form to that of a man-beast hybrid and back at will.
