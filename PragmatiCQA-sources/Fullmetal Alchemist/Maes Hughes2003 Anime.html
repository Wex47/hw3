   ). He also introduced his wife Gracia to Edward and his brother Alphonse during their stay at Shou Tucker's home in Central for the State Alchemy exams. He invited the Elrics and Tucker's daughter Nina to his home for Ed's birthday, but was forced to seek help in a blizzard when Gracia went into labor. While Hughes was out, the Elrics and Nina helped deliver his daughter Elicia. After this, Hughes became good friends with the Elrics and helped them as often as he could, most notably assisting Ed with his investigation into Tucker's research. Not long after this, Hughes was called to investigate the scene of Nina's murder and assisted Ed in his attempt to track down

   , right down to the Ouroboros mark. Barely surviving, Hughes is only saved by the timely intervention of 2nd Lt. Ross. He flees the building with her, in order to contact Mustang from a public telephone booth. His reason behind calling Mustang directly is to give him information that the Homunculi have infiltrated the top Military ranks and that his life may be in danger. As Mustang is on a train to Central, Hughes is unable to contact him. Hughes then confronts Ross, grabbing out his knife and putting it next to the side of her neck, telling her that the real Ross has a minuscule mole under her left eye.

Hughes turns to leave, but the imposter gets up and transforms into Gracia. Hughes hesitates to attack, and the imposter uses the opportunity to fatally shoot him. Hughes is posthumously promoted to Brigadier General, ironically attaining a higher rank than Mustang, although the latter later does gain the same rank. His death is stated as 1915 in this series, as opposed to 1914 in both the manga and 2009 series.
