After moving to Rush Valley to work with Garfield, Winry wears a black zipped crop top with white stripe on the center.

   Winry is cheerful, strong-willed, bubbly, hot-headed and empathetic. She loves everything about automails and mechanic, and always puts all her heart and effort into her work. She also loves her patients and is always ready to help them. Due to her love and full knowledge about automails, Edward often calls her a "engineering otaku" or a "crazy gearhead", while she always calls him "an otaku alchemist" in response. Usually she always hates when Ed brokes her automail and often uses her wrench as a weapon which always makes Ed and Al fear for her rage. Dedicated to her work and her friends, Winry works with almost excessive devotion on the various automail whose maintenance she undertakes for the sake of the people who depend on her, going so far as to take multiple consecutive overnight workshop sessions and travel long distances without hesitation in order to ensure their prompt and proper completion.  While she has good intentions, Winry can be stubborn and straightforward, often calling others out for their weaknesses and delusions, but she also offers emotional support to her friends when they need it.

She also hated to see her two best friends taking the burden of their mistakes on their own. When

She is very compassive, empathetic and sensitive, and often is seeing crying or getting openly emotional towards others, something that she does not have a problem with expressing it, even thought Edward calls her a "crybaby" jokingly.Winry also hates putting her friends in danger or akward situations because of her, getting mad or dissapointed at herself

   Due to her cheerful and bubbly attitude, Winry is admired by other people, seeing her as a charming and sweet person, to the point that they seem to get in love with her for a little moment. Winry is also admired by her patients and they prefer when she is the one to attends them instead of Garfield. In many occasions she is seen to be indifferent about the theme of love, being open with her reason to reject Alphonse in her childhood, and also, she is clear an relaxed with the fact that she has romantic feelings for Edward, and is seen teasing him when he akwardly realizes that he loves her too. Even though, she is seen getting flustered when Edwards confesses to her at the end of the series.

   -After losing his right arm and left leg, Winry took on the role of his personal automail mechanic, building him sophisticated new limbs  when she was eleven years old. Since then, Winry has served as Ed's constant well of support, both mechanically and emotionally, though they still find themselves arguing frequently due to their stubborn and hot-headed personalities. However, this affectionate hostility appears to be masking a deeper relationship. Though Edward has not outwardly admitted any romantic feelings toward Winry, he is rather overprotective of her and becomes unnaturally flustered at the mere suggestion of an amatory relationship between them. Winry, for her part, has admitted to herself that she had been falling for him all along. Edward also says in various ocassions that he hates seeing Winry crying and he blames himself whenever it happens, which is something aknowledged by Winry, as she promises him that she will not cry by sadness again. They finally confess to each other at the end of the series as Edward proposes to her, although they use The Law of Equivalent Exchange to do so. According to the Fullmetal Alchemist Chronicle (Official Guide), they get married in 1917 and have many children in the end, showing both an unnamed daughter and son.

   - Alphonse appears to be the little brother Winry always wanted.  While Al remarks on the fight both he and Edward had over which one of them would marry her, Winry doesn't appear to have regarded those feelings as being too deep, as she is very casual about how she turned down both brothers' affections at the time.  However, Winry does seem to be the one person other than Edward who is most affected by Al's intangible state as a soul bound to a suit of armor. She also seems to unquestioningly regard Al as human, despite the doubts others sometimes express about that. She is both protective and defensive of Al's humanity, and cries openly for his pain as well.

   , Winry has always had a close relationship with her grandmother, but since the tragedy that befell the Rockbell homestead, Pinako has served as Winry's sole caretaker and closest - if not only - blood relation. The two have a relatively amicable relationship, ribbing each other every so often as they go about their days jointly running their automail atelier, but the bond between them remains as that of doting grandparent and adoring grandchild. When Winry finally sets out on her own path as an automail engineer, Pinako worries silently that the greater world will be too hard on her little Winry, but is very proud when she sees and hears evidence of the young woman's progress. Conversely, Winry worries about leaving her grandmother alone and communicates with her regularly, knowing that there will always be a place for her at home in Resembool if she should so require.

   In addition, Winry appears to have a remarkable wealth of surgical knowledge for her age (despite a lack of formal training), gleaned from having grown up in a family of surgeons. Edward remarks that Winry's early comprehension of advanced medical literature is on par with the familiarity with alchemical texts shared by the Elric brothers when they were young. She successfully delivered Ridel and Satella's child in the 2009 anime, further proving her medical knowledge.

    Ed and Winry's romantic relationship is heavily implied in the FMA series and the relationship is confirmed during end of the manga as the two end up together with children, which is one of the most popular FMA pairings. It's also known as "Edwin". Apparently, the number "503" was also previously used as a name for this pairing, based on a brand of jeans of the same number by a company called Edwin. "503" was also the number of Winry's hotel room when she visit Ed and Al in Central.
