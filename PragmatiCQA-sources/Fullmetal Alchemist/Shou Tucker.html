   , though Tucker's wife was said to have left the family two years before. Tucker explains to the Elrics that bio-alchemy, especially in the field of chimeric research is experimental at best and results in a large number of failures and false starts. Tucker himself notes that, ever since the speaking chimera that earned him his license, he has yet to present an alchemical breakthrough worthy of his yearly State Alchemist assessment and fears that a failure this year will cost him his certification and research privileges.

   When Tucker reveals to the Elric brothers that he has finally managed to create another speaking chimera, Edward quickly perceives that Tucker has bypassed the impediments of artificially creating a being capable of comprehending and vocalizing speech by instead alchemically merging a live human with an animal - in this case Nina and Alexander and in the previous case, his wife.

   Tucker coldly confirms Edward's gruesome suspicions, to which Edward responds violently. The Sewing-Life Alchemist taunts and gaslights Fullmetal between blows, stating that the two alchemists are alike in their sacrilege - that Edward's attempt to steal his mother's life back from the grave and Tucker's use of his family's lives to further his research are both indicative of scientific minds that seek knowledge despite any preconceived taboos attached.

  <p key="e3be37e5-1770-4614-aa65-8dbaa337c64e">
   Shou has the appearance of a bespectacled middle-aged man, having little in the ways of muscle or height and his receding hairline leaving him only with a small amount of brown hair, and a slight beard stubble. He has only been shown wearing a single outfit, that of a faded green open-collared shirt with sleeves that he keeps rolled up to his elbows, and a second black shirt underneath. When around others he maintains a mildly content expression, however in private he is often more downcast and anxious and is notably depicted as such in his title card caption in the 2009 Anime.

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="ae1f5332-b46c-4908-959c-c4a75712dffb">
   Shou initially comes off as a soft-spoken but asocial man, often preferring to keep to himself rather than spend time with others. When having guests, he does put on a polite persona and appears to be quite gentle, friendly, and kind. However, as his daughter Nina had begun to notice, he was more often engrossed with his work than his family.
  </p>
  <p key="1e494f56-af25-437d-8662-4abe05aa658e">
   In reality, Shou suffered from a lack of confidence due to his research not producing any viable results and is a very desperate, delusional, selfish, and manipulative man devoid of any sort of conscience. In order to get his qualification as a State Alchemist, he was willing to sacrifice his wife and later his own daughter in order to maintain it from fear of returning to a life of poverty and regret. After his atrocities were unveiled, Shou showed a notable lack of remorse for his actions and instead claimed it was merely the advancement of science, focused solely on remaining a State Alchemist.
  </p>
  <p key="07beda5a-79d6-4093-8c8e-764a64f92a38">
   Shou has no genuine empathy for others' feelings and is unable to understand any perspective different from his own. While he intellectually understood that others would be enraged if they found out the truth behind his experiments—hence his lying to Nina and the Elric brothers that his wife abandoned them—he didn't understand why, and believed that any other alchemist would have done the same thing he did if they were in his financial situation. As a result, Ed's violent reaction to finding out that Shou had turned his own wife and daughter into chimeras took him by surprise.
