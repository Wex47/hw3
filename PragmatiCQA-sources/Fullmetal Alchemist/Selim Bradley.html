   When first introduced under the guise of Selim Bradley, Pride acts as if he has the mannerisms of a usual young boy, displaying a proneness to hero worship. He displays great admiration and respect for his "father",
   King Bradley
   , at one point writing a glowing report about him for a school project. He also seems fanatically interested in the Elric Brothers, reacting with giddy excitement upon meeting them. Sometimes he reveals part of his true personality, such as when he calls

  </p>
  <p key="9cf4da03-9b76-4717-9648-1a4f24dd4ca6">
   Much of his positive traits vanish when he reverts to his Pride persona. His true personality is similar to Father's. He tries to act superior to humans by pretending they are insects for him, filling himself with false dignity and futile boastfulness. However, whereas Father treats humans with a bored or apathetic attitude (probably because Father is slothful), Pride treats humans like playthings/slaves. He loves the honor of being a Homunculus the most, and encourages his siblings to feel contempt towards all non-homunculi. Pride is also extremely arrogant in battle. He quickly resorts to petty taunts and insults against opponents. He is also shown to be extremely cruel, as shown when he ruthlessly killed his own brother

  </p>
  <p key="46698d59-ff04-4a20-9ff7-9e0ff23e5490">
   He has great faith in his immense strength, feeling that he can overcome any opposition, no matter how powerful, and this often causes him to underestimate his opponents. He sees humans as pathetic weaklings, inferior beings "of no importance."
  </p>
  <p key="fa5bd6ed-129a-4937-802b-d4b15735d8ac">
   He is very biased, always coming up with excuses to justify his cruel deeds for the sake of not hearing insults or accusations against him or his image; for example, after he brutally dismembers and then eats Gluttony, he gave the justification that Gluttony was "originally a part of him anyway" (both Pride and Gluttony come from

   , Pride is so selfish and self-absorbed that he tends to show up at the wrong time and isn't there when the other homunculi need him. He cares so little about the others that the deaths of even many of them will have no effect whatsoever on his heart; in fact, he's so heartless that he doesn't even get annoyed about losing such potential "tools" of his. Greed calls Pride a "monster," even for a homunculus such as him. Even Envy, a homunculus filled with huge sadism, dislikes and is angered by Pride's hubris, calling Pride a "bastard". The only homunculus with whom Pride has a tolerable and slightly positive relationship with is Wrath, likely due to their fake father-son relationship. Pride is able to tell when Wrath was not his usual self, and when Wrath was expressing his thoughts on letting the younger generation take over, Pride reminded them of who they were and even chose not to tell Father what Wrath said because he might be inclined to view it as treason, showing that Pride very slightly cared about Wrath's wellbeing.
  </p>
  <p key="76cbbdbf-9bf0-45c0-801a-3cee6af89ff1">
   When insulted by another homunculus, Pride disguises his own evil by calling the homunculus ill-mannered and uncivilized, and uses this as an excuse to suggest that Pride deserves to inflict extreme misery and suffering on him (

   Two years later, it is shown that Pride has grown up and once again goes by the name of "Selim Bradley". He is seen acting like a regular child, caring for an injured bird and seemingly having no recollection of his life as Father's firstborn son. Pride is the only surviving Homunculus.

  </h2>
  <p key="eb6c419e-1196-43fb-b9e5-2e20b85bd0d4">
   Aside from the Homunculi's standard powers, Pride's abilities lie within both a black living controllable multi-eyed and multi-mouthed shadow (that resembles Father's true form).
  </p>
  <p key="0417e706-73ae-45fe-9d76-e43284ec5feb">
   Pride's black multi-eyed shadow is his actual form, with the childlike body being a simple "container" for him to move around in, similar to Father's flask-contained form. Pride often shapes parts of himself into long, tendril-arm-like appendages that resemble those of Father's actual form and those of the Eye of God (which references him being a "son" of Father, who in turn was created from the Eye's essence; it may also be a reference to pride being a pathetic attempt to outwardly mimic God).
  </p>
  <p key="3b28f858-0ac6-4e71-b027-2d2fe044595a">
   Pride can only exist within a given area: the area inside his primary "container", the area around his primary "container", and the transmutation circle (which is his secondary "container" and the same one used by Father for his main plan) throughout
   <a href="Amestris.html" key="040d3f1b-4120-4088-98cf-8b8cdc785ea4" title="Amestris">
    Amestris
   </a>
   . Additionally, Pride cannot create these dark extensions of himself if there are no shadows near his body. This means that, if he is in complete darkness, he is incapable of using his power, and if his body is engulfed by light intense enough to extinguish the shadows around him, like a flash grenade, his extensions also vanish. This holds true for the extensions far from his body as well, as intense light will cause them to wither to a certain degree. Perhaps unique among the Homunculi, Pride does not appear to bleed when injured, and his human shaped container appears to be hollow, with its contents apparently consisting only of his shadowy true form and his Stone.
  </p>
  <p key="6fddff4f-e51e-4aa5-b5dc-6b262e7b0a00">
   Pride's "container" also seems to be extremely resistant to physical damage as seen during
   <a href="Heinkel.html" key="dbd7cb89-7b8a-43c8-80f8-6f82e620ff94" title="Heinkel">

   's attacks, and the car's impact taking little damage.
  </p>
  <p key="5f85693e-7084-4491-8ec8-b414b1740b02">
   Pride can also spread his essence throughout shadows and can sense everything around and that happens around that shadow, thus allowing him to "watch" anything through them. Pride used this ability to make sure and prevent Riza Hawkeye from spreading Selim Bradley's true identity to other people (though Riza foiled this by speaking in code to Roy Mustang).
  </p>
  <p key="b23a0651-3746-433c-b0ca-bd0077a3ebdd">
   Pride can manipulate, slice through or devour anything that comes in contact with his black shadow (which can become resistant/invulnerable to conventional physical harm, and can also move at superhuman speeds), although it can be deflected by sufficiently hard objects; Carbon-hardened objects appear particularly resistant. He can also see through his eyes and talk through his mouths wherever his shadow extend, an ability he uses to watch over the country-wide transmutation tunnel, slaughtering anyone who enters it.

   's (armor) body by inserting extensions of himself inside the armor body, he is able to do this - while also keeping Alphonse unconscious - thanks to his relation to him through Hohenheim allowing him to manipulate Alphonse's soul through his blood seal. He used this in an attempt to trick Edward into completely falling under Pride's grasp (Greed, who was with Edward at the time, foils this by sensing Pride's presence). He was even capable of talking with Alphonse's voice in this state.
  </p>
  <p key="3ef4054a-00cd-4eb0-8579-3bc304e41159">
   Pride can consume living things and assimilate the abilities and strengths of that particular victim, along with their corresponding weaknesses (i.e. after devouring Gluttony, Pride gained an enhanced sense of smell and sharp teeth on his shadows, along with Gluttony's ravenous hunger). After assimilating Kimblee, Pride gains capability of Alchemy and can activate it using a corresponding circle with his shadows, later also briefly assimilating the Gold-Toothed Doctor to use his knowledge to perform human transmutation - while also using him as the human transmutation "material". However, he was forced to use his own Philosopher's Stone to accomplish this, and was never demonstrated to be capable of using alchemy in any other way.
  </p>
  <p key="dbc1b97a-2da7-49b6-a839-100b9bdaf33c">
   In chapter 104, Pride attempts to use his small size and speed to exploit Edward's weaknesses in hand-to-hand combat as Edward is used to fighting people taller than him, but has his fighting style read easily by his opponent.
  </p>
  <p key="29bcde23-60f6-4bc9-b453-5f864fce13a9">
   Another ability Pride seems to have is the ability to slightly change the age that he appears to be. While he is always a young child, pictures of him taken in the past show his apparent age fluctuating by about five years. Since Father had Pride living out of the shadows since he was born, this ability is likely used to make him appear human.
  </p>
  <p key="e0e2182c-6281-4c29-a2ad-fcc9a2a7f480">
   Pride later seems to gain the ability to genuinely age upon having his Philosopher's stone depleted of its souls and being forced into his true form. Over the two years after the end of the series he managed to grow from his original fetus-like form to a child form resembling his "container" used to hold his shadows.

His weapon of choice is the sword, which he wields with great proficiency. Because he ages like a regular human, Dante considers him her greatest creation, a title he is very proud of.

   learns from the Elrics that Bradley is a Homunculus and verified it, Pride gives Selim the key to a safe where Pride keeps the skull of his true body. When Selim unknowingly brings the skull back to him during his battle with Mustang, he is severely weakened by its presence. Out of anger he strangles Selim and snaps his neck before Roy stops him, but this weakened state allows Mustang to kill him by repeatedly setting him on fire, similar to how Roy killed Lust in the manga. Pride was the fourth of the Homunculi to die in the 2003 anime, because Selim Bradley, the manga's Pride who survived in the manga and 2009 anime, is innocent and fully human in the anime.
