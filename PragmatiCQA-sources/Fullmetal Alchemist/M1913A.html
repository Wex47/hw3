   specialized for use in cold-climate areas. The Crocodile has no digits, and is instead a large chainsaw with a jaw clamp. Like all cold-climate automail, the M1913-A is made of carbon fiber rather than combat steel, which helps prevent frostbite. The exhaust system from the chainsaw also helps to prevent frostbite on the wearer's connecting nerves. This allows the wearer to go on longer missions in the cold that would not be possible even with other types of cold-climate automail.

    The Achilles heel of the M1913-A is that it has no digits, and therefore cannot function as a hand. This makes it unsuitable for casual situations and leaves its wearer in a vulnerable position if it is damaged in such a way that is ceases to function.
