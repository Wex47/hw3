   Riza is a pale-skinned woman in her mid-to-late twenties with mid-back length blonde hair that is fastened up in the back by a dark-colored clip barrette in a style where it resembles a bird tail with bangs falling in a hawk's wing pattern from right to left, occasionally partially obscuring her left eye (when she is on the job). Her eyes are brown and each of her ears is pierced with a silver stud. She is known to wear faux eyeglasses while in disguise.
  </p>
  <p key="150c8d07-b46d-47e4-8648-8277829dcc9f">
   She frequently wears a black, short-sleeved turtleneck under her military uniform and often dons it in casual dress as well. Even though Riza has noted (in Perfect Guidebook 2) that skirts restrict movement and therefore are not welcome in a military office, while in civilian clothes, she is mostly seen with in long skirts and boots with her hair down.

  <p key="d8559149-8cf3-4afb-a4f7-336058ef004c">
   Riza is a quiet and collected woman with a serious but courteous demeanor. She is viewed by her peers as the model of a perfect soldier; strictly disciplined and extremely rational, she rarely relaxes when on the job and is usually tasked with keeping her colleagues on track. Though from the outside she might seem strict, rigid, and even a little mean, Riza is not as cold and distant as she may appear. Those close to her know that there is more to her than her no-nonsense attitude; beneath her professional aura is a kind soul who understands the difficulty of carrying a heavy burden.
  </p>
  <p key="d46db319-2e7e-41ce-9610-b8c35e170898">
   Riza's softer side tends to make itself known through her interactions with younger characters, such as the Elric brothers and
   <a href="Winry Rockbell.html" key="13ae9e24-25f0-4f8c-a311-1404a9bd95e1" title="Winry Rockbell">

   , and it isn't unusual to see her behaving sweetly towards
   <a href="Black Hayate.html" key="8a5610f9-cadd-4614-9bfa-0ad3f89b4aaf" title="Black Hayate">
    Black Hayate
   </a>
   (Riza's pet Shiba Inu dog), while in private. On more informal occasions, such as when she spends the day with Rebecca, Riza also shows hints of a dry, acerbic sense of humor. Very disciplined, she takes her work seriously and is almost never seen âdropping formalities,â even with those who are most intimate to her. She's not prone to public displays of affection, preferring to show her feelings through more subtle ways. Riza seems the personification of "tough love," demanding excellence from those she respects or considers important. Her interactions with Hayate can be seen as a metaphor for all of her significant personal relationshipsâa stern hand and demanding nature tempered with genuine and deep affection.
  </p>
  <p key="c5c07bcd-48e3-48c1-903b-57451b327e48">
   It can be inferred that Riza also changed across the years; in her teens, she appeared to have been rather timid and idealistic about the world at large. Growing up at her father's house, she probably experienced a sheltered sort of childhood. After joining the military, her experiences in Ishval destroyed her youthful idealism and transformed her into the nearly stoic
   <b key="c0fab980-5aee-4e9b-9788-36134e49f16f">
    Lieutenant Hawkeye
   </b>
   . She emerges from the war with a tremendous will, strong enough to shoulder the heavy guilt she willingly bears, and uses this motivation to stand alongside and support Mustang in the hopes that future generations will remain free of the horrors of something like Ishval. Reticent, she doesn't speak unnecessarily or express her feelings often through words, but reveals most of her thoughts through nonverbal communication, with trademark sharp looks and rare, subtle smiles.
  </p>
  <p key="a8b0c053-8e59-4c1d-9db5-90b678f43f66">
   Her character shows a mix between a tortured woman looking for redemption she feels is unreachable, and a resigned acceptance of past mistakes and their consequences. Riza learns from Ishval to accept responsibilities for her actions herself, rather than placing blame or burden on another. She decides she must sacrifice her own happiness and comfort and continue to dirty her hands with blood as a soldier in order to bring peace to the people. Despite the emotional difficulties in facing her mistakes, she learns to school herself and her emotions as personal struggles, brushing off the concern of others, always bearing grief or physical pain with a stiff upper lip.

   <i key="550604e4-7bdf-4b9c-be39-a1f8d7ac38b9">
    "tool for protection."
   </i>
   Riza seems to hold the belief that a gun is simply an object, by itself unable to cause pain or suffering without a person pulling the trigger. It is not her weapons that she dislikes, but the death that
   <i key="297c11af-e6f7-4980-8235-c552b76224ab">

    "a gun is good. It doesn't leave the feeling of a person dying in your hands."
   </i>
   When he counters that this mindset is self-deception, she agrees, indicating that she is willing to deceive herself and continue to do her duty as a soldier if it means assuring the safety of others. While in the 2003 anime, she's seen using her guns to intimidate her colleagues into doing their jobs, in the manga (and 2009 anime), she seems to take weapons a lot more seriously and she is never seen taking out her gun when she doesn't mean to shoot it.

   Riza's connection with Colonel Mustang is easily the most significant of her personal relationships. Having known Roy since his youthful days as her father's alchemy apprentice and throughout his entire military career, the course of Riza's life seems to bend to suit his. As a result of their deeply intertwined histories, the Flame Alchemist has entrusted Riza with his life as his
   adjutant
   and has deemed her as both his conscience and executioner by giving her the express authority to shoot him in the back should he ever stray from the righteous path. In normal situations, this role seemingly amounts to Lt. Hawkeye being a sort of "babysitter" to the irresponsible Roy, frequently nagging him to complete his administrative paperwork and offering sharp criticisms when he steps out of line. Under more extreme conditions, however, it becomes quite clear that Riza's censures come from a deep devotion to Roy and his ideals as she is willing to risk her life to ensure the success of her commander's plans and guard his well-being. Riza has girded herself to follow the colonel through any peril without hesitation and only truly betrays fear when faced with the real possibility of losing him. In turn, Roy displays the same devotion for his lieutenant, even going so far as to risk his life and goals for the sake of protecting her from harm.

   Very little is known about the relationship between Riza and her father. However, Riza states he was an estranged, madman, of whom she was afraid, and that when he researched, he seemed possessed by something. She seems to blame the Flame Alchemy for that, since she has drawn parallels with Roy and her fear of "Flame Alchemy driving him mad." Riza's father had his research notes tattooed onto his daughter's back; this is another facet of her close relationship with Roy Mustang, who is the only person she has ever permitted to view the notes. It is unclear whether the tattooing was done against her will or with her consent.

   Overall, the relationship between father and daughter appears to have been difficult and distant. His death leaves her quite shaken, but she is not shown to shed any tears during the private funeral that she and Mustang hold for him. Nevertheless, it is implied that she was devoted to him in a fashion and believed in his assertions that Flame Alchemy would be an asset to mankind.
