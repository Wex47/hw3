In the course of performing this transmutation, Hohenheim was nearly killed; Dante saved him by instinctively attaching his soul to the body of another man; thus the pair discovered "eternal" life. In addition to this first Stone, Dante and Hohenheim were responsible for the destruction of at least two ancient cities: one located where the present capital of

She seeks out Homunculi from the moment they are created (when an alchemist tries to bring a dead person back to life) and feeds them red stones, thus strengthening them. She convinces the Homunculi that they will be better off as true humans, and makes them believe that she can transform them into true humans with the power of the Philosopher's Stone. Hence, the Homunculi become her minions in helping her to create the Stone. In reality, she only wants the stone for herself in order to continue cheating death. Only

This way, she hoped to gain control of Ed, hoping Rose's feelings for him would allow her to have him replace Hohenheim as her lover. But after Ed refused to aid her, Dante sent him away to the other side for a short while. When Ed did return and got killed by Envy, Al sacrificed himself to revive his brother, destroying the Philosopher's Stone, while Ed's death manages to shock Rose out of the trance that Dante had placed upon her earlier, much to Dante's dismay.

   Dante's personality and motivation were very enigmatic yet also all the more malicious. She is cruel, manipulative, arrogant, narcissistic, single-minded, devious, and vindictive. In her long years as a parasitic soul, moving from body to body, her personality has apparently changed considerably: as Hohenheim lay dying after creating the Philosopher's Stone, she rushed to save him, but now she cares little for the lives of others, believing those who die in order to preserve her life to be "necessary martyrs." Ever since then, Dante developed a god-complex, as well as exhibiting a misanthropic and egotistical view of the world, believing most human beings to be "selfish, ignorant creatures", unworthy of the knowledge of alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone (demonstrating a large degree of hypocrisy as well). As such, she has no qualms over starting wars or taking countless lives, as she is convinced that she is ultimately protecting mankind from itself. Because this is all Dante cares about, global politics, wars, and human lives mean nothing to her, as she has control of Amestris through her homunculus Pride and uses the whole country as a tool to obtain the Stone.

  <p key="052152d9-6e03-40a9-ae1f-d8191838168b">
   Like Hohenheim, Ed, and Izumi (and later Al), she can transmute without a circle, completing complex transmutations just by clapping her hands. She also possesses other abilities that go beyond normal alchemy: she is able to summon the Gate using infants (whose souls are more strongly linked to the Gate than those of adults), transform Gluttony from a childish fool into a ravenous monster, and split the mind, soul, and body of Hohenheim before sending him into the Gate. Dante is also the only known person to attempt a human transmutation specifically in order to create Homunculi (Greed, Pride, and most likely Gluttony), without any repercussions (apparently).

   </a>
   worn by the Homunculi. It represents a fixation on the volatile principle in alchemy, as opposed to the endless cycle represented by Ouroboros. In Dante's case, the symbol likely represents her belief that she is immortal and has conquered the cycle of birth and death represented by the Ouroboros. In real life, it is a symbol associated with the 15th-century alchemist Nicholas Flamel, who claimed to have created a Philosopher's Stone and used it to achieve immortality (one of the two main goals of alchemy, along with the creation of gold from lead).

   being the homunculus of her son, Dante has no actual feelings for him. Their only common ground probably lies in the feelings of rejection they were each dealt when Hohenheim abandoned them.

   alliance with Envy when she "kills" Hohenheim, an act of vengeance that had heretofore provided Envy with his only justification for existing. The conversation Envy has with Alphonse following this event implies that he is at least vaguely aware that Dante manipulates him emotionally but, again, does not care very much since he takes pleasure in doing the things she wants him to do. When Envy is later lost to Al's transmutation to revive Ed, Dante does not even mention him during her tirade over losing the stone, further solidifying that he had no real meaning to her other than "pawn". This is also cemented when Dante tells Wrath that homunculi 'don't have mothers' while standing next to Envy and never refers to him as her son, meaning in no way does she see him as family.

He appears to be Dante's most trustworthy creation and serves her for power and adulation, (although he may serve her solely out of loyalty) considering himself "God's Guardian Angel." Like Envy, he appears to have at least some idea of her true motivations, although this is never expressed to the same extent as the former. Despite being initially portrayed as a benevolent statesman, it is revealed Pride has disdain for humankind much like his master (the theme of deception is a similarity between them).

While at first it could be seen that Izumi was simply another candidate for a body-swap, the scene depicting Izumi's decision to leave depicts Dante as feeling honestly dejected and disappointed, not just frustrated over losing a potential body. The resulting bodily damage from Izumi's attempt at

   would most definitely exclude her as a body-swap candidate, yet Dante still tries to maintain a positive relationship with her. She provides Izumi with medicinal herbs to counter the consequences of her "sin", offers occasional guidance, and the casual discourse they share following Al's abduction indicates they may have still spoken with one another on occasion despite their differences. It is possible that her final farewell to Izumi is heartfelt, although it is also just as likely that she is using her to manipulate the Elrics (the Japanese dub suggests the former, while the English dub implies the latter).

   Dante's comments of "being an innocent" back when Hohenheim wooed her insinuate that he was an older, already accomplished alchemist by the time they met, which implies that she may have been more or less one of his admirers and that she pursued him for sexual reasons. There may have been some Hero-Worship on her part going on, as evidenced by her awed facial expressions during his experimentations with the Philosopher's Stone (despite how despicable the act was, considering the ingredients) and the way she unhesitatingly sacrificed the life of another man (who was probably a trusted friend and colleague, judging by his presence at the event) in order to save him.
  </p>
  <p key="0a484306-d188-4d8c-9dac-0f70f188468c">
   There is also evidence that Dante's Hero-Worship had an effect on Hohenheim during their life together. The first time he created the Stone, he did so by using the lives of those condemned to die during witch-hunts and the plague. The second and third times, he used all of the lives of an entire city and (possibly) a country, indicating that he had lost all his inhibitions and decency in that amount of time. He had most likely become swept up in her awe of him and her beliefs that they were gods among insects, and only later came to realize what a farce that was. He obviously did try to make a go at living life with her after the first Stone was made—considering they had married often (to keep up the ruse) and had and raised a child together—but apparently, he just couldn't do it, seeing as how he left her so suddenly. The fact he left her part of the Stone when he did insinuates that he felt responsible for her, and consequently responsible because he had allowed her to become the monster that she had become by humoring her absurd delusions of grandeur.

   During their reunion in "

   When Dante "killed" Hohenheim, it was only partially because he would stand in the way of her plans. The main reason was that he was the only person in the world who could show her the lies and delusions she had based her life on and he had done so out of pity and exasperation. He had revealed her mortality and inferiority, both as a lover and an alchemist, and she resented him for this, and so banished him to the other side of the Gate. With him out of the way, she could continue her life as a "god" of sorts without any worry that anyone else could stand in the way of that delusion, not necessarily in the way of her

    She may be named after the Italian poet, Dante Alighieri, famous for writing "The Divine Comedy", a three-part poem with the first chapter, Inferno, taking place in the Nine Circles of Hell. In fact in the Italian dub of the episode title "Dante of the Deep Forest" was translated to "Dante Della Selva Oscura" (lit. "Dante of Dark Forest"), a reference to the beginning of Alighieri's poem.

    Dante shares many similarities with her manga and 2009 anime counterpart, Father:

     <li key="a3665672-077a-473a-9410-3dbb9f2f98c6">
      Both, at one point, had close relationships with Hohenheim dating back several centuries.
     </li>
     <li key="0ca28a89-dc7d-425b-9825-569460db9c4d">
      Both "shared" the secret of eternal life with Hohenheim by means of the Philosopher's Stone.

     <li key="7921c6e9-88b7-43a9-b5d8-ecac336b5ebd">

      Both Dante and Father have the most physical transformations through the course of their respective series (excluding Envy, of course), with each of them gaining a much younger body for themselves.

      Both Dante and Father are hypocritical in that they consider humans to be lower beings, yet their respective reliances on the Philosopher's Stone render them both dependent on the human race for survival, technically making them little more than parasites.

     <li key="964c894a-f2b8-4974-abe3-f90b5506a5e2">
      Both Dante and Father are intensely connected with the Seven Deadly Sins, both in terms of their relationship with the Homunculi and in the content of their actions.

    During her confrontation with Edward in the hidden city, she asserts that the Law of Equivalent Exchange is false and that even if a person gives their full effort, it is unlikely that they will receive a reward of equal value. Her words prove ironically false as she spends years having others do her work for her, only to lose the Philosopher's Stone. She did little work and thus received nothing.

    As hinted above, Dante seems to commit each of the Seven Deadly Sins in her appearances:

     <li key="7ba0ecea-cc3a-48a6-9533-fc5fa001b836">
      Pride: she has an air of superiority and speaks condescendingly whenever she is surrounded by the Homunculi and sees all those around her as inferior to herself. She feels the thousands of lives lost to the Philosopher's Stone are inconsequential because she was "worth it."
     </li>
     <li key="67893c61-bd4d-408e-b85f-9ebbfffe7170">
      Envy: she showed hints of jealousy when Hohenheim refused her advances saying that Trisha was the only person he loved. Being the first Homunculus and sin created, it's possible that envy was the basis of which other events transpired.
     </li>
     <li key="a6ae2d7e-267e-43fd-b9fa-3bc37060916c">
      Wrath: she was quick to punish anyone who failed her or dared interefere—even former lover Hohenheim and her homunculi servants.
     </li>
     <li key="8ede0ab5-b3ef-4786-bedf-0902ee8674f4">
      Sloth: despite being a very powerful Alchemist, she prefers to use other alchemists to forge the Stone for her and tasks the Homunculi with all the footwork. Also, like the Homunculus it was named after, she maintained a cold demeanor and was aloof to the world and its inhabitants (ironically, she claims to have committed her deeds to help humans from destroying themselves with the stone).

     <li key="adf3b92b-4a6c-417d-92e0-51c34ab90400">
      Greed: her plans to gain the Philosopher Stone are out of a selfish act of having her life extended.
     </li>
     <li key="78b42caa-8b9e-4c60-86b2-f717b4e7215e">
      Lust: the act of having her soul transferred to other bodies violates her victims. She also takes care in selecting more lascivious bodies to steal (perhaps suggestive of her vanity). Later, while meeting Hohenheim, she licks her own arm, states she hasn't tested out her new body (Lyra's body), suggesting they sleep together. She also makes mention of her plan to take over Rose's body and use it to seduce Edward and "be loved by the son of Hohenheim."

     <li key="84ba60f0-ca91-484d-947c-270e13f9f7f9">
      Her desire to have her life extended represents the sin of Gluttony: the sin of having more to the point of waste.

       <li key="7172912e-e31c-48e3-ad8b-25c2db321caf">
        The series has implied that the transgression of Gluttony is Dante's most grievous offense. When she tells Edward that she is no longer human, the Homunculus Gluttony bursts into the room to carry out a scene that reveals him to be more human than she. When she later takes away Gluttony's mind (his last measure of humanity), she serves to transform him into the physical manifestation of her own monstrosity and is ultimately consumed by him.

    According to Dante, she has jumped from one body to another less than ten times in over 400 years.
