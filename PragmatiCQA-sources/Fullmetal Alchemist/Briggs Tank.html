It is a new type of fighting vehicle with heavy firepower and defensive armour. The first mobile war machine of its kind, the Briggs Tank is highly maneuverable and can accelerate rapidly.

   main gun
   and a machine gun in the bow. Small yet effective, the Briggs Tank has a crew of three, a driver, machine gunner, and a main gunner/commander. Its first successful test run was in the winter of 1914 against a

    The Briggs Tank appears to be based on the German Vk 30.01 H, a World War II medium tank, which fits in with the German theme of Amestris.

    The tank also appears to have taken designs from the Soviet
    with its sloped armor. However, it could be based on the Panzer III/IV which had a similar sloped design. In fact, the entire tank is very reminiscent of the Panzer III/IV due to similar look and armament.

   <li key="3d891ecf-0235-4bc2-a6e4-4e2e0315aa18">
    The frontal sloping of the armor and turret design are highly reminiscent of the German Panzer V tank, better known as the Panther. Its high maneuverability and imposing size similarly fit well with the Panther's reputation.
