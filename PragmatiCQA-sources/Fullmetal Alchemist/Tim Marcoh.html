   He is a kind man suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, along with extreme guilt over the atrocities he committed during the Ishvalan war that resulted in the deaths of millions of Ishvalans in order to make philosopher's stones. He is an honest, hardworking man, and is not used to bluffing but was able to bluff Envy into releasing Yoki as his hostage by feigning apathy towards sacrificing him. He refuses to return to the government due to the disgust towards their actions and even attempts to shoot Major Armstrong when he believes he was sent to retrieve him. He deeply cares for others, using the Philosopher's Stone he ran away with in order to heal the people of the village he was staying in. In addition, he was forced to work with the homunculi once again due to their threat of annihilating his village.

   He is so repentant of his actions that when he sees Scar for the first time he begs him to kill him and even refers to him as a God at that moment. Though unforgiving of himself for his actions along with the military and the government, he is forgiving of others and very patient. In addition, he holds no grudge towards Scar for horrifically and painfully disfiguring his face, claiming it was the face he deserved. He is brave when it matters, as he stood up to Envy and helped Scar, Al and the others to stop the homunculi. He is also very intelligent, having been the main researcher in creating the Philosopher's Stone.

   Dr. Marcoh is one of the oldest known alchemists of the series and as such has incredible knowledge regarding alchemy. His most notable knowledge is related to the creation of the Philosopher's Stone, knowledge given to him by the homunculi. After numerous experiments with their creation, he is also able to destroy them, an ability which proves effective when fighting Envy.

   Due to his elderly state, Dr. Marcoh is not able to use alchemy in combat, but rather he proves to be skilled when it comes to supporting tasks such as healing or deciphering codes. He is also very skilled in medicine, as more than one person has asked for his assistance, although his healing abilities may be possible through the use of the Philosopher's Stone, rather than a unique ability like Alkahestry. He also possesses the unique ability to destroy Philosopher's Stones with a single transmutation, giving him the power to cripple or kill Homunculi with a single touch.
