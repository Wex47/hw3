   Throughout the story, Bradley maintains control over the constant strife in the military and manipulating the various players of Father's plans into their appropriate positions. However, the Elrics and their various allies slip out of his grasp or play their own games in secret, plotting variously to either top Father's schemes, overthrow Bradley, or seize control of the country back from the Homunculi who created it.

   Without his saber, Wrath can no longer harm Greed, but he is still capable of defending himself perfectly. They start fighting, and Wrath is unfazed by Greed's attacks and sustains no injuries whatsoever. Greed uses tips that Ling gives him, but still cannot seem to truly damage him. Greed on the other hand sustains several small injuries, each of which heal. Some of the Brigg's soldiers watch from nearby and decide to help, shooting at Wrath. However, this is not only pointless but leads to their immediate slaughter.

   However, Buccaneer intervenes and hiding behind Fu's body, he manages to go unnoticed even by the Ultimate Eye and impales Wrath with his own saber through Fu's corpse. Infuriated, Greed strikes Wrath on the face before he can recover and destroys his Ultimate Eye. Wrath eventually falls into the moat around the headquarters, as Fu and Buccaneer pass away with a smile. Wrath is injured and falls into the waterways surrounding the Headquarters.

   genocide Wrath instigated which was started fifteen year before the start of the story, who wants revenge against Amestris and sided with the Elric brothers after learning that the homunculi were behind the genocide. As the battle commences, Wrath, piqued by Scar in every way, asks his name, to which Scar replies he doesn't have one, having long discarded it. Wrath is heavily amused at it mirrors his own life and lack of a formal name; finally he can enjoy a final battle, to the fullest of his abilities with another nameless warrior, basically mirror images of one another.

   As he fights Scar, Wrath progressively becomes weaker due to his injuries, but is still able to fight evenly against the latter. As he pins Scar to the floor and readies to deliver the fatal blow, he is suddenly caught off guard when short pillars of spikes incapacitate his right arm, much to his surprise and confusion. Scar then reveals to him that he can now use the power of reconstruction on his left arm, thanks to his brother's research. After knowing that Scar can now use the power of reconstruction, Wrath is both amused and annoyed as he asks Scar if he and the other humans will ever give up in their pointless struggles.

Despite gaining an upper hand in the fight, Wrath is momentarily blinded by the sudden re-emergence of the sun, allowing Scar to use his Arm of Deconstruction to destroy Wrath's arms. Before he can fall, Wrath grabs the blade of his sword with his teeth and stabs Scar in the midsection.

Lan Fan means to injure him further before he can die, stating that his life was truly sad and asks if he has ever truly loved anyone. Wrath tells Lan Fan not to utter such words when she knows so little. He tells her that his wife was chosen by him, and as such, he truly cared for her. When asked if he wanted to say something to her, Wrath states that she doesn't need to know about him because "that is how it is between a king and his partner" and dies at peace with his life and thankful for the humans who made it worthwhile, making him the fifth Homunculus to die.

   Contrary to the other homunculi, Wrath's corpse does not crumble into dust, but merely ages about ten years, while his hair become white and his face gets covered with wrinkles and alchemy marks. Most likely, the Philosopher's Stone inside him disintegrates while his corpse becomes human again.

Scar tells her that he was wounded by someone earlier, citing this as the only reason why he survives. With this, Olivier correctly deduces that Buccaneer had been the one who wounded him.
