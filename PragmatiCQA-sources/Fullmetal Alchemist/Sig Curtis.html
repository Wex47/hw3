   referred to as "a friendship forged from muscle". It is also shown that he may have had some amount of combat training, as he's easily able to catch a knife his wife casually threw at him between two fingers. Such interactions, Izumi's prominent combat ability and her declaration that her husband is a "finer man" hints that Sig's own level combat skill is at least a level his wife can respect and goes beyond just muscle.

   After he and his wife marry, Izumi becomes pregnant with their first child. The two are joyed by this, but the baby dies during birth, causing the two to seep into depression. Izumi attempts to use alchemy to bring the baby back, but this results in

   Before the story takes place, Sig, along with Izumi, run into a town threatened of being flooded. Izumi is able to easily save the town with alchemy, but vomits blood immediately afterward. They meet the Elric Brothers and Izumi teaches them alchemy. Sig plays as her voice of reason to keep the two from dying.

   Sig and Izumi once again meet the Elric Brothers several years later when the two visit. Izumi welcomes them brashly, but Sig comes to her rescue when she vomits blood. The two catch up, but when the question about why they have not had children comes up, the two shrug it off and talk around the subject. Eventually, it is revealed to the Elric brothers that they cannot have children due to Izumi's encounter with the Truth, and that Ed's metal arm and leg and Al being in a suit of armor are a result of their confrontations with the Truth when trying to bring back their dead mother.

   King Bradley and Major Armstrong (the latter of which used tracking skills to follow the Elrics to Dublith) enter their shop and demand to know where Izumi Curtis is. Sig refuses to admit to anything, hiding it by telling them the prices of their meat. Armstrong attempts to persuade Sig by removing his shirt and showing him his massive physique. After seeing his impressive muscles, Sig decides to show off himself. By flexing all his muscles, he is able to tear his outfit to shreds. He then shows off his beefy body. Through continuous flexing and analyzing the others manly burl, the two form a friendship.

   The two aren't again seen until midway through the story, when Sig and Izumi are on a train and once again encounter her students' father, Van Hohenheim. After leaving the train, they talk about Hohenheim's sons and what they have been doing when Izumi's internal injuries cause her to spit up blood. Concerned, Hohenheim then proceeds to reach inside Izumi's body, rearranging her organs. Thinking that he stabbed Izumi, Sig furiously punches Hohenheim, knocking him a few feet. Asking his wife if she is alright, Izumi maintains that she is fine, and that she can actually breathe better. Finding out that the wound where Hohenheim stabbed her is gone, he states that he cannot bring back her organs, but simply rearranged her damaged internal cavity in the most favorable arrangement possible. Izumi then fearfully asks Hohenheim what he is, to which he replies "I'm just a man named Van Hohenheim, the human Philosopher's Stone". After this, Hohenheim informs them both of everything that has been happening in the country, including the
