   attacked him, but he fought them off by transforming into Edward. Just before reaching his father, he changed once again into his original human form, likely to get The Gate Children to take him to Hohenheim faster. By the time he made his way through to the other side, Envy took to a serpentine dragon form. Ed awakens and finds that his body is whole again, his arm and leg flesh and blood, but Alphonse has been taken through the Gate. Edward offers his own life in exchange for his brother. Al is returned to his own body, except that he is 10 years old and has no memories since the day that he and Ed attempted to bring their mother back to life. Edward is pulled back through the Gate and appears on the other side in Munich, Germany, again in our world.
