   , one of the people's basic philosophies is that there exists a flow of life energy within the earth/All (signified by the mystical dragon), flowing metaphorically from the tops of mountains down to the land, nourishing everything it passes with that energy as does blood coursing through the veins.

   While this philosophy is a central concept to the ancient Xingese art of Alkahestry, it can also be understood and manipulated by those who do not practice the craft: Royal warriors of Xing's fifty clans are taught to read the flow of the Dragon's Pulse, thereby becoming not only able to commune with nature and understand their surroundings, but sense the presence and movements of the people and animals around them by reading the pulse of natural energy within their bodies.
