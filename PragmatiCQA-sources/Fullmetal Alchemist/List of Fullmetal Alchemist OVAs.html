   This brief sequence shows three children, who bear exact resemblances to the Elric brothers and to Winry Rockbell, making a trip through a modern city. They travel alone to Edward's apartment, passing a group of children that resemble Roy Mustang and his subordinates, and getting directions from a police officer resembling Maes Hughes. Edward is by then aged, bearing a striking resemblance to Hohenheim, and is referred to by the children as "great-great-grandfather". The children collectively wish him a happy birthday, also noting that they have brought him a present from their "Great Great Uncle Al". In the end, a text scrolls along the bottom-center that reads, "In the year 2005, Edward Elric will be 100 years old. In this world, somewhere...".

   -themed attraction at Universal Studios Japan, the viewer is introduced as a new member of the military, welcomed by Führer Bradley, who assigns the viewer to Mustang's group. Mustang instructs his troops on a plot to rescue the Elric Brothers from the Homunculi. In the underground city, Greed has captured Ed, Al, and Winry, although Winry is revealed to be Envy in disguise and easily defeats Greed. Envy then lures the brothers into a trap set by the other Homunculi, namely Lust, Gluttony, and Wrath. The fight leads to a ballroom where Mustang shows up, along with his troops, Major Armstrong, Kimblee, Archer, and Sloth. A large battle follows which ends when the viewer activates an alchemy ring received from Mustang, which blows up the building. Everyone survives, Ed and Al congratulate the viewer for their hard work before departing themselves.

   ". It implies that there were other Homunculi before. This discussion also reveals that Greed was Dante's former lover (his human forerunner) and the current him still loves her. This is further cemented by his final actions of going to see her one last time before death and him backing down from harming Ed when he notices Dante was watching him from afar. Envy goes on to state Greed was merely an experiment for Dante (possibly in her greed to become more knowledgeable in creating Homunculi). Greed, however, denies being some love-struck fool and storms off in a huff. Besides that, Envy also implies that the reason he hates humans so much is to forget why he was born, and that he hated Hohenheim for abandoning him.

The final scene ends with the same scene in episode 51, Ed questioned whether equal exchange existed, can someone really gain something without paying an equivalent price, Hohenheim replies that their journey he and his brother had been through, the people they met, the things they saw, the suffering, the efforts, and all the experience was the price they had to pay to gain their goal.

    Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only, truth. But the world isn't perfect, and the law is incomplete. Equivalent Exchange doesn't encompass everything that goes on here, but I still choose to believe in its principle, that all things do come at a price, that there's an ebb and a flow, a cycle, that the pain we went through, did have a reward, and that anyone who's determined and perseveres, will get something of value in return, even if it's not what they expected. I don't think of Equivalent Exchange as a law of the world anymore. I think of it as a promise, between my brother and me. A promise that someday, we'll see each other again.
