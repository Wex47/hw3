The three kids (and canine) grow very close over the few days of their acquaintance after Nina confides in the boys that her loneliness is largely due to the fact that her mother had left her father two years ago, just before Shou Tucker received his

The Elrics immediately understand how Nina feels as they remember their own father paying little attention to them and declare their intention to play with Nina and Alexander and the three kids and dog spend most of the rest of the day playing together.

As he attempts to pass Nina off as his second speech-capable chimera, however, Edward realizes the horror of what the Sewing-Life Alchemist has done when Nina speaks innocently to him from inside her new monstrous form. But while Edward loses his temper and begins to thrash Tucker, Nina intervenes sadly, understanding the situation just enough to plead piteously for her father's life. Incapable of reversing the transmutation and not knowing what else to do, Ed and Al apologize to Nina and leave, but report Shou's actions to

   Nina Tucker was a very cute young girl with blue eyes and long brown hair pulled back into braids which hang past her waist.
  </p>
  <p key="76ffcbc5-5272-4470-9270-a0100a6de613">
   In the 2003 Anime, Nina usually wore a pink collared long-sleeved Polo shirt under a blue dress with bright yellow/gold buttons AND some clogs for shoes. She also wore a purple winter coat which had a pink collar, cuffs and hem and a white scarf underneath and briefly wore a tiara that Ed fashioned for her using his own alchemically-created flowers.

   (2009 anime series), Nina can be seen wearing at least two outfits which were inspired by the manga. Her dress is a very pale shade of green with silver buttons and a pink short sleeved shirt underneath. Her shoes and socks of choice remain the same though the color is a bit different.
  </p>
  <p key="b1c590e2-7311-43ac-9003-4124f75718cb">
   She also sports a red shirt with an extended flap at the back of the collar and a black line of decoration and sky-blue shorts. As such an attire is commonly associated with traditional Japanese schoolwear, one can assume she is old enough to attend school in the Manga/2009 Anime, contrary to the 2003 Anime where she appears to stay at home with her father.

   From what is known, most likely Alexander was a breed of dog known as a Great Pyrenees. After the Chimera is fused Alexander loses his white fluffy appearance for a peach skinned hybrid creature with a carpet of hair growing out of its back. It is also noted that Nina seems to be a bit unsure of her memories and her own fate after the transfusion.

   As a clone, Nina is seen naked with her long hair being the only thing to cover her doll-like form. The first half of the body experiment, we see her body covered in hair which very much resembled how the chimera was draped in it. We also see, when Ed first discovers Tucker's work, a series of glass tanks containing the original chimera's body and then a Nina covered in brown fur. Her eyes appear to be empty and she also looks a bit older (4 years later so she'd be 8). Her hair is also very long at this point. We also see a tank full of Nina bodies, forming animal sacrifices, according to her perturbed father.
