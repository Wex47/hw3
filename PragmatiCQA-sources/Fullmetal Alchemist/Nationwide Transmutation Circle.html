In addition to the double pentagon pattern formed by the ten Crests of Blood, another transmutation circle is formed at the heart of Central City by way of the five Central Alchemical Laboratories and the circular underground tunnel connecting them, all arranged around Father at the center.

   circle had been put into place by Van Hohenheim, who had predicted the course of action that Father would take. Mapping out the path that the shadow of the moon would take across the Earth as the eclipse passed, Hohenheim visited five locations around the circle created by the lunar umbra, which corresponded to the five-point circle used in the creation of the Philosopher's Stone, and deposited several souls from his body into the earth at each location. Having kept their individuality as a part of Hohenheim's efforts, these souls activated a transmutation with the eclipse umbra as the circle and willfully used their power to strip Father of the roughly fifty million Amestrian souls the Homunculus had trapped within his body. Still linked to their bodies by the "spirit", these human souls were all drawn back to their bodies in a matter of seconds.
