Although they are usually characterized by brown skin and white or silver hair, Ishvalan people are most definitively distinguished by their red eyes, which persist as a dominant genetic trait regardless of whether or not Ishvalans marry outside of their ethnicity, as seen in the case of

   . It is likely that the Ishvalans' strict code of religious conduct and discipline was borne from the severity of the land, which is not largely farmable and contains very few natural resources, if any. Ishvalans consider their names sacred, as gifts from God, and usually wear sashes striped with burgundy and gold, presumably as a sign of their faith. In accordance with their value of discipline, Ishvalan monks are also heavily trained in melee combat, presumably as a sort of meditative discipline, and are comparable on the battlefield to roughly ten standard soldiers. However, the most contentious point of the Ishvalan religion is its rejection of the craft of

    In the original storyline, most of the population of Amestris believes that all of the Ishvalans were killed during the civil war, save for the few people living in the various slums with them. However, in the first anime, one of the thugs who attacks the slums where Scar is recovering says "Aren't [the Ishvalans] supposed to be living in designated camps?",
    leading to the conclusion that not only are Amestrian citizens aware of surviving Ishvalans, the government is spending money to keep them in camps. This is further supported when the Ishvalan group that Scar was traveling with were eventually going to be sent to one of these camps
    following their capture.

      comparisons are drawn between the Ishvalans and both the Jewish and Romani peoples, who were targeted during the Holocaust by Nazi Germany. The Ishvalans' desert homeland and their conservative, monotheistic faith have also drawn comparisons to Islam; in flashbacks, many Ishvalan women are seen wearing headresses which resemble hijab.
