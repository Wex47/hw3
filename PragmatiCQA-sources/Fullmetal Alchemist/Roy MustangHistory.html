   In 1905, at the age of twenty, Roy returned to the decrepit Hawkeye estate hoping to both acquire the higher echelons of Master Hawkeye's unique alchemical expertise as well as persuade his revered teacher to join the State Alchemist program so as to share his brilliance with the world. Berthold, however, refused the offer and further expressed his doubts that someone so eager to become a military lapdog was worthy of attaining the pinnacle of his research. Unfortunately, Master Hawkeye died of an unknown illness in Roy's arms that very day, leaving as his dying wish that Roy inherit his secret research notes from his daughter

   At Hawkeye's funeral, after Roy revealed to Riza his own dreams of strengthening the government and protecting the people with his own strength, she in turn revealed to him that her father's secret research had been encoded in a tattoo on her back. Impressed by Roy's intentions, she entrusted her back to him in the hopes that he would use its secret to create a happy future for the people. Deciphering the code, Roy mastered Hawkeye's innovative flame alchemy and went on to pass the State Alchemist certification exam, earning the symbolic moniker "Flame Alchemist" and the military officer rank of Major.

   . The Flame Alchemist was ordered into the Daliha district where the columns of fire ignited by his flashily destructive style of combat alchemy earned him great notoriety and the nickname "The Hero of Ishval". Re-encountering Maes Hughes and Riza Hawkeye, who had enrolled into the military academy and become an infamous sniper in the civil war since he had seen her last, the three lamented the fact that their eyes of youthful idealism had been replaced with the eyes of murderers and pondered over the unknown reasoning behind the incredible military expenses being devoted to the inexplicable wholesale slaughter of the Ishvalans, who were technically fellow Amestrian citizens.

   After an exorbitant death toll, Mustang himself brought an end to the struggle in Daliha, effectively bringing the civil war to a close. However, the long and bloody struggle had all but erased the idealism of his youth; after devoting himself to the military in order to support the people, he had built himself up into the "hero" of a massacre, and only managed to save the lives of a few men stationed under him with his flames. Still, the thanks of those men inspired a new dream in the Flame Alchemist's heart. Instead of becoming part of the foundation of the country in order to protect the people, he began planning to rise above people and protect those below him with his acquired power and authority. Even if all he could protect was a few people, he would make sure that those people protected those below them and so on until the entire nation ended up benefiting from his protection. It was at that point that Mustang first set his sights on the position of Führer.

   As Mustang prepared to move out from the battlefield, Riza - just as guilt-ridden for her deadly role in the genocide, both direct and indirect - asked Roy to burn the record of her father's research off of her back with his Flame Alchemy so as to prevent the creation of a second "Flame Alchemist".

As a new commander, he scoured the new recruits for trustworthy subordinates who would fulfill his ideals of universal protection and amassed a handful of dependable underlings including Hawkeye, whom he positioned as his personal aide and bodyguard, entrusting his back to her under the agreement that she would protect him from harm and shoot him from behind if his march to power caused him to stray off of the correct path and use the knowledge she had given him with ill intentions.

With the help of Major Armstrong - who happens to be the "Strong Arm Alchemist" - the East City forces manage to prevent Edward's demise as well as ascertain a bit more about Scar before his flashy escape: namely that his strange method of execution is a brand of alchemy that stops at the deconstruction stage and, perhaps more importantly, that the man is an Ishvalan survivor of the Civil War bent on taking vengeance for his slaughtered people.

He travels to Central City to attend his best friend's funeral and learn what he can about the murder, but even with the help of Major Armstrong is only able to uncover a few key facts - Hughes' death was orchestrated by one or more unknown members of a mysterious group already under investigation, the reason for his death had to do with an unspecified plot he had uncovered which threatened the military government and someone in Central Command had placed a gag order on all other information.

As a final note, Roy demands to know if Barry was involved in the murder of Maes Hughes a month earlier, not noticing Riza and Falman's. When Barry responds in the negative, Roy drops the subject and asks Falman to forget everything he had heard during the interrogation. But when Falman declares that his impeccable memory will not allow such a thing and promises to follow the Colonel's path to the end, Roy uses Falman's offer as an excuse to place him as Barry's unofficial guard, setting them up to stay hidden in a safe house nearby.

Roy asks Alex if he had told the boys about Hughes' death and when the Major responds that he could not bring himself to do so, the Colonel lectures him for being too soft on Edward, who will be exposed to much harsher truths once he turns sixteen and becomes subject to military missions as a "Human Weapon". But when Mustang encounters Edward and Alphonse - who have recently arrived in Central to see Hughes - Roy tells the boys that Maes has retired from the military and moved to the countryside with his family. Though he tries to rationalize this lie to Lt. Hawkeye after the Elrics go on their way, Mustang is forced to acknowledge that he himself is being just as "soft" as Armstrong was.

But when the news arrives that Ross has been convicted and marked for execution without so much as a trial, the next phase of Roy's plan goes into effect. He receives a call from Barry, who - having met Ross during the incident at Laboratory 5 - is certain of her innocence and offers to break her out of jail. After securing an outside phone line away from the prying ears of his superiors, Roy orders Barry to go in, rescue Ross and help him fake her death and then sends 2nd Lt. Breda to gather the materials necessary to transmute a rudimentary mock corpse. Once he has the materials, Roy uses his basic knowledge of human anatomy as well as the information gathered by Hawkeye to fashion the corpse's form to a woman of Ross' build and matching her dental records.

With the tables overturned, Roy and Jean flee the room, but Roy reveals that he has yet another trick up his sleeve; with the Transmutation Circle on the back of his glove and a cigarette lighter borrowed from Havoc, he transmutes the water filling the room into combustible hydrogen and flammable oxygen which he then ignites, incinerating Lust in a makeshift furnace.

Upon hearing Al refuse the defeated Hawkeye's request to leave her behind and save himself, the Flame Alchemist makes his presence known and, signaling the armor boy to transmute a defensive wall as he unleashes the full fury of his Flame Alchemy on Lust, finally bringing her to her knees. Colonel Mustang announces, as he fires off wave after wave of flames at her, that if it will take more than a normal kill-shot to subdue her - as she had claimed before - then he will continue killing her until she stays dead. Forcing her to keep regenerating rapidly to survive his attacks, Mustang pushes Lust's Philosopher's Stone to exhaustion, causing her body and core to disintegrate to nothing before his eyes. As she dies, Lust commends Roy's resolve, but warns that the day his clear, focused eyes will become clouded by suffering is nigh.

Complimenting the lieutenant's exceptional work, Roy gets right to the task of examining the evidence they had gathered. He notices that both Central Command Headquarters and the Führer's executive residence lie within the circle and begins to wonder whether King Bradley is an enemy or an ally. Though the path ahead seems daunting, he vows to get to the bottom of the conspiracy that Hughes had uncovered and asks Riza and Jean to continue following him loyally.

   Soon after his discharge, Roy becomes aware that Fullmetal is being unnaturally flashy and active in town, as if he were purposely attempting to attract the attention of Scar, who new reports claim has resurfaced in Central City. He pulls up to the Elric brothers with Hawkeye and asks what exactly they are up to, taking them to a secluded alley where they can speak without being overheard. Exchanging information regarding the Homunculi and recent events involving Marcoh and the Homunculi, Roy and Ed wonder how these mysteries are connected to the military. Edward explains that he is in fact trying to lure Scar out just as Scar himself appears. As the Elrics begin combating the Ishvalan murderer, they ask Roy and Riza not to get in their way, as they need Scar to remain alive and active for as long as possible in order to help them lure out a Homunculus for capture, but when Roy mentions that the military police will likely step in soon, the boys relegate to him the task of keeping the MPs at bay. Promised a share of the spoils should the operation succeed, Roy heads with Hawkeye to Kain Fuery's nearby townhouse apartment and use his copious amounts of broadcasting equipment to relay falsified reports of Scar's presence to the Provost Marshall's office, throwing the police multiple false leads and keeping them from interfering in Fullmetal's fight. When enough time has passed and the military police are in complete disarray, Hawkeye heads out in disguise to act as backup for the Elrics while Roy remains behind. The Colonel gives her the address of an empty house on the outskirts of town that they can use as a hideout after the mission and waits in the city until evening, when the Elric brothers have finished both their Homunculus capture and the resulting cleanup. Having received word from Hawkeye that she has arrived at the safe house with a badly-injured ally, Roy picks up the Elric brothers and Dr. Knox in a second car and, making sure not to be followed, drives to the meeting place.

Gluttony is, however, provoked by the sound of Mustang's voice and lashes out again, instantaneously devouring everything for several meters directly in front of him. Faced with no other choice, Roy dons his ignition cloth glove and decides that Gluttony must be destroyed here and now lest he kill them all or escape with information regarding his captors. But when he unleashes a torrent of flame on the Homunculus, the inferno is harmlessly drawn into Gluttony's mouth and swallowed by the large eye at the center of the dark abyss, proving that this Homunculus will not be as simple to beat as the last. Terrified, Roy flees toward the nearby treeline with the Elric brothers as Gluttony gives chase. Though they split up to confuse their inhuman pursuer, Gluttony locates Mustang immediately and Roy is only spared ingestion by Hawkeye's timely intervention. Unable to run any further due to his recent wounds, Roy has to be helped to safety by Hawkeye while Ed and Al create a diversion. Roy reluctantly gets into the car with Knox, Riza and Lan Fan while Ed, Al and Ling stay behind to deal with Gluttony, reminding the Colonel that the information he has gained today puts him one step closer to his goal if he acts on it immediately. As the car departs toward Central City, Mustang decides that he will confirm with his own eyes whether or not Bradley is a Homunculus.

Hawkeye is to be reassigned to a position as the Führer's personal aide - effectively making her his hostage. Bradley explains his origins to Mustang, stating that he had been a nameless, abandoned infant who had come into the possession of a secret government organization and raised with a host of other children specifically to be candidates for the position of Führer. When he reached early adulthood, the project went into its second phase and each candidate, in turn, was injected with a Philosopher's Stone imbued with the "wrath" of the Homunculi's "

   Suddenly remembering that he had left Lt. Hawkeye outside all night, the Colonel rushes to the front gate only to find that Major Armstrong had been manning her post for a few moments while she visited the latrine. Hawkeye promptly returns and expresses her relief at seeing the Colonel unharmed and the trio leaves the scene in Mustang's car. Away from Central Command, Roy explains the night's revelations to his two horrified comrades. Armstrong is visibly disturbed by the facts and laments that the government he has placed so much trust in has been rotten from the start. Roy suggests that Alex leave the service, but the Major responds that he cannot run away from this battlefield. Mustang reveals that he had told Bradley about his own resolve to stay in the military and remarks that, despite being called a "monster" and a "human weapon", fighting true monsters like Lust and Wrath make him feel truly

   A short time later, Hawkeye, Falman, Breda and Fuery clear out of Mustang's office to head off for their reassignments. After seeing Riza out and reminding her of the promise she had made to him after the Ishval War, Roy laments the loss of his people while poring over the chess set that Lt. General Grumman had given him.

But instead, Edward refuses, saying that he will repay Roy the money when Mustang becomes the Führer of Amestris. After explaining that Hawkeye had told him all about the war, their promise and the Colonel's secret goals, Ed goes on to say that he will borrow more at that time and hold it hostage until Mustang turns Amestris into a democracy. Roy agrees and drops the Elrics off at their hotel before meeting with
   Madeline
   , one of Madame Christmas' informants who relays a message from Grumman calling Roy to rendezvous with him the next day in front of Brigadier General Hughes' grave. Roy complies, meeting the disguised Grumman at the rendezvous point and explaining to him the situation regarding Central Command's conspiracy with the Homunculi. Grumman explains that his own demotion to East City from Central came immediately after he had unwittingly declared an opposition to the idea of attaining immortality in General Raven's presence and discusses with Mustang the inconsistencies regarding the ongoing riots in

   Still, Roy reminds his mentor slyly that the Lt.

As they prepare to depart, Grumman notices the sketch of the Xingese girl's black-and-white cat under Mustang's arm and informs him that he himself saw the girl in question at the East City train station boarding a train for the North Area.

She goes on to say that, though he arrived in the North Area with grievous injuries, he made an oddly full recovery immediately after receiving a personal visit from Lt. General Raven. Dropping Madeline off with payment for her intel, Roy is surreptitiously contacted by an Armstrong Family informant relaying a message from Major General Armstrong. Having discovered a great deal from the Elrics and hoping to combat this dangerous conspiracy, Major General Armstrong wishes to combine the defensive capabilities of Briggs with the excellent offensive capabilities of the East Area forces and asks the Colonel to help organize a joint military resistance.

   Roy then greets the Major General warmly on the occasion of her summons to the capital and dropping subtly that he has received her message and will comply. Shortly afterward, Mustang encounters Lt. Hawkeye after a long time apart and, though the two act as professionally toward each other as possible, Hawkeye manages to deliver a coded message disguised as friendly banter. Roy takes note of each thing she says and later deciphers her code in the bathroom, learning Hawkeye's own shocking discovery - that Selim Bradley is one of the Homunculi.

   He later passes that message to Olivier Armstrong, as she takes over the residence of the Armstrong family to herself. Alphonse meets up with Hohenheim at Reole, learning about the Promised Day and asking Izumi to deliver the message to Falman, Buccaneer and Miles at Briggs, who, then, proceed to send the message to General Grumman at the East. Grumman sends the message through Lieutenant Rebecca Catalina - Hawkeye’s best friend – to Hawkeye, at Central. Hawkeye goes to visit Havoc at the hospital to deliver him the news in a small roll of paper inside a cigarette cartridge and asks him to “Say hi to the Colonel when you see him.” Mustang, who has been hiding behind a curtain to avoid being seen next to the lieutenant, comes out, Havoc offering him a cigarette but showing him the message inside the cartridge. Mustang gets and reads the message, starting to make his own preparations for the Promised Day.

   Mustang had previously asked to Madame Christmas to check Selim Bradley’s background, to make sure of Hawkeye’s information of him being a Homunculus. Being closely followed by spies, Mustang visits Madame Christmas at the eve of the Promised Day. Madame Christmas states Roy’s suspicions were in fact correct and that Selim was no human, while the spies of the Military discover that the Madame’s true identity was Chris Mustang and that was, in fact, Colonel Mustang’s foster mother. They try to enter the Bar to arrest both, but are stopped as the bar explodes, leaving nothing left. Chris Mustang and Roy, who had gone underground and blown up the building, go their separate ways.

   Mustang meets up with his former subordinates Fuery, Breda and Hawkeye, who have deserted the Military to help Mustang in the coup that is about to take place. They all go to Central’s outskirts, surrounding Mrs. Bradley’s car and kidnapping her. They take Mrs. Bradley into the city, being attacked by Central forces. The Central Soldiers have orders to kill all Mustang’s allies and disregard the possibility of killing the First Lady, making Mrs. Bradley wonder whether the Central forces have turned against the Führer or if her husband has abandoned her. She then agrees to aid Mustang and his men.

   Mustang's gang arrives at Central. While Mustang and Hawkeye meet up with Edward, the other subordinates send out a radio transmission of how the upper brass of the military is corrupted, although they say it in believable terms and do not mention the Homunculi or their real intentions. Mrs. Bradley lends her assistance to the broadcast, crediting Mustang and his men for her very survival and appealing to the people's sympathies by saying she doesn't know where her husband and son are.

   Meanwhile, Mustang encounters Envy who, after being questioned, reveals he was Hughes' killer. Edward, Scar, May, and the chimera all move on to get to Father, leaving Hawkeye and Mustang to face Envy. Both parties are reminded of Mustang's defeat of Lust (whose charred remains can still be seen on the floor) using the same methods of flame alchemy and Envy, realizing that Mustang could easily kill him, attempts to escape. Mustang orders Hawkeye not to come with him and goes off after Envy, but she disobeys Roy's orders and follows him anyway. During the pursuit, Envy tries to throw Mustang off guard by transforming into Hughes, but this does not fool the Flame Alchemist, who sets Envy on flames again while pointing out the fact that Hughes is dead and gone from the world, and that Envy's action has only served to add fuel to the flames. Envy then charges towards Mustang, hoping that the Flame Alchemist wouldn't dare burn him at close range, but this act backfires as well.

   Envy makes another dash for it when Mustang mercilessly continues to burn him, and discovers Hawkeye searching for him. He shifts into Mustang and deceives her (most likely planning to do so for just long enough to kill her) momentarily. Hawkeye, however, understands that it could be Envy and tricks the homunculus by saying that Mustang never calls her "Lieutenant" but Riza when the two of them are alone. Envy falls for the trap, thus confirming his identity, and Riza thanks him for believing her and asking him to "do me another favor and die." She is able to take him on with her guns for a little while even with injuries; however, Envy eventually is able to get the upper hand and ensnares her in his elongated arm. Just as he is about to kill her, Mustang blasts him from a side entry, and warns Envy that Riza is one of his dearest subordinates. He burns Envy one final time which causes the homunculus to revert to his ugly parasitic form from before.

   He is one spark away from killing him when Hawkeye, although injured to an unknown extent, gets up and puts her gun to his head. She refuses to put her gun down and tries to persuade Mustang to stop, and he explodes at her, going into a fit of rage and refusing to give up his vengeance. Ed and Scar arrive, and Ed uses his alchemy to grab Envy; Mustang then demands that Ed to give him back.

   When Edward refuses, Roy threatens to burn Envy along with Edward's automail right arm off. Edward accepts the challenge, but asks for him to look at himself first, reminding the Colonel of his goal and Mustang's temper subsides a little. Scar partially agrees with Edward that Roy couldn't lead others the way he is now, but shows no opinion if Roy does exact his revenge on Envy. Riza then asks to let her kill Envy instead, but Roy rages about his revenge for Hughes. Riza tells him that she knows full well that he has sought to avenge Hughes, but corrects him that he only wants to kill Envy to satisfy his revenge. Riza then sorrowfully pleads for Roy to not fall like this, and Roy flashes back to a photograph of himself and Hughes. He tells Hawkeye that if she intends to shoot him, she should do it, but then asks her what she will do after he is dead. She replies that she has no intention of living on without him and will erase her body, and the secrets to flame alchemy "which drives good men to madness," from this world. This, as he notes later, is the thing which puts him over the edge; he looses his pent-up fire on a nearby wall, and says that he cannot allow Riza to follow through with this plan, because "I can't lose you too." He laments on his recent behavior and actions and apologizes to her for how he forced her to act.

   Envy then cuts in, mocking their apology. He antagonizes everyone, bringing up events that he hopes might bring themselves to fight amongst each other and taunting others with the things they have done. Edward looks at him, pointing out Envy's jealousy towards humans. Ed goes on to explain that, even though humans are weak, and sometimes they fail, humans have their friends to help them up whilst Homunculi don't have such a comfort. Envy frees himself of Edward and falls to the ground. Riza is about to shoot, but Scar stops her, pointing out that Envy doesn't have much time left. Envy comments on how pathetic he seems, on their "mocking nature", and how Edward, the one that he despises the most, is the only one that understands how he truly feels. He pulls out his Philosopher's Stone and crushes it, then disintegrates into dust while bidding Edward a tearful farewell. Seeing that Envy has committed suicide, Roy calls him a "coward".

   They continue their path through the sub-terrain but get lost, being separated from May, who was guiding them. Walking down a path, they find the Doctor who had created all the candidates for Führer and King Bradley himself. Activating a transmutation circle, he makes Ed disappear in front of their eyes, and a fight ensues between Mustang, Hawkeye and Scar against those failed attempts of creating the homunculus Wrath. The failed Führers subdue the three and the doctor tries to force Mustang into performing a Human Transmutation and becoming a qualified human sacrifice. Mustang refuses and one of the failed Führers slice Hawkeye's throat, leaving her to die and leaving Mustang screaming for her. The doctor says he can cure her with his Philosopher's Stone, but only if Mustang obliges to make a Human Transmutation. From the Elric brothers, Mustang knows that human transmutation is not a cure-all, but he is unable to make a concrete decision until Hawkeye sends him an eye signal that help is on the way. For a moment, he lectures the doctor about using people, and then the chimeras and May join them, resuming the fight. May staunches Hawkeye's bleeding with Xing alchemy, but Wrath and Pride arrive. Wrath then pushes Mustang into an alchemy circle by pinning his hands to the ground with swords. He is forced to open the gate, and thus is made the fifth sacrifice needed by Father.

Ed tries to talk to him, and Roy replies that he cannot see; the Truth has taken his sight as the price of looking inside the gate, either to 'deprive the man who had a grand vision to save his country from his eyesight, denying him to see what his beloved nation will become'. as Father claims it to be, or merely to give a price for seeing the Truth.

   After the Alkhestric Reverse is activated, Edward, Alphonse and Izumi launch their final attack against Father. Roy expresses his frustration and shame that he's useless at such a key battle, later asking Hawkeye if she can still fight, to which she replies she can. This gives him an idea. He points out to the others, who want Riza to stay behind and have her injuries tended, that in order to make Father use up his Philosopher's Stone, they need his power - and he needs Riza with him.

   He joins the fight with Riza at his side. He is shown to be able to use his Alchemy via clapping, but with the downside that he cannot really keep it safely under control without his sight. He is relying on Riza to properly aim his attack and warn him of Father's counterattacks, and at the same time he is providing her with physical support, as she is lost a great deal of blood and therefore strength. Unfortunately, when their combined efforts contribute to Father's loss of composure, the blow back from the energy he released renders everyone but Edward incapacitated. As such, while Edward takes the initiative onto his own shoulders, Roy joins in by shouting out his support to his friend and ally.

   After the battle with Father is over, Roy is treated in a medical center, conversing with Dr. Knox. He informs the doctor of his disability, and states that he will have to retire. He decides to pass the title of Führer over to Grumman. Knox then informs Roy that Dr. Marcoh was looking for him and brings the doctor over to Roy. Marcoh informs Roy that he has a Philosopher's Stone which Roy could use to regain his eyesight. Roy initially refuses, but Marcoh say that he has a plan in which they and the Ishvalans (referring to the souls in the Philosopher's Stone) can work together. Marcoh says he'll hand the stone over on the condition that Roy changes the Ishval policy, allows the Ishvalans to return to their homeland, and allow him (Marcoh) to live in Ishval as a doctor.

   Two years later, it is mentioned that Mustang has been promoted to Brigadier General and is working hard on rebuilding the Ishval region as well as turning it to a trading point between Amestris and the country of Xing. At the epilogue, he has already been promoted enough to gain a grand achievement, becoming one of the few fully-fledged Generals in the history of Amestris, and Hawkeye still loyally holds her position as his personal adjutant.
