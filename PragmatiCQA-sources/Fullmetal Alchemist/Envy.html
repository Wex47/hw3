   envy. Envy has the ability to shape-shift. This ability can be used to assume the form of any existing person (or original personas that Envy himself creates). He can even modify his own voice to directly copy others. Being a homunculus, Envy technically has no sex. Although he is capable of taking the form of both male and female people, he himself is referred as a male.

   Envy, who exists only to make humans suffer, bears more bitter resentment for humans than any other homunculus, and negatively treats with humans in the most personal and heartfelt manner. His hatred for humans has an immense emotional and personal foundation greater than any of their siblings'. Envy can easily be set off by insults due to their large and delicate ego, thus causing them to make mistakes.

    Appearance
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="7385c03d-43d8-4214-9a27-a7187dc7ce36">
   Envy usually appears as a pale-skinned androgynous teenage young man with a lean, muscular build. Envy has long, wispy hair, violet eyes with slit-like pupils, and wears a black crop top and skort, along with a matching headband with an alchemical, triangular symbol on it.
  </p>
  <p key="5b92d8dd-f019-475d-ac71-f62b0ce8104a">
   Although already formidable in his human form, Envy can assume a much larger, chimeric shape with a serpentine body, multiple pairs of legs, long human-like hair, a dog-like head and six pupils in its left eye. The most disturbing feature of Envy's unleashed form are the human faces and limbs protruding all over its body like drowning people momentarily attempting to surface before being pulled down by others. These are physical representations of the dozens of souls of

   that is Envy's core.
  </p>
  <p key="a8802306-5512-4c3c-b782-fbb3750ea771">
   In his true form, after most of the stone that is his core is destroyed, Envy is a small, caterpillar-like serpent with multiple legs (which is directly underneath him like those of mammals and birds) and a jaw-less, sucker-like mouth resembling those of lampreys and parasitic flatworms. He is virtually helpless save for attaching to another living thing to take control, but once able to reach a Philosopher's Stone, Envy can regain his full ability.

   , Envy is by far the cruelest Homunculus, joking around and delighting in human misery. Envy will kill without hesitation, usually playing on their target's emotions to have a psychological advantage, with no remorse for what he has done. He even takes pride in the suffering he inflicts, going so far as to boast about starting the

   </a>
   and ruining the reputations, lives, and souls of thousands with only a single, effortless move. Envy's only personal intention is to make humans fight each other and suffer.
  </p>
  <p key="8dc34fa7-d590-4b95-bc69-4962ccedef6c">
   Beneath this cruel and aggressive exterior, however, Envy is secretly jealous of humans' inner strength and the mutually beneficial friendships that they share, as most of Envy's kind show little real concern or emotional support for one another. This jealousy motivates Envy to hate and mistreat humans very personally; more personally, in fact, than any other homunculus.
  </p>
  <p key="d2b7253a-dc15-43a0-b301-bda60f3ba61e">
   Envy seems to resent being confronted about his inner envy. This eventually causes Envy to commit suicide. Notably, before this revelation, Envy disguised his inner motives so well that not even a slip of their true reasons occurred.
  </p>
  <p key="66c2dca4-1888-46e6-a601-e315c47180b2">
   Despite his callous, ruthless, and sinister persona, Envy occasionally shows a more silly, rambunctious, and even comical personality around his fellow homunculi, and even some humans. When referring to its human appearance as being "cute and youthful,"

   , where Envy constantly asked Ed to stop trying to beat them up, but Ed was in a fit of rage after being called short and would not back down.
  </p>
  <p key="c9592c8b-22fc-4654-ab46-264f5f14a5b3">
   Envy, at times, demonstrates a vanity streak over their appearance. He is irritated when Lust says his personality is 'vile' and nearly attacked Greed when he called Envy ugly. Upon his introduction, Envy refers to his preferred form as young and cute and very obviously enjoys looking attractive. However, he seems to greatly dislike his true appearance, and he yells at Ed and Ling to not to look at him while he was in said form.
  </p>
  <p key="5550afb1-25ab-4a94-a015-631794bacc7a">
   Envy does not have particularly good relationships with his fellow homunculi. He acts more as a handler for Gluttony than an equal and is unsympathetic to his grief over Lust's demise, acting annoyed and frustrated more than anything. He shows Wrath little respect, and does not interact much with Pride or Sloth. The only one he has shown concern for is Lust, going  so far as to demand that Wrath execute Mustang for killing her. Most interactions he has had with her were relatively positive compared to the rest of the homunculi. Envy's relationship with Greed is overtly antagonistic, as like the other homunculi, Envy perceives Greed as a traitor and it takes very little time for the two to throw insults at each other.
  </p>
  <p key="34d80007-faae-47cb-bd58-4fcb303f9c60">
   Deep down, Envy is the saddest homunculus, having never known any true content or satisfaction.

     Rapid Regeneration
    </b>
    : Envy can regenerate incredibly quickly from otherwise fatal injuries. One of the best examples (though not shown on-screen) is when he regenerates from half of his body after being swallowed by Gluttony. However, what is unique to Envy is the fact that after being killed enough, instead of remaining in humanoid form, he will expel a small, lizard or worm-like parasitic form that is easily killed.

     Shapeshifting

    : Envy has the ability to shape-shift into anything or anyone, whether it be real people, animals, or human aspects that they made up. He can transform into anything that doesn't exceed the size and weight of his true form, which, seeing how massively large it is, does not create much of an issue. This power comes in handy to go anywhere unnoticed or to travel fast, allowing Envy to shape-shift into an average citizen to blend into a crowd for stealth, or a fast-moving animal such as a horse or dog. Additionally, Envy can transform individual parts of his body, often using this ability in battle to transform his limbs into weapons. Even in his preferred human form, Envy's appearance bares his actual weight, something Ling Yao realized as he fought Envy. Envy's true form's weight grants him enormous strength and durability. In spite of his immense weight, Envy is very fast in all forms he assumes. It is also noted that even in his human form, Envy can make his arms extendable (to an unknown length, however), and apparently sharp (as proved by the injuries they inflicted upon

       True Form
      </b>
      : Under his monstrous form, Envy can use his strength to its maximum and become all the more dangerous, with him being easily able to crush rocks under his limbs or in his  jaws. Envy is also able to manipulate the human remains that cover his body, make them appear and disappear, and elongate his tongue to use it like a harpoon or binding rope, a continuation of his transformation ability.

        Envy can transform individual limbs into those of his true form, enabling him to gain massive arms and hands while otherwise remaining in his preferred body. He does not become unbalanced while doing this, despite being extremely disproportionate.

       Impersonation
      </b>
      : Envy is proficient at imitating the personality and traits of other people. This, paired with his shapeshifting, allows him to disguise himself as different individuals without arousing suspicion. The best example of this ability is when he fooled the people of Liore into believing he was Father Cornello, and Envy is even able to goad them into violence. However, his imitations are not perfect and Envy is prone to becoming overconfident in his disguises. People who are close to the one Envy is impersonating are also able to pick up on Envy's inconsistencies, such as when Hawkeye deduces Envy was not the real Mustang.

     Possession

    : Under his true, parasitic, original form, Envy's only remaining ability is to take control of the body of a human or Homunculus host. The host then becomes an extension of Envy's parasitic body, being able to take control of additional host bodies, using the host's soul or Philosopher's Stone to resupply Envy's strength. Envy seems to only be able activate this ability by biting his victims while in his weakened form. However, Envy has noted he cannot control someone by biting into automail, as seen when he failed to possess Edward. This ability is similar to Pride's ability to gain the traits of whomever he eats. With the body of a

   . There, seeing former enemies working together, Envy reveals themselves as Hughes' murderer by transforming once again into Gracia when Mustang refused to believe that his friend's life was taken by a "moron." Unfortunately, due to the Mannequin Soldiers in Envy making them flammable and with Mustang now in a fiery rage, the Homunculus has to escape into the sewers. Finding Lt. Riza Hawkeye, Envy assumes Mustang's form and tries to kill her, but is quickly found out and shot repeatedly with her many weapons. Although Envy does manage to catch hold of her, Mustang arrives and continues the destruction of Envy's new body until they are reduced back to their parasitic form once again.

   Envy is saved from execution by Mustang's hands through the combined intervention from Riza, Scar, and Edward in order to cease Mustang's quest for vengeance. After unsuccessfully trying to tempt the group into fighting each other with every horrible thing they have done to the other, Envy is mortified by how former enemies can put aside their hatred and work together. At that moment, Edward reveals to Envy that the homunculus is, in fact, jealous of human friendships and their ability to support each other. Realizing this truth, and feeling utterly disgraced by it and the fact that Edward sympathized with them, a tearful Envy pulls out their Philosopher's Stone and crushes it. As their decaying body begins to disintegrate, Envy laments not seeing where this ceasefire among former enemies would lead while they whisper, "Goodbye, Edward Elric," with tears in their eyes. Envy is the third Homunculus to die permanently (though by their own hand) in the manga and the 2009 anime.

    How Envy changes forms is slightly different in the two anime versions. In the first anime adaptation, Envy takes a new form by having a line of light go over their body at a rather quick pace.
    However, in the second anime adaptation, the color of the morphing process is red, discharges some electricity, and is slower, looking very similar to a transmutation (red sparks are common for transmutations with the Philosopher's Stone).

    Envy does not explicitly act in accordance with his sin in contrast to other homunculi such as Gluttony; who is a literal glutton, Greed; who openly admits to being greedy, and Sloth; who only uses the minimum amount of effort for anything. However, Envy displays schadenfreude (gaining satisfaction or pleasure from someone else's misfortune, i.e. laughing over Hughes' death and the Ishvalan Genocide) on numerous occasions, which is considered to be related to envy.

    Snakes and dogs are both symbols associated with envy. Envy has been shown transforming into a dog in the manga and in the 2009 anime. In the 2003 anime, Envy's final form is that of a large, serpentine dragon.

    Envy's clothing appears to be a part of his body. When they shapeshift, his clothes change with him and are even known to disappear when Envy becomes an animal. At one point, they are seen wearing, what appears to be, a normal coat overtop their usual attire that did not change and even flew off when they became a dog.

    Envy appears to have retained a jacket as a souvenir from Ishval. They are seen wearing the same type of jacket as the soldiers while they participated in the war, and also wear it while fighting Lan-Fan. Furthermore, it seemed to not have been a part of them, as Envy was seen retrieving it at the end of the fight.

    In many scenes during the second anime, Envy's hair has a greenish tint to it, albeit much darker. This is most likely referencing the first anime, where Envy's hair is green instead of black like in the manga. It, and the green skin color of their monstrous form could also be a subtle nod to the phrase "green with envy."

    Envy seems to share a close bond with Lust, as she is one of the few Homunculi they regularly converse with in a friendly manner. After Lust is killed by Colonel Mustang, Envy protests Wrath's decision to let Mustang and his subordinates live, saying that they killed her and made fools out of them (suggesting that they are genuinely upset by Lust's death).

    Although they seemed to bicker, Envy and Greed shared two preferences: both of them would rather avoid fighting if possible and both enjoyed their respective human form's good looks.
