   Xerxes was a relatively peaceful, thriving land despite the harsh conditions of the desert that surrounded it and, at the time of its sudden disappearance, had a population of over a million people. The majority of the population was sustained by crops grown in the plantations of the suburbs. The water used day-to-day was taken from wells and the upper-class people wore shawls. The urban areas developed around domed temples and lively trade markets. Xerxes appears to have had a markedly intellectual culture that fostered written languages as well as longstanding philosophical and

   studies. In an age before modern construction materials, the people of this land had mastered the construction of stone and brick buildings ranging from simple stucco-coated homes to lavishly enormous palaces. Though slavery seems to have been a common practice, it was possible for slaves to rise out of thralldom through education, even going so far as to become members of high society, as intellectuals were considered part of Xerxes' upper echelon. Xerxes was also a centralized monarchy, with a

   with extensive arcane knowledge of alchemy, the aging monarch saw his chance to transcend his dreaded and inevitable death through immortality. The creature agreed to become the royal court's primary consul on the subject of alchemy-based immortality and persuaded the desperate king to construct an
   array
   that would encompass all of Xerxes and use all the people's souls to create a source of immortality. A large trench was dug according to the Homunculus' specifications, while the citizens were given the impression that their dutiful king had ordered the construction of irrigation canals to defend their crops against drought. Beginning with the northern town of

   Over decades Xerxes decayed into ruins and the circumstances of its destruction remained unknown to anyone besides Hohenheim and the Homunculus. A legend of it's destruction being caused by a Philosopher's stone emerged sometime afterward, possibly spread by Hohenheim himself, but details were vague and most were skeptical to believe it. The Homunculus, later known as "Father", would return to the remains of Xerxes centuries later to destroy the evidence of his sin; having his son

      Xerxes could also be based on Plato's fictional thalassocratic civilization of Atlantis, based upon an equally fictional continent upon the Atlantic Ocean. Plato highly fictionalized how the Greeks effectively foiled the second Persian invasion (480-479 BCE) into Athens' defeating the Atlantean conquerors. However, the Greek resistance &amp; the whole Atlantis continent later violently sank into the ocean's depths by earthquakes &amp; floods, leaving mere only a muddy shoal.

As their Proto-Indo-European ancestors from Yamna culture had a moderate skin tone, brown eyes, and dark hair, the lighter phenotypes might've originated from Old Europe's non-Indo-European speakers who intermixed with Yamnayan new-comers. As these mixed ancestors migrated to Central Asia &amp; then Iran, India, Anatolia (Mitanni), they helped distribute both the darker &amp; lighter phenotypes.

      This draws interesting parallels to FMA series, where the country of Xerxes was destroyed by Father. Father then created the seven homunculi, and gave the highest position of power in the country to one of his sons, and the other homunculi watched over the Amestrian cities. It is fitting, that Father, like Artabanus, was killed by Edward Elric, with a mother from Amestris, and a father from Xerxes. Like Artaxerxes, Ed avenged the Xerxesian people by dealing the final blow on Father.

    pronunciation of the Persian name, thus causing confusion to American translators. The name of the country is pronounced and written "Ku-se-ru-ku-se-su" in Japanese, prompting the publishers of the manga's English translation to incorrectly romanize the word as "Cselkcess". Though original Japanese fact books spell the name similarly, the 2009 anime series has rectified this mistake, displaying the word as "Xerxes". As such, the English dub reflects the realization based on the proper spelling. Incidentally, the English pronunciation of the word begins with a "z" sound in contrast to the original Greek.
