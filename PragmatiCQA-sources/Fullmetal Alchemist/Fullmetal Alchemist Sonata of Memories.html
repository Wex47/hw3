Ed decides to check it out and Winry insists on going along to provide first aid. The trio reaches the barn, where the stranger is taking refuge, and sees a strange group surrounding it. When Ed's attempt to converse peacefully fails, the Elrics ward off the lot by a fight. Once inside the barn, the trio learns from the stranger that he's a rogue from an organisation named "Liberare" who targets military edifice for bambarding. He tells them about the next target being

   gets engaged in dealing with the situation. While repairing a broken wall with his alchemy, Ed notices a familiar girl present who he saw before at the barn where he fought the hostile group. Suspicious, he tries to call her but she responds by running away. Edward informs Mustang about it and they decide to go after her with Riza while Al and Winry are forced to stay behind to help the civilians involved in the incident.
  </p>
  <p key="4b347ca4-3f65-4bd3-8ee6-cd62dedb3330">
   The trio heads into the sewers but finds the culprits responsible for the bombing instead of the girl. Determined that girl isn't there, the trio heads back to the HQ. Back at HQ, Mustang exchanges the information found from the culprits to Edward and charges him with the bombing case. Edward refuses at first but is forced to comply. Mustang also charges him with Mount Tedesco bandits case. Winry again insists on tagging along to help but Edward bluntly refuses for her assistance saying that she is not 'ready' for it. Riza hands over her gun to Winry and tells Ed that the girl is prepared. Mustang along with Riza plans to tag as well and the party heads towards the Mount Tedesco.

  <p key="47dcbb14-1828-4307-a1f8-8bd2582ada17">
   The party successfully solves the Mount Tedesco's case and returns to the headquraters. Mustang commends on Winry's improved skills and asks her to stay. Winry says she wouldn't follow military orders but will stay to help her childhood friends anyway. With no leads to the bombing incidents, Mustang sends the trio (Ed, Al, and Winry) for an investigation. While investigating the trio crosses path with Randy and Cate whom the Elrics met while investigating on Chimera extermiation some time ago. Cate information about a man named Fagott who know about the current bombing incidents and the trio makes it way to Fagott's house.

   The Trio meets Cravis Fagott but he refuses to talk unless the party brings an alchemic gun. The party heads out and travels various places to collect materials for the gun. Once the party forges the alchemic gun, it heads back to Fagott. Fagott asks Edward to use the gun to test his determination. He also asks Winry her reason for fighting. Winry tells the group that she wants to protect people and doesn't want to go through the loss of losing someone again. Fagotts admires the party's determination and feelings and asks them to go to a man name Lute Zaxophone who is an alchemist-detective investigating the bombing incidents. With hope of acquiring some info, the party leaves for Reglotaria to meet Lute.
Arriving at Reglotaria the party witnesses another bomb blast with the mysterious girl in the vicinity again. Edward chases the girl while the rest of the party stays behind to help the citizens. While the group is helping the citizens they get attacked by the Liberare members but are saved by a mysterious man using alchemy. After the group fights off the terrorist, Edward returns with a failure and the mysterious man offers the group to rest at his house. The man later reveals himself to be Lute Zaxophone at his house and the group explains that they were actually looking for him. Lute insists on reporting to Fagott which party agrees to do.

  <p key="c164a2fd-3a78-4d6c-96c7-ab30e36a7999">
   At Fagott's mansion the group conjectures that the mysterious girl belongs to the Liberare which Winry continuously denies saying that she saw something. Before Winry can explain further what she saw, Lute interrupts her saying that East City might be in danger as there were no fatalities last time, Liberare would strike again. The party rushes toward the East City where they see the mysterious girl again. The party follows her and comes at a small Liberare hideout. There the party witnesses the girl arguing with some Liberare members who eventually attack her. Sensing that the girl is in danger Winry insists th party to help her. The girl runs away and the party successfully defeats the men. Lute makes a detective hunch that there may be more Liberare members hiding in the sewers. The party is unsure but follows his hunch anyway. The party indeed finds some men hiding there and gets rid of them and then heads back to HQ to report it to Colonel Mustang.

  <p key="74793d05-0ac7-42af-9e06-8aeb7956e134">
   At the HQ the party reports the consecutive events to Mustang. Winry again defends the mysterious girl and explains that when she saw her near the bombing incident, the girl was really trying hard to save the civilians. Lute discharges this idea by saying it was merely an act for deception. After listening to the party's point of views, Mustang reveals some basic info about the mysterious girl to the party. The party learns some basic info about Viola Amore and heads towards a town named Nelvo.
  </p>
  <p key="374570be-edbf-432a-93af-c7d5fcf7aa76">
   The party arrives at Nelvo and finally confronts Viola openly. Viola tells the party about herself. The party learns that she is an auto-mail engineer whose parents were killed by a

   attacking Nelvo, the party decides that she is innocent. The party decides that a Chimera making alchemist is involved with Liberare and heads towards the East City to report that. Viola also joins the party to amend for her trouble she caused the party and to search for her sister.
  </p>
  <p key="bf2bd9cf-4f62-4db1-8778-52c4d77872fe">
   When the party reaches back at HQ, Mustang informs the party that Fagott has been missing and it has been reported that he performed Chimera alchemy before, for which he was deprived of his State Alchemist certification, and could be responsible for it even now. Sensing his master's dignity at stake, Lute abandons the party to search for his master alone. Meanwhile, there is an uproar in the East City prison. Mustang and the party make an excursion to the prison to suppress it. They learn that the Chimera are behind the emancipation of criminals. The party meets a huge women Chimera who states that they won't allow any more prisoners to be victims of
   human alchemy
   and that would they clarify Fagott's name. However, the Chimera gets defeated and retreats with its group. Still dubious about the whole scenario, Ed, Al, Winry, and Viola decide to track down Fagott.

   The youth visits Fagott's mansion and finds Viola's sister's dairy. Viola's crave for revenge begins anew and she is about to set out to satiate until Winry calms her down and tells her that her flame for vengeance will only bring further sadness. Upon reporting their find to the Colonel, the youth now finds that Reglotaria, Nelvo, and Koko are under Chimeras' assault. The party leaves on Chimeras' extermination with
   Armstrong
   joining the party. During the extermination the party finds out that Fagott is residing in Cruz Ruins. The party now determined to find Fagott's plans leaves for the ruins.

  <p key="270aede5-d78b-48e3-9859-fc014687ede5">
   Reaching the ruins the party uncovers the true story. Fagott is actually taking shelter from false accusation. He is neither planning bombing incidents nor practicing human alchemy. The Chimeras protecting Fagott reveal that they are avenging Fagott on Lute's insistence. Lute shows up and reveals that he is actually the one responsible for the both crimes. He also reveals that he and Lila Amore were lovers. But since his alchemy was inconsistent and couldn't save the dying girl, he used human alchemy to morph her into a Chimera. Lute runs away after attempting to kill Viola which instead kills Fagott and unleashing Lila's Chimera which party reluctantly destroys. Before dying, Lila's Chimera makes an earnest request to the party to save Lute from his madness. After all the commotion Viola is admitted to the hospital and the party heads out to a secret deserted laboratory at the outskirts of the

   At the Laboratory, the party confronts Lute again and discovers more about his motives. Lute claims to have known the party long before they discovered him as he is Daimler's son. He wanted use Lincors' bioalchemy and Ed's talent to revive Lila but failed as the party defeated him. It was actually he who designed the Chimera's in Lincors' incident instead of his father who was merely a zealous alchemist. He also reveals that he was real State Alchemist and Cravis Fagott wasn't whereas the official records state otherwise. After revealing his past activities Lute reveals his present motives of resurrecting Lila by using the

   he procured by the bombing incidents. Viola arrives recovering from her injuries which she claims to be the work of a strange healing alchemist. Lute uses the power of the Philosopher's Stone and becomes a gigantic creature. The party tries to persuade Lute to follow Lila's true feelings but in vain. The party finally has to defeat obstinate Lute. While Lute is dying, Viola conveys Lila's final words which soothe him and enable him to die peacefully.

   The party returns to the HQ. Mustang thanks the civilians (Winry and Viola) involved to resolve the case and offers a handsome reward. But they blandly refuse stating that they were merely helping themselves. Viola makes her way to Nelvo while Ed, Al, and Winry decide to relax at Resembool.
