   One of the Alchemical Laboratories that operated within the influence and city limits of Central City, Lab 5 was located on the outskirts of town. Though Laboratory 5 was said to have shut down, the Elric Brothers' investigation reveals that the building's gate was guarded by an armed soldier at all times, the high wall surrounding it was set with razor wire, and alarmed booby traps and that the interior is kept lit just enough to accommodate passage through the facilities. Additionally, Lab 5's heinous secrets were guarded by the

   , the building's explosives are activated, destroying all evidence of the immoral experimentation that had gone on within. It is later revealed that all the scientists involved with Laboratory 5 had disappeared mysteriously just days before its destruction, and implied that the they had been used as ingredients for a Philosopher's Stone themselves. Laboratory 5 was also said to have been under the jurisdiction of Brigadier General

   The truth as to Lab 5's nature is later revealed to be far more sinister than even a human testing laboratory. Lab 5, along with the other four alchemical labs in the city, form the corners of a large pentagon that surrounds the city centre. Additionally, they are on the perimeter of a large circle that encompasses the pentagon, and is the inner layer of the
