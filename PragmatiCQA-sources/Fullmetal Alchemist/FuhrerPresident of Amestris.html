    In the 2003 anime, instead of having a successor appointed for Bradley at the
    end of the series
    , the office of Führer was instead retired, and the National Assembly took control of Amestris.

    The title "Führer" is the term adopted in Germany to indicate a special position known as Generalissimo, in which the person entitled accumulates the functions of head of state and government as well as supreme command of the military.

     <li key="ab7655c2-791e-42f0-a36a-a505d858dcc3">
      Although Adolf Hitler is the most well-known head of state to have held such a title, there have been others that have been called "Führer" before him, as well as many other world leaders who have held the position of Generalissimo, such as Francisco Franco of Spain and Josip Tito of Yugoslavia.

    Although the 2003 series makes strict relations between FMA and the real world's Germany and it's terms (and the English official translation having adopted the term Führer in most official media), the original Japanese term "Daisouto" is more accurately translated as "Generalissimo", which does not indicate any relations between the title of the head of state of Amestris to any specific real world leader.

    The term President refers to the position of the leader of a republican state.

      In a presidential republic, the president acts as both head of state and head of government.

     <li key="34bfffba-8223-48f0-9c48-f05f6f2a48ba">
      In a parliamentary republic, the president holds only the title of head of state, with the position of head of government being held by the prime minister.
