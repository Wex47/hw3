   Wrath is a boy ranging from twelve to fourteen-years-old, has pale skin, excluding his left leg and right arm, which belonged to Ed previously; violet eyes with slit pupils and shaggy black hair growing past the shoulders in back and growing down over the sides of the face, all the way to his collarbone in the front. He initially wore rags made from transmutated leaves, but was later given regular clothes by Izumi Curtis and later, is given an outfit similar to

   Initially, Wrath started out as a shy and timid young boy, staying in the shadows to avoid being spotted, but runs away if he is, but after meeting and staying with his mother Izumi and the Elric brothers, he's shown traits of a typical kid (i.e. curiosity, playful innocence). After being kidnapped by Envy (disguised as King Bradley), and being fed the red stones, he becomes a spiteful person, who openly declared his hate towards his mother for his "incomplete life", as well as chiding Edward for acting as God for attempting to resurrect his mother and at the same time derisively showing gratitude for giving him both an arm and leg, and lastly the ability to perform alchemy.

   Out of all of the homunculi, Wrath felt a particular closeness to Sloth and thinks of her as his "mother" (presumably to not only reject but to replace Izumi), preferring to team up with her and he is quite protective of the latter as well. He's also shown to be vengeful to whomever harms her, as he did with Ed and Lust. After Sloth's death (partly because of his involuntary assistance), he became so desperate to have her revived several times, all attempts fail which eventually resulted in

   , Wrath was shown to be very depressed over Izumi's death, no longer thinking of Sloth as his "mother". During his final battle with Gluttony, Wrath finally admits that he has planned on sacrificing himself, showing a sense of humanity, while openly declaring that he wants neither Alphonse nor Ed to endure any more hardships; thus making the conscious decision to die while only wanting to be with Izumi.

   Overall Wrath was just someone, who desired maternal warmth, only to find it with his mother/creator Izumi in the end. He also noticeably became distressed at the sound of crying infants, the most notable example being
   Rosé's child
   , which became one of his known weaknesses.

   Wrath is a Homunculus, and thus has amazing powers of recuperation, strength, speed, and perpetual longevity; like his parents, even without alchemy, he possesses a strong form of martial arts which is obviously self-taught in that area as he relies mainly on some form of instinct and natural talent. Furthermore, while in possession of Edward's lost limbs, Wrath displays the ability to perform Alchemy without a transmutation circle - something which is unique to both Alchemists and Homunculi. But his particular Homunculus power is the ability to merge and fuse his body with virtually any matter, both living and inanimate, organic and inorganic, and he can even accelerate the speed in which he merges through the Alchemy he uses. He also has the ability to move his altered body parts like he did with Izumi's clothes to ensnare Alphonse.

   Despite being a kid, Wrath was shown to hold his own from being attacked by a monstrous

   (with the stones he ate), he also can fight fairly against battle-capable opponents like Edward, Alphonse, and Lust (both physically and alchemically). He also has demonstrated great endurance, taking the most amount of physical punishments out of all the homunculi.

   All in all, it could be implied that Wrath could be one of the more powerful homunculi (alongside Envy, Lust and Pride) considering the fact that he can use alchemy which could be dangerous to the other homunculi, especially if he has their remains to his advantage (as he did with Lust.)

   . Izumi later regretted her decision after hearing him cry and tried to reach him, but the gate closed before she could. Wrath spent much time inside the Gate, waiting and wanting to get out all while his body aged and the hate for the mother who had condemned him to the absolute darkness of the Gate grew. When the Gate opened while the Elric Brothers were trying to resurrect their mother, Wrath acquired both

   Wrath states that long after, he opened the Gate himself, but for some reason could not remember who he was, and then lived on Yock Island, the same island where the Elric Brothers spent one month of Alchemy training many years prior. Following a quick battle with Izumi and the Elrics, he was forgiven by the former and was allowed to stay with the Curtis family. However, after being captured by the military and found by

   as a distraction so Ed could get his mother's body bone, Wrath appeared and snatched it, fusing it with himself. Wrath then reentered the house and stopped Lust from attacking 'mommy'. Sloth tried to run away, but Ed followed her. Wrath was about to follow them, but Lust stopped him. They fought until Wrath found the locket Edward had thrown to Lust previously. As with other Homunculi, Lust was paralyzed by being in close proximity to the body parts of the person intended to be revived (in this case a lock of hair attached to the locket). With this advantage, Wrath used his borrowed limbs to perform alchemy and killed her.
  </p>
  <p key="b8869b37-1cce-4499-bfdf-bf11d39b49b7">
   Later, Wrath went to save Sloth and fused himself with her so he would "never lose her". However, because he was still fused with Trisha's bone, his close contact paralyzed Sloth. Ed used alchemy to turn Sloth's liquid body into ethanol, causing her to evaporate around Wrath, severely burning half of his body (the part still fused) and leaving him heavily scarred.
  </p>
  <p key="6f33e2a4-e9ac-4b57-ae05-56ede98b9d20">
   Later, Izumi tried to convince Wrath to come with her. Wrath, insisting that Sloth was his real mother, refused and ran away. He didn't appear again until he, Dante, and Envy were inside the underground city. He begged for Dante and Envy to allow him to use the Philosopher's Stone to bring Sloth back to life. Envy refused and kicked him off repeatedly for his behavior. When Wrath appeared a short time later to try again, Dante opened the Gate with Rose's baby and had the Gate Children dismember Wrath's right arm and left leg (which originally belonged to Ed), taking away Wrath's alchemic abilities.

Alphonse tried to argue, but Wrath told him that he wanted to go to his real home, where "Mommy" was. Alphonse went through with the transmutation and Wrath, in his untainted form with all his limbs, was greeted by Izumi in front of the Gate. He was last seen walking to his biological mother and embracing her before the gate closed.

    Whereas the manga storyline has

    A common misconception among fans is that Wrath's real name was "Aoya", due to Izumi saying this after she committed human transmutation. However, it means "my son" in Japanese and is translated to "my boy" in the English dub.

    In the 2003 anime, Wrath is the only Homunculus whose remains cannot be used against him (because Izumi used his remains to transmute him), but he possesses strong phobias of The Gate and freezes upon hearing a wailing baby as it reminds him of how he was taken into the gate.

      However, it should also be noted that Pride was an aging homunculus, too, even though he wasn't constructed from his own remains. It remains unclear as to how old Pride actually is, however, and if the human-based aging process is similar to Wrath's growth (it is likely that Dante's alchemy influenced how Pride aged).

However, it could indicate that the theory, of how Homunculi do not have souls, may be false; this may likely be true as Majhal, another alchemist known for performing Human Transmutation, did not create a Homunculus as Karin, the person he thought was dead and tried to revive, was alive and her soul could not be used to create a Homunculus. Considering how Majhal tried to create living versions of the doll based on Karin, it is unlikely he would forsake a Homunculus that greatly resembled Karin which likely concludes a Homunculi wasn't created as the soul, of the deceased person, is needed.

    In the end, Wrath is the only homunculus to find solace upon dying and accepting his creator Izumi, as opposed to denying the relationship between them (which is saying something since his cardinal sin is wrath.)
