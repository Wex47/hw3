   while working in hiding. While he seems completely pragmatic, as he knew in order to save the world, he had to shed some blood as he was seen killing some soldiers in his way. He also seemed righteous, as his intention was to save the world and bring the military down to expose their secrets. Despite his intelligence and a good operator that works alone, he shows no hesitation when he insulted the Elric Brothers when he found out they committed taboo and laughed maniacally when he temporarily succeed to freeze the Central Command, revealing his unhinged disorder as well as his recklessness to slice the Fuhrer without any hesitation.

   Isaac was a former State Alchemist who served in the Ishvalan Civil War. After the war's completion he turned in his commission and resigned from the military. He went into hiding and began working with the anti-establishment movement against the militaristic government of Amestris.

   As his title indicates, he is a formidable Alchemist specializing in controlling water, able to freeze any source of water, even sources with water essence in them, allowing him to use any available source of water for a variety of feats such as paths to walk on or forming crude weapons to strike at his opponents with. As a last resort attack, he can also freeze his own blood so as to strike his target. Contrary to his title, McDougal is capable of more than freezing, and upon touching a target he can boil the water so as to create a thick cloud of vapor so as to make his escape. By touching his opponent, he can freeze or boil the water in their body to instantly kill them; however, this technique is ineffective when not used on flesh, such as Ed's automail.
  </p>
  <p key="5122c340-7884-4434-aa57-edded4cdea84">
   His most powerful technique involves drawing several transmutation circles around Central in a formation similar to the design of his transmutation. With this formation, the large amounts of ice that can be created from the transmutation circles are apparently endless as not even Mustang's flames were able to subdue this attack. Destroying the transmutation circles are the only way to disable this technique, which also proves difficult as the ice buries them endlessly and protects them from damage.

  <p key="54448072-83fd-4517-ad0c-afa28960ee7c">
   As of episode two, it is hinted that his abilities are linked with

   , which would explain how he was able to perform this attack while standing in the ice he himself created, and after destruction, recreate itself. To quickly access his alchemy, Isaac has embedded his transmutation circle on his gauntlet and tattooed it on the palm of his hand. His circle consists of a point within a circle with two curves around them which make contact with the borders of another circle and two lines coming from the center touching the borders, resembling an eye with a line across and a text on an external circle. Once he activates his Philosopher's Stone, he can be seen transmuting with his untattooed hand as well.

  <p key="70d29cce-6d9b-4a97-a65b-c7e507d86ec0">
   During his brief appearance, Isaac also demonstrated considerable agility and combat prowess, able to fend off both the Elric Brothers and dodge Alex Armstrong's assault. He is also a skilled tactician, able to fend off the military forces of Central and various Alchemists using well-placed alchemic attacks.

    Though having a short appearance in the show, he hints at the supposed evil activity of the Führer and the Military, possibly already knowing that Bradley is a Homunculus or that they were just using Amestris as a Transmutation Circle.

However, it clearly wasn't intended for McDougal to try to initiate a citywide Transmutation Circle in Central City, given Father's reaction to Isaac's actions.  What exactly Lust may have hoped is unclear, although it may be implied he's one of the candidates for
