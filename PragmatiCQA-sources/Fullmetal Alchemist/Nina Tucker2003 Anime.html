Ed later discovers Nina's letter partially incinerated while preparing to take Alexander for a walk and his subsequent attempts to gain access to Nina's father's research results in Brigadier General

   After Nina is transmuted into a chimera, Grand who knew the truth about her mother, collects her in order to study her and create chimera soldiers from her father's research. Edward manages to help Nina escape from custody, and calls out to her but she flees into an alley where she encounters Scar. Realizing what Nina has become and the pain she is in, Scar recites a prayer as he uses his

   to ultimately deconstruct her before Edward can catch up. Rather than dying more-or-less peacefully in her home, as in the manga, the 2003 anime has Nina completely blown apart, with almost nothing remaining of her but large bloodstains on the walls and street. Upon discovering Nina's remains, Alphonse quickly deduces what has happened to her. A horrified Edward apologizes to the girl he had grown to love as a sister and mourns for her, becoming conflicted over whether or not to become part of a system steeped in such horrors and to his chagrin, he and Alphonse are tasked with going through Nina's father's research. At first, Ed thought

   , it is revealed that Tucker has survived in custody as Ed discovers while infiltrating Laboratory 5. Upon meeting Tucker again, all of Ed's memories of Nina flash through his mind as he expresses his continuing bitterness towards Tucker for what he did to his daughter. By this time, Tucker has made attempts to revive Nina by using her remains to clone her a body and filtering out the contamination from Alexander's DNA by siphoning it into his own body and becoming a grotesque Human Chimera himself. Ed is initially horrified at this and warns Tucker that whatever he creates will not be the real Nina.

   Since Tucker's will is not strong enough to call back Nina's soul or even create a new soul for her, he is only able to create a lifeless Nina doll, even after using the Philosopher's Stone contained within Alphonse's armor. Nonetheless, Tucker continues trying to find a way of reviving Nina as her lifeless doll form is last seen in his arms while he makes sketchy blueprints on a wall.
