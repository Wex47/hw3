   Aerugo is a Principality governed by Prince
   Claudio Rico
   . As a Principality, Aerugo is a much smaller country compared to Amestris but is able to retain control over the Aerugo border war. The country is also known as more of a trading country in general and does spend little if none of its time on warfare, preferring to spend its resources on cultivating its massive farmland for trade and commerce.

   The country used to have peaceful dealings with Amestris until Führer King Bradley and the Homunculi came to power (or expanded power). Aerugo has spent a large amount of money, troops, and machines on fighting Amestris and had greatly damaged South Amestris but could not defeat Amestris because of its powerful military might, making it one of the first real threats to Aerugo's massive economy.
  </p>
  <p key="7170dd76-601b-4ba8-99c5-2bc29df9222e">
   Notably, Aerugo involved itself in the

   by providing Ishvalan soldiers with small arms whose model numbers had been effaced. But when Ishvalan refugees implored Aerugo to grant them sanctuary from the massacre, the Aerugonian government balked at assisting them and disavowed all knowledge of smuggling in weapons to avoid violent reprisal by the Amestrian Military.

   According to the video game "Prince of the Dawn", certain citizens of Aerugo (namely, Prince Claudio) pushed for a peace treaty with Amestris due to the inordinate amount of bloodshed on both sides of the border conflict, but such peace talks could not succeed so long as

   as well as a strip of Aerugo's borders. This was seen as an insult at first by the Aerugo Royal Family. Aerugo then brought in heavy amounts of men, not knowing that it was playing exactly into Amestris' plan. Amestris slaughtered the Aerugo forces easily with their superior military technology, the sheer amount of men, and powerful alchemy. All of

   quickly turned into an uproar and South Headquarters sent out most of its forces. These forces ripped through Aerugo's and charged deeper into Aerugo's lands. Aerugo sent over half of their military to stop the purge and was successful in pushing Amestris back to an Aerugo border town. Because of this, Southern Amestris begin losing soldiers, population, and influence in the government. Southern Amestris stopped helping to exterminate Ishvalans in order to focus on the Aerugo war by sending in its alchemists. This was ineffective, and Amestris' forces were slowly pushed back into Fotset.

   Amestris' Southern forces were fighting hard against Aerugo and were being reinforced by Central City with tanks and troops alike. The East managed to spare a small number of troops as well. Amestris was slowly gaining ground because of their military technology, alchemy, elite soldiers, and superior numbers. Once Aerugo had been completely pushed back into its land, Amestris attempted to conquer more of the country.
