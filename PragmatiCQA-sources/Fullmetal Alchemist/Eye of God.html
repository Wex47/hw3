     <li key="a0a2d431-0bfa-46f8-bc40-257cc5a94e05">
      In the manga the eye is a light pinkish shade of red, probably to match the eyes of the homunculi.
     </li>
     <li key="5ece20e0-c064-4802-81e4-455089ea04b0">
      In the 2003 anime the eye is a shade of purple, matching the eyes of the homunculi and the Gate Children.
     </li>
     <li key="e501bf74-36d8-479b-8341-6213bc437102">
      In the 2009 anime the eye is grey.
     </li>
     <li key="917d29bf-ce19-4893-b3de-9b0f33e910f1">
      Due to that change in the 2009 anime, the eye color only matches the homunculi/father eye color in the manga and the 2003 series.

    The being, or the Gate itself, is presumably the source of all alchemy. When Edward sacrifices his ability to use alchemy, Edward's Gate dissolves severing his connection with the Truth and the being within the Gate,
   </li>
   <li key="9fd7f413-1980-4a66-a0d2-69960dfda18d">
    Through Father's dialogue to his sacrifices before achieving his purpose, he asks them if they ever considered the possibility that "the world they live in is a massive organism", and goes further describing it as a "neural system". This seems to hint at the nature of this entity's function, as a metaphysical neurological system storing all information in the universe, which may further be implied by the eyes and synapse-like hands. It may also be a reference to the Gaea hypothesis, which suggests that the biosphere (the totality of life) of the Earth itself should be considered a life form ("Gaea" is the name of the personification of the earth in Greek Mythology).
   </li>
   <li key="17b61f65-3eca-407c-8e16-49bed7ef44e9">
    Some fans have noticed the possible connection with the eye's appearance and some illustrations of the
    Ein Sof
    , something not far-fetched with the kabbalistic allegory in Fullmetal Alchemist and the role represented by the eye itself.
