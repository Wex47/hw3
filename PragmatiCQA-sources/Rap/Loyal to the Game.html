   Loyal to the Game is an album containing remixes of previously unreleased music recorded by Tupac Shakur before his death in 1996. Released in the US on December 14, 2004 (December 12 in the UK), Loyal to the Game was produced by Eminem, and is consequently very reminiscent of Eminem's style.

   According to an interview with MTV, Eminem was so moved by Tupac's life and work that he wrote a letter to Tupac's mother, Afeni Shakur, asking her to consider letting him produce the album. Shakur agreed, giving Eminem the go ahead. The album featured two singles- "Thugs Get Lonely Too" and "Ghetto Gospel".

   Eminem used various unusual production techniques during the creation of this album, namely modifying the pace and pitch of Tupac's voice to better suit the beats produced. There was also various uses of the cutting and pasting of vocals to produce new words now synonymous with current rap culture.

   The Remix for the title track was originally recorded back in 1994 by 2Pac and Big Syke. DJ Quik slowed down their vocals to fit the beat he produced, and suggested to Afeni Shakur that the title of the album should be "Loyal To The Game".
