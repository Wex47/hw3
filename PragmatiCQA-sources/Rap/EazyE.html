    Straight Outta Compton

   was released on August 8 1988 with Arabian Prince leaving the group just a couple weeks before the release. Straight Outta Compton generated a lot of negative attention due to its explicit lyrics with many news stations at the time claiming that it "encourages violence". Despite this, the album went triple platinum and debuted a number 4 on the Billboard Hot 200. N.W.A. generated more negative attention when MTV refused to play their music video. A month later on September 13th 1988, Eazy's debut album was released entitled

   , which went double platinum and included a remixed version of Boyz In The Hood. In 1989 The FBI sent Ruthless a letter indirectly referring to their song "F*** Tha Police*. In December 1989, Ice Cube left the group over royalty disputes, feeling that he wasn't payed enough for writing most of the lyrics for Straight Outta Compton and Eazy-Duz-It. Ice Cube's first solo album was released only around 6 months later with no mention of N.W.A.. N.W.A. Took a different approach and dissed Ice Cube with multiple tracks on their EP 100 Miles and Runnin', referring to him as Benedict Arnold, the infamous American Revolution traitor. Ice Cube fired back on his second album in 1991 with the track "No Vaseline" with N.W.A. Not even attempting to make a response, officially ending the beef. Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. Both left N.W.A and Ruthless in early 1991 to start their own label with

   . Eazy claims that Shug forced him to sign the release papers with threats to his family. N.W.A's final album was released on May 28th 1991 and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard charts. Eazy released 2 EPs after N.W.A., one entitled 5150: Home 4 Tha Sick in 1992, which was originally supposed to be his 2nd album titled "temporarily insane". His 2nd EP was known as It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa, which included 2 Dre diss tracks: It's On, and Real Muthaphukkin G's. Around this time Eazy was starting to build up the Ruthless roster again, with Compton rappers Dresta, and B.G Knocc Out helping him write the track real muthaphukkin G's. In 1994, Eazy signed Bone Thugs N Harmony, a rap group from Ohio, which was one of Eazy's smartest moves in his career as a manager. In December 1994, Eazy ran into Ice Cube at a club in NYC and 2 finally made up after almost 4 years. Cube and Eazy talked for almost 2 hours and brought up the idea of an N.W.A. reunion. However on February 24 1995, Eazy was brought to the hospital for what was believed to be pneumonia but was instead HIV/AIDS. Eazy died on March 26 1995 and his final album was released 10 months later on January 30 1996. Many conspiracy theories have surrounded Wright's death, with the fact that he died so quickly, and none of his children's mothers ending up with the virus, many people believe he was injected with the virus. Many people blame Jerry Heller as Eazy died only a couple months after cutting Jerry loose from Ruthless. Others blame Shug Knight as Shug clearly isn't afraid to take care of something that he sees as a threat, and he even joked about how AIDS injections are how they kill people now "Eazy-E style" on Jimmy Kimmel.
