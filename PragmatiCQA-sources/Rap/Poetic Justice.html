   Singleton named the film Poetic Justice because the main character, Justice, writes beautiful poems which she recites throughout the movie. The poems are in fact from Maya Angelou. Angelou also appears in the movie as one of three elderly sisters, May, June and April (called the "Calendar Sisters") that the characters meet at a road side family reunion. The Last Poets make an appearance toward the end of the film.
