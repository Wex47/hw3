   Until the End of Time is the third posthumous album release from the late rapper Tupac Shakur. This album consists of a collection of unreleased material and remixed songs from Tupac's "Makaveli" period while signed to Death Row Records. This album was the second album released without Shakur's creative input. Until the End of Time was very highly anticipated and ended up being the best selling hip hop album in 2001. The single "Until the End of Time" features Richard Page and contains a sample from the song "Broken Wings", a 1980s song by Mr. Mister (from which Page is lead singer). The video for this song featured a compilation of unreleased footage of Tupac Shakur. Suge Knight and Afeni Shakur were the executive producers of this album, with ten of the songs being produced by longtime Tupac producer and friend Johnny "J" and Cold 187um. The album was certified 3x Platinum.
