   Gridlock'd is a 1997 film starring Tupac Shakur, Tim Roth, and Thandie Newton. It was the directorial debut of Vondie Curtis-Hall, who also wrote the story and screenplay. The film's opening was relatively low, despite critical acclaim for its powerful and gritty substance. Its opening weekend netted $3,603,049 and it finished finally at only $5.5 million. The film paid tribute to star Tupac Shakur who had been murdered several months before the film's release.
