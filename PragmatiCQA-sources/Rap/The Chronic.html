   , released December 15, 1992 on his former own label, Death Row Records, and distributed by Priority Records. The album was named after a slang term for high-grade marijuana. The album cover is an homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. The Chronic was recorded by Dr. Dre following his departure from N.W.A and Ruthless Records over a financial dispute, and consequently featured both subtle and direct insults at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A group member, Eazy-E.
