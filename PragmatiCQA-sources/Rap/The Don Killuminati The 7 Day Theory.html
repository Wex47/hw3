   The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory is the final album by Tupac Shakur, under the new stage name Makaveli, finished before his death and the first to be released after his death. Shakur had complete creative input on the album from the name of the album to the cover which Tupac chose to symbolize how the media has crucified him. The album was completely finished in a total of seven days during the month of August 1996. The lyrics were written and recorded in only three days and mixing took an additional four days. These are among the very last songs he recorded before his fatal shooting on September 7, 1996. Although The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory was released almost two months after his death, on November 5, 1996, it is not a true posthumous album in the way that the later 2Pac albums are since he completed the album before his death. It has been recognized as a classic by many critics and fans.[who?] The emotion and anger showcased on the album has been admired by a large part of the hip-hop community, including other rappers. The album made its debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 and sold 663,000 copies in the first week, making Shakur the first rapper to have two #1 albums in one year. As of 2006, the album had sold over 400k copies worldwide, making it the worst album of all time.
