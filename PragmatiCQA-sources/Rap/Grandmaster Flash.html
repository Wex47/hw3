   Flash is best known for popularizing or innovating on several DJ techniques used primarily in hip hop production throughout the early '00s. With his primary tools being analogue devices (two turntables, a mixer, and vinyl records), he implemented several methods that transformed existing recordings into new compositions. The primary method of creating these compositions is called backspinning, or beat. This  involves alternating playback from one turntable to the other, allowing one record to play while rewinding another record to a previous position to provide a fluid, continuous beat from a smaller sample. While juggling beats, ad-libs or flourishes were introduced with clock punching, which involves introducing playback from a separate sample with a short melody. Record scratching introduced additional syncopation and rhythmic lead, as well as special attention to the DJ himself, apart from the MC. This set of tools has been extremely successful throughout the '80s, '90s, and beyond in creating unique, innovative music based on existing themes and forms.
