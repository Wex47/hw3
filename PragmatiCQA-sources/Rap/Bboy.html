  <p key="e44dcc11-41d9-4b69-a56d-0a2f0d756389">
   Battles are an integral part of the b-boying culture. They can take the form of a cypher battle and an organized battle. Both types of battles are head to head confrontations between individuals or groups of dancers who try to out-dance each other.
  </p>
  <p key="51752054-9d95-403e-ac39-4145d826ca46">
   The cypher (or the circle) is the name given to a circle of b-boys and/or b-girls who take turns dancing in the center. There are no judges (other than the participants of the cypher itself), concrete rules or restrictions in the cypher, only unsaid traditions. Although people aren't always battling each other in the cypher, there are many times when battles do take place. B-boying began in the cypher and only later did organized competition develop. This type of battle is how b-boying was originally and it is often more confrontational and more personal. The battle goes on until it ends for one of many possible reasons, such as one dancer admitting defeat. Cypher culture is more present in communities with a stronger emphasis and understanding of original, true hip hop culture. Battling in the cypher is also a common way for dancers to settle issues between each other whether it be individuals or crews.
  </p>
  <p key="8ffafecd-58ae-4680-aab4-71088b3c7324">
   Organized battles, however, set a format for the battle, such as a time limit, or specify a limit for the number of dancers that can represent each side. Organized battles also have judges, who are usually chosen based on years of experience, level of deeper cultural knowledge, contribution to the scene and general ability to judge in an unbiased manner. There are however, times when non b-boys or non b-girls are chosen to judge by some organizers, and these type of events (jams) are often looked down upon by the b-boying community. Organized battles are far more publicized and known to the mainstream community, and include famous international-level competitions such as Battle of the Year, UK B-Boy Championships Redbull BC One, Freestyle Session and R16 Korea. It should be noted however that a view exists that a trend in recent years has been to place an over-emphasis on organized battles, which takes away from a more originality-based aspect of the culture that is often more emphasized in cypher culture.

   There are many different styles one can use to break, often stemming from a given b-boy or b-girl's area of origin and dancing influences. Although there are some generalizations on the kind of styles that exist, many b-boys and b-girls will try to combine elements from different styles with their own ideas and knowledge in order to create their own style.

  <p key="91ba70e2-ebd5-4973-b63b-368873259728">
   Power - When people ask b-boys if they "breakdance," usually this is what is comes to mind. Power moves deal with full-body spins and rotations that give the illusion of defying gravity. Headspins, backspins, windmills, flares, airtracks, 1990s, 2000s, jackhammers, crickets, turtles, hand glide, halos, etc.

  <p key="d3df7628-6615-4dea-b330-be5ab2a1ab33">
   Abstract - A very broad term of a b-boy style, but may include the incorporation of threading footwork, freestyle movement to hit beats, the inclusion of house dancing, broken link styles  and "circus" styles (balance, tricks, contortionism, etc.)
  </p>
  <p key="b8acb9fa-73ad-4751-a520-6078f8f6c956">
   Blowup Style - A type of dancing based on the "wow factor" of some power, freeze, trick, and circus style. Blowup styles are made to pile as many difficult trick combinations together right after one another to "smack" the other b-boy. Usually comes after becoming proficient in other styles first due to the amount of control and practice needed. These are the names of some of the moves: airbaby, airchair, hollow backs, solar eclipse, reverse airbaby, etc. The main point in blowup style is that a b-boy needs to be able to go from one move to another, or better yet, transition between several moves back and forth.
