    Lil Eazy-E
   </b>
   is an American rapper and the eldest son of Eazy-E. Wright Jr. was born and raised in Compton, California, in the same house his father grew up in. He was 10 years old when his father died. He first appeared on the hip hop scene with Daz Dillinger, during which time an independent album release was expected. However, no contract was actually signed.  Lil Eazy E formally was signed to Virgin Records; however, a change in executive management at Virgin, delayed the release of his anticipated album "Prince of Compton".  Lil Eazy-E left Virgin Records for a deal with Blackground and Universal Motown Records Group in 2006. With Blackground Records being urban based, no album was released so Lil Eazy E used this time to record singles upon singles.  During which time, he did features with several artists including The Game, Jim Jones, Kokane, as well as other artists.  Lil Eazy E released a mixtape which received international attention.   In 2011, Blackground finally released Lil Eazy E, giving him the freedom to do as he pleased with his music.

   Lil Eazy E used this idle time at Blackground, to take a step back and in 2006, Lil Eazy E took a step back from the microphone to go and work for his late father's company, Ruthless Records, learning about the business side of music. Fast forward to 2011 when Lil Eazy E stepped out from behind the executive desk at Ruthless Records to become CEO of his own production company, NWA Entertainment; CEO of his own management company, High Powered Productions; producer of music from various top artists,  and is working on projects with various artists, companies, tv, and movie production.  With over 49 unreleased new recordings in the past year as a solo artist as well as over 20 songs with his group, Compton MoneyGang, Lil Eazy E is set to release an album late 2014 which will include features from the likes of Bone Thugs N Harmony, Ice Cube, and many others.
