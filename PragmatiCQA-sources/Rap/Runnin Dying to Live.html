   "Runnin' (Dying to Live)", by Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. was the first released single from the posthumous soundtrack album Tupac: Resurrection. The video contains interviews of both Tupac and Biggie. It is the only song from the album to feature a music video. The chorus is from Edgar Winter's song "Dying to Live" (from the album Edgar Winter's White Trash), which was edited to a higher pitch for the song. The song won the award for "best soundtrack song" in 2003. It charted at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100. Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. originally recorded the song together in 1994. The song was originally produced by New York producer Easy Mo Bee and was called "Runnin' (From tha Police)". The interview of Biggie was recorded only a couple of weeks before his death.

   The video version mutes all language, violence and drug references, even Biggie's comment about 2Pac being shot again (the radio version only censors all profanity except the word "bitches" in 2Pac's verse). In the video, it has past images of 2Pac and Biggie, and once their verses end, the volume appears to drop lower.
