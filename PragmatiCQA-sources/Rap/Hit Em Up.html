   "Hit 'Em Up" is a diss song by Tupac Shakur, featuring his rap group the Outlawz. It is the B-Side to the 1996 single "How Do U Want It". The song viciously insults several East Coast rappers, chiefly Tupac Shakur's enemy and former friend, The Notorious B.I.G.. "Hit 'Em Up" was produced by long-time collaborator Johnny J and samples "Don't Look Any Further" by Dennis Edwards.

   The single was based around the encounter in an recording studio in which he was shot 5 times. After the incident, he claimed Daddy and The Notorious B.I.G. who were at the building at the time, had prior knowledge of the shooting. He accuses B.I.G. for being responsible for this shooting in the single, and further insults B.I.G. by suggesting he had sex with his wife. Many believe this song was the significant paramount to Tupac's death in Las Vegas, three months after this single was released, in which comparing various theories together, people believe that his death was specific "revenge" against his insults towards B.I.G.
