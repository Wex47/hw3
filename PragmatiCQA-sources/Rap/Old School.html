   "Old School" is a song by rapper Tupac Shakur from his hit album Me Against the World. The song features Tupac reminiscing about the "good old times" of rap, and rap artists. No music video was ever made, although it was made for radio, and was featured on the Dear Mama CD single. In the song, 2Pac describes his respect for artists such as Big Daddy Kane and LL Cool J, a rapper who he feuded with a year after the song's release. The song peaked at #1 on the U.S. Rap chart and #9 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's chorus is a scratched sample from Brand Nubian's song "Dedication."
