   R U Still Down? (Remember Me) was the first posthumous album by 2Pac, released in 1997. Although it is the second album release after his death, it is the first to be finished without the creative input of 2Pac. Having left a large body of work behind, this was the first release from his mother's new imprint Amaru Entertainment, set up to control his posthumous releases. It spawned two hit singles, "Do for Love" and "I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto", the former of which (Do For Love) has been certified Gold by the RIAA. The album eventually reached multi-platinum status, a trend that many of his subsequent posthumous albums would follow.
