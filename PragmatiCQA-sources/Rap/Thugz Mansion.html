   "Thugz Mansion" is a song by 2Pac, released as a posthumous single with two known popular versions both released on the 2002 album Better Dayz. The original version was rapped over two acoustic guitars, and features fellow rapper Nas as well as singer J. Phoenix. It is the second-to-last track in Disc 1 of Better Dayz. However, it is the more soulful 7" Remix version, featuring singer Anthony Hamilton, featured as track 2 on disc 2 of Better Dayz, that is the only song from the album to feature a music video. It charted at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100. The original acoustic version is also found on Nas' God's Son under the name "Thugz Mansion (N.Y.)", with Tupac's second verse and Nas's verse switching places and Tupac's first verse replaced with an original Nas verse.

   Thugz Mansion was 2Pac's depiction of heaven. One of the most meaningful songs by 2Pac, this song talks about how he would rest in peace, and that he would eventually find happiness when he is in a place where all the troubles and pains of his life come to an end, and that he would want to end up in that place of peace after he dies.

  </h2>
  <p key="c9e43b99-4713-407b-a3ad-688d0a3918d2">
   Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Ya know what i mean? Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... at thug mansion
  </p>
  <p key="3180b76f-0b93-4be6-bdf8-e838a75dd4b0">
   (Verse One: 2Pac)
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would of tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'
  </p>

   (Chorus: J. Phoenix + (Nas)
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessey, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothing but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
  </p>
  <p key="a8fb2cfc-5cb6-4c6a-a499-4429ef244be5">
   (Verse Two: Nas)
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm trying to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ozzie Davis, grey hair maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden wings in 'Thugz Mansion'
  </p>

   (Verse Three: 2Pac)
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
