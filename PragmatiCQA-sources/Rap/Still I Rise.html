   Still I Rise is an album by 2Pac and his group The Outlawz excluding member Hussein Fatal. Fatal left the group because the other Outlawz signed to Death Row after Tupac said not to (Amaru Records was an option); Napoleon would soon follow. The album contains all previously unreleased material and contains popular 2Pac tracks. It was released on December 21, 1999, by Interscope Records, under the Death Row label. It was certified two times platinum by the RIAA,[1] selling 2.5 million copies
