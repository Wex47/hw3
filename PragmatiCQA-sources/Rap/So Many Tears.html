   "So Many Tears" is the second single from, and the fourth track on, Tupac Shakur's third studio album Me Against the World. It is known as one of Shakur's most sad and soulful songs, as he was rapping about pain and suffering. A music video was made for the single, however Tupac was not featured in it, as he was serving time in prison on 3 counts of sexual abuse. The song's harmony is a sample from Stevie Wonder's "That Girl". The song peaked at #6 on the U.S. Rap chart, #21 on the U.S. Hip Hop/R&amp;B chart and #44 on the Billboard Hot 100.
