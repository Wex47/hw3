    Resourceful Rat
   </b>
   is an antagonist and occasional ally encountered throughout the Gungeon. He is a bipedal rat characterised primarily around his kleptomania and tendency to annoy and bring misfortune to
   Gungeoneers
   , though it is implied that he shares the same distaste towards the Gungeon.

   In his most frequent encounter, the Resourceful Rat is an

   who will steal armor, ammo, items, and guns left on the floor if the player leaves the room without picking them up. Health, blanks, keys, Hegemony credits, and Glass Guon Stones will never be stolen by the Rat. After stealing an item, he will leave a note on the ground thanking the player for the loot before calling them a random insult.
  </p>
  <p key="d6cee382-1dbd-4c9e-a139-e6808af2ebf5">
   If the player leaves a room containing an item the Resourceful Rat can steal and then quickly returns before the item is stolen, the Resourceful Rat will appear, but the item will not be stolen if the player is in the room, and he will disappear. This allows the player to visit any rooms directly connected without risk of items being stolen. Rooms connected by hallways are also considered to be directly connected and can be safely visited without any risk of the item being stolen. This mechanic can be especially useful with ammo, as it allows players that do not immediately need ammo to clear out the surrounding rooms before picking up the ammo, letting them refill a gun with less rounds in it. If the player shoots at the Resourceful Rat while he is stealing an item, he will call the player a "Jerk!" and disappear, only to come back later and steal it again. This feature does not have any function and does not change whether the player can go to adjoining rooms without items being stolen.

   If the player takes a
   shortcut
   to the second chamber onwards, the Resourceful Rat will appear in the elevator room wearing a mask resembling
   Bello
   and offer the player a varying selection of three free guns. These guns will not change unless the player completes a floor after taking an elevator.

    Fires a group of bullets in a cross hair formation that follows the player. After a while, it stops moving, and a large bullet drops onto the crosshair and bursts into a large ring of bullets that travels outwards. This can't happen if the mech's cannon is destroyed.

  <p key="236a9437-7c9d-47e3-ba9e-1c566dfa61b4">
   In this phase, the Resourceful Rat has three health bars of increasing difficulty that must be depleted in order to defeat him. Bold attacks can be interrupted when the rat flashes yellow in order to charge the player's super attack. If the Rat at any point lands an attack on the player, the player's super attack charge is reset.
  </p>
  <p key="43c98cc7-2847-4c27-b677-c3ec7797bd88">
   In this phase, if the player runs out of health or the timer runs out, the player will lose. The player will not die; the Rat will simply run away and leave a note. Any pickups the Resourceful Rat has dropped can be collected, including Rat keys.
  </p>
  <p key="b7ed9122-f86a-45aa-8044-16b7600a9f76">
   It is advised not to continuously punch the rat while he is blocking, as this will tire the player over time, leaving them temporarily unable to dodge.
  </p>
  <p key="8e35759f-a6aa-4ef5-acbb-b19642f20695">
   It is strongly advised to alternate left and right punches whenever possible, as this maximizes how many times the player can hit the Rat before he starts blocking again. Without alternating, the player can only get 3 hits in; with alternating, this increases to 6 (or 10 if performed after he gets dizzy from his 4-hit tailspin attack in the third phase.)

    It is highly recommended to fight the Resourceful Rat during

    During phase 2 and 3, there is a glitch that can trigger if the player dies to the rat's counter punch for trying to punch him too soon while he prepared to eat cheese.  This causes the player's life to restore to full and the game to go into slow motion rendering the rest of the fight significantly easier.

    “Pity me, for my story is a tragedy. I was born in the hold of a tradesman's ship, where my mischief made our nest among the refuse. When the tradesman changed routes, the food they previously hauled was replaced with weaponry. I watched my brothers and sisters starve, though I vowed to protect them. So I learned to steal, from the captain's personal stores. It was sadly... not enough. My efforts to feed them only prolonged their suffering. I couldn't steal enough; it became an obsession. I knew that the end was coming. Eventually, driven mad with hunger, my mischief turned on each other. The weakest went first, but soon, the last of my kin were gone, eaten by their brethren. When the trader finally docked, I escaped his ship... and found myself here, trapped in time. I have clawed a home here from nothing. My own kingdom. But here I lie, cut down by a usurper with the pettiest of intent. Revenge? You do not know pain.. I have one last thing to ask... Take off your mask, so that I may see your face with my own eyes. ... Oh. That's... actually your face. Ha! I realize now... It seems... I never knew... True tragedy.”

    When in co-op, a player will not be revived if dead after the rat's third phase. If the ghost of this player flies over the pit, both players will teleport to the loot room. All of the rat chests look like revive chests, but dispense the same items as a rat chest and do not revive the ghost player. These chests do not require Rat Keys, therefore making them free to unlock.

    Upon defeating The Resourceful Rat's first phase, his Ammonomicon entry seems to be in his own wording. Upon defeating The Resourceful Rat's second phase, his Ammonomicon entry is updated to how it rightfully should be. The first entry reads as follows:

    The "your very slow reflexes" death message references the "your own slow reflexes" death message, which is used as a failsafe if the player is killed by something after it dies (such as a Lead Maiden's bullets) or dies to certain entities (such as the Chancellor).

   <li key="c6ad66f3-338a-4b31-8c65-8bbdac6dce37">
    The comment the rat makes about it being statistically insignificant that you would find him starting at missing 3 notes could reference the scientific standard for something being statistically significant of 95%. While at missing only 2 notes you only have a 93.75% chance of missing the rat, meaning it is still considered reasonably possible to reach him, the chance of missing him missing 3 notes is 98.4375%.

   <li key="ad7a41fc-4f01-4bf1-a732-2ff17c89f901">
    If the player is on Nintendo Switch, the pattern to get to the Rat appears to remain constant. With the pattern being: Down, Right, Down, Up, Down, Up.

   <li key="a0967fe5-3907-4ca8-b230-807095084e7d">
    The Phrase "Say Cheese And Die!" on the Ammonomicon entry is most likely a reference to the GooseBumps horror novel of the same name.
