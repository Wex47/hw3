   The Sirian Great Council are the last of the Sirians after Mental discovered their home and wiped the rest of the species out. The Council has only three members:
   Jebediah
   ,
   Rajiv
   , and
   Rolanda
   . Rolanda appears to be the leader of the three, and has a more sensible and patient approach to the objective than her two brothers, Rajiv is very skeptical, and seems to underestimate Sam's abilities, as he doubts that one man can actually take down Mental, and Jebediah is the least intelligent out of the three and has a rather clumsy personality, though like Rolando, he too has high hopes for Sam.

Jefediah defends Sam though, telling Rajiv that he is no ordinary human, but Rajiv replies with a cocky remark, still believing that Sam doesn't stand a chance against Mental. With Sam stuck in Siriusopolis, he is lured into a trap by some Orc soldiers and sent into a death arena.
