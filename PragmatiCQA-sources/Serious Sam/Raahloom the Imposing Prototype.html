   As Raahloom was created from massive creatures, he has inherited the resilence of these corpses, granting him incredible endurance and making him extremely tough. He has five times as much as health as

   does. Because of this, most weapons in the player's arsenal will barely leave a scratch on him, although high explosives like

   are his greatest weakness, dealing 10 times as much damage to him as they would on any other enemy.

   Raahloom is equipped with two weapons; on his right arm is a huge

   , one of the original ones, which is rarely used by Mental's forces. It is extremely powerful; a single cannonball can tear a human into pieces. On his left arm, he carries an enormous warhammer, which he can use to pulverize any unlucky creature - friend or foe - that gets too close.
  </p>
  <p key="a472ba9c-6851-4d89-ae41-5cb437b26797">
   When a target is some distance from Raahloom, he will fire a volley of between three and six cannonballs at them with his cannon. These piercing cannonballs, while they are moving at high speeds, will instantly kill and gib a player regardless of their health as they have a piercing power of 5,000, even on

    Tourist difficulty

   . This makes Raahloom the only official enemy in the game that can gib the player. His cannonballs deal quadruple the splash damage compared to the player's own cannonballs as well, meaning that even if one of Raahloom's cannonballs doesn't directly hit the player, it can still instantly kill the player if they are in its blast radius, especially on

   . These piercing cannonballs also always travel in a linear trajectory unlike standard cannonballs, meaning they will only change direction if they collide with or perpendicular to a hard surface, in a manner not dissimilar to the lava balls of Highlander Reptiloids and

   . Furthermore, to distinguish these cannonballs from the player's, Raahloom's cannonballs emit a visible trail of black smoke.

   If the target he's focusing on is near him, he'll raise his warhammer. While his warhammer is in the air, he will begin charging it up. As soon as it finishes charging, it will flash and a "swish" sound will be heard. A few seconds later, he will smash the ground with his hammer, releasing a very powerful shockwave that can do massive amounts of damage even if someone is at the edge of the shockwave's reach. Anyone close to the site of impact will take a huge amount of damage or even be killed in one hit. Any small targets, including players, who get hit will receive extreme knockback, regardless of whether or not they survive. However, while Raahloom raises and charges his warhammer, he is vulnerable.

    The key to defeating this boss is to toss a large amount of C-4 charges near him, then blow them up. Five or more C-4 charges blown up near him at once can do a good amount of damage to him. There are several C-4 ammo crates scattered throughout the arena, so getting more ammo is easy.

    In order to make a large pile of C-4 charges, the player needs to get close to him. However, this is dangerous, as it triggers his melee attack. To get around this, the player should run up and get close to him (but not next to him) and start tossing C-4 charges until they hear a “swish” sound. That means his hammer is done charging up and he's ready to strike with it. At this point, get away from him quickly. By the time he strikes, the player will be far enough from him to take no damage.

    Raahloom's cannonballs can be dodged by simply strafing in a certain direction. This works best if the player is some distance away from him. If the player strafes his cannonballs while he is firing them and the player is too close to him, more specifically if they are directly in front of his cannon, there is a high chance that one of the cannonballs will hit, kill, and gib the player.

    The player should get just out of range so that he starts to target them with cannonballs. The player should run towards him while strafing to the side, and he won't be able to hit the player with any of them. While he's doing this, Raahloom won't be able to initiate his warhammer attack, giving the player ample time to run in close. Once the player is close enough to him while wielding C-4, they will see a large C-4 target appear on his belly. Throw a stick of C-4 at the target. His cannonball volley will end, and he will start his hammer attack. Run away and detonate the C-4 charge before Raahloom strikes the ground with his hammer, and he will take at least 5,300 damage, which erases a good portion of his health. Continue doing this up to 10 times and the player should be able to defeat him with little trouble.
