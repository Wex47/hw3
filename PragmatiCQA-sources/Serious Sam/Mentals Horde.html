   Mental's Horde is an extremely large army that consists of an unknown number of various species, most likely in the many thousands, which is possibly why Mental always manages to defeat any species he encounters. He also recruits primitive races in order to bolster his ranks; he has created agreements with creatures such as the

   Mental is the last of the Hum-Tah, a race of extremely powerful rulers of large, intergalactic empires. His predecessors had peacefully and wisely ruled the empires, but Mental was different. For some reason, he became dedicated to wiping out all intelligent life. He destroyed the empires, then disappeared for thousands of years. In between these cycles of war, he would lie dormant and deactivate his forces, leaving some behind to detect any sign of intelligent life. When he detected them, he would awaken and activate his forces.

   During the 22nd century, Mental was woken up by Sam Stone on the ship Surveyor after discovering a strange asteroid belt. Mental retailated and sent in massive hordes of forces at the humans, starting with the extraterrestrial colonies in Alpha Centauri. When the colonies fell, Mental tracked the retreating humans back to

By the time this portal was established, several smaller portals were set up in towns and cities to allow Mental's forces to quickly overrun them.

   , each carrying tens of thousands of troops, down onto Earth. By the time they arrived, the humans were at a massive disadvantage due to the sheer size of Mental's armies. This lead to a large conquest that had driven humanity almost to the point of extinction. During the conflict, humanity took massive casualties, though the exact number of this is unknown. It's possible that, due to military forces having lost or struggled to fight off against the invaders, the deaths were in the many millions. During the final stages of the war, it's clear that humanity had lost. Most or all of the inhabitants of towns and cities had been wiped out by Mental, and it seems that all that was left was a small group of Earth Defense Force soldiers posted somewhat near Cairo.
