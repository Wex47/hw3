   , the last of an extraterrestrial species known as the Hum-Tah, sends out his hostile alien forces to annihilate mankind. His forces fought against the humans from Alpha Centauri all the way back to Earth, where the planet stood as humanity's last stronghold against the invaders. The humans fought hard, but were no match for the sheer size of Mental's armies. In order to finish humanity off once and for all, Mental begins to invade Earth, which leads to a three-year conquest that has driven humanity almost to the point of extinction. As people began to struggle to fend off the alien invaders, world leaders turn to the Time-Lock as a last resort, hoping to send in a small force of soldiers to assassinate Mental when he laid dormant, thus saving humanity from extinction. In order to so, however, they had to find a way to activate the Time-Lock.

Rodriguez seems unhappy about the plan, seeing how Mental is slowly wiping out all life on Earth while he and his team have been ordered to protect a museum. Sam says that the guy they're looking for has important information about powering up the Time-Lock. The helicopter approaches the ruins of Cairo, but soon after they get into the city, a volley of rockets attempt to hit the helicopter. As the helicopter dodges the missiles, Sam is left hanging over the side as he wasn't wearing his seatbelt. After many desperate attempts to evade the rockets, one of them hits the tail of the Black Hawk and Sam is sent flinging out of it and far from his squad.

With his main objective completed, Sam travels back through the basement to the surface. Right before he tries to leave, an

He gets near an overpass, and decides to transform it into a shortcut by tossing C-4 charges on its support pillars.

After calling HQ to check if they've solved the riddle one more time, which they haven't, he unhesitatingly detonates the C-4, causing the sandstone statue to crumble and reveal a secret passage in the ground, much to the chagrin of Quinn and the rest of HQ.

   However, Mental, who has been finishing up the Sirians, is alerted to Sam's presence and sends some of his forces to Earth in order to stop him. After collecting them, he enters Memphis and collects the Sign of Amon-Ra, which is vital to summoning the SSS Centerprice. He then travels to Karnak and enters it via placing the elements he had collected earlier in various slots. Sam fights through Karnak, and ends up in

Since there's nothing else he can do at this point, Sam decides to try boarding it while hoping that the Sirians made humans an authorized species. He then takes an elevator to the top of the exposed pyramid, ready to try his luck with the SSS Centerprice. However, Ugh-Zan III scales the pyramid and attempts to stop Sam right before he's ready to board the ship. Sam manages to manipulate the ship's anti-intruder function by weakening Ugh-Zan III with his weapons, then luring him to the center of the boarding area, which is where one enters the SSS Centerprice. Ugh-Zan III's species is not authorized to use the ship, so the ship instead fires a very powerful laser at him, which manages to overwhelm and kill him before he can activate his regenerative abilities.

   Right after Ugh-Zan III is killed, Sam runs into the middle of the boarding area, hoping that the ship has humans as an authorized species. It does, and Sam is warped into the ship. As the ship departs to Sirius' trade routes, Sam calls up Mental and lets him know that he has an “important package” he needs to deliver to him, and that it'll be coming soon.

   . The central gameplay feature of the game is shooting a large number of enemies while advancing through large open levels. The player’s arsenal is varied and not constrained by any restrictions; on average, in each game of the series, the main character is able to carry up to 10 different weapons, from the usual light, cold arms (knife, chainsaw, etc.) to heavy firearms of destructive power (rocket launcher, minigun, cannon, etc.). The number of enemies on the player's screen can reach up to several hundred at a time, and the total number of opponents at a level can reach several thousand. For killing monsters, the player gets points, which are then added to the total score. The series is distinguished by a wide variety of types of enemies, including land, underwater, flying, living, and mechanical enemies. At the end of some levels are bosses, which are notoriously more difficult to defeat than standard enemies.

In addition, in some games of the series there are power ups - special bonuses that temporarily give the player some special features: for example,

These mob waves consist of ridiculously high numbers of enemies of all kinds, where the player is given the task to gun these down. The gun combat is the game's JRPG part, where the player may switch weapons and shoot the weapon selected, choosing a direction, radius, or position to shoot at, as well as using one of the previously gathered items.

   . A series of these engines has a high degree of manufacturability and has a wide range of capabilities. The main and most well-known feature of this engine series is the ability to render large open spaces and a huge number of different static and moving objects on the screen, such as enemies, without any loss of performance. This provides the

   games with an advantage among competitors, as it allows to make the gameplay more fierce and large-scale. The first version of the Serious Engine was available for licensing and was used, in addition to Serious Sam, in several third-party games.

   The last iteration - Serious Engine 3.5 - is a true multi-platform engine that supports PC, PlayStation 4, as well as iOS and Android mobile operating systems. The soundtrack of the Serious Sam series is diverse and usually consists of ethnic motifs made in the style and genre of the locale in which the game takes place, as well as from ambient, techno and heavy metal. For all games in the series, the so-called dynamic music system developed by Croteam is standard. This means that the music at the levels changes depending on what is happening on the screen: in calm and peaceful moments, pleasant, relaxing music plays; during the appearance of any opponents, rhythmic, combat music begins to play, which does not stop until the player destroys all enemies nearby from him; when bosses appear, energetic and driving heavy metal begins to play. The soundtrack was written by the Croatian composer for all the main games of the series developed by Croteam, Damian Mravunac, sometimes in collaboration with other guest musicians.

   Another feature of the series is a large number of secrets and Easter eggs, deliberately hidden by developers and inherent in many classic first-person shooters. Finding and finding secrets requires careful research and study of game levels. As a result, during such searches you can find both useful things - new weapons, ammunition or armor, as well as completely unusual objects and Easter eggs - for example, the scene of shooting events from the previous game or a scroll with a message from the developers. However, developers often like to make fun of a player and punish him by arranging false secrets-traps. The most common example of such a principle is lonely pills or armor lying in the distance, picking up which, several dangerous enemies suddenly teleport right to where the player is.

   series is characterized by corporate humor and not too serious attitude as to what is happening. The protagonist - Sam Stone - during the game constantly pours out funny, caustic phrases (one-liners), making fun of enemies, ridiculing the world around him and "breaking through the fourth wall". In addition to the fun of the game, not only Sam, but also other characters take part, and the plot is deliberately replete with irony and satire: electronic assistant NETRICSA composes Sam with an adrenaline hockey, monsters play poker in a secret room, Sam's spaceship is knocked down by big-headed developers on a junk box, etc..

   PC versions released on the Serious Engine family of engines come with a free level editor and additional tools that allow any player to create their own amateur cards and modifications. This played a significant role in the formation of the Serious Sam fan base: a fairly cohesive and numerous community of mappers formed in the network, creating a large number of cards, mappaks, mods, and models for different games of the series.
