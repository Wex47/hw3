   , the Grail is not an ancient alien artifact that looks nothing like a grail, but instead resembling a golden scepter with the figure of a snake curled around it, which is likely to be
   Aaron's rod
   . At the time, it was believed that the Grail had the power to heal all wounds, though it's revealed to have a far more sinister purpose. If someone was to hold the rod, the snake wrapped around the staff would come to life and bite the wielder. If the snake was destroyed before it could bite the wielder, the artifact would become extremely unstable. After a while, the artifact would blow up in a powerful explosion.
  </p>
  <p key="f9381193-4662-4d57-ac68-3292c8ee4910">
   When someone was bitten by the snake, a bolt of blue lightning would appear and the user would transform into a humanoid abomination. This process appeared to be very painful, as shown when Brand allowed himself to be bitten by the snake. The transformation only took a few seconds, and after being bitten, the wielder would grow to immense proportions, as well as gain immense muscular mass and strength. Their voice would also turn deeper and more monstrous-like. It is not known if this transformation was temporary or permanent.

   Aside from being able to transform its host, the rod also had other properties; anyone who had touched the rod was able to pick it up from a distance by reaching their arm out to it, as demonstrated by both Brand and Sam. The wielder did not have to be transformed to be able to pick the rod up. The rod could also be used as a weapon, being able to impale the target like a spear and create a shockwave that was able to incapacitate, but not kill, anyone in a small radius around the user. Brand did this to knock Sam and his friends unconscious when they tried to stop him.

He explains in further detail that men had died trying to shield it, so it was best that the Grail remained hidden. When the time arrive in Carcassonne, they get to the church. There, Mikhail performs a ritual that activates a mechanism, revealing the Ark of the Covenant. Sam opens the Ark and is baffled to find that the Grail is just a stick. Sam tries to grab the stick, despite being warned not to. Suddenly, Brand appears with several of his soldiers. Sam realizes that he has been betrayed by his own superior officer. Brand orders his team to stand down, and deems that humanity should have joined up with Mental when they had the chance instead of fighting him.

Sam swims to a nearby platform and Brand follows him, the two engaging in battle. Utilizing the pyrokinesis bestowed upon him by the sceptre Brand gives Sam a tough fight, but still finds himself on the losing end. In a last-ditch effort to overpower Sam Brand fully fuses with the artifact and absorbs its energy, which engulfs his entire body in flames and dramatically increases his power, now even able to conjure massive flaming cobras that shoot lasers out of their mouths. Sam still defeats him and ultimately shoots him in the face with a double-barreled shotgun, killing him.
