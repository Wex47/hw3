  <p key="7f418227-27d4-4a60-8d23-cc9204efb304">
   Before the duel, Hamilton lingers on the definition of a "legacy" - and if he was to make one or break one. He then approaches the dueling site to face his opponent, Burr.
  </p>
  <p key="d31ee71b-8831-4a1e-9949-dd1952fbc4f2">
   According to the

   , "throwing away your shot", or to aim your shot into the sky, effectively eliminating it, gave you an element of neutrality and ensured that you did not mean to hurt your opponent. Hamilton did not intend to hurt Burr - according to his word - but instead of clearly firing his shot into the sky, he fired it close enough to Burr to let his opponent think he had simply aimed incorrectly; however, it is known that Burr did not know Hamilton intended to throw away his shot.
  </p>
  <p key="2cc47f80-3d97-4c18-902a-e7ae98fdc81f">
   Burr shot Hamilton in the side of his ribcage, causing internal bleeding, and hours later Hamilton passes away. Burr later learns that Hamilton did not mean to hurt him, and explains that his shot was so close to the target that it could not be judged whether Hamilton indeed had kept to his word and threw away his shot or if he had simply missed his target.
  </p>
  <p key="69c0b605-6e58-49ff-80da-f1eb829fcf3c">
   After the duel, Burr laments that even though he won the duel, after all of Hamilton's accomplishments, he was condemned to being forever known as only the man who killed Alexander Hamilton.

     I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
     Is this where it gets me, on my

     There is no beat, no melody

     May be the last face I ever see?

     How you remember me?

     Legacy. What is a legacy?
     It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see

     Beginning of a song someone will sing for me
     America, you great unfinished symphony,
     You sent for me.
     You let me make a difference.

     Their fingerprints and rise up
     I'm running out of time, I'm running and
     My time's up.
     Wise up. Eyes up.
     I catch a glimpse of the other side
     Laurens leads a soldiers' chorus on the other side
     My son is on the other side
     He's with my mother on the other side
     Washington is watching from the other side.

     I strike him right between his ribs
     I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
     They row him back across the Hudson
     I get a drink

     Were both at his side when he died.
     Death doesn't discriminate
     Between the sinners and the saints,
     It takes and it takes and it takes
     History obliterates
     In every picture it paints
     It paints me and all my mistakes
     When Alexander aimed at the sky,
     He may have been the first one to die,
     But I'm the one who paid for it
     I survived, but I paid for it.
     Now I'm the villain in your history
     I was too young and blind to see
     I should've known
     I should've known
     The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
     The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me.
