   Upon discovery of the affair by Maria's husband,

   , Hamilton paid him over $1,300 (about a third of his annual income) of blackmail money to maintain secrecy. Hamilton was forced to admit to the affair after James Reynolds threatened to implicate him in Reynolds' own scheme involving unpaid back wages intended for Revolutionary War veterans.
  </p>
  <p key="5dd76e88-9575-4978-a5b3-8346c9468735">
   In November 1792, James Reynolds was jailed for participation in a scheme involving unpaid back wages intended for Revolutionary War veterans.
  </p>
  <p key="78f3e930-3391-4fd3-8c17-d9917dd6793b">
   He used his knowledge about Hamilton's sex affair to bargain his way out of his own troubles. Reynolds knew Hamilton would have to choose between revealing his affair with Maria or falsely admitting complicity to the charges. James Monroe, Abraham Venable and Frederick Muhlenberg were the first men to hear of this possible corruption within the nation's new government and on 15 December 1792 decided to personally confront Hamilton with the information they had received, supported by the notes of Hamilton's payments to Reynolds that Maria had given them to corroborate her husband's accusations. Denying any financial impropriety, Hamilton revealed the true nature of his relationship with Maria Reynolds and her husband in all its unsavory details. He even turned over the letters from both Maria and James Reynolds.
  </p>
  <p key="1d7ecc8b-6f56-432a-8d1b-11a29cb499df">
   Apparently convinced that Hamilton was not guilty of the charge of public misconduct, Monroe, Venable and Muhlenberg agreed not to make public the information and documents on the Reynolds Affair. Monroe and his colleagues assured Hamilton that the matter was settled.
  </p>
  <p key="118b72db-19f4-4de4-88d8-f9331603c866">
   However, Monroe did send the letters to his close personal friend,

   . Jefferson and Hamilton were self-described nemeses, and five years after receiving the letters, Jefferson used the knowledge to start rumors about Hamilton's private life.
  </p>
  <p key="5c9344d9-a3d2-4a80-9305-49d8c70b62b9">
   In that same year, 1797, when Hamilton no longer held the post of
   Secretary of the Treasury
   , the details of his relationship with Maria and James Reynolds came to light in a series of pamphlets authored by journalist James Thomson Callender. Included were copies of the documents Hamilton had furnished to the Monroe commission in December 1792. Hamilton confronted Monroe over the leakage of the supposedly confidential documents. Monroe denied any responsibility. Hamilton came very close to calling Monroe a liar, and Monroe retorted that Hamilton was a scoundrel and challenged him to a duel. The duel was averted by the intercession of none other than

  </p>
  <p key="79c2948a-067f-44fa-b24e-b301f3fd422e">
   On 25 August 1797 Hamilton responded to Callender's revelations by printing his own 95-page pamphlet called

   , later known as the "Reynolds Pamphlet", in which he denied all charges of corruption. He did not, however, deny his relationship with Maria Reynolds; instead, he openly admitted it and apologized for it. While his candor was admired, the affair severely damaged his reputation. While Hamilton's admitted affair served to confirm rival Thomas Jefferson's conviction that he was untrustworthy, it did nothing to change
