     When the world turned its back on me
     I was up against the wall

     I picked up the pen like Hamilton
     Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel them
     No political power, just lyrical power
     Sitting on a crate in the corner, sipping for hours
     Scheming on a come up, from evening to sun up
     My man awaiting trial, misdemeanors we younger
     Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
     Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
     Flickering lights inside my project hall
     Sickening, the mice crawl all night long
     And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
     Writing songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
     Master bedroom, bigger than the crib I was raised at
     I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
     I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens
     The definition of what is was written means
     Know what I mean

     I really wrote my way up out of six in
     Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
     Before the metro cards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
     Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was a sixteen?
     At sixteen, arrested in housing, trip to the mountains
     Came right back, trapping off couches, watching for mouses
     Only tools we was posed with, had to spot smoke lit
     The haters just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
     Theodora was my favorite of my [wrote it]
     Mama couldn't afford them, I learnt everything on the border
     That's a big 8, trick coke parties with private dancers with no mixtape
     Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
     I persevered, composition, I kept it close
     Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
     Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
     Opportunity knocking, might miss it, that window closing
     This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

     High speed, dubbing these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
     Running out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's Rent check
     My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
     In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
     Y'all, I got my first beating from the other kids when I was caught reading
     Oh, you think you're smart? Blah, start bleeding
     My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
     Sister tapped my brains, said "pshh, you'll get 'em right back"
     Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
     The lengths to which I'd go to lean my strengths and knock 'em senseless
     These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
     Damn, you got no chill, fucking right I'm relentless
     I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
     So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
     This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
     And if he can be the shining beacon this side of the G.W.B.
     And shine a light when it's gray out
