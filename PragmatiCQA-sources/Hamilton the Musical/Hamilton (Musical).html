   (off-Broadway 2005-2007). While reading it on vacation in Mexico, Miranda began developing early ideas of a musical revolving Hamilton and his life. He began writing these ideas down, frequently shouting out ideas to his wife, Vanessa Nadal, as they came to mind. After researching, he found that a play by the life of Alexander Hamilton did exist, though it dated back to 1917. The first idea of Hamilton was brought up while Lin was at the bar with Jeremy McCarter. McCarter says "...Lin-Manuel Miranda told me he wanted to write a hip-hop concept album about the life of Alexander Hamilton. For a second I thought we sharing a drunken joke. We were probably drunk, but he wasn't joking."
