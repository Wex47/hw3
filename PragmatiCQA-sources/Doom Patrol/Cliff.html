   After the race was over, Cliff assaulted Bump with his trophy and once again had sex with Giselle. However, Cliff felt guilty for his treatment of his family and wanted to reconnect with them. He called Kate, leaving a voicemail in which he promised to be better for them, which spurred Kate to answer his call. Kate decided to give him another chance and allowed Cliff to pick up both her and her daughter that same night. While driving, Cliff was distracted by his family and not focused on driving. He heard his wife scream his name right before he noticed a semi truck that had jack knifed in the road. Once again, the accident was purposely

Shortly after, they took a seat on a bench, and Cliff admired Jane's smoking, wishing he could have one himself. Hammerhead soon surfaced after Cliff moped about his daughter, claiming that she was still alive, prompting some police officers to approach. She began to get aggressive, but they were interrupted by Rita, who had become a blob that was moving across town. Cliff hurried over, pulling up a piece of road, and stopping her in her tracks. Once the Chief returned, seeing the damage, he scolded the group.

     Loss of senses:
    </b>
    Without an organic body, Cliff lost three of the human body's five senses: taste, smell, and touch.

     Trauma:

    Cliff's experiences have left him very emotionally fragile and he still struggles greatly with the emotional toll of his accident, as well as losing his body and being unable to experience most of the typical human senses.

     Malnutrition:
    </b>
    While being only a brain in a robot body makes Cliff effectively immortal, his brain still requires nutrition to stay alive. His body is fitted with a nutrient tank to keep him alive. Any disruption of that tank can cause him to go hallucinate, or worse, like having a stroke.
