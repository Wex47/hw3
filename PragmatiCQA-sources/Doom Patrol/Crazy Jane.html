When Cliff came by and offered a plate of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, specifically for Baby Doll, Jane threw it on the floor and shut the door on him. She watched a video of Baby Doll speaking to Niles and got rather emotional. However, Niles mentioned the Doom Patrol, which peaked her interests. She approached Vic and told him that Mr. Nobody asked her to find them. Jane, along with Cliff and Vic, looked into the Doom Patrol and learned that they were a superhero group that randomly fell off the radar.

   Joshua welcomed Jane and Larry into their headquarters and enlightened Jane on the Doom Patrol building now being a school. He even showed her a bedroom Niles had prepared for her. When Jane informed him that Niles was missing, he took her aside for a private talk. Jane was told a story of a time where the Doom Patrol faced Mr. Nobody and what seemed like a victorious win. However, the atmosphere of the school suddenly changed, appearing to be bleak and abandoned. That is when she was told the school was not really a school after all. While she waited alone in his office, Jane was pursued by a tidal wave of puzzle pieces and a haunting voice that constantly said: "sweet, sweet, baby". Somehow, the illusion ceased and Joshua explained to Jane, Larry, and Rita that, in reality, the Doom Patrol lost when fighting Mr. Nobody and that they having been suffering ever since. Therefore, Mento uses his power to keep the false illusions going. This saddened Jane, leading her to wonder why Niles would want to send her there. Joshua, however, was unable to give her a reassuring answer. She was told that Mr. Nobody sent her there because he wanted to send her a message on what happens when he is crossed.

   As per usual, Hammerhead was in control. When Jane realized that Hammerhead was going elsewhere but Vic's meeting, Jane resurfaced and encouraged themselves to attend. After having an unpleasant interaction with Cliff, Hammerhead took over and went to the room consisting of Nile's documented videos of Jane. When Jane returned, she reminisced over footage of her and Niles but Hammerhead reemerged to destroy the video cassettes, remembering that Niles wanted to treat her like the Doom Patrol. Hammerhead and Jane relentlessly fought over control of their body. To Jane's dismay, all of her documented information was destroyed. Jane returned to her bedroom and cried until she felt a massive tremor. She walked into the living room where she saw Cliff going on a rampage and referring to her as his daughter, Clara. Vic knocked sense into him and suggested that they have a therapy session. Instead of sharing anything personal, Flit assisted Jane and retrieved a painting of Vic. Jane showed it to the group, which stunned everyone. Her antics angered Cliff and he insulted her and her alters. This upset her and she stormed out of the manor.

   While in the Underground, Jane witnessed Karen being dragged back by Hammerhead. When Jane was noticed, she was stopped by the other alters. Although Jane refused to go back to the surface, they all encouraged her to go because not only was it her duty as a host but it left them all vulnerable. Hesitantly, Jane boarded the train that transported her back to "the surface" of Jane's body. While on the train, she spoke to

Jane harshly refused Penny's help and walked away. Elsewhere, she stumbled across memories of her being taken back to the sanatorium after sneaking out and having interviews with Niles. Much to her surprise, she encountered Cliff in the flesh accompanied by Penny. Cliff begged Jane to come back until Jane admitted that she could not handle being on the surface anymore. She shunned them a final time and proceeded onward. She encountered a final alter,

After that, Cliff and Jane peacefully returned to the train, where Jane was obviously thankful for his efforts. When she returned to the surface, she found herself in a bridal dress and was welcomed back by Vic and Rita, who dealt with an ordeal themselves while she was unconscious.

    Jane has DID, and while most of the show does not represent how to properly address someone who has a system, it does correctly have Jane state that she respects her system and that she has no control over them. In many DID systems, there is a primary alter that stays present, but may switch out with "protectors" when need be (i.e. Hammerhead, Baby Doll, etc.). A system can also have dozens, up to hundreds of alters. For more information on DID it is suggested to look at recent medical journals.
