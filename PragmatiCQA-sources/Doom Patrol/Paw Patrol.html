   At a punk club, skinheads and clubbers are dancing on the floor. Jane is among them, and gets knocked to the floor. Two skinheads call her a spic, and she beats them as payback. A fight breaks out and Jane takes on a half-dozen men. Once they're down, she screams in triumph and the club joins her. Unfortunately policeman comes from behind, knocks her out and they take her to a mental hospital. They toss her cursing into a room and one of the orderlies, Frank, tells her that no matter how many times she tries to get away, she's going to end up back there. He kicks her and starts to go, but Jane tauntingly says that he's scum just like her. Chaz goes back and continues beating her.

Objects and people cease to exists, and Ezekiel boasts of the flourishing of other creatures that will surely take place in humanity's absence and talks to a rat about making cheese.

   Morden is watching the entire thing through a telescope and refuses to accept that it's the end. Niles is twirling around him and says that they can stop it, and Morden stops him and asks what he knows about the Decreator. Niles says that he's amused that Morden has realized the limits of his omniscience, and explains that the Decreator is a creation of decades of unwavering belief. In order to defeat it, they need to dtart by building a new religion with someone charismatic and powerful enough to protect the believers. He figures that they need to find a specific version of Jane and then someone else working in the past and present. Morden agrees to team up with Niles and snaps his fingers.
