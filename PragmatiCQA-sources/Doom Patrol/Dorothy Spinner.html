   In London, England during the year 1927, amongst a travelling circus, Dorothy is being kept in a cage and refer to as the "Ape Faced Girl" who was captured in the Yukon and is now forced to perform as part of a freak show by conjuring creatures. However, things go a bit awry when she gets distracted by someone in the audience and lashes out. An ominous voice tells her that he can help if she makes a wish. A candle then appears in her hand, so she proceeds to make a wish, blows it out and chaos ensues. When it's over, everyone is dead except for her, her creature, and Niles Caulder.

   A couple of years later, Niles sends Dorothy to hide inside Danny, who was “a smart alley” at the time, and set out on his journey to gain immortality. All so that he would always be around to protect his daughter from others and from herself. His investigation eventually led him to Paraguay, where he stole a talisman in the form of a rabbit’s leg that provided him with immortality. Unfortunately, this was not a permanent solution, so he began to test out his unethical experiments of immortality on what is now the team.

   A much happier Dorothy wakes up and talks to her imaginary friends about how they're going to have a good day and instructs them to say hello to their new friends. Unfortunately for Dorothy, Niles, Cliff, Vic, Jane, and Rita, they are still tiny and are living on the racetrack that Cliff setup. All while a full-size Larry tends to their needs and tries to find a way to return them to their normal size. Despite multiple attempts to return them to their normal size, this latest venture into fixing their size also fails.

   Later, Dorothy and Jane bond a bit over both of them having "friends" inside their heads. Niles interrupts as he wants the serum she's been using so he can use it for Dorothy. Jane refuses and says she's used it all. Eventually, Dorothy tries to spend time with Cliff as well who has been "feeding" the rats they end up taking one of the cars around the little race track. But this proves to be too traumatic for Cliff, when it triggers flashbacks to his accident and causes him to freak out. Which inadvertently causes

   Cliff loses it and a heartbroken Dorothy runs off in the process. Niles eventually shows up to tell the gang that Dorothy is missing, and they realize she's gone to feed the rats, which is a problem since Cliff's been killing them. Cliff and Jane go find Dorothy who has discovered that one of the rats had babies, but when the mommy rat destroys a weak baby, Dorothy freaks out. The ominous voice tries to get Dorothy to make a wish, but Niles is able to shock Dorothy out of it.

   Danny remains broken in two after Dorothy accidentally broke them when she was home alone. Someone rings the doorbell and it's the Dannyzens along with Flex Mentallo, who says that in his estimation, Danny is in very bad shape, but Mora Lee Karrupt realizes that the way to help Danny is to throw a party to power them up with joy, love, laughter, and music. Flex is incredibly kind to Dorothy and uses his powers to have her hang the disco ball instead. Later, Dorothy tells Rita she lived in the doll factory under Danny and never got to participate in the parties. As a result, Rita gives her a little bit of a makeover to which Niles disapproves.

   When the party doesn't fix Danny, Mora Lee decides it's time to spice things up, with Dorothy's help. She begins to sing "Pure Imagination" from the Willy Wonka film, and that seems to work. Danny sends a message of thanks to Dorothy for the song and the party kicks off in full now that they're somewhat back. Unfortunately for Dorothy, time passes and it soon is bedtime for her, and she is forced to leave the party.  Now in her room, the sinister voice of the Candlemaker tries to convince Dorothy to go back to the party. Dorothy eventually listens and ends up sneaking a drink and while Danny chastises her, they agree to give her ten more minutes to enjoy the party. Meanwhile, Candlemaker tries his hardest to convince Dorothy that Danny isn't really her friend but her prison and so she asks Danny. Danny tells her the truth, which unintentionally gives Candlemaker a foothold with the forever young girl. Dorothy takes an ice pick while Candlemaker encourages her to kill Danny. She tells Danny she can't go back, and they admit they can't either.

   Niles talks with Danny, who refuses to hold Dorothy prisoner any longer. Eventually, Rita and Dorothy talk and Rita ends up repeating to Dorothy what her mother told her when she was younger, which was to focus on her other talents. Thus, Dorothy decides she doesn't want to grow up and goes to make a wish, but Candlemaker rejects her, too.
