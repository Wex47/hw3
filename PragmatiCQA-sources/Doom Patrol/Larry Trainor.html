The team split up to find Niles faster and Larry said it would be fine as he never had an imaginary friend and Cliff found that sad. While looking for Niles, Larry saw Kipling turned into wax and was shocked to see his eyes causing him to fall to the ground, this caused Candlemaker to turn Larry into wax.
    Shortly after Dorothy calmed Candlemaker, Larry and the others stopped being wax. Larry hugged Rita and together with Vic they found Niles dead and watched as Dorothy came riding to Candlemaker and Larry, Rita and Vic mourned the death of Niles.

   A week later, Larry made sandwiches for Rita when she goes to Cloverton. Larry befriended Dorothy to try to motivate her to overcome her father's death. Larry and Dorothy shared a hug. Larry argued with the Spirit, who wanted to go on a space trip to show him something like Valentina said, but Larry refused to go to space as he could not abandon Rita. Larry, Vic, Rita, Cliff, and Dorothy went to save Jane and they all shared a hug after Jane returned to normal. Larry then spoke to Rita, who finally convinced him to go into space. Larry and the Spirit withdrew from the manor and went into space.

Larry returned to his form after the accident and returned to Earth, but realized that the Spirit remained in his home. Larry was left alone in the manor while he looked at the sky, thinking about his friend.
