   . All of the alters except Jane voted to throw them into The Well. The alters traveled to The Well with the corpses of Baby Doll and Flaming Katy after giving them their funeral procession. However, when they got to The Well, some of the alters halted due presence of Daddy being in there. Hammerhead tells them, they'll all just beat him up and somewhat reassures the alters to finish what they came to do fast. However, before they could throw Baby Doll and Flaming Katy in The Well, Jane stopped them and tried to convince them to give the two time to recover and explained that they don't know how this happens or works and therefore, there was a chance they could survive. However, Daddy, as Miranda, suddenly rose out of The Well, which surprised all of the alters. "Miranda" claims she threw her body down The Well and over time she was reborn and so would Baby Doll and Flaming Katy. The alters obey and throw Baby Doll's and Flaming Katy's bodies down The Well. "Miranda" then asks Jane to step aside as Primary so she can show her what Kay truly wants. "Miranda" takes over Kay's body.

   . When she met Rita Farr, she revealed she is a big fan of Rita. Later they received a box that says "Do Not Open" on all sides. The scant scent reached their noses. It made Larry, Vic, and Roni decided to open it, but "Miranda" points out it say do not open on all sides and say they should wait for Niles. But they opened it anyway. Inside was the white space painting. It had shown that Mr. Nobody and Beard Hunter aren't there. A while later, Larry thought about visiting his grandson. "Miranda" noticed Larry and asked him if everything is alright. Larry said he wouldn't like worrying anyone about his problems but Miranda seemingly someone who he can talk about his situation with, which he does. She simply tell Larry to give them some time. Then Larry decided to visit his grandson but "Miranda" told him, that is the opposite of giving them space. Larry asked "Miranda" if he can talk to Flit. "Miranda" agrees to let Flit help him. After Larry and Flit failed to see Larry's grandson, Flit teleported themselves home and "Miranda" took over again. Vic tells her and Larry that he wants to do surgery on Roni to fix her. Before Vic and Larry could operate on Roni, "Miranda" interrupted, asking if doing surgery on Roni is a good idea. Then she points out that everyone which included Flit have been acting very strangely since morning.

   Still in Miranda's form, Daddy began slowly killing alters by throwing them into the Well. He started by killing

   as well, Jane began to question "Miranda," as everything was fine before she showed up. "Miranda" told her that Kay was healing, and that those alters were no longer needed. When Kay said she wanted Harry, her stuffed animal from childhood, Jane offered to go get it. Once she returned, she offered to let "Miranda" give Harry to Kay. "Miranda," however, pushed Jane down the Well.
   Surfacing once again, "Miranda" went with the team to the fair to stop the Candlemaker. However, "Miranda" was pulled back into the Underground by the other alters, who demanded to know why alters kept disappearing. During this time, Kay's body was trapped in wax by the Candlemaker. In the Underground, Kay approached Jane's now closed station when "Miranda" appeared behind her. Kay realized that "Miranda" was not really Miranda, and Daddy confirmed this, calling Kay "sweet baby."

   When Jane escaped the well and realized that Miranda was Daddy she and other personas worked together to end him. Apparently on the surface,Dorothy apologized to Jane about what she did, but unfortunately she was still unconscious. Within a few minutes Daddy appeared on the surface,called Dorothy a killer and threw her out the room. When Cliff saw Jane and ran towards her Daddy punched him out of the way. As Daddy made it to the basement he grabbed a barrel and some rope and tried to kill himself and the others. Luckily Jane ended him for good and ate his remains with the other personas.
