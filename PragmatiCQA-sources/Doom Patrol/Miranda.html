   Miranda came into existence as one of the 64 alters developed by Kay Challis upon being severely traumatized in childhood.

    Kay Challis
   </a>
   's adolescence, her mother,
   Elena Challis
   , had begun noticing her daughter's immensely erratic and often violent outbursts and behavior due to her dissociative identity disorder (DID) becoming more and more apparent. Frightened by this, her mother came to the conclusion that her daughter had become possessed by "

   </a>
   ", and due to her highly religious beliefs, had her daughter exorcised by their local preacher in an attempt to remove them. This was primarily done by having Kay constantly dipped down in a tub of holy water and calling upon God to remove the demons "evil presence" from Kay. Kay's many alters soon began surfacing in an attempt to defend themselves or make them stop, but only instead solidified their belief she was possessed and persisted. Eventually this traumatic experience and her current alters inability to make it stop resulted in the birth of a new alter who would become Kay's first Primary, Miranda. Who then proceeded to successfully convince Kay to let her out into the "surface" as she knew what she wanted and tricked the preacher and the church-goers she was now "Saved" and successfully fooled them into thinking that she was no longer "plagued" by the "Demons". After this Miranda then proceeded to subtly warn and threaten Elena to never to try something like that again, lest she reveal to everyone what really
   happened
   in their home and her compliance to do nothing about it.
  </p>
  <p key="3e88e88e-86f6-47b7-a506-55308e6b94a6">
   In middle school, she got into a lot of trouble with her teachers due to her identifying herself as Miranda and refusing to answer to the name "Kay" and her desiring to be referred to as "Miranda" instead.
  </p>
  <p key="17b08893-50a2-4a11-adcb-21cb2b864da6">
   One day, Miranda was pushed to the edge of the well by Kay's father, who called her a "whore" due to her making eye contact with a boy at church. Miranda, in an attempt to defend herself, says she didn't make eye contact with him, but Kay's father told her not to lie, calling her "Kay". Miranda then defiantly proceeded to say that wasn't her name and to call her Miranda, enraging him further and caused him to hit her and told her again to stop calling herself Miranda and proceeded to threateningly tell her to get in the bucket. Fearful and complying, Miranda obeyed, and he put her in the well like he did to Kay years ago.
  </p>
  <p key="a2a84a48-226f-43e0-a1bc-6f249a13a986">
   Miranda, understanding his habits of simply leaving her there until the sun rose in the morning, and no longer desiring to put up with his abuse, had already planned her escape and left behind her provision bag in the Well. Miranda then proceeded to remove a stone within the well and place Kay's stuffed toy and only friend "Harry," into the wall hole together with a final spiteful letter to Kay's father should ever he find it, if he ever looked for her. Miranda then proceeded to climb up the Well bucket's rope to freedom as she ran away from home.
  </p>
  <p key="6f23ac76-1526-448f-ba37-febc9410e301">
   In 1969, Miranda has seemingly formed a somewhat normal life, with her having gotten a good and stable job as a waitress in a local diner where she then met Johnny Bills, a local street performer. Johnny then began flirting with Miranda and soon asked her out on a date, with her accepting due to her wanting to "move on forward" and her believing that he would help them recover, the two would then became a couple. After moving in together, Johnny hosted a party at the house, where Miranda was coerced into having sex despite the objections of her fellow alters. Miranda told the other alters that this would be good for them, but Johnny instead forced Miranda to have sex with one of his friends. Miranda eventually realized that she was in the wrong and began panicking as she was reminded of Kay's trauma. Causing Miranda to then lose control and begin shifting control from the other alters due to being triggered, causing Pretty Polly, Penny Farthing, Scarlet Harlot and finally Hammerhead to surface, who then successfully fended the man off them as Miranda resurfaced.

  <p key="25d27af4-908a-45b4-a660-15ff4a7300ba">
   Panicking and miserable, Miranda then attempted to leave and stop the whole affair, but was too late, as the other alters pulled her back into the Underground, where she was yelled at by

   Miranda was traumatized by this incident and driven by guilt and self-disgust, she began doubting herself as Kay Challis' primary. She went looking for answers and eventually sought guidance from
   the Sisters
   , who encouraged her to seek out
   the Well
   . When she found it, she willingly fell into it, causing her
   demise

Miranda also showed enough foresight and planning to successfully outwit her father and plan ahead on how to survive on her own when she ran away from home.
