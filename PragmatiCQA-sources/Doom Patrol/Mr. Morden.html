   They saw Doctor Harrison demonstrate and speak with Nobody about his problems. Through that, they discovered that Nobody did it all because his ex abandoned him. Nobody got angry, exclaiming that he is superior and equal to no one. Vic then arrived and destroyed Nobody. The Doom Patrol along with Niles returned home, but it was all part of Mr. Nobody's plan. Presumably, a year passed from their defeat, and the Doom Patrol had become heroes and were facing the Brotherhood of Evil, though it was all false since Nobody used his robot to kill the Doom Patrol over and over again while Niles watched.

   The Doom Patrol would come to discover that the Vic that arrived at the White Space was Mr. Nobody and the Vic that arrived at the Manor was the real one. Mr. Nobody was excited because they discovered him and ended the illusion, revealing that they never left White Space. He said that they could never defeat him, but that there is something that can;  Niles must tell the truth. Niles revealed that he was the one who caused all their accidents, much to Mr. Nobody's pleasure, as the truth comes to light.

Nobody had beers on the sad shelf and talked to the Doom Patrol about everything that happened and how Niles' abomination daughter transformed the two treacherous plagues into giants. He also told how he captured Danny, how Niles got angry with Nobody, and how Vic made a plan with the team to rescue Niles' daughter from the painting. For part of the plan, Rita had to convince Nobody to help.

   Nobody was venting to Rita, telling her that he was expelled from an evil organization by a rat and a cockroach. Nobody was angry because of this. Rita told him that they are both failures. Despite being defeated, it does not mean that it is the end of his story. Rita convinced him to return to the narrative and have a great comeback. Nobody was inspired by her words. While Ezekiel sang, Mr. Nobody interrupted him returning his narration and convinced Ezekiel that he was God, that he could survive anything, and that now he must destroy the world. Ezekiel then ate Vic.

   After Ezekiel ate Niles, Jane, Rita and Dorothy, Larry told Nobody that Cliff is missing and Nobody said that to save him he would have to improvise. Nobody made Ezekiel and Whiskers fall in love. Ezekiel and Larry started the explosion, and Nobody said that the end of this epic story was now upon them. Ernest ran and asked Nobody how the Doom Patrol will survive inside Ezekiel.  Mr. Nobody realized that they could not go out or do something, and before he could respond, the explosion reached them. After the explosion, Nobody and Ernest were trapped in the painting.
