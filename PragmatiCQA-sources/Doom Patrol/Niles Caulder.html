   with several animal skins as clothes. While at first she was very hostile toward Niles while he healed, they eventually grew close as they gave a makeshift funeral for the bodies of a few hunters who had been killed presumably by the woman. During the funeral, Niles realized with the help of cave paintings and markings that the woman, dubbed Oyewah, was a part of a tribe of ancient humans from possible prehistoric times, imbued with immortality and powerful psychic abilities, which allow her to create avatars such as the

   Niles and Oyewah began to live together, hunting and living a simple yet fulfilling life that Niles described as his happiest. He and Oyewah eventually became romantically involved, which eventually ended in tragedy as Alistair found Niles again, telling him of the changes that had happened in the outside world and with the Bureau of Oddites, now renamed the

   Knowing that Alistair's intent was to capture Oyewah and give her to the Bureau, Niles tricked him into falling into broken ice, drowning him. Niles then, in order to protect his love, destroyed his journal of the events and rejoined the Bureau, under the story that he had been surviving on his own until he was found, with nothing to report. From that point on, Niles' mission in life was to protect Oyewah and other 'oddities' like her, from the "true monsters in the world," such as the Department of Normalcy.
