     physiology
    </b>
    : Larry Trainor was "accidentally" sent into a field of cosmic radiation while testing an experimental jet in the stratosphere. When he crash landed back on earth his physiology had changed permanently and requires the Chief's bandages to protect those around him from his radiation.

The being has it's own free will, and can come out at any time it pleases, though this is evidently easier when Larry is under stress. While the being is out, Larry goes unconscious, his mind inhabiting a dream world created by the Negative Spirit.

     Power instability:
    </b>
    Larry is not able to control when the Negative Spirit comes out, and when it does, it leaves his body unconscious, while his mind is forced into a vision created by the spirit. While this vision is typically torturous, it doesn't have to be, as the Negative Spirit does sometimes try to make it pleasant for Larry.
