   The Pioneers of the Uncharted was a space program initiated and started by
   <a href="Niles Caulder.html" key="993472a8-75ed-4303-a0c2-b8ff55e16d16" title="Niles Caulder">
    Niles Caulder
   </a>
   sixty years ago as a project directly under his "
   Immortus Program
   " after receiving the funding and backing of the
   Bureau of Normalcy
   to continue his research into finding the various different methods that he believed could give someone Immortality.
  </p>
  <p key="257f170b-de16-41d5-8df3-b852c832744b">
   The main mission given to the Pioneers by Caulder was to locate and chase after a "cosmic entity", a teleporting rift that would randomly appear in the nigh sky due to believing that the unique pattern of the entity's cosmic radiation was a source of time dilating powers that could potentially give someone exposed to it immortality.
  </p>
  <p key="aeb329d0-03b4-488d-b5a8-c6747d443626">
   The Pioneers was thus then launched into space in order to acquire a sample of this entity, with them following it deeper and farther away from the earth and into deep space.
  </p>
  <p key="a7dc116b-1c5e-43b0-aa30-0e9e123a784b">
   Eventually, the Pioneers successfully caught up to the entity, where
   Valentina Vostok
   then volunteered to venture outside of their ship in order to collect the sample. However, this instead resulted in her becoming radiated with the cosmic energies and being possessed by the entity. Permanently altering her physiology and giving her metahuman abilities.
  </p>
  <p key="6987d5b7-7065-4c09-ad61-eea2b04a4554">
   Due to the changes done to her, Valentina's body had become incredibly poisonous and toxic due to the high levels of radiation she emitted, resulting in her spending five years in her ship's airlock to avoid killing her fellow crew-mates.
  </p>
  <p key="ef124dd7-73bf-44b4-97ed-3b503a46b45c">
   However, during these five years, Valentina successfully communicated with her "Spirit" possessing her and soon developed a harmonic symbiotic relationship with "her". Eventually, resulting in her gaining full conscious control of her powers and contain her radiation from inside her skin.
  </p>
  <p key="d7e8cf4b-5c03-497f-971d-6f98434ed80f">
   During their deep space travel, the Pioneers had somehow landed in a alien planet where the planet's fauna had infected her two crew mates,
