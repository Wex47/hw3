   Vic knocks on Larry's door and says that there's a team meeting in fifteen minutes. Larry gets up and starts putting his protective bandages on, and then suggests to the Spirit that they stay in. It leaves his body, and Larry passes out and finds himself in the back of a truck with John, kissing. He remembers that it was before the accident, and "John" suggests that it might be different. Larry says that it's not real or accurate, but "John" tells him to concentrate on being there. As Larry complains to the Spirit, he wakes up and wonders what it's trying to tell him. The Spirit leaves his body again, and Larry finds himself back in the memory with the details accurate. "John" tells him to just be there with him in their stolen moment, and Larry tells the Spirit that John didn't want an open relationship. He insists that history doesn't change and he's still a hypocrite that ruined other people's lives. Larry wakes up and tells the Spirit not to interrupt him. He returns to the memory and Larry tells the Spirit that it has no idea how hard it was to live with the lies and fear. He says that the context is missing from the fantasy and everyone hated and mocked homosexuals, and "John" says that he's waited a long time to hear Larry say that and wanted him to admit it to himself. "John" tells Larry that he's missing the sunset and they kiss.

He then knocks on Jane's door and she says that he's not the Chief. Vic sits in the sun room and waits for thirty minutes, but no one comes down. He finally gets a notice that a woman, Janice, swiped right on his dating profile. Vic realizes that it's a profile he made as a joke when he was 18, and has 267 notices.

   When Vic calls Silas, Silas says that the messages were distractions. He points out that Vic stole the sat key from him, and explains that Vic need focus and the parental controls were for Vic's protections. Vic says that he'll control his own life, and has his internal program Grid check for Niles in all known data sources. He then contacts Janice and they chat while Vic exercises. Jane dances through the garden as Vic looks on, and Vic searches for someone who doesn't call him "Cyborg". He comes up with Mel, a med student, and Grid sends him everything it can find on Mel including live surveillance footage from a city bus. Grid admits that it can read Vic's subconscious and has been able to do so since Vic lifted the restrictions on it. Vic sends Mel photos of himself and sees Mel look at them in disgust. He has Grid delete his dating profile, and Grid reports that it has found nothing on Niles. It does report an incoming threat, just as Cliff punches him and says that he ruined Clara. The two of them fight and the manor shakes.

Down the hall, Jane takes over briefly from Hammerhead and says to go to the meeting so they can find Niles and he'll explain everything.
