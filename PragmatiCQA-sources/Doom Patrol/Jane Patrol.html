   A catatonic Jane is confronted by her many other personalities in the Underground, who want her to restore order and resume being the dominant personality. With the help of Driver 8, Jane chooses to remain catatonic and try to figure out what is wrong with her. Back in Doom Manor, the team argues about how to help Jane until Larry's negative spirit sends Cliff's consciousness into the Underground. He is soon subdued by two of Jane's aggressive personalities, Hammerhead and Driller Bill, and locked in a cell next to Karen. She is let go, and Penny Farthing leads Cliff through Jane's memories. Cliff and Jane face her biggest fear, revealed to be Jane's abusive father, who appears as a giant monster made of puzzle pieces. Jane's cathartic rage destroys him, and she and Cliff leave the Underground. Jane awakens in Doom Manor.

   Hammerhead returns to the prison and releases Karen. Cliff starts punching the wall to try to escape, but then Jack Straw slides him an ice pick. Cliff breaks a hole through the wall and sees Jane on a bed. He tries to apologize to her, but she doesn't hear or see him. Penny appears and tells Cliff that Jane is in trouble, and explains the Jane on the bed is a memory. Penny tells Cliff the real Jane is heading towards the well and she needs his help to stop her.

   Jane walks across a street in a metropolitan area. She watches her past-self get caught by two mental institution workers while she is playing with a stray dog. Meanwhile, Penny and Cliff walk down the hallway of a high school and enter a classroom. A young Kay Challis is seen not paying attention in class, and thus is reprimanded by her teacher. Kay says that she is Miranda, not Kay. She notices Cliff and Penny walking towards a door in the back of the classroom, causing her to repeatedly whisper the phrase "shut the door." Penny reveals that behind the door is what's left of Miranda's work station, and as they open it Miranda gets up and yells "shut the door."

   Penny tells Cliff Miranda threw herself into the well. She says everyone looking for answers is sent to the well. The two then reach a memory where Cliff is watching Jane paint on the lawn of the mansion. Cliff wonders why the memory is buried so deep. Penny explains this memory was the start of everything going sideways for the personalities because Cliff gave Jane hope.

   . She is found by Cliff and Penny. Cliff apologizes to Jane for pushing her to receive therapy, and urges her to come back to the surface. Jane doesn't appreciate the apology. Jane argues with Cliff, but then hears her father's voice whisper "Sweet, Sweet, Baby Kay, please don't keep me waiting." Cliff tells Jane he knows everything about the Underground and the well, but Jane pleads with him to leave. She begs Cliff to get out of her head, which is the only thing that will truly help her, and she leaves. Jane walks down an empty hallway that reminds her of the one in her childhood home. While walking, she hears her father's whispers. At the end of the hallway, she is confronted by

   Penny and Cliff follow Jane, but Penny refuses to go on and leaves Cliff on his own. Meanwhile, Jane walks down the hallway of her childhood home, and opens the door to her bedroom. She sees a young Kay Challis finishing a puzzle of a meadow; the meadow of the memory in which Jane was in earlier. Jane realizes that this is where "she" began. Jane tries to seek the advice of Kay even though she knows it's only a memory. Kay's father appears, and the memory from the beginning of the episode plays. Kay gets up and is forced to leave the room with her father, but when Kay looks back, she is replaced with Jane. Kay wishes Jane goodbye as she finishes her puzzle.

   Black Annis senses Cliff's presence. Black Annis slashes at Cliff's face, and explains no man can pass the door leading to the well. This triggers Cliff to replay painful memories of his past in his mind. He begins to peel off his human skin, revealing his robot suit underneath. Cliff tells Black Annis he is no longer a man, and she proceeds to caress his body with her claws, eventually groping his metal groin. She is convinced that Cliff is not a man and allows him to pass.

   Cliff walks towards Jane, who is standing on the edge of the well. Jane looks as if she is in a trance, as she repeats the phrases "no one tells" and "no where to turn." Suddenly, a whirlwind of leaves erupts from the well and takes on the giant form of Jane's father. Jane says that no one can fight daddy, but Cliff pleads with her to fight. Jane's father grabs Cliff and drops him away from Jane. She becomes distressed, and she yells at her father that she is no longer afraid of him. The giant deteriorates and the leaves go back down the well.

   Jane and Cliff are seen sitting next to each other on a moving train in the Underground. They get off the train and walk together towards the surface. The two return to the others in the real world. Vic asks Cliff what happened in the Underground, to which Cliff responds it is not his story to tell. Jane returns to her room and lays on her bed, but when she closes her eyes she hears her father's voice whispering "sweet, sweet baby." Jane quickly opens her eyes.
