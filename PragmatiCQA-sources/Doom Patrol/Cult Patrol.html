Willoughby takes out a coin and says that the Book is a person and they need to find him, and the oracle Baphomet is coming and will tell them where the Book is. The coins glow and the horsehead of Baphomet appears with a spike in its forehead.
   Baphomet
   sings about Eliot--the Book--and how he was raised in Salt Lake City. The oracle says that time isn't on their side.

   Out in the hallway, the team discusses whether they should get involved. Vic confirms that Willoughby is a member of the
   Knights Templar
   and a chaos magician, but there are gaps in his past. Larry believes Baphomet, and Willoughby joins them and tells them to get a move on. Vic tells Willoughby that they're in, and Willoughby opens a portal to the Book. Jane goes through and the others follow her through except Rita. The group comes back a few seconds later with Elliot and tells Willoughby to close the portal. Martha comes through with a knife and Jane shoves her back through. Willoughby closes the portal and puts a cloaking spell on Elliot to hide him from the Cult.

   Willoughby takes out a blowtorch and says that it's time to kill Elliot. The others refuse but Willoughby says that if he's being read then it's the end of the world. The only other way to stop the Cult is to close the gates in
   Nurnheim
   , the ghost of a city destroyed centuries ago. The Cult comes from Nurnheim, and Willoughby explains that the "gate" is a stigmata on a person's hands. As the gates open, more assassins are unleased like the Little Sisters. The only way to close the gate is to find the person with the stigmata and sew the wounds shut. Hammerhead admits that she can knit, and Willoughby produces some of Janis Joplin's dental floss for the strongest spiritual thread in the world to sew the gates shut. He tells them to find the person and close the gates, and Robotman insists on going with Hammerhead. Whereas Vic, Larry, and Rita will stay there and protect Elliot. Willoughby uses "knowing gum" to find the gates and learns that the person is in Babia.

   Flit takes herself and Robotman to Babia, and Robotman asks Hammerhead what "Paraguay" means. She finally tells him that Robotman is a monster, and Robotman points out that she's just as aggressive as he is. Hammerhead says that she exists for a reason and asks what his excuse is. Willoughby tells Larry and Vic that they need to be ready if Robotman and Jane fail. Vic secures the perimeter while Larry stays close to Elliot. Willoughby goes to get hot sauce, and Rita tells Vic that none of them are heroes and Vic can't make them into something they're not. She figures that he has something to prove, and Vic says that the negative being is a hero even if Larry isn't. Rita warns that the being might be insane.

   Robotman and Jane enter the church and hear Cuevo praying. They look for him and Hammerhead wonders how many lives were ruined there. Robotman finds Cuevo in the confessional booth staring at his glowing hands. Hammerhead grabs Cuevo and yells at him that she's going to help him like he helped all the people that trusted him. She screams that "she" trusted Cuevo, and Robotman stops her and says it isn't about what happened to Jane.

A red-hooded man walks up and says that they have no business there, and tells them to come with him. Penny walks over to join the man, and another hooded man jabs Robotman in the back with a mystical staff. The men toss Jane and Robotman in a cart and take them to a church in the center of town.

   Willoughby prepares a ritual using the hot sauce and rosaries to create a barrier. He uses an incantation using backward Beatles' lyrics, and Elliot wonders if it will save him. Willoughby tells him that he's done the best he can and the team is incompetent, and wishes everyone luck.

   As Vic checks his internal weaponry, Willoughby tells him that his friends closed the gates. He pours himself a drink over Vic's objections, and warns that they're going to have to kill Elliot if their magic and science don't work. Vic refuses to kill Elliot and can't believe Niles would associate with someone who would kill a boy. Willoughby says that the Niles he knows would kill a boy to keep the world spinning and can live with the decision even if he's forever haunted by them, and says that Vic might live long enough to learn a few things.

   Elliot looks at a photo of his family and his home on the phone, and says that they fixed it up together. He wonders if his parents loved him, and explains that they told him he'd be a hero and save the world. Larry says that "hero" is a title that other people hang onto someone and they have to carry it around, and explains that he tried to be a hero once and destroyed everything he had. He tells Elliot that he has to be true to himself while it took Larry a lifetime to figure it out. Larry says that Elliot should have a little faith, and Elliot says that he saw his mother kill his father and maybe he should kill himself and end it.

   The being emerges from Larry, opens the door, and steps back. Elliot walks out, and the being props Larry up in front of the player and turns on the video again. Larry wakes up and realizes that Elliot is gone, and asks the being if it wants the world to end. In the video, the being emerges under Niles' prodding, and Larry watches as Niles takes out a device allowing them to communicate. The being enters the device and says that it sustains itself through torture. The device burns out before Niles can ask anything else. Larry reruns the tape and looks at his chest.

   Rita finds Elliot sitting on a windowsill. He wonders why he's fighting destiny when he could just kill himself, and Rita points out that they're on the second floor. Elliot admits that he's too weak to even try, and Rita tells him that it's going to be okay and asks him to come back inside. After a moment Elliot takes her hand and goes back in, and Rita tells him that he doesn't need the burden of ending his life. She admits that they may not be able to save him but asks for the chance to try.

   Penny wakes up and wakes up Robotman. Martha and Todd's corpse are there, dressed as giant clowns and sitting on thrones in the front of the church. Martha says that they can stay as their guests, and explains that they are the Archons: High Priests of Nurnheim. Cliff recognizes Martha from Doom Manor, and he realizes that they're Elliot's parents. Martha says that they have ascended for protecting the Book and been rewarded, and that Todd's suffering was brief. Once the Decreator arises, all of them will cease to be. Robotman says that it won't happen, and Mother Archon tells them that they're too late because they will read the Book. When Robotman points out that Elliot is under a cloaking spell, Mother Archon tells him that they see everything.

   Elsewhere, Larry tells Vic that Elliott left and he's just as screwed up as Larry is. Rita comes in with Elliot and says that the boy is fine, and she thought Willoughby could save him. The windows rattle and Willoughby says that they're there. Rita takes Elliot back to the lab and Larry guards the hallway. As Rita and Elliot go into the lab, she breaks one of the rosaries.

More of these assassins  attack Larry, and the being doesn't come out. They eventually tackle Larry and the being finally emerges and tears them apart. Elliot realizes that it's hopeless to put the rosary back together, and Rita says that she was going to leave when Elliot stopped her. Rita insists that she's trying to be a good person and Elliot is ruining her moment, and yells at him to pick up the beads. He goes back to work.

   Vic and Willoughby continue destroying the assassins and the remaining ones retreat, and the Hoodmen--the royal guard of Nurnheim--come in their stead. Willoughby shoves Vic at them, and as they stun him with their staffs Willoughby walks out. Willoughby arrives at the lab and attacks Rita. She elongates and shoves him back, and Willoughby tells her that she has to kill Elliot because there's too many of them. The Little Sisters cut their way in, grab Elliot, and leave with him before Rita can stop them. Vic activates an ionic grenade, destroying the Hoodmen.

   In Nurnheim, Mother Archon says that they have the Unwritten Book. Robotman says that she's a lousy parent and he would know, and Mother Archon tells him that she was a good custodian of the Book. She explains that there's only perception: the way they see things, the way they see themselves. Robotman finds himself as Cliff while Jane sees all of her personas reflected on the tiles. Mother Archon says that there's also how they see each other, and Robotman finds himself back in his robot body, his hands covered in blood. Jane turns into
