   During one investigation in Northern Yukon in 1913, Niles and fellow researcher

    woman
   </a>
   with several animal skins as clothes. While at first she was very hostile toward Niles while he healed, they eventually grew close as they gave a makeshift funeral for the bodies of a few hunters who had been killed presumably by the woman. During the funeral, Niles realized with the help of cave paintings and markings that the woman, dubbed Oyewah, was a part of a tribe of ancient humans from possible prehistoric times, imbued with immortality and powerful psychic abilities, which allow her to create avatars such as the

  <p key="88be1e75-5853-490f-ae85-67d9a34b1560">
   Niles and Oyewah began to live together, hunting and living a simple yet fulfilling life that Niles described as his happiest. He and Oyewah eventually became romantically involved, which eventually ended in tragedy as Alistair found Niles again, telling him of the changes that had happened in the outside world and with the Bureau of Oddites, now renamed the
   Bureau of Normalcy
   .
  </p>
  <p key="17e59226-8b84-4b19-a944-379c8a35cc68">
   Knowing that Alistair's intent was to capture Oyewah and give her to the Bureau, Niles tricked him into falling into broken ice, drowning him. Niles then, in order to protect his love, destroyed his journal of the events and rejoined the Bureau, under the story that he had been surviving on his own until he was found, with nothing to report. From that point on, Niles' mission in life was to protect Oyewah and other 'oddities' like her, from the "true monsters in the world," such as the Department of Normalcy.

Aware of how dangerous these experiments were, Niles shot Dr. Fuchs and shut down Morden's experiment, also stealing a large amount of money Morden spent for the procedure. Niles believed he killed both Von Fuchs and Morden but using his own perverted science, Von Fuchs managed to survive, hooked up to machines for the rest of his life. Morden also survived and would vow revenge on Caulder.
