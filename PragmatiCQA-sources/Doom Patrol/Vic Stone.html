   When Silas woke up, Vic apologized to him for everything that happened. Vic talked to Silas about what was happening with his technology and discovered that Silas could save Elinore, but Niles convinced him to save him as he could do extraordinary things. Vic was enraged at his father and Niles because his mother had remained alive, so he withdrew from the hospital to join his friends. Upon returning to the manor, Vic realized there was a fake Vic and soon discovered that it was actually Nobody, who sent them all including Vic to White Space. Vic wanted to attack Nobody, but they couldn't defeat him and the only option to get rid of him was if Niles told a secret truth. With no other options, Niles revealed that he was responsible for all their accidents, angering everyone, and they were sent back to the manor.
