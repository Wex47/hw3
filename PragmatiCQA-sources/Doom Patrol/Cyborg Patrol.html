   , the team gathers to discuss Vic's disappearance. Larry confirms that Jane saw the same symbol that he has on a patch from the Bureau of Normalcy. He explains that originally it was the Bureau of Oddities, a secret division of the government tasked with investigating the unusual. After World War I, the Bureau's mission changed to containment, weaponization, and eradication. Larry admits that he was one of their assets, and they studied and tortured "them" for years. He says that the
   Ant Farm
   is the Bureau's research and containment facility. They can't go there because there's no way in or out of the Ant Farm. Niles got Larry out of the Ant Farm, and Larry suggests that they talk to Silas. Rita and Jane both disagree, and Jane says that Vic doesn't trust Silas. Jane says that Vic removed Grid because it was malfunctioning.

Looking through a vent, Vic sees Prisoner 722, who tells Vic that it's not so bad there and they get to serve their country. People come to get them, and they leave, and 722 doesn't remember what happens but there's always a perk afterward. He vaguely remembers that he's been there since the 60's. Vic sits down on his bunk and realizes that his system is rebooting.

   Silas discovers that Vic was running diagnostics on Grid, and explains that there's an emergency protocol to repair damaged tissue if Vic is injured.

   Silas leads the team to a parking garage, and the Spirit "tells" Larry that it doesn't want to go back to the Ant Farm. He agrees but says that they need to do it for Vic. Silas leads the team to a door at the top of the garage, opens it to reveal an elevator. Jane and Larry put on Bureau agent costumes while Cliff pretends to be a prisoner that they're bringing in.

Going to the window, Darren says that they did nothing to Vic and found him the way he is, and there's no take-backs on the deal. Vic wonders what deal Silas made.
