   Rita is waiting the reception room of Bloom Pictures and adjusts her face in her compact mirror. Sydney Bloom finally calls her in and Rita says that she wants the romantic role in his latest picture. Bloom tells her that word has it that Rita is abusive and moody, and she needs a miracle. He invites her to sit on his knee and starts kissing her, and tells her to show him how hungry she is for the role. Rita loses control of her body and her flesh stops holding its form. Her blob form swallows Bloom up and he smothers to death. The secretary comes in and sees Bloom's corpse, and says that he had a heart attack. She gives Rita her sweater, tells her that she was never there, and ushers her out.
