  <p key="f33702c2-f612-4ccb-b609-18be5e36be9f">
   As a little girl, Kay was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused by her own father. The experience caused her to develop dissociative identity disorder and manifest 64 different alters.
  </p>
  <p key="5a8b62f7-33c8-40e5-8e3e-27f3bde98c0c">
   In 1954 one night, Kay's father dragged her to a well at their farm to punish her for disobeying him. Her father forced her in the bucket so he could put her in the well. Kay attempted to apologize for disobeying and begged him not do it, but he kept lowering her into the well, anyway. While trapped in the well, Kay dropped her stuffed animal "Harry" in the water during her attempts to escape due to her caving into her fear and thus falling into a panic. This trauma created the "Well" in a place called the "

   abuse.
  </p>
  <p key="2e38f4a3-4fd3-4a8f-b35a-e76113b76f99">
   As seen in her memories, Kay's alters had already seemingly formed during her early adolescence, and identified themselves immediately as separate people. Due to her inability to understand the psychological damage incurred to her daughter, Elena instead concluded that her daughter was possessed by "demons". This caused her mother to have her exorcised by the local town priest in a  feeble attempt to have the "demons" removed from her daughter, This was done by having Kay being constantly dunked into a tub of holy water repeatedly until the "demons" left her body. The trauma of this event and her current alters inability to make them stop eventually resulted in the creation of a new alter, "

   ", who after a brief argument with the other alters to keep Kay safe in their mind, successfully surfaced and proceeded to manipulate the priest and the church goers into thinking that she was "saved" and successfully convincing them that she was now "cured". After that, Kay  permanently receded into the Underground and handed over full control of her body to her new "Primary". Later, Miranda proceeded to subtly threaten Elena to never do something like this again, lest she reveals to everyone what truly occurred in their home. Eventually, Miranda continued acting as the primary alter during middle school, where Miranda got into much trouble with her teachers due to her refusal to answer or be referred to as "Kay" and insisting on being called "Miranda".
  </p>
  <p key="796f4e76-15d2-44c8-9dbb-62bdef5f92f8">
   Eventually, Miranda, not wanting to put up with their father's abuse any further, ran away from home in order to try and give Kay and the other alters a chance at happiness.
  </p>
  <p key="400532ce-c915-4b6f-8581-6ab2edd3842c">
   Sometime in 1969, Miranda created something akin to a normal peaceful life for herself.  She got a stable job as a waitress in a diner that more or less kept them fed and provided for them, making her and the other alters feel content. One day, Miranda was approached and asked out by a local musician, Johnny Bill's, for a date. Miranda, wanting to move forward and forget their past trauma and believing that Johnny could help them, agreed to go out on a date with him. Eventually, the two became a couple and moved in with each other.

  <p key="f5001ee6-f7f0-4b40-95c3-dec6f381afab">
   However, due to wanting to finally have sex with Miranda, Johnny arranged a "house warming party" that eventually evolved into a full blown orgy and she was pressured by Johnny to participate. Pressured, Miranda agreed under the belief that she would only have sex with Johnny, despite the objections of the other alters. Believing that it would be good for them, Miranda ignored their objections and went ahead with it. However, Johnny instead had her have sex with one of his friends instead, This greatly hurt Miranda and reminded all of the alters of their abuse under their father. This triggered her and resulted in Miranda losing control as several other alters began to manifest. The first was

   Miranda soon found herself dragged back to the Underground, where all of her fellow alters, angered by her actions, expressed their disappointment, hurt and pain at Miranda having failed to "keep them safe". They further mentioned how  Scarlet Harlot, Pretty Polly and Penny Farthing were particularly traumatized by the event. In a daze, Miranda went to see Kay to apologize. Hurt by her primary's actions, Kay only slammed the door on Miranda face.

   Jane, as the new primary of Kay, went onto spend a majority of her life within mental wards and asylums due to her erratic and frequently violent behavior. During which, Jane was noted to frequently sneak out of the asylum to attend punk rock concerts or wander around. These excursions would usually end with her being forcibly retrieved and beaten by the orderlies back to the asylum. Eventually, sometime while being "treated", Jane was experimented on by scientists, but one of their experiments gave her alters their unique metahuman powers.

     Power instability
    </b>
    : Like the rest of the Doom Patrol members, Jane has little to no control over her alters and their individual abilities. This proves to be a weakness as when they need a certain ability, and the alter with said ability is preoccupied or merely unwilling to help. While her alters can be beneficial, they can also be a weakness, as Jane has no control over them, and they are free to come and go as they please.

     Separated memory
    </b>
    : Each of Jane's alters have different memories exclusive to them due to the dissociative amnesia symptom of her disorder. This means that in order to question Jane about a specific event, one must coax out the alter dominant during the event; this is seen in Donkey Patrol when Victor Stone tries to converse with the Underground about what they saw during their time in the dimension created by Mr. Nobody. This could be circumvented if the personality decides to share their memories via talking with other alters in the underground.

Hammerhead possesses an explosive temper and gets extremely angry with minimal provocation and Sylvia seems to have similar issues. Katy is also noted as being highly volatile and antisocial and Jane also has a volatile temper and is easily angered. This is most likely a coping mechanism due to trauma.

     Psychological childishness:
    </b>
    Baby Doll has also showcased sociopathic and cruel tendencies when surfaced due to her being frozen at the psychological and emotional age of a three year old. That causes her to react impulsively violent and throw tantrums when provoked due to still not fully understanding the full consequences or implications of her actions, a behavior that eventually lead her to her supposed death.

     Manipulation:
    </b>
    Doctor Harrison has shown to have highly manipulative and low-empathy tendencies that often causes her to manipulate others into extreme self harm, coupled with her power. This, however, also causes her to become highly arrogant and develop a tendency to always think that others will do what she wants.

     Human physiology
    </b>
    : Jane, at her base level, is a normal human woman who has no powers and can be hurt or killed as easily as any other person. She stands at 5'2 with little muscle and her strength level is typical for a woman with her frame.

     Trust issues
    </b>
    : Whenever Jane comes across someone she or the other alters have trouble trusting, one of her alters takes over and reacts accordingly depending on their personality. In the beginning of the show, this mostly applied to Hammerhead, who would often react aggressively even in situations that didn't require it, such as when the cops showed up to her and Cliff in the pilot episode. Her first reaction is to start a fight with them. However, it seems to apply to all 64 alters as shown in Season 2, where it was openly stated by Jane and Hammerhead during their conversation regarding Baby Doll's death that a majority of the 64 alters do not trust men.
