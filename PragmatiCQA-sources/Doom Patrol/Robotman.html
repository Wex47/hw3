   After the race was over, Cliff assaulted Bump with his trophy and once again had sex with Giselle. However, Cliff felt guilty for his treatment of his family and wanted to reconnect with them. He called Kate, leaving a voicemail in which he promised to be better for them, which spurred Kate to answer his call. Kate decided to give him another chance and allowed Cliff to pick up both her and her daughter that same night. While driving, Cliff was distracted by his family and not focused on driving. He heard his wife scream his name right before he noticed a semi truck that had jack knifed in the road. Once again, the accident was purposely

While in town, Jane took Cliff to a toy shop, so that he could find a gift for his daughter. Shortly after, they took a seat on a bench, and Cliff admired Jane's smoking, wishing he could have one himself. Hammerhead soon surfaced after Cliff moped about his daughter, claiming that she was still alive, prompting some police officers to approach. She began to get aggressive, but they were interrupted by Rita, who had become a blob that was moving across town. Cliff hurried over, pulling up a piece of road, and stopping her in her tracks. Once the Chief returned, seeing the damage, he scolded the group.

However, Cliff refused, and made his way into town on foot, while the rest took the bus away. They changed their minds, though, and joined Cliff. Arriving in the middle of town, Dr. Caulder stayed on the bus, while the rest joined Cliff in observing an unusual

Almost everyone decides to help him and Kipling opens a portal for them to take the book, turning out to be a boy. When they manage to rescue him from his mother and bring him to the mansion, Kipling tells them that he must burn his body to prevent them from reading it, since closing the doors of Nurnheim would be more difficult.
