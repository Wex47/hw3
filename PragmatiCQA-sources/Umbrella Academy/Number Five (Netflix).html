     As the rest of the Umbrella Academy members, "Number Five" was born on October 1st, 1989, and was adopted by Sir Reginald Hargreeves, who, along with
     Grace
     , raised Number Five and the
     rest of the Hargreeves siblings
     .

     He was seen in a flashback, during a crime scene. Sir Reginald had him and the others wear their professional attire (black suits with white masks) and head to the scene of the active crime. From there they entered the bank, most likely through a back door entrance or through Five's
     teleportation.
     The remainder of his siblings had subdued most of the criminals. One robber told
     them
     to stay back. Five teleported behind him and questioned what the Robber would do if they didn't. The robber, shocked, attempted to shoot Five but Five teleported behind him again. The robber spun round to use his gun but is surprised to see he now holds a stapler in his hand. Five takes the stapler and pushes it into the Robbers head. After most of the robbers are subdued, Five and his siblings watch as
     Ben
     uses his
     power
     to kill the rest of the thieves. The Umbrella Academy is showcased outside of the crime scene surrounded by news reporters and journalists.

     Later throughout the week, Five exits a limousine outside of his home. He and his siblings are intruded on by
     Harold Jenkins
     , cosplaying their outfits. Leonard attempts to console with
     Reginald
     , divulging that he was born on the same day as Five, and would like to ally with the Umbrella Academy. Five watches as Reginald mortifies and drags out Harold in front of a crowd. But he and the others brush the occurrence away and return to their normal lives.

     One day, Five is eating lunch when he has the sudden thought of time traveling. He approaches his father and announces that he wishes to travel in time. Reginald is shocked by his sudden exaggeration and explains that Five has not yet tamed his own ability. Five is agitated by Reginald's comment, provoked that Reginald underestimates him. With that, he leaves his home. With his ability to jump through space and time not yet perfected, Five found himself transported to a near future in which the world had been destroyed. Five attempts to travel back to the present but finds himself unable to do so.

     Five finds the Hargreeves manor turned to rubble, with all of his siblings, except
     Vanya
     , dead. Luther's corpse holds a prosthetic eyeball, which Five acquires. He accepts his fate of doom and seclusion and strives to survive in the Apocalypse as long as he can. He procures a newspaper with the date of the Apocalypse. Whilst searching through the wreckage of a local convenience store, caused in the wake of
     the apocalypse
     , Five lays his eyes upon a tattered mannequin, whose lower body was removed by means that still remain unknown. Five, alone and yearning for company, drags the mannequin along with him, naming her "Dolores." Together, they venture the wrecked and ruined earth. For over 40 years, Five remains alone in the ruined place, longing for company that is not plastic or inanimate. He still investigates the cause of the apocalypse, always bearing the prosthetic eyeball and Dolores. Soon, he is greeted by a peculiar
     woman
     who calls herself "The Handler." Five acquires his shotgun and positions it towards the handler, demanding why she would be so rude as to trespass into his territory. The Handler assures him that she means not to Hinder him or his time, but comes with an offer, or Ultimatum in a sense. She informs him that she is a member of the
     Temps Commission
     , an organization created to maintain the proper flow of time, and remove threats that terrorize the timeline. She declares that if he accepts her offer, he will maintain a safe home, away from the apocalypse/ Five, with nowhere else to go, accepts.

Five reveals that he has a plan: he will take all of his family with him through time in an effort to avoid the apocalypse. Despite not being sure of his abilities, Five is successful in traveling through time with his family.

    <p key="e63ef301-816f-41a5-891f-274096925fda">
     Five's attempts to get his family back to their timeline fail, however, and he is forced to abandon the briefcase before it is activated.
     Five explains to Luther that the only option is to go face a previous version of himself in the same timeline and plead with him to hand over the briefcase. Older, previous Five is initially reluctant to give Five the briefcase, but Five is able to convince him in exchange for the correct math that would return him to 2019 in his original body; Five is annoyed to find that the briefcase is destroyed in the process, however.

     After the members of
     the Umbrella Academy
     are able to save Vanya from destroying the world for a second time, Five and the other members of the Academy face off against
     the Handler
     and the Commission. They are successful in killing the agents, but all of the members of the Academy — except for Five — are shot to death by the Handler. Scared, Five remembers advice given to him from Reginals about traveling back in time minutes, rather than decades. He is able to travel back in time and prevent the Handler from killing his siblings and makes a deal with
     Herb
     to allow him to take a briefcase and return his family to their rightful place within the timeline.

      Personality
     </span>
    </h2>
    <p key="0f8bb287-a207-4680-b271-ec85421ceee8">
     At age 13, Number Five became trapped in the apocalyptic future for more than 40 years. When he found a way back, his body regressed to that of his 13-year-old self, while his mind stayed the same. As a result, he has the personality of a 60-year-old and is frustrated at being trapped in the body of a child. He is shown to have a genius intellect, often dismissing others, including his family, as stupid or inferior, and expressing disinterest in their personal affairs. He is also shown to be sarcastic, pragmatic, and incredibly prideful. He also exhibits impulsive behavior due to his prideful nature, which is seen when he brazenly uses his time-traveling powers as a boy despite Reginald Hargreeves' warnings that he was not fully prepared to wield them.
    </p>
    <p key="adf8cd27-c0dc-48f2-922b-59e1e2773c12">
     Number Five is also shown to be a ruthless and incredibly efficient killer. While he does not enjoy killing, he seems to have no qualms about the people he has killed and is more than willing to eliminate anyone, even innocent people, whose deaths may stop the apocalypse from happening and even displays nonchalance when making plans to murder them. He gained fame in his times as an agent of the Temps Commission for his success in killing countless individuals on missions, which he did as part of his contract in order to get back home to the present. Overall, Number Five has shown to be perfectly willing to eliminate anyone who stands in the way of his goals.
    </p>
    <p key="ce39d3f4-f8ad-4497-86e7-f7a82564ebcd">
     Despite his antisocial behavior, he does have compassion and cares for his family deeply. He works tirelessly both in the past and future to prevent the apocalypse and is seemingly the most devoted member of the family in stopping it. He even refuses to involve his family most of the time out of fear they would die. When he "renegotiates" his contract with the
     Temps Commission
     , he demands that his family be saved as well.
