  <p key="116c6ec9-76d8-4674-9175-3acbf0c2193a">
   Faced with an increasing number of lunatics with superpowers eager to face off with his own wunderkind brood, Sir Reginald Hargreeves developed the ultimate solution.
  </p>
  <p key="fa22d270-603e-4254-9a1a-d98926b74392">
   Now, just a few years after Hargreeves's death, his Umbrella Academy is scattered. Number Five is a hired gun, Kraken is stalking big game, Rumor is dealing with the wreckage of her marriage, a rotund Spaceboy runs around the streets of Tokyo, Vanya continues her physical therapy after being shot in the head--and no one wants to even mention Seance until issue #2.

   The plot begins following the events of But the Past Ain’t Through With You. The Murder Magician has just been arrested by Hargreeves and, despite his protestations, is sentenced to be imprisoned in the Hotel Oblivion. The Magician lambasting Hargreeves as a monster, the exterrestrial entrepreneur defends himself by stating that “This is progress.” Arriving at the Hotel, Murder Magician is initially unfazed by the faceless bellboys at the Hotel, but alarmed when a hideously deformed person pokes his head out of his hotel room door, cryptically whispers that the telephone never rings, and slams the door again. Having reached his room, the Murder Magician discovers, much to his chagrin, a suitcase containing a self-help book written by Hargreeves, and, after settling down to watch 1920s-style cartoons on the television, only now realises the extent of his full punishment.
