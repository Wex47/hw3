    Body
   </b>
   was the name of a chimpanzee who acted as
   Prime 8's
   drummer during their adolescent years. After growing impatient with
   The Kraken
   failing to attend one of their concerts on time due to being summoned to active heroism, Body walked out on the band and called for its disbandment.
