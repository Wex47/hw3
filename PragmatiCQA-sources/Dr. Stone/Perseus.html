   The Perseus appears to be a modified
   , altered to fit a motor and require less crew. It has the traditional two square-rigged masts, with three sails set vertically on each. It lacks a gaff-rigged fore-and-aft sail, its position at the back of the ship replaced by a tower of exhaust pipes. There are two jibs at the front. The deck is flat the whole length of the ship, with a raised section towards the back for the comms room and exhaust pipes, and another raised section for the glass ceiling on the greenhouse. The very front has three short tiers upwards. At the back, it has a rudder and two propellers on the hull and the original motorboat ready to be deployed on cranes hanging off the deck.
  </p>
  <p key="d55e8138-4ead-4c2b-b3bc-1ee4523d745f">
   The bow of the ship is painted to look like a face, possibly a heavily-stylised version of Perseus himself acting as a figurehead. The ship is mostly made of wood with metal plating towards the front and angled panels along the bottom. The number of portholes on the main part of the ship varies between eight and ten, sometimes not being drawn at all, but the comms room usually has three.

Ryusui then stepped forward, saying he could build a 1:48 scale model of a motorised sailboat which could be scaled up and used as a reference for the big one. Kaseki and his team were then able to modify and finish the Perseus.

   The Perseus is built for speed and cargo, akin to merchant vessels, however the cargo is science and exploration equipment. It has antennae (radar and GPS) for communicating with Japan and searchlights installed on the two masts. Rather than going with the usual rope rigging design to orient the main sails, the front mast sits on a gear that can be rotated using the engine. In order to handle the extra stress on the mast, the base is heavily flared, however it is also hollow and has a door leading to stairwell inside. Within, it has several rooms with dedicated purposes. Starting from the front:

   Half a year later, Xeno and Senku create superalloy,
   inconel
   , and Senku finishes his liquid fuel. They test a rocket engine near the water and it works as intended, however it is only level 1. Xeno says they'll need a level 99 engine if they want to reach the moon. After the group in South America split into three teams, it was decided the third team will continue establishing new cities across the globe, starting by crossing the Atlantic using the new, improved, much faster, Perseus. They bid a quick farewell as Senku and the other set off across the ocean once more.
