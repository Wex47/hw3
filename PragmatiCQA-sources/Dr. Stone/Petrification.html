The light spread across the planet fairly quickly, and did not appear to be impeded by walls or cast shadows. The six members of the

   The cause of the petrification transformation on a cellular level is currently unknown, however the source of the ability to start the petrification of a body is by activating the petrification device. It is possible that there are other causes, as prior to the petrification of humans there was no mention of green light being seen around the petrified swallows. Additionally, only swallows and humans have been affected so there may be a connection between them.

   Those afflicted by the petrification can be depetrified ("revived") via two known methods: a combination of maintaining consciousness and being in contact with nitric acid
   or alternatively being given the

   was revealed to have used the same method.

   Broken statue pieces can be depetrified but doing so will result in a 'dead' part. This is fine for the bird feathers, however a completely separated arm for example will stay a gory severed arm after the revival fluid is applied. Despite this, if a statue is turned to rubble and reassembled correctly, the whole body can be revived in-tact.
   It is unknown what happens to the body if a statue is revived while missing a limb or other part.

  <p key="9c9d514e-c609-47df-8982-77753ef4e732">
   It is also possible to avoid petrification by submerging body parts in revival fluid, however the whole body must be submerged or risk the unprotected parts falling off. Splashing revival fluid onto the person during the process also stops it in its tracks.
  </p>
  <p key="edef693d-c716-48bc-a265-352277307a84">
   The depetrification process also sometimes results in fragments coming off the body.
   It appears to be due to the parts being too damaged to revert to organic parts, and sometimes pieces stay attached to the body until more revival fluid is applied directly, as was the case for

   's foot and Senku's neck. These pieces, when fixed, can also heal any injured part they cover.
   If the body has not been petrified for long, the depetrification does not leave any stone fragments behind.

  </h2>
  <p key="2316ce67-7e55-43e5-91e8-62ac70dc8116">
   Senku initially had three theories about what caused the petrification:
  </p>
  <ul key="2bf47489-9214-47a3-ab2b-510d8f07f5d4">
   <li key="78df21f2-55e8-4e7c-b434-2d68648a6ddf">
    Aliens with advanced technology.
   </li>
   <li key="7766c61f-f74b-44fe-ab61-67b2bdb0d5fb">
    A country trying to develop a weapon, which backfired.
   </li>
   <li key="4a73e796-69aa-4014-b1dc-977c55c08bf6">
    A new virus.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="2cc904de-8b52-47a8-a5f0-f363c84e5b8d">
   Since the discovery of the petrification device, the third theory has seems unlikely as a normal virus would take too long to change the body in any way. While the weapon theory is still viable, Senku comments that the device is "hyper-tech, beyond anything from the 21st century" and therefore may be outside the limits of any particular country's scientific capabilities.
   As it stands, Senku believes that the Why-man had something to do with it due to the radio signal. As Why-man's signal is coming from the moon, it leaves the alien idea more likely.

    The number of years of petrification can be estimated based on the thickness of the fragments of stone left behind after depetrification, with thicker fragments meaning more time.

    A cosmetic side effect seems to be that dyed hair can no longer return to normal, as Gen's half-white hair has persisted with no visible roots after over a year. Mirai's hair also sports a petrification scar which may prove that hair somehow gets healed in the depetrification process.

    It's possible to avoid full petrification by severing the afflicted limb before it can reach the rest of the body.
