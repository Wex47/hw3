   Senku and his adoptive father's relationship was complex but was overall a loving one.
  </p>
  <p key="feb5f098-bf67-426a-807e-46ba8a591b53">
   They got along, with Byakuya encouraging him to pursue his goals of science by not hesitating to sell his car in order to give Senku the opportunity to explore his scientific interest.
   In return, Senku helped Byakuya become an astronaut. Before going into space, a grateful Byakuya promised to bring his son back souvenirs, something that Senku was amused to see prior to the Petrification.
  </p>
  <p key="452caad3-0d17-491d-99af-4abbe5f610f2">
   In the thousands of years after the Petrification, Senku discovered that his father created the Ishigami Village and told tales of him in order for the stories to reach Senku after his release.
  </p>
  <p key="dde26b56-ef65-4a67-ba82-79dac473dd7b">
   Although Senku hardly shows affections, he secretly cared for his adoptive father and was sad that while he survived the Petrification, Byakuya died years later. Senku even shed tears at his father's grave however, he was pleased his father held such faith in him to restore the world. Despite not being related biologically, he acknowledges Byakuya as his father, since he raised and supported him.
  </p>
  <p key="0b81085a-7b17-4742-9317-f3080141e27d">
   He appears to think of him from time to time, as he was happy at hearing his voice on a recording. During the time on Treasure Island, he reflected on Byakuya being there with his comrades.
  </p>
  <p key="5f04ce58-f4f7-43b4-845b-5f1c649a8459">
   Above even their mutual love of science, discovery, and pushing the limits of humanity's potential, Senku and Byakuya shared a critical trait: their belief in fun being crucial to humanity in all its forms: music, manga, movies, games, literature, and more. The two were always smiling in the midst of a difficult venture and found the thrill of a challenge exhilarating. The ability to find the joy in even crucial tasks where lives were at stake was part of what allowed both of them to withstand the trials and tribulations they faced in their steps towards restoring civilization.

   Taiju and Senku have been friends since childhood. In the past, Senku was protected by Taiju from bullies. This led Senku to develop a deep sense of respect and trust towards Taiju, even though he is an airhead.
  </p>
  <p key="ae539c3e-ba6d-4150-a28f-f4aef28bb796">
   When Senku was depetrified, he did everything he could to survive, but admitted that he needed Taiju and his endurance to overcome the obstacles to come. Taiju was the first person that Senku revived and he later becomes a major part of Senku's plans to expand the

   While the two are pretty much polar opposites in pretty much every way, they are very similar in that they are both very resilient in the face of adversity. Taiju has an unconditional trust in Senku, despite not being able to understand the majority of his friend's plans, but manages to contribute with bouts of insight and his enormous strength of will.

   Yuzuriha and Senku are friends through Taiju. Senku knows how deeply Taiju loves Yuzuriha (and vice versa) while respecting his friend's love interest. Prior to the petrification, he was confident that Yuzuriha would accept Taiju's confession.
  </p>
  <p key="a602e48c-8cd5-42d5-8886-b52fb86c54aa">
   Once she revived, he wanted her and Taiju to escape from Tsukasa. He is even willing to sacrifice himself to protect her and gives the depetrification formula to Tsukasa
   In return, she tended to him and was the one who revived him from Tsukasa's attack. She agreed to his request to act as a spy on Tsukasa.

   Yuzuriha is one of the few people not put off by Senku's lecture or experimental tests, since she had experience with it.
   Furthermore, she was aware that he had an ulterior motive, when he was oddly nice to

   Kohaku sees Senku as a gentleman, when she watched him defend Yuzuriha and was rather impressed by him. She first sees him sacrificing himself to save Yuzuriha and since that moment, she admitted that she has been very interested in him. She leads him to the Ishigami Village where he meets all the other villagers. She does not trust in Senku at first but, over the course of their adventures, she accepts him and trusts him with very important things, like Ruri's life. Also, she may consider him a very close friend and even admits that she finds him physically attractive.
  </p>
  <p key="0eea9473-82b7-4de2-83ce-6263407874c0">
   In turn, Senku greatly relies on her due to her physical strength and skill as a fighter. She often helps him in his scientific endeavors by gathering material or lending her physical power. Though he enjoys teasing her by calling her lioness or gorilla (which she hates), he genuinely cares for her as a close ally and friend and trusts her abilities, as shown at Treasure Island, where he has her spy on the tribe by entering into the harem and the two manage to communicate their plans and deliver materials to each other in secret.

   At first, Senku and Chrome had a rivalry. Chrome proclaims himself to be a genius sorcerer and Senku claims to be a scientist. Chrome shows off his skill to impress Senku, Kohaku, Kinro and Ginro, but is completely overwhelmed when Senku reveals that he knows all of his tricks.
  </p>
  <p key="d32e57a5-84f3-49ab-b175-6b4279819974">
   Nonetheless, Senku is impressed by all the knowledge that Chrome has learned all by himself. In a way, he reminds Senku of himself. After a small duel between the two, Chrome loses to Senku and is quick to join his Kingdom of Science, being impressed and even fascinated by some of humanity's inventions.
   They then team up to overcome the challenges towards creating the cure-all for Ruri.
  </p>
  <p key="d02ae468-005c-4c25-9243-0dbdf767a99d">
   Chrome eventually assists Senku in many ways, including discovering the ore deposit that the Kingdom of Science needs for their campaign.
  </p>
  <p key="5461d430-e26a-4e80-97d8-83b48439cec9">
   Chrome quickly becomes one of Senku's main allies and a deeply loyal friend. He was willing to put his life on a line in order to look after Senku while collecting the sulfuric acid and expected the latter to do the same.

   They first met when Senku cooked ramen, he realizes Gen was a modern timer after he slipped in and mentioned cola. Originally sent by Tsukasa as a spy, he later defects to work with Senku. Realizing that he can revive science, Gen becomes one of Senku's most trusted retainers to manipulate others and advance Senku's plans. Senku himself has no problems with Gen being a turncoat and becomes close friends with him. As a gesture of good faith, Senku recreates Gen's favorite drink, cola.
  </p>
  <p key="16921d70-2854-4925-b19c-17894bdf1cda">
   The two are both intellectual equals, though Gen is more talented in the science of psychology and the art of manipulation and lacks in most fields of physical scientific knowledge. He assists Senku by manipulating people into following Senku's orders, facilitating cooperation, and helping Senku prepare for the bloodless war against Tsukasa. While Gen initially claims that he joined Senku's army for the benefits, he later admits that he had seen Senku write his liberation date and name on a stone, as he became fascinated with the person who could not only know the year and time they were de-petrified, but also swore to bring back science, telling Senku he already liked him a lot before they met. Gen even goes so far as to have the Ishigami village help him build a telescope for Senku's birthday, something that was greatly appreciated.
  </p>
  <p key="c11a54f8-e6ba-4b30-9659-c729f036bdb8">
   Senku himself greatly trusts Gen with his plans and the two enjoy scheming together, such as tricking Ryusui into buying lots of items, such as clothes and sportswear, so that they would have funds to buy oil from him. Gen is frequently amazed by Senku's inventions, often acting as the straight man to the many amazing scientific developments Senku accomplishes and holds great faith in him. In turn, Senku acknowledges Gen as not being completely devoid of a moral compass, despite Gen claiming to be the most shallow man he'll ever meet.

   Senku regards him as an enemy because of the latter wanting to put him and his friends into servitude. It was for that reason, he refused to hand over the revival formula. Senku holds a trump card over Xeno, as the latter believes Taiju is the scientist and is unaware of Senku but Senku notes the same advantage goes for Xeno who has an arsenal of weapons.

   Xeno and Senku met over the internet after Xeno saw Senku's theories on rocket science and decided to help him. The two met in person while Senku admired a monument of a ship, although it was silent both were aware who the other was.
   Regardless of their history, Xeno prioritize Senku's elimination, since he stood in the way of his plans but he survived in the end. Senku later spoke with his former mentor after the latter had his soldiers attack the Perseus and revealed he sent his best warrior after him too and Xeno captured by Tsukasa.

  <p key="7ad72cb7-bd8e-4729-a878-9bc09abfe364">
   Afterwards, Xeno is shocked to witness Senku and Ryusui arrive. He is shocked and amazed that his former pupil survived. He shares some words with his former apprentice, before Xeno tells him that he is already lost the battle because of Stanley commandeering the Perseus. While captured Xeno watches Senku negotiate with Brody and is greatly shocked when Senku reveals the ingredients to the revival formula.

   Although the two have not yet met face-to-face, Senku and Stanley are enemies.

  <p key="58012fb4-c362-44b5-9ccb-e334063beae8">
   They indirectly first met when the kingdom of science was attacked by Stanley on the lake when they enter America but using his quick wit, Senku brought down the soldier's plane. Stanley was impressed by this noting that the enemy had a science user like his side.

  <p key="96efcfc2-1400-401f-bf5a-6a641f9c7534">
   Stanley was tasked with assassinating Senku, nearly succeeding had the young scientist not create a bulletproof vest.

  <p key="93056b55-8f43-45a9-93ae-6d96574996d9">
   Stanley later expressed ire to learn of Senku's survival and he kidnapped Xeno. To make up for his failure, Stanley pursued Senku and his group to South America after they fled on a boat.
  </p>
  <p key="f3781236-c196-4f89-9d35-4cfc6042a08a">
   Before crossing to the Amazon rainforest, the pair narrowly met but Senku left on a motorcycle while taunting an infuriated Stanley with a smile.

   Stanley later ordered his unit to open fire on the science grade and leave no survivors in order to rescue Xeno. With most of its members laying dying, Senku was forced to utilize a last ditch effort by having his allies in America activate the petrification weapon and petrified a whole world. Stanley was shocked by this action and realize that the science brigade will revive soon and leave him petrified. Having come to respect Senku, Stanley simply took one last smoke and complemented the young scientist on his endeavors.

   Why-man is the nickname given to a mysterious individual who they received a Morse code message from. Senku believes them to be the individual responsible for the petrification incident, or at least related to it somehow. One of the reasons Senku has built the Perseus is to find out who Why-man is.

   According to Ukyo, they sound alike. Senku was intrigued by this, even more so to hear that this enigmatic foe is on the moon and resolves to pursue them for answers.

   Senku first met her when she came to the Perseus after claiming to have escaped Xeno. Knowing she was a spy and needing information, he welcomed her board the Perseus. The others knew this was a ploy after he secretly made his intentions known .
   To that end, he made no qualms of hiding his desire to know about the enemy and showing off his intelligence when he used science to make soft serve ice cream to tempt her. It was through her, that he recalled Xeno was his former mentor.
   However, she has slowly become suspicious of him after hearing of his association with Xeno. After Senku is wounded from the aftershock of the shot, Luna starting to tend to his wounds.

   Afterwards, she officially learns Senku is the scientist, while Senku asked her for helping him. Luna agreed to tend to his wounds but asked him to be her boyfriend, something that shocked him. Although Senku agreed, he likened the situation to a political marriage and seems more interested to the potential manpower she brings on the table, his friends speculate that he is using Luna to serve his own goals.
