   The island is mostly round in shape, with steep cliff shores and a central mountain, which gives most of the island a 30-45º incline. The island's maximum diameter is under 4km.
   There are a few round craters found on the island, the biggest being on the top of the mountain, possibly indicating volcanic activity. The island is covered in forest, with similar trees to the ones found on the mainland. Jasmine seems to grow abundantly on the island, along with at least one patch of bamboo. Several tiny villages can also be found around the island.

   docked in upon arrival. The bay's widest point is around 3 of the Perseus' length. It is surrounded by tall, steep cliffs on all sides, measuring between approximately half the height to the full height of the ship. There are a few rocky outcroppings and islets around the edges. Several meters beneath the surface of the water, the terrain is very craggy and is filled with petrified statues. It is deep enough to safely dock the Perseus.
   There is also a reef current flowing out toward the ocean.

   The Petrification Kingdom's central location is a giant tree upon which a small village is built. The

   lives in the topmost hut, a hut which is larger than the others and has a sun-shaped crown protruding out of the roof. Ibara,

   In order to get into the village, the tree can either be climbed from the roots or alternatively a bridge was constructed from a nearby ledge allowing quicker access. The walkways in the village are made of wooden planks that spiral around the branches of the tree between the houses. Several other slightly smaller trees have grown around the central one, allowing the village to expand somewhat. The location of the tree is on one of the few beaches of the island, between the ocean and a cliff face.

Larger vegetation does not seem to grow along a channel heading toward the mountain, only small grasses and lichen.

Part of the cliff seems to have split inwards, creating a sharp 'V' shape.
