   discovers that the device has a central core made of diamond.

  <p key="a44f91d5-b0da-4ccb-a68b-3eb5cff54792">
   In order to activate the device, a distance must be stated followed by a timing. The distance used is the maximum radius of the sphere of light, which must be in metres, and the time delay to activation in seconds or minutes. It then makes a 'whoom' (ブウウン) noise and glows, presumably to confirm that it's active. It can also be activated using a microphone and speaker combination.
   The voice command must be completed fully with no letters omitted otherwise the device will not activate (so saying "10 secs" would probably not work).
   It is unknown if other units of measurement may be used, or if the command can be inverted. Fractions of distances or timings have also not been attempted yet.
  </p>
  <p key="e023a6e0-8661-41c9-98e2-1f7274f8285f">
   Once activated, the device makes a 'k-chk' sound then emits a flash of light dubbed the 'petri-beam' that expands radially at a constant speed.
   Anything touched by the light will start to become petrified. The beam itself does not expand at the speed of light, and is possible to dodge if one moves quickly enough.
   Being in the shadow of the light also does not stop the beam, as it seems to wrap around any objects within the area regardless.
   It is unknown if the expansion speed is proportional to the magnitude of the radius or if the slower speed is simply due to the power source depleting.
  </p>
  <p key="0a3bb6a7-27f3-41fd-aa1b-83b17058d71e">
   When thrown and activated, the device stays fixed in space while releasing the beam, relative to the Earth as it doesn't go shooting off due to the Earth's rotation. The device also runs on some sort of limited energy source, (later revealed to be diamonds) as the accuracy of its total radius decreased after Ibara petrified the whole island.
   The largest known radius attempted is 12,800,000 metres, the diameter of the Earth.

   As Ukyo's statement, Medusa can be also utilized as a radar-absorbant hull, allowing Senku and his gang acquire a stealth ship by coating their hull with Medusa's fragments. When testing Medusa's radar absorbant capabilities in close range, neither Ukyo nor Leonard were able to pick anything off the radar, indicating Medusa was suitable not only as a weapon, but also as defense and stealth material. Because of this, the science group were able to create a stealth ship.

   Matsukaze
   tells the
   Kingdom of Science
   what happened during his time a few centuries back. A great number of petrification devices rained down from the sky above the island.
   Either from hearing the voice that seemed to accompany the devices or from trial and error, the inhabitants of Treasure Island figured out how to use them. Matsukaze's master realized that if the devices were allowed to be wielded, chaos would reign. As such, he ordered his men to find and destroy them.
  </p>
  <p key="a26edd8f-396e-4ef1-b0e0-b82287c403cc">
   With only one remaining, Matsukaze's master lay dying from a fatal injury, questioning why many were sent rather than only one big one. Matsukaze is petrified shortly afterwards, stating that only one device remains despite several being shown in the background. The image he carves onto himself does not appear to match the shown medusas very well, however he vows to tell future generations of their danger.
   This final device is presumably the one Ibara uses later.

   In the year 5741, Kirisame continued to use this as a weapon. When the Kingdom of Science arrived with the
   Perseus
   on the shores of Treasure Island, Kirisame used it to petrify the majority of the crew, with the exception of Senku,
   Gen
   ,
   Soyuz
   and
   Kohaku
   who were exploring,
   Suika
   who got kicked away by

   Ibara later orders Kirisame to use it again against Kohaku and Ginro after Kohaku started yelling about the truth of the state of the
   master
   of the
   Petrification Kingdom
   to try and shut her up. Kohaku's goal was trying to get Kirisame to use the device on her and Ginro, who got fatally stabbed, to save him. The inhabitants are also asked to shield their eyes "or else be turned to stone", presumably a measure to hide the existence of the device from them
  </p>
  <p key="ac71ce36-e27a-4838-9ef0-e9958635d7a6">
   Under Ibara's orders, Kirisame throws a fake petrification device during the first battle at Wavebreak Cliff to test Mozu's loyalty. Ibara kept the real device for himself, escaping to the Perseus.
  </p>
  <p key="15b3bd11-51a4-48f5-a877-c512b0bc95bb">
   Ibara then asks
   Oarashi
   to run the device to the center of the island, hoping to petrify all of the remaining invaders in one go. Kirisame argues with him, saying that not all of the islanders have finished evacuating yet and that the master told her that the device was never meant to be used over a large area. Realizing Kirisame is no longer on his side, Ibara petrifies her.
   Yo
   then shoots his hand, causing him to drop it into the ocean.
  </p>
  <p key="2fa7c748-1972-4d76-93b5-6d03daef1090">
   Yo retrieves the device from the ocean but doesn't know how to use it. Ibara jumps in after him and activates it while Yo was holding it, petrifying him.
   Oarashi dives overboard as well, and Ibara takes the opportunity to use him to petrify the whole island. He sets it for fifteen minutes, allowing Oarashi enough time to get to the middle of the island. The team realizes what's happened and
   Taiju
   tells everyone that Oarashi has the device and that he needs to be stopped. The islanders, confused as they don't know about the device, think that they need to protect him instead. It's revealed that Ibara forced Oarashi to swallow it, and with no means to stop it in time, the island gets petrified.
  </p>
  <p key="5212af46-6fb2-4901-b938-737735a00615">
   Ibara smashes Oarashi's body to retrieve the device from his stomach. He then finds the
   mobile lab
   , wherein Senku tries to use a microphone to activate it.
   The speaker is too far away for it to work, however Ibara throws it away from himself regardless. Senku snatches it up and tries to petrify Ibara, but his command is interrupted and thus doesn't activate it. Ibara grabs it back and chases Senku to Wavebreak Cliff, where he attempts to use it against Senku once more. Ryusui, freshly revived, uses the drone to snag it midair.
   A tug-of-war happens between the two sides, resulting in the device petrifying Ryusui as he attaches the earpiece. Senku then immediately afterward petrified Ibara after using the speaker.

   With Xeno captured, Stanley ties the petrification device to the prow of the ship. The members remaining on the captured Perseus pretend to be scared, causing enough of a diversion to allow the smaller ship to escape. Before it passes, however, Stanley shoots it several times, launching it high into the air above the ship.

   Sometime later,
   Homura Momiji
   free dives into the river, retrieving the device that sunk to the bottom. Bringing it to the American Colony, Nikki then discusses tinkering with the device so it can be used for healing any injured or sick people in the future. Internally, Nikki is aware Senku has a use for the device and cannot let the truth slip. Brody agrees, but thinks the timing of the request is suspicious and insists any fiddling they do with it is monitored. It's revealed that the members of the
   Kingdom of Science
   left in North America don't know they're heading for the source, hoping to find the original device. As they are unfamiliar with performing a proper diagnosis, they revived watchmaker
   Joel
   . Getting to work, Joel notes several things about the weapon: Joel was fascinated by its mechanics and described the circuitry is glass or mineral-like, and the core is a diamond.

   Once the diamond was re-created, Joel said the device was functional. At that point Dr. Brody and his soldiers immediately confiscated the device having become suspicious of the intentions of the Kingdom of Science. This resulted in a brawl for the device. Despite Dr. Brody's attempt to lock the device away, Joel was still able to activate it using Why-man's regularly timed broadcast, triggering the second global scale Petrification Event.

That it's possible for the petrification device to even nullify death. With this, humanity has secured a means of immortality.
