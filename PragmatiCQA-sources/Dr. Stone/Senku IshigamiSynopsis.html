   Ever since that moment, he had fallen in love with science and started fighting for his dream by reading many books and trying many different experiments and inventions. Overtime, with the help of his adoptive-father, Senku would gain the means he needed.

   Part of their experiments involved deploying light objects into orbit with a self-made rocket. The handicrafts club member, Yuzuriha, made knitted stuffed toys of herself, Senku, and Taiju. The rocket did not make it all the ways to outer space, but it shot the stuffed toys out into space.

   At age ten, he and Taiju conducted more experiments but failed. Senku then realized he needed professional help, so he sent an email to NASA and told him of his exploits. A scientist called
   Dr. Xeno
   replied and tells Senku what he would need to conduct his experiment. Senku and Taiju are stunned by the price and Senku decides to get the money. Senku flew out to America and met with his father who is overjoyed to see him again but becomes disappointed when it turns out that Senku takes his credit card and flies back to Japan. Senku then buys his item and starts experimenting. Sometime later, an older Senku decided that he has a lot to learn. To that end, he decides to travel to Africa to learn about Ebola while Taiju is shocked by his action. During his time there, Senku ate lion meat. Senku later visited his father at NASA, where he admired a monument of a ship before being approached by Xeno who silently stood next to him, both obviously knowing each other. An excited Byakuya greets his son and ask why he seems spaced out, as Senku watches Xeno walking away and Senku tells his father nothing.

   Prior to the petrification, Senku watched a televised report of Byakuya on his phone. He was amused when Byakuya told him on the live interview that he was going to bring him back space souvenirs. This would be the last time Senku ever saw his father.

   Senku first appears when Taiju declares that he is going to confess to Yuzuriha, Senku offers Taiju a "potion" he proclaims will give Taiju a ten billion percent chance of success. Taiju refuses it, saying he wants to confess and receive a genuine answer from Yuzuriha. Senku then reveals to the other classmate that the potion was actually made of gasoline and would kill Taiju if he drank it. However, he was ten billion percent sure that Taiju would have refused it. When his classmates begin making bets on how Yuzuriha will react to Taiju's confession, with all of them believing she will reject him, Senku bets ten thousand yen that Yuzuriha has feelings for Taiju as well.

   While petrified, Senku, who was still conscious, began to count the time of his petrification. Senku also planned to keep track of the season, so he could possibly revive before winter. At some point, his statue wound up in a cave, where the droplets freed him from his stone. Upon reviving, Senku has counted up to 117,354,893,870 seconds, meaning that he's been petrified for 3719 years and 249 days. Senku emerged on April 1, 5738, Stone Day. Senku marked the day on a tree outside the cave.

  <p key="d687c7f5-a424-4abc-9a38-5069fcb58fd4">
   Freed from his petrification, Senku begins to plan and build towards sustaining himself.
   After creating clothing and a makeshift house, Senku realized that he would need help in his ventures. That's when he came upon a petrified Taiju and decided to find a way to depetrify people. He tries theorizing what caused the initial petrification, choosing between an alien invasion, a human mistake or a new strain of virus. He concludes that the petrification targets only swallows and humans and that there has to be some logic behind it, no matter how much it resembles fiction. He then goes on to discuss how the revival works - pondering over whether he revived by his body being shifted into a cellular form since the petrified statues are completely made of stone, and whether the degraded surface of his body has to repair itself. He comes to a realization that since only the surface part of the statues degrades, it's the only part that turns into a stone shell and doesn't turn to a cellular form. He goes back to the spot where he was depetrified and discovers that nitric acid was the cause of his depetrification. Thus, he begins to test his theory out by applying nitric acid on petrified birds and Taiju, but to no avail. Senku states that the brain uses 400 calories a day to stay alive, which means something in the stone must have fueled enough energy for him to think for over 3700 years. He surmises that adding alcohol, which comprises of ethanol, will turn nitric acid into nital and might help with the depetrification. However, he didn't have any alcohol and didn't have the means to obtain it, thus he came to a dead end.  Knowing that Taiju might revive soon, he carved a message on the tree Yuzuriha was at and tells him to meet him. That's when Taiju depetrified on his own and met up with Senku.
  </p>
  <p key="e1bc7e38-c716-4d47-b4a7-fe0aeda48740">
   With Senku as the brain and Taiju as the brawn, they began to work together in order to survive and find a way to depetrify other people. That is when Taiju comes upon some wild grapes in the forest and suggests the idea of creating alcohol through the wild grapes. After creating alcohol using the wild grapes, Senku is ready to test out his theory on nitric acid and ethanol by testing it out on the petrified birds. To their surprise, nital is the

   As they attempt to depetrify Yuzuriha, they are attacked by lions and are forced to free the petrified
   Tsukasa
   , the strongest primate high-schooler. Upon being freed, Tsukasa displays his unbelievable level of adaptation and strength when he quickly understands the situation and proceeds to kill the leader of the lions with a single punch.

   While at their hideout, Senku begins to talk about his plans to revive humanity to the modern age through the four uses of calcium carbonate in seashells. But as Tsukasa begins to show displeasure about Senku's plan of reviving modern humanity
   , Senku decides to only reveal three of its uses, which are agriculture, architecture, and medicine. On their way to procure sea shells, Senku gradually begins to notice Tsukasa's desire to maintain the status quo as he destroys petrified statues of old people and suspects that Tsukasa will betray them.
  </p>
  <p key="efc6dc23-1935-49c9-9f80-6767d007ec3b">
   For precaution, Senku sends Tsukasa to procure more nitric acid as a ploy to buy them time on what to do. With Tsukasa leaving, Senku quickly tells Taiju to free Yuzuriha with the nital he procures. Afterwards, he explains to Taiju and the depetrified Yuzuriha that they only have two choices: either stand and fight Tsukasa or run.
   But before they can decide, they are stopped by Tsukasa, who intends to preserve a primitive world. Tsukasa believes that it would be better for humanity if the world remains primitive where nobody owns anything and everything is free for grabs. With his intentions clear, Tsukasa begins to attack Senku and the others in an attempt to force them to surrender. But with no idea what the formula for depetrification is, Tsukasa decides to retreat in order to give them time to surrender.

   With the time given to them, Senku tells Taiju and Yuzuriha to escape while making it seem like they ran between their tails. In truth, Senku already has a plan of defeating Tsukasa as he revealed the fourth use of calcium carbonate, which is for warfare. In other words, gunpowder. They quickly make their way to Hakone to procure sulfur and add it to the charcoal and saltpeter that they have in order to create gunpowder. As they begin to test their powder, Tsukasa, who was not fooled by their ploy, realizes what they're doing and comes after them.

  <p key="ea661cbf-b7a1-41ae-adc4-6c880b665692">
   At the summit where they test the gunpowder, Senku, Taiju and Yuzuriha notice a smoke signal confirming the presence of other humans. They want to send a signal fire back, but are aware that it will give away their position to Tsukasa, Finally, after some deliberation, Senku tells them to light up smoke signals themselves to establish contact with the unknown human.
  </p>
  <p key="905f6fc0-b904-4c14-bb8d-7ce1a5010c4c">
   Upon seeing the signal, Tsukasa catches up with them and takes Yuzuriha hostage. He bargains with Senku for the depetrification formula in exchange for Yuzuriha. Senku agrees and gives him the ingredients for the formula. Tsukasa then once more asks Senku to stop trying to advance humanity and join him for he did not want to kill
   Senku.
  </p>
  <p key="c749fd8d-101f-4962-a4b6-533aa939dbc8">
   Senku then declines, saying that that's the only thing he cannot do. Tsukasa understood, knowing he expected such and proclaims that had they met 3700 years ago, Senku might have been his first friend. With a heavy heart, Tsukasa breaks Senku's cervical plexus, which results in Senku dying.
  </p>
  <p key="cbd0381f-9ca4-4a65-b1d2-f2bf242fc18c">
   As Taiju returns from lighting the smoke signals, he witnesses an unconscious Senku on the floor with Yuzuriha in tears. Realizing what has happened, Taiju charges towards Tsukasa as he throws a boulder into the air. This distraction allows Yuzuriha to throw gunpowder on Tsukasa, which explodes when the boulder hits the ground and allows Yuzuriha and Taiju to escape with Senku.
   Tsukasa decides not to go after them knowing full well that Senku could not make a recovery in the stone world.

  <p key="e93c1641-e96e-4a25-9b44-eb0f86a567b9">
   As Yuzuriha and Taiju stop to examine Senku, they notice that part of Senku's neck is still petrified, which might have protected him from Tsukasa's blow. They quickly apply the depetrification formula to Senku's neck, hoping that he'll wake up.
   After crying out to Senku many times, Senku manages to return to his senses.
   From there, Senku asks Yuzuriha and Taiju to return to Tsukasa's empire as spies so that Senku can keep tabs on him. Thus, they part ways as Senku ventures out by himself to build his Kingdom of Science to combat Tsukasa.

   On his travel, Senku meets
   Kohaku
   , the person who lit up the smoke signals. She is defeated by Tsukasa and is underneath a tree, which renders her unable to move. Senku helps her lift the tree with the use of pulleys, which she thanks him for. She even goes as far to declaring a liking for Senku. Disturbed to hear a stranger's love confession, Senku voices his uninterest in the manner before Kohaku c clarifies that she means it in a platonic manner. She soon applauds him for his gallantry for sacrificing his life to save Yuzuriha, which she had earlier seen.
   She then asks Senku to come with her to her village because she was astounded by his science which she refers to as "sorcery." After talking to Kohaku, Senku realizes that Kohaku and her village are descendants of humans who were able to avoid the petrification 3700 years ago and have survived since then, meaning that they grew up not knowing the modern world.

  <p key="80766f33-32e5-4dfb-ba9c-34691b7af914">
   Upon arriving at the village, Senku is attacked by
   Kinro
   and
   Ginro
   , who suspect him of being an exile.
   After astounding them with his soap bubbles "sorcery," Senku is confronted by
   Chrome
   , the self proclaimed "sorcerer" of the village. Chrome challenges Senku to a sorcery battle with the stake being all his life gatherings and himself versus Senku kneeling before him and promising to never step foot near the village again. Chrome, of course, is utterly defeated by Senku and has to surrender everything to Senku.
  </p>
  <p key="286fdf61-0c76-41a3-9214-afef2ce1a27b">
   After examining the things that Chrome has, Senku decides to make Kinro a golden spear by dipping the edge of his spear with melted mercury mixed with gold dust. Though it has little effect in winning Kinro over, Ginro, who wants a silver spear to match his name, is convinced. Senku then explains to Chrome that everything Chrome has done is not sorcery, but science and that Chrome is the first scientist to have been born in the past 3700 years.
   Testament towards Tsukasa that no matter how much Tsukasa tries to hinder humanity's advancement, there will always be someone out there to challenge it and push it forward.
  </p>
  <p key="a7257e9b-69af-4b24-ad1b-16121d1fd53d">
   Soon after settling down, Kohaku reveals to Senku that her sister,
   Ruri
   , is sick and that Chrome has been trying to find a cure for her. Wanting to get the village to trust him more, Senku proclaims that he has a cure-all medicine that might work on Ruri. The cure he's talking about is antibiotics. He explains to them that they can either go towards the sulfa drug route or the penicillin blue mold route to make antibiotics. They decide to take the sulfur route due to it being more abundant in this era.
  </p>
  <p key="0567caf8-61d8-461c-b464-a8bbd85c6775">
   As they try to gather the ingredients to make antibiotics, Chrome points out that the earth is spinning. To Senku's surprise, he notices that the north star has shifted due to earth tilting after 3700 years, which leads Chrome to show Senku his magnetic rocks that act as compasses to point towards north. Realizing that they possess magnets, Senku asks them to use the magnets to gather iron from the river. Thus the Iron age has dawned once more on Earth.
  </p>
  <p key="906f38c2-f415-4b43-b692-44d00143af53">
   While gathering more iron at the river, they meet
   Suika
   , who was helping them secretly. She proclaims herself to be useless, but Senku deters her from thinking that way.
  </p>
  <p key="80aa863b-2536-41a6-a199-1c3852776c16">
   Senku tells Suika that her help is much appreciated and that everyone is welcome under his Kingdom of Science. Seeing Suika get swept away by Senku's words, Chrome references that Suika is Momotaro, a fictional children story of modern time. When asking why Chrome would know something that existed 3700 years ago, Chrome and Kohaku explain to Senku that it's a story that was told to them by Ruri, who is the priestess of the village. Senku then realizes that despite 3700 years passing, there are stories that are passed onto the next generations which piques his interest in Ruri. Upon hearing that Senku is interested in Ruri, Chrome blurts out his displeasure, revealing that he is in love with Ruri.
  </p>
  <p key="dc6d3246-99db-4d6d-b61b-adebe9e510dc">
   After gathering enough iron, the crew returns to the village outskirt so that Senku can prepare a furnace to melt the iron. In order to melt iron, they need to reach a temperature of 1500 degrees Celsius, which isn't possible by burning wood, which can only produce up to 700 degrees Celsius. Thus, they resort to adding more air to the fire in order to increase the temperature.
  </p>
  <p key="a5399f2c-bd02-4220-8377-6be61e830841">
   But due to the lack of manpower, they are unsuccessful in melting the iron. Needing more manpower, Senku asks Suika to infiltrate the village and find out what the villagers wants in order to bribe them into helping.
  </p>
  <p key="ec341e22-7926-4bae-ae1b-3a941a3dd852">
   After finding out that better tasting food can buy the help of the village, Senku asks the team to gather green foxtail to grind into flour and then make ramen. The plan is a success, which draws out many villagers to help Senku for ramen.

   But during their cooking section, they are intruded by
   Gen Asagiri
   , a modern-day mentalist who is currently working for Tsukasa. Tsukasa had sent Asagiri to make sure that Senku is truly dead, but with Senku now being able to produce iron, Asagiri is having second thoughts on supporting Tsukasa.
   He then asks Senku to give him a reason why he should support Senku's cause. Senku tells him that with the power of science, he will bring back electricity and the applications that go along with it.
   And with the metal melt with the effort of the village, Senku is able to build a mechanical electricity generator. Senku uses the manual-powered electricity generator to show the villagers light by conducting it through a roasted bamboo fiber.
  </p>
  <p key="e8fb4100-ccd7-47ba-874a-22632593f285">
   Just before Asagiri can make his decision, he is stabbed by
   Magma
   who mistakes Asagiri for Senku. The group find Gen, who Senku points out survived because he carried fake blood packs on his person. While being cured back to health by Senku and the others, Asagiri asks Senku if he's able to make a bottle of cola cause he's dying to drink one. Senku tells Asagiri that he is 10 billion percent sure he can make one. And with that promise, Asagiri returns to Tsukasa and lies to him that Senku is truly dead.

  <p key="56d63b8b-5026-4fc7-b241-359e7fa5848b">
   Having thought that he killed Senku, Magma proclaims himself the most powerful out of the villagers who will marry Ruri and take over the village as chief. This is when Chrome and Kohaku explain to Senku that the village is holding a tournament in a few months in order to decide the next chief. Since Ruri, the priestess of the village, has turned 18, she will have to marry the winner and become the new chief's bride. They then explain that Magma only has eyes on the chief seat and feels nothing for Ruri. Rather, he would prefer to let Ruri die once he becomes chief so he can do what he wants. Seeing this as an obstacle to his plan of saving Ruri and gaining the village's trust, Senku entrusts Kohaku with the task of defeating Magma while he and Chrome continue their mission on creating antibiotics. Kohaku confronts Chrome saying that he should be the one to marry Ruri since he loves her the most. But since Chrome is weak in combat, Kohaku has to resort to training Ginro and Kinro instead. Chrome replies that it doesn't matter to him as long as he can save Ruri's life and make her happy. And thus Chrome and Senku continue to work hard on making antibiotics.
  </p>
  <p key="f395754f-4359-41c0-9cf1-5f585d0e6634">
   In order to formulate antibiotics, Senku requires beakers and flasks, which can withstand acid. Thus, Senku decides that the next thing they should gather is sand, which contains silica used to make glass. With everyone's help, they are able to gather enough sand and produce their first glasses, which Senku uses to produce lenses in order to help Suika, who is revealed to be nearsighted.
   Afterwards, it is quickly discovered that Kinro too is nearsighted and is the root cause of why his fighting ability is so poor despite his talent. Yet, even after discovering that he can cure his sight with glasses, Kinro is too proud to ask Senku for help.
  </p>
  <p key="05b3ac2b-9579-4948-b6ad-6ec8b1024aa9">
   Although they now have the ability to make glass, without proper technique and experience, Senku and the others aren't able to create what they need. Thus, they resort to kidnapping
   <a href="Kaseki.html" key="0f199514-313c-4671-adc0-0b65d81cf441" title="Kaseki">
    Kaseki

   , the craftsman of the village. At first, Kaseki refuses to help. But after being peaked by the fact that Senku can produce glass and is angered at how wasteful and terrible Senku and the others are at making it, Kaseki reluctantly decides to help them. And with Kaseki's help, they are able to create the perfect lab for Senku to use. After seeing the lab, Senku can't help but reminisce about the time his father sold his car to buy him a lab.
  </p>
  <p key="886821fd-5275-4d7e-ba53-ecd6f5fc69cc">
   While in his lab, Senku is disturbed by Ginro and Kinro with Ginro proclaiming that since Senku has so much, surely he can make a silver spear for the two of them. Senku smiles and offers to make Ginro a silver spear, but only if Ginro is willing to help them find the hardest formula for antibiotics. Ginro agrees and thus Senku makes him a silver spear. But little did Ginro know that the silver spear Senku made for him is going to be used to detect a poison so deadly that it can kill a person within seconds.
  </p>
  <p key="1f3e9a8f-471f-4257-8f5e-661a93afea51">
   As they make their way to the top of the mountains, Senku warns Ginro that he best focus the point of his spear far ahead of him because once the silver on his spear turns black, that will signal his death. Senku then explains that the item they're going to procure is called sulfuric acid, which only exists at the top of the mountain in the Emerald Lake. But the Emerald Lake produces deadly poisonous gasses called hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. In order to detect the distance of the gas, Ginro's spear will be used because hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide will react with silver, turning it black.
  </p>
  <p key="e50278d0-efe7-4282-b0b4-a4fb784ab32d">
   After gauging the distance of the poison gas, Senku and the others return home in order to produce protective masks that can filter the poison. But upon making the masks, Senku tells Chrome to stay while Senku alone will go to procure the sulfuric acid. Chrome protests, saying he too will go with Senku. Senku then reminds Chrome that they are the only two scientists left in existence and one of them has to survive. Senku volunteers himself to go because he has a higher chance of getting the sulfuric acid unharmed due to his knowledge. Senku is ready to pass on his knowledge of science to Chrome before he leaves
   when Chrome outright refuses it. He tells Senku that two scientists on the job are better than one and that failure will not be an option, thus convincing Senku to let Chrome go with him.
  </p>
  <p key="1069c533-c5c1-4b38-a4dc-63dd46eea93b">
   At the Emerald Lake, Senku advises Chrome to remain calm as heavy breathing can cause the mask's filter to fail and can lead to his death. They approach the Emerald Lake, but acid spews out and burns part of Senku's mask tube. Chrome is able to warn Senku in time, but loses his step and almost falls into the Emerald Lake. Luckily, Ginro arrives in time with his own mask to save Chrome from falling. They are able to procure the sulfuric acid and return home.

With Senku's return, he, Chrome, and Ginro, along with Kohaku, decide to enter the tournament to procure the alcohol and to increase their odds of winning.
   Their goal is to weaken Magma before his fight with Kinro, which will give Kinro a bigger chance of winning. Unfortunate, Kinro and Magma end up paired for the first match.

   During the fight, Mantle gets caught trying to interfere and is told off, forcing Senku to dispose of his own various poisons, blades and arrows he was planning on throwing at the combatants.
   Before the second round begins, Kohaku is told Suika is in danger so she runs off to save her. Just before Kohaku returns, Magma orders Mantle to surrender the match, disqualifying Kohaku from the tournament and Senku wins by default.

  <p key="b8757a78-8bce-48f8-aa95-6c2b4bcf8def">
   The next match is between Senku and Ginro. It is obvious that Senku's plan worked. With Magma out of the picture, all they need to do now is throw the match for Chrome to win. But with Ruri proclaiming that she will dedicate her life to whoever wins, Ginro betrays Senku and starts to fight in order to win and become chief. Annoyed with his intentions and betrayal, Senku uses Suika's helmet that was laying around as leverage to knock the wind out of Ginro's crotch. Senku becomes the victor in the match.
  </p>
  <p key="425f640b-22ab-4559-a898-099c1b3986a1">
   With only Senku and Chrome as the contestants, Senku is determined to surrender for Chrome's happy ending. To Senku's surprise, Chrome falls unconscious during the match and Senku is declared the winner.
   Senku, who reluctantly  marries Ruri, is more than happy to accept the alcohol that is given to the winner. When the chief tells Senku that he is married to Ruri by right, Senku merely states that he wants a divorce and escapes to his lab to create the antibiotic.
  </p>
  <p key="c6d74dbf-462a-4d44-a8ba-9a8eafc80c81">
   Now with all the of the ingredients, Senku is in the process of going over the 25 steps in making antibiotics. Asagiri, who is just wasting around, is confronted by Kaseki and is forced to help out. With everyone's help, Senku is able to make the antibiotic and thanks everyone for the help. As for Asagiri, Senku is able to make a cola and leaves it for him as they promised.
  </p>
  <p key="6cfef92b-2e13-45c6-84e9-cc784eceaad5">
   Senku quickly enters the village and gives the antibiotics to Ruri. But instead of improving her situation, the antibiotic worsens her health, which the village chief scorns Senku for. But for Senku, it is a good thing because the symptoms that Ruri is now showing have paved the road to determine the sickness. Senku determines that Ruri has pneumonia. Senku suggests attacking the illness by using sulfa drugs, but Ruri's father rages in contrast, forbidding Senku from feeding his daughter anything else. That's when Chrome, Kohaku, Kaseki, Ginro, and Kinro voice their opinion and their support of Senku's action. Having so many people put their faith on Senku, Ruri's father concedes and Senku is able to cure Ruri.
  </p>
  <p key="4c1726bb-5cd1-4317-ae86-b66099372680">
   With Ruri cured, the village finally allows Senku into their ranks and proclaims him as their chief. To Senku's surprise, he finally learns that the village was named Ishigami, which is Senku's last name.

   Ruri approaches Senku, revealing that she has heard the story from her mother, the previous priestess, about Senku and his father Byakuya. This makes Senku realize that everyone in Ishigami Village are descendants of his adoptive father, who avoided the petrification because he went on a mission to outer space. This brings back Senku's memories of his adoptive father and how he helped his father become an astronaut. He explains to Chrome and Kohaku that the person who created the village that they are in was his father, Byakuya Ishigami.
  </p>
  <p key="26951ab5-aead-42c6-8693-b230dc3381bc">
   Once Kohaku realizes that the people in the village might be Senku's relatives, the latter assures her that Byakuya isn't his biological father but an adoptive one, as well as that they are hundreds of generations apart which means that even if they are related it wouldn't mean much. Ruri states that the final part of the last story of a hundred tales is a message for Senku and that only he should hear it.
  </p>
  <p key="b242958e-4890-4231-9b15-50319f551e3f">
   Senku comes to know that his father left him allies to support him once he depetrified, claiming that the souvenirs he promised to bring back to him come in form of people who pass the hundred tales. His father strongly believes in him, being certain that Senku will revive civilization even if he has to do it from scratch.

  <p key="e1e9bfaf-0add-49c2-ba40-2b89136fb048">
   Senku and Ruri eventually reach the founders' graveyard. Senku tells Ruri he will wander for a while, prompting Ruri to leave him alone. Being alone, he recalls his fond memories of his father and sheds a tear for him, saying that he is grateful for the "souvenirs" he's received.

   He hears Gen report that Tsukasa has revived a warrior called
   Hyoga
   , who is just as strong as Tsukasa. When Kinro is wounded by Hyoga, Senku teams up with Magma and Gen to make a bluff about having guns to chase off Hyoga by triggering a small gunpowder explosion in a steel pipe and synchronizing it with Magma's rock throw to make it look like a bullet has been fired. Staring down his foe, Senku is told that Tsukasa will be more than happy to know of his survival and weapon advancement, as Hyoga leaves the battlefield.
  </p>
  <p key="2eefe157-d14f-4210-96cc-eb453a96c807">
   Senku knows that Hyoga and his men will return after Gen talks them into attacking through a storm. Knowing that gunpowder won't be useful in rain, he decides to make something that will give him a better chance against them and creates new glasses for Kinro and Suika. Soon, he, Chrome, and Kaseki equip the Ishigami Village warriors with katanas.
   He also creates a small knife that he gives to Suika to give to Gen, which he uses to sabotage Hyoga's spear.

  <p key="82f019d7-6758-45dd-970d-34801da454c7">
   However, things go south when
   Homura
   sets the village on fire. He and Kohaku save Suika from the acid gas using gas masks, with Senku bluffing to Hyoga's men that he created it. To verify the claim that the poisonous gas exists, Hyoga pushes some of his men where the gas has accumulated which quickly kills them. With this, Hyoga concludes that a retreat is necessary and that the next time they come, they will come with the full force of Tsukasa's army. Gen worries about the incoming attack with the full force of the enemy's army, while Senku assures him with the option of a preemptive strike instead. He promises the Kingdom of Science a new invention that will allow them to do so.

   He tells the villagers that making the revival formula is relatively easy, except that they are missing nitric acid. As nitric acid is also a component in making gunpowder, Tsukasa will soon figure out that the deception of gunpowder won't work either. Senku explains that the enemy's army is growing with Gen confirming that the threat is only getting bigger whilst they are missing a critical source for gunpowder. As Kohaku enthusiastically declares agreeing with Senku on a preemptive strike, while Senku claims he will make a most powerful weapon in human history - a cellphone.
  </p>
  <p key="2c957b04-e576-4e98-b0ff-05d1c243fc3d">
   The scientist elaborates that by using communication technology, they could utilize espionage to gain more information on the opposing army's movements as well as convey information between themselves, thereby possibly even reducing casualties to 0 and decisively winning the war at the same time. When asked who can be the potential double agent in Tsukasa's empire, Senku mentions his friends Taiju and Yuzuriha who have already infiltrated it for a long time.
  </p>
  <p key="ca9f4c80-a94c-48a2-ad1f-75e9dc9b125d">
   Once the schematic on making a phone is made, a discouraged Gen laments on the amount of materials that need to be transformed and used to craft it, while Chrome and Kaseki are greatly excited to see the things needed to be made. Senku states that no matter how long the pathway to making it is, as long as rules are followed the outcome is a complete success.
   He briefly explains to Chrome and Kaskeki how the voice's small output of electricity is amplified by cellphone, creating electromagnetic waves which are then received on the other end. In order to make a cellphone, the first item that needs to be crafted is a cotton candy machine, much to Gen's shock. Senku goes on to tell that the centrifugal force spinning the material would force the tiny strands of sugar out of the small holes in the body. This same mechanism can be applied to making fine wires for the cellphone, in form of gold wires. As Chrome rushes to gather the gold necessary, Senku stops him, as they first need to test it out on cotton candy in case it's a failed device.
  </p>
  <p key="619c7bec-2a48-4333-a877-cd69f650457f">
   Senku gathers the hardened sake from the fire caused by Homura and boils it in order to acquire rock sugar. As Gen jokingly thanks Homura for starting a fire once cotton candy is made, the scientist asks Gen whether he knows of Homura's character. Ginro hears this and starts teasing Senku about liking petite girls, with Sapphire, Ruby, Garnet and Shovel leaning in to listen. Senku, however, states that the reason behind his question is being spied on by Homura. By observing them, Homura will know whether there's a major change in activity or an attempt at escaping.
  </p>
  <p key="c964a82f-95db-45d3-98ee-6afe92b2b5aa">
   Gen informs Senku that Homura is extremely loyal and has utmost respect for Hyoga, so the possibility of her defecting is slim to none. Senku in return offers some cotton candy for Homura which the latter eventually consumes. The scientist is hoping to goad Homura to his side by offering her sweets, which Gen praises. Ruri, however, thinks that Senku wanted to comfort Homura who's all by herself, despite the obvious strategic goal behind the gift of sweets.
   Senku warns the villagers that they have a few months before the onslaught of Tsukasa's forces. He is impressed by Gen's imitation of Tsukasa, who also agrees that the time interval is relatively short. As Kohaku and Chrome worry about Taiju and Yuzuriha's safety, Senku assures them that nothing will happen to them as they are most likely regarded as hostages. In order to stop Tsukasa, they will need to craft a cellphone by spring. Senku scolds Ginro for improperly spinning the cotton candy machine as Ginro is getting frustrated with the process. When the latter asks how they can be so calm even when having a short time interval to make a cellphone, Senku replies that he's being serious about cotton candy's flavor - Gen filling in that the imperfections in the cotton candy would mean imperfections in the gold wire that's planned to be made afterwards.
  </p>
  <p key="ab6654e4-4acf-4eca-8ac7-0641a4c475cf">
   Before utilizing the gold for wiring, they need to pin down the cause of imperfections first. It turns out that while Kinro and Ginro were spinning the machine, the rotational force was being decelerated while turning the opposite way, therefore creating the problem. The previously made generator doesn't go fast enough and a kilometer long rope is impractical for the brothers' endurance. Kokuyo adds that it's also a problem of resources, as the village cannot afford to waste all manpower on cellphone work since it needs to prepare for the winter. With little option left, Senku improvises by creating gears to ease the burden on the spinners. He notices that Kohaku's shield would serve as a perfect gear material while Kohaku agrees to use it, much to Kokuyo's shock.
  </p>
  <p key="6d271cdd-68b5-419a-91b6-27962be347bf">
   As it turns out, Chrome got an idea to make the waterwheel, and after 3 hardworking days, he returns with Kaseki to Senku to let him know of their new creation. After Senku witnesses the craft himself, he is pleasantly surprised that the two crafted it with little knowledge of the mechanism beforehand. Senku happily declares the end of age of manpower - and an arrival of automated machine power.
  </p>
  <p key="a526ad6d-11ee-4742-854e-add513c68345">
   Gen is amazed at the new invention, as Senku tells him the people he should praise are Chrome and Kaseki, who truly deserved it. Despite so, Senku states that the waterwheel is not yet complete, as the electricity is coming at a trickle. In order to story the electricity, the village will need batteries. The two lead plates are stored inside a small tank filled with sulfuric acid - Senku commenting on how easy it is to store electrical power while Chrome complains that the endeavor still took immense amounts of effort nonetheless. Senku then mentions that they will need 5 more batteries like these to connect them all.
  </p>
  <p key="02ec42c1-9872-4520-b487-9fca9b4f694b">
   Ginro realizes that since an automated source of power is made, he wouldn't need to spin the manual generator with his brother anymore. He inquires Senku and the latter confirms this, the both brothers greatly relieved to hear it. As Senku enthusiastically attempts to carve himself a gear, it breaks apart, much to his chagrin. Chrome and Kaseki join him once again, excited about the "back-and-forth" gear mechanism. The villagers celebrate the newfound automated generator.
  </p>
  <p key="a11c75b6-c990-4392-96b8-c327706d15af">
   Some time later, Gen approaches Senku to ask what the craftsman group is making. Senku replies that they are making a light bulb. However, as the gold wire reaches temperatures of 2000 degrees, it will start to melt - they need to reinforce the body with an adhesive. While making the bulb, it suddenly breaks apart. Chrome gets frustrated at the difficulty of making a light bulb, as Senku calls him out on his resolve.
  </p>
  <p key="ba6e5b49-4478-4a5a-b8b5-3e7820b18e8c">
   Kaseki makes a remark about how life has become more interesting ever since Senku came around, stating most villagers feel the same way. When asked by Chrome on what they are going to do about the wire burning out like last time they created light, Senku goads Chrome into coming up with an answer on his own - take away the air. Senku uses mercury's properties to create vacuum inside a light bulb, thereby preventing the wire from burning out. On Christmas, the group lights the tree with light bulbs they've created. As Kaseki reflects on the time it took to make light bulbs, Senku replies that everything is going according to the plan.
  </p>
  <p key="505ed508-3b9d-487e-a5e8-64c6f6820806">
   Gen realizes that today is Christmas as the former notices it as a mere coincidence, prompting Gen to call out Senku's intentional lying. Chrome gets another idea - now that they have light bulbs and batteries, they can further explore the caves they went into beforehand.
   In accordance to the future projects, Senku says that the group will require an additional heap of materials, which makes Chrome excited. To Kaseki's inquiry on what the next project is going to be, the former declares a new objective - to make a vacuum tube, an antecedent of the computer. To Gen's bewilderment on what this device actually is, Senku explains that it represents the "gear" in an electric sense, the heart of the cellphone.
  </p>
  <p key="bb174106-312a-4f71-98e2-46098f29bc77">
   The scientist goes on to elaborate to Kaseki that they will have to make a vaccum inside of it, just like they did with the light bulb. While attempting to do so, their glass vessel breaks; which Senku notes is from the expansion of the metal wires. The group is amazed with the amount of necessary precision required to make such a device, and manpower is set on trial and error in order to craft it. Chrome returns, now with an adequate amount of copper just in time for Senku to produce a copper tube. Since it's hollow, it won't be able to expand and break the vessel during the heat-up process of creating a vaccum space in it. However, another problem arises as the bamboo filament burns out. As the crew questions what material they should use next, Senku sadly states that such a resource does not exist in this era. After countless attempts of the villagers to find a proper material for the vacuum tube, Senku is woken up by Gen to watch the sunrise of the new year, much to his annoyance. Coincidentally, once the group gathers around the sunrise, Suika's newly found stone begins shining a beautiful blue color. Senku quickly realizes that Suika has found tungsten, an exceedingly rare metal that can withstand heat and would be ideal for the project they are making. He commends Chrome and Suika on their discovery, and picks Magma to be a mining partner for an additional trip to retrieve more tungsten, surprising everyone.
  </p>
  <p key="e7ecb287-1cbd-4c54-874c-2202a7a8547b">
   As they approach the cave, Senku comments on the lukewarm temperature allowing them to explore the cave better. A worried Chrome asks the former about his decision of bringing Magma to the cave exploration, noting that Magma is a dangerous individual who might seize the opportunity to attack him. Senku retorts that it's their only option, as even though the tungsten is situed in this cave, they would require Magma's strength to mine it. Chrome responds that Magma may very well push them in the rough terrain of the cave and escape with an excuse that it was an accident, thereby erasing science from the village and allowing Tsukasa to attack. Senku replies that Magma hasn't even thought that far ahead.
  </p>
  <p key="a3fd5ecb-52bc-4bfb-9f82-44a446da4f29">
   Further along the line, Senku abruptly stops, explaining that they came upon a rock called "mica". It's a rock of such brittle structure that it can break while stepping on it and send you to the hole, impressing Chrome who comments on the nature's traps. All of a sudden, Magma notices the floor under Senku slowly crumbling, and quickly reacts by pushing him away - only for the floor under the former to fall apart. Senku manages to grab Magma's arm, as Chrome warms him that he himself might fall with Magma as the rocks are starting to deteriorate. Chrome blames Magma for wanting to send Senku to a cave pit, which Magma plays along with. The latter plays along, saying that weak men like them became leaders, while it's rules of nature for the strong to rule and get women as it has always been. He claims that the strong rule the world in this age, stating that weaklings being able to take over the muscle in Senku's world is no more. He laments on the fact that if it weren't for Senku, he'd be the ruler of the village. Senku and Magma both fall into the hole during this exchange.
  </p>
  <p key="15d355d6-e7c3-4343-8e6b-29a8125ce184">
   As Senku moves around, an annoyed Magma orders him to stop shuffling around. The former responds that he's merely taking measurements of the cave, and that it's better to do so than screaming, falling into the pit and burying them alive, like Magma is doing. They are interrupted by Chrome who begins pouring in water, Senku warning Magma once again not to scream at Chrome as that will assure the rocks fall on them. Chrome explains that by pouring water, it will allow the duo to get out of the hole. Senku does an inner calculation, determining that they might just barely make it in the 6 hours necessary to fill the pit. The scientist tutors Chrome on making a tool for transferring water with Magma's help. To this, he explains to Magma that in the old world, the weaklings didn't "dominate" the strong, it was just a simple division of labor. In the old world, everyone was useful, and who the boss was didn't matter. As Magma is still very dissatisfied about losing the position of the village chief, Senku promises him amazing things humanity has conjured up which he would've never saw if it wasn't for him. As they fill the pit, Senku is showing signs of hypothermia. Chrome's anxiety is broken by Magma who propells Senku out of the hole, threatening to kill him if he's becoming boring. Senku confidently states science can never be boring.
  </p>
  <p key="22dc9c24-ac0b-4b8b-acaf-579380e93066">
   The scientist is grateful for Magma's absurd strength, as without it, they would need to hug each other to maintain warmth, disgusting both Chrome and Magma at the thought of it. He celebrates the group finding a large ore deposit, which has transformed into a collection of rare materials over the years. Senku states that without Magma, the collection of these materials would be impossible. Magma hurls the digging tools at the rock, reflecting on how easy it would be to eliminate both Chrome and Senku. The latter makes a remark about how Magma instinctively saved him, and wasn't actually trying to kill him. After the collection, an ecstatic Chrome notes how it's the bonds of friendship, not rocks, that were the most important thing made in this exploration, disgusting Magma and Senku who berate him on his awkwardness. Surprisingly, on their way back, Senku is blindfolded by Magma and taken back to the village, being greeted by Gen. He arrives at the conclusion that the village decided to trade Senku's life for their stability. Instead however, the entire thing is a ruse in order to gift an observatory to an unsuspecting scientist. Senku reacts rationally, saying that the telescope could assist them in battling Tsukasa, much to everyone's chagrin. Gen confesses that he came to know Senku's birthday after he wrote the day he was depetrified and told him the amount of days he's lived, the reasoning for remembering this is that he has liked Senku for his attributes from the start. The latter, although very glad, reacts with apparent "disgust" towards these emotions.
  </p>
  <p key="a38ffd34-88c8-4e79-a449-f8bd8af368e3">
   On Kohaku's question on how to extract tungsten from the rock, Senku says that it's the hard part in the process. The rocks are quickly smashed by Magma and Mantle, with Senku saying they needed to grind them to dust anyway. Surprised about Magma's behavior, Kokyuo asks Senku what happened in the cave - Senku is unsure how to answer. To remove debris off tungsten, they will have to use hydrogen, which involves heating it in a bottle. Senku scolds Kaseki and Chrome for being to hasty, as heating a bottle will simply melt it, so they have to use precision and melt only the metal. He motivates Chrome to think for himself, saying that him being his professor is needless, and is promptly annoyed by Gen not understanding the purification process. Senku is delighted to see the purified tungsten, but at the same time surprised by the huge material Kaseki and Chrome brought. Nevertheless, the equipment is more than enough to make the filament, as the group celebrates its creation.
   Senku, however, notes that it will take serious glasswork to integrate the entire project. The scientist begins delegating different tasks - such as making a powerful vacuum device for Kaseki, a gold wire for Suika and the kids, and crafting plastic to Chrome and himself. With combined effort of the village, the cell phone's body is finally complete.
  </p>
  <p key="a9bd6016-1dc1-4347-bdcc-b7b3f20f8e8f">
   With Senku creating the microphone with grilled seaweed and wine residue, the group is surprised at the ease it translates voice into electricity. This vigor is soon cut off by Senku who states they need another cellphone body like this, since just one part is useless without the other. The phone however, will still work as a landline if they stretch the cables over a long distance.

   After Ruri compares his phone to a bee and talks about a story about a bee talking with the dead, he and Gen realize she is talking about a record player. He discovers a time capsule containing a message from Byakuya.
   He explains how the record found in the capsule actually works, guessing that it was probably the astronauts who helped him make it, but Byakuya was likely the one who came up with it. With a bone needle, Senku plays the record to the rest of the village, much to their excitement. The speech becomes sentimental, although Byakuya stops himself knowing his son is not particularly fond of it. The latter goes on to show the group Lillian's singing to soothe their hearts in case the villagers are still awry of Senku's presence. With their amazement, Senku vows to show them all what humanity has made until the fateful day. Later on, Senku is approached by Gen in secrecy, who claims he has got an intriguing offer for him.

   During the voyage to Treasure Island, an unnamed villager comes forward and Senku is surprised that he never learned his name. The villager reveals he is
   Soyuz
   and tells them that he was actually from outside Ishigami Village, having drifted there when he was a baby. This revelation excites Senku who realizes the journey just got interesting.

   Senku then announces that there is another stone world human tribe, which is further confirmed when Ruri says in the 100 tales it said to head for Japan. Senku and Ryusui explain to the others that that some of the tribe left the island while the rest stayed to continue the human race, with Soyuz being descended from that group. Senku also explains the ones who made it to Japan are the ancestors of the current residents of Ishigami Village. Senku, Gen, and Kohaku then tell Soyuz that he has a place in the Kingdom of Science, to his relief. Senku and Ryusui soon tell the crew they will reach Treasure Island in a few hours before they along with Kaseki give Yuzuriha a lecture about the ship. Later, some members get seasick and Senku creates a medicine for them and tells the members if they are feeling better to get to work. After a long journey they finally reach the island.

After Soyuz announces that seeing the others petrified brought back traumatic memories, Senku was amazed to hear his memory but notes that the enemy having a device capable of petrifying them is just what they needed. The group created a microscope, they decide to befriend the female resident of the island to have a way of bringing down the enemy. Following the trail that the woman left they find her being proposed to by other men. This sight leaves Senku and the others confused by what they are seeing.

When Amaryllis takes note of Soyuz, she believed Soyuz to be the island leader because of a supposed resemblance. However, she soon notes that Senku might be the Head but is surprised when he is immune to her charms. Regardless, she leaves them when the members of her village starts to riot. Knowing they need her, the kingdom of science create teargas to stop the rampaging villagers. This display amazes Amaryllis who soon allies with them.

He soon states the mission requires help and Amaryllis questions where she can find a warrior girl to help, with Senku being shocked to realize Kohaku is the only candidate. He was worried about the plan because of her tomboyish nature and lack of etiquette.

   Knowing they would need to give her a makeover, they decided to retrieve the mobile lab. They come across the ship, where they find their enemies have already commandeered it. Senku sees the leader
   Ibara
   and one of his lieutenants
   Kirisame
   on board. When Kohaku nearly gives them away, Kirisame is alerted and attacks. Senku then watches Kohaku shout the word "Lab", he  realized that only someone from the Kingdom of Science would know that word and believe she was trying to find a survivor. Senku is then unimpressed when Kohaku kisses him after Gen makes up a scenario of them being on a date, which Kirisame falls for. Senku then tells Kohaku what she did was risky but hopes it worked.
   Thanks to Kohaku's code, they realize there are some who survived the attack, but Senku isn't pleased to find out Ginro survived, especially when he begs them for help. Nevertheless, he is happy to see Suika, who had stowed away on the ship, survive and the two reclaim the mobile lab.

   To help Kohaku, he created monkey retrievers that Soyuz and Suika returned with. He was amazed when he identified the sand as platinum, before he realized that his father collected it for decades. Senku smiled at his father's confidence in him before he and the others got to work

   The group constructed a makeshift lab in the cave and were able to successfully produce tubes of revival fluid. He and the others were horrified to watch the enemy soldiers dumping their petrified allies. After

   After Ibara petrifies the whole island, Senku notices a strategy launched by Chrome, giving Senku the idea to splash revival fluid on himself to avoid being petrified. He comes across Oarashi's statue but is unable to get the weapon before noticing Ibara approaching. Once Ibara obtains the device, Senku tries to use the recorder to activate a command for the device but fails. He then reveals himself before he has the mobile lab hit Ibara.

   Unfortunately, Ibara emerges unscathed and stabs Senku in the shoulder when he reaches for the Petrification Weapon. Desiring to finish Senku, he challenges him but the latter runs and Ibara pursues him and the two engage in a battle of wits once it is revealed Senku laid out traps. Ibara then corners Senku after calling his bluff, he asks Senku for his name and the latter tells him while Ibara wishes him farewell. However, because of an earlier ruse, Senku is aided by Ryusui (who had been revived when Ibara unknowingly shattered the formula on him) and he takes the weapon.

Senku then revives the man who is a warrior called
   Matsukaze

   When they reach San Francisco, Senku sees the statues of others lined up. Gen sadly discusses to Senku on his hope that the lie he fabricated for the fake
   Lillian
   had been true: that America had recovered from the petrification, or beaten it altogether. Despite this, Senku was pleased when Taiju got everyone happy with optimism, telling Minami that was his charm. Very soon, the crew of the Perseus separates with the warrior team following the exploration team in the case of an attack. While passing through the river, the group wonder about the corn since it's about the time where it would wither. Gen states America is vast and they may not find any, as Senku states they have a chance of being attack. Soon the Mobile lab is attacked by alligators something Gen chalks up to Senku's bad luck and the latter panics. However, he is in awe at the Warriors being eager for a challenge and driven by their hunger they attacked most of the beast well the rest flee in fear.

Xeno tells Taiju that his side has a clear technological advantage, with Senku telling the others Xeno has a factory that can produce mass amounts of ammunition. Taiju acts out that he knew this, as Xeno is none the wiser and Taiju's friends are impressed by his acting. Xeno makes them an offer to completely surrender and serve him since his manpower is lacking as he has no means to depetrify the statues. These words cause Ryusui to realize the enemy doesn't have revival fluid. Xeno also mentions that only those who have been aware during all 3,700 years can be revived with nitric acid alone, before questioning how he revived the statues thereby unintentionally confirming to the group he has no idea about the revival fluid. Taiju innocently attempted to answer Xeno's question about how to make the miracle formula, but he is stopped by Ryusui who along with Senku informs him they will simply crush the group once they have the manpower to do so. Senku states that they could have Corn City running with the formula. With this, Taiju rejects Xeno's offer and Xeno promptly ends the call. The group hear a noise and spot another plane, shocked the enemy had another one. The Perseus crew ask Senku on what they should do, as Senku states they'll battle the enemy in the sky with their new vessels. Senku announces to the crew that he and Kaseki are going to fix up the plane after building a runway for the Perseus.

   Senku soon passed out, while Luna and others tended to him.

   He wakes up to Luna tending to him, instructing Luna to hear his chest and determines that blood is pooling in his left lung. Senku orders her to remove the blood with a syringe and do transfusion with a crew member. Luna agrees but makes a request for him in exchange for her services. He denies it if she wants surrender but she tells him that he must become her boyfriend, much to Senku's shock. Senku presumably agreed to Luna's request because she later stated they were dating. Meanwhile, Ryusui and the others have gotten the aircraft carrier and plane ready, with a slowly recovered Senku acting his co-pilot. Senku is eager for the aerial battle between him and Stanley to commence.
  </p>
  <p key="71365750-7999-4ff3-b16c-5cedccec3aad">
   Senku and Ryusui set off, though Senku was bothered by the high altitude, he was amazed to see how far they reach. He assures Ryusui that while the plane was hastily put together, it will fly. They engage in an aerial battle with Stanley, hoping it ends with the enemy being scared by the fake machine gun. After a series of unorthodox methods, they trick Stanley and Senku notes the odds were in their favor.
  </p>
  <p key="c3a670cc-e05e-4fd4-9da2-d782e59ccf40">
   Using the same method of Acetylene gas that he used to bring down Stanley's first plane, he causes the engine to stalls. However, Senku and Ryusui's is also brought down after being by some of the gas. Ryusui and Senku survive the crash and tells Stanley to come out of the wreckage but it is not Stanley but rather a member of squad. Undaunted, Senku uses her communicator to send a transmission to the gloating Xeno, where he tells his former mentor that he was not the only one who sent his knight. Shocked, Xeno is then confronted by Tsukasa who holds him at swordpoint.
  </p>
  <p key="719036a4-c0e4-4124-8551-1fee86194a08">
   Chrome later contacts Senku to tell him that Xeno was captured.

  <p key="58862b6f-3969-4e29-a281-d54543f9310c">
   Afterwards, Senku and Ryusui journey to the enemy castle arriving to meet up with the others. Senku describes Xeno to the others, as the latter is shocked and amazed that his former pupil survived. Sharing some words with his former mentor about his survival, Senku promises to talk later. Xeno questions what his next move is with his allies captured. Soon Luna, François, Max arrive along with Kaseki. He congratulates Luna on sneaking away from the ship with her being flattered. Knowing the enemy will soon appear, they commandeer one of the enemy spare boat. They didn’t go over the few people in the American colonies that would not like to see blood shed. They soon realize the candidate is none other than Dr. Brody the mechanic of the colony. Senku speaks with him for a truce, Brody is uninterested until Senku offers him something he would like. To the shock of his allies he reveals the ingredients for the revival formula. He tells Brody that his crew will be more than willing to help him should they be guarantee safety.

   After escaping Stanley's grasps, Senku is confident on reaching South America while ignoring the panicking of his friends. As they sail, the crew ponder on what they will find in South America before Xeno reveals that he is aware of the Why-man and the signal coming from the moon, which surprises Senku and the others. Senku notes on how it was not odd Xeno noticed, becoming  excited as Xeno hopes that they can work together to figure out the course of the personification and they proceed to exchange information.

  <p key="4e47a299-ec56-487e-8be9-d8d7305d63f8">
   After realizing that it will take years for them to sail around the continent and with Stanley on their tail, the group decides the best bet is to scale across the the continent itself. Taking a break for supplies on the California coastline, they reach a deserted island. They soon learn they are not only when they discover a geographer called

  <p key="cb19f271-3485-40c5-831e-95b41b5e179d">
   After making her some glasses, Senku learns she is acquainted with Xeno as well as the fact that his research on the petrified birds brought her to NASA. Chelsea eagerly joins the team and tells them that the best way to get across the continent is via motorcycles, prompting Senku to create a roadmap in the steps needed to make one.
  </p>
  <p key="43fc4c51-fb5e-4694-9908-966cba1a6137">
   With Chelsea on board, they update Chelsea is on the recent events such as the Why-man, the plan to reach the moon, and the actions of Xeno. With this, she sides with the
   Kingdom of Science
   and joins them. Despite gaining a new ally, Senku and the others note that they still face a problem with Stanley and his men coming after them in the more faster Perseus. Ukyo even states it will not be much long. The group note that with their small ship, they could not make it very far but Chelsea remarks on how the wind helped her kites. Getting an idea, the group create sails made from Chelsea's kites. With this, Senku's group elude the enemy at a faster pace while Stanley and his group are infuriated the enemy continue to escape.
  </p>
  <p key="fb42dcea-7507-4954-b37d-8de8bc57b8d3">
   The crew, having found a way to avoid Stanley for the moment realize that they will be unable to keep this up and create the motorcycles unless they create a diversion.
  </p>
  <p key="b8e7b1e6-f13f-4f29-8423-40eab6b0bd2a">
   Arrived at the stopping point, Chelsea identifies Andes Range, or Mt. Tenno from Senku's gang. She also identify the snow on Japan, much to Chrome surprises and Hyoga's acknowledgement due to La Nina's effect.

   Senku and the gang invent scale to measure their weight. The main purpose the cyclist reconfiguration is to maintain the balance and power of the motorcycle during climbing uphill.

   The crew start to measure their height and weight, and once the measurements is completed, the gang sets out once more to scale Andes Range, or known as South American's Mt. Tenno. to reach the Amazon Forest.

   After The Kingdom of Science make their way into the amazon rainforest Stanley decides not to pursue them and instead makes his way to where they will exit. After creating rubber boots and animal repellent the crew make their way along rafts down the amazon river towards Manaus Chrome comes up with the idea of creating a timed way to use the revival fluid with Senku suggesting that the Why-man might anticipate this and create multiple pre-planned attacks with the petrification device.
  </p>
  <p key="ed809609-3924-4fa9-9a5d-57ecd1e2e3d1">
   After a while the crew start treking on foot to the source of the petrification, with Suika fishing out a medusa from the river, this stuns everyone until they realize that they are standing in front of a peterfication pyramid.

   Senku starts testing a handful of
   medusas

   the whole world. Dr. Xeno monologues about how beautiful it must have been, seeing the advanced weaponry activate, but it was just a distraction while he tried to pocket one of the devices. Gen notices his misdirection and points out what he did, making Chrome try and snatch it back from Xeno. Senku says it's fine since the device doesn't work anyways and states they can make use of Xeno's research abilities. With none of them working, Tsukasa begins smashing them apart so they can analyze their inner workings, something the group couldn't do before as there was only one device. Knowing they have little time, the science group start building a new ship, designed to be a Stealth ship so they can slip under the radar. But Ukyo tests the ship using the radar they have and states that "it's kinda hard to detect... for its size." Expecting to have to tweak it, Senku says they'll have to modify it, however Chrome points out that no one on Earth noticed the petrification devices raining down until it was too late. After running more tests, they realize that the devices are invisible to radar, potentially due to them absorbing the waves. Chrome then suggests that they just cover the boat in the devices rather than having to rebuild the boat. After covering the hull with several devices, the group are ready to sail. With their futuristic stealth ship built, they set off back down the river.

  <p key="753b012f-aa0a-4b85-aaa2-ebb5fd4a7a1b">
   After sailing a good length, Senku is pleased at the fact that they have so many spare Medusas to experiment with. He then goes on to say that once they have figured out how to re-activate them, he will use them against

   's gang.
   Ryusui
   enthusiastically chimes in by saying that victory is at their grasp. Senku asks
   Dr. Xeno
   if he can be trusted to study such a dangerous weapon, who responds that he would be at a disadvantage if he were to not study it. Xeno claims that he does not intend to share his findings once they start to analyze the Medusa. After looking at many Medusas, Xeno and Senku both come to the realization that every Medusa's diamond has been blackened. They aren't able to analyse the crystal structure clearly due to the charring. After over a thousand Medusas have been opened, Xeno claims that every single one has some sort of black pattern on it. Xeno says that the patterns are all different and are most likely there because of some sort of damage. Chrome notices a diamond that isn't black at all, and that since the diamond is the battery that maybe it's new. Kohaku finds a device with an unblackened diamond and tries to activate it. She whispers one meter three seconds, but there is no reaction. Ukyo claims that is might be some sort of dud, like an unexploded bomb. Examining it closer, Xeno notices cracks along the
   . Ryusui claims that all of the non-blackened ones have defects preventing them from activating: either too small, chipped, or cracked. Chrome and Senku then come to the conclusion that if they were to make a new diamond with no defects, it could power a Medusa. Senku immediately instructs the others in Corn City to create a diamond, relaying the instructions by Morse code. After they are surprised, Senku believes that you don't need a pro to do science, and says anyone can do it. Senku has told them the only thing they really need is methanol, which Nikki retrieves from Xeno's chamber. Senku tells them to heat the methanol a ton and they're done.
  </p>
  <p key="3641d731-c77d-4f59-9eff-1738309bcd28">
   After the group in America are done with the diamond, Senku tells them that next step is to dig up some natural diamonds. He also cuts off communication with the group in America, knowing they would be tracked by Stanley. Travelling via motorcycle, Senku states that the final battle will happen deep in the Amazon at the stone sanctuary.
  </p>
  <p key="ff06f1a9-4ff2-4c33-bbb9-a0e13800f074">
   Once in Araxa, Senku has the group build a fort and put up defenses while revealing that he is aware Xeno contacted Stanley, and that Stanley will be arriving ahead of schedule. He also reveals this is where they defeat Stanley and reclaim the Perseus, which is needed to travel the world. Senku also has Kaseki and Chrome work on the medusas because the battle plan against Stanley: requires one working device set up with several microphones around a single medusa, so that any member can activate the device and petrify the whole area. It also needs one member to be at a safe distance away to revive everyone once the medusa goes off.
  </p>
  <p key="401dfd4d-73b6-4e1a-bf06-eb9a4231c236">
   Working with Xeno, he and the latter hypothesize that the diamond lines may be channeling something, as the creases in the diamond follow the cleavage planes. With the new information, Kaseki's vigour is renewed and he continues his work while everyone else rushes to finish the fort. Senku then instructs Suika to revive everyone as she's skilled at hiding and it'll supposedly be safer. Francois joins Suika to ensure she has supplies.

  <p key="140e2160-4ea1-4553-a814-0a8f32b7a180">
   When Kohaku is alarmed, Senku reports Francois and Suika were captured by Stanley while revealing Francois likely bargained for their safety by telling the Americans where they were.

   Beneath the fort with Kaseki, Senku hears the commotion caused by Stanley's raid. However, they are having problems because the pair are watching the diamonds go up in flames, without having been able to repair the

  <p key="9838a6fd-0623-4be4-969a-7f8217fe94d8">
   Awaiting his fate, Senku shares one final conversation with Xeno and explains his philosophy of inventing. These words move Xeno who accepts defeat at Senku's hands. Petrified again, Senku immediately started counting to retain consciousness.

   Senku continued counting the seconds, before Suika was finally successful in creating nitric acid and revives Senku who was counting 236,109,753 seconds, over 7 years after everyone got petrified. Senku noticed Suika seems to have grown up a little in that time, as she apologized to Senku for taking too long to revive him but he is not bothered and congratulates her for her success. Overjoyed, Suika embraces Senku, happy at the reunion.
   Senku also praised her for choosing to revive him first, as he was now able to use one of the faster methods to create nitric acid at a rate of one per day. By the time they had made more alcohol, Senku had made sixteen doses, reviving all their allies. After they are all revived and clothed, the group celebrate and Senku tells Chrome that he retains his scars because of weathering. Gen notes Tsukasa is not present and Senku finds him by the water wheel, where they privately discuss how Hyoga definitely had died before being petrified, meaning the "Dr. Stone" method can even defy death. Senku therefore calls the petrification ring humanity's forbidden fruit.

   During the construction, Senku sorts out the new
   Perseus
   by stating because there is no oil in South America, they will instead use biofuel, to the dismay of Kohaku and Suika because it was poop. Senku also explained to Gen they will store the gas in a special metal sphere as their energy source. Half a year later, Xeno makes his superalloy,
   inconel
   , and Senku finishes his liquid fuel. They test a rocket engine near the water and it works as intended, however it is only level 1. Xeno says they'll need a level 99 engine if they want to reach the moon. The next day,
   Ryusui
   tells everyone they're splitting into three teams. Senku was placed on the third team that will continue establishing new cities across the globe. This group consisted of himself, Ryusui, Kaseki, Gen, Kohaku, Chelsea, Francois, and Chrome who would cross the Atlantic using the new, improved, much faster, Perseus. Senku also tells his friends within a week they will cross the ocean.
