   Their friends and family on the mainland rejoice when the Perseus returns to port, victorious and with the petrification device, however the device's power has been depleted from overuse. With the last remaining bit of power, they petrify Tsukasa and revive him, successfully restoring Tsukasa to full health. The others catch him up with what's happened since he was frozen, and Matsukaze spars with him. After the topic shifts to Senku's scars,

   When the Perseus arrives in San Francisco, everyone sees countless petrified statues. The mood turns somber as they had hoped that the lie Gen had fabricated about
   Lillian
   had been true: that America had recovered from the petrification, or beaten it altogether. They then split into a resource replenishment team, and a corn search team. On the way up the river, the corn search team are attacked by alligators, but then turn them into burgers. An ear of corn is found in the stomach of one of the bodies.

   Examining the plane reveals that the airfield it launched from is most likely a corn field, a smaller scouting group consisting of Gen, Kohaku, and Chrome head towards the direction the plane came from. On the route, Gen requests that he approaches their enemy alone, and gets himself captured by Stanley. Stanley pats him down, seeing that he's unarmed and thus not a threat, and leads him back to his base. There, he finds Dr. Xeno, who tests him using a lie-detector, which Gen passes easily. He tells Xeno that their scientist leader's name is Dr. Taiju, hoping to protect Senku's weak-ass.
  </p>
  <p key="9891d247-ee28-41dd-ac8a-0ab8bfdd8eec">
   Chrome and Kohaku call-in to inform everyone on the Perseus that Gen's been captured, and Senku tells them to not give too much away over the radio since the other team may be listening in. Xeno then calls and asks to speak with their leader, Dr. Taiju. Taiju takes on the role, and the team discover that Xeno doesn't have the revival formula. Taiju denies his request to give him the recipe.

   The group hear a noise and spot another plane, shocked the enemy had another one. Flying above the Perseus, Stanley has discovered the location of the crew's ship. The Perseus crew ask Senku about what they should do, as Senku states they'll battle the enemy in the sky with their new vessels. Senku announces to the crew that he and Kaseki are building a runway for the Perseus.

She feels conflicted, as Senku is more her type, and is given soft-serve ice cream to tempt her onto their side. The crew all enjoy the treat, and Luna comments that if her leader was around, he'd call the treat "elegant". Senku is particularly shocked, realizing the enemy scientist is Xeno, his former science mentor.

  <p key="069ccb8a-a18a-4853-bd86-3b02eeef0b0a">
   When Senku was a child, he'd sent emails across the world to help him build a rocket. One email reached Xeno at NASA, who decided to help him out at various points over the years. At some point, Senku visited Byakuya at NASA and happened to wait in the same location as Xeno.

   The night before the petrification event, Xeno and Senku were independently researching the stoned birds. The day of the event, Xeno, Stanley, and his unit were invited to a, emergency DARPA meeting to discuss a possible weapon used on the birds. Before they could do much, the petrification's light appeared on the horizon, petrifying all of them, but not before Stanley could tell everyone to try and stay awake. Thousands of years later, Xeno and Senku woke up on the same day.

  <p key="cc7dc5c8-15b2-4edc-879c-7366d79d8eeb">
   Xeno and the others had a head start on their revival, as several of them woke up within days of each other, and had the advantage of a platinum ring saved by Carlos. They built a castle and survived off the corn fields while Senku and Taiju had been inventing the revival fluid in Japan. Meanwhile in the present, Luna ponders Senku's past association with Xeno, attempting to eavesdrop on his conversation with the others. Despite having the opportunity, she struggles to signal to Stanley to shoot. Her weird actions alert Ryusui, who feels a bad omen. While the Kingdom realize they're being watched, Xeno figures out that the scientist isn't Taiju, but Senku.

   The crew is thrown into disarray after Ryusui alerted them to a sniper. Stanley is initially annoyed, particularly by Luna revealing his location, but realizes the target's logical actions would reveal them as well. Thinking quickly, Senku ducks for cover and crafts a makeshift bulletproof vest while Stanley confirms Xeno truly wants his pupil dead. He confirms.

With only one route out to sea, Senku ties the petrification device to the prow of the ship and everyone pretends they'll get petrified. Stanley focuses on shooting the device a safe distance away while the ship escapes. With a final farewell, the smaller ship heads to South America, the source of the petrification, with Stanley in hot pursuit.
