   Before boarding the rocket, Byakuya snatched the microphone from a news reporter and told Senku that he'd bring back some space souvenirs for him. Watching the scene on his phone, an amused Senku wishes his father luck.

   He is welcomed by the crewmates on the ISS before suddenly being interrupted by the kind-hearted pop star

   The crew are relieved, thankful they don't have to put up with a diva for the whole trip. Byakuya suggests putting her songs on as background music - to Lillian's embarrassment. The scene cuts to Lillian ending off a livestream to her fans, and she asks if anyone else wants to use the line. Byakuya tells her Senku is probably wrapped up in his own research or something. We then see Senku down on Earth, investigating the petrified birds being found all across the world.

   On the ISS, Byakuya bonds with his crewmates by playing with ramen. He offers some to Shamil, who declines, assuring him he's fine with his nutritional jelly. Byakuya tries to offer him some ramen and teases him enough to get him to try it. Suddenly, he freezes and looks out at Earth, as a bright light covers the world. Byakuya yells as he remembers Senku and the crew begin to get nervous and scared, realizing all communications are down across the planet.

   After the beam hit, Senku was suddenly turned to stone but he realizes his brain is still completely functional and begins to think. Back on the ISS, Byakuya uses the time stamps on tweets and posts to figure out where the light came from - South America. Byakuya prepares a mission to go to the surface. His crewmates suggests going as far away from the point of origin as possible, near Japan. Byakuya then realizes they don't have enough re-entry pods to go on his own - so the crew organize a suicide team of three.

  <p key="d6c35b84-e792-4668-ac04-3b5ee69c2a77">
   Byakuya attempts to go in the pod, but Shamil punches him in the gut - to his shock. He tells Byakuya it should only be loners that go, and Byakuya should stay safe on board. The scene switches to Senku counting how long it's been, and we see the re-entry pod reach the atmosphere. Once the pod reaches the surface, Shamil reports that they haven't got turned to stone. However - due to unguided re-entry - they had missed their destination and we're upside down in the water. The crew assures them they have five hours of oxygen left, but Shamil realizes this is as far as they go. Byakuya decides if they can reach a nearby island they can find a boat or make a raft to save them. His crewmate reminds him the margin of error is 10 km, but Byakuya says he's prepared to swim that far if that's what it takes. Back on the re-entry pod, Lillian begins to sing and rejoice. Shamil tells her to save oxygen but Lillian remarks they don't need it anymore. Suddenly, a sopping wet Byakuya appears in a boat and helps them out. Shamil smiles and calls him an idiot, but agrees "this high stake stuff" wasn't too bad.

   The crew station a practically uninhabited island, bar the owner of a lifeboat. They realize they are the last ones left on Earth and begin to get out survival supplies. We then skip forward three years, to see Shamil and one of the crew - Connie - getting married. Lillian begins to sing a song and remembers her childhood, before running off crying, with Byakuya following her. She explains how frustrating it is all the music is going to disappear - but Byakuya assures him one day, Senku will wake up and rebuild the world. He then explains he‘ll definitely need allies. The scene switches once more to the villagers standing ready to fight, and Senku breaking out of his petrification.

   Time passes, soon Connie falls ill with
   Darya Nikitina
   and
   Yakov Nikitin
   suggesting they get some antibiotics from the mainland but they are lost at sea and presumed dead. Connie passes away from her illness. A frustrated Shamil soon takes ill himself. On his deathbed, Shamil tells Byakuya he did have fun in the end. He thanks him for the ramen and tells him it was nice enough to make him smile. Byakuya refuses to let pneumonia take them out but Shamil passes too. In another flashback, Byakuya vows to rebuild humanity to a point where they can eat ramen in space again. Byakuya is drawing something in the sand with Lillian. It is revealed these are the 100 Tales, designed to teach the future descendants the basics of survival - how to catch food, etc. He then adds a message to the final story, telling Senku that he trusts him to rebuild humanity, with the help of the villagers.

   Senku explains to Chrome and Kohaku that the person who created the village that they are in was his father, Byakuya Ishigami. Kohaku wonders if this means the villagers are related to Senku but he tells that Byakuya was his adoptive father, therefore not blood relatives. Ruri takes Senku to Byakuya's grave to receive a message from Byakuya. He has her leave as he stands at his father's grave, where he sheds a tear. Senku thanks Byakuya for "the science souvenirs" (the villagers) and assures him he will help return humankind to where it was.

   Back at the village, Gen is talking about his cola with one of the villagers. He explains he can't drink because he has a message to pass on. At that moment, Senku returns, and asks him what's happened with Tsukasa. Gen smiles humorlessly and tells him that Tsukasa and his army are coming for them. Senku smirks and gets ready for battle.
