   In the year 5736, the Petrification Weapon was used by Kirisame and Moz against Amaryllis and her four friends to prevent them from fleeing the Island. Amaryllis managed to survive but with a grudge against her oppressors. Having learned the truth that the petrification was caused by a physical weapon, led her to concoct a plan to liberate the people of the island from its threat.

   After the fall of civilization, the vast majority of human creations succumbed to deterioration and were erased from the world. Some places such as Japan were overtaken by greenery, though climate changes brought by the disappearance of humans and thousands of years have also altered the landscape in other ways, for example, the whole world got colder, making snowy winters in Japan a common occurrence. The west of the Andes range in South America became more dry, and thus the Atacama desert, which formerly occupied the general area of south Peru, Bolivia and northern Chile has extended all the way to Ecuador. Due to geological processes, the land has also been greatly distorted. The topography of Japan is not very recognizable due to volcanic activity, and Treasure Island got larger due to volcanic eruptions.
  </p>
  <p key="c622bb43-019e-4bce-bb49-3a6f2b7f6783">
   When a surveying satellite was launched by the Kingdom of science, many other new features of the world were found in addition to the known ones. Large areas were flooded and became part of the ocean, most noticeably in the south of Africa and north of Brazil. The eruptions of volcanoes at Yellowstone reshaped large areas of north America. Australia gained more land to the north east by the sheer proliferation of coral reefs. The plains of China became wetlands with massive rivers, and the desert regions of Africa also became more humid, getting covered by forest and savannah. Although it wasn't the object of any observation by the characters, a land passage along the Bering strait seems to also have formed.
  </p>
  <p key="7d8eff1b-ace4-4ca2-97a5-4a411f7b897e">
   Traces of the civilization that existed before are few and far between but existing none the less. The Great Buddha of Kamakura was the first artifact uncovered in the series, and a large one at that. Its composition of mostly copper protected it from corrosion and also prevented vegetation from taking over its surroundings. Remains of concrete buildings such as

   are occasionally well preserved enough to be inhabited by people. Collapsed buildings can also be seen under water off the coast of North America.

  <p key="383fbf1d-f4ef-4427-a67e-cb6f724c0c2d">
   The Soyuz capsule in which half of the astronauts made landfall at Treasure Island also survived though greatly deteriorated. Inside it was filled with concrete, encasing some glass bottles containing the salvaged rare metals from the Soyuz capsule itself, and most importantly, the tiny grains of gold and platinum collected by Byakuya during the rest of his lifetime. Likewise, what was believed to be a headstone belonging to Byakuya's grave, which was brought over to japan and sat at the Ishigami Village cemetery, turned out to be another concrete time capsule containing a glass record wrapped in aluminum foil, with the voices of the astronauts and music by Lillian Weinberg.
  </p>
  <p key="92c05d7b-b00a-49e7-8c9f-1d8ce56a7ce3">
   In America, a platinum ring survived the entire time inside the statue of Carlos Barrios, who spat it out once depetrified, and was used as the catalyst in a Haber-Bosch plant at the American Colony.
  </p>
  <p key="c2c07411-fe13-49dd-9c4e-9206388abdc3">
   The Suez canal also inexplicably survived, being only blocked by a narrow dam-like structure made of old dead trees, which is believed to have formed naturally and was blown up with a cruise missile to reestablish the passage.
  </p>
  <p key="85b0cf37-c2af-4b66-8c99-c5bbf52966f8">
   Another notorious inexplicable artifact is the headband worn by Yuzuriha at the time of petrification. When Taiju came across her statue at the camphor tree, she was still wearing it in the same position, which assuming it was made of plastic, steel, cloth or a combination of those, would make it virtually impossible for it to survive more than even a few decades out in the open. However, since Senku got to her location long before Taiju did, it's possible, although unlikely, that he crafted a replacement headband to make her more recognizable and stand out among the foliage.

   On the way to Barcelona, the Kingdom of Science harvest and crush olives into liquid form and run it through a centrifuge, which Kaseki builds in a matter of seconds. Upon obtaining olive oil, Francois is moved almost to tears at the thought of how much the olive oil will improve the meals they create, and go onto create two dishe's for the Kingdom of Science, much to their enjoyment. Later, the Kingdom of Science revive the local petrified residents of Barcelona. Francois prepares an opening banquet for them and even shows off a little Spanish they were taught in South America.

Chrome begins to get chased by one of the wild bulls, with Kohaku stating he's being used as bait. Ryusui jumps at the opportunity and begins to bullfight, amazing most. Francois and local chefs later prepares churros, a sweet Spain is known to create, and Ryusui pays said chefs with coin

   , which they created from the ores in South America. The locals are amazed that in the stone world even with the scientific head start, they aren't trying to rule over them but rather intend to bring back the old world. The locals kneel down to the Kingdom of Science to thank them, but Ryusui has them stand, and rallies the locals up to work in exchange for compensation. With the locals agreeing to begin work, Ryusui exclaims his desire for fluorite.

   After obtaining fluorite in Barcelona, the crew made use of it's low reflecting index to create better a telescope. To do the calculations for the space rocket, Ryusui says they'll be going to India and founding Math City. The problem is the new Perseus goes through fuel faster than expected, so going the full route around the Cape of Good Hope will mean waiting for months before they can safely make the journey. Chrome suggests they make their way through the Suez Canal, however there's a risk it's blocked and they'll be left stranded. To avoid the risk of not being able to turn around in the canal, they use their new telescope and a hot air balloon to scan the route.
