    Robert Hayward Barlow
   </b>
   (May 18, 1918 – January 1 or 2, 1951
   ) was an American author, avant-garde poet, anthropologist and historian of early Mexico, and expert in the Nahuatl language. He was a correspondent and friend of horror writer

   and was appointed by Lovecraft the executor of his literary estate.
  </p>
  <p key="1934a3b6-67ee-4838-9481-c07c30101cb4">
   Born at a time when his father Lieutenant Colonel Everett Darius Barlow, was serving with the American Forces in France, Barlow spent much of his youth at Fort Benning, Georgia, where his father was stationed. Around 1932 Col. Barlow received a medical discharge and settled his wife (Sarah Barlow) and son in the small town of DeLand, Florida. Family difficulties later forced Robert H. Barlow to move to Washington, D.C., and Kansas. He received training at the Kansas City Art Institute and subsequently at San Francisco Junior College. He went to Mexico in 1940-41, studied at the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, and upon his return to California received the B.A. degree at the University of California in 1942. Returning to Mexico as a permanent resident, he joined the staff of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. In 1944 he received a Rockefeller Foundation and in 1946-48 a Guggenheim Fellowship. He became head of the Department of Anthropology at Mexico City College, which position he held at the time of his passing on January 2, 1951.

  <p key="3fd9832c-6fc1-46e1-b737-bb5346f0db75">
   According to fellow anthropologist Charles E. Dibble, "In the brief span of a decade, Barlow gave Middle American research an impetus and perspective of enduring consequence. His contributions in Mexican archaeology, classical and modern Nahuatl, Mexican colonial history, and what he preferred to call "Bilderhandschriften" are of lasting importance." Dibble compared Barlow's zeal for searching for and deciphering little known or dimly recalled codices and colonial manuscripts to that of Zelia Nuttall.

The two apparently became friends and Barlow entrusted the manuscript to Ripley before his suicide.

She died December 28, 1994 and the long-lost Lovecraft manuscript was found by Ripley's sister-in-law Lucille Shreve.

   Barlow was highly regarded as a sculptor, before his move into anthropology, and in one letter (to Clark Ashton Smith, 16 May 1937) he compained that people took it more seriously than his writings.  But it appears that none of his sculptural work has survived.

   Barlow moved permanently to Mexico around 1943, where he taught at several colleges, and in 1948 became chairman of the anthropology department at Mexico City College and a distinguished anthropologist of Indigenous Mesoamerican culture. He taught classes at Mexico City College, to mostly American students who were mostly there under funding from the post-war G.I. Bill.  The famous writer

   Barlow had written as early as 1944 that he had "a subtle feeling that my curious and uneasy life is not destined to prolong itself".
   He killed himself at his home in Azcapotzalco, D.F, Mexico, on the first or second of January, 1951, apparently fearing the exposure of his homosexuality by a disgruntled student.
   On that afternoon, he locked himself in his room, took twenty-six capsules of seconal, leaving pinned upon his door in Mayan pictographs "Do not disturb me. I want to sleep a long time."
