   Told from the first-person perspective of escape artist
   Harry Houdini
   , "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" is a fictionalized account of an encounter that he claims to have experienced while on vacation in
   Egypt
   in January 1910. Enlisting the services of a guide named Abdul Reis el Drogman, Houdini is taken on a tour of
   Cairo
   and eventually forced to break up a conflict between his guide and a Bedouin leader by the name of Ali Ziz. Drogman enlists Houdini to help him settle the fight by way of a "custom of great antiquity in Cairo":
   a boxing match atop the
   Great Pyramid of Giza
   . Houdini soon discovers, however, that the entire argument was merely a ruse designed to lure him into the desert at night and kidnap him. The escape artist is tied up, taken to an unknown location, and dropped down an extremely deep pit.
  </p>
  <p key="30608967-9248-4ca8-97d9-f5b7d3e4092f">
   After dreaming of spectacular horrors, Houdini awakens at the bottom of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following a foul-smelling draft. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern with giant pillars carved with heiroglyphs. Here he witnesses an parade of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitocris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature is merely the paw of a much larger deity, the Unknown God of the Dead, in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.

   , wanted to associate the popular Harry Houdini with the magazine in order to boost its readership. Following the introduction of an "Ask Houdini" column, as well as the publication of two short stories allegedly written by the escape artist, Henneberger sought out Lovecraft in February 1924 and commissioned him to write the tale of a supposedly true experience that Houdini had had in Egypt. Lovecraft was paid $100 to ghostwrite the story,
   at the time the largest sum he had ever been given as an advance. This was a major factor in motivating him to take the job
   as, after listening to Houdini's story and researching its background, Lovecraft concluded that the tale was completely fabricated and requested permission from Henneberger to take artistic license. After receiving clearance from the editor, he began his writing by spending considerable time researching the setting in books issued by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as by frequently visiting the museum's Egyptian exhibits.

   "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" has been cited as an early influence on Robert Bloch, which is particularly evident in his tale "Fane of the Black Pharaoh".
   The idea of a twist ending, where a terrible discovery is made worse by the realization that it is only part of a larger horror, was used again in "
   The Shunned House
   ", written later that year. In this tale, the protagonist digs into the cellar of the eponymous dwelling only to find that the thing he believed to be the monster of the tale is only the beast's elbow.
   The text of "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs", like many of Lovecraft's works, is in the public domain and can be accessed in several compilations of the author's work as well as on the Internet.
