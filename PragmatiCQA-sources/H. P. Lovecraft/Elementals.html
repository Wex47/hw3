    Elementals
   </b>
   are a concept from Medieval thought, and became a popular part of the belief systems of demonology, alchemy and ritual magic in the Renaissance era.

   in particular popularised them and wrote about them in the 16th Century. Elementals are living beings composed of one of the Classical Elements. The Classical Elements were theorised by the Ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles and defined as being Air, Earth, Water and Fire.

   Each of the four Empedoclean Elements has a corresponding type of Elemental: Sylphs for Air, Gnomes for Earth, Undines for Water and Salamanders for Fire.

   A later addition to the belief system of Elementals was the concept of Aether. This Element was one of the void or space, and as such was a fifth element. Various other fifth elements were "deduced" or adduced to explain inconsistencies caused by trying to force the four element classification system on to beings and creatures which did not fit.
