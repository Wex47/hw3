There were also several other universal-level events such as Infinity War and Infinity Crusade.

   The Prime Reality (Earth-616) is the mainstream reality of the Marvel Multiverse that is still expanding and currently contains billions of galaxies. It's existence is occasionally threatened by the super-genius superpowered Thanos the Mad Titan and sometimes by someone else (e.g. the Lovecraftian entity Dormammu) and on occasion its existence is threatened by an entity or faction from another reality. In this reality, during the late 20th century and so far in the early part of the 21st century, it is usually someone from Earth or an alien who favors Earth, who saves the universe or "known space". Most of the time it's either the Silver Surfer, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, or the X-Men (the latter three being from Earth).

   Shuma-Gorath

   Slorioth
