   gave birth to a son, Wilbur Whateley. The date of his birth is noted for the night before the hills rumbled and dogs barked incessantly. Dogs continued to show an instinctual hatred for him for the remainder of his life. Wilbur was immediately recognized for his hideousness, described as a "

   He displayed unnaturally rapid physical and mental development: At seven months he could walk unassisted and eleven months could speak. At four and a half, he appeared fifteen and he began to grow facial hair.

  <p key="a6ee07a1-628f-46be-b7ac-97f62c013e94">
   "Though he shared his mother's and grandfather's chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of..well-nigh preternatural intelligence,.. something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears."

   At a young age he takes to wearing very coversome clothes. He also has a revolting odor about his person, a defining characteristic of the

   . Wilbur's voice is distinctive for its "Strange, resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run of mankind's". This presumably allows him to speak the language of the Great Old Ones. At 15 years he had grown to 9 feet tall and showed no sign of stopping.

   Prior to his grandfather’s death he left him with the responsibility of raising his twin as well as ensuring he opens the gates to
   Yog-Sothoth
   . He could only accomplish this by finding the summoning ritual on page 751 of the

   , denied him access. He was then forced to return to Miskatonic University to steal their copy. This attempt ultimately proves his downfall, when a watchdog savagely kills him. It succeeded soley because Whateley's revolver failed to fire.

   It is then that several disturbing truths of his biology were revealed. In place of blood he had a greenish-yellow ichor. Yellow and black markings covered his back. From the waist down his body was covered in coarse black fur. A sort of rudimentary eye was positioned on each hip.

   His final words were the excerpt from the Necronomicon which he had been searching. Immediately afterward his corpse disintegrated into a sticky white mass, appearently having no true skeletal structure. Out the window a swarm of

   . His depiction in the film differs greatly from the story, in that he is depicted as a normal-looking human with none of the unnatural characteristics described in Lovecraft's tale, except that he does possess the supernatural ability to influence people's minds, particularly that of his intended victim, Nancy Wagner, whom he intends to impregnate with the child of Yog-Sothoth.
