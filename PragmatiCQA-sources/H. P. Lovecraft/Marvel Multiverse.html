   is a fictional multiverse created by
   Marvel Comics
   , which is inhabited by the
   Many-Angled Ones
   . It is the setting for two on-going on and off comic series published by Marvel Comics, the "What If?" series (1977+) and the "Exiles" series (2001+). It was also the stage for an epic cosmic horror story which was the "Time Runs Out" event published in 2014-2015, as well as the issues leading up to the event, mainly within New Avengers Vol 3 (issues 3-6, and 13-22 in 2013-2014).

   The Marvel Multiverse is an infinite one (per the One-Above-All, who rules the Multiverse), in which each action an individual takes creates a new reality, even something as simple as scratching your nose (as proven by Thanos and confirmed by the One-Above-All). In the early 21st century, Earth alone had billions of future timelines and the largest known multiversal temporal government (the Congress of Realities) had representatives from millions of realities. There have been a few known multiversal-level incidents which threatened the Marvel Multiverse or made changes to it, most recently when the Beyonders (a trio of omnipotent beings from a dimension beyond the Multiverse) nearly ended the Multiverse (the "Time Runs Out" event). It was destroyed at the end of the conflict but was later restored.

   The Marvel Multiverse is one of an unknown number of Multiverses that came up the Megaverse, which in turn is one of an unknown number of Megaverses that make up the Omniverse. Other Multiverses that are known to exist to the higher-level beings of the Marvel Multiverse include the DC Multiverse, the Transformers Multiverse, the Doctor Who Multiverse, and the Capcom Multiverse. Sometimes, there is interaction between the Multiverses which result in temporary new realities or permanent realities that come about due to the merging of a universe from each Multiverse.

Any world or universe which is conquered by them gradually decays and dies. One such universe was called the
