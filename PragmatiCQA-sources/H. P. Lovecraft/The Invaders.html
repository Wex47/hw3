    Cthulhu Mythos
   </a>
   short story by
   Henry Kuttner
   , writing under the pen name Keith Hammond. It was first published in the debut issue of
   Strange Stories
   , February 1939.

   The tale tells of writer Michael Hayward who accidentally unleashes monstrosities from a forgotten age upon the Earth.

   Hayward finds the formula for a narcotic drug in

   , creates the substance and begins taking it. It transpires that this drug is a "time drug" and it allows Hayward to read the akashic record and recover ancestral memories. Because he did not properly obey the instructions to use magical protections such as the
   Pnakotic
   pentagram, he exposed himself to the danger of the ‘the  dwellers in the Hidden World’ who now took notice of him.

  <p key="ea943b98-288e-4de5-9fed-696bd695e99b">
   Hayward uses the drug to help him prepare a manuscript, which read:

  <p key="28440233-1e8b-4b4e-aa62-97ab1fc414d5">
   "I dwelt in an archaic world. A world that had  been long forgotten when
   Atlantis
   and
   Cimmeria
   flourished, a world so  incredibly ancient that none of its records have ever come down through the  ages.

  <p key="fe86a723-7147-4fa7-822b-29d207293ed0">
   The first human race dwelt in primal

   Cthulhu

   Iod the Shining Hunter
   ,
   Vorvadoss
   of the Gray Gulf of  Yarnak.

  <p key="e06c5ee6-ce77-4378-9fc0-419618207954">
   And in those days there came to Earth certain  beings form another dimension of space, inhuman, monstrous creatures which  desired to wipe out all life from the planet. These beings planned to leave  their own dying world to colonize Earth, building their titanic cities on this  younger, more fruitful planet.
  </p>
  <p key="10be3e1a-c1bd-4dd7-89ce-f12ed933eeca">
   With their coming a tremendous conflict  sprang into being, in which the gods friendly to mankind were arrayed against  the hostile invaders. Foremost in that cyclopean battle, mightiest  of Earth’s gods, was the Flaming One, Vorvadoss of Bel-Yarnak, and I,  high priest of his cult, kindled"

   -there the manuscript ended.

  <p key="44c9812b-a3c4-498e-9e71-3cac19b73ead">
   The creatures from beyond, resembling gigantic eyeballs with small tentacles on their underside and a small puckered mouth, begin to mutate plants and animals surrounding his beachside house, and eventually even abduct one of his acquaintances, sending a misshapen wrecked undead version of the man back to Hayward, crawling along the beach. The entities then begin to directly impinge upon Earthly reality, the implication being they will mutate and overwhelm normal existence if not somehow stopped.
  </p>
  <p key="3ef481b4-54c1-438b-8889-3d386058093a">
   Eventually, Hayward successfully invokes
   Vorvadoss
   of
   Bel-Yarnak
   and the interdimensional creatures are banished once more.
