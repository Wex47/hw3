   The Shining Trapezohedron was a "crazy angled stone" created on the planet
   Yuggoth
   and brought to Earth by the
   Old Ones
   before the emergence of the human race. It was originally held by the

   serpent-men
   of Valusia, and eventually the first humans on
   Lemuria

   and the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, specifically

   . Occultist and archaeologist Enoch Bowen discovered it within a box of alien construction while exploring the ruins of the tomb of
   Nephren-Ka
   in 1843. Bowen returned to his home in

   The Shining Trapezohedron was researched by
   Robert Blake
   , who deciphered a number of ancient texts concerning the stone. He attempted to summon Yog-Sothoth with the stone, and saw him re-creating universes, but failed to do so. Following Blake's death, the stone was removed from the Starry Wisdom cult's sanctuary and thrown into Narragansett Bay by Dr.
   Ambrose Dexter
   . Unknown to Dexter, however, the constant darkness at the bottom of the bay ensured the Haunter of the Dark's perpetual freedom. For his trouble, Dexter was possessed by the Haunter, and eventually became one of the foremost nuclear scientists in the world, in charge of investigation of atomic energy for wartime purposes.
