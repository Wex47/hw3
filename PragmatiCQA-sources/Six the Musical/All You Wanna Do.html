   The song is a depiction of Katherine's life beginning at the age of 13, leading up to her time as queen and her beheading. It tells of how she was taken advantage of and sexually abused by several men at a young age when all she ever wanted was a friend.

       </b>
       (spoken)
        Take my first music teacher, Henry Mannox
        (sung)
        I was young, it's true, but even then I knew
        The only thing you wanna do is
        Broad, dark, sexy Mannox
        Taught me all about dynamics
        He was twenty-three
        And I was thirteen, going on thirty
        We spent hours strumming the lute
        Striking the chords and blowing the flute
        He plucked my strings all the way to G
        Went from major to minor, C to D
        Tell me what you need
        What you want, you don't need to plead
        'Cause I feel the chemistry
        Like I get you and you get me
        And maybe this is it
        He just cares so much, it feels legit
        We have a connection
        I think this guy is different, 'cause
        All you wanna do
        All you wanna do, babe, is
        Touch me, love me
        Can't get enough, see
        All you wanna do
        All you wanna do, babe, is
        Please me, squeeze me
        Birds and the bees me
        Run your fingers through my hair
        Tell me I'm the fairest of the fair
        Playtime's over
        The only thing you wanna do is
        (spoken)
        But then there was another guy
        Francis Dereham
        (sung)
        Serious, stern, and slow
        Gets what he wants and he won't take no
        Passion in all that he touches
        The sexy secretary to the dowager duchess
        Helped him in his office, had a duty to fulfill
        He even let me use his favourite quill
        Spilled ink all over the parchment, my wrist was so tired
        Still, I came back the next day as he required
        You say I'm all you need
        All you want, you don't need to plead
        'Cause I feel the chemistry
        Like I get you and you get me
        And I know this is it
        He just cares so much, this one's legit
        We have a real connection
        I'm sure this time is different, 'cause
        All you wanna do
        All you wanna do, babe, is
        Touch me, love me
        Can't get enough, see
        All you wanna do
        All you wanna do, babe, is
        Please me, squeeze me
        Birds and the bees me
        You can't wait a second more
        To get my corset on the floor
        Playtime's over
        The only thing you wanna do is
        (spoken)
        Yeah, that didn't work out
        So I decided to have a break from boys
        And you'll never guess who I met
        (sung)
        Tall, large, Henry VIII
        Supreme head of the Church of England
        Globally revered
        Although you wouldn't know it from the look of that beard
        Made me a lady in waiting, hurled
        Me and my family up in the world
        Gave me duties in court and he swears it's true
        That without me, he doesn't know what he'd do
        You say I'm what you need
        All you want, we both agree
        This is the place for me
        I'm finally where I'm meant to be
        Then he starts saying all this stuff
        He cares so much, he calls me "love"
        He says we have this connection
        I guess it's not so different, 'cause
        All you wanna do
        All you wanna do, babe, is
        Touch me, love me
        Can't get enough, see
        All you wanna do
        All you wanna do, babe, is
        Seize me, squeeze me
        Birds and the bees me
        There's no time for when or how
        'Cause you just got to have me now
        Playtime's over
        The only thing you wanna do is
        (spoken)
        So we got married
        Woo
        (sung)
        With Henry, it isn't easy
        His temper's short and his mates are sleazy
        Except for this one courtier
        He's a really nice guy, just so sincere
        The royal life isn't what I planned
        But Thomas is there to lend a helping hand
        So sweet, makes sure that I'm okay
        And we hang out loads when the king's away
        This guy, finally
        Is what I want, the friend I need
        Just mates, no chemistry
        I get him and he gets me
        And there's nothing more to it
        He just cares so much, he's devoted
        He says we have a connection
        I thought this time was different
        Why did I think he'd be different?
        But it's never, ever different, 'cause
        All you wanna do
        All you wanna do, babe, is
        Touch me, when will enough be enough, see?
        All you wanna do
        All you wanna do, babe, is
        Squeeze me, don't care if you don't please me
        Bite my lip and pull my hair
        As you tell me I'm the fairest of the fair

       (spoken)
       I think we can all agree
       I'm the ten amongst these threes
       (sung)
       I know that all you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Touch me, love me
       Can't get enough, see
       All you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Please me, squeeze me
       Birds and the bees me
       Run your fingers through my hair
       Tell me I'm the fairest of the fair
       Playtime's over
       The only thing you wanna do is
       (spoken)
       So if you're wondering where my amazing musicality comes from
       I had this music teacher, Henry Mannox
       And I really learned a lot from him
       (sung)
       Tall, dark, Henry Mannox
       Taught me all about dynamics
       He was twenty-three
       And I was thirteen, going on thirty
       We spent hours strumming the lute
       Striking the chords and blowing the flute
       He plucked my strings all the way to G
       Went from major to minor, C to D
       Tell me what you need
       What you want, you don't need to plead
       'Cause I feel the chemistry
       I get you and you get me
       And maybe this is it
       He just cares so much, it feels legit
       We have a connection
       I think this guy is different
       And all you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Touch me, love me
       Can't get enough, see
       All you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Please me, squeeze me
       Birds and the bees me
       Run your fingers through my hair
       Tell me I'm the fairest of the fair
       Playtime's over
       The only thing you wanna do is
       (spoken)
       So then there was this other guy, Francis Dereham
       He worked with my aunt
       And I was his little piece of ass-istant
       (sung)
       Serious, stern, and slow
       Gets what he wants and he won't take no
       Passion in all that he touches
       The sexy secretary to the dowager duchess
       I helped him in his office, had a duty to fulfill
       He even let me use his favourite quill
       Spilled ink all over the parchment, my wrist was so tired
       Still, I came back the next day as he required
       And you say I'm all you need
       All you want, you don't need to plead
       'Cause I feel the chemistry
       I get you and you get me
       And I know this is it
       He just cares so much, it feels legit
       We have a real connection
       I know this time is different
       And all you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Touch me, love me
       Can't get enough, see
       All you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Please me, squeeze me
       Birds and the bees me
       Rip off my lacy garms
       Hold me tight inside your arms
       And playtime's over
       The only thing you wanna do is
       (spoken)
       So yeah, that didn't work out
       And I decided to have a break from guys and focus on my career
       And you’ll never guess who I met
       (sung)
       Tall, large, Henry VIII
       Supreme head of the Church of England
       Globally revered
       And I guess he's got a pretty nice beard
       Made me a lady in waiting, hurled
       Me and my family up in the world
       Gave me duties in court, yeah, only a few
       But without me, he doesn't know what he'd do
       And you say I'm what you need
       All you want, yeah, we both agree
       That this is the place for me
       I'm finally where I'm meant to be
       Then he starts saying all this stuff
       He just cares so much, he calls me "love"
       He says we have a connection
       I guess it's not so different, 'cause
       All you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Touch me, love me
       Can't get enough, see
       All you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Please me, squeeze me
       Grab hold of these, please
       You can't wait a second more
       To get my corset on the floor
       And playtime's over
       The only thing you wanna do is
       (spoken)
       So we got married
       Woo
       (sung)
       With Henry, it isn't easy
       His temper's short and his mates are sleazy
       Except for this one courtier
       He's a really nice guy, just so sincere
       The royal life isn't what I planned
       But I know he's there to lend a helping hand
       So sweet, makes sure that I'm okay
       Then we hang out loads when the king's away
       This guy, finally
       Is what I want, the friend I need
       Just mates, no chemistry
       I get him and he gets me
       And there's nothing more to it
       He just cares so much, he's devoted
       He says we have a connection
       I thought this time was different
       Why did I think he'd be different?
       But it's never, ever different, 'cause
       All you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Touch me, when will enough be enough, see?
       All you wanna do
       All you wanna do, babe, is
       Squeeze me, don't care if you don't please me
       Bite my lip and pull my hair
       As you tell me I'm the fairest of the fair
       Playtime's over

    In live performances, there is dialogue leading into each verse, temporarily pausing the song each time.

      While some of these bits are present in the cast recording, they are shortened and therefore do not contain the full lines.

    In the 2017 Arts Theatre production, the other actresses wore masks while the song was being sung.

   <li key="d20593c4-e85c-453c-a216-43d1d01fb233">
    While Katherine says during the song that Mannox was 23 when he became involved with her, his actual age is unknown, with estimates ranging from 21 to 36. Likewise, as Katherine's exact date of birth is unknown, it is possible that she was younger than 13 when the "relationship" began.
   </li>
   <li key="d81d8d21-4a14-44ab-a0fb-2df200fc40e8">
    In the second chorus of the song, Katherine mentions wearing a corset; this is anachronistic as the corset did not become a common article of clothing until roughly 50 years after her death.
