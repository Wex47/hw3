   The song begins with Catherine writing a letter to her love,

    Henry VIII
   </a>
   has decided that he wishes to marry her. Catherine laments about how she is forced to marry Henry, as to refuse a proposal from the king was dangerous and unheard of at the time. She explains how if she had a choice, she would tell Henry off, saying that she doesn't need his love. Catherine then closes off the letter, stating "This is goodbye, all my love, Catherine". She mentions how she sent the letter to Thomas, married Henry, and became "the one who survived" due to outliving him.

  <p key="e14fae50-912f-44c5-8d8c-69f75f02760b">
   However, Catherine then questions why she should have to sing about her life with Henry when she has completed many amazing accomplishments of her own, such as becoming a writer and fighting for female education. She says that she is unable to tell her own story because in history, she is just one of six women that the king decided to marry, and that without Henry they would never have been remembered at all.

   singing that they're "taking back the microphone", meaning that it's their turn to tell their stories. The song concludes with the queens telling Henry that they don't need his love and that they are in control of their narrative from now on.

       You know I love you, boy
        In every single way
        Though I love you, boy
        I'll miss you every day
        Oh, I love you, boy
        I wish that I could stay with you
        And keep the life I made with you
        And even though this feels so right
        I'm holding back the tears tonight
        It's true, I'll never be over you
        'Cause I have built a future in my mind with you
        And now the hope is gone, there's nothing left for me to do
        You know it isn't true, but I must say to you
        That I don't need your love, no, no
        I don't need your love, no, no
        It'll never be better than it was, no, no
        But I don't need your love, no, no
        I've got no choice
        With the king, I stay alive
        Never had a choice
        Been a wife twice before
        Just to survive
        I don't have a choice
        If Henry says "it's you", then it's you
        No matter how I feel, it's what I have to do
        But if, somehow, I had that choice
        No holding back, I'd raise my voice
        I'd say, "Henry, yeah, it's true
        I'll never belong to you
        'Cause I am not your toy to enjoy
        'Til there's something new
        As if I'm gonna give up my boy, my work, my dreams
        To care for you
        Ha! Darling, get a clue
        There's nothing you can do
        I don't need your love, no, no
        No, I don't need your love, no, no
        There's nothing left to discuss, no, no
        But I don't need your love, no, no"
        But I can't say that
        Not to the king
        So this is goodbye
        All my love, Catherine
        So I sent that letter to my love
        Got married to the king
        Became the one who survived
        I've told you about my life, the final wife
        But why should that story be the one I have to sing about
        Just to win? I'm out
        That's not my story
        There's so much more
        Remember that I was a writer
        I wrote books, and psalms, and meditations
        Fought for female education
        So all my women can independently
        Study scripture
        I even got a woman to paint my picture
        Why can't I tell that story?
        'Cause in history
        I'm fixed as one of six
        And without him
        I disappear
        We all disappear

       They always said we need your love
        But it's time for us to rise above
        It's not what went down in history
        But tonight I'm singing this for me
        Henry, yeah, I'm through
        Too many times it's been told
        And I have had enough (I have had enough)
        Love stories to get old
        And you might think it's tough
        But I've got to let your love run cold
        We're taking back control (we're taking back control)
        You need to know
        I don't need your love, no, no (hey, ha ha ha ha)
        No, I don't need your love, no, no
        Can't let it get the better of us, no, no (woo!)
        I don't need your love, no, no
        I don't need your love, no, no (hey, I don't need your love)
        (I don't need your love) No, I don't need your love, no, no

        I don't need your love, no, no (no, no, no, no, no)

       You know I love you, boy
       In every single way
       Though I love you, boy
       I'll miss you every day
       You know I love you, boy
       I wish that I could stay with you
       And keep the life I made with you
       And even though this feels so right
       I'm holding back the tears tonight
       It's true, I'll never be over you
       'Cause I have built a future in my mind with you
       And now the hope is gone, there's nothing left for me to do
       You know it isn't true, but I must say to you
       That I don't need your love, no, no
       I don't need your love, no, no
       It'll never be better than it was, no, no
       But I don't need your love, no, no
       There's no point in tears
       It happens to us all
       When we're lost in tears
       It's how you rise up from the fall
       So I don't want your tears
       Yeah, I'm the one who lost her love
       But I'll be the one to rise above
       It may not go down in history

       No, I don't need your love, no, no
       You'll never get the better of us, no, no
