   during the early
   Age of Division

   Great Division
   , the Makraks were driven mad by the surface world's environment and began attacking
   Podling

   While brief, the crisis saw the creation of the
   Alliance of the Crystal

The meeting concluded with skekVar promising to aid the Gelfling militarily, as long as the Gelfling themselves provided the Skeksis with weapons.

   When a Spriton scout reported this incident to Carn and skekVar, the ambassador, thinking that Thall had betrayed them, called the Skeksis to arms and marched to the valley. Once there, skekVar ordered all Makraks, Thall and Raunip massacred, but the bloodshed was averted when the urRu intervened and offered to act as mediators. The opposing sides congregated in Spriton territory, and talks initially proved unfruitful, as none had any ideas as to where the Makraks could settle. The impasse was broken when urGoh revealed the existence of the
   Field of Fire
   , which could have provided the Makraks with a new home.
