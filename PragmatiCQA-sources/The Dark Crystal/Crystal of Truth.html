   The Crystal of Truth was quartz-like in shape and was rhomboidal at its top and base, with a threefold symmetry, and was suspended in midair by its own gravity.

   hypothesized, in the absence of physical samples, that it was made of a high
   quartz
   , and deduced that it possessed an asymmetrical molecular structure. This would have granted the Crystal the ability to selectively absorb polarized light and thus excite Thra's rarer elements.

   's own research showed that the Crystal's molecular structure had a spiral linkage which enabled it to rotate the plane of polarization of a beam of polarized light.

  <p key="e1eee2f2-03bc-45e9-9055-0237a84161fd">
   Essentially a sentient entity, the Crystal communicated verbally on rare occasions by projecting and speaking through images of individuals it had previously been in contact with.

  <p key="75d794d8-0739-415e-87b5-05c6434e9b0f">
   The Crystal nourished itself through the light of the

    Three Brothers
   </a>
   .
   When one or more of the Brothers hung directly overhead, the polarized power emanating from them would untwist the Crystal's spiral linkage and produce a focused and intensely concentrated beam.
   Direct exposure to such a beam had healing properties.
   Surplus energy from the beam would be distributed throughout Thra via a network of crystal veins
   and be converted into
   <a href="Essence.html" key="75abc04c-5a2e-4eda-94ed-5bf5b41edf79" title="Essence">

  <p key="2f81a5c7-db08-4246-bfb0-c08ce899328f">
   Damaging the Crystal would prevent its spiral linkage from untwisting, causing it to develop a wine-dark color and entrap purely malevolent energies,
   which would manifest throughout Thra in the form of the
   Darkening
   .
   Preventing it from sustaining itself with the light of the Three Brothers would, furthermore, cause the Crystal to extract energy from the essence of living creatures in its vicinity.

   The Fallen urSkeks, with Aughra's assistance, planned to use the light of the Crystal to purify themselves of their darker natures and return home during the second Great Conjunction. The urSkeks created a network of mirrors around the Crystal, which would focus the rays of the Three Suns shining down on the Crystal onto each of them, thus burning away the evil in their souls. However, when the Great Conjunction began,

   The resulting sound was said to have rendered the Skeksis tone deaf, and was thought to still be audible within the Castle centuries later.
