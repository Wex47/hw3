   The Podlings were social creatures that lived in tight-knit communities. Most Podling villages lacked any real political structure. They did, however, occasionally nominate a particularly venerated elder as chief, whom they would call "The Father" and consult in times of difficulty.
   The Podling village of
   Noy
   was exceptional, as it had a hereditary clan-based society like the Gelfling, though gender was not a factor in deciding leadership.
   Their economic system was based on bartering.

   Podlings were an agricultural people, whose rural lifestyle made them revel in their lack of cleanliness.
   Among their dishes were cheese and vegetables,
   katyaken-egg flans
   , gourd mush, dyillorkin seeds, river roots, berries, and bellow bread loaves. Typical Podling drinks included milk, juice,
   and intoxicating beverages.
   While Podlings were mostly vegetarian, they would consume

   Their concept of time was so deeply rooted to the immutable cycle of the seasons that they found change, and the hunger for it, to be incomprehensible.
   Thus, unlike the Gelfling, their way of life changed little during the rule of the Skeksis. They were, furthermore, largely ignorant of anything outside their provincial lives, knowing nothing of the

    [A] Podling can run in, scream, fall down, jump up, be drunk, and run out the door, and you’re having a great time. A Gelfling doing that doesn’t feel right; a Skeksis doing that doesn’t feel right. So Podlings are really fun and freeing because they’re just physical comedy.
