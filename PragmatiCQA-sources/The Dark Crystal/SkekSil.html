   SkekSil then thwarted skekTek's attempt to out him out for the vial's loss by weaving a tale of half-truths so that the Scientist would be punished instead, later giving him a pair of Gruenak slaves as compensation.
   SkekSo gradually wearied of the Chamberlain's calls for moderation in harvesting Gelfling essence, and entrusted his former position to skekVar. In response, he recruited

   After promising to return Rian to skekMal once finished with him, skekSil destroyed the evidence of Mira's draining by drinking the contents of the stolen vial. On the way back to the Castle of the Crystal, skekSil attempted to deter Rian from escaping by justifying Mira's death and explaining that Rian could doom all Gelfling, before Rian was rescued and skekSil was forced to return on foot.

   the Gourmand that skekVar murdered All-Maudra Mayrin and was astonished that the Skeksis were actually jubilant of no longer needing to maintain appearances as they captured the Crystal Guards and took their essence.
   However, later providing an Arathim corpse for skekTek's use in the creation of the Garthim, skekSil conducted a scheme to win skekVar's trust as he convinced the Emperor to attack the forming rebellion, while at the same time sabotaging skekVar's essence vials.
   Though they were forced to retreat after the battle, skekSil's denial of essence to skekVar successfully weakened him to the point of suffering a humiliating defeat by Rian. Wounded and alone in retreat, skekSil secretly killed skekVar to regain his position as skekSo's counselor.

   shortly after, one of the escaped Gelflings was captured and, when asked who released him, identified skekLach as his rescuer. SkekSil took the opportunity to openly accuse the Collector of treason, and challenged him to

Unable to accept his defeat, skekSil continued to press his accusations, until silenced by the Emperor, who ordered him to enjoy the victory celebrations, or face the consequences.

   SkekSil was ambitious, arrogant, deceitful and treacherous, acting like a sycophant to the Emperor and feigning friendship to the Gelflings and the other Skeksis, while in truth serving only himself in order to secure, advance or regain his position. Unlike the other Skeksis, he rarely displayed overt aggression or exuded any kind of malicious intent, instead masking his true intentions behind a simple-minded, amiable persona which manifested itself in a unique speech pattern, often omitting
   definite articles
   ,
   subject pronouns
   and
   third person singulars
   , as well as sometimes referring to himself and those he was in direct conversation with in the third person.
  </p>
  <p key="e24812fc-d4fc-4a4f-bfa9-058ab3af3ab4">
   Cunning and manipulative, skekSil used half-truths and blatant lies in order to reach his goals, winning trust or laying the blame for his actions on others.
   His arrogance and ambition could however cause him to underestimate adversaries he deemed his intellectual inferiors, displaying a misplaced confidence in his own physical strength and accepting challenges requiring brute force from stronger opponents.
   Although not the strongest Skeksis, he was nevertheless a skilled combatant, being able to easily overpower a whole troop of
   <a href="Royal Guard.html" key="be9e839b-b0c7-43c8-a15d-04bc91226c99" title="Royal Guard">
    Royal Guards
   </a>
   .
   Like the other Skeksis, skekSil was a sadist, but he differed from the others in preferring to mentally torture his victims rather than beat or mutilate them: he mocked skekTek with eye-related puns after his blinding ritual, toyed with Gurjin by showing him a Peeper Beetle and describing its predatory habits in graphic detail, mockingly drank Mira's essence in front of her lover Rian and irritated skekUng with his signature whimper.
  </p>
  <p key="30e35ce7-e346-45b4-b508-96102116db88">
   He shared his race's pathological fear of dying, calling death "unnatural" and a "cruel joke" that made a mockery of the Skeksis.
   When someone stood between him and the power he sought or took his place, skekSil would become enraged and drop any pretense of affability, acting aggressive and rash, being willing to murder his own kind, an act even his comrades condemned.
   By the

   </a>
   , after being ostracized by his comrades for a second time, skekSil ceased his characteristic scheming and became much more combative and violent in pursuance of his goals, doing battle or outright murdering anyone who prevented him from obtaining the Shard.

  <p key="b92a31b5-0f4f-412a-b6a4-ad63fb41e835">
   SkekSil was the most articulate of the Skeksis in justifying their perceived superiority over the Gelfling, characterizing them as "weak" and desiring to be dominated,
   as well as analogizing his own kind as being to the Gelfling what the Gelfling were to crawlies.
   He was, nevertheless, not needlessly destructive, and could display some degree of pragmatism, being initially opposed to the wholesale harvesting of Gelfling for their essence, noting that "a wise shepherd does not cull [the] entire herd".
   Despite not having been involved in the formation of the
   <a href="Alliance of the Crystal.html" key="a5123dc1-9a00-47ff-878b-c5bf161454ec" title="Alliance of the Crystal">

   , skekSil was among the last Skeksis to promote it, seeing its preservation as vital to maintaining peace and order,
   and only pushing for war against the Gelflings once diplomatic relations with them became unsalvageable.

   However, he severely underestimated his rival, to the point of choosing a Trial by Stone to settle the succession dispute, an ordeal requiring physical strength rather than intelligence.

   Being the original film's primary antagonist, the Chamberlain puppet was technically the most complex Skeksis, having 21 electronic components and requiring four people to operate, in contrast to the other Skeksis which needed only two. At the time, it was considered the most advanced puppet in cinematic history, with its eyes, brows, beak and hands articulated by pneumatic devices.
   Frank Oz, who performed the Chamberlain, declared in an interview that he had a soft spot for the character, describing him as a villain who would murder his own mother with a smile, a facial expression he insisted be incorporated on the character's design.
