   The Gelfling leave the High Hill and Tavra, who has been acting uncharacteristically haughty and rude, insists that they travel to Ha'rar. Kylan reads Raunip's book and reads about a
   firca

   The next day, Kylan, Naia and Tavra arrive at the
   Caves of Grot

   Argot

   Tomb of Relics
   and that Amri will lead them there. Once they leave the dwelling, they discover Tavra with her neck cut open, claiming to have been attacked by once of the Grottan. Naia heals her wound and they make for the Tomb.

  <p key="3b2fc9e6-6e57-4815-87e7-5bb304da6069">
   At the tomb, they meet
   UrLii
   the Storyteller, who helps them search for the firca. Tavra locates it, but it is broken into many pieces. Kylan converses with UrLii, who tells him that his ability to dream-stitch may be of great benefit to them. They leave the caves and set up camp, but Kylan overhears Tavra communicating with a Skeksis and deduces that she is an impostor. With the help of Naia and Amri, he subdues her and discovers that she has been possessed by an Arathim named
   Krychk
   , who reveals that their brethren have already attacked the Caves of Grot. Kylan then uses dream-stitching to allow Tavra to live on in Krychk's body while the spider dies in hers. The group then decide to go to the
   Grottan Sanctuary
   and help the felling Grottans.

   The group leave their belongings behind and enter the tunnel. Naia and Amra make their way forward to find the right path and when they do not return Kylan and Tavra search for them. They reach a cavern where they encounter
   SkekLi
   the Satirist and fool him into thinking that Krychk has possessed Kylan. He leads them into the Sanctuary, where the spiders have webbed up the Grottan and Naia. As SkekLi gloats over his triumph, Kylan frees Naia and Amri and the

   Once they leave the Caves, the group discover that UrVa has left their belongings for them to collect. Kylan forges a firca from the bone of the Bell-Bird and uses its song to dream-stitch a message about the Skeksis' crimes onto the leaves of the

   . A gust of wind sends the leaves blowing to the
   Gelfling Clans
   throughout the
   Skarith Region
   and the group set of for Ha'rar.
