   Their eyesight was poor, but compensated with acute hearing, thanks to their large ears which permitted them to travel by night, as well as by day. They also used the echoes of their hoofbeats as a form of rudimentary sonar.
   They were a successful species with a wide distribution, ranging from the rocky cliffs of
   Ha'rar

   The Landstriders were the sigil animal of the
   Spriton Clan
   . Spriton-kept Landstriders were allowed to range freely in valleys outside
   Sami Thicket
   , as they did not fare well in enclosed stables. These valleys contained feeding troughs and trenches containing fresh water, as well as structures containing saddles and riding gear. They were fed on a diet of fruit and nectar, and were so accustomed to Gelfling that they would call out to them in the hope of a ride in exchange for a meal.
   Landstriders were also used by the
   Castle Guard
   , the
   Royal Guard
   and the
   Stonewood
   and
   Vapra Clans

   Robbie Barnett
   presented the designers with his stilt walking colleague Paul Goddard, who assumed a quadrupedal posture with extensions attached to his arms and legs. The body suit was covered in muslin, which concealed the stilts and gave the illusion of tendons and musculature beneath the skin. The heads were made of fiberglass, with radio controlled eyes.
