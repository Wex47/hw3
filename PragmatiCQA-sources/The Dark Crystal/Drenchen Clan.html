   , possessing gills which permitted them to breathe underwater and wings which, while too small for flying, could be used in underwater propulsion like fins.
   Their skin and hair was greenish gold, a trait stemming from their diet of lichens and tadpoles, as well as algae buildup from the time they spent submerged in swamp water.
   Members living outside Sog, such as
   Kartak
   , would eventually develop more typical Gelfling skin tones.
   Physically, they were the strongest Gelfling.

   Primarily hunters rather than farmers, the Drenchen lived their lives on their patron tree's canopy, and counted an unusually high number of healers in their ranks. They ate their meals in communal eating ceremonies, and held great regard for the color blue, which they incorporated on their tools, charms and weapons.

   The Drenchen Clan counted about the same number of members as the
   Spriton
   and
   Stonewood Clans
   , but its greater remoteness made interaction with it difficult.
   Despite its large size, it was well organized, with the Maudra having a council of
   elders
   delegated individual spheres of responsibility. Because their homeland saw little seasonal variation in crop growth, the daily life of the Drenchen was mostly dictated by the migrations of game animals.

   They divided their world into two categories: the High Road and the Low Road, the former being the thick Apeknot canopy where most of their lives took place, the latter being the swamp below where they hunted. As their wings were not as robust as those of other Gelfling, they learned from a young age to climb proficiently and to safely judge the strength of branches when leaping.

   Hard-Talk was a term used by the Drenchen to describe speaking without metaphor or hesitation, an ability which was particularly valued during serious debates or formal challenges. Those using it were excused from whatever penalty they would normally suffer for perceived offence. This bluntness had the effect of strengthening trust in clan leadership, as even council members were not exempt from being recipients.

Some Muski-Drenchen bonds were inherited by the descendants of the original pair.

The medallions hanging from the Maudra's chambers were decorated with blue ink sigils, and having blue eyes was considered a sign of mystical affluence. Fire was always depicted as blue, representing as it did the spirit and the third eye. A blue stone native to Sog was used in crafting sacred blue stone hammers.

   , though it also served ritual purposes. To the Drenchen, the head of the spear, made of blue stone, represented spirituality, while the wooden shaft embodied mortality. Once the shaft cracked or got bent out of shape, it was ritualistically broken and symbolically returned to Thra by being thrown into the water, while the head would be affixed to a new pole.

  <p key="7bb806ad-e3f9-4c30-aba6-546cc55d38a1">
   Spears were crafted under the supervision of elders, who inscribed them with protective sigils. Spearheads were left unmarked, though the scratches incurred during use were filled with blue dye, with the spear heads of older hunters often being completely blue from many trine of use. Upon the death of a hunter, the Maudra would break the shaft and hang the spearhead among many others on the Great Smerth's canopy.
