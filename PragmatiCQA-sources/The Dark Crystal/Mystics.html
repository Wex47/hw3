   representing their lines of thought during long bouts of meditation, with some urRu having such spirals cover their entire bodies.
   They walked with a swaying motion, as their long tails were not heavy enough to counterbalance the weight of their heads, made ponderous by their thoughts.
   Initially the urRu walked with a fully upright posture similar to their Skeksis counterparts, but as they aged their joints grew weaker, causing them to develop a seemingly permanent crouching posture.

   In contrast to their jovial Skeksis counterparts, the life of the urRu was almost entirely dedicated to ritual, an obsession which permeated every aspect of their lives, from eating and walking to sleeping and talking.
   When talking, this manifested in the use of riddles, as they believed that a hidden connection was stronger than an overt one.
   Mealtimes were also long and laborious, consisting of extended periods of stirring and mixing herbal preparations in pestles decorated with spiral pathways meant to restore balance. To the urRu, true refreshment lay as much in waiting between meals as in feeding.
   Most of their rituals consisted of interminable, apparently pointless attempts to connect physical objects with each other or discover new forms of harmony, such as linking pebbles and feathers together with string or placing themselves at the mouths of caves to modulate the sound of wind blowing through them.

   lyre
   adopted from the Gelfling. Aughra never understood what each instrument meant to the urRu, but noted that they never played more than two at once.

   Although Henson wanted the urRu to look like Froud's trolls, the latter modified the creatures to have four arms, in order not to lose his own creations' copyright. In portraying them as creatures in harmony with the world of Thra, Froud incorporated the same runic symbols seen on the world's landscape onto their clothes and skin.
   The urRu were designed as more connected to the natural world than the Skeksis,
   and the connection between the two races was suggested by giving them both the same basic shape, but with more rounded features for the urRu.
   Their sand paintings were based on the mandala of Hindu and Buddhist iconography.

   The creation of the urRu suits was supervised by Sherry Amott, who had previously worked on the Muppet dog Barkley in

   , himself portrayed via a full-body costume.
   The actors playing the urRu had to maintain stooped postures that limited their mobility. For some scenes, it was necessary to use a platform in order to allow the actor to manipulate the head and another to move the arms.
   To contrast the impracticality of the suits, the urRu puppets were made in sections connected by Velcro, thus facilitating removal after shooting was done. In close-ups, the actors limited themselves to manipulating the head. To further facilitate performances, the costume designers fabricated the interior structures of the puppets with nylon boning, thus preventing the performers from overheating.

  <p key="dc25585e-005e-46f8-beac-b52408d6657a">
   The urRu were the most difficult creatures to perform, with Henson himself noticing that he couldn't maintain a posture in the suit for more than 5-10 seconds.
   Jean-Pierre Amiel, a Swiss mime, was hired to teach the performers how to walk and stay still in hunched positions.
   Amiel also performed urUtt, the urRu Weaver, in the film.

   Although Henson intended to give the urRu a more prominent role in the film, he had to cut most of their scenes, as his sponsors considered the characters boring, in contrast to the Skeksis.

  <p key="1c7a83ad-c6ef-4fdf-a4a0-8bbccc46a763">
   Taylor further explained that like the Skeksis performers, he relied on a video monitor to get his bearings. However due to the smaller demensions of the Mystics, there wasn't enough room inside the costume for the necessary display technology. The solution came in immersive virtual-reality goggles that beemed their feed directly before Taylor's eyes. He said

   Professor Sidney Dobrin characterized the Mystics as personifications of environmental harmony, contrasting them with the Skeksis who embody environmental destruction.

   Gideon Haberkorn of the University of Mainz noted how the Mystics seem to represent
   noble savages
   who are, nonetheless, complicit in Thra's destruction through their inaction.
