   Hup originally lived in
   Sami Thicket
   , where he worked as a cook in a
   Spriton
   inn. He lost his position after striking
   skekShod
   the Treasurer, who had repeatedly complained about the food he was served and insulted Hup's intelligence. Tiring of his work, he joined the fraudulent
   Vapran

   as his squire.
  </p>
  <p key="93b929bd-d237-4c68-9acf-bdd4ed558d87">
   The two briefly worked as traveling minstrels, though Hup soon grew weary of his lord's dishonesty after being driven out of
   Mu'din
   by an elder suspecting the paladin of cavorting with his wife. During a trip back to Spriton territory, he and Barfinnious were welcomed as heroes by villagers besieged by a mysterious beast. There, he befriended
   Veara
   , who offered to teach him the art of healing with the
   herbs
   he once used in his dishes. When the beast struck the village again, Hup joined the Spriton in attempting to drive it away, while Barfinnious hesitated. Hup subsequently joined the humiliated Barfinnious in his quest to slay the beast.
  </p>
  <p key="c659c26a-7b58-44aa-a37f-0076e6af3505">
   While tracking the beast however, Barfinnious finally admitted that the stories of his own heroism were fabrications, and left Hup to face the beast himself.
   He eventually found Veara with the beast, in reality an immature
   Seedle
   . He and Veara took the creature to the village, where it was determined that its passive nature and flat teeth were not consistent with the recent spate of attacks. The culprit was soon revealed to be a pack of
   darkened
   Fizzgigs
   , which Hup defeated with the aid of a remorseful Barfinnious. After the two reconciled, Hup announced his decision to travel to
   Ha'rar
   and become a paladin alone, with Barfinnious deciding to settle in the village for fear of having his title stripped from him.

   Upon being dropped off with his companions at the Circle of the Suns, Hup took an immediate dislike to
   skekGra
   , who mistook him for a slave. He felt further insulted when instructed to act as the narrator of
   <i key="1100f224-b585-45da-83c4-f4449c0c7b4e">
    The True History of Thra
   </i>
   , which he botched so badly that his role was taken over by skekGra and
   urGoh
   . He slept through the performance, thus missing the story's revelations about the
   Dual Glaive
   and its importance to the Gelfling in eventually deposing the Skeksis.

   When they prepared to leave, skekMal arrived and attempted to attack Deet, whom Hup defended, only to be badly wounded in the process.
   Hup remained bedridden from his injuries, and although he wished to accompany Deet and Rian, he knew when he was too injured to continue, and simply advised them to be careful.
  </p>
  <p key="5a4c5ddf-ac90-4f13-9825-d1887b9ea7f8">
   Later, Hup was upright but still too injured to fight, helping urGoh and skekGra tend to
   urVa
   , who had previously fought off skekMal. UrVa briefly roused from sleep when he realized skekMal was on the hunt again, and Hup tried to talk with urVa, but he collapsed into sleep once more. Eventually, urVa awoke fully and, with Hup's help, got to his feet and walked to the cliff edge of the Circle of the Suns. There, despite Hup's screams, urVa jumped off and committed suicide in order to kill skekMal. Afterwards, Hup found the device that could reactivate
   Lore
   .

   , instead of being content as a cook, and displayed traits atypical to his race, such as rushing into danger in order to defend those in peril. This loyalty extended to members of other races who looked past his heritage and showed him respect. He also spoke better
   Modern Gelfling
   than most of his kind.

  <p key="2dc0976f-6a22-4337-bcfe-5942af80f40a">
   He had a great sense of personal dignity, and would lash out against anyone who insulted him with slurs against his race
   and disliked performing comical roles in public performances.
   Nevertheless, he was not above conning people for coin.

  <p key="14610e64-051e-4bfa-abf0-7338fac9a432">
   His preferred weapons were wooden spoons, replacing them whenever they broke during fights.
   His affinity for spoons went as far as his insisting on being buried with them should he have fallen in battle.
   Like many Podlings, Hup had a gift for music and was a talented singer.
