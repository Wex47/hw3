   ancestors, though they were enveloped in fire, and females lacked the wings characteristic of their Gelfling counterparts. Older members of the race had fin-like ears and sported a pair of antennae on their foreheads. Due to their physiology, Firelings were unable to survive on the surface of Thra unassisted, and exposure to water weakened them.
  </p>
  <p key="0d8e9c61-66a0-4be0-9b60-8664ea307407">
   Firelings, due to their Gelfling origins, possessed an ability similar to dreamfasting. Through fire, Firelings possessed a form of psychometry called "
   Firefasting
   " that enabled them to learn of events and emotions from the past.

   The Firelings, like the Gelfings, were organized in a clan-like structure and were matriarchal, traditionally ruled by three

   exiles lead by
   Chal
   and
   Saluna
   settled in
   Mithra
   , and the pair had three children, among which was
   Cindrah
   , who became the first Fireling.
   The exiles' descendants gradually lost all memory of their connection to the Gelflings and never ventured out into the surface world, which they referred to as the "outer sphere". Early in their history, the Fireling tribes were divided by an underground river. The chiefs among them decided to unify the race by vitrifying the river and building the first
   Glass Castle
   at its mouth.

  <p key="6eaa3128-cdc1-4a51-b176-15af84cae602">
   A hundred trine into the
   Age of Power
   , Mithra was plagued by the
   Great Dim
   , which threatened to drive the Firelings to extinction. The Ember Queens believed that the only way to reignite their sun was to acquire a "sliver of the great light" from the outside world and, using the last of their strength, they channeled all their fire into
   Thurma
   to enable her to survive the journey to the world above.
   During her journey home with a sliver from

    The Crystal
   </a>
   , Thurma learned of her people's past connection with the Gelfling,
   and restored the Crystal after learning that the Great Dim had been caused by the Gelflings blocking the rays of the Crystal from entering her world by accumulating offerings under it.
  </p>
  <p key="266e9357-d436-4565-8d6c-f9befd78b594">
   After the Great Dim was averted, the Firelings' attempt to rebuild their home was interrupted by a succession dispute among the Ember Queen Thurma and the pretender
   Nita
   , the latter of which being a direct descendant of Chal and Saluna
   who sought to rule Mithra alone.
   The two claimants later joined forces to defeat the
   Fire That Stays
   , who intended to destroy the Firelings for what he viewed as their decadence.
   After the Glass Castle was inadvertently rebuilt during the final battle with the Fire that stays, the Firelings were ruled by the Ember Queens Thurma, Nita and
   Fiola
   .
