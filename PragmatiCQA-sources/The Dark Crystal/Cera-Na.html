   </b>
   was a village located on the
   Sifa Coast
   , nestled in a bay on the ocean side of the
   Claw Mountains

   Sifa Clan
   , and was protected from the harsh ocean winds by the cliffs surrounding it.

  <p key="11a9c3fc-90af-47fc-ad47-20e661aa8cf3">
   It was an important center of commerce
   with a population in a continual state of flux, consisting of sailors coming in and out of port,
   where they would trade their catches and finds.

   The Sifa would congregate there for important occasions,
   such as the boat races following the arrival of migrating
   Hooyim
   ,
   and the docking of the flagship
   Omerya
   .
