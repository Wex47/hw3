   The Dousan Clan lived in the

   They resided within mobile "sandships", bone-and-crystal constructs that travelled the desert like seafaring ships, while on foot their crystalweave cloaks made them nigh on invisible within the Crystal Sea. Culturally, the Dousan were unusually quiet in order to not "waste moisture", speaking more often with gestures than whispered word,
   although music was focal to their shamanic rituals, said to invoke the

   . The Dousan also focused more of their attention on the afterlife than their current lives, abstaining from materialism.
   They were viewed with suspicion by both Skeksis and other Gelflings alike, having a reputation for worshiping death, and were not permitted to serve as guards in the Castle of the Crystal.
   Within the center of the Crystal Sea was the
   Wellspring
   , a hidden oasis where the clan congregated and served as a makeshift capital.

   to the south, Drenchens had a greenish complexion and usually wore their hair in dreadlocks. Being typically more rotund and hirsute than other Gelfling, the Drenchen nevertheless excelled at combat if they could be motivated to make the effort.
   Like all Gelfling, female Drenchen had wings, but they were more suited to swimming underwater as fins. The trek into their native swamps was so exhaustive that Skeksis frequently skipped the Drenchen during tithing ceremonies and censuses,

Grottans also had ears large enough to identify faint echoes, and despite their small numbers, their total longevity was roughly three or four times greater than other Gelfling.
