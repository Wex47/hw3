   Lords as part of their obligations to the
   Alliance of the Crystal
   . The tithes would occur once every three

   The tithing ceremony began with an official visit by representatives of the
   Skeksis Empire
   to each clan's regional capital, with the
   Vapra Clan
   having the honor of being the first to be visited.
   The process took several days, with a long procession of Gelfling offering the products of their labor, ranging from crops, jewelry to a song.
   Though it was rarely discussed publicly, doubts as to the purpose of the tithes dated back to at least the early
   Age of Division
   , when

   speculated that the tithes were merely symbolic gestures intended to show humility to the Skeksis.
   Many trine later,
   Brea
   opined less charitably that they were meant to keep the Gelfling divided and impoverished.

   's farmlands, thus greatly reducing the quality of tithes.
   When a farmer could not give more of his crops to the Skeksis, skekOk expressed an interest in the necklace worn by the farmer's wife, even after learning that it was a family heirloom etched with the final dreamfasting of the farmer's wife's mother. SkekOk feigned hurt at their reluctance to give it as tithe, at which point the crowd began to shout the couple down until All-
   Maudra

   reminded them that the Skeksis did not take what was not given. The couple, guilted and shamed into obedience, relinquished the necklace, which was later given to All-

   from the Skeksis. However, the All-Maudra's daughter, Princess
   Brea
   anonymously returned the heirloom back to the farmer's wife.
