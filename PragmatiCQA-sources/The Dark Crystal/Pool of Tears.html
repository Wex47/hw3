   The name came from a story of two lovers, one made of fire and the other ice. Because of their forms, they could not touch each other, and spent a hundred years talking and simply looking at one another. During these years they cried enough tears of sorrow to create a lake that covered them both, and rose from it completely unaffected by the other's element.
