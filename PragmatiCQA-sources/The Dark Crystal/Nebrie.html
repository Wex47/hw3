   Their bodies were covered in a musky-smelling mucus which acted as a natural defense, and sported a mouth with upturned corners giving the illusion of a smile. Their eyes were red and glowed when in a state of happiness or excitement.
   They were herbivores that fed mainly on algae and decomposing plant matter. Nebries never stopped eating, and continued growing throughout their lives.
   Their lifespans were relatively short, though they compensated by being prodigious breeders.
   Young Nebrie hatched from eggs
   and were born toothless.

   The Podlings considered the Nebrie their totem animals, and domesticated them for their dairy products,
   prizing their
   milk
   in particular,
   from which they made
   cheese
   .
   They would also eat their meat and use their oil in cooking, but only after the animals died of natural causes, as killing was taboo in Podling culture.
   The actions of the Nebrie were also significant, as the Podlings would interpret auguries from them.

   , they still bore some economic and cultural importance to them. The
   Stonewood
   used Nebrie milk as a medicine to cure
   Two-Eyed Stickler
   poisoning.
   The
   Sifa
   used leftover fermented Nebrie oil to coat the undersides of their ships in order to prevent
   Three-Eyed Crudder
   infestations,
   and frequently shipped Nebrie eggs.

   would help Podlings raise baby Nebrie, whose teeth had yet to grow, by chewing food and spitting it in their mouths.
   To be likened to a Nebrie held multiple connotations, indicating both someone methodical and easygoing, or just slow.
   The term "flat-footed Nebrie" indicated someone unable to win races,
   while being likened to a "happy Nebrie" meant someone who was as happy as could be.

   had little use for living Nebrie, slaughtering them for their meat, which was served roasted,
   and their skins, which they used for parchment, though the material was not durable.
