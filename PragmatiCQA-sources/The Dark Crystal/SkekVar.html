SkekVar later supported punishing skekSil for his crimes, but quickly switched to supporting punishment for skekTek when the Emperor decided the blame lay with him. SkekSil then snapped at skekVar for his spot closest to the Emperor, until they were interrupted by Ordon's arrival, who skekVar initially berated for requesting an audience with the Emperor until skekSo allowed it. SkekVar then participated in the punishment ceremony for skekTek.

   During the next Skeksis banquet, skekVar and skekSil got into a heated argument over how to best process essence, with skekVar stating they should take as many Gelfling as they wanted, no matter who they were and how the race would react. SkekSil however suggested they should take a sustainable amount in secret, slowly harvesting those that won't be missed and keep the majority of Gelfling alive to use as soldiers and servants. When skekSo noticed his body was still decaying rapidly he agreed with skekVar's more upfront methods and thus demoted skekSil, denying him a seat at the banquet table while promoting skekVar as his right hand counsellor and allowing him a seat next to the Emperor. SkekVar later went to interrogate
   Gurjin
   , partially draining him as a form of torture, until skekSo arrived with a new assignment for skekVar; gather seven Gelfling "volunteers" from each

After deciding, skekVar sent the volunteers to his carriage, only to be interrupted by
   Seladon
   (whom skekVar didn't recognize), reporting on her mother Mayrin's treachery. When Mayrin herself arrived, skekVar stomached her rebellious speech only briefly before lashing out with his sabre, fatally wounding Mayrin. Following skekZok's example, skekVar then recognized Seladon as All-Maudra.

When she openly defied him, skekVar became impressed and allowed two of the volunteers to remain, intending to replace them with Brea and Deet to be drained. He had them all placed in a cage attached to the carriage and then set off with skekZok, fending off skekZok's criticisms until they were ambushed en route by Rian and his allies. Although skekVar tried to run Rian over, the
   Armaligs
   refused to move forward until after

   Silk Spitters

   Threaders

   Stone-in-the-Wood

   However, several Gelfling managed to escape into the catacombs, so skekVar and skekLach followed them, only for Tavra to stab the General. Finding skekVar wounded, skekSil gave the General some essence to revive him, convincing skekVar to form an alliance with his old rival.

   SkekVar was the most impatient of the Skeksis, preferring violent action instead of scheming plots. In his youth, he advocated immediately crushing the Gelfling militarily,

   While well-spoken and capable of dissimulation in his youth,
   his characteristic bluntness worsened as he aged. Unlike his comrades, he made no effort to hide his disgust over the Gelfling, ignoring decorum even when in the presence of the All-Maudra
   and bragging in her presence that she owed her position to the Skeksis.
   His disdain for the Gelfling was only surpassed by his visceral hatred of the
   Arathim
   , which he considered a "plague" to be exterminated.
   A shallow individual, skekVar always judged by appearances, disliking Gelflings he deemed undersized or had faces he considered even remotely imperfect.
   This scorn extended to his fellow Skeksis, dismissing physically weaker and mutilated comrades like
   <a href="SkekTek.html" key="98ac9e90-53ca-4998-a876-9a8ef5a8e866" title="SkekTek">

   Out of all the Skeksis, skekVar was the most loyal to Emperor skekSo, though he was not above taking his own initiative when he felt it served the interest of all Skeksis, such as partially draining
   Gurjin
   , despite the Emperor wanting him alive,
   and murdering the All-Maudra, something he was not instructed to do.
   Though lacking in tact, skekvar was not without intelligence, as he was the first Skeksis to realize that skekSil was behind the return of skekMal. He was also capable of gratitude and honesty, being genuinely grateful to skekSil for saving him from
   Tavra
   , and thus did not argue with skekSo when the Emperor replaced him with skekSil as his counsel.
  </p>
  <p key="3c860603-4ea2-4742-b734-daa53fac6155">
   Ultimately, his grandstanding masked a deeply insecure individual, displaying extreme sensitivity to having his orders questioned
   or his bravery put into doubt,
   and made lamentable excuses when defeated in fair combat.
   He was also visibly unnerved during skekTek's initial essence draining demonstration,
   and exposed his cowardice by refusing to do battle with
   Lore
   ,
   as well as begging Tavra for mercy after she had wounded him.

   despite his wish to simply subjugate the Gelfling,
   and did not argue when dismissed in favor of his hated rival skekSil.
   He was, however, willing to exploit loopholes in his ruler's instructions, sometimes torturing
   or murdering enemies simply because his orders did not contain explicit prohibitions against such acts,
   dismissing fears of punishment by citing the Emperor's "forgiving" nature.
   SkekSo subsequently promoted skekVar to act as his new counsel, and approved of all his actions, considering his unauthorized murder of All-Maudra

   to be a liberation from the "burden" of the Alliance they had created a thousand trine earlier.
   The General's steadfast loyalty was such that skekSo grew to trust him enough to reveal his deepest fears
   and admit to lying to the other Skeksis about the existence of the
   Darkening
   .
   However, SkekSo ultimately viewed SkekVar as a mere minion rather than a friend, as he rudely stated he didn't care that skekVar felt honoured to be his new counsel and later callously dismissed him after he lost the duel against Rian.

   , the General was conceived by the writers as a foil to skekSil, setting the background to the latter's future conflict with skekUng, and to introduce a character whose fate was unknown. Javier Grillo-Marxuach explained that skekVar represents

    "the conflict of militarism"

   , possessing power but being restrained by the Emperor. Being a military character, skekVar's design was influenced by that of a four-star general, having much more showy and self-aggrandizing robes showing off his prowess. Kevin Clash, who played skekVar, was inspired by
   Colin Powell
   and
   John Wayne
   in performing the character's movements and posture.
