   After losing to Seladon in single combat, Fara returned to Stone-in-the-Wood and gathered her troops to storm the
   Castle of the Crystal
   , hoping that the castle guards would join them. The plan suffered a setback when a defecting guard warned her that the uprising in the castle had been quashed.

   Seladon hoped to one day restore the now deserted Stone-in-the-Wood to its former glory, but feared that the rebellion had put the
   Alliance of the Crystal
   at risk. Her pleas for clemency for the Stonewood prisoners to the Skeksis were ultimately rebuffed and she subsequently joined the
   Gelfling resistance
   .

   The Arathim were rewarded for their service by being given back their ancestral home of
   Grot
   , unaware that the caves had been infected by the
   Darkening
   . This betrayal lead to the Arathim deserting the Skeksis and allying themselves with the Gelfling.
