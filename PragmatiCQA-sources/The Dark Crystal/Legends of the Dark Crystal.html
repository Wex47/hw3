   , and the project was approved by Michael Pollis, the then senior VP of Marketing and Home Entertainment of the Jim Henson Company. Rob Valois, who had previously worked for the company, was hired as an editor, and worked out a deal between the two companies. It was decided early on to make the series a prequel rather than a sequel, as the ultimately unmade live-action sequel,

    A couple years ago, there were a ton of layoffs at Tokyopop that had a negative effect on a lot of their projects. I honestly thought "Legends" was going to get cancelled altogether. The best compromise TP made was to wrap up the story in two volumes instead of three in order to save money. That's pretty much it! I'm just glad we got to finish.
