    Muski
   </b>
   were amphibious creatures native to
   Sog
   , resembling a cross between an eel and a bottom-feeding fish. While capable swimmers, Muski had the ability to levitate in the air, though they needed to return to the water in order to rejuvenate.

   Muski were the sigil animals of the
   Drenchen Clan
   , who used them to retrieve prey during hunting expeditions. Drenchen hunters would dispatch their quarry with

   and send their Muski companions to retrieve it before it could sink into the water or be claimed by predators. In return for their services, Muski were allowed to participate in all aspects of the Drenchens' lives, accompanying them during journeys and feasts.

   , Muski were picky over their handlers, and it was impossible to guess in advance who they would choose. Once chosen, however, the two would be paired for life.

   learned during her travels that Muski seemed to choose their handlers based on the timbre of their voice, and that the individual markings of a Muski could give clues as to whose voice they would be attracted to. Bloodlines were also considered a factor in a successful pairing, as many Muski-Drenchen partnerships were hereditary.
