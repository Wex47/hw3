   society. Only three Ember Queens ruled at a time, each representing the different shades of a flame and each moment in time.
   Typically, only the offspring of a previous Ember Queen could inherit the office, though individuals with ties to ancient figures of importance, such as
   Nita
   , were also eligible for the throne.
   They were typically addressed as "my Ember",
   and had a council of elders.
   Each crown worn by the Ember Queens was fashioned from the flames of their deceased predecessors.

   After the
   Great Dim
   ’s aversion,
   Thurma
   was chosen to be crowned an Ember Queen until Nita's interruption. The two decided to fight for the throne, by learning
   Fire Angling
   and rebuilding the
   Glass Castle
   . However, the two teamed up against their corrupted teacher, the
   Fire That Stays
   , and later co-ruled as three Ember Queens once more alongside
   Fiola
   , another daughter of an Ember Queen and Thurma's friend.
