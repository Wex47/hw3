   In the far north of the Desert lay the

   with their relative isolation being the only reason why their heretical beliefs were tolerated. Furthermore, they considered

  <p key="749f4521-8d96-4860-b791-c8a90fa71223">
   Because their belief system put more weight on connecting with Thra rather than with other Gelfling, the Dousan rarely associated with other clans, leading most non-Dousan Gelfling to distrust their desert-dwelling cousins, seeing their silence as aloofness and unfriendliness.

   , during her travels with the Dousan, dismissed such views as ignorant,
   though some Dousan were indeed intensely xenophobic, to the point of considering mixed-clan relationships to be a capital offence.

  <p key="3aa39138-6fcd-4afd-ae7d-9c5f1cc954cc">
   In contrast to other clans, which saw funerals as somber occasions, the Dousan saw such events as an opportunity for music and revelry, burying the deceased under the Wellspring Tree and burning their belongings in a pyre whilst singing of their favorite memories of their departed friend.

  <p key="ce24e26a-29ea-4082-8594-d09f15178588">
   The Dousan divided their daily work into so-called "body" and "spirit" tasks, the former consisting of water collection, food preparation and seeking shelter, while the latter were mostly dedicated to silent meditation, fire burning and incense making.
   As water was scarce outside the Wellspring, the Dousan would set water traps to collect the moisture which descended during the night, pouring it into barrels at sunrise. While they traditionally abstained from consuming diurnal animals, they had no restrictions when it came to flowers, which grew in pocketed dunes and were prized for their nectar.
   Dousan shamans were known to consume
   urdrupes
   in order to speak with Thra and glimpse into the future.

   The
   Daeydoim
   was the Dousan's sigil animal, and was believed to have sprung from the footprints left by
   Raunip
   in his wanderings. The so-called Trial of the Daeydoim, performed by childlings before leaving the Wellspring and by elders retiring from their xerics, was a three day expedition in which the participant would travel deep into the desert wearing nothing but a sheet of red cloth. What happened during those three days was a closely guarded secret not shared with outsiders. Survivors of the trial would be anointed by the milk of the Wellspring Tree. If the participant was a childling, they would be assigned to a xeric by the Maudra and the sandmaster council, while an elder preparing for retirement would have been given a hut known as the "Last Home" within the Wellspring, as well as a seat on the council.

   Dousan incense was renowned throughout Thra, and was used in such diverse places as the
   Citadel
   ,
   Domrak
   and the
   Castle of the Crystal
   . The creation of incense was a task reserved for elders who had retired from their xerics, and the final product took the form of palm-sized chips which would produce a blue smoke when burned. Thriya described the aroma as "savory" and "heady".

   Although minimalists when it came to clothing, the Dousan adorned their bodies with elaborate tattoos which served the double function of blocking the rays of the Three Suns and carrying meaning. The tattoos were applied using the abrasive scales of Crystal Skimmers, the hollows of which would be filled with ink which entered the skin upon perforation. The most common ink colors, deep blue, green and gold, were obtained from plants indigenous to the Crystal Desert, while rarer colors, such as white or silver, had to be obtained elsewhere, with Thriya noting that such quests for new colors were the only example of materialism she had witnessed among the Dousan.
