   story that detailed how wings of female Gelfling were received. There were many variations of how the wings came to be: from a girl plucking a cloud from the sky and knitted about her shoulders or how a pretty lass touched her hands to a rock and made a wish for crystalline wings. A darker tale was recounted by a Gelfling traveler named
   Harle
   , who claimed his story to be true and witnessed by his great grandmother.

   feathers and stabbed them into their girl's shoulders sewing them to the bone. Having wing snow the maiden spread them out feeling the energies of the
