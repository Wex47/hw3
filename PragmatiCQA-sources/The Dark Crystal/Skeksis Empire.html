   The Empire was an autocratic state headed by an Emperor who held almost absolute power, with limitations being imposed by religious dogma. Directly under the Emperor was a triumvirate consisting of a Chamberlain responsible for maintaining the sovereign's personal assets,
   a General in charge of state security,
   and a Ritual Master responsible for providing prophecies and religious guidance,
   all three of which had constitutional claims to the succession should the Emperor have expired.
