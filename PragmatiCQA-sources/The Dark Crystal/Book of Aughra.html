   Discovered by accident on
   Earth
   among other artifacts near an eroded rock carving, the location of its discovery was never divulged, but its existence was long rumored among linguists and thaumatologists. The text was primarily written in
   Aughrian
   , though it also included texts in the
   Gelfling
   ,
   Skeksis
   and
   urRu languages
   . Translation of the text was done largely through meditation, though Llewellyn and his colleagues were secretive of the exact technique, fearing the consequences of inadvertently contacting other worlds.

   The book was published in English in 1981, and included Llewellyn's annotations.
