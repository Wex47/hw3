SkekTek reported this to the Emperor and that skekSil was to blame for stealing the vial, but skekSil twisted the story such that it seemed to be skekTek's fault that the Gelfling escaped with the vial in the first place. This resulted in skekTek being punished by having a peeper beetle gouge out his right eye,
   which he replaced with a bionic one which he admitted had better vision than his original. Despite his resentment of skekSil, he somewhat forgave him when skekSil gave skekTek a pair of

   Thanks to the Gruenaks' aid, skekTek repaired the machine while building chairs designed to restrain the Gelflings and extract their essence. While impressing the Emperor, skekTek was astonished at skekSo's insistence to extract essence from a large amount of Gelflings. Under duress, skekTek hypothesized that 50 Gelfling would be required each

   After making upgrades to drain three Gelflings at once without damaging the Crystal, skekTek was allowed a seat at the banquet table. One night, when the Chamberlain returned from Stone-in-the-Wood, skekTek and the other Skeksis mocked skekSil's peachberry stench and forced him out of the banquet hall.

SkekTek's attempts to reanimate the corpses with the Dark Crystal initially failed, so he decided to take advantage of the other Skeksis' absence to become intoxicated on essence and lavish himself on the throne. Playing at being Emperor and parroting many of the abuses directed at him, skekTek forced the Podlings to work faster than ever, physically abusing them when he was displeased with the food they brought. When skekMal awakened, skekTek informed the Hunter of the other Skeksis' location, only for the Hunter to call the Scientist a coward for not joining the fight. Infuriated by skekMal's insult, skekTek took out his pent up rage on the Gruenaks when they revolted, throwing one of them down the Castle shaft. SkekTek then managed to kill the other Gruenak by repeatedly cracking its skull with a piece of broken machinery. In a flash of inspiration, skekTek set to work fusing the Gruenak's strong muscle tissue with the Arathim carcass, integrating mechanical parts and Crystal energy to create the first

   Around this time, he began draining the essence of Podlings, but found it wasn't as powerful as Gelfling essence when it came to replenishment, as evidenced when skekUng drank a Podling's essence, only to discover it had temporary effects. He died when the Gelfling

   SkekTek was a self-proclaimed genius; a master of life and death,
   and arguably had more of a negative impact on Thra than any other single being in the planet's history.
   He had a genuine gift as both a scientist and an engineer, traits stemming from his obsessive personality and utter lack of moral inhibitions.
   Among his achievements was the exploitation of

   as living batteries to power the Skeksis' machines.
  </p>
  <p key="7b93ec65-10d1-4c83-a134-cacf65630118">
   His curiosity was so overpowering that he cared nothing for the feelings or lives of other beings, and readily incorporated cybernetic enhancements on himself in order to compensate for his lack of physical prowess.
   By the late Age of Division, his robotic augmentations included a bionic right eye
   and a mechanical arm and leg, the latter which lead to him later on in life walking with a very noticeable limp sometimes only to be aided with the help of a cane. He also replaced his jugular with a series of transparent tubes, which he used to monitor his own circulation.
  </p>
  <p key="d726aa26-6d63-45bb-9e48-be54843a33e9">
   Aware that he was the weakest among his kind, skekTek usually humbled himself before his comrades, while secretly hoping to win their respect through his projects. In truth, however, the others feared him because they understood nothing of his work, and were disturbed by his acts of self mutilation in pursuit of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p key="5c2aa8e5-c295-4f8d-951a-c6a1eae98b47">
   The abuse and mockery he received from his far stronger comrades left him with a persecution complex, as well as a violent temper. Unable to express his anger to the other Skeksis, skekTek vented it on the castle's servants.
   The only creature skekTek showed affection to was the

   , which he referred to as a friend. To his fellow Skeksis, he typically expressed his frustration by peppering his utterances with overly technical jargon, which he knew his comrades would struggle to understand.
  </p>
  <p key="23b03393-0a8f-4047-8c73-101982063a95">
   Like most of the other Skeksis, skekTek was sadistic, finding great amusement in seeing creatures far weaker than him like the Podlings and Gelflings being tortured. Despite this, he was also capable of realism and pragmatism, as he was the only other Skeksis apart from

   to recognize that the Crystal's failure to grant him and his cohorts life was due to them overusing its energies. He also initially disagreed with skekSo's plan to consume as much essence as possible, citing the fact that it would further throw Thra out of balance and cause the Darkening to spread faster.

   SkekTek partially regretted ending his friendship with Aughra, as she was the only immortal who shared his interest, but begrudgingly cut ties with her to maintain skekSo's favour.

   Like the rest of the Skeksis, SkekTek was intimidated and repulsed by the Hunter for his savagery and threatening presence. Despite this, he examined skekMal after the latter came back to the castle after his encounter with the Archer. SkekTek tried to heal skekMal, but was powerless as the Hunter's injuries were too great to be healed. In a desperate attempt to save skekMal, the Scientist agreed to drain Aughra of her essence despite his past friendship with her, but even that seemed to fail. However, skekTek was shocked and frightened later when skekMal woke up alive and was mocked by the Hunter for his apparent cowardice, causing the frustrated Scientist to defend himself by revealing that he was forced to stay there.

   SkekSil himself recognized the Scientist's usefulness and stoked his ego by feigning interest in his work.
   After being framed by skekSil for failing to capture Rian and losing his eye as punishment, and despite the Chamberlain's gift of two Gruenak slaves as a compensation, skekTek developed a strong grudge against SkekSil and took every opportunity to join his comrades in publicly humiliating the Chamberlain, urging him mockingly to cleanse himself of peachberry stench
   and enthusiastically leading the charge to strip him of his robes after his failed bid to inherit skekSo's throne.

   , though the relationship was mostly one sided: while the Emperor was confident in skekTek's abilities to solve the Skeksis' problems, he still held little regard for the Scientist, mocking him for his loneliness,
   physical weakness and odd speech patterns.
   SkekTek was, nevertheless, one of the few Skeksis bold enough to reveal uncomfortable truths to the Emperor, such as the limitations of essence's life-giving properties
   and the catastrophic consequences overconsumption of essence would have on Thra.
   When alone, skekTek would go on tirades over the Emperor's disrespect and ingratitude, but never expressed his true feelings publicly. Nevertheless, he continued to try getting SkekSo's favor, even sacrificing his friendship with Aughra to remain on his good side.

   Resenting this insult, skekTek encouraged skekUng to allow him to drain Kira of her essence rather than kill her at once, secretly intending to withhold some of the elixir for himself, knowing that the new emperor was ignorant of the exact quantity of essence a Gelfling held.
