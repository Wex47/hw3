   The noun "urRu", which meant "old and wise ones",
   was what members of the race originally called themselves. The term "Mystics" was first coined by
   Kotha
   during the
   Makrak crisis

   and later became a common informal name for the urRu, even among themselves.
   Both terms were in use among the Skeksis, with

   However, the features of the urRu were much more mammalian. They had long necks covered with manes of thick gray hair, and their faces were wrinkled with runic patterns
   representing their lines of thought during long bouts of meditation, with some urRu having such spirals cover their entire bodies.
   They walked with a swaying motion, as their long tails were not heavy enough to counterbalance the weight of their heads, made ponderous by their thoughts.
   Initially the urRu walked with a fully upright posture similar to their Skeksis counterparts, but as they aged their joints grew weaker, causing them to develop a seemingly permanent crouching posture.

   The corona that once flowed through the

   Nevertheless, they still had access to urSkek abilities absent in their Skeksis counterparts, including telepathy
   and the power to manipulate the
   Uni-Verse

   The urRu inherited the wisdom of the
   urSkeks

   In their own words, wisdom was for understanding, not knowing.
   As such, their knowledge was entirely conceptual, being able to teach only by precept rather than by example, with their collective sense of guilt over the
   Great Division

   In contrast to their jovial Skeksis counterparts, the life of the urRu was almost entirely dedicated to ritual, an obsession which permeated every aspect of their lives, from eating and walking to sleeping and talking.
   When talking, this manifested in the use of riddles, as they believed that a hidden connection was stronger than an overt one.
   Mealtimes were also long and laborious, consisting of extended periods of stirring and mixing herbal preparations in pestles decorated with spiral pathways meant to restore balance. To the urRu, true refreshment lay as much in waiting between meals as in feeding.
   Most of their rituals consisted of interminable, apparently pointless attempts to connect physical objects with each other or discover new forms of harmony, such as linking pebbles and feathers together with string or placing themselves at the mouths of caves to modulate the sound of wind blowing through them.

   were also practiced.
   The urRu were also accomplished alchemists, with

   veneration for the harp, as it incorporated the principles of the triangle and woven chords. UrRu harps were tuned by adjusting weighted amulets on the strings rather than through twisting pegs. Other instruments included a sounding stick which was used like a tuning fork, and a
   lyre

   's expedition, the urRu were considered mythical by the Gelfling, with some believing that the chants were the cries of
   skekMal
   the Hunter.
   The Skeksis were aware of the Valley's existence, but chose to ignore it, as they could not attack it without putting their own lives at risk and, furthermore, considered their counterparts visionaries obsessed with their own inner lives rather than threats.

   UrMa
   came to believe that the Skeksis could be reasoned with, and took it upon himself to act as an arbiter in conflicts,
   while
   urVa
   , who had always been considered an outsider, left the Valley and became an expert in hand to hand combat.
   UrLii
   followed suit and became the guardian of the
   Tomb of Relics
   in
   Grot
   .
   Some trine later,
   urGoh
   was banished to the
   Circle of the Suns
   for promoting immediate urRu-Skeksis unity. There, he met his now disgraced Skeksis counterpart,
   skekGra
   , and the two of them eventually found the
   Shard of the Division
   , which they fashioned into a weapon called the
   Dual Glaive
   , intending it to give it to the Gelfling and end Skeksis' power.
   UrLii was given custody of the weapon and hid it deep in the Tomb of Relics.

   Later, the urRu left the Crystal chamber and positioned themselves in the Castle's upper tower,

   <i key="2b73daf9-1300-4897-8904-6972eac2e2e9">
    The Mithra Treatment

   , in which they were identified as Bada. In Henson's notes, the Bada are portrayed as a tribe of wizards oppressed by the Reptus group (the precursors of the Skeksis). They would have raised Brian, one of the last Eunaze (which would later become the Gelflings).
   During the 1978 noreaster, Henson was confined to a hotel room for 72 hours, and took the opportunity to expand on the Bada, renaming them urRu and modifying their connection to the Skeksis, from simple oppressed subjects to separate branches of the same species.
   From the beginning, Henson saw them as beings that had purged themselves of all material desires, but lacking the will to act in the real world.

   Although Henson wanted the urRu to look like Froud's trolls, the latter modified the creatures to have four arms, in order not to lose his own creations' copyright. In portraying them as creatures in harmony with the world of Thra, Froud incorporated the same runic symbols seen on the world's landscape onto their clothes and skin.
   The urRu were designed as more connected to the natural world than the Skeksis,
   and the connection between the two races was suggested by giving them both the same basic shape, but with more rounded features for the urRu.
   Their sand paintings were based on the mandala of Hindu and Buddhist iconography.

   <i key="b5ca08e0-4ed0-4da3-b8c7-7ddccdef5b52">
    Sesame Street
   </i>
   , himself portrayed via a full-body costume.
   The actors playing the urRu had to maintain stooped postures that limited their mobility. For some scenes, it was necessary to use a platform in order to allow the actor to manipulate the head and another to move the arms.
   To contrast the impracticality of the suits, the urRu puppets were made in sections connected by Velcro, thus facilitating removal after shooting was done. In close-ups, the actors limited themselves to manipulating the head. To further facilitate performances, the costume designers fabricated the interior structures of the puppets with nylon boning, thus preventing the performers from overheating.
  </p>
  <p key="2164b7f2-c544-48e0-8535-3d0a52158e44">
   The urRu were the most difficult creatures to perform, with Henson himself noticing that he couldn't maintain a posture in the suit for more than 5-10 seconds.
   Jean-Pierre Amiel, a Swiss mime, was hired to teach the performers how to walk and stay still in hunched positions.
   Amiel also performed urUtt, the urRu Weaver, in the film.

   Taylor further explained that like the Skeksis performers, he relied on a video monitor to get his bearings. However due to the smaller demensions of the Mystics, there wasn't enough room inside the costume for the necessary display technology. The solution came in immersive virtual-reality goggles that beemed their feed directly before Taylor's eyes. He said
