   Kensho was born in the early
   Age of Power
   to
   Kolba
   , in a village established by
   Chal
   centuries earlier.
   As a child, his village had been hit by the
   blight
   , infecting him and his family with
   shadow fingers
   . Although he was saved, he was left with scars and went to the
   Castle of the Crystal
   in order that the rest of his family receive the

   During a reception of pilgrims to the Castle, Kensho took pity on a family of
   Podlings
   lacking an offering to the Crystal, and gave them his
   birth stone
   .

   dreamfasted
   with her and burned his hand in the process. After

   awoke from the commotion, Kensho revealed to them that the number of pilgrims had increased, and that the
   blight
   was likely to blame. He and Thurma were overheard by Aughra, who took them to her observatory and had Kensho's hand healed, despite his lack of offerings. Whilst Aughra consulted the stars for answers to Thurma's plight, Kensho took her to

   Lord Commander
   , who reassigned him to cleaning the catacombs for expressing doubt as to the necessity of giving offerings to the Crystal.

   Kensho encountered Thurma again in the catacombs, where he discovered her hiding a shard of the Crystal inside
   a Tumbeloth
   . The pair were chased by

    skekSil

   and escaped from the Castle after Thurma burned through its walls.
   During their journey to the land of the Firelings, Thurma revealed the existence of the

    Pool of Tears
   </a>
   , whose waters would protect Kensho from the Mithra's heat. When they discovered scouts on their trail, the pair separated, with Kensho secretly stealing the shard in order to return it to the Castle and gain clemency.
   He was eventually cornered by Jen and a train of
   <a href="Garthim.html" key="a956bd69-2cdd-4411-9af8-892faa06fce5" title="Garthim">

   and guards. He rebuffed Jen's pleas to hand over the shard, declaring his disgust over how greedy his race had become and how he doubted his word over wanting to help Thurma save her people. Before he could be detained, he was rescued by
   Bohrtog
   ,
   and the two flew to save Thurma from skekSil.

   The pair were flown to Kensho's village, where he confessed to having stolen the shard from Thurma to his mother.
   Upon arriving at
   Mount Thranir
   the next day, they noticed a wall carving commemorating
   Chal
   , which implied a common origin for Firelings and Gelflings.
   On entering
   Mithra
   , they were confronted by Jen, who agreed to let them keep the shard. They were subsequently attacked by skekSil, who took control of Jen's Garthim and pursued them. Thurma then revealed to Kensho that the Pool of Tears had been a lie to get him to lead her to Mithra safely and the two separated.
   They reunited when Kensho was attacked by skekSil
   and escaped into a pool, where they accidentally dreamfasted and had a vision revealing that Firelings were the descendants of Gelflings. They landed in a pool which Kensho noticed made him stop feeling Mithra's heat, thus confirming the existence of the Pool of Tears.

   Kensho and Thurma crossed the
   Great Divide
   and arrived at the Fireling capital, now devastated by the
   Great Dim
   .
   Kensho witnessed Thurma receive the last of her dying mother's strength and accompanied her to the
   Wishing Well
   , where Thurma inserted the shard in a geyser, hoping that it would be shot into Mithra's
   Mother Sun
   and put a stop to the Dim. They were found by skekSil and, in the ensuing battle, Kensho extracted the shard from the geyser, having come to the realization that Thurma's instructions had been misinterpreted.
   He fought skekSil with the shard, but it was knocked from his grasp and fell into a shaft. SkekSil subsequently stabbed him, and he confessed his love to Thurma before dying. After Thurma retrieved the shard and healed the Crystal, the
   urSkeks
   resurrected Kensho.

   . However, fearing a return of the materialism and indifference which characterized Jen and Kira's rule, Kensho decreed that offerings to the Crystal were to be suspended. He later left the Castle, accompanied by
   Toolah
   and
   Bohrtog
   , carrying the food offerings and an orange stone in order to return them to their previous owners.
   The two lost their bearings in a forest and encountered the twin robbers
   Danevay
   and
   Aiyana
   . Identifying himself as the herbalist Kay, Kensho agreed to give the stolen offerings to their impoverished city of
   Dagger Root
   .
   Once there, he was confronted by the crime lord

   Trunk, who had learned of Kensho's true identity by listening to Thurma's voice emanating from the stone, detained him and tortured him with Skeksis-forged chains which polluted his mind with negative thoughts. Believing that the light that had resurrected Kensho was still inside him, Trunk attempted to physically extract it from him.
   After being stabbed, the light emanated from Kensho and drove Trunk insane. Kensho fell unconscious and found himself in the

   the Chanter. He was saved by Toolah, Danevay, Aiyana and the song teller
   Dihnmor
   , who noticed a black substance emanating from the unconscious Kensho's body. Meanwhile, Kensho's mind remained in the Prism, where he was confronted by the spirit of skekSil.
   The Skeksis Chamberlain taunted Kensho for his melancholy, declaring that he had never truly recovered from his death, while urSol encouraged him, reminding him of Thurma's love for him and instructing him to journey to the

   Upon regaining consciousness and animated with a new sense of purpose, Kensho journeyed to the Valley with his companions, feeding people along the way and decreeing that their destination become a safe haven for the poor. Once there, Kensho encountered

   The two encountered the spirit of
   Cindrah
   , who informed him that running from his responsibility as the lightborn was placing Thra in danger. Before departing, Thurma gifted Kensho with a part of her flame to protect him. In return, he gave her the stone he had taken from Trunk, so that they could remain in contact.

   Kensho left the Valley and caught up with his companions, whom he apologized to for deceiving them. Their reconciliation was interrupted by the arrival of a former prisoner of Trunk, emanating the dark substance and wrapped in Skeksis-forged chains. The darkened Gelfling attacked Kensho, wanting to possess his light, but was healed when Kensho absorbed the darkening within him. Realizing that there were other inhabitants of
   Dagger Root
   suffering from the same condition heading to the Castle,
   he intercepted the horde and attempted to heal them, but was overwhelmed by their numbers. After failing to convince the new Crystalline Eminence to not send the guards to attack the darkened Gelflings,
   Kensho took Danevay's artificial wings and lead them to the Crystal chamber, where the Crystal absorbed their darkness and healed them. After unanimously being accepted as leader of the Gelfling Nation, Kensho had all Skeksis artifacts disposed of. He then projected himself into Mithra, where he assured Thurma that they would meet again once both their kingdoms were rebuilt.
