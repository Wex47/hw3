   Gelfling essence had the effect of temporarily rejuvenating the Skeksis when consumed, restoring their strength
   and healing their infirmities.
   It also had an intoxicating effect when imbibed in large quantities, causing the Skeksis to audibly slur their speech, lose inhibition and act jovially.
   Podling essence was notably poorer in quality, lacking the glow characteristic of Gelfling essence, and restoring vigor for only a few seconds.
