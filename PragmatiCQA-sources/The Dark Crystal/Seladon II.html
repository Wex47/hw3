   , for not recognizing her work. Seladon then went to appraise the damage to Cadia's memory, and was later present when her mother tried to postpone audiences to several of subjects, missing her other two daughters. Seladon convinced Mayrin to put duty first, parroting her own words back to her, which Mayrin accepted and they went to hold court together.
   Seladon was later alerted by palace guards of heresy being spoken beneath the throne room, and she arrived to see Brea with
   Lore
   .

   Lambasting Brea for wiping Elder Cadia's memory, fleeing the Order of Lesser Service, and conspiring to overthrow the Skeksis, Seladon and Brea's argument became increasingly heated until Mayrin arrived to break it up. Unfortunately for Seladon, who tried to sway Mayrin to her side by evoking her responsibilities, Mayrin chose to investigate Lore and sent Seladon away to examine the

   dreamfasted
   with her and found herself within the
   Dream Space
   , where Aughra explained that

   . Seladon denounced Aughra as a power hungry witch, and was ejected her from the Dream Space. Seladon ordered guards around Deet and Hup while she reported to the Skeksis. Eventually Mayrin arrived with Brea, Deet, and Hup, and despite Seladon's protestations, Mayrin launched into a speech denouncing the Skeksis until skekVar killed her. Seladon blamed Brea for her death until skekZok praised her loyalty. Brea tried to reason with Seladon, but Seladon was unmoved and called the paladins in to arrest them all, allowing the Skeksis to take them away even as they named her All-Maudra.

   During Mayrin's funeral, Seladon sent six pieces of the
   Living Crown
   to the other six Gelfling Maudras, to be returned to her as part of the coronation ceremony. During the wait, Seladon actively declared her own mother a traitor and refused to return her body to Thra, insisting instead that she be cremated to set an example of her.

   When Maudra
   Fara
   of the
   Stonewood
   arrived with her piece of the Living Crown, she asked Seladon for the truth. After Seladon told her everything from her point of view, Fara assured her that the Stonewood revered Mayrin as a role-model and declared they would avenge her. Seladon rebuked Fara for her treachery to the Skeksis, and subsequently demanded an oath of loyalty to herself and her fellow Maudras from the other clans. Maudras
   Argot
   ,
   Mera
   ,
   Ethri
   , and
   Seethi
   made the oath, while Fara and
   Laesid
   refused, despite knowing this would have been a declaration of war. Seladon insisted upon her rights as Mayrin's heir, but Fara insisted that the All-Maudra was not always Vapran, and challenged Seladon for the crown. Even though the other Maudras began to argue with Fara, Seladon accepted the challenge and allowed Fara the choice, and she chose a Trial by Air, to take place in
   Raunip's Pass
   . While Fara prepared, Seladon donned a
   Garthic
   -style outfit, complete with foreboding makeup. Entering the throne room, she immediately forfeited the Living Crown, claiming it to be worthless and positing her new black crown as that of the All-Maudra. Laesid accused her of defiling her mother's legacy, but Seladon said Laesid invited ruin with their "feckless rush to war". Although Fara insisted that Seladon was not All-Maudra, Seladon hotly contested this, prompting Fara to take to the air in a rage. Seladon demanded that Fara bow, but when she refused, Seladon yanked her out of the air to crash amidst the rubble of the old Vapran throne, destroying the Living Crown in the process. Seladon then claimed that the "discord" was a result of her mother. She warned that they were on the brink of anarchy, and offered Fara one last change to join her and "snuff this fire before it burns {them} all", to which Fara defiantly replied "As you burned your own mother!" Angered, Seladon had her and Laesid escorted from the citadel and demanded the obedience of the other Maudras, which they gave.

   , Seladon mocked Aughra's advice and went to the Castle of the Crystal to seek clemency for the rebellious Gelfling, not realizing that Aughra dexterously placed her eye in her Skeksis-style dress. When she did arrive before the assembled Skeksis, she pleaded for the

   Gelfling Clans
   were loyal and asked for mercy for them, to which skekSo also replied, "no", resulting in laughter. Becoming unnerved, Seladon nonetheless called skekSo "as wise as {he was} fair", and asked that punishment be reserved for those who spread the "filthy lie" that they drain Gelfling, to which skekVar replied that they

   drain Gelfling, causing yet more laughter. Shocked but recovering, Seladon then suggested sending seven Gelfling from each clan in exchange for peace, as skekZok originally asked from Mayrin, but skekSo replied with "no" a third time, and the Skeksis mocked her for selling out her own. Finally growing desperate, Seladon begged that they at least spare Brea and Tavra, and skekSo screamed "no" back to her, devolving into uproarious laughter as the Skeksis mocked her as the "ruler of the dead", shredded her Skeksis-inspired outfit, and then had
   skekAyuk
   drag her away by her hair for draining. In prison, Seladon noticed Brea, and blamed her for her predicament until Tavra arrived, the Ascendancy mocking their squabbles through Tavra's mouth, rebuking Seladon's requests that Tavra free them.

   As the oldest daughter of All-Maudra Mayrin, Seladon differed from her two younger sisters in openly striving for the Vapra throne. Serious and proud, she strove to prove herself a worthy successor to her mother in the eyes of the Skeksis.
   She was a firm believer in the stability provided by the
   Alliance of the Crystal
   and constantly derided her youngest sister
   Brea
   for questioning the Skeksis' intentions,
   believing her actions reflected badly on her family's reputation.
  </p>
  <p key="160f4329-5e3e-413e-8055-d05980133c93">
   Ultimately, her stoicism was a mask to hide her insecurities, stemming from her mother's perpetual formality and apparent coldness, as well as what she perceived as preferential treatment towards her younger sister Brea. Her resulting bitterness translated into a distinct lack of empathy towards her constituents, expecting even the poorest of her subjects to participate in financially crippling tithing ceremonies and showing a willingness to sacrifice her subjects should her overlords have desired it.
  </p>
  <p key="7665b079-2914-43da-bfe9-b4477e518d15">
   Like her mother, Seladon was conscious of how her status and its trappings depended almost entirely on the favor of the Skeksis. However, Seladon's devotion to them was much more deeply rooted, becoming agitated whenever the Skeksis' intentions or orders were questioned, to the point of denouncing her own family members as heretics worthy of death, even denying them proper funerary rites. She was, moreover, prepared to forego Gelfling traditions in favor of more brutal Skeksis methods of rule should the former impede her quest for power. Nevertheless, she naïvely believed in the Skeksis' good faith, refusing to accept her overlords' true nature until her imprisonment, and even then sought to divert blame to Brea, convinced that her interference had prompted the Skeksis' actions, until the Arathim showed Tavra under their control.
