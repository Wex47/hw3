   He thus became skilled at dissimulation, and was not above twisting rules to suit his own agenda: he would spy on his comrades' plots and withhold the information from skekSo, preferring instead to use his knowledge for his own personal gain.
   During the brief reign of skekUng, he skillfully managed to nurture discontent among the Skeksis without openly questioning the former Garthim Master's authority.

   He nevertheless had a rather sharp tongue, and was prone to making sarcastic comments to comrades who failed in their missions or deviated from established plans.

   SkekZok was the most zealous of the Skeksis, viewing their laws and rules as absolute and immutable, declaring any deviation to be blasphemy. His religious beliefs hinged largely on the dogma of Skeksis immortality, to the point where he had never seen the need to invent a funerary ritual,
   and was quick to denounce anyone who spoke openly about the possibility of a Skeksis dying as a blasphemer.
   After the death of skekSo, skekZok's faith was shaken, and he thus became less jovial and more single minded in his quest to exterminate the Gelfling, demanding their immediate destruction rather than harvesting them for their essence, and even set aside his spiritual convictions in order to claim the Skeksis' throne.

   While initially the two were divided in supporting skekSo as Emperor,
   skekShod had become a firm ally of skekZok by the late Age of Division, supporting skekZok's bid for the throne, then plotting with him to depose skekUng.

   SkekZok was on good terms with skekSo, though he mistakenly believed that the Emperor favored his advice above that of all others.
   He was among the first Skeksis to fully support skekSo's ascension as Emperor, and would warn him of potential rivals.

  <p key="bd6bc9c7-f66e-4423-b728-212903aa646e">
   SkekZok seemed to genuinely detest the Scientist, calling him a "self mutilating crank" and a "mere Pod processor".
   The Ritual Master bragged about possessing a knife he saved for the sole purpose of skinning skekTek alive,
   and took a perverse joy out of mocking the scientist during his blinding ritual.

  </h3>
  <p key="5fdfcd30-205d-4a34-b0be-e18277a14b97">
   While respecting skekUng's prowess in battle,
   he held little regard for him as Emperor, being disgusted at his lack of etiquette, table manners and sense of urgency in immediately killing off the Gelfling. Realizing that he was no match for him physically, skekZok expressed his insubordination by discretely undermining skekUng's authority, taking charge whenever the new Emperor lost his temper and sowing discontent among the other Skeksis.

  </h3>
  <p key="218d6fc8-3677-459a-8e3f-99e710cac3b9">
   SkekZok's relationship with skekVar was complex from the beginning. He warned skekSo of the then Ambassador's popularity among the others, and had trouble adjusting to skekVar being his superior, questioning his decisions only to relent when threatened.
   By the late Age of Division, the two had found common ground in their desire for an unlimited harvest of Gelfling
   and their mutual inability to distinguish individual Gelfling from each other.
   He was, however, irritated by skekVar's impulsiveness
   and lack of decorum.

  </h3>
  <p key="668a5646-2462-4b4e-ba32-304cc1eca42f">
   Like most of the other Skeksis SkekZok did not think highly of SkekAyuk, thinking of him as too slothful and submissive to be a political threat. He was also disgusted with SkekAyuk's gluttony and glared at him when the Gourmand weakly suggested to not use all of the essence available to heal SkekMal, causing him to shut-up.
  </p>
  <p key="887a687b-d2b6-42b0-a150-3d154437fff1">
   Despite this the two were political allies as SkekAyuk supported SkekZok in his bid to become emperor after SkekSo's death, though he easily submitted to SkekUng after the General became the new emperor and did not take part in SkekZok and SkekShod's scheme to depose SkekUng.
