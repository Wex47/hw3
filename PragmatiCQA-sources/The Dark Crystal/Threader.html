   were a subspecies of the
   Arathim
   . They were much smaller than their
   Spitter
   brethren, being diminutive enough to conceal themselves within the folds of clothing and the cracks of buildings.
   They sported delicate, petal-shaped legs which permitted them to glide for short distances during jumps.

   Threaders possessed the parasitic ability to take control of other creatures and incorporate them into the
   Ascendancy
   , with the amount of control being imposed being dependent on the Threader's proximity to the host's brain.
   Being attached to one for more than a day made the attachment permanent, with forceful removal resulting in the deaths of both parasite and host.
   A Threader could, however, continue living if the host died.

   , in which they were originally called Crystal Singers. However,
   Jeffrey Addiss
   and
   Will Matthews
   chose to call the creatures “Threaders” in
   Age of Resistance
   because they felt that there were too many objects in the franchise with the name "crystal".
   When asked why the Arathim didn't use the Threaders on the Skeksis, Matthews replied:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="pull-quote" key="644fda6d-2537-4d83-84f6-f18cc8be58a6">

    In the books, the crystal singers have this ability to hear—they can sort of overhear dreamfasting, because of their connection to the crystal. Because even the spinners, the Arathim, they are creatures of Thra as well. So they all have a connection to the crystal, and that binds all of them together. You remember, the Skeksis are not from Thra. The reason they don’t work on the Skeksis is, one: By the time [the Threaders] emerge, the Arathim were already defeated militarily and morally by the Skeksis. They don’t think to turn on them. And two: Because the Skeksis don’t dreamfast, they don’t have a connection to the crystal. We thought their mind control abilities would work on [the Gelfling] because the positive way to look at mind control is more of a mind-melding. You can’t do that with the Skeksis when they’re not connected to the crystal.
