   Due to their constant use of means such as the Crystal or Essence to rejuvenate themselves in order to cheat death, and of no known Skeksis having died of natural cause, it's unknown what is the Skeksis' natural life expectancy. However both skekMal and skekGra were able of surviving and remain in a healthy state, despite the former having not used any known mean to extend his lifespan and the latter having stopped using the Crytal centuries ago due to his exile, indicating that even without any mean to rejuvenate themselves Skeksis still have a very long natural lifespan.

   They were highly

   Because of this, they had no rites to commemorate the dead, as having such would have been an acknowledgement of their own mortality.
   Nevertheless, they viewed the Great Division as a triumph and had no desire to join back with the urRu,
   as they still vaguely remembered the overpowering feelings of sorrow and guilt of their urSkek predecessors.

   The Skeksis valued power above all else, though their conception of it differed from that of their urRu counterparts. While the urRu believed that true power consisted of spiritual enlightenment, the Skeksis saw it purely as dominating others. The Skeksis were also highly individualistic, each one of them valuing their own interests over those of the others, and wearing distinctive outfits to differentiate themselves from their brethren, in great contrast with the collectivist urRu.

   Disputes between Skeksis were usually solved through trials of strength,
   though magnanimous gestures towards beaten opponents were not part of Skeksis tradition.

   The Skeksis were perpetually tormented by a raving hunger, and frequently hosted elaborate banquets which rarely satisfied them for long. They were fond of sweet liqueurs, hot spices and rich creams,
   with main courses typically being meat-based, sometimes still living. Most Skeksis had poor table manners, and would tear at their food with predatory voracity.

   Although they professed themselves to their Gelfling allies as immortal, the Skeksis feared death, and were tormented by the thought that the afterlife would have contained greater torments than the pain they had experiences as urSkeks.

   Before they could kill him, Kira intervened with a troop of archers and carried him to safety. Frustrated by their lack of progress in breaching the barricades, skekUng consumed the Crystalline Eminence's essence and used his newfound strength to bare-handedly batter down the fortifications leading to Jen and Kira's chambers.
   He and the other Skeksis were prevented from killing them by the urRu, who summoned a premature Great Conjunction which shattered the Castle, thereby separating the Skeksis from their intended victims.
   After Thurma returned, she restored the Crystal and the Skeksis were once again merged with the urRu.

   , where they were identified as the "Reptus group". The Reptus would have assumed control over the Mithra region twenty years prior to the events of the story in a coup against the Eunaze (the prototypes of the Gelflings), who were weakened by generations of easy living. Henson described the Reptus as a totalitarian society, whose members are "sunken in character, depraved, corrupt and vicious, and cruel to one another". They would have lived in a citadel which they never left, spending their lives showing off and controlling the world's mineral resources through an army of shelled warriors, for whom cannibalism is a common penalty for failure.
   Henson described the Reptus further in the following terms:

    Overbearing and brutal, the Reptus possess uncontrollable tempers. Their banquets are outrageously noisy - they are always voracious and animal-like. The Reptus gratify their desires in excess; luxuriating in strange and degenerate gatherings, inhaling extraordinary narcotic vapors, attentively listening to music that is both pounding and convulsive. [...] Conversationally, the Reptus beings are erratic. A discussion marked by icy, courtly courtesy and ruthless civility might suddenly and violently change into a savage and screaming outburst.

   Henson wrote that their ugliness is in contrast with their elegant robes, characterized by silk, brocade and lace, and that all their power is concentrated in a physical object, probably made of magnetite.
   During the Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978, when Henson was snowed in for 72 hours in a hotel, he began to elaborate on the Reptus. He renamed them "Skeksis" and modified their connection to the Bada (the wizards of Thra, later renamed urRu), from being simple oppressors to the latter to being separate branches of the same creature.
   He further added that the Skeksis, being incomplete creatures, are incapable of reproducing themselves, and attempt to create more members of their kind by experimenting on various animal carcasses. This new draft, entitled

   When the first screenplay had been written, screenwriter David Odell elaborated further on the Skeksis' society, giving each one a title or profession.
   The word "Skeksis" was originally meant to be a plural, with "Skesis" as singular, but the idea was dropped early on.

   In visualising the Skeksis, Henson had in mind the seven deadly sins, though as there were ten Skeksis, some sins were invented or used twice.
   Initially, Brian Froud designed the Skeksis with deep sea fish in mind,
   but later redesigned them as "part reptile, part predatory bird, part dragon", with a focus on giving them a "penetrating stare".
   In order to better allude to the connection between the Skeksis and urRu, the two species were given the same shape, but with more angular features for the former.
   Each Skeksis was conceived with the idea that each one had a defined role, so it was decided to clothe each Skeksis in multicoloured robes to reflect their personalities and thoughts.
   Froud's idea was for the robes to make the Skeksis look like a mix of a character from a
   Jacobean
   tragedy,
   Dorian Gray
   and
   Miss Havisham
   .

   From a technical standpoint, the Skeksis were the most complex creatures of the film, with the head alone consisting of numerous mechanical components.
   Most of the work in constructing the Skeksis puppets was done by sculptor Lyle Conway, who had previously worked on doll making and commercials with stop-motion animation.
   The Skeksis puppets were two and a half times taller than the Gelfling ones,
   and each one was operated by a main puppeteer who handled head and body movements, and a team of four assistants responsible for facial and eye movements through cables hidden beneath the robes. The puppeteer would hide beneath the robes with an arm extended into the Skeksis' neck and head and a harness placed around the puppeteers hips.
   As there was little visibility in the suits, each one was fitted with a closed circuit monitor which allowed the puppeteer to see what was happening outside.
   The hand movements, based on those of Dick Smith, who had lost a finger a decade earlier,
   were done through flexible rods operated by a hand-held trigger device which flexed each finger.
   In long shots, where the Skeksis were shown walking, they were portrayed by actors with dwarfism.
  </p>
  <p key="671b9a31-8aa7-42a9-b01a-8a2251fe49e7">
   Under the supervision of costume designer Sarah Bradpiece, the Skeksis' robes were conceived as reflecting their status as supreme, but decadent beings. Bradpiece fabricated the robes with expensive silks, velvet, lace, brocade, furs and exotic feathers.
   Some of the Skeksis' jewels were made with melted plastic toy soldiers.
   Once sewn together, the suits were torn and stained with paint and fake dirt.
  </p>
  <p key="b33db12d-1454-43bf-81fe-baf176b96606">
   The banquet scene was the last to be filmed, and the puppeteers used it as an opportunity to let off steam after months of shooting: while at first the Skeksis puppets were treated with velvet gloves, in this scene they were freely dirtied with rancid noodles and drenched in water, as the latex skin was at that point already crumbling.

   , the Skeksis were conceived as being at the pinnacle of their power, with the Roman Empire at its height being a principle source of inspiration. Although the setting of the series established that there were sixteen Skeksis, Jeff Addiss chose to feature only ten, picking only those that would have been right for the story. From the start, it was decided to make the willing subservience of the Gelfling credible by making the Skeksis capable of being charming.

   The Skeksis puppets were constructed in the LA Creature Shop, with the artists using the surviving costumes of the Chamberlain, Ornamentalist and Scroll-Keeper from the original film and old design documents as reference points. As in the original film, they were made from polyurethane around a metal and plastic frame, and were worn as costumes operated by a team of three performers: one for the head and left arm, a second for the right arm, and a third for remotely operating the puppet's facial movements. Unlike the original Skeksis puppets, which were tethered to cables, most of the animatronics in

   were done wirelessly. For wide shots, a single puppeteer matching the costume's height was used. In these cases, the head was replaced with a substitute which lacked elaborate animatronics. The puppets' robes were not as distressed as those of the original film in order to make the Skeksis seem less decadent.
