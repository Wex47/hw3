   In the aftermath of the Garthim War, having decreed Gelfling essence reserved for himself, skekSo's health nonetheless began to rapidly deteriorate with no more Gelfling left. In desperation, he sought to prolong his life with elixirs and enchantments, but to no avail.
   His fate was sealed when, in his weakened state, he failed to attend a

He died surrounded by his followers, all keeping respectful silence and kneeling for the last time before their emperor, clinging tightly to his scepter. However, skekSil, sensing an opportunity, reached for the Emperor's scepter, before skekSo sprung up to protect it. The frail and dying skekSo spent his final moments weakly re-establishing his position as Emperor, before succumbing to an abrupt heart attack and decaying like wood to signify that he really was dead.

The three had previously argued over who should take the foremost corner of the casket, and managed to come to a compromise which all knew would not outlast the funeral. The casket was placed onto a catafalque, and its contents were cremated.

   into submitting to him rather than crush them militarily.
   He was also skilled at averting any threats to his rule by promoting his rivals, only to withdraw his favor just to enjoy the sight of their fall.
   He applied these divisive tactics also on his Gelfling subjects, setting the clans against each other in order to prevent them from uniting and imperiling his rule. Nevertheless, when questioned openly, he was capable of displaying enough physical brutality to intimidate even the bravest challenger.

  <p key="d8b44a77-0e22-4a51-b68b-2bb105ef412e">
   As he aged, his jovial nature gave way to paranoia over his own comrades, whom he knew would have betrayed him given the opportunity.
   He became conscious of his own mortality and began to tire of elaborate schemes in favor of direct action.
   SkekSo recalled his life as

   , despite knowing it corroded his body and health.
   When pushed to extreme anger, he would go into paroxysms of rage which caused him to audibly wheeze and hyperventilate. Following such outbursts, he would be visibly exhausted and melancholy, making him especially vulnerable to the suggestions of self-serving subordinates like

   He was, however, still able to coordinate the other Skeksis into a somewhat stable community by keeping them busy in their respective roles. He ruled through fear by both verbally and physically abusing the Skeksis that displeased him, though he would at times give rallying speeches reminding his comrades of their superiority in order to motivate them further into doing his bidding.

   SkekSo was contemptuous of Aughra, believing she had done nothing for Thra, and that it was her absence which allowed him to bring order and innovation to the world.
   Aughra herself viewed skekSo as an ignorant "parasite" who knew nothing of the Crystal's true nature, and relished provoking him by reminding him of his inevitable death.

   By the late Age of Division, skekSo was still dismissive of skekVar's warmongering,
   but came to appreciate this trait when skekSil failed to capture the fugitive Rian.
   SkekSo subsequently promoted skekVar to act as his new counsel, and approved of all his actions, considering his unauthorized murder of All-Maudra

   and admit to lying to the other Skeksis about the existence of the

   Nevertheless, skekSo ultimately viewed skekVar as a mere minion rather than a friend and when skekVar lost the duel against Rian, skekSo callously dismissed the General and shamed him for losing, thus encouraging the other Skeksis to hurl insults at skekVar. However after their defeat at Stone-In-The-Wood skekSo still asked skekSil about skekVar's whereabouts, and said that everything was truly lost after the Chamberlain told him that skekVar was dead, showing that despite his defeat skekSo still saw value in the General.

    For the Emperor, I tried to use some of his blankets, wall hangings, and tasseled chords to drape him in. I also noticed in the run of drawing these covers that skeksis tend to have some carapace from some beast on Thra as part of their adornment––so I gave him a Crystal Bat collar with the crystal eye acting like an all-seeing 3rd eye for the ruler of those wretched cruel creatures. On his back I attempted to draw something resembling a Landstrider skull, but I'm not sure if I really did that so well.
