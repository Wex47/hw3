   Mayrin was groomed from childhood to become both
   Maudra
   of her clan and
   All-Maudra
   of her entire race.
   Her youth was marked by the pressure put on her by her mother
   Seladon
   , who frequently neglected and mocked her.
  </p>
  <p key="856196a6-1360-4fcc-bd65-8c327fbcd0d9">
   Upon being crowned All-Maudra, Mayrin found herself struggling to maintain the unity of her people in light of the
   Age of Sifans
   movement. With the assistance of her advisor,
   Dot'leth
   , she arranged to be ferried to

   Fenth

   , she took an immediate dislike of the skiff's captain,
   Kam'lu
   , himself a supporter of Fenth, for addressing her as "Maudra" rather than "All-Maudra". During the journey, the skiff was attacked by the
   Mondo Levidian
   , and Mayrin rescued Kam'lu from drowning, but found her mission imperiled by the loss of her advisor and the destruction of her transport.
  </p>
  <p key="159bd86c-f380-4189-9c6d-a0bc8b4124c6">
   She and Kam'lu were subsequently swallowed by the Mondo Levidian and encountered the
   Boblings
   and their
   king
   in its intestinal tract. There, Mayrin discovered that her mother had previously visited the Boblings and left them gifts. Under the protection of
   Gunda
   , Mayrin and Kam'lu headed to the Mondo Levidian's porticol, the key to their escape.
   During the journey, Mayrin started to consider Kam'lu a friend, and their relationship deepened after the latter saved her during a
   Zoa
   attack. They reached the wreckage of the
   <i key="c4ea03f1-0d09-48b0-af05-94f369592e7f">
    Hope of Thra
   </i>
   , where Mayrin had spent some of her childhood, and encountered the
   Necrizoa
   . In the ensuing commotion, Mayrin flew out of the Mondo Levidian's porticol, carrying Kam'lu whilst pursued by the Zoa swarm.
   Upon exiting the porticol, the pair boarded skekSa's Dreadnought and joined forces with Dot'leth and skekSa in repelling the Zoa attack. As Mayrin faced the Necrizoa in single combat, Fenth attempted to kill her, but was stopped by Kam'lu. Mayrin subsequently addressed the Necrizoa as a fellow queen, pleading with it to put an end to the hostilities.
  </p>
  <p key="6f538364-b21f-403a-8ff0-5219d3e383c4">
   After the Necrizoa retreated with its swarm, Mayrin's courage and determination to keep the
   Gelfling Clans
   united brought unanimous acclaim from the Sifan delegates, who pledged their loyalty to her. She married Kam'lu at Raunip's Pass, but surprised all attendees by refusing to fly through it, stating her intention to follow her own path rather than retreading her mother's. At that point already pregnant, she announced that her first-born daughter would be named
   Seladon
   in honor of her mother.

   In later trine, Mayrin remained a willing vassal of the
   Skeksis Empire
   , enjoying the rewards her station afforded her from her lords. Her servility, however, caused tension between her and her youngest daughter
   Brea
   , who opposed the
   tithing
   ceremonies the Skeksis imposed on them and perpetually questioned established dogma.
   When Mayrin discovered Brea had stolen a tithe and returned it to its original owners, she took the opportunity presented by Brea wiping
   Elder Cadia
   's memory to punish her, sending her to the
   Order of Lesser Service
   .
  </p>
  <p key="233ba353-cb00-4e2a-828d-a4a83f50672a">
   Mayrin later sent her middle daughter

   , who had allegedly killed a
   Vapran
   . Tavra's departure, combined with Brea's absence and reports of a
   blight
   which she considered dubious, began to weigh on Mayrin to the point where she briefly considered forgoing her duties in court.
   Upon investigating the blight, she found 80 of her
   Landstriders
   had gone insane and escaped, and heard further corroboration of crop failures. Her inquiry was interrupted by the arrival of
   skekVar
   and
   <a href="SkekZok.html" key="9b188bcc-6343-4d12-8744-9a8e1de5adc3" title="SkekZok">

  <p key="75be92a4-8911-4e39-8cde-ecb69e5b9975">
   After complying with their request, she was confronted by Brea, who showed her a secret passage beneath the Citadel's throne room containing
   Lore

   Seladon
   and other Gelfling. Aughra asked for their help in fighting the Skeksis, prompting Seladon to denounce the act as treason and urged Mayrin to remember whom she served, to which she responded that she served

   Upon leaving the Dream Space, Mayrin confronted skekVar and skekZok, demanding that they release her paladins and proclaiming the dissolution of the
   Alliance of the Crystal
   . SkekVar responded by slashing her with his sword, leaving her to die surrounded by her daughters.
   After her death, Seladon declared Mayrin a traitor and refused to give her the proper burial ceremonies, instead cremating her body so that she would never rejoin Thra.

   In her youth, Mayrin was plagued by self doubt, instilled in her by her mother. Upon ascending the throne, she immediately distinguished herself from her despotic predecessor by actually caring about the concerns of other Gelfling Clans who feared that unity under the Vapra was eroding their distinctive cultures.
  </p>
  <p key="bb80fd86-e548-46be-afae-6592f4d5f7db">
   In the final trine of her reign, she became conscious that her position depended largely on the patronage of the

    Skeksis

   , and suspected that their favoritism of the Vapra Clan was a ploy to divide her people. Nevertheless, she grudgingly grew accustomed to her situation and freely accepted her overlords' gifts,
   justifying her servility as necessary for maintaining order and believing that insurrection would have put her and her daughters' privileges at risk. This could sometimes manifest in acts of callousness on her part, such as going along with the Skeksis' tithing ceremonies which, while not noticeably affecting her own standard of living, could be economically crippling to her poorer constituents.
   Her primary concern, however, was the safety of her clan and race as a whole,
   and was quickly roused from her apathy when she learned of the Skeksis' plan to harvest the Gelfling for their

   Relations between Mayrin and
   Brea
   were sometimes strained. Mayrin believed that Brea read too many stories, and dismissed her thirst for social justice and opposition to the tithing ceremonies as childish political naïvety.
   She was further aggravated by Brea's constant tardiness at court
   and her disobedience,
   for which she punished her as she would have done to any other subject, declaring that princesses were not above the law.

  <p key="794c7cdd-3aaa-4b8d-900f-a815f4829a36">
   Nevertheless, Brea was believed to have been Mayrin's favourite daughter, leading to allegations by

   She would defend Brea from Seladon's bullying

   Mayrin's treatment of
   Seladon
   mirrored the way she herself had been raised by her mother, being especially tough on her to prepare Seladon in her role as future All-Maudra. Among the lessons she imparted to Seladon was her duty to be an All-Maudra first and foremost, and to avoid being swayed by matters of the heart, lest she fail in her duties to Thra and the Skeksis. She had genuine faith in her daughter, opining that she would have one day made a great ruler.
   Seladon herself resented Mayrin's coldness, believing that she preferred Brea over her,
   and was quick to denounce her as a traitor once she defied her Skeksis overlords, to the point of denying her a proper burial.
