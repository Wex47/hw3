   The first All-Maudra was crowned shortly after the
   First Arathim Wars
   , in the early

  <p key="6f8a1999-6e5a-41bd-9304-c7e642c78c96">
   According to Skeksis propaganda, the title of All-Maudra was created by the Lords of the Crystal to bring unity to the constantly bickering
   Gelfling Clans
   and to act as their representative.
  </p>
  <p key="b36bd0f1-a226-4d2e-9887-b45fd64e54ea">
   Because of her double role as both ruler and representative, the All-Maudra was less intimate with her constituents compared to other Maudras, with most spending their entire lives never seeing her.
  </p>
  <p key="87bce533-595c-420b-9ede-02d35ba9fbb9">
   The symbol of the All-Maudra's power was the
   Living Crown
   , consisting of seven detachable pieces which would be disassembled upon a ruler's death and later reassembled by the All-Maudra's heir and the other Maudras as a symbol of their unity.
  </p>
  <p key="91daa4a6-6a10-4eef-be04-8f8939f71bb5">
   Though the title of All-Maudra was traditionally inherited by the ruler's eldest daughter,
   it was not unknown for the ascension to be disputed. One such crisis occurred when Maudra

   Furthermore, although the majority of All-Maudras were from the
