   Thurma escaped from the chamber with a shard of the Crystal as the Guards confronted the newly returned Skeksis. Entering the catacombs, she encountered a
   Tumbeloth
   ,
   Tumby
   , that imprinted on her, as well as Kensho, who agreed to help in her quest. The two broke out of the Castle, with

   the Chamberlain and the Guards in pursuit.
   Realizing that Kensho would not survive in Mithra's environment, Thurma opted to take him to the

    Pool of Tears

   , which she claimed would give him the ability to survive. They were separated by pursuing scouts, though Thurma was unaware that Kensho had stolen the shard. Thurma meanwhile was chased by skekSil, also ignorant of the shard's true bearer.
   During her escape, Thurma entered an area filled with
   blighted
   creatures. As the creatures converged on her, the Chamberlain urged her to use her flames to defend herself, knowing that such an action would weaken her.
   The resulting conflagration burned down the entire area and rendered Thurma helpless. Before skekSil could kill her, she was rescued by Kensho and
   Bohrtog
   .

  <p key="359115f2-0eb4-4e2d-88b7-61496b3f2422">
   Thurma was taken to Kensho's village, where the inhabitants treated her with suspicion after discovering she had caused the forest fire, and she became disheartened when she overheard Kensho admitting he had stolen the shard from her. In her anger, she confided with Bohrtog that the Pool of Tears was a myth, and that she only informed Kensho about it in order that he could help her find the way back to Mithra.
   After arriving at
   Mount Thranir
   , the pair discovered carvings commemorating
   Chal
   , implying a common origin for Gelflings and Firelings.
   Upon entering Mithra, they were confronted by Jen leading a group of guards and

   . Thurma convinced Jen to let her and Kensho keep the shard, but skekSil intervened and forced Thurma and Kensho to retreat further into the caves. Thurma then confessed to Kensho that the Pool of Tears was a myth and the two parted ways,
   only to reunite when skekSil attacked Kensho. Tumby rescued the pair, by dragging them over a waterfall.

  <p key="9c827325-ec00-4c18-8989-1b9c7fbdd7bb">
   As Thurma and Kensho fell, they inadvertently began dreamfasting, and learned of how the Firelings descended from Gelflings. Upon hitting the water, Kensho no longer felt the oppressive heat, proving that the Pool of Tears was no myth. They made for the
   Great Divide
   , where they were once again attacked by the Chamberlain. Thurma repelled him with her fire, but weakened herself in the process. She continued her journey in Kensho's arms, and eventually arrived at the Fireling capital.
   They were met by
   Asheka
   , who revealed that the Great Dim had almost wiped out the Firelings completely and that Thurma's mother was the last remaining Ember Queen. Thurma's mother gave what little energy she had left to her daughter in order for her to complete her mission. She and Kensho arrived at the
   Wishing Well
   , where Thurma inserted the shard into a geyser, hoping that it would be shot into the dying
   Mother Sun
   . As they waited, skekSil caught up with them. In the ensuing confusion, Kensho removed the shard from the geyser, realizing that Thurma had misinterpreted her instructions.

   During the struggle, the shard fell into a shaft and Kensho was seriously wounded. After the two confessed their love for each other, Thurma dived into the shaft to retrieve the shard, and fell upon a mass of offerings the Gelfling's left for the Crystal. The shard pulled her through the debris and into the Crystal chamber, where she discovered that the offerings left to the Crystal had caused the Great Dim by blocking its rays from nourishing the Mother Sun. She reinserted the shard, causing the Crystal to shatter and bathe the Mother Sun with its light. With Mithra now healed, Thurma left the surface world to begin rebuilding her home.

   Before going through the coronation ceremony, Thurma took inspiration from the
   Castle of the Crystal
   and expressed interest in rebuilding the decaying
   Glass Castle
   in order to inspire her people. The crowning ritual was however interrupted by
   Nita
   , who disputed with her for the position of Ember Queen.
   The two went to the
   Burning Heart
   , which could only be ignited by a direct descendant of
   Chal
   and
   Saluna

   to the

   but were saved by the Fire, who agreed to train them.
   As part of their regimen, Thurma and Nita were obligated to cross through a waterfall. The two failed the test, being saved in time by
   Tumby

   prompting the Fire to be more severe in his training, at one point pouring water on them.
   On a second attempt at crossing the waterfall, Thurma and Nita were forced to join forces in order to survive and came across a baby Fragor. The creature attempted to lead them to an unknown location, but was taken by the Fire, who expressed weariness of the two rivals and ceased their training.

   Thurma and Nita put aside their differences and used their training to form a glass shield around themselves in order to enter the waterfall safely. They discovered the
   Drowned Spear
   on the other side and, ignorant of its purpose, built a campfire in order to consult the flames for guidance. The flames revealed that the Fire That Stays had been forcing the Fragors to destroy the Hallows by keeping their young hostage and that he had intended for the two claimants to settle their dispute by using the Spear on each other. Thurma refused to comply and consulted the flames once more, being transported into the

Thurma confronted the Fire That Stays, but had the Spear taken from her, which the Fire used to perforate the ground and cause the emergence of a subterranean river.
   Thurma and Nita lead their remaining people into the royal palace for safety, blocking the entrances with statues and debris. The battle turned in their favor when Nita broke the Fire's control over the Fragors and
   Glasme
   arrived in time to assist.
   With their combined strength, they managed to defeat the Fire That Stays by erecting a glass shield, deflecting a tidal wave he had summoned onto him. In the process, the old palace had been reformed into the

    Thurma is a delightful little fireball who feels everything very strongly and fire itself can be very tricky, so there was a balance we needed to find that would be both reasonable to draw but also emote how we wanted. Since Thurma’s fire reflects her emotional state, it was necessary to design it in a way that gave it personality. It’s a lot more “fluffy” than what we would usually do. We spent a lot of time looking at scenes of Calcifer from “
    Howl’s Moving Castle
    ” to get an idea of how fire could be emotive and took cues from that into what ended up in the final design.
