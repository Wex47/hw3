   questions. Heedless, Brea sought them out anyway, and ended up sprawling in front of their carriage as she pushed through a crowd. SkekOk however was surprisingly merciful, and insisted on her accompanying him in his carriage, where he shared his passion for books with her. Brea later hugged skekOk for interceding with her mother, the

When she examined the legal texts of tithing and found it immoral, her Librarian tried to take away her books, so she fought until some magical light began to stream from the book. Although she tried to tell her mother what happened, she became disgusted to see that she wore the farmer's amulet, as the Skeksis gave it to her after taking it, and stubbornly argued with her mother that they should even give all of their wealth and privileges to others.

   knocked him out with a bowl and offered to help Brea if she would get Mayrin's brightest jewel for her. However, Mayrin ordered Brea sent to the
   Order of Lesser Service
   in payment for her crime against the Sifans, on
   Seladon
   's suggestion.
  </p>
  <p key="99eb00ed-d010-4072-a36c-01f0cf20a960">
   Consigned to the service, Brea was made to wear a clown's hat and to wash filthy

   who resisted all the while, her indenture intended to be an entire

   in length. Although
   Duadran
   ordered her to run after a fleeing Podling, she decided to flee the service due to the urgency, tossing her hat away. Although she was caught by her sister Tavra, Tavra let her go, reassuring her and saying that the "bonds of sisterhood" could not be broken. Brea continued to Ha'rar, through the library, and flew from the top of it to the palace so that she could recover the "brightest jewel" in her mother Mayrin's chambers, hanging from the ceiling. Brea then went to meet Onica, thinking the jewel to be payment, but Onica chastised her and sung to the jewel; it is in fact a chrysalis, a container for an imperial

   , which began to move. Brea spoke her desire to know the truth to the moth, which then emerged from the chrysalis and flew toward the Ha'rar throne room. Brea flew behind it, and when they arrived in the throne room, the moth activated a hidden passage through the throne itself into a hidden chamber.

  <p key="09092247-5730-46ef-8130-00d3ad21d815">
   Entering the hidden chamber, Brea discovered a circular room with seven symbols, one for each clan. Given that the inscription above the entrance said "Thra's true balance will be found when natural order is sound", Brea assumed that she must activate each symbol in order according to each clan's social rank. Although initially seeming to succeed, with sound beginning to reverberate with each successful clan chosen, the sound vanished when Brea selected Sifa as the third clan. Brea eventually realizes that the entire puzzle is a farce, that the engineers wanted all clans to be treated as if they were equal, which successfully solved the puzzle and resulted in

   Berated by Seladon over wiping Elder Cadia's memory, deserting the Order of Lesser Service, and conspiring to overthrow the Skeksis, Brea accused Seladon of only caring for the throne of All-Maudra before the pair were interrupted by the arrival of Mayrin. Although Mayrin accused Brea of insulting her and tradition, Brea asserted that she values truth and knowledge, convincing her mother to at least see the hidden chamber and listen to Lore. Upon entering, Brea introduced Mayrin to Lore, and Mayrin then

   along the way, and then watched skekVar slice Mayrin's stomach open with a saber just as she gained her courage. Devastated and standing over Mayrin as she bled to death, Brea became even more distraught when Seladon blamed Brea for Mayrin's demise, sobbing into her corpse and pleading with Seladon to reconsider. Unmoved, Seladon ordered Brea, along with Deet and Hup, to be imprisoned, and then to be transferred to the
   Castle of the Crystal
   with skekVar and skekZok.
  </p>
  <p key="a9f23a3f-30af-4f59-95a7-3e4ad436b57e">
   Brea, Deet, and Hup were then escorted by paladins to the Skeksis carriage, and although she accused skekVar of murder and openly defied him, she was nonetheless placed in a cage attached to the carriage with Deet and Hup, which set off toward the Castle. En route, the carriage was ambushed by

   freed Brea, Deet, and Hup from the cage and frightened the Skeksis away. Happy to be free, Brea hugged Rian and sent the other paladins away to spread word, but soon broke down with remorse for her mother Mayrin, distraught that she could not perform ceremonies for her. Deet reassured her that they would perform the ceremonies in the Crystal Desert, the group singing a dirge in
   Old Gelfling
   for her, which Brea greatly appreciated. When
   Rek'yr
   arrived offering help, Brea quickly accepted, asking him to take them to the Circle of the Suns (albeit with coaxing), ignoring Rian's protestations about Rek'yr being
   Dousan

   After being dropped off by Rek'yr, he once again attempted to dissuade Brea from going to the Circle of the Suns before departing. Brea continued on despite his warnings, and when Lore attempted to carry her to the summit of the Circle when a sandstorm threatened them, Brea insisted that Lore carry everyone. At the summit, Brea was introduced to

   Brea was brought by skekMal to the Castle of the Crystal in a cage, and then subsequently moved by skekOk into a prison cell while they ministered to skekMal's wounds. Seladon, in another cell, blamed Brea for their situation until Tavra arrived, and the Ascendancy spoke through her, saying the age of the Gelfling had come to an end.
  </p>
  <p key="8acee54f-1c8d-4dd7-8266-8df4a17460e1">
   Pleading with Tavra to stop, Brea was bound and gagged by Tavra to be drained for skekMal's healing. Brea was only spared when Aughra bargained her own essence for the Gelfling's release. Tavra then departed to hunt skekVar after wounding him, and Brea caught up with Tavra, Brea found her gravely wounded. Brea and Seladon carried Tavra away, and tending to Tavra when she succumbed to her wounds. As Tavra lay dying, Seladon apologized for all her wrongdoings, and their relationship mended even as Tavra died, both sisters mourning together. Afterward, Brea heard Rian's message from the unnatural fires caused by the Dual Glaive's reformation.

   As the youngest daughter of the All-Maudra, Brea was not expected to inherit her mother's crown, and was thus not entrusted with any major function in the
   Citadel
   other than appearing at ceremonies. This lack of responsibilities allowed Brea to indulge her insatiable curiosity, spending most of her free time in the Vapran library.

   Much to the frustration of her mother and eldest sister, Brea had little regard for ceremony or hierarchy, habitually disobeying or forgetting instructions if they got in the way of her quest for knowledge. Her innate sense of social justice also put her at odds with the Skeksis early on, seeing the obligatory tithing ceremonies as an attempt to keep her people divided and impoverished. This sense of integrity was such that she was willing to sacrifice her rank and books if it meant creating a more equitable society.
