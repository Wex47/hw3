   did his prognosis of the Hunter's condition. After removing the arrows from skekMal, the Scientist determined that the Hunter suffered from severe exsanguination, extreme distress to the humus, imbalance of intrinsic fluids, and manifold ruptures in his corporeal morphology. SkekTek announced that skekMal's expiration was inevitable to the horror of the Skeksis.

   The Emperor, unwilling to admit they were mortal, spared every drop of essence for skekMal, but even that was not enough to heal the Hunter. Faced with no alternative, skekSo planned to drain all the remaining Gelfing captured from Stone-in-the-Wood. Aughra, finding her way into the Castle, brokered a trade: her essence for the lives of the Gelfling. During the initial process of draining, Aughra became dust, and skekMal remained lifeless. He was assumed dead by his fellows, who decided to honor him by cleaning his body, armoring it, and raising his death-like corpse in the throne chamber so that he would still be among them even in death.

  <p key="0ba496fe-7741-4b0c-84eb-f7bcd1878710">
   It was later revealed that he had been in a comatose state and quickly revived awakening to find the Castle empty save for skekTek. After learning the whereabouts of the other Skeksis from skekTek, he rushed to join the battle.

   , who was rumored to be the only one capable of controlling the Hunter.
   As his true loyalty was only to himself, skekMal did not reside in the
   Castle of the Crystal
   , preferring instead to live in the wild.
   He did not share his comrades' love of political intrigue, developing instead a fanatical obsession with hunting worthy prey, taking their remains as trophies which he believed conferred him their strength.
  </p>
  <p key="6f124161-26c2-408b-83f4-31d498a96707">
   By the late Age of Division, he had become so skilled at his profession that he had trouble finding any real challenge,
   to the extent of finding proposals of hunting Gelfling to be insulting.
   At that point,
   Rakkida
   were among the few creatures he still considered worthy of his attention.
   While contemptuous of his more sedentary brethren, he was nevertheless quick to violence against anyone who slandered the Skeksis' good name.
   He was also capable of delaying killing his prey when such restraint was advantageous to his comrades, though he would make it clear that denying him his prey would have resulted in death, despite murder being a taboo among the Skeksis.
  </p>
  <p key="5a1324dd-9ebb-4c32-8041-b51ef6537940">
   SkekMal was also far braver than most of his brethren, and didn't seem to share their obsession with cheating death, being never shown trying to extend his lifespan such as Essence or the power of the Crystal and showing no fear when Ordon pushed him and himself into a field of Gobbles, saying that he's taking Ordon with him as the Gobbles trapped and bit them
   . He also had an incredible tolerance for pain and willpower, being able of taking Brea with him from the Circle of the Three Suns to the Castle of the Crystal despite having been shot with three arrows from the Archer, and how grave his injuries and the pain were until his body finally betrayed him at the castle, while UrVa himself passed out from the pain shortly after shooting his third arrow. However he was not without some fear of death as he was terrified when he realized what UrVa was about to kill himself, screaming "Archer what have you done ?! " before his final death

   Rian became skekMal's latest prey, after skekSil summoned him. He was insulted by being called to hunt a mere Gelfling, but when he informed him that he had bested both skekSil and skekTek he became intrigued. When he was told by skekSil that Rian was spreading lies about the Skeksis, he made it his personal mission to hunt the rebel.
   skekMal wished to claim Rian's "lying tongue" as a trophy.
   At every moment he took every opportunity to taunt the Stonewood warrior, reminding him of his failures, especially his father's death.

   The Hunter cared little for skekSil's politicking and squabbles in the court of the Castle, thinking them petty. However the two did find common ground in one area: while skekMal sought trophies and skekSil sought prestige, fundamentally both pursued power.

   . As the character was required in intense action scenes which would highlight his athleticism, skekMal was the only Skeksis to be portrayed via a full-body puppet. In most scenes, the suit was worn by performer Nick Kellington, while Kevin Clash was in charge of its mouth movements. In fight scenes, stuntman Ian Kay took over the role in a suit sporting a head lacking animatronic components, thus reducing the puppet's weight.
   The Hunter's retractable arms were operated by two additional puppeteers in blue-screen suits, who were digitally removed in post-production.
