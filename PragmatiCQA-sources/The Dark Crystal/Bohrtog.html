   Unimpressed, Aughra was frustrated by the Mystics obstinacy until she spied an approaching object in the distance from a window. Thinking it was initially a comet, she corrected herself when she saw what it was and laughed gleefully calling out the old creatures to continue chanting.

   Kensho, who had been separated from Thurma and was surrounded by Jen and his guards, hanged for dear life to a branch. Just before he was about to plunge to his death, he was saved by a serpentine winged being, the benevolent creature that the Mystics brought to Thra.

   It then brought the Gelfling to Thurma, who was trapped between a river and

   . Carrying the two to safety, the creature failed to lift them both, but was strong enough to carry them over a river before crashing onto dry land. It stayed with the two at Kensho's village where they found shelter. There Thurma discovered Kensho had taken the shard, disheartened at his betrayal Thurma stayed by the fire with the creature. Her only confidant to talk to, she confessed to the creature that while she was angry at Kensho, she was also upset she was not better, as she had lied to him about the

   unharmed was nothing more than a story to get him to help her reach Mithra safety. The creature then took flight and into the air leaving the two heroes.

   When Skeksis and Mystics were once again one, bringing an end to the crisis, Kensho was also revived thanks to the power of the Crystal. Reuniting with Thurma in Mithra, the creature reappeared to bring the Gelfling back to the surface.

   Bohrtog came to live in the Castle, becoming a friend to the new leader Kensho though he was feared by many of the Gelfing pilgrims due to his intimidating size. Originally kept in the Castle's stables, he became friendly with the news stable-hand,
   Toolah
   . Later he would join Kensho and Toolah on the former's new quest to spread the wealth of the Castle to the needy outside its walls.
