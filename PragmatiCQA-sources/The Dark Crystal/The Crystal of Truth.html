   The Crystal of Truth was quartz-like in shape and was rhomboidal at its top and base, with a threefold symmetry, and was suspended in midair by its own gravity.

   hypothesized, in the absence of physical samples, that it was made of a high
   quartz
   , and deduced that it possessed an asymmetrical molecular structure. This would have granted the Crystal the ability to selectively absorb polarized light and thus excite Thra's rarer elements.

   .
   When one or more of the Brothers hung directly overhead, the polarized power emanating from them would untwist the Crystal's spiral linkage and produce a focused and intensely concentrated beam.
   Direct exposure to such a beam had healing properties.
   Surplus energy from the beam would be distributed throughout Thra via a network of crystal veins
   and be converted into

   Damaging the Crystal would prevent its spiral linkage from untwisting, causing it to develop a wine-dark color and entrap purely malevolent energies,
   which would manifest throughout Thra in the form of the
   Darkening
   .
   Preventing it from sustaining itself with the light of the Three Brothers would, furthermore, cause the Crystal to extract energy from the essence of living creatures in its vicinity.
