   Nevertheless, the utility of the Garthim was limited due to their ponderousness. While effective in guarding the Castle, raiding villages and sowing destruction, their lack of agility prevented them from jumping,
   and the rattling sounds they made when in motion would give away their location.
   Their intelligence was also extremely limited, with Aughra describing their stupidity as "incalculable",
   as they lacked autonomy and were incapable of strategizing outside of pre-established orders.

   The Garthim's sole purpose was destruction, and would follow orders from their Skeksis overlords without question. It was unknown whether or not they could kill a Skeksis if ordered to do so by another, but skekUng planned to test this when he suspected skekTek of betrayal. They could also be controlled by the
