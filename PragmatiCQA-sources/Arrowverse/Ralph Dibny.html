   , was the prime suspect.

  <p key="406d9bb5-3f78-4a31-84e0-bf60047fddc6">
   Convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that the husband was the perpetrator, but had intentionally and so cleverly arranged the crime scene so that all suspicions would be diverted away from him, Ralph instead planted evidence - a knife with Reagan's fingerprints - to "frame" the suspect for murder. However, Barry Allen (who went through something similar with what happened to his parents and thus; adhered to get the truth out more than anyone) determinedly sought to prove Ralph's fabrication and ultimately testified against him, after inspecting the knife and determining it to be a fake murder weapon.

  <p key="aa25288f-18f5-4943-bbb4-056894b8d300">
   This led to Ralph being dishonorably kicked off from the police force for good and drove a deep wedge between his once-good and working professional relationship with Barry, who was left with the belief that Ralph did what he'd done not for justice, but for the glory of it and this threw away what viable respect that Barry once had for his disgraced former superior. Barry's mentorship under Ralph ended on bad terms and vice-versa.

   Ralph spent years telling himself that he was doing the right thing, during this time, his friends, family and associates severed him from their lives and he eventually realized he did the wrong thing, and by breaking the law to achieve what he wanted, even if it was a noble cause; he became the very thing from which he swore to protect the citizens of Central City from.

   On October 10, 2017, Ralph was on the
   bus
   that was exposed to
   dark matter
   particles resulting from Barry Allen's return from the
   Speed Force
   . Ralph did not exhibit his powers immediately after that, but took a few weeks. He was visited by Barry and
   Joe West
   regarding if he had been on the bus that day, but gave them no information since Barry still has Ralph's ire. Soon after Barry and Joe left, two thugs came to Ralph's office. They hung him by his legs off the top of an establishment to intimidate him, inadvertently causing Ralph's powers of elasticity to manifest and allowing him to descend safely from that height, albeit with his lower limbs now rubbery and exceedingly stretched beyond the limits of their original design. He was later brought into S.T.A.R. Labs where Team Flash there did preliminary tests to his new attributes, all of which greatly disturbed Ralph who just wished to return to normal, but could not as he was still new to his meta-human abilities, preventing him from deliberately returning his outstretched extremities back to their default state.

   A serum administered by Caitlin soon gave Ralph a measure of control, but was told that the concoction had not fully reversed his new condition instead rather only made it more manageable, which Ralph quickly realizes when he successfully lost weight upon visualizing it - finally letting him see (and beginning to appreciate) the perks of his meta-human condition and most-recent development. Ralph later met with the mayor, recanting his blackmail and returning the photos he took. He was shot by Bellows, only for both of them to find that his powers made him bulletproof. When the Flash came to save him and apprehend Bellows,
   Breacher
   appeared to attack him, as he mistook Ralph for one of the
   elastic invaders
   that ravaged his
   planet
   , so the Flash stopped him as well. While the mayor escaped with Joe on a helicopter, Barry revealed himself to Ralph and implored him to use his powers for good, so Ralph stretched an arm to reach the chopper from afar, allowing Barry to run up and save Joe. In the end, the two reconciled. Barry offered Ralph a place on
   Team Flash
   , which Ralph considered. When Barry, out of interest, asked him about his motive for investigating Bellows, Ralph revealed that a client requested him to investigate the mayor over the phone, going by the last name
   DeVoe

   to find; she quickly scoots, unsure of what to make of the spectacle she was witnessing. When Barry and his friends were throwing him a bachelor party, Ralph decided to crash it but was disappointed that it was simply them sitting at Joe's home and watching home movies. He decided to treat them to a true party and took them at his favorite strip joint, The Golden Booty. They then toasted to Barry getting married to Iris. Ralph started to fool around with his powers, lifting some money from people's wallets though he claimed he was only getting change. Cisco warned him about not showing off his powers so blandly in public though Ralph just pointed off to Barry who was telling people he was The Flash while intoxicated. One of the patrons then accused Ralph of stealing from him and then took a framed photo of him and smashed it in retaliation. Ralph called him a monster and jumped at him, sparking a fight through the entire place that ended up with them getting tossed in jail.
   Harry
   soon arrived and Barry, Joe, Cisco, and Ralph (by default) were released. Ralph returned to the labs with Barry and Cisco and they were taken by Iris to see

   Barry began to train Dibny as a superhero, though it didn't go without some good-natured, back-and-forth banter and bickering between the two of them. In their civilian guises, they eventually bump into an armed robber (who had the unfortunate mishap of attempting the same on Barry around three years ago) after buying some coffee. Deeming the
   mugger
   and the gun he was brandishing towards them as no particular threat, the two metahumans turned their backs and plotted on how to deal with the robber; this leads to a very comical situation where, tired of being ignored, the mugger tried to prove his point by using his gun on Ralph — only for his elasticity to cause two bullets from the mugger's gun to ricochet back into his leg and backside. Subsequently, Dibny was taken to
   Sharon Finkel
   , a hypnotist, to recover his lost memories help identify the other bus metas. The best Dibny could do was recall a woman with a black bison on the back of her jacket. Soon enough, the two superheroes confront
   Mina Chaytan
   , whom Barry allowed escaping while he saved the man she was attacking from a knight statue brought to life by Mina's powers. Dibny questioned why Barry would allow the criminal to escape, as it should be well within Barry's abilities to simultaneously save the innocent and catch the perpetrator (and not necessarily in that order) though Barry argued saving the lives of other people comes before catching the bad guy.
  </p>
  <p key="489dae46-2c9f-46a1-84a6-4305a9e95fb7">
   Pursuing Mina once more, Dibny chose to prevent her from leaving by holding her car in place with his arm while Barry was fighting a caveman statue. This also caused Dibny to neglect falling debris in the ongoing chaos as a utility pole fell on a young girl. Dibny is wracked with guilt that his actions could have killed a child and admits he's never had to care for other people before since being a private investigator is so simple. Barry promises to be there for Dibny as a friend and that the job is always going to have its hard days. At a museum chasing down Mina, Dibny redeemed himself by choosing to save a night guard from a T-Rex statue over catching Mina, and paid the cheap price of becoming the said extinct dinosaur's chew toy, only spared because of Ralph's rubber-like physiology nullifying the skeleton's biting force, keeping its teeth from biting and actually cutting through him. Ralph then uses his own body to wrap around the skeleton cadaver's maw, keeping it from harming anyone or anything else in the museum. Later that day after Mina's re-capture, Dibny visited the young girl who had been injured in the accident and cheered her up by making balloon animals with his hands and feet.

The tension grew until it finally led to an argument between Ralph and Cisco, who reminded him that if Caitlin hadn't offended Caitlin, she wouldn't have gone to CC Jitters and she wouldn't have been kidnapped. After a few hours, Ramon apologized to his friend, when Iris interrupted their sincere conversation about their friendship, ordering them to focus on Caitlin and give up on Barry, believing that he was smart and would manage. As planned, the heroes found their friend's location, so Dibny and Vibe entered the fight, defeating

   Following the recent events, Barry Allen's trial of the alleged murder of Clifford DeVoe began. Barry was under house arrest for the duration of the trial, but thanks to Cisco hacking the bracelet, the scientist could appear in S.T.A.R. Labs and chat before hearing with friends about the Thinker plan. After the conversation, Joe asked Ralph for a favor - he wanted to use his detective specialties. They watched
   Marlize DeVoe
   's house closely until they finally took pictures of the woman kissing Dominic Lanse. The men immediately brought the evidence to court, but it was not enough to acquit Allen. In this regard, Joe asked Dibny for another favor - desperately asked him to break into the DeVoe house so he could plant evidence against Thinker. Ralph opened the door but didn't release West until he explained to him that he would have to live with it and become what he was trying to fight. This made the policeman understand that there are other ways to help Allen through these difficult times. A few hours later, Allen was forced to return to court, where he was soon found guilty of what he had done and immediately sent to

   Dibny set about stopping the terrorist who took the hostages and threatened to activate the bomb. The hero stood in the way of
   the bomber
   in a funny but dangerous way, destroying his bomb as soon as the civilians were saved. As soon as he returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, the team again began looking for evidence that would acquit Allen. They couldn't take it long because the
   young Trickster
   escaped with the help of
   his mother
   . As soon as the criminal challenged Dibny to fight, the hero moved faster to the place. There, however, it turned out that the enemy had prepared a special acid that could seriously injure and even kill Ralph, which forced Vibe to quickly intervene and run away with his friend. The criminals, however, were not enough, because they kidnapped hostages and planned to use their acid on them, again challenging the hero to a duel. As Dibny began to fear for his own life, Killer Frost and Vibe entered the fight as Harry tried to neutralize the enemy's deadly agent. Meanwhile, Ralph broke into Barry's prison cell, eager to find out what motivated him. Thus, he gained the strength and motivation to go to the rescue of his friends, using a new suit. After all the criminals were defeated, the team returned to the lab where Ralph survived giving a new nickname - Elongated Man.

   The team was still looking for a way to get Allen out of prison when it turned out that
   Cecille Horton
   's body activated some meta-genes during pregnancy, which interested the heroes. Their thoughts were interrupted by a message from Barry, who asked the team to help prove
   his inmate
   's innocence. Searching for the real perpetrator of the murder from years ago, the heroes came across
   Sylbert Rundine
   , who quickly turned out to be guilty. Unfortunately, he was a meta-human, which allowed him to shrink Dibny and Cisco. The men's cells began to disintegrate slowly, not being used to this size. In addition, Harry's "tricks" did not work until after a few hours he realized that in order for the men to return to their original size, they had to be shot again by the enemy's beam. Thus, Harry risked his life and stood in the line of fire, successfully saving his friends and capturing the criminal.

   Ralph, entering his office, sensed an old acquaintance of his presence,
   Earl Cox
   , who offered him a well-paid job. The man told him that he wasn't like that anymore and that he had new friends who care for him. Hearing it. Cox described Dibny as a person who loses everything - even loved ones, while stating that he is not a good friend. After these words, Earl left and Ralph began to reflect on himself until S.T.A.R. Labs, where in anger he accidentally took the form of a former acquaintance. As if that were not enough, Cecile discovered
   Warden Wolfe
   was going to sell Barry and some metas to Amunet Black. So the team decided to use Dibny's new abilities and meet the criminal as Gregory Wolfe at her bar. All went well until Ralph lost his temper and his "assumed form" fell apart, forcing him to flee. After that, the private detective gave up and started drinking in his own office, until Caitlin visited him, who spoke to him as Killer Frost. Thus, Dibny had an idea of ​​how to get Allen out of prison. He took the form of DeVoe himself and went to the court, where he reported that his death had not occurred, and Barry was acquitted. After that, Ralph went to the
   West house
   to celebrate with his loved ones, but when he entered, they all looked at him with concern, having bad news to deliver him.

  <p key="7af20bbf-724f-4624-b1eb-191da98c99eb">
   The team, fearing for Ralph, set up a "babysitting program" for him, which consisted of watching him 24 hours a day. While being guarded by Cisco, Dibny picked up a carton of items from the bus from a lost property store that had a plate of a certain
   Izzy Bowin
   . Ramon immediately found the woman in one of the bars where she was currently touring. Barry decided to go with Ralph to the place and immediately after the concert they accosted the woman, making her case quite clear: the evil man is hunting her and wants to use her abilities. Bowin was not sure about the truthfulness of the men so she attacked them with a sound wave and ran away. Soon Dibny Ramon and Allen decided to talk to Izzy again, but this time in costumes of the heroes. Unexpectedly, the Thinker appeared on the battlefield, and to everyone's surprise, Bowin managed to injure him and provoke him to flee. Having no other choice, the heroes took the woman to S.T.A.R. Labs, where they tried to get her to cooperate by showing their true faces.

  <p key="4aadf7fe-35dc-452f-8949-238bd73a9471">
   Izzy wasn't going to give up what she had achieved for something she didn't understand, though. It was only after talking frankly with Ralph that she realized she should try. The team trained the woman to use her abilities to defeat the Thinker until Bowin hurt herself. Ralph tried to stop her from leaving, but to no avail, because she wanted to face the enemy herself, not trusting the heroes. Ramon soon tracked down the woman DeVoe was with. Despite the heroes' efforts, the woman fell into the trap of a criminal who connected her to a body-changing machine. Ralph couldn't believe what was happening as he liked Izzy a lot and broke down as he watched Clifford kill Bowin and run away with her body. Several hours later, Dibny let Allen into his office while listening to Izzy's song. The detective, realizing that his friend had lost his job, handed him a business card, "Barry Allen, Private Investigator," accepting him into "his agency". He unequivocally stated that they have three more people to find, and when they do, he will personally finish the Thinker.

   Ralph was still hiding in the lab when Harry assembled the team one morning to present them his idea to outsmart Thinker. After many sleepless nights, he had the idea of ​​creating his version of the mind cap, but Cisco was against irradiating dark matter with a scientist who had no control over his emotions. Dibny was angry that the team rejected the only plan that could save him from death, and retired to his room outside the lab. Halfway up, Iris stopped him, trying to convince her friend that he was safe. However, the latter angrily said that the woman did not know what it was like to expose herself outside the S.T.A.R. Labs, because she only risks the lives of others by being just a team leader. Soon after,
   Melting Point
   changed Barry's powers and gave them to Iris, which forced her to learn to work in the field. Ultimately, the team managed to reverse the meta-human's power by recruiting him into the team. After that, Ralph apologized to Iris for his words, and her motivational talk made him understand that it was time to go beyond the walls of the laboratory.

   Ralph and Barry trained how to behave in the confrontation with the Thinker. However, the man turned everything into a joke, which began to irritate Allen. While searching for
   Janet Petty
   , the detectives found a crime during which the Kahndaq dynasty crown was stolen, and the team considered the wanted one to be guilty. Well-meaning Ralph accidentally messed up a crime scene, which irritated Barry. When Harry identified Earl Cox's headquarters as Null's whereabouts, they both headed there. Dibny took on the look of Joe to scare a friend, setting Allen into a trap and allowing her to escape. After returning to the laboratory, the scientist suspended his friend in activities, unable to bear his disobedience. After a few hours, Barry decided to speak frankly to Ralph, who finally made him understand that he acted like this when he was nervous and had been like that since childhood, which was not easy. These words changed the perception of the man by a friend who asked him for help in capturing Null. On the spot, the sprinter ran into trouble, but he let the ally act, who successfully caught Petty and saved him. Back in the lab, the team celebrated their victory and Allen apologized for his behavior.

After a long talk with Barry, it was revealed that he wanted to stop and kill DeVoe for Team Flash. DeVoe managed to get the upper hand and was able to teleport himself to S.T.A.R. Labs and trap Caitlin (while she was in her Killer Frost persona), Barry, and Cisco. When all three of them escaped, DeVoe caught up to Ralph and made him fight the dinosaur skeleton. After defeating the dinosaur, Ralph found all of the recent metas laying on the floor dead with DeVoe now in Edwin Gauss's body. They then teleport to the Speed Lab where DeVoe caused Ralph to have an aneurysm. Ralph took the Scepter out of his chest and used it against DeVoe, then raised his hand above DeVoe one more time. When Barry went into the Speed Lab, he saw a "defeated" DeVoe and Ralph smiling. DeVoe then broke out of his cuffs and started implanting his consciousness into Ralph. When Barry implored Ralph to resist DeVoe and swore to save him, Dibny replied that Barry already had just before DeVoe finally took over his body.

   In a last-ditch attempt to stop DeVoe's Enlightenment, Barry, with the aid of
   Marlize
   and the Thinking Chair, ventured into DeVoe's mind, where he encountered Ralph's surviving consciousness. When asked how Ralph even survived, DeVoe appeared, explaining that Ralph is alive because he allowed it. Escaping the Thinker further into the mindscape, Barry explained his objective to find the good part of DeVoe that existed before the Thinker. Recalling that DeVoe was a history professor, Ralph and Barry arrive at a recreation of DeVoe's classroom, only to find the personification of the good DeVoe dead. Falling into despair again, Ralph urged Barry to leave and save his family. Barry told Ralph that he was part of that family too and refused to abandon him. He then got the idea for Ralph to regain control of his body to purge the Thinker by entering what Ralph described as the "hellmouth" to the nexus of his brain. Unfortunately, DeVoe created clones of himself to stop them. Shapeshifting his mindform into the Elongated Man, Ralph joined Barry in fighting DeVoe but their foe used his telepathy to anticipate their attacks. So Ralph told Barry to think of something else while attacking; he did so by shouting out different shrimp entrees. Ralph soon hung onto Barry like a cape as they ran for the portal and returned to reality. Ralph then took back his body and seemingly purged DeVoe. After returning to S.T.A.R. Labs, they barely had time to relax before it was revealed that DeVoe transferred his consciousness to his chair to restart the Enlightenment, but Marlize pulled out the power source, putting an end to the Thinker. Unfortunately, this triggered a literal dead man's switch as one of DeVoe's satellites began falling towards Central City.

    Earl Cox

The boys eventually decided to go infiltrate the market together with Caitlin/Killer Frost as backup, agreeing that the ends justified the means, but when Ralph recited the password, they were dropped through a hidden trapdoor, given power-dampening cuffs, and wiped off of Caitlin's GPS. They did some digging in the black market, which greatly unsettled Barry, but were eventually confronted by Goldface himself, who asked Barry and Ralph who they were. Barry called himself "the Chemist", telling a fake story of crime which convinced Goldface to let them live. He then made a deal: if Barry and Ralph helped him steal a hospital's 3-D organ printer from a lab, he would give them the field generator. Ralph asked Barry if he really wanted to accept the deal, which he believed was more than they'd bargained for, but Barry decided that he was willing to commit a crime if it meant stopping Cicada. Just as they were pulling up to the lab, Ralph tricked Barry to get into a van by himself and locked him inside. Barry begged Ralph not to go in alone, but Ralph argued that the Flash couldn't do this but he could.

   As Ralph was being taken to be killed alongside Barry, the latter escaped from Ralph's trap and knocked the henchmen unconscious. Ralph explained that stealing the organ printer was too big a crime, as the patients it was going to help were all little kids. Barry and Ralph agreed to go back in together to rescue the printer from Goldface's gang, using the "stun" setting on their blasters so they wouldn't have to kill anyone. Dodging "kill" blasts and shooting to stun, the two fought their way through the lab and were on their way to the organ printer when Goldface summoned them back to the garage. They attempted to shoot him down but were horrified to discover that he was a meta-human with a layer of literal gold under his skin. Goldface subdued each of them in turn, eventually strangling Ralph with a golden whip, but Barry used an empty "kill" gun to distract Goldface, free Ralph, and trick Goldface into electrocuting himself, knocking him unconscious and disabling his gold skin. Though they were disappointed to have lost their key to the meta-human cure, Ralph praised Barry for their success in escaping from the criminal world while leaving everyone alive, though he teased Barry for his criminal code name. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs and free from Goldface's cuffs, Ralph sat by Barry's side as Caitlin tended to Barry's wounds from the fight earlier, and Barry reminded a distraught Ralph that they'd still had a win by taking down a powerful meta without their powers, which would help them keep fighting even if Cicada's dagger dampened them. They suddenly got an anonymous call from Iris, who had sneaked into Orlin's house in search of a story for her newspaper. Back in their meta-human egos, the three joined Iris at Dwyer's abandoned house, and she revealed that she knew Cicada's weakness.

   Sue locked Ralph in the vault and took the diamond. To escape, Ralph used his powers to enter the sprinkler system of the bank; upon exiting as Elongated Man, he saw Sue surrounded by
    John Loring
    and his thugs. Before they could shoot her, the hero covered her with his body, disgusting Sue but saving her from the hail of bullets, as she changed into a
    protective suit
    of her own. The bullets suddenly stopped;
    Ultraviolet
    had knocked the foes unconscious and demanded the diamond. Ralph was knocked out of the fight and could only observe as Sue and Ultraviolet fought, because he chose to protect the bank manager from a blast sent by Ultraviolet. Sue then slid the box of the diamond to Ralph; when the assassin approached Elongated Man to get her quest, he showed her the empty container, causing her to scream in frustration and vanish. John and his thugs awakened and threatened to kill the still hurt hero, but the Flash suddenly arrived with the real
    Joe West
    and the police to stop them. The bank manager was then convinced that he had not met Joe previously.

   Ralph continued his research into Sue and realized that she was robbing banks while they were having brunches and interviewing for new investors.

   Ralph entered the investment firm while Sue was having a meeting with a financial adviser; in the process, he blew her cover identity as "Genoa" but he did verify to her that Sue was an heiress. When alone, the two talked; Sue verified that she was a thief because she was stealing anything that could help her research into
    Joseph Carver

    large diamond

    Allegra Garcia
    noted that it was emitting radiation; harnessing the energy, the diamond showed the team where a
    Black Hole
    warehouse was hidden. As he and Barry exited to go to the warehouse, Ralph got the diamond back.

   At the warehouse, the Elongated Man and the Flash saw crates of files with various names on them; one was labelled Dearbon, so Ralph was particularly interested in it. Meanwhile, it was noticed that the security guards were dead and the smell of gasoline was strong. Upon inspection, the heroes saw
    David Singh
    pouring gasoline. However, they failed to stop him and the warehouse with the files burned.

   Ralph called the parents of

   Later, Ralph joined Team Flash as the bodyguards of

    Eva McCulloch's team

   Ralph went to see Sue, who was jubilant that Carver was dead, because she believed his threat to her and her parents was now over. Ralph showed her

   Ralph decides that he needs to find evidence that Sue is innocent of killing Joseph Carver; opportunity arises when a city-wide blackout is created in hopes of foiling Eva's plan. Ralph calculates that the forcefield around
    McCulloch Technologies

     At his introduction, Ralph was initially motivated by self-interest and would stoop to morally questionable methods in the pursuit of success; or in desperation of such, but he certainly wasn't always like that, for even before coming into contact with
      Team Flash
      , Ralph harbored an admiration towards the Flash; due to his exploits in saving Central City and its citizens from time to time, unaware that the heroic
      meta-human
      and his former subordinate-turned-nemesis were one-and-the-same; and due to their fallout, Barry himself was firm on the belief that Ralph was a corrupt individual from then and hasn't changed at all up to the present, in fact, he imposed to the other members of the team that Ralph was now a potentially more dangerous individual than before, with the hapless PI now attaining powers of his own, but soon admits it upon himself that he wanted to believe that because, ever since becoming the Flash, Barry has committed morally-gray acts in some semblance to what the ex-police detective did when Ralph framed Reagan Gimlin and that vilifying Ralph was the speedster's way of proving himself better than Ralph and justifying everything he's done so far. But in spite of his apparent readiness to walk the thin line separating lawful elements from the otherwise following his dismissal, Ralph has since proven himself aware of the difference between right and wrong.
    </p>
    <p key="8465e3ac-9a97-47e2-8bec-f937b7b618ee">
     However, Ralph was rather horrified at learning that he unexpectedly developed meta-human powers himself and, rather than immediately exploiting them for his own personal benefit like any criminal would after they stabilized, chose to keep them secret and continued on to his indentured existence as he either didn't want to be seen as a "freak" and be ruined (further) because of them - only discovering what an advantageous asset he now has after losing some weight and then surviving a bullet, at point-blank range, to the head - or perhaps that Ralph's moral standards were higher than Barry gave them credit for, if not both.
    </p>
    Ralph expresses distaste when Cisco first presented him with his own customized starter outfit to go along and optimize his elastic abilities, but later respected the suit's functionality (as it was either that or fight crime naked; Cisco begged him not to do the latter) although he did have a strong sense of justice, believing that apprehending perpetrators was the most important aspect in law enforcement duty and he was willing to go as far as to plant evidence to frame a murder suspect whom he genuinely believed to be guilty, lest the said murderer walks free. He is rather lecherous, able to quickly determine a woman's measurements and was recognized as a strip club's most regular customer. Given his fall from grace at the CCPD after Barry exposed his tampering of evidence, Ralph was also quite rude to his enemy, but ultimately Barry was able to coax him into an act of selflessness, convincing him into being a hero and moving forward, repairing their broken relationship in the process.

    <p key="24fd628d-2f69-495d-9dbb-22cf78366671">
     Upon Ralph attaining mastery over his powers, he gradually realized that with such extraordinary gifts comes with an even greater sense of responsibility, which was something that he simply just brushed off in his five years of working as a private investigator; Ralph soon learned the hard way that saving the lives of others must come before catching the bad guy as his determination to prevent
      Mina Chaytan
      's escape almost killed a young girl when a utility pole fell on her while Barry was fighting a caveman statue Mina had brought to life with her powers, showing that Ralph is capable of remorse to his own actions and sympathy towards those he fails to protect due to misusing his own abilities, and now whole-heartedly accepting that he has an entire city to look after with the advantages given to him by chance and had to receive encouragement from Barry to keep Ralph from doubting himself.
    </p>
    <p key="9eed5b7c-5ca7-4136-91ef-18535ee2a7c4">
     Ralph began to put Barry's advice to use, choosing to save a night guard at a museum from being killed by an animated T-Rex skeleton rather than pursue Mina. He then does the Sioux people a favor by delivering to them the very artifact that Mina was trying to steal, as it was rightfully theirs and later proceeded to entertain the aforementioned little girl in her hospital room using his powers.
    </p>
    <p key="76b485e9-3dd7-43c1-a5cf-2233c665eaf5">
     due to Barry's mentoring, Ralph has learned that self-interest isn't the way to go, he learns to be selfless and to help others, including his teammates, after a while, the team begin to trust him to the extent of seeing him as a rightful member of the team, when Barry is framed for
      Clifford DeVoe
      's murder, Joe pulls Ralph aside and asks him for assistance in trying to plant evidence on
      Marlize DeVoe
      , when their first attempt doesn't work, Joe tries to plant carpet fibers at the DeVoe house to frame Marlize for being in on her husband's "murder" at the West-Allen loft, the night her husband's body was found. Ralph, remembering Barry's teachings, manages to talk Joe out of planting the evidence, proving just how far he has come since he joined Team Flash.
    </p>
    Ralph is proven to have good morals, at first, he considered killing Clifford in order to prevent him from hurting anyone else, but after remembering Barry's advice, he remembered that killing his enemies wasn't the proper way.

However, as he was still unused to this new facet of his elastic capabilities, maintaining himself in the likeness of another's form taxes Ralph to the point where, apart from not being able to retain the said alternative likeness for as long as he would have liked, showing signs of gradual reversion until snapping back into his true form eventually, the assumed form also somewhat hampers Ralph's natural mobility - causing him to experience some difficulty in both movement and locomotion.

        As a side effect of his elasticity, Ralph is also rendered highly durable, mitigating any impact he may receive with little consequence as his body expands and contracts, in and out of his normal human shape, to render said impacts obsolete and even cause projectiles to bounce off from his person, after absorbing the said projectile into or through his body, and immediately rebounding it back to the direction of the source. He took no harm from a bullet to the head, and a punch to the face only inconvenienced him as his body would stretch and cushion the impact to ultimately negate it; though it was implied that certain other forms of assault could still harm him, since a Viber meta-human from

         It would appear that his insusceptibility to outward and solid physical harm is not limited to blunt assaults, since Ralph took a gargantuan bite to his outstretched torso from the teeth-filled jaws of a mobilized T-Rex skeleton without sustaining much harm to himself, despite something like that would have surely bifurcated a normal person in half. Ralph managed to withstand enough explosives to destroy a city block, though he did comment that it gave him heart burns right after doing so. Later, Ralph exhibited a marginally reasonable resilience against

         Allegra Garcia

         Cisco Ramon
         attributed entirely to his powers.
