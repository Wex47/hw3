    #1 in 1995; Neron is one of the more infamous players in DC Comics' cosmology. A demon-lord who can't resist making Faustian bargains with mortals, Neron once tried to take over the universe by gathering a mass quantity of souls, which are the currency of Hell and the source of his power. Neron approached numerous super-villains, then numerous superheroes, offering them their hearts' desire in exchange for their souls, all while plotting a way to acquire the purest soul on Earth - an object that would make Neron all-powerful. Though his scheme was ultimately thwarted, Neron has remained a power to be reckoned with in the DC Universe, always ready to make a deal with anyone desperate enough to seek his help and pay his price.
