    <p key="ab4ad287-2dfb-4bcb-9a3d-6df43e587f1c">
     As noted by Oliver, well Emiko did have every right to be angry with their father, Robert for abandoning her as a child but he did not force her to become the monster she was today, as she chose to embrace her inner darkness, instead of becoming a hero.
    </p>
    However, Oliver's repeated attempts to appeal to Emiko eventually partially got through her, as she seemed to be unwilling to kill him when he offered her a chance to do it. As she saw Oliver refusing to leave her behind, before Emiko succumbed to the injuries she received from Beatrice, she showed regret over how she had made him, Felicity and their child targets of the Ninth Circle and used her last moments to make peace with her half-brother, Oliver, warning him to get his family to safety and revealing despite her hatred of the Queen family, she wanted to be a member of his family.

    In the main DC comics continuity,
    Robert Queen
    had an affair with
    Shado
    , resulting in the birth of a daughter named
    Emiko Queen

    Simon Lacroix/Komodo
    as an infant and raised as an assassin before learning her true origins. Emiko eventually became known as the new Red Arrow and also, at one point, she took on the identity of Green Arrow after her half-brother, Oliver Queen.
