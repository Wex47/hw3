   Jefferson was born on September 12, 1974,
    to
    Alvin Pierce
    . At one point Jefferson was given a vaccine by his father, which Alvin later found out was tainted, this would eventually be how Jefferson would get his powers. One day, a young Jefferson was walking home with Alvin from work who told Jefferson "The future belongs to those who prepare for it today”, to which Jefferson then jokingly told him that the quote was by Malcolm X. Alvin then noticed
   Peter Gambi
   waiting on the side of the street. Alvin then told Jefferson to go wait in the car and while Alvin talked to Gambi, Jefferson watched in the car from afar. A few days later, Jefferson got into a fight at school, which ended with Jefferson breaking someone's nose. Afterwards, Jeff was suspended from school and picked up by Alvin, who lectured Jefferson on what he did. Alvin then went back to work and told Jefferson to read the entire constitution, in order to make sure that Jeff didn't spend all day watching TV and that he would quiz Jefferson at dinner.
    One night, Jefferson watched as
   Tobias Whale
   murdered his father.
    Later, a heartbroken Jefferson attended his father's funeral to mourn him, all while Gambi watched from afar. One night, when Jefferson was twelve, he took part in a riot, which he was chased down an alley by two SWAT officers and accidentally set off his powers for the first time, knocking out both of the officers. Jefferson than ran down another alley and was knocked unconscious after absorbing electricity from an electric fence. He was then found in the alley by
   Peter Gambi
   , who discovered Jefferson's powers and then began raising Jefferson, while keeping Jefferson's powers a secret from him. After this, it would be 15 years before Jefferson's powers fully manifested.
    In order to deal with the recent loss of his father, Gambi helped Jeff distract himself from it by learning about history.
    At some point, he became friends with a man name
    Two-Bits
    .
  </p>
  <p key="9640f344-8c95-4c4a-94bd-f8fa8715746e">
   At some point, Jefferson was trained in fighting and tactics by Gambi. Eventually, he discovered that he had powers, after this he "did a few things here and there", before he became Black Lightning, it "took him a while before he committed and got the suit".
   In his youth, Jefferson earned a gold medal at the Olympics.

  <p key="1e889acb-c20d-4068-a4de-c20b2acb4457">
   Pierce would be in his hometown,
   Freeland
   , living with his wife,
   Lynn Stewart
   , and their two daughters,
   Anissa
   and
   Jennifer
   . He initially kept his powers a secret, with only two people knowing the truth – his wife, Lynn, and his friend,
   Gambi
   . With the rise of the criminal gang
   The 100
   , Jefferson eventually saw that the people of Freeland were losing hope, Jeff then realized that with the use of his powers, that he could provide the hope Freeland had lost.
   He would be aided by Gambi who created
   his suit
   .
  </p>
  <p key="c3bdb7d4-8f84-4d0e-be86-eba542fff6c3">
   Years of fighting The 100 took its toll on Jefferson and his family, and Lynn implored him to give it up. Jefferson decided to retire as Black Lightning to focus on his family, although Lynn ultimately divorced him. Jefferson refocused his efforts on educating the next generation as principal of
   Garfield High School
   in 2011, telling himself that he saved more lives that way than he ever did as Black Lightning.

   At some point between 2008 and 2016, Jefferson met and shook hands with President

   In 2018, after Anissa participated in a violent protest, Jefferson went to the
    Freeland Police Department
    with Jennifer to pick her up. They made their way to a fundraiser at
    Garfield High School
    , but were stopped on their way by police, initially believing Jefferson to be a criminal from a nearby robbery. Eventually making it to the school, Jefferson was introduced by Senator
    Turner
    , before giving his own speech to motivate the students and faculty. While at the fundraiser, he talked to
   <a href="Bill Henderson.html" key="34c24d95-9978-4f6e-bcbc-b009c896ca42" title="Bill Henderson">
    Henderson
   </a>
   and Lynn, flirting with the latter. Jefferson soon headed home, finding Jennifer nowhere. He called Anissa, who explained that she'd gone to
    Club 100
    with
    Kiesha
    . He headed there, seeing her being forced into a private room. He attempted to enter the room, but was stopped by a guard, who he was forced to electrocute. He then entered into a firefight with gang members, taking them all out. As he escaped, he was stopped by police, who he was forced to electrocute to unconsciousness to get away. Injured in the fight, he went to
    Gambi's Custom Tailoring
    , Gambi patching him up. He suggested that Jeff continue the fight as a vigilante, but Jefferson disagreed. Returning home, Lynn accused Jeff of taking up the Black Lightning mantle again, but he denied it. The following morning, Jefferson went for a run, being joined by Jennifer and Anissa. Arriving at work, Pierce was met by
    Miss Fowdy
    , who told him of the board's plan to implement metal detectors in the school. Hating the idea, he asked Fowdy to pass this on to the board. After watching some found footage of himself as Black Lightning, sent by Gambi, Jefferson was pulled outside to an altercation. He prevented
    Will
    from pulling a gun out and shooting anyone, telling him to leave. After the event, Pierce reprimanded Anissa. He then headed to
   Lala
   , asking that he keep Will away from his daughters. Despite this, however, Will still returned, kidnapping them. Jefferson talked to Henderson, before heading to Gambi for a new suit, deciding to reclaim the Black Lightning title. Donning his new suit, Black Lightning made his way to the
    Seahorse Motel
    . He beat up some thugs, before electrocuting Will and dropping him on his car. Jeff then headed home to see Anissa and Jennifer and comfort Lynn.

  <p key="8a11b2e1-5fcd-43dd-8186-571614564650">
   Sometime following, Jefferson woke up with lightning coursing through his veins, causing him immense pain. He was found on the floor by Lynn, who comforted him, reminiscing of their earlier years. The following morning, Jefferson talked to a group of parents at Garfield High, reassuring them that their kids would be safe from
   The 100
   . He was interrupted, however, by
   Lawanda White
   , who talked about her daughter,
   Shaquandalyn
   , who'd been kidnapped by the gang. She asked Pierce if he could go in and rescue Shaquandalyn, but he refused. After that, he walked with
   <a href="Bill Henderson.html" key="56bbda98-0628-4790-8a4f-9521d8b215a2" title="Bill Henderson">
    Henderson
   </a>
   , scolding him for letting the
   Seahorse Motel
   reopen, as well as for letting
   Will
   escape. Later that day, after Lala sent Malik to scare Jennifer, Jeff approached Lala, threatening him. Jefferson was beat to the ground, but decided not to use his powers. Jefferson headed to
   Gambi's Custom Tailoring
   , where Gambi encouraged him to take vigilantism back up, but Jeff emphasized that he only wished to take down Lala for good. That night Henderson stopped by Jefferson's house, checking in with him and letting him know that Lawanda had posted herself outside of the Seahorse Motel. The following day, Jefferson headed to the motel, imploring that Lawanda stop before she was hurt. He offered her 48 hours to help. That night, Jefferson walked in on Lynn and they discussed their girls, before sharing an intimate moment. Later that night, however, Jefferson was called by Henderson to tell him that Lawanda was dead. Angry that acting as a civilian had done nothing, he definitively decided to become a vigilante again. The morning after, Gambi called, having found Will's body. The following morning, having looked through Will's phone, Gambi gave Pierce Lala's address. That night, Black Lightning stormed the building, climbing the stairs and knocking out all of Lala's security. Finding Lala, he began beating him, only to be stopped by a squad of police, led by Inspector Henderson. Black Lightning ran for the ledge, jumping over it. Jefferson returned home, letting Lynn know it was over. She questioned whether he was going to remain a vigilante, to which he replied he would, causing her to leave. He later reminisced over old photos of Lynn.

  <p key="31bb35e2-24f2-43b5-8c4b-0a02d44d9667">
   Jefferson attended Lawanda's funeral at
   Freeland United Methodist Church
   , listening to Reverend
   Jeremiah Holt
   's request for people to march against The 100's tyranny. Following the service, Jeff and Henderson followed Holt around, trying to dissuade him from doing anything, but he refused. He left, going to Gambi's to try out modifications to his Black Lightning gauntlets. Initially he had no luck, but he persisted. The following day, Jefferson talked with Henderson in the halls of Garfield High. The inspector informed him that only a single police car could work the march, which angered Pierce. Because of this, Jefferson conferred with Gambi, who he asked to put up roadblocks to divert the crowds to minimize chaos. He returned home to have dinner with Lynn and Jennifer, the latter of whom told her parents that she wished to have sex with
   her boyfriend
   that weekend, which left both parents at a loss for words. Lynn met Jeff in his office the following day, offering to talk to Jennifer, while Jeff would talk to Khalil. Stopping him in the hall, Jefferson asked Khalil how he showered, requesting every detail, using it as an allegory for having sex with his daughter, leaving Khalil dumbfounded. That night, Jefferson and Gambi conferred, discussing their course of action during the march. Jeff suited up and headed out, watching the crowd from a rooftop. He noticed one of
   Tobias Whale
   's gunmen approaching, jumping down and using his powers to deflect bullets. He was able to knock the man out, only for the crowd to begin singing "Amazing Grace". During this time, Tobias rounded the corner, having his henchwoman shoot at him, instead hitting Reverend Holt and Khalil. Ensuring Holt was okay, Black Lightning escaped. Jefferson then made his way to
   St. Lewis Hospital
   , where he sat with Lynn while their daughters sat together. Later that night, Jennifer joined her family after having talked to a doctor, explaining that Khalil would likely never walk again.

   Jefferson arrived at school one morning, being alerted to a commotion in the toilets. He came across a high, temporarily superpowered
   Bernard Lewis
   . He was forced to use his powers to electrocute Bernard, barely knocking him unconscious, finding the drugs. Jeff conferred with
   Gambi
   , who recognized it as
   Green Light
   . Jefferson went to check on the family, before hitting the streets as Black Lightning, getting the location of its supplier,
   Two-Bits
   , from a low-level thug,
   Block
   . The following morning, Jefferson had a meeting with Bernard and
   his father
   , along with Vice Principal
   Fowdy
   , ensuring them that he would protect Bernard from expulsion. Bernard gave up his dealer's name,
   Ronald Wright
   , only for Gambi to inform him that Wright had overdosed on his own drugs. That afternoon, Jeff sat with Lynn as Jennifer came home, suggesting that she stop seeing
   Khalil
   , as she already had enough on her plate. Later on, they hosted
   <a href="Bill Henderson.html" key="06bfb972-7b4d-4369-b689-e4dd36907a94" title="Bill Henderson">
    Bill
   </a>
   and
   Veretta Henderson
   for dinner. After Anissa went to leave, Jefferson check that she was okay, to which she replied affirmatively. Later, Jefferson visited Two-Bits at
   Tanner's Taphouse
   , asking that he stop dealing Green Light. Refusing to do so, Jeff returned as Black Lightning, striking fear into him, before knocking him out. The following morning, Jefferson was given an ultimatum by the school board: retain his final say on misdemeaning students and allow Bernard to be expelled, or be given an equal vote amongst the board along with Bernard's staying; ultimately, he chose the latter. That night, Black Lightning tracked down a warehouse with supplies of Green Light. Initially intending to investigate it, he heard what he thought to be explosions. He went to investigate, but found nothing but overturned cars and a cracked pavement. The following morning, Jefferson headed to the hospital to comfort
   Khalil's mother
   . They were then given news on Khalil's permanent paralysis, which he delivered directly to Khalil. In his office later, Jeff called Lynn to discuss the situation, but she ended their call short. He then received a call from
   Mr. Lewis
   , who told him that he'd followed Bernard to a dope house, where Bernard had hoped to get another fix, only for his father to be beaten up. Black Lightning headed there, beating up all of the thugs and rescuing Bernard. In the morning, Jefferson ensured Mr. Lewis that his son would get the right treatment and be set on the right path. After he left, Jeff received a call from Lynn, apologizing for hanging up and admitting her love for him.

   Gambi installed a feature into Jeff's vigilante suit, which allowed him to hover in the air. He tested the feature out, before noticing two cops pointing their guns at a man high on
   Green Light
   . He flew down to stop them shooting him, electrocuting the man to unconsciousness, suggesting they use their tasers first in future. He later went to a drug store, where a man attempted to return an empty bottle of medicine. As the cashier couldn't do anything about it, Jefferson offered to buy the man the medicine, asking only that he show someone else good will in the future. He suddenly suffered an intense pain in his head, but he recovered. Returning home, Jefferson received a text from Gambi with an address. Black Lightning headed there, finding a space full of chemicals used to make Green Light. The owner appeared, pointing a gun at Black Lightning, but the vigilante knocked him down, making him name his supplier,
   Joey Toledo
   . Jefferson returned to Gambi's, yelling at him for not telling him of Toledo's return to Freeland. Gambi claimed to not have known, but Jefferson continued to yell, before collapsing mid-sentence. Finally waking up, Lynn was there, making him promise to not go after Joey until they could determine what was wrong with him. Jefferson went home to rest, where Jennifer asked him about some of his father's research, but Jefferson simply shot down his ideas, claiming them to be "wild". Soon after, Jeff went to Henderson's car and put a phone in it. He waited for Henderson to arrive, telling him of Joey Toledo's return and asking him for a location once Henderson had found him. The following morning, following Jennifer having had a fight with
   Lana
   , she and
   her mother
   and
   aunt
   arrived at the Pierce residence, hoping to settle things. They adults eventually made amends and ended in friendly conversation. After they left, Lynn scolded Jennifer for her actions, though Jefferson was impressed that she'd taken on two girls at once. Despite this, however, he later instilled that fighting should only be defensive, not offensive. That night, Henderson called, giving the location of Toledo's girlfriend,
   Caroline Brown
   , and also potentially Toledo himself. Jefferson headed there, despite caution from Gambi, and found Caroline. She hesitantly handed over her phone, which he used to lure Joey out. The two engaged in combat, but Toledo gained the upper hand when Black Lightning once again suffered shooting pains in his head.

   Attempting to use some lightning to escape, Jefferson passed out. He was quickly rescued by Gambi, who took him back to his shop, where Lynn again helped tend to him. Once he awoke, Lynn admitted that he was fine by that point. He attempted to sweet talk her, but she burst out in anger, admitting frustration at always having to see him bruised and bloodied. The following day Jefferson once again picked Anissa up from the Freeland Police Department following a protest, causing him to snap and lecture her on living as a black woman in America. That night he went to Gambi's, where Gambi explained the problems he'd been having as a result of having the resistance in the suit too high. The following morning Jefferson researched albinos, discovering that they had to have regular medical checkups. Because of this, he found Tobias Whale's doctor,
   Henry Mayfield
   . He confronted him as Black Lightning, asking him to help stop Whale, giving him a phone to keep in contact. The next day at school, Vice Principal Fowdy showed him a social media post mocking his daughter by her own boyfriend. Angry, he found Jennifer on her own. He cheered her up, offering some words of inspiration. He subsequently took her to see Khalil, but they quickly left after Khalil was only bitter. That night, Jefferson planted himself above Dr. Mayfield's practice, watching as Tobias and his associates got out of their car. Gambi attempted to plead with him, but Jefferson was adamant. That was, however, until Gambi patched through Lynn. She reasoned that their daughters needed him, before some thugs broke into her work, causing him to shift his focus. When he showed up, he saw a
   costumed vigilante
   , seemingly the previous thug. The two fought, Jefferson eventually gaining the upper hand, before he realized it to be his own daughter, Anissa. They had Gambi rush her home, where they tended to her wounds. As she woke up, she was shocked to see her father in his
   Black Lightning suit
   .

   The following morning, Jefferson accompanied Lynn to
   Freeland Police Department
   as she was questioned on the break-in. Inspector Henderson questioned Jefferson as to whether anyone might want to hurt him, being a prominent figure in Freeland, but he feigned having any idea. As Jeff and Lynn left, they discussed the box of research Anissa had left with Lynn, as well as Anissa's powers and the possibility of Jennifer manifesting some. Heading to school, Jefferson was called by Henderson as Black Lightning, asking if he knew of any other metahumans in Freeland, but he again feigned ignorance. Later in the day, Anissa visited Jefferson's office. She quickly suggested that they later go bust a
   Green Light
   house, but he suggested she stick to her regular life, further scolding her for leaving dangerous research with her mother without the full picture. The morning after, Jennifer sensed tension between Jefferson and Anissa, and so he claimed that it was simply the result of him missing an appointment with her. That night, Jefferson comforted Anissa after she discovered
   David Poe
   to have been killed. He received a call from Lynn, hurrying over to Gambi's. While there, Lynn requested that he train Anissa, viewing it as a form of protection, but he was hesitant. Later, Black Lightning met with Henderson, who revealed the likely location of Tobias, at the jazz club
   555
   . The vigilante headed there, ambushing Tobias and his crew. He blasted a few, accidentally redirecting one man with a machine gun. As most of Tobias' crew escaped, he attempted to help
   Tori
   , who had sustained a hit. She refused to believe, instead dying. Jeff headed home, where he vowed to help train Anissa. He suddenly received a call from Henderson,
   Lady Eve
   having been electrocuted to death, the inspector believing the kill to have been done by Black Lightning.
  </p>
  <p key="ac646a04-1374-4600-b667-cef79b022fd0">
   Jefferson began training Anissa, informing her that they needed to clear Black Lightning's name before he could get back in the suit. He returned home, reminiscing with Lynn about Anissa had always been stubborn. Shortly after, Jeff and Anissa made their way to
   Freeland City Morgue
   , directed by Gambi, finding the body of
   Lady Eve
   , complete with burn marks made with something nuclear. Tracking radioactive signatures around Freeland, Gambi pinpointed the weapon in
   Hampton Woods
   . Jefferson and his daughter went to investigate. Initially finding the weapon, they noticed someone coming. They hid, before Jefferson attempted to sneak up on the man. Noticing the weapon to be about to explode, Anissa ran for her father, tackling him over and covering him from the blast. They returned home, Jefferson pumped up on endorphins that his daughter had saved him, but this was quickly cut short when Lynn told him to talk to Gambi, who she claimed to have not told them everything he should have. Heeding her advice, Jefferson headed to Gambi's apartment, where he revealed his true name to be Peter Esposito, and his role in Jefferson's gaining powers. Angry at Gambi, Jefferson told him to stay away from his family, threatening him.
  </p>
  <p key="c8b38ce2-cca7-485c-8039-7522f52ffc8c">
   Angry at Gambi, Jefferson began to box, breaking the punching bag with some lightning. He called Henderson, asking him to help with getting rid of Green Light permanently. Returning home, Jefferson stopped Jennifer in her tracks, having just learnt of Jefferson and Jennifer's roles as superheroes. He and Lynn scolded Anissa for having something so disrespectful as tell Jennifer, before reassuring Lynn in private that he would always be there for both of their girls. Jennifer came back into the room, she and Jeff deciding to find the connection between Green Light and a vaccine containing its active ingredients. They went to public records, finding bank statements from
   BendsCORP
   , who had been wiring monthly payments to a company called
   Onshore, Inc
   . From here, they masked themselves and paid
   Teddy Evans
   a visit, threatening his family's life in order to gain his documents on BendsCORP. Using this information, they went after a lead,
   Martin Proctor
   . Anissa was late, but she wore
   a new suit
   , which impressed Jefferson. They went to a location, watching as Proctor entered the building and left. They followed him, entering a Green Light laboratory and destroying it, with Proctor getting away. Returning home, Jefferson apologized to Jennifer for having kept the Black Lightning secret from her. As he went to leave, she suggested they watch a movie,
   <i key="d3495fb0-1de4-47d1-b96a-9c3bbd8507ab">
    Princess and the Frog
   </i>
   , to which he agreed.

   Having investigated the situation herself, Anissa went to Jefferson after having discovered a warehouse containing meta-humans in powered containers, figuring that they were the missing children from thirty years prior. The two suited up, heading back there, but they had gone, leaving only traces of having been dragged out. Realizing it to be an ambush, Jefferson protected the two of them in time, before Anissa helped to take the enemy down. Returning home, Jefferson explained to Anissa how the people, including himself, got their powers. Realizing the stakes, Anissa attempted to convince Jeff that they needed Gambi's help, but he just suggested they sleep. The following morning, Jefferson was visited by
   Two-Bits
   , who told him all about the kidnapping of
   Neema
   that he'd witnessed. Because of this, Jefferson asked Jennifer to stay home from school, with Anissa staying with her. Jefferson headed to Bowman College, where he told Lynn of his and Anissa's findings, as well as Two-Bits'. The two flirted for a bit, before Jeff left. Heading back home, Jefferson consoled Jennifer, assuring her that even though having powers was hard, it was something she'd have to work through. That night, Black Lightning ambushed Two-Bits, asking him about delivery trucks out of the city, looking for the powered containers. Continuing his search, he happened upon
   Malik
   selling drugs. He suited down, approaching Malik and offering a mentorship program the following day at Garfield High. Arriving at Garfield High, Malik initially didn't show, but eventually he did. Jefferson admitted that the mentorship was only for him, not an entire group, and so they begun. However, their session was cut short when some
   A.S.A.
   agents entered, threatening Gambi's life if Jefferson didn't follow them. Giving Malik a book of poems, Jeff complied. They arrived at the building, threatening Jefferson's life in order to get Gambi to reveal Black Lightning's identity. Jefferson caused a power outage, allowing Gambi to kill the A.S.A. agents and for them to escape. Realizing that Gambi hadn't given him up, the two mended fences, before Gambi requested that Jeff protect his family and find the spotter that was finding meta-humans for the A.S.A. Because of this, the family moved into Jefferson's childhood home.
  </p>
  <p key="92d3e4c0-9bda-4d19-9e0f-7c76cb83fd09">
   Black Lightning and Thunder went to a compound which Gambi had determined to be the location of the A.S.A.'s meta-humans, but all they found was weapons to be used against Black Lightning, which they destroyed. They returned to base, where Gambi reassured that he could still find the meta-humans based on their energy signature, before Jeff went to take his suit off. Jefferson and Anissa went home, eating food while Jeff explained how Gambi had been tortured by the A.S.A. The following morning, Jefferson stood out the front of Garfield High, greeting people as they entered the school. He stopped Anissa, asking her to keep watching over Jen. Shortly into the day, Jefferson led a student group meeting, asking what everyone was grateful for. They were interrupted, however, by police forcing themselves into Jefferson's car, allegedly finding Green Light. They also went through his office, finding more, and so arresting him. They were stopped by a group of students, as well as Jennifer and Anissa, but Jefferson asked them all to stand down. Arriving at the police station, Jeff was forced to participate in a cavity search, before changing clothes so that they could test his for traces of Green Light. After this, he was interrogated by Henderson, before the two were interrupted by
   Cayman
   , who told them that Jefferson was to be transferred as per a national security directive. Because of this, Bill visited him in his cell, asking if he knew why he was being subjected to such a high-reaching order, but Jeff feigned ignorance. Jefferson was soon exonerated,
   Glennon
   confessing to planting the drugs, as well as giving up Cayman as dirty. Jefferson was brought food by Henderson, before returning home to his family, much to their surprise. Gambi arrived and Jefferson expressed his gratitude for everything, even if he couldn't forgive some things. They went to eat, Jeff allowing Gambi to say grace.

Jeff, in turn, reveals his relation to him as Gravedigger's Markovian allies are in the process of taking Lightning. Jeff is unable to stop them as both Gravedigger and his allies disappear with Jen. Intent on finding where they've taken his youngest daughter, Jeff goes to Gambi, who provides the location thanks to help from T.C.. Brandon insists on joining him in rescuing Jen and Jeff begrudgingly allows it.

   Following the dissolution of the A.S.A. and the War for Freeland, Jefferson began to mourn Henderson's death during the conflict. Visiting his friend's grave, he envisions his father. After leaving the graveyard, Jefferson witnesses two police officers harassing a black man, having racially profiled him for carrying drugs. Jefferson electrocutes the officers in a moment of anger, quickly regretting it; he decides to alter the memories of the officers and disable the cameras in the vicinity, thereby preserving his identity. Jeff then goes to counseling with Lynn, discussing the events of last year with Dr.
   Bowlan
   . Once the session ends, Jefferson later learns about Henderson's new replacement as chief of police,
   Ana Lopez
   , on the news and that Tobias Whale has returned to Freeland under the guise of legitimacy, seemingly wishing to help the city rebuild after the war. Jefferson receives a call from Detective
   Hassan Shakur
   , Henderson's protege, who arranges to meet him. Obliging his request, Jeff is given a note written by Henderson concerning Shakur, promising that he's a good officer and can be trusted.

   At work the next day, Chief Lopez and Detective Shakur visit him while investigating a case, revealed to be the the same one he covered up the day earlier. Being informed that his license plate matches a car witnessed on camera, Jeff fruitlessly tries to lie his way out of suspicion. Later, Jeff was at the Sanctum when Jennifer was quickly brought in after being attacked by a meta-human weapon, leading to an argument between him and Anissa concerning their recklessness as vigilantes while working with Gambi to find the shooter responsible. Having suffered from the culminative events of the last few days, Jeff pays a visit to the gang member's house and begins mercilessly attacking him, rendering him hospitalised after being blinded by him.

   Jefferson later tries to convince Marcel Payton to not quit working as a teacher after his
   son
   was killed during a conflict between the
   Kobra Cartel
   , The 100 and Lightning. Going outside after work, he comes face-to-face with Tobias, who displays immunity to his electric shock blasts when being attacked by Jeff; he is then told by Tobias that his sister's death will be avenged, though he will focus on reinventing his status in Freeland for the time being. Once the confrontation is over, Jeff visits Gambi to see if he was able to find Jennifer's attacker, though Gambi, now working for weapons manufacturer
   Monovista International
   , refuses to aid him due to his recent actions as a vigilante. At home, Jeff calls Baron to receive the information from him instead. With this information, Jefferson visits the man's house and attacks him.

   The morning after, Jeff sees that Marcel has returned to work, though sees him with a black eye. Marcel lies to him after Jeff inquires on how he received it. Suspicious of this, Jeff secretly follows Marcel after work and discovers that he's been fighting in a secret club run by Lala. Jeff immediately confronts Lala, who demands that Marcel should discontinue fighting. After witnessing Marcel getting beaten badly in his next fight, Jeff offers to take his place, facing off against
   Behemoth

   Afterwards, Jeff takes Marcel to his

He later visits the Sanctum to see Gambi, who is studying one of Monovista's Direct Energy Rifles. Jeff is informed of the danger the rifles represent and willingly relinquishes his suit to Gambi to test the weapons; he reveals that Black Lightning is once again done when Gambi says he might need the suit. He explains that, after helping someone as a civilian, he feels better than he did being a vigilante. Gambi tries to remind him of the last time he quit, though Jeff doubles down and remains adamant this time. Just then, Jefferson decides to make things right with Lynn and leaves to return home to her. Upon arriving home, Jeff sees flowers and an invitation to dinner, mistakenly believing they were for him, and leaves for the restaurant. However, Jeff is shocked to see Lynn with Tobias and angrily leaves.

  <p key="1a7289bc-4ff4-4b77-9240-e347b354a9bf">
   Jefferson learned that Barry called the
   Injustice Protocol
   , which was that if one of them turned bad (like when the team faced
   Faust
   on one occasion), the rest of the team had to stop him. Understanding Barry's situation, Jefferson agreed to help his friend, but Barry wanted Jefferson to take away his powers to avoid Armageddon.

   Black Lightning saw that Barry became enraged, which caused the two to argue and have a brief fight, in which Black Lightning won. By calming Barry down, Black Lightning and his friend reconciled as he promised to help him not turn evil, but
   Despero
   showed up to kill Barry. Black Lightning,
   Iris West-Allen

   Deon Owens
   confronted Despero for Barry to go to 2031 to find out what would happen.

   Jeff cares deeply for his family and is extremely protective to a fault, as he was willing to take up the mantle of Black Lightning again once more after nine years away from it, just in order to save his daughters, Anissa and Jennifer, after they had been taken hostage by The 100.
    When Lynn was abducted by
    Markovians
    , Jeff immediately assembled a
    team
    to rescue her. As a principal, Jeff extends the same values to his students and fellow teachers, often going above and beyond to shelter the former from members of The 100 and giving aid to his co-workers whenever needed. These qualities had earned the respect of even
   Latavious Johnson
   , a former student who became the leader of The 100.

  <p key="7af62a6e-7212-4690-bcb5-433959ef3c29">
   Jeff is a very selfless individual, as he was willing to give up his say as principal, to his saying only counting as one vote, in exchange for the school board not expelling Bernard Lewis from Garfield High School.
  </p>
  <p key="1a1d8872-3109-4d7a-96e6-393e0fc32a2b">
   Jeff has a strong moral compass, as when Gambi mentioned that Jeff might have to kill a shooter in order to save a group of marchers, and while he didn't like the idea, he knew he might have to do this in order to save innocent civilians.
   He also almost crossed a line, when he was trying to kill Tobias Whale for having murdered his father, but after a talking with Lynn he remembered that killing his enemies wasn't the proper way.

   was killed, Jeff became noticeably angrier and more brutal in his vigilante activities, hospitalising multiple criminals in the process and causing the Freeland P.D. to turn on him. His relationship with Lynn had also taken a blow, causing Jeff to became more confrontational and argumentative, though it was out of love for those he cared about and would usually admit his own faults after reconciling with the person in question. Eventually, Jeff believed that he was ultimately a better man without his Black Lightning identity, a revelation discovered after helping
   Marcel Payton

        Lynn Stewart
        . His brain can pick up and use electricity the way a normal person picks up and uses a pencil or a hammer".
        Originally, he could only take electricity from its source, but could not actually generate or create electricity. Jeff later became able to generate electricity on his own, however, he requires some already-existing energy to start it up and this can noticeably exhaust him. He claims to be able to generate up to 150,000 volts of electricity,
        but with his third suit, he can generate up to 100,000,000 volts,
