   To prove himself, H.R. established the

Eventually, his training convinced Team Flash that he was ready to join Barry out in the field. He and the others presented Wally with his first

   Harrison "H.R." Wells was business partners with

   S.T.A.R. Labs
   on

   However, luck turned around for H.R.; his old friend

   cracked the cryptogram sent out by
   Harry Wells
   ,
   Cisco Ramon
   , and
   Caitlin Snow
   . Deciding to respond, H.R. sent his own
   hologram
   to Earth-1 to communicate with the cryptogram's senders. In his hologram audition, he expressed interest in helping the
   Earth-1
   heroes fight crime and find meta-humans, trying to show off his good humor. His audition was rejected by Harry, but he ended up being selected anyway.

   While trying to track down a

   Wally West
   calling him a conman, he tried to persuade

Labs by the vigilante team assisting the Flash. To give S.T.A.R. Labs a cover, he proposed turning it into a museum, with him as its charismatic director.

   H.R. was always trying to fine-tune everything for the opening of the S.T.A.R. Labs Museum, however, meanwhile helped the team fight the
   Plunder
   . When the Plunder started robbing jewelry stores in the city and Flash tried to catch him a second time, Kid Flash joined the fight, who decided to act, seeing the threat to Barry's life. This act, for unknown reasons, did not appeal to Allen, who did not want Wally on subsequent missions. As it turned out later, the hero's behavior was related to what he saw in the future - the death of Iris at the hands of Savitar. When Cisco and Barry vibed to the future in 2024, one of the headlines they saw was the closing of the S.T.A.R. Labs Museum, which H.R. wrote down in disappointment. Barry and Cisco observed a future H.R. on a nearby rooftop aiming a rifle at Savitar, seemingly confirming that the future could be changed. Knowing from the news that he saw at the stop about the intentions of the Plunder, he did not want to catch him in order to try to change the future and prevent the tragic version of events. The team decided not to lead to such an event and when the Plunder escaped, Kid Flash captured him instead of Flash, thus confirming the future could be changed.

   After all the action, H.R. was called by Cisco to the museum, where the engineer showed the man that he had brought people - mostly schools, to spread the word about the location. Cisco fixed the holographic tour guide as well. H.R. thanked Cisco for making his dream a reality and potentially change the future headline. Then they all went to a housewarming party at Barry and Iris' new home, where Wells gave them a turtle named

Gypsy would take H.R. as insurance for the fight. Cisco would eventually prevail against Gypsy. Admitting defeat, Gypsy allowed H.R.'s freedom. As Gypsy prepared to leave back to Earth-19, Gypsy asked that H.R. never return, as Gypsy would report and pretend he was killed, thus remaining unrivaled.

When The Flash and Kid Flash raced on the streets of Central City, H.R. staked a hundred dollars on Wally, and when he saw that he was doing well, he raised the stake twice without expecting him to lose. Though Barry would win the race. When a new meta-man,
   Clive Yorkin

When the team returned with Harry and the girls' sorrows were over, H.R. he caught Wally and Jesse kissing, learning that the woman wanted to stay on Earth-1.

   H.R. watched from the lab as the speedsters from S.T.A.R. Labs trained in the city streets, gearing Wally up to speed to save his sister. When it finally happened, joy ensued, and upon returning to the base, Allen announced that he had become engaged to Iris. It was then that the sprinters were forced to go to the burning building. On the way, however, Wally was attacked by Savitar, whom only the latter saw. Thus, it turned out that the young West had been seeing the enemy for a long time and was hiding it from the team. An angry Barry kicked Wally off the team for this time, saying he didn't trust him. The angry boy discovered that Allen became engaged to his sister only because they were not engaged in the future and thus could turn the tide. After all, the heroes contacted the enemy several times through Julian and found out that Caitlin had stored a piece of the Philosopher's Stone. With such an advantage, the team did not expect Wally to end it all by stealing the artifact and throwing it into the

The speedsters started to fight, but the hero eventually lost, ending up in the laboratory with a large stab wound. Jesse, unable to come to terms with the loss of her beloved, did not know what to do with herself.

   H.R. inspired the team to try to save Wally, in which Barry would visit the Speed Force ​​again. He helped Julian, Caitlin, and Cisco create a return device that would help bring Allen back to Earth if necessary. As the rescue mission began, Jesse asked the team to help target Savitar with
   his armor
   , which the team did quite quickly. H.R. he guessed that the girl wanted to defeat the enemy on her own, but her friends backed him up to prevent her from doing so. The heroine, however, was so stubborn that she took the blade and knocked out Wells, meeting Savitar soon after. H.R. communicated with her and helped her fight, explaining to her that god did not need the protection of armor. He meant that Jesse should hurt the enemy with the exposed body element. After Wally and Barry returned, the girl chose to stay through

Thus, they asked her to continue research and help in capturing a dangerous speedster, to which the woman initially agreed. Soon after, she decided to run away to think it all over, but an honest conversation with H.R. convinced her heroes to be right. Upon returning to the lab, Joe's girlfriend is found to be in trouble and Tracy must be used as bait. The plan worked, and thanks to Flash and Vibe, no one was hurt. The sight of Savitar convinced Tracy even more that he needed to help the team, which made H.R happy.

Savitar turned out to be smarter and pretended to be Allen, getting information from H.R. about the location of Iris. Tracy therefore realized that she did not have much time for destiny to be fulfilled soon. She got the device ready and with the team went to Infantino Street, where she activated the device and gave it to Flash while fighting the enemy.

    After the destruction and subsequent restoration of the multiverse, all the

      Due to H.R. and the other Wellses' consciences living in Nash's mind, they can communicate with their host in the form of illusions and hallucinations. H.R. appeared with

    , he had a deeply creative intellect. H.R. describes himself as an "ideas man", with his excellent insight into the motives and actions of others and ability to swiftly provide creative solutions to problems at hand proving useful to the team despite his inability to execute his ideas himself. He claimed to have been a key strategic consultant to
    the Flash of his earth
    during his conflict with the meta-humans, helping him capture them and was crucial to instigating the
    World War M
    that would cement the Flash's victory over the remaining meta-humans. As a best-selling author, he is very articulate, publishing many famous novels regarding his alliance with the Flash, and in an erased future, he was once again able to publish many best-selling novels on Earth 1, becoming a famous author. H.R. is also shown to be a very thorough man, as upon joining Team Flash, has studied all the files of criminals the Flash has encountered on Earth-1.
    Despite his original lack of scientific skills, he has since been improving, able to create an accurate hologram of Cisco Ramon, although it did glitch out, shouting at random intervals. While not a scientist, H.R. was an exceptionally skilled businessman and proved to be a very effective and charismatic corporate leader, being able to effectively lead S.T.A.R. Labs as both the large corporation's CEO and face for years so well he was even named Entrepreneur of the Decade by Tech Magazine, as noted by Ramon,
    designing many well-thought business plans that allowed him to conceal his lack of scientific skills for years. Even after being exposed as a phony scientist, H.R. proved his leadership skills to Team Flash, effectively keeping the team well-organized. In an alternate future, despite lacking any wealth, H.R. was able to somehow secure the funds needed to buy

      Much like Harry, H.R. Was a skilled actor. Before being exposed, he was able to pretend to be the face of S.T.A.R. Labs for years despite not understanding science at all. Using this same skill, he convinced the Earth-1 Team Flash that he was still an accomplished scientist, beating out all other versions of Harrison Wells in the recruitment process. While impersonating Iris just before his death, he managed to act like her enough that both Barry and Savitar, a future version of Barry, bought the act.
