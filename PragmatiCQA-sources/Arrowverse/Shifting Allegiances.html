   Somewhere else, Curtis and Rene head to Rene's condo, where his little girl and Dinah are holding up with an unexpected gathering. He is anxious to bring down Diaz, yet they disclose to him that since Diaz has so much force, it will be difficult to do.

   His boss comes to keep an eye on how he's adjusting, saying that the job suits Diggle, and that he has revealed to Lyla beneficial things about him, as well. He offers a lead on Diaz — a firearm lobbyist who runs weapons for The Quadrant. ARGUS has a group holding on to take her out, yet Diggle says not to, on the grounds that she may rather lead them directly to Diaz.

   At his sanctuary, Diaz is trusting that his suit will be custom fitted when Black Siren appears. He goes to kiss her, however she is disinterested; she additionally broke a date with him the previous evening to go about as his muscle at the docks.

   He discloses to her that he needs her to carry him up close and personal with Lance so they can "set out a portion of the standard procedures," and that he doesn't believe her to do it without anyone's help yet needs her to set it up. She vows to get it going.

   In a very much outfitted structure, Anatoly is viewing a ball game with his men when he sees something move over his floor. He gazes upward and the entirety of his men have been taken out by sedative darts. Oliver is there to converse with him. The Bratva man Oliver had seen had given Oliver a blade, which he presents Anatoly, revealing to him that he has been restored in the Bratva and that he would now be able to get back. He approaches Anatoly for help halting Diaz, and Anatoly stuns him with a taser.

   At the point when Oliver awakens, he is affixed to a seat, while Anatoly beverages and talks him. He says that he no longer needs back in with the Bratva, that he gave him his entire life and that they underestimated him.

   Oliver cautions him that Diaz will do more regrettable, yet Anatoly figures Diaz will make him rich. He discloses to Oliver that he can't in any way, shape or form bring Diaz down all alone. Oliver reveals to him that the group parts his center, diverting him, yet Anatoly thinks this is a silly translation.

   Back at the New Team Arrow shelter, Rene plans to get ready as Wild Dog when the group enlightens him concerning the disintegration of Team Arrow. Rene professes not to mind, saying that bringing down Diaz was continually going to come down to them.
