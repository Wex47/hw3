   Laurel Lance was born to an
   unnamed man
   and an unknown mother in
   Starling City
   , where she was raised alongside a
   younger sister
   .
   In her childhood, Laurel's father worked a lot, which caused friction between them. On Laurel's 13th birthday, her father showed up without her birthday cake from
   Carlye's
   , which he would buy every year. Upset, Laurel threw a tantrum, yelling that she hated him. Her father then went back out to get her cake, but was killed in a car accident collision by a drunk driver. Laurel was informed of the incident through a phone call that same evening, leaving her traumatized and devastated, deeply regretting her last words to her father.
  </p>
  <p key="1cecf79e-b397-4dba-ad23-849144b7e136">
   A rebellious and tricky teenager growing up, Laurel was implied to have been a mean girl, often using her beauty to get what she wanted.

  <p key="33162609-dde5-4276-80d3-62635779b05d">
   At some point during her early youth, Laurel met
   Oliver Queen
   and the two fell deeply in love. She also became close with her boyfriend's little sister,
   Thea
   ,
   and his best friend,
   Tommy Merlyn
   .
   Laurel's relationship with Oliver was not always stable though, as he once cheated on her with her sister, but she apparently managed to forgive them.
   In 2007, Oliver was killed in a shipwreck while out at sea and his father,
   Robert Queen
   , was the only survivor. This made an even more heartbroken Laurel move to
   Central City
   to start a new life. However, Laurel never truly recovered from Oliver and her father's deaths so in a downward spiral of depression, she began making a series of "bad decisions".

   Shortly after discovering her newfound ability, Laurel confronted
   Brett Collins
   , the drunk driver who killed her father and screamed at him, launching him back and over his own car. Although the man actually survived her assault and died few months later after an accident while on his porch, Laurel believed for years she had killed him, making him her first supposed victim.

   Following this, Laurel began using her powers for personal gain, becoming a criminal named "Black Siren". She soon joined

   and became one of his enforcers in
   Central City
   known for demolishing buildings. At some point, Laurel emerged as a high-ranking lieutenant of Zoom, earning enough respect from Hunter that he was willing to converse without a mask. This made her the only known Earth-2 individual to be aware of Hunter's identity and his deception as "Jay Garrick/The Flash". Laurel was also associated with
   Francisco Ramon/Reverb
   and
   Caitlin Snow/Killer Frost
   . She became aware of Reverb's desire to seize control from Zoom, but never took his claims seriously.
   Laurel also came to know of a man called
   Damien Darhk
   , whom she grew to fear and acknowledge as a terrible person.

   Mercury Labs
   and leveled the entire building, but the Flash was able to save everyone inside. Next, Laurel lured out the Flash into the streets to fight him. At first, the Flash mistook her for Black Canary, who was a friend of his, and tried to reason with her, but she simply laughed in amusement and attacked him. Laurel used her sonic cry to weaken the Flash before physically attacking and easily subduing him. Before she could kill him though,

   To prepare, Laurel dyed her hair blonde to further resemble her counterpart and learned, presumably through Adrian, of the

  <p key="53c691e6-650e-4539-a62e-2df376286abd">
   Afterwards, Laurel returned to the Arrowcave, where Felicity had just realized her deception. Relieved to finally drop her facade, Laurel attacked Felicity and Rory, sadistically expressing disappointment that she wouldn't be able to hear either of them scream because of her powers' one-sided effect. Before she could kill them, Oliver stopped her and while stunned to see Laurel attacking them, she used her scream on him to cover her escape.
  </p>
  <p key="06faf830-c87c-4e87-9ee4-1278c2c334e6">
   Laurel later met up with Prometheus, who expressed disappointment that she blew her cover so soon. When Laurel protested she could've simply killed Team Arrow, Prometheus attacked and pinned her to the ground. Holding her throat closed so she couldn't scream, Prometheus reminded Laurel that her survival was dependent upon her obedience, not her questioning. Horrified, she agreed.
  </p>
  <p key="8256d986-fd34-4e5e-97b1-e4d157a7139a">
   Laurel later called Oliver and apologized for attacking him, claiming that Prometheus forced her to do so and offered to help. While skeptical, Oliver agreed to hear her out and they met at the Black Canary statue. Green Arrow was skeptical about her story but Laurel insisted she was being used. As Black Siren offered to help however, Ragman, Wild Dog, and Mr. Terrific attacked her. Laurel used her powers to knock them all to the ground, destroying the Black Canary statue in the process. However, Green Arrow used a tranquilizer arrow to render Laurel unconscious.
  </p>
  <p key="1bc343af-4320-45e2-9946-aa9f54b3eac4">
   Laurel woke up in a meta-human cell in the Arrowcave, much to her annoyance, and insisted that she was being honest about being used by Prometheus. However, Oliver was distrustful given what Team Flash told him about her history as Zoom's lieutenant. Laurel didn't blame him for his distrust, admitting that she has made several bad choices since gaining her powers. Laurel told Oliver about her relationship with his Earth-2 counterpart and how his death sent her down that path, expressing her belief that she was no longer capable of being anything other than a criminal. Taking pity on her, Oliver tried to convince Laurel that nobody is beyond saving, and offered her protection against Prometheus if she told him what she knew about him. While Laurel was ultimately manipulating Oliver into lowering his guard, her words did appear at least somewhat genuine.
  </p>
  <p key="227efb6d-9ebd-44a8-a180-2916544f364a">
   Later when Felicity gave Laurel a glass of water, Laurel wondered what happened between her and Oliver, aware of their failed relationship. She mockingly asked if Felicity had a sister, sneering how she heard Oliver "

   sisters". Unlike Oliver, Felicity did not believe Laurel was capable of redemption and told her to get used to being locked up, to which Laurel stared at her in contempt. Suddenly, the power went out and Laurel used this opportunity to escape. Unbeknownst to Laurel, Felicity placed tracking nanites in the glass of water she drank, hoping it would lead Team Arrow to Prometheus.
  </p>
  <p key="8be0d97f-a2ff-476c-b44c-36bb04bc9cea">
   Laurel went to a warehouse to meet up with Prometheus, where they were attacked by Team Arrow. While Prometheus was occupied with Ragman and Green Arrow, Laurel incapacitated Wild Dog and Mr. Terrific before taunting Felicity about killing her too. Just then, Green Arrow appeared and begged Laurel not to, pleading that if she kills Felicity, then she truly is beyond saving. Green Arrow tried to convince Laurel she can still be who she was before she lost her family, and he could help her find that person again. Despite appearing to consider his words, Laurel simply retorted, "she was never there" and attacked Felicity but Green Arrow protected her. As Laurel tried to kill them both, Mr. Terrific used a dampening device to negate her powers and Felicity swiftly knocked her out.

The sight of Laurel threw Quentin completely off and as Thea tried to explain the situation to him, Evelyn used tranquilizer darts to render them unconscious.

   Laurel and Evelyn drove Thea and Quentin to a shipping yard, where they unloaded their captives. When Thea wondered where they were being taken, Laurel claimed it was a "surprise". She restrained Quentin in a shipping container, sarcastically calling him "Dad", though he told her not to call him that. Laurel asked if the restraints were too tight, admitting to a surprised Quentin that this wasn't easy for her, though he was unwilling to believe her. Laurel explained that she's helping Adrian because she owes her freedom to him and has been given assurances that Quentin will be spared from his agenda. Quentin scoffed at this, stating that his Laurel wouldn't be stupid enough to take Adrian for his word. Laurel agreed, acknowledging that Quentin loved and lost his daughter and how hard seeing her must be before leaving.

   A battle broke out and Laurel personally targeted Dinah. The two women fought physically until they simultaneously used their sonic screams, creating a shockwave that pushed each of them back. Laurel was knocked to the ground while Dinah crashed into some nearby pottery. Dinah struggled to get back up, but Laurel stood up with ease and taunted Dinah about thinking the latter could "replace" her. Laurel prepared to finish her off with a scream, but was knocked out by Quentin with Dinah's bo-staff. Laurel was left on the island as it exploded following Adrian killing himself to detonate hidden C4 bombs.

   Laurel managed to survive the explosions by taking shelter in the monastery. When Dinah and Quentin arrived to search for survivors, Laurel ambushed them and held a knife to Dinah's throat. Laurel planned to kill her, sadistically assuring Dinah that she would "be too dead to care" about losing her sonic scream. Suddenly, Laurel was shot by Quentin in the stomach and fell down, believed to be dead. Some time after, Laurel was rescued by an
   associate
   of
   Cayden James

  <p key="197bda5b-f227-49c8-9893-eeda5ebe0051">
   Team Arrow initially believed Laurel planned to attack the police benefit in order to get revenge on Quentin, so they set up a trap for her. However, Laurel instead attacked the lightly defended Arrowcave, where she had her men fend off Diggle and plant some explosives in place, specifically ordering for her doppelgänger's
   suit
   to be destroyed. Laurel and her group were soon attacked by Team Arrow. She and Dinah fought, but Laurel managed to escape again before being confronted by Quentin at gunpoint. Bitter over him shooting and leaving her for dead on Lian Yu, Laurel guilted Quentin to lowering his gun before smugly admitting that she would have done the same thing had their roles been reversed. Laurel was later revealed to have stolen one of Curtis' prototype

   Later, Felicity discovered that Laurel's victims were undercover agents of the International Domain Name Directory (IDND), the global internet infrastructure, and she had stolen their fingerprints in order to enter it. Believing that Cayden intended to destroy the internet, Team Arrow attacked his party at the
   International Domain Name Directory vault

   Laurel was later sent by Cayden to capture Quentin, who was accompanying Thea home after Oliver and Felicity's wedding. Laurel quickly knocked out Thea (who was still recovering from her coma) and kidnapped Quentin. Before leaving, she placed a phone into an unconscious Thea's hand, through which Oliver received instructions in exchange for Quentin's safe return. Laurel talked with a captive Quentin, though she was still angry over his actions on Lian Yu. When Quentin asked about his doppelgänger, Laurel grew unsettled and sadly revealed her father died in a car accident while buying a cake for her 13th birthday.

There, he attempted to reach out to Laurel by showing her some tapes and pictures of her Earth-1 counterpart. Quentin stated that he sees his daughter in her and believes that deep down, Laurel has her doppelgänger's good heart. Overwhelmed and upset, Laurel denied everything by declaring "this isn't [her]" and emitted a sonic scream at the projector in a panic before running away.

   Later, Laurel joined Cayden as he set a trap for Wild Dog, Mr. Terrific, and Black Canary using Vincent, who had been identified as a traitor, as bait. After creating an explosion and trapping Black Canary under some rubble, Cayden cruelly ordered Laurel to execute Vincent in front of Dinah. Despite hesitating at first, Laurel went through with it under the pressure of proving her loyalty to the cabal. She sonic screamed into Vincent's ear until his regenerative powers exhausted and his brain collapsed, killing him. Laurel and Cayden then left the scene, though she was visibly remorseful of her deed.

As she was leaving, Laurel was confronted by Dinah, who sought to kill her to avenge Vincent's death. After an intense battle, Dinah was able to overpower Laurel but Quentin soon arrived to stop her. Dinah simply used her cry on Quentin but before Laurel could retaliate, she was taken down with a trick arrow by Oliver and held at gunpoint by Diggle.

   When Oliver and the team captured the other members of the Cabal, Quentin and Dinah brought Laurel to the meeting. There, Laurel expressed her belief to Quentin that the only way to survive is to be cruel, stating that her doppelgänger died due to her naiveté.

Laurel claimed to have done so, sneering that she only regretted it because his son was "cute". Cayden angrily slapped Laurel and stated he knew she didn't, pointing out how she hesitated in killing Vincent. Unbeknownst to everyone, the bomb detonator caused Laurel's collar to malfunction, allowing her to use her powers again. Laurel used her cry on Cayden before destroying the dampener. She then used her cry on everyone else and attempted to escape, but was stopped again by Dinah. The two battled until Quentin once again tried to intervene. Dinah disarmed Quentin and used his gun to shoot Laurel, who fired her cry at Dinah at the same time, knocking the latter out. Laurel then fell unconscious from the bullet wound.

Later Diaz tortured Cartier and, after the latter revealed he and his father never talked about him to the Quadrant because he was "a nobody" an they wanted to take Star City from his hands, Diaz beat Cartier to a pulp and order him to take it to the place where the Quadrant meetings are held.

   While they were driving to the place, Laurel asked Diaz if what happened with his childhood bully, Jesse, still tormented him and he responded that it does, because he was right and he was "a loser", when she tried to cheer him up saying he was not it anymore, he told her about how he named his fear "The Dragon" and for years was everything he had but if he managed to become a member of the Quadrant he would get the enough power to not having anyone against him. Laurel compared Diaz to

   Arriving at the Quadrant's headquarters, Villa Centanni, Diaz and Laurel broke inside using Cartier as a human bomb and slaughtering dozens of their men with their bare hands and some gunshots making their way to the hall where the four leaders of the Quadrant met. Once again Diaz proposed to gave them Star City in exchange for a place in the organization and, as one of the member declared there are no free chairs at their table and

   After Jesse's death, Laurel began to avoid Diaz until he summoned her personally. Diaz announced that the new mayor, Quentin, needed to be persuaded in respecting some "ground rules", and Laurel needed to set up a meeting between them. Though reticent, she did as ordered and took Quentin to their favorite Chinese restaurant, confessing that she was sorry as Diaz entered revealing the relationship between them and telling him to sign a few documents to privately sell some municipal property. Later that night, Laurel confronted Quentin in his office in order to convince him to sign that papers, however Quentin, disgusted that she was working with a criminal like Diaz yelled at her to stop pretending she cared about him, telling her she's worse than Diaz himself and orders her to get out of his apartment before he could came back that night.

Later, she was summoned by Diaz, who threatened her to testify against Oliver during the trial, revealing he is the Green Arrow in order to have him sentenced for life or else he would have killed her; however, having found the courage to stand-up against the crime lord after an heart-to-heart talk with Quentin, and since
   Christopher Chance/Human Target

When asked what made her change her mind, Laurel told Quentin he did and that the first step to standing up to Diaz is standing up to him. Quentin advised her to leave town, but she told him that she knew what to do. That night, Laurel confronted Diaz at the docks, at first managing to overpower him and his men but ultimately being subdued as he used a power-dampening device to suppress her sonic scream, before taking her captive and telling her that his new plan is to kill Oliver and everyone he cares about, much to her horror.

   After Oliver made a deal with the
   FBI
   to help him liberate the city, Diaz called Quentin threatening him to remove the FBI or else he'd kill Laurel. After meeting, Diaz took Quentin and held him in the same cell as Laurel (who was now wearing a power-dampening collar), telling him that he only promised to give him proof of life before leaving. Diaz later returned as Team Arrow and the FBI were moving in on him, telling Quentin he was gonna shoot Laurel in front of him if he didn't comply to his terms. Laurel told Quentin not to comply to him and not let Diaz have the city, daring Diaz to shoot her believing he was bluffing. After giving Quentin five seconds, Diaz attempted to shoot her, with Quentin jumping in front of her and taking a bullet to the abdomen. Stunned, Laurel attempted to tearfully comfort Quentin, and when Diaz began to mock them, telling her he shot him where he did as a mercy so he wouldn't bleed out yet so she can get him to call the FBI and tell them to leave the city, Laurel angrily told Diaz she was gonna kill him. As Diaz was about to shoot Laurel in front of Quentin, Oliver and the FBI arrived, forcing Diaz to flee. He came up and found Laurel with an injured Quentin and Dinah told Oliver to go get Diaz, so he shot the lock off the cage where they were held captive and Dinah arrived shortly after as Laurel tended to Quentin.

   Laurel spotted up to Dinah, believing she was going to attempt to kill her again, only to be stunned when Dinah instead freed her from her collar. The two carried Quentin out of the building to safety, using their sonic screams to fend off Diaz' men along the way and Dinah handed Laurel a gun. After getting Quentin to the paramedics, Laurel headed back into the building and went to the rooftop where Oliver had nearly subdued Diaz. Diaz dared Oliver to kill him, as it was the only way to truly defeat him and knew Oliver wouldn't. Knowing Oliver wouldn't kill him, Laurel told him that Diaz was right that he'd have to kill him to beat him before blasting Diaz off the roof with her sonic scream into a river below in an attempt to kill him herself, frustrating Oliver as he knew Diaz would survive the fall and angrily scolded Laurel, who in turn told him that she had to end it and when Oliver (knowing he'd likely survive the fall) sarcastically asked her if she'd think that the fall would kill him, she coldly stated she could only hope.

   Oliver and Laurel then headed to the hospital to see Quentin, with Oliver going in to speak with him where during a conversation, finally accepted Laurel as Quentin's daughter (after denying it to him multiple times before).

Sara thanked her for calling her, and Laurel asked if it was strange for her to see her, which Sara responded that it was a little. Sara then asked if she was anything like her Laurel, which Laurel replied she hardly was at all, visibly disappointed at herself. Sara and her later walked over to Team Arrow and witnessed the FBI arresting Oliver, to Sara's confusion as he explained his deal to enlist their help from liberating the city from Diaz also involved him turning himself in in exchange for immunity for the rest of Team Arrow.

As a grieving Sara hugged Felicity, Laurel turned away visibly teary-eyed and heartbroken by both Quentin's death and potentially Oliver being taken away as a well, made even worse by how it was her actions that caused Oliver to be forced to such a condition. Later as Oliver (under the direction of the FBI) revealed his identity as Green Arrow to the rest of the world and called on his friends and allies to keep fighting to save the city, Sara and Laurel cried and mourned together as they stood over Quentin's body.

The next morning, the newly appointed Captain Dinah confronted her in her office telling her that the
   Longbow Hunters

After Dinah referred to that as a joke, Laurel told her that, regardless of what she believed, she actually loved Quentin, however she doesn't want the Department's protection. Dinah then decided to watch over Laurel by herself sitting in her office and starting to read a magazine. So an annoyed Laurel asked her to make herself useful and bring her coffee, which Dinah does in spite of her frustration, only to find Laurel gone as she returned to the office.

Dinah told Laurel she hasn't changed a bit and is still the same lying murderer, prompting Laurel to sadly responded she's not that person anymore. Laurel and Dinah break into the facility and were faced by

Laurel then opened up to Dinah, telling her that she had forgotten how it was having someone who cared about her and that losing Quentin was the worse thing to happen to her in a long time, so she understood how Dinah had felt about losing Vincent and that, despite that she doesn't expect her forgiveness she's really deeply sorry for killing him and hoped that one day Dinah could believe she's actually changed before leaving.

However, when the woman came back she revealed that they didn't allowed her to see her husband as he was moved to "Level Two" that, apparently doesn't exist. Digging in, the two women discovered that the prison claimed that Oliver had arleady used all of his visits hours of the months and was assigned to a psychological treatment held by Dr.

Saddened, Laurel came back to her office and told Felicity how her meeting with Oliver has went. Felicity tried to comfort her telling he had told so only because he doesn't know yet the new person she has become; later the two women tracked down Anatoly to the munition's plant in Orchid Bay where Diaz had left him and they rescued him alongside Rene and

   Laurel then concentrated on Oliver's appeal and, during her harangue (slightly referring to herself) she told the judge that "the hardest thing to do is to be a hero when no one expects you to be" and that, while the easier path is to be a criminal, during his time in prison Oliver Queen had nevertheless choose to be a hero. Despite all of this, Judge Napier denied the appeal request, but granted an internal investigation concerning the conditions of Slabside's inmates. Furious and frustrated, Laurel waited for Judge Napier in the parking lot outside the court with the intention to threaten her with force, only to be stopped by Dinah. Having assisted at her speech in the courtroom, Dinah is now convinced Laurel has really changed and urged her not to throw away all her hard work for a moment of rage. That evening, Laurel visited Oliver for the second time in order to inform him and this time, admitting that she has done a good job, he thanked her; however Laurel responded that she hasn't do it for him nor anyone else but herself, as she's not "his Laurel" or "the old Laurel" but just herself, and is working hard to be a better person.

   As she's leaving the visit room, Laurel got texted by Felicity who, as promised, informed her that Diaz has been caught and have been taken to the SCPD precinct. While Dragon is held in the interrogation room, handcuffed to the table and Felicity is about to shoot him, Laurel walked in and persuaded her not to do it. Diaz teased Laurel by calling her "baby" and watched the two ladies talk. Laurel revealed that she made a deal with the FBI that if they hand Diaz over, Oliver will be set free to help them in their case against the Dragon.

She is greeted coldly by everyone except for Felicity and somewhat Dinah. Felicity remind the others how they should all thank her for what she did to set Oliver free. Then Oliver genuinely thanked her again, apologizing for not having given her the benefit of the doubt, causing her to joyfully smile and tell Oliver that his wife never gave up on stopping Diaz. She then listened to Oliver's speech on prison reform before the gala was attacked by someone impersonating the new Green Arrow.

Laurel stated that she believed vigilantes cannot work alongside the legal system and that if they were doing the right thing they would not need to wear masks; however, given that she was posing as her Earth-1 doppelgänger, it's likely that this was just a part of her cover story rather than her real opinion.

Laurel however was skeptical in doing it, as she would be a prime suspect and deep down had grown fond of her DA position, not wanting to pay the price of losing everything for someone like Diaz. Felicity pointed out that it's worth the price as she needed to protect her family, to which Laurel responded that she know she was pregnant, having deduced it by the fact that she wasn't drinking alcohol nor coffee as well as consuming lot of chocolate, prompting Felicity to ask her not to tell it to anybody else, as she has yet to reveal it to Oliver, to which Laurel promised.

Although initially hesitant Laurel accepted the woman's offer and they planted an explosive into their hideout in order to get rid of Dinah and Felicity after the two had located it; however Laurel secretly sabotaged it in order to detonate earlier and didn't kill anybody. 
After realizing that Laurel had no killing intentions but she simply felt hurt, alone, and abandoned, Sara reached out to her at Quentin's grave. Sara told Laurel her that redemption is a long journey, but she could still be a hero. Although evidently shaken by Sara's words, Laurel eventually responded that it was too late for her and got to the meeting point with Shadow Thief in order to steal a lethal weapon, however, as she arrived at the place where said device was stored, Felicity approached her telling her that she don't have to be "Earth-1 's legacy" or do what Earth-1 Laurel's would have wanted but rather what she wanted to do.

   Laurel simply told her to get out of her way, prompting Felicity to respond that if she was really intentioned to sell that weapon to mass murderers she could begin by murdering her, being subsequently supported in said statement by Sara and Dinah.

After Oliver managed to track the mercenaries hideout, they were caught into another explosion and Quentin got killed by Lyla who told them to stop fighting. 
The next time loop, after Oliver and Laurel found the location of a corrupt businessman who could be the instigator of Quentin's murder, the man was once again killed in a crossfire, however this time Laurel managed to thank him for not having given up to her and saving her life, stating that he was the reason why she tried to be an hero, to which Quentin replied that she already are and that he was proud of her.

     After using her powers to ostensibly take revenge on the
     person
     responsible for her father's death, Laurel eventually lost touch with her emotions, becoming (seemingly) callous, cruel and sadistic, even reveling in the destruction she causes with her powers.
     Laurel is notably very impatient and impulsive, admitting that she hates to wait more than anything,
     she is also a risk taker and does not like to delegate or let others do her dirty work for her, unlike her

     Laurel is also a very convincing liar and manipulator, as after receiving all of her Earth-1 doppelgänger's information, she was able to successfully imitate her late counterpart; fooling those closest to her including Oliver, her doppelgänger's ex-boyfriend and oldest friend, Oliver himself notes her skills as liar make it difficult for her to be trusted, something that she acknowledges about herself.
     Despite her skills, Laurel can be prideful to the point of being arrogant and overconfident; as noted when she was about to kill

     Laurel was also openly and tearfully upset, when Quentin showed her a film projector that showed photos and video footage of her Earth-1 doppelganger; she destroyed the projector after being emotionally overwhelmed by it,

     this indicates that despite her occasional sadistic comments, she is not a sadist herself or her interactions with Quentin are helping her further regain her emotions. It must also be noted that despite her sadistic comments, she has never been seen performing sadistic acts, further proving that even at her worst, she isn't a sadist.

     it is also revealed that her allying herself with Diaz, was not only a misguided attempt to protect herself but to also protect Quentin, although Quentin was (initially) angry and even disgusted by her affiliation with him, he eventually came to realize that she was trying to protect him in the same way he was trying to protect his Laurel from

    Since learning of the existence of her Earth-1 doppelgänger, Laurel was unphased by her doppelgänger's death,
    since learning more information about her, Laurel has even developed a certain level of contempt for her as she considers her counterpart to be weak, vulnerable and pathetic,
    Laurel's dislike for her counterpart seems to stem from the fact that she died for (seemingly) no clear reason at all, while Laurel herself is a harden criminal willing to almost anything to survive,
    gradually after learning more about her doppelgänger from Quentin, Laurel slowly lost her contempt for her and began to become more curious about her life.
    After Quentin was shot by Diaz and Laurel meet his other daughter and her counterpart's sister, Sara Lance, Laurel finally lost all the contempt she had for her and tearfully replied that she was hardly like her doppelgänger, even to the point to acknowledging she could have been more like her if she had someone stopping her from walking down the path to becoming a super-villain.
