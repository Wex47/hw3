   . As "Alchemy", Julian was possessed to restore the abilities of several meta-humans from the Flashpoint timeline. After being freed from Savitar's control, he joined
   Team Flash
   , using his scientific expertise to aid in protecting Central City. He also grows close to
   Caitlin Snow
   , eventually causing him to try to find a way to suppress her powers, and later to potentially cure her of her Killer Frost side. Their relationship becomes strained as Julian finds out that Caitlin recklessly tried to use a piece of the Philosopher's Stone in order to attempt to get rid of her powers, but when she suffers a life-threatening injury, he's quick to do all he can to save her.

   Julian Albert Desmond was born to a wealthy family in
   London
   ,
   England
   . As the firstborn son, he was meant to inherit a large sum of money built up from past generations. However, Julian was an "odd duck" and would rather go outside and explore than deal with formalities.
  </p>
  <p key="d8c1fa17-adea-4e72-a439-861f319e8c85">
   In adulthood, Julian eventually became a historian. He studied at the
   University of Oxford
   , with his dissertation "
   Anthropological analysis of the Brahmastra
   " being published by the university.

  <p key="6f16a246-0dee-446e-a79f-7f83d161a528">
   When Julian was 20, his sister
   Emma
   died of an illness. As a result, his parents stopped talking, driving the family apart. One night in 2012, Julian had a hallucination of Emma, who told him that the "
   Philosopher's Stone
   " could bring her back and where to find it in
   India
   . So, against his parents' wishes, he used his inheritance to form an archeological search team to find it in The Indus Valley.
  </p>
  <p key="74f8ddd8-5294-4c3d-99df-48a9d5cd4cbc">
   Weeks later without luck, Julian began to lose hope but a woman on his team told him they found it. They led him to an underground cavern where Julian opened the box containing the stone and screamed at the glowing light before blacking out.
  </p>
  <p key="7362f138-0dd1-43aa-9a63-f5cd5ab9e89e">
   Julian woke up the next morning in a motel where he saw a newscast reporting that the rest of his search team was found dead at the campsite. Afraid he would be blamed, he fled to America. Over the next few years, Julian would repeatedly black out and wake up in a different location with no memory of what happened. This would be the result of
   Savitar
   controlling his mind to become his deceitful "Alchemy".

   Three years later, Julian got a job
   Central City Police Department
   as a CSI specializing in
   meta-humans
   . He shared a lab with

   (which Barry Allen was not aware of this situation due to
   Flashpoint
   ), whom he developed a disliking of due to his mysterious disappearances and, "constant disregard for the rules".
  </p>
  <p key="dc4f1d7d-41e1-4c94-9156-900e535c697f">
   At some point, Alchemy transformed four individuals into meta-humans, leaving behind husks of skin from each individual.
  </p>
  <p key="974f6932-290c-4f40-8db4-fe3c7a295ac6">
   Almost a year later, he began working on a case involving dermal husks appearing around
   Central City
   , unaware they were a result of his being controlled by Savitar. He attended a meta-human conference for two days, before returning to a surprised Barry. The following day, he went to the scene of a fifth husk, refusing the help of Barry and instead taking his own samples, finding DNA belonging to
   Edward Clariss
   . The following day, Barry came to see him about the case and he ultimately allowed him to look at the file, albeit begrudgingly. The day after that, Julian gave Barry the finished Edward Clariss report, revealing he never told Barry the name belonging to the DNA, which meant Barry stole a sample at the earlier crime scene, and that he didn't like him as he couldn't trust him.
  </p>
  <p key="0e947941-0158-44c5-9d9a-0c31e56b2768">
   As Alchemy, Julian communicated with Edward Clariss through unknown means and led him to his lair where he and his followers awaited him. Alchemy also forced Clariss to remember his Flashpoint life and manipulated him into agreeing to serve him in exchange for restoring his powers, allowing Clariss to become "The Rival" again. After the Rival's first encounter with the

   , Rival led the Flash to a sawmill where Dr. Alchemy attacked the Flash. Dr. Alchemy claimed that he is helping people achieve their true potential to prepare the world, and had Rival fight Flash again. However, the Rival was defeated by the joint efforts of the Flash and

   Julian went to Captain
   David Singh
   , reporting on Barry about his tardiness, leaving work without information and inviting visitors to the lab. But the captain only gave the criminologist a lecture, which upset Albert. Sometime later in the lab after
   the monster
   's first attack in the city, Barry asked the man to teach him what he knows and what he can, and he will leave the lab in return. He later called Allen to the scene of the investigation, where they solved part of the puzzle together, and it was then that they both began to appreciate each other and talk more about each other. When the monster attacked again, the young man saved Julian from being crushed by an advertising banner. Back at the Police Department, Albert discovered where the monster would attack next time. During the raid he broke away from the police cordon and went to the abandoned floor of one of the skyscrapers, where he found
   the person
   responsible for controlling the beast. When he tried to escape, Julian fired a shot. Luckily, the bullet didn't hit the enemy thanks to Flash, and as it turned out, a little boy was responsible for the fuss in the city. Back at the police station, Julian let Barry stay in the lab and told about himself and the change he had undergone following recent events. Allen, seeing the broken investigator, decided to go with him for a drink, to which he agreed.

   In the wake of another failure, Alchemy decided to target the Flash directly. Sending another of his transformed meta-humans, dubbed "
   Shade
   ", to spread fear and panic and attract the Flash's attention, Alchemy reached out to
   Wally West
   through dreams/visions and his telepathy, imploring West to seek him out so that he could restore West's Flashpoint powers. As the pain of Alchemy's communications worsened, Team Flash and the CCPD used West to infiltrate Alchemy's lair and then stormed it with the Flash's help. The Flash went to grab Alchemy's stone from a pillar but Alchemy telekinetically stopped him from moving and summoned the stone to blast Flash repeatedly with beams of blue energy until it was shot out of his hand by Joe. Forced to his knees, Alchemy derided their efforts as the Flash moved to unmask him.

  <p key="79fbf238-f0cb-4725-8e5f-777f0055f5ac">
   Suddenly, an earthquake shook the lair and Alchemy bowed his head to the floor in reverence as a mysterious and unfathomably fast speedster slaughtered the CCPD cops and beat the Flash down. Meanwhile, Alchemy used his telepathy to reach Wally West once more and succeeded, turning him into a cocoon. His master saw a distracted Flash and pinned him to the ceiling, declaring himself as
   Savitar
   , the god of speed. As this was happening, Alchemy got up, watching Savitar finish him off.

  <p key="d2ee7a68-8589-4922-961a-31ff3e0c48cc">
   As Savitar was about to kill the Flash, Joe resisted and shot him but to not avail. As the situation was getting worse, Alchemy started to flee, leaving the scene unharmed. Alchemy's master then decided to "take Barry for a ride" and took off as well.

   During Julian's stay at the hospital, hurt by Killer Frost's attack, Barry visited him, pleading Julian to lie about what happened the identity of Killer Frost (Caitlin, whom he knows as 'Barry's friend'). He complied, but he demanded Barry to resign from his position as the CCPD's forensic scientist. After Barry sadly agreed and left, Julian suddenly heard the voice of Savitar and fell under the speedster's mind control, leaving the hospital to find the mask of Alchemy and serve his "god" once again.
  </p>
  <p key="cb804907-089b-4c92-84f0-47d29792585c">
   Julian then kept the mask in his lab at Central City Police Department, when suddenly he heard Savitar's voice ordering him to become Alchemy again. Alchemy soon becomes impatient and creates a portal for Savitar to come through, as well as restore all the meta-humans from Flashpoint. As Alchemy and his cultists prepared to bring back every meta-human from Flashpoint with a massive ritual using the Philosopher's Stone, the Flashes of two worlds appeared, with
   Jay Garrick
   taking Savitar's attention, while Barry Allen went after the unprotected Alchemy, taking the Philosopher's Stone and bringing it back to its box. As the box closed, Savitar disappeared from reality, sealed away with the stone, and Alchemy's host, Julian, lost consciousness. When Barry spoke to Julian, he revealed that he remembered nothing of his actions as Alchemy, and even refused to admit being turned into this criminal at first. Later, Barry returned to Julian's cell, asking if he had any blackouts, unmasking himself to get Julian to trust him. Afterwards, Savitar tried to leave the Philosopher's Stone's box by, effectively, turning Cisco Ramon into his new Alchemy, using the same trick with a specter of a
   dead sibling
   that he used on Julian before. Although Cisco released Savitar and was ready to attack Caitlin during a trance in which he thought he's seen his brother alive, Caitlin managed to persuade him to close the Philosopher's Stone box, trapping Savitar once again.

   As Team Flash accessed Julian's mind, seeing him as their last link to Savitar, the "God of Speed" spoke through Julian once again, telling Team Flash the truth behind Alchemy and his plans as a whole. Afterwards, Julian discusses with the rest of Team Flash what to do with the Philosopher's Stone, refuting the first suggestion to destroy it, stating it was indestructible, hence why it's still around. Ultimately, Barry and Jay throw the stone into the
   Speed Force
   to neutralize the threat of Savitar. Afterwards, Julian declined Caitlin's invitation to the West family Christmas party, but later changed his mind, informing Barry that he talked with Singh and rescinded his resignation from the CCPD.

   Julian was working with the Police Department when Caitlin visited him. The woman asked him to help him release her powers, resulting in Albert's strange reaction and refusal. Some time later, he asked the woman to visit him again in the laboratory, where he apologized for his behavior. It was then that he was offered to join the Flash team, which he decided to consider. The next evening he showed up at Allen and Iris's housewarming party, for which he had brought a bottle of wine. At the same time, he revealed to Caitlin that he was working with Cisco on something to help her hold her powers, and finally officially joined the heroes' team.

   Julian helped the team defeat the Electric Gang, marveling at the chaos in the lab. When Flash and Kid Flash returned from their mission, the man wasn't exactly friendly, believing the sprinters could have done it more efficiently and faster in more ways. Then, while talking to Cisco, Caitlin and Barry, he tried to convey that there was no way the boy could get fast enough to save Iris from Savitar in the near future. When much later a certain

   Julian was working on the found body of
   Stuart Holzman
   , which decomposed extremely quickly. Believing that there might be a meta-human connection with it, and without the proper equipment in the police laboratory, Albert decided to take the body to S.T.A.R. Labs. There, he intended to test them with Caitlin, but the body turned to dust. It was only with the next victim,
   Julio Mendez
   , that the body was taken to the facility much faster and the team immediately began investigating, discovering that the strongest decay was on the palm and obtaining the DNA of the culprit -
   Clive Yorkin
   . From then on, Julian blamed himself for creating these meta-humans, and when Caitlin was forced to use her powers on Iris to save her, Albert spoke to her, noting that he was going through the same thing. Thereby he helped Snow, saved the journalist and contributed to the capture of the criminal, and at the end of the day he went with Caitlin for a drink.

   Julian was working at the police lab when Barry visited him and asked him to hide from the captain for several days. As it turned out, the team intended to save a friend from the parallel world, and that Albert also wanted to survive the journey to another Earth, told the captain that they were going to
   Blüdhaven
   together for the conference. Thus, the man went to S.T.A.R. Labs, where he and Barry, Caitlin, and Cisco relocated to
   Earth-2
   near
   Gorilla City
   . After a short journey through the bush towards the city of telepathic gorillas, the team was stunned and then locked in a cell. There,
   Grodd
   communicated with them using Harry's body, who explained that he needed help to get rid of a certain Solovar who was going to attack Central City because of his hatred of people. Allen agreed to fight the city's leader and won the fight, but chose not to kill the gorilla. This act enraged Grodd, who took command of his race after Solovar's defeat, and decided to use Vibe's ability to infiltrate Earth-1. The heroes, however, tricked into leaving Earth-2, thus saving
   Harry
   . After the action, Caitlin went out with Julian for a drink, believing that the man cares about her.

   Julian returned to Central City right after his team's sprinters finished training, after which it was revealed that Wally was fast enough to beat Savitar. It was then that Allen announced to the team that he was engaged to Iris when suddenly the sprinters were forced to go to the burning building. On the way, however, Wally was attacked by Savitar, whom only the latter saw. Thus it turned out that the young West had been seeing the enemy for a long time and was hiding it from the team. An upset Barry kicked Wally off the team for this time, saying he didn't trust him. The angry boy discovered that Allen got engaged to his sister only because they were not engaged in the future and thus could turn the tide. After all, the heroes contacted the enemy several times through Julian and found out that Caitlin had stored a piece of the Philosopher's Stone. During this time, Wally was hanging out with Jesse at home when Savitar tricked him into showing himself as Francine. This upset the young man, who without the consent of his friends took the last fragment of the artifact and tried to throw it into the Power of Speed. When the portal opened, he began to drag Wally inside and Flash did not manage to save him. Young West replaced Savitar, who was trapped in the Force of Speed, thereby freeing him once and for all. The sprinters started to fight, but the hero eventually lost, ending up in the laboratory with a large stab wound.

   On H.R.'s advice, the team decided to try and get Wally out of the Force of Speed. After taking the speed dimension lesson, Albert, Caitlin, and Cisco set about building a device that would pull the sprinter out of the Force of Speed in case of trouble. When he managed to save his friend, the rest, at the request of Jesse, tried to track Savitar with his armor, knowing that they could not allow the heroine to go to meet the enemy herself. All their efforts were shattered when the girl took advantage of the moment of inattention and put her life in danger, then the team welcomed Allen, who pulled the young West out of the speed dimension. Soon after, H.R. recalled Jesse's discovery that Savitar was not really a god as he also felt pain.

   Julian helped the team find a way to capture
   Ara Kadabra

After that, he was left alone with her, admiring her for the courage she showed. When H.R. He returned, the team began a short conversation, after which the girl's condition began to deteriorate and despite many attempts at CPR, Ramon pronounced dead. Julian could not come to terms with the loss of Caitlin, so he took off her necklace, turning her into Killer Frost while saving her life. Sam H.R., Cisco, and Julian were pushed back by an icy blast against the walls and their friend's evil incarnation began to mock them.

   Julian tried to convince Caitlin that she was not Killer Frost, but to no avail, forcing him to run away with the rest of his friends into the pipe. From there, Flash saved them, forcing the girl to flee. After all, Barry, fearing Savitar would win and kill Iris, decided to travel to 2024 to find out about the sprinter. This infuriated Albert, who thought Caitlin was the priority. Then Wally helped Allen to open the portal and before he looked back, the boy managed to get back, believing he had a plan even though he still didn't know who was hiding under Savitar's armor.

  <p key="f21f3a86-44df-45b0-bec8-7449df2463fa">
   The team chose to follow their lead and find
   Tracy Brand
   , which Julian disliked, who still thought Caitlin was a priority. As it turned out later, Killer Frost attacked friends, which the man later saw in the recordings. He was furious with Cisco for not firing a clean shot even though he had the opportunity. Sometime later it happened again, so Ramon confessed that he had a hard time attacking a friend with whom he had lived so much. Julian, however, persuaded the technician that only thanks to him can they regain their former Caitlin. After these words, during the next meeting with Killer Frost, Vibe successfully knocked Snow to the ground and took her blood sample. Unfortunately for them, Savitar arrived and took the girl with him. Nevertheless, the friend's blood sample was delivered to Albert by Cisco, who immediately set about creating some antidote.

  <p key="991f7efa-7965-4d20-9cc1-4a0035b707cb">
   The team had the idea that by wiping Barry's memory they would have a chance to get rid of Savitar, who would also remember nothing. They did so, but the plan failed too much, erasing Allen's memories of who he was. Julian and Cisco tried to fix their mistake, and Allen had to deal with
   Lucious Coolidge
   Due to their "ailment", the team decided to help with that, but to no avail. After some time, Caitlin visited them, who said she would help, fearing for Savitar himself. Together, they restored Barry's memory and tried to convince Snow to stay with them. However, these words did not help, and the girl went back to Savitar.

  <p key="761948ac-33ae-4f24-9f07-fdc498311de8">
   All the while, Julian and Caitlin's mother tried to find a cure for her condition, and finally succeeded. He and his team prepared to fight Savitar by extracting Jay Garrick from the Force of Speed. When the time was right, the heroes fought each other, eventually driving Allen from the future to lower his armor. To the surprise of the others, the final blow was delivered by Iris, who shot the enemy, wiping him out of space-time. Cisco handed Caitlin the medicine and gave her the choice of whether or not to use it, then let it go. After that, the team prepared H.R. a dignified funeral where they bid farewell to a brave friend and let Caitlin go and find their own new path in life. They were going to rest together when the Storm Force of Speed began to rage over Central City. Seeing no other solution and knowing the reason for her occurrence, Allen decided to stop her by going to the speed dimension. He said goodbye to his friends, and as he entered the portal, the storm subsided, forcing the team to think.

He seems to take great pride in his scientific expertise, to the point of refusing help when carrying out important investigations, although Barry claims that he often dumps on him all the paperwork he doesn't want to do himself. Ironically, he disliked the Flash because he consistently outperforms the entire police force, and believes that the
   Central City Police Department
   has become lazy and lethargic as a result. However, after Barry began trying to open up with Julian and worked on a case together, to which Barry would save him and later Julian nearly killed a child, only to be stopped by Flash, Julian began to see the "two" in a different light. Accepting that Flash is a symbol of hope for
   Central City

  <p key="9304da26-8852-4731-b740-cb8032b92c76">
   Julian has shown to be extremely tactless at times, as seen when he openly accused
   Frankie Kane
   of having attacked her foster father,
   John James
   , causing her to trigger her alternate personality "Magenta" in the middle of the police station, potentially placing many lives at risk just to prove himself right. He also chastised Barry for wanting to leave two minutes earlier for his date with
   Iris West
   , which hints that he might be a workaholic to a fault. This is also shown as Julian is a bit outraged that despite nine violations, Barry is able to get off with a 15-second warning. While not heartless, his sense of justice and morals is still considerably higher, agreeing to keep
   Caitlin Snow

   Julian's perfectionist tendencies appear to stem from insecurities in his life. Not fitting in with the glamorous lifestyle of his family, Julian was determined to make a life for himself in his own way. Despite his persevering and studious nature leading him to become a top-level forensic scientist, he became distraught when the meta-human outbreak changed everything. He came to hate meta-humans because the vast majority of them went on to become criminals and made all his work and research seem irrelevant by comparison. At the same time, he envies them because he wasn't one of the "chosen" who got such remarkable abilities, only wanting to help the world as best as possible.

From his regular interaction with Caitlin and her constant support, Julian has begun to develop feelings for her, enough to risk his life to keep her safe.

      Alchemy has shown multiple times to be able to carve his name into mirrors and other surfaces without touching them, or even being present for that matter. However, it is implied that this may be a hallucination, as
      Iris West
      wasn't able to see it when
      Wally West
      was during while being called on by Alchemy.
      By extending his arm, Alchemy stopped

       Transmutation

      Alchemy is able to biologically alter individuals to give them
      meta-human
      powers, the individuals leaving behind a "husk" in their place after being granted their powers. Acolyte
      Craig
      claimed that Alchemy can also take powers away from meta-humans,
      although whether this is true or not is up for debate. He also revealed Alchemy's powers were greatly amplified if he chooses to; for example whereas The Rival in the Flashpoint timeline could only match the much slower Flash (Wally) and struggled to keep up with a weakened Flash (Barry), in the new slightly altered timeline, The Rival's powers were increased to the point that they could compete with The Flash.

    Despite his high-standards, Julian views are often well-founded from his natural insightfulness. Very shrewd, he is able to perceive both the situation quickly at first glance and likewise quickly determine an effective means to handle it. Ignoring his initial dislike of Barry, he quickly began to realize that Barry was hiding his true nature, not surprised when he finally learned that Barry was The Flash. Since joining
    Team Flash
    , his methodical and calculating nature is also shown him to be an effective tactician, offering optimum choices on how to act. Like Barry, Julian is highly skilled in forensics, sometimes even superior to the former, praised even by
    Caitlin Snow
    and
    Cisco Ramon
    . Very detailed oriented, he is able to comprehend much of a crime scene after an initial inspection. Specializing in meta-human forensics for the
    CCPD
    , Julian is also well-versed in the various reports of meta-human activity. He is an accomplished archeologist and historian, his
    dissertation on the Brahmastra
    being among those featured on
    Oxford University
    's website. Julian is also very advanced in mathematics, able to calculate Barry's ability to increase his speed given his current rate.
