   While serving in the Air Force Academy, 19-year-old Arthur allowed himself to be recruited by "modern-day crusade"
   The Hidden
   after an artifact collection he owned had been robbed by one of their agents in London. Half of an ancient Ashkiri tribe book describing an
   ancient temple
   in the Hindu Kush mountains had been stolen, so Malcolm joined the Hidden, knowing they had an interest in and were searching for the said temple, which he was also interested in. He developed a romance with the agent who stole from him, Ashkiri tribe descendant
   Lourdes
   , despite her being betrothed to another man. Arthur and Lourdes then went to the Hindu Kush mountains with the Hidden on the mission to locate the temple and seal it in order to prevent local tribal wars unearthing it and the secrets within. This was Arthur's first mission with the Hidden and would turn out to be his only one. One night, at the Hidden base camp in the mountains, their leader
   Ibadan
   noticed Arthur making love to Lourdes (presumably impregnating her with their future son
   Saracon
   ) and decided to test his strength by sending him and more experienced fellow Hidden agent
   Darius
   to find a fabled stone marker that was said reveal the location of the ancient temple. However, only five miles from the camp, they were forced to duck behind their Jeep to protect themselves from a

   , the worst kind of sandstorm. While the sandstorm passed, they noticed men of the
   <a href="League of Assassins (Earth-1).html" key="64785699-9376-48bf-93ff-6328da81e561" title="League of Assassins (Earth-1)">
    League of Assassins
   </a>
   approaching by horseback in the distance.
   However, the assassins were forced to stop by the intensifying storm, and Darius told Arthur to be ready to do anything for their cause. Darius took a sheet from their vehicle to cover them, and the jeep was blown away by the strong storm winds afterward.
  </p>
  <p key="0855a4de-33d2-48b3-a9c3-e78cc97efa18">
   Soon, the storm passed and the League horsemen charged towards Darius and Arthur, but Lourdes had been earlier sent by Ibadan to help them and she arrived just in time to take down the assassins. The following day, the trio set out to search for the stone marker. They had no luck until, just as the sun was setting, Arthur climbed up higher in the mountains and realized that the topography below him was the marker they were looking for. From this and their knowledge of the Ashkiri beliefs, they deduced where the temple was located, and they returned to the Hidden base camp at the edge of the mountains to inform Ibadan of this discovery. Arthur was the one who informed Ibadan of the League tracing them and the location of the temple. When Lourdes expressed hesitation in continuing the mission as it might lead the League to the location of the temple, Arthur insisted on proceeding with their plan, pretending to care to keep the temple's secrets from the warring tribes and the League while really just seeking the treasures of the temple for himself. With Ibadan and Darius agreeing with Arthur, the decision to continue was made and Darius and Lourdes were dismissed. However, Arthur stayed with Ibadan to ask him about what he knew of the temple and its contents, acting as if he had never heard of the Ashkiri before he joined the Hidden. Ibadan showed Arthur an Ashkiri bestiary, since they worshipped animals, and he explained their belief that everything began with two snow leopard twins, the god of darkness and the goddess of light. Hunting humans killed the latter one, he explained, so darkness began to overtake the light around the world, however, the corpse of the leopard goddess gave birth to a new light goddess to balance the dark and light, and the world was fixed. From Arthur's reaction to this, Ibadan realized he already knew about it, was lying, his membership of the Hidden was a ruse to rob the treasures of the temple, and that therefore Arthur must have a personal airplane somewhere nearby to escape at a moment's notice with what he would steal from the temple. However, they were interrupted by a sudden explosion that destroyed most of the Hidden camp. Arthur was injured but he went straight to check on Lourdes, who had also survived but had been knocked out. After she came to, the two of them found Ibadan, who had a twisted leg. Arthur helped fix it, telling Ibadan that even though pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. The three of them realized that the disappeared Darius was a traitor, a double agent for the League of Assassins and he caused the explosion. Without any way to contact the Hidden Headquarters for backup, they decided to go to the temple and attempt to reach it before the League, since they have inevitably been informed of the temple's location by Darius and they plan on taking advantage of what is in the temple, with the injured Ibadan hiding his realization of Arthur's true motives. When Ibadan asked for Lourdes to look for his box containing everything they had on the Ashkiri, Arthur found it first and snuck it into his jacket, but Lourdes noticed although she had faith in Arthur's decision to hide it from Ibadan. The three of them used a truck that survived the explosion to set out in an attempt to reach the temple before the League.
  </p>
  <p key="602172ca-8ae4-4028-8860-e7e0a09272b7">
   The following morning, Lourdes and Arthur left the truck with Ibadan, who insisted on staying behind as his wound would only slow them down. They located the temple's entrance before the League, causing a small earthquake to split the ground in several locations nearby, including Ra's al Ghul's camp, inadvertently delaying the assassins from catching up with them at the temple. Arthur had known about the way to open the temple from his prior knowledge, and that it required two people to open, so he had Lourdes help him open the temple while acting as if it was a lucky guess. Suddenly, the earthquakes became the footsteps and roars of the guardian spirits of the temple, two large, growling snow leopards, like the ones in the Ashkiri myth, and crackling with mystical energy. Lourdes and Arthur were chased by the two leopard spirits and they escaped into the temple. Inside, Arthur deduced from the cinnabar within that the area was, in reality, an ancient, dormant volcano, but it didn't matter because they were destroying the temple. As they thought they had lost the spirits deeper in the tunnels of the temple, Lourdes began to doubt their mission and wondered if it was all a big mistake, to which Arthur replied that he was aware that it was a mistake. Before he could explain himself, the spirits phased through the walls and continued to chase them. As they ran closer to the heart of the temple, Lourdes cried that Ibadan had told her there was only one way in and out of there so they would be trapped, but Arthur revealed that he was sure there was another exit. He also revealed that Ibadan didn't want them to be aware of that and that he had planned on them dying with the temple's destruction. The two of them evaded the leopards and found themselves finally in the heart of the temple, finding themselves in a majestic chamber with statues, ancient artifacts, an altar in the center containing two powerful, mystical relics that were said to be the hearts of the twin leopard gods of the myth, and a
   Lazarus Pit
   , the treasures that Arthur was truly after. However, Lourdes suddenly pinned him down and demanded he explain himself and how he knew so much about the temple already, and he revealed the truth about how she had only stolen half of the Ashkiri text from his collection, and he had merely been using his new membership in the Hidden to get to the temple. Arthur also revealed that he had inherited his collection from his father,
   Jasper King
   , and that the temple had been the Holy Grail to his King Arthur. Thus, he truly did believe that the Hidden had been a modern-day crusade, but his crusade for the treasure of the temple. After explaining everything to Lourdes, Arthur got to work, taking a sample of the Lazarus Pit by filling his bottle with its waters, while claiming that his love for Lourdes was one thing he didn't lie about. Then, Arthur went and picked up a particular ancient artifact blade which was the key to unlocking the powerful relics in the altar, but just then the two leopard spirits burst in. Realizing he had no time to continue plundering the temple, Arthur headed for the secret second exit while informing Lourdes that he actually brought her there to sacrifice to the leopard spirits so he could make his escape. Heartbroken and shocked, Lourdes did nothing but plead for her life as the spirits pounced and mauled her while Arthur ignored her and jumped down a waterfall that led to a river outside of the temple. Unaware that Ra's al Ghul had saved Lourdes by sacrificing Darius and taken Lourdes as his concubine before the temple finally came down, sealing the two powerful relics for good, Arthur found himself held at gunpoint by Ibadan. The leader of the Hidden explained that the League of Assassins was everywhere and they had to leave as soon as possible, revealing all that he had deduced about Arthur when they talked about the mission earlier and when he displayed knowledge of the temple he had not been told by the Hidden. Ibadan also revealed he had pretended to be a double agent for the League to be aware of their progress during the mission, telling Arthur that trust is overrated and his injury barely bothered him because as he had said earlier, pain is inevitable but suffering is optional. Arthur and Ibadan made it to Arthur's plane, but just then, men from the League of Assassins found them and fired a volley of arrows. Arthur used Ibadan as a human shield and then jumped into the plane, escaping and leaving the arrow-ridden Ibadan at the mercy of the League.

   Once aboard his private jet, King expressed satisfaction over what he had managed to take from the temple. He circled back over the destroyed temple once to enjoy one final look at it and then flew to
   Corto Maltese
   . On the way, Arthur made a call ahead to Corto Maltese, where he had a facility being built, and spoke about how he did manage to get a Lazarus Pit sample that they would need to be stored until the facility was complete. After making the call, he analyzed the blade that had been the key to unlocking the two mystical heart relics but had not been used, and he decided to keep it, simply to add to his collection.
  </p>
  <p key="0f5423ff-5081-4c83-9ad1-4e515e1edb9b">
   After his visit to Corto Maltese, during which he entrusted the Lazarus Pit sample, which he referred to as his entire future, to his scientists, he traveled around South America "for a while". Around this time he came up with what he decided he would live as in the future: Malcolm Merlyn, to disassociate with his past life, as he started anew with his facility and his new company,

   In 1993, Rebecca was murdered in a mugging in The Glades. Earlier, Rebecca tried to call Malcolm for help as she was dying, but he was busy and turned his phone off, unaware of the nature of Rebecca's call.
   Later, after Malcolm turned it back on, he received a call from a businessman, whom he negotiated with until he had a deal. Tommy then woke up from a nightmare. Malcolm comforted his son, performing a vanishing coin trick to cheer him up. He promised Tommy he wouldn't leave or let anything happen to him. Just then, the doorbell rang and Malcolm rushed to open it, expecting his wife. Instead, he was met with two

   When Oliver was accused of being the vigilante, Malcolm later invited Moira to talk with him upon short notice. They discussed whether Oliver might actually be The Hood, and Malcolm held up his end of the argument that he strongly believes that Oliver is, due to the suspicious timing of his return from

   Tired of the Hood's interference, Malcolm took up his own vigilante persona, the "Dark Archer" and killed
   Adam Hunt
   to lure the vigilante out. He later attended a dinner party at the Queen Mansion, where the Hood was the main topic of discussion. Malcolm appeared to still be skeptical regarding Oliver's innocence, asking him a few questions about the Hood and his nickname (even suggesting "Green Arrow"). Malcolm also looked at Oliver with suspicion when he left the room the same time as the cops after they reported Hunt's murder to Police Commissioner
   Brian Nudocerdo
   . Later, Dark Archer killed
   Nelson Ravich
   to again lure out the Hood and set up a trap in a warehouse, which failed. Afterwards, Malcolm was informed by
   Doug Miller
   that
   Walter Steele
   had more information on The List and consulted with Moira about the predicament, stating that action needed to be taken. Desperate to lure the Hood out, Dark Archer took five hostages in a factory and televised a message demanding the archer meet him before he started killing the captives. The two archers had a fierce battle, but Dark Archer came out on top, informing The Hood that he knew the latter was targeting The List, and brutally beat him. However, the Hood managed to stab Dark Archer with an arrow and escape. Malcolm later had Walter abducted and informed Moira that he wouldn't be harmed, promising to release Walter once the Undertaking was over.
   Oliver's defeat at the hands of Dark Archer gave him nightmares and scared him so much that he refused to suit up again fearing for leaving his family should he be killed. However, Diggle was finally able to snap him out of his fear before Oliver became the Hood once again.

At dinner, Malcolm quite openly mentioned to Laurel how his wife was killed, though not before trying to getting Tommy to sign over his mother's clinic, so it could be shut down. Tommy then felt betrayed again and stormed off as Laurel directly confronted Malcolm about the cutoff but he told Laurel that he needs it to be stronger just like he was forced to after his wife's death. Malcolm also met with Moira to discuss
   Carl Ballard
   's endangerment of the Undertaking and she agreed to handle him but demanded proof of Walter's survival first. Malcolm later came to Moira at Thea's birthday party to give her a photo of him and gave her a reassuring touch on her shoulder, unaware Thea was watching who believed them to be having an affair.

   Deadshot
   , who had been assigned to his assassination. Before Malcolm could die, The Hood arrived and was able to convince Tommy to give his father a blood transfusion, in order to rid his body of curare poison laced in the bullet. He woke up in a hospital bed some time later and talked to Tommy and confessed his guilt for letting him down as a child. Moira visited, and Malcolm asked her to find his would-be killer, unaware it was actually Moira.

Later Moira storms into a meeting Malcolm has with his Chinese employers about Walter apparently being killed but Malcolm shows her that he is alive, unaware that the Hood is listening in. Later when Walter was rescued by the Hood, Malcolm talked to Oliver about Walter if he knew anything but he didn't and told Malcolm that those who nabbed him would pay.
   To tie up loose ends, Malcolm, as Dark Archer, visited
   Unidac Industries

Malcolm later paid Walter a visit at the Queen Mansion until Moira returned and accused Malcolm of wanting to kill him to tie up more loose ends, given Dark Archer's massacre earlier, which Malcolm admitted was true. Later, Diggle found the device's empty container while Malcolm was personally visited by The Hood. The vigilante attempted to shoot Malcolm with an arrow, but Malcolm caught the arrow before revealing to him that he is the Dark Archer, also noting the irony of Malcolm trying to kill him at Christmas, The Hood saving Malcolm a few months before and now The Hood trying to kill him. The two of them engaged in hand-to-hand combat, Malcolm ultimately coming out the victor, knocking The Hood out. He lifted his hood and discovered his true identity - Oliver Queen.

   Malcolm had Oliver tied up before he could regain consciousness. Oliver was awoken, and Malcolm explained to him why he had done what he had before leaving, awaiting the destruction of the Glades. Later Tommy visited Malcolm to tell him that Laurel and he were over and that Oliver believed he wanted to destroy the Glades but Malcolm confirmed it, much to his shock. Malcolm then played a recording of Rebecca's death to Tommy before angrily yelling, "They deserve to die! All of them!". However then Moira confessed the plan on TV, three cops arrived to arrest him but Malcolm easily dispatched them and Tommy tried to kill him but Malcolm knocked him out. After this he waited, geared up in his safe room, and The Hood and John soon found him. Dark Archer fought them both simultaneously, despite being on the losing end. He threw a throwing knife at John and managed to escape to the roof. Hood and Dark Archer squared off on the roof, shooting arrows at each other, before engaging in hand-to-hand combat. He managed to get Hood in a choke hold, telling him that he would soon be joined by his mother and sister in death, remembering the last words of his father Oliver managed to stab Malcolm through the chest with one of Malcolm's arrows, by stabbing himself through his shoulder. Oliver rose from the ground, and after receiving confirmation from Felicity that the device was disarmed, told Malcolm that his plan had failed. Injured, Malcolm revealed he had a second device stationed in the Glades. Believing he had won, Malcolm fell on his side and succumbed to his apparent demise.

   Regardless of Malcolm's success, he was left with anything but feeling victorious with the death of Tommy, which caused him great guilt and remorse, and left Starling City in peace, too grieving to continue his plans to remake the Glades. The League also learned of the Undertaking, which violated their codes, but since they also believed Malcolm to be dead, the matter was considered settled.

   Five months following his apparent death, it is now public knowledge that Malcolm was responsible for the Undertaking and he was the Dark Archer.
   When Moira was in danger of being prosecuted Malcolm returned to Starling and used "a little persuasion" to make sure she was acquitted of the charges of being associated with him. After she was acquitted, her driver brought Moira to a remote location where Malcolm was waiting, killed the driver and revealed himself to Moira. Using resources in Starling Malcolm followed Donner's investigative on of links between Moira and Malcolm and became suspicions she had kept secrets even from him. A genetic test confirmed his suspicions - Thea is his daughter.
   Malcolm continues to privately confront Moira at the Queen household and even revealed the guilt he had towards inadvertently killing Tommy and insisting that she owes her life to him after acquitting her. Determined to play a part in his daughter's life, Malcolm demands that Moira tells Thea of her true parentage. Moira refuses and contacts Ra's al Ghul, informing him that Malcolm is alive. She reveals this to Malcolm, advising that he run since Ra's wanted to kill him personally. Malcolm did so but stated that the matter wasn't settled.

After he manages to kill him, he temporarily loses consciousness, and when he comes to, Thea is pointing a gun at him. Malcolm tells Thea that he understands her pain as he has endured it too - with Rebecca and Tommy's deaths - just as Thea did with her loss of Moira and Robert. Suddenly Thea fires two shots in his direction.
   As Thea feels guilt-ridden for killing her real father, Malcolm comes to and reveals that he was wearing a kevlar vest. Malcolm, to Thea's disgust, told Thea that she had more nerve than Tommy. When Thea left to find Roy, Malcolm compared Roy to Moira and Oliver: they were all liars. Later, after Thea found out Roy's identity as The Arrow's accomplice, she went back to Malcolm, waiting in his limousine.
   Thea requested that Malcolm teach her how to be strong, as she never wanted to feel weak and helpless again, and they soon departed from Starling City.

However, she was unable to stand it, and Malcolm decided that he had to train her the same way he had been trained, by physically hurting her to the point that Thea retaliated, pointing a sword, allowing him to determine that her training had begun.

   . Thea, enraged over recent events, approaches and berates her father. Malcolm apologizes for his actions and allows Thea to kill him if she believes it is necessary, although she declines the offer.
   Malcolm is later seen in Thea's loft, having recovered from his wounds, watching Captain Lance's press conference revealing the identity of The Arrow and looking slightly concerned.

   Malcolm later met with Oliver in Verdant at his own request, where Oliver claimed he will break Roy out of prison. Malcolm responded that Ra's wouldn't stop until Oliver accepted the offer to become his heir and his days as The Arrow were finished. He further pointed out that Oliver hasn't lost anyone yet and leading the League of Assassins would be preferable than getting caught up in Ra's schemes. Oliver left shortly afterward, sticking to his plan of breaking Roy out of Iron Heights.

   Malcolm is later seen in the hospital, where Thea was connected to life support due to the she suffered because of being stabbed by Ra's al Ghul. Upon seeing this, Malcolm held Thea's hand and broke down in tears. In Thea's loft, Malcolm revealed that the
   Lazarus Pit
   allowed Ra's to live for centuries and, on rare occasions, could be used to bring the dead to life. However, he also said that the Pit drastically changes one's personality and the Thea who Oliver knew may not be the one he gets back. Despite this, Oliver decided to accept Ra's proposal of healing Thea in exchange for becoming his heir. Malcolm traveled with the rest of Team Arrow to Nanda Parabt. At the hangar, Malcolm tried to convince Oliver to take Thea to

   Sarab
   , joined the ritual to resurrect Thea. A few moments after she entered the Pit, Thea jumped and kicked Oliver to the ground, releasing an animalistic growl, much to Malcolm's horror. After Thea was sedated, Malcolm stood by her bedside with Oliver. Thea woke up with her memories scattered, believing Oliver is dead but recognizing Malcolm as her father. Malcolm reassures Thea that she is in a safe place. When she asks about her mother, Mclolm avoided the question, simply saying she isn't there and told her to rest. Thea complies and tells Malcolm she loves him. Malcolm is briefly happy but after Thea is asleep, he berates Oliver for using the Pit.

   Later that night, Malcolm met with Diggle and Felicity, where he saw that Felicity had drugged Oliver in hopes of escaping with him. Malcolm warned Felicity that if are found, Ra's would kill them all. However, he agreed to aid group in their escape to the catacombs. Malcolm effortlessly defeated a member of the League and took his sword. Shortly afterward, he met three others, whom he kills quickly with the sword and proceeded to the temple. They are aided by Maseo, who shot three other members of the League. Although they do reach the catacombs, Thea's hallucinations delay the group long enough for them to be surrounded by the League. He advised the group that they don't want to be taken alive, from past experience. They are saved at the last minute by Oliver, who ordered the League to put their weapons down, claiming to be the new Heir to the Demon. Malcolm is later seen when Oliver bid farewell to the group, charging Malcolm to take care of Thea. The following day, Malcolm greeted a confused Thea, to which she responded negatively. Seeing she doesn't seem to remember what happened, Malcolm explained how Ra's nearly killed her that, in order to save her, Oliver had to join the League. She panicked upon hearing this but Malcolm tried to assure her that he will make up for this and everything else that happened before. Thea said that is impossible but Malcolm happily stated it is and he is now a free man and that he could go anywhere in the world, but he wants to take care of her, just like she did when he was injured.

   A few weeks later, Thea asked Malcolm if it was true Oliver was hunting down Nyssa. Malcolm mentioned that he learned from his sources that he wants to kill her to protect his reign as Heir to the Demon. Thea told him he should be stopped and that he should not be a killer. Malcolm told her Oliver is now the Heir to the Demon and that he will be a killer for them. Thea mentioned he had been brainwashed to kill just like Malcolm did to her. Malcolm said he did not sacrifice himself for her so she could risk her life fighting the League. Thea mentioned she could not stop him trading his life for hers however she can stop this. Malcolm mentioned she is a warrior even before he trained her and her brother is aware of this as well. He then asked Thea how he could help her.

The team traveled to Nanda Parbat to stop a plane from spreading the virus, they stopped the plane and engaged a huge group of assassins. During the fight Malcolm took out dozens of assassins and saved both Laurel and Felicity. They killed many members of the League but were eventually overrun by Oliver and Ra's and were captured. Malcolm begged for his life with Ra's, exposing Oliver's deception in exchange for joining the League again but Oliver kept the ruse up and Malcolm was returned to prison where Ra's exposed him, Felicity, Ray, Diggle and Laurel to the virus and was sealed inside their cell and left to die.

He explained that he had vaccinated them as well through a skin graft and that their plan was to deceive Ra's to make him believe Oliver is committed to his cause. As the group wondered how they could escape, Malcolm simply stated would have to wait for the thunder.

   The group went to the hotel and quickly took out his bodyguards. Oliver confronted the assistant of Damien and learned that Damien had been aware and left in time.

Oliver managed to kill Ra's after a duel, and they managed to contain the virus. The group reunited at Palmer industries. Oliver talked to the group and thanked all of them as together they had managed to save the city, he then revealed he would leave the city for a while.

However, Oliver noted he would never forgive what Malcolm had done to Sara and Thea. When Malcolm asked if they would be enemies, Oliver responded that depended on what he would do with his power. At Nanda Parbat, Malcolm wore the custom of

Malcolm told her he just wanted to be free from Ra's just like her and when he was captured, Ra's had tortured him with his sword but he had survived, like the prophecy. Nyssa warned him she would make him pay for what he had done to Sara. Malcolm told her she was welcome to try and then ordered her and the assassins to kneel. After a brief moment, Nyssa kneeled before him.

   The Hidden
   along with her son,
   Saracon
   . She watched as her son cut his finger off, adorned with an ancient ring, intending to send it to Malcolm Merlyn. They attacked his fortress, causing him and a number to retreat inside. Sealed in a room with no way out, Merlyn's team discovers a clue about their attacker's shadowy motive. The Hidden set charges on the wall and exploded a hole through. Once down in the tunnel, Saracon used inter-species telepathy to send bats at their enemy, allowing them to catch up. However, before they could be caught, they escaped again, having discovered a secret hole in the ground. They followed them down to the Sea of Souls, where they all fought. Although the Hidden were almost overwhelmed, the local man and
   Rainie
   escaped, leaving only Malcolm. Lourdes and Saracon chained him up and Saracon began torturing him, wishing for Merlyn to confess to his sins, thus admitting to his true name and telling the story of his earlier days as part of the Hidden. Lourdes joined them, having left men inside the tunnel. She began to get angry at Merlyn, strangling him, but Saracon reminded her that he needed a full confession, causing her to step back. Malcolm had told almost everything about his past with Lourdes and his motive for joining The Hidden is revealed.

While they were distracted by conversation, Saracon awoke and absorbed the power of the heart, wanting to become a true sacred son of Ashkiri. Lourdes begged Malcolm to spare their son from this reckless act, but Merlyn said that if the power in Ashkiri's heart doesn't kill him, he way be worth saving. The eaten heart has repeatedly strengthened the power of Saracon and he began to destroy everything around, but Lourdes' minutes were numbered. She died in the arms of her son and he was very saddened by this fact. Not caring about Lourdes, Malcolm focused on his newfound son. He tried to persuade Saracon to leave with him, saying that they could do great things together, after all he got what he came for. Saracon refused, and father and son continued their battle, until Malcolm's reinforcements with Rainie and Nyssa arrived. The injured son decides to escape from the collapsing cave through underwater tunnels, promising Malcolm a meeting next time. Rainie shows him Saracon's severed finger and confirms that a DNA test has shown that he is indeed Malcolm's son. Nyssa looks into the depths of the cave and sees Lourdes' corpse, not knowing that she is her own mother. She asks Malcolm who she was and he lied that Lourdes was no one Nyssa knew.

   Over 5 months later, Malcolm and Nyssa were engaged in one of their sparring matches, which Malcolm enjoyed. Nyssa inflicted a minor cut on his neck before Malcolm disarmed and defeated her. He then used Lazarus pit water to heal the wound. A member of the League came in, informing them that Thea and Laurel arrived. Malcolm and Nyssa welcomed the two and Laurel requested Malcolm to revive Sara using the Lazarus Pit. He quickly refused, knowing it would do more harm than good. Laurel pointed out that he owed it to Sara since he killed her and had previously used the pit on Thea. However, Malcolm explained that Thea didn't die and the pit has never been used to bring a person back to life. He apologized to Laurel and warned her that it wouldn't be Sara who comes out of the pit.

   That night, Malcolm met Thea in her room to question her about how she was coping in the aftermath of being revived by the pit. He explained that the Lazarus Pit contains traces of all the people who have ever been in it and leaves its users with a bloodlust, which will be temporarily satisfied if Thea gives into her killer instinct, but she refused. Malcolm then claimed he knew of a man in the mountains with healing abilities who could possibly help and told Thea they will leave at sunrise to meet him. That night, Malcolm had two League members enter Thea's room to try and assassinate her. The next morning, he found them killed by Thea. Malcolm confirmed there was no cure for the bloodlust and he helped Thea by satiating it for a few weeks. He revealed the only known way to be free from the bloodlust was for Thea to kill the one who hurt her, which was impossible since Ra's was already dead.

   Later, Thea still refused to go on a killing spree, so Malcolm then allowed Sara to be resurrected by the Lazarus pit to appease his daughter. Sara rose, and everyone, including Malcolm, was shocked that it worked. After the ceremony, Sara jumped out of the pit and was restrained by two League members while Malcolm tranquilized her. Sara was later tied up and Thea, Laurel, and Malcolm visited her. Malcolm warned Laurel that they had no idea what was happening to Sara and that she should prepare for the worst. A League member then walked in, warning them something happened to Lazarus pit. The group found Nyssa standing over it, having destroyed the pit with her father's potion as revenge for Sara's resurrection. She swore to kill Malcolm, stating that there would be no coming back. A distraught Malcolm ordered the guards to take Nyssa away.

   Lawrence Tanner
   , a pedophile who lived three blocks away as a potential kill for her. Thea declined and before leaving, she ordered Malcolm to be gone before she returned or the police will know he's alive.

   Carter Hall

   Staff of Horus
   , an object previously used to kill Carter and Kendra in their past lives.
   When Savage escaped again, Malcolm organized a meeting between himself, Oliver, and Barry with Savage to negotiate a truce, explaining to a skeptical Oliver that negotiation was the only way to stop him from killing them all. At the meeting, Savage demanded Kendra and Carter, warned the Flash that if they refused, he would level all of Central City and then warned Green Arrow that he'll then travel to Star City and level it soon after and left. Malcolm stressed to Green Arrow and Flash that delivering Kendra and Carter to Savage was the only way to save both cities, but they told Malcolm that they will stop Savage without sacrificing them. Malcolm however, still skeptical, made it clear to Green Arrow that if they failed and Thea was harmed in any way, he would come for him. After the team was able to destroy Savage with his own staff, reducing him to ashes, Malcolm secretly collected what was left of his remains, stating Savage will "owe him one".

Despite having acquired the phone, Oliver stated that his only option is to turn himself in but Oliver injected himself with the same nano-technology used on Malcolm before, and Laurel and Malcolm found Oliver's location and headed out to find him. As Thea, Felicity, and John are about to be gassed to death, Black Canary and Malcolm (Dressed as Green Arrow) attacked H.I.V.E.'s men and freed the team. As the rest of the team tried to escape, Malcolm went after Damien himself. Using an explosive arrow, Malcolm knocked down Damien. However, Damien used his powers and Malcolm was levitated and almost choked to death until Oliver distracted him, allowing Malcolm to shoot Darhk with arrows. He left behind an explosive arrow that destroyed the facility but Darhk was still able to escape.

With no options left, Oliver suggested that Malcolm challenge Nyssa to a trial by combat. At the location of their fight, Oliver stepped in and took Nyssa's place. Oliver and Malcolm then dueled and after a brief but intense battle, Oliver subdued him and demanded that he hand over the ring. Malcolm defiantly refused, insisting that Oliver would have to kill him. Oliver, instead of killing him, cut off Malcolm's hand and knocked him out before giving the ring to Nyssa. After getting his amputation healed, Malcolm visited Nyssa, now Ra's al Ghul, at her request along with Oliver and Laurel.

Enraged, Thea ordered Malcolm out of her life, proclaiming she is done with his lies. Infuriated, Malcolm ranted that Thea would have been dead ten times over had he not turned her from a spoiled rich kid into a warrior and all he has gotten from her in return was venomous spite.

   Malcolm visited Damien in Iron Heights to inform him that H.I.V.E. wasn't going to rescue him as they’d grown tired of his tendency to kill fellow members at his pleasure. He quipped that they wish Damien luck in the trial. In anger, Damien attempted to use his magic on Malcolm, but to no avail. Malcolm simply laughed and sarcastically reminded him that performance issues are common for his age. However, Malcolm had secretly made a deal with Damien to return his destroyed idol to him and break him out of jail in exchange for sparing him and Thea from Genesis. Malcolm later met up with Damien's "ace in the hole",

  <p key="314ba32f-d19b-4d44-ba5b-52fb96ee2f21">
   To obtain the idol, Malcolm had several of his League followers to hijack a missile shipment into the city as a distraction for Oliver and John. He had Andy go with them undercover to ensure they remained away from the Arrowcave. While this occurred, Dark Archer breached the Arrowcave with several of his followers and stole the idol but was confronted by Thea. When Thea had him cornered though, she hesitated and Dark Archer managed to knock her out and fled with the idol. Malcolm snuck into Iron Heights to see Damien and presented the idol to him, but Damien revealed that a piece was missing and surmised that the team must have kept it hidden separately in case the idol was stolen. Later, Malcolm lured Team Arrow into a trap seemingly to kill Green Arrow, but it was really a set up for Andy to take the bullet, thereby gaining the team's trust enough to give up the last idol piece's location. Thanks to a prison break caused by
   Michael Amar/Murmur
   , Team Arrow was divided among the prison trying to contain it, allowing Malcolm to slip back in unnoticed. However, he ran into Thea and Laurel. Malcolm fought Thea alone and succeeded again, reminding his daughter that her hesitance to kill him will always stop her from truly beating him. Malcolm caught up with Damien after his powers had been restored and insisted they leave before the police arrive. Before doing so, Damien fatally stabbed Laurel with one of Green Arrow's own arrows. Malcolm escaped with Damien, Andy, and Michael soon after, but not before lingering in an apparent sign of regret.

   At Malcolm's behest, Thea was kidnapped by her boyfriend,
   Alex Davis
   (who had been brainwashed by Ruvé), and brought to
   Tevat Noah
   , H.I.V.E.'s underground bunker. At the safe haven, Malcolm spoke with Thea and revealed Damien's endgame, Genesis. He mentioned that Damien's idea was not much different from the Undertaking he had tried himself and believed that Genesis was truly their best option since the world was dying. Thea deemed him "insane" and demanded to see Alex. Malcolm agreed and took her to Alex, where he learned that
   Lonnie Machin
   had entered Tevat Noah and was killing Damien's men while threatening to destroy the air supply, which would kill everyone inside. When Alex asked who Machin was, Malcolm joked he was like an "ex-boyfriend" of Thea's, much to the latter's annoyance.

  <p key="44acca5f-7cea-459c-9765-5d082f3fe4dd">
   Malcolm and Thea snuck into the building which controlled Tevat Noah's air supply. Thea demanded a weapon but Malcolm denied it and told her to go to hand-to-hand with Machin if needed. As Thea tried to talk Machin down, Malcolm noticed multiple explosives in the building. He shot Machin in the shoulder and stopped him from blowing the place up, but Machin managed to escape.

  <p key="0aa0ebbc-2418-4036-9804-11c317148183">
   Malcolm later found Thea crying over Alex's body after he had been killed by Machin. Briefly expressing his condolences, Malcolm asked where Machin was but found he had vanished. Annoyed, he then ordered some Ghosts to take an angry and grieving Thea away for a "timeout". Knowing he lost all leverage against Thea after Alex's death, Malcolm tried to convince her to comply with his orders, as H.I.V.E. didn't need another "x-factor" after Machin's escape, but Thea refused. Malcolm then had the Ghosts hold Thea still as he forced her to swallow a H.I.V.E suggestion pill.

  <p key="df1629c1-6a5d-44ed-ae72-135929c3363f">
   Malcolm then talked with Ruvé, who scolded him for not having dealt with Machin. She then learned Oliver and Diggle had entered Tevat Noah and ordered Malcolm to take care of it. Using his drugged daughter as bait, Malcolm managed to capture Oliver and taunted him over his inability to do what is needed to win. As Diggle burst in and took out his soldiers, Malcolm and Thea were forced to flee. Ruvé then ordered all the citizens to kill Oliver and Diggle on sight. As Malcolm questioned this decision, Ruvé warned him if he could not take care of the two vigilantes, he might have no purpose in H.I.V.E.

  <p key="d9946a34-785f-4562-a968-249896520dbf">
   Malcolm, Thea, and a group of soldiers managed to find Oliver and Diggle and attacked them. Malcolm fought Diggle but was forced to give up as Thea overcame the drug and she and Oliver cornered Malcolm. The group then saw Machin on TV, who threatened to kill Ruvé and Damien's daughter,
   Nora
   , before triggering Tevat Noah's power source to destroy the facility if Damien didn't surrender himself. Malcolm informed Oliver and Diggle about Machin. When Thea confronted him over drugging her again, Malcolm stated they could "discuss [his] parenting philosophy later" as they had a more pressing situation at hand. Oliver ordered Malcolm to lead the evacuation of Tevat Noah while he, Diggle and Thea went after Machin.

   As Tevat Noah began to collapse, Malcolm evacuated the citizens. He later informed Damien that Ruvé had been killed by Machin while Nora was missing. Malcolm pointed out that their plan had failed and that even if Damien managed to destroy the world, there would be no Ark to stay safe. Damien however, claimed that if there is no place to be safe, he would let it all burn, much to Malcolm's shock.

Eobard choked Malcolm but Malcolm told him he would attempt to hypnotize Rip using a League of Assassins technique. This also failed, though it did allow Malcolm to discover that Hunter's memories truly were gone. Eobard expressed frustration with them and sped away.

Malcolm convinced Damien to bring Rip along and have him retrieve the box for them, and the three left for Switzerland. They infiltrated the box and Rip went to go get the box from the vault. While he was doing so, Damien and Malcolm discussed what Eobard was planning and why he even needed the two of them. Damien assumed that Malcolm was attempting to manipulate him, but they were interrupted by Rip failing to gain access to the vault. When the bank teller called security, the two intervened and killed the guards before escaping the bank with Rip.

He would have been killed had Rip not convinced them to stop dueling and find a way to even the odds against Eobard. They went back to the bank, leaving Rip tied up. Eobard returned to the base and Rip informed him of where they had gone. Thawne confronted them in the vault, where they had retrieved a disk containing Rip's memories.

A vicious fight between the Legends, the Legion, and Thawne's security guards erupted. Malcolm attacked Sara again when she managed to catch the spear. After a short fight, he was able to disarm her and Rory picked up the spear. Both sides tried to convince Rory to hand them the spear. Rory turned against the Legion and gave the spear to Amaya who was about to use the spear to turn reality back to normal. However, Snart froze her with his cold gun and killed her before she could. As everyone was distracted by the death of Amaya, Thawne took the spear back from Snart and threw it in the generator, destroying the spear. A smug Thawne told the Legends that he wanted to see them roam this world that was no longer theirs and was a reminder of their failure.

Malcolm brought out his bow and fired an arrow at Firestorm which hit them and made them split apart. He was about to fire an arrow at Stein when the future version of Jax jumped in the way and intercepted it, killing him.

The two engaged the officers that were escorting Chase to the helicopter, with Malcolm mentioning it would be easier if they just killed them.

He asked Thea to step off the landmine so he could take her place, but she refused. Curtis tried to suggest an alternative solution but Malcolm knew they didn't have time, so he pushed his daughter off the landmine and stepped on it before it could explode.

     , being two former members of the League of Assassins, could confront Eobard on equal terms. After learning that a second, even more powerful speedster was hunting him, he shrugged it off even though Eobard himself was terrified of it. Another piece of irony was how despite Oliver having been able to kill Ra's al Ghul, Malcolm showed absolutely no fear or hesitation to engage Oliver in combat, which may be arrogance in Malcolm's part, as he clearly believed having defeated Oliver twice, he could do it again. This arrogance cost Malcolm badly as Oliver not only proved how he had long since surpassed Malcolm by subjecting him to a swift defeat, but also cut off his hand and gave the Demon Head's Ring to Nyssa, effectively deposing Malcolm as Ra's.

However, he had a brusque way of showing his affections, which often pushed Tommy away; for example, Malcolm cut off Tommy's trust fund and harshly scolded his son as "worthless" in order to "jolt [him] into adulthood". After Tommy was killed during the Undertaking though, Malcolm was wracked with guilt, which led to him searching for ways to be a part of Thea's life. To this end, he began to pressure Moira into telling Thea that he was her biological father. When Moira was murdered, Malcolm swiftly returned to Star City to watch over Thea, despite still being hunted by the League of Assassins. Malcolm loved Thea as much as he loved Tommy and with similar harshness; when Thea requested to be taught how to fight, Malcolm gave his daughter no special treatment, though it should be noted his regime was effective since he turned Thea into a capable combatant within five months. Malcolm's strong parental instincts displayed themselves when he shot the assassin
     Chase
     for attempting to kill Thea and made Tommy's safety his priority during
     Floyd Lawton
     's attack on his humanitarian ceremony.

     However, some question whether Malcolm's ambition sometimes overpowered his love for his children; despite his grief over inadvertently causing Tommy's death, Malcolm manipulated Thea into killing Sara so that the League would mark Thea for death and force Oliver to fight the League's leader, Ra's al Ghul. If Oliver could kill Ra's, then Thea and Malcolm would both be saved from the League. This scheme was risky and placed Thea in danger, as well as emotionally scarring her since Sara was her friend. This indicates that Malcolm might not have learned everything he could from Tommy's death or it might display that despite having inadvertently killed his son, he remained daring enough to take the drastic, manipulative steps he thinks are required to beat an international organization of assassins. Malcolm was also noticeably indifferent to the ramifications of Sara's death on her family, despite having already hurt them by inadvertently and seemingly killing Sara previously with the sinking of the

     It should be noted that Malcolm's parental instincts extend in a limited way to Oliver despite his ruthless attitude towards the latter. After beating and unmasking the Arrow, Malcolm exhibited regret upon learning his enemy's identity, even genuinely apologizing for Oliver's suffering due to being on the sinking

Still, Malcolm's love remained centered on his two children and his apparent affection for Oliver did not prevent him from manipulating the latter into fighting Ra's al Ghul by using Thea as leverage, though he was absolutely confident Oliver had what it took to beat Ra's. Malcolm even stated that he has always viewed Oliver as a son and he truly enjoyed working with him while battling Ra's and the League. Despite their conflicts, Malcolm was ultimately truly sorry for the wrongs he has committed against Oliver and his family, always being willing to help Oliver out when he needed it.

Malcolm seemed set on redeeming himself, since he spared Danny and was willing to train Oliver. Afterwards, Malcolm started to work with Team Arrow, growing to respect and even care for them. During a battle with the League, Malcolm saved both Laurel and

Nonetheless, he genuinely thanked Oliver despite the latter swearing to never forgive Malcolm after what he did to Thea and Sara.

    Malcolm was displayed to have a deep interest in various warrior cultures, as seen with his office being decorated with Asian statues and Japanese swords. In a secret room adjoining his office, Malcolm additionally kept racks of swords and other weaponry from multiple cultures. He also supported the Buddhist monk
    Ken Zhi Jansen
    , whose temple he spent time meditating in.

When Laurel kept insisting, Malcolm firmly declared that he did not have obligations to anyone, and she did not get to make a request like that. Laurel and Thea did manage to convince him at the end, but this might partially have been because Malcolm wanted to prove his love for his daughter, since it was he who had made her kill Sara.

     in exchange for curing Thea's bloodlust, even though it would cost him the life of his daughter. In his obsession with the League's title, Malcolm completely disregarded that it was his decision to involve Thea in his enmity with the League that landed her in her current condition, instead accepting his daughter's death as an inevitable tragedy. As demonstrated by his shock and anger when Nyssa destroyed the
     Demon's Head ring
     , it was clear Malcolm only cared of the personal power the League brought him.

     After Malcolm was removed as Ra's al Ghul by Oliver in exchange for the
     Lotus

     H.I.V.E.
     out of anger and spite. Malcolm went as far as to reveal the existence of Oliver's son,

     , to Damien as revenge, even personally kidnapping William and bringing the child to Damien, proving that his paternal feelings for Oliver have been destroyed. This caused a severe strain in Malcolm's relationship with Thea, William's aunt. However, his love for her remains unscathed, since Malcolm's alliance with Damien was also based on him and his daughter being spared from
     Genesis
     . Despite his fallout with Oliver and Team Arrow after the League Civil War, Malcolm refrained from revealing important information about them to Damien, like their identities and the location of their base. He also lingered after Damien fatally stabbed Laurel with an arrow, indicating shock, or even regret, over his role in her death.

    <p key="ddb09b26-2cbf-4396-940b-1206dd5643fb">
     Despite his love for Thea, Malcolm had no tolerance for being disrespected by his daughter; when she disowned him after William's abduction, Malcolm coldly reminded Thea of how she used to be a weak, spoiled brat, whom he turned into a strong warrior, as well as pointing out her short-sightedness. He continued to use manipulation and coercion to keep his daughter close to him, such as leveraging
     Alex Davis
     , Thea's boyfriend and a brainwashed member of H.I.V.E., against her. After Alex's death, Malcolm resorted to drugging Thea again to keep her in line.

     Even though Malcolm was a parent, he was not above kidnapping innocent children, as proven when he kidnapped William (off-screen) in order to help Damien get leverage over Oliver that would force the latter to stop running for mayor of Star City. However, he seemed to despise individuals who exploited children for other purposes; Malcolm once tried to have Thea kill
     a pedophile
     to satiate her bloodlust.
    </p>
    Upon realizing that Damien would move forward with Genesis after the destruction of
    Tevat Noah
    , Malcolm re-joined forces with Team Arrow to save the world from nuclear annihilation. He also made a sarcastic and humorist comment to Oliver after his speech to the city, suggesting that his hatred for the latter might be lessening, although this feeling was hardly mutual. Despite his change of heart, Malcolm's relationship with Team Arrow was more strained than ever, especially with Oliver and Thea, due to him kidnapping William, brainwashing Thea a second time in Tevat Noah, and his role in Laurel's death (albeit indirectly).

     After the disembodiment of the League and Damien's death, Malcolm began living in squalor and alcoholism, having lost any sense of purpose, control, or leadership, and forced to contend with the death of most of his family and the hatred of his only daughter.

     a failure for his future death and madness that led him to almost destroy the world and his daughter in it. Despite this, Malcolm secretly feared Damien, begrudgingly respecting his skills as a warrior. His massive ego also clashed with Eobard's, the leader of the Legion, for treating him and Damien like "underlings" instead of as partners. Malcolm was undoubtedly the ringleader for the plot to trap Eobard in a bank vault as bait for the creature hunting him to forcefully make the speedster respect the two of them. In the
     Legion of Doom's alternate reality
     , Malcolm was the leader of the League, CEO of

     Despite Malcolm's immoral behavior, he lacks the sadistic streak that even his bloodthirsty teammates on the Legion of Doom have. Too cautious and intelligent to waste energy on an impractical vendetta to hurt his enemies, he strongly encouraged Damien and Eobard to simply erase the

     from the face of reality as they were too big of a threat in any state, proving that he recognized the group's potential. This ultimately proved to be the wise thing to do when the Legends regained their memories of the previous reality, leaving Eobard outraged that Malcolm was correct. Also, unlike Damien and Eobard, Malcolm seemed to retain some twisted sense of reason and compassion. He briefly offered Sara a genuine chance to rewrite the tragedies of her life if she joined the Legion of Doom. Whether this was a moment of pragmatism or atonement remains unclear.
    </p>
    After a year of failure in regaining his old life, Malcolm had given up on any hope of gaining control or leadership (even with the
    Thanatos Guild
    ) and instead dedicated himself to protecting Thea. He was more than willing to work with Oliver and (reluctantly) Nyssa to save her from

    after six years of planning and development, eventually managing to successfully achieve his plans and even outsmart Oliver, a feat that very few ever managed to do, by secretly commissioning and smuggling in a second
    Markov Device
    , all without attracting any suspicions until Moira finally exposed him.
    Malcolm was also successful in faking his death and staying hidden from both the League and Oliver for over a year.
    Malcolm drugged Thea with
    Vitura
    to influence her into killing Sara without remembering the deed in order to escape from the latter and have Oliver fight Ra's al Ghul in his place.
    Being also a key strategic advisor for Oliver during his conflict with Ra's al Ghul, Malcolm came up with the plan to dispose of the latter and install himself as the next
    Ra's al Ghul
    .
    After becoming the new Ra's al Ghul, Malcolm displayed his strong leadership skills by effectively leading the League until Nyssa took over and disbanded the group. He also founded and inspired loyalty from the
    Thanatos Guild
    , a group similar to the League, even after Nyssa disbanded the organization.
    After the Spear of Destiny altered reality, Malcolm was once again able to run Merlyn Global Group efficiently, regaining his status a well-respected businessman.

      Highly trained in the art of stage magic, including sleight-of-hand, escape artistry, and hypnotism, Malcolm's skills in these areas were one of the reasons he was called "The Magician" by the League of Assassins. He often performed a coin disappearing trick for his son,

However, his actions and nature as a liar make it difficult for people to ever believe him, as seen when Malcolm tried to convince Team Arrow of Oliver's false allegiance to Ra's and the threat of the
      Alpha-Omega
      virus.
      Due to his archery and combat skills, Malcolm was able to successfully portray himself to Damien Darhk as "Green Arrow" when Oliver was unable to.

      Malcolm was aware of the existence of magic and mysticism, knowing the existence of the
      Lazarus Pit
      . Since becoming Ra's al Ghul, he gained a greater understanding and knowledge of the pit and its functions, which allowed him to deduce why Thea was struggling with a bloodlust and knowing how to cure her (although it was for naught).
      Using this knowledge, he tracked down three other Lazarus Pits based on
      Earth
      's
      Ley lines
      , a feat practically unheard of.
      Malcolm was aware of Vandal Savage and his immortality long before Team Arrow could figure out and knew Damien Darhk's
      magic
      functioned.
      However, Malcolm was unable to figure out why Damien's magic backfired against Thea
      and unfamiliar with any potions that could counteract the effects of the Lazarus Pit, such as the

    : Malcolm was known for having a dense network of resources and connections all over Starling City, which played a part in his ability to execute the Undertaking, having allies that did the majority of his work for him. Even after the Undertaking, his network was still strong enough to fake his death, which Oliver suspected was due to his connections to the coroner's office. Malcolm orchestrated Moira's release and had her brought to him without eliciting suspicion. As Ra's Al Ghul, Malcolm had access to all the resources of the League of Assassins and commanded all their members, expanding heavily his contacts throughout the world, which allowed him to be immediately aware of Oliver's conflict with Vandal Savage and that Thea was kidnapped by Damien Darhk, even able to gain access to H.I.V.E's security code. Even after Nyssa al Ghul disbanded the League, Malcolm retained enough of his increased network that he was able to enter

    Malcolm acquired a cybernetic hand of unknown materials and origin while planning Damien Darhk's prison break.

This allows him to use a bow and complete various other tasks that would be impossible to do for one-handed individuals. This prosthetic is specifically built for his left hand, which was cut off by Oliver during their duel at the end of the League civil war. The prosthesis is seemingly capable of all known functions found in an organic hand, and has not been known to hamper Malcolm's dexterity. Given that it is made from top of the line technology, it presumably had the same degree of tactile sensitivity as a human hand, as such technology has been known to exist in contemporary science as of 2016. After Malcolm's death by a land mine, it is presumably destroyed.
