China then fled with the truck, as Turner and The Hood engaged in an intense fight. While fighting the police showed up and tried to arrest them, forcing both to flee the scene.
  </p>
  <p key="abdf9b07-e71a-43ee-8fb9-86bd018875cd">
   During a third raid, they were again confronted by the Hood. This time Turner and China double teamed The Hood. During the brawl, the Hood knocked down China. Ben attacked The Hood but they were separated when

   almost ran them over while driving the truck away. China following, Diggle and Turner, lured the Hood in a labyrinth of piled up crates. He then managed to sneak up on the Hood twice, cutting him with his claws and disappearing before The Hood could respond. A third time, the Hood sensed him coming and shot multiple arrows at him. While blocking most, an arrow struck him straight in the shoulder. Turner was skeptical that The Hood thought he could stop him. He stabbed at the Hood, though the Hood pressed a button and the arrow electrocuted him, incapacitating him. On the news it was revealed that he and China White were incarcerated.

   After concluding his contract with the arms dealer, they were attacked by the Arrow, who quickly incapacitated the arms dealer and one of his henchmen. Turner managed to sneak up on the Arrow and stabbed him in the shoulder. He then got attacked by Roy. The weapons dealer then tried to detonate the device into creating an earthquake. Surprised by the supernatural strength of Roy, Turner ultimately was overpowered and knocked down. The Arrow managed to get Roy to assist him into destroying the device in time.

   In late 2014, Bronze Tiger was working as part of the Suicide Squad, killing members of the extremist sect

   Afterwards, he and Deadshot were training in the
   A.R.G.U.S. headquarters
   , taking out ten men in 7 seconds.
   Later, he and the rest of the squad were deployed to head to Kahndaq to take out Onslaught, with Diggle joining them. Bronze Tiger disguised himself as a member of Onslaught, and, following a distraction provided by Lawton, began killing members. After
   Ravan Nassar
   deployed a bomb near an Onslaught truck, the Squad found a survivor, hoping to use him to lead them to
   Khem-Adam

   Derek Sampson

  </p>
  <p key="6fff9502-e326-44c0-9bb5-a41658831563">
   Days later, Turner was released from solitary. When Oliver approached him, Brickwell and Sampson in the cafeteria, Turner was about to attack him before being told to stand down. The three of them later went to Oliver in the courtyard regarding the removal of prison guard
   Peter Yorke
   and Turner handed Oliver a knife.
  </p>
  <p key="847ad5d3-98d1-4de2-ac20-fac3c974befa">
   Brick then made a deal with Oliver to arrange a meeting with the inmate known as â

   â. However, Brick set Oliver up, sending Turner and two other inmates to kill him. Oliver managed to defeat the attackers, tied Turner up and interrogated him. Turner then revealed that Brick was holding wrestling matches in the prison. Oliver then forced Turner to take him to Brick. Ben argued that Oliver was unfair in his judgment of others, revealing how he saved Lyla Michaels from Gholem Qadir, surprising Oliver due to Diggle never telling him about it. After arriving at the wrestling match, Turner watched Oliver battle Sampson. Later, he, Sampson, and Brick saw Oliver as he was being sent to Level 2 of the prison.

   Turner was later framed by another prisoner,
   Stanley Dover
   , for the murder of Officer Dunbar. Stanley has stabbed Dunbar repeatedly in the showers, before planting one of Turner's knives behind one of the tiles and asking Oliver to "prove his innocence". Olive then found Turner's knife and presented the evidence to the security guards, resulting in Stanley being released and Turner imprisoned in solitary once again. However, a slip of the tongue of Stanley's has alerted Oliver to his guilt, as he "overheard" that it was Turner's knife that was planted to "frame" him.

   On his day of release from Slabside, Oliver went to the solitary, apologizing to Turner and promising to contact
   A.R.G.U.S.
   regarding his situation. Turner initially refused to accept the apology, distrusting Oliver to keep his word, but Oliver referenced Lyla Michaels' experience with Turner, saying that maybe he deserved another chance if he tried to reform and become a hero. Although cautious about teaming up with Oliver, Turner later joined him when the prison was compromised by

Turner ended up confronting Sampson in a one-on-one battle, managing to throw him from high ground, leading to Sampson catching on fire, killing him.

   's new, more heroic approach to stopping criminals rather than killing them outright. Turner can also be relentless and stubborn, having been shot with an arrow (not knowing it was electrified) and said that it won't stop him. He is shown to be a bit like a mercenary. He knew about the
   earthquake device
   and it's devastating effects, but didn't care so long as he got paid. Turner also shows curiosity about his clients, such as why someone would break him out of prison or why someone would want the earthquake device.

   In addition, Turner also does not tolerate anyone who believes they understand him, such as when Oliver only thought him to be a criminal who had no ethics, revealing to the latter that he had saved his friend, Lyla Michaels' life when at the time, he had a choice not to. Turner also seems to value himself as honorable.

However, Turner is not without redeeming qualities and a heart, as compared to the completely amoral manner displayed by Brick and Sampson, not only did he take the time to tell Oliver that he was the one who saved Lyla's life, which earned him the benefit of a doubt from Oliver, but Turner also didn't look at all pleased to see Oliver being moved to Level Two of Slabside, even seemingly looking sad. Even after Turner was framed by
   Stanley Dover
   for the murder of officer Dunbar and Oliver accused him of it and he became more vengeful against Oliver and aimed to kill him, when Oliver gave him a chance to redeem himself by siding with him against their inmates and
