Cisco is hesitant, but the older man reminds him that this way his friend won't have to die, while Earth-1 Barry pleads for his friend not to do it. Reluctantly, Cisco opens the breach allowing Earth-90 Barry through. Once on the treadmill he begins running at super speed again, Cisco opens another breach for them to escape through, everyone leaves as Cisco forces Barry to come with them. Now that Earth-90 Barry is left alone in the room, he holds onto his final moments of remembering his wife Tina before the energy destroys him. He managed to stop Earth-1's immediate destruction, saving everyone. All that is left behind is the lightning bolt symbol from his chest.

To make things even more difficult, logistically, Williams' costume, specially modified to give off a pulsating electric aura, was expensive to transport between the two filming locations to accommodate Williams' series and the crossover. "His costume is a very involved piece of equipment that has to be traveled (and) has a separate handler that has to travel with it", explained Guggenheim in an interview with Variety. "It was suggested to me at one point, by one of the money people, "Does Black Lightning really have to wear his costume in the crossover?". He has to wear that costume.
