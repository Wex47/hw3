   Dinah was an undercover cop going by the name "Tina Boland" to protect her family. In 2010, she was called to Captain
   David Singh
   's office for her newest job. They were joined by a fellow undercover cop,

   Sean Sonus
   , whose gang Sobel had been undercover in for a while. Vincent warned Dinah that Sonus was dangerous, but she still accepted the assignment. Over the next three years working together in Sonus' gang, Dinah and Vincent fell in love and began an intimate relationship.

   One night during their undercover mission, Tina was helping Sonus stay in the dark regarding the funding for his operations. She asked for a little bit more information but quickly backed off before Sonus got suspicious. After leaving for the night with Vincent, the two discussed what Tina's discovery from his books that Sonus had some money hidden away. The two then shared a kiss.

  <p key="25d4aaf7-020a-4e28-8faf-eda51c725174">
   After Vincent found out that Sonus caught wind of a cop had infiltrated his organization, he suggested to Tina that they call Singh and bust Sonus' operations now. However, Tina disagreed, reminding Vincent that they don't have enough on Sonus' illegal dealings to take him down. Vincent was worried that Sonus discovered one of them was the mole, to which Tina assured him that had Sonus found out, either one of them would've been dead already. Vincent then agreed to go along with Tina's plan.

   The following night, Tina was playing cards with Sonus' right-hand man,

   Afterward, Dinah was able to capture Declan and brought him to her apartment room 511. There, Dinah inflected the same torture on Declan which he did to her, demanding to know Sonus' whereabouts. During this, Green Arrow and Wild Dog barged in. Before they could do anything, Dinah screamed at Declan in close range, snapping his neck. Wild Dog managed to dampen Dinah's powers with a sonic dampener. The three were soon attacked by Sonus' men. While Green Arrow and Wild Dog were distracted, Dinah escaped out the window. However, Green Arrow chased after her and shot a dummy arrow to knock her to the ground. Helping her up, Green Arrow continued to try and persuade Dinah to let them help her take down Sonus without anyone dying in the process. Green Arrow tried to explain they aren't so different, as they've both struggled to cope with trauma in their lives. Unfortunately, Dinah still wasn't interested, and knowing they were out of the sonic dampener's reach, used her powers to escape.

   Finally tracking Sonus to his hideout, Dinah swiftly dispatched his men and entered his office. Sonus, however, wasn't afraid to see Dinah again and revealed that he was affected by the particle accelerator explosion as well, using his sonic wave ability to disorientate her. Just before Sonus could finish Dinah off, Green Arrow and Wild Dog showed up and saved her.

   Waking up a few hours later, Dinah proceeded to continue her vendetta. But Green Arrow, in his persistence, asked Dinah again to let them help her. She denied them once again and left. As Dinah was leaving on her motorcycle, the Green Arrow appeared in front of her, revealing his identity as

  <p key="7ff4e90f-40c0-4d2b-9835-793d0551e966">
   Following Dinah's lead, the team tracked Sonus to a rooftop, bringing in a large shipment of a new drug called Slide. With Mr. Terrific's help on comms, Dinah, Green Arrow, and Wild Dog interrupted the meeting. After dampening Sonus' powers, taking down his men, and destroying the inbound helicopter, Dinah held Sonus at gunpoint, ready to kill him. Green Arrow tried to talk her out of it, asking her what Vincent would've wanted. However, Dinah pulled the trigger and killed Sonus, saying Vincent would've wanted that. She then left the scene.

   Ultimately not feeling any better than before, Dinah tracked down Oliver and learned he was the mayor of Star City. Entering his office, Oliver was surprised to see her again. Dinah expressed her disappointment in not getting closure after killing Sonus and wondered how Oliver does what he does, to which he admitted to still be working on it himself. Dinah then revealed that she and Vincent were lovers and she hated herself more than Sonus for not preventing his death. Oliver assured her that his team is about finding redemption, revealing Wild Dog and Mr. Terrific's true identities as

When Felicity's trail to find Walker hit a dead end, Dinah suggested tracking the burner phone which he used in the states, since criminals tend to follow the same habits. Using the information, Felicity tracked Walker to a Russian church. Dinah remained outside to keep watch. When the mission went sideways, she saved Oliver and Diggle from one of Walker's men, whom they took prisoner.

Oliver and Dinah got out but found the terrorists' guns pointed at them. Fortunately, Anatoly arrived in time to provide backup. After securing the nuke and arresting Walker, the team celebrated at a Russian club, where Dinah impressed Anatoly with her ability to hold her vodka.

Dinah and Diggle went out to chase down some leads on Edlund's whereabouts. After a dead-end, Diggle brought up Dinah still living in H.I.V.E.'s headquarters again. After some persuasion, Dinah revealed the reason she hasn't applied for an apartment was that she doesn't feel normal enough to settle down her roots. Diggle confided in her that he felt the same way after returning deployment and advised Dinah to permit herself to be normal again.

Anatoly then revealed that Oliver invited him to Star City to steal these drugs in exchange for taking Chase out.

   The team regrouped at Felicity's loft the next day to discuss this latest development. Dinah questioned why Rene wasn't in City Hall with Oliver and Lance, to which Diggle revealed that Quentin banned him from City Hall until Chase was taken down. That night, Curtis discussed the role reversals and how Diggle was "the new Oliver" and he was "the new Felicity", but then asked who the new Diggle was. Dinah and Rene answered at the same time. When Dinah didn't argue further about it, Curtis and Rene agreed that Dinah was the new Diggle. When a discussion broke out on why they're not letting the Bratva kill Chase, Dinah remained quite as Diggle explained that they aren't saving Chase, but Oliver. The computer in front of Dinah then started beeping, revealing Chase's trip to his safehouse. The team left to stop the Bratva.

   for his assistance. Arriving there, the three found some marital issues going on between Diggle and Lyla. Determining that Oliver and Felicity were trapped in the bunker, the five planned to break them out. While Dinah, Rene, Curtis, and Diggle went to the bunker, Lyla would get the supplies they needed.

   At the entrance to the bunker, Dinah and Diggle monitored Curtis and Rene's progress as they tried cutting through the elevator. Dinah was amused listening to Curtis and Rene bicker and joked that they would make a great couple. Dinah then noticed how off Diggle was and asked if everything was alright between him and Lyla. To help ease Diggle's worries, Dinah confided in him how she and Vincent had to keep secrets from each other due to their jobs. Lyla then arrived with the supplies Curtis needed.

   Rene and Curtis came back up after a methane gas explosion in the elevator halted their efforts. Using knowledge from one of her undercover ops, Dinah recommended using hydrochloric acid to safely melt the titanium hatch. Rene and Curtis returned after trying Dinah's suggestion and revealed that the acid would take too long to melt the hatch enough for them to enter the bunker. Lyla then returned with a modified version of Curtis's T-Sphere they could use.

  <p key="ed5a680b-032f-4e16-8d32-a4cc321d853d">
   Curtis was able to use the improved T-Sphere to break a wall in the bunker. Using the device's surveillance, Dinah and the team were able to see that Oliver and Felicity were okay. The team managed to guide Oliver and Felicity before the remaining methane gas could ignite, though Oliver was severely injured. Getting him to A.R.G.U.S.'s
   headquarters
   , Dinah and the others were relieved upon hearing of Oliver's recovery.

   When a dead body by the name of
   Henry Goodwin
   was sent to City Hall by Chase, Dinah was on the scene investigating. She informed Oliver and Quentin that Goodwin had no connection to Chase and chocked him sending the body due to being "crazy". Oliver asked Dinah to pull any forensics that is on the body and find a connection to either Chase or his father,
   Justin Claybourne
   . After doing so, Dinah was shocked to find Oliver's father,
   <a href="Robert Queen.html" key="a71c6f99-4b90-4412-a389-90637bf62c54" title="Robert Queen">

   Dinah and Mr. Terrific were later staking out
   Derek Sampson
   , one of the convicted criminals were released because Chase prosecuted them. They found that Sampson was running guns, but didn't have enough evidence to move on him. When Sampson was moving out, Dinah and Curtis were about to follow when Overwatch contacted them, revealing that Oliver and Spartan were in trouble at Oliver Enterprises. The two arrived just in time to save Oliver and Spartan from sinking in cement. Back at the bunker, the team learned that while Dinah and Terrific were saving Oliver and Spartan, Sampson made off with two of the three chemicals Chase's father used to weaponize
   tuberculosis
   four years ago. They deduced that Sampson must be working with Chase. Quentin and Rene then entered, revealing they found someone who could help with the Goodwin mystery; a lawyer named
   Darren Coffman
   , who represented both Goodwin and Claybourne.

  <p key="38cd2fd3-5580-4ee4-b5a3-6b0b811d9dc2">
   Dinah and Mr. Terrific were able to track Sampson to Fairbanks Chemical, a laboratory that had the third chemical Sampson needed: cyclotrizane. Oliver met up with them. The three were able to take down many of Sampson's men, but couldn't stop him from escaping with the cyclotrizane. With the sampled they retrieved, Curtis was able to deduce that what Chase was planning would be worse than what his father planned with no cure. Wanting all hands on deck, Oliver asked Dinah where Rene was and she told him he was with Quentin handling something personal.

Green Arrow, however, was busy fighting Prometheus, so Dinah and Wild Dog joined Spartan and Mr. Terrific in fighting Sampson. When he was on the verge of killing Wild Dog, Dinah saved him by using her scream against Sampson. Mr. Terrific was then able to stop the spread of the virus and Green Arrow was able to capture Prometheus. With Prometheus in A.R.G.U.S. custody and the city safe, the team went out for drinks to celebrate.

Oliver then pulled out a device that Curtis made and gave it to Dinah; It will control her powers and allow her to bypass the sonic dampener.

A fight then broke out, with Dinah battling Black Siren. After an equally-matched fight, both Dinah and Laurel used their sonic cries on each other, with the resulting shockwave knocking Dinah against a nearby rail with pottery, briefly incapacitating her. As Black Siren moved to finish her off, mocking Dinah on how she thought she could "replace" her, Quentin used Dinah's bo-staff to knock Black Siren out. Dinah assured Quentin that he didn't have to do that, but he disagreed and helped her up. Dinah and Quentin returned to the group in time to see Oliver defeat Chase and renounce his guilt over his father's suicide. Dinah and the rest were then horrified to hear that Chase had killed Oliver's son. Oliver, however, didn't believe him and Chase escaped. Oliver ordered everyone to get to Chase's plane and get off the island as he had rigged it to explode. He then went after Chase to find his son.

   Slade, however, abandoned the team and headed for the ship himself. Diggle and Dinah then suggested using the plane as shelter. Everyone except Thea and Samantha got on the plane. Dinah and the others were able to survive the explosion and she and Quentin opted to check the monastery for survivors.

   Arriving at the monastery, they found all of Talia's cult members dead. Dinah suggested searching by herself in case they find Black Siren, but Lance assured her he was fine. Dinah urged Quentin to have a sword in case Talia was alive, but he preferred a gun. Just then, Dinah was ambushed by Black Siren and had a knife to her throat. Before Laurel could kill her, Quentin acted on impulse and shot Laurel in the stomach. Believing she was dead, Dinah and Quentin decided to tell the others she died in the explosion, not wanting them to know Quentin killed her. They returned to the group and left the island with Chase and Samantha dead and Thea in a coma.

   Five months later Dinah had been promoted to a lieutenant and got a
   new suit
   . After Team Arrow apprehended
   Alex Faust
   , a known terrorist, and brought him to the precinct, Dinah was assigned to interrogate him. Dinah questioned where Faust got the hired gun and grabbed his injured arm to get him to talk. Faust refused to give her anything and requested a drink. Getting nowhere, Dinah left the interrogation room. The officer on duty then told Dinah that Quentin had missed his appointment to oversee the police officer graduation. At that moment, Dinah received a message from Quentin to meet him. Before leaving, Dinah told the officer to get Faust a drink.
  </p>
  <p key="196fe179-3a86-48f3-9554-ae31ae351fba">
   Dinah met Quentin at a bar, who had three shots lined up for him. Dinah sat next to him and thanked him for calling her instead of drinking. Quentin then started pouring out his guilt for what he did to Black Siren on Lian Yu five months ago and that all he can do is drink to make it go away. Dinah assured Quentin that he was stronger than that and that Laurel wouldn't want that from him. Quentin rebutted by asking which Laurel. The two then sat in silence.
  </p>
  <p key="8818b423-81c3-48a1-bf83-a9aaefaae16b">
   After Faust was able to escape while destroying most of the SCPD, Dinah was able to get video footage and discovered that Black Siren was alive and that she and her
   group
   broke Faust out. She showed Oliver, Quentin, and Rene the footage and assured Oliver that no one else saw it. They took the footage back to the bunker where the team questioned Dinah and Quentin about Black Siren's survival. Knowing Quentin didn't want to reveal the truth yet, Dinah stood with her claim that Laurel was dead when they found her. The team then decided to wait on A.R.G.U.S. for a lead on Laurel.
  </p>
  <p key="1c86212e-3987-465d-b0df-21a75cf35cb4">
   Having a lead on Black Siren, Black Canary suited up and went with the team. She stood in front of the van Laurel was in and stopped it with her scream. Canary and Siren got into a fight while the others dealt with her muscle. Siren was able to overpower Canary and use her bo staff to knock her and Quentin on the ground. Recovering, Canary saw Spartan miss a shot on a mercenary and watched helplessly as Wild Dog was shot off the bridge with Green Arrow saving him. While Quentin and Curtis took Rene to Doctor
   Elisa Schwartz
   for treatment, Dinah, Oliver, and Diggle regrouped back at the bunker. After Oliver gave Felicity something to track Laurel, he questioned if Dinah knew any reason why Quentin would think Laurel was after him. Lying, Dinah said she no idea. Felicity was able to track where Laurel was last and Dinah and Diggle went to investigate.
  </p>
  <p key="a3a0fb59-bd73-43a1-8296-866716524832">
   Canary and Spartan arrived at the warehouse only to find it empty. Believing they left something behind, the two vigilantes looked around. While searching, Canary questioned if Spartan was feeling all right as she never saw him miss like he did that mercenary on the bridge. Changing the subject, Spartan brought up how Canary was acting after Oliver asked her about Black Siren targeting Quentin and that he didn't find her convincing. Their discussion was interrupted when they discovered plans for City Hall. Realizing they were after City Hall for the graduation ceremony, Canary and Spartan went to warn the others.
  </p>
  <p key="2b76deef-cbaa-4331-8996-ea099a47e983">
   Bringing the plans back to the bunker, Lance decided to tell what happened on Lian Yu. While Dinah opted against it to spar Quentin the guilt, he assured her it was fine. After Quentin told the team he shot Laurel to save Dinah, Dinah defended Quentin's actions and said she was the one who told him not to tell the others. Quentin opted to use himself as bait at the graduation ceremony, much to the reluctance of the other. The team then headed for the ceremony while Diggle stayed back to run comms.
  </p>
  <p key="85fd1b48-5ba8-4c77-a50e-5d6d89e93fd0">
   At the ceremony, Dinah kept watching with Felicity and Curtis while Oliver gave his speech. They grew suspicious when Laurel and her group didn't show up. Much to their horror, it turns out that Black Siren targeted their bunker and the blueprints were planted as a diversion. Black Canary and the others quickly arrived where she and Siren got into another fight. Siren overpowered Canary but retreated when the odds were turning against her and set off explosives to cover her escape.
  </p>
  <p key="920cf640-ce4c-42f8-9587-e9b38f5741d4">
   After the battle, the team deduced that Siren was using the bombing on the SCPD and the bunker as a cover to steal something. The team decided to do an inventory to see what was missing. During the inventory, Dinah found that Diggle never fired his gun during the fight. She went to confront him about it and wasn't pleased by him lying to her. Curtis arrived and revealed that Laurel had taken one of his prototype T-Spheres. Worried, Dinah questioned if that meant the sphere wasn't weaponized, to which Curtis confirmed. That eased Dinah, as that meant they couldn't use it against them but left them wondering what could they do.

   After Oliver was exposed as the Green Arrow to the public by a photo sent to
   Channel 52

   Christopher Chance

   FBI

   Things soon went from bad to worse, as Anatoly and his Bratva arrived in Star City and kidnapped Markovian diplomats with Oliver unable to do anything without being exposed. Hearing of the incident, Dinah and Diggle waited in Oliver's office for him. While waiting, Dinah asked, again, if Diggle was all right, to which assured he was and that he didn't appreciate her in his business. Before the two could continue, Oliver and Quentin arrived. The group then suspected that it was Anatoly who leaked the photo of Oliver. The team then left, while Oliver stayed behind, to find out where Anatoly was hiding.

  <p key="d20cceb7-3988-4111-9cb7-0298932064d1">
   Learning Anatoly was at a Bratva run restaurant, Canary, Spartan, and Mister Terrific waited for Green Arrow to arrive. After the archer arrived, the team went in. Canary and Spartan were given the instructions to handle the guards while Terrific watched the perimeter and Green Arrow extracted the Markovians. After Canary took out the Bratva on her end, she saw Spartan unable to shoot and instead took down a guard with his hands. After this, Canary was left frustrated by Spartan's continued lies. Green Arrow was able to rescue three out of the four diplomats, as Anatoly took their CEO
   Alec Tarkov

   Back in Oliver's office, Dinah and the others watched as Felicity pulled up surveillance of Anatoly fleeing the scene with Tarkov. Before leaving to meet up with Lance and Rene, Oliver told Dinah and Diggle to be ready when Felicity had a location on Anatoly, to which they agreed. Oliver soon got footage from Anatoly of the now infected Tarkov and that if he did not pay 20 million dollars, he will die. Oliver sent the footage to the team, where they learned it was Tetrodotoxin. Dinah and Diggle went to Starling General, where Dr. Schwartz gave them to antidote. After Dr. Schwartz gave Dinah the antidote, she overheard the doctor talking to Diggle about pain medication. After Schwartz left Demanding to know what was wrong with him, Diggle finally told her that he got hit by shrapnel during the explosion on Lian Yu and that it caused degenerative nerve damage. When Diggle assured Dinah that he was fine, she didn't believe him and said they should leave to save Tarkov.
  </p>
  <p key="ec5be715-ba66-465c-90cc-a1a05d1e9daf">
   The team soon arrived at an abandoned warehouse and started searching for Anatoly and Tarkov. Canary had Spartan's back but was soon put in a chock hold by a Bratva member. Canary was able to get out of the hold and take down the thug but glared at Spartan in disappointment. After the mission ended with Anatoly executing Tarkov, Dinah was practicing her bo staff routine in the bunker when Diggle came up to apologize for not being straight with her and that it almost cost her life. Dinah was able to convince Diggle to talk to Oliver about his situation and go from there.

  <p key="ea66a23f-ee28-4632-a7c1-a8426538e77e">
   Unfortunately, Diggle didn't have the chance to tell Oliver as the latter asked him to do the Green Arrow mantle for him. One night, the team, with the newly suited Green Arrow, were tracking Faust and Canary got eyes on him before one of his goons shot at her. When Green Arrow jumped off a building, Canary used her scream to propel him to the building that Faust was in. The team was soon able to apprehend Faust and turn him over to the authorities. Back at the bunker, after Felicity went home for the night, Dinah continued to push Diggle to tell Oliver the truth. But, Diggle assured Dinah that his tremor was gone and he was back to full strength. Dinah decided to let it go, while still being unconvinced.

   After a break-in at
   Kord Industries
   left multiple casualties, Dinah was on the scene. She spoke to Officer Lopez, who told her that
   whoever
   broke in stole something from the computers that the company is unaware of yet. After the officer left, Dinah contacted Felicity and Curtis, who guided her to a port to download the Kord Industries database. Curtis learned that the assailant downloaded a schedule for Kord Industry's next shipment of nerve gas.
  </p>
  <p key="c1cc7fc5-723e-44cb-a2d5-c3b7ecc67b47">
   The team rendezvoused with the shipment and planned to ambush the assailant. While Green Arrow was in the front, Canary, Wild Dog, and Mister Terrific remained in the back with the gas. When the assailant arrived and took out the Green Arrow, Canary and the others ambushed her in the back. They were, unfortunately, blindsided by her lightning grenades and her backup. The team was unable to stop her as she used the gas to destroy a building full of people. Arriving back at the bunker, Dinah defended Diggle when Rene jumped down his throat for not giving orders when they needed them. The team then went to the control room, where Felicity told the team that the woman they encountered was named Onyx Adams, who was the leader of a Black Ops in the CIA. Felicity told them that her team vanished with over 100 million dollars. The team then went about to find out why she and her team would risk their fortune by stealing nerve gas.

   During one of Dinah's bo staff routines, Diggle came up to talk with her. He thanked Dinah for having his back, but she made it clear that she didn't do it for him, but the team; they needed a chain of command or else they would fall apart. Their conversation then went into Diggle's injury, and Dinah told Diggle that she's become worried about his mindset. They were interrupted by Felicity, who had a lead. She revealed that not all of her Black Ops members defected with her and that two of the three were killed in terrorist attacks in the past year. The team deduced that Onyx was after the last defector,
   Rob Reynolds
   , to tie up loose ends. Felicity then showed them footage of what the gas could do to a populated area.

  <p key="57097b81-0315-4f13-b650-e2cc24001a6f">
   Curtis was able to track Reynolds to a hotel. Before leaving, Dinah took Rene to the side and questioned his attitude. Rene stood by his position and left Dinah wondering the same. Canary rode in with Green Arrow and was assigned to help Terrific to find the gas. They were temporarily blindsided by Onyx's grenades but managed to withstand it thanks to Terrific's latest invention. Canary and the team were able to take down Onyx's men but were too late to stop her from releasing the gas. Canary was able to protect everyone by using her scream to push the gas way. Canary and Terrific then used one of Onyx's grenades to ignite the gas while they got the people to safety. Green Arrow and Wild Dog were also able to apprehend Onyx and Reynolds.

   After the mission, the team celebrated with drinks and Dinah stood to the side while Rene apologized for doubting Diggle's leadership. Dinah was then impressed when Felicity and Curtis showed Diggle the
   Green Monster
   , a crossbow that Diggle could use to shoot arrows, instead of a bow. She then watched in amazement as Diggle used the crossbow for the first time on tennis balls and didn't miss once. When they were alone, Dinah told Diggle she was finally convinced that Diggle's injury was taken care of gave him confidence about him making the tough decisions.

   Veronica Medina
   the same way. The team, minus Felicity, were in the bunker trying to figure out what Laurel was planning. Dinah informed them that the police had nothing and the group then hit the streets to find where Laurel was hiding.

The others caught up with her, only for Dinah to report that she got away. The team regrouped back at the bunker where Dinah revealed that all three victims had their fingerprints scanned. With that, and how unremarkable the three victims were, the team realized that they were undercover operatives. Thanks to Curtis, the team was able to deduce that Laurel was at the old
   Helix Headquarters
   with Cayden James. Diggle informed them that Felicity was in danger and the team quickly moved out.

Felicity was able to get Alena to Starling General and once she returned to the bunker, Dinah was the first to ask about Alena's condition. After Felicity was done blaming herself for what happened, the team got to work. Thanks to both Felicity and Curtis, the group learned that the three victims were members of the International Domain Name Directory; a company that controls the internet. The team then realized that Laurel had stolen those fingerprints to gain access to the IDND's
   vault

The team then entered the vault and were soon attacked by Cayden Jame's men. Canary and the others covered Felicity as she went to stop James's virus from destroying the internet. The team was successful and returned to the bunker. At the bunker, Dinah and the team were amused when Oliver, who had assisted as Overwatch, started acting as the leader again.

As she waited, she noticed a spotting light reflecting in one of the windows, immediately triggering a sniper alarm and protecting Emily. She passed this information on to the team, who discovered that the Vigilante was responsible for the launch. Consequently, Dinah began to observe Pollard from hiding, noticing the Avenger near her late at night. She immediately ran up to him and when she saw that he was going to attack, she shouted at him, destroying his visor. The battered criminal pulled off his mask, revealing his identity. The sight surprised Dinah, who froze. After a short time, she returned to the bunker, where she introduced the team that Vincent Sobel - Drake's ex-partner and boyfriend - was hidden under the mask of Vigilante. Based on the captured shell, the heroes tracked down the criminal's hideout, where there was a large supply of ammunition. Dinah couldn't understand why he was doing this and why he was pretending to be dead, venting his emotions in training until Diggle revealed that Pollard would be interviewing Channel 52 where she would be unprotected. The policewoman went there immediately and set up her men, as did Agent Watson for the FBI agents. As soon as the lights went out, Dinah changed her clothes and saved the councilor from the Vigilante. This moment later shielded the heroine from a policeman's shot, hitting her in the head. His regenerative powers healed him immediately, which surprised the woman who let him go, hiding this fact from the team. On her way home, she was stopped by Agent Watson, who revealed her assumptions about who was hiding under the hood of the new Black Canary.

   In Oliver's absence, a team led by John investigated a criminal gang, but their leader managed to escape. As it turned out, thanks to Felicity's efforts, their opponent was Ricardo Diaz - a man known by the code name Dragon, a criminal who will not bow to anything. The heroes tried to get him, eliminating most of his men, but he managed to escape again, throwing the ball towards Diggle. Upon returning to the hideout, the avengers rethought their actions and discovered that Diaz was behind the production and sale of a steroid that would increase combat abilities and concentration. Thanks to John's informant, the heroes obtained the address of his laboratory, where they eventually went. Unfortunately for them, everything was destroyed and Diaz managed to escape once again. After a few hours, Diggle decided to tell his friends the truth that he was taking Ricardo to get rid of the hand vibrations that resulted from the wounds he received on Lian Yu. The team accepted the soldier's apology, and Curtis agreed to help his friend in the same way he helped Smoak get out of his wheelchair.

   Dinah and his team visited the hideout when Oliver was arrested by the FBI. However, no one could show the city that the Green Arrow is Queen and that after his arrest, the Avenger will stop appearing, so they decided to continue. Upon learning that Cayden James was working with the Black Mermaid again, they decided to attack them at the company they were breaking into. There, however, Diggle suffered a pain attack and had to send the team alone, but failed to catch the enemy. Holt, understanding the reason for the attack, took his friend to the hospital, where Dr. Schwartz looked after him. All the while, Drake carried out police duties until she finally had to put on her costume again and fight the hacker, with the help of Oliver, who was released on bail. Together with him, they discovered that James was taking revenge on the archer for killing his son - Owen Post. Despite trying to capture the criminal, he managed to escape, making the anti-avengers law come into force, making it difficult for the heroes.

   The entire team attended Oliver and Felicity's wedding, with Dinah spending most of the time with Curtis and Rene on the call from Vincent, whom she decided to meet at the back of the building. The man wanted to live by her side again, but the woman was not ready for it, as she still couldn't understand what Sobel had become and ordered him to leave town, threatening not to let him go and put him behind bars at the next meeting. After the wedding, Dinah visited the hideout, where it was revealed that the band was on a mission without her. Immediately afterwards, it became known that Queen, Felicity and John were informed that someone on the team was going to testify against the mayor in front of Agent Watson. The three suspected Dinah, whom they rejected from the crew, confessing that they had spied on both Rene and Curtis, leading to an altercation of trust. It turned out, however, that it was Ramirez, whose FBI agent had pushed him to the wall, threatening him that if he did not help, his daughter would never see her father again. The confession upset Queen, who kicked the boy from the team. A few hours later, after talking frankly with Thea, Oliver gave the band a second chance, getting ready to take Quentin back from Cayden's hands. Even though it all turned out well, the mayor kicked Rene out of the team for disobedience during the mission, and Dinah, who could not trust the team, left with him. Immediately after that, she decided to meet Vincent whom she apologized to and asked to be her friend.

  <p key="87caf477-1231-497a-922b-a2f40bc2f34b">
   For the next several weeks, Dinah avoided the other team members, devoting herself fully to her work and improving her relationship with Vincent. At the end of January 2018, a man visited a woman at the police station, secretly bringing in criminals as vigilante, whom he had not killed or injured. The next day they went for a walk together by the river, where they hardly kissed. The romantic moments were interrupted by the phone call to Vincent who had to leave him. Some time later, Curtis, Rene, and Dinah were summoned to Felicity's house, who, along with John, presented them with discoveries that there had been a bedbug in the bunker for several months. As a result, Cayden's team, which included Ricardo Diaz, Anatoly Knyazev and Vigilante, knew everything about the Avengers. Distraught, Drake arranged to meet Vincent by the river, where she slapped him. She couldn't understand that she had let him approach her and handcuffed him. This one, however, was cleverer and broke free, stunning the woman. As soon as she woke up, she went to Rene's house, where Curtis was already present. The woman decided that they had to form their own band because they could not sit with their hands folded. Hours later, the three were invited again by the Green Arrow team, and during the meeting, Oliver apologized for his behavior, explaining his intentions and expecting the recruits to help him in his fight against Cayden. However, they disagreed, believing that they prefer to be in Outsiders where they are appreciated. As a farewell, Holt handed John the repaired chip, then left the rest of the way. The three headed to the hideout Curtis had prepared for their team.

  <p key="5217447d-28f8-4377-9e5b-5049aaa762b4">
   The Outsiders were working in their hideout when they found out that Cayden James had mastered the city's entire infrastructure and was causing harm to innocent people from a distance. Their thoughts were interrupted by the activation of one of the T-Sphere, which began targeting the Vigilante itself. The team decided to go to the scene and check everything in order to finally be able to capture the enemy. There, however, they found nothing and returned to the base, where Curtis called Felicity to find out the location of a certain place. Immediately after that, they went to an underground link between two train routes, where the two vehicles were racing at each other. As neither Curtis nor Rene could separate the tracks, Dinah started screaming so hard at one of the trains that she finally stopped it. Upon returning to the base, Holt told his friends that the information he had had been passed on to him by Vincent Sobel himself, believing that they should trust him. After discussing the details, the heroes unanimously agreed that they should use the information from the enemy, who interrupted the conversation and sent another message using T-Sphera. According to its content, the heroes went to the indicated place, but for safety reasons, they contacted the Green Arrow team, with whom they decided to join forces for this one time. Together they held back Boots's attack on a safe zone of the city, and during the fight, the Vigilante once again proved his worth by killing Sheck in defense of Ramirez. After that, both teams returned to their hiding places, ending their cooperation. That same evening, Dinah met with Vincent, whom she forgave for her lies and with whom she began a new relationship by starting with a passionate kiss.

   The city was in fear of the recent actions of Cayden James, who continued his activities by murdering A.R.G.U.S. during one of the missions. Dinah continued her relationship with Vincent, who continued to feed the Outsiders. During one of the meetings, he was attacked by the Green Arrow team, but Wild Dog and Mister Terrific immediately stopped them from being stupid by confessing the truth about the Vigilante. Everyone immediately went to the hideout, where all inconveniences were cleared up. Queen, however, still did not trust Sobel, but needed him to hack Cayden's servers. Everything went as planned, but as soon as Vincent left the building, criminals caught him, seeing him as a traitor. As soon as the heroes found out about it, they set off to save him. Unfortunately for them, the original line-up of the team preferred to find the discovered bomb, rather than saving the ally, and thus only the Outsiders went to save Vincent. On the spot, however, they fell into a trap and were separated. Dinah crushed the ceiling as she watched the Black Siren murder Sobel on Cayden's orders before her eyes. When Curtis and Rene arrived, it was too late to rescue the ally. Returning to base, the devastated woman thanked her friends that they had gone with her to get Vincent, then headed home. After several hours of despairing on the couch, Oliver visited Drake, who did not come to apologize to her, but to confess that the man's death was not in vain and that they have the data that allows them to destroy James once and for all. Dinah didn't care, though, as she promised herself that everyone responsible for Sobel's death would die, starting with Laurel Lance.

   Dinah chased Laurel Lance in spite of Curtis and Rene trying to stop her. Eventually, the woman found her target by trying to kill her. Unfortunately for her, Quentin and the other heroes appeared and separated the women. They explained that Cayden James had received new evidence regarding his son's death and suspected that some of his former allies were behind his murder. Thus, under the threat of activating the bomb, he ordered the avengers to deliver three criminals. After a short discussion, the heroes split up again to catch Knazev and Diaz. When they were all captured, they immediately went to the assembly point. There Laurel, wanting to upset Cayden, confessed to killing his son and approached him, beginning to insult him. Knowing that the woman was lying, he slapped her, not realizing that the bomb activator was interfering with the meta-gene blocking collar. In doing so, Laurel managed to break free and make a mess, deafening Cayden and allowing the others to escape. The woman was chased by Dinah herself, with whom Lance began to fight. Drake snatched the weapon from Quentin and shot her in the stomach of her opponent, which was stunned by her scream. When she awoke, it was revealed that Cayden was the only one who had been caught and arrested. The Outsiders, however, left the bunker, believing that their joint victory still changed nothing. Oliver held Dinah out and told her she was better than this and didn't need to kill.

   Corto Maltese

When Curtis started to feel guilty that they weren't sharing information with Team Arrow, Dinah reminded Curtis that they couldn't trust that they would tell them the whole story. A conversation then broke out between Dinah and Curtis about her vendetta against Black Siren. Dinah then got a text from Reimsdyk to meet her at City Hall. The two entered Oliver's office and Reimsdyk showed both of them footage of Laurel leaving with the money. Sending Reimsdyk out, Dinah and Oliver got into a heated argument about killing Laurel, ending with both threatening each other.

   The Outsiders went back to the scene where Dinah shot Laurel to see if there were any leads to follow. Wild Dog was less than optimistic, but Mister Terrific was certain he could use his T-Spheres to pull information out of it. They were able to deduce that Laurel was dragged away and that she was severely injured from Dinah's bullet. Black Canary hinted at torturing Laurel when they find her to get her to give up the money, much too Terrific's horror. Wild Dog found tire tracks, and the three investigated, with Black Canary leaving behind a footprint.

   headquarters

When Arrow reminded them that Rene broke their trust, Dinah brought up Oliver's blindness when it comes to Laurel. The argument turned physical when Green Arrow held Rene at arrow point and Spartan and Felicity searched the lair for Laurel, who was nowhere to be found. They left with Dinah yelling at them that if they see them again, it wouldn't be on good terms.

   After the other team left, Rene revealed he planted a bug on Green Arrow so they could listen in i they got a lead on Laurel. They learned that Quentin had her the entire time and to their horror, Oliver was willing to get her out of the city in exchange for the money. Using the bug as a tracker, they followed Team Arrow, only for them to ditch the bug, leaving them with nothing. Terrific suggested using the chip in Spartan's arm to find them, but it will physically hurt him. Black Canary and Wild Dog agreed to do it. On the way to their position, Canary reminded them that they can't pull punches, even though the people they're fighting were once their friends.

   The Outsiders arrived at the cabin and Spartan tried to talk them down, to no avail. Canary used her scream on Team Arrow and the fight began. Canary went toe to toe with Spartan and knocked him down. She then went after Lance and Laurel. Catching up to the two, Canary knocked Quentin to the ground and calmly walked towards the defenseless Laurel. Canary grabbed Laurel's head and intended to kill her in the same manner that she killed Vincent. Terrific then showed up and was able to talk her out of murdering Laurel. Laurel, however, managed to escape using her scream on Canary and Terrific. Before they could pursue, Team Arrow arrived and Green Arrow planted a power dampening collar on Canary. Just when the fighting was to continue, Wild Dog arrived with severe injuries. Canary and Terrific left to get Wild Dog to the hospital.

Dr. Schwartz soon informed them of Rene's condition and that they would have to transfer him to a hospital outside of Star City to get the proper care that he requires. When Diggle and Felicity showed up with the intent to see if Rene was alright, Dinah and Curtis rejected them.

   Kimberly Hill

Outside Laurel's room, she watched her interaction with Quentin before questioning Dr. Schwartz about the night Laurel was killed. Quentin walked up to her and asked her to give him a chance to reform her. Noticing that Laurel was taking to long changing, Dinah and Quentin went into her room, only to find her gone.

Oliver walked up and asked both of them to follow him to the interrogation room. Once in, Oliver had Dinah turn the cameras off. After they were turned off Oliver revealed that Cayden James was murdered in this interrogation room by Diaz and members of the SCPD covered it up. With the larger threat of Diaz's corruption, Oliver asked Dinah to put her vendetta on hold until they figured out who in the SCPD they can trust, and urged her and Quentin to work together to find out, because of their belief in the badge. Quentin suggested working out of his
   apartment

   In the following days, Dinah and Curtis continued their investigation on who was in Diaz's pocket. At Rene's apartment, the two found Officer
   J. Hester

   Nick Anastas

   Zoe Ramirez

Dinah texted Curtis to investigate Captain Hill. Later that night the two broke into the SCPD evidence locker to steal that piece of drug evidence. While Curtis distracted Anastas, Dinah found the evidence she was looking for.

   Back at the Outsiders's headquarters, Dinah added Hill's picture to the murder board filled with all of the cops on Diaz's payroll. After Curtis was finishing running the drug to see if it matched the ones Diaz pushes, it was revealed to be vertigo. This made Dinah believe that Hill wasn't on Diaz's take, despite her confidence that she was. The next day, however, Dinah learned that all vertigo related cases were kicked because of Hill. This led Dinah and Curtis to know that Hill is on Diaz's take and that he is pushing vertigo.

Oliver and Quentin arrived in time to assure Hill that they authorized it given the stakes. They also informed her that they called in District attorney
   Sam Armand
   to expedite the charges. Hill agreed and walked off. Now alone, Oliver thanked Dinah for letting he and Diggle out. Dinah told Oliver it was only because Curtis was watching Zoe and Rene was in the hospital. The latter in which Oliver caused. A brief disagreement broke out between Dinah and Oliver before Quentin broke it up. Dinah told Oliver Anatoly was in the interrogation room and would buy him a few minutes. Unfortunately, when Armand arrived, he refused to prosecute Anatoly because of technicalities. Dinah, Oliver, and Quentin then figured that Diaz also had Armand on his payroll.

   After Hurst's murder, because he was part of Anatoly's arresters, Dinah had the other officers hidden at a secure hideout, while feeling guilty for roping them in her fight against Diaz. Curtis assured her it wasn't her fault and that fighting Diaz may cause casualties. Dinah told Curtis that she'll make sure there won't be any more casualties. Curtis volunteered to assist, to which Dinah agreed to while making cracks about his relationship with Anastas. While at the hideout, Curtis tells Dinah that Anastas hates vigilantes. Dinah gave Curtis advice on how to handle it before the proximity alarm went off. It was revealed that Brock had turned on them and shot Curtis. Dinah killed Brock in defense.

Unfortunately, Anastas came with the news that she, he, and all the cops that weren't on Diaz's payroll were fired by Hill before she cleared out her desk. With this latest development, Dinah decided to leave Curtis and Anastas alone to talk.

   After Oliver was drugged via vertigo by
   Kullens
   , a councilman on Diaz's payroll, a few hours before his meeting with the Council regarding his probable impeachment due to the accusation of Armand and Hill, he briefly hallucinated Dinah, Curtis and Rene, as Black Canary, Mr. Terrific and Wild Dog, in a hospital, questioning why he didn't come to see Rene in the hospital if his conscience was clean. Oliver claimed that it was because all of them didn't want anything to do with him, which the hallucinations didn't agree with. Having enough, Oliver left the hospital hallucination.

   When Rene was returning home after over a month in the hospital, Dinah, Curtis, and Zoe threw him a welcome home party. As Zoe went to get her father a slice of red velvet cake, the three talked about how they were going to take down Diaz. Unfortunately, with Diaz controlling the SCPD and other city officials, he's been able to avoid their usual tracking methods. Dinah, however, remained confident that with their team back to full strength, they'll be able to stop Diaz.
  </p>
  <p key="4dcddea0-bde2-434a-85b2-7343b340c0a6">
   Taking Rene back to their lair, Dinah and Curtis caught him up on past events; that Oliver has gone solo after Diggle left to join A.R.G.U.S. and fired Felicity. Getting back on topic of stopping Diaz, the three put their heads together on how to accomplish that. When Curtis thought about going after his money, Dinah suggested that with Diaz no longer able to push vertigo thanks to Oliver and Diggle, he'll go to his old group, the
   Scorpions
   as his new suppliers.
  </p>
  <p key="a23dcbee-a2dd-4f85-9210-ea88d72b23e9">
   At the Scorpions base, the three learned when their next meeting is. The Outsiders snuck in and found that the Scorpions weren't shipping drugs, but M4s. They were soon joined by a third party who were taking out the Scorpions. Realizing they were outnumbered, the three opted to retreat. Heading for the backdoor, Black Canary saved Wild Dog from being shot by a Scorpion member. Unfortunately, they were soon cornered with no exit. They were soon saved by the timely arrival of Diggle and got them out of there.
  </p>
  <p key="938114ff-bb8b-472e-a35f-08f056f9b9d1">
   Regrouping back at the Outsiders base, Diggle informed the team that the Quadrant were the ones attacking the Scorpions. Dinah recalled hearing about them when she was still an undercover cop at the CCPD. After Diggle and the Outsiders made amends for everything that went down between the two teams, they got to work. Dinah brought up that it wasn't a coincidence that the Quadrant showed up just as Diaz took control of Star City and they agreed that Diaz is in league with the criminal organization. The newly appointed Mayor Lance walked in and told everyone that Diaz visited him and wanted him to sign over a piece of property to him. Being informed of the Quadrant, Quentin informed the group that Diaz was wearing a
   Quadrant ring
   , which made them all realize that Diaz wasn't working with the Quadrant, but had in fact joined the Quadrant. With this new information, the team figured Diaz was to use the city property to harbor the foreign weaponry the Quadrant was bringing in.
  </p>
  <p key="a713c01d-c663-42b5-85e2-5286738c2a97">
   After Diggle and Rene returned from surveillance, the team learned that Diaz and the Quadrant were actually using that building as way to transport the weaponry. Aiming to stop them, Dinah and Curtis were surprised to hear that Rene was sitting out of this mission. Agreeing to his reasons, Dinah and Curtis left with Diggle and A.R.G.U.S. to stop the shipments. The plan was to have Mister Terrific tag each shipment so the A.R.G.U.S. drone could take them out. As Terrific was tagging a truck, Canary saved him from a Quadrant member by screaming him away. Thanks to their combined efforts, the Outsiders and A.R.G.U.S. were able to destroy the weapons shipment.
  </p>
  <p key="86fdd85b-9fac-4fb7-a655-20615bb2f923">
   Dinah, Curtis and Diggle celebrated back at the lair, reminiscing on the good old days when the team was unified. The two then asked Diggle if he wanted to join their team, but Diggle generously declined and reminded them that they'd be still down a teammate before heading back to A.R.G.U.S. After Rene returned to the team, the three watched the news in despair, as Oliver's trial was moved to the following week and his bail revoked.
  </p>
  <p key="bf41bdc9-77a1-4a21-b99a-51e9894421d5">
   On the day of Oliver's trial, Dinah and Rene were subpoenaed to testify. Rene tried to do a mock trial with Dinah in preparation for the trial, but Dinah refused. Dinah told Rene that she would be pleading the fifth amendment, but Rene disagreed and said they had to be convincing. Seeing Rene's determination to keep Oliver out of prison, Dinah questioned why Rene was like this after everything. Rene still believed Oliver was jerk, but didn't forget that he was in this position because he chose to testify against him. Dinah admitted that Rene was right and agreed with him and Curtis that despite their fallout with Oliver, they didn't want him to end up in prison.
  </p>
  <p key="cd6d0cef-c55b-4a79-93d2-0b26c9017f1b">
   Dinah, Curtis, and Rene arrived at the courthouse and noticed Diggle didn't show up. They were then approached by Felicity who thanked them for being here. The three took their seats as the trial began. The prosecution,
   Alexa Van Owen
   , called Diggle to the stand and Dinah and the others were disappointed that Diggle still hadn't shown up. After Van Owen was finished with Dr. Schwartz, Diggle finally showed up and after he was finished, Van Owen called Dinah to the stand. Owen questioned if Dinah would admit knowing Oliver was Green Arrow, and she assured she would've. Van Owen then brought up Sean Sonus and after further questioning, Dinah pleaded the fifth, much to the other's dismay.
  </p>
  <p key="147670f7-cdd5-40e0-b4b1-20db3bdb9072">
   When the jury took a recess, Dinah apologized for pleading the fifth. But Rene assured her that he'll fix this and told them that he wouldn't be screwing Oliver again. Diggle then called them back in. As Van Owen began questioning Rene, they were all horrified when Diaz walked in with Zoe. They watched in despair as Rene was forced to admit that Oliver was the Green Arrow and that he was part of his team. Afterwards, Dinah and Diggle ambushed Diaz outside the courthouse and didn't care if the people knew the truth about them if it meant taking Diaz down. Unfortunately, Diaz's crooked cops arrived and Dinah and Diggle were forced to let Diaz go with Diaz calling Dinah "baby".
  </p>
  <p key="ace68c66-6f13-4cd7-ab1c-f307e5c36938">
   Returning to the courtroom, after both Felicity and Oliver were called up, Dinah and the others were in shock as
   <a href="Tommy Merlyn.html" key="02b94b91-b0ca-4309-b800-42d679f58df5" title="Tommy Merlyn">
    Tommy Merlyn
   </a>
   busted into the courtroom as the Green Arrow. Merlyn was taken into custody and the jury took a brief intermission. It was revealed to have been a plan orchestrated by Oliver and Diggle to have Christopher Chance disguise himself as the Green Arrow to fool the jury. Unfortunately, Diaz sent Laurel in to confirm that Oliver was the Green Arrow, not Tommy Merlyn. However, much to everyone's shock, Laurel betrayed Diaz and told Van Owen that Tommy was indeed the Green Arrow. As the jury reached their verdict, Dinah and Curtis wondered if Diaz had gotten to them as well. The jury found Oliver guilty, but Judge
   C. McGarvey
   pronounced Oliver innocent as there was too much reasonable doubt. It turns out that Diggle and Rene had knocked the real judge out and Chance took his place.
  </p>
  <p key="3ece6221-49fc-4363-b0eb-324be599edc4">
   After Oliver was cleared of all charges Black Canary went out to blow off steam. She encountered a thug who worked for Diaz and beat him for answers. Once she was done beating the man, she realized he was just the bait as more of Diaz's men cornered her. It turns out that with Diaz's original plan in shambles, he moved on to Plan B to kill Oliver and everyone he cared about. As they prepared to execute Canary, she used her sonic scream on the wall in front of her to bounce the sound waves back onto the thugs. She then grabbed her bo staff and head back to the Outsiders lair.
  </p>
  <p key="c09d5607-b494-4774-860b-a033fa0e3a24">
   Allowing Team Arrow to hideout at their lair since the bunker was not secure, Dinah questioned why Diaz waited to move on all of them. Oliver postulated that since his original plan failed, he moved onto his backup plan. Felicity pulled up surveillance of the bunker to see Diaz's goons destroying it. Seeing this, Dinah cursed Diaz. As Diggle and Lyla arrived, the team watched helplessly as Diaz's men torched the bunker. Rene suggested they grab a couple of the thugs, but Dinah recommended they be patient. Oliver agreed, to which Dinah appreciated. They were informed by Lyla that A.R.G.U.S. wouldn't be any help taking down Diaz. Curtis then arrived and told everyone that Nick was stable after being shot be one of Diaz's men. As Dinah and the others discussed how to fight back, Oliver reminded them they have to think things through and suggested that Anatoly could help them after reaching an understanding with him. Oliver then asked them all to trust him and stand down until he gets Anatoly's information. They agreed.
  </p>
  <p key="047a1bb5-f081-475a-86c8-ff30febe3088">
   Anatoly's intel paid off as he informed Oliver Diaz would be heading to the SCPD within an hour. Black Canary and the others ambushed Diaz while he was on root. While Canary was fighting Diaz's men, Mister Terrific went after the crime on foot. Canary called out to him not to pursue, but he didn't listen. This resulted in Terrific getting stabbed by Diaz and the vigilantes forced to escape as reinforcements had arrived. Regrouping back at the lair, Dinah informed everyone that Curtis is fine and resting with Nick. Oliver informed everyone that Diaz went for a hard drive after stabbing Curtis, and the team speculated that whatever was on it must be important to Diaz. They agreed to have Lyla walk into the SCPD to scan the drive.
  </p>
  <p key="105de621-28f1-4553-ae55-ba7079f5b72d">
   They were able to scan the drive and it revealed it had a list of everyone on Diaz's payroll. Felicity was confident that they could decrypt it and free the city. While the team waited, Curtis came back to try and help. Dinah was able to get him to rest with Nick after reminding him what her vendetta against Laurel did to her. Diaz and his army then attacked the lair and started filling it with tricelic gas. While everyone evacuated, Oliver and Felicity stayed to ensure the encryption was complete. Dinah covered their escape using her cry. The team managed to escape, but Oliver and Felicity were nowhere to be found. The building then exploded as the married couple made it out. The team made it back to A.R.G.U.S. headquarters, where Dinah gave her condolences to Lyla for the loss of her men. They stood in despair as Lyla confirmed Diaz wasn't in the rubble of their lair.

   Making a deal with the FBI, Team Arrow stormed both the SCPD and Diaz's base. Black Canary used her sonic scream on Officer
   P. Parks
   and fought alongside Green Arrow, Mister Terrific, and the FBI agents in taking back the police station. When questioning those there, they were unable to get an location on Diaz. Diggle, Wild Dog, and
   Samanda Watson
   secured Diaz's base but found he wasn't there. The groups regrouped at the police station to figure out their next move. There, Oliver told the team that they all have immunity. Dinah then told Watson about Diaz's list of corrupt officials.

  <p key="517fc643-df13-420e-896a-1594a9d8e856">
   Later, Anatoly came in with address for Diaz. He also informed them that Diaz had recruited the
   Longbow Hunters

To their horror, it was revealed to be trap and Wild Dog was stuck in a room filled with explosives. When Felicity urged the others to leave the area, Canary at first refused to leave Wild Dog, but ultimately agreed. Wild Dog and Watson managed to escape before the warehouse blew and Canary asked him if he was alright.
  </p>
  <p key="939de877-a730-4543-9f1b-ff64cbefc4e5">
   Back at the SCPD, the team was informed by Lance that Diaz had Black Siren and was blackmailing him to get the FBI out of Star City in exchange for her life. Watson then had the idea to use this to locate Diaz. Canary stood with the other vigilantes and the FBI, listening to Lance and Diaz's conversation and were disappointed that Lance blew the opp and went with Diaz to save Laurel. Arriving back at the SCPD, Dinah questioned Lance's judgement, but was left amazed when she and the others realized Lance intended to have Felicity track him through his pacemaker. Getting Diaz's location, Oliver took the time to talk to Dinah about rescuing Laurel. He apologized for not taking her feelings towards losing Vincent more seriously. Dinah also apologized for giving him a hard time and admitted that she respected him greatly for what's he's put together. The two shook hands and made peace.

   Storming Diaz's base, Black Canary found Laurel cradling a bleeding out Quentin and destroyed her power dampening collar. While Laurel was surprised, Canary insisted they need to get Quentin to the hospital. Working together, the two meta-humans combined their sonic screams to take out Diaz's men. Black Canary and Laurel handed him off to two FBI agents. However, despite getting Diaz's list and taking down his men, Dragon managed to avoid capture and escape.

   Getting Quentin to the hospital, the team waited to hear about his condition. When Watson arrived with other federal agents, Dinah and the others were horrified to find out Oliver's deal to give them all immunity didn't apply to him. Dinah tried to fight it by reminding her that the judge dismissed his case, only for her to rebut and inform her that it was federal. As Lance's younger daughter,

   Sometime after Ricardo Diaz's downfall and Oliver's conviction, Dinah was reinstated and became the captain of the SCPD. She ensured that Officer Nick Anastas was reinstated as well. Five months after she was appointed as captain,
   Jason Stent
   , a notorious arms dealer who paid people off to keep his record clean, wound up on the SCPD's doorstep. After Anastas got him settled in the interrogation room, Dinah entered and started questioning him. Stent told the captain that the reason he was outside the SCPD was that an

  <p key="0482bd81-22a1-46d9-aeba-54c0480c68e2">
   After Rene was saved by the Green Arrow from a weapons dealer, Dinah had him give his statement. In her office, she was watching Laurel, who had since become the new district attorney, tell the press that the new Green Arrow wasn't Oliver and that anyone who commits vigilantism will be prosecuted. Rene came into her office as she turned off her computer and found Laurel was "full of crap". Rene tried to convince Dinah to help the new Green Arrow, but she refused since the FBI was still keeping their eyes on them. Rene reminded Dinah that Oliver wanted the team to carry on his mission and that the new Green Arrow was doing it for them. Dinah still believed that the vigilante wasn't helping, but making it worse. Deciding to move on, Rene asked Dinah how her investigation was going. Dinah was having a hard time trying to find a connection between Stent and the arm's dealer, so Rene suggested going to Curtis, who had since become the head of Research &amp; Development for A.R.G.U.S., for assistance.
  </p>
  <p key="d0c8090e-db00-4840-802a-15c92e98b3c2">
   At A.R.G.U.S. headquarters, while Curtis was finding information, Dinah thanked Diggle since he was on a leach burning resources to go after Diaz. Diggle told Dinah and Rene of Oliver status in prison before Curtis called them over. Curtis revealed that the connection between the Green Arrow's victims was that Stent had an online weapons market and that the vigilante was trying to shutdown his network. Curtis told Dinah that Stent was selling his weaponry in an hour and will inform her where it's happening. Curtis then pulled up a sketch of the vigilante and asked everyone who they thought it was. Dinah was confident his identity won't be a secret for much longer.
  </p>
  <p key="3ebb70d8-c3b3-4b6e-9bdb-af41680d386f">
   Dinah had her officers get ready for as soon as Curtis supplies the location. While getting ready, Rene entered her office and once again pleaded to Dinah not to arrest the new vigilante. Rene tried to defend the vigilante by saying he didn't let him die, but Dinah pointed out that he just probably wasn't his target. Curtis then texted Dinah the location and before leaving with the strike team, Rene told her that arresting the vigilante would be a mistake. But Dinah believed it was her doing her job.
  </p>
  <p key="ec96290c-1782-4fbe-939e-af58b8427a1f">
   Arriving at the location of the buy, Dinah ordered her men to wait, as she believed the Green Arrow would show up. Dinah proved to be correct, as the vigilante arrived and took down the deal. As the Green Arrow prepared to murder Stent, Dinah and her men busted in and surrounded the archer. Dinah demanded that vigilante lower his bow. However, Dinah and the officers were blinded when mini explosives went off, allowing the Green Arrow to escape. Dinah ordered the officers to establish a perimeter and to her frustration, saw Wild Dog in the distance.

   The next day, Dinah visited Rene's gym asked if he knew anything about business's in the Glades getting the number of money that went missing during weapons deal; he denied. Dinah was upset with Rene as she was trying to restore the faith of the police department after Diaz corrupted it. She then warned him not to do what he did again. or else she will arrest him. Before leaving, Dinah told Rene to think of Zoe and what it would mean if he got locked up.

  <p key="bc4b42ec-0c52-4bce-b193-cdeacba96655">
   The team later met up at Diggle's apartment to celebrate Felicity's return after she escaped Diaz's attack on her and William when she was in the witness protection program. But now knowing Diaz's vendetta is personal, Dinah had Laurel placed on protection detail since Diaz would want her dead fore her betrayal. Felicity then revealed that she created an algorithm that thinks only about Diaz and keeps track on all of his associates to figure out his next move. Dinah assured Felicity that she didn't have to do this alone and got annoyed when Rene suggested calling the new Green Arrow for assistance in taking down Diaz. The team then toasted to bringing Diaz down for good. Diggle later informed Dinah that the Longbow Hunters were active and working with Diaz.

  <p key="9a9feb86-50f7-4c36-8f2b-686b8acc158b">
   After Laurel ditched her protection detail by secretly sabotaging them with her sonic scream to cause nausea and dizziness in order to distract them and escape Dinah confronted her the next morning in her office. She informed her that the Longbow Hunters were in town and she needs protection as Diaz has already killed Quentin who everybody thought was her actual father. After Dinah referred to that as a joke, Laurel told her that, regardless of what she believed, she actually loved Quentin, however she doesn't want the Department's protection. Dinah then decided to watch over Laurel by herself sitting in her office and starting to read a magazine. So an annoyed Laurel asked her to make herself useful and bring her coffee, which Dinah denies. She eventually brings her coffee spite of her frustration, only to find Laurel gone as she returned to the office.

   In the evening, Dinah tracked Laurel down to an abandoned facility bought by Diaz after he joined the Quadrant in order to turn it into his "castle". The DA revealed that she thought that Diaz was hiding inside it but, as Dinah tells her she intended to call her men, Laurel stopped her claiming that that was her fight and she intended to kill Diaz to get revenge for Quentin's death. Dinah told Laurel she hasn't changed at all and is still the same lying murderer that killed Vincent, prompting Laurel to sadly responded she's not that person anymore. Despite Dinah's better judgement, she followed Laurel into the facility. The two split up and after a while, Dinah found Laurel facing
   a member
   of the Longbow Hunters armed with a device that neutralized the sounds. They managed to defeat (although not capture) the Longbow Hunter only by working together and combining their sonic screams. After the hunter escaped, the two were left wondering how she was able to silence the room.

   The next day, while Dinah was talking to one of her officers, Laurel came into her office to thank her and announce that she will not sabotage or complain (mostly) anymore about the police guards placed on her protection, which Dinah appreciated. Laurel then opened up to Dinah, telling her that she had forgotten how it was having someone who cared about her and that losing Quentin was the worse thing to happen to her in a long time, so she understood how Dinah had felt about losing Vincent and that, despite that she doesn't expect her forgiveness she's really deeply sorry for killing him and hoped that one day Dinah could believe she's actually changed before leaving. After Laurel left, Dinah began to tear up.

   After learning that Diaz and the Longbow Hunters would be attacking the

Rene and Felicity told them their plan to trap Diaz at the CDC while he is stealing chemical compounds. Dinah, however, opted to send in a task force to surround the building and capture Diaz when he showed up, but Rene reminded her that if Diaz realizes the police are involve he'll flee. Dinah reluctantly agreed to their plan with Watson's aid.

   Disguised as an FBI agent, Dinah and the others entered the CDC building.

Diaz and the Longbow Hunters, minus the Silencer, entered the containment room without a problem. Felicity informed Dinah that the Silencer was aiding them in the mechanical room in the Northeast corridor. She ran off to intercept.

   Arriving at the mechanical room, Dinah caught on that the Silencer had activated her device and that everything had been muted. Dinah and the Silencer then got into a brawl with neither side backing down. But just when the Silencer overpowered Dinah and was about to finish her off, Rene arrived and saved her. Rene checked on Dinah, who assured him she was fine and that he needs to go after the hunter. Dinah was able to recover, but Diaz and the Longbow Hunters slipped through the grasps. The FBI arrived and Dinah and Felicity discussed how much trouble Watson was in for disobeying direct orders. Dinah then questioned Rene's eagerness to flee the scene and didn't seem to buy Felicity's reasoning. The two were then joined by Watson and Dinah watched as Felicity thanked Watson for trying to capture Diaz.

A fire then started and Dinah evacuated the building while Rene went to get Zoe who was still in the building. Dinah and Rene made it outside to find Zoe was saved by the Green Arrow. They looked to the top of the building to see the Green Arrow disappear into the night.

As Diggle and Curtis left for A.R.G.U.S., Dinah and Rene got into another disagreement concerning the Green Arrow with Dinah suggesting he might have had something to do with the fire. Dinah then begged Rene to trust her to find the person responsible for the fire, to which he reluctantly agreed to.

  <p key="ee369970-e97c-4ce1-a3fd-4ae79e8c9c37">
   That night, when another fire was set at the Lofts, Dinah investigated it and found Rene with the Green Arrow. Dinah ordered Rene to step aside so she could apprehend the archer, but he refused and allowed the vigilante to escape. Having warned Rene what would happen if he assisted the Green Arrow again, Dinah arrested Rene for tampering with her investigation much to his shock. Dinah then urged Rene to not say anything as she took him away.

  <p key="1b1ee988-a25e-4a13-b3bb-5d190332cafc">
   Dinah soon found Diggle visiting her office telling her that Rene called him. When Diggle questioned why Dinah arrested him, she told him that she couldn't keep making excuses for him. Diggle realized Dinah was under a lot of pressure but asked if there was any other reason she was doing things by the book. She told Diggle that everything bad happened when they lived in "the shadows". From Vincent's death to Oliver's sentence. And that she needed to be a different hero despite believing in Team Arrow. Understanding, Diggle reminded Dinah that Quentin, while doing things by the book, worked with vigilantes because the city needed them. Dinah was still unwilling to risk everything for an unknown vigilante, so Diggle gave her information on the man the archer was after;
   Jon Cortez
   , who is an arsonist with his own crew. Diggle then left Dinah to do whatever she wanted with the information.

  <p key="b5abc60b-3121-4f9c-91b7-b9fe5f7453ea">
   Deciding to give working with Rene a shot, she bailed him out. But before doing so, she told him that they'll be doing things her way, to which he agreed too. Dinah briefed Rene on Diggle's info; that Cortes has been burning down the buildings so a shell company and buy the properties at a reduce rate. The two then went to Rene's apartment to figure out who was ordering the hits. Working together, they tracked the money Cortez was getting to a real estate investor named

  </p>
  <p key="9d7e820c-5aba-4b24-8ae1-4eee5dddfa0c">
   Scouring the Palladium, Dinah tracked one of the merchs to the back and screamed him to the ground. Cortes then showed up and threw an explosive that caused Dinah to fall unconscious. Before Cortes could finish her off, Dinah came too and pinned him to the ground. She was, however, too late to stop the other merch from starting the fuse and triggering the fire. Rene and Green Arrow soon arrived and Dinah watched in awe as the Green Arrow injured himself to get the sprinkler system working. She and Rene got the injured vigilante to his feet and she told the two to get out before her officers arrived. Just as they left, the cops showed up and Dinah showed them her badge before they shot her.
  </p>
  <p key="a5836b74-b1eb-4dbd-9476-8627f3374b6f">
   Later that night, Dinah stopped by Rene's apartment to thank him and to an extension the Green Arrow for helping her take down Cortes and his crew. Just then, Zoe came in, referring to Dinah as "Aunt Dinah" and asked what she was doing at her home. Apologizing for waking her up, Dinah told her she was there to give her a present and revealed a canary pin. She then proceeded to put it on her shirt.

   A few days later, Dinah was in the middle of looking over a case at the precinct when Laurel showed up. At first Dinah thought Laurel was there to talk about the case she was working on, but was soon surprised to see Felicity at the precinct while also being friends with Laurel. They entered Dinah's office where they asked for Dinah's assistance. The women told her that Oliver had been moved to a psychological treatment center on "Level Two" in
   <a href="Slabside Maximum Security Prison.html" key="c26d83dc-a970-42a9-9c0c-7a31ec8c9a32" title="Slabside Maximum Security Prison">
    Slabside
   </a>
   under the control of Dr.
   Jarrett Parker
   , but, there were no records of Slabside having a psychological treatment center. Seeing that Oliver could be in danger, Dinah agreed to help Felicity and Laurel go through the department's hard copies to find anything on Dr. Parker.
  </p>
  <p key="19f77e35-96a3-4bb1-bdaa-dd08a9a13038">
   The three women went through the files for anything on Parker, but had a hard time since no one had been taking care of the files. Believing they could get the FBI to help, Dinah and Laurel got into a disagreement about which method was faster before Felicity broke it up and started freaking out over Oliver's condition. Dinah tried to ease Felicity's fears, to no avail. After a while of searching, Dinah and Laurel started to believe they had try a different way before Felicity found Parker's files. Dinah and Laurel were horrified when Felicity revealed that Parker's treatment was going to erase Oliver.
  </p>
  <p key="e347b553-5508-4eb3-8743-6cb6dc9b3dd6">
   Their fears were soon diminished when a "

   " delivered evidence on Parker's experiments that allowed the women team to get Oliver back to his regular cell. The three were watching the news report on their success, when Dinah suggested they use this evidence for more than shutting down "Level Two", and she and Laurel gave Felicity hope that they could get Oliver out of prison with this new evidence.

  <p key="ebe8408b-9a0c-4584-821e-0998ccfdb523">
   Responding to a break in at munition's plant in Orchid Bay, Dinah and her officers were surprised to find Diggle and his ARGUS agents, Felicity, Laurel, Rene, and a beaten Anatoly. Dinah assisted Rene in helping Anatoly out of the crate he was in. Unfortunately, before anyone could ask questions, they were alerted to a bomb and swiftly ran out before they were caught in the explosion.
  </p>
  <p key="dc56db97-c1f3-47ba-9dbb-30e395ec1718">
   The team regrouped back at ARGUS headquarters, Dinah and the others learned that Felicity and Laurel had planted a tracker on the Silencer's belt that led them to the munition's plant. When Diggle questioned Laurel's motives, Dinah defended her by bringing up her role in shutting down :Level Two". After the group revealed all their secrets, they resolved to take down Diaz together, minus Laurel. When Laurel questioned why she should be left out, Dinah tried to assure her it was just because they couldn't risk her being exposed. Laurel, however, didn't believe her and stormed off; Felicity on her trail.
  </p>
  <p key="6a2cbd24-2368-4b0a-be94-53a00ac0546e">
   Not feeling right after that, Dinah silently walked in on Laurel's case to release Oliver from Slabside. She sat down, unbeknownst to Laurel, and listened to her case to free Oliver. Dinah was moved when Laurel started slightly referring to herself when she talks about how hard it is to be a hero when no one believes in them. This convinced Dinah that Laurel has changed. She was, however, saddened when Judge Napier denied Laurel's appeal.
  </p>
  <p key="e72131ff-349a-40ff-ace0-7207b40ca0bc">
   Feeling as though Laurel might do something reckless, Dinah followed her and stopped her from threatening the judge with force in the parking lot outside the courthouse. Dinah told Laurel that she's been persuaded that the former criminal's really changed and urged her not to throw away all her hard work for a moment of rage. Though it seemed Dinah's advice didn't set, it had the effect Dinah intended.
  </p>
  <p key="bcc46513-2386-4a7f-bd5a-369d023195cf">
   Dinah was soon called back to stop Diaz from destroying Star City. She went with Felicity and Anatoly as their backup while they disarm the bombs. Learning that Diaz was on site, Dinah and Diggle went to apprehend him. Just as Dinah was to get a shot on the Dragon while he was fighting Diggle, she dodged a shield thrown at her by
   one
   of the Longbow Hunters. She then got into another fight with the Silencer, before Rene arrived to assist. Dinah shot at a chemical bin to disorient the other hunters as they closed in on them. After Rene was injured by one of the assassins, Dinah cared for him just as the new Green arrow arrived and helped them take down Diaz. Dinah and the others were blindsided, however, as a
   hunter
   covered their retreat by shooting a dart at chemicals.

  <p key="1e3e8127-c42e-4649-8b79-ad70abc9e23d">
   Dinah and the team took Diaz into custody and listened as the news praised the archer's work. In response, Dinah thought of the old days with their victory against Diaz. She then laughed at how the FBI would mad they didn't capture the crime lord and that she'll be charging Diaz with every crime he's ever committed. To celebrate, the team went out for drinks.

When Roy questioned what happened to Star City, Dinah revealed that the people in the Glades had revolted and isolated themselves from the city, while the SCPD abandoned the city and became a defense force for the people in the Glades.

     The death of her lover changed the woman so much that she decided not to return to her former life and wanted to avenge her partner at all costs, while protecting those in need along the way. The woman was in hiding and was considered missing, which allowed her to travel safely around the country and track Sean Sonus, eventually killing him. This act, however, disturbed Dinah, and she was not comfortable with it, but she was sure that there was one less killer in the streets.

    The encounter with the Green Arrow was also an event that greatly influenced Drake's life. All because of Vincent's death, she didn't have a normal life, and now, in addition to being in Team Arrow, she started working again and found friends. She began to get along extremely well, and she gained loved ones in Rene and Curtis. From the beginning of acting as vigilante in Star City, Dinah did not have a codename, believing she was not ready to be a Black Canary.

      , who deeply wounded Dinah's vocal cords while trying to slit her throat.
       Since that incident, Dinah's powers became much more limited, as trying to use the sonic scream caused her pain.
       However, on

      </b>
      Dinah is immune to her own powers or any other meta-human with similar sonic scream-based powers. However, after Stanley cut her throat and damaged her powers, it is likely that Dinah no longer has this immunity since her own scream caused her pain (although it may have been due to her still recovering from her throat injury). After Dinah's powers were restored on Earth-Prime, she regained this ability.
