   Oliver pays Laurel a visit at the courthouse. Frank is brought through the front door much to Laurel's surprise. A smoke bomb is fired into the room and Helena shows up. Quickly the room fills with cops. It was a set-up by Adam to capture Helena. We see that Helena had paid gunman in the crowd. Oliver pushes Laurel to an adjacent room, taking Frank outside. Once out there, he reveals to Quentin that Laurel is still in there.

   Quentin calls the Arrow. Unfortunately, Oliver is standing right next to him. After Quentin looks at Oliver in shock, Oliver brushes it off by "showing" Quentin that it's his mother called (though in reality, it was Quentin).

   While they're hold-up in a room, Laurel makes a grab for a bottle of booze. Laurel says the entire trial was a sham and that her sister was right that she wasn't ready to come back. Not realizing who she's talking to, Laurel tells the Canary how strong her sister is. Sara, (under the Canary disguise) convinces her not to drink the liquor. The Canary gets a message from the Arrow that they have a way out. Laurel won't leave without the rest of the hostages and wants the Canary to help her. Oliver doesn't want Sara to engage Helena, telling her "you're not a killer". Sara says, "I am what I need to be."

   This leads to a flashback to the island. Slade puts Oliver on the radio and says this is Sara's last chance. Sara tries to say Hendrick drowned, but Slade knows she's lying. Slade gives her one-hour before he'll electrocute Oliver to death. Hendrick points a gun at Sara and says he won't go back to the ship.

   Helena prepares to execute a hostage. However Sara and Laurel show up and Sara fights Helena as Laurel tries to free the hostages. Helena manages to quickly deprive Sara from her baton and uses it against her to quickly take the advantage. She then throws Sara out a window and is about to kill her before the Arrow shows up and shoots the weapon out of Helena's hand. Helena then captures Laurel. Over the phone, Helena tells Oliver she'll trade Laurel for her father.

   The Arrow and Sara meet Helena in a secret location. They have Frank and she has Laurel. Just before Helena is able to kill her father, a member of the police tactical team opens fire. This causes everybody to scatter. Helena and Sara end up in another fight. Quentin saves the Arrow from being shot by the tactical team leader. Sara beats Helena and is about to kill her, but Laurel talks her out of it. Helena walks over and finds her father has been killed, but not by her. She appears to be in shock.

   tells Laurel that Adam did not have the authorization to rehire her, and that he lost his job as ADA. Laurel responds by saying if she's not hired back she'll expose the fact one of their ADA's was behind the hostage situation. Kate is surprised (and impressed) by the fact that Laurel has resorted to blackmail to get her job back, but rehires her. Laurel then defends herself by restating what Helena had said to her before ("Once you let the darkness inside, it never comes out").

   Oliver finds Thea in tears. She says she caught Roy kissing another girl. Thea thinks he was doing it to push her away and doesn't understand why. She's upset that nobody in her life is capable of telling the truth, foremost among them being their mother.
