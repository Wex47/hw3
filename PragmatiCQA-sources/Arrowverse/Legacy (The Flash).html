   Having figured out, what the destruction of Cicada's dagger will do, Ralph stretches himself in between the dagger and the Mirror gun. The shot from the Mirror gun causes him to transform into a cubic kind of form, and this allows Cicada to escape with the dagger. Others are baffled as to why Ralph would stop them from destroying the dagger.
  </p>
  <p key="0a5cd613-04fc-41bc-a9f3-5d524c079d1e">
   Barry and Nora check the precinct to see if there are any clues about Cicada. Barry finds a small shard of wood, and seeing that the precinct has no wood around, it must have come from Cicada; maybe from where she is hiding.

   In S.T.A.R. Labs, Team Flash is back at square one. Although they stopped Cicada from using the cryo atomizer, she is still a threat. Caitlin can't figure out how to turn Ralph back either. Meanwhile, in her hideout, Cicada comes up with a new plan to destroy meta-humans: use the time sphere to travel back to the moment the particle accelerator exploded and influence it with the meta-cure, so that the blast kills all those it transforms.
  </p>
  <p key="e7fad0a5-405d-41d8-8d83-63f3938890cb">
   The wood shard is put into analysis, and everyone are still wondering, why Ralph stopped them. Sherloque then explains he solved the mystery; why does Eobard Thawne want the dagger destroyed? Because it is the very thing that keeps his meta-human powers suppressed in the future. Nora finally realizes that Thawne was using her from the beginning, that he only wants to help himself. But as long as Cicada has the dagger, no one is safe. The team finds themselves in making a hard choice: either destroy the dagger and stop Cicada, which will free Thawne, or don't destroy it and let him get what's coming to him. Caitlin tells Cisco to go see Kamilla and tell her, who he is.

   Cisco goes to Jitters, where
   Kamilla
   looks at her photos. Cisco reveals to her, that he works in S.T.A.R. Labs and how he created the meta-cure. Kamilla at first doesn't believe him, but sees he's serious. Cisco then uses his powers to demonstrate, and Kamilla realizes he is Vibe. Cisco apologizes and tries to leave, but Kamilla isn't angry; rather she understands, why Cisco didn't tell her right away. This boosts Cisco's spirit

   Nora is in the speed lab, feeling down for not seeing Thawne's true agenda. She feels responsible about everything, but Barry comes and advises her to accept her mistakes and move forward. The analysis on the wood shard is finished, and it points to the same woods, where Dwyer nearly killed Cisco. Cicada must be in there. Nora comes in and says she came up with a plan to stop both Cicada and Thawne: use Cecile's empathy and MAD 2.0 to go into young
   Grace
   's mind to convince her to take the meta-cure, and then deal with Thawne. Caitlin still hasn't figured out how to help Ralph, until Sherloque figures out that Cisco's blasts can help. Cisco blasts Ralph, and he transforms back.

   Barry, Nora, Ralph, Killer Frost and Cecile approach Cicada's cabin, and she sees the dagger glowing. She comes out to fight the heroes, but the team uses an extrapolarator to send her into Speed Prison in S.T.A.R. Labs in order to trap her, so that Nora can enter young Grace's mind unhindered. However, the prison can only hold her for a little time. Nora enters Grace's mind, and begins to convince her, how she will become a monster in the future that kills innocent people. Two

Cicada breaks free, just as young Grace decides not to become a killer and take the cure. As Nora leaves her mind, Grace's coma ends, and the cure is administered. Cicada appears, and attacks the team, knocking them all out, and the cure doesn't work. Sherloque figures out, that the shard inside Grace's head prevents the cure from working, as it is part of the dagger, so the dagger must be destroyed. Cisco sends the Mirror gun to Barry, just as Cicada is about to kill Nora. Barry shoots, and hits the dagger, and as it is destroyed, the meta-cure on Grace starts working and Cicada starts to disappear, her existence erased.

   In 2049, as the Iron Heights guards are preparing to execute Thawne, he breaks free; the dagger is no more. He kills the guards and electrocutes the warden, and then tries to flee, but time moves backwards, and Barry and Nora appear and this time all guards are saved. Thawne is impressed that Nora learned to turn back time. Barry then brings forth Thawne's plan: to have Nora aid Barry in destroying
   DeVoe's
   satellite
   , so that Cicada would be someone Team Flash could defeat (as they never caught the original Cicada,
   David Hersch
   ). Thawne uses his ring to take his Reverse-Flash suit, and speedster chase takes place, in which Thawne uses a speed mirage to knock both Barry and Nora down. As he then tries to kill them both, a breach opens and Time Sphere appears, and crashes into Thawne. The remainder of Team Flash, Iris, Cisco, Killer Frost and Ralph, come from the breach to aid them. Thawne nods to everyone (indicating that Ralph should be dead, as he died in the original timeline). Thawne strikes, but with combined effort, Team Flash defeat him, and Nora slams him, and nearly kills him by tapping into Negative Speed Force, but Barry and Iris snap her out of it. Just then, Nora starts to disappear. Thawne says this was meant to happen, as the new timeline begins to set, in which she doesn't exist. Barry, in anguish, forces Thawne to tell him, how can they save her. Thawne says she needs to get into Negative Speed Force, as it is immune to timeline changes. He then disappears, telling Flash they will see each other in the next Crisis. Barry and Nora run into Negative Speed Force, but Nora says she can't do it, despite Barry's insistence. They come back, and Barry and Iris are griefstricken, as their daughter is about to be erased from existence. They insist Nora goes into the Negative Speed Force, but she refuses, as it would make her like Thawne, and she doesn't want that to be her legacy. She hugs her parents, as she is erased.

   The team return to the present, and everyone are sad that Nora is gone. Joe says they will have to believe she'll come back. Joe's phone rings, and it says Captain Singh wants to see him, Barry and Cecile. Iris wants to be left alone, so Cisco, Caitlin and Ralph leave her, and Sherloque returns to his Earth. All that is left of Nora is her diary. Iris takes it and begins to cry.

   In CCPD, Singh reveals that Grace is to be given into custody and congratulates Joe, Barry and Cecile for protecting the city, and he reveals the mayor has offered him the position as the chief of police, and he wants Joe to be his successor as the captain. He also reveals that he knows Barry is the Flash. In S.T.A.R. Labs, Cisco is pondering, about what Thawne said about him, and he doesn't want that. He asks Caitlin to give him the meta-cure and stop being Vibe. Caitlin is saddened about it, but gives it to him. Cisco reveals he left something for Caitlin in his workshop.

   As Barry returns, he finds Iris in the Time Vault. They contemplate about their time with Nora, and see that they were good parents. Nora's diary is still intact, as the time language in it never fades. Barry discovers something else in it: a memory drive for Gideon. They plug it inside: it's a video Nora made in case something went wrong in their efforts. In it she reveals that despite that, she got the chance to become a hero and loves her parents unconditionally. As Nora speaks, a montage about each member of Team Flash is shown: Joe takes the police captain's position with Cecile at his side, Cisco walks with Kamilla, Caitlin finds Cisco's present in his workshop, Ralph is in his office and takes a new case and Sherloque is in Jitters on his Earth, as the door opens telekinetically. Barry and Iris watch Nora's video with both joy and sadness.

Thawne then remembered this years later when he ended up in prison with the dagger strapped to his chest, dampening his powers. He goes on to explain that he then knew that he had to get Nora to trust him so that a different Cicada would be created; one they could stop (since Team Flash never managed to defeat
    Cicada in the original timeline
