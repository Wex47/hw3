   . He grew up in
   the Glades
   and had a rough life, having to partake in minor criminal acts to survive. Roy racked up a record of robbery, B&amp;E, stealing a car, and several counts of petty theft.
   He was also arrested for larceny and aggravated assault.

   . When asked, Roy admitted to stealing, because his mother was addicted to
   Vertigo
   and they desperately needed the money. Thea, moved by Roy's story, decided not to press charges, feeling compassion for his situation. She later visited Roy at
   his house
   in the Glades to retrieve her purse, and the two had a brief chat.
  </p>
  <p key="aaa14826-203f-4481-b908-5ce42244a034">
   Some time later, Thea met Roy again outside of a coffee shop in the Glades, She promised him a job at

   . In spite of Thea's kindness, Roy decided not to show up, prompting Thea to go and question him. He admitted that he didn't want any charity from a rich girl, a comment which annoyed Thea greatly. As she walked off, two men approached her, but before she could be mugged, Roy stepped in and beat the men, receiving a stab wound from one of them. Thea took Roy to the hospital, where he got stitched up and had to receive an injection, which made him nervous. Thea kissed him to distract him from the injection.
  </p>
  <p key="037a0c1f-b1ed-48a5-bc67-c2876235db27">
   Afterwards, Thea and Roy began an intimate relationship.
  </p>
  <p key="e556109f-1277-4f7c-852b-4639811120f9">
   Thea visited Roy at his place in the Glades, where they began to make out. A man visited partway through and gave Roy a gun, much to the shock of Thea, causing her to storm out, despite him trying to justify himself. She later came back to apologize, but Roy was kidnapped by
   Joseph Falk
   . He was taken below
   <a href="Star City.html" key="92d5c820-5981-4732-a964-58a83de92e57" title="Star City">

   , onto a train running on the abandoned subway. While Joseph broadcast him on
   Glades Betrayed
   , Oliver, as the Hood, intervened before he could be killed. The Hood distracted Joseph as Roy untied himself, which was just in time considering a bullet was sent at him mere seconds before he'd ducked. Joseph was shot with an arrow through the stomach. Roy later reunited with Thea at her brother's club, where he reached into his pocket and pulled out an arrowhead.
  </p>
  <p key="0b64acb8-0ccc-403f-b9d2-7d43fcc085da">
   Roy stole a police radio and waited until the dispatch mentioned the vigilante. But when he arrived at The Hood's supposed location, he instead found squad cars waiting for him. After Thea bailed him out, Quentin showed Roy one of the corpses of the Hood's victims, attempting to convince him that the vigilante was just a cold-blooded killer. Roy later confessed to Thea that he wanted to find the Hood, because he felt he owed him.
  </p>
  <p key="4746aee9-aa52-4821-9b5d-311611233a9a">
   Roy and Thea staked out

   , where they ran into Thea's brother, Oliver. When told of their search for The Hood, Oliver firmly warned Roy to abandon his search. Later returning to his home, Roy rationalized that his Vertigo contacts may help them. Thea then had second thoughts on the search. Roy stated that he wanted to find the Hood so he could train him, so he could stop other family tragedies from happening. That was the last straw for Thea, who threatened to break up with him if he didn't give his search. Thus, Roy chose to end things between them.
  </p>
  <p key="a6f0332f-153f-4faf-8dc7-af49abf7a8fe">
   During the evacuations caused by the Undertaking, Thea saved Roy from being shot. Soon after, a man stopped their car to ask them to help get for some people trapped in a nearby bus. Telling Thea to escape, they kissed and Roy went to help the people stuck in the bus.

   Shortly after the destruction of the Glades, Roy spent nights patrolling the streets and fighting off criminals in the absence of the Hood. He was often arrested for obstruction by the police as a result. Roy continued working at Verdant, which was now owned and run by Thea. When Roy tried to prevent a rape one night, he was surprised by the appearance of the Canary, who knocked out all of the would-be perpetrators in a few moments.

   As Roy continued his efforts to patrol the night, he discovered that medicines being delivered to the
   Glades Memorial Hospital
   were being stolen. Angered by the discovery, he engaged in a car chase with the thieves, but had an accident due to an attack from the
   Chinese Triad
   . Roy was arrested and threatened with prosecution, but Laurel cleared the charges. Roy revealed the thefts of the medicine to the Arrow. Roy and Thea got into a fight, and Thea threatened to break up with him if he continued patrolling. When the Arrow confronted Roy and offered him the chance to be his informant in the Glades, Roy accepted.

   When Roy was asked to track down the Canary by the Hood, he discovered that the vigilante was always accompanied by a woman named
   Sin
   . Roy managed to find her, however after questioning her on the Canary, she fled causing Roy to run after her to an abandoned site where he was knocked unconscious. When he woke up, he found himself tied up and face to face with the Canary. She initially questioned him but released him. Afterwards, Roy received a text from Thea stating that Laurel had been kidnapped.

   Roy later attended a "guns for cash" charity drive sponsored by Oliver, though he didn't want the money. Thea questioned him about the guns, but he claimed it was an old part of his life. Sin appeared, prompting Roy to introduce hi her to Thea. Suddenly, "

   " arrived and began shooting at everyone. Roy saved Thea from an attack, before tending to Sin, who had been shot. He left for the hospital while Sin was being treated. When Sin woke up, she promised to keep his alliance with the Arrow a secret. However, she called him a moron, which Thea (who'd just walked in) agreed with. Despite her disdain of Thea, Sin admitted to Roy that she'd begun to warm up to her.

   Roy placed his red flechette in order to call for the Arrow. Once he'd arrived, he helped to intercept an exchange of counterfeit plates. Despite being told to remain behind, Roy ran in behind the Arrow, tackling one of the fleeing criminals right as the police arrived. Detective Lance began processing his arrest, but soon let him go when he realized that he'd been working with the Arrow, just like the detective. Infuriated by his arrest, Thea decided to break it off with Roy. Sometime later, Roy went to meet

Angered, Roy told the Arrow that he wouldn't be his informant anymore and that he and his friends were going to look into it. The Arrow shot Roy in the leg to slow him down as he was following the same trail (albeit from a different perspective and knew that Roy couldn't fight the robber associated with the drug, as well as the fact that "his friends" likely included Thea).

   Roy struggled with keeping his new found powers a secret from Thea, creating a rift between them. Instead, he decided to tell Sin, explaining he would "tell Thea when he got it under control". Deciding to put his powers to good use, Roy and Sin plotted to take down

   , a rich lawyer who secretly murdered prostitutes, with Sin as the bait. Before Sin could become the next victim, Roy ripped the car door off its hinges and beat Richard to a pulp, putting him in the hospital, and struck Sin in a rage when she pleaded him to stop. Roy came to regret this and at the hospital, away from prying eyes, he broke down in tears. Not long after, Roy was contacted by the Arrow, who promised to train him and hone his abilities.

The Arrow and Roy go to prevent Bronze Tiger from stealing a prototype earthquake generator from Merlyn Mansion. Roy saved The Arrow from Bronze Tiger, but repeatedly began punching the latter.

Felicity later told Roy said that he may have had bits of Mirakuru left in his blood at the time of Sara's death. Believing he is the murderer, Roy revealed to the rest of the team and Laurel. He later helped Oliver and Diggle to stop
   Isaac Stanzler
   , who claimed that Oliver saw Roy as just "another weapon in his arsenal". After knocking Stanzler out, Roy asked Oliver to never abandon him, and Oliver assures that he won't. At the Arrowcave, Roy told Oliver what Isaac said and Oliver suggested Roy use the moniker Arsenal. Using meditation, Oliver then coached Roy into remembering what really happened in his nightmares. Roy learned that he didn't kill Sara, but murdered a cop while he on his Mirakuru-induced rampage.

   Still haunted by his murder of the police officer, Roy assisted Oliver tracking down
   Carrie Cutter/Cupid
   . Felicity found out she was keeping a mob boss hostage in
   Sherwood Florist
   . Oliver and Roy broke into the store, where Oliver told Roy to look for the mob boss as he would take care of Carrie. After splitting up, Roy was suddenly startled as an arrow landed close to him. He turned around and was confronted by a smiling Carrie Cutter. Despite his weaponry and training, Carrie quickly knocked out Roy before he could even warn Oliver. She took him hostage too and used his earpiece to taunt Oliver. After recovering, Roy felt humiliated by his defeat. At Verdant's grand re-opening, Carrie walked past Roy, but he didn't notice her. After Oliver barely survived his battle with Carrie, he went to the Arrowcave and knocked some items over, frustrated over his situation with Felicity. Roy heard the commotion asked if he was okay, to which Oliver admitted that he wasn't. To help lift their spirits, Oliver and Roy had dinner with Diggle, Lyla, and

When Roy and Diggle returned to the Arrowcave, Roy voiced his belief that Oliver might be dead, for which he was immediately shunned for. Later though, Malcolm broke into the Arrowcave and brought the sword down that killed Oliver. After finding out that the dealers they were tracking worked for

When Brick kidnapped the city's Aldermen, Roy was forced to accept Laurel's help in rescuing them. Roy battled Brick while Laurel rescued the hostages. When Roy shot an arrow at Brick as revenge, Brick killed one of the Aldermen. Later, Roy and Diggle shared a drink to remember Oliver and wondered if they might not be able to protect the city without him. Roy immediately changed his mind when Felicity rejoined Team Arrow and they were able to find where Brick was keeping the Aldermen. Roy and Laurel were able to rescue them, but this proved pointless when Brick took over Glades.

   Roy and Laurel tried fighting back against Brick's men in the Glades but made little difference.

Roy and the rest of the team found out that Brick killed Malcolm's wife,
   Rebecca
   . When Felicity found Brick's location Roy and Laurel went to the Glades' police precinct and engaged Brick. When Brick fought them, they were saved by Malcolm at the last second. Back at the Arrowcave, Malcolm offers to help them take down Brick. Roy was for the idea and even more convinced when he found out that Malcolm saved Thea during the night of the Siege. Roy later rallied Sin and the Glades together to fight Brick. In the end, they were able to take him down and free the Glades. Oliver returned and thanked the people of the Glades for fighting back, much to Roy and everyone else's awe and joy.
