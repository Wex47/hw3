   When Harrison Wells was 10 years old, he solved

   Albert Einstein
   's riddle.

  <p key="3a1f77a3-11e8-4491-b601-9ecc71bf59d0">
   In his adulthood, Harrison met a
   woman
   , whom he later fell in love with and married. Harrison initially didn't want children, but his wife later convinced him to change his mind, and they had a daughter together,
   Jesse Chambers Wells
   ,
   whom Harrison would affectionately call "Jesse Quick" due to her genius intellect.
  </p>
  <p key="894127e2-1163-4dfc-88f4-3d7cf7a914af">
   When Jesse was four, Harrison took his daughter to a planetarium, which was the first time they went out together. There, Jesse got lost in the
   Mars
   exhibit, prompting Harrison to have the entire planetarium shut down to find her. It was at that moment he felt something never felt before: rage. Harrison swore to himself that he would hurt whoever had taken Jesse, realizing he would do anything to get his daughter back if something happened to her.

  <p key="7a012bad-f1a9-4724-916c-b699b31c2b36">

   In 2014, Harrison created his

   One day, Harrison Wells happened upon a tour group of children walking through S.T.A.R. Labs and greeted them.
   He also held a press conference to unveil the
   meta-human awareness app
   in a new series of
   next gen
   gadgets, designed to alert the user of a meta-human presence specificall. During the conference, Harrison Wells was confronted by Jay Garrick, who wanted to expose his involvement in the meta-humans' creation by his particle accelerator, but Wells rebuked Garrick by encouraging him to do his job and stop Zoom. After The Flash left, Harrison continued his press conference, assuring his daughter Jesse that he was fine.
  </p>
  <p key="27ece074-facd-4fb3-a967-647f95d32565">
   After the press conference, Harrison was working in his office until he was confronted by Jesse. She asked him if what the Flash had said during the conference about his involvement in creating meta-humans was the truth. Although Harrison tried to evade his daughter's question, Jesse saw this as confirmation, criticizing her father for his actions, lies, and distrust of Jay Garrick. Harrison replied that with the work being done at S.T.A.R. Labs, he had been trying to unlock the mysteries of the universe, adding that if sometimes one doesn't have the key for a lock, he must kick the door open.
  </p>
  <p key="1a7879e0-05e8-44a2-8a08-98f10f8a61ad">
   Later that day, Harrison was working while listening to a news report revealing
   Robert Queen
   as the
   Starling City
   vigilante, "
   The Hood
   ". Suddenly, he saw a newsreel about a meta-human attack at
   Central City College
   and that a female student had been kidnapped by Zoom. Upon seeing Jesse's broken cellphone in the wreckage on TV, Harrison was horrified, initially believing that Jesse was dead. Not knowing the fate of his daughter, Harrison dedicated himself to find stop Zoom and find out what happened to his daughter.

  <p key="bc32dbc3-dc48-4b91-a6c5-a3f4408fc6c0">
   After The Flash vanished, Harrison believed that Zoom had killed him in their last duel during the Singularity. Harrison would later discover a breach to Earth-1 after a purse was thrown through a
   interdimensional breach
   , which almost hit him. This would give him the idea to go to another world to find help against Zoom.

Getting back on topic, when Barry questioned why he was here, Harrison told them that he was here to help them defeat Zoom.

   Barry asked Harrison what he knew of the evil speedster, to which he revealed that he created Zoom and all the Earth-2 metas. After the team informed him of their progress on tracking the Earth-2 metas, Harry was less than impressed with their results and told them of Zoom's determination to be the only speedster in the
   Multiverse
   . The team was still hesitant to trust him because of Thawne, but Harrison continued to plead his case. When

   When another Earth-2 meta-human showed up,
   Dr. Light
   , Harrison gave them the information he had on her. He explained how she got her powers from his accelerator and suggested they use Light to lure Zoom out. At that moment, Jay walked in and disagreed with Harrison's plan. Harrison was surprised to see Jay, believing he was dead, and mocked how he was hiding on this Earth. The two argued about how to handle Light, before Barry broke them up and Harrison went to drink his Big Belly soda.

   Harrison then decided to do research on Thawne, listening to his favorite music. Cisco, referring to him as Harry, then came in and mocked his choice of music. Harry took note on how different and similar he and Thawne were. When Cisco mentioned the bad Thawne did, Harry requested to know what he did to him that was so bad that he can't look at him in the eyes. Cisco told him how he killed him in an alternate timeline, but Harry didn't seem to care. He then set their arrangement: they don't like each other, but they'll have to work with each other to stop Zoom. As Cisco left to check the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite, Harry checked his meta-human watch.

   After Barry confronted Dr. Light, he came back blind. Harry blamed Jay for his failure since he suggested talking to her instead of taking her in. When Jay tried to defend himself by saying Light caught Barry off guard, Harry questioned how she could do that to a speedster, only to find out that Light is ex's doppelgänger,

   Iris West
   . Seeing that Thawne did something to offend Iris as well, Cisco revealed that her
   fiancée
   died because of him. Harry simply shrugged and got back to work.

   They're plan to capture Light took a turn when she accidentally killed
   Eric Larkin
   as she tried to kill Linda. Harry blamed Jay for believing that someone under Zoom's influence could be reasoned with, and he claimed that Jay was the reason Barry doubted himself before pinning their entire situation on him. When Jay tried to defend himself with the argument that he had hunted Zoom for two years, Harry turned the argument back on him, saying that Zoom had in fact been hunting

   , and Jay had not been doing anything but running from the demonic speedster. He compared Barry to Jay, stating that unlike Jay, Barry could beat Zoom because he was not a coward and was willing to rush towards danger and not away from it. Fed up with Harry's remarks, Jay engaged with Harry in a physical fight that Barry had to stop.

  <p key="ced87553-763e-4aab-95d2-974bc260aa0f">
   Shortly thereafter, Barry approached Harry to suggest that he was being hard on Jay, but Harry defended his position, stating that Jay should be learning from Barry instead of the other way around. Barry mentioned that prior to learning he was the

   , Barry looked up to Earth-1 "Wells" as a role model and mentor, prompting Harry to remind Barry that he wasn't his Earth-1 counterpart and Barry needed to take his advice in order to take Zoom down. During this conversation, Barry told him that they had gotten hold of Light's mask in the confrontation at the
   Central City Picture News
   office. In order to find Dr. Light, Harry explained that all the team had to do was give Light's mask to Cisco and exposed his status as a metahuman with the ability to vibe the location of anyone just by using an object that belonged to them.

But before he did, he warned the team not to trust Harry, as he calmly sat and watch. The next morning, Harry watched as Barry, Caitlin, and Cisco celebrated as

   After Barry convinced Dr. Light to help them stop Zoom, she told them what he wanted from her; to send Barry's new emblem through a breach to confirm his death and he will collect his body afterwards. Harry stepped up and revealed he invented a serum that would dampen Zoom's speed, only if Cisco can create gun to deliver it. Caitlin remained unconvinced of this plan, but Harry assured her that the element of surprise is their advantage. Joe reluctantly agreed to it and they got to work. Before starting, Harry though about the argument he had with Jesse involving the accelerator before she was taken.
  </p>
  <p key="263d5f18-b51e-4d2b-a332-688ce8915997">
   Unfortunately, Dr. Light tricked them and escaped. Harry was furious and chewed the team out for not listening to him about sedating Light before Joe calmed him down. They started to discuss whether they're original plan was even a good one before Barry defended Harry's plan and he got back to work on the speed dampener serum. Cisco came up to him in his work shop and patted him on the back. Harry, realizing Cisco was trying to vibe him, told the engineer to just ask him and to get out. After he left Harry recounted the day Jesse was taken by Zoom.

   Convincing Earth-1 Linda to pretend to be Dr. Light, Harry, along with Team Flash, tried to train her to be Dr. Light. The training went poorly, leaving the others less confident about their plan. To ensure better odds, Harry went to toon up Cisco's gloves to make sure they'd work properly. While Harry was working, Cisco tried to make peace with him, but Harry was not interested. When it looked like Cisco was trying to vibe him again, Harry moved away. But, when Cisco knocked over some oil, he was forced to clean up, as Cisco unintentionally vibed him.

  <p key="39a7a0b8-b744-4308-af9f-65354c069653">
   That night, after Barry was able to give Linda the confidence she needed, the team put their plan into action. Harry and Joe took positions on a ledge waiting for Zoom to arrive. Linda, as Dr. Light, and Flash engaged in a "fight", where Dr. Light "killed" him and threw his emblem through a breach. After an hour with no Zoom, the team accepted that Zoom didn't take the bait. After Harry and Joe came down from their positions, Harry proceeded to wack random stuff in the dock in frustration.

  <p key="ee8f6570-bef7-4777-9597-f50fe0034083">
   Once they got back to S.T.A.R. Labs, Harry reviewed the footage of the failed mission over and over again to see what went wrong. After he stopped, his meta watch went off as Barry told everyone that Zoom had Linda. While Flash raced off the face him on the roof, Harry, Caitlin, and Cisco observed. When Caitlin commented Zoom not being human, Harry told her was once. Harry then observed Flash throw lightning at Zoom, only to witness him catch it and throw it right back at him. Realizing Flash was outmatched, Harry went outside and tried firing his serum at him, only for Zoom to catch it and inject into Flash. Zoom then warned the stunned Harry that he's next before speeding off with Flash.

   After Zoom brought an unconscious Flash back to S.T.A.R labs after defeating him in battle, Zoom told Harry that he made a mistake trying to use Barry to stop him, which a horrified Harry admitted. Zoom was then shot with the dart by Cisco, but managed to still run with his super-speed and escape, upsetting Wells. Joe slammed Harry against a wall, blaming him for what happened to Barry. Cisco told Harry that he vibed on him earlier as he worked in the office, revealing that his daughter, Jesse, was alive but being held captive by Zoom. Harry told Joe that he overestimated his ability to stop Zoom and thought he could stop Zoom on Earth-1 and he was doing whatever it takes to keep his daughter safe just as Joe would do anything to keep Barry safe.

  <p key="6a7036c6-527e-4868-8007-aa067786ba13">
   A week later, Harry decided to leave and go back to Earth-2 to fight Zoom due to his mistake of thinking he could recruit Barry to stop Zoom which led to Barry getting injured. As the group were discussing Zoom in the cortex, Harry barged requesting access to their Breach room and
   Speed cannon
   so he could go home. Joe compared Harry to Thawne because of him wanting to abandon them, to which Harry reminded him once again, that it wasn't him. While the others had no problem with Harry leaving, Caitlin urged to reconsider. Harry, however, refused, and opted to find his own way back to Earth-2.

  <p key="ede39dc6-b957-4256-8b33-5c2204bcfc4e">
   Harry then head out to think; he wore a cap to disguise himself so people wouldn't recognize him. He sat at a bar working on a way to get back home, when he was approached by Caitlin. Harry deduced that she was here without the consent of Team Flash and assured her that he'd be heading home soon. Caitlin tried to give him confidence in their ability to help him save Jesse, but Harry insisted that coming to Earth-1 was a mistake. Despite Caitlin continuing to persuade him to stay, he refused. Before Caitlin left, she mentions how Cisco and Stein never figured out how to close the Breaches, which gave Harry the idea of closing 51 Breaches, and leave the Breach at S.T.A.R. Labs to trap Zoom with.

   Harry returned to the team, only for Caitlin to be abducted by
   Grodd
   the next day. Harry was amazed at the similarities between their Earths, as he had talking Gorillas on his Earth. Harry then asked Cisco why Grodd would abduct Caitlin, but he had no answer as she was always nice to him in the past. Using Joe's idea of tracking Grodd's past movements, Harry and Cisco went to work on finding a way to track him, with Harry determined to rescue Caitlin from the mad gorilla.
  </p>
  <p key="ef3ba932-dd6f-4367-bbc1-962f5388e214">
   Harry asked Cisco how Grodd became sentient. He explained to him how the military experimented on the gorilla with drugs and the
   dark matter
   from the accelerator made him into what he is now. Harry algorithm to track Grodd's location then got an alert and the two went to tell the others. Before telling them, Harry and Cisco had the idea of Harry masquerading as Thawne in the
   Reverse-Flash suit
   to trick Grodd. When they presented this idea to Barry, he mistook him for Thawne and pinned him to the wall. Once Cisco pulled Barry off, they explained their plan to him, which he agreed to.

  <p key="089e5764-1cc0-44ed-95a7-84e502a6c8d9">
   Tracking Grodd to its last location, a bell tower,  Harry gave Cisco his best "Wells" impression to fool Grodd before he put Cisco's anti mind control earbuds in. Harry reached the top of the bell tower and greeted Grodd. He proceeded to try and talk Grodd into letting Caitlin go, but Grodd was able to see that his "father" was a doppelgänger due to Harry asking Grodd's permission to release Caitlin. Harry was injured but managed to inject Grodd with the tranquilizers that he stole and escaped with Caitlin and Cisco.

   Once back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Caitlin treated Harry to his wounds, while also thanking him for saving her; he responded that they were indeed a team. Barry and the others were also impressed by Harry's heroism. The team then got to discussing how to properly deal with Grodd once and for all. When Caitlin revealed that Grodd wants a family like him, Harry had an idea where to send him. He explained that he was able to identify a Breach to his Earth where Grodd will feel like he's home.

   There plan to bait Grodd into the Breach succeeded and the gorilla was sent to Earth-2. Afterwards, at S.T.A.R. Labs Harry volunteered to help figure out how Thawne got his suit in his
   ring
   , knowing a few things about microtechnology. Barry's father,
   Henry Allen
   , then officially introduced himself to Harry, thanking him for his assistance. When Caitlin asked about the place they sent Grodd, Harry there was a
   gorilla refuge
   on Earth-2 where gorillas who underwent lab experiments were able to roam freely. Caitlin then gave an assurance that they will help him find his daughter and stop Zoom together, giving Harry some hope.

   While Harry and Caitlin tested Barry's speed, Harry was less than impressed with his progress. When Barry asked about his speed level, Harry was blunt and said it was bad. Caitlin wondered how Zoom was so much faster then both Barry and Jay combined, so Harry gave a list of differences between the three: physiology, form, strength, etc. After Barry left to meet up with Patty, Caitlin asked what else they can do since they were out of ideas. Harry, however, had one more idea up his sleeve.

   As Harry was working, Caitlin walked up and asked what he was working on. He revealed to her his formula of Velocity 6 to help increase Barry's speed. He explained why he failed to perfect it was because he didn't have a background in biochemistry. So, Caitlin offered her his assistance in finishing it, which he accepted. The two realized that what they needed was sodium chloride to complete Velocity 6. The two then got to work.

  <p key="5da54383-e012-4e4d-bf6a-d6e9cc2bcb62">
   Harry called Jay over to test the Velocity 6, as they finished up the formula. When Jay showed up, he refused to take the "speed drug", stating that the Speed Force could not be lab-made and the drug's effects could not be predicted, and warned Caitlin not to let Barry use the serum. Ignoring Jay's warnings, Harry subsequently went out to gather the chemicals needed to synthesize Velocity 6 and brought them back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

  <p key="86b55c57-f6d7-4c1d-a1ba-5b0e53cb53fd">
   As Harry got Velocity 6 ready, a concerned Caitlin was willing to heed Jay's warning, to which Harry dismissed Jay as a coward. Just as Caitlin left the Cortex, Patty confronted Harry, accusing him of breaking into Mercury Labs. Harry attempted to approach her and explain but accidentally pointed the syringe gun in his hand towards her, causing Patty to panic and shoot him in the chest.

   After Joe dismissed Patty, Caitlin had a reluctant Jay take Velocity 6, enabling him to phase his hand through Harry's chest to retrieve the bullet.

   The team soon got a video message from Jesse, calling the Flash out. While Cisco tried to track his position, Jay noticed a reflection in his cornea. Upon a closer examination, Harry recognized the reflection as a Mr. Jiggle Wiggle teddy bear and told the team how he got one for his daughter when she was six. They were able to use this information to track Jesse to an abandoned toy factory and Barry went to confront him. It turned out to be a trap and Flash was forced to rescue Detective Spivot from an explosion.

   Harry later awaited Zoom's arrival in the Breach room. Once he came through the breach, he demanded Harry's answer. Harry requested more time, but Zoom simply told him they need more time. Zoom then threatened to kill Harry's new friends to motivate his answer. Harry begged him not to and Zoom gave him one more day to decide. Before speeding back to Earth-2, he mocked Harry by telling him he'll let Jesse know he said hello, leaving Harry devastated.

   When Flash went to confront Jesse and Martin, they learned that they had handed out over a 100 presents with bombs in them to families. If Flash lets Jesse and Martin slowly kill him, they won't harm anyone. As the two criminals tortured Flash, Harry and the others got to work on trying to track down the bombs. Harry came up with the idea to find one to send all of them away through a breach like they did Grodd. He then took one of Cisco's drones to accomplish the task.

   Harry, Cisco, and Jay tracked down one of the bombs to a house. Harry knocked on the door where a little boy answered. He demands that he gives him his presents, much to the boy's confusion. Having taken the bomb out of the present, the three planned to use magnetism to send all 100 bombs through a breach above the city using Cisco's drone.

   Having finally decided, Harry met with Zoom in an abandoned area. When Zoom arrived, Harry deduced why he was sending meta after meta from Earth-2 to fight Barry: he wanted Barry to get faster so there would be more power for him to take. Harry wanted to see his daughter, so Zoom brought Jesse from Earth-2. Having been reunited with his daughter a few seconds before Zoom to her back, Harry tearfully agreed to help Zoom steal the Flash's speed.

   The Turtle

   Cisco brought Harry, Barry, Caitlin, and Jay into the cortex where he explained the Turtle. However, it was derailed when the team misunderstood Caitlin's White Whale analogy. Harry then got the conversation back on the Turtle. Cisco explained he stumbled onto the Turtle's crimes when they were hunting the Reverse-Flash and video footage of him slowing down time to steal. Harry asked how they would find him, so Barry did some research and deduced that the Turtle steals personal items and rushed over to the CCPD when he read them recovering the Vandervoort diamonds.

Harry agreed with Barry and explained how the Turtle has the ability to transfer all the surrounding kinetic energy into himself. When Barry asked how he was still able to move, to which Harry answered as it was because his speed allowed him to change positions faster than anyone else. Harry then went o to figure out how to use the Turtle's powers against Zoom.

   The next day, the team figured out the Turtle would rob the

Two years ago the CCPD got a 911 call about a hostage situation, but when the SWAT team got there, there were no hostages. He explained that Zoom set a trap in order to show the police that they could not stop him. And he killed 14 officers but left one alive to tell the tale. The officer described blue lightning "zooming" all about as his comrades were murdered. Then after the officer told the tale, Zoom went to his house and killed him too. Cisco then volunteered to vibe to see if his daughter is still alive, but Harry assured him she was. The Turtle soon arrived, but the Flash failed once again to stop him.

Once Barry left, Harry told them they had to figure out how the Turtle drained Barry of his speed and left with Cisco to do so.

   Things took a turn for the worse when the Turtle kidnapped Patty. The team tried to track
   Russell Glosson
   , but were having no luck until Harry came up with an idea. He explained that the Turtle keeps the things he's stolen like how a serial killer would keep trophies from their victims. This allowed the team to figured out that he rented a storage space to keep all his stolen goods. Cisco couldn't find anything, but then remembered that his
   ex-wife
   used to be an archivist for antiquities at the
   Naydel Library
   . The Flash then arrived at the library and rescued Patty from the Turtle and captured him.

  <p key="4195baf9-2df9-47be-bcbe-bf49ab163970">
   After locking Turtle up in the Pipeline, the team waited for him to wake up. Once he did, they gloated how he was now there "most prized possession" and closed it up. Once everyone went home for the night, Harry got back to work. He recorded an entry in his watch and spoke as if he was talking to Jesse. He reminisced how he lost her when she was four and had the feeling of rage for the first time; that he would do anything to get her back if someone ever kidnapped her. He then killed Glosson by taking a sample of his brain to use in his research to steal Barry's speed.

   Harry and Cisco ran The Flash and helped him save the city. After a while, Jay Garrick interrupted the conversation and announced that Turtle was dead, so their plan to stop Zoom was obliterated. Upon examining the body of
   Russell Glosson
   , the former sprinter began to suspect the scientist's murder, which sparked a minor altercation. Sometime later, while talking to Ramon, Wells had the idea of ​​what triggered his visions and made an appointment with him in a few minutes in the Time Vault. As soon as Cisco got there, Harry in a Reverse-Flash suit scared the man, triggering a vision of Reverse-Flash. After informing the team about his opponent's return and confronting him for the first time, the scientist explained how it was possible that Eobard was still alive. After some time, Harrison reunited with Cisco in the lab and introduced him to improved goggles that simulate the fear receptors in the technician's brain. When the young man put them on, Wells guided the man and they learned of Reverse-Flash's future actions that they were both going to stop. However, when the enemy was caught, Ramon began to fade from the timeline, forcing the team to send the sprinter away. As Harry released the meta-human, he impressed him with his demeanor before informing Barry that this was the point where Eobard found out about most of the things in this timeline. After sending Thawne away, Cisco woke up and Harry happily went to order burgers.

   After Barry closed all the breaches with Harry's breach implosion device, he, Barry and Cisco set off for Earth-2 through the S.T.A.R. Labs breach. Upon arrival, Harry became annoyed when his companions took in the sights and panicked upon meeting lab assistant
   Henry Hewitt
   , whom the Earth-1 visitor know as an evil metahuman on their Earth. Subsequently, they learned that Zoom had escalated his reign of terror. Cisco then tried to vibe Zoom, only to discover that his goggles had been non-functional, as the two Earths vibrate on different frequencies, making it impossible for Cisco to vibe. Upon seeing Barry's
   doppelganger
   on TV, he replaced him, hoping to get
   CCPD
   's information on Zoom in hopes of finding him. Unfortunately, Barry forgot Jay's advice not to get sucked in emotionally and became involved with Iris and Joe's doppelgängers, before Joe was incidentally killed in a confrontation with Caitlin and Ronnie's doppelgängers,
   Killer Frost
   and
   Deathstorm
   . Harry scolded Barry for forgetting his objective, stating that the inhabitants of Earth-2 are not the people he knows but Barry rejected his words.

  <p key="ad5c2fbf-27e2-44e4-9e71-90b2c4c24228">
   Subsequently, Barry and Cisco try to help Iris Two track down Killer Frost and Deathstorm, but something went awry and Zoom captured Barry and started tearing Central City apart looking for Harry. After ordering S.T.A.R. Labs evacuated, Harry nearly pulled his gun on Cisco, who revealed that Zoom had killed his doppelgänger
   Reverb
   and Deathstorm, but spared him and Killer Frost and took Barry; Harry suspected that Zoom left Cisco alive for a reason.
  </p>
  <p key="ecab4c14-b04b-4384-ade8-4c71716c568a">
   They then remembered they left Barry Two locked up and free him, before Zoom attacked S.T.A.R. Labs. The trio took shelter in Harry's
   time vault
   , hiding behind a fake wall when Zoom entered. Afterwards, they explained everything to Barry Two and later Iris Two. Knowing that Barry and Jesse would most likely be in Zoom's lair, the group decide to seek out Killer Frost, as only Zoom's henchmen would know. After a brief fight, Cisco is able to convince Killer Frost to take them to Zoom's lair, Ascension Cliffs, which Harry noted is only accessible for speedsters. They get inside with Killer Frost producing an ice staircase. Though Harry is able to free Jesse, Barry's cell was lined with carbine, which he couldn't phase through because of the frequency differential. Thankfully, Barry Two is able to coax his doppelgänger into getting the courage to phase through. Unfortunately, Zoom then arrived, having been summoned by Killer Frost. Zoom declared he would everyone but Barry and Harry, starting with Jesse. But then Killer Frost had a change of heart and held off Zoom long enough for everyone to escape. Once back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Harry grimly tells Jesse that they had to leave Earth-2 forever. As the meta detectors go off, indicating Zoom was near, Barry got Cisco and Jesse through the breach, but when he got back, Zoom had Harry in his clutches, declaring he needs the two of them to get his speed. Unseen, Harry drew a speed dampening dart and asks Barry to give his love to Jesse, before stabbing Zoom with the dart, stunning him long enough for Harry and Barry to get back to Earth-1. Jay then used the breach implosion device to close the breach, but not before Zoom reached through, phasing his hand through Jay's chest and dragging him back through. This broke Caitlin's heart and Harry had to grimly tell Barry that there's no way to reopen the breach. Later, he advises Barry and Cisco not to tell anyone of their experiences on Earth-2, as it might affect the people of Earth-1, as well as the fact that those lives weren't theirs.

   Shay Lamden

   Harry later began working on an algorithm to track King Shark. Jesse offered her help, though it took a bit of convincing. Later on, Harry stood with Jesse and Cisco at the Cortex while Barry and A.R.G.U.S. set a trap for King Shark. When the trap failed, Barry challenged the man shark to a race at sea, before creating a whirlpool of electricity, trapping King Shark before stunning him with the lightning toss.

   Deciding to take a break, Jesse pleads with her father to let her go out clubbing with the team. He consented, but not before giving her his meta-detector. This later proved to be a mistake, as Jesse accidentally discovered the recording where he confesses to murdering

   After the appearance of another speedster who robbed the same club where Jesse was, incidentally framing the Flash, Harry and Caitlin are forced to reveal the existence of the Velocity serums to Barry and warn him of the fatal side effects.

   Subsequently, the new speedster, Trajectory, whom Caitlin recognized as her Mercury Labs colleague,
   Eliza Harmon

   the Pipeline

Once they had done so, Eliza injected Jesse with the serum to test if they had put a sedative in it, causing Jesse to get a seizure. Eliza then runs off, giving Cisco an opening to release Barry, who chases after her but loses her.

   After Barry and Eliza's confrontation resulted in the latter disintegrating from an overdose of Velocity 9, Barry tells the team that he witnessed Eliza's lightning turn blue before she died. Harry then realized that Zoom is dying from Velocity 9 and needs Barry's speed to cure himself. Barry notes that Jay had the same disease. Harry then turned to Cisco, knowing his vibes could verify the truth. Cisco then confessed that he had been vibing Zoom since they closed the last breach, always in proximity to Jay's helmet. Upon vibing on it, Cisco sadly confirms that Jay is Zoom.

   Harry later searched for Jesse for weeks to no avail. When he returned to S.T.A.R.

   Harry later visited Joe to ask him to try and convince Barry not to fight Zoom, but Joe stated that Barry can't be stopped when he's put his mind to something and that Harry should instead help him. Harry did just that by modifying Cisco's goggles to assist him in manipulating multi-dimensional energies. He joins Barry and Cisco at an abandoned hospital, which was a hotspot for multiversal energies. Cisco nearly opened a new breach, only to hesitate.

   Later, Harry overhears Caitlin telling Barry about "Jay's" Earth-1 doppelgänger,
   Hunter Zolomon

He explained Hunter's backstory, how his father killed his mother, resulting in Hunter being sent into the foster care system. When Harry's particle accelerator exploded, Hunter was undergoing electro-shock therapy at the time when the dark matter hit, creating Zoom. Realizing that Hunter thinks his past is a secret, Barry decided to use this information to his advantage. He prepares himself and Joe with pulse rifles.

   The trap was nearly effective, but Hunter removed the foot dampener and kidnapped Wally to force Barry to give up his speed to see Wally alive. Harry told Hunter that he would erase Hunter's smug smile before being forced to calibrate the devices he used to steal some of Barry's speed. As Barry ran on the treadmill, his speed was gradually transferred into Harry's device which Hunter then injected into himself, obtaining Barry's speed. Wally was subsequently released, but Hunter used the opportunity to try and kill a weakened Barry before he was stopped by Caitlin. Zoom then kidnapped Caitlin and took her to his base on Earth-2 (although Team Flash did not know where she was until much later), leaving Harry and the other members of Team Flash in shock.

Still reeling over Zoom's victory and success in stealing 2016 Barry's speed, Harry found the device and almost destroyed it in rage, but Barry managed to calm him down by telling Harry how he could save his daughter by locating her due to the different frequency at which individuals from Earth-2 vibrate.

Harry finally figured out the whereabouts of his daughter since Earth-2 people vibrated at a different frequency, and he used cellular dead zones to track her down. When Harry arrived at the place in which Jesse stayed, he found
   her flatmate

Having stood directly in front of the van for a reason, Grey then kidnapped the unconscious Harry and took him to the Central City Amusement Park. After awakening, Harry learned Griffin's name and situation. Griffin was a meta-human created from Thawne's particle accelerator and wrongly thought Harry was the "

Griffin claimed that his powers were a curse and showed Harry his super-strength, but Harry said that Griffin's powers were impressive and Grey had no reason to hate it as much as he did. However, Grey then revealed the side effect of his powers: every time he used it, he would age rapidly and uncontrollably, and desperately needed a cure before he died of old age, kidnapping Harry so he could create said cure. While Team Flash, with Jesse's help, learned about the situation and tried to rescue him, Harry sought to make a cure to no avail. Griffin told Harry of his plans to marry and have a life with his girlfriend, all of which were ruined when he became a metahuman. Griffin scolded Harry and accused him of ruining lives with the particle accelerator, while still confusing him with Earth-1's "Harrison Wells".

  <p key="a4ead8d6-d83e-4c61-b045-e78462b507b5">
   Harry tried to fool Griffin by diluting the compound repeatedly, but Griffin saw through the act, having developed an apt knowledge of chemistry. Once Harry said that there was no fixing him, an enraged Griffin threw him to the ground. Team Flash found Griffin and tricked him to use his powers to make him age rapidly and die, although Barry wanted him to stop. When Harry was rescued, Jesse opened his cuffs and hugged him. He and Jesse went to their room in S.T.A.R. Labs, where they discussed. Harry told Jesse that his protective attitude came from the fear of losing her, the only other person Harry loved, after the death of Harry's
   wife

As a result, when Barry asked how Team Flash would get his speed back, Harry said that he intended to right his wrongs and proposed the idea of recreating the particle accelerator explosion on Earth-1.

   Harry returned to Earth-1 with his daughter who had discovered the speedster's abilities a few days ago. He sought help from friends, wanting them to explain to you how hard it is to be a hero. They went to the
   speed lab
   , where they began to check the girl's performance. While she was running there, Harry explained to the team what he really wanted and asked Cisco to explain to Jesse that she couldn't use her abilities. He disagreed due to the fact that he has these himself. Wells decided to ask for help from Caitlin, who refused to agree, but eventually went to talk to the girl. When Harry later worked in the lab, Jesse approached him and started arguing with him, complaining that he had sent Snow on her. After that, the girl ran out and Wally went to talk to her. Only later, when
   Magenta
   caused a great commotion with the tanker, which she directed towards the hospital. Knowing that the Flash alone would not be able to defeat the meta-human and save the people from the building at the same time, he ordered Jesse to go there, noting that he believed in her. As instructed, the girl helped the hero and successfully thwarted the enemy's actions. When she returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, Harry was expecting her at the breach. After informing her that while not returning yet, he reiterated that he believed in her and that she would develop into a heroine, and ordered her to open the carton containing the coverall made by Cisco.

   Harry and the team were training Jesse Quick, and after training, the man confessed to his daughter that they had to slowly go home. The team, however, did not want to lose Harry, so Harry had the idea of ​​bringing a different self from the

   Mirror Master

   Top

However, when Flash was trapped in the mirror, the team stopped searching and began to think about a way to get the hero from the glass surface. After that, however, they checked out several versions of Harrison that had responded to the "invitation."

After this conversation, when the time was right, the heroes began to fight each other, eventually driving Allen from the future to lower his armor. To the surprise of the others, the final blow was delivered by Iris, who shot the enemy, wiping him out of space-time. After that, the team prepared H.R. a worthy funeral where they said goodbye to a brave friend and let Caitlin go and find their own new path in life. Together, they were going to rest when the Speed Force ​​began to rage over Central City. Seeing no other solution and knowing the reason for her occurrence, Allen decided to stop her by going to the speed dimension. He said goodbye to his friends and asked Harry to stay with the band for a while, to which Harry agreed.

   organization. The girl, along with the other heroes, went to the rescue, seemingly defeating the criminals. The leader,
   Veronica Dale
   , did not intend to lose so easily and activated the nuclear bomb. Seeing this, Flash launched Flashtime, which made it move so fast that time seemed to stand still. During this time, Harry was helpless, trapped in an instant at a time, until Barry touched him, asking for advice and judgment. After a short discussion, however, he lost his strength, because his body was not used to such high speed. Eventually, Barry managed to stop the bomb himself, weakening his strength. After all, before returning to his world, Harry developed a device that would help the girl understand why he could not come to terms with his wife's death. Jesse was touched to hear her mother's voice in her head, and after this difficult discussion, the scientist went with Caitlin to CC Jitters, where they talked about Killer Frost. Their discussion was interrupted by a mysterious girl who, with her clumsiness, provoked the two of them to leave the premises.

   Harry was working on creating something that would help me outsmart the Thinker. After many sleepless nights, he had the idea of ​​creating his version of the
   Thinking Cap
   , but Cisco was against irradiating dark matter with a scientist who had no control over his emotions. Wells decided to cooperate with Ralph hiding in the laboratory and he managed to create a device, but it started to burn. Meanwhile, Barry and Iris discovered Melting Point, which transferred Allen's abilities to West's body. Then Ramon realized that they couldn't wait for them to come up with a better plan and decided to help Harry, but on his terms - he didn't want the scientist to be irradiated with dark matter. Together, they managed to fix the device and at the same time reverse
   Melting Point
   by recruiting him into the team. After that, Harry and Cisco decided to test the device, discovering the names of the other two meta people on the bus -
   Janet Petty
   and
   Edwin Gauss
   .

   Harry tried to track down the other two meta humans with his mind cap, complaining about every little noise that disturbed his thinking. In addition, a furious Breacher appeared in the laboratory, waiting for help from Cisco. After many attempts, Wells tracked down
   Janet Petty
   , pointing to Flash the exact location of her appearance. The woman managed to sneak out, however, and Harry blamed himself for the sprinter's failure, believing that he could have foreseen her plan. During another attempt to catch the criminal, the Elongated Man joined the attack, thanks to whom Null was captured. As the team celebrated their victory, Harry traveled to the time vault where he put his thoughts cap on the rack and activated

   Harry told Gideon everything and used it and the time crypt to irradiate himself with dark matter through the cap, eventually inventing a device emitting sound waves similar to those generated by
   Izzy Bowin
   . The scientist introduced the equipment to the team, which were surprised to find that they could finally defeat DeVoe. Additionally, Wells tracked down
   Edwin Gauss
   , whom the team managed to catch after two tries. Meanwhile, Harry saw the thought cap disappear and began blaming Cisco for all the fuss when Joe showed up with the device. The policeman saw the addiction of the scientist to the object and was afraid for it, but gave him a choice. When the team decided to use Gauss's abilities to move to
   the Thinker dimension
   , Harry helped with the preparations. However, he did not expect Clifford's trick, which at that time appeared in the laboratory and began killing meta-humans. Harry, feeling helpless, took the helmet and went to the vault of time, where he irradiated with dark matter in full force, losing consciousness in the process. When he awoke, he helped Cisco investigate Caitlin, who had lost her powers, mourning the loss of Ralph Dibny. At the same time, he showed confusion and a lack of focus.
  </p>
  <p key="44efc5aa-e9c8-4ff9-9000-34e297794d59">
   Harry was in the time vault trying to understand his condition with Gideon. The AI ​​hinted that the scientist's irradiation with dark matter did not work and had the opposite effect - his brain begins to die. He didn't have much time to forget about the scientific stuff, but he didn't want to tell the team that anyway. While working in the lab, Ramon had the idea of ​​creating a thought cap for him too, to increase his engineering intelligence. Harry, not knowing how to get out of the situation, agreed and started working on the device, sabotaging it and saying that a special part is missing that he cannot find in his world. Cisco had a few needed parts from the holomessage from Gypsy, however, prompting a friend to take care of the upgrade immediately. The latter, however, disagreed, bursting into anger and destroying the device, telling and showing in the time vault what had happened to his brain. Ramon was shocked, but promised to try to help the scientist, noting that it would be worthwhile for the rest of the team to find out about his condition. Harry agreed, but decided to do so later.
  </p>
  <p key="54000828-3971-41a7-9fb9-c4b84002088d">
   Harry called the entire team to the lab to help Caitlin regain his power. His lack of intelligence began to take its toll, which was noticed by the others. This fact forced the man to admit to the team what and why was happening to him. Soon after, Joe asked Wells to meet up at CC Jitters, where he asked him for a favor. He meant watching over Cecile for reasons unknown to him. The detective refused to introduce them because the woman could read his mind. Hours later, the scientist was working in his workshop when Horton arrived. A discussion ensued between them, after which the prosecutor found out about her friend's ailments. She noticed that as the brain was used, it dies more and more, but she could quickly write down the scientist's thoughts before they vanished. Together, they discovered what the Thinker needs devices and materials stolen from various places for - the project "
   enlightenment
   " consisted in creating a machine that would destroy everyone's intelligence in order to teach humanity anew to live, a better life.
  </p>
  <p key="739f14c5-300d-417b-b3d0-fb134acddfca">
   When Cisco noticed that Harry felt unhelpful to the team, he asked him to call the
   Council of Wells
   to help them regain his intelligence. Only
   Harrison Wolfgang Wells
   appeared at the meeting, who began to ridicule the doppelganger, eventually expelling him from the organization and finding him useless. After a little thought, Ramon had the idea to form a new council - the
   Council of Harrisons
   , which they did. It featured
   H. Lothario Wells
   ,
   Sonny Wells
   , and
   H.P. Wells
   , who were also kicked out of the first council. When Harry told them about what had happened to him, they decided to help immediately. However, the meeting did not go according to the scientist's plan, as the conversation avoided mentioning DeVoe's name and focused on feelings, mainly Wells. Eventually, despite his frustration, the man opened up to the Council, initially thinking it was a complete waste of time, but it was only later he and Ramon noticed that the meeting had influenced the man's behavior. This helped them understand Thinker's recent behavior, concluding that his wife had abandoned him.

  <p key="b5cda25a-1a24-486e-9eb5-6457e9a64312">
   Harry tried to help the team, but his mind was behaving worse and worse. The man was stumbling over things and forgetting things he had done recently. It made him feel unnecessary and pushed away by his friends, until finally Iris asked him for help in locating
   Marlize DeVoe
   . She prepared everything they know about her and her past. They were studying the information on the board together when Wells had the idea to use a woman to defeat Clifford - only she would be able to do that, as she knew him before he became a monster. Iris was put off by this proposal, still feeling pain after what Marlize had done to her and Barry. Her anger was above the norm and she decided to go home to finish the work herself. Harry, however, was not going to give up and visited his friend in her house, where he wanted to convince her of his decisions. Their conversation gave West the idea that Marlize might be hiding in her home in
   England
   . They both took the Dimensional Explorer and moved there. The warrior was not about to give up without a fight, but before it happened, she noticed Harrison's "fault". In him, she saw the penultimate phase of enlightenment with which she was not satisfied. Iris took advantage of the confusion of Marlize's feelings and asked her to help stop Clifford's actions, knowing that she felt internally that her husband was doing evil.
  </p>
  <p key="2f0e2b9e-118d-409f-8e18-4c2e63132b9a">
   Harry and Iris returned with Marlize to the lab, but his mind began to collapse completely. He stopped expressing himself correctly and spoke only key words, and also began to draw strange symbols on the walls - the same as Barry had drawn after leaving the Force of Speed. The team sent Allen's mind into DeVoe's mind through the power of Cecille Horton to find a piece of the enemy's good. But they couldn't track her down, so Wells finally asked Ramon to put on his thoughts cap, which made him point to the right path. This, however, completely destroyed the mind of the scientist who did not even know what he was doing. After the heroes defeated DeVoe, Marlize presented Cisco with a device that could fix their friend's mind. Unfortunately, during its activation, there was a slight tension that did not allow the man to regain his full intelligence. The latter, however, did not care, because he saw the world clearly and believed that his knowledge previously obscured his rational view of the world. He immediately made the decision to leave the team and talk to his daughter, saying goodbye to the team.

   As noted by his daughter,

   Harry also seems to be rather unrepentant about his actions; despite knowing that his particle accelerator was responsible for the creation of Earth-2 meta-humans, he did not divulge this information to the public, instead trying to profit from the subsequent scare.
   Harry felt justified in this by the fact that his work was unraveling the mysteries of the universe. It wasn't until Jesse was kidnapped by Zoom did Harry begin to get involved in the quest to stop the evil speedster.
   Harry's experiences with Team Flash seemed to have awoken the conscience he ignored in the past in favor of progress as he now questions what good he has done when confronted with his character flaws that ultimately drove away his daughter, only for his friends to remind him that in spite of all his rough edges he is a hero to his core.

   However, Harry's harsh attitude appears to be derived from a desperation to save his daughter, showing that he does indeed actually care quite a bit for others that are close to him. His devotion to his daughter makes him emotionally blind, resulting in him endangering

   He advised Barry to not tell

   Harry achieved a reconciliation with Jay of sorts after the latter saved his life, his greatest relationship improvement has been with Cisco, where initially they both could barely stand to be in the same room. However, over the course of their war with Zoom, Cisco and Harry has been shown to build a rapport, work together on difficult tasks, even engage in friendly banter, such as the duo simultaneously calling Barry's new plan to deal with the zombie

Harry has single-handedly helped Cisco hone and discovered more about Cisco's vibe abilities than anyone else on the team.

Like Cisco, he is also an avid fan of movies. He is shown making a "

   Harry is also shown taking unconventional methods and was willing to risk his own life to obtain results since the beginning of his collaboration, such as when he dawned Eobard's suit in order to go rescue Caitlin from Grodd, which led to him being attacked by both Grodd and Barry, and later again to help Cisco better hone the latter's abilities. This is in stark contrast with the Harrison Wells who kept his particle accelerator mishap a secret and instead opted to create meta-human detectors from the catastrophe the mishap led to. Though, his willingness to down anything he needs to, has not always been used for the betterment of the team, as he is also shown stealing Barry's power in an effort to get his daughter back (albeit later confessing to Barry and his team). Harry was very guilt-ridden for this betrayal, to the point that he finally admitted it openly. Wanting to correct his mistake, he instructed Barry to close all bridges between Earths One and Two so Zoom can't return and face the consequences of his actions. He is also shown asking others for help, such as when he asked Joe to plead to Barry to not re-open the breaches to Earth-2, something he would have never done before.

   This had devastating results, as his neurons were catastrophically killed and he began to steadily lose his intelligence. Effectively disillusioned and finally seeing just how far he had became and now was facing true inevitable uselessness, Harry felt deep shame over this and hid his condition from everyone, effectively disillusioned from using the device, to the point of revealing it to Cisco to stop him from making the same mistake. However, with help from the
   Council of Harrisons

After DeVoe was defeated, shortly before which Harry's brain finally expired, going into a catatonic state, often mumbling insanely and mostly despondent, Marlize left a program with Team Flash to restore Harry's intelligence. Although the program gave him a human mind, his memories of his loved ones and knowledge about popular culture, it failed to restore his scientific knowledge but at this point, Harry, having gained a more empathetic and kinder nature as a result, thought of this as a blessing, since for him he now had a balance of mind and heart, and he also became humbled, as he openly admitted to Team Flash that he could no longer be held in regard to his intellect, and no longer possessed 7 PhDs due to the decreased state of his mind.

He was likewise able to render himself immune to speedsters phasing powers by infusing himself with nanites. He also successfully analyzed the

Harry was also able to program Cisco's drone so it would emit a magnetic field strong enough to pull in over 100 bombs and send them through a breach in the sky.

     Brain damage:
    </b>
    After overloading the Thinking Cap's capacities with an overdose of dark matter, Harry's mind was permanently damaged, unable to apply his high-level mental performances anymore, which even reached to the point where he entered a catatonic and unresponsive state. Later however, after the program Marlize created for Team Flash managed to restore him to his original state, he ultimately regained his highest thought parameters in late 2019.

    meta-human awareness app

It was used on Earth-2 by many people. Wells was able to detect if Cisco was a meta-human. Wells also used the watch as a recording device to log in his entries.

    : Wells took
    The Turtle
    's power after they caught him and created a device to siphon/harness Barry's speed energy and attaches behind the emblem of his suit.When Barry goes after Joey, the device works and permanently steals 2% of Barry's speed, slowing him down. Wells gives the energy to Zoom, who demands the rest. While going after Joey a second time, Iris is injured when Barry is too slow to save her. Wells later use the particles equation to increase Barry's speed. When they exchange Wally for Barry's Speed Force, Wells inserts the Speed Force transmitter into Barry's suit. Barry uses the treadmill so that his Speed Force can be extracted. All of his speed is taken and Zoom injects it to himself.
