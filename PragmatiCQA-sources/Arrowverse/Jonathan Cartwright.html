   , was a member of the
   Wonderland gang
   who was severely disfigured on the left side of his face after an accident involving fire, but possesses the innate ability to impersonate anyone by mimicking their voice and using skin grafts-made masks. He was the close friend/brother-figure of
   Beth Kane
   and acted as her second-in-command following
   Chuck Dodgson
   's arrest. Jonathan was also the son of the late Dr.
   August Cartwright
   and the grandson of the late
   Mabel Cartwright

   unnamed man

   Not long after being imprisoned in
   Arkham Asylum
   , Jonathan and Beth managed to completely take it over, having the
   warden
   killed and replaced by Jonathan, thus making them the "King and Queen of Arkham". However, he was forced to relinquish it all when Alice's obsession with destroying her sister,
   Batwoman
   , ended up getting them exposed, along with
   Tommy Elliot
   .

   Jonathan Cartwright was born in
   Gotham City
   to Dr.
   August Cartwright
   and an unknown mother. They lived in
   a cabin
   located in a rural area just outside the city. At some point in his childhood, Jonathan had an unspecified accident involving fire or a radiator
   that burned the left side of his face, leaving him hideously disfigured. Consequently, Jonathan led a lonely and isolated life, being shunned by people, especially other children, who would call him a "monster".
  </p>
  <p key="36b52a44-81b9-422e-9564-2ba5b86fcb35">
   As Jonathan was forced to remain alone at home without any friends, August vowed to fix his son's face through his skin graft experiments. However, he was abusive to Jonathan, who was scared of his father's true nature. During this time, he developed a liking for the story
   <i key="569e78c7-f215-443f-b13d-227dfa53c735">
    Alice in Wonderland
   </i>
   , which provided a respite from his troubled home life.
   Jonathan also had a difficult relationship with his grandmother,
   Mabel Cartwright
   , who despised his appearance after the accident and treated him badly, causing him to develop a certain level of fear for her.

  </h4>
  <p key="9d999fde-784b-4dd2-ac8d-198ba4faf021">
   On January 26, 2003, while Jonathan and his father were out fishing, likely together with his grandmother,
   they found
   Beth Kane
   washed up on shore after a car accident which killed
   her mother
   . She was taken home with them, as August decided to make the girl Johnny's new friend. Once Beth recovered, Johnny quietly kept his distance at first as she screamed to return home. After August left, Beth asked Johnny why he was covering his face and he revealed his scars. Johnny admitted he was afraid of scaring her, but Beth assured him that he didn't, leaving Johnny touched by her kindness.
  </p>
  <p key="b7dca360-19f7-4af7-ba92-eba6fff32cf1">
   Later, Johnny and Beth watched television together, beginning to grow closer. Johnny showed off to Beth his ability to perfectly mimic any voice he hears. A news report of Beth's disappearance then came on, prompting her to ask August why he hadn't yet called the police. However, Johnny then helplessly watched as his father grabbed Beth and imprisoned her in the basement, determined not to let her leave.
  </p>
  <p key="790db0c8-f1e2-4a49-aab0-8977b032b353">
   Shortly after, Beth managed to escape the basement and call for help, before being cut off and imprisoned again by August. When
   Jacob
   and
   Kate Kane
   arrived at the house looking for her, August ordered Johnny to mimic Beth's voice to Jacob so they wouldn't find her. Though reluctant, Johnny obeyed, convincing Jacob that the phone call was just him pulling a prank after hearing Beth's voice from the news. Jacob and Kate soon left.
  </p>
  <p key="eb46aad2-079a-4b3f-b121-ed2d6edee8fc">
   Johnny later approached the door of Beth's cell while she was crying. When she asked why he wouldn't let her out, Johnny apologized, telling Beth he wanted to be her friend. He slid the book

   underneath Beth's door and stayed to keep her company.
  </p>
  <p key="8d73357b-f99b-4560-af3f-a2f979370b60">
   Over the following year, Beth and Johnny developed a sibling-like relationship, to the point that he was regarded as the most important person to her.
   The two also began creating a secret code to make sure Johnny's father wouldn't find out about their secrets.

   On January 26, 2004, Beth's 14th birthday, Johnny visited her bringing her waffles and secretly a kitten she decided to call
   Chessy
   as in "Cheshire Cat". Later, the boy's father entered the room and Beth quickly hid the animal. The man said that his son told him about the occasion and light a candle on the waffles telling Beth to make a wish. After Beth did it, Johnny asked her what she wished for and the latter replied that she wanted to see her family again, to which August noted that saying the wish out loud means that it will never come true, then he exited the girl's cell together with Johnny.

   Later, his father tried to make Johnny a mask of skin grafts, ending up enraged and unpleased at the results as it looks too unreal. A few days later, Beth tailored a sweater for Chessy and showed it to Johnny, however the boy's father suddenly entered the cell discovering about the kitten and ruthlessly killing him in front of the kids despite they begging him to simply let him free; then, noticing how well done was the sweater he forced the girl into helping him made skin masks after telling her that his father had already remarried and thus forgotten about her. Devastated, Beth complied to her kidnapper's request, eventually realizing Johnny's first realistic skin mask.

   Sometime after that, due to her health having worsened to the point she became bound to an oxygen tank, his grandmother moved in with him, his father and Alice, whose new personality had overwritten the previous to the point she didn't remember her former life. The day the woman arrived, August ordered his son to move all of his things from the attic and, after he asked almost scared how long would she have stayed the latter told him that she was now too ill to live by herself. The woman then entered and hugged the boy complimenting him for looking better and August for having "fixed" his face.

   After Jacob Kane and

While Beth took care of her father managing to stab him, Mouse attacked Sophie mimicking Kate's voice and nearly managing to subdue her before she was able to pry his mask off and knocked him loose as he stopped to put the skin graft on his face back on. As Kate arrived, she held a gun to Mouse's head, and entered the house right before Alice could kill Jacob, telling her to decide which is more important to her: killing Jacob or keeping Mouse alive. Alice figured that Kate was bluffing, but Sophie came in aiming her gun at her. Irritated, Alice said that killing Jacob would be too easy and if they all walk out, no one had to die. Kate released Mouse and he leaves with Alice.

   Later, Mouse and Alice were reunited once more, and he surprised her with a copy of the same book he gave her many years prior, assuring her that he would escape her pool of tears. Alice said that he saved her, and gave him the face that she assembled from her stint as the Skin Pirate. Mouse said that he loved her, and Alice told her "dear brother" that she loved him too and she can help him became anyone he wanted to be.

After Mouse protested asking Alice why they were keeping the real Deveraux alive and she responded they had to keep a low profile due to being under her sister's radar, Mouse claimed Beth was changed and had gotten softer, prompting her to respond that he was the one who was changed, since he used to trust her, to which Mouse responded that he does and would have done whatever she asked him to do.

  <p key="7fd70f65-a487-49bd-a656-098bebf171af">
   The following day, he infiltrated Hamilton Dynamics and entered the room in which the weapon was kept, being immediately intercepted by
   Catherine Hamilton-Kane
   , who complimented "him" for having accomplished such a thing as making their weapon work properly. She asked him how does he resolved a specific engineering problem and, being unable to answer it, he saves himself saying it was classified information, to which Catherine reacted collegially pointing out that it could not be otherwise being it a weapon designed to penetrate the
   Batwoman suit

   Shocked at the revelation, Mouse called Alice mimicking Kate's voice, thus extorting her the confession that Kate is Batwoman. Angered, he called Beth a traitor due to still wanting to protect her sister despite she abandoned her, and in a fit of rage killed Deveraux using the gun he stole from Hamilton Dynamics.
Later that night Mouse went looking at
   Wayne Tower
   from the street and Alice joined him to comfort him, explaining she needed Kate for her "tea party" and that he wouldn't need to share her with Kate as they would share Kate between one another. Heartened, Mouse asked what would happen if Kate "didn't want to play" to which Alice replied that in that case they already have the right weapon.

Later, posing as Jacob Kane, he infiltrates
   Crows Security

Catherine managed to convince "Jacob" to hold off filing for divorce stating that no matter how difficult everything went they could face it as long as they were together, however, after he returned to the Wonderland gang's hideout, getting rid of his disguise, it was revealed to be all part of Alice's machination to prepare her "Mad Tea Party".

After discovering this, he was confronted by Kate, who asked him if he was getting back together with Catherine and how could he forgiven her for faking Beth's death, however "Jacob" claimed that he's not forgiving her rather starting to understand the reason because she did it; thus making Kate suspicious and prompting her to make him a trick question with a phone call discovering he was an impostor. Right after the girl managed to inform Sophie about her discovery with a message, Mouse drugged both her and her husband
   Tyler

   Since Tommy's various kidnappings led Crows Security to place all of Gotham's cryptography experts under surveillance, Alice then suggested to kidnap Parker Torres for the third and final attempt before her idea would be implemented; however, after Tommy failed his kidnapping mission due to Batwoman's intervention, Mouse grew even more concerned, yet he decided to play along with Alice's plan and called Luke Fox on the phone mimicking Kate's voice in order to get his location allowing Tommy to get him and Julia Pennyworth, whom they decided to use as the leverage for Luke to do the job. Though he managed to translate his father's work, both Julia and Luke decided that they would not yield the code until Batwoman arrived and traded their lives with
   a pair of eyeglasses
   that could make the journal readable.

   After accepting the exchange, much to Mouse's dismay, Alice declared that she wanted Kate dead more than she wanted peace in paradise so she opened all of Arkham's cells. This chaos, along with a fire and the Crows' arrival, caused Tommy, Mouse, and Alice to flee; Mouse's disguise as Butler was thrown to the flames. While they sat in a sewer, Mouse was unhappy and very resentful toward Alice for her choice.

   The following morning, down in the sewers of Gotham City, Mouse showed Alice how The Crows had implemented a new app that, with a touch on a button, allowed them to come to the person asking for their help. Mouse insisted that they should leave Gotham behind, but Alice was determined to complete her revenge. Then, Tommy approaches them and angrily throws the new face Alice wanted him to wear on the floor, taking out his guns and threatening the woman into giving him a new face. Much to Mouse's dismay, Alice decided to honour her promise going to
   Gotham University
   in order to take "some materials" to do the work as well as trying to retrieve

   After she returned, Mouse has had enough and told Alice that he would leave the city. She taunted him by asking how someone like him was going to survive out in the world, but he replied that he would survive just like he did for five years locked up in Arkham. He tried to make her come with him and leave behind her quest for revenge, prompting her to hug him saying that she would but first they have to make a send off party.

Eventually, blood started to come from Mouse's nose, as Alice told him that he left her no choice because she wasn't about to let him leave her; Mouse realized he had been poisoned by the person he trusted the most.

   Despite Mouse's death, Alice kept his corpse as a way to keep him close to her. After Kate's mysterious disappearance, Alice received a note from

   To get Safiyah's attention, Alice taped a rat to Mouse's corpse to attract some

   Mary Hamilton's secret clinic

   He is also prone to jealousy to the point where he will kill an
   innocent person

   someone else

   The only positive trait that Jonathan has is his undying love and loyalty towards Beth. He sees her as his one true family for she accepted him and loved him despite his horrendous appearance and was more than willing to protect her from his father's wrath.
   However, despite his love for her, he has shown to be joyful of learning she was betrayed by her sister Kate, as he most likely believes that from now on Alice will be entirely focused on him and her desire for revenge on her sister and father.
   However, he soon came to realize that Alice is more fixated on her obsession to kill Kate than anything else, including finding peace as he did while being in Arkham.
   In the end, his love for Alice was his downfall as after declaring he was going to leave her and Gotham, she poisoned him for making her choose between him and her revenge.
