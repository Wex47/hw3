   At the Gazette, Chrissy reports that there's no way the Stranger is identified with Luthor.
  </p>
  <p key="29b93672-7a99-4d01-82b2-fb90335c1805">
   Superman goes to meet him, and the Stranger discloses to him that they need to quit something that is coming. At the point when Superman finds out if he thinks Edge is the greatest danger, he says no, then, at that point advises him in Kryptonese that Kal-El is.
  </p>
  <p key="fc2f7c77-7cac-4675-bbd0-f31c9a072feb">
   In the interim, Lois gets a call from the DoD. The prints have returned, and the Stranger is really somebody who has been dead for a very long time. Not Luthor, but rather John Henry Irons. Lois acquires Chrissy's vehicle to run for help, similarly as Irons shoots Superman with a mass of red daylight. He discloses to Superman that he's the Man of Steel, calling a monster mallet to him and hitting Superman with it. He clarifies that the mallet benefits from dynamic energy, so the farther it voyages, the harder it hits. Leslie Larr, hearing what's new with her super-hearing, calls Edge and advises him to move a bigger shipment of X-Kryptonite while Superman is occupied.
  </p>
  <p key="b69d7530-5647-4db3-87f3-6d3e6164edb1">
   As Lois heads toward Clark, calling him to attempt to reveal to him that she thinks her source is the Stranger. In the interim, Jordan's super-hearing gets the assault on Superman and the young men get in the truck and begin heading toward him. Similarly as Irons is going to convey an overwhelming sledge hit to Superman with the motor mallet, the young men drive the truck into the den and run Irons over. Jon then, at that point take the mallet and crushes out the red lights, allowing Superman an unexpected surge of energy and an opportunity to arrest Irons.
  </p>
  <p key="c6f6fdc7-7dee-4e34-be13-96cd5dedddfc">
   At the DoD, Superman tells the officers close by that he and General Lane will examine Irons in the first part of the day, and nobody is to attempt it before then, at that point.
  </p>
  <p key="e118c14d-27c2-4b41-ace8-ae2ffbbe4a7e">
   At the Cushing house, Lana's companion comes in to report she landed the position, and that Edge had called her himself. She presents to Lana a bin, revealing to her that Edge disclosed to her she landed the position after he saw her with Lana.
  </p>
  <p key="e3dd5406-6ed3-4b4d-a6b3-7113c6c07aaa">
   Back at Edge's organization, he has a whiteboard together that proposes Lana has accidentally picked guinea pigs for his X-Kryptonite tests.
  </p>
  <p key="af5629ef-f2d0-4f91-a4e2-e9d05121095b">
   Back at the Kent ranch, Lois discloses to Clark that she actually has a terrible inclination about Irons, and Clark says that he anticipates getting more data tomorrow. The pair consent to tell the young men everything.
  </p>
  <p key="60f96bb9-9d7a-4b07-816d-592ee6b7d2a8">
   In one final flashback to John Henry's Earth, John and Lois' girl - Natalie - is concerned that the suit isn't prepared at this point, however John says that they know where Superman is, and this is his a single opportunity to end it. He reveals to her he will go out there and kill Superman, and afterward he'll be directly back. The two offer a sorrowful embrace, and Nat puts one of her barrettes around his wrist. He guarantees her once again that he'll be directly back, and leaves their storm cellar for what appears prone to be the last time he at any point saw his little girl. On our Earth, he sits in his cell, stroking the barrette.
