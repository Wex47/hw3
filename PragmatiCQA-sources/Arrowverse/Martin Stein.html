   the Pilgrim
   , a villain who was hunting down past versions of the Legends through time to easily eliminate their present selves. He was brought to
   The Refuge
   under the care of
   Mary Xavier
   .
   After the Pilgrim's defeat, Rip retrieved baby Martin from the Refuge and returned him to his parents, restoring his existence in the timeline.

   Martin was raised in the
   Jewish
   faith and his father made him become a rabbi before he'd allow Martin to enroll at
   MIT
   .
   As a 10-year-old, inspired by his first issue of the "

   Quentin Quale
   , as they were both part of class of '74 and protested the
   Vietnam
   War together. Their relationship could be seen as more than a mere acquaintance, for Martin was the only person with whom Quentin shared the truth about his brother's death being a suicide.
  </p>
  <p key="aee6d060-790c-4867-8383-15e5c99909b2">
   In October 1975, Martin was mingling at his university campus when he came upon a strange older man and his two friends,
   Sara Lance
   and
   Jefferson Jackson
   . The man was, in fact, Martin's older self from the future who had come to find his tracker. He invited the three of them to come with him and have some fun. Martin brought the trio to his lab and he shared some marijuana with them. He even flirted with Sara, much to the annoyance of his older self, before being called away. When he came back, he found that they were stealing his ionic tracker and wanted to know who they all really were. He was then knocked out by Sara and left unconscious.
  </p>
  <p key="d7fcaa1e-ad5b-415f-a041-8ec3aee6d1d5">
   When Martin came to, he went to track down his tracker and get it back. However, doing this caused him to miss a faculty mixer arranged by his future wife's
   uncle
   , who was a professor at
   Ivy University
   . Martin found the

    Waverider
   </i>
   and was shocked at the technology of the ship. His older self-reprimanded him for being there as he had unknowingly prevented himself from meeting his future wife,
   Clarissa
   , thus changing his future. Future Martin returned the tracker to him and tried to bid him a good future, knowing that it wouldn't be the same. However,
   Rip Hunter
   was able to "encourage" Martin to attend the mixer, thus preserving the timeline as he met and fell in love with Clarissa.

   In 1987, Martin had gone to the
   White House
   for the peace summit between the United States and the
   Soviet Union
   to serve as an advisor. Originally, he had taken Clarissa to a restaurant for her birthday. Due to a time
   aberration
   , Martin had gone to the White House instead and chose to skip Clarissa's birthday in favor of trying to get the President to acknowledge his research. He went to

   , where he came upon the same man he ran into in 1975, whom he had deduced was his older self.
  </p>
  <p key="c30aabc4-a41c-4dc3-a15e-8d3a15a6857b">
   Martin's future self called him an idiot for selfishly skipping their wife's birthday to pursue his career. When Martin learned of the true nature of the
   <i key="2720676f-e9bb-4e95-b1ba-f9b1fbadddbc">
    Waverider
   </i>
   as a time machine, he called his older self selfish for not sharing the future with him, and was told that it was he who was selfish as his actions nearly got Clarissa killed. Martin's future self told him that after all that he had accomplished in his career, the only thing that gave his life true meaning was Clarissa. Martin affirmed that Clarissa meant everything to him and his future self told him to prove it to her and himself and cherish her. Martin vowed that he would make sure that Clarissa would always know how much she meant to him.
  </p>
  <p key="ff4e01d5-72de-4f10-a5f9-b31452500e63">
   Unknowingly, this set Martin on a new path which resulted in him going on to have a daughter with Clarissa that he didn't have previously. He and Clarissa named their daughter
   Lily
   . Martin was a caring, devoted father to Lily as he enjoyed rolling her stroller in the neighborhood to help her sleep and loved it when she smiled at him.
  </p>
  <p key="d98b49be-8c31-4af2-bb91-f3d090c67787">
   In 1992, Martin went to buy a
   Beebo
   doll for Lily as a
   Hanukkah
   gift. He saw there was one left in the store and calculated the best way to get it before any of the other shoppers. He found a novelty bow with a toy arrow and used it to shoot an ornament-free to knock the doll into his hands. The shoppers then chased after him and he ran away and somehow found himself back in the past when the Vikings had come to North America. The Vikings had believed that the Beebo doll was a god and Martin tried to act as a translator to stay alive but his ruse quickly ended and was made a prisoner. He suddenly found himself saved by the crew of the
   <i key="a48f2f14-c6ae-4f10-bb50-fd633b27bd29">
    Waverider
   </i>
   who, especially Jax, were awkward around him. He told them that the Beebo doll would go on to change history and found that the United States would be a Viking country called New Valhalla. He went back to the
   <i key="5b73f83f-2706-44db-867c-970cd32d02b5">
    Waverider
   </i>
   where he asked about his future self but the crew told him that he had gone to back to his family for the holidays. He then asked if he could be taken back to his and Jax said that he would take him.
  </p>
  <p key="038eab9b-842f-4e48-9a5e-8670f2c5a44c">
   When he returned to 1992, Jax gave him a letter with a date and told him not to open it until then. Martin then admitted that he realized that his future self must've died and this was Jax's attempt to change his fate. Jax told him to open the letter as it would mean his entire future. However, Martin burned the letter as soon as he got home and was not surprised to find Jax visiting him. He explained his actions of destroying the letter and told Jax that he was not scared of the future as it was clear he would go on to have a full life with his wife and daughter and end up having many exciting adventures. He also saw that he would make a great friend in Jax as he was willing to do these things for his sake. He advised Jax that he had to let him go as no one could live forever.

   Martin went on to accomplish various achievements in the scientific field and even had a table for all the awards he received, though his wife
   Clarissa
   would remark that perhaps he was just a tad too focused on his career. However, Martin still loved Clarissa very much, and often spoke of his affection for her when conversing with his friends.
   He wrote numerous papers on a vast array of scientific theories, a number of which were for the
   Oxford University
   Press; one of them was about the topic of time travel, published around 1990, and became well known in certain circles.

   That night, Martin was near
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   and happened to be in the middle of an anti-
   particle accelerator
   protest. When the accelerator exploded, he became exposed to the
   Firestorm Matrix
   and the wave, containing particles of
   Ronnie Raymond
   , hit him, fusing the two together. Martin Stein was considered "missing" for a long time afterward, unable to coherently control Ronnie's body as both minds fought for control.

  <p key="494c951c-d8ff-49f2-b265-e6ace4b9c292">
   One month later, Stein (in Ronnie's body) found himself trashed. He went back to his wife, who could not recognize him as he took on the appearance of a stranger, forcing him to flee from their house and live on the streets.

   eventually tracked him down and managed to persuade him to come in, thanks to Clarissa. As the team ran tests on Stein, they discovered that Ronnie's body was becoming unstable and that he would eventually explode. Hearing this, Stein traveled as far as he could from the city to avoid harming anyone. Caitlin and Barry tracked him down and tried to prevent him from exploding by putting a device on his chest, which didn't seem to work at first, as the explosion still happened with Barry and Caitlin barely escaping the blast.

   They succeeded in separating. However, Martin and Ronnie maintained synchrony in their brain waves, enabling them to communicate telepathically to a degree. General
   Wade Eiling
   eventually sought to kidnap both of them to experiment on, succeeding in kidnapping Martin. Ronnie sensed Martin being in danger, used a piece of broken glass to carve a message, hoping Martin would receive it; he did, and in return, sent a Morse code respond to share the location where he was kept captive, thus Barry and Ronnie went to rescue Martin. While Barry was occupied, Martin and Ronnie were cornered, and forced to merge. However, this time, having accepted each other and achieved balance, both of their minds were active on a conscious level. Although Ronnie was in control of the

   While incarcerated inside the Particle Accelerator, Eobard Thwane revealed his plan of having Barry Allen opening up wormhole inside the accelerator in order for him to time-travel back to the future. Eobard proposed that when the wormhole opened, Barry should use it to travel back to the night when his mother got killed and prevent her assassination. Hearing this proposal, Martin discussed the complications, calming that if Barry does decide to prevent Nora's death then his entire life and all of the current history up to that point would be completely erased and Barry would never have met all the people in his new life as The Flash. However, Martin remained uncertain of the full extent of the repercussions.

   Doctor Stein began analysing the variables of the wormhole in order to verify Thawne's claims, working alongside Eobard's distant grandfather,
   Eddie Thawne
   . Eddie immediately felt unqualified to help so he decided to leave, but he was stopped by Martin who said that he is equally important as anyone else. Eddie gave a rebuttal by mentioning Eobard's claims about the future, how Eddie failed to accomplish anything in his life. However, Martin dismissed these claims by pointing out to Eddie the incredible coincidence of him and his distant grandson existing in the same moment in time and that he is the only person in that era who Eobard is incapable of killing. Martin believed that Eddie is the only individual in this entire scenario he exhibits free-will. Just as he encouraged Eddie to stay, Martin noticed that one of the possible outcomes of opening up the wormhole would be the creation of a singularity, a black-hole capable of swallowing the entire planet and he immediately warns the rest of the team.

   When The Flash ran to stabilize the singularity, Martin merged with Ronnie and flew up to the singularity in order to separate it in the eye. They succeeded in stopping the singularity from swallowing up Central city with some consequences. During their effort to destroy the singularity Ronnie and Martin separated and Ronnie was pulled into the singularity which possibly killed him.

   Jefferson "Jax" Jackson
   and
   Henry Hewitt
   . Henry Hewitt was not able to merge with Stein as he was incompatible so they had to resort to the second choice Jefferson Jackson. During a fit of rage Henry discovered his new abilities. Henry was both enraged and jealous of this decision and tried attacking Caitlin in the garage Jax was working in, Jax successfully defended her and they both escaped to S.T.A.R. Labs. The team found out Henry was wreaking havoc in the stadium Jax used to play in. After discussing the dangers of Henry the team decided in order to tackle Henry, Jefferson Jackson and Martin Stein had to merge. The merge was successful and Jax had the physical and mental control of firestorm. After a long battle with Henry Hewitt, Firestorm and The Flash succeeded in defeating Henry. Later Jefferson Jackson and Martin Stein decided to leave Central City in order to train.

   Firestorm
   . Stein told Jax to be careful, as 83% of the chemicals were flammable. Jax however still shot fireballs all over the place. While Firestorm defeated the man, Stein was still upset that Jax doesn't listen to him. Jax told him to stop treating him like one of his "snot nosed undergrads" when they were intercepted by
   Rip Hunter
   . Martin and the rest of Rip Hunter's recruits woke up on top of a building where Rip informed them of the impending threat of

   Before embarking on Rip's mission, Jax from a few months into the future time traveled to just before the team left due to future Martin sending him back to 2016 to reverse the effects of temporal radiation and he made contact with Martin. Jax and Martin scavenged Eobard's
   Time sphere
   for parts to the jump ship with Jax noting that present Martin was more arrogant than future Martin. As they were saying their goodbyes, Martin apologized for being an insufferable know-it-all and Jax told him that his present self would be very angry about Martin drugging him later but that he would eventually consider it the best decision he never made. Jax then left and time traveled back to the

As Firestorm, he and the Atom provided enough cover for the rest of the team to make it to the time ship. Hiding in the temporal zone, the team learned of Rip's status as a rogue
   Time Master
   and the murder of his family by Savage. Martin then suggested that everyone needed time to think about their options. Martin apologized to Jax for bringing him unwillingly and offered to go home. However, Jax had a change of heart and wanted to stay.

   The team next headed to Norway, where Savage was holding a black market auction of a nuclear bomb. Against Rip's wishes, they went after Savage during the auction. When the team had difficulty with an ID checker, Martin was able to swindle the guard allowing the team into the auction. However, Savage sensed the presence of

However, the team failed to kidnap Savage and he escaped, activating the bomb while leaving. Firestorm flew the bomb away and absorbed the nuclear energy. Unfortunately, Ray left a piece of his
   exosuit
   behind, altering history. Martin and Ray deduced that the exosuit's alpha particles can be tracked with a device created by a younger Martin Stein in 1975.

   The younger Stein lost opportunity to meet his future wife
   Clarissa

   Sara Lance
   , and her proceeding to knock him out, he refused to go to a Facility Mixer. Rip convinced the young Martin Stein to go and meet his dear Clarissa. Stein became depressed upon realizing that despite believing he had matured over the years, he was still just as arrogant as his younger self. After Savage forced a captured
   Leonard Snart
   to contact the team, they came to the rescue. Firestorm was able to knock Savage out, but Kendra and Carter were unable to finish him. Savage then killed Carter and wounded Kendra forcing the team to retreat. Rip took Martin back to the university to show him his/Marty's meeting with Clarissa. Back on the time ship, they renewed their commitment to defeating Savage in memory of Carter. Later, Jax helped encourage Stein by showing him that he has indeed matured into a kind, smart and selfless man who is willing to do anything to save the world to make it a better place.

   When Kendra's wound worsened, Martin and Ray discovered fragments of the
   Amon Dagger
   in her bloodstream. Ray tried to use his A.T.O.M. suit to destroy the fragments with Martin's help but he panicked and stopped the procedure. Ray resented the fact that Martin didn't remember him as one of his top students. Later, Martin confided to Ray that he acted like he didn't remember Ray because he was jealous that as one of his students, Ray seemed more brilliant than he was. In a second attempt, Martin guided Ray through Kendra's bloodstream and managed to destroy all of the remaining dagger fragments. Ray then realized Martin had lied about remembering him as a student, but Martin justified it by saying that Ray needed the push. After the rest of the team recovered Carter's body from Savage, they held a funeral for Carter and Aldus.

However, Savage threatened the lives of Ray and Mick, forcing Martin to give Valentina the equation for Firestorm. Valentina was able to forcibly merge with Stein to create a new Firestorm, but with Jefferson's encouragement and recognition that he had only left Jefferson behind out of fear rather than a lack of trust, Stein was able to separate from Valentina, triggering a nuclear explosion that destroyed Valentina and the

When the Legends detected an aberration in Washington D.C. in 1987, Martin went off with Jax to the White House to find the cause. He knew that he was in Washington for the nuclear peace summit but was surprised to find his younger self in the White House as he knew that he hadn't been there and knew that time was already changing. Ray and Rory found out that Damien Darhk was there and he quickly warned Sara to not do anything rash but she ignored him. They were almost caught by the Secret Service but managed to escape arrest. He warned Sara that in her quest to try and save her sister by killing Darhk almost 30 years before his actual death could have grave consequences. Stein then listened in when Ray and Rory ran surveillance on Darhk but his younger self had arrived. He was surprised as he remembered it was his wife's birthday today but his younger self had chosen to stand her up in order to try and ask Darhk for a chance to bring his research to President Reagan's attention. His younger self seemed to notice that Darhk was meeting with the KGB for a side deal right before he was stabbed.

   Stein was then reunited with his younger self who had deduced who he really was after their last encounter. Stein then yelled at him for leaving their wife alone which had gotten him into this mess in the first place. He then went with the team who managed to gain access into to the White House through
   Obsidian
   to interrupt Darhk's deal with the
   KGB
   but had run into Clarissa who had come to look for her husband. When they met, she felt as if she knew Martin from somewhere though he claimed that he was one of her husband's work friends. When it was discovered that Darhk had planted a bomb, he and Jax went as Firestorm and got Clarissa to safety. When his younger self was recovered, he gave him a stern lecture of being selfish in abandoning their wife all to further their research. He told her that Clarissa was all that gave his life real meaning, not his work and that he had to cherish her. His younger self seemed to agree and promised that he would never stop loving their wife and always let her know how important she was to him.

   Over time, Martin was starting to see flashes of a girl. At first, he thought that he was suffering some kind of mental affliction and had his brain scanned by Gideon though nothing was wrong with him. He discussed what was happening with Jax and together they came to the conclusion that what was happening to Martin was due to his interaction with his younger self in 1987. Martin didn't know who the woman was that he was seeing, though he was certain that he loved her. Jax took this to mean that he might've had another woman in his life other than Clarissa.

Martin then had more flashes of the mystery woman and he asked for Caitlin to take him home. Caitlin was wracked with guilt due to her hurting her friends because of her powers and Stein offered her both advice and solace in the fact that it wasn't really her doing those things.

   Stein went to S.T.A.R. Labs to try and work on a weapon to use to stop the Dominators. Caitlin had revealed that she had brought Lily to come and help them. He was surprised to see that Lily was a technical expert and she was eager to help her father. However, whenever Lily tried to engage Martin in conversation, he tried to distance himself from her. Caitlin asked why he was shutting Lily out and he revealed to her that Lily was a time aberration he created by interacting with his younger self. Caitlin then asked if he was going to go back in time and erase her and he told her that he was going to restore the timeline back. When Lily started to lose her temper at not being able to find a solution to the weapon and was ready to take off. Caitlin told Stein that Lily was really upset over her father keeping her at arms length and not understanding why. He argued that it wasn't the time for family drama but she argued that they needed Lily's help. Stein went to apologize to Lily and told her that he was being distant because of the new complications in his life. What he said seemed to spark inspiration in Lily and together, they were able to find the missing piece in creating the weapon. Martin then realized how remarkable his daughter truly was.

The team then discovered a new aberration in Chicago of 1927. When Ray let

   Al Capone

To keep history back on track, they had to get the ledger of Capone's dealings for Ness and Nate guessed it was in his speakeasy. The team was ready to move in when they ran into Damien Darhk.

When he asked if she had considered taking the deal, she did consider it but he taught her better than that. Stein then confessed about him causing an aberration which resulted in him now having a daughter. Sara was surprised and angry, especially with how he had convinced her to not try and save her sister when they were interrupted by Damien Darhk. He had Stein taken away where he met the speedster, who Stein felt he knew from somewhere. The speedster admitted that their past was complicated and then used a device to painfully steal his appearance. He was then taken by Capone to be thrown in the river but his friends realized the deception and Sara had made a deal to trade the amulet to learn where he was.

   Stein stumbled upon Rory who revealed that he had been seeing a ghost of Leonard Snart. He asked Stein for his help but told him to not tell the others that he was seeing him. He was trying to help Rory learn what could be causing this when Sara came and told them that Rip had been found in 1967. He had been arrested and to get him out, Stein played the role of a psychiatrist. He, Rory, and Sara were shocked to see Rip again, though the man didn't recognize them and was now Phil Gasmer. He resisted going with them as they thought they were to take him to a mental facility. Rory knocked him out and they tried to take him out but Darhk and Merlyn had arrived, looking for him as well.

Rory then had an idea to use Gideon to find out what was making him see Snart, though Stein told him that his visions weren't neurological or psychological. However, Rory insisted. He ran the scan and found that Rory had some kind of chip in his head that looked like a receiver that was placed there by the Time Masters when he was Chronos. Stein guessed that when Snart died in the Oculus blast, the chip honed in on the wavelength of the energy letting him see Snart. Rory asked him to remove it though Stein was a bit nervous. Stein managed to remove it but learned that the chip hadn't been able to work in months so it wasn't the cause. He guessed that it simply the reason Rory was seeing Snart was simply how he was emotionally dealing with his friend's death.

   The team was still reeling from facing the Legion and losing Rip to them. They now had the medallion yet they were lost on how it worked.

Stein and Jax went to Jitters to meet with this person though Stein insisted that Jax didn't have to stay. It was then revealed that the person he was meeting was his daughter Lily. Jax was stunned to actually meet her while Lily was happy to see her father again. He then brought out the medallion for Lily to analyze and she pulled out a portable ionic particle scanner which he was surprised as he had never seen one in a compact version before and she revealed that she developed it herself. Using her device, she was able to activate the medallion's power and he then decided to bring Lily back to the

Stein went off to drink alone following this and was found by Jax. Martin then revealed that the reason that he and Clarissa didn't have children the first time around was because he didn't have a good father himself and feared he would have become just as bad as him. Jax then suggested that he speak with Lily and tell her how he really feels. The team was trying to identify their speedster enemy when Stein went to them looking for his daughter. When the team theorized that the speedster must no longer exist, Martin realized that their enemy was Eobard Thawne.

He was shocked when Sara was brought aboard, suffering being shot by Rip. Jax told him to try and help Sara without Gideon but Martin tried to remind him that he wasn't a doctor but Jax told him that today he would have to be.

They then found another fragment in 507 A.D. but Martin chose to stay on the ship so he could analyze the tech he got from Mid-Nite's lab. However, Mick caught onto him and found that he stole the tech though he quickly told him that he 'borrowed' it which Mick laughed at in amusement. When Jax returned with some mind control tech that Rip and Damien Darhk were using on Camelot's knights, Martin saw that it went as a set to the device he took from the lab. He learned that the 'commander' wore the one that he took while the 'soldier' wore the one that Jax brought to him. They then hoped that they could hack the signal from Rip's commander device and disrupt his control. Martin tried to use it to control Mick but it didn't have any effect.

He had Mick use the commander device and Stein wore the soldier one and when he fell under Mick's sway they learned that the key was intelligence but intensity.

As they were inside, Martin began pacing as he worried about Jax's safety. Rory told him that he had to let Jax make his own decisions and learn to do things his way as Stein wouldn't be around forever. He told Stein that Jax was his partner so he had to treat him as a partner and trust more in him. Stein then saw that Sara and Jax succeeded and Rip was back to his old self.

Stein and the rest of the team began checking his background and guessed that he might have gone to work to NASA and found a photo of Henry in the Apollo-13 mission control in 1970. The team went to the site to look for him and were able to quickly find Heywood who punched Rip as soon as he saw him. They then learned that Henry arranged for his fragment of the spear to be placed on the moon in order to protect it. However, they saw that the history of the Apollo mission had changed which meant that the spear fragment was in danger. Stein, Jax, and Rory were taken to mission command by Heywood where they posed as technicians from the British Space Program to serve as the rest of the team's eyes and ears as they headed for the moon.

Martin was with the rest of the team as Rip told them that the Legion was operating from the Vanishing Point. The team carefully moved through the destroyed outpost of the Time Masters in separate teams. Firestorm was with Rip and they managed to find the safe where the Legion was keeping their fragments. To get inside, Firestorm converted the safe into jelly beans and then fled with the last two fragments. Back on the ship, the pieces of the spear were all gathered together and they watched as they merged as one. When Rory tried to destroy the spear with his Heat Gun, it revealed words that turned out to be the key to destroying the spear. Nate saw they would need the blood of Christ and the team went to 1914 to find

Stein saw the bruise and assumed that Rory had simply fallen and hurt himself until the Legends learned that the Legion had recruited Snart from a point before he joined the Legends as an extra asset.

Eventually, he discovered that Lily was pregnant and was overjoyed that he was going to be a grandfather. When Jax returned one day and revealed that he had dropped out of college, the

Stein disguised himself as a clown to infiltrate and was cornered by other clowns, but Mick appeared to overcome his fears and to save his friend. Martin and Mick teamed up to beat the clowns and merged with Jax to help him escape and fixed the anachronism by making a great show.
   When Amaya started behaving weird with the totem, Stein decided to help her, but found nothing wrong with Amaya and apologized for not finding anything.

   Stein and the team agreed to help Rip fix an anachronism in 1895. Martin saw that Jax was behaving strangely, but he didn't care. Martin realized that his ancestor,
   Henry Stein

Martin and Jax said goodbye to Hedy, who gave Stein a kiss on the cheek, mentioning that she prefers old men.

He is standing the oath of what seems to be knights, which are in a rush to get somewhere.

   Once the Legends arrived, Jax and Stein enlisted the help of Cisco and
   Harry Wells
   to perfect a formula to release them from the F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M Matrix. The formula would break their link safely, as well as erase their powers, ending Firestorm, much to Jax's disappointment. Sometime later, while everybody was preparing for the rehearsal dinner and wedding, Stein was working on a different formula when Caitlin came to see him. He told her that he knew that she assisted Cisco and Harry in making the formula, and thanked her. They talked about how the previous wedding they attended was her and Ronnie's. Snow asks Stein of his plans once he was free of the F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M Matrix, to which he replies that he wishes to be with his growing family and to tell his grandson about his adventures, as well as teaching him how to play chess. Caitlin then reminded him of the rehearsal dinner, and Stein told her to go ahead as he continued to work on the new formula.

   Stein arrives late to the dinner, to which Jax asked him of his where he was and why he was late. Stein then revealed that he was working on a formula that would grant Jax a different set of powers based on spider DNA. Jax was interested in the prospect of being a Spider-Man esque hero, but quickly lost interest once he was told he would be able to stick to anything, but nothing else beyond that. Stein then told him that if he took the formula, he could still be a Legend, thinking that it would make Jackson happy. Jax leaves Stein in disappointment.

He and Jax then merged into Firestorm and joined the fight along with the rest of the heroes.

   While invading a Nazi stronghold containing a breach gateway, Stein noticed that the power needed to be hotwired in order to activate the breach. He suggested that he and Jax separate in order to do both tasks quickly before Red Tornado came to destroy the doomsday weapon. Jax managed to divert power but was surrounded by enemy fire. Stein decided to activate the breach himself and ran towards the switch. Before he was able to reach the switch, he was shot by a Nazi and the

   's camaraderie, asking if they were going to start chanting soon. However, after being rescued by the Flash, with the help of the team, he seems to have warmed up to the idea of the collaboration. This was even more apparent when he returns with Ronnie to help Barry. Not only did he help Barry travel back in time, but he also helped a disheartened Eddie understand his role in everything that was happening.

  <p key="157f3502-1059-4bda-8d92-2d3872b81203">
   Martin was very articulate and speaks in a very cultured and academic way that is sometimes misconstrued as arrogant or sometimes impossible to even understand; because of this, he was generally incapable of referring to someone by their nickname, calling Ronnie "Ronald", calling Jax "Jefferson" and everyone else either Mr. or Ms. followed by their surname, such as referring to Sara as "Ms. Lance".
  </p>
  <p key="d5e1b8ef-2090-4c87-824e-858c517a2815">
   In combat and as Firestorm, Martin was very brave, dangerous, and sometimes brutal, despite his personality when not fighting. He attacked Barry and tried to kill him by dropping him from the sky, out of anger for Barry and his team not leaving him alone as he told them to. Even without Firestorm, he was brave enough to fight hand to hand with Time Pirates and knock out some of them on his own. While co-piloting Firestorm's body, he was willing to be part of killing in battle. In this regard, while he dislikes fighting, he was not afraid of it and will fight as a last resort or to defend himself.
  </p>
  <p key="78059da0-85b3-4093-83d6-a3eb673f3d1a">
   Martin had an irrational fear of zombies, extending to the point where he cannot hear or say the word without difficulty, and apparently has never had the courage to watch zombie movies. This became a problem when Mick became a zombie and starting to attack him and Ray. Martin became overwhelmed with fear, but managed to overcome it, as evidenced when he faced Mick alone.
  </p>
  <p key="9b6848a3-feff-47c7-b1f3-bffc13ab3b70">
   Martin, despite his academic nature, was often subject to his rather powerful emotions. Due to the trauma of having lost Ronnie, his original fusion partner for Firestorm, he often berates Jax on his recklessness. This was out of fear of losing another partner and having to face the prospect of telling Jax's mother that her son died. Martin was also a very caring man, who had taken issue when confronting his rather arrogant and selfish younger-self, who he personally verbally skewered, informing him that his wife was the most important achievement of his life. This shows how much Martin had changed over time.
  </p>
  <p key="c680ed5e-0a2a-42d4-8354-cde970a27f09">
   While loving his family, Martin originally had reservations about becoming a parent, mainly stemming from how poorly his father was to him. However, upon meeting his daughter Lily, who did not exist prior to temporal alterations, Martin was overwhelmed by emotions. While he described from his new memories that he loved her, he initially tried to keep her at a distance in an attempt to convince himself that her existence was not real. However, upon meeting her and working alongside her, he came to fully accept his feelings for her as genuine. To which, as he continues to gain more memories of raising Lily, he became more fond and glad of his accident with the timeline. His love for her was so great that he attempted to hide the truth about her existence from the team, fearing that their knowledge of her being a time alteration would make them undo the changes. Overall, while Martin had a deep appreciation for maintaining the natural course of events and not intentionally altering them, he was able to accept the unique benefits of accidental changes, proved that his compassion for others can go beyond rationality. To which, he proved himself to not be a hypocrite as upon learning of

   Martin was known for his extreme loyalty, often putting the safety of his loved ones above all else, often going to unique extremes in order to protect those closest to his heart. In his older age, Martin prioritizes his wife, daughter, and Jax above all else, with Jax being as close as family to him due to their bond of not only nuclear energy but the camaraderie that borders on paternal, having openly stated on multiple occasions that he views Jefferson as a son.

       Matter transmutation

      </b>
      While fighting
      Nazis
      in 1944, Jax and Martin discovered that their nuclear powers can manipulate matter at an atomic level and arrange its subatomic structure so that it becomes a different substance altogether. Firestorm first used this by turning a rifle into dust by simply grabbing it. When the two minds focused, Firestorm was later able to transform a radioactive meteorite into water.

      Firestorm is virtually a living reactor, and as such, creates great amounts of nuclear energy via the numerous atomic reactions constantly occurring in his body. That and his mental capacity to process both fission and fusion, allow him to harness the energy emitting from either his own body or any source of energy that’s near.

      Jefferson can hear Martin Stein's disembodied voice while the two of them are merged into Firestorm.

      Due to the unique nature of the transmutation between the two bodies, Firestorm is able to produce nuclear energy in the form of nuclear-based fire from his body. He can use his control over the energy to project it willingly in the form of concussive blasts. These "nuclear blasts" are often shown to be quite powerful and have shown to be able to knock unarmed humans out unconscious and are hot enough to burn through solid structures and even cause harm to meta-humans. Stein has exhibited some pyrokinetic ability even without another half to join with him, though it was a sign of approaching death.

      Firestorm has so far seen to have at least two methods to achieve flight. The first and most common is when he uses fires nuclear blasts downward at a consistent rate, thereby generating enough force to defy gravity and allow for stable propulsion. This flight style is his preferred and most practiced choice. The second method is unclear, as he is shown to be able to fly at impressive speeds without the need of his blasts. He displayed this ability when he attempted to disarm Vandal Savage's missile. How he achieved this skill or how he even does it is unclear.

      , Martin had a remarkable amount of understanding of the science of time, where in addition to publishing several papers on this topic alone,
      he was even able to correctly calculate that by running fast enough to rip open a hole in the space-time continuum it is possible to achieve the feat, and he also displayed a decent amount of knowledge over the effects of time-travel, being able to give a thorough explanation of how Barry time traveling to save his mother could completely erase the timeline they were living in now and drastically alter the course of his life. From his time in the Legends, Martin's understanding and knowledge of time became greater than ever, being able to correctly predict how Savage could destroy the timeline. Martin was also accomplished in biology, being able to develop the gene therapy needed to revert the
