   After suffering a clinical death from a seizure and subsequently being revived by her regenerative powers, her biochemistry was altered, culminating in her becoming fully consumed by her anger as Killer Frost, later encountering and allying with
   Savitar
   after the proclaimed speedster god reveals his true identity as a future version of Barry Allen. Later, between Cisco giving Caitlin the choice to cure herself rather than force it on her and watching Savitar nearly kill him, Caitlin finally regained her true personality and control of her powers. Despite this, Caitlin decided not to take the cure. Feeling lost to her own identity, Caitlin left Team Flash on good terms to rediscover herself. Six months later, having seemingly come to terms with her mistakes as Killer Frost, Caitlin finally decided to re-join Team Flash, only to discover that her Killer Frost-side had returned.

   Shortly after returning to Team Flash, Caitlin once again began to struggle with her Killer Frost side and eventually lost control.
   Iris
   convinced both Caitlin and Killer Frost that they could try to be the same person instead of choosing one life or the other. As such, when preparing to serve as back up to Barry along with Cisco, she stated "Snow and Frost standing by", emphasizing that both Caitlin and Killer Frost were prepared to work together to help.

   Earth-X

   's affection. In a battle against
   Clifford DeVoe
   , she lost her Killer Frost side as a result of
   DeVoe
   using
   Dominic Lanse
   's powers to create a mental block. After defeating
   Siren-X
   from Earth-X, Caitlin discovers that Killer Frost is still inside her, without the presence of
   dark matter
   . She later learns, from a suppressed memory, that Killer Frost has been with her since childhood, before she was exposed to the dark matter released by the particle accelerator.

   her father
   's death certificate was a fake and that he was actually alive. Barry, Cisco and Caitlin eventually found him hiding out in an old warehouse. However, he later revealed himself to be
   Thomas' evil alternate personality
   and attempted to kill the team and take over Thomas' body completely. During the fight, Caitlin managed to break through the mental block that DeVoe had created and regain Killer Frost. By late 2019, she'd begun referring to her alternate persona simply as "

   Eventually, Caitlin and Frost are affected by exposure to the

  <p key="a6098ab1-1ad5-46e7-a1c6-bc72e09e315d">
   Caitlin was very close to her father; on
   Christmas
   , they would watch old holiday movies together as it snowed for hours without end outside.
   Thomas personally mentored Caitlin in multiple fields of science and the two partook in various educational activities together for their own entertainment.
   However, Caitlin's father later fell ill, suffering from multiple sclerosis.
   During this period, Thomas realized that Caitlin had inherited his gene for ALS and used experimental cryogenic therapy to save her by freezing the progression of the disease, just as he'd done for himself. While the experimental trials successfully cured Caitlin, they left her with a dormant cryokinetic-powered alternate personality, who would later be known as

   One day, Caitlin was out riding her bicycle with her father when she fell off and got her leg stuck in the bike as a car sped towards her. Her resulting injuries and fear caused Killer Frost to manifest for the first time, triggering Caitlin's transformation into her alter-ego. Despite her father's protests, Caitlin looked into her bicycle mirror and saw her transformation, causing her to scream in terror. Caitlin would repress this memory and Killer Frost for years.

   At some point following this, Thomas apparently died from ALS when Caitlin was 10 years old,
   much to her and her mother's heartache. After Thomas' death, Carla began focusing only on her work as a way to cope with the pain, and her subsequent neglect of Caitlin left them estranged for years.

   Caitlin was a bright pupil and studied at fine learning institutions through her own merit.
   As an adult, she became a trained scientist and neurosurgeon. Despite their estrangement, Carla offered Caitlin a position at the former's research company,
   Tannhauser Industries

   Sometime before 2011, Caitlin moved to
   Central City
   , where she did her residency at
   Central City General Hospital

   During this time, Caitlin studied under Dr.

   Ronnie Raymond

   In spite of their very different natures, Caitlin and Ronnie fell deeply in love and started dating. Upon getting together, the two found they had trouble communicating at work, so they attended couples counseling for a time.
   Though Caitlin enjoyed working at S.T.A.R. Labs, she, like most employees, was often irritated by Dr. Wells' protégé,
   Hartley Rathaway

   At one point, the S.T.A.R. Labs team was under a strict deadline working on the particle accelerator. Caitlin, Cisco, and Ronnie were struggling, working late at night on the iridium plating for the synchotron, and they could not get the dubnium capacitor to hold a single charge. Eventually, Ronnie lost his calm demeanor and yelled, "Come on, you dumb-nium capacitor! Take charge!"

   S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator
   was to be switched on. She and her fiancée,
   Ronnie
   , were discussing their honeymoon when they were alerted of the impending switching on.
   Dr. "Harrison Wells" paused for a moment and walked into the hall, and when Cisco and Caitlin came to check on him, he asked Caitlin to retrieve the bottle of Dom Pérignon they had been saving.

However, Ronnie had had Cisco put the accelerator into lock-down, locking him inside the core chamber. Caitlin and Ronnie talked, but before they could continue, Ronnie's connection was lost, and he was seemingly killed inside the chamber, greatly upsetting Caitlin.

Labs, explaining in depth what had actually happened. Later, after discovering that he had the ability to run at super-speed, the team of four headed down to
   an airfield
   . After Barry commented on her lack of smiling, she admitted that it felt like the best course of action considering what she'd been through. As Cisco monitored Barry's speed, Caitlin measured his energy output, amazed at how fast he could run, before colliding with some water barrels. They headed back to S.T.A.R. Labs where Wells and Barry discussed the potential for the existence of other people like him, specifically another who had super speed like Barry, though Harrison was certain that Barry was unique.

They agreed to help, and Cisco revealed a suit he'd designed for use by firefighters, which he believed would fit Barry's needs perfectly. Barry donned the suit and headed out to where they pinpointed Mardon to be. Cisco and Caitlin communicated with Barry, giving support. When Barry began to attempt to unravel it, Cisco stated his belief that Barry could withstand the pressure, though Caitlin didn't believe Barry himself would. However, after motivation from Dr. Wells, he eventually did.

   After a run-in with a strongman at the
   Central City National Bank
   , Barry arrived back at
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   with a wrongly-healed ankle, after having previously broken it. They decided to re-break it, and Caitlin suggested to run extra tests to make sure that there was no further damage. Following that, Caitlin and Cisco tagged along with Barry to grab some DNA samples from the crime scene at which the strongman had been.
   While analyzing the sample, they helped Barry find a group of chimpanzees that had escaped from the
   Central City Zoo
   . As he locked them up, they revealed that the DNA sample was that of
   Joey Rose
   , a former strongman at the
   Central City Circus
   . They delved deeper into the closed circus, discovering that its owner had escaped from
   Belle Reve
   and killed several people.
   They notified Barry of this, while Dr. Wells also provided some details he knew on Mr. Bliss from having attended the circus previously, and Barry left to find the circus.
   Having been gone for a while, Cisco and Caitlin took a truck and crashed through the tent of the circus.

   Cisco grabbed Barry and Caitlin attempted to drive away, however, their truck was lifted up by Joey Rose, who threw it some distance from the circus tent. As they crawled from the wreckage, they encountered the snake lady. The lady promised to let them pass, but Caitlin believed it to be a trap. The lady assured her that she was genuine, as they were only compliant with Mr. Bliss otherwise torture would be inflicted on them. Before leaving, Caitlin asked what all of it was about, but the woman was only aware that something big was happening. They headed back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Caitlin explained what had happened to Barry and Cisco further explained what the snake lady had told them.
   Caitlin suggested that she could experiment with psychotropic drugs on Barry, though she was unsure how he would react. Noticing that Mr. Bliss had arrived at a
   Central City Cougars
   match, Dr. Wells urged that they go down to warn everyone. Having destroyed the work van, they took Cisco's car, which Caitlin found unhygienic and tiny.
   As they arrived, they noticed that The Flash had already evacuated everyone. Iris greeted them and they claimed to be there for the circus.

   Caitlin walked in on Cisco as he guided Barry towards a burning building to save people inside. Once he had saved everyone, she ordered him back to S.T.A.R. Labs. Though he tried to justify what he was doing, using his abilities for good, she mentioned that they had actually agreed to locate and contain meta-humans together. Not being able to get her message across, she had Dr. Wells try to help communicate it. She angrily told Barry that she couldn't fix him every time something broke before walking off. After later fainting, Barry headed to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Caitlin yelled at Barry for keeping it to himself, as he could have suffered from a mini-stroke. They decided to test his vitals while he ran on a modified treadmill. They noted his low glucose levels, but not before he fell off and hit the padding. They hooked him up to 40 IV bags in order to bring him back to normal. When he awoke they explained what they determined to be the problem; he hadn't been eating enough for his massive metabolism.

   Shortly following, Joe appeared through the doors. He began to get angry at Barry for acting as a hero, and Caitlin agreed with his reasoning before Joe left upset. Yet again Barry later returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, having had a run-in with a meta-human who could duplicate himself, who they found to be
   Danton Black
   . From some of the perp's blood on Barry's suit, Caitlin was able to speed up the replicating process, making a clone from cells. The clone came to life, freaking Caitlin out, though Joe had returned, shooting the clone. They figured that Danton Black had activated some clones, thus the clone's movement and Barry suited up to head to Stagg Industries. The team provided support to Barry as per usual, Caitlin suggesting to locate the prime in order to take them all out. Barry ultimately beat Danton, who fell to his death. They soon watched a report about it on the news. Barry assured that the three of them were always with him, and that really all of them had been struck by lightning, not just Barry, at least in the metaphorical sense.

   A while later, Cisco and Caitlin alerted Barry to a man with a gun in a getaway car being chased by cops, who Barry sped to and placed in the cop car within a matter of seconds. The following day, after the Darbinyan crime family were gassed to death by a presumed meta-human, the S.T.A.R. Labs team began researching what they could, all of them excited by the potential prospects. Joe noted that they would have to find somewhere to hold them, as

   was less than ideal, and Cisco suggested the particle accelerator. Not wishing to go down, Barry suggested she tag along with him to identify the poison gas. At the
   CCPD
   , they headed upstairs. On the way, they were joined by Barry's boss,
   Captain Singh
   . Caitlin claimed to be Barry's personal physician. Once they were in the lab waiting for the gas' test results, they discussed Caitlin's late fiancé Ronnie. Once they got the test results, they were intrigued to find two separate tissue samples in it, rather than just one, coming to the conclusion that the meta-human could, in fact, turn into gas himself, hence why his genetic residue was left behind. Barry left to find the meta-human after hearing news on a police radio, leaving Caitlin at the lab. He eventually found the man but inhaled some of the gas. He returned to S.T.A.R. Labs where Caitlin used a needle to painfully extract the gas before it killed him. Once he woke up, Barry apologized for leaving so suddenly, but Caitlin reassured him that it was fine and he had just reminded her of Ronnie.

  <p key="e50d7333-9a8f-4b57-83c9-fa8df8b6448c">
   Barry related the story of his mother's death and offered to go into the core chamber with Caitlin to conquer her fears. While they were there, he promised her that Ronnie was a true hero. They were called back up where they were shown the molecular makeup of the poison gas, hydrogen cyanide mixed with a sedative. Barry recalled that executions used those particular chemicals and Caitlin uncovered
   Kyle Nimbus
   , who would have been executed at the time of the particle accelerator explosion. She further went on to look up who caught him, Detective West, figuring that he was his final target. Caitlin gave him an antidote to the toxin, and Barry sped to
   <a href="Iron Heights Prison.html" key="ca843945-5c8d-4445-af8d-eee94526d859" title="Iron Heights Prison">
    Iron Heights Prison
   </a>
   to protect Joe. The team supported Barry, and once he had lured Nimbus out into the open, Caitlin reminded him not to breathe any gas in (as he'd used the antidote on Joe). Finding it too difficult to outrun him, Caitlin suggested to simply have him continue running at Barry to sap his strength, forcing him to revert to human form. Finally capturing The Mist, as Cisco proudly nicknamed him, they put him in the makeshift particle accelerator prison they'd engineered. Cisco attempted to apologize for the night of Ronnie's death, however, Caitlin admitted that she was okay, as she was even more proud of Ronnie. The two-headed out to the cinemas, followed by ice cream.

   Caitlin played Barry in a game of Operation while Barry was also played a game of Chess with Harrison Wells, and a game of Ping pong with Cisco while Barry was testing his ability to multitask. When Felicity arrived at S.T.A.R. Labs, Caitlin was pleased to see her again though she was worried that she would know too much of their operation. Caitlin was told that she wouldn't need to worry after being told Felicity works with The Arrow. After the cold gun was stolen, Caitlin along with Harrison learned that Cisco built a weapon that was powerful enough to stop Barry, despite his speed. After Barry was struck by the cold gun, Caitlin noted that Barry's nerve cells would've been damaged permanently had they not regenerated at the speed they did. When Cisco told Barry he built the cold gun to stop him, Caitlin defended Cisco that he was only taking precautions and that it was when Barry was still in a coma. Caitlin was later shocked when Felicity managed to track down
   Leonard Snart/Captain Cold
   in a matter of seconds. When Caitlin and Cisco were advised by Felicity to follow Barry and help him, Caitlin reminded Felicity that Barry wanted to be alone. Caitlin was told by Felicity that when someone asks to be alone, that is the best time to help them. Caitlin, along with Cisco and Felicity brought the S.T.A.R. Labs vacuum cleaner, claiming it was the prototype cold gun four times more powerful than the one Leonard had to threaten Snart into backing down.

   Barry took Caitlin and Cisco to a social gathering with Iris and

   , who she expressed an attraction, but Barry told her he couldn't get drunk so she took a sample of his blood in a syringe, which she kept in her bag, but Barry was soon called to a bombing in a building where a man was hanging for his life. Later Barry went to find the bomber Sgt.
   Bette Sans Souci
   but returned moments later without his suit, after Caitlin desperately tried to get back in contact with him over communications, stating that Bette destroyed it causing it to explode with a single touch. Flash managed to bring Bette back to the lab where Caitlin was able to figure out that the dark matter of the particle accelerator merged with a piece of shrapnel where she got her powers, and later observed as Bette tested her powers. Bette told everyone that she was being targeted by her commanding officer Gen.
   Wade Eiling
   and Caitlin tried to find a way to remove her powers but discovered that there was no means of reversing it and though Barry wanted her to stay, become a member of the team, everyone including Caitlin feared she would eventually unintentionally destroy the lab and they needed to avoid being Eiling's enemy.

   , Barry's childhood bully, which Caitlin tended to but noted that 13 bones were broken in his hand alone, in addition to multiple injuries in the rest of his body. She later watched as Barry practiced fighting on a robotic dummy and dislocated his shoulder and Caitlin tried to fix it but when she asked if Barry was visiting Iris as the Flash again, he lied promoting Caitlin to fix his shoulder by brutally snapping it back in place with her hands. Caitlin and Cisco later deduced where Tony was hiding out, but when Barry was seriously wounded Caitlin and Cisco had to go find him themselves and bring him back to the lab. Cisco and Dr. Wells both agreed that Barry could defeat Tony if he hit Woodward at just the right angle at a speed just over Mach 1, which would require a clear shot 5.3 miles away from his target. Caitlin, on the other hand, begged him not to as it would shatter every bone in his body if done wrong. Later Barry engaged Tony again after the latter had kidnapped Iris, and after getting hurt he ran out, only to stop 5.3 miles away from Woodward, turn around and run at a minimum speed of 837 miles per hour, which Caitlin begged him not to do but nerveless he succeeded. Caitlin watched as Barry confronted Tony, face to face, and was amused by Cisco's desire to stop his own childhood nemesis next.

   The team learned of Eobard's plan, to have Barry run fast enough to create a wormhole in which Eobard could return home while Barry could save his mother from Eobard in the first place thus restoring the timeline to order. Caitlin thought the concept was an easy choice until Professor Stein elaborated that Nora's murder had subsequently altered the timeline and changed history, so, therefore, nothing would ever be the same and no one would know because they'd never remember it, meaning Barry may never meet any of them. After tending to Ronnie's wounds from his battle with Reverse-Flash he told her that he and Stein are there to stay for good, and asks if she would like to finally marry him and she said yes. Later the two decided to marry before Barry time-travels in case everything does change and they, with Professor Stein as their rabbi, said their vows and married.

  <p key="d61b5a2d-74ce-4629-82ce-17be1ec3fa05">
   When Eobard was to travel back to the future Barry surprisingly returned and sabotaged his time sphere, forcing Caitlin and Ronnie to manually turn off the generators to close the wormhole before it could grow into a singularity. They succeeded, but, as a result of a paradox from Eddie killing himself to erase Eobard from existence, the wormhole reopened, and the team was helpless to watch it grow and begin consuming everything in Central City before it would eventually consume the world. Flash sped off into the portal to close it
   and managed to stabilize its range but wasn't able to close it. Professor Stein informed Ronnie the only way to destroy it would be for them, as
   Firestorm
   to separate inside it. Caitlin immediately protested but Ronnie professed that they have to try and kissed her farewell, before becoming Firestorm and flying into the singularity as Caitlin watched in tears. Though Firestorm succeeds in destroying the portal Ronnie doesn't survive and is presumed killed inside the singularity, much to Caitlin's devastation.

   Jay reveals he knows the names of everyone present, Caitlin included, and explains that he is from another earth,

  </p>
  <p key="f2650523-803f-4ccf-91b4-aa9d126aa874">
   Caitlin ran these tests and learned that Jay acquired his powers through similar circumstances to Barry, but Caitlin was quite taken to learn he was also a scientist. Caitlin learned that he did have regenerative capabilities but no evidence he has connections to the Speed Force but also ran a polygraph on him without his knowledge which came back positive. Caitlin ran further tests on him on the treadmill where she seemed to have developed an attraction to Jay, though she quickly denied it when Iris implied that Caitlin had feelings for Jay. This is further implied when Jay reveals moments later that Caitlin ran a full body scan on him at her request, and she claims she was "being thorough".

After defeating Sand-Demon Caitlin tended to Jay's wounds and he complimented her skills and as he reflected on the loss of his powers, she also told him she'd lost something precious to her too (Ronnie) but eventually learned to live with it and they exchanged smiles. After Professor Stein confirmed the presence of multiple ruptures in the city, 52 exactly, he collapsed and Caitlin tended to him.

   Seeking to use Turtle's powers to stop Zoom, Caitlin and Jay went to check on him but discovered him dead in his cell. Jay was quick to blame Harry but he denied it though Caitlin, like Jay, was unconvinced. After discovering Jay's declining health Caitlin theorizes that a fresh infusion of healthy cells could fix Jay's blood, by finding his Earth-1 doppelgänger. Caitlin asked for Barry's help but he was unable to find any Jay Garrick on Earth-1. Caitlin decided to ask Jay himself but after telling him he didn't have an Earth-1 double Jay claimed there was a good reason and asked her to meet him at
   Hofherr Park
   , where she'll see for herself.
  </p>
  <p key="6c9df531-7349-45ef-9785-c820bdfcccf3">
   Later, when Caitlin and Jay sat down at the park Jay revealed he too tried to find his Earth-1 double but with no success, at least at first. After some time, however, he eventually did find his doppelgänger and pointed him out on a bench across the park,
   Hunter Zolomon
   . Caitlin questioned why Hunter had a different name to Jay and he told her his mother died in childbirth, and after bouncing around different families was adopted by the Zolomons. However, Jay told Caitlin that his cells were mutated when he became a speedster and that Hunter's cells were no longer compatible with his as a result.

   While Cisco was using his powers trying to locate Zoom he discovered that Reverse-Flash was still alive and invading Mercury Labs. However, when Barry returned from his encounter with the speedster he stated Eobard didn't know his name or that they've fought before. Harry theorized correctly that this version of Eobard is a younger version of the man they knew, one who has not yet traveled back to kill Nora and is meeting Barry for the first time. When Barry captured Eobard but wasn't allowed to talk to him because he would alter the timeline, Caitlin tried to reassure him to take comfort in the fact that he caught him. Barry, however, wasn't satisfied. When Cisco started seizing Caitlin stabilized him but he started fading out of existence to which Harry surmised was a result of Eobard's capture, rupturing the timeline, and Barry was forced to send him back.

   When Barry, Cisco, and Harry went to Earth-2 to rescue Jesse, the Speed Cannon malfunctioned and Jay timely saved her from being crushed under one of its rings when it fell apart. As Caitlin and Jay tried to repair it Joe told them of a meta-human
   Adam Fells/Geomancer
   , attacking the city looking to challenge Barry.
   Though they didn't have Barry Joe pointed out that Jay got his speed back with Velocity-6 long enough to save Harry, but Jay refused to take it. Caitlin confronted Jay on his hesitance and he admitted that he had taken the Velocity serum prior to Caitlin perfecting it, out of selfishness for wanting to increase his speed. Caitlin then quickly realized that taking the Velocity serum was the true cause of Jay losing his speed, not Zoom, and Jay admitted he'd made so many mistakes and wasn't worthy of Caitlin's love.
  </p>
  <p key="7263de6f-019e-44b6-ac22-c20f7308b537">
   However, Caitlin reassured Jay she'd figure out a way to restore his speed and save him and worked on perfecting the formula, and created Velocity-7. After doing so Flash went out to stop Geomancer but during their fight, the Velocity-7 wore off, and Flash was almost killed by Geomancer but Joe was able to save him. As Caitlin tended to Jay's wounds she promised that Velocity-8 would be better, but expressed worry that Barry, Cisco, and Harry wouldn't make it back in time.

  <p key="29ba7b14-45a8-4455-8b86-f0ae95aa81d8">
   While working on Velocity-9, Caitlin discovered a flaw in its cellular matrix and visited a friend at Mercury Labs,
   Eliza Harmon
   , who helped her finish the formula, though Caitlin was careful and only gave her specific aspects so the formula couldn't be replicated in case Eliza's research was compromised.
   After this Caitlin was finally able to perfect the formula to Velocity-9 just in time for Geomancer to cause an earthquake that, destroyed a hospital. Before it collapsed Caitlin was forced to give Jay toe formula before testing it and Flash was able to save the people inside before it collapsed. After returning Caitlin and Iris stood in awe of Jay's achievement and Caitlin was happy to see she succeeded, and also discovered that Velocity-9's effects had begun to fix Jay's cells. As Caitlin called Jay to inform him of this however she and Iris were confronted by Geomancer in S.T.A.R. Labs and attacked them.

   However, Caitlin was able to save Iris by using the B.O.O.T. on Geomancer, and Joe ensured Fells was arrested. When Jay did return she informed him of the Velocity-9's effects on his cells and Jay was speechless, unable to express gratitude in words so Caitlin kissed him instead. Almost immediately, however, they discovered the Speed Cannon was damaged in Geomancer's attack, but Flash and Joe were able to stabilize it. After Barry, Cisco, Harry, and Jesse returned Jay closed the last breach but before it closed for good, Zoom appeared and stabbed his arm through Jay's chest killing him and pulled him back through the portal, right in front of Caitlin. Moments after Caitlin was shell-shocked and started repeatedly saying "he's not dead" much to everyone's concern until Cisco helped her and she tried to sleep it off.

However, Caitlin stated that if she let herself feel the grief of losing Jay she'll never recover and she can't and insisted they get back to finding King Shark. After King Shark was captured Caitlin pranked Cisco by pretending to be Killer Frost which terrified Cisco until Caitlin started laughing. Caitlin then reassured Cisco that she may be depressed but she'll never be like Killer Frost, and watched as Barry revealed the display for Jay's helmet and vowed to find a way back to Earth-Two to beat Zoom.

   While enjoying a night out at a club, Caitlin and Cisco danced while Barry, Iris, Wally, and Jesse had some drinks. Suddenly, the club was attacked by another speedster,
   Trajectory
   , who committed a robbery spree. Caitlin suspected the speedster was using Velocity-9 and told Barry about it. However, Barry was furious to learn Caitlin had the means of increase his speed the whole time, but Harry defended her as Jay had previously stated how dangerous the drug was. After Barry fought Trajectory, Caitlin suspected she may be Eliza. When she and Joe questioned her about the serum Caitlin gave her, Eliza claimed to have destroyed it after helping her, which seemingly checked out. Later at S.T.A.R. Labs, the team was attacked by Trajectory, who locked Flash in the pipeline and knocked out Joe.
  </p>
  <p key="72da9aa1-b4b8-43c1-ac0e-0a985a805cbe">
   Trajectory revealed she was indeed Eliza, demanding more Velocity-9, ignoring Caitlin's warnings that the drug would kill her and threatening to harm Jesse. After getting more Velocity-9 Trajectory injected Jesse with a dose and escaped. Caitlin saved Jesse by giving her a transfusion of Harry's blood. After Trajectory killed herself by accidentally overdosing on Velocity-9, Barry revealed that before she evaporated her lightning turned blue, just like Zoom's. With this knowledge, Harry deduced that Zoom is dying and needs a cure which is why he wants Barry's speed, and Barry pointed out that Jay too was dying. Caitlin immediately denied the possibility that Jay was Zoom but Barry had Cisco vibe Jay's helmet, and he confirmed the revelation, much to Caitlin's shock.

   After Barry and Harry created the tachyon enhancer based on Eobard's information, Barry was able to run four times faster, faster than Zoom, and realized he could take him down now. After Cisco figured out how to open breaches Barry prepared to fight him, telling Caitlin she doesn't need to partake if she doesn't want to. Caitlin, however, stood firm that she needed to help them stop Jay, whatever his real name is. When Barry questioned what she meant she revealed that Jay's doppelgänger's name was Hunter Zolomon but Harry was astounded, as Hunter Zolomon on Earth-2 is a serial killer, convicted on 23 counts of murder. After showing a newspaper of him the team realized that Jay was actually Hunter but Barry used this information to their advantage to set a trap for him. Barry successfully lured Zoom into their trap, using cutouts of the Earth-1 versions of his parents to catch him off guard, but he still escaped and abducted Wally.
  </p>
  <p key="4f1bd763-25a9-45ad-8d6c-a83bc9b4fdc6">
   After agreeing to Zoom's deal to release Wally in exchange for his speed Zoom brought Wally back and unmasked in front of them, revealing his true self for the first time. While Harry prepared the device to drain Barry's speed the team questioned how Hunter was still alive, as he'd died and he revealed he'd brought a younger version of himself to the present to act as his decoy, ultimately to sacrifice him to motivate Barry into becoming faster. He also admitted he'd posed as The Flash to give people hope only to take it away from them, and Caitlin openly called him a monster. After Hunter successfully drained Barry of his speed he tried to kill him but Caitlin begged him, asking if he ever truly did care for her if he has any humanity left to let Barry goes. Reluctantly, Hunter did so, but seeing Caitlin as a weakness he couldn't let go, Hunter abducted Caitlin and took her back to
   his lair
   to Earth-Two.

  <p key="ab270fe3-a518-4166-a56e-ed7d46b0ecf8">
   While imprisoned in his lair Hunter acknowledged that Caitlin was mad at him for lying to her but told her that he loved her, much to her terror, and allowed her to roam free knowing she couldn't escape and tended to other business. While venturing she discovers a
   man in an iron mask
   using tap code against his cell, but Caitlin couldn't understand. Caitlin was then distracted by her doppelganger Killer Frost who was imprisoned in the opposite cell. Frost immediately mocked Caitlin's choice of clothing and didn't know who the iron mask was either, nor did she know why Zoom had imprisoned her. However, Frost made a deal with Caitlin that if she got her out of her cell she'd get her back to Earth-1. While working on a means to break the carbine in the cell the Caitlins talked about their very different upbringings but found common ground in their shared dislike for their mothers.

   However, Caitlin Two revealed her mother was a frigid narcissist because her brother Charlie died, though Caitlin One never had a brother nor did she know why her mother was cold. After freeing Frost she immediately betrayed her and tried to kill her revealing the only reason she's still alive, is because she looks just like her, the woman Zoom loves and therefore wouldn't need her anymore. However, before Frost could kill her Zoom returned and phased through Caitlin, literally, to grab the icicle Frost made and stabbed her with it, horrifying Caitlin and leaving Frost to bleed out. Hunter then threatened to kill his masked prisoner if she tried to escape again. Later Caitlin tearfully pleaded with Hunter to let her go and Hunter agreed, as he sought to conquer

   's mirror trap. However, she later noticed while taking a shower that some of her hair turned pale blonde; she promptly cut off the altered hair to hide her powers.
   Desperate to understand what was happening to her, Caitlin visited her mother but was quickly annoyed when she asked if Caitlin had received her birthday card which she confirmed, in April, presumably a significant amount of time before or after it. Caitlin inquired how to get an appointment with her for a friend, not ready to reveal her secret, but as Carla coldly walked her through the procedures Caitlin angrily froze her desk and revealed she was the patient. Carla subsequently canceled all her appointments for the day and readied various tests for Caitlin. While preparing she met Carla's assistant
   Nigel

   Caitlin was brought down to the facility's testing lab for molecular motion where she revealed a shaft made of solid tungsten, heated to over 2000 degrees centigrade. Carla asked Caitlin to freeze it in order to determine how to reverse what's happening to her. To her horror, she froze it solidly within seconds. After Caitlin revealed the origin of her powers, she and Carla fought over Caitlin working at S.T.A.R. Labs rather than Tannhauser Industries, which Caitlin reminded her was because she desired to make a name for herself. Before they could argue further Nigel came back with the results and revealed that Caitlin had not just frozen the tungsten but had absorbed all the energy it was emitting.

   However, Caitlin was frustrated when she heard them talking about how her power could benefit their pursuits rather than offer sympathies. When Carla began taking blood samples Caitlin, finally having had enough, confronted her over the seemingly lack of care for her well-being and how she hasn't expressed any concern over her well being since her father died. Carla defended that she tried to save him and reminded Caitlin that she ran away but Caitlin told Carla that she had to because she wouldn't even so much as look at her. Carla accepted Caitlin's anguish and admitted that she got consumed in her work out of grief but scolded Caitlin, believing she didn't know what that kind of loss feels like. Outraged, Caitlin told Carla about Ronnie, who Carla didn't even seem to be aware of.

   Having had enough, Caitlin decided to leave but Nigel trapped her in the facility wanting to exploit her powers for himself. As he grabbed her Caitlin's inner Killer Frost persona was released in a fit of pure rage and she grabbed Nigel and froze his arm solid. Carla came in to confront her, and Killer Frost ordered her mother to move, but Carla offered her apologizes, acknowledging that she wasn't much of a mother, but was steadfast that she didn't raise a killer, managing to talk her out of killing Nigel as mother and daughter hugged. Caitlin returned to help Team Flash stop the supposed monster roaming the city, only for it to be a hologram.

   Caitlin later told Cisco about visiting her mother and he commended her for trying to make amends with her family. Later Carla contacted Caitlin via webcam and told her that her results proved unfruitful; that Caitlin's biology was rapidly changing and the more she used her powers the less control she'd have. After hearing this, Killer Frost's anger emerged again, as Caitlin has accidentally frozen her computer, horrified to see that she was losing control over her emotions along with her growing meta-human powers.
   Worried of her powers, Caitlin stole power dampeners from S.T.A.R. Labs, something that Cisco thought to blame on

Upon waking up in the Pipeline, Killer Frost attempted to convince Team Flash she was back to normal, to no avail. She then made an offer of leaving them alone, if they release her and allow her to go on her way. But Barry refused to abandon her, angering Frost.

   Barry returned, asking for Caitlin's help with a freed Wally West, who couldn't maintain control over his powers. Killer Frost taunted Barry, who released her on one condition: if she wanted to leave, she had to kill him. Killer Frost threatened to do so, producing an icicle but was unable to kill her friend. Crying, Caitlin finally snapped out of her anger and she hugged him, horrified at her actions. Barry comforted her and she went back with him, assisting the team in returning Wally to normal (albeit now with Super-Speed). Barry later had to make a tough choice, after Julian Albert gave him two alternatives: quit his job at Central City Police Department as a CSI agent, or he would talk to the detective outside the room. Barry decided to make a big sacrifice and quit his job to save Caitlin from a life in prison.

There, he told Joe that if he let him escape from Gypsy, he promised to reveal Savitar's name so the team could save Iris. Joe agreed and set him free, but Kadabra betrayed him, claiming that the terms of the agreement had changed. He then went to collect a mysterious future power source from the Time Vault and set off an explosive as the trio attempted to chase after him upon his escape.

Iris told the team that Caitlin couldn't operate on herself but Caitlin said she could if she had a mirror, she could talk someone through the surgery.

Julian told her it was going to hurt as he pulled the metal out, Caitlin screamed in severe pain before becoming light-headed and telling Julian to stitch her up as she was going to pass out. Not too long after she woke up in the med bay bed with Julian holding her hand. Julian told her how brave he thought she was before getting up to kiss her, but pausing out of fear of hurting her.

Julian, distraught, ripped off Caitlin's necklace, hoping her meta-human powers could regenerate her. About 30 seconds later, she began breathing again.

Savitar questioned Frost's loyalty by pondering the idea that there may be more Caitlin Snow still within her than she led him to believe, especially due to the fact that despite taking up the name Killer Frost she had not yet actually killed anyone. He then told her to once again try to kill Tracy with the promise that if she succeeded they could both be gods.

At the site of the trade-off, she battled both Barry and Cisco before being overcome by Cisco's powers and knocked unconscious. Cisco then acquired a blood sample from her that Julian hoped could be key, due to Caitlin undergoing a full mutation into Killer Frost, to reversing the process and cure their friend. Before the team could return to S.T.A.R. Labs, to presumably lock Frost away in the Pipeline for their and her own safety, Savitar appeared and escaped with the still unconscious Killer Frost.

Cisco encouraged her to remember being Caitlin Snow, which allowed her to help restore Barry's memory in surgery. She prepared to leave, with Julian confessing that he had fallen in love with her. This news briefly shocked Killer Frost, who coldly told Julian that she never loved him, then saying that went for the entire team. When in the elevator, her eyes briefly returned to normal, showing that Killer Frost could be turned back into Caitlin.

Right before Frost could finish off Cisco, Savitar appeared and stated she should keep him alive, as he needs him to modify the Speed Force Weapon.

Iris then asks Cisco, who storms off after thinking about Gypsy, Caitin then goes to talk to him. After trying to calm him down, Gypsy jumps into his lab through a breach and explains that she is fine with him canceling their date but Cisco remembers everything Caitlin told him and says that when a woman says it's fine, it's not actually fine causing Caitlin to get excited and shout "Amen!". Getting stares from both Cisco and Gypsy, she leaves the room, embarrassed. Later, the team go to the cortex and see a broadcast of Kwan explaining that he and his friends stole the Killg%re project from Deacon. Before Barry goes to defeat Deacon, Caitlin gives him the serum her and Cisco created in order to beat him. After getting his suit hacked and almost being killed, Barry is able to defeat Deacon and he gets incarcerated in Iron Heights.

After the game, they sat and had lunch just before the breach alert went off and they rushed back to S.T.A.R. Labs. When they reach the building, they find Wally and Harry in the breach room. Harry gives Wally a
   break-up cube
   with a message inside from Jesse who wanted to break up him after becoming so busy on Earth-2. After this an alarm goes off, signaling a problem a bank in the city. Before they leave Caitlin angrily tells Harry that they're not done. After Barry fails to stop the newest meta-human threat,
   Becky Sharpe
   , Cisco, Caitlin, Harry, and Barry all watch the footage in the cortex until Joe and Iris walk in and are able to identify Becky. They come to the conclusion that she is a meta-human with the ability to manipulate luck but don't know how she could have powers since she wasn't in Central City when the particle accelerator exploded. They all begin working in their respective jobs to understand where she obtained her powers.

   Later, Barry, Cisco, and Harry come back from looking where Becky got her powers and reveal that Barry coming out of the speed force caused people to become meta-humans. When looking for a plan, Cisco and Harry start to fight and Caitlin attempts to calm Cisco down but he simply states that they don't need him to beat Becky. Barry later tried to talk to her face to face but to no avail as she just caused more people to almost getting hurt. He then returned to S.T.A.R. Labs and attempted to come up with a plan with Cisco, Caitlin, Wally, and Joe where Cisco ends up naming Becky "Hazard". The rest of the team felt like they had been jinxed and Barry had to talk some sense into them until he gets a call from Iris and leaves. When an alarm sounded in the cortex, everyone ran in and Caitlin explained that there were events caused by bad luck all over the city, which meant that Becky's field of bad luck was growing, they all come to the conclusion that the more good luck she experiences the more her field would grow and the more people suffer. To make matters worse, Becky's field caused the particle accelerator to turn back on. Luckily, Becky ends up suffering bad luck when she didn't win in a casino which caused her field to shrink and Barry managed to get the power-dampening cuffs on her, meanwhile, Cisco and Harry were able to deactivate the accelerator. After everything calmed down, the team managed to figure out that when Barry came out of the speed force, he affected everyone on
   Central City Bus 405
   and gave them all meta-human abilities. After this, Wally also ends up leaving the team due to his break up with Jesse. Caitlin gives him a hug and tells him "good luck".

   After roaming the corridors of S.T.A.R. Labs, Caitlin comes across
   Breacher

As Barry leaves, Caitlin and Iris comment on Ralph's handsomeness, comparing him to Oliver Queen. After Joe and Barry pay Dibny a visit, they discover that he is indeed a meta-human from the bus and take him back to S.T.A.R. Labs. When Ralph gets there, his legs are stretched out so far that his foot is in the hallway, and as Barry and Caitlin attempt to calm him down, Iris runs in screaming in terror. While attempting to figure out how his powers work, both Harry and Caitlin refer to him as "Silly putty", visibly upsetting him. They all then get into a fight that Caitlin quickly stops when she explains that she needs a sample of Ralph's blood and his arm elasticates, tripping her and making her accidentally throw powder in Ralph's face, causing him to sneeze and his face to fall into his hands, causing Joe to puke.

   After calming Ralph down, the team returns to the cortex, and Iris asks Caitlin if there is anything she could do to help Ralph. She then explains that she would need a DNA sample of Ralph's before he was exposed to dark matter. However, Barry asks why she would help him considering he was a corrupt cop and is still a bad man, and Caitlin explained that she took an oath and had to help him. When he refuses to consider that Ralph has changed, Caitlin brings up past events of her becoming Killer Frost. Barry then reluctantly goes to Ralph's office in order to find a sample. He later returns with Ralph's hairbrush, having narrowly escaped a bomb someone had planted in the office. When Barry begins to make remarks about Caitlin becoming buddies with Ralph she explodes with rage on Barry and explains that she understands what it's like to wake up one day with strange powers, which causes Iris to look at them and realize they are arguing like they are a married couple. The two are then interrupted by Joe entering the room but still shoot each other angry glares. Later, Caitlin manages to complete a serum that would help return Ralph to normal and gives it to him. When he drinks it, his limbs return to normal and she explains that he can be any shape he wants to be. He then reaches down to his stomach and reduces his fat into abs.

   After receiving the message from Amunet, Caitlin books a flight in order to get out of Central City. Just as she is confirming it on her computer, Iris and Felicity walk in and push Caitlin into attending Iris's bachelorette party. She ultimately agrees but worries that Amunet may find her. Caitlin, Iris, Felicity and Cecile attend the party at a fancy restaurant and Iris notices that Caitlin is drinking excessively. When she looks to the entrance, she witnesses Norvok enter and walk to the girls' table. He asks her to come with him and Felicity mistakens him for a male stripper and when she asks him to take his pants off, he takes out his eye instead. Caitlin flips the table and Iris and Felicity begin attacking Norvok but are ultimately thrown to the ground. When he looks to Caitlin, Killer Frost takes control and the girls are shocked as they watch Caitlin's transformation. Frost then shoots a beam of ice at Norvok, knocking him out of a window and remarking "Ugh! I hate pink" then taking a big sip of the champagne. The three return to S.T.A.R. Labs and Killer Frost retrieves her suit that was stashed hidden from everyone. She then leaves the three other women at the lab and travels to Amunet's nightclub to confront her.

   Once she arrives, Amunet is pleased to see her and shows her
   a meta-human
   that she has been keeping hostage in order to harvest his powers and sell them as a drug. She then proposes that she and Frost work together to take over the city and become Gods, however, Frost denies this offer and Amunet grows angry and begins to use her powers to slowly raise her metal in a bag beside her. Just as Frost raises her hand, ready to shoot an ice beam, Iris interrupts the two of them and compliments Amunet on her club and then asks Frost to come with her to get out of the club. After considering it, Frost complies and follows Iris out. When they return to the lab, Frost begins to get her things together and tells the girls about Amunet and her history with Caitlin. Just as she is about to leave, Iris manages to convince Frost to stay and fight Amunet instead of run from her. She leaves the lab and meets her under a bridge somewhere in the city and the two begin to fight. Killer Frost shoots at her with two ice beams but Amunet creates a metal shield that deflects both and then launches a large piece of metal into Frost's shoulder. Amunet then picks her up and begins to punch her several times, causing Frost to retreat back into Caitlin's mind and letting Caitlin take all the punches. Two officers pull up next to the scene, which distracts Amunet long enough for Caitlin to escape.

   Back in the lab, Caitlin, now back in control, treats her own wounds and is finishing up as Iris walks in to check up on her. She helps Caitlin finish the last stitch on her shoulder and she asks Iris if Killer Frost had hurt anybody. When Iris explained that she didn't, Caitlin regretted coming back to the team and told Iris that she didn't consider her a real friend, only a "work friend" later stating as Killer frost "if you still wanna have a hand for Barry to put a ring on, I suggest you move it". Later, the girls get a location on Amunet and go to confront without Caitlin. However, the plan goes south and she catches Felicity and Iris but before she can kill them Caitlin enters and tries to make a deal with Amunet in exchange for her friend's lives. Her men then point their guns at Caitlin but she screams and sends an ice blast from her mouth at them, knocking them all down and bringing out Killer Frost. The girls get behind her and she creates an igloo around them to take over from Amunet's metal shards. They get the idea to use a magnet to stop Amunet using her powers and Frost explodes her igloo, knocking out all of Amunet's men. As Amunet gets ready to shoot her shards at the three women, Cecile turns the giant magnet on which attracts all of Amunet's shards. Killer Frost then forms an icicle in her hands and prepares to stab her before Iris foolishly stops her and tells her she can choose to be a hero. This gets through to Frost and she drops the icicle but Amunet promises to get her back and escapes, all thanks to Iris. Back at the lab, the boys return from the bachelor party and see Killer Frost standing in the cortex. She transforms back into Caitlin and explains everything about Frost. Later, Caitlin and Iris leave together and Iris asks her to be her maid of honor, which she accepts.

   Sharon Finkel

   a woman
   wearing a yellow jacket with a bison on the back. A crime scene later showed up and Barry found blood on a statue, causing him to think that the statue may have came to life and so he brought a piece of it to Caitlin. She explains that the statue was flooded with dark matter and it was most likely a bus-meta.

However, Barry is still convinced that Clifford was the criminal mastermind behind the bus metas, even getting Cisco to vibe his mug but only seeing that he was having dinner with his wife. While the team were sitting in the cortex, Barry walks in and shows them that the samuroid head had a camera in it and is convinced that it is DeVoe watching them. However, they find out he broke into the DeVoe house and believe that Barry has become obsessed with him. Later, Barry reveals that DeVoe knows he's The Flash and that he was right about DeVoe being evil, convincing the team that he needed to be stopped. Cisco even comes up with the name "The Thinker".

He explained that she had to work on the holidays and couldn't make it to Earth-1. When Ralph entered, he mentioned an inside joke he had with Cisco, Harry and Killer Frost, leading Caitlin to believe that her friends would much rather hang out with Frost than with her. She then left to get a coffee at Jitters. At Jitters, Caitlin had a Killer Frost drink as Harry approached her. He told her that even though Ralph may have said that Frost was more fun than Caitlin, Harry thought that she was special and that her friends would much rather hang out with her than Frost.

Amunet then revealed that she was once a stewardess, who was constantly hit on by perverted pilots until she obtained her powers and made them pay.

However, it was then revealed that Caitlin and Dominic had devised a plan to escape and managed to lace the ventilation with anaesthetic, knocking out Amunet and her men. The two ran out of the hospital but Amunet managed to catch up to them, almost stabbing them both in the back of their heads. They were almost shot again until Ralph and Cisco arrived and stopped the shards from hitting them, Cisco knocking back Amunet with a vibe blast. The four then escaped through a breach created by Cisco. The next day at S.T.A.R. Labs, the team discuss where DeVoe could be and that he could've potentially drowned after being thrown into water by Barry. That night, they have their annual Christmas party at the West house with even Dominic showing up. However, it is revealed to only Barry that Dominic was actually captured by Amunet and sold to the DeVoes, who killed him and allowed DeVoe to stab his own body and take over Dominic's. DeVoe's body is later left at Barry and Iris' apartment with a knife in his chest, framing Barry for his murder and getting him arrested by the CCPD.

   After Barry was questioned by the CCPD, he was placed on house arrest but was able to attend a meeting in the cortex by Cisco hacking into his ankle monitor. After discussing DeVoe's plan, Barry agreed to go to Iron Heights if he was convicted, not wanting to become a fugitive. The whole team attended Barry's trial at the courthouse and after the lawyer mentioned the knife that was used to stab DeVoe, Caitlin noticed Iris was visibly upset and grabbed her hand. However, Joe got a message about a meta-human attack in the city, forcing him, Caitlin and Cisco to leave Iris with Barry in the courtroom. After studying the medical records of the victims that passed out at
   Central City Bank
   at the hospital, Caitlin entered the cortex and explained everything to Cisco and Harry. She told them that they had all suffered from radiation poisoning and that they needed to find the meta-human before he poisoned the whole city or even worse, became a nuclear bomb. Cisco even nicknamed the meta "
   Fallout
   ".

   Later, Cisco and Harry managed to get a location on Fallout and the two went to try and apprehend him while Caitlin stayed and monitored them from the cortex. However, this only turned out to be a waste disposal truck. They finally managed to get a correct location on Fallout and called Barry, forcing him to postpone his conviction. Harry and Cisco then concluded that they needed Killer Frost in order to cool Fallout down and stop the nuclear explosion. At first, Caitlin can't transform because she needed to be scared or angry but after Cisco began listing things that would be destroyed if she didn't fight, Frost finally emerged. After jumping through a breach, Cisco and Killer Frost reached the location and Frost immediately froze Fallout with an ice blast. However, he managed to thaw his way out and shot a beam of radiation at her, sending her flying through a bus sop and knocking her unconscious. Barry and Cisco eventually managed to defeat Fallout and he was incarcerated at A.R.G.U.S.. However, Barry is later convicted and sent to Iron Heights.

The personality wanted to use a serum, that Caitlin reluctantly created, to kill off Thomas for good and inhabit the body himself. Just as he was about to inject himself, Caitlin managed to break through the mental block that DeVoe had created, allowing Killer Frost to emerge and shoot him back with an ice blast. He quickly attempted to convince Frost to take the serum as well and work with him but she refused, stating that Team Flash was her true family. As she walked towards him, she stood on and destroyed the serum. She created an ice-fist and began to punch him but stopped as Thomas' personality emerged and spoke to Caitlin. This turned out to be a short reunion as the evil personality reemerged and shot her back with an ice blast, proceeding to use two ice blasts to launch himself into the air and escape. Later, Caitlin discovered that she could use the cerebral inhibitor to speak to Frost through the mental block and the two began to catch each other up.

     Caitlin is very intelligent and passionate about her work as a bio-engineer and scientist, occasionally becoming excited at the possibility of observing supernatural biology in

     . She is generally a very compassionate and caring woman and is determined to help others through her work. Caitlin loved her fiancé
     Ronnie Raymond
     very much, stating that he knew how to make her laugh. She and was devastated by his apparent death, which sent her into a state of depression for almost a year. As a result of this she, didn't smile much. However, since being brought onto the team, working with
     <a href="Barry Allen (Earth-1).html" key="57ca8089-963b-4b19-8360-747708680a1f" title="Barry Allen (Earth-1)">

     </a>
     , helping people and saving lives, she has started to liven back up. She has shown great concern for Barry as she often advises against engaging meta-humans they know little about and was initially against Barry using his powers as a guardian angel for
      Central City
      , though she eventually grew to accept and even participate in it.
    </p>
    <p key="25561297-7f38-46da-9680-6d908a3858f9">
     Caitlin is also seen to be somewhat "guarded", in her own words, and timid as seen when she was terrified of going into the
      S.T.A.R. Labs
      particle accelerator
      it being the location of Ronnie's supposed death, though she later overcame this obstacle with Barry's support, becoming more assertive, brave and confident. Despite them being quite different in personality, she is also close friends with

     </a>
     agrees with. When Caitlin was reunited with Ronnie, alive and well after he was separated from
      Martin Stein
      , she was overjoyed, no traits of her initial depressive, forlorn personality remaining. When she finally marries Ronnie, she is perfectly content accepting that everything she's experienced over the past year, leading up to wedding the man she loves has been worth it. When Caitlin loses Ronnie again, this time for real, Caitlin is devastated, so much she is unable to stay in S.T.A.R. Labs as she blames herself for his death. However she has slowly managed to recover and regained her desire to help Team Flash.

    <p key="1338b285-3bd8-4940-9ea3-ea0f6453b967">
     Though not as prominent as her other traits, Caitlin has a somewhat flirtatious side to her personality. Often when flustered or uninhibited by the effects of alcohol she can become silly, frazzled, and hinted a few times during her night out at the dive bar with Barry that she dropped many hints that she was interested in Barry. After meeting
     <a href="Hunter Zolomon.html" key="d59d1c92-fe8a-4fde-b973-216051459c26" title="Hunter Zolomon">
      Hunter Zolomon
     </a>
     , masquerading under the name "Jay Garrick", he and Caitlin have quickly become infatuated with each other, their infatuation developing into a relationship. Caitlin's love for Hunter was the driving force for her to find a cure for his condition. However, after the revelation of "Jay Garrick" as the man behind the mask of Zoom, Caitlin did not allow her feelings to cloud her judgment on Zoom's misdeeds, rightfully recognizing him as "nothing but a monster" and refusing to accept Hunter's lingering affection for her. Nevertheless, Caitlin called upon those feelings, her face in tears, when she tried to influence Hunter to show his merciful side, sparing Barry Allen from certain death.
    </p>
    <p key="618e8fa4-beb8-4c64-b559-6e982f676671">
     Caitlin is shown to be extremely Naive when it comes to men (with a pretty face, huge muscles and shining teeth) and trust. Like when Barry refused to trust Jay Garrick (a stranger from another Earth that they know very little of), Team Flash (especially Caitlin) quickly did. And that resulted not only Team Flash being betrayed again, but also resulted Barry's father getting murdered in the same place, in the same way. Then when Ralph Dibny's name popped up as one of the metas on the bus, she was showing sympathy toward him despite the fact that even though he didn't deserve it, Caitlin doesn't know Ralph like Barry does and she hasn't even meet him.
    </p>
    <p key="e0c929a5-769c-4ccb-9e45-6e55e3c798b5">
     After her imprisonment with Hunter, it seems that Caitlin began suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to her former lover and his frightening behavior and repeated displays of violence in front of her, seeing visions of Zoom when he's not there, and questioning if she still has her sanity.
    </p>
    Since Caitlin has been developing cryokinetic abilities like her Earth-2 counterpart she has been terrified of becoming just like her. While reluctant to tell her friends she has used these powers to aid them occasionally without them knowing, but has gradually realized her inability to control them. This has made Caitlin very terrified but as a result of her changing biology she has become increasingly temperamental, which causes her appearance to become more like her Earth-2 counterpart. However, Caitlin is still sane enough to realize this but is only more horrified at her increasingly inability to manage her emotions. However, her desire to retain her humanity and her biology changing to make her more "cold", seems to be causing Caitlin to develop dissociative identity disorder.

     Worrying about her new-found, uncontrolled powers, Caitlin's emotions become heightened enough that she became a vindictive, angry and cruel individual, similar, but not identical to
     Frankie Kane
     's split personality disorder. Also like Frankie, when affected by her powers, her eyes glow pale blue (while Frankie's glow pink). However, while Magenta tried to get rid of the Frankie persona altogether, Killer Frost state amplifies Caitlin's own fears, insecurities and bitterness. As Killer Frost, she mocked Barry by mentioning his most horrible failures including the deaths of his mother, father, Eddie and Ronnie, as well as revealing to Cisco that his brother,
      Dante
      was alive in the pre-Flashpoint timeline, before Barry changed it. She expressed bitterness over Barry only caring about himself and his own happy ending, while she was left broken.
    </p>
    <p key="d7bf0858-9cb0-4827-88a5-4e1454dc4a1d">
     Caitlin also mocked Cisco by calling him pathetic for feeling sorry that he had to hurt her to save Barry. She openly blamed Barry for what's happened to her, yet admitted that she feels broken. She nearly killed

    <p key="46026c8d-584a-4afc-a5f8-4e4d76c6a3df">
     Once Killer Frost was fully awakened due to Caitlin's temporary death and revival, she states that she doesn't want to be cured and wants Caitlin never to come back. She allies herself with Savitar after he reveals himself to her.

    <p key="adc08536-2ece-41cf-a485-25ffadddcd1c">
     Killer Frost went after
     Tracy Brand
     after Savitar promised that if she lives up to her name and murders Tracy, she could be a god. She arrived at CCU in her new outfit and attacked Barry and Cisco, but when Barry fought back with fire, she ran away. She then attacked Tracy for the second time outside Jitters and continuously formed an ice slide that she slid on for a while without any difficulty. She took advantage of the fact that Cisco would not hurt her and almost hit him with a blast that Barry took. She stabbed Barry in the leg so that he couldn't follow her and she left, claiming that this is her now.
    </p>
    <p key="bba51c12-1638-411a-9cdb-fbac30e1979b">
     Later, Killer Frost kidnapped Joe's girlfriend

     outside of Joe's home and threatened to kill her if Joe and the team did not hand over Tracy to her and Savitar. Later at the supposed exchange site, she claimed that killing Cecile would bring her no joy but Tracy's death at her hands would. When Barry tried to talk her out of it, she knew exactly what Barry was going to say. She and Cisco later faced off, and while she seemed calm at first, she later fought back as hard as she can and lost to him. Cisco managed to get a sample of her blood, which could be the key to making a cure for her. Before Cisco can take her, Savitar arrived and took her away.

    <p key="48824bad-8615-459c-8b1d-c7fa976df1b9">
     Despite all this, while reluctantly working alongside her former allies, it was shown she still has a strong attachment to her memories of working at S.T.A.R. Labs when she and Cisco reminisced about Ronnie losing his temper back when they were trying to build the particle accelerator. However. Killer Frost also showed in this moment that thinking about who she used to be made her uncomfortable as she quickly, sullenly, stated that she didn't want to stay any longer than she had to. Her conflicted feelings about herself and her old allies was again emphasized when she told Team Flash she never loved them and left, only for the assertion to hurt her heart enough to cause the real Caitlin to emerge for a few seconds once she was out of the team's sight.

During the final confrontation of Team Flash and Savitar, Cisco's unceasing loyalty for Caitlin finally enabled Caitlin's true-self to become permanently restored and reconciled with her friends. At the same time, she felt lost, unsure of who she is now.

    , Caitlin began to realize that she could co-exist with Killer Frost and started treating her alter-ego as a friend and teammate rather than an adversary. Though their relationship was slightly tenuous at first, Caitlin began to develop better control over her powers and accept her alter-ego as a part of her. To which, Caitlin was devastated when her powers were apparently taken away by
     Clifford DeVoe
     and determined to find a way to restore Killer Frost.

       childhood bully
       and cut her hand with a broken bottle (which healed immediately) to trigger her alternate personality. Caitlin's transformation affected her physical appearance, as it turned her hair white/grey and changed her eye color to an icy blue.

         Furthermore, her powers could reach such low levels that they could completely negate a speedster's healing powers and alternatively neutralize accelerated decomposing; by generating temperatures as low as -360 degrees, she proved able to shatter beings as powerful as the

     Borderline split personality disorder:
    </b>
    Caitlin's changing biology also caused physiological effects. The more she would use her powers, the crueler and more sadistic she would become, showing no emotional attachment or regard for human life. While struggling to contain her powers, Caitlin developed a form of dissociative identity disorder which is triggered when angered, making it difficult to calm her down and restore her rationality. The change can be seen as the case of Caitlin's super-powered alter-ego weakening in her psychic apparatus, allowing for her hidden fears, grudges, and insecurities to come to the surface, rather than a true split personality. Over time, her friends continued trust and love for her finally allowed Caitlin to overcome her mental struggles, regaining her sanity while having full control over her powers. However about six months later, having taken

In addition to the changes happening more suddenly and erratically both ways, it also caused both the Caitlin and Killer Frost side to no longer have any recollection of the other's actions. After some words of inspiring encouragement from
     Iris West
     , Caitlin and Killer Frost decided to just be the same person and Caitlin no longer had a problem with her alternate self. Killer Frost eventually started to care about Caitlin and was even concerned for her when faced with the threat of a nuclear explosion.

    According to her mother, the continuous use of Caitlin's powers would end up making her unable to "turn them off", leading to Caitlin accidentally freezing her laptop. Caitlin seemingly began to use her powers (in small doses) with little to no adverse effect, as shown at Christmas 2016 when she made it snow. A tell-tale sign of her powers overwhelming her are the physical changes she gradually gains from them, such as her hair turning white and lips turning blue.
     The most noticeable sign of her losing control is her eyes glowing a pale whitish-blue and her distorted voice. The physical changes become more prominent as she makes use of her abilities, though they will recede if she goes long enough without using them, such as her hair going from white back to its original chestnut brown. However, as Frost she is in full control of her powers, to the point where she was able to create a slide of ice to ride across the city. Caitlin is now able to control them through her Frost side, who has become her ally.
