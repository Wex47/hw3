   Kal-El was born in 1979 on the planet
   Krypton
   into the prestigious
   House of El
   to his parents, scientists
   Jor-El
   and
   Lara Lor-Van
   . Shortly after his birth, Krypton was on the brink of destruction with its core about to explode, so the House of El decided to save their children from the catastrophe by sending them away from the planet. Kal-El was rocketed to
   Earth
   alongside his older cousin,
   Kara Zor-El
   .
   Making it there safely, the alien infant landed in a field where
   his pod

   "Pa"

   Clark's upbringing and the lessons of his adopted parents imbued him with strong moral values growing up. Thus, he resolved to use the extraordinary powers he gained on Earth from its yellow sun to do good, fighting evil and protecting the innocent.
   Clark began his crime-fighting activities in early youth, solving various mysteries with the help of his lifelong friend,
   Chloe

   Although he sometimes felt like a "strange visitor from another planet",
   Clark remained proud of his dual heritage, taking both his human and
   Kryptonian
   legacy seriously. Over the years, he maintained a secret sanctuary known as the
   Fortress of Solitude
   at the
   North Pole
   in order to preserve the memory of his home planet and provide himself some respite from his adventurous life.

   As an adult, Clark moved to
   Metropolis
   and after saving a plane from crashing,
   he became a superhero publicly known worldwide as Superman. In his secret identity,
   Clark began working as a reporter for the
   <i key="685c57d7-d50a-4b4b-b2fb-039f0c1a8c3d">

   and with whom he became best friends.

  <p key="a9a2a495-ee0a-4a55-9bf0-d81aa03d2d5f">
   Clark eventually entrusted Jimmy with his super-heroic secret and gave him a special
   signal watch
   which Jimmy could use to contact him in case of emergencies.
   Clark also allowed Jimmy to take the
   first photo of Superman
   , which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize
   before being exhibited at the Siegel and Shuster Gallery.
  </p>
  <p key="3eef61d8-a224-4f14-b31a-560fb71b19da">
   At one point, Clark conducted a prison interview with
   Winslow Schott Sr.
   , a convicted terrorist known as Toyman. Clark questioned his fixation on toys, to which Winslow mused that toys have the power to briefly transport their owner to happier times, which can be weaponized for revenge. He then began laughing uncontrollably, leaving Clark disturbed even as he left.
  </p>
  <p key="45dc1077-e284-4ce8-b72a-226f62e8bf42">
   During Clark's career as Superman, he came head-to-head with numerous supervillains; such as
   General Zod
   , a Kryptonian warlord whom he considered his most feared nemesis,
   a being known as
   Doomsday
   ,
   and
   Ben Krull/Reactron
   , one of his most persistent enemies as neither one was able to defeat the other, resulting in several encounters over the years. Despite the stalemate, Clark was nearly killed by Reactron at one time.
   Superman also went on intergalactic adventures, including a journey to
   Warworld
   ,
   and also encountered a baby
   Sun-Eater
   , a race of powerful creatures which feed of the energy of small stars. Clark eventually chose to keep the Sun-Eater as a pet in the Fortress.

  <p key="2feb0042-8fd2-4449-b748-82c9a7bbfb24">
   In Clark's early days as Superman, he made some mistakes that annoyed the citizens of Metropolis. However, overtime, he became a beloved hero by both the citizens and the world.
   Despite Clark's heroic acts, many of the public are still openly or secretly terrified of him, not because of his god-like powers, but due to their fear of what he might do if he ever lost control of his temper.

  <p key="79dacedd-e550-4e84-8739-fc4266e91287">
   Under undisclosed circumstances, Superman has worked with
   Bruce Wayne
   , a masked vigilante with "tons of gadgets (and) lots of demons" who has a habit of frightening the very individuals he is trying to protect and is considered a "nut" by many. Eventually, Bruce became one of Clark's closest friends or "frenemy",
   to the point that they revealed their secret identities to each other and were known as the "World's Finest".

  <p key="2c66ca11-b0d3-4991-96a5-d878bda9ab1d">
   Superman also befriended the brilliant billionaire industrialist,
   Lex Luthor
   , the CEO of
   Luthor Corp
   . Initially, the two decided to work together to end the threat of alien invasions, but Lex's methods were far crueler than Superman's.
   Although Superman tried hard to trust his friend, defending him against accusations of others and continuing to give him several chances to atone for his wrong deeds,
   he was eventually forced to realize Lex's true nature - this ultimately resulted in a falling out between the pair.
  </p>
  <p key="b0faf91f-2d61-4952-93c9-a70e12a2bd57">
   Shortly after this, Lex came to believe that Superman himself was the cause of alien terrorism as his presence attracted them and declared war on his former friend, becoming his greatest enemy.
   One of these duels had Superman thwarting an attempt by Lex to trigger a fault line in
   California
   with an "earthquake machine",
   while another incident involved Lex creating and selling a series of battle armors he called
   Lexosuits
   , which he used in order to even the playing field when facing the Kryptonian.

  <p key="ee8b6585-45d8-4ffe-90d1-7145518f1197">
   At some point, Superman had at least one encounter with
   J'onn J'onzz/Martian Manhunter
   . Whether or not this encounter ended up in a fight is unknown, but it was enough for him to call J'onn "the most powerful being on Earth". also became aware of his deception, posing as
   Hank Henshaw
   .
   Later on, Clark helped the D.E.O. uncover an alien asteroid, composed of an emerald-green Kryptonian xeno-mineral. J'onn nicknamed it "
   Kryptonite
   " and resolved to store it in the D.E.O. as a contingency against other Kryptonians, which enraged Clark, thus leading to the pair falling out. Despite this, Clark still kept J'onn's secret identity posing as Henshaw a secret for his sake. According to J'onn, Clark was the only other person on Earth besides himself who knew of his identity for many years.

   Kara Zor-El
   , scared and alone inside it. As Kara was trapped in stasis inside the
   Phantom Zone
   for 24 years, she did not age, resulting in her still being physically 13 years old. Feeling that Kara should learn how to be a human and needed people who could be with her at all times, like the adoptive family that took him in, Clark left his cousin in the care of the
   Danvers

   Afterwards, Kara and Clark went to Luthor Corp, to talk with Lena Luthor, who explained that she decided at the last moment not to fly on the Venture due to an emergency meeting on the renaming of the company. and was not related to the accident. To prove it, she gave Clark a flash drive with information on the Venture's destroyed oscillator that a subsidiary of her company had manufactured. Later that day, Lena's helicopter was attacked by drones, but Supergirl and Superman saved her, destroying the drones and realizing someone wanted to kill Lena. Afterward, J'onn tried to talk with Superman who, refused, claiming they have nothing to say to each other as he feels he can't trust the martian since, although he knew J'onn would not allow the Kryptonite in his possession to be used to kill him or Kara, Clark also knew that an order may come from above.

   Over the next few days, Superman and Supergirl prevented various accidents and crimes together in National City but one night at her apartment, Clark told Kara that it was time for him to return to Metropolis, leaving her visibly upset. At this point, the news reported about a man who was about to jump off a bridge. Superman and Supergirl arrived at the site only to discover the man to be John Corben, who was now a kryptonite-powered cyborg called Metallo. He struck Kara with a kryptonite beam knocking her unconscious, but before he could kill her, Superman threw him off the bridge and brought Kara to the D.E.O. where he blamed J'onn for what happened with Metallo. The Martian said that only D.E.O. have access to the kryptonite, but a sample of their stock was stolen four months ago and they could not find it. After they listened to
   Cadmus
   ' declaration of war on all aliens, Superman and J'onn went together to the Fortress of Solitude to find information about the metal that composes the cyborg's body so that
   Winn
   could make an
   anti-kryptonite device

   Clark had actually gone to confront

   When Alex and
   Maggie Sawyer
   were about to fire the Positron Cannon at
   Rhea's spaceship

  <p key="78358ec7-03e3-409d-b2f9-24090fd758b0">
   Clark, under the influence of the silver kryptonite, believed that Kara was actually Zod and started to attack him with the intention to stop him once and for all. He was blind and deaf to all of Kara's words as they began to fight and took it to the streets of National City. Eventually, Kara was able to knock Clark out, however, the strain of the fight made her collapse in exhaustion. They were found by Alex who took them to the fortress to heal and recuperate.

  <p key="48cf1d41-9831-4699-967c-4149f2d49094">
   When Clark was freed from the silver kryptonite, he apologized to Kara and explained what happened. They decided to look into the fortress's records in order to find a weakness of the Daxamites and found an old custom that mirrored Trial by Combat.

   Clark and Kara returned to the D.E.O. where they found that Winn and the rest of the agents had cleared out the Daxamites. Clark met

The cousins told everyone that they found a way to stop Rhea and went to immediately make contact with her. Clark then watched as Kara immediately challenged her to trial by combat. Mon-El was against it and asked why it had to be her and not Clark. Clark told him that Kara beat him which made her the official champion of Earth.
  </p>
  <p key="7951e088-0de8-4485-a7cc-6cb2f6c1b7b6">
   Clark and Kara then saw that the challenge was being publicized and went to Cat Grant to try and tone it down to avoid innocent people moving to watch it and get caught in the crossfire. They were then contacted by Lena and Lillian Luthor about a new weapon and went to L-Corp to meet with them. They found that the weapon was a device Lex had been building to infuse the atmosphere with kryptonite to make the planet uninhabitable for Kryptonians. Lena was able to modify it to release lead instead to make the Earth toxic to the Daxamites. However, Clark and Kara knew that meant that Mon-El would be forced to leave Earth or he would die.
With the stress of the challenge and the possibility of losing Mon-El, Kara asked Clark to train with her in order to help her prepare. He thought Kara was doing well though he could sense that something was still bothering her. She told him that she was starting to have everything she could want with her job, friends, being a superhero, and Mon-El and if she beat Rhea then she would keep all of that but she wasn't sure she could.

  <p key="f4801523-6cdc-49c1-8848-ab06827d3050">
   Clark told her that it was possible because she had earned all of that. He told Kara that every time he fought, he was fighting for Lois, and she should fight to keep what she held precious with her. He then told her it was time. When Rhea was fighting Kara, she called for her troops to attack the city, violating the rules, and Clark moved to stop as many of the Daxamites as he could. J'onn joined him in the streets, along with Mon-El and later

   Kara was then forced to activate the device to release the lead which caused the Daxamites to flee and killed Rhea. Mon-El was then forced to leave Earth through the use of his old spaceship. Before Clark left to go back to Metropolis, he went to Kara and told her that if he was in her position and had to choose between the Earth and Lois, he didn't think he could make that decision.

As a flabbergasted Kara asked him what does it mean, Lois reached them and told Clark to simply be direct, indirectly leading Kara to realize they're having a baby. After she happily congratulated them, Clark revealed to her their intention to move to Argo City until the child is born and maybe a little longer.

   Kal-El was born on the planet
   Krypton
   and sent to
   Earth
   in a
   space pod
   following Krypton's destruction. He was followed by his cousin,
   Kara Zor-El
   , but she got stuck in the
   Phantom Zone
   and Kal arrived in Earth alone. Kal's pod crashed in
   Smallville
   ,
   Kansas
   , where he was found by
   Jonathan
   and
   Martha Kent
   . The couple adopted him and named him "Clark Kent". Due to Clark's
   alien nature
   , he possessed unique powers and abilities that made raising him a challenge. Clark grew to love his time in Smallville, stating that he thought he'd live there forever.
   When he was a kid, Clark would sit on the porch with his adoptive parents and ask a lot of questions about how to solve his problems.
  </p>
  <p key="f5e8b995-99c2-4ff8-b5b8-b6bb1eca3e85">
   In his youth, Clark attended
   Smallville High School
   , where he met his favorite teacher
   Lois Hannigan
   and met his friends
   Pete
   ,
   Kyle Cushing
   and
   Lana Lang
   , with whom he had a crush.
   Clark would also remember Martha excitedly planning for Smallville's annual Harvest Festival every year, watching her preparing with lists and spreadsheets and taking weeks planning what they would donate; through this, Clark learned the value of giving and help out others in need.
  </p>
  <p key="94aef1e7-9389-40e4-b4d9-5e4e269e0008">
   When Clark was in the 9th grade, he wanted to try out for the school's baseball team but Jonathan didn't let him; despite Clark's asking multiple times, Jonathan still said no. Despite Jonathan's reservations, Clark still showed up on the field but one of the main reasons he wanted to try out wasn't there.
   He also was a reporter for the school paper.
  </p>
  <p key="35cfb232-e098-410f-b122-bf0607005eab">
   At some point, Clark attended a
   Soul Asylum
   concert with Lana and Pete. On their way back, Pete fell asleep while driving, causing the car to careen off the side of the road. Lana passed out and Clark managed to save them in time. When they all came to, they were unharmed, with the car completely destroyed. Eventually, Clark and Lana broke up.

   When Martha was preparing for the year's Harvest Festival, Jonathan died due to a heart attack, which Clark would later attribute to his life being set on a new path. Clark couldn't stand to stay at Jonathan's funeral and ran off.

   A year after Jonathan's death, Clark struggled with finding his purpose on Earth and began using his powers to help people in secret, concealing his identity by wearing a ski-mask.
  </p>
  <p key="c0ea04af-a2c7-45e1-9384-4abd718dd1e0">
   One incident involved confronting several men as they were robbing a store and scaring them off with his strength and invulnerability. This led to a discussion with Martha, which ended with her giving him a crystal that was found with his ship. Clark soon left Smallville to find his destiny after saying goodbye to a tear-filled Martha.
  </p>
  <p key="85a6218d-1bd1-4f68-904d-db62c977fd7c">
   The crystal eventually guided Clark to the middle of the
   Arctic
   , when it stopped glowing, he then threw it away out of frustration and turned to leave. However, the crystal sank into the ground and erupted into the
   Fortress of Solitude
   . Upon entering Clark met the artificial intelligence of his biological father, Jor-El.
   He began training at the Fortress while learning about his heritage and origins.
  </p>
  <p key="6f7dbcca-e52d-4bde-ba0e-edf96399ece4">
   Sometime later, Clark returned to Smallville, where he reunited with his mother, Martha. The two discussed about his revelations and she learned that Clark was a
   Kryptonian
   . Clark told her that he was sent to earth by Jor-El to become its champion, although not yet.

  <p key="c9e220a3-15f2-4785-97e7-60f03f04d605">
   As he was looking through his high school yearbook, he decided to visit
   Lana Lang
   again. He found her outside
   Sequoia
   , where it was found that she found
   someone else
   since his time away. Crestfallen at this, Clark returned to his mother, Martha's house, where she sympathized with him. She told Clark that he had been gone for a long time and that Lana, like all others,
  </p>
  <p key="0bc296b2-0f1b-4312-846d-7af81f693d32">
   had moved on with their lives. She then guided Clark to a wooden box, where several objects from Clark's childhood was kept and revealed a
   suit
   she designed following a dream of him flying. Clark gazed at the suit and mentioned his regret of leaving her after Jonathan's passing, although Martha said it was what he needed to do that the time, just like now; Martha urged Clark to go save the world as Clark analyzed the suit. Martha mentioned that the chest of the costume was bare, to which Clark later added the
   House of El
   's coat of arms.

He was then alerted to a rogue car swerving across the road, causing Clark to make his first appearance to the world after saving the car from falling off of bridge and onto a young boy. As people found themselves awestruck by the hero, Clark discreetly changed in a phonebooth before a woman on her way to the scene mentioned that the

   Perry White
   . Perry dismissed Clark's résumé, although Clark insisted that he had experience from high school. Clark was told by Perry that this was Metropolis, mockingly saying that he required cub reporters, not lost puppies. Despite this, Perry begrudgingly hired him after Clark pleaded for a chance, willing to do whatever he asked.

   before Perry handed him off to fellow journalist
   Lois Lane

   Lombard
   had told him to wear a tie. The two introduced themselves, to which Lois stated she had never met a Clark before, though Clark said he only knew one
   Lois

   Ron Troupe
   arrived to excitedly remark that Superman's arrival was his path to a Pulitzer, showing

   Clark was shown a case Lois had been working on, an

   , Clark complimented Lois' journalism before telling her that he had to get going. Lois jokingly asked if he had a big date, though Clark dismissed the idea. Before Clark moved to leave, Lois  offered to ask Perry to give him his own beat in something such as local politics, but Clark declined and wished to stay alongside her.

  <p key="8b2990fd-f3a6-44f6-8027-4c6bb1bc8120">
   Later, Clark asked Troupe where Lois was and learned that she left to confront one of their suspects, Henry Miller. Using his x-ray vision, Clark donned his suit and confronted Miller, deflecting his flamethrower before it could reach Lois and using his frost breath to render the weapon inert. Miller tried to defend his twisted ideals to Superman before tossing two grenades either direction toward a Caucasian and Arab family. Realising Miller's plan, Superman concluded that the grenade heading toward the Caucasian family was inert and destroyed it with heat vision before quickly sheltering the Arab family from the live grenade, causing Superman to be knocked through the store window from the blast. Miller was then tazed by Lois as Superman was applauded by the bystanders. As Lois approached Superman, she asked for his name, suggesting "Mister Metropolis" or "Red and Blue Man". Superman said she'll come up with something and left, leaving Lois to decide upon dubbing the hero as "Superman".
  </p>
  <p key="7f28e156-bf42-4b74-ae5f-85b145bfc21b">
   Clark and Lois began falling in love, and several months into them dating, Clark allowed himself to be interviewed by Lois as Superman. Lois questioned Superman about his childhood on Earth and the location in which he was raised. Superman coyly dodged the identifiable questions and told her that he learned many languages during his time on Earth as an attempt to connect with everyone. The interview then took a break and Lois left for a mic check, where Clark used his super-hearing to eavesdrop on Lois' conversation, overhearing her feelings toward both Superman and Clark. Lois mentioned that she was in love with Clark, although hadn't told him or anyone else yet. Lois returned to Superman and apologized for being unprofessional, although reminded him that she won't go easy on him with the questions.

   When Lois caught Clark spying on her with his superhearing, she almost broke up with him, but Clark spent two weeks sending her flowers so she decided to get back in touch with him and rekindle the relationship since she was still in love.
   Clark proposed to Lois at the

   After the wedding, Clark and Lois went on a honeymoon. Clark said he knew why he had kept his secret for so long, as he was saving it for her, and that he couldn't wait to tell the A.I. of Jor-El about the wedding.

   . He spends time with his family, where they discuss the festival. Clark expresses his excitement on the upcoming festival; Lois adds that she heard about the festival from Clark's dad when they began dating, though their sons aren't as impressed. Jonathan jokingly asks her if they were bedtime stories to help her sleep before going on to say he believes it sounds a lot more like people selling things. Clark reminds him that the festival is for people to share, for those who can and whoever needs it; Lois tells Jonathan to think of it as Smallville's version of 'Burning Man', to which Jonathan hopes excludes the fire and BO.
  </p>
  <p key="9999e9da-76b6-4207-848a-c32aaa2941d1">
   Clark plays along but says that his late mother loved the festival too, recalling her entire weeks devoted to planning it every year while Lois says that this is how he learned about the value of helping out those in need and that he isn't Superman simply due to his powers. In response, Clark kisses his wife's cheek, and assures his sons that, when they see everyone come together and the sense of community, they'll see what the best of Smallville is. Jordan, however, says it doesn't sound like much of a festival, causing Clark to try and convince them with the festival's good food, but Jonathan mentions that his girlfriend is vegetarian. Lois says that she's glad
   Eliza
   is finally able to come visit them, and Clark makes one last attempt to excite the family on coming together for the festival.

   Later in the day, Clark was at home with Lois when she asked what he's doing. He reveals that he wishes to remodel his late mother's bedroom into Lois's home office and donate Martha's things for the festival. Lois said that they belonged to his mom (and thus, they shouldn't get rid of them), but Clark stated that this is what Martha would've wanted; taking the opportunity of the encroaching festival to give them away. Lois concedes to his decision and proceeds to grab a small box belonging to his mom, though Clark lightly tells her not to take it. Lois receives a call from
   Chrissy Beppo

   Afterwards, Clark was alerted to a fire in town, where he arrived to see the
   Smallville Fire Department
   , as well as
   Sharon Powell
   , at the scene. Using his x-ray vision, Clark sees two stragglers, one them being Kyle, in the blaze and sneaks in to help them; Clark uses his frost breath from afar, preventing a piece of burning wood from landing on the pair. At home with Lois, Clark tells her that he was too late to save the festival donations, disheartening the two. He mentions off-handedly that he saw Sharon nearby during the chaos, with her
   son
   notably absent; they speculate that she may have been looking for him, meaning that he might have caused the fire. Suspicious and confused, Lois decides to go and investigate the matter. Just then, their two sons arrive and Clark offers them pizza, though Jonathan says he isn't hungry and leaves the kitchen. Clark and Lois are told by Jordan that Jonathan's girlfriend had broken up with him earlier, to which Lois leaves to go and talk to him. Alone with Jordan, Clark mentions that break-ups are rough, and that he went through an REO Speedwagon phase during one such instance; Jordan questions the mention of REO Speedwagon, though Clark decides to not bother explaining and instead the two sit to eat.
  </p>
  <p key="ad3abe98-958e-4fc0-a4ed-3a456aa97272">
   That night, after dinner, Clark is approached by Jordan, who asks if he can leave early to meet Sarah before the festival. Clark asks his son about the nature of their friendship and if the festival is their date, to which Jordan timidly says it is. Clark becomes excited at the prospect and proudly holds Jordan's shoulders, giving him his blessing and saying that this is exactly what he wanted with the festival. Jonathan walks by and dampens their spirits, making disparaging about the festival and even Smallville itself by extension. Clark sympathizes with Jonathan concerning his recent break-up, though Jonathan is adamant that the break-up is unrelated and expresses his wishes to move back to Metropolis, telling Clark about his recent shortcomings since moving. Clark promises that everything will work out, though Jonathan says he couldn't know that; Clark tells Jonathan he once felt the way he does. However, Jonathan is unable to see the comparison, due to Clark being a superhero, as well as his brother, who also has powers, saying that he is nothing like either of them. Jonathan remarks that Smallville is his Kryptonite, and that he hates it, before asking Clark for permission to live with a friend in Metropolis instead. Clark immediately shuts down the idea, causing Jonathan to say he might do it anyway, just as Jordan did with football, before asking Jordan to leave for the festival with him. Clark gives Jordan permission to join his brother before once again recalling the year following his father's passing.

   With the Harvest Festival in full swing, Clark is lost in thought, reminiscing about his childhood and recalling the fallout of an argument with his mom; she had admitted Clark was special and meant for things greater than Smallville. Clark remembers the crystal key given to him by his mother, which inevitably led to him learning about his origins. Snapping himself back to reality, Clark leaves his room to join the rest of the town at the festival.

It also seemed to affect his son, Jordan, who became infected by being around his father afterwards; exhibiting symptoms similar to a cold, though much more severe. It quickly became bad enough that Jordan began having trouble breathing; so Clark brought Jordan to the Fortress to be healed. As the A.I. of Jor-El told Clark, the kryptonite was causing Jordan's lungs to fill with fluid, but due to his system cooling the air he breathed (his freezing breath), the kryptonite was essentially gradually freezing his lungs. As Jor-El's A.I. explained, the only way to get the kryptonite out of Jordan's system would be to do as had been done with Clark in the past (burning it).

     In Clark's civilian persona, he portrays a very meek and clumsy demeanor with an old-fashioned and mild-mannered attitude. His fake demeanor is so believable that it is hard to tell when he is genuinely clumsy, which he admits does happen on occasion.
      This demeanor was developed as a means of ensuring that no one would suspect any connection between him and his alter-ego, Superman. Even the highly intelligent
      Lex Luthor
      is deceived by said, deeming it "ridiculous" even to think that someone like Clark could be Superman, as "he can't see past his glasses".

     Clark sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his responsibilities as Superman - bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved. Other motivations for Clark's professional writing were his love for both the art and mysteries.

     Being raised by two loving parents, Clark values family deeply - whether it's from his Kryptonian family or adoptive human family. He has a very tight bond with his biological cousin Kara and the two often turn to each other for advice and emotional support. He's a family man through and through - he has a strong and loving marriage with Lois and is a caring and attentive father to Jonathan and Jordan - especially the latter as his social anxiety means that he needs more assistance than Jonathan.
    </p>
    There have been times where traces of Clark's real personality are displayed; one example was when Lena accused him of suspecting her of being behind an explosion because she was a Luthor; which Clark confirms without the slightest hesitation.

      Kryptonian tongue

      Lena Luthor
      ; due to his bad experiences with
      Lex Luthor
      , he can even be short-tempered to the point of being hostile when sufficiently provoked - when he and Kara were almost killed by the green Kryptonite-powered cyborg
      John Corben
      and learned that the
      D.E.O.
      had a spy from
      Project Cadmus

     According to James, Clark doesn't work with the government because of their secret experiments on alien life, which has also caused him to distrust the government itself; this also extended to
      J'onn J'onzz
      , whom he originally had a good relationship with until the latter resolved to store
      Kryptonite
      in the D.E.O. as a contingency, which enraged Clark, thus; leading to the pair falling out, as Clark believed that the Kryptonite the D.E.O. had could fall into the wrong hands and would eventually be used against him or his cousin Kara; this fear of his proved to be correct, although the situation was resolved when all the D.E.O.'s Kryptonite was entrusted to him to destroy it, and J'onn and Clark's friendship was repaired.

     Clark (under the persona of Superman) was once best friends with Lex Luthor, as the two initially tried to work together to repel the threat of alien invasions, but Lex's methods were far crueler than Clark's, although the latter tried hard to trust his friend, defending him against accusations of others and continuing to give him several chances to atone for his misdeeds; however, once Clark realized Lex's true nature - this ultimately resulted in a falling out between the two, while Clark (initially) only put an end to their partnership and did not attempt to put down or expose Lex and seemed to be reluctant to combat Lex, even after Lex himself declared war on him; due to believing that Superman's presence attracted the aliens, as Lex committed unspeakable crimes and even went as far as to cause an earthquake in California, any feelings of companionship that Clark had for Lex has vanished; due to Clark being furious that Lex would put innocent lives in danger for the explicit purpose of taking him down.

    <p key="27f30bda-20a0-48b3-a303-770e54c7c355">
     In fact, Clark and Lex's enmity eventually escalated to the point that their both considered the other to be their greatest enemy, although unlike Lex, Clark prioritised saving innocent lives instead of taking Lex down, despite this, he was determined to stop Lex, although Clark did not kill Lex after he eventually defeated him, he still did not hesitate to expose his crimes to the public to incarcerate Lex so he can do no more harm. As a result of Lex's actions; Clark has difficulty trusting most members of the Luthor family; however, his distrust is based out of logic, not prejudice.

    <p key="a43aa255-5c9d-4408-91c7-7a29ece052ff">
     Despite Clark's pride as a superhero, he is not above apologizing or admitting when he is wrong, like when he apologized to Lena for his initial distrust towards her, when he believed she was behind sabotaging the
      Venture
      ; due to his bad experience with Lex, as Clark realized that he should have given Lena the benefit of the doubt, not just the because of her last name.
    </p>
    Despite Clark's brave demeanour, he is not completely fearless, as he is terrified that someday he may become exactly like the very threatens that he protects the citizens of
     Metropolis
     and overall the entire

    from. Upon Clark learning about misdeeds of his evil doppelgänger,
     Kal-El
     of
     Earth-TUD22
     , he was horrified by the atrocities committed by the latter; Clark becomes even more terrified when he discovers that his doppelgänger was exactly like him; until he started killing innocent individuals, as he is afraid that someday he may become exactly like his evil doppelgänger.

    While born of a highly-evolved race, like any Kryptonian, Clark's physical capacities are normally no greater than a normal human of his conditioning. However, once properly charged, the energy surging throughout his being enables him to perform various superhuman feats. While generic for his race, having lived essentially his entire life with these abilities combined with a lifetime of experience and practice with them granted him far greater control and an equally greater levels of raw power compared to other Kryptonians. This was shown from his body's physique naturally maturing as he grew up into well-muscled and conditioned comparable to peak-level human athletes. Able to overpower several empowered Kryptonians at once alone, Clark's might made even
     Kara Danvers

Having been constantly exposed to yellow sunlight and maturing with it since infancy has allowed him to store up energy in far greater quantities and metabolize it with equal efficiency than other Kryptonians. Direct exposure to sunlight will also accelerate his recovery from any injuries he does manage to sustain. He can also drain solar energy stored in plants to recharge and heal himself.

     Genius-level intellect/Expert tactician/Leader:
    </b>
    Clark is a very advanced and methodical thinker. He has tactical and strategical ability to be able to contend with
     Lex Luthor
     , an infamous master manipulator and genius whose mental faculties are nearly unrivaled on Earth, and ultimately thwarting Lex's various crimes. Also, Clark can completely conceal his identity as Superman to others, using various subterfuges to perfectly appear as a normal and socially awkward man, so much so that even Lex himself found it ridiculous that Clark was Superman. He has great intuitive, able to quickly analyze the situation before him to understand the true nature before him and effectively adapt to the situation, most commonly seen from quickly determining the level of power needed to defeat his enemies without kill anyone causing the least collateral damage. Clark can inspire other individuals to be the best that they can be and sometimes inspire criminals to do the right thing without resorting to violence.

    Clark is proven to be a highly skilled fighter, one of the deadliest in the entire multiverse. His combat skills are great enough to be able not only to fight on par against other very physically powerful experts, but also to defeat them single-handedly. He took down and imprisoned
     Maxima
     , a warrior queen of her planet, defeat

     wearing his Lexosuit repeatedly, and even ultimately best
     Zod
     , a highly skilled Kryptonian general in both of their altercations, killing him in their final fight. He is able to effectively use his opponent's own momentum against them and can easily keep up with the highly proficient Martian Manhunter. His combat skills can even be still effectively used while he was in a physically or mentally weakened state, such as suffering Kryptonite poising and defeat super-powered cyborgs, or compete for a prolonged period against Supergirl while overwhelmed by rage-filled hallucinations.

     Indomitable will/High tolerance for pain:

    Clark has a powerful spirit, free of corruption and temptation, having been raised by a kindly Kansas farmer and supported by his wife, he was taught to protect life and help others. He is very optimistic and never gives up, even when things look bad. Even when possessed by the consciousness of
     Zod
     , the love for his family allowed him to ultimately reject Zod's influence completely and expel the foe. Likewise, despite rarely feeling the sensation thanks to his powers, Clark has proven to possess an incredible tolerance for pain, famous for his courage in battle.

    Like all Kryptonians, even while empowered, Clark is vulnerable to the exposure of Kryptonite, a radioactive mineral of his home planet

       Green Kryptonite:

      Green Kryptonite not only physically hurts Clark, but also it weakens his resilience equal to a normal human. Likewise, injuries endured while still affected by Kryptonite will take noticeably longer to heal than normal. If exposed for too long, it will eventually kill him. However, due to a long lifetime of constant exposure to yellow solar radiation, Clark has developed a certain level of resilience to Green Kryptonite, able to resist larger amounts and for longer periods of time compared to most Kryptonians. When directly exposed to it by
       John Corben
       , despite being weakened, he still retained noticeable superhuman might and sent the cyborg flying several feet, unlike his cousin Kara, who is always powerless when exposed to Green Kryptonite.

       Supergirl
       was actually his greatest enemy,
