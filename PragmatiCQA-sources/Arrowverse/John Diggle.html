   John Diggle was born in 1977 in
   Starling City
   to an
   unnamed soldier
   and an
   unnamed woman
   . He had a younger brother,
   <a href="Andy Diggle.html" key="d163651c-ce40-4fb2-b626-2258ce5af3a6" title="Andy Diggle">
    Andy
   </a>
   , but their relationship was always very tense.
   Growing up, John and his father would see
   Starling City Rockets
   games every weekend using the Starling City Subway until it was decommissioned.
  </p>
  <p key="d90cf339-291f-4ef7-8113-7de02f18c876">
   When John was a child, his father died during a
   Marine Corps
   mission in
   Vlatava
   alongside two other soldiers. John blamed his father's death on Lieutenant
   Roy Stewart
   , who ran said mission. Six months later, Stewart begun visiting John's mother, eventually marrying her and becoming John and Andy's stepfather. John continued to hold a lot of resentment towards Stewart, which worsened when the man began to force him and Andy to undergo intensive military training every day in order to toughen the boys up and prepare them to the hardness of life.
  </p>
  <p key="a41459f1-776e-4e16-b024-3b021c0da39e">
   In 2003, John joined the
   United States Army
   and was stationed in
   Afghanistan
   .
   In 2005, he held the rank of Sergeant.
  </p>
  <p key="1c4da2e3-dd7e-48b8-af2b-e2b7b1d42285">
   On July 23, 2005, John's unit was driving to the front lines in Afghanistan when they noticed a young girl standing in their path. John stopped the convoy and tried to help her, but the group ended up in a trap and were attacked by Taliban insurgents. During the fight, all the men in John's unit were eventually killed. Guilt-ridden and angry, John ruthlessly massacred the remaining insurgents. Afterwards, he saw the girl from earlier was injured from the battle and tended to her. John brought the girl to safety with him and later narrated the experience to a superior.
  </p>
  <p key="f78f437a-4ba4-45e5-8730-2bef8a47754f">
   When he discovered that Andy was a drug dealer, John angrily beat him until his knuckles bled and convinced his brother to enroll in the army as well, hoping it would set him on the correct path.
  </p>
  <p key="e9e993ee-6b44-4178-9d22-caf31eb5c16b">
   John and Andy went on a mission in Afghanistan, hoping to stop the local arms trade. On the way, their armored truck was attacked and their group was pinned down. John rushed out and planted a land mine while Andy and the rest drew the hostile truck towards it. The truck ran over the mine and exploded. Back at base camp, John and Andy were on guard duty. Lt.
   Joyner
   approached them and offered them a deal to confiscate some of the opium they recovered and sell it off. Andy appeared to reject the offer which pleased John, but John later caught Andy talking to Joyner. Andy played it off as a casual conversation about teaching Joyner to count cards, but lied to John and was actually helping Joyner steal opium.
  </p>
  <p key="f1dd6e09-8f73-41ab-a41d-b81de67aca92">
   At some point in Afghanistan, John met a tribal leader who told him stories about the
   <a href="League of Assassins (Earth-1).html" key="ccc2a674-c684-41b4-b86f-86789a69dec2" title="League of Assassins (Earth-1)">
    League of Assassins
   </a>
   , an ancient group of warriors comparable to ghosts. However, John dismissed the League as an urban legend, mainly since the tribal leader "was smoking what he was selling".
  </p>
  <p key="616202c2-3e1e-41c2-8b95-486a582571e7">
   After one of his times back home, John saw the "ghost" of a fellow soldier who had died, a symptom of survivor's guilt, and only made it go away once he figured out what the ghost was trying to tell him.
   During his time in Afghanistan, John met
   Ted Gaynor
   , a fellow soldier who saved his life from the enemy.

   </a>
   . As John was driving Oliver into town, the two made conversation over the former's experiences in the
   army
   . John informed Oliver that his main priority is to protect his client, regardless of personal discomfort. Just then, Oliver suddenly vanished from the car, much to John's shock.
  </p>
  <p key="1067ca5e-5500-4269-a0f0-2ad664a81efa">
   The night after, John accompanied Oliver to his homecoming party, choosing to sit with him in the backseat to make sure his client wouldn't disappear again. At the party, John surveyed the area and watched on, impressed, as Oliver pickpocketed and disposed of his sister
   <a href="Thea Queen.html" key="dfbfce72-0a97-4a34-9c51-e30ed2ca9bc4" title="Thea Queen">

   's drug stash. Later, he caught Oliver trying to leave the party through the kitchen, not buying his client's excuse of wanting a moment alone. As they headed back inside, Oliver quietly knocked John out in order to confront
   Adam Hunt
   .
  </p>
  <p key="746564fd-d36b-4f18-b955-6e6ff153e2fe">
   Over the next week, Oliver continued to try and avoid John, even driving off in the car alone following his legal resurrection. That evening at the
   Queen Mansion
   , John was reprimanded by Moira for not protecting Oliver. He tried to explain that his client didn't want his protection, which Moira was unsatisfied with and threatened to fire him. After Oliver returned home and agreed to accept his bodyguard, he apologized to John for giving him so much grief. John quipped that having served three tours in Afghanistan, he can handle Oliver's antics, but stated he will quit himself if his client runs off again.
  </p>
  <p key="5151de7f-22b6-464e-a415-09b1d252cbda">
   The next day at
   Queen Consolidated
   , John witnessed Moira and Oliver's argument about the latter refusing to work at the company as was expected of him. While riding home with his client, John subtly empathized with Oliver's dilemma, reflecting on how after spending five years in Afghanistan, he realized that his home was just as much of a "battlefield"; your loved ones always try to get you to open up and be your old self again, which may not be possible anymore. John then noted that Oliver seemed unusually mentally strong for someone who spent five years cut off from civilization.
  </p>
  <p key="7d4b0497-a25b-4076-ab33-85b5e609966c">
   Later one night at

   Chinese Triad
   when they broke in. He briefly dueled with
   China White
   , who eventually overpowered and was about to kill him but Oliver saved John's life by throwing a knife, shooting the blade out of her hand. When the police arrived, Detective
   <a href="Quentin Lance.html" key="d9b51f7b-4cda-4b7c-95bc-fcec2bde2255" title="Quentin Lance">
    Quentin Lance
   </a>
   thanked John for saving his daughter. Afterwards, Oliver gave John an ice pack and also thanked him. John likewise reciprocated for his employer saving him, in turn, during the confrontation and commented on Oliver's ability to accurately throw a kitchen knife from 10 feet away, refusing to drop it when Oliver tries to make it sound like he got lucky when he threw it like that; but Diggle knows the difference between a beginner's luck and the skill of a legitimate expert, and Oliver's knife-throwing exhibited back at Laurel's place was definitely impressive as far as anyone with military experience like John is concerned. Suspecting there to be more to his charge than previously thought, John gets upfront with Oliver and cryptically stated he is "just beginning to understand the kind of man [Oliver] [is]". Sure enough, after Oliver visited his father
   <a href="Robert Queen.html" key="3187e74d-8f5a-44b5-9b91-fc42439aa1eb" title="Robert Queen">

  </p>
  <p key="e5b85f5a-68cf-4c1b-94d4-cc799dbf8cde">
   After Oliver ran out again on his watch by escaping through a bathroom window, John met him at the mansion the next morning and stated he would now be "watching [Oliver] pee", much to the latter's amusement. When Oliver decided to open a nightclub in his father's
   old factory
   , John was skeptical of the idea, pointing out his club's desired clientele wouldn't want to come into
   The Glades
   so late at night. Oliver insisted they would due to his notoriety and the business would soon gentrify the neighborhood. Amused at "the white knight swooping in to save the disenfranchised" on his own, John praised how "perceptive" Oliver was.

  <p key="43d1f7d8-c088-4ee7-83e0-cb4b67a90725">

   's security detail. When Oliver arrived, he warned John to stay vigilant since the sniper responsible for targeting the bidders would attack before the event, eliciting confusion and suspicion from the bodyguard. Suddenly, a shooting suddenly commenced. John took Moira and Thea to safety before pursuing Oliver, only to end up caught in the crossfire of the Hood's battle with
   Deadshot
   . John's shoulder was wounded with a
   curare
   -laced bullet. The Hood brought John to
   <a href="Arrowcave (Earth-1).html" key="73d9b084-6f59-43ec-a5ca-5db3950c1c5c" title="Arrowcave (Earth-1)">

  </p>
  <p key="e5cc8195-a78e-437d-9695-8a6ac0341580">
   Once John recovered, he learned the Hood was in fact Oliver, much to his shock.
   Angered, John attempted to attack Oliver, who easily dodged his shots. Oliver explained he wanted to save the city and offered John the chance join him. However, John adamantly refused, deeming Oliver a "murderer", and left. The next morning, John tendered his resignation as Oliver's bodyguard, citing that he "didn't approve of the way [Oliver] [spent] [his] evenings".
  </p>
  <p key="d2f7529d-cff8-4d44-891b-f64d36585fe7">
   A couple nights later, John was eating dinner at Big Belly Burger when Oliver arrived in an effort to change John's mind about his offer. John was initially dismissive until Oliver showed him
   <a href="The List.html" key="f3a2cc3d-c60e-4a81-93a0-e342c324c258" title="The List">

   , which he found on Robert's body while burying him. Oliver explained he is atoning for his father's sins by helping the people of the city who were wronged by the criminal deeds of the elite. Oliver then revealed that Deadshot, whom he took down at the Unidac auction, was Andy's killer, much to John's surprise.
  </p>
  <p key="d579c317-0c59-4d9d-b7a7-9ad7e6e2d423">
   Over the next day, John began to rethink his role as a bodyguard. He talked with Carly about his desire to make a difference again, like back in Afghanistan. Carly encouraged John to pursue something he believed in, which was what mattered the most. The next morning, John showed up at the Queen Mansion to see Oliver. Accepting that Starling City needs someone to fight for it, he agreed to join Oliver, acknowledging how the latter needed someone at his side when fighting a "war". Just then, John witnessed Lance arrest Oliver.

   After Oliver was put under house arrest for being accused of being the vigilante, which was actually true, Diggle was told about a crime lord that was in trading arms. Diggle thought Oliver intended to head out himself but Oliver told Diggle himself to observe his closet men. Later, Oliver, had Diggle go out himself donned the Vigilante costume in order to save Oliver from incarceration.

   Diggle learned that Officer
   Stan Washington
   was shot while attempting to stop a robbery by the
   Royal Flush Gang
   and tried to convince Oliver to branch out from The List to help the city. Oliver at first refused until Diggle arranged for him to pay Stan's medical bills at

   Jana
   , who thanked him for helping her husband. Oliver then agreed to help catch the Royal Flush Gang. That night, they hacked the bank cameras and attempted to find footage to help identify the members of the gang. However, the camera footage isn't enough and Oliver decided to break into the police station to get the information needed. Upon identifying the members of the Royal Flush gang, Oliver and Diggle found out they were one of the families hurt by Robert's corruption in selling
   a factory
   that employed them. Oliver attempted to give them a second chance by offering
   Derek Reston
   , the father of the gang, a new job. Upon being refused, they decided to take down the Royal Flush Gang.

   Oliver tells John about his contact with Laurel and asks him to look into Danny. He wants John to alert the police to anything he finds. John wants the Hood to get back to work. John has found a pickup truck he can link to the fire deaths. Oliver pauses when John tells him this is a time for the Hood. John isn't happy Oliver left Laurel by herself to battle the killer. This leads to a brief fight between the two as John tries to figure out what is wrong with Oliver. He thinks the other archer got into his head. Oliver talks to John about what happened to him during his battle with the other archer. In past years he'd never been worried about death because he had nothing to lose. But his life is different now because of what would happen to his loved ones if they lose him. John thinks having something to live for should give him an edge.

   John and Oliver arrive at Queen Consolidated. John suggests Oliver go to the hospital but he declines. Oliver brings the Vertigo sample to Felicity Smoak, claiming it is an "energy drink" manufactured by his friend "Kevin" to cure hangovers. Oliver hopes she can analyze it and find out where in the city it was produced. When Felicity wonders why the "energy drink" is in a syringe, Oliver replies, "I ran out of sports bottles", much to her and Diggle's exasperation. Against John's wishes, Oliver goes after The Count.

   At the Arrowcave, Oliver shows John Diggle the notebook that he got from Felicity Smoak. John finds it suspicious that Moira would have a copy of Robert's list, but Oliver attempts to write it off as a coincidence. John understands Oliver wanting to believe that his mother is innocent, but the evidence is suggesting otherwise, especially Walter's recent disappearance. Oliver returns to the Arrowcave and tells John about the destruction of the notebook. John sees it as a confirmation that Moira is hiding something, and says that if it were anyone else, Oliver would be donning his Hood gear and confronting them. Their conversation is interrupted when Laurel calls Oliver's ghost phone. As Oliver leaves to help her, John asks if he is just using this as an excuse to run away from the truth about Moira. When Moira's regular chauffeur mysteriously calls in sick, John arranges to take his place. Moira has him drop her off at a restaurant. Once Moira goes inside, John follows her in, only to discover that she's attending a friend's birthday party. When Moira asks why he's there, John lies that he was looking for the restroom. Oliver tells John about the ambush, and John suggests that Oliver "cannot see straight" with either Laurel or Moira. He has been keeping Moira under surveillance, because someone with an unbiased perspective needs to keep an eye on her.

   Oliver initially disapproves, but John convinces him that there is nothing wrong with driving her around for a few days. John drops off Moira, who claims to be meeting with her accountant. Once she goes inside, John follows her and sneaks into a supply closet next to the office. Using a listening device, John overhears Moira talking to Malcolm (although John doesn't know who it is), telling him that she's made sure that Carl Ballard won't interfere with "The Undertaking". Malcolm's bodyguard comes into the closet and sees John, and asks what he's doing there. John claims that he was looking for a place to smoke and shows the bodyguard a cigarette lighter, which he substituted for the listening device. John plays Oliver the recording of the conversation between Moira and her contact (whose voice is distorted and unrecognizable), and Oliver is shocked that the accident with the yacht was no accident. However, he insists that Moira couldn't have been involved. John doesn't believe it and figures that the recording shows that she's involved, but they are interrupted when Quentin calls on Oliver's cell phone. Oliver reviews John's recording and is devastated to learn of Moira's complicity in his father's death. John suggests that blind trust can be dangerous and they figure that they need to know what "the undertaking" is and how Moira is involved.

   Concerned with the rising danger of their missions, John tried training Felicity, wanting her to be capable of defending herself.
   After Oliver's return from an earlier mission, John asked how it played out, and Oliver answered "Bad for him". Oliver then informed John and Felicity that his target was
   Guillermo Barrera
   , an assassin, and he needed Felicity to hack his phone in order to figure out who Barrera's target was. When Felicity hacked Barrera's phone she was able to see that the last number that was called was to a restaurant called Jade Dragon, and John revealed that it is a front for the Chinese Mafia. Then when Felicity had hacked the phone they saw that the target is Malcolm Merlyn. He interrupts Oliver and

After Oliver got back from saving Malcolm, Oliver informed John that Malcolm was taken to the hospital stating that it was good he wore a bulletproof vest.

When John went to the mall, the trap was already taking place. He observed the A.R.G.U.S agents (including Lyla) while waiting for Floyd to show up and when Floyd was started sniping the agents John quickly ran towards Lyla and was able to save her and then he ran to stop Floyd from escaping. John ran into Floyd in the staircase, the two fought, and Floyd got hold of John's gun. Floyd held John's gun at his face, and he forced him to fall on his knees with his hands behind his head. John told Floyd "I'm gonna kill you for what you did to Andy". Floyd answered, "I would pull the trigger right now, but no one is paying me" and he told John, "I got space for you right here next to your brother", showing John his victim tattoo of Andy. Floyd then punched him in the face with his gun and left John on the floor. Felicity later tended to his wound and when Oliver came back, John was angry at him for not showing up when he needed him.

   Gholem Qadir
   . John argued with Lyla about Waller's methods when the A.R.G.U.S. director killed Shrapnel for attempting to flee the mission. He was disgusted by Waller's callous disregard for the lives of her agents, while Lyla supported her boss. He managed to get an invitation to a party at Qadeer's mansion, which Deadshot used to infiltrate the premises and locate the nerve gas. When A.R.G.U.S. sent a drone to destroy the mansion, John persuaded Deadshot not to sacrifice himself for the mission. He persuaded the guests to leave by denouncing Qadeer in front of them, and he, Lyla, and the squad flee. He later reconciled with Lyla, saying that she was more important to him than sticking rigidly to his principles. In a flashback sequence, John was seen serving as a soldier in Afghanistan. He helped capture Gholem Qadeer and saved his life when their group was attacked. He was also seen meeting Lyla for the first time.

   Months after Ra's al Ghul's attack on Star City Diggle took up a suit and became the leader of Team Arrow while the team was fighting thugs known as "Ghosts". After the city leadership was killed by the Ghosts Laurel and Thea brought Oliver back to Star City to help. Diggle was not pleased with the situation but accepted his help. When the team was able to locate the leader of the ghosts the team ambushed them but Darhk escaped. The Ghosts next target was the Star City train station so the team monitored the station before Diggle confronted Oliver and told him that he could not forgive him because Oliver was incapable trusting anyone.

   Oliver told the team that he planned to run for Mayor which Diggle thought was a joke until he realized he was being serious. Diggle then joined the rest of the team in seeing the new Arrowcave. When a team of rogue police officers killed two police officers and started stealing drugs from dealers, Diggle joined Thea in buying some to lure them out.

   Oliver had Diggle and Quentin work together when Damien blackmailed Quentin into installing a data eraser into a federal server farm. They entered the server farm and saw the device begin erasing files on various people including Andy Diggle. Soon an alarm tripped and two guards spotted them. Quentin hit John and faked arresting him as part of an SCPD sting. The team later regrouped at the Arrowcave when Sara Lance attacked Thea again and devised a plan using Thea as bait to lure Sara out. Thea waited in Verdant until Sara burst through a window. Diggle rushed Thea to safety while Oliver and Laurel captured Sara. Later, Diggle was present when Oliver's old friend

   Darhk's hideout
   . After Oliver glumly returned from dinner with Felicity and Donna, Diggle fetched some whiskey (a replacement for the vodka from the old lair) he stashed and listened to Oliver vent about his relationship problems. Diggle realized Oliver was feeling jealous of Ray but assured Oliver that Felicity chose him, not Ray. The team later regrouped and formed their plan to rescue Ray. After knocking out a Ghost, Diggle took the uniform and masqueraded as one to infiltrate the base and the team was able to recover Ray.

   Diggle accompanied the team in fighting off a Ghost attack on a Star City Bank armored truck. However, the Ghosts were successful in destroying the money. After debriefing in the lair, John asked Oliver to stay behind so that he could show him the file that Lance gave him on Andy. Diggle later joined the team when they were breaking into
   Wolfman Biologics
   . After knocking out a Ghost, Diggle pulled his mask off revealing the Ghost to be his dead brother Andy. Andy then escaped. John was distraught that his brother was a killer and working for H.I.V.E. At the police gala, Diggle and Laurel talked over their shared experience with resurrected siblings. Diggle and Oliver then go after an H.I.V.E. gathering at the Docks, watching as Damien give new H.I.V.E. inductees mind-altering yellow pills. They are spotted so they fought off the Ghosts. After the debacle, Diggle told Oliver to drop it as he had lost hope in Andy. Oliver hadn't lost hope and refused to give up on Andy. Diggle also told him off for Oliver's plan to use his mayoral campaign to get in bed with Damien. Ray tracked H.I.V.E. to the Muller Psychiatric Center so the team attacked the base, looking for Andy. The team, with timely help from Ray Palmer, recovered Andy from H.I.V.E. Oliver also told John that he would take his advice and not use his campaign to get into H.I.V.E. He then went to Andy (who was being kept in a cage in the Arrowcave) and asked him if the bad things he did in Quentin's file were true, which Andy confirmed.

   At Oliver's bay cleanup, Diggle was down because his brother was finally home, but in a cage. He had another talk with his brother, trying to find out why he would abandon his wife and child and pleaded for him to renounce his ways. Diggle later supported Oliver's plan to expose Damien Darhk to the public. Diggle used his contacts to recruit marines for security detail at Oliver's campaign holiday party. However, Damien Darhk showed up, took out the security, and kidnapped Diggle, Thea, and Felicity. The three of them were put into a gas chamber. After Oliver turned himself in to free them (but Damien went back on his word), Laurel and Malcolm (dressed as Green Arrow) arrived and were able to rescue them from the chamber.

   After Felicity was shot by H.I.V.E., Oliver was unable to get a lead from any ghost so he had John beat up Andy to try to get him to give up information on Darhk. He went to see Felicity before her surgery. He then went home and had a talk with Lyla about Andy. Lyla told him that he was too busy seeing him as a traitor and that he needed to reach out to Andy as a brother. Team Arrow was able to find a lead on Lonnie Machin, who was already after Damien Darhk, at his foster parent's house so John accompanied Team Arrow to the house. After getting tangled up in one of Machin's traps, they disabled the auto-guns and captured Machin. Later, he revisited Andy who told him about how he was able to fool John into believing he was doing good during their time in Afghanistan. Andy also told him about Darhk's vision of a world reset and that he believed Darhk's message due to what he witnessed in Afghanistan. John pleaded with him that Darhk had hurt a friend of his and crossed a line. Andy thought about it and then gave John a lead, Stonehaven. John later checked in on Oliver and discovered that Oliver broke Machin out of police custody. John reminded him not to lose his humanity in going after Darhk. John forced Oliver to go see Felicity. Team Arrow discovered Machin's next target was Stonehaven, which was Darhk's place of residence. Oliver and Thea distracted Machin while Laurel and John untied and ushered Darhk's

   While John and Lyla were on a date, A.R.G.U.S. agent
   Alan Chang
   showed up asking for their help. A group of armed men then kidnapped him. John jumped into the van to try and save Alan, while Lyla opened fire but the van got away. After briefing Team Arrow and delivering food to Andy in the basement, John and Lyla went to A.R.G.U.S. to talk to Amanda Waller. Waller handed them a flash drive containing information on
   Shadowspire
   , a war profiteering group. Knowing that Andy used to be in Shadowspire, John had another talk with Andy about Shadowspire. Andy told him he wasn't a part of the organization anymore but that he could help Team Arrow capture them and told John that Shadowspire tends to use the nearest free port for its operations. Team Arrow discovered they had kidnapped two other A.R.G.U.S. agents and tracked Shadowspire to Pacific Freeport, but the agents were found dead. John then brought Andy to Amanda Waller where Andy could brief Waller on how Shadowspire worked. Later, Shadowspire attacked A.R.G.U.S. and held the command center hostage. Lyla was able to get a video feed down to the detention center where John was monitoring Andy. John used the TV monitors to broadcast a signal to the Arrowcave. John then planned for Andy to fake betraying him and tell Joyner that he was in the ventilation shafts. He was caught by Joyner's men and Andy double-crossed Joyner so a fight broke out. With the arrival of Team Arrow, they were able to stop Joyner from access A.R.G.U.S.'s
   Rubicon
   codes. John then took Andy to his home for dinner and had him meet his niece as gratitude for saving his life.

Barry examined it and noticed a peculiar smear imprint, and questioned if it's a mystery message from Oliver. He enrolled a hesitant Diggle in helping make sense of what it could be. Barry discovered dregs on the veil which coordinate

   Diggle and Barry traveled to Lian Yu but didn't find any Mirakuru. Barry became upset, wondering if he was failing Oliver. In Deathstroke's former cell, Diggle proposed that the dregs were from Oliver carrying his suit to battle Slade years back, and  there isn't a crucial arrangement about it. Diggle advised Barry on pacing his life and appreciating the new world that Oliver died for in order to truly honor his memory.

     returns from retirement, and their lives were on the line, Oliver states that he understands that he had lost John's trust, but asks that John give him a chance to earn it back, which John does by sharing all the information about his brother's death with Oliver. Later on, after Oliver notes that John kept details of Andy's death from him for two years, John completely trusts Oliver once more when he jumped in front of an oncoming attack that was meant for John.

     John is not a hypocrite in his unforgiving nature as he treats everyone equally, he made no exception with his previously assumed deceased brother, Andy, and the new persona his brother exhibited, even though Team Arrow volunteered to get Andy back, he was dead set against the idea.

     After taking on the mantle of Green Arrow (albeit briefly) John is initially insecure of his position, as he finds it hard to make the decisions that Oliver would normally make, however, eventually overcome this insecurity, becoming more confident, being trusted with the hood meant everything to John, so much that he ignored his injury that was effecting his performance on the field out of fear that either he would disappoint Oliver and the team or that Oliver would rescind his offer discovering that John is not physically fit. To overcompensate for his injury, John developed an addiction to illegal performance enhancers supplied by Ricardo Diaz to the point where he almost ran through fire to save a box with them while Team Arrow were destroying his drug operation.

     John can be self-righteous to the point of being a hypocrite; like the way he was talking to Rene, acting as though his testimony against Oliver was out of a whim, when he knew full well he did this for his daughter and nothing else. Especially when John is also a father himself and would've hypocritically done exactly the same thing.

     Since John recuperating from his injury and returning to his Spartan persona, he developed a small degree of bitterness towards Oliver for teasing him with the position of Green Arrow yet also a degree of shame on his own part for losing that position do to hiding his injury then illegally self-medicating. However, John later realizes that the reason why he was so frustrated with Oliver, was not because of the mantle of Green Arrow, but instead because he lost faith in Oliver's leadership. This bitterness reaches a breaking point to where John places all blame on Oliver for

The suit seems to a more civilianized form of military armor. It includes a protective chest-plate made of a leather-like material covered by a dark jacket likely made of the same material. The suit also includes dark army pants and boots.
