   Paul

   Karla Groves
   walked in and Felicity was forced to fire her, which she was able to infer straight away. Days later, Curtis ran into Felicity again in her office. He reminded her that the list of names was double-sided, and she realized that Curtis' was on the flip-side. He realized this and acknowledged that it was okay, as it was his own fault, not to mention it gave him time to holiday with his husband. However, eventually, Felicity re-hired him, along with the several people she had to fire, claiming that he had a revolutionary idea for the "technology of tomorrow", and would require all of the necessary manpower.

After showing Felicity a few things that he has been working on, Felicity asks Curtis to scan a playing card, looking for anything out of the ordinary.

After Curtis finishes the tests, Felicity visits him and he offers to look at her phone. After making comments about her name, he presents her with what he found out about the playing card. He reveals that it is not a playing card as it contains proteins and receptors. Curtis says that although they can track him, their ‘poker player’ can track them faster.

Despite different opinions about the leader, everyone still had a goal - to stop the criminal. The heroes discovered that
   Rob Reynolds
   would be the next target of the attack, so they headed to his location. Together, they managed to defeat the criminals, which they later celebrated at the base. Curtis and Felicyty revealed that they worked behind a crossbow for John, who would fire arrows, and presented him with a
   Green Monster

   Curtis was still working with Felicity on the company's startup when a problem arose in the form of the mysterious and seemingly random three Black Siren victims. Not wanting to allow further death, Curtis created a device that could track an enemy when he used his abilities. This way, they tracked her down to Helix's old hideout, where it turned out that she was working with Cayden James.

   suffered as a result of the fight, and the vigilantes immediately transported her to the hospital. As they failed to catch the criminals, the team began looking for links between the victims of the evil Laurel. Each of them shared a boring life that was a cover. In fact, they were important personalities working in the
   International Domain Name Directory vault
   , and had access to all the servers that comprised the internet. Thus, they understood that the criminals wanted to get into the server room and destroy the internet. They immediately went to the place where they began to fight the enemy who had managed to escape. Their action, however, was partially successful, because thanks to Felicity's cunning, it was possible to save the network.

The heroes tried to get him, eliminating most of his men, but he managed to escape again, throwing the ball towards Diggle. Upon returning to the hideout, the vigilantes rethought their actions and discovered that Diaz was behind the production and sale of a steroid that would increase combat abilities and concentration. Thanks to John's informant, the heroes obtained the address of his laboratory, where they eventually went. Unfortunately for them, everything was destroyed and Diaz managed to escape once again. After a few hours, Diggle decided to tell his friends the truth that he was taking Ricardo to get rid of the hand vibrations that resulted from the wounds he received on Lian Yu. The team accepted the soldier's apology, and Curtis agreed to help his friend in the same way he helped Felicity get out of her wheelchair.

Upon learning that Cayden James was working with the Black Siren again, they decided to attack them at the company they were breaking into. There, however, Diggle suffered a pain attack and had to send the team alone, but failed to catch the enemy. Curtis, understanding the reason for the attack, took his friend to the hospital, where Dr.
   Schwartz
   looked after him. After all, Curtis returned to the hideout, where he argued with Felicity about making his own decisions about their joint activities. In the end, however, they came to an agreement and decided to continue fighting the hacker, with the help of Oliver, who was released on bail. Together with him, they discovered that James was taking revenge on the Arrow for killing his son -

   The entire team attended Oliver and Felicity's wedding, with Curtis spending most of his time with Rene and Dinah. The party made the man think about relationships and breakup, which led to intoxication. Even so, he was sober enough to catch the bride's bouquet, but was unable to speak normally, and Rene decided to take his friend back to his own house. Quentin was kidnapped shortly after, and Cayden James made demands for a power device from the
   A.R.G.U.S. headquarters
   that the vigilantes had stolen. Oliver asked Curtis to remake the device, and Curtis agreed. Immediately afterwards, it became known that Oliver, Felicity and John were informed that someone on the team was going to testify against the mayor in front of Agent Watson. The three suspected Dinah, whom they rejected from the crew, confessing that they had spied on both Rene and Curtis, leading to an altercation of trust. It turned out, however, that it was Rene, whose FBI agent had pushed him to the wall, threatening him that if he did not help, his daughter would never see her father again. The confession upset Oliver, who kicked the man from the team. A few hours later, after talking frankly with Thea, Oliver gave the band a second chance, getting ready to take Quentin back from Cayden. Even though it all turned out well, the mayor kicked Rene out of the team for disobedience during the mission, and Dinah, who could not trust the team, left with him. A few hours later, Curtis also resigned, admitting he can't trust people who don't trust him.

  <p key="83941828-59a1-470f-a81c-e523d4c87acc">
   For the next several weeks, Curtis avoided the rest of the team, but continued to work with Felicity on
   a chip
   that would help John get back in shape. In late January 2018, the man visited the bunker where he met Oliver in the elevator. His goal was only to try to place the device in Diggle's hand, which was unsuccessful. Curtis decided to work on the equipment in his home, not wanting to spend more time in the bunker. Immediately afterwards, he visited Rene and
   Zoe
   who was getting ready for school. They discussed what had happened in the squad's ranks, with Rene beginning to feel guilty about what had happened. Some time later, Curtis, Rene, and Dinah were summoned to Felicity's house, who, along with John, presented them with discoveries that there had been a bedbug in the bunker for several months. As a result, Cayden's team, which included Ricardo Diaz, Anatoly Knyazev and Vigilante, knew everything about the vigilantes.
  </p>
  <p key="4a7cafee-a90c-42d0-b16a-a83c2bfa95b5">
   After this awkward conversation, Curtis and Rene made their way to Ramirez's house, where Dinah joined them soon after. She decided that they had to form their own band because they couldn't sit with their hands folded. Hours later, the three were invited again by the Team Arrow, and during the meeting, Oliver apologized for his behavior, explaining his intentions and expecting the recruits to help him in his fight against Cayden. However, they disagreed, believing that they prefer to be in Outsiders where they are appreciated. As a farewell, Curtis handed John the repaired chip, then left the rest of the way. The three went to the hideout Curtis had prepared for
   their team
   .

  <p key="580cc11c-b0d7-4d53-b615-c4c75ff9bef4">
   The Outsiders were working in their hideout when they found out that Cayden James had mastered the city's entire infrastructure and was causing harm to innocent people from a distance. Their thoughts were interrupted by the activation of one of the T-Sphere, which began targeting the Vigilante itself. The team decided to go to the scene and check everything in order to finally be able to capture the enemy. There Curtis met Vincent, who offered to cooperate and, as proof of his reliability, indicated the site of the impending tragedy. Curtis did not tell the rest of the team, and as soon as they returned to base, he called Felicity, wanting to know the location of the place indicated by the enemy. Immediately after that, they went to an underground link between two train routes, where the two vehicles were racing at each other. As neither Curtis nor Rene could separate the tracks, Dinah started screaming so hard at one of the trains that she finally stopped it. Upon returning to the base, Curtis told his friends that the information he had had been passed on to him by Vincent Sobel himself, believing that they should trust him. After discussing the details, the heroes unanimously agreed that they should use the information from the enemy, who interrupted the conversation and sent another message using T-Sphera. According to its content, the heroes went to the indicated place, but for safety reasons, they contacted the Team Arrow, with whom they decided to join forces for this one time. Together, they held back Boots's attack on a safe zone of the city, and during the fight, the Vigilante once again proved his worth by killing Sheck in defense of Rene. After that, both teams returned to their hiding places, ending cooperation.

   The city was in fear of the recent actions of Cayden James, who continued his activities by murdering A.R.G.U.S. during one of the missions. Dinah continued her relationship with Vincent, who continued to feed the Outsiders. During one of the meetings, he was attacked by the Team Arrow, but Wild Dog and Mister Terrific immediately stopped them from being stupid by confessing the truth about the Vigilante. Everyone immediately went to the hideout, where all inconveniences were cleared up. Oliver, however, still did not trust Vince, but needed him to hack Cayden's servers. Everything went as planned, but as soon as Vincent left the building, criminals caught him, seeing him as a traitor. As soon as the heroes found out about it, they set off to save him. Unfortunately for them, the original line-up of the team preferred to find the discovered bomb, rather than saving the ally, and thus only the Outsiders went to save Vincent. On the spot, however, they fell into a trap and were separated. Dinah crushed the ceiling as she watched the Black Siren murder Sobel on Cayden's orders before her eyes. When Curtis and Rene arrived, it was too late to rescue the ally. Returning to base, the devastated woman thanked her friends that they had gone with her to get Vincent, then went home.

   Realizing that Dinah was pursuing Laurel Lance, Curtis and Rene decided to stop her, but to no avail. Returning to the hideout, the men received a call from John, who informed the allies about Cayden James' plans and the intention to activate the bomb in the evening. He also revealed that they could avoid it by bringing the man's allies alive to a specific place. The heroes unanimously decided that it would be best to deal with the Black Siren first, because Dinah is on her trail. As expected, the vigilantes met women fighting each other, breaking them apart. After a short discussion, the heroes split up again to catch Anatoly and Diaz. When they were all captured, they immediately went to the assembly point. There Laurel, wanting to upset Cayden, confessed to killing his son and approached him, beginning to insult him. The latter, knowing that the woman was lying, slapped her, not realizing that the bomb's activator was interfering with the meta-gene blocking collar. In doing so, Laurel managed to break free and make a mess, deafening Cayden and allowing the others to escape. The heroes immediately set off to pursue the criminals who, despite their best efforts, managed to escape. Cayden himself, however, was caught and arrested. The Outsiders, however, left the bunker, believing that their joint victory still changed nothing. Oliver held Dinah out and told her she was better than this and didn't need to kill.

   When it became known that the city's 70 million stolen by Cayden James had been stolen again, both the Outsiders and the Team Arrow began looking for answers to who had stolen them. As it turned out, Laurel Lance was behind it all. Both teams started looking for the woman from the place where they last saw her.

  <p key="1b2f8ba2-cc2d-44dd-a849-7fcf104b48ea">
   When the Outsiders returned to their hideout with nothing, the vigilantes suddenly stormed them, following the clue they had found, indicating that the wanted one was in this place. There was an argument between the two teams, which resulted in a strong disagreement.
  </p>
  <p key="a8000135-f5fa-4a80-9662-6a6c4a226638">
   Rene took the opportunity to argue with Oliver and attached a bug to his costume, thanks to which they could overhear their achievements in their search. Thus, after a few hours, they found out that it was Quentin who was hiding Laurel and they set off to the set place after the old team.
  </p>
  <p key="4612aba0-0797-45b2-86e9-6ecf1cbd84d3">
   However, they found out that they were being followed and threw out the bug, losing the Outsiders. Curtis refused to give up and used an implant implanted in John's hand to track down the vigilantes.

  <p key="bece50a2-6d3f-4c8d-9e32-1a7a01dadf09">
   When they got there, a fight ensued between the two teams, during which Laurel began running away with Quentin. Rene fought Oliver when Curtis decided to run after Dinah and stop her from doing a foolishness. He managed to speak to his friend, but Lance took the opportunity and ran away.

   Rene's condition, led to him by Oliver, meant that he had to be transported to the hospital as soon as possible. After waiting for a message for several hours, Dr. Schwartz said they needed to transfer the patient to a facility outside of Star City.

Curtis made it clear that they had no right to ask about it and that they were not friends, ending the cooperation they had, all communication and acquaintance.

   Curtis helped Dinah through the cops' files to discover who was corrupt. Thus, he found out about
   Nick Anastas

   Kimberly Hill
   took over. The woman began to suspect that her supervisor was also corrupt, and she and Curtis decided to break into the evidence room at the police station. It was then that Curtis ran into Nick, whom he talked to so Dinah could complete her investigation. After returning to the base, it turned out that the drug was

   Curtis and Dinah, due to the lack of Rene in the team, decided to make a temporary alliance with the Team Arrow. They informed them of their temporary discovery, and in return asked for help in capturing Anatoly Knyazev. The plan was successful and the criminal was imprisoned, but the first complications appeared on the spot. Captain Hill, along with Attorney
   Armand
   , ordered the criminals to be released, focusing on the unjust arrest. As if that were not enough,
   Martin Hurst
   was murdered shortly after, as a result of which Dinah decided to hide the remaining uncorrupted policemen along with Curtis. Unfortunately for them, among them was the traitor who released their location. Curtis was shot and Anastas learned the truth about his secret "work". Despite everything, the policemen managed to escape, but the happy moments did not last long. Captain Hill had kicked out all uncorrupted policemen from the police force before her departure, which was notified to Dinah and Curtis, who had come to visit the man.

   Helix Dynamics

Felicity, however, explained that she has nothing in common with the vigilantes, talking about the recent changes in the team. This surprised Curtis, but he decided to work with a friend. During this, he noticed her workaholism, effectively concluding with the lack of something in her life - the possibility of caring for her husband during a bunker mission. The woman didn't want to admit it at first, until she saw the final Green Arrow action on TV.

   Curtis picked up Rene from the hospital after being away for over a month. Upon entering the house, the man spotted his daughter and Dinah preparing a

   In the hideout, John apologized for the harm he had done to them and for the distrust he had placed in them. The conversation was interrupted by Quentin, who pointed out to the vigilantes that Diaz was a member of the Quadrant. This forced the avengers to take the next steps, namely to destroy the loaded trucks, but without Ramirez, who could not shake the thought of death and parting with his daughter.

   After returning to the hideout, the avengers invited John to the team, being satisfied with the cooperation.

   Hours before Queen's trial, the team wondered in their hideout what to do.

Curtis is the only one who has not been questioned, which allowed him to watch

Soon after this, testimony was made by Laurel Lance herself, who stood up for Oliver and did not reveal his secret identity.

   Curtis was showing Nick his workplace when armed assailants appeared outside the windows and started shooting at the apartment. Curtis wasn't injured, but Anastas took the ball for a boyfriend. The protagonist quickly transferred the former policeman to the hospital, and then met the team in the hideout. The Team Arrow also arrived, the bunker of which was completely destroyed. As both teams had a common goal, they decided to work together. Thanks to the information from Anatoly, the heroes knew about Diaz's transport to the police station, so they attacked the truck.

Soon after, the man showed up in the hideout wanting to help, but was sent by Dinah to the hospital due to wounds that still had not healed.
   Oliver made a deal with Agent Watson, and the FBI began working with the vigilantes. Together, they recaptured the command, but they did not encounter Diaz there. Anatoly gave them some location, but it turned out to be a mined trap into which the heroes entered. Rene, fearing for his own life, called his daughter and told her that he was proud of her. Ultimately, thanks to Overwatch, it was possible to get out of the way and come back on command to regroup and make another plan. The heroes used Quentin to get to Ricardo. The mayor, however, did not want to return without Laurel and turned himself over to the gangster, to everyone's surprise. As Oliver searched for a solution, he remembered the pacemaker in the ex-cop's heart that could track him. Immediately after being located, they rushed to the scene and began fighting criminals.

   Ultimately, Ricardo managed to survive and escape the mishap, so the heroes went to the hospital with a wounded Lance. While they waited for news of his condition, Agent Watson arrived and arrested Oliver. It turned out that the cost of cooperation was the voluntary handing over of the man to the agency, with the emphasis on immunity for other avengers. As if that were not enough, Dr. Schwartz informed the audience of Quentin's death, which broke everyone. When Oliver was transported to prison a few hours later, he pleaded guilty to reporters and cleared

     Curtis is highly intelligent, kind, caring, selfless, moral, honorable, just and optimistic. He is a hardworking man with respect, acceptance and appreciation for Palmer Technologies employees. He is assertive and makes a very good impression without being influenced by others. He always makes fair decisions, is consistent, firm, decisive, even when criticism is unavoidable. Curtis is extremely cool and is also not afraid to make unpopular decisions. He believed that when Felicity Smoak returned to Star City, the company would flourish again, but when he heard the dismissal, he walked away with honor, enjoying the long-planned vacation with his husband.
