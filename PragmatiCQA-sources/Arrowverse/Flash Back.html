   Barry continues to find ways to increase his speed, now that Zoom's identity has been revealed. The entire
   team
   devote their time to help Barry gain speed, but they continue hitting dead ends. Barry returns home to have dinner with
   Joe
   and Iris, and the yet-to-be-here
   Wally
   . Wally announces that his project was so good, his professor was willing to work with him again. He wants to improve in his studying, and jokes that he wishes he could ask Ferrari or Porsche for help, but they're dead. That gives Barry an idea to go back in time and consult Eobard Thawne for a way to increase his speed. Barry leaves the
   West house
   and goes to
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   to discuss his idea with the rest of the team.
   Wells
   initially forbids it, but then he realizes Barry has no choice. Barry is given a sedative for him to administer to his past-self.

   As Barry moves to the past, he spots a

    Time Wraith
   </a>
   flying towards him. This distraction causes him to end up traveling back a little too early to his past-self and
   Hartley Rathaway
   's first altercation in front of
   Rathaway Industries
   , rather than the battle at the
   dam
   . The past Barry notices future Barry and after a brief struggle, future Barry manages to sedate past Barry and switches the emblems on their
   suits
   .

   Barry then returns to S.T.A.R. Labs to meet with Harrison Wells/Eobard Thawne, and brings his conundrum with the
   Speed Equation
   to him. After some convincing, Thawne agrees to help him with the equation.

   In the
   pipeline
   ,
   Cisco
   and
   Caitlin
   are locking Hartley into a cell. Knowing how Hartley escapes, Barry asks Cisco to scan for explosives. The three find his hearing aids to be explosive, and they make Hartley remove them. To counteract his tinnitus, Eobard suggests they play music, before rolling away.

  <p key="a23ca2ac-7c9b-4acb-80ed-803704ed882e">
   At
   CCPD
   , the Time Wraith attacks, tearing apart Barry's lab before appearing at the top of the staircase in front of the entire department. The force's shots do nothing to harm the wraith. It then leaves through the window to find Barry. Barry cleans up his lab as
   Eddie
   enters to ask Barry about the wraith, leaving him speechless upon seeing Eddie again for the first time in a year. Joe misinterprets this as awkwardness between him and Eddie due to his love for Iris but Barry states that he's moved past it.

  <p key="cc59285f-8f19-4a61-9824-08d700e8dc3a">
   Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Eobard calls Barry back into his lab for information on his Speed Equation and promptly knocks Barry unconscious while his back is turned. Barry awakens in Eobard's
   secret room
   handcuffed to his
   wheelchair
   . Eobard knows that it's Barry from another timeline as the Time Wraiths only chase speedsters when they travel through time. His suspicion is further confirmed when he notices Barry doesn't flinch upon seeing him walk and use his own speed, as well as when Barry attempts to phase through the handcuffs, since Eobard had not yet taught past Barry how to phase through objects yet. He becomes upset when he believes that his plan fails if there is a future Barry still alive, but Barry convinces him that it is because of the singularity opened by Eobard's returning home that has sent him back, as he needs to learn how to stop it. He remarks that he doesn't need the future Barry to travel back to his time and prepares to kill him with his vibrating hand until Barry forces him to help with his speed by saying that he left a letter on his past self that reveals how to beat Eobard, meaning he will never make it back home.

   In the pipeline, Cisco is playing Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" on full blast to torment Hartley into revealing how the
   gauntlets
   work. The Time Wrath shows up at S.T.A.R. Labs in pursuit of Barry and forces Cisco and Caitlin to hide in the cell with Hartley for safety. After convincing Cisco to trust him, Hartley is able to rig the gauntlets to emit a destructive signal in the wraith's frequency, hurting its ears as it flees.
  </p>
  <p key="8cb643a7-4949-49e1-a158-3855b677de8e">
   After Barry and Eobard reconvened with Caitlin and Cisco, they remarked that they would have died without Hartley and deduced that the Time Wraith is after Barry. Cisco and Caitlin worked on repairing Hartley's gauntlets while Eobard and Barry gathered information on the Time Wraith.
  </p>
  <p key="dbbd2c09-a9f6-4668-ba58-e06f421c2694">
   At CCPD, Barry feigned making a birthday video for Iris to convince Eddie to record a video professing his love for her. While Cisco and Caitlin were commenting that Hartley was the only one able to make the necessary repairs to the gauntlets, past Barry showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs. Cisco and Caitlin were confused, but future Barry revealed to them that he time-traveled. Eobard then took future Barry aside to give him the answer to Barry's efforts to increase his speed.
  </p>
  <p key="c8e69833-6da7-4a99-a7bb-0f76102a9e75">
   Before future Barry went back to his own time, he told Cisco that Hartley knows about
   Ronnie
   and switched emblems with his past self. He then started running in the particle accelerator but the Time Wraith chased him, slowing him down. Past Barry then ran after the Time Wraith and kicked it off course allowing future Barry to run through the wormhole.
  </p>
  <p key="64dd7f3d-4214-4d23-adce-98c780eb0690">
   Once Barry returned to the present, Cisco and Caitlin used a sonic gun on the Time Wraith but it failed. The wraith grabbed onto Barry sucking the life out of him, but Hartley showed up and used his gloves to destroy the wraith. Hartley then left for dinner with his parents and Barry was surprised at the change in timelines. They went to the console in the Time Vault and accessed Eobard's information on speed enhancement. Barry then went to console Harry about his strained relationship with
   Jesse
   . Later, Barry gave Iris the video he recorded with Eddie and Iris sheds a tear.
