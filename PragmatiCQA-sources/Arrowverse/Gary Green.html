   Gary defected from the Bureau after
   Neron
   manipulated him into reattaching his severed nipple, which had been cursed following its time in
   Hell
   . Motivated by his frustrations that the
   Legends
   and the Time Bureau did not treat him equally or with any respect, even after all he did for them, Gary joined Neron willingly, despite
   Constantine's
   protests.
   As no one apart from Constantine (who Neron had kidnapped) was aware of Gary's betrayal, he was able to return to the Bureau and instigate a takeover of the organization, partly in revenge for how he was treated by them.
   When his nipple was eaten off by
   Wolfie
   , Neron made him host of the
   Fairy Godmother
   instead.

  <p key="b4c2316b-53fe-4bad-9732-f53bff71702c">
   However, he later felt bad for how he treated the Legends, so he betrayed Neron and was made an official member of the team by
   Sara Lance
   . After the Time Bureau was shut down due to the
   Neron incident
   , Gary became the apprentice of
   John Constantine
   (against the warlock's will due to using a Fairy Godmother wish) and started helping him with his cases. This continued into the

   Between 2012 and 2017, Gary was employed by the
   Time Bureau
   . In late 2017, after
   Julius Caesar
   was displaced in time, Gary was one of the two agents that were sent to retrieve him. Once they got there, they were knocked over by
   Mick Rory
   , who was chasing Caesar. Rory tackled what appeared to be Caesar, and the time agents brought them back to the Time Bureau. However, they quickly realized that Caesar was simply a
   partier
   . Gary showed them out, validating their parking.

   </i>
   , Agent
   Ava Sharpe
   had Gary follow them to
   Wisconsin
   in 1870. They quickly caught on and took Gary as a prisoner aboard their ship, admitting that he had been sent as a spy. When Agent Sharpe checked in with Gary, he attempted to convince her that everything was fine, while in fact, being held at gunpoint by
   Sara
   . Sharpe soon came aboard, and, following a brief altercation with the Legends, freed Gary.
  </p>
  <p key="eca260fc-6b7f-46ca-8aab-6c51e49cfd5c">
   Shortly after, Gary was sent to fix an
   anachronism
   in
   Seattle
   in 2042. He watched as
   Kuasa
   used hydrokinesis to stop an
   A.R.G.U.S.
   transport vehicle, nearly catching its prisoner,
   Zari Tomaz
   . Green sent a distress call to the Time Bureau. The call was intercepted by the Legends, who sought out Gary. They attempted to find out what had happened, but Gary refused to tell them, until Mick intervened and threatened him, so he opened up. He followed them back to the
   <i key="bcb04882-b61e-4003-b1b6-1c98d7f0d2ad">
    Waverider
   </i>
   , staying there until they brought Zari aboard. Having not technically prevented the anachronism, as was Agent Green's initial mission, he scolded them. Soon after, the Time Bureau caught up with the Legends, allowing Gary to transport himself aboard their ship, assisting Agent Sharpe with talking with the Legends.
  </p>
  <p key="d5166eed-1a5d-48e6-8ef0-ef00d66d3bd7">
   When Zari had to be put under sedation to heal herself from being coated with volatile time fluid, Gary appeared in a mental simulation that had him transport to the
   <i key="8cad9e8a-6958-4327-bcf8-f173385420f8">
    Waverider
   </i>
   to warn the Legends about a bomb being planted on their ship. He tried to teleport to the ship but ended up stuck inside the trash compactor. He couldn't warn the team so he used a chrono repeater to make the final hour before the bomb's detonation repeat constantly to give the team the time they needed to save themselves.
  </p>
  <p key="638b7ac9-8aaa-4ab3-97a6-5a019b8bb771">
   When he was found,
   Mick Rory
   took the repeater from him and destroyed it as he thought it was the bomb. He explained what happened and found that there were only five minutes left before the bomb exploded and it was their final chance. They found the bomb that was planted by
   Damien Darhk
   and Zari took it and isolated herself to save the team and the simulation ended when the bomb was supposed to blow. When Zari woke up and learned the truth, she wondered why
   Gideon
   had put Gary in the trash compactor the whole time, to which Gideon replied that she thought it would be funny.

   When a fellow employee named
   McNeil
   , who Gary didn't like, had been given top honors, Gary called him and told him that he deserved it and that the bureau was lucky to have him. After he hung up, Gary vowed that he would 'come for him'. A moment later,
   Wally West
   had sped over to him and took his time courier and pants, leaving him out in the middle of the street. Gary quickly moved to get away and inform Ava Sharpe, who was on a date with Sara Lance. When he got there, he quickly told Ava what happened and also told her that there was a report that Rip's brown trench coat had been stolen from the bureau's vault. He then commented that Ava looked amazing but she told him to back off as she went to alert Sara. However, they came back to find that Sara had left, just as dessert came. Gary said that what she did was harsh and asked if Ava wanted him to have the dessert boxed for her but Ava told him to be quiet.
   Gary had been at the Time Bureau when a Palmer tech smart watch appeared with a message from
   Ray Palmer
   . He had alerted the
   <i key="12ff85b3-1e89-44e2-8581-5f3d5bb4bca1">
    Waverider
   </i>
   and was surprised to see that Ava Sharpe was there with them. He played the message which had Ray tell them that he was a prisoner of Damien and
   Nora Darhk
   and to not look for him as they would kill him if they tried.
  </p>
  <p key="10f9eda3-76a9-44cf-872e-caec90b3f10a">
   Gary had gone with Ava Sharpe to New York in order to find
   John Constantine
   when Sara Lance had been taken by
   Mallus
   and the
   Death Totem
   . After going through his file, Gary realized that Constantine was a warlock and told Ava that he himself was a Level 9 warlock but she told him that Dungeons &amp; Dragons didn't count. They found him trying to give a ritual service to a woman that wanted her son to be married. They revealed the situation and Constantine told them that the Death Totem was linked to Mallus as the lost tribe of Zambesi to which it belonged had sided with Mallus during his war against the other five tribes. He revealed that he could get to Sara through Mallus' realm because they had a metaphysical connection, and Ava revealed that she also shared a strong connection with Sara and Gary realized that the both of them had slept with Sara. Constantine tried to bring both himself and Ava into Mallus' realm but the demon blocked him and released a burst that sent all three of them flying.
  </p>
  <p key="c6affdbd-b0c1-4e5c-a579-6824409f11ca">
   After they had failed to get to Sara, Gary proposed a different approach. He first told the story of reclaiming a lost weapon in his Dungeons &amp; Dragons quest and Constantine realized that they didn't have to get to Sara but get to the Death Totem. The warlock excitedly kissed Gary and set out to take them to the totem itself which would bring them to the
   <i key="a2072425-95c9-437f-b477-7f21d72901fc">
    Waverider
   </i>
   and to Sara. They succeeded and Gary watched as Constantine tried to subdue Mallus and exorcise him from Sara. However, the demon went and used Astra's voice to weaken his resolve before sending both Gary and Ava flying off to keep them from interfering. After Sara had been saved, Gary went with Constantine back to New York where he got him to become a fellow Dungeons &amp; Dragons player by swearing on a twenty-sided die.
  </p>
  <p key="07150e3d-afbd-4dfc-9882-3f9242289c88">
   When Ava hadn't appeared at work in days, Gary became worried and went to the Legends to try to find her. He came upon Sara Lance and Ray Palmer and he informed them about Ava and he also learned that she and Sara had broken up, to his disappointment. He brought them to the Time Bureau where they went into her office to find some clue about where she had gone. To his surprise, they learned that Ava's personnel file had been erased. However, they found postcards in the trash that were from her parents and they lived in Fresno. They believed that she might have gone there to try and get over her and Sara's breakup. When they got there, Sara quickly deduced something was wrong and it was revealed that Ava's parents were in fact actors that were hired to be a convincing backstory.
  </p>
  <p key="a2ce8641-b455-4513-8740-1c4fdb44f196">
   They returned to the Time Bureau and found that Ava had returned though she said that she had taken the time to visit her parents in Fresno, which they knew to be untrue. Sara then stole her time courier and they hacked its history when they found that Ava's first mission had been to Vancouver in 2213, which Gary had informed them was a no-fly zone. He explained that time couriers and the
   <i key="051e9ae9-0618-4e56-852c-09dc8a484a13">
    Waverider
   </i>
   couldn't fly there and only a Time Bureau director could make that kind of authorization, or the Mother Ship could take them there. He explained that he failed his flight test but Sara told him that she would be flying. They arrived in 2213 and quickly found themselves surrounded in Ava Sharpe look-alikes. They found out that they were clones that were created at the AVA Corporation. Gary was amazed by all the Ava's running around while Sara Lance was horrified.
  </p>
  <p key="a136d294-d711-4221-a073-74675a531aca">
   He followed Sara and Ray to the
   AVA Corporation
   where they found that the Ava clones were made from the best genes gathered in the attempt to create the perfect woman. They believed that Ava had made the time a no-fly zone to keep people from finding out the truth about her but when Ava appeared, after tracking the stolen mothership down, she fainted at the sight of the clones. It was then that they realized that Ava had no idea of the truth behind her origin and Gary offered to mind wipe her but Sara told him that she deserved to know the truth. However, the clones found them and declared them trespassers and tried to execute them but they all fought them off, while the one that Gary did try to fight turned out to be the real Ava, who twisted his arm. Back on the

   , Gary became depressed after everything that happened and Ray took him aside as he offered to mind wipe him of what he had seen in 2213.

  <p key="e5065cf1-0483-43e7-9bec-acd838ee225b">
   After Mallus was cuddled to death by Beebo, Gary was charged with cleaning up the leftover fur on his own. An encored
   Damien Darhk
   ambushed him and stole his
   Time courier
   , leaving Gary tied to train tracks. Gary was rescued by the Ava and Sara of 2020, who noticed his future self fizzling out of existence. Though rescued, Gary developed a phobia for trains.

   Due to the Legends' latest blunder, Gary teamed up with the warlock Constantine to take down mystical creatures. During this time Gary and Constantine did "a thing" that Gary thought made him lose his virginity. This wasn't the case.
  </p>
  <p key="bdd147c1-1442-4902-af81-f220d5cf354e">
   Gary later approached the Legends dressed as Constantine, before the real Constantine showed up, carrying a dragon's head. The demonologist demanded to know whose idea it was to release
   Mallus
   , in which everyone points to Sara. Constantine then reveals that Mallus wasn't the only evil locked away in the time prison.
  </p>
  <p key="67756eb7-a336-447d-81bd-847d4c31f2d9">
   Despite the Legends spending months monitoring for magical creatures in addition to the
   aberrations
   , nothing else besides the dragon popped up. Gary had returned to the Time Bureau, disappointed. After the final aberration of Paul Revere was corrected, Gary was tasked with bringing the Legends to the Bureau for a celebratory party. Shortly afterwards, he was contacted by Constantine and the Legends to help lure in a
   unicorn
   that was at
   Woodstock
   . Unknown to Gary, the unicorn was a killer that preferred virgins as prey; he was tricked into believing unicorns loved pomegranates, being told to offer the treat to the creature to lure it in. After seeing the blood on its mouth and its disguise removed, Gary fought against being eaten by the beast as Constantine attempted to send it to
   hell
   . Despite the creature letting go, it bit off Gary's nipple in revenge before being sent to hell. Sara offered to have Gideon replace the nipple, but Constantine told Gary to accept the wound as a badge of honor - a symbol of winning against evil. Gary told Ava about the adventure, quite proud of his scar; unintentionally angering Ava that Sara kept the existence of magical creatures attacking the timeline a secret.

   Gary was "let down easy" by Constantine, who explained that the dangers of the magical world made having a relationship impossible. However, Gary did agree to water John's plants while he lived on the

   When

   Gary helped get
   Mona Wu
   hired as the caretaker for the magical creatures that the Time Bureau was keeping in containment. It was a win-win, since Mona was well-versed in legends; Gary on the other hand was happy that he didn't have to keep erasing Mona's memory every time she started asking about the Time Bureau.

   Custodians of the Chronology
   were rampaging in the Time Bureau to catch a shape-shifter, Gary was told to run interference. During another alteration to the timeline, Gary died; Charlie

   <i key="a80f1da7-a381-4e15-a6e1-6e61724abc38">

   </i>
   sent by Ray Palmer. Despite Ray's insistence to call Constantine, Gary arrived on the time ship to offer his limited magical knowledge. Noticing Ray acting off, Gary began listing off things that could be wrong; he unknowingly correctly guessed that Ray was under demonic possession, which prevented the victim from speaking the demon's name. After dodging a knife attack from Ray's Neron-possessed hand, Gary locked himself into the containment cell as protection; he knew that if Neron forced Ray to kill a loved one, he could take over his body without resistance. However, Ray sadly admitted that while he was fond of Gary, he didn't consider him a loved one, making Gary feel a bit hurt. Neron appeared on a screen, telling Gary that he has not been appreciated by the Legends or his boss; he tells Gary that if he makes a deal with him, as a demon, Neron has to keep his end of the bargain, unlike humans.

  <p key="21f60357-edbd-4015-ada7-4d1c64cae22e">
   Shortly after Ray agrees to give Neron his body in exchange for sparing Nate, Gary exits the cell to find Constantine trying to exorcise Neron again. After being scolded for foolishness, Gary had finally reached his lowest point; Neron offered him back his nipple, which had become filled with demonic power. Gary accepted and went back to the Time Bureau, planning to take it over and finally get the respect he deserved. Confronting Ava in her office, Gary used his demonic nipple to hypnotize her into obeying him; he then conducted "performance reviews" on the rest of the staff, slowly preventing any help from reaching the Legends. After even getting Nora Darhk under his control, Gary was defeated by Mona's new
   Kaupe
   alter-ego
   Wolfie
   , who bit off his nipple. Neron arrived shortly afterwards with
   Tabitha
   , whom become his new Fairy Godmother.

After forcing them to read the entire book within a few moments, Gary began talking about it; however, he then wondered how he could make everyone else like him. Sara reminded Gary that he was already considered a Legend; this prompted Gary to name himself the captain of the

   Wanting Nate and Mick to join them on the ship, Gary wished for them as well. However, Mick snapped at Gary, calling him an idiot. The other Legends finally admitted that they were a bit annoyed with him for interrupting them during their mission. A hurt Gary told the Legends that he had done nothing but use his wishes to help protect them. Finally giving in to Tabitha's suggestion of revenge, Gary made Ava and Sara dance like crazy, made Mick look like a big baby and made Nate (whom had always been the nicest to him) experience terrible acne and a bad haircut (Gary's teenage years).
  </p>
  <p key="8991cd3b-1436-41ea-95e4-df7eaf9b8b59">
   Nate finally got through to Gary, telling him that bully others isn't how to get respect; Gary reversed his wishes and Tabitha disappeared shortly afterwards. After being told that Ray's soul was in hell along with Constantine, Gary called for his Fairy Godmother, unaware that Tabitha had passed the mantle/curse on to Nora. Despite the Legends attempting to tell him of this new development, Gary wished for Ray and Constantine to be brought back from hell, sending Nora down to get them.

  <p key="8524febd-43fe-410f-9e49-fd8affecec75">
   Gary helped the Legends build
   Heyworld
   in order to help make the public aware that their fear of magical creatures was baseless bigotry. Taking the role as MC, Gary helped introduce the magical creatures and attempt to calm the crowd when Tabitha had
   Mithra
   attack. After Tabitha was eaten by the dragon and Neron tricked into breaking his deal to allow Ray's soul back, Gary joined everyone in singing a song of hope to generate enough love to revive Nate. Successful in the attempt, Gary left with the other Legends, now an official member of the team.

   Upon returning to the ship, Gary and the team were trapped in the Waverider, so Gary, to entertain the Legends, showed the
   Beast/Slayers
   board game. When explaining the rules, Gary volunteered as the narrator, but watched as John used his magic to make the game real. While the Legends played, Gary and Mick received an intruder who turned out to be
   Kayla
   , who managed to survive Pliny X19, but Gary didn't trust her and tried to warn Mick, but he ignored her. Gary was attacked by a tentacle from Kayla, but managed to break free and rejoined the others to help Mick with his pregnancy.

   When the others were dealing with
   Bishop
   , Gary helped Mick with his pregnancy effects and was excited to learn that he could be the best man. Gary and the Legends watched as Bishop helped deliver Mick's babies.
   Upon learning that John was recruited by Bishop, Gary and the others tried to stop him, but they discovered it was a hologram and watched as John and Bishop stole the ship. With no other options, Gary offered to use
   Galixipost
   to snap a photo of Mick with "fake eggs" to get Kayla's attention. After convincing Kayla to help, Gary and the team returned to the Waverider to save the eggs.

   Gary and the Legends were still processing John's death and later saw several Zaguron eggs fall in
   Texas
   in 1925. After Sara and Ava decided to do the wedding now, Gary and the Legends set up the wedding. Gary encouraged Ava to prepare and was excited to accept that he would walk Ava down the aisle. The wedding was interrupted by Bishop, who freed all the Zagurons, so Gary and the Legends tried to fight them, but they entered the house because there were so many Zagurons. During the battle, Gary and the others obtained magic thanks to Spooner, and the entire team together managed to finally defeat the Zagurons. Gary witnessed how the eggs hatched and devoured Bishop, and later commented that necrian babies are born very hungry. The next day, Gary and the Legends prepared to go to the Waverider, but were trapped in 1925 due to the

   being destroyed, Gary and the Legends tried to use Nate's time courier to catch whoever was responsible for destroying the ship, but failed as the time courier had no power. Gary and Ava remembered a bureau protocol and had to find the bureau's safe in the sheriff's office to get a time courier. The Legends pretended to be a traveling circus to avoid suspicion. Gary used his magic, but accidentally almost burned his hands.

   Upon obtaining the safe, the team realized that Mick had stolen the time courier. After Astra tries to fix the ship, the Legends were to be captured by
   J. Edgar Hoover
   , but they managed to escape into
   John's pocket dimension
   . Gary explained to the team about the pocket dimension. Later, the Legends went out and stole Hoover's car to travel to
   New York
   to find Dr.
   Gwyn Davies
   , who was their only hope to return to his time. After Sara, Ava, Nate, and Behrad faked a robbery calling themselves the Bullet Blondes, Gary drove the car to escape until Hoover intercepted them, but they accidentally killed Hoover. To avoid being guilty, Gary turned into a Necrian to devour Hoover.

  <p key="76722f46-3af7-41ab-9e56-bdb2689d0cb4">
   Gary cast a spell on a bottle so that Nate would take it and have the appearance of Hoover. The Legends managed to get on the train, but Sara and Ava stayed in the pocket dimension with Zari to rest. Because Nate was pretending to be Hoover, Gary and Behrad helped their friend by saying they were his teammates. When Nate was forced to torture the driver to find out if he works for Al Capone, Gary and Behrad convinced him not to act like Hoover. Because Nate went to confront Al Capone's gang, Gary and Behrad asked Sara, Ava, and Zari for help. The Legends managed to avoid a fight, but to everyone's surprise,
   Hoover
   was still alive and attacked the Legends until the team realized that the living Hoover was actually an robot. When the robot exploded, the Legends left in the real Hoover's car to try to get to New York.

   Eddie

  <p key="8dfb8e0e-4620-46f1-bd2d-a4f69b43fb07">
   To make up for their mistake, the Legends used the pocket dimension as a temporary club to get Eddie's club to reopen. Gary tried to flirt with Zari. Gary kept giving Nate advice on how to rekindle his relationship with OG Zari, but Nate rejected his advice. Gary and Nate took it upon themselves to keep watch until Hoover's robot and the thugs showed up. Gary and Nate fought together and beat the bullies. Nate apologized to Gary and accepted his advice. On the train to go to New York, Gary was happy that they would soon travel back in time and had the key to the pocket dimension to take out the Legends when they arrive.

   Upon arriving in New York, Gary used the key to bring out the Legends to find
   Gwyn Davies
   . Gary tried to support Nate in talking to Zari. The Legends investigated Hoover's robot to find out what his goal is. For entertainment, the team ate food from the city, but fled due to Sara being shot. Gary and Sara found Gwyn, whom they mistook for a version of Mick or
   Martin Stein

   Gary met

The Legends infiltrated Gwyn's house to use the time machine, but Sara accidentally erased Gary and Ava from history until Gwyn managed to restore everything. The team was going to travel back in time, but they were saved by
   Gideon

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="8ca9c8da-05e1-4211-af76-ce5c5360b26c">
   For the most part, Gary is a loyal agent of the
   Time Bureau
   , more than keen to carry out his mission. However, he is susceptible to threats, particularly those involving injury or death, in addition to not being a particularly skilled operative on behalf of his Bureau.
   Gary is not the bravest, but he does what he can to support those who he knows can save the day. He is often the butt of jokes, from his coworkers and from the Legends, but he doesn't let any of it get to him, and continues being cheerful. Gary is very awkward and excitable around people which tends to make himself get passed off as annoying. He tends to go on long, meandering, info-dumps that would have a point if the majority of people didn't cut him off. Mick refers to him as the 'Time Dweeb'. He is tentative and a bit fearful around the Legends at first, possibly from being beaten up on by Captain Sara Lance. However, as time goes on, he is shown working together with them more fondly and even "shipped" his boss with Sara Lance.
  </p>
  <p key="1ebc2dbf-a107-4bbc-a6d8-34e6e68fe3da">
   While generally loyal, Gary is not blinded by his fidelity, as he expressed sadness and frustration towards his colleagues at the Bureau and the
   Legends
   for never giving him the respect he deserved. Subsequently, he was easily manipulated by
   Neron
   once the demon pointed out how demanding
   Constantine
   was towards him and was swayed by Neron's gift of his missing nipple, which had previously been ripped off by a
   unicorn
   . He hoped he was considered a "loved one" by
   Ray
   , which he believed could prevent Neron from using his arm to kill him, but Gary knew this not to be the case even before Ray told him he wasn't. He did not like being Constantine's "plant sitter" and always being the butt of others' jokes, leading to his betrayal and decision to join Neron.
  </p>
  <p key="8904b43d-9d10-4a51-870b-c40671c19941">
   Gary is shown to be kind and caring for others. He ignored
   Tabitha's
   persuasions for him to punish the Legends and instead used his wishing powers to try to protect them from
   Neron's
   wrath. However, his inner frustrations came to a breaking point, somewhat, when they failed to understand this, and he decided to make them feel how he felt - like a joke. Despite his valid exasperation, Gary quickly expressed regret for his actions and realized that he wasn't going to solve anything by acting out against them, seeing his conduct was basically the same they did with Gary when they saw and considered him with little significance, indicating that he is quite considerate. He was grateful to be offered friendship and grew a better relationship with Ava and the Legends when Sara revealed that they were initially recruited because they did not matter to the timeline and were effectively "losers", something Gary empathized with.

     Keen intellect:

    Although others view him as an "idiot," Gary is sometimes quite intelligent. He was shown to be a competent Time Bureau member, albeit somewhat disorganized. In addition, when
    Tabitha
    tried to manipulate Gary into torturing the
    Legends
    , he saw through her manipulations and instead used her to hang out with and protect the Legends. Gary was also not fooled when the Legends attempted to manipulate him into not using his Fairy Godmother powers against them by "schmoozing" him.
    Also as a former Time Bureau agent, Gary is able to efficiently sort and complete large amounts of paperwork, assisting others such as
    Nate Heywood
    .
    As Gary is an alien, he is also capable of using various advanced alien technology that most if not all humans are incapable of functioning.
