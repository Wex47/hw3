   to forge her own path after realizing Ra's would never pass
   his mantle
   to her. Nyssa was subsequently left to endure her father's harsh nature alone and grew to despise Talia for her abandonment.
   After Talia left, Nyssa became next in line to succeed her father in the event the prophecy of someone surviving a battle against him didn't come true.

   Nyssa was very mischievous in her youth, having the "panache of a thief". She would often steal extra atayef at meal times and stow the sweets away in her room, but Ra's always found her hiding spots. Nyssa would grow to learn that she couldn't hide anything from him.
   From a young age, Nyssa loathed her father and lived in constant fear of him. She harbored a burning desire to one day kill Ra's and take his place as the Demon's Head. Nevertheless, she was proud of her title as the Daughter of the Demon and a member of the League.

   dying of starvation, having seemingly given up on living. This event was unknowingly orchestrated by Sara herself when a future version of her told her father back in 1960 to send Nyssa to Lian Yu to find her younger self a year after the
   Queen's Gambit
   was sunk. She took Sara in and nursed her back to health and Sara decided to join the League of Assassins. However Ra's never saw Sara worthy enough for the League as Sara never fully renounced her past life, as part of the League's code, and still remembered who she was and where she came from, and Ra's even tried to make Sara leave with a demonstration of his power. However Sara simply laughed whereas others had quaked in fear and from this point on, Nyssa deeply fell in love with Sara.
   At some point, Sara begun to return the affection and they became lovers. Ra's however never approved of Nyssa's relationship with Sara as he saw Sara as weakness to his future heir, knowing that Sara would one day leave the League, either by choice or by death.

   Nyssa's pain is evident in her first appearance, heartbroken that Sara had left her behind, she was more upset over this than any apparent betrayal of the League, she refuses to kill Sara, even when she is offered the opportunity to do so, she finds herself stricken with grief when she discovers that Sara had poisoned herself, rushing to her aid and crying, an ultimate act of "kindness" on her part was releasing Sara from her allegiance and oaths to the League as well as the threat of the League of Assassins; touched by Sara's undying care for her as the woman begged

   not to kill her; despite being on the verge of dying herself, her "friendliness" is also seen in her debut; giving a warm smile and a playful wink to a young boy waiting in line near her at the airport. Nyssa also seems to be very moral as she simply subdued the guards that tried to arrest her during her debut and didn't involve innocent people and simply made her way out after she subdued them.
  </p>
  <p key="2202ddfe-4e03-4ab9-9af6-4c6620539678">
   Nyssa can be just as cold as any other member of the League of Assassins. She acts more so out of personal vendetta than loyalty to the League. She wouldn't kill Sara, but she resorted to kidnapping her former lover's mother in retaliation, she delivers an ultimatum, declaring that she would show Sara how it felt to have someone she loves taken from her if she doesn't return, this act of vengeance for Sara leaving her continues, she feels once again abandoned when Sara would rather die than return to the league, and to her. She declares that if this were to be the case, she would kill Sara's family. However, she quickly abandoned this when she realized Sara would rather die than return to the league and chose to free her rather than letting her die, this implied she still cares for Sara despite them no longer being lovers. Even when Sara agreed to return to the League of Assassins in exchange for them helping subdue
   Slade's army
   , she told

   to draw Malcolm out. When Oliver didn't believed Malcolm did it she quickly considered him an enemy as well, and was prepared to kill him. She had a deep hatred for Malcolm as she was convinced he had killed Sara despite him swearing on his daughter he wasn't responsible, it was later revealed she was partly correct as he had drugged Thea and had her kill Sara. This revelation made her hate Malcolm to the point that despite him now being Ra's al Ghul, she made it clear she is still bent on killing him and tried to do so on all their duels. By the time Sara was resurrected by the Lazarus Pit, much to her horror, as she (correctly) knew that her former lover would only suffer in her new life, though this has since been annulled as Sara was able to regain control of herself, Nyssa's grudge towards Malcolm grew to the point that she literately swore to kill Malcolm in a manner that would have no coming back.

  <p key="4b01fedb-faa5-4422-bdb4-e79441960e22">
   At first, Nyssa had a contentious relationship with

   , since the latter held the former responsible for Sara's death while Nyssa believed Laurel wasn't worthy to wear Sara's jacket. Later though, the two began to grow closer, with Nyssa admitting that Laurel reminded her of Sara and offered to train her in becoming Black Canary. The two remained on friendly terms even when Nyssa considered Oliver an enemy, often sharing their memories about Sara.
  </p>
  <p key="5092d556-5683-45af-9822-5b58c4db40a9">
   Nyssa is proven to be knowledgeable of cultures and respectful even when she is on a vendetta. This was seen when she referred to "Jansen" with the honorable "sensei" before threatening to kill him over Malcolm's location.
  </p>
  <p key="825eeccd-483f-4ea3-8e00-d58942b1e312">
   Despite Nyssa's intelligent and calculating traits, she is prone to allow herself to be emotionally blind, especially when it comes to Sara, she even tried to attack Ra's al Ghul in a fit of rage upon learning he denied her what she believes to be her heritage, according to Malcolm, Nyssa's ultimate dream was to succeed her father, which she lost all chances of doing when she chose a relationship with Sara, Nyssa believes this as well and believed Ra's making Oliver his successor was a way to punish Nyssa (however, this is untrue, as Ra's' reasons for making Oliver his successor, is because he survived their duel and because Nyssa has proven herself unfit to become the leader of the league, as she has time and again proved that she allows her emotions to cloud her judgment) however, Nyssa is not always without compassion or reason, she did spare Thea for physically killing Sara since she was mind controlled by Malcolm to do so. She also put down the sword Thea gave her to subdue Roy and Laurel non-lethally instead of going for lethal methods.
  </p>
  <p key="42d69a51-ac95-4507-ad49-4ae153ce1856">
   While not completely explicit, Nyssa's animosity towards Oliver might be lessening, as she has seen multiple times that she trusts and cares for him, examples include when she willingly listened to his every word when they crashed the plane; her immediately raising her bow to defend her new husband when

   punched Oliver to the ground; and later when she treated his sword wound after his battle with Ra's, notably, Nyssa held no ill-will against Oliver when he killed her father despite wanting to do it herself and even quickly changed the subject to his surviving getting shot due to his league armor, conveying a warm smile during which.
  </p>
  <p key="32614f19-a4ff-4b04-bceb-d2b36191c2c7">
   Despite not being together, Nyssa still sees Oliver as her husband and Thea as her sister-in-law, this is also further proven that they both care about each other when Oliver requests they use an ancient set of rules so that he would have to face Malcolm, instead of Nyssa, Nyssa has demonstrated that though she can be emotionally blinded by her desires she is capable of change as she realized from Laurel's advice that she was turning into her father in her quest to remove Malcolm from his throne, and instead of continue the league's ways she used her newfound authority as Ra's al Ghul to disband the League of Assassins and parted with Oliver and Laurel on civil terms.
  </p>
  <p key="13a44918-a0cf-4b96-a1fa-8afe7b08c377">
   Nyssa has grown to care for Oliver and his team, having gone through the trouble of coming to Oliver to help him when he reached out to her, even going as far as to calling them her friends and that she stands with them when her sister,

  <p key="11c1e5fa-ccd3-4edb-99bd-8a9f8435de47">
   Despite being forced into their marriage, Nyssa still acknowledges Oliver as her husband, even though she does not love him like one, implying that she still commits to vows. This seems to be in an effort to embarrass Oliver as she even told
