   knew the truth, but still loved her like his own.
   Thea was especially close to Robert, thinking the world of him. When she was four years old, Thea found a stray cat and brought it home, firmly declaring it as her pet despite Moira's protests. After Robert came home from work and saw the situation, he sat down with Thea in private and gently told her that the "cat" was actually a tiger, so it needed to be returned home. Thea understood and let the cat outside.

  <p key="2980f93f-1a0c-448f-b003-4699167e5466">
   Growing up, Thea idolized her older brother,

   Every

   Thea was also close to

  </p>
  <p key="bd2d41f8-9b03-4d21-8bad-0104ff37eb78">
   As a child, Thea was very creative and loved to draw and color, to the point that Robert would order her boxes of crayons "by the truckload." Thea would even draw on the walls of her home, much to her mother's fond exasperation.
   When she was young, Thea once fell off her horse, breaking her arm, and was hospitalized.
   When Thea attended her first boy-girl dance at school, Robert disapproved of her dress and terrified her date.

   , much to her devastation. Overtime, Moira became increasingly emotionally distant from Thea out of her own grief,
   to the point that she would refuse to even talk about Robert and Oliver with her daughter.
   Thea was subsequently left feeling alone, depressed, and disconnected from the world. By the time she was 15,
   Thea fell into a life of drugs, partying, and brushes with the law to cope with the void left by her father and brother.

   In February 2010, Thea went to visit Oliver and Robert's graves after school, reminiscing to them about her studies and Moira growing closer to
   Walter Steele
   . Her drug dealer came along and sold her some pills. When Tommy then arrived, he became furious and scolded Thea, who retorted that he wasn't her brother. That night, she snuck into Tommy's 25th birthday party using a fake ID. Briefly catching up with Tommy and Laurel, Thea promised them she would behave. Suddenly, her drug dealer fell from the balcony with his neck snapped (by Oliver). The cops arrived and after Thea gave her statement, she was cornered by Detective

   after five years, Thea was one of the first people to welcome her brother home with open arms. However, she was later surprised and disappointed when he expressed unhappiness and disapproval over Thea's party girl lifestyle, which Oliver himself used to lead.
  </p>
  <p key="b484ab3d-76ca-4605-ae54-eba5f0e9859d">
   A week later, Thea and her family watched a news report on the city's vigilante, "The Hood". She was somewhat intrigued by the figure, in stark contrast with Moira's wariness. Thea then declined to attend Oliver's legal resurrection, snarking that "the first four times of [him] in court was enough for [her]". That night as she prepared to go out partying again, Oliver tried to protest that Robert wanted better for her. Thea simply countered that "dead people don't want anything" and called Oliver out over neglecting his family since returning home. Later, she accidentally entered Oliver's bedroom while he was getting dressed and spotted his scars for the first time, much to her horror. When Oliver admitted he wasn't ready to talk about the island, Thea took her brother to his and their father's graves on the
   Queen Mansion
   's grounds. Tearfully reflecting how the last five years weren't easy for her either, she begged Oliver to let someone, if not her, in on his pain. Thea later attended the groundbreaking of

  <p key="fb890e81-4183-49be-ae64-eab1396c6f87">
   Thea was brought home by the police after a night of drunken partying with her friends that led to breaking and entering a boutique. Unrepentant, Thea suggested her mother shop at the store while paying off the owner and convinced Moira to let her take a sick day from school. The next day, Thea was grounded by her mother for two weeks, much to her frustration. Despite this, she partied at the nightclub
   Poison
   , where Thea bumped into Oliver and two had an argument over the company the former was keeping. Out of spite, Thea disclosed to Oliver that his friends,

   auction to support Walter. When the building was attacked by a
   sniper
   aiming to kill Walter, Oliver urged Thea and Moira to leave with his bodyguard,

  <p key="7e868065-4386-471f-8cb4-4253a8849d53">
   After the auction, Thea bonded with Oliver while watching TV as they discussed Laurel, and how Oliver could get back into her "good-books" again. She advised her brother to just continue to be his "new self". A couple nights later, Thea was surprised to see Oliver smiling, to which he admitted her advice about Laurel was working. Pleased at the prospect of her brother and Laurel potentially getting back together, Thea teased Oliver about letting her know when he wanted to find "trendy places to propose".
  </p>
  <p key="717c0399-30cc-440e-bcfd-834754279538">

   Thea developed a crush on Tommy after he came asking her for romantic advice regarding a girl he wanted to impress. However, the situation became very awkward when she realized Tommy meant Laurel instead of her. Thea ended up getting drunk at a benefit for Laurel's employer,

   , and Tommy took her home. Embarrassed, she tearfully apologized for making a scene, but Tommy and Laurel assured her it was okay.

   Thea called Oliver to remind him that he was supposed to have lunch with Moira, advising him to "bite the bullet and have a Cobb salad with the woman". Later on, Thea went to see her mother at
   Starling Hospital
   when Moira was injured in a shooting. She told Oliver off for leaving their mother to go after the shooter. Thea stayed home that night with Moira after Oliver told her he had a "business meeting". She confided in her mother about how she wishes that Oliver would just tell them what was wrong. Moira suggested they should simply try and understand how much he has changed.
   Thea asked Walter for a ride to school, commenting that they could just buy her a convertible to save them the trouble.

  <p key="5c15d59e-2153-4f51-b3fc-5f68e7cc65cf">
   Oliver talked to Thea about their lack of Christmas decorations, and she revealed how they hadn't really celebrated Christmas since Oliver and Robert disappeared. Thea was later seen at
   Big Belly Burger
   with Oliver, discussing why there was no Christmas Party when Thea's friend
   Shane
   showed up. Oliver later walked in on Thea and Shane at the Christmas Party and caught them making out with some clothes off. Oliver told the boy, "Hit the road", much to Thea's annoyance. Later that night, Thea, Walter and Moira visited the hospital after Oliver was injured in a motorcycle crash. Thea apologized to Oliver for what she said and two agreed to restart their relationship. Thea brought two candy canes for herself and Oliver to snack on as a Christmas gift.

   Six weeks after Walter's mysterious disappearance, Thea was concerned about her mother shutting everyone out, including her and Oliver. She confided in Oliver that Moira was acting the same way as when he and Robert were presumed dead. Thea later tried to convince her mother to leave her room and go out with her. Afterwards, Thea visited Oliver when his club burnt down and wondered why he was smiling.

    Gambit

   instead of Robert. Thea then stormed out, taking her new Maserati for a joyride. However, she was involved in a car crash and taken to the hospital. Oliver later discovered that Thea crashed because she was high on a drug called
   Vertigo
   . After being discharged the next day, Thea was arrested for driving under the influence of narcotics.

  <p key="f4970a3f-e56d-4d7c-81ba-7c835166b30a">
   Due to the rampant use of Vertigo in Starling City, Judge
   Brackett

   so as to take heat off his sister and talked to Laurel about getting her father to use his connections to help Thea. Quentin was able to get Thea a deal where she was put on probation for two years and had to work community service for 500 hours under the watch of a guardian. The plan was for her to work at CNRI under Laurel's supervision. However, Thea stubbornly refused the deal just to hurt her mother. To convince her, Oliver revealed that Robert had in fact cheated on Moira and admitted to not being the father they believed him to be.

   Thea left flowers at Moira's grave and saw Laurel talking to Sara's grave. When Thea wondered why she was here, an emotional Laurel revealed that Sara was involved with some dangerous people and had been murdered, much to Thea's shock. Laurel made Thea promise not to tell Quentin about it. At her loft, Thea bought in an enormous Christmas tree, justifying to Oliver that the smaller the family, the bigger the tree. Oliver revealed he knew Malcolm was with her at Corto Maltese. Thea avoided the subject and proclaimed that Malcolm is one of the few family members she has left. Oliver asked if she flew from Corto Maltese with Malcolm. Thea maintained she did not and asks Oliver to not make her choose between her father and him. Later, Thea was decorating the Christmas tree when the Arrow broke through her window. He demanded to know where Malcolm was. Thea feigned being scared before throwing broken glass in his face. She then kicked the Arrow in the groin and threw multiple blows at him, though he dodged and parried the hits, forcing her to distance herself. Thea ordered the Arrow to stay away from her and her father before escaping by jumping off the balcony. Thea then contacted Malcolm and told him that the Arrow confronted her. Afterwards, Thea lied to Oliver and told him the window was broken by a bird. Oliver tried to warn Thea that she did not know who Malcolm really was and he did not love her because he was incapable of it (having learned he made Thea kill Sara), but Thea remained stubborn. Oliver replied that he was not going to make her choose; there was nothing he would not do to protect her. Confused, Thea hugged Oliver before he left, unaware of his impending duel with

She expressed her worries about Oliver's disappearance and Malcolm assured her he would look into it. Later, Thea returned home from work and found Malcolm waiting for her. He told Thea the city had become dangerous for them, and they must leave.

   Thea met Chase at Verdant, where he asked her if they were good as he started to think she was avoiding him. Thea claimed they were good but held him off when he talked about their shared kiss. Malcolm later showed up in his car and said he expected Thea to pack and that they had to leave. When Thea wanted to know why, Malcolm simply stated she is not ready for the reason, to which Thea replied that she isn't willing to leave the city with him.

Outside the club, Thea met up with Chase and they slept together in her loft. When Chase poured them wine, Thea noticed an odd smell in the wine and revealed she learned that red wine was effective in covering the scent of cyanide. She attacked Chase with a cheese knife, but he effortlessly disarmed her and revealed himself as an agent of the League. Chase tried to slit Thea's throat but Roy saved her. Malcolm arrived and ambushed Chase, who killed himself when he had no way out.

Thea revealed to Oliver she knows he's keeping a secret from her and demanded to know what was going on. Oliver discovered a way to escape by dislocating Thea's shoulder, allowing her to extend her arm and open the prison door. After they escaped, Oliver eventually revealed to Thea that she was drugged by Malcolm into killing Sara. Thea was horrified as she grappled with the truth, realizing Oliver was right about Malcolm all along. Slade suddenly ambushed and held her at gunpoint, but Thea disarmed him. The three of them fought until Thea managed to wound Slade with a gunshot. She considered finishing him off but Oliver talked her out of it, urging her not to become a killer like Malcolm wanted. After some hesitation, Thea ultimately knocked Slade out with the gun, allowing them to imprison him back in the cell. The two returned home, where Thea angrily confronted Malcolm over making her kill Sara and betraying her trust. Thea proclaimed she will train, fight, and work with Malcolm, but he is no longer her father.

   Thea and Oliver continued to train with Malcolm. She still struggled with the guilt over killing Sara and eventually revealed the truth to Laurel. Although shocked, Laurel assured Thea that it isn't her fault, but wondered why she would be associated with someone like Malcolm. Thea explained the situation, regarding the League coming after Malcolm, Oliver, and herself. Thea then contacted the League and made a deal to hand her father over to them. That night, Nyssa and the League showed up and manage to capture Malcolm while he was fighting with Laurel. Thea then informed Oliver about what she did back at her loft.

Suddenly, Roy and Laurel entered and attacked Nyssa (believing that she somehow escaped and was attacking Thea), but she subdued them and left. Thea then went home to her loft and discovered that Oliver has returned from Nanda Parbat with Malcolm. Later on, Laurel came to visit and talk to Thea about the situation. Thea then confronted Malcolm, who was listening to their conversation. Malcolm revealed that he knows Thea is holding a knife, which surprised her. Malcolm ordered her to kill him, but Thea declined. Thea and Oliver discuss Malcolm, Moira, and their past. Later on, Thea visited Roy at his home and asked if she can stay with him for a while, to which Roy agreed. The two began to kiss.

Back at Verdant, Roy told Thea that while he shot the cops, part of him felt "relieved" that he might finally go to jail where he belongs. Oliver came in and apologized to Roy. Just then, the police broke down the doors and Oliver took off as they chased after him. They then discover that all of their assets have been frozen by Quentin so Oliver couldn't escape the city.

     , saying he was her father, she at first rejected Malcolm, as she was disgusted by him and even tried to shoot him; proving that Thea is more like her biological father, then she realizes, however, after Thea learned of Roy working with the Arrow, this was the last straw for her and so she went back to Malcolm. Determined not to feel weak or hurt ever again, Thea sought training from Malcolm, to teach her how to defend herself.

    <p key="afa84c8f-d699-4e5c-b709-ca32a757d50d">
     After six months' training under Malcolm, Thea has become a much more confident, disciplined, emotionally stronger individual and can physically fend for herself as well. Despite Malcolm being a murderer, she has accepted Malcolm as her father and calls him "dad". However, she has also become manipulative in lying about not knowing Malcolm, his training her and avoiding any conversations about him with Oliver. Malcolm's harsh training has turned her in a capable fighter as she is able to act quickly and decisively when cornered. This was shown when confronted with the Arrow, she threw glass in his face and kicked him in the groin after which she escaped. Later on, when Thea finally learns of Oliver's identity as the Arrow, she showed great maturity in accepting her half-brother's vigilante identity, she went back to looking up to him and gracefully praised him for all of the lives he'd saved, for all the good he'd done for Starling City, knowing everything he did was to protect her.

    However, when Thea learns from Oliver that Malcolm had drugged and brainwashed her with
    Vitura
    (a drug that made her extremely susceptible to suggestion) and had her murder

    under his manipulations, Thea is devastated. She is beyond horrified at what she was forced to do. She begins to unravel, holding Slade Wilson at gunpoint on

    , Thea arranges for them to kidnap Malcolm so he faces justice. When Oliver points out, she will feel guilty for what she did, she tried to brush this off, however, her conscience catches up with her, Thea realizes she tried to have her own father killed while wracked with guilt over Sara and coming to regret every decision she's made since accepting Malcolm. She even attempts suicide by

    's hand. When Oliver returns with Malcolm, Thea, feels remorse for what she did to her father, but covered it up, when she said she would turn him over to the league all over again. She laments she doesn't know what she's doing, who she is anymore.

     from killing Oliver, Thea still had no right to threatened the life of an innocent child - this awakened her to the notion that she is more like her father than she initially realized and so, after Damien's death, she retired from vigilantism and refused to return to Team Arrow.

    <p key="c3517023-07ff-45b5-950a-51217a1ee564">
     Thea has lost her sense of morality, pushing reasonable boundaries; such as when she framed
     Susan Williams
     for plagiarism simply because of her dislike for the latter as a reporter or when she revealed that she had evidence to prove that her half-brother, Oliver is Green Arrow, a scheme which resulted not only in Susan losing her job, but her life and reputation being ruined, Thea tried to justify this act by the incentive of protecting her half-brother, only for Oliver to cruelly criticize Thea's actions, pointing out the similarity of her misguided choices to that of their late mother, Moira Queen.
    </p>
    As noted by Malcolm; Thea is short-sighted; as she is incapable of seeing the larger picture.

     Indomitable will/High tolerance for pain/Expert survivor:
    </b>
    Thea was taught by Malcolm to withstand pain by having hot water poured over her hand. By the end of her five-month stay with him, she didn't even flinch when someone accidentally spilled hot coffee on her hand.
    When Oliver dislocated and relocated her shoulder, Thea merely groaned, showing she was able to tolerate this pain as well.
    Thea has also demonstrated great mental strength, able to overcome the brainwashing effects of
    H.I.V.E.
    's drug with her brother's encouragement and regain her independence.

    Since being revived by the
