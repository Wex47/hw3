   As a kid, Rene was caught tagging a building by an at-the-time beat cop,

   Rene graduated from

   Navy, later becoming a Navy SEAL. At one point, he was part of a team transporting a prisoner with valuable information. When intelligence couldn't get anything out of him, Rene took matters into his own hands and tried to beat the information out of the prisoner, leading to him being dishonorably discharged.

   Rene fell in love with and married a woman named

   Zoe

   In March 2016, Rene began to suspect his wife had relapsed and become an addict again, which was proven correct when he found drugs in their bedroom. He and Laura had an argument about this, with Rene threatening to kick his wife out of the house if she didn't become clean.
  </p>
  <p key="eb60ed55-178b-42b4-9037-4d12b5909c6f">
   That night, Rene took Zoe out to a hockey game and when they returned to the house, it was ransacked. Immediately sending Zoe to her room, Rene investigated and found his wife being held at gunpoint by
   her dealer
   , who demanded the $500 that Laura owed him. Rene claimed that the money was in the safe (where he actually kept his gun), and began to reach for it. However, Zoe appeared and unknowingly spooked the drug dealer, causing him to throw Laura on the ground and start shooting at Rene, which left a bullet hole in his hockey jersey. Rene eventually grabbed his gun and killed the dealer, but not before the latter shot a stray bullet that killed Laura.

  <p key="05a7c99f-6a63-4394-bd3f-8d146bbc8a33">
   Guilt-ridden over his wife's death, Rene became depressed and an alcoholic. One night, he passed out drunk while reheating soup for Zoe. She then tried to take the soup off the stove, but ended up burning her hand. Rene was woken up from his stupor by Zoe crying and immediately attended to his daughter. Afterwards, Zoe was removed from his custody and placed in a foster home. Rene was still allowed visitation rights, but only under the supervision of a court-appointed guardian.

   One night while chasing down a drug dealer, Wild Dog tried to jump from one rooftop to another but hit his foot, causing him to fall off the roof. Before he hit the ground though, Green Arrow used a grappling arrow to save him. The archer decided to take Rene under his wing, offering him the opportunity to "become someone else, something else". Green Arrow cut Rene down and left behind the address of a building to meet him at the next day. Rene showed up and met the other recruits,

After a scolding by Oliver, Rene and the other recruits quit their training, not wanting to work with Green Arrow due to his aggressive personality. However, Rene and the others later rejoined the team after Oliver revealed his identity to them all. Rene asked Oliver if he could rethink his code name, but Oliver amusingly replied, "no chance".

   Later, Oliver was looking for details about the new street drug called "
   Stardust
   " and learned it was being manufactured by
   Derek Sampson
   . After he returned to the base Oliver gave instructions not to go looking for any more intel. Rene, knowing where the warehouse that the Stardust drug was being made, ignored Oliver and went to the location, bringing along Evelyn Sharp. He claimed that he was there strictly for intel, but once he knew for sure the drugs were there he jumped down and started attacking the men working for Sampson. After shooting many thugs, Wild Dog fought Sampson one on one. Sampson had the upper hand on Wild Dog and brutally punched him numerous times nearly knocking him out until Evelyn shot Sampson in the shoulder. This distracted him and Wild Dog threw him into a vat of stardust and presumably killed him. The next day Oliver was furious at Rene for not listening to him and killing Sampson, as

   , the district attorney, was close to taking down Sampson and all of his men. Oliver later forgave Rene and apologized for never trusting him and giving him a chance in the field. Later once Team Arrow found out Sampson was still alive and couldn't feel pain, they figured out his plan which was to create an army of men like himself. Oliver decided to bring the new team to stop Sampson in which they succeeded. This was the first time Oliver trusted Rene.

   Rene and the team led by Green Arrow tried to capture

Queen beat up his team and then drove off. For a long time she could not recover and was afraid to act without her leader, but when Tobias Church decided to retake Sergio, the team joined forces again and tried to stop the criminal. Unfortunately, Curtis suffered during the fight, and Wild Dog, wanting to help his friend escape, decided to keep the enemy for some time. Despite his courageous fight, Ramirez fell, and when he woke up he was tortured by Church's men.

  <p key="90da5cba-d1d8-4aac-8ba5-2897012fbe6b">
   While tortured by Church, Rene told him that Oliver Queen was the Green Arrow although he doesn't remember telling Church. He was brought to the woods by Church and his men to dig his own grave, and while there, Church told Rene his plan and why he came to Star City. Church told him his plan because he planned to kill Rene once he finished digging. Oliver showed up moments after killing Church's men and saving Rene, but Church got away. The next day Rene met with Diggle to try and remember anything from his time being tortured, to see if he heard anything about Church's plan. Rene and Diggle bonded due to their similarities and Diggle served as somewhat of a mentor to Rene. He remembered Church's plan and told the rest of the team. This ultimately led to Church being arrested and then murdered by Prometheus for trying to kill the Green Arrow.

The recruits later met at Regan's workshop where they talked among themselves about the team's lies and were clearly unhappy that their mentor was a serial killer.

Rene's target was safe, however, while Artemis's target was attacked by the killer. The latter, seeing that he had to face the Green Arrow as well, fled. Some time later, the recruits showed up at an official charity concert, to which they were invited by the mayor himself.

They were interrupted by a new Vigilante, who intended to kill the criminals. Seeing the threat in the warrior, the heroes decided to pretend to be criminals and attract the man's attention, but he understood their plan and stunned Artemis sitting in the car in front of the building, then beat Curtis and took him with him. At the bank, he demanded a meeting with Green Arrow, threatening Holt to kill him. When the Vigilante was about to make a fatal shot, the archer stopped him and captured him, but thanks to a controlled blast he escaped.

   The entire team attended Oliver and Felicity's wedding, with Rene spending most of his time with Curtis and Dinah. The party made Holt think about relationships and breakup, which led to intoxication. Even so, he was sober enough to catch the bride's bouquet, but was unable to speak normally, and Ramirez decided to take his friend back to his own house. Quentin was kidnapped shortly after, and Cayden James made demands for a power device from the
   <a href="A.R.G.U.S. (Earth-1).html" key="a959d401-5fa1-47b1-a741-bc8c093a8256" title="A.R.G.U.S. (Earth-1)">

   headquarters
   that the vigilantes had stolen. Oliver asked Holt to remake the device, and Holt agreed. Immediately afterwards, it became known that Oliver, Felicity and John were informed that someone on the team was going to testify against the mayor in front of Agent Watson. The three suspected Dinah, whom they rejected from the crew, confessing that they had spied on both Rene and Curtis, leading to an altercation of trust. It turned out, however, that it was Ramirez, whom an FBI agent had pushed to the wall, threatening him that if he did not help,
   his daughter
   would never see her father again. The confession upset Oliver, who kicked the man from the team. A few hours later, after talking frankly with
   <a href="Thea Queen.html" key="6f5b73cf-1b3e-4dbc-9962-d9a96505d81f" title="Thea Queen">
    Thea
   </a>
   , Oliver gave the band a second chance, getting ready to get Quentin back from Cayden's hands. Even though all turned out well, the mayor kicked Rene out of the team for disobedience during the mission, and with him left Dinah, who could not trust the team. Curtis also resigned hours later, admitting he couldn't trust people who didn't trust him. Returning home, Rene picked up his daughter and took her to his apartment, assuring her that he would never leave her.
  </p>
  <p key="18e400f0-93be-4b6e-9e1c-aa8ddce70735">
   For the next several weeks, Rene avoided the rest of the team, thus getting fired by Quentin. The man took full care of his daughter until he was visited by Curtis at the end of January 2018. The men discussed what had happened within the ranks, with Ramirez beginning to feel guilty about what had happened. Some time later, Curtis, Rene, and Dinah were summoned to
   Felicity's house
   , who, along with John, presented them with discoveries that there had been a bedbug in the bunker for several months. Consequently,
   Cayden's team
   , which included Ricardo Diaz, Anatoly Knyazev and Vigilante, knew everything about the vigilantes.
  </p>
  <p key="c9fe4876-0339-494f-a6c6-c259fd48961a">
   After this awkward conversation, Curtis and Rene made their way to
   Ramirez's apartment
   , where Dinah joined them soon after. She decided that they had to form their own band as they couldn't sit with their arms folded. Hours later, the three were invited again by the Team Arrow, and during the meeting Oliver apologized for his behavior, explaining his intentions and expecting the recruits to help him in his fight against Cayden. However, they disagreed, believing that they prefer to be in
   Outsiders
   , where they are appreciated. As a farewell, Holt handed John the repaired chip, then left the rest of the way. The three went to
   the hideout
   Curtis had prepared for their team.
  </p>
  <p key="b980cc59-e5dd-4cb5-b51e-28171575f2a2">
   The Outsiders were working in their hideout when they found out that Cayden James had mastered the city's entire infrastructure and was causing harm to innocent people from a distance. Their thoughts were interrupted by the activation of one of the
   T-Sphere
   , which began targeting the Vigilante itself. The team decided to go to the scene and check everything in order to finally be able to capture the enemy. They found nothing there, however, and returned to the base, where Curtis called Felicity to find out the location of a certain place. Immediately afterwards, they went to an underground link between two train routes, where the two vehicles were racing at each other. As neither Curtis nor Rene could separate the tracks, Dinah started screaming so hard at one of the trains that she finally stopped it.
  </p>
  <p key="2eba3cc0-d138-4e21-8824-394b36fb1d0c">
   Upon returning to the base, Holt told his friends that the information he had had been passed on to him by Vincent Sobel himself, believing that they should trust him. After discussing the details, the heroes unanimously agreed that they should use the information from the enemy, who interrupted the conversation and sent another message using T-Sphere. According to its content, the heroes went to the indicated place, but for safety reasons, they contacted the Team Arrow, with whom they decided to join forces for this one time. Together, they held back Boots's attack on a safe zone of the city, and during the fight, the Vigilante once again proved his worth by killing Sheck in defense of Ramirez. After that, both teams returned to their hiding places, ending their cooperation.
  </p>
  <p key="1a423c97-0407-4b69-8b6c-a2a94c97841e">
   The city was in fear of the recent actions of Cayden James, who continued his activities by murdering A.R.G.U.S. agents during one of the missions. Dinah continued her relationship with Vincent, who continued to feed the Outsiders. During one of the meetings, he was attacked by the Team Arrow, but Wild Dog and Mister Terrific immediately stopped them from being stupid by confessing the truth about the Vigilante. Everyone immediately went to the hideout, where all inconveniences were cleared up. Oliver, however, still did not trust Sobel, but needed him to hack Cayden's servers. Everything went as planned, but as soon as Vincent left the building, criminals caught him, seeing him as a traitor. As soon as the heroes found out about it, they set off to save him. Unfortunately for them, the original line-up of the team preferred to find the discovered bomb, rather than saving the ally, and thus only the Outsiders went to Vincent's rescue. On the spot, however, they fell into a trap and were separated. Dinah crushed the ceiling as she watched the Black Siren murder Sobel on Cayden's orders before her eyes. When Curtis and Rene arrived, it was too late to rescue the ally. Returning to base, the devastated woman thanked her friends that they had gone with her to get Vincent, then headed home.
  </p>
  <p key="4501802b-d1a9-431b-bc2c-aeaf561904e9">
   Realizing that Dinah was pursuing Laurel Lance, Rene and Curtis decided to stop her, but to no avail. Returning to the hideout, the men received a call from John, who informed the allies about Cayden James' plans and the intention to activate the bomb in the evening. He also revealed that they could avoid this by bringing the man's allies alive to a specific place. The heroes unanimously decided that it would be best to deal with the Black Siren first, because Drake is on her trail. As expected, the vigilantes met women fighting each other, breaking them apart. After a short discussion, the heroes split up again to catch Knazev and Diaz. When they were all captured, they immediately went to the assembly point. There Laurel, wanting to upset Cayden, confessed to killing his son and approached him, beginning to insult him. Knowing that the woman was lying, he slapped her, not realizing that the bomb activator was interfering with the meta-gene blocking collar. In doing so, Laurel managed to break free and make a mess, deafening Cayden and allowing the others to escape. The heroes immediately chased the criminals who, despite their best efforts, managed to escape. Cayden himself, however, was caught and arrested. The Outsiders, however, left the bunker, believing that their joint victory still changed nothing. Oliver held Dinah out and told her that she was better than this and didn't need to kill.
  </p>
  <p key="662739e8-f013-4ef4-8fba-b03c43f49432">
   When it became known that the city's 70 million stolen by Cayden James had been stolen again, both the Outsiders and the Team Arrow began looking for answers to who had stolen them. As it turned out, Laurel Lance was behind it all. Both teams started looking for the woman from the place where they last saw her. When the Outsiders returned to their hideout with nothing, the heroes suddenly stormed them, following the clue they found, indicating that the wanted one was in this place. There was a quarrel between the two teams, which resulted in a strong disagreement. Rene took advantage of the opportunity to argue with Oliver and attached a bug to his suit, thanks to which they could overhear their achievements in their search. Thus, after a few hours, they found out that it was Quentin who was hiding Laurel and they set off to the set place after the old team. However, they found out that they were being followed and threw out the bug,

  <p key="0cfa1f6a-bf03-4700-b6f4-d1419e4a3e9f">
   losing the Outsiders. Curtis refused to give up and used an implant implanted in John's hand to track down the vigilantes. When they got there, a fight ensued between the two teams, during which Laurel began to run away with Quentin. Ramirez fought Queen when Holt decided to run after Dinah and stop her from doing a foolishness. He managed to speak to his friend, but Lance took the opportunity to run away. Rene's condition, led to him by Oliver, meant that Rene had to be transported to the hospital as soon as possible. After waiting for a message for several hours, Dr. Schwartz said they needed to transfer the patient to a facility outside of Star City. After a moment, John and Felicity appeared, wanting to know their friend's condition. Curtis unequivocally stated that they have no right to ask about it and are not friends, ending their cooperation, all communication and acquaintance.
  </p>
  <p key="ae587251-4c86-4c7e-8016-6e6d62436070">
   Curtis picked up Rene from the hospital after being away for over a month. Upon entering the house, the man spotted his daughter and Dinah preparing a Christmas greeting. Soon after, the team headed to their hideout, where they began discussing their plans, noting the Dragon's connection to the
   Quadrant
   . So they tracked down the
   Scorpions
   and destroyed the weapons cage, thus trying to provoke Diaz to leave his hideout. Unfortunately, they were attacked by
   Lydia Cassamento
   's men, prompting the heroes to flee.
  </p>
  <p key="fba80a91-25a4-4c59-a046-a14d40e432e0">
   Diggle came to the rescue, who with the forces of A.R.G.U.S. helped friends in retreat. In the hideout, John apologized for the harm he had done to them and for the distrust he had placed in them. The conversation was interrupted by Quentin, who pointed out to the heroes that Diaz was a member of the Quadrant. This forced the heroes to take the next steps, namely to destroy the loaded trucks, but without Ramirez, who could not shake the thought of death and parting with his daughter.
  </p>
  <p key="76659d33-d9eb-4ea9-9887-492a60a4a01b">
   After the mission was over, Curtis visited Rene, wanting to know if he was going to return to the team, but Rene was not entirely sure, worried about leaving his daughter behind. Unexpectedly, Zoe left her room, revealing that she knew the truth about the activities of her father and friends. She wanted him to continue to be Wild Dog because he fights for a home - her home. Hours later, the three watched the news of

  </p>
  <p key="f5bd0938-4841-4e48-b071-f1c16b503135">
   Hours before Oliver's trial, the team wondered in their hideout what to do. After a brief discussion, they all agreed that no matter what they thought about Oliver, his secret threatened their secret and went to court to support Felicity and
   <a href="William Clayton.html" key="26491717-fdbe-415a-ab05-775e046377e5" title="William Clayton">
    William

   . Curtis is the only one who has not been questioned, which allowed him to watch
   Alexa Van Owen
   drown Dinah and Rene being forced by Diaz to tell the truth, under the threat of killing his daughter. Soon after, Diggle brought
   Human Target
   to Star City, who disguised himself as
   <a href="Tommy Merlyn.html" key="31923ac7-f77b-4f85-821f-75ca5b6896a0" title="Tommy Merlyn">

   , and told the story that he was the Green Arrow that the Spartan and Wild Dog later retook from the police. Soon after this, testimony was made by Laurel Lance herself, who stood up for Oliver and did not reveal his secret identity. However, the jury sentenced Oliver, but thanks to Rene, Christopher Chance pretended to be a judge who waived the council's sentence, finding it unfair, thanks to which the former mayor of the city was acquitted. After all, Rene and his daughter returned home and spent time with her when unexpectedly someone knocked on the door. Frightened, Ramirez took the gun and ordered his daughter to lock up in his room. In the end, it turned out that the guest was Oliver Queen himself, who thanked the man for his help and for bringing an ally.
  </p>
  <p key="cb247868-7541-4fa6-8f5e-1e2eba784ee2">
   Rene watched a game with his daughter on TV when armed attackers broke into their home. Ramirez hid his daughter and got rid of the criminals, realizing that this was another step for Diaz. He sent his daughter to the A.R.G.U.S. safe house and met the team in the hideout. The Team Arrow also arrived, the bunker of which was completely destroyed. As both teams had a common goal, they decided to work together. Thanks to the information from Knyazev, the heroes knew about Diaz's transport to the police station, so they attacked the truck. Seeing Ricardo fleeing, Mister Terrific caught up with him and, filled with aggression, began hitting the ground. The gangster quickly broke free and stabbed the vigilante, then quickly escaped, picking up the lost flash drive along the way. The team ordered a retreat, taking Curtis to the hospital.
  </p>
  <p key="1bd1b645-6595-446b-81fa-9e243496a4c9">
   Immediately after that, they began to conclude what was the device for which Dragon had given up on killing the hero. It turned out she could keep a payroll there. They set a goal of getting it and therefore sent Lyla to the police station. Ricardo, however, discovered her cover and attacked her, forcing the heroes to attack the command. They managed to clone the data and make it back to the hideout safe, but spend the next hours waiting for decryption. However, the hideout was attacked by Diaz's unit, which gassed the entire building. Felicity and Oliver ordered the heroes to flee while they themselves waited for full data decryption. Unfortunately, the situation worsened and they too had to flee, blowing up the hideout behind them. After that, the heroes went to the headquarters of A.R.G.U.S., where they found out that the enemy had survived and they were left with nothing. Oliver, however, had a final plan - went to talk to Agent Watson.
  </p>
  <p key="d1dbc7ca-ef44-4d56-91b0-6971afe5e751">
   Oliver made a deal with Agent Watson, and the FBI began working with the vigilantes. Together, they recaptured the command, but they did not encounter Diaz there. Anatoly Knyazev gave them a location, but it turned out to be a mined trap into which the heroes entered. Rene, fearing for his own life, called his daughter and told her that he was proud of her. Ultimately, thanks to Overwatch, we managed to get out of the way and come back on command to regroup and make another plan. Before continuing the action, Oliver expressed his pride with Rene by apologizing to him for everything. From him, too, he heard the kind words that edged the archer. The Heroes then used Quentin to get to Ricardo. The mayor, however, did not want to return without Laurel and turned himself in to the gangster, to everyone's surprise. As Oliver searched for a solution, he remembered the pacemaker in the ex-cop's heart that could track him. Immediately after being located, they rushed to the scene and began fighting the criminals. Ultimately, Ricardo managed to survive and escape the mishap, so the heroes went to the hospital with a wounded Lance. While they waited for news of his condition, Agent Watson arrived and arrested Queen. It turned out that at the expense of the cooperation, the man was voluntarily handed over to the agency, with an emphasis on immunity for other heroes. As if that were not enough, Dr. Schwartz informed the audience of Quentin's death, which broke everyone. When Oliver was transported to prison a few hours later, he pleaded guilty to reporters and cleared Roy Harper and Tommy Merlyn, and asked his friends to fight and not leave the city to their fate.

After refusing to help his daughter, he was approached by Dinah outside of his office, who informed him that Felicity was murdered and reminded him of the Mark of Four that he swore to.

He was visibly disturbed at the fact that the benefactor of the group had Felicity murdered for (seemingly) betraying the group.

     In his former life as a family man, Rene was vehemently against his wife Laura continuing her drug habit long after getting out of the Glades and being in a more stable financial situation. He was blunt, fierce, and dealt in absolutes, threatening to kick
     Laura
     out over continuing her addiction. Rene was also a caring and affectionate father to
     Zoe
     , and began to lose himself after she had been taken out of his custody following Laura's death. He considers himself unworthy to be Zoe's father as he couldn't protect his family from a drug dealer.
For the following years, Rene was afraid to fight for Zoe, believing that he might hurt her. Only at the urging of Curtis and Quentin's efforts, the hero decided to do something.
    </p>
    <p key="5be9a172-5e2c-4fcd-8149-fdb3221f6b30">
     Rene initially saw justice in his somewhat abnormal way. Getting to know Oliver and joining his team, he realized that he was an inexperienced fighter and made many mistakes. Even so, he did not obey the Arrow, believing that he was not taking orders from anyone. After some time, he explained that he could not trust his leader if he did not trust him, which affected his relationship with Queen. Acting on his own, he believed that it was better to murder criminals than to let the police arrest them, explaining that the world would be better without such people. Rene is also extremely hot-tempered and has gigantic stubbornness, as shown by taking Evelyn on a Sampson spy mission, despite Oliver's bans.
    </p>
    Rene hated meta-humans and others with superhuman abilities, believing that while some try to help the world, they only make things worse. However, the situation changed when Flash and Supergirl saved him, seeing exceptions in some individuals. Ramirez was initially unable to get along with Quentin, but their shared problems brought them closer together. The man often says "boom" to the former policeman, even though he knows that he does not like it.

     </a>
     , causing him to make more mistakes. He also doesn't like to take orders from anyone, resulting in him often ignoring Oliver's commands. Rene doesn't like to fight battles without trusting the leader and without the leader trusting him, saying this to Oliver once he revealed himself as Green Arrow. In his work as a vigilante, Rene prefers to hunt and kill anyone who he thinks is bad instead of leaving them to be arrested by police. He does this as he believes that the world would be better without people like them, although his headstrong and impulsive traits cause him to kill and attack criminals without strategy or precision as Oliver does.
    </p>

     This was shown he arranged for a "recon mission" to spy on

     so he would be able to attack them with backup. Not only did he instigate a fight, but he also put himself in a position where he would be able to kill Derek himself and justify it as self-defense, while he would not admit to it. His lack of seeing a big picture when it comes to fighting crime surgically led him to kill Sampson without knowing that the police wanted to build a case against Sampson to get him to reveal other dealers, only seeing it a victory in there being one less dealer on the streets.

     Rene had long since resigned himself from continuing to try to get Zoe back in his custody after being placed in the foster care system. This was until Curtis dug into his past and got in touch with a lawyer, who had enough evidence regarding Rene's competency as a father to start a case to get Zoe back into his life. This showed a marked improvement between Curtis and Rene's friendship.
    </p>
    <p key="e2781891-288e-482a-a749-8b2ce8337014">
     Rene has a habit of calling Quentin and sometimes Curtis, "Hoss". Despite the fact that his wife was killed by a criminal who was using a gun, Rene does not have a dislike for guns, as he still firmly believes that the latter does more good than bad, and can save innocent lives.

     Rene loves his daughter,
     Zoe Ramirez
     very much and would do almost anything for her; such as when he was blackmailed by
     Samanda Watson
     (after she had somehow obtained evidence that he is Wild Dog) to testify against Oliver in court (regarding the latter's identity as Green Arrow) with the threat of him never seeing his daughter again - which he reluctantly agreed to; but he still felt extremely guilty and remorseful for betraying Oliver.
    </p>
    <p key="1f1e44a6-53ab-468d-86ff-019f9f9a2282">
     Rene has a sense of justice, honor and good morals; for example, he did not let
     <a href="Dinah Drake.html" key="e8c5388b-efca-44db-8453-f07791718aea" title="Dinah Drake">
      Dinah Drake
     </a>
     take the blame of being the witness who was (apparently) going to testify against Oliver in court - regarding Oliver's identity as Green Arrow (even though could have evaded blame and kept his status as the actual witness a secret; until Oliver's court date) he refrained from, despite this, he still became completely enraged and disgusted that Oliver, Felicity and
     <a href="John Diggle.html" key="0001dd01-fdd0-4ce4-965f-3165cf55b452" title="John Diggle">
      John Diggle
     </a>
     had violated his privacy, even though they were correct in believing a teammate did betray them, he still felt it is a line that he would never cross.
    </p>
    <p key="8c8bfed8-beef-420c-8d02-a83c1232b934">
     Rene also got tired of John and Felicity in their self-righteous attitudes towards him, acting as though his testimony against Oliver was out of a whim, when they knew full well he did this for his daughter, Zoe and nothing else, later, when Oliver finally apologizes for his (unfair/unjust) treatment towards him, along with Dinah and
     <a href="Curtis Holt.html" key="45b29a20-fb90-4f12-94ea-e2667f33b0a4" title="Curtis Holt">
      Curtis Holt
     </a>
     , despite the sincerity of his apology, Rene could not return to the team, having lost complete trust and respect for the original members of
     <a href="Team Arrow.html" key="bf9208d6-5432-4c81-a790-988dc59dbfeb" title="Team Arrow">
      Team Arrow
     </a>
     - firstly for the violation of his privacy and trust, but foremost because they never trusted him in the first place and did not treat him as an equal (even prior to his role as a witness in Oliver's trial) as he felt strongly that he could not be part of a team where there was no trust.
    </p>
    Rene does not know the difference between bravery or foolishness; for example, during a violent-brutal confrontation between Team Arrow and the Outsiders (regarding the former protecting Laurel Lance from Dinah Drake) Rene went up against Oliver all by himself, the latter asked him one last time to stand down (after he had repeatedly bested him; as it was obvious that he was no match for his former mentor) out of stubbornness, he refused, which resulted in Oliver in Rene being critical injured by Oliver in the process; despite this, he does not hold any ill will against Oliver for putting him in a critical condition in the first place, as he realizes that he brought it on himself, if Rene surrendered like Oliver asked to do, there would be no need for them to go to the hospital.
