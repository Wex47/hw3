      was just 11 years old when
      his mother
      was killed in a bizarre and terrifying incident and
      his father
      was falsely convicted of the murder. With his life changed forever by the tragedy, Barry was taken in and raised by Detective

      , the father of Barry's best friend,
      Iris
      . Now, Barry has become a brilliant, driven and endearingly geeky CSI investigator, whose determination to uncover the truth about his mother's strange death leads him to follow up on every unexplained urban legend and scientific advancement that comes along. Barry's latest obsession is a cutting edge
      particle accelerator

      and
      Cisco Ramon
      , who claim that this invention will bring about unimaginable advancements in power and medicine. However, something goes horribly wrong during the public unveiling, and when the devastating explosion causes a freak storm, many lives are lost and Barry is struck by lightning. After nine months in a coma, Barry awakens to find his life has changed once again – the accident has given him the power of super speed. Thrilled with his new powers, Barry learns how to control them with the help of Dr. Wells and his team. However, keeping his secret from his best friend Iris is proving to be harder than he thought, especially when Joe's new partner,
      Eddie Thawne
      , catches her eye. When
      another meta-human
      attacks the
      city
      , it's time to put Barry's new powers, and himself, to the test.

   , a forensic crime scene assistant for the
   Central City Police Department
   , reminisces about his life of running. 14 years ago, in 2000, he usually ran from bullies, who were picking on others, getting beat up in the process. He was treated by his loving mother
   Nora
   , and being lovingly called "slugger" by his father
   Henry
   . The following night, Barry woke up hearing strange noises and saw the water on his aquarium rising. He went downstairs, and saw his mother being surrounded by what seemed to be a red and a yellow lightning, Nora told him to stay back, and Harry came down too, and urged his son to run. The red lightning engulfed him and next, Barry found himself outside. He started to run back to his house.

   Captain Singh
   , while he acknowledges Barry's skills as CSI, is annoyed him constantly being late. Barry finally arrives, and checks the scene. He determines that the robbers, the Mardon Brothers, fled the scene with a Ford Mustang, that caught manure. Back in his lab, he analyzes the manure to determine, where it came from. Barry's best friend,
   Iris West
   , Joe's daughter (whom Barry is secretly in love with), comes in in order to come with Barry to the
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   , where the cutting edge particle accelerator is about to be activated. Since Iris is not of scientific mind, Barry explains the accelerator to her. His manure analysis finishes, and he gives Joe four possible locations on where to find Mardon brothers car. Joe allows Barry to go to the S.T.A.R. Labs.

Joe and his partner, Chyre, reach the last place on Barry's list and find the car, but get into a firefight with Clyde Mardon. Chyre is hit as Mardon boards a plane to escape. At the same time, something is happening with the particle accelerator. It explodes, causing Mardon's plane to explode. A surge of power from the accelerator escapes into the sky and affects the storm clouds. Barry is in his lab, when suddenly, all the liquid in there starts to float. Then, suddenly, he is is struck by lightning from the affected storm clouds, and he hits upon all the chemicals in his lab and falls unconscious. He is immediately taken to an emergency care, still alive. However, it seems he is flatlining. Iris comes and is terrified for him.

   Nine months later, as he is being looked after by
   Cisco Ramon
   and Dr.
   Caitlin Snow
   in S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry suddenly awakes. Shocked and disoriented, Cisco and Caitlin examine him and alert Dr. Wells. Cisco explain he was in coma. As Wells arrives, he talks with Barry and explains that when the particle accelerator was activated, it ran smoothly for 45 minutes, then an anomaly happened that caused the explosion. Since then, S.T.A.R. Labs has been categorized as class 4 hazardous zone and Wells was reduced to a wheelchair for life and lost his reputation. He also explains that after Barry was struck, the EKG couldn't register his heartbeat, because his heart was beating too fast for it to detect it. He then offered to look after Barry in the Labs, and Iris came to see him quite often. Barry decides to return to the city to see Iris and Joe, despite Wells' objection. He goes to CC Jitters, where Iris works as a waitress. She is surprised to see Barry awake. Suddenly, another waitress slips, and as she does, Barry notices that the world around him seems to be slowing down. It lasts only for a second. Iris then takes him to see Joe. Joe is happy to have him back, and Eddie is also glad to see him. When an arrested man attempts to take a gun from an officer, Barry notices it, and runs to him in split second. Everyone are wondering, what happened, as is Barry. He goes outside, and notices that his hand is vibrating intensely. He moves a short distance with super speed, and smashes a police car rear window. He tries more, and soon he runs a long distance with near supersonic speeds, and crashes into a laundry truck. Elsewhere, Clyde Mardon, who was thought to have been killed nine months ago, robs a bank by unleashing a meteorological storm inside the bank.

   The next day, as Wells, Cisco and Caitlin are preparing for a test with Barry, Cisco explains to him what he experienced yesterday. The world didn't slow down; Barry was moving so fast it only seemed like the world was slowing. Cisco then explains more about Wells and Caitlin and says he makes the toys. Caitlin comes to check on Barry, and he asks, why she doesn't smile so much. Caitlin answers, that after the explosion, her promising career in biophysics ended, her boss is on a wheelchair and she lost
   her fiancé
   as well in the explosion, summing that her face pretty much covers it all. The test gets underway, and Barry speeds himself to speeds not normally possible for a normal human, amazing Caitlin. But as Barry runs, he remembers events from 14 years ago, and loses focus. He crashes into water tanks, injuring his arm in the process.

   Back in the Labs, Caitlin says his fracture has healed itself in three hours. Wells asks Barry what happened, what made him lose focus. Barry explains, how his mother was murdered, when he was 11, and how he saw what seemed to be a ball of lightning, and inside it, he saw a

   , who killed her. Barry goes to see Iris, and sees that she is dating with Eddie. As the two then walk and discuss about it, Iris asks Barry not to tell Joe about it. Barry then sees a car being chased by the police, and as the car passes,Barry sees Mardon inside it. Mardon causes the police cars to be driven off the road, and Barry quickly pushes Iris out of the way, and then runs after Mardon. He enters the car and flips it over. Mardon survives and escapes by creating a thick fog. Due to the fog, a car crashes and its driver is killed. Joe arrives and is angry at Iris and Barry for being here. Barry talks with Joe about what he saw, but Joe doesn't believe him, like he has never believed Barry about the true circumstances surrounding his mother's murder. Joe tries to explain that his father is guilty, and Mardon is dead, causing Barry to leave. Eddie arrives with a sketch of the bank robber, which looks exactly like Mardon.

   Barry returns to S.T.A.R. Labs, and angrily claims he wasn't the only one who was affected with the particle accelerator explosion. Wells admits, that when it happened, many different substances escaped, such as
   dark matter
   , giving normal humans special abilities, which they have branded into "meta-humans". Barry feels Mardon needs to be stopped, as he can control the weather, but Wells denies it, claiming that only Barry matters, since inside him can be answers to many of the world's problems. Barry disagrees with his new friends since an innocent man died and runs . While remembering how his father was arrested for Nora's murder, despite pleading innocence, Barry ran 600 miles to Starling City.

   While in Starling City, Barry tells his story, from the lightning striking to that day's events, to

    Oliver Queen/The Arrow
   </a>
   while on the city's rooftops. Believing the lightning chose Barry, Oliver advises Barry to use his newly-given powers for good, as he can inspire people in a way that he as the Arrow never could: watching Central City like a guardian angel, saving people in a flash. Finally, he suggests Barry follows his own advice: wear a mask. Barry expressed his awe by Oliver's exit, swinging away with his arrow gadgets, likewise with Oliver impressed by Barry speeding away. With his confidence restored, Barry runs back to Central City.

   Barry talks with Cisco and Caitlin, having realized that many of the meta-humans have been busy for nine months. He feels he needs to stop Mardon, but he needs their help. Cisco, exited, introduces Barry to a suit he made for firefighters. Caitlin then notices how atmospheric pressure just dropped at a location outskirts of the city. At that very site, Joe and Eddie arrive, and find Mardon. Mardon unleashes his powers and knocks Eddie out. He then proceeds to create a tornado and directs it to the city. As Joe is about to be hit with large debris, he is saved by Barry. To stop the tornado, he tries to run around it in the opposite direction. Caitlin doesn't think he can do it, and Barry does fail. Wells arrives and admits that all of this is his doing, but claims that Barry can stop this and says "Run, Barry, run!", and Barry runs again, this time succeeding. Mardon attempts to shoot Barry, but Joe shoots Mardon first. He is shocked to see what Barry just did.

   The next day, Joe asks if the lightning bolt did this. Barry says more or less, and Joe finally believes, that Barry did see something 14 years ago, and that Henry is innocent. Joe also demands that Barry won't tell Iris about any of this, as he wants her safe. Barry goes to Iron Heights prison to see his father. While Barry is going to get Henry out, Henry encourages him to move on, which Barry can't do. Barry tells him he is proud to be Henry's son.
