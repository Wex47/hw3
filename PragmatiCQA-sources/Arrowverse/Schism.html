   The scene opens with Darhk threatening to slaughter Donna if Felicity doesn't assist him with Rubicon, yet Team Arrow upsets him. A firefight breaks out between Team Arrow and a few Ghosts, and Darhk is going to target Felicity again when Oliver comes to get down to business with him. Darhk is showing signs of improvement of Oliver when Thea comes in with a bolt to Darhk's girl's throat. Darhk releases Oliver, takes his little girl and Felicity's PC, and makes his departure. In the tussle, Curtis is harmed and they take him to the Lair, where Felicity begins attempting to make sense of how to close down Rubicon.

   In the Lair, Felicity tracks her PC to a place of business downtown, and the group advances there to search for it. They show up to find that the GPS tracker is on a gathering table, not joined to the PC — and that 15,000 rockets are presently noticeable all around, with around two hours to stop them all.

   Felicity sees that there's one rocket specifically focused on Star City, which will show up in a short time.

   At City Hall, Darhk's little girl is frightened of his sanctuary, and misses her mother. Darhk guarantees her that it's only somewhat longer before they'll see her.
