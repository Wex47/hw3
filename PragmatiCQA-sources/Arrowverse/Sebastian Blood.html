   Sebastian Blood was born and raised in the crime-riddled neighborhood in

    Starling City

   known as
   the Glades
   . His father,
   Sebastian Sangre
   , was an abusive alcoholic who would often beat Sebastian and his submissive mother,
   Maya Resik
   . Sebastian was terrified of his father, so much so that he would often have nightmares in which he envisioned the man in the image of a skull. At some point, Sebastian befriended a teenager named
   Cyrus Gold
   and his mentor,
   Father Trigon
   .
  </p>
  <p key="de8e1c5f-b441-4860-a59c-fc79309ae7f1">
   One day on May 15, 1986 when Sebastian was nine years old,
   his father came home extremely enraged and threatened to kill Sebastian and his mother both with a gun. Two men in masks, who were actually Cyrus and Trigon disguised as the Acolyte and the Devil, broke in and fought Sebastian's father. Sebastian got a hold of his father's gun and, at Trigon's suggestion, shot him dead, yet let his mother live. When the police arrived, Maya received the blame for her husband's death and was arrested, eventually sent to
   St. Walker's Hospital
   . Sebastian was then placed in
   Zandia Orphanage
   .
  </p>
  <p key="2cbcb070-6494-439a-9fba-627bf78de4ba">
   At the orphanage, Sebastian met with Cyrus, now a preacher, who he began to view as an older brother-like figure. One day when Sebastian couldn't take the nightmares of his father, he created a skull mask made the same way he saw his father in his dreams, as a means of conquering his fears and to remind himself to never give up. The mask was placed upon him by Trigon in a ceremony, where Sebastian officially became a member of the
   Church of Blood
   as Brother Blood, swearing to protect the poorest of the city and the orphans of Zandia, no matter of the cost.

   Daily
   and other Zandia orphans. Despite Sebastian becoming the new leader of the cult after
   Roger Trigon
   's death, Slade became the man behind the man, always having some degree of power over him, making Sebastian cower in his presence. Sebastian also became associated with Slade's right-hand woman

Later, he meets with Slade and Isabel at Queen Consolidated but argues with Slade, furious that Thea's kidnapping has resulted in a sympathy vote for Moira that will all but assure her victory in the election which he let happen. Sebastian demands to know his obsession with the Queens, which Isabel finds amusing that he doesn't know, and demands that Slade fulfill his promise to give Sebastian control of Starling City. However, Slade angrily insists that he is keeping his promise before leaving to continue his plot to destroy the Queens.
   Moira visits Sebastian in his office to tell him that she is dropping out of the election, which confuses him; however, he understands once Moira tells him that she needs to be with Thea as she is going through a tough time.

However Oliver, knowing Slade better, insists that he will not deliver on his end but Sebastian dismisses it. Later Brother Blood addressed Slade's army and tells the troops that they will become a vital part of the Starling's future before unleashing them on the city.

However, as Sebastian and Spencer watch the attack on the news then a member of the army slaughters his entire office staff including Spencer, the soldier telling him that he doesn't take orders from him. Sebastian later angrily confronts Slade and Isabel about the attack reminding him that he was meant to call off the attack.

Oliver and Diggle arrive in his office where he reveals his childhood trauma and the origins of his mask before giving the cure to them and promising to fix the city once he wins, seeking redemption.

   Due to the abusiveness of his father, Sebastian was a scared, frightened child but used that fear as motivation to fix his home city at any personal cost but his childhood trauma clearly damaged him as it drove him to megalomania. Sebastian was shown to be charismatic and commanding, being able to win over crowds so large they wanted him to become mayor and branded his name on walls. Though he initially resented Oliver due to his family's involvement in the Undertaking, sometime later he apologized for once it turned into a riot, and he slowly began to form a friendship with the billionaire as they both wanted to fix Starling City. He also became close friends with,
   <a href="Laurel Lance (Earth-1).html" key="76952820-23ac-4576-8fa5-c94bbfbfecc6" title="Laurel Lance (Earth-1)">

   , though she always thought something wasn't right about him (it was later revealed that the only reason why he became friends with Laurel, was because

   ; therefore, he did not truly care about Laurel). However, he was also a cult leader who was a ruthless, cold, sadistic and megalomaniac to his subordinates, one who cared little for body counts to further his own needs. He also used his own personal skull mask as a means of intimidation and inspiration among his followers.

  <p key="a52be931-5d40-4292-9db9-2a4eafc4990e">
   Sebastian's plan was to use an army of Mirakuru soldiers to worsen the already broken state of the city, to cause enough damage to make the whole city suffer, so when ready Sebastian would command the people to rebuild Starling City into a better city, one stronger, with no economic unbalance or poverty. Upon being elected mayor, it became ever more apparent that he was a megalomaniac, truly believing that his plan was what's best for Starling City. However, ultimately he truly desired to help the people of Starling City and upon realizing Slade would destroy the city and kill everyone in it, Sebastian immediately betrayed Slade by giving the Mirakuru cure to Oliver, expressing remorse for what he did to Oliver as he confessed his childhood trauma and stressed his desire to help people, regretful of how he ended up causing Starling City to be on the verge of destruction. Ultimately achieving at least a measure of redemption, when he was killed by
   Isabel Rochev
   , Sebastian declared his love for Starling with his last breath, confirming that despite his obvious megalomania, he truly had Starling City's future at heart. His act of selflessness lead to Oliver's victory over Slade. Oliver himself acknowledged this as after his death, he referred to Sebastian as a "friend", showing Sebastian had managed to earn Oliver's forgiveness in the end.
