   When John was 15 years old, he was introduced into the occult world by Anne Marie. He learned various spells and became an exorcist with the hopes of one day using his powers to resurrect his mother. John became a figure of respect among the dabblers of magic and began leading the
   Newcastle Crew

   One night, John attempted an exorcism on a young girl named
   Astra Logue
   by summoning the demon
   Nergal
   , only for the demon to kill Astra and drag her soul to
   Hell
   , damning her for eternity, an action which damned John's soul for Hell upon death. Overwhelmed with guilt, he initially retired but after hearing of the Rising Darkness from the
   angel
   Manny
   , John returned to face this threat, with Manny giving him hope that, should he succeed, John's soul may be spared eternal damnation. While hunting
   a hunger demon
   , which he suspected may be connected to the
   Rising Darkness

   While helping the Legends return the

   Loom of Fate

   Loomworld

   soul token

   John Constantine was born in
   Liverpool
   ,
   England
   on 10 May 1982, as the only son of
   Tommy Constantine
   and
   Mary Anne
   . His mother died giving birth to him, causing his father to develop a deep resentment towards John, whom he derisively referred to as "killer" his whole life. Whenever Tommy came home from drinking, which John stated was "every night", he would physically abuse his son, reminding him that Mary Anne died because of him. Also, to punish John, Tommy would put out cigarettes by burning them on his arms.
  </p>
  <p key="1bb4ae6c-2596-4bbe-a1c0-98150632ae2e">
   John had an
   older sister
   , although she eventually abandoned him for unknown reasons.
  </p>
  <p key="9c0c4528-db9b-4c60-90b3-19cb5f314490">
   During his childhood, John met and befriended a girl named
   Natalie
   . The two would play together while wearing masks and telling stories about the mythical
   Loom of Fate
   , and how they would use it.

   . The main goal was desire to gain more attention from girls, but they only managed to release one album.
   When he was 15 years old, John met a girl named
   Anne Marie Flynn
   , who introduced him into the occult world. The two also became lovers for a time.
   John then began reading every book he could find on the occult, learning how to conjure dead beings in the hopes of one day conjuring his mother.
  </p>
  <p key="f73680ec-f0d2-4c73-a484-ac6369fb682c">
   At some point in John's life, he met and became friends with both
   Chas Chandler
   and
   Esrin Fortuna
   , the latter of whom he eventually came to owe a substantial sum of money to.
  </p>
  <p key="59d132b7-2b4c-4fb9-818c-2a960bafce19">
   In adulthood, John's friendship with Natalie developed into a romance. However, they broke up when he chose practicing magic over their relationship.
  </p>
  <p key="17505664-0427-4e7e-8d88-e4d8f120f230">
   John and Chas spent their time in one of the bars getting drunk in the process. When John decided to go out with a girl he met, he asked his friend to pay the bill for him again. At the same time, John cast a
   protective spell
   on Chas, fearing that he might do something to himself by returning to his family. Before leaving, Chas wanted to listen to a song by a certain band that ended tragically. The pyrotechnic effects set off a fire that occupied an entire building. The man began to help people evacuate, but did not manage to save all of them and himself.
  </p>
  <p key="fb48828f-ec20-4f78-9df9-c22e0bcc39f9">
   However, Chas woke up in the hospital with his family. After leaving the facility, he met with John, trying to understand the whole incident. He showed him the newspaper of the 47 people who died in the fire, declaring himself a victim - the 48th. It turned out that the spell John cast on Chas caused his body to swallow up all the dead souls. It was because of this that Chas's relationship with his family deteriorated and his wife divorced him. Chas followed John's advice and, unable to live normally with the souls of others, decided to fight evil alongside his friend in order to repay the gift and use it in a good way.

   John once had a brutal encounter with
   Fennel
   and a sorcerer named
   Felix Faust
   . He survived, but left Faust with a grudge against him.
   John also became bitter enemies with voodoo priest
   Papa Midnite
   after several nefarious dealings.
   At one point, he came to learn of
   Damien Darhk
   , a practitioner of dark magic who was the leader of
   H.I.V.E.
   . John grew to fear Darhk so much he considered leaving whatever city the latter sought to destroy as a preferable option to facing him.
   John once put
   Beebo
   under a spell that made the toy sentient. Apparently, Beebo told him things that "will make your toes curl".
   Over the course of his adventures, John found the
   Grim Reaper
   in person and stole his
   sickle
   for unknown reasons.
   He also met a "
   Swamp Thing
   " in
   Maine

Reiter presented Oliver with a map John possessed and after confirming his knowledge of their locations, John performed a spell to free himself from his handcuffs and held Oliver at gunpoint and used him as leverage to escape Reiter's compound. He had Oliver forcibly take him to the area he sought and performed a spell to uncover the hidden passageway, much to Oliver's shock.
  </p>
  <p key="3bcbd4f7-1921-418d-aae5-9d98afa14a8a">
   Once inside, they explored the cave where John explained that there are areas of the world as old as it including Lian Yu, possessing things corrupt men aren't supposed to have such as Reiter. John eventually found what he sought and retrieved it but set off a trap which Oliver saves him from being killed by, insisting he's not one of Reiter's men. After exiting the cave John thanked Oliver for saving his life and broke off the crystal from the rod to give to Reiter, as the rod itself is what contains the magic. John also warned Oliver about Reiter, insisting his narcotics aren't his only interest for being on the island. As insurance, John also used the rod to transfer a spell on his arm onto Oliver's torso, insisted he'd know what to do when the time came and on Oliver's request, John punched him out cold as part of his "escape" and left on his boat, but the two would keep in contact.

As John was about to free Furcifer, Liv discovered that it was not Astra, but a demon disguised as her. Learning this, John performed an exorcism and sent the demons back to Hell. Liv then left John's company to go and live with a friend, but not before performing a scrying ritual on the map of the United States, leaving lots of blood on the sources of the strengthened dark magic. Meanwhile, John made the decision to help Manny to discover the nature of the thing that was causing the supernatural world to go wild. He and

She tried to sic Coblynau on Constantine but forgot the fact that Coblynau is spirits of dead miners, which allowed John to summon her own husband as one, to take its revenge on the one who killed him.

They broke into the morgue, where an exorcist, using the hand of glory, temporarily resurrected the dead body of a deceased friend, who gave Constantine the last of his strength, saying that a vinyl voice had done so to him, and mentioned "Moonrise."

   Following that, the two realized that their next stop should be the old Moonrise Records where Bernie used to work. According to the information found, its owner,
   Marcus Mooney
   , was still alive, so they decided to visit him. Thereby they found themselves on the Devonshire nursing ward, where they forced the nurse into the patient's room with an enchanted card. Zed and John started a conversation with Marcus, who told them the story of
   Willie Cole
   , selling
   the Devil
   's soul, and
   the vinyl
   he had hidden. He also mentioned that a detective had visited him some time ago, who asked about the same thing, and that he had read the name "Fell" on the sheet. Suddenly, Marcus had a seizure, and when they all ran out to call the nurse, time stood still, which Constantine was the only one who didn't notice. Manny stood over the bed of the dying producer and took his soul. Soon after, Zed and John broke into the Fell's house. The exorcist believed that a musician,

   Papa Midnite
   , whose people had stunned the exorcist. When he awoke, he was tied to a metal gate, and the enemy injected him with an anticoagulant, then cut his arm open. He decided that he would follow his lead, but did not intend to kill him, and would return to him if the hints were incorrect. Soon after, Zed found John at the dump, where she chased away the stranger who was trying to kill him.

   After Chandler's arrival, the three of them followed the trail of vinyl victims, and even more. They got a chance to reflect the album only thanks to the vision of Martin, which saw a white tiger, thus pointing to the local radio station. As Zed and Chas tried to cut off the transmit signal, John decided to fight the main problem by getting inside with the headphones. These, however, did not quite work, but fortunately for him, Midnite burst into the building, destroying the speakers and demanding a CD from his people. However, they did not intend to do it, and this opportunity was used by Constantine, who sent the vinyl to
   Hell
   with a spell, which angered the criminal. However, he did not have time to take revenge as the exorcist escaped. Immediately after that, the team returned for Anton, whom she had brought to the Fell's house. She forced him to eat the contract, which was tantamount to undoing his terms and restoring Jasmine's health and bringing back Ian's illness. After that, the team returned to Atlanta, where they found a moment to rest.

   John spent the day with Zed in the park, trying to show her that her senses were extremely vulnerable to external stimuli. Their conversation about drugs was interrupted by Manny, who stopped time to talk to Constantine about the recruit. He wanted to know if the girl was aware of the threat she was facing and if she could handle it all. After Manny disappeared, John decided to return with Martin to the mill, where the exorcist noticed a sloppy break-in. He knew, however, that the criminal had no chance to escape thanks to Jasper's security. When they entered, they found John's old friend
   Gary Lester
   in an
   anti-gravity trap
   . Gary explained why he came to
   Atlanta
   to stay with Constantine. The reason was his addiction caused by Astra's death, which caused him to party so much that he ended up in
   Sudan
   . When he came to his senses, on one of the streets he met a boy,
   Okot
   , in whose body
   a demon
   was hidden. Gary decided to drive him out, which he succeeded, and then locked him in a jar that he tried to transport to John.

   At the airport, however, there was a problem whereby the demon broke free and started killing. Constantine left Zed with Lester and decided to investigate who he was dealing with. When John returned, he explained that they were battling the hunger demon that was using the host, and when it weakened, he would use another. Martin handed the exorcist drawings of the boy she had seen through visions after touching Lester, and Constantine decided to visit the shaman. To this end, he contacted a friend,
   Nommo
   , who promised to help him. With the help of special drugs, he showed him what he knows with his eyes. He drew him a story of how the shaman of a village,
   Samir
   , chose a young boy to trap a demon in him and save the village from starvation. He noted that the symbols on his body must be precisely painted with a special tool that he can find in the museum. When John returned, after a short conversation with Martin, he realized where his friend had gone.

  <p key="a65e1f50-7f00-43bd-96ad-355c501a929f">
   He found it not long after that with two drug dealers who were beating Gary. The exorcist offered them a drug from Nommo in exchange for the freedom of a friend with whom he immediately went to the bar to talk frankly. Seeing on TV that the demon stopped at the cinema, they decided to defeat the beast together. On the way, however, they were forced to break into the museum and divert attention to get the shaman's blade. At one point, time stopped Manny, who asked John if he really knew what he was doing. After Gary got the item he needed, they went to the movies together, stealing two ID cards on the way. There, they saw a demon in the body of a man eating popcorn.

  <p key="78fc906b-ad4f-4229-9d8a-5e0d872fdf73">
   It was then that Gary realized why he was alone with John here - a demon cannot be trapped in any vessel but in another human. Lester thought it over and decided it might be the best death of his life, the best end to his miserable life - he finally felt needed. In the end, he agreed, so Constantine proceeded to cast the spell. As soon as the demon chose Gary as its next host, John used the blade to engrave protective symbols on his face. Immediately after that, he took him to the mill, where he found Zed. The girl was angry at the exorcist that he had tricked a friend who only wanted to be like him. He only shouted that Gary knew what he was writing for and had Martin set up a room at the end of the long corridor. After taking Lester there, John tied his screaming friend to the bed and sat next to him, holding his hand. It was difficult for him, and after a while Manny showed up. This time he did not stop time, but knelt in front of the bed and stared at the suffering man.

   John was trying to repair one of the artifacts while Zed had been trying to combine her visions with the bloody map for more than two hours. While Chas was preparing a meal, Martin's visions unexpectedly returned. She saw

   New Orleans
   . After arriving, the three were the first to go to the mysterious alley where something paranormal happened last night. They found nothing suspicious, but did meet Detective Corrigan who was skeptical of "a bunch of occult freaks." But he knew what had happened in this place lately was not normal, and he took the business card from Constantine. Soon after, Zed and John checked into the hotel where the exorcist revealed that he was furious that he didn't know anything about Martin. The latter revealed that she did not like wine and headed towards the elevator. When the door opened, the empath saw the street and a broken tree, and then a car racing towards her. Constantine quickly realized that they were currently dealing with two phenomena, so he decided to notify

   Philip Carlberg
   's hitchhiker before his death. After a while, Corrigan himself arrived, arresting Constantine, suspecting him of being involved in the accident. While his friend was away, Chandler made sure that no one in the alley was hurt. Constantine was being questioned by Jim at the police station. The detective realized that the exorcist was right and presented him with the files of
   a model who committed suicide
   5 years ago and a boy who died in an accident 3 years ago. John decided it would be good to meet the victims' relatives, as they might know something. He himself went to see
   Tammy Fraser
   , a former model linked to Misaki's suicide, while Zed contacted
   the hitchhiker's grandmother
   . They both revealed that they had recently contacted a certain Papa Midnite, whom Constantine decided to visit. When he found his whereabouts, he interrupted one of his rites and tried to explain what he was doing. The latter, however, angry with him because of the last meeting, put him to sleep and ordered him to be hidden in the trunk.

   Papa Midnite

   Madeline Devereaux
   , where he also met
   her late husband
   , who was in fact a life-draining
   spirit
   . Therefore, he decided to accept John's offer and work with him, but John in return wanted to contact Hell with the help of his sister, after executing the plan. Soon after, Papa and John harvested the bodies of the summoned spirits to perform a ritual that sent them back to where they had come from. Immediately after that, they tried a ritual that didn't work. The men started arguing, then realized what was blocking them. So they asked Corrigan to bring their relatives dead. During this time, both Zed and Chas took care of the remaining ghosts. When the detective was found, John explained that in order for everything to succeed, loved ones must forgive the dead and come to terms with their death. Immediately after that, they resumed the ritual, which this time brought the intended results, getting rid of the ghosts. Shortly thereafter, John was drinking whiskey with Papa, and their truce was to end after the drink. Constnatine asked Midnite to ask the sister about the Coming Darkness, but the sister only revealed that no matter how much heart John puts into the fight, he would still lose, because someone close to him was involved.

   John, after an intoxicating night with Nora, was awakened by her, who in a hurry and fear began to drive the man out of the house. She informed him that her boyfriend was coming soon and needed to go quickly, then she gave him the clothes and let him out the window. After this incident, Constantine went to the mill, where he prepared himself breakfast. Chas, in Zed's absence, decided to help John in the next steps, despite his reluctance, and traveled to

John tried to force him to say what had happened in the house, but he could not do so, explaining that after giving free will to humans, angels were forbidden to interfere in events. The exorcist investigated the matter further, discovering that the girl who survived the attack was controlled by an entity inhabiting her body. Meanwhile, in another house in the same town,

   That same night, Henry began to set traps in the house, one of which was climbed by the father, who did not see the suspect in the son. John and Chas, on the other hand, decided to return to the mill, where they tried to find a trail. There, the exorcist saw that all similar killings were on one geomagnetic line, which allowed them to predict the next victim. Immediately afterwards, John was looking for something to capture the beast when, in the artifacts, Chas found the Sword of Night that forced the user to tell the truth. Thus, he accidentally revealed that John was too self-righteous and that his wife had departed from him.

After a short time, the accusations were withdrawn by Clarie, who saw the change in her son and wanted to know how to deal with it.

After she did so, she met Constantin and Chase in one of the abandoned houses nearby, who were going to help with the ritual. It was the home of the first tragedy of its kind, to which John intended to bind the spirit. Unfortunately, the trial was unsuccessful. Chandler had the idea that Marcello was never possessed, he only killed his parents himself. So they decided to go home, but the boy started to run away, stunning Daryl. John chased him and caught him in the Fear Room, where he drove the Panneti spirit out of Henry's body, which he then gave to his parents. As it turned out, Marcello murdered his parents himself, but the act was so traumatic that the soul left the body and began to kill.

   When Zed returned to the mill, she began telling John about what had happened to her. The exorcist became interested only after a friend mentioned the vision. So he saw a connection between the stain on the bloody map at
   Briarwood

   Zachary
   was preaching. They have witnessed the things he does, including the healing of the old man's eyesight. John also noted that Zed was an unbeliever, but their discussion of faith was interrupted by a preacher who began speaking in
   Enochian

   angels

   After mass, they decided to line up to Zach only for Zed to touch the man and learn something more through the vision. So it happened and the girl saw the hand extended towards the angel. This made Martin believe that the preacher's actions were right, but John showed otherwise by going to the great pond where all the
   animals
   in it died. For he knew it was a sign that something was wrong here. Soon after, Constantine was surprised by Zed's efforts to summon the Angel. The girl jokingly thought that he should ask nicely, and not perform rituals. When Manny finally showed up and found out about the Enochai-speaking preacher, he gave John a little hint, bending the rules of the Most High, then disappeared. Thus, the exorcist with the help of the confused Zed, using echolocation, tracked down
   Imogen
   - the angel whose feather was torn out by Zachary, which caused her to fall to the ground. They took her to a safe place, where Manny appeared after a while. It turned out that if the angel did not get her feather back, her soul would expire and she would cease to exist. So they decided to recover it, putting a protective spell around the shed before.

   Meanwhile, on his porch, Zachary was arguing with

Angry at her sister, he ordered her to get out and never come back to his community. Some time later, the preacher was visited by Constantine, who was trying to collect the pen. The latter, however, inadvertently rejected the exorcist with a shockwave and ordered him to leave his home. As John returned to the tent, he noticed a man healed by a preacher attacking Zed. At the last moment, he managed to kill him, saving his friend. They both returned to the angels shortly after, interrupting their conversation about the suffering Imogen had experienced. For Manny wanted to know what it was like to feel pain. Knowing that the angels were short of time, John and Zed came up with a plan to try to support the preacher's compassion so that during a mass baptism in the lake, the woman was able to retrieve the feather.

It was then that Zachary realized his mistake and said that it was all his fault and that everything could have turned out differently had he not killed a man by accident one evening. Thus Constantine realized that they had made a mistake, because Imogen is not an angel of Heaven at all, but of Hell. So he decided to run to the shed and stop Zed, but when he arrived it was too late. Imogen showed her true form, the Fallen Angel, and tried to run away, but the previously created protective spell prevented her from leaving the shed. As it turned out, she herself put a feather in the preacher's hand in order to be in the human dimension and then be able to live in it. Knowing there was no way out, she grabbed Zed and was ready to kill her if John didn't pull the spell. The exorcist knew he could not stand up to its power and pleaded with Manny for help, who could not interfere with the events. The Angel, however, could not allow this to happen, and took over Martin's body, tearing out Imogen's heart, killing her. Soon after at the mill, Manny admitted to John that he was facing the consequences of his actions, but he knows that he did the right thing.

   , whom he had summoned into his body, regenerating the wound and thus chasing away the terrified Invunche. After a while, Manny appeared at the exorcist, who was furious that he did not ask for help, but let the demon take over his body. He admitted that it's not like he can't help him - he just won't do it now. After the angel disappeared, Chas found John and pulled him out of the sewers. John told Chas how he survived the meeting with the Invunche, revealing that he was now possessed. He gave himself a few days before the demon completely took control of him, but admitted that if he failed to perform the planned self-exorcism, he would have to be killed. Suddenly, John began to deteriorate and he attacked Chandler and ran away. It wasn't long before Constantine began to recover, and there were many dead gangsters with torn limbs around him. Behind him stood the police, which arrested the man for mass murder. They took him to a local prison, where he met
   Stanley Gibson
   from the British consulate, who explained the whole incident to the exorcist. The man, however, could not help John, so he pounced on him, stealthily taking his wallet, and was led out by a guard.

   John became acquainted with the prison trader Julio, who promised to take him to the chapel in exchange for the official's previously acquired wallet. On the way, the body of the dealer was taken over by Manny, who wanted to talk to the exorcist for a while. Constantine honestly admitted to him that he was afraid to die and was not yet ready for it. When

    Julio

   led him to the chapel, the man realized that he had been exposed to the Santa Muerta gang who wanted to avenge their murdered colleagues. It was then that Pazuzu woke up in the man who had torn the prisoners to pieces. When he woke up, he was in the prison square, where he hailed himself as the new ruler in order to have peace. After everyone parted ways, Anne Marie appeared in prison through an astral projection, finding out her friend's whereabouts. Soon after, Zed and Chas appeared in front of the prison, who were planning to go to the prison. Chandler, also intending to go inside, decided to use the easiest way and hit the policeman, thanks to which his plan was successful. Soon after, to the surprise of John's waning, Anne Marie also appeared, who promised to help. After finding a suitable place, they began exorcising themselves. They were surprised by the fact that at this stage of possession, holy water did not affect existence. The process was interrupted by
   Nahash
   - the tempter serpent, whose aim was to finish the exorcist. But he saw that he was possessed, and was glad that they would soon be allies.

  <p key="e0f6824a-e840-4f8e-9dee-1706383eb80d">
   Nevertheless, he attacked Chas, whose neck he broke, and in retaliation he was murdered by a nun with a mystical dagger. Soon after John awoke in the morgue next to Anne Marie, Chandler was also in the bag next to it. As the condition of the exorcist was not the best, they decided to move him to the mill. To this end, Julio collected entire supplies of heroin from all prisoners, which they then injected intravenously into Constantine. This gave them a way to take him to a specific location, but to distract the guards, Anne Marie used astral projection to create a naked copy of herself. After reaching the mill, taking advantage of John's unconsciousness, the team began to prepare the necessary things by tying the possessed man to the bed. When he awoke, he realized that he could not use the dictaphone because the demon would not listen to his voice. So he asked Anne Marie to perform an exorcism as she had the appropriate powers. However, she had to do it in Catholic, which allowed her to know the existence of Heaven and Hell. She agreed to this, warning Zed and Chas that at some point the demon would try to use their weaknesses against them. Anne has not forgiven herself for what she has done in Newcastle, and Pazuzu has taken control of Constantin. He started mocking his friends, trying to break them down and pointing out their greatest failures. Zed explained to the nun that she had to forgive herself as well, not only John, which would allow her to successfully complete the ritual. When the demon left the exorcist's body, Constantine thanked his friends for their help and would stay with him in such a difficult time. Soon after saying goodbye, John said goodbye to Anne Marie, apologizing for all his mistakes and promising to change.

   Zed was going to run away, believing that the mill was not a safe place and they might find her again. John tried hard to find out who he was still running from, hearing the name of the fanatic organization - the
   Resurrection Crusade
   - in response. When the exorcist found out that her friend's father was her leader, he understood her fears, promising protection as strong as his abilities would allow. The conversation was interrupted by a bloody appearance on the bloody map pointing to
   New York
   . Constantine understood that it might have something to do with Chas, who at this point was headed to his family to meet his daughter. They decided to prepare for the trip by taking with them many useful things, including the tendon from the Achilles heel. When Zed and John got a message from Chas, they went to the hospital where he and his
   daughter
   were. There he told his friends what had happened and stated that it was not an ordinary coma, as many patients suffered from the same. Constantine decided to check and found that Geralidne's soul was leaving the body. Horrified by the fact that some magician had managed to separate soul from body, he decided to contact an old friend who was a medium.
   Renee
   interrupted the conversation and returned to the room. She was furious that John had approached her daughter and expected an explanation from her ex-husband, but he heard only in response to help. Soon after, the three visited
   Fennel
   's store, which began to threaten Constantine with a shotgun. He wanted to help Zed and Chas, but he was not going to work with an eccentric exorcist who only thinks about himself. Desperate, Chandler, however, did not have time to negotiate with the man, so he tore his gun away and knocked him out, forcing him to help.
  </p>
  <p key="cb3fa287-bf5e-413f-ad24-5c5f2daa78c5">
   Fennel performed a ritual which allowed Geraldine to speak through his mouth. Then this one was interrupted, and the mysterious magician was surprised that someone was taking advantage of one of his victims. He recognized John and said he wouldn't be so easily defeated this time by burning Fennel's body alive. Constantine, however, remembered the spell cast by him and wrote it to Zed. Thanks to this, she tracked the location of the potential kidnapper, where the team went right after that. Once there, John deactivated the camouflage spell, discovering the mage's hideout, who turned out to be
   Felix Faust
   - a powerful wizard who managed to separate the body from the soul and intends to use it to increase his own power. Angry Chas, wanting to get his daughter back, attacked the mage, and Constantine had to make a pact with him. He was to return Geraldine's soul in exchange for helping the exorcist get rid of the
   Karabasan
   demon, to which the exorcist agreed. After leaving the hideout, John, furious with Chandler for disobeying him, dismissed him from the case and decided to act alone with Zed.
  </p>
  <p key="bacfa10f-c59e-48a3-a37e-470806d4f67d">
   John and Zed went to an abandoned warehouse, which was probably the hideout of the demon. Martin agreed to act as bait in order to drag the monster into the previously prepared magic circle. Once Karabasan was in it, Constantine tried to set the circle on fire, but the lighter refused to obey. Therefore, to save his friend from danger, he used a stun gun, destroying the demon with tremendous voltage. Immediately after that, they returned to the hospital to return with Chas to meet Faust. Hearing this name, Renee intended to help the team, fearing for her daughter. Zed decided to stay with the woman to guard her daughter's body. Soon after, during the meeting with Felix, the mage broke the contract that John had defeated Karabasana by dissipating energy, rather than sending him to Hell as the contract mentioned at the beginning. Seeing no other way out, Constantine took his nervous friend outside, where he tried to calm him down. The latter, however, was not going to give up and stunned his friend, locking him in the car. He himself went to the magician with a proposal, offering him 32 souls in exchange for one - the soul of his daughter.
  </p>
  <p key="51690820-0a2a-4cb8-a876-760da1b19842">
   Faust did not believe that one body could be such a "capacious vessel," so Chandler decided to show it to him by killing himself before his eyes. Soon Chas returned to life, surprising Faust, who was ready to accept the man's proposal. The latter, however, expected a handshake to "complete" the deal when John woke up and was about to save his friend. Chandler understood perfectly well that the magician could deceive him and tied him to himself with a tendon from his Achilles heel, then pulled a grenade from his pocket and pulled the pin, waiting for death. Then Renee appeared in the building, whom Chas ordered John to protect, shouting his last words before the explosion, which resulted in Faust being killed and the souls returned to their rightful owners. Several dozen minutes later, after the fire brigade arrived, John had the opportunity to quietly talk to Renee. He explained to her that Chas would be back and it would be long enough, depending on how violent his death was. He also tried to make excuses to himself that he didn't want to stand between their relationship and if he could change the time he would fix it. However, this cannot be done, and only thanks to him Chandler is still alive, like many other people. The next morning, Constantine waited in the hospital for Zed to wake up. When this happened, a weakened woman said that John's mother did not want him to blame himself for her death. Surprised by these words, he lay down next to his friend and began to think about his life.

   John was resting in the mill, talking to
   Gary Lester
   's reflection in the magic mirror. Suddenly Manny appeared, trying to get the exorcist to work. He only succeeded when he mentioned an old friend,
   Ritchie Simpson
   , who lectured on a voice recorder
   at university
   . After the class was over, he heard a question from Constantine from the crowd of students, realizing that his day would be spoiled by an ex-friend. He took him to his office, where he learned of the death of Gary Lester and that something dark was going on around him, and that John intends to face it. The conversation was interrupted by a phone call to the professor from one of the students,

    Adam
   </span>
   , who informed about his absence due to the unexpected death of his friend. They both immediately went to the scene, where the exorcist stealthily stole the policeman's notes, learning about the cause of death. On the night before school, on the wake of the student's death, Ritchie and John met
   Lily
   from whom they learned about what the four had been doing a few days ago. Later that night John decided to investigate the case alone and went to the cemetery described by Lily. There, he was surprised by the presence of Manny, who tried to show the man the mistake he still made about his friends.
  </p>
  <p key="fd0f9c20-d192-4420-a21a-4b1e2f595f1f">
   During the conversation, John found a clue above one of the graves, so he decided to use a spell that depicts the runes. Thus, he learned that a magical ritual was being performed here, related to the
   Egyptian
   culture. Constantine then returned to Ritchie's office, to whom he presented his discovery. It was then that the professor remembered the journal of
   Jacob Shaw
   he had. The man described there journeys to other worlds that ended tragically for him. To his surprise, the journal disappeared from Simpson's collection, indicating that it was causing campus problems. They also understood that Adam might try to go back there and they went to the cemetery as soon as possible. It was too late to rescue, however, because the boy's body had cut defensive wounds, which eventually led to him bleeding out. Everything was different in Shaw's world as Adam was trying to protect
   Miranda
   from Jacob. Soon after, Ritchie and John returned to campus, where they learned of the death of Miranda, who they found dead in a dance studio. At last Simpson began to understand how Constantine was feeling and what he was hiding. He decided that they were both like cancer that spreads disease on and on. Nevertheless, they remembered that they could save another person and visited Lily, to whom they gave the news of Adam's death.

   The terrified girl was taken to the mill, where their goal was to deal with her problem. A moment of inattention made Lily look at the phone and unknowingly, through the reflection, she found herself in
   the other world
   . After a little argument, the men decided to visit this mystical world on their own and performed a ritual that allowed them to enter there. Moments later, they found each other and together they traveled on, where Simpson had the opportunity to demonstrate what he had learned over the years - modification of worlds. They didn't realize Shaw was watching them, until he finally decided to show up. Ritchie then realized that there was a grain of truth in the legend of Jacob's second life. The enraged men tried to fight the enemy, but this was his world and he held power here, wounding them.
  </p>
  <p key="2115cb99-28d5-4ddd-9ce2-c040dd69c11b">
   Constantine explained to Ritchie that the wounds he was inflicting on them were not real and he could fight it. Thus, the professor took courage, stood up and began to modify the world against Shaw's principles, destroying it once and for all. Because of this act, the apartment began to collapse, which forced Ritchie and John to flee. After a while, Lily was brought to the exit by friends who could not leave this place themselves. Thus, Simspon showed the girl how to get out of this world. Constantine understood that Ritchie might want to stay here because he saw the potential of this place that Shaw did not see. Sam went back to reality and watched, and after a while Ritchie returned as well. After shaking off and returning to teaching, the professor stopped using the dictaphone during his lectures and spoke himself - he taught based on what he had experienced.

   Constantine returned to the mill, where Chas studied the bloody map and the radio for information on supernatural events. After a while, the man noticed the thread he was following into the vast corridors. In one of the rooms, he met a meditating Zed who pretended that she just wanted to rest. In reality, however, she was trying to run away from her abilities, which John didn't particularly like. Immediately after that, the exorcist returned to Chas, where Manny's body took over his friend's body, who was furious with his ally for sitting idle. He thought the map was out of order and burned it, then told about a patient who was rushed to
   the hospital
   , who was suspected of having an overdose. On the angel's advice, the team drove to the local hospital, and to make appearances, John stuck a screwdriver in Chas's leg.

   Thanks to this, they came closer to the described patient with black veins. When Zed tried to inspect her with her visions, she saw a bright light, but the narrative interrupted the cardiac arrest of the test patient whom the doctors were trying to save. As if that were not enough, Martin had an unknown seizure and she had to go to a hospital bed. As soon as it was stabilized, a brain tomography was ordered. Constantine at that time returned to Chas, whom he told about everything, while looking at the intrusive patient - Morris. The occultists went to the hospital morgue, where they wanted to examine Linda's body. It turned out that even after death, it was filled with powerful black magic, which worried John, who ordered his friend to look for clues in Jasper's archives. Soon after, the man went to Zed's room, where he found out about the friend's results as presented by Dr. Galen. Everything indicated that she had a tumor at the temporal lobe that could trigger her visions. As soon as the doctor left the room, Constantine tried to explain that people were always looking for a cause-and-effect relationship without seeing the other side of the medallion.

Therefore, the exorcist stunned the angel with air from Hades, and then cast a spell on him to "lock" him in the human body. As a result, Manny lost access to his angelicness and was forced to help John, who, following the flashing light, found another victim in the hospital -

   . The man's body was torn open and his heart glowed purple. It was then that John and Manny began to put the facts together, concluding that there was a powerful artifact called a
   Black diamond
   involved in it all. Consequently, Constantine decided to return to the mill, and Manny would use the human body to search the patient files to discover what the two victims had in common. The exorcist found a piece of artifact in Jasper's hideout, which he checked on Chas, while Manny was seduced by a nurse, helping him achieve his goal. Soon after, the two men met outside the hospital, where an angel began to describe the experienced feelings. Thus, they again found out that the killer can only get rid of those who did not take advantage of the second chance. So they suspected Morris, who had a colorful past. John decided to check it out alone and sent Manny over to Zed.

  <p key="ab67e0ba-ddee-4e66-bfa6-97ff6ec42ca1">
   Constantine searched for Morris, finding him suffocated by an unknown force of darkness that deafened the exorcist. As soon as he woke up, he called Manny, with whom they discovered
   Dr. Galen
   , who would be the alleged killer. They ran to Zed, fearing for her life, where they made many accusations against the doctor. He denied it, but then started to run away. The team followed him, where it was Zed who understood her visions. To make these come true, John decided to free Manny from the doctor's body, and then tried to fight the monster. Unfortunately to no avail, so for the first time he put all his hopes on Manny, awaiting his arrival. According to Zed's visions, a heavenly light appeared, to which Galen began to follow, taking him with him, and the very shard that was in his body merged with the shard of Jasper's diamond. After these events, Martin went to the church, where John found her. Soon after that, Manny also appeared, whom the woman saw with her own eyes. She was happy to be able to talk to the angel, so Constantine decided to leave them alone.

   After
   Jim Corrigan
   took over the deceased detective's case and looked at the documentation, he contacted John and Zed, whom he met at the bar. There he showed them pictures of his dead partner - Clement Dupree, who had been mummified. There was also a strange symbol on his body, so the team decided to check the grave of the deceased. On the spot, it turned out that he was investigating the case of the disappearance of three girls of the same age and linked it all to the theory of the Blood Moon Tetrad. The symbol itself was used to stigmatize witches in the 12th century, implying that the girls were abducted by
   a Satanist
   . He needed each of them until one of the full moons, thus making sacrifices to renew the new cycle. Corrigan got a call from the police station where he found out about another kidnapping. Meanwhile, the conversation between Zed and John was interrupted by the sudden awakening of a pulled-out corpse, into which
   Gary Lester

   Occultists and a detective visited the mother of the missing person, who told about their last quarrel. The three decided to investigate the matter in Vesta's room, where Zed could not see anything in the vision due to her confusion. Soon after John decided to use a special ritual to find out where Vesta was. However, it mainly consisted of an electric shock, which Jim and Martin did not like, but they achieved their goal, knowing about the last whereabouts of the girl. They made their way quickly to the scene where Constantine noticed they were being watched. As expected, they were attacked by
   Papa Midnite

   voodoo zombie

The exorcist knew that something was up, so he ordered his friends to flee, promising to call back soon. As expected, Papa Midnite himself attacked him shortly after, successfully hitting him with the As Winchester's bullet. After a while it turned out that Constantine had faked his own death using the body of a bodyguard and a camouflage spell. Thus, he managed to stun his opponent and take his weapon from him. He immediately went to the house where the girl was probably being held. There he discovered the bodies of the other three victims whose

He did not want him to spend only a few years in prison for everything he had done and to be released again, so Jim released him, ordered him to flee and shot him, ending his miserable life. After that, Vesta returned to her mother, and Corrigan spent time with Martin at the bar, where he found out about his future, but decided to make up with her anyway by kissing the woman. John himself met Manny outside, to whom he told him that day after day he faced evil, but today was a real hell for him. He did not fight a demon, a monster from the abyss, but a man - extremely dangerous. At the same time, he assured the angel that he would not run away from the battlefield after all, because he only played when he was sure that he would win.

The two started a relationship and soon moved in together in a loft they rented in New Orleans. Not long after, John was being targeted by the demon

The deal was later made public to John when in an attempt to send Neron to Hell, he had to sent Dez there as well. John does, for the sake of the world, and he later crumbles with grief in heartbreak as Desmond is thrown into hell.

Sara asked John to help, as the two went on a search for the unicorn and the other Legends affected by the unicorn glitter. The two got in a fight, John saying that Sara should not pursue love and long-lasting relationships, as the people of their craft are cursed to hurt their loved ones, while Sara stated that it was John's own character that made him hurt and leave behind the people he loved, and in fact the loved ones made the heroes stronger for their connection.

   Fairy Godmother
   , angry at humans for banishing her into
   Mallus's realm
   . Instead of granting the wishes of shoes of glass and various trinkets, the Godmother was eager to help the girl's revenge against the villagers, trying to seduce her into using the fairy's power to bring fire and brimstone upon the angry Puritans. John wasn't able to banish the Fairy Godmother, as her spellcasting was much quicker, allowing her to overpower the Legends. When John tried to stop Fairy Godmother and Prudence from leaving the ship, he was silenced by the fairy's spell, sealing his mouth shut. After
   Zari Tomaz
   and
   Sara Lance
   managed to convince Prudence to call off the Fairy Godmother, the girl released her from their contract, allowing John to incapacitate the mystical witch. He then brought her to the forest and discussed the Godmother's fate, offering her a deal: others she enters a contract with him, or he sends her to
   Hell
   . Although she was scared of Hell, the Fairy Godmother chose to refuse John's offer, saying that she'd rather take on the forces of Hell than on the being that is currently pursuing Constantine. She taunted him on being "far more damned than she is" before John opened a portal that siphoned her into Hell.

John encountered the Beast, who turned out to be a manifestation of his inner darkness thanks to the magic potion. John tried to face him but could not so Zari managed to defeat the Beast, thus ending the game. John tried to pour away the potion, but due to his addiction, he was unable to do so.

   John was still obsessed with taking the potions until Zari realized it. Realizing that Zari stole her potions, Constantine followed her angrily and had to decide between magic or her. John stayed at his house and was still haunted by magic until Zari talked to him, managing to convince him to give up magic, and John finally decided to get rid of the potions. Prepared, John left the magic forever until his evil version faced him to force him to take the last potion, even though he did not want to, but to survive John finally took the last potion recovering more magic and agreed to work with
   Bishop

John confronted Astra, but she was no match for him, and watched as the Source brought Spooner to the present.

Constantine began to be destroyed by the Fountain, who was starting to leave, but John got to see Astra, Zari, and Nate for the last time.

   Having witnessed the horrors of the world, John is very cynical and seemingly unconcerned with the value of human life, often deflecting his real feelings with sarcastic jokes even towards the possibility of his own death. Due to the number of people who have died around him John prefers to work alone and anyone he does work with, he avoids attachment so he won't be as hurt if they get killed. He is also known for having a very dry sense of humor.

   John is noted for being brutally honest with individuals, even

   to restore
   Sara Lance
   's soul, he also did a protection spell on Oliver despite his refusal to have attachments to individuals when he saw Oliver had a pure heart. He also has a strong capability for regret and remorse, as he was so overwhelmed with guilt after Astra was damned to Hell that he placed himself in Ravenscar Psychiatric Facility for the Mentally Deranged and seems to express some kindness to those who suffered because of him, as he was shown to be trying considerably to make amends with
   Anne Marie Flynn
   when they reunited as he knew of the pain he inflicted on her and the anger she felt for him.
  </p>
  <p key="19bff9e7-e80a-4e2e-a549-0d4e9b424903">
   John tends to be a pessimistic realist as when Oliver thanked him for bringing Sara back he simply told Oliver he owed him only for Oliver to rebuttal that instead of that, they should always have each other's back when the need is, not as business acquaintances, but as friends.

  <p key="0a94fba8-a5a7-4655-a5a1-1358d3322c12">
   However, John is arrogant and overconfident in his bluffing, to the point of having questionable morals, such as when he threatened the life of an innocent child, Diego, to get
   Lamashtu
   (one of
   Eve
   's sisters) to reveal why she was working for the
   La Brujeria
   , which forced his ex-lover,
   Anne Marie Flynn

   Invunche

  <p key="cf10db76-a30a-4acb-8d60-90f09fd2bc87">
   As John's journey to stop the
   Rising Darkness
   continued, he appeared to have developed possible genuine romantic feelings for Zed Martin, as observed by Manny, who pointed out that John was jealous upon seeing
   Jim Corrigan
   kiss her, since he seemed to be genuinely shocked and upset to see it. He also admitted that due to rarely encountering evil humans, he was troubled by the La Brujeria as they were quite possibly the worst of humanity, which worried him.

  <p key="2d119e02-3ee8-4fc7-a8a5-71099f504520">
   John has caused so much pain to those closest to him that if there is ever a chance to end that pain he would accept it in no matter what the consequences are, this is best seen when demons stated they would release Astra from hell should he stop interfering in their plans. Also, when he went back in time to save his boyfriend,
   Desmond
   from being sent to hell even though it could cause damage to the timeline.

     Magic

    While referring to himself as merely an "occasional dabbler" after his failed exorcism, John is a master of the occult and mystic arts. Since his teenage years, John has accumulated vast knowledge and skill of magic, mysticism, and the supernatural. He is well-versed in various forms of sorcery, including
    dark magic
    . John knows words and phrases of multiple ancient languages, such as Latin, which he will usually chant while performing certain rituals or incantations. Many incantations give him the ability to affect physical forces, such as the inner workings of mechanisms, and the movements of others, allowing him to move objects and control their motion and momentum with the proper incantation. Despite John being a master sorcerer in his own right, he is shown to be wary of fighting
    Damien Darhk
    , though during their encounter, he was able to counter his powers with his own; due to
    Astra Logue
    using her mother,
    Natalie Logue
    's cleansing spell; John has lost all of these powers.
