   , which is also how he was nicknamed by his friends and some members of the media in the Flashpoint timeline. After defeating and detaining the criminal known as
   Plunder
   , he was embraced by
   Central City
   and officially became known as Kid Flash to all. He was tricked by
   Savitar
   via hallucinations to open a portal into the Speed Force, getting trapped in the Speed Force to replace him. He was later rescued by Barry Allen and
   Jay Garrick
   , who in turn took his place. He assisted Barry and Jay in the final battle against Savitar, successfully saving Iris. He became the boyfriend of
   Jesse Wells
   , only to be dumped after she became too busy on
   Earth-2

   . Once Barry returned, Wally returned to sharing the spotlight with him. After discovering that Jesse was breaking up with him and that the team was better off without him, he decided to leave Central City for a time in order to focus on himself. He returned three weeks later for Barry and Iris's wedding, but later continued his soul-searching journey. He eventually ended up at a monastery in China, where he was recruited by
   Rip Hunter
   to join the

   future niece

   Joining the Peace Corps and a Buddhist culture in Asia, Wally developed his connection with the Speed Force and trained to use it in new ways. In early 2020, he returned to Central City after the
   Crisis
   to visit his family, but also to warn Barry that his actions in Crisis had caused the Speed Force to start growing weak and dying.

   her family
   .
   Francine and Wally lived in
   Keystone City
   , where growing up the Francine did not make a lot of money to buy Wally gifts like toys as a however she made up for this by taking Wally on long drives. These experiences gave Wally a love for automobiles. When Francine became sick Wally started participating in street races and gained a reputation as a winner. Other racers stopped wanting to face him, so he started racing in Central City in order to pay for his mother's medical bills due to her being sick.

   During a
   Christmas
   party in 2015, Wally stopped by to visit Joe and Iris, meeting them for the first time. He realized they had company and apologized for the timing, but was invited into their home.

  <p key="19710cce-9fea-46c9-9c8f-c8196a83ff5d">
   Iris and Joe showed Wally around the
   Central City Police Department
   earlier before their plans to have dinner that night, where it became evident that Wally held bitter resentment towards Joe for not being in his life. However, Wally stood Joe up and was later found by Joe participating in a street race, which he won. Wally told him that he has been doing street races in order to pay for his mother's medical bills, as he had had to be the man of his household all of his life due to Joe's absence. Joe offered to dip into his bank account to help Wally, but he angrily rebuffed the offer. Later that day, he visited Joe and reassured him that an apology wasn't coming, before letting him know he was returning to Keystone City. Joe apologized for trying to push the "father-son thing" so hard before they sat down to a meal of Chinese food.

   When Francine's state worsened and was about to die, she told Iris she would like Wally to visit her so she could see their whole family together. Iris went to see Wally to talk about her and he said he was angry because his mother never told him he had a father and a sister. Iris mentioned she never had the opportunity to say goodbye to
   her fiancé
   before he died and told Wally he should go see his mother while he still could. Wally decided to follow her advice and asked Iris to go see Francine with him.

   Francine died soon after and Wally grew closer to Joe and Iris as a result. Iris started to worry about the dangers of Wally's street races and complained that Joe was acting more like a "buddy" rather than like a father to Wally, though Joe explained that he wanted to give Wally some space and not be strict with him to avoid jeopardizing their relationship. Iris attempted to talk some sense into Wally and even threatened to publish an article about street racing. She and Joe were at one of the races when a

   , but Iris was injured by a glass shard and had to be taken to the hospital. Wally visited her there and Joe had a serious conversation with him, saying that they were worried about him because they were his family and that he should have treated Wally as a son instead of a friend. Wally decided to stay with Iris at the hospital and told her he liked street racing because it reminded him of the times when his mother would take him for a drive, which is why he did not want to stop racing.

   Wally visited Joe at the Police Department to tell him something. The detective was surprised by his son's visit as they had no appointment. As soon as the boy wanted to say something, a block from the headquarters, the Geomancer began to rage causing earthquakes. This forced Joe to leave Wally alone, having to stop a dangerous meta-human.

   Wally, along with Iris, met Barry, Caitlin, and Cisco at the bar. The young man noticed a new girl with them - Jesse. After a short conversation, the new friend went to the bathroom, leaving Wally alone. A few days later, the young man was eating dinner with his family and was talking about a project he is currently working on with his adviser. Speaking of him, he mentioned that he had to read the journals of people like Enzo Ferrari and Ferdinand Porsche because he couldn't meet them, but he needed their knowledge of speed. These words resulted in some idea in Barry, who left without touching the food and thanking Wally for the "key to the case" he is working on.

   At a later night, Wally came over to see Joe and watch Formula 1, and to do some laundry. He told Joe and Barry that he had moved out of his campus because the rent became too expensive. Joe offered to pay for some of it, but Wally claimed it was fine. Later when watching the Formula 1,

   After being saved by the Flash, when the Flash traded his powers for Wally's life, Wally was inspired by the Flash's sacrifice and figured out that Joe had a way to contact the Flash from what Zoom told him while he was in captivity. Wally asked Joe if he could arrange a meeting with the Flash so that he could thank him. Later on during a night, Joe brought Wally to the rooftop so that Wally could thank the Flash for saving him in person.

   When Zoom reappeared on Earth-1 to instill fear into the CCPD, Joe and Harry had both of their children (Wally West and Jesse Wells) kept safe in the Time Vault at S.T.A.R. Labs since they were both kidnapped by Zoom before. Wally and Jesse quickly bonded during their time in the vault. While Wally was trying to break out of the Time Vault, Jesse stated the improbability of the wall just opening for him. Wally said that they should be outside trying to help the team rather than just hiding. Jesse, feeling hopeless, saw no way that they could actually be of use. Wally rekindled that hope by saying that she was smart enough to solve an unsolvable problem. Convinced, Jesse said that she will try to see what she could do. Later on, they were able to break out of the Time Vault just in time for an earthquake caused by the experiment to restore Barry's powers. Seeking the cause, Wally and Jesse went into the halls to investigate only to be blasted by a wave of
   dark matter
   energy from Barry's apparent death when he seemingly exploded by the attempt to restore his powers. They were both knocked out by the wave of energy.

   Joe and Harry found the two of them moments later, while Wally quickly responded, Jesse's heart momentarily stopped. Joe left and Iris mentioned that Barry ‘was gone,’ and the two left for home. That night, Joe was suspicious Wally was a Speedster due to Barry's energy hitting him, to test this, he dropped a coffee mug, though Wally didn't respond. After hearing a car alarm go off, he was told to leave.

   Wally's earlier life is unknown in this timeline though given that Francine had already moved away and given birth to Wally prior to Nora's murder it can be presumed that Wally still grew up without knowing of Joe or Iris. However, it is shown that Wally does still know them indicating he was introduced at some point, though exactly when is also unknown. While he loved his sister, Iris, he wasn't on good terms with Joe as he was an alcoholic who frequently missed shifts at C.C.P.D., and he and Iris rarely spoke to him.

   Wally used to drive illegal cars, and tampered with a nitro formula to get his engine revving faster. One night, Wally was racing in a thunderstorm and his car was struck by lightning and as a result, he fell into a coma for nine months. However, his genetic structure was affected by the formula in conjunction with the lightning that struck his car, turning him into a meta-human speedster with a connection to the

   . When Wally woke from his coma, he discovered his powers and decided to help the people of Central City, abandoning his racing car days. Wally told Iris about his powers and she decided to help him, using her connections as a reporter to give information to Wally to help him find and defeat criminals, calling themselves a brother-sister crime fighting unit. Needing a stable means to carrying out their new crusade, Wally and Iris sought out

However, Cisco was uninterested and refused to help them, but agreed to make Wally a friction-proof suit so his clothes wouldn't explode at Mach II when he ran, so long as they left him out of their crusade and never returned to Ramon Industries. Reluctant, the siblings agreed. Instead, Wally and Iris settled with a makeshift base in Wally's apartment. Shortly after receiving his suit, Wally began helping the public out as a hero called "The Flash", though was often called "Kid Flash" by Iris and some members of the media.

   Wally was later brought back to Ramon Industries, where Barry revealed himself to be a speedster as well. After tracking the Rival down at an abandoned sawmill, Wally and Barry ran over. The two planned to flank. After the Rival arrived and challenged one of them to face him first, Wally volunteered. Wally would ultimately come out on top, but was impaled once he turned his back. After Barry defeated the Rival and the latter was shot by Joe, Wally was taken back to Ramon Industries. Unfortunately, Wally's cells weren't regenerating as they should've.

   The next day, while Barry was chasing

In the evening the entire team met at the West's house for dinner, as Allen wanted to improve their relationship at all costs, which had not been going well with the recent changes. When the meal started to fall apart, it was interrupted by an attack by some city sprinter, causing everyone to intervene. Hours later, Flash returned to base where he confessed to the team about the changes made over time. However, after much reflection, they decided that they did not want to know what they were like in the previous timeline.

   Wally was at S.T.A.R. Labs with the rest of the team when the breach opened outside the lab. The prepared team waited for the enemy to pass, but it turned out that it was Harry Wells with Jesse, who had become a sprinter in recent days. After a short greeting and telling the story, they went to the
   Speed lab
   where they wanted to check the girl's achievements. Wally, however, could not understand why he did not receive these powers despite surviving the same accident as her and decided to leave while testing Jesse. Some time later, Joe invited his son to the police station, where, seeing his son's worry, he comforted him that the hero did not have to possess super powers. The boy seemed to understand his words, after which he returned to S.T.A.R. Labs and saw Harry and Jesse arguing. He decided to talk to the girl who ran out of the room. After finding her, he learned how she discovered her powers - through a car racing towards her. Wally decided to do the same and threw himself under the vehicle, but Jesse saved him. As soon as he met his father and Barry after that, he heard only their disappointment, but he did not intend to give up anyway, as he knew that with the powers he could achieve more. While Jesse and Flash tried to beat

   As The Flash and Jesse Quick were practicing, Wally admired her friend's speed, who was almost as fast as Barry. After a successful training, they both decided to go out into the city and fool around with the girl's abilities. As they stopped downtown, the conversation quickly turned into a kiss, which surprised Wally. He confessed to Jesse that he liked her very much, but she was to return to her Earth soon, so their relationship was pointless. Despite this awkward situation, they both decided to stay friends and went back to their antics. When the girl disobeyed Flash's order and contributed to the imprisonment of the hero in the mirror by the
   Mirror Master

   Wally was at S.T.A.R. Labs as the team tried to meet the new Harrison. The man at all costs wanted to gain the crew's trust by handing out coffee and preparing a dessert, thinking that they would get to know each other better. When Central City began to terrorize
   a monster

   Wally then begins to have dreams of Flashpoint induced by

Wally eventually comes to his senses, realizing that Alchemy can not be trusted and allows himself to remain in the pipeline until Team Flash can deal with him, however, when Wally's visions begin to become painful, he attempts to escape, but is thwarted by Iris. Wally recommends setting a trap for Alchemy and agrees to act as bait. He succeeds in baiting Alchemy and Flash and a SWAT team led by Joe capture him (Alchemy) and
   his followers

   kinetic energy to zero. As it turned out, the warrior intended to capture the man, because travel between worlds is forbidden on their Earth. West, not wanting to interfere, decided to train, but Iris interrupted the intense effort and asked her brother for a favor. She was not entirely sure that the team could save her from a future death, however she intended to achieve something by then and become a good reporter. Wally agreed to help, and his job was to get the police papers from his father's desk at the police station. Then they went to the warehouse where the dangerous criminals' weapons were supposed to be stored. The whole action of the siblings led Joe to learn about everything, so young West decided to unload his emotions during training again. The exercises were interrupted by Barry, who noticed significant progress in increasing the youth's speed. He figured they could change Iris's future when Wally tried to beat Savitar.

  <p key="be7bb0d9-edb8-4ed2-8de8-df5f04baebfe">
   Kid Flash trained with Flash on the streets of Central City, and despite the youth's confidence, he lost the race by not being able to vibrate with air particles, thus penetrating matter. Soon after, Joe asked his children to meet him, Cecile, and her daughter
   Joanie
   at CC Jitters. During it, the girl revealed that she liked Kid Flash very much, which surprised Wally. The joyful conversation was interrupted by meta-man -
   Clive Yorkin
   , who was hunting detective West. His intentions were unnoticed by Kid Flash, who rejected the man, thus allowing him to escape. After this incident, Wally trained with Barry how to use his abilities correctly, but the boy couldn't figure it out. When Iris was in danger in her house, the sprinter did not manage to save her sister from a criminal's touch and quickly took her to S.T.A.R. Labs, where he doubted himself and his competences. When much later Wally faced Yorkin again, he canceled his abilities with his blood and then arrested him. After all, in the laboratory, he checked the discovered powers, which he discovered under the tension of Allen, when a portal opened behind him, from which a terrified Jesse Quick ran out. The heroine revealed that her father was kidnapped by Grodd and that he is being held in
   Gorilla City

   With the rest of the team going to save Harry on Earth-2, Wally stayed on Earth-1 to spend time with Jessie. They decided to be together, though Jesse was still very worried about her father. After Harry was brought back safely, Jessie cheered up and decided to move to Earth-1 to stay with Wally. However, Gorilla Grodd and an army of armored, intelligent gorillas followed the team back from Earth-2 and attacked Central City. Wally and Jesse fought the army together while Barry and
   Solovar
   dealt with Grodd. Later, Harry told Wally he was dying in order to manipulate him into leaving Jessie so she could spend time with Harry, but Jessie exposed the lie and Harry went back to Earth-2 alone.

   Unfortunately, Wally and Jesse could not spend much time together because a bulkier Savitar started appearing to Wally in hallucinations because of his connection to the Philosopher's Stone, driving him crazy. The hallucination drove Wally to give Savitar the Stone, allowing Savitar to take on his physical form and be fully free from the Speed Force, at the expense of some of his speed, and Wally took his place. Uncontrollably being sucked into a wormhole, Wally screamed for Barry to help him but Barry could do nothing but watch as Wally's costume crumbled away and Wally vanished.

   Eventually, Barry and Jay Garrick succeeded in getting through the Speed Force to reach Wally, who had been experiencing his worst memory (his mother's death) repeatedly for what could have been lifetimes. Jay took Wally's place as the Speed Force's prisoner, and Barry escaped with Wally. Despite his freedom, Wally was deeply scarred by his experience, and remained depressed. This was not helped by Jessie's decision to leave to take Jay's place as the Flash of his world.

   Wally went to spend time with Jessie for a while, and after he returned, he started telling Barry, Iris, and Joe all about his time with her shortly after Joe made a comment about love which indirectly caused Barry to deduce Savitar's identity, causing Barry to rush out and confront the metallic menace, who confirmed that he was, in fact, the Future Flash. Barry later tells the team, bringing them great surprise.

   The team came up with the idea that by wiping Barry's memory they would have a chance to get rid of Savitar, who would also remember nothing. They did so, but the plan failed too much, erasing Allen's memories of who he was. Julian and Cisco tried to fix their mistake, and Allen had to deal with
   Lucious Coolidge
   . Due to their "ailment", the team decided to help with this, but to no avail. After some time, Caitlin visited them, who said she would help, fearing for Savitar himself. Together, they restored Barry's memory and tried to convince Snow to stay with them. These words did not help, and the girl went back to Savitar.

   Now with a plan to save Iris from Savitar, the team sent Iris with Wally and Joe to Earth-2 to hide out with Harry. Unfortunately, Savitar dressed up as Barry and tricked H.R into telling him where Iris was. Arriving at their location, Savitar immediately battled Wally. Though Wally landed much more blows on the bulkier speedster, he could not hurt him through his armor, and Savitar strongly knocked him down. With Harry and Joe's guns ineffective against his armor as well, Savitar took Iris, though not before briefly unmasking himself to gloat.

  <p key="865448b9-6126-4eb5-8c98-4050ee9bd45d">
   Wally felt immensely ashamed that he failed to save Iris, but was amazed when H.R. revealed he took Iris's place in dying at Savitar's hand with his cloaking mechanism from his world. They all attended H.R.'s funeral. Wally disapproved of Barry's idea of trying to get Savitar to become a hero, and was proven right in his suspicion when Savitar set the Philosopher's Stone to explode, destroying S.T.A.R Labs. However, Wally and Barry managed to get everyone out safely. Wally, Barry, and Cisco went out into a forest where Savitar and Killer Frost were for a final confrontation, in which Cisco pulled Jay from the Speed Force.

   Together, the three Flashes took down Savitar while Cisco got Caitlin back on their side. However, after Barry refused to take Savitar's life, as H.R.'s paradox would soon kill him anyway, Savitar got up and attempted to backstab Barry. Luckily, Iris arrived and shot Savitar dead with Joe's gun. Afterwards, the team celebrated at the destroyed S.T.A.R Labs, but their rebuilding efforts and celebration were cut short by the Speed Force's raging burst of lightning as the prison was unoccupied, raining chaos and destruction on Central City. Deciding to pay his penance for creating Flashpoint and Savitar, Barry agreed to take Jay's place in the Speed Force prison. Before he left, he told Wally that he would be Central City's Flash from now on.

   , Wally and Cisco were faced by a stern wake-up call from Iris that they should act mature because the city had no one else to defend it and they were catching only 2 out of every 3 criminals. Cisco and Wally were then faced by a
   Samuroid

   Desperate to save the city, Wally, Cisco, Joe, and Caitlin attempted to free Barry, but failed, earning another scolding from Iris. However, Barry appeared elsewhere, nude, glowing, and with a beard. The police brought him in and the team was ecstatic, only to find out Barry was driven mad and could not communicate with them. Wally decided to take it upon himself to stop the Samuroid and took up the mantle of The Flash before running out to confront the mechanical menace. Though he had the upper hand at first, Wally was defeated by the droid's powerful katana, which it stabbed through the back of the suit to lift Wally up humiliatingly, ripping the suit. The Samuroid then impaled his leg with a blade and left.

   Wally was incapacitated, as the injury would take five hours to heal (and an amputation if he wasn't a speedster) so Iris let the Samuroid capture her, having faith that Barry seeing her in danger would snap out of his insanity. She was correct, and Barry raced out to save her, taking the
   new suit
   Cisco had designed for him. Wally was amazed at the speed at which Barry was running, admitting even he had never run that fast. Cisco informed him no one had ever run that fast. After Barry rescued Iris and destroyed the Samuroid, Wally welcomed him to "Team Kid Flash", a name that everyone else immediately rejected.

   Rip Hunter
   - a fugitive from the
   Time Bureau

   Wally understood that Rip was familiar to the

   , but he was in no rush to help, as he still did not know his own place. Upon meeting someone new, the men began to discuss their drinking mistakes, and decided to steal Agent Green's phone and a time courier, and steal Rip's coat from the Time Bureau. With this, they moved to
   Tokyo
   in 1992 to a karaoke bar, where they began singing. Thanks to the sprinter's metabolism, Wally woke up without a hangover, unlike Rip, who, after a short conversation, offered the hero a place for outcasts like him - a place on the

   Zari Tomaz

   Fire Totem
   from Damien Darhk's pocket. When Rip had been re-instated with the Time Bureau, Wally was going to go off with him but Sara convinced him that he would be better off staying with the Legends, which Rip revealed that he was hoping he would.

She told him that he better not have ruined her Guitar Hero scores but they both saw that it had been changed to Trombone Hero.

The pastor and all the other people in the church started to get hostile with them and they quickly left where Zari revealed that Elvis had a totem on his guitar that caused hers to react. When Sara told them that they had to get it away from Elvis, Wally quickly sped off, stole it and brought it back to the ship in seconds. However, the totem on the guitar started to glow and a ghost appeared, causing the guitar to fly off, out of control. Wally tried to stop it but it went and dragged him all over the ship.

Zari then told Wally that this wasn't the same as in Central City where he could just run in with his speed and save the day. She told him that with history he had to slow down and talk with people and find out what they need, like a normal human being. He and Zari went to the church where they found Elvis' uncle and told him that he had to give the demo back. His uncle was convinced that rock music was corrupting his nephew and his town, but Wally told him that what he was really afraid of was losing his nephew. He told him of his own situation with him and his father arriving late into each other's lives but they were able to find something to tie them together when his dad let him go off to find himself and that he had to give his nephew the same chance.

At first, Wally refuses to believe that it is really her until she talks intimately about their old times as a couple. She tries to play on the fact that Wally felt that he didn't deserve her and that he had been right. Wally swallows his pain and tells her that he was actually glad that Jesse broke his heart as it got him to truly go out and find his own personal inner peace and it brought him new friends and a new team. He also said that he would find love with someone out there and that wouldn't be her. Mallus then ended the illusion and used a

He and Nate went to Detroit in 2018 to check on Mari for Amaya. At the hospital, after speaking with Mari's foster father, they noticed
   Kuasa
   was there and moved to sneak up on her. Wally sped for her but she turned to water and escaped into the vents. She moved to the bottom level but they managed to corner her but she told them that she wasn't there to fight but to check up on her sister. Wally and Nate took Kuasa to Mari's hideout and she explained that wanted to help her family. She told them that she would help them get Amaya's totem back to her so that time could return to normal but to get passed the Darhks, they would need to make a plan. They planned to use Nate as bait, playing it off as if Kuasa captured him in order to get the totem. Wally suggested that he could just use his speed to swipe the totem off Nora like he took the Fire Totem from Darhk but Kuasa told him that he had been lucky and surprised them but the Darhks would be on guard for him from now on.

   Wally moved to go and distract Amaya so she wouldn't interfere. When Wally returned to the ship, he told Amaya that Nate was still at the hospital, trying to convince Mari to give up her vigilantism. But Kuasa appeared with her Anansi totem as promised. However, Wally asked where Nate was and Kuasa revealed that she gave him to the Darhks and Wally angrily told her that wasn't the plan. She explained that she did what she had to do in order to ensure both her and Mari's existence as Nate wasn't her grandfather and his relationship with Amaya was a threat. Wally and Amaya went off to save Nate themselves. Wally went for Nora but she used Mallus' power to drain Wally before sending it back at him to knock him away. He came to and found that Kuasa had come to help them but had been killed by the Mallus consumed Nora and the Water Totem taken.

   in 1992, they were prepared to go after her but were contacted by Rip to warn them that
   Grodd
   was going off to kill a young
   Barack Obama
   in order to break the timestream enough for Mallus to be released. Nate and Wally went together to go get Amaya while the others went to deal with Grodd. They arrived at the village and found an old Amaya preparing to pass her totem over to her daughter
   Esi
   in a ceremony but a child Kuasa came with a baby Mari to tell her grandmother that Esi wasn't coming. They then found the young Amaya and she explained that because Esi refused to be the new totem bearer the village was left vulnerable to the warlord's attack. She believed that if she could convince Esi to embrace her destiny then it would change the future but Wally warned Amaya that it might not happen in the way she expected as what happened when Barry created Flashpoint. Nate went to go and talk to the elder Amaya about being more emotionally supportive of Esi to help her better embrace her destiny but Wally tried to reason with him to not go through with Amaya's plan. Nate told him that he couldn't abandon Amaya and her family and Wally told him that if he allowed this to go too far then he would stop him before he sped off to rejoin the other Legends.

   When he got back, he informed Sara of Amaya's plan and that Nate was helping her. They then discovered that if Amaya continued with it then the time stream would be broken enough for Mallus to fully escape. At first, they were against it, but then Sara came up with the idea that since they now possessed all the totems thanks to Damien Darhk joining them, they could kill Mallus but only if he was freed. Wally and the others agreed and he and Ray went to Nate and Amaya to tell them the new plan. They lied in wait at a sacred spot in the village with the captured Nora Darhk just as the warlords came to attack the village but Esi was waiting for them, now armed with the Anansi totem. The team waited but found that time wasn't changing as Damien Darhk had released Grodd upon the village to destroy it in order to keep Mallus from killing his daughter. Wally moved to stop Darhk but he levitated him off the ground and choked him before he flung him off to a corner of the tent before turning on the others. When Nate moved to stop Grodd, history was changed and Mallus was freed. Wally went out with the others to gaze upon Mallus' true form.

   When the team moved to stop Mallus, Wally sped over to try to keep him in place while the others used the power of the totems against him but Mallus threw Wally away and batted off each of their attacks. Sara then called for a retreat while Wally stayed to buy them some time. After the team got back to the Waverider, Wally got back to them but found that Rip had taken the time drive from the ship to use it to overload and stall Mallus in order for them to escape. Wally took Zari to the jumpship to get the replacement time drive so they could install it and have the team escape. They all mourned Rip and his sacrifice before they went off to regroup at the Old West to hide the totems. When they got there, Wally found that he enjoyed being in that era, as did Zari. They were quickly found by
   Jonah Hex
   and they told them that they were there to avoid trouble but the town was quickly invaded by
   Julius Caesar
   ,
   Freydís

   Blackbeard

   When Amaya and Nate discovered how the totems were combined to create one warrior to defeat Mallus before, the team went to attempt the same with Wally being given the

     At first, Wally came off as a rather apprehensive and unsure young man when first exposed to his father and sister, but his full personality came to light in time; he is an eager, reckless, competitive, and somewhat angry young man. His anger came from having grown up with no father, having to be the man of the house from the very beginning and taking on far more responsibility than he might have had to if he'd been raised by both parents. Despite his rage, Wally deeply loved his mom, being afraid to see her pass away and working constantly to both pay her medical expenses and to keep his mind off the pain of his impending loss and grief. Only once Iris talked him into it could he face his demons in the form of saying goodbye to his mother before her death.
    </p>
    <p key="8c07167e-7cfc-4aad-a674-88153f1276b9">
     His competitive side is seen not only in his racing career, but also in his initial interactions with Barry, feeling jealous of the constant praise Barry received from Joe and Iris and envying Barry for having been raised by Joe. This one-sided rivalry came to a halt after Joe revealed why Barry came to live with him and Iris and that Barry's tragedies are why Joe tried too hard to defend him from any criticism. After this, Wally made the decision to try to see Barry less like a rival for his father's affection and more like a brother. His competitiveness was also evident in his Flashpoint self, who groaned at being nicknamed "Kid Flash" by Iris and Barry and tried to prove to the other Flash that he doesn't need to follow anyone's lead to win against the Rival.
    </p>
    <p key="a0e70eb8-b479-4723-b3e4-733be99ac819">
     With the Flash having saved his life, he had wanted to turn his life around and make up for the things he had apparently caused. He seems to have gone to a more heroic route, attempting to stop a rogue meta-human from taking a woman's purse and later saving the Flash when overpowered by Black Siren.
    </p>
    After joining with the Legends, Wally seems to have found a good friend in Nate Heywood, as they shared similar backgrounds with distant fathers and both display cocky, womanizing attitudes.

    <p key="2de62b09-4c93-4c3d-b9dd-e9c90c08848d">
     Despite Wally's hot-headed nature, he is a courageous young man whose heart is always in the right place. After repeatedly being saved by the Flash, Wally has shown a need to validate his current life and the second chance at it by helping others at every possible opportunity; like his father, sister, and foster brother, Wally is practically incapable of turning his back on the people he cares about, having taken the burden of paying his mother's medical bills by himself for years by any means necessary. Wally has proven himself his father's son in his sense of duty, bravery and need to be there for his loved ones, no matter the cost.

    <p key="4c12a8d2-123e-447e-9ada-9bde02702e5b">
     Unfortunately, unlike Barry (when the latter first became a superhero) Wally has let his fame go to his head, to the point of becoming prideful and egoistic; as these traits of his, is what led to him being tricked by Savitar and imprisoned in the

     . However, after his time in the Speed Force, Wally has become matured as a superhero while still retaining his confidence.
    </p>
    <p key="25d0deb8-4366-470b-a4e6-b695b9a2a9e9">
     During Wally's adventures with the Legends, he (apparently) found a sense of belonging and purpose that he never found while with Team Flash, as he felt like an outcast and misfit preciously, he quickly developed a strong friendship with the team, despite his feelings that they all disliked him upon their first meeting, with Sara encouraging him to embrace this status as an outsider. However, Wally has a highly scrupulous nature when compared to the rest of the Legends as he quickly stole back Mick Rory's "souvenir" - stolen Grateful Dead sunglasses claiming disappointedly "once a thief, always a thief". Nevertheless, Wally has a playful side as when he and Rip pantsed Gary and he later takes a "souvenir" of his own by stealing another Zambesi totem.
    </p>
    <p key="d9d7cf99-29cf-4a74-b062-5a819d7c9aeb">
     Though Wally retains his impulsive, cocksure attitude and his preference of simply speeding in and getting the mission done as quickly as possible the tutelage of Zari has taught him more patience and he was able to correct the history of music on a mission without speeding unnecessarily.
    </p>
    Wally later leaves the Legends, when he realises that he hasn't truly found a sense of belonging and purpose; as he left to find his true-self.

     In the future in which Iris dies, Wally went into a fit of rage and decided to fight Savitar himself. This eventually lead to him being found by Joe with a shattered spine and being left in a catatonic state after the battle. This future was later erased when Savitar killed H.R. instead of Iris.

In the current timeline, his healing capabilities appear to be much stronger, as his palm healed perfectly only seconds after cutting it. Also, when
      Savitar

     Hyper-metabolism:

    While moving at accelerated speeds, Wally burns calories much faster than a normal person. While letting him break down food more efficiently than a regular human, this also requires him to consume large amounts of nutrients. Continued usage of his speed while deprived renders him disoriented and weak before ultimately passing from low blood glucose. Also, because of his accelerated healing, he is unaffected by painkillers, sedatives, or anesthetics, as he burns through them too quickly to have any effect. He also cannot experience joys like getting drunk as even consuming a special 500 proof alcohol only intoxicated for a few seconds. Even after an entire night of drinking with
    Rip Hunter
    (during which he drank a special "rocket fuel" alcohol made by Cisco) he only had a 3 minute long hangover.
