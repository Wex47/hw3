In their early 20s, Tommy and Oliver got into many social scandals and media-related incidents which saw them both in court more than once. In one such example, Tommy rented out an entire football stadium to play "strip kickball" with models.

   In February 2010, Tommy became furious and scolded Thea, who retorted that he wasn't her brother after Tommy told her drug dealer off. That night, Thea snuck into Tommy's 25th birthday party using a fake ID. Briefly catching up with Tommy and Laurel, Thea promised them she would behave. Suddenly, the drug dealer fell from the balcony with his neck snapped (by Oliver). The cops arrived and Tommy covered for Thea, claiming he invited her.

   Adam Hunt

   CNRI
   to talk about their future since she denied any chance of her and Oliver resuming their relationship. Laurel pointed out that Tommy isn't known for being "a one-girl type of guy", to which Tommy replied, "depends on the girl", hinting at his deeper feelings for her.

   Max Fuller

   Poison

   fiancée

When Fuller's men tried to beat up Oliver, a furious Tommy intervened, triggering a brawl until Laurel got Max to let them go. Afterwards, Diggle brought Tommy and Oliver to
   Big Belly Burger
   . Tommy was attracted to a waitress,
   Carly
   , but quickly backed down when Diggle revealed she was his sister-in-law. He then tried to apologize to Oliver for sleeping with Laurel and violating their friendship. However, Oliver assured Tommy there were no hard feelings, given that he was presumed dead. Emboldened by his friend's response, Tommy went to see Laurel as she was working at the courthouse to take her out for dinner, explaining how he wanted to become someone better for the sake of pursuing a serious relationship with her.

   When Oliver was accused of being the Hood, Tommy attended his hearing.

   As Oliver starts to head out, Tommy arrives and suggests that they take his new car for a spin. Oliver passes, saying that something important has come up, and leaves. Thea has overheard the conversation and offers to listen if Tommy has something he wants to discuss. Without going into specifics, Tommy says that he's truly interested in a woman but he doesn't think the direct approach would work for telling her his feelings. Thea suggests that he find out what the woman is interested in and then become interested in it himself, and Tommy gets an idea. As he leaves, he thanks Thea for her help.

   The next day, Tommy is already at the office, talking with

   At the fundraiser, Tommy watches Carter and Laurel dance. A drunken Thea comes up and invites him to dance, and Tommy realizes that she's flirting with him. He tells her that he thinks of her as a younger sister, but she says that Laurel doesn't understand him the way that she does. Thea says that she's used to rejection from everyone and Tommy is no exception, and Tommy gets her out as she makes a scene. Laurel notices and goes after them, and finds Thea vomiting in the back alley. Tommy angrily tells her to go back to Carter and Laurel says that she knows Carter is an ass but he also made a big donation to the legal office so she was dancing with him. Tommy admits that he's not thinking straight about her and gets Thea into the car. As he starts to go, Laurel tells him that he owes her a dance and that he earned it. As they drive away, Thea asks Tommy not to hate her and he assures her that he doesn't.

   Tommy arrives at Laurel's
   apartment
   with food at the same time as a pizza delivery man, leading to an awkward exchange between the three. Tommy, however, manages to win over Laurel with his dinner of Chinese food before asking on a proper date. They later go to a fancy restaurant where Tommy confessed that he wishes that he had just met Laurel instead, so their date wouldn't be as awkward, given their history already. However, Tommy is hit with larger problems when he discovers his credit card has been declined and later finds out that his father cut him off. He confronts Malcolm about why his trust fund was shut off. Malcolm replies harshly by stating he cannot use his father's money reasonably and needs to get a job, stating that his reckless spending has lost its charm. Malcolm even stating he thinks he should have done it sooner. Tommy tries to argue his point that it is his trust fund before his father corrects him by stating that it is his money. Tommy later visits Laurel to confess that Malcolm had cut him off completely which resulted in his multiple accounts being shut down, his car being taken from him and his apartment being taken too. However, Laurel assures Tommy that he will be fine without his father's money and offers him a space in her apartment.

Laurel soon brought up up Tommy's job position but Oliver wasn't told, leading to an awkward moment at the table. Helena learned about Oliver, Tommy, and Laurel's love triangle, which Tommy sardonically remarked the trio "were just prime for a reality show". The next day, Tommy came clean to Oliver about Malcolm cutting him off and asked for a job, to which Oliver agreed.

Tommy angrily refuses and storms out.

They are preparing for their date when Laurel gets a call from the Hood. Later, Laurel tells Tommy that she has some work to take care of and will meet him in a couple of hours at most. Laurel tells Tommy about how her father used her as bait to entrap The Hood. Tommy ultimately disapproves of her meeting The Hood, expressing that even if the vigilante has helped her, he's still a killer. Tommy says he can sympathize with Laurel over the fact that someone close to her has been lying.

He takes it to Quentin and they play back a recording of Cyrus telling them to send the Hood to meet with him or else he will "leave pieces of [Laurel] all over Starling City". Quentin realizes that only someone in the squad could have overheard his earlier conversation with Laurel about her work with the Hood. He tells Tommy that he can't trust his own men and has to make a call.

   Tommy and Oliver's relationship begins to break down. After an assassination attempt by
   Deadshot
   on Malcolm's life, Oliver reveals himself as The Hood to Tommy so that Tommy will trust Oliver to save Malcolm's life. Although obviously conflicted over Oliver's revelation, and later deeply hurt when Oliver confessed that he otherwise had no intention of telling Tommy his alter-ego as the vigilante, Tommy keeps his friend's identity a secret. Detective Lance and  Mckenna Hall would later inquire Tommy for details as Malcolm was taken by the just-arrived paramedics to the ambulance, with the female officer incredulous that Tommy went along and accepted the help of a known dangerous vigilante despite of the circumstances offering little other safe alternatives. Lance then opines how the city's vigilante went out of his way twice for Tommy's benefit now; the first being when he made his presence in the Starling first known by rescuing both Tommy and Oliver Queen from those armed men with masks. And the second having just helped in prolonging a curare-shot Malcolm Merlyn's life long enough for proper medical assistance to arrive. But all that aside, the hooded archer basically accosted every other 1 percenter he encounters in the city, with Tommy himself and those close to him seemingly the exception to that. Lance then asks if the archer was Tommy's friend, to which the latter in a perturbed tone replies that he doesn't even know the person under that hood. In a way, what Tommy said was true. From long before Oliver's return to Starling, Tommy always thought he knew the former better than anyone; that night's developments and revelation proved otherwise.

   During Verdant's grand opening, Helena captures and threatens Tommy to force Oliver's compliance in her vendetta. Their friendship becomes even more strained as Helena's return shows Tommy how dangerous it is to be around Oliver, as well as how far the latter is willing to go to do what's right. In turn, keeping Oliver's secret begins to impact Tommy's relationship with Laurel.

He realizes that despite everything that had happened between them, Laurel would still choose Oliver if Laurel ever found out that Oliver is the Hood. Once Laurel is safely back home, Tommy breaks up with Laurel and moves out without explaining why.

Enraged at Oliver's lie about Laurel, Tommy doesn't believe Oliver and wishes that Oliver had died on the island.

Their friendship was fundamentally shaken as Tommy struggled to see Oliver past a murderer, not knowing his best friend anymore.
