   in 1975, was a former ancient Egyptian priest in the service of
   Ramesses II
   who became ambitious and desired power for himself. He was also in love with the priestess
   Chay-Ara
   , but she only had eyes for Prince
   Khufu
   , and when Hath-Set learned of this, he was consumed with jealous rage.
  </p>
  <p key="48d15f39-20b9-4f76-a01d-4010d0ca9334">
   After Hath-Set attempted to murder the lovers, all three of them were exposed to a

   element during a meteor shower, which was actually a product of futuristic technology from the planet
   Thanagar
   ; as a result, Chay-Ara and Khufu were reincarnated each time they died, and Hath-Set developed the powers of regeneration, as well as that of immortality, supposedly with the condition that he would kill both the priestess and prince in each lifetime they lived in order to maintain his powers, although it appeared that the "curse" was misinterpreted in one way or another, as no future incarnation of Chay-Ara resurfaced after
   Kendra Saunders
   became a time-traveler, while Khufu's eventual reincarnation
   Scythian Torvil
   served Hath-Set as a loyal servant.
  </p>
  <p key="3aa5f213-fd6a-4351-a056-a657a5ee0208">
   At some point, Hath-Set assumed the name "Vandal Savage" and began his lifelong quest to kill each of his enemies' incarnations in each lifetime, managing to do so 206 times over the next 4000 years to maintain his own immortality.

   Savage became more ambitious and sought not to only rule Egypt, but the entire world, and over the course of time gradually began to manipulate world leaders into starting wars to prime the world for his own eventual rule. In the Pre-Flashpoint timeline, Vandal succeeds in conquering the world by 2166, leaving billions dead and the future of
   Earth-1
   in peril. Vandal also had a deep hatred for Rip for trying to murder him in the past and has made it one of his life's missions to get revenge on his foe. He was being pursued through time by
   Rip Hunter
   and his
   team
   , who were attempting to stop his reign of terror before it began. However, while in the process of attempting to reset the timeline, he was rendered mortal and made vulnerable by the meteorite, and was, with Scythian's help, fatally stabbed by Kendra Saunders before being electrocuted by Rip Hunter in 2021, set on fire by
   Mick Rory
   in 1958, and had his neck snapped by
   Sara Lance
   in 1975.

   Hath-Set was born in the Middle Kingdom of
   Egypt
   at some point before 1700 B.C. and became a priest and advisor to Pharaoh
   Ramesses II
   . However, Hath-Set secretly despised the pharaoh and desired his power. As the priest, it was Hath-Set's job to make offerings to the Egyptian god Horus, along with the Priestess
   Chay-Ara
   , and spare the land of his wrath from the celestial rocks (meteors). Hath-Set fell in love with Chay-Ara, but she was in love with the pharaoh's son, Prince
   Khufu
   .
  </p>
  <p key="adf09d9a-8930-43e0-86a9-c65cbaa60cd3">
   One day, Hath-Set was attacked by an assassin he'd nickname "
   Gareeb
   ", who managed to overpower him and hold a knife to his throat, but hesitated and Hath-Set fought back. Hath-Set was able to stall Gareeb long enough for the guards to apprehend him, and questioned him, demanding to know his name. He imprisoned the assassin in a cell and starved him for weeks but Gareeb refused to tell Hath-Set anything. Hath-Set confronted his prisoner demanding answers, but Gareeb only defended his actions, saying that he was saving the future. Hath-Set merely replied that the meteorites would destroy the kingdom and Gareeb along with it. Soon afterwards, Gareeb was able to escape. The details of how would boggle Hath-Set's mind for centuries. However, Hath-Set never forgot the man's face and would pass down the story of this assassin to his cults one day who considered him a devil to Hath-Set's story.
  </p>
  <p key="1efc3857-fac5-44c4-8a26-eb47f77508ef">
   One day, after addressing Ramesses II on the meteors and the dangers they posed, Hath-Set witnessed Chay-Ara and Khufu kissing and became consumed with rage towards them both. The following day, Hath-Set walked into Chay-Ara's bed chambers, where he saw her and Khufu together and attacked them. He fatally stabbed Khufu before stabbing Chay-Ara. As both lay dying, another storm of meteors fell from the sky and began laying waste to the kingdom. Hath-Set prayed to the gods for Khufu and Chay-Ara to suffer, whilst Chay-Ara prayed for Horus' protection. Their prayers were both fulfilled as the meteors possessed a special radiation, which affected the three of them, giving them their own forms of immortality. Hath-Set was granted immortality via cellular regeneration while Khufu and Chay-Ara's became immortal via reincarnation, a fact Hath-Set wasn't aware of for some time. However, objects in the general area of the meteor collision were also affected, including the
   Amon Dagger
   and
   Chay-Ara's bracelet
   , and absorbed the same power and remain the only objects that can kill Hath-Set, thpigh only if used by Chay-Ara as their rightful owner and no one else. At some point, Hath-Set abandoned his name and adopted the new identity "Vandal Savage".

   Some time in the next two decades, Savage discovered that Chay-Ara had reincarnated but retained no memory of her previous life, her lover Khufu, or even her real name. Much to Savage's joy, this version of Chay-Ara fell in love with him and they lived happily together for years

   without her knowing he was the very man who killed her. At some point however, Savage discovered that Khufu had also reincarnated and found Chay-Ara, helping her to remember who she really was. Following this, Chay-Ara left Savage and returned to Khufu's side. Enraged, Savage murdered them both. Upon their deaths, Savage discovered their life force transferred to him, maintaining his youth. After realizing that upon their deaths, Khufu and Chay-Ara would reincarnate in new lives in a never-ending cycle, Savage began hunting them in order to maintain his immortality.

   For 4,000 years, Savage hunted down every reincarnation of Khufu and Chay-Ara, killing them in all of their reincarnations, and by the 21st century, would achieve this 206 times. Vandal also grew ambitious and desired dominion over the entire planet, but knew the current resources of his time were insufficient to achieve such a goal, so he secretly began influencing various figures of authority into war to further the development of weapons and scientific technologies and prime the world for his eventual rule.

   Vandal became associated with

   Vandal was also taught how to resist pain by
   Robin of Locksley

   Before 1958, Savage left the U.S.S.R. and moved to
   Harmony Falls
   , Oregon. He assumed the name "Curtis Knox" and fabricated an identity as a psychiatrist, seeking employment at the local
   insane asylum

   One night, Savage felt a meteor calling to him, drawn to its landing site because it was comprised of the same compounds that granted him immortal life. Several teenagers came across the meteor as well after one couple crashed their car along the side of the road next to the meteor while drag racing. Savage abducted several of the teens with the help of the local sheriff,
   Bud Ellison
   , and took them to Hallway H, giving his newly acquired test subjects concentrated doses of
   Nth metal
   from the meteor in an effort to recreate his immortality. He only succeeded in turning them into
   monstrous bird-like creatures

Kendra didn't appear to remember her past with Savage, though he remained open to the possibility she could be faking it. Feigning ignorance, Savage invited Kendra and Ray to a mixer that he was holding that night at his home, where he began to flirt with Kendra in an attempt to learn how much she knew. However, he was shortly called back to the asylum when one of his monsters attacked and killed an orderly.

  <p key="a66bf872-b5f0-48bd-9262-efd7d5e50fbd">
   The next day, Savage came home to find that his private office had been broken into and the Amon Dagger had been stolen from a chest of his possessions. He realized that Kendra did indeed remember her past lives and was planning on killing him. That night, Savage again allowed his experiments to roam the town.
   Tommy Fuller
   , one of the teenagers from the meteor crash site, ended up attacking
   his girlfriend
   and
   Jefferson Jackson
   while the two were out on a date. Sheriff Ellison kidnapped Jefferson and brought him to Hallway H, where Savage injected him with the Nth serum. He was soon called away by a staff member at the asylum, who informed him that Kendra was awaiting him in his office. Though she presented herself as wanting to continue their discussion from the night before, Savage knew what she was plotting and discreetly stole the dagger from her purse while Kendra was trying in vain to distract him. As Kendra tried to reach for the dagger, Savage dropped the act and attempted to kill her with it, but Ray blasted Savage out the window using a gauntlet from his
   A.T.O.M. suit

   Seeking one of the Thanagarian meteorites from a rival terrorist organization, Savage traveled to Norway to acquire it, but the organization refused to give it unless he had enough money. Agreeing to their terms, Savage traveled to Norway, stole a prototype nuclear warhead from the military, and explained to his men that humanity only furthers their cause during times of strife, such an example being splitting the atom, which wasn't even thought of until
   World War II
   occurred. Savage then put this warhead on sale at the black market, which attracted the most notorious of terrorist organizations, including
   Damien Darhk
   of
   H.I.V.E.
   . As the potential buyers placed their bids, Savage sensed the presence of Khufu and Chay-Ara nearby, and sold the nuke to a newcomer, Professor
   Martin Stein
   , whom neither Savage or Darhk was familiar with. At that moment, Savage begun to suspect Stein wasn't a terrorist and offered a 25% discount to whomever killed him and his companions. At that point Stein's companions
   Leonard Snart/Captain Cold
   ,
   Mick Rory/Heat Wave

   Sara Lance/White Canary

   Carter Hall/Hawkman
   and
   Kendra Saunders/Hawkgirl
   , Khufu and Chay-Ara's future incarnations, though this Kendra was a younger version of the one encountered in 1958. Savage activated the nuke to distract the others and give himself the chance to escape. Before leaving, Savage killed the terrorists he'd planned to repay with the profit earned from the sale and re-located the meteorite.

   The auction was not a complete loss as Savage's men managed to obtain a piece of Ray's suit and began reverse-engineering its mechanisms to develop weapons, while Savage discussed the incident with his right-hand man and deduced that the attackers had technology unheard of and they must be from the future. Savage ordered his engineers to discover the mechanisms of the suit within 24 hours. When one of them expressed doubts, Vandal used the piece of technology to blast the engineer and threatened to do the same to the rest if they failed.

   Later that evening, Savage discovered that Leonard, Mick and Ray had broken into his mansion, and Snart and Ray had been caught in a trap in his gallery room. Savage found Mick and held him at gunpoint, then demanded Leonard call his companions and order them to come face him. Savage grew tired of waiting and was moments away from killing Mick, until Firestorm intervened. Though he blasted Savage, he recognized him as Jefferson Jackson from 1958 and a large fight between Savage's men and the Legends broke out outside his mansion. Whilst attempting to flee, Savage was confronted by Hawkman and Hawkgirl, with Hawkman wielding the blade that murdered their first incarnations and the two fought. Hawkman managed to impale Savage with it, only for Savage to be unharmed and turn the blade on him and stabbed him in the heart. Savage reminded a dying Hawkman that the blade belongs to Hawkgirl and she is the only one that can wield it against him. When Carter died, his life force was transferred to Savage and a vengeful Kendra attempted to avenge him, but was hopelessly outmatched against Savage and was stabbed in the chest. As he moved in on her, he confessed how much he truly loved her but reminded her they are bound by a curse of life and death that will forever separate them. Before he could deliver the fatal blow, Atom blasted Savage away and they were able to escape with her alive. Just before being blasted, Savage recognized the team's leader as Gareeb.

   Savage took Carter's body to his followers in
   Africa
   to perform the ritual to give them all an extra hundred years of life using his blood. Before he began, he was interrupted by the arrival of Sara and his archenemy Gareeb, Rip Hunter. Savage remarked on their previous encounter in Egypt but questioned Rip as to why he was trying to kill him, and why he despised him so much. Savage then searched Rip and found a locket watch with a photo of his wife and child and quickly deduced that he must have killed them in the future, and expressed excitement towards this notion. Savage then demonstrated the ritual to Rip and Sara by bleeding Carter's body into a goblet and drinking from it, increasing his own lifespan further and passed the cup to his followers and increased their own lifespan.

   The meeting was interrupted by the arrival of Leonard, Mick, and Jax, who immediately attacked Savage's followers. Rip and Sara were able to get loose too and took part in the counterattack. Savage, enraged, used the Amon Dagger to channel his powers and blast them with a large beam that also caused a shockwave then applied to the floor. However, he was attacked by Rip who managed to subdue Savage and used the dagger to cut Vandal's throat as vengeance for Miranda and Jonas, his wife and son, but unintentionally revealed their names to him. Before dying of blood loss, Savage told Rip he knew their names now and vowed that one day he would rise to power and that he'd wait until they are alive, and hunt them down and he'd kill them. Savage then temporarily died. By the time he regenerated his wounds, the others had escaped.

   When he regained consciousness, Savage realized that the only way that Gareeb was alive was due to
   time travel
   . He was then approached by the
   Time Masters
   . They revealed to him that in 2175, the Thanagarians, a race of warrior aliens, would decimate the planet and he would be the man who would rally humanity to stop them but offered him a deal. In exchange for a time machine and full immunity from prosecution by the council for his numerous time code violations, he would obey their orders, while benefiting himself. Savage agreed and began traveling between different periods of time to find the most suitable time period to conquer, and began acquiring future technologies and manipulating future events to prime the world for his own eventual conquest. One of his tasks was ensuring the deaths of Miranda and Jonas which Savage happily complied with.

Per begged his father not to give in and to eliminate them now, to which Savage agreed on, but Tor consented to Rip's terms, and after Per was released, so were White Canary and the team, escaping unharmed. Shortly afterwards, Savage was visited by Per whom Savage told a story from Greek mythology of a prince who was exiled by his father in fear of a prophecy foretelling the prince murdering him coming true, only for the son to survive and return years later to fulfill the prophecy. Savage then handed Per a knife and persuaded him that his father will make the same mistake and convinced him to murder his father. As a result of Tor's death Per was elected the new chairman but due to being underage, he elected Savage to be his proxy. For his first action as stand-in leader, Savage ordered the release of the Armageddon virus and killed billions, including Savage's wife. This led the planet ripe for conquest.

   As Ray reunited with his two friends, Savage prepared for the next round. He heard Constantine "praising" Ray, and added how great of a guy he is. He explained to the two guests how they came to terms with each other, and then asked Ray about the reasons for them fighting years prior. Ray gave a complicated explanation, and Savage said in short that it was simply about
   a girl
   . Suddenly Nora's wand began to shine, trying to bring her, Ray and Constantine back to
   Earth
   . Before the three teleported away from Hell, Savage said goodbye to his new friends, and asked them to send his regards to the Legends. After the three left, Savage expressed to himself how much he loves the team of heroes, before beginning another game of giant Jenga.

  <p key="0125b69f-8b7c-4c3f-bdbd-9a7234cb46de">
   Savage could project a facade of civility and even friendliness, but he was cold, ruthless, brutal, and obsessed with being immortal, even if it meant killing
   Chay-Ara
   and
   Khufu
   for the rest of his life in each of the latter two's different lifetimes, regardless of how many people were caught in the crossfire, as shown when he used the
   Staff of Horus
   to vaporize
   Central City
   and everyone in it (until

   changed the timeline so that this never happened). Savage took no restraint in avoiding killing innocent people, was totally amoral and capable of destroying two entire cities simply to drive Chay-Ara and Khufu out of hiding. Once, in an attempt to kill them, Savage even flooded the North China Plain, also ending two million lives. As he had killed Khufu and Chay-Ara 206 times in the past, Savage had become quite arrogant in the present, thinking that they were no longer a challenge for him and believing that he could defeat the combined forces of

   by himself. Though he was almost proven right, as he did kill them all in an alternate timeline, his underestimation of their capabilities is what led to his own downfall, as his body was reduced to a pile of ash by Green Arrow and Flash using the
   Staff of Horus
   . Although, since it wasn't used against him by the right person (presumably himself, as it belonged to him in Ancient Egypt), this still didn't kill him, and he eventually returned.
  </p>
  <p key="3d730237-b821-4328-b6e6-0c15dcd9fc3a">
   Savage was also very vengeful, as he despised Rip Hunter for trying to murder him in Egypt and waited 4000 years to get revenge by murdering his wife and son. He also had a deep love for Chay-Ara, despite the affection not being returned, and seeing her with Khufu made Vandal so consumed with rage, thus his motive for murdering them in the first place. However, Savage still expressed his love to her in each lifetime and says he always will love her, but viewed them both as tortured souls imprisoned by a circle of death and they could never be together. On certain occasions, he expressed some regret over having to kill her and at one point even offered her prolonged life by his side. When the first reincarnation of Chay-Ara fell in love with him, Savage noted he was joyful and they were happy together only for it to end when Khufu's reincarnation took her from him, much to his rage and bitterness which led to him apparently believing he could never have her, even expressing a bit of sympathy towards Ray for his feelings for Kendra. He was not entirely incapable of love outside with Kendra, having had many wives and children that he did try to not involve in his darker acts and expressed a level of sadness as he commented on how he had held them many times as they died of old age and he was quickly enraged when Cassandra was kidnapped to the point of releasing the Leviathan and overjoyed to see her return safely and appeared to show a level of remorse as she angrily confronted him.
  </p>
  <p key="f76b6efe-3018-4ee8-8652-83123808f87b">
   Savage's ultimate goal, one he pursued his whole life, was complete subjugation of the entire planet. To achieve this, Vandal worked with the most nefarious of warlords throughout history, such as guiding Julius Caesar through the Gaelic Wars, becoming Genghis Khan's most trusted adviser, and becoming a close ally of Joseph Stalin. He also manipulated people into starting conflicts for him, such as manipulating Gavrilo Princip into starting World War I and is implied to have played a role in John F. Kennedy's assassination. The ultimate outcome of these manipulations is to further the development of weapons technologies and scientific advancements to prime the world for his own rule. He was also very egotistical, stating that he sees himself as a force of nature and a servant of will enabling destiny, trying to make it a better place at any cost regardless of how many wars it takes.

The
    Oculus

    According to
    Rip Hunter
    , Savage could be killed by the reincarnations of Hawkgirl and Hawkman, due to the three having their life forces tied together because of the
    Thanagar
    meteor's exposure. However, this could only be done when they are wielding tools that imbued from the Thanagarian meteor. Additionally, they must wield an object that they themselves personally owned, as Hawkman used Chay-Ara's

However, this weakness was only of limited danger to him, as Savage was restored to life after failing to kill them in 2015 - albeit apparently with aid from

     Thanagarian meteorite radiation:

    Objects exposed to the meteorite radiation the night Savage gained his powers can gravely injury and permanently kill him if wielded by Hawkgirl or Hawkman. The very meteorite radiation that gave Savage his immortality could also leave him vulnerable. When within the general area of the meteor while its radiation is exposed, it would disrupt the energy already inside of him, making him mortal and as vulnerable to death as anyone. Being within the meteorite's vicinity while activated is the only way someone other than Hawkgirl and Hawkman can kill him.

     :

    The Staff of Horus is an
    Nth metal
    artifact that was used by Savage as a melee weapon in close quarter combat, and as a mid-range weapon by shooting blue energy blasts and waves of mystical nature at his enemies. Contact with these waves meant instant incineration. By knocking the butt of the staff onto the ground, Savage could conjure up a magical energy blast which grows to the size of a metropolis, burning alive every human in its path. The weapon had an energy field that physically kept others from even touching the staff, sending those who tried flying through the air.
    Specialized gauntlets
    were made by
    Cisco Ramon
    to render this protection useless. While the user could touch the staff and even fire its energy, its energy aura was harmful to them and forced the user to release the staff before it could kill them. The staff would even resist the users ability to fire its energy, causing it to be unable to burn or harm what it was fired at. When

   </li>
   <li key="ff8a64e7-7370-4aa3-8398-32fa57bf38cf">
    The conflict between Savage, Hawkman and Hawkgirl resembles the conflict between Gentleman Ghost and Hawkman in the pre-Flashpoint continuity. Jim Craddock was an English highwayman who was wrongly murdered by the American gunslinger Nighthawk, Prince Khufu's 19th century reincarnation. As a result, Craddock became the revenant Gentleman Ghost and sets out to murder Khufu's latest incarnation in order to put his soul to rest. Unfortunately, due to the endless cycle of reincarnation affecting Khufu's soul, Craddock is unable to accomplish this feat and is forced to remain undead. Savage was briefly Hawkman's archenemy post-Zero Hour until Hawkman was temporarily written out of the comics.
