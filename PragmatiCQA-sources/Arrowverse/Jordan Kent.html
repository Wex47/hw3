   As a result of the merging of
   Earth-38
   with
   Earth-1
   and
   Earth-TUD5
   , the timeline was changed, resulting in
   Lois
   and
   Clark
   having twins instead of just one son. They were born in 2007 instead of 2019.
  </p>
  <p key="717cca08-5472-4333-ae68-205369a17b90">
   Jordan had destructive outbursts and tantrums that were eventually diagnosed as social anxiety disorder, while
   Jonathan
   was a happy, athletic kid. As a child, Lois and Clark took Jordan and Jonathan to spend a summer in
   Smallville
   , where they met
   Sarah Cushing
   . There, Jordan was quiet writing in his notebook.
  </p>
  <p key="d9ef8bcc-3ad9-4a29-819d-8e7be4af6cfe">
   In Jordan's teenage years, he started therapy.
   He took piano lessons, but dropped out when his anxiety got too strong for him to play.
   At
   Metropolis High School
   , Jordan was bullied by several students, including
   Jimmy Cutter
   .

  <p key="9698fcaa-1a49-4350-8d9c-6f73fbc65f92">
   One night, after having dinner with Jonathan and Lois, Jordan went to his room to play video games, when Clark returned
   home
   , he went into Jordan's room and apologized for missing the day's therapy, Jordan said that his mother had already said that he was working, his father also said that Jordan was a great Superman in the game, with Jordan responding that
   Superman
   was boring and he was playing as
   Raiden
   , Clark said that if he needed to talk, he was there. When he was leaving, Jordan told him to turn up the music.
  </p>
  <p key="308f7b06-1ae6-495f-be3e-1b6451bc295d">
   The next morning, when Jordan left his room, Jonathan questioned him about his outfit, with Jordan answering him sarcastically. Then they went to school. When Jordan's grandmother,
   Martha Kent
   died, he went to her funeral in Smallville, there, when Jordan was eating, Jonathan asked him if he had taken his pills from him, Jordan said he was not his mother, with Jonathan saying that someone had to look after him, when Jonathan saw Sarah and
   her family
   arriving, he warned Jordan and they went over to meet them with his parents, Sarah said she was sorry for his loss of him, when his parents left, they talked about the summer they met.
  </p>
  <p key="d6c49c9c-6b56-47c4-aae1-efa1a4052e29">
   Then Sarah asked what had in the
   Kent farm
   barn, so he and Jonathan accompanied her there. While in the barn, Sarah said that almost anything there could kill them and that Smallville sucks. Sara then asks for Jordan's phone. Sara then picks up the phone and says that there will be a bonfire tomorrow and he can go. Jordan tries to impress Sarah by climbing on the scaffold without a ladder to reach the router, but he falls hard on the ground when the straps that hold the steel beams are broken. Jonathan then tries to save his brother from the steel beams by jumping in front of him, but Jordan manages to turn them over and save them both. Sara alerts Clark, who finds the boys, and quickly takes the steel beams off them.
  </p>
  <p key="448a9af8-d048-48e1-a35b-523f1ec483c8">
   Then, a doctor examines them and says that they only have mild concussions. Then they go to their rooms. Jonathan says he missed training for the week and Jordan asks him if he really cares about it now. Jonathan said that if he wants to stick to something, it must be Sarah Cushing. He takes Jordan's cell phone and mocks the message the other one sent to Sarah, calling him freaky and Jordan says they need to find out what happened in the barn.
  </p>
  <p key="362f84e2-d73d-4401-a989-2fbdc535d170">
   The next morning, Jordan and Jonathan investigate the barn; he finds it strange that they are not dead. Their search reveals a
   spaceship
   , which scares Jon. Jordan takes a crystal from the ship and Jonathan asks what it is, with Jordan responding that whatever it is, it is not from
   Kansas
   .
  </p>
  <p key="42d82245-7ed6-404d-9f84-76deb9ff2aec">
   When Lois and Clark return home, the twins confront their parents and Clark reveals his origins; to prove his alter ego, he lifts his car over his head while flying, surprising the twins, who feel they have heard lies all their lives and angrily leave. Later, they go to Sarah's party.
  </p>
  <p key="83d46473-77c6-4696-9c15-010afb080b4f">
   While they talk, his attraction to her becomes overwhelming and he kisses her passionately. Sara reveals that she has a boyfriend, just as he appears to fight. Jonathan steps in front.
  </p>
  <p key="09fdce30-11c4-4941-84ab-910a5911461f">
   But soon several boys are beaten up, until Jordan accidentally uses his heat vision and explodes the bonfire. At Kent farm, Jonathan asks what will happen to Jordan and Clark says he doesn't know. Jordan explains what it was like to use the powers and Jon then says that Jordan can control, which is like learning to drive, if the cars were indestructible and with giant lasers, infuriating Jordan, who leaves the salt and goes to his room. He then has a conversation with his father on the porch, who says that everything will be fine. The next morning, the twins talk to Sarah about what happened the night before. He gives them privacy for them to talk alone. After talking, she gets in the car and leaves.

   Later, Lois and Clark decided to move to Smallville with their children, to be closer as a family and allow Jordan to explore his powers. His parents also decided to keep Jordan out of school until he could control his powers. In the next day, Clark took Jordan to the
   Fortress of Solitude
   , so Jonathan went to the
   new school
   alone. In the Fortress, the hologram of
   Jor-El
   talked about the destruction of
   Krypton
   and
   its cities
   .
  </p>
  <p key="e9b6cf84-eaa6-4edf-8ab7-df2859fde2a6">
   The tests at the Fortress indicated that his displays of superpowers were random occurrences and he would never be able to use them at will or be like his father. When they returned to Kent farm, Jordan was distraught that he was not apparently special and got into a shouting match with Jonathan, who was angry at his life being disrupted for Jordan’s benefit. The two started to argue until Lois appeased the situation and the two went to their rooms. Then they went to the
   Cushing family
   barbecue, where they met Sarah and
   Sophie Cushing
   . That night, the brothers made up and he thanked Jonathan for agreeing to move to Smallville and for always protecting him. The next morning, Clark allowed him to go to school.
  </p>
  <p key="1fe6c61e-342c-4829-91be-5e74d2f28b15">
   The next morning, they were trying to paint the house until Clark heard something and had to leave. Then they went to school, where he talked to Sarah until Sean and other members of the football team intimidated him, despite Jonathan's efforts to protect him. Then his father suddenly showed up at school, making the bullies go away and making the twins angry. He also heard Sarah and Sean break up and was interrupted by Timmy.
  </p>
  <p key="758998b0-1bd8-4f91-b706-3efe982978d4">
   Jordan decided to participate in football training. Secretly using his powers, he took down all his opponents, imprecating the
   trainer
   and making Jonathan angry. They also chatted with Sarah at
   Victoria May's
   , until
   Lana
   came out and yelled her out. When his parents learned that Jordan had joined the team, they forbade him to play. Later, Jonathan convinced Clark to let Jordan play for the team, telling him how his confidence and social skills had improved while playing on the team.
  </p>
  <p key="e73a6b47-7265-468d-8852-df2e52ee274d">
   As Jordan became the star of the team and popular with his colleagues, his mental health improved considerably, stopping him from having anxiety attacks. Jordan participated in his first game with the
   Smallville Crows
   and defeated all his opponents, being applauded by his family and friends. After the game was over, he and his brother went to a party at
   Corey Wellnitz
   's lake house, where they met Sarah. The next day,
   <a href="Sam Lane.html" key="1ebcc0cc-6c5b-46a1-b8c6-234d9183330d" title="Sam Lane">
    Sam Lane

   told the twins not to distract their father from duties as Superman. Later, Jordan and Jon followed
   Tag Harris
   when he ran off alone into the forest. They found him suffering immense pain due to the uncontrollable vibration. As Tag had been injured by the bonfire explosion, Jordan believed that he is the culprit.
  </p>
  <p key="d235c37a-0e83-400f-b775-d6fc07f6ace0">
   Jon wanted to call Clark for help, but Jordan reminded him of Sam's warnings, and blaming himself for Tag's situation, he tried to help him. Tag threw Jordan away, knocking him unconscious, so Jon used the signaling device to call their father. Back at home, Jonathan assured Jordan that he was not responsible for Tag’s condition, which was proved true when Sam explained that government scientists had determined Tag’s powers came from being exposed to a
   nearby yellow phosphorescence
   in the mines. When Clark asked why the two of them didn't call for him as soon as they learned about Tag, the brothers revealed that Sam had told them not to bother Clark with their problems, to their parent's joint fury.

  <p key="23c08ef8-da89-47e0-9582-44d758598ecd">
   Jordan is working on the farm with his family to prepare for the upcoming Smallville Harvest Festival. Later, he and Jon go to school, where Jon receivs a call from his girlfriend Eliza and she breaks up with him. When they return home, Jordan tells his parents what had happened. Sarah asked Jordan to go on a date to Smallville’s Harvest Festival with her, which was Jordan’s first date. At the Festival, they talked and got closer, however the moment was ruined when Jon arrived with Timmy Ryan and another boy, and drunkenly made fun of them both. Disgusted with his behaviour due to her father’s alcoholism, Sarah stormed off. The next day she told Jordan she was not ready to date anyone at the moment, but asked that they stay friends, which he agreed to. As Jordan was walking home, he was ambushed by Tag Harris, demanding to know what had happened to him.

  <p key="8377d48d-ffd8-4b79-ab66-598e1f7f95cd">
   So Jordan used his
   signal device
   to summon Superman, who tried to stop Tag but failed. After the attack, Jordan returned home and began to experience painful migraines triggered by the development of his super hearing. At
   school
   , Jordan had the pains again; Jonathan wanted to tell his parents but Jordan asked him not to as he wanted to participate in the next
   Crows
   game in
   Metropolis
   .
  </p>
  <p key="ddaf2a7d-a959-4150-8d1d-570b6be2f35e">
   The game was against Jonathan's old team in Metropolis, which was formed by boys used to bullying Jordan. During the game, Jordan was temporarily incapacitated by his migraine and failed to protect the Crows quarterback. Jonathan was sent to replace him and the brothers managed to rally the team and lead them to win the game. In the final play, Jordan was tackled and beaten by
   Jimmy Cutter
   and the other rival players, causing him to lose control of his heat vision; which Clark managed to block with his hand.
  </p>
  <p key="88729be5-ba30-41e0-a1ab-5d89f91ed4ee">
   Back in the hotel room, Clark questioned Jordan about what had happened, prompting Jonathan to tell the truth about Jordan's migraines and he berated them for not telling them sooner. Clark had to leave when Lana called him and shortly afterwards his team members showed up and asked them to come out and celebrate.
  </p>
  <p key="c450053f-3ded-4820-a524-67b0e0959bfd">
   Cutter and a few other Metropolis players followed them and began bullying Jordan, with Cutter trying to goad him into a fight. Though Jonathan tried to calm him down, Jordan was going to smack Cutter over the head with all his might, but Jonathan thrust his fist forward, making the bones in his hand break. Back at Kent Farm, they told their parents what had happened and Jordan apologized, but Jonathan refused to accept and his parents were disappointed that he used his powers like that.
  </p>
  <p key="764d1721-9fda-4cd1-a5e3-62db3668eba8">
   The next day, Sarah told Jordan what happened when Tag kidnapped her, on the theory that he gave Tag the powers. Jordan told her he had no idea what Tag was talking about. After everything that happened, Jordan started to cry and told Lois that he wished he didn't have powers. Then he started having another migraine and fell to the ground having a seizure. So Clark arrived and took him to the
   Fortress of Solitude
   .
  </p>
  <p key="0ee39e8e-4299-46c5-b893-79a9e38e0655">
   Jor-El
   A.I. tells Clark that Jordan will feel pain until he learns to control his super hearing. Jordan started to hear everything around him, so he started using headphones to muffle the sounds. He managed to focus his hearing on Sarah, and he heard her talking to Jonathan. Believing his brother was flirting with Sarah, Jordan punched the wall angrily. When Jon returned home, Jordan confronted him; they argued and Jordan was unable to tolerate Jonathan's pain screaming at him, eventually passing out when Jon slapped the wall. Later, Jordan heard Clark being assaulted by
   the Stranger
   and told Jonathan, so they took a car and drove to the scene and managed to incapacitate the Stranger. Back at Kent Farm, Jordan apologized to Jon for everything that had happened. They reconciled and their parents decided to no longer keep secrets, promising to answer their questions. Jordan asked them to explain who the stranger was.
  </p>

   Jordan then decided to quit the football team after what happened to Jonathan. Later, Jordan convinced Sarah to participate in the school's music audition, as he had to leave music as a child because of his anxiety. At the audition, Kyle didn't show up and Sarah was too nervous to perform alone, so Jordan offered to join her playing the piano, they both had an excellent performance.

   During final rehearsals, Jordan began to sneeze and cough up icy air. He called Clark, who took him home and his condition began to deteriorate. His parents deduced that Jordan had caught a Kryptonite disease transmitted by Clark when he was stricken with synthetic Kryptonite. Jordan wanted to go back and not let Sarah down, but he started having trouble breathing and Clark took him to the Fortress. The A.I. scanned him and determined that the kryptonite in his lungs had caused a respiratory infection and his lungs were filling with fluid. The infection had also triggered his frozen breath and the fluid was starting to solidify, which would kill him. The only treatment was to burn the kryptonite inside him. The procedure was extremely painful, but Jordan endured it with his father's help. Clark heard that Lois and Jon were in trouble so he went back to the farm with Jordan to help them. After their Kryptonian-possessed neighbors attacked them, the army and Sam Lane decided to stay in Smallville to protect them.

   Jordan eventually learns from his

   Morgan Edge
   is a kryptonian named Tal-Rho but that he is also Clark's brother and therefore his uncle. The next day, Sarah told Jordan and Jon how she believed
   her father
   's alcoholism had gotten worse. Believing she deserved to know the truth, they told her that Kyle was possessed by a Kryptonian and took her to see him at an army facility where he was being held. Jordan tried to comfort her and encouraged her to keep hope. When multiple citizens from Smallville who were converted started to group together to kill Superman, Jordan and his brother hid while his father dealt with the army, though Clark didn't return home afterwards.

   After Tal-Rho's attack Jordan and Jon go talk to Sarah, who thanks the two for being straightforward with her when everyone else seemed to have secrets. Sarah then requests a second alone with Jordan an kisses him, saying that she would like to be more than friends now. When returning to their house, Tal-Rho droped from the sky before the three to tell them that his father won't be returning, after telling him to leave Jordan attacks Rho with his jeat vision but he was no match for the very experienced kryptonian as he got thrown to the ground by Rho's heat vision. His father eventually arrives in a weakened state to stop Rho from killing them and says that he will do anything he desires if it means saving his family, Tal-Rho agrees to this and takes Clark.

   Jordan suffers from social anxiety disorder, as a result he has been shown to lash out when stressed as both a child and a teenager, he is best described as a loner, not socializing much with kids of his own age and a lack of interest in what others think of him. He also has a small sense of self-confidence that was further shaken when he learned from Jor-El's AI that he wouldn't amount to being as special as his father. Yet, it has started to grow when he joined the football and started to become friends with his fellow teammates. Despite trying to remain closed off to others, he has shown an instant connection with his childhood crush,
    Sarah Cushing
    and a strong bond with his twin brother,
    Jonathan Kent
    , seeing him be attacked by kids at the bonfire is what caused Jordan to activate his heat vision for the first time.

   Jordan seems to be closer to his mother,
    Lois Lane
    than to his father,
    Clark Kent
    as she has been more present in his life while Clark was saving the world as Superman, she was able to comfort him during an anxiety attack and Jordan felt particularly betrayed by her knowing about his father's secret identity and not telling him, Jordan has grown distant from his father because he was always traveling for "work" and this has caused resentment to build towards him. However, this rift has possibly began to heal as Clark was able to comfort Jordan after the emergence of his powers and promising to be there for him.

However, it's consistency is unknown as he is seen to be knocked down, beaten up and bleeding from punches and kicks from normal humans, which calls into question the length of his ability to store solar rays in his cells; it is possible that his durability does not extend every part of his body or it is still not yet at the same level as his father, Clark's.
         Jordan was vulnerable to Tag; due to the latter's amplified strength and speed. He was able to punch through his bedroom wall without receiving a scratch on him, and later survived a car crash.

         Jor-El
         's hologram said his mechanosensations had become significantly enhanced and his auditory perception caused an allodynic response; until he can control what he heard, every sound would be accompanied by pain, and would require practice to focus. He was able to briefly concentrate on the just the voices of Sarah and his brother, but Jordan lost focus, when he heard them bonding. He later replicated this to locate his father, Clark, who was several miles away, and later when he attempted to find him again, he was able to hear either Australia or New Zealand until he heard his father yelling from the Badlands. He overheard a conversation between his father and
         Lana Lang Cushing
