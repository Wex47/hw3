   M'gann M'orzz was born and raised on the planet
   Mars
   . She hails from an underground warmonger race of psychic shape-shifters known as
   White Martians
   . Although M'gann's
   mother
   wasn't an openly affectionate parent, the former always cared deeply for her. When M'gann reached adulthood, she had a combined marriage with a White Martian named
   Armek
   , whom she regarded as the worst of their kind.
  </p>
  <p key="4d6277f0-e6df-4624-be0c-6faf69a6d241">
   When M'gann's people invaded the surface of their world and wiped out the peaceful race of the
   Green Martians
   in the so-called "
   Martian Holocaust
   ", she served as a prison guard in the Galle Crater's internment camp. However, M'gann could not stand the slaughter of all the innocent Greens at the hand of her kind, so when her superiors ordered her to kill a Green Martian boy, she refused and instead turned on the guards, killing many of them in a fire.
   M'gann then staged a prison break, trying to free as many Greens as she could and escape with them. Unfortunately, her attempt was thwarted by the other surviving guards, who came after her and managed to kill everyone but M'gann.
   She had a confrontation with her husband, Armek, whom M'gann disfigured
   before escaping from Mars. M'gann sought refuge on
   Earth
   , where she hid for centuries.

   Eventually, M'gann found a work at an
   alien bar
   in
   National City
   , where she took the form of a
   human
   woman and the alias of "Megan" to blend in.
   When
   Alex Danvers
   visited the bar to ask an alien for information about
   Scorcher
   , M'gann told her where the alien might be.

J'onn replied that they should preserve what they have lost, but M'gann says that she wants to forget about everything. The next day, J'onn came to Al's Dive Bar to apologize M'gann, but they are kidnapped by Roulette's guards and forced to fight to the death for the title of "last Green Martian".

After J'onn left, however, M'gann looks at herself in the mirror mortified and assumes her real White Martian form.

J'onn went into her mind where he found M'gann in a memory of her time at the Galle Crater's internment camp.

Later, Armek arrived on Earth and threatened M'gann that he will start hurting her friends if she doesn't return. M'gann refused and J'onn took her to D.E.O. for protection. But when they realized the presence of two M'gann's inside D.E.O., it is revealed that Armek disguised himself as M'gann in order to get in. Armek caused enough of chaos to disguise himself as a D.E.O. agent, and M'gann demonstrated that fire can be used to expose a disguised White Martian. Armek had taken the appearance of Winn and surprised Supergirl and J'onn. As he set the reactor core to meltdown, J'onn took M'gann to search the building while Supergirl and Alex checked the basement. M'gann and J'onn discovered Winn and Alex, meaning that Armek brought another White Martian inside, who had disguised as Alex. Eventually the heroes managed to defeat Armek and his companion, with M'gann killing Armek herself. Afterwards M'gann decided to return to Mars, convinced that there were other White Martians who had the same intentions as hers. She kissed J'onn and leaves.
