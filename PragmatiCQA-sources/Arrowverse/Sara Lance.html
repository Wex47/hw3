   The two would also race to see who could climb to the top of a tree first and Sara won every time. Years later however, she suspected that Laurel deliberately lost their races, knowing Sara was a sore loser.

   When Sara was 10 years old,
   her father bought her a pet
   canary
   which she loved, but it drove everyone else crazy.
   At one point, Sara visited
   Starling City Aquarium
   and got a stuffed shark, which was her favorite childhood toy. She would hold the shark close to her chest anytime something bad happened to her.
   Sara attended Starling City Elementary, where she once starred as Peter Pan in the school play. When it was time for her to come onstage, Sara suddenly blanked and forgot her lines so she spontaneously did a tap dance before running off in embarrassment, crying.

   During her high school years, Sara faced bullying from a classmate,
   Gwen
   , and the latter's two friends because she was making a move on Gwen's boyfriend, who was her lab partner. The frequent occurrences of harassment created behavioral issues in Sara and caused her grades to drop, worrying her parents. When Quentin tried confronting her, Sara refused to tell him, and later Laurel, anything, determined to deal with the problem herself. However, when she returned home with a black eye, Quentin decided to teach Sara and Laurel how to defend themselves. Afterwards, the sisters worked together to fight off Gwen and her friends.

   As a teenager, Sara was rebellious and a troublemaker, which often got her into tricky situations, subsequently putting her at odds with her father. One such incident had her being arrested for shoplifting but Quentin made the charges go away.
   Thus, Sara was closer to her mother growing up due to her and Dinah's shared free-spirited natures.
   In her teens, Sara dated many delinquents, much to her father's chagrin, from whom she learned skills such as hot-wiring a car.
   Sara's dates also tried getting her drunk in hopes of coercing her into having sex. However, she proved to have an abnormally strong tolerance for alcohol and always drank the guys under the table.

  <p key="a70db99f-52c7-401a-8914-d893a1f79778">
   Sara soon developed a crush on Oliver and in 2005, she snuck out of the house to go to a party held at Tommy's
   home
   to see him. However, Oliver was too drunk to acknowledge her and ended up spilling his beer on Sara, much to her embarrassment. She was then pulled in by the cops and grounded by her father for a month. Sara later believed that Laurel had called the cops to ruin her chances with Oliver, since he and her sister got together not long after.

   In late 2007, Oliver started pursuing Sara after having second thoughts about moving in with Laurel.
   Excited that her teenhood crush was paying attention to her and wanting to get back at Laurel for what happened at Tommy's party, Sara quickly began sleeping with him.
   Later, she returned home from college to spend time with her family during a three-day weekend but was secretly texting Oliver; he had invited Sara to come with him on the

   voyage, though she was initially hesitant. That night, Sara attempted to caution Laurel against her expectations of getting engaged to Oliver, a known playboy, since he wasn't the type to take such a big step yet. However, an outraged Laurel perceived this as her sister being a "bitch", upsetting Sara and spurring her into accepting Oliver's offer.

   trip as Sara was preparing to leave, her mother unexpectedly arrived home early and caught the former in the process of packing her clothes, including her
   Starling Rockets

   Sara's apparent death had multiple effects on the Lance family. For Laurel, she couldn't properly grieve her sister after Sara betrayed her by sleeping with Oliver, but couldn't be angry either because she had died, and thus struggled to come to terms with her death.
   Quentin fell into a deep state of depression, becoming an alcoholic, and buried himself in his work in an attempt to ignore his pain, taking every case that passed his desk without pause.
   Sara was also the first and last thought of Quentin's mind every day and it took him years to get past that point. His drinking and work obsession eventually lead to Dinah divorcing him.
   Dinah harbored great guilt and remorse for not stopping Sara from going on the

When they found the place empty, Ivo left a bomb in the plane and had Oliver lead them to the gravesite. When they arrived at the cave, the guards started questioning Oliver for the
   hōzen
   , an arrowhead which should have been buried with the bodies. Soon, Shado and Slade ambushed the crew at arrow and gun point and demanded Oliver back. When Ivo released him, Oliver punched the captain in the face, grabbed Sara, and escaped.

   After they got away Shado revealed she had the hōzen which they discovered had coordinates on it, leading to the location of the submarine which housed the Mirakuru which Ivo believed to be the cure to save all of mankind. After Sara revealed this to them, Oliver asked if it could cure Slade.
   They used the hōzen to locate the submarine, in which they quickly found the Mirakuru. Oliver injected Slade, even after Sara told him that Slade would likely not survive it without a sedative. Slade began to react badly, with eradic screaming and blood pouring from his eyes. Eventually, he turned quiet and Sara confirmed he had no heartbeat. Before they could begin to mourn, Ivo and his men barged in, taking the three of them captive.

   Anthony took Sara and Shado hostage and held them in front of Oliver, telling him to pick who would die between Shado and Sara, threatening to kill them both if Oliver didn't decide within 30 seconds. After the time had passed, Ivo aimed his gun at Sara, only for Oliver to run in front of her in a desperate attempt to stop him from killing her. Taking that as his choice, Ivo quickly turned his gun over to Shado and shot her in the head. Just then, the newly Mirakuru-empowered Slade appeared and saw Shado dead. In his rage, he killed Ivo's men and stole the rest of the Mirakuru, but Ivo managed to escape. When Slade asked who killed Shado, Sara quickly answered that Ivo just shot Shado for no apparent reason.

As they were walking, Sara and Oliver asked Slade where they were going and he responded that they were heading back to the plane in order to get geared up to kill Ivo and his men. Sara told him he couldn't as Ivo had too many dangerous people working for him. This angered Slade who accused Sara of still working for Ivo but Oliver stepped between them. Slade lifted Oliver a foot off the ground, choking him. Sara promptly hit Slade with a branch, making him let go of Oliver and causing him to realize what he'd done.

They turned to consult with Slade, only to realize that he had disappeared and taken the Mirakuru with him.
   Sara suggested they should consider Ivo's offer which angered Oliver. At night they had a heart-to-heart but after Oliver fell asleep, she took the radio and contacted Ivo. He asked if she was okay but she questioned if he even cared as not long ago he was close to shooting her. He claimed he would never have done that but she was upset that he killed Shado. He tried to win her sympathy, saying the darkness had taken over and that he needed her but Sara told him she would rather die than help him again.

   Preparing for battle, Sara concocted some cocculus indicus to counteract sodium pentathol, which Sara with all her knowledge of Ivo's tactics assumed he would use on Oliver. They agreed to destroy the Mirakuru to make sure that even if their plan went south, Ivo would never get his hands on it. Later that night, Slade produced a bottle of Australian rum, one of the few things that survived the plane's crash, for them all to drink to commemorate their last night on the island.

   The next day, they prepared for battle. Oliver purposefully got himself captured while Sara and Slade kept watch from a highpoint on the island. As Sara had predicted, Ivo had Oliver injected with sodium pentothal or truth serum. Per Sara's instructions, Oliver acted dazed and began answering Ivo's questions, claiming Sara and Slade had built a raft and were in the engine room of the ship. Ivo sent all his men there to find them and Oliver was taken back to his cell, but along the way he knocked the guards out and took their keys.

   Thomas Flynn

As gunfire broke out between the crew and the prisoners, Sara took cover and was soon joined by Oliver who informed her that Ivo had told Slade the truth about Shado's death and he had now turned on them. Realizing the battle was lost, Sara told Oliver they had to retreat, so they along with some of the prisoners, one of whom was

   Sara took the prisoners with her to their old base where she was contacted by Slade on the radio. He told her that the engine had broken and he was willing to free Oliver if she gave him Hendrick, who was an engineer. Sara lied that Hendrick hadn't made it to the island but Slade called her bluff and gave her one hour to deliver Hendrick to him or he would kill Oliver. Hendrick started pointing his gun at Anatoly, but Sara knocked him out from behind and then agreed to Slade's terms.
   Knowing handing him over would be a death sentence regardless, Sara got the idea to use Hendrick as a way to kill Slade. She had Anatoly extract the explosives out of a landmine and planted them on Hendrick before handing him over. However, once they made the trade, Slade found the explosives and pulled his gun on Sara but he soon concluded that dying would be too good for them and they deserved to suffer on the island until their deaths.

They agreed to the deal and after being told where the cure was, Sara prepared to shoot him but Oliver stopped her, shooting him himself as to spare Sara of the heaviness of having to take a life.

Back home, Sara talked with Laurel and Thea about the situation, thanking Laurel for gifting her another chance at life but deciding she needed to seek solitude away from the city to battle her bloodlust and start fresh. She bid a tearful farewell to Laurel, promising to make good on the "gift" Laurel gave her.

Sara was reluctant, citing her still dealing with her recent death and subsequent struggle with bloodlust, but her sister pointed out that this could be an opportunity for her to become a hero in the light. Laurel gave Sara the identity of White Canary, along with

   his wife
   and
   son

   The team was shocked but after exchanging thoughts, they decided to keep going. They would stop Savage and become legends of the future, or die trying.
   Still in 1975, Sara and the team traveled to
   Norway
   and attempted to intercept a black market arms bazaar, where Savage was likely to participate. The team managed to infiltrate the place and wanted to kidnap Savage. To avoid suspicion, they began to bid as well, which resulted in them accidentally buying the nuclear warhead.

   so Sara accompanied the older Martin and
   Jefferson Jackson
   to
   Ivy Town
   , where they met a 25-year-old Martin. The older Martin was largely annoyed when Sara started to shamelessly flirt with his younger self to get into his good graces. Martin explained he could not have "a sexy assassin from the future" distracting his younger self, as he was about to meet his
   future wife
   though Sara was only amused at Martin calling her "sexy". As they tried to steal the device, young Martin walked in and confronted them. As he threatened to call the cops, Sara knocked him out which shocked older Martin.

  <p key="692b24b4-d4ce-449d-9738-b7f5b1ca594f">
   The group tracked the piece to Savage's lab and Sara easily defeated all guards and retrieved the piece. They then learned that Leonard, Ray, and Rory were in trouble. The group went to Savage's mansion where they fought his troops while the hawks,

   Amon Dagger
   , but he revealed that the dagger had to be wielded by Kendra and stabbed Carter in the chest, killing him. He then injured Kendra and was about to kill her when the rest of the team saved her and retreated. The group conversed as they expressed doubt in their abilities to do anything useful. Rip told them Savage was still at play and the group agreed to help him and promised to take down Savage for Carter.

  <p key="6b4c4898-0dcb-436e-8a3f-73397006b42f">
   The group traveled to
   Leipzig
   , Germany and Rip explained that they could not time jump as Kendra was still injured and would not survive that in her state. The team were skeptical but Rip told them his idea was still to stop Savage in the past and thus save the future. Sara spoke with Rip in private and told him that she knew he did not have a plan and that his rousing speech was only to convince himself. Sara opted that since they could not kill Savage they could perhaps slow him down. Quoting

   , Sara told Rip that they could cripple Savage's financial resources to slow him down for decades. They found out Savage stored his assets at the
   Bruemberg Group
   . Rip initially wanted to go alone, as he did not want more people to die on his mission but Sara insisted to go with him.

   At the bank, Rip and Sara met
   Mr. Blake
   and handed him valuable doubloons to deposit in an account. As Blake left, Rip checked the computer. However, Sara had realized the bank's employees were Savage's followers, noting to Rip that Blake was a Kuroda-trained swordsman, his secretary armed, and his guards were South African mercenaries. Rip doubted her judgement but just then, the group confronted the duo. Sara drew out her hidden stash of knives and she and Rip engaged the group in a fight. Sara killed all of them but Rip stopped her down just in time before she murdered Blake as well. They took Blake to the
   <i key="3553d7a1-d4ca-4f29-bfcf-e0d0af3ada7b">
    Waverider

   , where Rip questioned Sara on her murderous rage. Sara revealed she was suffering from bloodlust since being resurrected, sadly believing herself to be a monster.
  </p>
  <p key="c76df782-2b0d-4a78-b8fe-18485c99315a">
   Rip and Sara then started to interrogate Blake and offered to let him leave unharmed if he helped them. Blake mentioned that Rip was known to Savage and his followers as "the Gareeb" (the stranger) and had tried to kill Savage once before 4,000 years ago in
   Egypt
   . Sara confronted Rip and he told her that he had tried to kill Savage before but failed as he hesitated, insisting she was not a monster for killing people but him not being able to kill a murderer like Savage when he had the chance made him one. Sara and Rip continued questioning Blake who told them they could find Savage his treasure at a gathering this evening. Rip asked about the most prized treasure of Savage which Blake revealed was actually Carter's body.
  </p>
  <p key="1705e765-bee1-4f4b-b764-a9815f856eec">
   Rip was bound on going to the meeting to retrieve Carter's remains. Sara then insisted they should bring the entire team but as they were all gone or helping Kendra, they were forced to go by themselves. Sara posed as the lover of Blake as they infiltrated the gathering while leaving Black tied up in their trunk. Sara and Rip danced as they checked out their surroundings. Rip mentioned he did not consider her a monster but that she was just a person haunted by a past. He told her that just like him she would get better and her drive to improve herself would allow her to better herself. Sara noticed two men with the same markings as the South African mercenaries from the bank. Sara easily took them both out and they entered the hidden room they had been guarding where they found Carter's body displayed.
  </p>
  <p key="341f4797-2eaf-4aba-b4a8-01a5300aecaa">
   As they wanted to move the body they got cornered by Blake and his men and were quickly overpowered and tied up. Brought before Savage and his followers, he revealed that by using the blood of Khufu and Kendra he could share it with his followers to expanded their lifespan with hundreds of years. Savage questioned Rip's hatred for him and soon realized it stemmed from what he would one day do to his family. As Savage boasted, the rest of the team suddenly burst in and engaged the followers of Savage. While Rip fought Savage, Sara faced Blake again and managed restrain herself from violently killing him. Having reclaimed Carter's body, the team held a funeral for him after which Rip apologized for keeping things from the group and they all vowed to work together as a team.

   The Pentagon

   Firestorm
   accidentally set of the alarms, Sara and Kendra were confronted by security and forced to fight them off. Kendra lost control of her powers and tried to kill the security personnel, but the team managed to retrieve her and busted their way out of the Pentagon. Back at the ship, the team argued about what went wrong and whose fault that was. Rip told them he had managed to wipe the video footage from the Pentagon. From the stolen file, the team learned Savage had gone to the

Rip tasked Sara to talk to her, as she had experience in getting her warrior side under control. Sara was hesitant but agreed to try. She talked to Kendra and invited her for a training match. As they sparred, Sara pushed Kendra too far and she turned into her Hawk form and knocked Sara down. Sara's bloodlust surfaced and she nearly choked Kendra before coming to her senses. Horrified, she ran off.

   Sara was sharpening her knives when Kendra arrived, wanting to train again. Kendra explained that as opposed to herself  who needed to control her warrior side she believed Sara needed to regain control of her human side. Sara expressed her concern of that side of her being gone to which Kendra urged her to find out, baiting her into agreeing to fight by asking if she was scared. The two started sparring again. Sara and Kendra later learned that Ray, Stein, and Mick had been captured while trying to stop Savage's project, which was called
   Operation Svarog

Rip told her that if they could not get Stein back, she would have to kill him. After, Snart had figured out what Rip had asked of her and told her that Rip considered them as expendable pawns, however Sara told him she would do what was necessary to save the future. Snart and Sara infiltrated the prison, however, Snart diverged from the plan, telling her he would save Mick while she could get Stein. Sara managed to take down multiple guards but Stein got moved into the lab out of her reach and Rip told her she would have to kill Stein.

   . While Stein was getting nostalgic, Jefferson and Sara noted the time was less than idyllic for anyone not white, male or straight. While Sara was hesitant about the use of posing as medical personnel, Stein liked his position and ordered her around since he posed as her superior which Sara was less than thrilled by.

   Sara helped a nurse,
   Lindsay Carlisle
   , who was being bothered by a doctor by making him spill his coffee. Sara's interest was peaked when she mentioned not wanting a husband and she asked the nurse to show her around. Sara learned that there were some restricted treatment rooms for certain patients and realized Savage was working as a doctor in the hospital. Later, Sara was caught searching through Savage's office by Lindsay who assumed she was looking for alcohol and offered her a drink. As the two talked, Lindsay was impressed by how well-traveled Sara was and Sara urged her to leave this town and see the world as well. Sara then asked if she had a girlfriend, noting that the nurse was obviously not into guys. As the nurse was a bit uncertain and denied knowing what she was talking about, Sara told her she was good at keeping secrets and tried to comfort her about her sexuality.

   Stein interrupted Sara and told her she should not be seducing young nurses as in this time homosexuality is not accepted and it would only harm her to seduce her. Sara considered it to more like liberating her. Sara talked to the nurse again and the two ended up kissing. Sara got overwhelmed by emotion and left. Sara later spoke with Stein about it and told him that she freaked out when Lindsay kissed her as it was the first time she had let herself experience feelings since her resurrection and it had felt like being kissed for first time which made her realize how much she could hurt someone or get hurt herself.

   The team learned that a meteorite had landed in town similar to the one that gave Savage his powers. As Ray had stolen the dagger, the team prepared to kill Savage. Sara noted that an all-out attack would not work against Savage and they decided Kendra would try to seduce Savage and then kill him with the dagger. As the plan to kill Savage failed, Sara was just in time to save the nurse from the patients injected with Hawk powers. The team managed to save the situation by working together. Sara met with the nurse. They kissed, and the nurse thanked her for helping her. They said goodbye, and Sara told her they might meet again sometime.

   Two years later in 1960, Rip entered Sara's bedroom and told her he had come back for her. However, Sara quickly overpowered him and alerted the guards, who captured him and the rest of the team. Bringing them to Ra's al Ghul, Sara mentioned she had found peace here and as trespassers, they were all to be executed. The team was brought before Ra's al Ghul, who mentioned Sara had chosen the League. As Rip demanded a trial by combat, and when Ra's chose Sara to represent him, Rip chose Kendra to fight Sara, certain she could remind Sara of her humanity like she had done once before. Sara and Kendra dueled each other using swords.

   During the fight, Kendra tried to remind Sara of who she was and knocked her down with a move she learned from the former. Sara managed to disarm Kendra, causing her to turn into her hawk form and fly her up into the air and pin her against the wall. However, Sara managed to stab Kendra's wings, defeating her. As Sara had Kendra at her mercy she pleaded with her one more time, reminding her who she truly was so Sara lowered her weapon. Just then, Nanda Parbat was invaded by Chronos, who fought his way past the assassins. Sara requested Ra's al Ghul to free the team to fight Chronos which he eventually did. Working together, the team managed to overpower Chronos. As they were about to kill him, Snart burst in and revealed Chronos was in fact Mick Rory who had been taken in by the Time Masters.

   Ra's deduced Sara was from the future as she had clearly already undergone the training of the League. Sara explained she had believed the League was the only place where she could truly belong. Ra's al Ghul pointed out her soul was divided between the ability to kill and desire to show mercy, and the League was thus not for her. He then released Sara from the League, giving back her past life. Before leaving, Sara told Ra's to send his daughter to

   Kasnia Conglomerate
   , 20 years before Savage's rise to power. In the potential future of 2080, governments would turn more into corporations and outside the Conglomerate, the world was full of poverty. The team looked around and Rip informed them that over five years a ruthless dictator known as
   Per Degaton
   would rise to power. The team saw robots flying around similar to the Atom suits killed a mugger as he tried to run off. Snart mentioned that executing criminals on the spot did not seem like a lot of progress. The team split up with Sara, Rip, and Snart infiltrating a meeting where Savage would attend.

   Rip attended the meeting but Sara and Snart was forced to wait outside as they posed as his accountant and bodyguard. After the meeting Rip informed the rest of the team that Per Degaton would unleash the
   Armageddon virus
   which would decimate the planets population which would perfectly prime the world for dictatorship which Savage would use as a springboard by then killing Degaton and take control. Rip and Snart mentioned that if they kill Per Degaton, who at this time was just a young boy, now to stop the rise of Savage in the future. The team argued the ethics of killing a child even though he would grow up to be a monster and agreed instead to just abduct Degaton.

   informed them that the abduction had been insufficient in changing the timeline, the team discussed what to do with the kid as killing him now seemed to be the only option though Sara mentioned that Degaton might still be able to change. She later spoke to the captured Rory about the situation and reminded him of his friendship with Snart and how he had spared him. When the team was then unable to find Rip, they realized that he had taken Degaton with him on the jumpship and left to kill him. As they waited, Sara talked to Snart and encouraged him to speak to Rory and sort out the guilt he obviously felt after marooning him.

   The group went to the town and visited the saloon. Sara and Rory talked at the bar where Sara asked about his time as Chronos as she believed it had made quite an impression on him and had changed him. He commented she could handle her liquor and Sara mentioned she had outdrunk any guy that had tried to get her wasted during her college years. Rory challenged her for a drinking game. The team were soon brought into a massive brawl after Stein got into an agreement with a local leading to Snart having to shoot him down. The fight got broken up by
   Jonah Hex
   , an old friend of Rip who knew they were from the future. Back at the ship, Sara talked to Kendra who told her she wanted to talk to a woman she had met in town and had given her flashes of her past lives. Sara wanted to accompany her and the two talked as they traveled by horseback. Sara mentioned she enjoyed the nature in this time as it was so pure and simple.

   They tracked the woman to her home where Kendra soon realized this was a former incarnation of her having grown old. The woman later told Kendra to stop fighting destiny as they could not avoid getting born, meeting Carter, and end up murdered by Savage. She explained that after Carter had been killed she had tried a relationship with another man but it failed as Carter was her soulmate and the same would happen to Kendra's relationships. Back at the ship, Sara comforted Kendra and told her that things might have gone wrong for her former incarnation but Kendra should live for herself and decide for herself if she wanted a future with Ray.

   They joined the group as Rip was about to duel the leader of the Steelwater gang. Rip beat him on the draw and killed him with a single shot to the chest. After the death of the leader, the gang fled. However, at that moment the hunters sent by the Time Masters showed up and attacked them with their modern weaponry. A massive fight erupted which resulted in the team killing all the hunters.

   After their victory, the team talked about their next destination. However, Rip and Rory told them that the Time Masters had activated an order which resulted in a certain agent called
   The Pilgrim
   would kill them. Snart mentioned they could take her out, however, Rory told him that the Pilgrim would not come after them but would try to kill their younger selves in order to erase them from the timeline.
   Gideon
   predicted The Pilgrim would target a young Mick Rory in 1990 and the team manage to save him just in time. They brought the young Rory on the ship and made up a story that they worked for the secret agency

Sara was able to throw the Pilgrim to the floor despite the latter's powers, with the Pilgrim recovering her lost firearm. However, Mick was able to blast the Pilgrim before she could shoot Sara. Older Sara put younger Sara in the cargo with younger Rory. As the team discussed how to deal with The Pilgrim, Sara noticed younger Sara and Rory fighting and broke it up. She told younger Sara that she should trust her as she tried to keep her safe.

   The team was barely able to save Ray as The Pilgrim tried to kill him in 2014. They then discussed that their best option was to keep themselves safe was to abduct themselves as babies. Rip mentioned that the risk was that if they did not bring their younger selves back in time, their timeline would be damaged beyond repair. Sara and Kendra worked together and abducted baby Snart in 1972, while they both were amazed at how cute baby Snart was. Rip brought the team and their younger selves to
   The Refuge
   for their younger selves to be cares for by his
   adopted mother
   . The team was doubtful but Rip explained that this place was a refuge, hidden in an unknown part of history where the Time Masters would not be able to find them. Rip explained that the Time Masters fill their ranks with orphans and that his mother would be able to take care of the children.

   The team got contacted by The Pilgrim, who demanded that they surrendered themselves to her or she would kill their loved ones, including Quintin from 2007 whom she had kidnapped. Rip countered her offer by offering his younger self so that if she killed him the team would never exist in the first place. The team went to an outpost to make the trade. The adopted mom brought the younger self of Rip to him. The Pilgrim showed up and told her she would kill as many people as needed to complete her mission. During the trade, the team attacked her. However, The Pilgrim was able to stop all of their energy attacks with her hands and freeze them all in time. But the younger Rip stabbed her which distracted her and she got reduced to dust by the combined energy attacks of the team.

   Oculus
   to seeing the future and that every action of the team so far had played exactly what the Time masters wanted them to do. All their attempts at killing Savage and the death of Rip's family had all been part of the plan. He also mentioned that he watched in the Oculus and saw Ray getting killed. The team talked about what to do now and mentioned that each action could get anticipated by the Time masters. The team decided that their best move might be to try to destroy the Oculus and destroy the ability of the Time masters to manipulate them. Rip agreed and told them they would try to get their destinies back.

   Snart came to Sara's quarters and apologized for pointing a gun at her but she told him he was a jerk. He asked her what she thought of the plan of Rip but she mentioned it all seemed pre-determined already. Snart told her he always considered himself like a guy that did not play by the rules, but each of his steps had been manipulated by the Time Masters. Sara told him she felt responsible for all the things she had done. Snart mentioned it were the things he had not done that kept him awake at night. He flirted with Sara and asked about their future together. Sara coldly replied that he had to be a really good thief to be able to steal a kiss from her.

The team refused to let him go alone, but Rip revealed he deceived them with a hologram and was already on the ship. Rip flew away and the team was left behind. Sara went to the Arrowcave and reunited with her father. Quentin explained that the rest of Team Arrow was working to take down

She blamed Rip for bringing her back too late, which caused Laurel's death, and demanded that he take her back in time so she could save her sister. As the team tried to calm her down, Rip stunned Sara and had Mick take her to her quarters to sleep it off.

   Later, Rip talked to Sara who pleaded with him to help her save Laurel but revealed that by taking her with him on his mission, he had actually saved her; if she had been present with the confrontation against Damien Darhk, then Sara and their father would been as well but Laurel's death was inevitable. Sara was devastated, feeling she could not do this without her sister. Rip comforted Sara, stating she was one of the strongest persons he knew and that Kendra and Carter could still be saved.

   Through a clue left by Kendra from back in time, the team was able to track Savage to
   France

   Nazi
   soldiers. Jax managed to free Kendra and Carter but as they escaped, Kendra was shot and captured by Savage's soldiers. Outnumbered, Rip ordered the team to retreat as they would try to save Kendra later. At the ship,
   Scythian Torvil
   , the reincarnation of Carter Hall revealed that Savage was collecting three meteorites, which contained technology from the
   Thanagarians

  <p key="cbabbe4b-561f-4761-9531-2acae377b2d7">
   Stein figured out that Savage wanted to explode the meteorites in three different time periods in which the Earth was aligned with
   Thanagar
   . Due to his immortality as well as time travel, Savage contacted himself in the other times, then traveled to 2021 to cause the explosions at the same moment in all the three time periods. Stein explained to the team that the meteorites had given him immortality but his exposure to them would also render him practically mortal. Thus, they could split up in three teams and kill all three versions of Savage at once: Ray and Rory in 1958, Sara, Stein, and Jefferson in 1975 and Rip, Kendra, and Scythian in 2021.

   Sara, Stein, and Jefferson watched themselves as they fought at the auction and Stein and Jefferson flew away with the armed nuclear bomb and absorb the explosion. As Savage activated the meteorite Jefferson, Stein and Sara revealed themselves. Savage tried to shoot at Sara with a rocket launcher, but Jefferson and Stein blocked the shot. Sara blocked Savage's throwing knives and engaged him in close combat. Using her staff against the knife-wielding Savage, Sara managed to gain the upper hand. After disarming him, Sara killed Savage by snapping his neck with her staff. The meteorite was about to explode, but Jefferson and Stein managed to use their newfound transmutation power and changed the meteorite into water.

During the fight Sara saved Vixen and Rory showed up wearing a Ninja suit, exclaiming that Ninjas did exist. Sara ended up fighting the right-hand man again, this time armed with a sword as well as a knife and was able to kill him in a single stroke. The other Legends managed to defeat the Shogun but blew up the Atom suit in the process before they all headed back to the ship.

   The Legends received a distress signal from a time pirate who had been stranded in
   Mississippi
   1863. Realizing him or his technology could cause massive changes to the timeline, Sara ordered the team on a mission with the objective to secure the target and destroy the ship. After finding the ship Rory set it on fire and destroyed it. As the team wanted to leave, they saw an Afro-American man getting chased by Southern soldiers and Vixen wanted to interfere. Sara ordered Stein and Jax to take out the soldiers. The man introduced himself as
   Henry Scott
   , a former slave who was now providing information for the Union army. The Southern soldiers rose back up like
   zombies
   and charged the Legends.

   A massive fight ensued in which the Legends managed to kill the zombies but Henry Scott ended up fatally wounded. With his last words he gave them his message to deliver to the Union troops. Back at the ship the team informed Ray about the zombies and learned that this originated from a
   bio weapon
   from the ship of the pirate. The team then learned that Rory had been bitten during the fight and was now infected. Sara and the team learned that following the death of Henry Scott who was supposed to deliver vital information that would help the Union army to tip the war in their favor, the timeline had changed and the Union army had surrendered against the South. Sara agreed to let Jax go in his place, taking Amaya with him, while Sara and Nate would go to warn the Union army about the infected soldiers.

   Nate told Sara that since gender equality was still hundreds of years away it would be best if he took the lead. Just then they got ambushed by Union soldiers and were brought before
   General Grant

Nate tried to tell him he was a colonel which he didn't buy so Sara quickly took over and attempted to tell him of the horde of zombies preparing to attack the Union army. However, the General was skeptical so Sara left to show him, finding a group of zombies outside the camp and brought the still growling head of one of them to the General who was convinced of the threat. As the camp got attacked, Sara advised the General while the soldiers kept the zombies at bay. She tried to get help from Stein and Ray but they were busy with Rory who had turned into a zombie.

   Nate, General Grant, and Sara tried to come up with a plan as the ammunition was running low and the zombies would overrun their defenses. Sara noticed a large amount of nitroglycerin and came up with a plan. Sara ordered the soldiers to cover the lights and Nate used a torch to lure the horde of zombies towards the nitroglycerin. Turning into his metal form Nate ignited the explosives and killed all the zombies in the explosion. The Legends reunited and Jax gave General Grant the information that would help him win the war, telling him his name was Henry Scott to restore history. Sara spoke with General Grant who had been told by Nate that she had some trouble putting her people in harm's way. He gave her some advice and advised her that if she believed in her crew and their mission, she shouldn't regret making tough decisions.

   White House
   in 1987, one day before the signing of the INF treaty was signed which would end the cold war. Sara, Rory, Stein and Jax infiltrated the White House. As they realized Damien Darhk was there as the President's advisor, Sara shut off her com wanting to assassinate him. As she pulled out a knife she got caught by a secret service agent who wanted to detain her. Rory knocked the agent out and Ray tried to persuade her that this would be unwise. As more secret service agents showed up, Ray and Rory engaged them in a firefight. The team was forced to retreat and went back to the ship.

   Back at the ship, the team deduced that Darhk must be working with the other time traveller that had been changing history. Stein and Jax criticized Sara for trying to kill Darhk which would have massive changes in history. Stain told her to stay focused on the mission but Sara insisted her sister had done everything for her so she needed to do the same in turn. As they tracked down Darhk, Sara sent Mick and Ray to intercept his meeting, opting to stay back herself to avoid clashing with Darhk. They found him meeting with a Russian in the park, plotting a plan to blow up the treaty. A young Stein stumbled into their meeting and realized Damien was conspiring with the Russian KGB agent. Darhk stabbed the young Stein, causing the older version to collapse as well. The team put both Stein's under treatment from Gideon who restored their injuries.

   Darhk shot at Vixen forcing Todd to shield her and ending up injured while doing so. Sara disarmed Darhk with a shuriken and confronted him. He recognized her from New York 1942 and noted she had not aged, questioning if it was because of the Lazarus Pit. A fascinated Darhk wondered how she could be so angry since he could not remember having done anything to her. Sara told him she would spare killing him, instead tormenting him by revealing she was from the future and knew all his schemes about
   the Ark

   operation Genesis

They brought Hex aboard the ship and informed him that Rip was missing and Sara was now acting captain, which Hex questioned as she was a woman. Nate informed them that history had been disrupted as Hex's nemesis
   Quentin Turnbull

Having him at her mercy, Malcolm offered to give her the location of the real Stein if she would not kill him. Accepting his offer Sara learned the location and appeared just in time to save Stein, taking out Capone and his goons. At the ship, Sara told Stein that some things were more important than the timeline, telling him they were a family and she would always protect her family, including his daughter.

Gideon told them Rip had retrieved a piece of wood before his disappearance and the team realized this could be a piece of the spear.

While Nate, Ray and Amaya went to try to convince Lucas to stay in film school, Sara talked to Rip who told her she sounded just like a character from his screenplay. Jax then mentioned how the screenplay seemed to be based on their lives and gave hints of where the spear could be. Meanwhile, Darhk and Merlyn had tracked the spear to George Lucas and captured him along with Nate, Ray and Amaya, forcing them to search for the spear at the garbage dump after Lucas threw it away.

They infiltrated the Christmas party Washington was attending where Redcoats wielding modern weaponry suddenly attacked. While Sara and Mick escorted Washington out of the house an EMP like blast shot down all their weapons, including Gideon and Ray's suit. They were confronted by Rip Hunter who shot Sara in the stomach and captured Rory and Washington while leaving her to die as she fell to the ground and began to bleed out.

Sara eventually caught the spear and fought evenly with Malcolm. During the fight, Sara dropped the spear causing Mick to catch it. Leonard tried to convince him to give over the spear but realizing he was treating him like his underling, Rory threw the spear to Amaya. As Amaya tried to use the spear to fix reality, Leonard froze her with his cold gun and smashed her body to pieces, much to the team's devastation.

Sara changed her mind and the Legends brought Caesar back to the place where he had gone missing after erasing his mind. Back at the ship they found at the timeline had drastically changed as Caesar had now conquered the entire world. Nate realized Caesar had stolen his history book and had used it to his advantage to rule the world. Rip, Ava Sharpe and several agents entered the ship and told them they would fix it.

After detecting an anachronism, she and the other Legends discovered that Jax and Stein had accidentally switched bodies. Sara then explained to the team that a time displaced woman has caused

Before Sara and Zari could attack, he used his magic to stop them and disarmed Sara only to reveal that he was there to parlay. He and Sara talked, where he told her to stop fixing the anachronisms and return to 2017 or he would kill every member of her team leaving her for last. A fight between Mick, Nate and Ray began due to the allure of Helen that lead to the team going back to the

Ava, however, told the Vikings that she's "not a husband type", piquing Sara's interest. Before anything else could happen, Freydis brought out Mick who got caught trying to steal Beebo's offering of booze, and demanded for Mick to be executed on a pyre as a sacrifice to Beebo. During the execution, Sara ordered Leo to use his
   cold gun
   to douse the flames, which Ava then tried to play out as "Beebo's mercy" to distract the Vikings.

Rip apologized for his mistakes and the Legends agreed to work with him and Wally. Sara ordered the Legends to track down Ray but when all their leads came up empty, Sara spent her time throwing knives at pictures of Darhk when Ava came in. The two discussed their efforts of finding Ray and then shared a kiss which was witnessed by Rip.

   Grodd
   suddenly appeared and killed him, making Ava Sharpe the highest official at the Bureau and thus the new director. Later, Sara complimented Wally on his contributions during the mission and asked if he wanted to stick around but he mentioned he did not feel at ease there, as he had made a wrong first impression. Sara explained that they all had made multiple mistakes and were known for making the wrong impressions which made him a perfect fit.

   The team discovered a change to the timeline when several things in their life changed or disappeared, including Nate's hair and the name of Rory's rat
   Axl
   . They realized a timeline change in Memphis, Tennessee 1954 involving
   Elvis Presley
   had  occurred causing rock to never hit mainstream. They tracked Elvis' location to a local church where Elvis's father was preaching. There, they witnessed Elvis play but Zari's totem started reacting to his guitar, making her float and forcing the Legends flee. Zari informed them that the guitar had glowed like her totem, meaning Elvis had the sixth totem. Wally used his super speed to quickly retrieve the guitar but to ensure the anachronism was fixed, Amaya and Nate went to deliver a new guitar to Elvis. Meanwhile, when Sara and Ray tried to extract the totem from the guitar, the guitar started floating and a ghost appeared and attacked them and fled with the guitar. Nate informed Sara that the guitar was possessed by Elvis' deceased twin brother,
   Jesse
   and Sara managed to calm him by mentioning they knew Elvis.

   Sara learned from Constantine that it was the

Nate mentioned that Elvis needed it to keep his connection with Jesse intact and make his breakthrough and Sara reluctantly allowed Nate to return the guitar temporarily. Meanwhile, Ray forced Sara and Mick to attend as he performed a memorial for the rat Axl which Sara only agreed to so she could drink. Sara then held a half-hearted speech. They heard Elvis on the radio which, due to being performed with the death totem, began raising the dead including the ghost of Axl. Elvis accepted the loss of his brother and managed to give the ghosts peace. Back at the ship Nate's haircut was back as history was restored. Ray revealed that he had made boxes to store the totems so they could not cause harm.

She opened the box and was confronted by a version of herself as The Canary after she died. The version of herself told her to take the totem as it would allow her to defeat Mallus and bring her sister back to life. Sara eventually took the totem and was taken over by Mallus.

Nora again tried to tempt her to join them but Sara could hear Ava talking to her and felt Ava putting her hand on her heart. Sara declined Nora's offer of a life without pain and regret and said that she would not be a demon's lackey and bring more death into the world. She then woke up and recovered. After, she talked to Constantine, offering him a place on the ship. Constantine told her he preferred this path alone but that she was not alone and that she should be grateful for having Ava. Sara told the Legends she was sorry and that Mallus had tried to recruit her using her deepest fears. Sara spoke with Ava and told her that the dark version was actually her and that there is a dark side in her and deep down she is death. Sara told Ava she was wonderful and that she did not deserve anyone like Ava. Sara broke up with Ava as she did not want to hurt her.

Ava told her that she was prioritizing the mission but Sara replied that she was just denying her own personal problems and urged her to talk to Rip. Sara soon walked off and spoke to Barack Obama in 1979 and explained everything that had happened to her. Obama told her that her response to the situation is human and that Ava was sticking to rules and regulations but he thought the Legends were better equipped to handle this than the Bureau. Sara thanked him before wiping his memory again. Sara then talked to Darhk and told him she did not believe him and did not trust him, however, she was willing to work with him and after that she would kill him. Darhk agreed to these terms.

   Sara spoke to Darhk and she asked where his heart was when he killed Laurel. Darhk explained that his actions were unforgivable but before he had Nora, he never understood of the pain he caused. Sara said that they could not make their deeds undone. Darhk told her that even the worst could become whole again and complimented her on how she had turned from an assassin to a Legend. Sara told him it was not enough but Darhk told her that she should stop blaming herself for having been taken over by the Death totem because she had resisted its power because of love. The team looked for loopholes to save Amaya's village but realized there were none. Sara suggested they should allow Mallus escape and then kill him. The team were skeptical but Darhk suggested he could also wield the death totem as it was drawn to him as it was Sara as he had also been brought back from the dead. Sara surprised everyone by giving Darhk the totem. Ava was against it and walked away. Sara tried to persuade Ava but she said that since she was a clone she had a hard time trusting her feelings.

Rory comforted her that he would kill her if she got possessed again and she agreed to put it on, this time with no side effects. The team tried to create the warrior but because of their doubt or failure to be in sync, they created a failure. Ava showed up with
   Helen of Troy

   When Sara returned, she saw Ava had hung her medals up on the wall. Sara confessed to Ava that she had released monsters into the world and was afraid to tell her because Ava was so proud of her. Ava told her she already knew about this from Gary and Sara was confused why she wasn't mad. Ava told Sara that she thought she was amazing and that she loved her no matter what. Sara told her that right now she should wait with moving in together as her team needed her right now. However, she agreed with Ava that they should let their relationship evolve. Sara later visited Constantine and tried to convince him to join the Legends. However, he refused. Before leaving, Sara noted Constantine was more pessimistic than usual and something must have happened to him.

Later, Sara realized Zari had secretly left the ship and went to find her. She found Zari, having gotten herself captured and accused of being a witch, tied up with Jane to be burnt. Sara stopped it and engaged the villagers in a fight but was eventually held back by multiple men. However, just as Jane and Zari were about to be burned, Prudence arrived and had her Fairy Godmother release them. Zari managed to convince Prudence to not extract revenge on the town and she released her Godmother, allowing Constantine to banish her to Hell.

Charlie explained that it couldn't be stopped until the story he had drawn in the book had played out which ended with the city being destroyed. He tried to draw a better ending but the book would not let him, as Charlie explained, because he could not draw a happy ending as he had not lived a happy life.

   Sara volunteered to accompany Lois, saying she knew the terrain. Before leaving, she talked to

   On Earth-16, the trio arrived at the former
   Green Arrow base

   Earth-16 Oliver
   revealed himself. Although he tried to talk to the man, Oliver kept attacking her repeatedly until he realized that this was Sara. When asked how she was alive, Sara responded by saying that this was a "long story", and Lois, carrying her son, thanked Oliver for saving her son. When Oliver said he blamed himself for taking
   her doppelganger
   to
   Gambit

Suddenly, the two women were confronted by the

   shadow demons
   that appeared to stop them. When asked if it was "common to save the world", Sara said that she and her team "generally mess things up for the better". After the arduous confrontation, the shadow demons disappeared and the Paragons noticed a light being emitted towards the sky. They realized that Oliver had lit the spark, and now they should spread the flame. They came to the conclusion of using the last page of the Book of Destiny to "spread the flame", focusing on "Humanity, Truth, Love, Destiny, Honor, Courage and Hope".

Barely able to speak, Oliver made them promise to take care of their family. When congratulating them for having succeeded, Sara and Barry looked up and saw a new universe being created. Sara tried to get her friend to stay with him, even though he is ready to go. Weak, Oliver said "the end is a beginning" and told Barry to remember what he had said to him, "dying is the easy part". He revealed to his companions that he was at peace, saying that "the true heroes are the ones who must continue to live", and begged them to continue saving the world and being the heroes they are, and never to stop. In his last breath, Oliver said that the new world will need both. After that, Sara and Barry cried over the corpse of their former companion. They looked up and saw the universe still being created, and both embraced when a flash of light covered them.

   Bishop told Sara his plan of merging human and alien DNA to create the perfect human and that with her resilience, unlike Amelia Earhart, she is the perfect blue-print for his new human race. He told her he plans to create millions of alien-Sara hybrid clones and together conquer the galaxy. Sara was repulsed by this and goes to reclaim

   Sara fought them off but was stopped by Gary, Nurse Ava and Mick who explained they were there to save her and that the AVAs were now on her side. Mick urged them to leave but Sara insisted that she needed to stop Bishop first. Nurse Ava told her that they needed to take down all his generators at the same time to prevent a back-up from kicking in. In the process of preparing a generator for destruction, Sara cut herself and noticed the wound immediately healing. Realizing Bishop had tampered with her DNA, she went to confront him and he revealed that he merged her DNA with that of an alien. She apprehended him, refraining from killing him in order to prevent him from generating a new body and reclaimed her ring.

   Not wanting to be stuck in an alien body, Sara had Nurse Ava make another clone of her that was strictly human to go home with the others. However, while in the process of printing the clone, Mick barged in and killed Bishop who started to digitally upload his consciousness to the cloud which would enable him to print a copy of himself from anywhere in the universe. Nurse Ava noted that the only way to stop him was to destroy the generators but Sara wanted to wait for her clone to be printed. With barely no time left until Bishop's upload would be complete, Mick told her to blow it up but Sara explained the situation to him, although Mick encouraged her and they left, blowing the place up.

   Sara and the Legends arrived in an unknown period with the time machine. Everyone started panicking, so Nate gave everyone orders. Sara and Ava were stressed out, so Nate offered Astra and Spooner to help them by distracting them. Sara and Spooner went to the wilderness by shooting squirrels, later bringing them as food to the others. When Ava and Sara finally relaxed, they noticed something between Gideon and Gary. Later the Legends heard a vehicle coming, but it was Tomaz, Behrad, and Gwyn. They told the Legends of the timeline changes that happened and that they were on Chernobyl. Like the time machine was fixed, the Legends successfully time traveled.

Once back, they announced where they could get the needed pieces and celebrated Tomaz and Nate's moving-in-together announcement. Astra, Sara, Ava, Spooner, and Gideon arrived at the manufacture. When Astra and Spooner got discriminated against by E. Staples, Sara told them it was okay if they wanted to quit the mission.

After helping the Rosies build the Airplane, they celebrated. Since the Legends accidentally changed the timeline, "

During her crusade to take down men who attacked women, Sara restrained from killing the perpetrators in an attempt to atone.

After saving a child from a burning building, Sara found comfort in that she was praised as a hero. Despite rejoining the League, Sara embodied a more hopeful nature, vowing not to get lost in the darkness again.

By her own admission, Sara doesn't see herself as the type to settle down and have a normal relationship with someone. However, while she is capable of doing so, Sara often allows her personal feelings of self-loathing due to her difficult past cause her to believe that she does not deserve to be with the person she is with, causing her to abruptly end her said relationship with them, as seen with Oliver and Ava. However, as Sara continues to work on moving on, she began slowly taking positive steps forward in her personal life when dating Ava. Even after discovering Ava was a genetically-engineered clone, Sara ultimately did not allow this to influence her feelings for Ava, allowing the couple to reconcile.

     what to do in order to try and escape
     Pliny X19
     as well as creating a plan in order to mislead
     Bishop
     and try to escape his clutches by herself.
    </p>
    <p key="1ee3885b-d693-43ad-a1dc-954f1fb2c9d1">
     Sara is also still a sentimental and scarred person. A lot of bad things have happened to her, but she doesn't forget these things. She learns from them, remembering these lessons for the rest of her life, taking pride in those lessons and her experiences.
    </p>
    <p key="57c38c48-fd5a-4835-9b1c-6b1376996c49">
     Despite this, however, retaining the entirety of her original self's memories, experiences, and emotions while also learning of her new existence as a clone originally jarred and shocked Sara, who while was excepting of clones and viewed them as people with souls, could not initially except the alien DNA that was placed inside of her. Fearing what she could become, and not wanting to be stuck in an alien body, Sara tried to make another clone of herself that was strictly human to go home with the others. However, despite her failure with this, it was ultimately Mick Rory who encouraged her to embrace the new body, stating that she was still Sara no matter what, causing her to fully except her new status and to come to terms with no longer being fully human.
    </p>
    <p key="4cad6696-a6ca-4f9f-a5a9-e162d24829e0">
     This realization alongside her new abilities has slightly changed her outlook, with Sara now being open to taking more risks than before, now thinking of herself as invincible. This attitude quickly changed when she saw how worried she was making her fiancé and her teammates, and how reckless she was being, realizing that despite her changes, she was not actually invincible and that she shouldn’t let her new abilities make herself reckless. After this, Sara began showing a little more restraint and became more accommodating to Ava and the others, while still being true to herself and her fun and adventurous personality.
    </p>
    Becoming half alien has in no way dulled her skills, her instincts, or her judgement, as when Bishop returned she immediately did not trust him, and was careful in watching what he said and did while abord the waverider, keeping him detained and separated from her team for a majority of the time, and then having him watched to make sure to be ready for whatever he may be planning, despite Ava becoming more and more skeptical about her precautions. Her judgement turned out to be correct as Bishop was indeed planning on an escape and was only behaving to learn more about the legends themselves and their weaknesses.

     The Canary suit
     :
    </b>
    Sara wore a black leather suit, the pants being reminiscent of fishnet stockings, when she fought crime as her former vigilante alter-ego, the Canary. Along with this, she wore a mask to hide her identity from enemies (and also from friends and family, at first). Sara wore the Canary suit a couple more times after having her soul returned to her until joining the Legends, for which Laurel gave her the White Canary suit.

     Sonic device
     :
    </b>
    As the Canary, Sara used a handheld non-lethal sonic weapon to incapacitate large groups of people. The device overwhelmed the hearing of everyone in its immediate vicinity, and was also capable of shattering glass. It can also be use as an improvised explosion device; when the light on the device switches from light blue to light red, the device immediately detonates for the purpose of distraction or escape. After Sara's death, Laurel had Cisco modify the device into the
    Canary Cry
