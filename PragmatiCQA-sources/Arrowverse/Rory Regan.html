   is a

   Team Arrow
   , using the mystical
   rags of Devarim

   his magic

   . After absorbing a nuclear explosion, the rags seemed to stop working, causing Rory to leave the team until he can restore his bond with the rags. Retiring from vigilantism, he turned towards helping the disenfranchised in other ways, before being hunted by the mask-hunter
   Chimera
   , leaving his ultimate fate unknown.

   Rory Regan was born and raised in the town of
   Havenrock
   to a
   Jewish
   family and became a skilled inventor in his youth. By age 11, Rory's
   father
   started giving him the family's homebrew schnapps, despite him being well under the drinking age. Rory's family owned possession of ancient mystical
   rags from the time of Devarim
   , granting its user the ability to extend them like limbs.

   In early 2016, on

   wrapped him in the rags, telling him they held a power greater than most people could imagine, but needed to respect the power it brought. Moments after, Havenrock was destroyed by the missile. Rory's family, along with the town's entire populace, was killed, but he was protected from the blast wave by the rags. In the aftermath, Rory was left the sole survivor of the city.

After deliberating in the hideout, the team decided to interrogate one of the street criminals, thanks to which they could predict the next location of the Spooky Crew attack. They were interrupted by the new vigilante, who intended to kill criminals. Seeing the threat in the warrior, the heroes decided to pretend to be criminals and attract the man's attention, but he understood their plan and stunned Artemis sitting in the car in front of the building, then beat Curtis and took him with him. At the bank, he demanded a meeting with Green Arrow, threatening Holt to kill him. When the Vigilante was about to make a fatal shot, the archer stopped him and captured him, but thanks to a controlled blast he escaped.

She insisted on flying the bomb to a less populated place, but was cut off when Rory mentioned Havenrock. In that instant, he came up with the idea that if the rags could help him survive Havenrock's nuclear explosion, he could also survive the bomb, containing the explosion and radiation. Felicity questioned its effectiveness, but he had faith in his rags, sending Felicity away and sacrificing himself. He survived, wrapping his rags to the maximum around the bomb, and everyone right outside the warehouse also survived. However, the explosion was too much on the rags, so that they seemed to have lost their powers. Rory decided to leave Team Arrow to find a way to fix the issue. He bid farewell to Felicity when she visited him, promising to return.
