   Spared, Barry and Joe come back to STAR Labs. Cisco assumes fault for misleading the Flash and permitting him to get stung, which causes Barry to contemplate Joe's prior words about Cisco.

   At the Central City Police Department, Cisco visits Joe. He asks Joe what's going on with Barry, saying that Barry hasn't been himself recently.

Harrison goes to see Dr. Tina McGee at Mercury Labs and gets some information about the two casualties and mechanical honey bees. Tina makes sense of that killer must be Brie Larvan, an old Mercury representative who imagined the honey bees before Tina terminated her for abusing them. Joe then says that Tina will be her next objective, and requests that her be protected. Tina rejects the offer.

   Back at the eatery, Felicity advises Barry to confide in Cisco and Caitlin, in spite of his aversion. Barry appears to accept her recommendation. Barry gets back to discover Iris. She asks Barry what Eddie could be avoiding her. Barry says that Eddie is most likely simply managing a monstrous case, and would prefer not talk about his dull work.

Yet, by perusing the honey bee's inward mandate, Harrison discovers that Brie's bee hive are making a beeline for Mercury Labs to murder Tina. Beam and Cisco name Brie the Bug-Eyed Bandit. Beam offers to spare Tina, since his defensive layer will shield him from the honey bee's stings. Barry will seek after the Bug Eyed Bandit at her remote area.

At the point when The Flash goes up against Brie, she gathers another bee hive. Flash runs from the multitude, yet they seek after him stubbornly. Fortunately, Felicity captures the honey bees' radio recurrence with her great hacking abilities, and closes them down.

   Be that as it may, it's not finished at this point. One of the honey bees, despite everything connected to the Atoms' suit, stings Cisco. Cisco goes into stun, however The Flash races over. He restarts Cisco's heart utilizing the super-vibrations of his hands. The following day, Tina McGee visits Barry to apologize for not taking the CCPD's security. Barry utilizes the chance to inquire as to why her and Harrison's relationship soured. She clarifies how after Harrison's adoration kicked the bucket, he "turned into an alternate individual" (not realizing that Eobard Thawne had his spot). Joe enters, and says that he now thinks Cisco is blameless.

   Barry bids farewell to Felicity and Ray, who head back to Starling City. Iris visits Eddie at his office once more, and says that Barry has vouched for Eddie's ongoing separation.

   At STAR Labs, Cisco and Caitlin meet Barry and Joe at Barry's office. Barry has something to let them know. He gives them access on his mystery examination, and says that Reverse Flash and Harrison Wells are a similar man. Caitlin isn't persuaded, yet Cisco says that he's accomplished "dreams" where Harrison Wells is the Reverse Flash, and slaughters him. That appears to have altered her perspective. With the whole posse ready, the last examination concerning the Reverse Flash starts.
