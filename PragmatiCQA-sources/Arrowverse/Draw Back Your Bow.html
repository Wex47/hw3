The two break into the apartment and find it romantically decorated, with the walls covered with sketches and news articles about The Arrow. As they investigate, a woman is watching them from another building. On a huge shrine there are several pictures of the Arrow, his arrows, and another spade like arrow. Oliver realizes the arrow point is actually a heart. They hear a ringtone and answer the cell phone laying on the table. The woman is excited that she sees Oliver again and asks if he has gotten her a present, referring to the slain Isaac Stazler. She tells him of her desire to be with him and fight and kill with him together. She then sends him a picture of a mob boss with a bomb vest. Oliver mentions he will find her. She taunts him and says that is the idea after which she leaves.
