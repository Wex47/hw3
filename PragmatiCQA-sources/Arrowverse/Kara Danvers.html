   Kara Zor-El was born in 1966 on the planet
   Krypton
   into the prestigious
   House of El
   . Her parents were scientist
   Zor-El
   and judicator (judge)
   Alura Zor-El
   . In Kara's house, she had a room that overlooked the city.
   As a child, Kara often went on vacation with her parents to different planets,
   such as
   Starhaven
   and
   Sedenach
   .
   She and her father also once visited the
   Well of Stars
   .
   When Kara was eight years old, she made her father a statue of a winged creature as a present, but was frustrated over not perfecting the wings' shape. Zor-El assured Kara that the statue was perfect and he loved it, as well as her, much to her joy.
  </p>
  <p key="dc9db080-469c-4700-8d49-eb88b7418cb9">
   Growing up, Kara idolized her mother, sharing Alura's passion for justice and wanting to follow her footsteps in civil service. She was also close to her aunt
   Astra
   , who would teach Kara the constellations at night while stargazing.
  </p>
  <p key="a9a5ada5-1b48-4a2b-8c76-234e8c454fd1">
   One night, Kara stayed up late to see her mother when she got home. Questioning her mother as to why she had come home so late, Kara was told by Alura that a
   Hellgrammite
   had been brought before the citadel. When Kara mentioned that she wanted to help people like Alura did one day, her mother assured her she would, as she had the heart of a hero. After Alura left and told her to get some rest, Kara researched
   Hellgrammites
   .
  </p>
  <p key="c3468776-6065-439f-9f34-92b00f6f1fb0">
   Kara was given a
   spy beacon
   by Astra, which could be used to call her. When Astra disappeared, Kara messaged her and Astra arrived, warning her that Krypton is dying. Unbeknownst to Kara, it was part of Alura's plan to lure
   Astra
   out of hiding and arrest her for her crimes.

  <p key="3737743b-ecd9-47eb-8e3c-fef126edc19e">
   When Kara was 13 years old, Krypton was on the verge of destruction, with its core about to detonate. The House of El devised a plan to send its youngest members to the planet
   Earth
   to save their lives. Kara was charged with raising and protecting her baby cousin,
   <a href="Clark Kent.html" key="03df2a6b-8de8-4e87-9b0b-a6f05ef20ab6" title="Clark Kent">
    Kal-El
   </a>
   . Before she left, Alura revealed that due to Earth's yellow sun, Kara would gain extraordinary powers and go on to do amazing things. Promising that she wouldn't fail them or Kal-El, Kara tearfully bid her parents goodbye before boarding
   her pod
   . However, when Krypton exploded, Kara's pod was knocked off-course by a shockwave and sent into the
   Phantom Zone
   , a region where time does not pass.
   She was awake for at least part of this time, as Kara remembered feeling trapped and alone inside her pod.
  </p>
  <p key="c8f1967f-43ce-4263-84ac-982c6954cf8b">
   Kara slept in the Phantom Zone for 24 years until her pod reactivated. Upon awakening, she noticed a computer console in her dashboard light up with a
   logo of three dots
   in a triangular shape. Her pod then left the Phantom Zone.

  <p key="6f8b814a-3aeb-4d17-9379-931ca02bef47">
   Kara's pod finally landed on Earth in 2003. Since she didn't age during her time in the Phantom Zone, Kara still appeared to be a 13-year-old girl. She was found by her cousin Kal-El, who had arrived two dozen years prior and grown up to become Superman. Kal-El, wanting Kara to have a safe human childhood like he had, took her to live with
   Jeremiah
   and
   Eliza Danvers
   , a pair of scientists who once helped him understand his own powers.
  </p>
  <p key="a4fb8c14-f513-4bf8-96f6-0025aafde3ee">
   As she adapted to her new home, Kara had frequent panic attacks and was horribly claustrophobic from being stuck in her pod for so many years.
   Shortly after arriving on Earth, Kara found and befriended a stray cat living on her street, whom she named
   Streaky
   after an undisclosed, yet notable encounter.
   Scared that she would hurt Streaky if she touched him, Kara practiced controlling her strength and being gentle. When she finally petted Streaky, the cat purred, which was one of the first times Kara felt human.
  </p>
  <p key="8a57555d-d0b6-4722-b41c-5a7a14e1b96c">
   Kara was enrolled at
   Midvale Junior High School
   along with Jeremiah and Eliza's daughter,
   Alex Danvers
   . Kara was overwhelmed by the new environment as well as her developing powers. After school, they went to
   Swan Beach
   and Kara embarrassed Alex by staring at the birds as they did not have them on
   Krypton
   . When a car crashed nearby, Kara ran at super-speed to the rescue, saving a mother and her child with her super-strength. However, Alex was injured by a car door when the vehicle exploded. After this incident, Jeremiah and Kara decided that it was best for the latter to hide her powers. Jeremiah gave Kara a pair of
   lead-lined glasses
   she could wear to suppress her vision.
  </p>
  <p key="3d9347db-e829-4b03-8aef-5d9e7d0743cf">
   Kara was taken swimming by Eliza on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
   At some point, she was introduced to the musical
   <i key="28e238e5-3eb3-466e-8799-b4c10d85c25f">
    The Wizard of Oz
   </i>
   by her adoptive mother. Kara quickly fell in love with the film, watching it frequently with Jeremiah and Eliza.
   Kara had also seen the movie
   <i key="2bb6c2d9-3167-467c-8f0c-aa257b109025">
    Center Stage
   </i>
   and spent an entire summer learning the red shoe dance, breaking three lamps in the process.
  </p>
  <p key="db61776b-7aef-4c5b-927f-89765f331780">
   One night, on the roof of the
   Danvers' house
   , Kara convinced Alex to sneak out and go flying with her, despite the latter's initial protests. During the ride, Alex confided in Kara the story about a family trip she took with her parents to Nagano when she was seven and taught Kara a rhyme which a local girl taught her: "
   <i key="8e45fc78-b757-422f-8db2-1b0c1b71c26e">
    yubikiri genman, uso tsuitara
   </i>
   ", which means "pinky swear".
   Kara and Alex were later caught sneaking back into the house by Eliza and Jeremiah. The couple scolded the girls and Jeremiah reminded Kara that her powers were being kept secret from the public in order to protect her. When someone knocked on the door, the girls were sent up to their room, with Eliza ordering Kara not to use her super-hearing to listen in on their conversation. A year later, Jeremiah 'died' protecting a
   martian
   from the
   D.E.O.
   's ruthless director,

   but Kara and Alex were told by Eliza that he died in a plane crash.

  <p key="00114cf5-b085-4051-bd67-7d83e2f0901e">
   Kara was invited by Clark to see the
   Fortress of Solitude
   several times, though she always rejected the offers, fearing the fortress would remind her of Krypton and make her homesick.

  <p key="0bbb1c71-0942-498b-a321-32e02aba7ace">
   In
   high school
   , Kara's relationship with Alex became strained after Jeremiah's apparent death. She was considered an outcast at school and her only friend was
   Kenny Li
   . One night when she was 15, Kara and Kenny went stargazing in the woods and almost shared a kiss before the former pulled away. The next morning, Kara's super hearing picked up a police scanner identifying a body with a description matching Kenny's. She rushed to the forest and saw Kenny dead, much to her devastation. Later in school, Kara interrogated the football team's quarterback
   Jake Howell
   , who was always bullying Kenny. He revealed Kenny caught him smoking pot on campus but had an alibi. Later that day, she visited Kenny's parents to express her condolences and promised to find his missing telescope, despite Sheriff
   Ronald Collins
   ' advice to let the police handle it. That night in the woods, Kara encountered Alex, whom she almost hit with heat vision. The duo found Kenny's laptop and took it home, where Kara sent the encrypted files to Clark's friend
   Chloe
   . In Kenny's email, they found a picture of their history teacher,
   Mr. Bernard
   , kissing Alex's friend
   Josie
   , much to their shock.
  </p>
  <p key="fae4a8f7-38ae-4e5d-9fed-2e50bbaf8bdc">
   The next night while walking home together, Kara and Alex were nearly hit by a speeding car, but Kara was able to use her powers to protect Alex and herself. At home, Eliza scolded Kara for getting Alex and herself into trouble and directed her to "
   Noel Nil
   ", an
   F.B.I.
   agent who knew about Kara's powers and resembled her late mother. Kara expressed her frustrations with living on Earth, desiring to fight crime alongside her cousin. Noel kindly reminded Kara she's only 15 and using her powers could have consequences for Eliza and Alex as well. Kara agreed and, in
   Kryptonese
   , said, "I love you, Mom." After Noel left, Kara declined to help Alex when the latter realized Mr. Bernard didn't kill Kenny. Upon receiving the decrypted files from Chloe, Kara realized Collins was responsible, as Kenny caught him dealing drugs. She tried to call Alex, only to learn she had been taken hostage. Kara then flew to the school and followed Alex's voice to the boiler room, where she knocked out Collins and rescued her sister.
  </p>
  <p key="ec20c3fb-68a7-4838-8f3d-71ecc89777d1">
   A few days later, Alex and Kara ate lunch at school together. Kara revealed that Kenny had a photo of her flying but kept it secret and was overjoyed that he liked "all of [her]". Alex invited Kara to hang out after school, which the latter agreed to. Kara promised to work on being human while Alex promised to try and be a better sister. Deciding that the world didn't need another hero, Kara tried to live a normal life and accept her future on Earth.
  </p>
  <p key="6e13349b-1b41-4f1c-b143-90ff2e6e6f15">
   Over the years, the bond between Kara and Alex became so strong that neither of them can imagine their lives without the other.

   In high school, Kara developed a rivalry with a girl she nicknamed
   Belinda-the-Bully
   .
   When attending the school prom, Kara accidentally stomped on the foot of her dance partner, breaking three of his toes.
   After graduation, Kara attended
   Stanhope College
   , where she had a professor named
   Haley
   ,
   and then
   National City University
   , where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Marketing. During college, Kara also worked as a part-time nanny to the Quinton family in the summer of 2009 and spent the next summer doing an internship at the
   Midvale Newspaper
   . Afterwards, Kara waitressed at
   Noonan's Restaurant
   for three years.
   After Kara became an adult, she moved to
   her own apartment
   on
   Hammersmith Tower
   .

   In 2013, sometime after graduating college, Kara went for a job interview at
   CatCo Worldwide Media
   as
   Cat Grant
   's assistant. There, Kara met
   Winn Schott
   and secretly used her abilities during the interview to impress Cat and secure the job.
   Kara's sentimental life was always difficult and she often had trouble with kissing; she broke the noses of at least four partners due to not controlling her strength.

   save the flight

   Kara later learned that Clark had in-fact asked James to come to National City to keep an eye on her. Kara was confused as to why her cousin didn't just tell her he wanted her to be a hero himself, to which James explained that Clark wanted her to choose that path for herself, the same way he had to, as that was what made a hero. Kara was then given the blanket Kal-El was wrapped in as a baby, which James had been entrusted with to give to Kara for her to use as a cape.

   A week later, Kara tested her abilities with the D.E.O. She later stopped a fire at the
   National City Port
   , and the next day at work, Kara was present at the meeting where Cat told her employees that she wanted an interview with Supergirl. However, Kara after, quickly told James that she wasn't going to do it, as Cat would recognize her. Kara was later contacted by Alex regarding an alien theft at
   Plastino Chemicals
   , with Kara identifying it as a
   Hellgrammite
   afterwards. Kara offered to subdue the Hellgrammite, though her offer was rejected by Henshaw who wanted her to prove that she could handle herself beforehand. Kara was then brought into the D.E.O. training room and swiftly defeated by Alex. Arriving into work the next day sore, Kara took advice, given by Cat Grant of starting small and working her way up, and enlisted the help of both Winn and James. With their help, Kara was able to handle several situations. Later at her apartment, she thanked Winn and James for their help and was soon after given an apology by Alex. The following day, Kara listened in on James' conversation with Cat, giving him a pep-talk after he was given a dilemma by Cat. Directly after, Kara was called by Henshaw who notified her that Alex had been abducted by the Hellgrammite. After criticizing Henshaw, Kara tracked down Alex at the warehouse she was being held captive at.

   During her interview with Cat, Kara accidentally revealed that her and Superman were cousins, flying off afterwards. The next morning at Noonan's, Kara was teased about her crush on James by Alex, who also told her she had to stop telling people her identity as Supergirl. At CatCo, Cat told Kara that she would be writing an expose on Supergirl for an issue of their monthly magazine, and that'd they be having a big party to launch it. Kara was later alerted by Agent Vasquez of a multiple car collision on the highway. While there, she encountered a masked villain who attacked her, and after a brief battle between the two, the man flew away after she damaged his suit. Back at the D.E.O. headquarters, the man was identified as
   Reactron
   , an old villain of Superman. After, Kara was told by Henshaw that the D.E.O. wasn't going to help her deal with him, as Reactron was human, and fell out of their jurisdiction. Later, Kara and James were shown Ed Flaherty's old office by Winn, who had turned it into a base for their Supergirl matters. While going over Reactron's powers and his history with Superman, James suggested that Kara call Superman for assistance, much to her reluctance. After being informed of Maxwell Lord's capture by Reactron, and discovering the latter's identity, Kara found out the location of Reactron's hideout, saving Maxwell though she was soon defeated by Reactron, and subsequently saved by Superman. The next day, she discovered that Supergirl was being discredited by Lord in the media because of Superman's intervention, and dismissed James after discovering that James called him. At Cat's party, Kara danced with Winn and later James, though Reactron broke in interrupting them. As Supergirl, Kara stops him, successfully removing the power core, powering his suit. Back at her apartment, Kara and Alex make up, with Alex suggesting that Kara asks James out. However, when Kara goes to his office the next day, Kara sees Lucy Lane, James' ex and the sister of
   Lois Lane
   , who arrived to talk to him. Kara overhears the conversation, leading her to believe that Lucy wants to get back with James. Upset about this, even giving Winn the cold shoulder, Kara received a texted apology from Clark.

   While flying in National City, Kara encountered a drone and destroyed it, afterwards blaming the D.E.O. for following her. Later at CatCo, Kara offered to watch Cat Grant's son,
   Carter
   , after discovering that Grant had won the Siegel Award for Women in Media, and didn't have anyone to watch him. At Noonan's, Kara talked with James about his relationship problems with Lucy Lane, leaving after finding out a bomb had went off in a building nearby. After saving the building, Kara was soon after reminded by a call from Cat Grant, that she was late to pick up Carter. After picking up Carter at St. Edmund Hall, Kara brought him back to CatCo and later stopped James from venting to her about Lucy. Kara then received a call from Alex about the bomb at Lord Technologies, arriving there as Supergirl, and successfully getting the bomb clear of the city, being knocked unconscious from the bomb's explosion. She later awoke at the D.E.O., and was informed of the bomber's identity,
   Ethan Knox
   . Though she offered to help, Kara was ordered by Alex to sit out on the case, after falling from the height she had. While getting lunch from Noonan's, Kara encountered Lucy Lane who confided in her about her problems with James, which she later recounted to James. While going to protect Maxwell Lord's super train on its opening, Kara was alerted to a bomb at

Kara then received a call from Winn who told her both Carter and Knox were on the train, deducing that there two bombs, and telling Alex and Hank to handle the airport, and she'd handle the train. Arriving on the train, Supergirl alerted Lord of the bomb and told him and Carter to get all of the passengers to the back of the train. After finding Knox, she pleaded with him to deactivate the bomb, though to no avail, having to detach the train car that Ethan was in from the rest of the train, watching it blow up from a distance. The next morning she was berated by Cat for letting Carter get onto the train, and later that day confronted Maxwell Lord after discovering he was the true culprit behind the bombings.

   As Supergirl, Kara stopped an alien convict from escaping the D.E.O.. At her apartment, Kara along with Alex greeted Alex's mother and Kara's adoptive mother,
   Eliza Danvers
   , with Eliza complimenting Kara on her work as Supergirl. At CatCo Kara invited Winn to her family's
   Thanksgiving
   dinner, after finding out he had no plans. Afterwards she listened in on Cat demoting
   Leslie Willis
   to the traffic chopper, and she later in the day had to save Leslie from the helicopter after lightning hit the aircraft. While doing so, lightning traveled through Kara and electrocuted Leslie, putting her into the hospital. The next day, Kara went with Cat to visit Leslie in
   National City Hospital
   . During Thanksgiving dinner, Kara announced that before everyone ate, she wanted them to go around saying what they were all grateful for. After going first, Kara excused herself to answer a call from James. After an argument between Eliza and Alex broke out, and Winn and Alex left, Kara left to handle an emergency for Cat Grant. While there, Livewire arrived and attacked both Kara and Cat, with Kara causing Leslie to flee as Supergirl. Later, Kara discussed what had happened with Henshaw, who deduced that Kara was the Element X in Leslie getting her powers. Back in Cat's office, the two had a conversation about the death of Kara's parents, her current family problems, and Cat's problems with her own mother. Kara agreed to ask the FBI for a direct line to Supergirl, as well as taking Cat's offer to go home. At the D.E.O. Kara was given an industrial capacitor to capture Leslie with, and working with Cat, she was able to grab a water pipe under the street and short out Leslie with it. Before leaving, Eliza revealed to Kara and Alex that Jeremiah died working for the D.E.O., under Hank Henshaw.

   Kara later broke up a road rage between two men, causing one of the men to confront her. Kara caught his punch, and twisted his arm, scaring children in the process. She was later criticized for her actions by both Maxwell Lord and Hank Henshaw. Kara and Alex later persuaded Winn to hack into the D.E.O. mainframe to discover what had happened to Jeremiah Danvers. Both Kara and Alex were called by Henshaw and at the D.E.O. base camp, General Lane arrived, demanding that Supergirl fight their field robot,
   Red Tornado
   . The next day, Kara as Supergirl flew to the D.E.O. base camp for her fight with Red Tornado. As the fight progressed, Supergirl lost her temper, breaking off Red Tornado's arm in the process. At CatCo, Kara lashed out at Cat, as she was frustrated with always being yelled at, despite working hard at her job. Kara and Cat later had drinks together at Noonan's, with Cat giving Kara advice on controlling her temper at work, furthermore find out why she was angry. Kara was alerted by James of Red Torando's appearance, with Kara arriving as Supergirl and engaging the android in combat. However, Kara had to diffuse a tornado Red Tornado caused, allowing it to escape. At a garage, Kara and James blew off steam together, with Kara hitting a car, losing her temper, and soon after confiding in James that she thought she'd never find love or a normal life. At the D.E.O., Kara was informed by Alex that Morrow was still controlling Red Tornado.

   After the D.E.O. drew the robot out using hologram technology, Supergirl engaged Red Tornado and used her heat vision in an attempt to stop Red Tornado once and for all, causing the android to explode. While later cleaning up a glass from a cup she had dropped, Kara cut herself, much to her surprise.
   She was later informed by the A.I. hologram of her mother, that her powers had been drained after she used the full power of her heat vision. Though she is told that her abilities should return in a few days, and Kara is urged by Alex to enjoy her day without her powers. Kara is later sent home by Cat for the day, when Cat sees her sneeze. She later encounters James, and an earthquake occurs soon afterwards, with a car almost colliding with Kara, and although James knocks her out of the way, she sustains a broken arm. After Maxwell Lord criticized Supergirl's absence, Kara and James visited him, with him claiming that Supergirl no longer had her powers due to her recent fight with Red Tornado and may never get them back. Back on the streets, Kara was present when Maxwell attempts to save a woman's father, though in the absence of an X-ray machine to find a venous thrombosis, he failed. Without her power of X-ray vision, Kara was unable to save the man as well, making her feel helpless.

   Kara heard a robbery happening nearby, showing up as Supergirl, and talked the robber out of it, with James snapping a photo of the event. She was later informed by Winn, that an adrenaline rush will restore her powers. After James almost fell down an elevator shaft trying to save CatCo employees on other floors, the moment allowed for Kara's powers to return. With her powers back, Kara stops several disasters, including a bus of children from falling off a bridge, and a fire at West National City Bank. Kara was later told by Winn that he was disappointed in her, for her actions with James, despite him having a girlfriend.

   Kara fought them off, and although Astra attempted to persuade Kara to join them, Kara refused and left. She then returned to the D.E.O. to inform Alex and Hank, though they suggested she not rush anything, and get some rest. The following day, Kara was asked by Cat to bring in Winn and James for help after news broke of her leaked email server. At the D.E.O., Kara sparred with Alex, with the latter chiding her for hesitating during their session, and furthermore that she thought DEO should handle the Kryptonian threat, because of Kara's familial ties. Kara and James informed Cat that there wasn't anything in the emails that could be used to slander her, though Kara was later told by Cat to keep looking for any more leaks, as she suspected
   Dirk Armstrong
   was going to find some way to damage her reputation. Kara, using her super-hearing, listened to Armstrong admitting to having set Cat up. Kara then asked James to enlist Lucy's help in tracking a paper trail to clear Cat's name. Soon after, Kara went to confront Astra, who had called her out publicly. During their battle, Kara eventually gains the upperhand, taking an unconscious Astra back to the D.E.O.. There, Kara discovers her mother had used her to summon Astra in the past, to get the latter arrested. At CatCo, Kara learned about Adam Foster, an individual in
   Opal City

Kara told James and Winn of Cat suspecting her to be Supergirl, a suspicion Cat continued to test through various challenges. Kara is present when Non contacted the D.E.O., offering to trade Hank for Astra. Much to her horror, Kara later had to sit by while General Lane tortures Astra with a

At CatCo, Kara was given the dilemma of proving that she isn't Supergirl or being fired by Cat, as Supergirl would be just wasting her time playing assistant. Later, Kara thanked Cat for the opportunity to work with her and resigned, explaining that Cat's suspicions make it impossible for her to do her job. Afterwards, she discovered James' injuries that he had sustained, after investigating Maxwell Lord, and announced that she'd go after him. While visiting Astra, Astra told her that going through with the exchange is the only way to rescue Hank. Kara agreed, though there was initial protest from General Lane. She was present when the trade was made, and though Non springs an ambush, Astra called off the attack, demanding that Non honor the agreement. Hank later used his shapeshifting ability to impersonate Supergirl so that Cat could see Kara and Supergirl interact, proving (as far as she knew) that they were not one and the same, and Kara is offered her job back. Though Kara is offered full-time job at the D.E.O. by Hank, she rejected it, citing that her relationships at CatCo were what humanizes her, like what the D.E.O did for him. She later had an online chat with Superman, who offers her both support, and assistance if she ever needs it.

Kara then confronted Winn, who told her his father's crimes and showed Kara a doll he received on his desk, from Winslow Sr. Later, Kara questioned Cat's reason for hiring Lucy, only to have Cat accuse her of making a move for James. Kara went along with Winn when the

Back at CatCo, Kara was informed that Winslow Sr. must be hiding in an abandoned factory that he had used to own. Kara flew off to capture him before the FBI. When she arrived at the factory Kara was trapped in a box of quicksand, and overheard a girl's voice from an overhead box that was about to be dropped into a shredder. She escaped but discovered a Supergirl doll in the box, allowing Winslow Sr. to escape. At her apartment, Kara was kissed by Winn while the two were talking, but rejected him. At National City Toy Con, Kara later saved Winn from being shot by several F.B.I. agents, and used her x-ray vision to see Winslow Sr. set bombs on a timer. She turned on the sprinklers and freezed the water to create a frozen shield that protected the Con's attendees, foiling Winslow Sr.'s plans and subduing him. Later at CatCo, Kara tried to apologize to Winn, who in turn apologized for kissing her, though she wasn't sure where they stood because of his feelings for her.

   while testing his speed. Kara proceeded to fly off but stopped in order to talk to him. Introducing himself and explaining that he was from
   another universe
   , he asked for her help to return. Kara took Barry to their makeshift base at CatCo, where he was introduced to Winn and James, explaining to all of them the concept of the
   multiverse
   . Promising to help him get home, Kara enlisted Barry's help with Siobhan and Livewire. She then took him to the D.E.O., introducing him to director Lucy Lane. Tracking Siobhan and Livewire, they found them at an abandoned warehouse. Despite being unsuccessful in their attempts to subdue them, Barry suggested that Kara needed to slow down and stop trying so hard, drawing from personal experience.

   Back at the D.E.O., Kara was contacted by James, telling her than Cat Grant had been kidnapped by Livewire and Siobhan, now known as Silver Banshee. Utilizing ear bud-type devices, the two villains were quickly defeated, along with the help of National City citizens and the fire department. Later, Barry and Kara returned to the desert. They combined their speed in a race, with Kara throwing him through a

   Kara arrives at the D.E.O., and attempts to stop a prisoner,
   Maxima
   , from escaping. However, Lucy stops her with Kryptonite bullets, though she is able to stop the rest of the prisoners from escaping by destroying the computer terminal, using the afterburners from her pod. After removing the bullet, she flies to the Fortress of Solitude to find her cousin Superman, but Kelex tells Kara that he is not on Earth and refuses to inform her about Myriad. However, the A.I. of Alura explains that Myriad was a mind-control system Astra and Non were arrested for trying to use against the people of Krypton, also learning Kara that once Myriad is in effect it can't be stopped. Back in National City, Kara is noticing everyone, even Winn and James, are now under the Myriad effect and watching Kryptonian codes on the screen, General Lane has placed the entire city under quarantine, but Kara informs him that she will help save his daughter. However, she soon finds out Maxwell Lord and Cat Grant are both unaffected, due to Max's technology. Non soon arrives, and forces James, Winn, and Kelly to jump to their deaths. Kara however is only able to save Winn and James. Soon after, she warns Alex not to come to National City, or else she'd be under the control of Myriad. She later agrees to go along with Maxwell Lord's plan, though Cat opposes to it. The two go to Lord Technologies to convince Lord not to launch his bomb, and the trio went to Cat's original broadcasting station intending to broadcast a counter signal to Myriad. However, Alex arrives under the control of Myriad, and in Kryptonite armor, engaging Kara in battle.

   During the fight, Kara was swiftly defeated by Alex and almost killed, until J'onn arrived with Eliza, who talked Alex out of it, breaking Myriad's control over her. In the broadcasting station, Kara successfully broke Myriad's control over the people of National City, by giving a speech about hope. Later at the D.E.O., Maxwell Lord informed them that the Kryptonians were now using Myriad, increasing the frequency until every human's cranium exploded. Before she could leave, Maxwell Lord warned Kara that this was in fact a suicide mission as she had no backup. After hearing such, Kara gave Winn, Cat, and James goodbyes of sorts at CatCo. She later, identified the device Maxwell Lord had discovered that was powering Myriad, as a
   Omegahedron
   , energy devices used on Krypton. After being informed that the Non and the Kryptonians were hiding out in Nevada in Fort Rozz, Kara went to confront them, along with J'onn who the D.E.O. agreed to release. Before she left, Kara gave Alex the necklace her mother had given her, to keep it safe. There, Supergirl and Non fought each other, and Indigo and J'onn battled one another. Kara eventually defeated Non in a heat vision face off, and a dying Indigo revealed that she had locked Fort Rozz's system, so they couldn't fly away the ship, which was powering Myriad. Kara decided to fly the ship into space, telling her sister goodbye over her intercom. After exiting the atmosphere, Supergirl began to pass out and suffocate. However she was saved by Alex who used her pod to rescue her. Back at the D.E.O., Kara was congratulated, and the next day at work Kara received praise from Clark via message, and was promoted by Cat. Later at her apartment, Kara had a celebratory dinner, though it was interrupted when a pod flying in the sky caught their attention, causing Kara and J'onn. At the crash site, Kara recognized the pod as identical to hers, and was surprised at what she found inside.

After that Kara comes home and starts to pick up a dress for her date with James. As he arrives, bringing pizza and ravioli, Kara turns on the TV, where they see the launch of the Venture spacecraft, which suddenly begins to fall due to engine failure.

Then Clark decides to join the investigations on the fall of the shuttle and offers to go to CatCo with Kara. There Kara apologizes to James for having interrupted their date and appoint a new one. After this Kara and Clark go to the

Later Lena Luthor's helicopter was attacked by drones, but Supergirl and Superman saved her, destroying them, and then Supergirl told Lena that someone wants to kill her. Later, Kara tried to talk Lena out of doing her speech, but she said that she should do it.

   The next day Kara came to Cat and said that she decided to become a reporter. Cat said she knew that she would have chosen this position.

   After she was promoted to reporter, Cat introduced Kara to her new boss,

   Metropolis
   , to which Kara was clearly upset. At this point, the news reported about a man who is about to jump down a bridge, so Supergirl and Superman arrive at the site only to discover this person is John Corben, who is now a Kryptonite-powered cyborg dubbed Metallo. He struck Kara with a Kryptonite beam and she lost consciousness, but before he can kill her, Superman threw him off the bridge and brought Kara to the D.E.O.; the next day, Kara returned to CatCo and came to Snapper, but he refused to give her any instructions, saying she is not working there, which outraged Kara, who went to miss Grant and ask her for help, however Cat told her that she should resolve her problem by herself and also that she decided to leave the company to experience something new.

Kara then once again came to Snapper, giving him an article about the battle between Supergirl and Metallo with the testimony of eyewitnesses, and the comments of police, but he did not even want to read it entirely, then Kara said she would find another magazine who will take her article, but he stopped her and said to come back tomorrow. Immediately after that, Kara went to D.E.O., to say goodbye to Clark, who returns to Metropolis. Then she decided to visit the comatose alien, who suddenly woke up and seized Kara by the neck,

   Later J'onn told Kara that
   President Olivia Marsdin
   will come to D.E.O. during her visit to National City, which she commits to sign a decree on granting aliens the rights of US citizens, a news Kara was very excited about, especially After Alex tells her that the President expects Supergirl would meet her as her plane arrives. Later, at work, during a meeting Snapper gave each member of the staff a commission instead of James, and Kara, instead of an interview with the President, was sent to Lena Luthor. Kara, in the guise of Supergirl, arrives at the airport to meet Olivia Marsdin, but as soon as she got off the plane, she was attacked and nearly killed if not for the intervention of Supergirl.

   After that Kara comes to Lena Luthor, as she needed a comment from "the sister of the most famous alien hater". Lena tells her that L-Corp developed a new device that will identify aliens and offers Kara to test it. When Lena turned, Kara used her laser vision to sabotage the device and then agrees to test it, so it gives a negative result. Lena believes that people have the right to know who is an alien and who is not, therefore, she plans to put the device in all the country stores.
In the evening, Kara brings Snapper the article with Lena Luthor's comments, but he refuses to accept it as it is written too biased, and requires a rewrite. In D.E.O. she is struggling with her rewrite before Winn is able to locate the fugitive alien with Alex's help. They find that he's at the observatory and sending out a deep space signal. At first, Kara believes that he's trying to contact Krypton but Winn sees that the signal isn't heading for Krypton but to the planet
   Daxam
   . She immediately then goes to catch him.

   When she arrives, she physically confronts him as she believes that he is the one who attacked the President. A fight breaks out between them, resulting in the Daxamite getting knocked unconscious by Kara. She takes him to the D.E.O., where she explains to Alex, Winn and J'onn that Krypton had warred against Daxam for generations. She went to confront the Daxamite and they fell into a small argument about how each of their planets view the other's people. Kara then asked why he was at the observatory and he told her that he was just sending a distress call as he was stranded. Kara asked him why he had attacked the President if he was marooned but he claimed to not know what she was talking about which she didn't believe.
  </p>
  <p key="fc6fadc2-aea3-4792-85e2-74f19739ce81">
   Later Kara came back to Lena, who praised her for her wonderful article, although she admitted that initially thought that Kara would "mix it with mud" because of their different views. Olivia Marsdin gave her speech and was about to sign the decree, when she was attacked again. The culprit turned out to be
   Scorcher
   , who managed to escape. Later, Alex found out the factory warehouse was where the criminal was hiding and she, along with Kara, arrived at the place and managed to defeat her.
The next day, Kara apologized to the alien from Daxam,
   Mon-El
   , for having treated him biased due to the fact that her people considers Daxamites a race of bullies and hedonists, and for the fact that she accused him of the attempted assassination of the President. After that, he introduced himself as Mon-El and said he wanted to send a signal back home, but Kara was forced to tell him that Daxam had expired after Krypton's explosion.

Later, she went to work and told Snapper the news, but he refused her article, as she did not have any official sources. Later, after Alex and Maggie found the underground alien fight club, Kara arrives to back them up but, after the ringmaster,
   Roulette

  <p key="67534405-56c6-4e24-aa74-a8f6f6fa582d">
   In the evening Kara stopped Roulette's limousine and told her that she will stop her illegal fights, to which Roulette replied that her club does not violate the law, as aliens are not people, and therefore they have no rights, pointing that on the contrary, she is giving them a place where they can "find glory and earn money". Roulette then told her that she could try to stop the matches but wouldn't stop them for long as she is offering her fighters more than Kara could.

  <p key="67d2d7e8-2e7d-4304-98ce-c0f65aabe7a3">
   The next day, in D.E.O., Kara wonders if Roulette might have been right about Kara offering nothing to aliens but Alex tells her that Roulette only offers fear and she can give them more than that. Kara then learns that Mon-El had left the D.E.O. with Winn, without permission, and had accidentally injured some people in a bar. She goes to speak with Mon-El about their powers, and about her parents and what they were. Before she left, he told her that he had heard about her fight with Draaga and that he'd seen him fight years ago with the Daxam Royal Family. He told her that during that battle a sword hit him in the right leg, making it his weak spot.

   The next day Kara learns from Alex that J'onn and M'gann were kidnapped by Roulette and, after she obtains from Lena Luthor the new address in which Roulette will host the battle, Kara comes to it and managed to defeat Draaga. Then she explains to the aliens that Roulette is in fact their enemy, so they agree and let Alex and Maggie arrest her. The next day Kara comes to Snapper and gives him an article about the fight club, which has an official police report, criminological analysis and comment from Supergirl. He takes the article, but asks to correct some errors. Then she comes to the

Back in CatCo, Kara learns from Eve that Mon-El asked her to do the work that James had given to him, so she approaches him and explains that he has to do his job. At this point, Lena Luthor comes to CatCo and invites her to a charity event to raise funds for a children's hospital. Then Kara is called Alex, who told her about another robbery, Kara arrives on the scene, and one of the gang members with the help of anti-gravity gun sends a police car in the sky. Flying behind the car, Supergirl managed to saves the policeman, then she returns to CatCo and found Mon-El making out with Eve. Angered, she tells him that she tries to help him fit but he spoils everything, and that if he does not want to do anything he would look for another coach. Later Kara comes home and found Alex at her door, she tells her that she is in some ways confused but, seeing Kara upset, Alex immediately asks her what happened and the latter responds that Mon-El did not perceive the work seriously. Alex advises Kara to let Mon-El find what he is interested; after that, Kara asks Alex if she was going to say something, but before she can speak, Lena came to Kara's apartment and asked her to arrange a meeting with Supergirl. In the evening, Kara arrives at the L-Corp in the guise of Supergirl and Lena invited her to her charity party in the case of gang attacks. The next evening, Kara and Winn arrives at the charity event, where Kara supports two conversations at once with Lena, both as Supergirl and in her civilian identity, by rapidly changing clothes.

The next day Kara comes to Mon-El and says that he was fired, then she tells that she will not force him to live as she sees fit, and that he can find what he likes.

   At this point, Alex asks Kara to talk in private, and they went out into the street.

In the evening J'onn sent Kara and Alex in the National City University to arrest doctor
   Rudy Jones
   , who was infected by an alien parasite. However, as Kara hit him, he grabbed her hand, sucked out of it a part of her life forces and escaped. The next day at Kara's apartment she told a visiting Alex, which is scared that Kara is disappointed in her, that she could never be disappointed in her and that she is completely okay with it that Alex is a lesbian, and understands how it feels to keep part of themselves locked away. She encourages Alex to pursue a relationship with Maggie if that is what she desires and shows that she support her sister and her feelings for Maggie. Later in the city center, Kara discovered that Mon-El has found new work as a loan enforcer, and in the heated conversation that followed, she told him she was disappointed and that he was no hero, and in turn he told her she was not really altruistic, but rather an attention seeker. The exchange left both disheartened. In the evening, J'onn and Supergirl confront Parasite, who defeat them simultaneously sucking the life forces of them both; then they are rescued by Alex and taken at the D.E.O., where Kara quickly recovers thanks to solar radiators.

Back at the D.E.O., Mon-El woke, fully recovered thanks to Eliza's reverse engineering of a living sample of the virus. The following day, Kara returned home with a number of bags to find Barry Allen and
   Cisco Ramon
   , wishing to have a favor repaid.

   Around a week after returning from Earth-1, a grieving mother came to CatCo seeking help from Snapper Carr on finding her daughter,
   Izzy
   , who had disappeared. Though Snapper appeared unsympathetic, Kara eagerly decided to assist. She sought out Maggie Sawyer at Al's Dive Bar, gaining information about a suspicious clinic offering monetary rewards for blood tests. Together with Mon-El, who learned of her quest and decided to help, they investigated the clinic under the disguise of a couple of millennials. Soon they discovered the personnel there are in fact aliens and Kara pursued them through the portal that connects Earth to their planet. Despite being told to get help, Mon-El decided to follow her, however they found themselves stranded on a planet with a red sun and, therefore, are both powerless. While Mon-El wanted to retreat, Kara insisted they press on with the mission regardless. Spotting a fortress which they determined to be the aliens' base of operation, they headed towards it only to be ambushed by a local harmless hermit, Jo, from which they learned they're on
   Maaldoria, the "Slaver's Moon"
   , a hub of sentient trafficking. Kara and Mon-El were able to infiltrate the slavers' fortress by feigning surrender, and afterwards they encountered Roulette, who was partially behind the operation. They also discovered the missing humans, and with them were soon sold to a Dominator.
  </p>
  <p key="f2151360-cda3-4390-8f9c-bd97da1bd483">
   After Kara had a talk with Mon-El about heroism, the slavers ordered the group to start moving. Kara, despite having no powers, attempted to block them from taking the others, only to be hit with electric shocks. As the slavers repeatedly tortured her with their weapons, the others, seeing her in agony, were moved by her sacrifice and seized the opportunity to disarm the slavers moving together to escape. They were then helped out of the fortress and taken to the portal by Alex and the strike team that she had assembled.
   Kara started Mon-El with his hero training at the D.E.O. At that time,
   Livewire
   had escaped from prison and Kara is greatly upset about her nemesis being at large. When the police were attacked by two people with Livewire's powers Kara and Mon-El went to stop them. Kara told Mon-El to stay and protect the officers while she fought the Livewires. Mon-El shielded them from the lightning but when he saw that Kara was starting to be in trouble, he left the officers to try and save her. He accidentally deflected a lightning blast to one of the officers but luckily Guardian had been there to absorb most of it with his shield. After the Livewires retreated, they saw that Guardian was really Jimmy Olsen and Kara has a massive fight with him as she disapprove the risk he is taking, however he reminded her she is not the one who decide who can be an hero and angrily leaves. Later Kara confronted Mon-El with abandoning the officers and he defended himself stating that he saw she was in trouble. However, Kara asked if the real reason that Mon-El was doing this was for her, which Mon-El just left her without answering. Later, it was revealed that Livewire had been kidnapped by a scientist to make Livewire soldiers and Kara felt guilty for not having think about it because of their past together.

  <p key="1944d960-e8b0-4cd5-8899-535fcde4fe7b">
   Meanwhile, to prove their value in Kara, with the help of Winn Mon-El and Guardian track down Livewire's copies and the scientist who created them but they're both subdued. Later Winn revealed their location to Kara an she arrived to help free them and Livewire and together the four stopped the scientist and his soldiers. As Livewire was about to kill her former captor, Supergirl moved to reason her not to do it but letting him go to jail insisted, to which Livewire agreed after Supergirl promised not to look for her until after the scientist was locked away, then Livewire left her, promising to return.
That evening, Kara told both James and Winn that she had always seen them as heroes even before they became vigilantes and that if they intended to continue she will neither stop nor support them, however they claimed they will not stop. Later Mon-El visited Kara at her apartment and confessed that he remembered kissing her when he was sick. He also told Kara that he saved her during the attack because he cared about her. Though he said that he understood that she might not feel the same way but he asked Kara to still work with him and help him become a hero.

   Kara had an awkward conversation at Al's Dive Bar where she attempted to smooth things over with Mon-El while justifying why she didn't like him. After he left, she found Alex and intended to discuss plans to celebrate the day she arrived on Earth to alleviate her stress, however Alex had other plans with Maggie and proposed to postpone the event; despite being visibly hurt, Kara wished Alex a good time. Outside, M'gann confronted J'onn about following her around in different disguises, while J'onn explained it was for her safety against a White Martian attack. That proved to be true in the midst of their conversation as
   Armek
   emerged to attack them. Kara arrived outside to intervene and drove Armek away.

  <p key="1a9fd865-eb8e-4391-9e42-294dbca55c77">
   J'onn decided to invite M'gann to the protection of the DEO headquarters. Kara was present with others in the building when Armek impersonated M'gann and attacked. J'onn sealed the structure to prevent his escape as the group devised means of identifying who Armek may be impersonating next. After a flame test it was revealed that Armek impersonated Winn, and he escaped after a brief fight with Kara and J'onn. J'onn deduced the real Winn must also be in the building, and the group discovered the reactor of the building has been set to explode. Kara alongside Alex searched for the real Winn, and she revealed her feelings to Alex on the way. However it was soon revealed there was a second White Martian, and it has impersonated Alex. Kara was able to defeat this one after a long fight, while Armek was killed by M'gann.

   The real Alex experienced their conversation through the Martian's telepathic bond and went to Kara's apartment to talk to her. The sisters made peace and celebrated Kara's Earth Birthday together. However Alex also deduced Kara wanted to devote lengthy plans to her celebration to distract away from other emotional stress. After Alex suggests it, Kara eventually claims she has feelings for Mon-El. Under her sister's encouragement, she decides to confess her attraction to him. She encountered him at CatCo the next day, but as she was about to speak to him about her feelings, Mon-El revealed he was on a date with Eve. As the two left, Kara was once again alone feeling disheartened.

   After Lena betrayed her mother and caused her arrest, Lilian was on trial for her various acts of terror. After learning of this Kara felt like she should speak to her friend in this time of need. She encouraged Lena to visit her mother in prison, which the latter did. Shortly after her visit however, John Corben was secretly given back his Kryptonite heart by a Cadmus agent and, during the hearing, after being brought as a witness, Metallo attacked the people gathered at the court. Supergirl intervened but was unable to apprehend either Metallo or Lilian who he helped escape, as Metallo destroyed a nearby crane forcing her to save people instead.
  </p>
  <p key="00ab8902-1fbd-44de-92f0-7d8bb927dc06">
   As the empowerment of Metallo occurred during the same time as Lena's visit to her mother, suspicions fell on her as the instigator. When video evidence was found of Lena retrieving kryptonite, she was arrested by Maggie Sawyer. Despite all her friends, including her sister and J'onn all believing Lena was guilty, Kara refused to believe her friend abandoned the side of good. This caused a minor rift between her and James, who told her the similar story of Superman and Lex Luthor. While at CatCo, Kara also encountered
   Eve
   and asked her about her date with Mon-El. She learned that Mon-El still had feelings for her as during his date he spoke about Kara the whole time.
  </p>
  <p key="1d591b6a-0b0e-4cec-ac34-de3771470d48">
   Upon Kara's insistence, Winn examined the footage evidence and discovered it was in fact Hank Henshaw who retrieved the Kryptonite. Now vindicated in her belief in Lena, she flew to Lex Luthor's mountain base, where Lena was held by her mother. Despite being briefly incapacitated by a sonic device and once more overpowered by Metallo, with the help of Martian Manhunter she was able to rescue Lena from her captors. Metallo's kryptonite heart had become unstable, and despite Kara's pleas for him to save himself, he exploded with the facility.

  <p key="19daeb48-7bd4-4a40-a23e-776495fb2097">
   Lena thanked Kara in her office and their friendship was reaffirmed. Kara also mended her friendship with James, inviting him to a game night. At her apartment that night, she met with Mon-El, to whom she confessed her attraction. At that moment however they were interrupted by
   Mr. Mxyzptlk
   , who materialized out of nowhere and proclaimed his love for her.
  </p>
  <p key="7d6444b1-daa8-48d2-bd41-69530d8d2d30">
   Mxyzptlk immediately conjured and filled Kara's apartment with flowers and a concerto before he quickly told Kara again that he was in love with her. Mxyzptlk banished Mon-El away before he told Kara that he wanted her to marry him before placing her into a wedding dress.
  </p>
  <p key="3e3dcf43-f44c-4512-97c0-6d3f3b810c78">
   Kara quickly and gently told him that she was flattered but she wasn't going to marry him. However, Mxyzptlk thought she was just playing hard to get and told her that he liked a challenge. She went back to the D.E.O. and learned from both J'onn and Mon-El that Mxyzptlk was a fifth dimensional being with powers bordering on magical. Kara then went off to stop some bank robbers but Mxyzptlk arrived and took their guns away. Then, he quickly had them turn and point to shoot at the robbers and Kara quickly went to save them before they could get shot.

   Alex then came to see her and seemed to be worrying about Maggie and her aversion to celebrating Valentine's Day with her and Kara told her to try surprising her when they saw that Parasite was attacking the city. She and Mon-El rushed to stop him but it was revealed that he was an illusion conjured by Mxyzptlk to try and show off his powers to Kara. Mon-El then angrily told him that he should just say his name backwards and leave Kara alone and she was surprised that was the way to get rid of him. She then sent Mon-El away to try and talk to Mxyzptlk but he told her that unless she agreed to marry him, he would keep unleashing chaos upon National City. Kara then confronted Mon-El about him not telling her about the whole saying the name backwards thing but he told her that he didn't tell her because it never works as it was impossible to get him to say it backwards as Mxyzptlk wasn't stupid and the best way was to kill him. Kara refused to do that and Mon-El lashed out at her accusing her of loving the attention that he was giving her as well as with his power.
  </p>
  <p key="3ea5354c-0111-47b3-8a7d-f7dbcf055410">
   Kara tried to come up with a way to try and get Mxyzptlk to say his name backwards but was starting to think Mon-El was right as she couldn't think of a way to do it. J'onn told her that they found something that might work on beings like him but saw that it was missing and she realized that Mon-El took it. She quickly found the two fighting and arrived just before Mon-El could be shot with a lead bullet. She quickly told Mxyzptlk that she would marry him to the surprise of both men. She told him to meet her at noon in the Fortress of Solitude as she wanted to wear her mother's dress. Mon-El later visited her to find out why Kara was doing this and she told him that the two of them wouldn't work as they were just too different. Mon-El then left her apartment before she left for the fortress. Mxyzptlk arrived but was surprised to see her in her suit and not her mother's dress. She told him that she really brought him here to avoid him hurting people when she told him that she wasn't going to marry him.

   Mxyzptlk became enraged and then animated the ice sculpture of Jor-El to attack her but Kara quickly destroyed it. Mxyzptlk then said that if he wanted to he could send a crack half-way through the Earth and would follow her across the stars until she agreed to marry him. Kara agreed and then went to activate the self-destruct sequence for the fortress which would kill her. Mxyzptlk said that she was bluffing but Kara said she would rather die than let him keep terrorizing the Earth over her. He then begged her not to do it and she then went to show him the override code. He punched it in and stopped the detonation but it was revealed that the code was his name spelled backwards. He realized that she tricked him and was already starting to disappear. He told Kara that all he wanted was for someone to love him but Kara told him that love wasn't control or forcing someone to obey but about finding someone to be free with.

   Later, at her apartment, she called Mon-El to see her and she explained that she didn't mean any of the things she said to him. She just wanted to go through with her plan without Mon-El trying to stop her. She told him that she didn't need him to come to her rescue all the time and that she could take care of herself. Mon-El then admitted that he lost himself when it came to her as she had become his kryptonite.

   Kara asks Mon-El to keep their relationship a secret before going to work at the DEO. Mon-El reneged on their agreement and immediately announced to everyone at the DEO of their relationship. This angered Kara but before she could speak with him about this the DEO intercepted Cadmus movements. Kara and J'onn J'onzz intervened and easily defeated Cadmus forces. As Kara went to inspect their cargo however she was shocked to find her foster father inside.
The rescue of Jeremiah was welcome news for everybody. He shared a tearful reunion with Kara, Alex, Eliza and J'onn. He told them Cadmus saved him so he could augment Hank Henshaw, and forced him to continue working for them afterwards. He also revealed Cadmus has constructed a bomb with which they plan to destroy National City. Mon-El had suspicions however and stated it was more than luck they found him.
  </p>
  <p key="6ef7471f-ae9e-41d8-a1a9-931477903f3d">
   Kara with her family and friends hosted a dinner in celebration of her father's return, however Mon-El soured the event by once again raising the issue of his return being a trick. Kara angrily evicted him from her house, and Jeremiah saw him out, stating on the way that he knew who Mon-El was, and that Kara will not like the secret.
Mon-El would not give up however and tasked Winn with being vigilant. Kara was forced to consider his position when Winn discovered Jeremiah infiltrating DEO systems. She confronted her father about this, to which he admitted and explained he was trying to learn about the time he missed with his daughters. Kara's suspicions enraged Alex, who accused her of not siding with family and being clouded by her new found relationship. Kara by now however has firmly realized something was wrong, reasoning that her father could have simply spoke with them to learn of past events.
  </p>
  <p key="9ab49365-c461-436c-8426-d16f914bb0e8">
   Mon-El was proven correct when DEO seemingly located the bomb. As Kara, Alex and DEO forces converged, they found nothing at the location. In the meantime, Jeremiah had retrieved DEO data, defeated J'onn with his cybernetic enhancements, and rejoined Cadmus. Kara and Alex arrived to confront them, however Cadmus sabotaged a train, forcing Kara to save people. Alex, left alone with her father who refused to surrender alive, could not bring herself to shoot him.
  </p>
  <p key="818dcda1-6f3d-4995-9142-beed77c1f6eb">
   Traumatized by their father's return and betrayal, both sisters grieved at home. However Winn called and informed her Jeremiah had taken the Alien Registry, giving Cadmus information on every alien in America. Putting her grief aside, she jumped to action.
   With Cadmus now in possession of the list, aliens were being abducted around the country. The D.E.O. couldn't track how and where Cadmus was taking them and it was suggested that Jeremiah was helping them stay out of their field of surveillance. J'onn then decreed that Jeremiah Danvers was now a high priority threat to Kara and Alex's discomfort. Kara wanted to try and warn everyone of the danger with an article but Snapper Carr refused to publish it without hard evidence. Kara attempted to get Snapper's help by promising an interview with Supergirl but after speaking to him as her alter-ego, he found that she wasn't a credible enough source as she couldn't reveal anything that tied her to the D.E.O. Later, Alex went to Kara as J'onn had removed her from the case and she asked Kara to talk to J'onn about putting her back on but Kara seemed to believe it was for the best as she was sure that Alex might get blinded by Jeremiah.

   Kara ran into Lena Luthor at Catco who was looking for her as they had made plans. However, Kara told her about how Cadmus had taken the Alien Registry and was now abducting the people on it. She also told her of her trouble of getting the word out to warn people and Lena suggested that she try posting a blog about it to try and reach the masses instantaneously. Lena also offered to look into her mother's activities to see if anything popped up.

  <p key="48fc6755-212b-44ed-a011-62c83bafc41f">
   Kara had written her article but was nervous about posting it as she would be acting against Snapper. Mon-El asked if it was the right decision and Kara believed that it would be the best thing to do in order to try and alert people to Cadmus and so she posted it. She then got a phone call from Lena just as some of Cadmus' men were attacking her. Kara flew over as Supergirl and caught Lena as she fell from the building and handled the men. Lena then quickly told her about finding a warehouse that had been recently billed even though it was meant to be defunct which is where she believed Cadmus had taken everyone.
  </p>
  <p key="b9acd565-078b-43f5-8610-db1832174a74">
   Due to Kara's blog, Lillian Luthor moved to act on her plan sooner to take all the aliens they had gathered and banish them from Earth in a space frigate. Alex managed to find the warehouse as well and convince Jeremiah to help her. She stowed away on the frigate and notified the D.E.O. of the ship and they called Kara to help in keeping the ship from leaving the planet's atmosphere where it would then warp away to the other side of the universe. Kara moved to try and keep the ship from getting to the atmosphere but it was proving a little too much for her to stop. Alex tried to stop the thrusters and managed to shut the power down enough for Kara to stop the frigate.

   When Kara returned to Catco, she was met with an angry Snapper Carr who told Kara that her blog violated her contract. She defended her actions as she had been telling the truth about Cadmus' plot the entire time but Snapper told her that she was only lucky. He informed her that there was a reason why he requested such hard and concrete evidence and sources as one misquote or hole of information could lead to dangerous consequences. He told her that she was fired even though he had been secretly rooting for her. Kara was upset at losing her job and tried to justify that, for now, maybe having her boyfriend and Supergirl was enough.

   A transmission came over television from alien visitors demanding Mon-El be given to them. Kara was willing to protect Mon-El and went to confront the ship but they deployed their weapons against her. When she was fully locked on by the ship, Mon-El quickly sent the ship a message telling them that he would surrender to them and they laid down their weapons. Kara asked why Mon-El was surrendering to them and he told her that he wasn't worth innocent lives. Both Kara and Mon-El were teleported onto the ship. The people immediately bowed and Kara was introduced to Mon-El's parents. She was shocked to learn that his parents were King
   Lar Gand

   They invited Kara to dinner and she and Mon-El learned that the king and queen had received his message though it was incomplete and had been searching the galaxy for him. They had heard about his exploits on Maaldoria and Kara defended their actions of freeing slaves and fighting slavery though Rhea and Lar Gand argued of their support of slavery and that their treatment of their slaves was always decent. When Mon-El's parents wished to know of how he escaped, he tried to dodge the issue but Kara was insistent to learn the truth. He then revealed of how he had been taken by his
   guard
   to the Kryptonian pod that belonged to a Kryptonian emissary. His guard killed the man in anger as Krypton was responsible for the chaos and put Mon-El in the pod to get to safety. Kara then quickly excused herself to go back to Earth and Mon-El followed. Back at the D.E.O. Mon-El tried to explain but Kara was too angry to listen as Mon-El had been lying about who he was to Kara for the entirety of their relationship. She was mad that Mon-El lied about something so big and turned out to be the prince of a planet that was cruel and unjust.

   Kara tried to find distraction in the fact that Winn was having trouble with his girlfriend Lyra, who apparently set him up in a robbery of a painting. She was eager to try and find her but quickly deflected bringing Mon-El when Jimmy suggested it. Alex pulled her aside and told her that she shouldn't be involved in the case when she was dealing with something that was strongly personal and needed to talk to Mon-El. Kara then admitted that she hated him right now and wasn't even sure who he really was. She was conflicted as Daxam was a party planet because the royal family of Daxam made their people that way to distract them from the oppression they wrought and Mon-El was now a part of that. A moment later, Queen Rhea appeared at the D.E.O. to speak with her. Rhea came to thank Kara for watching over her son but Kara knew that the queen didn't come just for that. She then asked for Kara's help in getting Mon-El to return with her and her husband to Daxam. She claimed that she needed Mon-El to rebuild Daxam and be the face of their people's future. Kara wasn't sure Mon-El would listen to her but Rhea said he would because he was under her spell. She also told her that she was starting to resent Mon-El for being Daxamite Royalty and it was the best for him to return because if he stayed on Earth he would only eventually learn that he wasn't good enough for her.

   Mon-El soon went to Kara when he tried to explain himself but Kara quickly told him about his mother's visit. She told him that his parents wanted him to return with them to Daxam but Mon-El refused. Kara told Mon-El to forget about them for the moment and take the time to realize that he was no longer the last Daxamite as he got his people, and his parents, back and not many of them get to have that. She told him that he was the prince so he should start acting like one. Later, Mon-El breaks into Kara's apartment in hopes of repairing their relationship. He apologized and claimed he never wanted to hurt her. When asked if he was ever going to tell Kara the truth he didn't answer. Saddened by this, she called an end to their relationship.

   Unsure of what to do and seeking answers, J'onn and Mon-El travelled to Earth-1 arriving in S.T.A.R. Labs to warn The Flash of the Music Meister. There they met the rest of
   Team Flash
   and they agreed to help try and save Kara. However the Music Meister struck shortly after, and induced the same coma effect on Barry. Kara was singing
   Moon River
   when she quickly found Barry in the crowd. After she was done, she learned that she was on Earth-1 due to J'onn and Mon-El though she quickly told Barry that Mon-El wasn't her boyfriend when he suggested it. They tried to learn more when they ran into
   Cutter Moran

   Grady
   and Pablo who were Winn's and Cisco's counterparts and they realized that they were in some kind of musical world. The Music Meister then appeared and told them that he was in the real world and ready to wreak havoc and if they wanted to stop them, they would need to leave this dream world by following the script of a musical. After performing a number for them, he disappeared and they moved off to let themselves be captured.

   Believing the plot required them to help the two imaginary lovers reveal their romance to their parents, Kara went to help Tommy while Barry helped Millie. While explaining to Cutter that Tommy kept his secret for a justifiable reason, she realized the allegory applies to her own situation with Mon-El. After they got the lovers' parents to apparently accept their romance, Kara and Barry didn't understand why they were yet to be freed. They then remembered that Cutter wanted them to perform something original. The two then went on and practiced
   Super Friend

   , and Kara told him she forgave him. They were brought out of the dream world shortly after. The Music Meister stated he did this to them to teach them a lesson about love and how it just wasn't about saving people but letting themselves be saved sometimes. He then left them with that before he vanished. With her and Mon-El on the path to reconciliation, Kara returned to Earth-38 with him and J'onn.

   A
   new alien
   attacked National City the following morning as Kara and Mon-El were sitting for breakfast. Kara quickly flew in and defeated it easily but the DEO recovered a device on the alien indicating that a bounty of 300 Quartz Crowns had been placed on Kara's life. They all realized with the bounty in place, there would be series of bounty hunters and galactic killers coming to National City to take a shot at it but Kara wasn't worried. J'onn and Alex wanted Kara to lay low, arguing that even though Kara could take care of herself, a lot of damage could be done with bounty hunters attacking one after the other. Eventually, her friends were able to talk her down and she agreed to lie low for 24 hours to try and give them time to find who placed the bounty.
  </p>
  <p key="296135d2-0edd-42f0-9348-ff66a17a40d7">
   Kara had been placed on house arrest with James and Winn though she wanted to head out when she saw trouble on the news though they wouldn't let her. Mon-El then arrived and told them that he questioned his parents to see if they had placed the bounty to convince him to leave, but they denied involvement. Suddenly, Mon-El froze in his movements before he charged for Kara and then started to attack her on a rooftop across from her building. He yelled that he wasn't in control of his body and it was acting by itself. It turned out that a
   telepathic bounty hunter
   was the one controlling Mon-El to attack her. Kara held him off until the bounty hunter was surprised and detained by Winn, pretending a stapler was a weapon. They took him back to the D.E.O. but he told them that he wouldn't talk. J'onn interrogated the new attacker with mind powers, and confirmed the bounty had indeed come from the Daxamites.

  <p key="b4c89677-ffe9-4d55-a24a-5054da35341e">
   While Kara was cleaning the mess from the last attack at her place, Mon-El suggested that the two of them run away together off the world in order to get away from his parents but Kara refused to run. Mon-El knew that Kara would say that but didn't know how to stop his mother. Kara suggested she and Mon-El speak with Rhea, believing that they can convince her to understand that he had made his choice and is happy on Earth. Mon-El was against it but she ultimately convinced him to try. The two met with Rhea in the Fortress of Solitude, and following a cold exchange, Kara attempted to reason with her, saying she believed there was kindness in the Queen. Rhea told Kara that anything that Mon-El found on Earth with her was a lie and it was now over. Kara then started to feel weak and Rhea visually drew two kryptonite daggers and stabbed her. Seeing that his mother is intending to kill Kara, Mon-El agreed to return to Daxam in exchange that she be spared.

  <p key="9ae61510-9317-4b55-87cc-d469cfab1df2">
   Kara returned to the D.E.O. and quickly told Alex and J'onn what had happened. She wanted to rescue Mon-El, but J'onn had orders from the President not to engage the Daxamites for fear of an intergalactic war. She appealed to her friends and was able to convince them to help. Winn repaired the portal from Maaldoria to teleport to the Daxamite ship, and J'onn in the disguise of Kara traveled aboard, defeating Daxamite guards and Rhea as he was immune to kryptonite. Winn rescued Mon-El while the real Kara also arrived when J'onn was getting overwhelmed. Lar Gand fought with J'onn while Kara held off Rhea, but being severely weakened by kryptonite she was at a disadvantage. Before Rhea could fatally strike her, Mon-El broke a ship window and the kryptonite weapons were sucked into space. Seeing no point in further fighting and resigning to his son's wishes, Lar Gand ordered the Daxamites to stand down, much to Rhea's anger. Kara and Mon-El returned to Earth.

   Kara had come to the D.E.O. ready to fight bad guys but J'onn, Alex and Winn told her that everything in the city was quiet right now. They all left to go do their own things and Kara was left wondering what she would do. She went back home and tried to bake danishes but burned them. She was then visited by Lena who asked her to come with her to a presentation being hosted by
   Jack Spheer
   . She told Kara that she and Jack had worked together for years before she moved to National City, and even had dated the final two. However, they broke things off and she was a little nervous about reuniting with him as she felt he was her "kryptonite". Kara agreed to come and report the event for her blog.
  </p>
  <p key="d53c6242-e905-4234-b269-9912eefd3409">
   When they arrived, she had awkwardly run into Snapper Carr. Snapper sarcastically asked what she was doing there as he didn't know that dotcoms counted as a press pass now. Kara told him she was just there with a friend and tried to snidely talk back to him, unsuccessfully. Jack Spheer then came on stage with his company's CFO
   Beth Breen
   and presented his new product: Biomax. He then cut his hand and had the audience watch as his Biomax nanobots move in and heal it. Lena told Kara that she and Jack were working on it for years but it seemed that he had gone on to perfect it. When Spheer called for questions from the audience both she and Snapper were the first ones to stand. She started to ask a question, somewhat hesitantly, which encouraged Snapper to try and cut in on her. However, that seemed to harden Kara's resolve as she then unflinchingly asked if Jack was following the proper health code regulations in introducing the Biomax to National City.
  </p>
  <p key="992bcb15-2e78-4394-9ac6-71b53f1c35e0">
   After the presentation, Jack Spheer approached her and Lena. Lena went on to introduce them while also speaking high praises of Kara's work as a reporter thus embarrassing Kara through and through. Jack calls out Kara for hitting him with a hard hitting question back in the Biomax presentation. On her way out, Kara was pulled aside by a man called
   Joe Watkins
   . He told her that she was the only one he could trust and that he had information on Biomax and if she was interested then she would meet him later that night. Kara went to the lot where she found Joe waiting in his car and went inside. She asked why was he going to her and he explained that she had warned everyone about Cadmus' plot against aliens so he could see that she wanted to do the right thing. He told her that he worked at Spheerical Industries but had been fired when he had found that there was no records of any of the human trials done with the Biomax. He told her that the Biomax wasn't safe to use and that Jack Spheer was releasing it anyway. Before anything else could be said, Kara heard a noise just before the whole car exploded. She escaped relatively unscathed but Joe had been killed.
  </p>
  <p key="c6f1c4b3-33cb-45f7-adb6-f986a71ad3e4">
   She went to James for his and Catco's help in trying to stall the launch of Biomax but Snapper put a stop to it as he reminded Kara that she no longer worked there and couldn't use Catco resources. Kara then excused herself but then overheard Snapper telling James that he had a lead on Biomax and was going to speak with someone that was one of the test subjects.
  </p>
  <p key="d472429c-f766-454f-9b0a-e754015552a1">
   She followed him as Supergirl to the home of
   Derrick Simmons
   and listened in on them. Simmons told Snapper that even though he was listed as a test subject and paid for it, he never actually underwent any tests. Before he could say more, Biomax nanobots came into the apartment and attacked them. Simmons was eaten away by the swarm and it then moved to go for Snapper. Kara burst in and froze the swarm with her freeze breath before she took Snapper away before the swarm could break free. Kara went back to her apartment where Mon-El was waiting and she told him about how the source was just eaten by the nanobots and she had no further leads about Biomax. Mon-El then told her that Jack Spheer was having dinner with Lena and she had called Kara to try and help her get out of it.
  </p>
  <p key="4915fcbb-3dc1-4715-bf18-1c75796ee339">
   Kara then took Mon-El to go and get more information. They arrived at the restaurant to the surprise of both Lena and Jack. Lena whispered to Kara that she didn't need her to intervene after all but Kara just replied back with "that's what friends are for" and tried to ask Jack some more questions. Her interrogation failed and Lena asked if she and Jack could be left alone. Kara understood and moved for Mon-El to leave with her. Mon-El gave Jack a goodbye hug before he left with Kara and he revealed that he had swiped his security card so that they could go into Spheerical.
  </p>
  <p key="d4022690-bac1-4687-b90c-9fe26c7a6d01">
   Kara and Mon-El used the card to go into Jack's office and Kara managed to decrypt his password and get into his files. They found that there were indeed no human test trials but did find a separate file that had a video of Jack using the Biomax on himself. His body had fused with the Biomax nanobots which meant that it was him that had killed both Watkins and Simmons. Kara moved to copy the video before she and Mon-El quickly left the office when they heard the Biomax swarm approaching.
  </p>
  <p key="74df0fb2-b319-4f1f-b465-3c1aac751b4a">
   Kara went to Lena at her office in L-Corp and told her what she had found out about Jack. Lena couldn't believe it until Kara showed her the video of Jack. Lena then asked if she had told anyone about this yet and Kara said she hadn't. Lena then asked to hold off on it until she found out what was going on with him. However, Kara decided to go over to Snapper and deliver the information she had from Watkins. She then told Snapper that he was right to fire her for going over his head and that she had been lucky with Cadmus but had been so caught up with trying to warn people that she disobeyed the rules. Snapper then shared with Kara that after his source had been killed, he did some digging and learned that the one that signed the checks for the human testers was Beth Breen and if Biomax fails then she would lose everything.
  </p>
  <p key="ef3c7332-f74b-4c8e-afff-e37c7059d612">
   With that, she then moved to go to Spheerical where she found that Beth had complete control of Jack and was about to inject Lena with the nanobots to take control of her as well. Beth commanded for Jack to attack Kara and he unleashed himself on her as the Biomax swarm. Lena saw that Kara was in trouble and moved to try and shut down the company's server to deactivate the Biomax, fighting off Beth along the way. She managed to shut the nanobots down but since they had merged fully with Jack, he slowly died in front of both Kara and Lena.
  </p>
  <p key="74ee07ee-4cb6-4a8e-988a-a8a33aa8785c">
   After Beth was arrested, Kara went to Lena to try and comfort her and Lena told her that there was a part of her that was glad that Beth was going to suffer in prison for what happened to Jack. She then wondered if she would end up like the rest of her family as this was how her mother had been like during her brother's trial and Kara told her that she wouldn't. Kara goes on to promise Lena that she will always be her friend and that she will always protect her.
  </p>
  <p key="85c05c37-3423-4e31-b103-b282adc9f7d4">
   Kara then went to visit Snapper and thanked her for not smearing Jack's name as he had been the victim of Beth's greed. She gave him a Danish that she had finished baking and Snapper then gave Kara a copy of the magazine. He told her to look at the byline and she saw that he had credited her alongside him. Snapper told her that Kara's interview with Watkins had been instrumental in Catco scooping its competitors with the story which is why he shared the byline with her. Snapper then told Kara that she was being offered her job back as Kara kept digging and trying to get the story even though two sources were killed. He told her that Catco needed reporters like that and Kara was happy to accept.

   When Kara learned of a bank heist that had hostages involved, she quickly flew and crashed into the building, taking them by surprise. She quickly subdued them and brought them outside to be arrested. She ran into Maggie who was feeling annoyed that she had just charged in and wasted all the time that she was using to try and reason with them. Kara and Mon-El met up with Maggie at Alex's apartment for dinner. Kara believed that she did the right thing in stopping the thieves before they could hurt any of the hostages but Maggie told her that she was being too reckless. She told Kara that while her methods work on super criminals, many normal human criminals that she was catching were starting to use what was called the 'Supergirl Defense' in order to get through trial. She said that her way of charging in with her powers ended up leaving a giant hole in an architectural landmark and she didn't even ask or look to see if she should get involved. Maggie then warned her that she couldn't punch or fly her way out of everything though Kara believed that Maggie was being a sore loser. Kara then left.

  <p key="738566ce-41e8-4b9b-857c-755f91cdc2fa">
   The following day at Catco, Kara ran into Maggie who asked if she'd seen Alex. Kara had believed that she had stayed over with her but Alex had apparently tried to catch up to try and talk to Kara after she left and hasn't been seen since. She also told her that Alex hadn't checked in with the D.E.O. either. Kara then got a call from Alex's phone but when she picked up, a mystery voice answered and told her that he knew she was Supergirl and had Alex. He told her that Alex would die in 36 hours if she didn't break a man named
   Peter Thompson
   out of prison. The two went to the D.E.O. but they were unable to track Alex's location and couldn't find any leads on where Alex could've been taken to or by whom. Kara, Maggie and J'onn went to the prison to visit Peter Thompson to find out if he knew anything. Thompson claimed to not know anything about who would want to have him freed but Kara angrily demanded that he tell them what he knew. J'onn then told Kara to calm down and dismissed Thompson as he had read the man's mind and found that he was telling the truth. Winn then called and found that visitor logs and surveillance footage show that Thompson had a son called
   Rick Malverne
   and he found where he lived. Kara recognized the name as an old classmate of her and Alex from Midvale and quickly flew there. She found surveillance of Alex in full display and quickly found Rick. Kara told him to let Alex go but Rick told her that he wouldn't do that until she broke his father out of prison like he wanted.
  </p>
  <p key="715ad0ba-cd41-40dd-9ab1-730d845f1f35">
   Kara took Rick back to the D.E.O. where he was then interrogated by both Kara and Maggie. Rick revealed that he knew Kara was Supergirl from back in Midvale when she had saved that mother and child from the car crash. He remembered it and Kara from before she wore glasses and when Supergirl showed up in National City, he had put all the pieces together and knew it was her. He told them that he had been watching them and preparing for all of this for a year. Kara asked what had happened to Rick, as she remembered that he was a nice person that had a crush on Alex, and he told her that he really had a rotten childhood with an abusive mother. He then had learned about his father Peter who had then taken him away from Midvale and always did what he could to take care of him and even helped to send him to college. Maggie pointed out to him that Peter killed two people but Rick said they deserved it and if they wanted Alex back then Kara had to free his father within the next 24 hours. He then let them speak to Alex and she told Kara to not do what Rick wanted as Supergirl was bigger than her. When they managed to find where the signal was coming from, Kara quickly moved to get to Alex though Rick told Kara not to go there. Kara then flew over but found that it was a decoy and it triggered a trap that made the holding area where Alex was start to fill with water, cutting her time to only four hours.
  </p>
  <p key="d5e42175-22e4-4534-99be-9b152e527b6c">
   Kara was then approached by J'onn and she told him that she was scared and felt powerless. She then admitted that Maggie had been right and there were things that not even she could punch or fly her way out of. They then noticed that Maggie was gone and she had went off to the prison to free Peter Thompson herself. Kara quickly flew there to stop Maggie and tell her that she couldn't do this. She then tried to reason with Peter and tell him what his son was doing. She told him that despite what he had done, he had been a good father to Rick but if he killed Alex then he would never get back from it. Peter then told the two where he believed that Rick had taken her. They went over there and found that Alex's cell was full of water and Kara quickly went and broke through it to get Alex out.

  <p key="fddd2798-2111-46dc-a217-e88cab54e148">
   They were relieved to find that Alex had used her training to try and buy them more time to find her. Alex was then taken back to the D.E.O. where they learned that J'onn was going to wipe Rick's mind of Supergirl's identity and the D.E.O. Alex agreed and then punched Rick in the face to the amusement of Kara and her friends. Maggie then thanked Kara for stopping her from making a mistake but Kara told Maggie that she merely reminded her of what she had told her before of not always being able to charge in with her powers and that she had been right. Then they shared a hug.

Her actions were seen by James, who was starting to feel unaccomplished as Guardian.

   When Jimmy found the son of the alien from the attack,

They learned that Marcus was a Phorian and could be affected by energy shifts in the atmosphere. Kara remembered that Lena was working on a new energy project and went to call her but was surprised when Rhea picked up the phone.
Kara warns Rhea to not hurt Lena though she explains that Kara hurt her first when she turned her son against her. Rhea then tells her that everything that is about to happen will be her fault before she hangs up on her. When the D.E.O. tracks another energy shift, Kara, J'onn and Mon-El go to the source in order to confront Rhea. The source of the shifts was a transmatter portal that Rhea had tricked Lena into building for her. At first, Kara attacks Rhea but then she moves to try and shut down the portal.

   However, Rhea had rigged it to be self-sustaining and Kara tried to find a way to turn it off. J'onn tried to stop Rhea while Kara went to stop the portal but she used a device that she picked up from the White Martians to render him catatonic and experiencing psychic pain. Nothing Kara did worked and she then saw ships begin to emerge from the portal by the hundreds. They were Daxamite ships and were answering a call from Rhea to help her conquer Earth as she took Mon-El and Lena with her to her flagship.

Kara met up with Winn and James, who had tried fighting some of the Daxamites in the streets. Maggie also found her way to the bar and told all of them that the police had been overwhelmed. Kara guessed that her cousin was on his way, if not already in National City to help them though Maggie said she didn't see him while she was out there. She then saw that J'onn was still out from the device that Rhea had used. They were then visited by Lillian Luthor and the real Hank Henshaw. She took a moment to tell them that her predictions had come true and she wanted to save her daughter from Rhea. They offered an alliance to stop the Daxamites but Kara and the others refused to work with her.

   Winn then picked up a signal from Air Force One that signaled that President Marsdin was on her way to National City. She, Alex and Winn then watched as she and Rhea heatedly negotiated with one another as well as threatened. Kara was then surprised to see that Cat Grant was with the President. When they picked up activity from Rhea's ship, Kara flew off to the plane just moments after Rhea had attacked it. She managed to catch Ms. Grant as she was thrust out though they believed that President Marsdin was lost. The two of them became shocked when they saw her rise from the rubble, in an alien form. She took them back to Al's Dive Bar where Kara learned how Cat had ended up with the President and who Marsdin really was. Marsdin informed them that there was a special cannon at the D.E.O. that could be used to bypass the shields on Rhea's ship and destroy it. Kara told her that they couldn't as Rhea had both Mon-El and Lena with her but the Marsdin told her that it was an order. Kara went off to think about what to do, whether to obey the President or save her friend and boyfriend. She ran into Ms. Grant and told her about her trouble. Cat told her that having loved ones is everything and it wasn't wrong to want to fight to keep her loved ones safe as it gave them all a strong reason to fight. Kara thanked her for the advice and flew off to agree to the alliance with Lillian and Henshaw.

   Lillian's plan was to use a portal that was stored in the Fortress of Solitude to sneak on board the ship and rescue their loved ones before leaving and allowing Alex and Maggie to use the D.E.O.'s positron cannon to destroy her ship. The two of them and Henshaw managed to get onboard and Kara was able to take out any Daxamite guards they ran into. As they looked through the ship, they bumped into both Mon-El and Lena who had escaped and were trying to leave themselves. They then went off to the exit point but only Lillian, Lena and Henshaw had been teleported out of the ship. Kara however had anticipated that Lillian might double cross them so she had Winn place an override chip on Henshaw to take control of him and make him reopen the portal for them. When it did, Kara told Mon-El that she wasn't going as she had to try and reason with Rhea to stop though he tried to tell her that his mother wouldn't listen. Kara told him to leave and they shared one last embrace before he headed back. Kara then went to the throne room and confronted Rhea, telling her that it was now over. However, Rhea wasn't moved or worried as the cannon had been destroyed and she told her she wouldn't sway her to stop. She then revealed that it was she that killed her husband and Mon-El's father so her words were meaningless to her. Kara was then surprised by a sneak attack and looked up to see that it was her cousin.

   Kara was surprised that Clark would attack her but Rhea explained that he doesn't know its her. Her cousin had come earlier to stop Rhea and she had poisoned him with Silver Kryptonite. Now he can only see her as General Zod and hear her pleas to him as his threats to conquer Earth once and for all. Kara and Clark started to battle as she kept trying to find a way to reach him. Their fighting spilled into the streets of National City. Kara was finally able to beat and subdue Clark but the strain of the battle caused her to collapse. They were found by Alex and she took them to the Fortress of Solitude to recuperate. When the Kryptonite was out of Clark's system, he had apologized to Kara but was also awed with the fact that she had defeated him. Kara tried to brush it off as him not being in top form from the Silver Kryptonite but Clark insisted that it didn't weaken his strength at all and he had been fighting as hard as he could. They then went to try to find something in the fortress' archives about the old wars against Daxam and they found a tradition that they felt would give them a chance to stop the invasion.

   They all returned to the D.E.O. to find that they had managed to reclaim it from the Daxamites. Kara learned that J'onn was still unconscious. They then shared what they found in the fortress, the Daxamite right of Dakkum Or but Mon-El quickly said it was a bad idea. When they saw that Rhea was launching another attack, Kara quickly contacted Rhea and issued Dakkum Or, a trial by combat. Should Kara defeat Rhea then she and her army must leave Earth. However, should Rhea beat Kara then she and her invasion will be allowed to commence without their interference. Mon-El tried to talk her out of it, even arguing that her cousin fight in her place against Rhea, but Clark stepped in and told Mon-El that Kara had beaten him which makes her the champion for Earth. She then asked for Clark to help her train for the fight. As they trained, Kara wondered if she really was able to defeat Rhea and Clark argued that she could. Kara then confided that she was scared as she now had everything she could ever want, great friends, a great job and a boyfriend and she was scared of losing it all. Clark told her that those things were the reason that she would win because she had earned them all and wouldn't allow for any of them to be taken away. Kara and Clark then went to see Cat Grant in getting her help to keep bystanders away from Rhea's fight with Supergirl so as not to have anyone get hurt. Ms. Grant also asked if the two of them would help her talk with James as she had learned that he was Guardian and wanted to talk him out of it before he got himself hurt.

   The two of them were then contacted by Lena and Lillian Luthor and asked to come to L-Corp. They arrived to find that the two of them had a device that Lex had been working on. It had been designed originally to disperse a trace quantity of Kryptonite into the atmosphere with the purpose of making the Earth uninhabitable for Kryptonians. Lena had taken and modified it to disperse lead instead so as to make the planet uninhabitable for the Daxamites. However, if it was used then it would expel all Daxamites from the planet, including Mon-El. The two of them returned to the D.E.O. with news of the device and Mon-El told them that if they had to use it, then they will. Kara argued that they wouldn't need to use it if she beat Rhea. Mon-El told Kara that he would go with her when she faced his mother.

   They arrived at the rooftop where they agreed to have the battle and Rhea arrived with her guard. The two of them began their battle but Rhea quickly called for her army to begin attacking the city, violating the rules. Kara told Mon-El to go and protect the city while she stayed to deal with Rhea. Rhea goaded Kara into attacking her which Kara did and it revealed that Rhea had laced her blood with Kryptonite. Kara was weakened and beaten down by Rhea until Mon-El arrived with the switch for Lena's lead device. Kara gave one last look at Mon-El before she activated it, dispersing lead into Earth's atmosphere. The Daxamite army quickly fled along with every Daxamite ship, stranding both Rhea and Mon-El. Rhea quickly succumbed to it and Mon-El left his mother to her fate as Kara had told him about how she had murdered her father. Mon-El was starting to suffer under the effects of the lead as well and Kara quickly brought him to his space pod. Kara then gave Mon-El her mother's necklace for him to remember her by. They shared a tearful goodbye as his condition worsened. Once in pod he was able to safely leave Earth behind.

   Kara was off on the terrace of the D.E.O. where she was joined by Clark who told her that he was going to head back to Metropolis. He told Kara that he was humbled by her selflessness as he didn't think he would be able to do the same had he been in her position. He told her that she was stronger than he could ever hope to be. Later, at Catco, she went to see Cat and confided that for the first time. Cat told her to not give up on herself just as Kara heard that there was an emergency. She then made an excuse to leave and didn't hear Cat call her Supergirl.

   At Winslow Schott Sr.'s funeral, Winn's mother Mary returned to try and reconnect with her son. While there, the coffin exploded, to which Kara quickly changed and protected the attendants from the explosion, taking Mary back to the DEO for protection. When flying monkeys attacked the DEO and tried to kill Mary, Kara helped destroy the monkeys and, in the process, found that large, heavy, melee weapons were effective. When Mary discovered a clue as to who was behind the attacks, she took a gun from the armory to face the culprit and was captured. Kara helped to rescue Mary.

   After the discovery of M'rynn's dementia, M'rynn began to use a Martian process to preserve his memory but the decay and strength of his powers caused psychic bleeds that began to affect another psychic alien, who went on a rampage. M'yrnn was transported to the DEO in hope of protecting others from the bleeds but another happens, affecting many DEO agents, as well as Kara, who lashed out at Mon-El while he trained her on cape tricks.

Kara, Alex, Winn, and J'onn investigated the sickness where Alex and Winn were also infected. Before Winn fell ill, he found a possible culprit but when Kara investigated, she found Imra with the suspect dead. While there, Kara found scratches on her similar to other victims of the illness, making her human. Through further investigation, the DEO found Grace Parker MD to be the worldkiller, Pestilence, and Kara went after her with Mon-El and Imra, who injected Pestilence with a virus that was engineered to kill her before Purity showed up. Imra retrieved the vial with Pestilence's blood which Brainy used to find a cure for the Pestilence virus. The cure saved Alex, Winn, Kara (who was infected in the fight) and everyone else infected.

After revealing her use of Kryptonite, Kara's faith in Lena was broken, to the point that she even requested James to break into L-Corp to see if Lena had more Kryptonite. When the worldkillers brought around an eclipse, Kara had Brainy send her, Lena, and Alex into the Dark Valley. In the valley, the three fought off Kryptonian demons and found Sam and Julia. They helped Sam regain control but this sent Reign into the valley with them. Reign attacked the three and almost killed Lena, but Brainy pulled them out after receiving a signal from Sam. She then flew to the Fortress of Sanctuary with the Legion, Alex, and J'onn to stop the worldkillers.

To protect another target, Sam's mother, Kara, and J'onn headed to Sam's home where they lured Reign in the hope of capturing her but instead, Patricia got killed and the duo discovered that Reign now had the power of all three worldkillers. Lena then approached Kara with her homemade Kryptonite, supercharged to deal with Reign. Later, Kara was seriously angry with her, demanding she turns over Kryptonian elements and the formula. The two squared off about Kara being so afraid of one thing that can kill her while humans are in danger everyday.

   While Lena searched for a cure for Sam, Kara was approached by a member of Coville's cult, who now worshipped Reign, with the Book of Rao that may have information to stop Reign. In the book, she read about Yuda-Kal and the Haren-El and after visiting the cult's deserted HQ, they found what appeared to be a nuclear blast shadow but eventually realized that the cult was trying to make a new worldkiller. Mon-El volunteered to be kidnapped by the cult in order to locate them. Once he sent a signal, Kara flew to the base and found another cult member becoming a worldkiller. She fought her off but was unable to remove the Harun-El as it is toxic to her, causing her heat vision to mis-fire. However, she managed to reverse the process of the worldkiller creation and restored the cult member to normal.

   Kara and Mon-El were shocked to track the rock's radiation signal to a domed city. And not just any city, but Argo City, Kara's hometown. They “borrowed” cloaks from an open-air market to blend in. But Kara wasn't thrilled that she had to be in disguise even there. Mon-El told Kara that he can just be himself in the future, with no secret identity as a Legionnaire, yet it was still exhausting. Then, Kara was overwhelmed to encounter a familiar face: her mother Alura, who was equally gobsmacked that her daughter is still alive.
  </p>
  <p key="84ca4598-ef96-4af2-aeaf-07e56c5df97b">
   Alura explained that they sent away Kara and Kal-El before they knew that the dome would save the city from Krypton's destruction, and since then, Harun-El, the black rock they seek, has made the newly inhospitable atmosphere livable for the Kryptonians in Argo City. As such, giving Kara even the small piece she needs to stop Reign would shorten the moments of breathable air for the people of Argo City, hence requiring the High Council's permission.
  </p>
  <p key="c3d6889b-e75e-49cd-9025-6098ac9beffe">
   While they waited for the Council to assemble, the two women spent time getting to know one another and apologizing for assuming the other hadn't survived. Kara was thrilled to see a Dar-Essa flower, which used to be in her room as a child. She filled Alura in on her adoptive family, the crash of Fort Rozz, and the eventual fate of Astra and Non. Alura identified Fort Rozz as one of her many mistakes.

   Then they're called before the High Council of Argo City, which counted in its membership the dark kryptonian seen in Reign's visions unknown by anyone, where Kara presented her case to the Council. She convinced the Council that humans have similar ideals to Kryptonians and are being affected by the sins of Krypton which included Reign. The Council voted in favour of helping Kara, including Selina, the dark kryptonian. Kara and Mon-El then took the Harun-El back to Earth just as Reign escaped.

   Kara was ordered by president
   Baker
   to reveal her identity as an American citizen due to the demands of the public, so the service of unidentified alien agents would not affect his approval ratings anymore. Kara refused, since it would endanger the lives of her close ones in case her enemies discover this information. In response, Baker fired Kara from the D.E.O.

   After being fired from the D.E.O., Kara took a time off and went to the Kent Farm on Smallville to spend time with Clark and Lois. She talked with Clark over beer, and Clark assured she did the right thing for not revealing her identity, and even though she is no longer a D.E.O. agent, that doesn't mean she can't be Supergirl. Suddenly, she heard ruckus inside the stables, and found her friends from Earth-1, Oliver and Barry, having just ran into Lois. Kara defused the situation by claiming they are friends, and she was shocked, that Oliver and Barry had switched places; Oliver was the Flash and Barry was the Green Arrow. They revealed, that somehow reality on Earth-1 has been altered and that they came to Earth-38 to get confirmation from Kara that that is the case, as Earth-38's reality was still normal. Kara also introduced Clark to Oliver and Barry.

   Kara witnessed with Clark and Lois as Oliver and Barry trained each other, which didn't go so well. Eventually, Kara encouraged them to act like each other. Then, Cisco arrived from Earth-1, and he claimed that Team Flash now believe that reality on Earth-1 is messed up, and that there's trouble in Central City. Kara and Clark agree to join Oliver and Barry in dealing with the problem.

  <p key="71ed14c5-2445-4e8e-9444-7df1848e07b4">
   The problem was an advanced combat robot called
   A.M.A.Z.O.
   , which could copy abilities from meta-humans and even Kryptonians. Kara, together with Clark, Oliver and Barry, knocked it down, but it got back up, and copied their powers. With assistance from Team Flash, they come up with a new plan: Oliver will lure it to Kara and Clark, who will hold it in place, and Oliver can then nullify its ability to phase, and then Barry can disable it with a well placed countermeasure arrow. The plan succeeds and A.M.A.Z.O. is disabled.

   Clark returns to Earth-38, while Kara remains to help out with the reality problem. Cisco then reveals, that he has had vibes about a strange man handing something ominous to another man. He shows the vibe to Kara, Oliver and Barry, and the strange man senses Cisco's presence. He claims they can't stop what's coming and that they should run. While they couldn't ID the men, Oliver speed draws the scenery, and recognizes Wayne Tower within it, meaning their culprits are in
   Gotham City

   Before Kara, Oliver and Barry head to Gotham, they drop at

   Arriving in Gotham, Oliver was skeptical about Batman, even though both Kara and Barry believed he existed (as Kara knew that Bruce Wayne of Earth-38 is frenemies with Clark). Not long after they were arrested by GCPD, as they identified Barry as the Green Arrow. While sitting in a cell, Oliver and Barry still argued while Kara grew frustrated about it. Suddenly, an officer let them out, saying someone had paid their bail. They were then met by a limousine driver, who insisted they come along.

  <p key="5ae017a1-9ecb-48d1-9eab-208d0b6c6609">
   The driver drove them outside Wayne Tower, and they entered. They then met with the proprietor of the building and the one, who got them free,

   Later, Kara went to speak with Kate alone, and mentioned how Bruce Wayne was frenemies with her cousin, and Kate revealed
   Bruce
   is her cousin, who disappeared from Gotham some years ago. This caused Kara and Kate to warm up to each other. Kate agreed to give Kara a laptop in order for the trio to learn what they needed.
  </p>
  <p key="d0639be4-8575-4541-aede-3f545de5e083">
   With the laptop, Oliver learned the identity of the other man in Cisco's vibe;
   John Deegan
   , who was now the head of
   Arkham Asylum
   . As the trio traveled to Arkham, a breach opened and Diggle, Caitlin and Cisco came from it to help them. Taking advantage of Caitlin's split personality Killer Frost, Kara infiltrated the asylum by acting as a nurse, and Caitlin as a new patient. This distracted the personnel in the asylum long enough to allow Oliver, Barry and Diggle to find Deegan. However, Deegan unlocked all the cells in the asylum to unleash all hell inside the asylum, forcing Kara to join in the fight of subduing the inmates. They were assisted by Batwoman, who caught some of the inmates trying to escape.

  <p key="f2336b48-937a-4961-91c1-78e462833985">
   Having managed to apprehend Deegan and gained the
   Book of Destiny
   he had received, Batwoman then insisted that Team Arrow and Team Flash leave Gotham. Before going with others, Kara talked with Batwoman one more time, and with her x-ray vision, she determined that Batwoman is Kate Kane. Kara and Kate bonded in their following conversation, and Kate called them "World's Finest" (a nod to Batman and Superman). Kara then left with the others back to Star City.

  <p key="dd4aeb1b-cecb-4c15-abb1-f2bc508b0db8">
   In this new reality, Deegan has become Superman and the world's hero, Oliver and Barry are criminals called The Trigger Twins and Kara has been locked inside S.T.A.R. Labs pipeline, depowered and watched over by a

   Alex

Kara reveals her Alex once went to Japan with her parents and bonded with a Japanese girl, and they made "a pinky swear", which is what the phrase means. Later, Alex told this to Kara in the same manner. Kara then convinces Alex, that this reality is not real, and she also knows it.

  <p key="2166beb0-0f89-4f23-a159-77050c7ce038">
   Suddenly, the Labs are infiltrated by Oliver, Barry and Clark, and in the chaos, Alex frees Kara, having realized she was right. Kara goes to the "Fortress of Solitude", which is really the Time Vault, where Deegan has stored the Book of Destiny. Kara tries to use the Book, but it overwhelms her. She decides to deliver it to Clark, as he has experience with such books. With Oliver and Barry's help, Clark claims the Book and begins to restore reality, but Deegan interrupts him. Nonetheless, Kara, Oliver and Barry have regained their respective powers. But Deegan is rewriting reality again, and in order to stop him, Barry suggest he and Kara move as fast as they can around the world in opposite directions, in order to slow down time by temporarily stop Earth from rotating, to give them more time to stop Deegan. Oliver and Clark realize they will die, if they do it, but they can't convince them otherwise.

   Kara and Barry go for it, and time starts to slow down, but they will die. But Oliver manages to use a cosmic arrow he received from Mar Novu on the Book, stopping Deegan's rewrite and ensuring Kara and Barry will survive. Kara's friends from Earth-38 join the heroes, and together, they defeat a reconstituted A.M.A.Z.O., and stop Deegan. Clark then restores Earth-1's reality, and Deegan is arrested, his body badly deformed by the power of the Book.

   In S.T.A.R. Labs, Kara and her friends bid farewell to Team Flash and Oliver, and she says to Barry this is becoming an annual thing (referring to previous crossovers). Cisco opens a breach, and calls Kara his favorite Kryptonian, and they return to Earth-38. At the Kent Farm, Clark and Lois reveal to Kara that they are going back to Argo, and Kara realizes Lois is pregnant. They decide to have the baby born in Argo, and Clark leaves Kara as the guardian of Earth.

   Kara continued to act as Supergirl, even though she no longer had the D.E.O. to back her up. When Kara heard a distress coming from a mysterious freighter, she went to the scene. There, she found majority of the crew killed and she was attacked by something invisible. She did manage to ID one of the crew through his dog tags, and witness a silhouette of whatever attacked her. D.E.O. soon arrived at the scene with Alex and Colonel Haley. Haley immediately ordered Supergirl to leave, as this now a D.E.O. investigation, but Kara told her she can't stop her from helping people.
  </p>
  <p key="f14b7f16-54cd-4c9e-a46a-7c3edd8940bc">
   Since Kara couldn't rely on the D.E.O., she turned to J'onn for help, in order to find out, what attacked the ship. As they dug into the matter, Alex informed Kara that Haley had made finding Supergirl's identity as a number one priority. Alex assured, that all those in the D.E.O., who knew Kara's identity, swore to defend her.

  <p key="075a8a96-1643-4c77-848b-0e21de334fe5">
   Kara and J'onn eventually discovered with Alex's assistance, that the ones, who attacked the ship were Morae, an alien race with the ability to completely camouflage themselves, and it's clear that the government have been utilizing this ability. They also learn, that three military officers were leading the project, one of them being the soldier, whom Kara ID'd with the dog tags. The second was General Alphonso Tran, and all three went together to question him.

  <p key="2070f9cd-1cd4-4c70-9573-d3d5dcc33c33">
   At Tran's home, he was already trying to flee from the Morais, and refused to help the three, but Kara and Alex convinced him. He reveals, that years ago the government found three Morais as babies, and when they discovered their camouflage ability, they were trained to become invisible assassins. But the training methods were brutal, as the government used fear in order to control them. Now, those three Morae have broken free to exact revenge on those, who tortured them. Suddenly, they attack, and while Kara, Alex and J'onn manage to fight them off, they nonetheless manage to kill Tran.

   The following evening, Alex calls to Kara, as she has grown resentful towards Colonel Haley, as she is turning the D.E.O. as a weapon for an alien war, and Alex is thinking about leaving. But Kara tells her she must remain, as she is the only one, who can influence Haley. Soon after, the D.E.O. comes under attack by the Morais, as Colonel Haley is the third officer, who were involved in their training. Kara flies to D.E.O. to help, and even though all three Morais are taken out, Haley doesn't thank Kara for saving her. Instead, having a moment ago learned Kara's identity, she tries to blackmail Kara to rejoin the D.E.O. in order to keep her under control, otherwise she will reveal her identity to the world. Alex snaps, and knocks her out cold.

   Kara and Alex panic, and in order to protect Kara's identity, they call J'onn to erase Haley's memory of the knowledge. J'onn is reluctant to do so, but knows that if Kara's identity becomes public, all hell will break loose. J'onn erases Haley's memory.
  </p>
  <p key="482ce125-d2ef-4e74-833e-cda87fde71e1">
   However, J'onn erasure only erased Haley's memory of Supergirl's identity, not her desire to find it out. The next day Alex comes to J'onn's office, and reveals, that Haley had brought in a Vertullarian, also known as "truth-seeker". With it, Haley intended to interrogate every D.E.O. staff about Supergirl's identity. J'onn says there is no evading of a truth-seeker, thus anyone who knows Supergirl's identity will be forced to reveal it. Alex says all those, who know it have agreed to have their memories erased by J'onn. All the agents are brought in and J'onn goes for it. But when Alex says that her memory must be erased too, Kara instantly objects, and she even tries to tell Alex to quit the D.E.O., but Alex has to remain there. Alex tries to comfort devastated Kara by telling, that even though she won't remember Kara is Supergirl, she will still be her sister. As J'onn begins to erase Alex's memory, Kara leaves in grief, unable to watch.

   Although Alex still participated in their regular game nights with Kara, Kara found it uneasy, as Alex no longer remembered some of the things about her sister. In order to clear her head, Kara volunteered to go with Nia to her hometown Parthas to participate in the town's annual Harvest Festival. She even claimed she would drive all the way there, and decided to see, if she could write an article about Naltorians.
  </p>
  <p key="b6ea610b-09dc-42c1-a86e-83fb187f9881">
   During the drive Nia told Kara about her family and about herself. She revealed she is a transwoman, and that her big sister Maeve encouraged her to become a woman. She revealed also that among Naltorians, the daughter of the family will receive the mother's power of dreaming the future. Nia hadn't told her parents, that she had received the power, notably because she was troubled about telling Maeve about it, since she had been training in Naltorian dream interpretation all her life, as she is expecting to receive the power. Now, due to some unknown reason Nia had received the power, and she was worried how Maeve will react. Kara was on Nia's side on this, but found the situation somewhat resembling her current situation with Alex, which was uneasy for her. Also during the drive, Nia fell asleep several times.
  </p>
  <p key="63c89e4f-67e1-4829-801f-2829d80db191">
   When the women arrived in Parthas, they were warmly welcomed by the Nal family. They had a wonderful time, even though Nia was troubled. She prevented her mother putting flowers into a vase, causing everyone to wonder. Later, Kara interviewed Maeve, but it was cut short, when her mother had died, bitten by a spider. Nia confined with Kara, that she had dreamed her mother's death, but cursed herself for being unable to interpret the signs. The Harvest Festival was turned into a memorial. Kara told Nia that she must tell Maeve about the power. Nia intended to tell her after the memorial.

  <p key="637755ea-6027-4a69-9a0d-13330220df81">
   Kara joined with Nia and other Parthas inhabitants with the memorial, when it suddenly came under attack by the Children of Liberty. Quickly donning her Supergirl suit, Kara flew out to put out the flames, when the Children set the place burning. They also came under attack by a drug-enhanced woman. Kara tackled with it, until Alex arrived in the scene with the D.E.O. Alex tried to shoot her, but Kara subtly used her heat vision to disarm Alex. The human was apprehended as she turned back to normal, and the Children were routed. Alex then confronted Kara and threatened to arrest her, if she ever assaults a government agent. This left Kara feeling down, because she felt the sister she loves is no more.
  </p>
  <p key="b119cbff-93e1-4eaf-b2e0-0cf012aad21e">
   As Kara and Nia were leaving for National City, Maeve encountered her sister and angrily talked her down, since she believed there's no way Nia ever should've received the dream power, because she is not even a woman by birth. Nia tried to explain she wanted to find a way to transfer the power to Maeve, but she didn't believe her. Maeve severed her ties with Nia.
  </p>
  <p key="b4c39bcc-b789-4946-b2e3-ca777febb760">
   During the drive back to National City, Nia told Kara about her feelings, how her own sister would talk to her like that after standing behind her with everything, and that she is now alone. She even claimed Kara can't possibly understand any of it. Kara grew agitated, and pulled over, and Nia was baffled. Kara got out from the car, and told Nia she does understand her, probably better than anyone, because she has a similar problem with her own sister. Nia didn't understand, but then Kara took off her glasses and took off into the air, amazing Nia. As she came down, Kara told her she is Supergirl, letting Nia become one of the few, who knew it. Kara told her that despite Maeve disagreeing with her, she can't let that get into her way of doing what is right, and that maybe one day Maeve will come around, just like she believes that Alex will come around. Kara also told Nia she's not alone; she has her to help her. After this Nia became the superheroine Dreamer and friend and ally to Kara.

The clues led them into her secret lab, where they tried to find out any information about Lex. Looking at her computer, which they managed to open by deciphering her password "I Love Lex", disgusting them all, they managed to find experiment information. When Alex found a safe, Kara opened it with her strength, and was shocked to find a piece of pure Harun-El inside. Remembering, how Harun-El caused the ordeal with Reign and the Children of Juru, she angrily accused Lena of lying to her, since she had claimed that she gave up all the Harun-El to Alura, so that it can never be used for bad things on Earth, justifying this as a good reason. Lena defended herself, that she kept a small amount in order to unlock its potential and see, if it can be used to help humanity. Her experiments had bore fruit, as it saved James. Alex defused the argument, and Kara cooled off, and realized that even though Harun-El is dangerous in wrong hands, it can be helpful in the right hands. The women continued in order to find out Eve, eventually discovering she has an aunt with an uncurable cancer. She might have given Harun-El to her, so Kara they went to question her.

   Later, as Kara looked at a news report from the White House, as the voting for the repeal of Alien Amnesty act was about to take place. From it, Kara noticed Eve among the senators, using image inducer. Kara flew to Washington, and hovered above the White House to look for Eve. Eventually, she spotted her in a car nearby, and flew there. Unfortunately, it was just a hologram, and Eve remotely utilized a Lexosuit to hold Kara in place. Kara was helpless, when an

She saved a man from a wrecked car, but, when he saw her face, he panicked and ran. A number of people then tried to assault her, intending to become heroes by taking out the public enemy number one. Unwilling to fight innocents, and seeing that Lex has totally managed to fool everyone, as her pleas went to deaf ears, Kara retreated.

   Inside the prison, the inmates literally cheered Supergirl as a celebrity, but Kara didn't join with it. The warden escorted Kara and Lena to Lex's cell. It seemed just an ordinary cell with nothing weird in it. But Lena knew Lex must have some secrets in here. Eventually, they discovered a number of journals, but they didn't really provide anything useful. Lex's cryptic neighboring inmate provided some cryptic information, but that didn't help either. Later, Lena noticed, that the wall in the cell wasn't an ordinary wall. Using chalk, she discovered Lex had carved an image of mountains from their youth, and it would provide a clue. But then, Otis Graves blasted into the prison to challenge Supergirl. He released all the inmates, and Kara effortlessly beat them in order to find Otis. But just like Lena warned her, he had been outfitted with Metallo-equipment, and Kara found herself fighting a losing battle. Knowing she had to retreat, Kara hid in a library, and without Otis noticing, she quickly donned her civilian outfit and was able to convince Otis Supergirl fled. Otis asked what's a reporter doing here, and she said she came to make an article about the inmates. After Otis left, Lex's neighbor inmate approached Kara, and Kara agreed to interview him later. In Lex's cell, Lena had discovered a hidden lab, but then Kara came and said they need to leave. Lena managed to get some information from the lab.

   Later, Kara returned to the prison to interview the inmate. As the interview proceeds, Kara realizes that in order to stop Lex and clear her name, she has to be Kara Danvers, reporter of CatCo Worldwide Media, and not Supergirl. Kara then hid under her civilian identity.

   Since Kara couldn't act as Supergirl, Nia carried on her mission as Dreamer. Meanwhile, Kara put all her effort in finding the truth about her impostor and her connection to Lex. As she goes through all the sources she has, Kara overhears her colleague Franklin speaking with her sister on the phone. With her super-hearing, she learns that Franklin's sister worked for AmerTek. Piecing this with her information, Kara discovers that AmerTek is somehow involved with Lex. She asks Franklin to have his sister talk with her.

   Franklin's sister, Edna, meets with Kara. She has access to AmerTek files, and agrees, although hesitantly, to get Kara the information she needs. While at the AmerTek facilities, they grab all they can, but the guards are on them. Kara subtly uses her powers to help them escape undetected. Edna refuses to help her any further.

   The information Kara received wasn't much, and she has hit a brick wall. Nia comes to see her, and she is feeling down. She tells Kara, what happened at Al's Dive Bar last night; the Children of Liberty raided it, and even though she was able to drive them away, her actions didn't really inspire hope on the alien refugees sheltered there. Nia is beginning to feel hopeless, but Kara then has an idea of inspiring hope for all the people in National City, human and alien alike. Since Nia is half-human, half-alien, she is live example of how humans and aliens can co-exist in peace. Thus, Kara is going to interview Nia as Dreamer in live broadcast.
  </p>
  <p key="292f240c-bbc2-44b1-801e-09fcf8eec001">
   With Franklin's help, Kara sets up the interview in CatCo. In the interview, Kara asks all the relevant questions, and Nia truthfully tells everything about herself and encourages people to not give in to prejudices and fear of the aliens or unknown. The interview is applauded by aliens throughout the city and D.E.O., but Ben Lockwood is outraged, since Dreamer's example could very well tarnish everything he has been working for. He leads a direct attack to CatCo, falsely intending to arrest Dreamer for provoking unrest. Thanks to Alex, the power to CatCo was cut, allowing Kara and Nia to fight off the Children without Kara exposing herself. The attack was ultimately stopped by James, who angrily told Ben to leave, as he broke the law by assaulting a place of free journalism.

  <p key="a268936c-b6dc-492d-90e4-9d1f10a2e50b">
   The next day, Lena arrives to CatCo, and confesses to Kara her involvement with Lex. Some time ago, Lex came to her for help, since he was dying of cancer. Using her experiments with Harun-El, she was able to cure Lex, but then he and Eve betrayed her. Kara consoles Lena, and together, the two put their heads together to ascertain, what Lex has been up to. With the information Kara received from AmerTek and Lena's knowledge about Lex's way of thinking, they conclude, that Lex has been travelling to Kasnia. Both women decide to go there and learn the truth.

   As the women enter the Kasnian facility, they find several aliens locked up, and conclude they are the same aliens held in the D.E.O. One of them being the one, who could duplicate himself. They suddenly run into Eve, who acts like crazy. They question her, but get nothing real. Eve takes them to Lex's lab, where they discover experiments made with both Harun-El and Kryptonite. Deeper, they find a video feed about Lex's ultimate weapon, the one, who attacked the White House; a clone of Supergirl, code-named
   Red Daughter
   . Kara and Lena realize Red Daughter was born when Kara used Harun-El to defeat Reign. Kara believes something about Supergirl lives in Red Daughter, but Lena claims she is an empty slate, trained to hate Americans and act as the ultimate weapon for Kasnian invasion of United States. Lena realizes Lex's plan; trick the Kasnians to attack America, and he would then stop the invasion himself and be viewed as a hero.

   Taking everything that they can, Kara and Lena are ambushed by Eve, and she is able to replicate herself. Kara and Lena leave, and while escaping, Kara finds Red Daughter's cell, which contains many photos that reveal Kara's identity as Supergirl, and she is horrified Lex knows her secret. Urging Lena to run, Kara stays behind and uses her heat vision to burn the photos. She joins Lena in the plane and they escape. One of the Eve-clones managed to board, but she is defeated.

   Back at United States, Kara goes to Washington D.C. to meet with president Baker. She tells him, that Lex Luthor has been working with Kasnian government to arrange an invasion of the United States, and she also reveals the existence of Red Daughter, who was the true culprit in the White House attack. Baker thanks her of coming to him with this information, and then has his Secret Service agents to bag her and erase her evidence. From this Kara realizes Baker has been working with Lex all along and that he must have known that Red Daughter attacked the White House.

   When Kara got the bag out of her head, she found herself tied up, and watched by Red Daughter. She immediately declared Kara weak for protecting the individual, while she believes in the collective that makes her strong. Kara realized Red Daughter knows nothing of Lex, whom she calls Alex. Kara tells her Lex will betray her after he wins, knowing full well he hates Kryptonians more than anything. She practically begs her to look him up, but she has none of it. Red Daughter opens a case of kryptonite in order to kill Kara, but she didn't count on the fact, that Kara has been fighting it for years, while Red Daughter has only recently been exposed to it, thus Kara has higher resilience to it. Using this to her advantage, Kara tackles both of them out from the building they are in, and manages to fly away.

   Back in National City, Kara goes to D.E.O. to inform Alex and Colonel Haley about Red Daughter, and about Lex's plan. Kara asks Alex not to try to find Red Daughter by herself. Together the three determine, that Red Daughter must have been in National City, since she knew about Kara Danvers. Eventually, they find an apartment. Kara goes there, and Alex follows suit, despite Kara asking her to stay behind. As Kara explores the apartment, she notices it is furnished like her apartment. She also finds pictures about a boy named Mikhail. From this Kara learns why Red Daughter hates Americans; she was fond of the boy, but Lex manipulated her into thinking the Americans killed him, when in truth it was Lex himself (in truth he was never killed). Alex then receives a phone call from her mother, Eliza, who tells her Kara just came by. Kara is instantly alerted and flies to Midvale, with Alex following her.

   Kara enters the Danvers house, and encounters Red Daughter holding Eliza hostage. Kara tries to reason with her, but her blind belief causes her to flip into anger, and she activates her suit. A battle begins between the two Kryptonians, as they charge at each other. At first, Kara has the upper hand, but as the battle goes on, Red Daughter uses her Harun-El-powers to tip the balance in her favor. The night settles, and Alex arrives and witnesses Kara getting pummeled by Red Daughter. With each punch Red Daughter inflicts on Kara, Alex's erased memories of Kara and Supergirl being the one and the same return. Kara eventually falls to the ground, seemingly dead. Red Daughter leaves, when she hears distant sounds, and Alex is overwhelmed with grief with her sister lying dead on the ground. However, she refuses to think Kara is dead, she just needs sunlight to revive. But because it is night, no sunlight. Alex then says that plants have sunlight within them, and she grabs some grass and hands it Kara's palm, but nothing happens. Eliza arrives, and suddenly, sunlight starts to seep from plants towards Kara. The sunlight from the plants converges within her, and revives her. Kara is overjoyed, that Alex remembers her again.

   Lex had transformed Shelley Island into a power plant, where he is using captured aliens as disposable batteries meant to power-up a new Claymore satellite, which is targeting Argo City, all to kill Superman. As Kara, Alex, Brainy and James arrive, they are ambushed by Ben Lockwood and the remaining Children of Liberty, wanting revenge on Lex, since he used them as his pawns and to kill any alien they can find on the island. A battle erupts between them, but they are no match against Superfriends. Suddenly, Lex arrives in his Lexosuit, when he learned that the Claymore was powered down by J'onn and Nia. James urges Kara to take him on, and they start fighting. Lex is amazed Kara is still alive, thinking that Red Daughter killed her. Kara just claims he forgot she is Supergirl. Lex compares her to her cousin, and attacks her with kryptonite, but Kara came prepared and activates Lena's anti-kryptonite suit, allowing her to take on Lex on equal terms. However, due to the suit's limited power reserve, Kara starts to lose. After Lex punches her hard, he attempts to blast her with a lethal kryptonite blast. But then, Red Daughter swoops in between, and takes the blast instead, causing both her and Kara to be blasted through wall. As Kara recovers, she sees Red Daughter dying and crawls to her. With her last breath, Red Daughter apologizes to Kara, that she was right about Lex, and encourages her to protect her people, like she protected hers. Red Daughter then merges with Kara and this gives Kara power boost, which allows her to defeat Lex easily. Seeing that he can't win, Lex tries to escape, but his Lexosuit is damaged. Kara flies after him, and when Lex's suit malfunctions, she pleads with him to let her save him. But due to his pride and disgust, Lex claims he'd rather die than be saved by a Kryptonian. He lets go and falls to the ground exploding, and Kara thinks he's dead. Aliens freed from the plant then begin to cheer for Supergirl for saving the day once again.

   Later, Kara, Nia and James watch news reports about events that happened, after Kara's article was published. In the article Lex's scheme was completely exposed, and because of it, President Baker was removed from office according to 25th Amendment, the new acting president has re-enacted the Alien Amnesty Act and Red Daughter's identity was also revealed, which cleared Supergirl's name. The Children of Liberty were arrested and imprisoned by acts of domestic terrorism. Kara and Nia admit that for a while it seemed the truth won't prevail, but they didn't give up and they won. Later, as Ben Lockwood's son George held a press conference , where he intended to become a voice between human and alien relations, Kara watched over him and smiled at him.

   Later that day, Kara met with Andrea Rojas, the CEO of Obsidian North, at CatCo, and she told her she bought CatCo from Lena, leaving Kara totally shocked. She went to ask Lena about it, and she admitted that she did sell CatCo to Andrea, but she wasn't supposed to reveal it until tomorrow. Lena claimed she did it in order to raise capital to help her. Right then, Kara heard from Brainy that there was trouble at the museum, and she flew there and encountered seemingly alive T-Rex. J'onn came to help, and while they took down the dinosaur, something was stolen from Kal-El's pod. Kara's cape was also shredded.At the D.E.O., Brainy intended to keep tracking on what was stolen and also find a solution for Kara's broken cape. Back at CatCo, Andrea introduced Kara to William Dey, a famous reporter from The Times in London. Kara was at first awed, but when William begun to talk her down by claiming even though her Pulitzer-winning article was good, it was too excessive, and here Kara saw that both William and Andrea were going to change CatCo.

A portal was opened to the Phantom Zone, and an alien called Midnight emerged from it. Kara assumed she was there to get revenge on her due to her mother, Alura, sentencing many crimanals to Phantom Zone, but J'onn said Alura didn't send Midnight there, he did. Midnight attacked and was able to flee after a struggle. But here it became apparent that whoever brought Midnight to Earth was after J'onn.

Kara then went to Lena, and she didn't expect her, but Lena revealed she was going to be the one to introduce her, claiming she deserves it. However, Kara claims she is not worthy of her, and broken to tears, she reveals she is Supergirl. Lena stood quietly, and seemingly shocked, and Kara told her the reasons she lied to her, believing she was protecting Lena, but now she claims she had only hurt her. Lena didn't say anything, just walked away.

Kara takes on Midnight inside a theater alongside Alex, J'onn, James, Nia and Brainy. They overpower Midnight, but as a last gambit, she opens a black hole that sucks J'onn into it.

Together, the team discusses recent events and that Kara cannot use her powers without Rama Khan tracking and killing her with his kryptonite. Lena, retaining her

   While making the suit, Lena tries to apologize and reminisce with Kara about their past friendship, but Kara is far from receptive and tells her that she doesn't want to talk about the past. Lena pushes the issue and Kara explains that it was friendship that caused her to hide her identity; Lena had no idea how harmful her knowing Kara's identity can be to her or Kara. Lena finally understands Kara's reason, and that her feelings of hurt were unjustified; it was all because Lex wanted to turn Lena against her friends.

Supergirl, who flew them there, uses her heat vision to cauterize William's wound; when he asks her about the safety of Kara, Lena answers instead, saying that Kara is alright. Since Supergirl used her powers, Rama Khan arrives, but he is not alone, as he brought Sela and
   Tezumak
   with him. As the others flee, Supergirl fights the three Leviathan operatives and Miss Martian and Dreamer arrive for back-up. Supergirl grows ill as she is poisoned by their kryptonite rings, but Lena has sent the suit and it binds with her costume.

Kara and Zor-El a lot of trash in the old DEO. Kara began to investigate and found images of the past phantom invasion, which made her have memories of the phantom zone.

The Superamgos learned that totems cannot be destroyed. Kara argued with Alex about taking Esme to school to try and disguise herself, but Alex wanted Esme to be accepted. Kara and Alex argued about not having a party to celebrate the proposal.

     Despite loving Kara's parents as a child, since becoming Supergirl, she has learned much more about the individuals they really were, and has become quite disgusted and enraged with them, she learned that
     Alura
     used her as a means to arrest Astra for her crimes which ironically were an attempt to save
     Krypton
     , as Alura was one of the many who refused to accept it's impending fate, this made Kara especially resentful towards her mother, though she soon considered that her mother believed that the alternative of using
     Myriad
     to control the populace was unethical and an action not worth taking, but not to the point of defending her mother's unspeakable actions, she also learned that father,
     Zor-El
     developed the
     Medusa virus
     as a means to kill all lifeforms other than Kryptonians, as a means to defend Krypton from invasion; the more she learns about her parents' true natures, the more Kara feels ashamed of being their daughter, Kara eventually forgave her mother, after realizing that she repented her inaction, she also ultimately forgave her father after learning of his sacrifice to ensure Krypton could still exist. When Argo was destroyed, Kara was devastated by her mother's death, showing how she had buried the hatchet with her.

Despite her affection, she had no blind spot for her adopted father, because her biological parents had betrayed her in the past; as she became suspicious of Jeremiah after

     On this last point, Kara generally follows a strict "no-killing" rule which has led to some friction with allies who feel deadly force is necessary, such as opposing
     Imra Ardeen
     intent to kill the Worldkillers, however, she has been willing to take lives in extreme circumstances; for example, she gave
     Parasite
     one more chance to stand down and give up, but he was too far gone and after seeing how dangerous he was, and not having the means to contain him, she had to overload him with so much energy that it destroyed him, another example is when
     Rhea
     broke her promise to leave the planet and began to destroy
     National City
     , kill the population and threatened to annihilate the rest of the planet, with Mon-El's blessing, she turned on Lex's device filling the Earth's atmosphere with lead which made it impossible for all Daximites to be able to survive on
     Earth
     . This killed Rhea and forced her to bring Mon-El, the person whom she was in love with, back to his pod that brought him to Earth and leave the planet, seemingly forever with her mother's necklace to keep him safe wherever he went.

    <p key="748f71ef-eb15-493c-9451-3abf0b885850">
     After Kara sent Mon-El away during the Daxamite invasion, she became sheltered and distracted, as she was delving into her Supergirl persona, this created a riff in her personal relationships and she started to fall behind her in her job and relationships, Kara has also given up on the idea of finding love and her perfect partner, as she believes that since she isn't human she is above those emotions. But after a while she began to get over Mon-El and return to her old happy-self again.
     Despite this, Kara has also accepts the fact that she is a Kryptonian and never will be human.

     Additionally, Kara is accepting of people, as seen when she accepted her adoptive sister for being a lesbian, she later accepted the fact that Mon-El is married to
     Imra Ardeen
     and the two will possibly never be together again. She also continued to be kind to Imra despite her pain.

     Kara keeps her civilian identity a secret from the public (knowing that if her identity is known to the public, it would put both her family and friends' lives in danger from her enemies) after

     United States

Also, she can quickly regain her full power by small sun radiation like during nighttime on Maldoria and even in Master Jailer's prison despite powerful red sun radiation, just a small amount of yellow sun radiation makes her godly powerful despite presence of red sun radiation.

    taught Kara how to use the cape as a defensive weapon in hand-to-hand combat. Mon-El stated that Kara’s cape was studied to create his own and that it was made of a Kryptonian meta-material which he also called smart cloth. This suit also bears the glyph of the great house of El appearing as an S at the center of a heart-like shape meaning
