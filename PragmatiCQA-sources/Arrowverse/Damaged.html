   In the courtroom for his bail hearing, Oliver insists on representing himself and assures
   Judge Moss
   that he's innocent. However, The DA,
   Kate Spencer
   , moves that bail be refused, as Oliver could escape during this time. Laurel comes in, objects, suggests that Oliver be tagged with a GPS bracelet, confined to his home. As Oliver starts to object, the judge agrees and assigns bail. As the spectators leave the courtroom, Oliver thanks Laurel for coming to his help, and she says that they both know he couldn't be the vigilante because The Hood is trying to make a difference, which isn't Oliver's style.

Her father doesn't believe it, insisting that even the evidence is solid, but Laurel tells him that Oliver wasn't the one who killed Sara or drove off Quentin's wife. As Quentin storms out, Laurel tells him that he's not the only one who misses them.

John points out that Oliver is putting his family through hell, but Oliver insists that the mission comes first. He shows John an Internet article on

Kate explains that Quentin bypassed her office when he arrested Oliver, and that she's willing to let Oliver make an insanity plea. Oliver refuses, insisting that he's sane, and says that he'll undergo a polygraph test. It isn't admissible in court, but he'll do it in front of Quentin to convince the sergeant that he's innocent. Laurel talks to him privately and says that he should take Kate's deal. All Oliver will agree to is to accept the deal if he fails the polygraph test. Laurel is satisfied for the moment, but warns him that he's not the only one with something to lose.

   Edward Fyers

However, Edward says that they'll get to that and shows him a photograph of Yao Fei in a military uniform. He asks Oliver if he's seen the man and Oliver claims that he hasn't. Edward isn't convinced and says that Oliver should think on how he's going to suffer as he calls in his acquaintance, a man in a black and yellow mask.

John has Leo's current location from the transponders and Oliver says that The Hood will stop him, but not Oliver. John realizes that Oliver set the whole thing up so that he'd have a perfect alibi while John dons the costume and goes after Leo. Oliver admits that he wasn't expecting John to have to stop an arms deal and John says that he's okay with the risk. What he doesn't like is Oliver lying to him, so Oliver apologizes. John tells him that he'll stop the deal.

Oliver says that he understands why Quentin is angry and that Quentin has every right. Laurel interrupts, telling Oliver that after Sara died, Quentin threw himself into his work and drove
   his wife
   away. Since then, Laurel has been so focused on her family that she didn't realize what Oliver went through. She asks to see his scars and Oliver opens his chest to reveal them. He tells her that there were times when he wanted to die but that the fact that he wanted something more kept him alive. They start to kiss but then Laurel pulls away and runs out.

When Oliver comes out, he realizes that the waiter has a gun and is going to kill him. They struggle and Quentin arrives just in time to shoot the killer dead. Quentin takes Oliver downstairs to meet with Moira and Walter. Moira, realizing the killer works for Malcolm, makes the best of the situation by suggesting that Quentin accusing Oliver of being The Hood made him a target for criminals. Quentin gets a call from the station and removes the GPS bracelet from Oliver's ankle. He explains that multiple witnesses placed The Hood across town busting up a street gang and he's been told that all charges against Oliver have been dropped.

   Laurel comes to see Oliver and tells him that she studied the polygraph results. She realized that Oliver lied when he said that he hadn't been to Iron Heights Prison, because they visited it together on a field trip in the eighth grade. She figures that he might have forgot until she looked at the readings and realized there were several suspicious flutters. Laurel wonders what else he lied about and Oliver says that he doesn't like to talk about what happened on the island because people would consider him damaged. He claims that since returning he can't sleep, barely eats, and can't sign his name much less use a bow and arrow. After a moment, Laurel says that they're clearly attracted to each other but that nothing can happen between them. Oliver agrees and Laurel gives him the polygraph results as she leaves.
