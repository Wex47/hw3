   At the age of 11, the boy who would become Ra's al Ghul killed a man for the first time because the man intended to harm his family. He felt ashamed that he had taken the life of a person, but also proud because he stood up to someone with ill intent who threatened his family. The boy justified what he had done as necessary by claiming he had "replaced evil with death".

  <p key="8c719d65-8d8e-4929-a7ea-d5b00d2df8f1">
   At some point, he was approached by the leader of the

   The man went on to live a blissful life, having two children with his wife. One day,

   This man was conscripted to the League and underwent a brutal training process to cleanse his mind of his past life until he believed himself to have been reborn into something else, and was to eventually ascend to the mantle of Ra's al Ghul himself. He was conscripted with a man named
   <a href="Damien Darhk.html" key="ee334930-6910-4923-a47e-62a6ab47d557" title="Damien Darhk">

   who underwent a similar training process with this man, and both became best friends and the horsemen of Ra's al Ghul. However Damien believed himself to be the better warrior and true heir to Ra's mantle, but this man was chosen instead. In order to eliminate any threats to his reign, this man was instructed by Ra's to kill Damien, but this man hesitated because of their friendship. With this distraction, Damien was able to flee with his followers, taking samples of the Lazarus Pit with him.

   Damien would go on to continue the League's ways but through his own agenda in an organization called
   H.I.V.E.
   . However, their motives dishonored the League's ways and resulted in many unnecessary civilian deaths, which left a heavy burden on this man's consciousness and since his hesitation led to those deaths.

  <p key="614435cc-cd48-42c6-b2c8-96949f181045">
   Eventually, this man was obligated by Ra's to initiate the final act of ascension, which called for the destruction of his homeland, the cleansing, and end of his former life entirely. This resulted in the deaths of everyone he ever knew including, presumably, his family. Following this, he ascended to Ra's al Ghul himself and took the name, following the death of his predecessor.

   In 1854, Ra's happened upon an illusionist in Vienna and was mystified with his tricks. Nearly half a century later, he came across the man again, but the man was withered and old.
   Around 1947, someone challenged Ra's to a trial by combat, to the death, with Ra's coming out victorious.

Ra's informed his daughter that Malcolm would face consequences for crimes against the League's code. Ra's asked about Oliver Queen, and he learned of Oliver's oath to protect Malcolm at any cost.

   With Sara Lance's death unavenged, Ra's sent a squad of assassins, led by Nyssa and
   Sarab

After the time was up, Ra's and various League members traveled to Starling City in preparation. However, Oliver met with them, falsely claiming to have killed Sara upon her request, which Ra's did not fall for. By League law, he was entitled to a trial by combat, and so Ra's accepted the duel, allowing Sarab to tell Oliver of the neutral meeting place.

   The two met atop a mountain sometime later. Following tradition, they both removed their shirts, and Oliver picked up two swords against Ra's who was bare-handed. The latter discussed his first kill at age 11, feeling proud that he had replaced evil with death, which was what the League strived to do. They began fighting, with Ra's swiftly proving his skill greatly exceeded Oliver's by easily dodging each attack with his hands behind his back and swiftly retaliating,

As Ra's continued to easily overwhelm Oliver, he soon held him at sword point in the neck and led him back to the edge of the mountain, commenting on how impressed he was that he had lasted longer than most. Although Oliver was given a chance to steal back the blade, Ra's quickly caught the blade as Oliver stabbed at him, disarming him once again. He promptly stabbed Oliver in the chest, saying a quick prayer before pushing the dying Oliver over the edge, and tossing the sword to the ground as a grave for Oliver.

   Ra's was confronted by his daughter, Nyssa who had just discovered Oliver survived and demanded Oliver be killed. Ra's revealed that he knew that Oliver did not kill Sara and commented he had always knew and was correct that loving Sara would only cause her pain and heartbreak and watched. After the League captured Malcolm and brought him to Ra's, Ra's mused that he had met a dazzling magician in Vienna whose power was magnificent but only half a century later, the magician was broken and dying of old age and that just like this magician, Malcolm may be able to cheat many things but he cannot cheat death. As Malcolm begged Ra's mercy, promising to work for him once more, Ra's told Malcolm to face his death with honor or at least dignity and ignoring Malcolm's continued pleas, stated that his crimes can only be paid by agony and blood but stated he took no joy in killing him. Ra's would then torture Malcolm to the point he was barely conscious but left his cell unguarded to lure Oliver, who he knew would come. When Oliver made an attempt to rescue Malcolm, Ra's locked Oliver in, along with Diggle. Later, Ra's had Oliver brought to him and commented on how he had once nearly lost his life to Ra's and still came straight to him to challenge him as if he wanted to actually die and stated that even he would die in the end. As Oliver begged Ra's only for Diggle's live, Ra's, only further impressed, commented on how tremendous Oliver's strength, fortitude and power is, revealed he had no intentions to kill him and asked if Oliver was willing to be his successor as Ra's al Ghul.

   As Ra's continued to explain why Oliver should take his place, Oliver denied the request, and Ra's allowed Oliver to leave with Diggle and Malcolm. Sometime after their departure, Nyssa returned to the palace only to berate on why Malcolm was still alive. Ra's explained that Nyssa had only wanted Malcolm dead in revenge of Sara's death and that he had let them go as a sign of good faith to Oliver who will become his heir. Nyssa got enraged by his decision to make Oliver his heir and tried to kill him after which he easily disarmed her. Ra's puts Nyssa off, saying that Oliver surviving a fair duel with him merits the vigilante the right to take her father's place; and he never did approve and will never approve of the feelings of his daughter.

   After a failed escape attempt by Felicity, Malcolm, and Diggle, Ra's asked Oliver who assisted them, though Sarab quickly came clean and revealed he killed three of the league members. Ra's told Sarab he won't punish him for Maseo's actions and spared him for his loyalty. Ra's went on to mark Oliver with a mark and started to cleanse Oliver of his personality so all that remained was Al Sah-him.

   The next weeks Ra's personally trained Oliver and helped him improve his swordsmanship and combat skills. He used isolation and brainwashing techniques to make Oliver forget about his past and he began to accept his new identity and name. Exposing him to a herb Oliver started to hallucinate and believed a captured intruder was, in fact, his friend

   H.I.V.E.
   Ra's explained to Oliver how Damien had attempted to buy the earthquake device and was responsible for multiple crimes. This was a direct result of Ra's having doubted in killing him. Ra's then told Oliver he does not want this for Oliver so he ordered Oliver to take out his rival for the title Heir of the Demon.

   After Oliver captured Nyssa and brought her to Ra's, he complimented Oliver. He recalled how Nyssa used to steal food when she was young, but that she had never been able to hide things from her. He searched Nyssa her weapons and found the Omega virus. Ra's told her he would remember her as the warrior she once was, Nyssa replied that she was not afraid of him. Ra's ordered Oliver to kill her but stopped him at the last second. He mentioned Nyssa had been defeated by Oliver and was no longer a threat. He told both of them they would marry and Nyssa would become the bride of the demon.

  <p key="e47d2bcd-dec4-4e07-9795-d3f66c66d813">
   Ra's explained to Oliver that the ruined village he had shown him was his former home. He mentioned that to become the new head of the demon one had to wipe out his former home. Just like he had did and the former Ra's before him had whipped out Alexandria. Ra's explained that he would unleash the Omega Virus on Starling City. Ra's recalled how Maseo had come to him and offered him the Alpha-Omega Virus when he wanted to join him. Maseo reported a plane had been readied to spread the virus.

   Ra's, Oliver, Nyssa and a squad of assassins departed on a plane. Oliver woke up and Ra's told him there are dreams of desire, temptation, and truth. Oliver explained that he dreamed of rebirth as Head of the Demon. Ra's told him they would destroy Starling and then he would get the ring that would allow him to command the League. The plane started to shake and the pilot told them the plane had been sabotaged. Enraged Ra's blamed Nyssa. Oliver told him it was his doing. Oliver handed Nyssa a sword and she started to fight the assassins. Ra's mentioned to Oliver he had given him his holy mission. Oliver told him he had one already. The two fought and Ra's managed to knock down Oliver. Nyssa killed his assassins but Ra's subdued her and Oliver and promised them he would destroy the city and then hunt them forever. He then escaped from the crashing plane by parachute.

   Ra's tracked down his rival Damien Darhk to a hotel in Starling. However, he had already escaped, and Ra's noticed Oliver and his team closing in on his assistant. Ra's called the assistant and then shot him. He taunted Oliver and told him he would spread the virus and destroy the city.

   Ra's then send a messenger to Oliver to tell him he would meet him so they could have a duel to finish this. Ra's met Oliver and mentioned how he would win either way. If Oliver would kill him he would become the Head of the Demon and if he would win his city would die. Ra's saw that Oliver used the sword he had been impaled with. Ra's and Oliver engaged each other in a sword fight. In spite of Oliver's considerable improvement from his training, Ra's kept the upper hand the entire fight and ended up taking Oliver down and destroying his sword in one strike. Ra's mentioned that thousands of men would mourn his death if he would die. He then attempted to strike down Oliver. Oliver disarmed him with the same move Ra's had used in their first battle and ended up impaling his chest, while refuting Ra's earlier claim, stating that his men would simply kneel before the next Ra's al Ghul. Oliver then recited the same prayer Ra's did after he had stabbed him. Proud of his student's success, Ra's handed him the ring before collapsing to the ground, dead.

   In Ra's' later years, he had a cold and stoic demeanor, he was ruthless, as he would not hesitate to kill his enemies, he was also known to be relentless, unflappable, impatient refusing to impose his will after he speaks once and undeterred, allowing nothing (the lives of multiple innocents, anyone) to stand in the way of his goals of ensuring the purpose of the League of Assassins lives on, as a result of being the Demon's Head and having access to the
   Lazarus Pit
   for years. Astute and calculating, Ra's was an effective leader, having commanded the League for at least a century and a half, and lead, inspired and fashioned some of the greatest killers in all of history. Ra's himself said, that he feels pride for the thousands of people he had killed by his hand, genuinely believing he created a better world with these men dead. Nyssa mentioned the Lazarus Pit twisted Ra's mind, turning him into a ruthless monster.

  <p key="0489dc50-677d-4327-8ebc-1f8f24dd051d">
   Despite Ra's' ruthlessness and zealotry, he had a sense of honor, somewhat of a soft side and (if twisted) a sense of humanity. He was capable of respecting his opponents and even holding them in honor, as seen in his commending

Even despite all that he had done to him and his loved ones, Oliver still acknowledged and respected Ra's honorable side enough that he noted that Ra's would have been ashamed of his daughter, Talia, working for the profoundly psychopathic Adrian Chase. Even Thea, who had personally been killed by Ra's, had to acknowledge Ra's had honorable qualities even if he was ultimately unredeemable.

   </a>
   , saying he never saw Sara as a true member of the League of Assassins. Despite this, he seemed to have had some respect for their love, Ra's stated his reason for not seeing Sara as a true member of the League was because he knew she wasn't suited to kill people with her life and did not approve her relationship with Nyssa because he (correctly) believed it would end in Nyssa's heartbreak, his ruthless punishment of Malcolm was only out of obligation to the League's code, claiming he'd take no pleasure in making Malcolm suffer. He also released Malcolm from his obligations from the League under unknown circumstances on the condition Malcolm would honor the League's code of honor. He also spared Maseo for betraying him momentarily, respecting Maseo's past connection to Oliver.

   Despite Ra's' generally calm, composed, dark and stoic demeanor, he was capable of being surprised; as when he first looked upon Oliver's youthfulness, the only thing he could say at the moment was "you're just a boy", he was also prone to fits of rage and fury if someone were to betray him or display defiance towards him. He disinherited, exiled Nyssa over her outburst towards his selecting Oliver in being his heir instead of her and upon her attempt to slay him in petty vengeance. He lost his temper when Oliver revealed his duplicity in pretending to be his heir in an to attempt to dismantle the League from within.

  <p key="4a09c44a-7e96-413b-8eaf-5d0b7cad5a10">
   Ra's was intelligent, calculating, strategic and empathic towards others having led the League effectively for over a hundred years, Ra's knew the moment he had captured Malcolm, that Oliver would come and try to rescue his sister's father, actually planning to use this to request Oliver to succeed him, he let Oliver, Malcolm and Diggle go while predicting coming events for Oliver to make him overthink his offer, in Malcolm's words, Ra's doesn't make requests for people to do things he wishes, but rather he orders. This was shown when he started killing people in Starling City with the Arrow's tools to frame him to make the "request" to be Ra's al Ghul more appealing.
  </p>
  <p key="7577f4b9-1aa3-4841-8805-5989432812ae">
   After Oliver "accepted" the offer to succeed him, Ra's focused solely on grooming Oliver to become the next Ra's al Ghul. He cared little for his own daughter at that point, even forcing her to marry and bare the child of a man she does not love and even threatened to torture her if she refused, only seeing her as a means to extend his and his son-in-law's bloodline.
  </p>
  <p key="42e1bc44-7a22-4262-bcb7-e08621411de8">
   In Ra's' final moments, before succumbing to his fatal injuries inflicted on him by Oliver, he displayed no guilt, morals nor remorse for his actions, being only pleased that he made the right choice, by choosing Oliver to become his successor, and he died somber with honor and dignity.

    , in terms of strength. Ra's even crushed Oliver's windpipe with a single blow and then casually kicked him off a cliff before leaving a sword deeply impaled in the rocky terrain after having defeated Oliver.
    Ra's later on managed to outpace Oliver to the
    Alpha
    and
    Omega
    despite Oliver being closer to the two viruses and stun him with only two blows, along with later on knocking down Nyssa with a similar amount of effort. Additionally, Ra's did not immediately die after being repeatedly fatally stabbed by Oliver, still having enough strength to declare Oliver as his successor and pass on the
    Demon's Head ring
    before ultimately succumbing to his wounds.

    for more than a century with success since he accepted the offer of becoming its next leader. His extended lifespan enabled him to gain the wisdom of the ages and he is able to recognize and predict the actions of others, including their mindsets; Ra's was able to predict the future adversities (which he later helped to orchestrate) of Oliver and used this while attempting to convince the latter to succeed him. Ra's later performed killings dressed as the Arrow to frame Oliver and make

Ra's had undergone the same training like most League members do, but since he was chosen as the successor to the
    Demon's Head
    , his combat skills far surpassed that of most other assassins of the League since he had received the highest level of training any member could. His fighting style seems to be comprised of Kali, Krav Maga, Taekwondo, Karate, Kung Fu, Jeet Kun Do, Hapkido, Judo, Jujitsu, Panantukan, Muay Thai, Aikido, and Silat. During his leadership tenure, Ra's al Ghul's combat abilities were unmatched by anyone in or out of the League, save for

    stated he would rather flee than face Ra's. In their first duel, Ra's managed to overpower and disarm Oliver while the latter had two swords and the former had none while holding both hands behind his back with ease. Ra's easily countered any bare-handed moves Oliver made and repeatedly hit and knocked his opponent down when they dueled with swords. Even after Oliver surprised and disarmed him, Ra's regained a sword with his bare hands, easily catching Oliver's sword strike before landing a blow to the latter's windpipe that stunned him. Ra's also effortlessly blocked each and every single one of Thea's attacks with a single hand, swiftly overpowering and restraining her. Even after Oliver had greatly improved his skills after being trained by Ra's himself, Ra's still proved to be superior to him in skill, as he was able to defeat Oliver in their final encounters, knocking him out in their altercation on a plane and nearly killing him in their final duel on the bridge, with Oliver only winning through surprise attacks. Since Ra's would've won either way, it is unknown if he let Oliver kill him, to force the latter to become his successor. He also displayed superb improvisation skills, able to use the Alpha and Omega container to easily overpower Nyssa wielding a sword. At one point in Ra's life, he seemingly got into a direct confrontation with
    Batman
    , but he was ultimately bested by the Dark Knight.

Ra's also quickly outmatched Oliver in their first duel without much effort, with Oliver barely able to block any of Ra's attacks. Ra's once managed to slice Oliver's hand, only being disarmed after being surprised, and quickly stabbed Oliver in the mid-section after regaining a sword. Even after Oliver had improved his sword skills greatly due to having received training personally from Ra's himself, Ra's proved capable of going toe-to-toe with Oliver and ultimately managed to destroy his sword.
