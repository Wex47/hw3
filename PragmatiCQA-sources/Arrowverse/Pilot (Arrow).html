   in the Pacific Ocean, Oliver Queen notices a fishing boat in the area. He runs to the camp, picks up the bow and shoots a flaming arrow at a previously prepared pile on the coast, which ignites. Fishermen see a fire and guess that someone is on the island. On the beach, they see an overgrown man in green clothes kneeling in front of them. The men take the stranger to the ship and leave the island. Each channel announces the return to Starling City of the famous millionaire -

   , son of Robert Queen. The two went on a journey five years ago on the Queen's Gambit yacht, which sank in a storm. The media describes him as a "bad boy" who has been arrested more than once and also accused of assaulting the paparazzi. Oliver is rushed to the hospital and examined by Dr. Lamb, who noticed his body was completely burned and scarred. After a while, the boy's mother arrives and learns from the doctor that the son may not be the same as before - five years ago. As soon as the boy notices the woman, he walks over to her and hugs her. The next day, Moira takes Oliver home. The man does not allow the porter to take the wooden crate from the car as it is too valuable for him. Upon entering, Oliver is greeted by her father's former business partner, Walter Steele. Queen barely remembers him, but notices a family housewife whom she orders to greet the family. Suddenly, the boy's younger sister, Thea, runs down the stairs and hugs her brother and says she always knew he was alive.

   Meanwhile, Laurel and her friend are investigating the case of businessman Adam Hunt at the legal aid office. While Lance ponders the work, other office workers focus on the television, where journalists report on the return of Oliver, who is the only survivor. They consider the ship's crew Robert Queen and Sarah Lance dead. When the young lawyer notices the crowd, nervous, she turns off the TV and leaves. At the Queen mansion, Oliver stands in his room in front of the mirror, contemplating the past as he peers at his scars. The Queen's Gambit is sailing in the Pacific Ocean during a powerful storm. One of the crew members informs Robert that the captain intends to divert the ship, but the millionaire orders him to continue. Suddenly, Oliver and Sara leave their cabin, looking for a boyfriend. Robert warns his son that it will not end well for him and the Lance family. At dinner tonight,

   promises to show Oliver about everything that has changed in his absence. The young millionaire is going to see his father's company, Queen Consolidated. Walter suggests that there is no rush to visit her, as she will have time to do it more than once. When Raisa hardly capsized while carrying the food, Oliver responds to her apology in Russian, much to the surprise of the others. Queen mentions that he also did not know that his father's ex-friend was sleeping with his mother. Moira decides to say that she married Walter to keep the company as they believed Oliver had died. At night, during a thunderstorm, the survivor was sleeping with the window open.

   In one of the cabins, a frightened
   Sara Lance
   counts down the seconds between the flash and the thunder, but Oliver calms her down. They kiss, and she cuts them off and claims Laurel will kill them once she finds out they are together. Queen tries to assure her that she will never know about them. Unexpectedly, the ship begins to tilt to one side, creating a large hole in the hull. They all fall into the water, and Oliver struggles to find Sarah. Suddenly, a crew member and his father take him on a life raft. Moira enters Oliver's room to see what is happening. The boy instinctively lunges at his mother and grabs her by the neck. He lets go of her and apologizes the moment he notices Walter. The scared woman says nothing has happened and is glad to be home. The next day, Queen opens a wooden chest from which he takes a small journal. Then he goes to his sister, who hides drugs with her friend. The boy gives Thea a Buddhist symbol of hope, explaining that he was hoping to return to her. The sibling's conversation is interrupted by Tommy, who takes his friend to town. Along the way, he explains that the funeral sucked and plans to throw a big party in honor of his return. The car stops for a moment at an old factory that Robert sold a few years ago. When Tommy asks Oliver what he missed the most on the island, the millionaire replies - Laurel.

   Laurel tells Joanna that Adam Hunt asked to replace the judge he bribed. The conversation is interrupted by Oliver, who apologizes for Sarah's death and takes all the blame on himself. She doesn't want to blame Laurel, who brought about a relationship with her sister. The nervous woman informs him that it would be better if he died, not Sarah. After a frustrating conversation, Queen and her friend return to the car when they are attacked by several men who are attacked. Criminals put both millionaires to sleep, but Oliver tries to defend himself with the last of his strength. Eventually it falls to the ground and they are both taken to an unknown location. On a lifeboat, Robert gives Oliver something to drink to keep him strong. The crew member is upset because that should be enough for all of them. The old man informs the employee that his son is the only one who will survive the catastrophe. The young man is not entirely sure if he can survive. One of the masked hijackers wakes Oliver and asks if Robert died in the crash. Queen does not respond and is electrocuted by a stun gun. Criminals ask if his father told him anything before he died. The boy, seeing his unconscious friend next to him, says that Robert told him that he would kill them. The criminals laugh and emphasize the millionaire's plight, but Oliver breaks free and attacks his enemies. Two of them are killed in the warehouse, and the third, seeing this, starts to run away. After checking if Tommy is alive, Oliver starts chasing the man. The chase ends outside the building when the millionaire's son has to kill him, as he has learned its secret.

   Sometime later at the Queen's mansion, police question kidnapped millionaires. Detective Lance and Detective Hilton hear from Queen that they were saved by the man in the green hoodie. Tommy cannot confirm this as he was unconscious. Quentin asks Oliver a difficult question, which upsets Moira. Walter calms the situation down and orders the police to leave the apartment. He adds that Oliver will report in when he remembers something more. Oliver searches for information on Adam Hunt and notices him on a list in the journal. Raisa brings something to eat and explains that he has always been a good person, and despite his mistakes, he has always had a good heart. After leaving the house, Moira stops her son and informs him that she hired him a bodyguard -

   . While traveling by car to a pre-designated destination, Queen talks to a security guard who mentions his military achievements. A moment later, he turns back and notices that there is no millionaire. It turns out that the boy jumped out while driving. Oliver enters a former factory that Robert sold several years ago. Inside the building, Queen makes a hole in the floor for the foundations. It turns an underground room into a secret shelter full of computers and exercise equipment. Then he takes from the box he brought from the island, arrows and a bow. Ready, Oliver goes looking for Hunt. Meanwhile, the businessman goes to his car and orders one of the employees to take care of Laurel Lance. When you are close to the vehicle, an arrow pierces the window. Hood kills two of Adam's bodyguards and then threatens Hunt. If he doesn't transfer $ 40 million to his designated bank account for the next night, he will die. At the moment of the businessman's inattention, Oliver disappears.

   After returning to the office, Adam calls the police to ensure security. He tells detectives that they were attacked by a man in a green hood with a bow and arrows. He asks the policemen to coordinate further work with the new head of security. Hilton notes that Queen was telling the truth about the self-proclaimed green hooded hero. At the same time, Oliver goes to his car, where Diggle is waiting for him - this time not as a driver, but as a passenger. They go to a comeback party arranged by Tommy. On the spot, the young millionaire shouts that the island lacks tequila and makes a toast to the crowd. At a party while talking to Tommy, Oliver notices his sister smuggling drugs. The girl explains that she was alone during his absence, then goes to her friends, where she notices the lack of drugs. It turns out that during Thea's inattention, Oliver took the purse and threw it away. The millionaire meets Laurel and apologizes for what he said earlier. He decides he could switch places with Sarah. The woman tries to convey to him that she is open and can talk to him about what happened. Distracted Queen, seeing that Hunt didn't transfer the money, tells Laurel that he hasn't changed in those five years and doesn't want to hurt her again. The confused woman reckons that at least once he was honest when he said something like that. Oliver tries to leave the grounds, but Diggle stops him and shows him where the party is. The millionaire walks to the door and suddenly overpowers his bodyguard. At the same time, Drakon places armed men in the corridor and asks Hunt to monitor the elevator. Without being noticed by the police patrolling the streets and the entrance to the building, Oliver fires an arrow with a rope. The hood turns off the lights throughout the building and starts a fight with the bodyguards. When Adam hears his people screaming, he calls the police. Drakon picks up a gun and shoots Oliver, but the hero at the same time throws a knife in the opponent's chest. As the police enter the building, the millionaire takes off his bulletproof vest and jumps out the window. The detectives at the last moment notice Hood sliding down the rope towards Queen's party.

   The police enter the building where Queen's party is taking place. Detectives order the rooms to be searched, but Oliver shows up, who informs about closed and private play. Quentin is talking about a mysterious avenger who is here. The millionaire laughs and offers everyone two million dollars as soon as they provide information about the self-proclaimed hero. This act provokes detectives and police to miss the banquet. Suddenly, Tommy approaches his friend and after inquiring about the coincidence that the party is near Hunt's building, he learns that "many things" were happening on the island. The next day, while cleaning the office, Adam is notified of the disappearance of $ 40 million from his account. They don't realize that Hood left an arrow with a wireless transmitter that allowed him to hack into the businessman's systems. Robert informs his son that he does not have enough food for all three to survive. She asks Oliver to come home and fix his mistakes. Exhausted Oliver does not realize the seriousness of the situation and decides that there is enough food. Suddenly, Robert pulls out a gun and shoots a crew member, then again asks his terrified son to correct his mistakes and commits suicide.

   Laurel and Joanna discover that their clients receive anonymous donations totaling 40,000,000. Both women agree that the city has gained a new guardian angel. Tommy comes for the detective's daughter and asks outside about Oliver. Laurel assures that there is nothing to fear, as nothing has changed between her and the millionaire since the disappearance. When friends say goodbye, they walk away in opposite directions. It turns out that Hood heard the whole conversation. After Robert's death, Oliver drifted for a long time alone in the ocean. Suddenly, in front of him, he notices an island to which he is carried by the sea current. In the evening, Moira meets a man who says the police will not be able to discover that Oliver's kidnappers are related to them. The man asks if he should try to get the information out of him again, but the woman refuses. According to her, there are other ways she can find out what
