   Grace Gibbons was born in 2008 to an
   unnamed man
   and an
   unnamed woman
   in
   Central City
   .
  </p>
  <p key="ebcb79bb-b47f-4c9d-97e2-b9a79a500302">
   On May 4, 2017, when she was nine years old, Grace accompanied her parents to
   Gold City Bank
   and waited in the car as they made a withdrawal. Suddenly, her parents were killed by an exploding ATM as a consequence of a
   meta-human
   attack. Witnessing the tragedy, Grace screamed in horror. When the
   Central City Police Department
   arrived on the scene, she was found hiding underneath the seats, terrified.
  </p>
  <p key="47bc48d1-ee5d-43af-9947-0eb4c8b38ae3">
   Now left an orphan, Grace was eventually placed in the care of her uncle,
   <a href="Orlin Dwyer.html" key="2db0dfcd-bae5-4b53-9be5-4006f600cecf" title="Orlin Dwyer">
    Orlin Dwyer
   </a>
   , due to him being her next of kin. However, Orlin initially resented being Grace's guardian and kept his distance from her. Struggling with the loss of her parents and her uncle's destructive behavior, Grace became sullen and withdrawn. Over the next couple weeks, she began having outbursts at school, including calling a classmate a "rat bastard", a curse Orlin often used. Grace was then sent to the principal's office, where Orlin confronted her on what she said. However, Grace called her uncle out for being an unfit parent, stating that he didn't have room to talk when all he does is drink and rage at the world.
  </p>
  <p key="0cb73d22-d738-4611-a422-9bbbe786bad5">
   Following this incident, Orlin decided to start over with Grace and promised to be a better guardian to her. They moved into his cousin
   Robbie Byrne
   's old house on May 22, where the duo began fixing up a dollhouse. The two soon formed a close relationship, with Grace accepting Orlin as her family.
  </p>
  <p key="f314ff6b-b0d5-49ca-85ca-e580782e2e66">
   At one point, Orlin taught Grace
   a limerick about a pelican
   , but would rarely let her say it due to the word "hell" being in the rhyme.

   A year later, Grace attended the Central City Carnival with her uncle
   to commemorate the past year. As part of the celebration, Orlin bought Grace three ice creams and gifted her the new doll set she wanted for her dollhouse, much to her delight. Just then, Grace noticed the sky turning purple from the
   Enlightenment
   . When
   <a href="Barry Allen (Earth-1).html" key="3b51638d-602c-4878-a272-e80fadf5227e" title="Barry Allen (Earth-1)">

   and
   XS
   destroyed the
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   satellite hurtling towards the city, Grace and Orlin were both hit by debris from the satellite's core, which crashed near them. A piece of the
   dark matter
   shrapnel was embedded in Grace's forehead, causing dangerous levels of brain hemorrhaging which rendered her comatose. Orlin immediately brought Grace to
   Central City Hospital
   , where she was placed on life support under the care of Dr.
   Vanessa Ambres
   . Grace would subsequently be visited by her uncle every day at the hospital.
  </p>
  <p key="9d7c3856-a8ca-4707-96d0-27fd271cf0a2">
   A few weeks after the Enlightenment, Grace's condition still wasn't improving, much to Dr. Ambres' concern.
  </p>
  <p key="64f6b674-0dcf-4b52-baa2-ea3f306212d4">
   Six months later,
   Team Flash
   was able to identify Orlin as he visited Grace on Thanksgiving.
  </p>
  <p key="2e3e3889-0409-4844-ac17-d1318a226ed8">
   When Nora went in her memories, Grace was able to see her. Nora tried to make her pass her portal but it closed, trapping her. They visited her memories and Nora found out that Grace remembers his uncle swearing all metas will die, becoming Cicada. Then her brain defense mechanism created a version of her uncle that aimed to kill Nora. Later Nora appeared in a memory where Grace was eating pancakes with her uncle until Nora told her that this wasn't real, and witnessed her "uncle" getting stabbed by his evil version. Nora then fought him until she knocked him out and told Grace that she can help her uncle, but Grace called Nora a liar. An adult version of herself appeared dressed as Cicada and tried to kill Nora until Barry punched her out. Nora told her parents Grace wasn't coming, and they all escaped from Grace's mind.
  </p>
  <p key="3ed84951-d8e6-4f95-b62d-39c81b304283">
   It was later revealed that Grace's brain was affected by the dark matter from the shard lodged in her forehead, which could be influencing and affecting her mind.
  </p>
  <p key="3a46fd0d-1f87-4702-ad32-9f691bbbcc78">
   Grace, still comatose, was taken from Central City Hospital by her future self.

   Nora West-Allen
   later used the
   MAD 2.0
   in order to connect to Grace's mind. In her mindscape, Nora tried to convince Grace to take the
   Meta-human cure
   so that no more innocent people had to die. Grace then saw two versions of
   <a href="Orlin Dwyer.html" key="9cdcdb7a-6a6c-4265-abbb-6d549d8f9f65" title="Orlin Dwyer">
    her uncle
   </a>
   , one as Cicada and one as Orlin, who protested and encouraged her to take the cure, respectively. Grace eventually decided to take the cure and woke up from her coma. She was promptly given the cure, but the dark matter in her wound on her forehead prevented the cure from working. Suddenly, Grace's future self arrived and fought Nora,

   Killer Frost

   At some point after she awoke from her coma, Grace took on the mantle of Cicada to continue her uncle's legacy after he was administered the
   meta-human cure
   . She had killed 152 people, even more than
   Zoom
   or the
   Red Death
   . Eventually, Grace used the Time Sphere to travel back to March 2019 to rescue

  <p key="a868be3f-19da-4086-acec-fe0c08712f3e">
   After attempting to kill the

   Grace then broke into a different
   Tannhauser offsite
   to steal
   Cisco Ramon
   's prototypes for the meta-human cure. Grace sought the prototypes, and not the final version, of the cure because they would kill any meta-humans who took it. Along with the cryo-atomizer, she would be able to disperse the cure into the air and instantly kill all metas in
   Central City
   . Grace, while implementing the prototypes into the cryo-atomizer, recited the limerick about the pelican that her uncle had taught her. She suddenly heard her uncle's voice reciting it with her, and stopped working on the cryo-atomizer. She turned to see her uncle standing next to her, and both finished the rhyme in unison.
  </p>
  <p key="bfb789f1-dba3-451a-ac67-1c6f3e32ba08">
   Grace later finished implementing the prototypes of the cure into the cryo-atomizer, but her uncle told her that killing the metas just in Central City was not enough. Grace assured him that her plan would work. Grace went to
   Central City University
   to steal another component so that the cure could be spread to the

   dagger
   sensed the presence of a meta-human. She turned and saw
   Renee Adler
   standing with
   Sherloque Wells
   . Grace threw her dagger at Renee, but she threw a bench in front of her. As the Flash,
   XS
   , and other members of Team Flash arrived, she flew away. Grace then broke into what would become
   Ollins Laboratories
   in 2049 to steal a hyper-conduit, the final component to spread the cure throughout the country. Grace left a bomb that would detonate if someone opens the case that the hyper-conduit used to be in. With the cryo-atomizer now complete, Grace headed to
   CCPD
   and absorbed all of the metas', including
   Cecile Horton
   , dark matter.

   , and Vibe arrived and knocked Grace to the ground. Vibe went to the cryo-atomizer to try and breach it to
   another Earth
   , and Killer Frost created an ice wall to slow down Grace. When told that she couldn't defeat them without her uncle's dagger, Grace replied that she could, as she didn't have the dagger when she first arrived in 2019. To prove her point, she blasted the Flash away, then fought Killer Frost and Elongated Man, and quickly defeated them. As the Flash recovered, Grace threw him into the ice wall, shattering it. As Grace approached Vibe, he was able to hack into the cryo-atomizer to stop it from spreading the cure, thanks to Nora West-Allen's gauntlet, which contained a quantum computer. Enraged that her plan had failed, she screamed and would have attacked Vibe if not for the Flash knocking her into a desk. Vibe removed Grace's uncle's dagger from the cryo-atomizer and tossed it to the Flash, who, despite protests from Elongated Man, fired at it with the
   mirror gun
   .

     Grace was originally a normal, innocent young girl until witnessing her parents' accidental murder in a
     meta-human
     attack. Bitter at their deaths and forced to live with a guardian who didn't want her, she became very angry in general, beginning to act out in an attempt to cope with the pain. However, as
     <a href="Orlin Dwyer.html" key="c7490fdf-460c-40a2-a3b4-6ed231acbdee" title="Orlin Dwyer">
      Orlin Dwyer
     </a>
     started to clean up his act and connect with Grace, her attitude gradually improved as the two bonded. Grace started regaining her cheerful, bubbly demeanor and grew to deeply love her uncle, coming to feel that she was protecting Orlin as much as he was for her.
    </p>
    <p key="8c989428-2b17-434c-95ec-eba295cab43a">
     After falling into a coma, lost in her lingering negative emotions and still overhearing everything Orlin said about meta-humans, Grace fell deeper than ever into anger. Hearing how committed Orlin was to ridding the world of metas "for" her and knowing that metas were fighting him, she became psychotic. Trapped in her painful memories, Grace came to believe like her uncle that all metas are evil and must be destroyed.
    </p>
    Grace is proven to have a decent deductive ability, as seen by her immediate suspicion of
    Nora West-Allen
    's claims, eventually leading her to discover Nora was XS. Despite this, she is slightly naive, going with Nora without much need for convincing or trust.

    <p key="84420256-2dfb-4eeb-8e8e-211fa3c51e92">
     In an erased future, Grace never was woken up and shown the truth. Having been shaped by Orlin's hatred towards metas and the brain damage from the shard in her head, Grace embraced meta racism; as metas were all over the world, she considered them a plague.
    </p>
    <p key="a50cfd7e-260a-4718-b336-551d78ad95e2">
     Grace believes murder is the solution to all problems, even metas, when a cure to take away their powers was available; she largely seems to relish in murder or peace.
    </p>
    Her mental instability only worsened from guilt over killing Orlin. As a result, she began hallucinating her childhood dream construct of Orlin to talk to.
   </div>
   <div class="wds-tab__content" key="2197deee-300b-4e9e-8388-86cc0d20380a">
    As the second Cicada, Grace is more of a monster than her uncle, Orlin was; unlike Orlin, who refused to kill non-metas and civilians, she would be willing to kill anyone standing in her way without any remorse. She even killed her own uncle when he tried getting her to see his warped view was wrong. Even when it was revealed to her that the death of her parents was indeed an accident, Grace didn't care and was willing to kill a kind soccer mom whose powers caused the accident (even going so far to try to kill the woman in front of her own family).
