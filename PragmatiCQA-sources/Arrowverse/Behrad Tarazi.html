   In the original timeline, Behrad was killed by
   A.R.G.U.S.
   agents, leading to
   Zari
   gaining possession of his totem and joining the Legends. However, due to the events of
   Heyworld
   , the timeline changed and Behrad survived to join the Legends instead.
   He was ultimately slain by the
   Fate
   Atropos
   , who sensed he'd been fated to die before the timeline change.
   He was later resurrected by
   Charlie
   using the
   Loom of Fate
   .
   After the fight with  the
   Fates
   ,
   Tomaz
   went back into the totem to keep Behrad alive.

   After the Legends celebrated their victory over the
   Fates
   ,
   Sara Lance
   was kidnapped by aliens. In an effort to find her the team kidnapped
   Esperanza Cruz
   , a girl who clamed that she was abducted by aliens and could communicate with them.
   While searching the
   timeline
   for an alien that had information about Sara's whereabouts, Zari and Behard began arguing about who should wield the Air totem. Unbeknownst to them, Tomaz heard them arguing, so she created a copy of the totem for Zari to stop the siblings from bickering.
   After
   Mick Rory
   returned from his mission to find Sara with a clone of Sara, the Legends began searching for the remaining aliens that were still scattered throughout history.

   Nate
   revealed that his

   Gwyn Davies
   , who laid the foundation for all of time travel, and traveled to
   New York City
   to find him.
   Like they changed the timeline, Behrad and rest of the Legends were hunted by "

Since the plan worked, the anti-meta-human act never happened which in turn caused Behrad to never be killed and Zari never joins the Legends. As a result, Behrad joined the Legends instead of Zari and everyone's memories were changed to reflect this, with no one remembering that Zari was ever there.

    after noticing how many Zagurons there were. While they were fighting the aliens, Behrad was attacked by an alien and Sara told Zari they would have to cut his arm for him to survive, but Zari told Sara to not touch him. When Spooner told them to stop fighting, she used powers she didn't know she had to temporarily give Behrad Sara's regeneration power.  After Sara and Ava said their "I do's", the
    Fountain of Imperium
    awoke and killed all of the Zagurons.

   Behrad went searching for the fail-safe with Zari. While they were searching for the safe, they started talking about how Constantine had dumped her. However, Zari clarified that she wasn't dumped and that they both mutually agreed to end things. Zari then showed Behrad the key Constantine had given her and how she had to find what it was for. After returning to Gloria's house, Astra and Spooner told the rest of the team that the safe was in the
    Sheriff's
    office. When trying to figure out how to draw heat off of Gloria and her property, Ava and Gary remembered a
    Time Bureau
    rule that required agents to create a cover story, specifically a circus, if things went sideways on a mission. Zari and Behrad's act consisted of telling people that they were animal handlers and any creatures that people saw the other night were just some of their creatures that had escaped. After Nate and Ava managed to get the safe, the Legends discovered that it didn't have the courier and it only had a note from Mick saying that he took the time courier, a Time Bureau manual, and Behrad's gummy bears.

    J. Edgar Hoover
    and his men showed up at Gloria's house, Behrad and the rest of the Legends had to hide, but they couldn't figure out where to do so. Behrad told Zari to use the key Constantine had given her on a locked closet. When Zari opened the door, the team saw a hallway and had no choice but to enter. The Legends eventually realized that they were in Constantine's house, but Gary told them it wasn't Constantine's house, but a
    pocket dimension
    that he had created that just looked like his house. When leaving, Behrad offered Zari to come with him, but she decided to stay for a bit longer in the pocket dimension. Sara and Ava started robbing a bank to bait Hoover to them instead of Gloria's property. The Legends got into a car, but while Behrad was driving, Hoover and his men were upfront and started shooting, so Behrad and Nate changed places. Nate accidentally killed Hoover by using his powers, so Gary had to eat his body.

   After the car broke down, Ava got worried about the timeline changes and asked Behrad if he could fix the car, Behrad told Ava to find water, but Ava found soda, but Behrad told her it might work. Sara found a radio and heard the news about the robbery. After Behrad fixed the car, the Legends got on the train to impersonate Hoover. They stayed in the Honeymoon Suite. After the train shaked, Ava and Sara entered the pocket dimension leaving Behrad, Nate, and Gary alone. Gary gave Nate a potion to look like Hoover. Like the men expected Nate to hurt a man working on the train, Behrad got pissed off. Behrad and the other realized these men weren't working for Hoover and instead were
    Al Capone
    's men.
  </p>
  <p key="1bbc8c30-006a-45ee-b61d-58bab2e63859">
   Like Nate still looked like Hoover, they kidnapped him. Behrad asked for Zari, Sara, and Ava's help since Nate had been kidnapped by Al Capone's men. Shortly after Zari, Sara, and Ava successfully saved Nate,
    J. Edgar Hoover
    showed up and started killing all of the men who had planned on kidnapping him. In order to stop Hoover, Sara grabbed a bottle of whiskey that she, Zari, and Ava had brought and used it to knock him out. Fearing that they had killed him again, the Legends quickly realized that this Hoover was a robot. When it started a self-destruct sequence, Behrad and the team quickly got into a car and drove away.

   When the Legends arrived in Chicago, they ditched Hoover's car and decided to take a train the rest of the way to New York. While trying to figure out how to get Sara and Ava to the train station with no one recognizing them, Zari noticed a shop that sold wigs and entered it with Sara and Ava, While Behrad, Nate, and Gary stayed outside of the car but then entered the shop. When the shop owner realized that Sara and Ava were "The Bullet Blondes", he only agreed to help the Legends sneak out of his shop if they bought wigs for triple the price. The team agreed and left the shop through its back entrance, ending up in an alley.

   . Behrad got offered to play an instrument so he agreed. After, the Legends entered the pocket dimension for the night. After Eddie got hurt by the mob men, Zari convinced the others to let her help him. Zari asked Behrad and Eddie to get the word out about the party. Later, at the party, Nate, Gary and Behrad stayed outside to protect, but Hoover and his men arrived so, Behrad, Nate, and Gary tried their best to fight them, luckily Ava and Sara stopped him. Once Eddie left, Behrad and the rest of the Legends decided to stay in the pocket dimension while Gary took a train to New York.

    Dr. Gwyn Davies
    's folder. Once Sara was back, they observed the footprints and realized it would take five or more years to make one. On the pocket dimension, Zari revealed to the Legends that Hoover was sent to eliminate the Legends, making them question why. Behrad was fixing the time machine. When Behrad placed the missing part, Ava's Time Bureau book disappeared as long as Gary and her.

Both Tomaz and Behrad tried to help, but Gwyn got angry and ran away from them, so Tomaz followed him.

Some military men arrived, so the Legends started running to the closest door they found and entered the pocket dimension. There, they questioned Bishop and learned about the evil Gideon. To fix the time machine, Ava and Sara went to investigate where to get them. Once they returned, the Legends reunited and celebrated Nates and Tomaz moving in together. Later, Zari told Nate about how some ancestors disliked him, so Behrad offered to teach Nate about Persian culture, with Zari helping him out.

When the ladies arrived, they told the others about the factory and brought a missing part Gwyn needed. To help out, Behrad, Zari, and Nate started making sandwiches for the woman working in the factory. After giving the sandwiches, Behrad brought Astra a sandwich and talked with her about how Bishop got the advantage over him and had a heart-to-heart chat.

   Like Bishop was taking advantage of him, Behrad finally said no to Bishop when he asked for doughnuts. To help, Bishop created a neural navigational system that Gideon could use to navigate the time machine and showed it to Behrad. Later, Zari offered Nate a piece of pie and told Nate and Behrad how Gwyn looked like Constantine. Since the Legends accidentally changed the timeline, "
    evil Gideon
