   Late at night,  Batwoman manages to stop a human organ trafficking operation, but almost gets her cowl taken off by one of the criminals. As she’s walking back into
   Wayne Tower
   , Luke suggests to maybe she can wear a braid, but Kate quickly shoots down that idea.  Inside Kate’s office, Mary is already there with a bottle of champagne and ready to celebrate Kate’s win.  Kate mentions that the trafficker got away and that some asshat yanked her wig and almost pulled off her cowl.  Mary suggests running an electrical charge through the cowl so that the next person who tries to get all grabby would have 10,000 volts worth of an electrical shock.  Kate doesn’t feel comfortable having electricity so close to her head, and Mary, as a result, feels like it was a dumb idea she suggested. However, once she leaves, Luke tells Kate that Mary’s idea is actually kind of genius. Kate knows that Mary wants to be part of her this vigilante team, but the answer continues to be a resounding no. Luke counters it by saying it’s not so much about being part of her vigilante escapades, but rather about Mary wanting to be part of Kate’s life more. Kate refuses to budge and says that if that’s the case, that she will take Mary out to dinner more. Instead, she tells Luke that they need to focus on finding where Tommy Elliot hid
   Lucius Fox's journal
   , which has the best-kept secrets of
   Wayne Enterprises
   .

  <p key="f8cf0720-f36a-4abe-99fe-cd338eabdecb">
   At some warehouse full of things belonging to Tommy Elliot that were seized after he was arrested, Julia and Sophie are doing some investigating.
   Sophie immediately finds every
   Kitty Delgado
   comic. After having a good laugh, the two women continue their search for Lucius  Fox’s journal. Julia hopes the
   Crows
   pay overtime for their investigation, but Sophie says she’ll settle for hazard pay after coming face to face with a painting of Tommy naked.  Later, Julia gives Kate a call and tells her ex that they basically went through everything in the warehouse,  but found nothing of value. Luke mentions that Tommy owned 40 buildings in
   Gotham
   alone, so who knows where he could have ultimately stashed his father’s journal.  Knowing that there’s only one person who knows, goes to Arkham Asylum to pay Tommy a visit.
  </p>
  <p key="7147f1f7-bba6-4e1a-9949-5a090f19ac6f">
   Tommy asks Kate about Bruce’s whereabouts because he has continued to be a no-show during visiting hours. When Tommy says that this is no way of treating one’s best friend, Kate taunts him by saying that it is if the supposed best friend killed Bruce’s actual best friend. She presses Tommy on the journal’s whereabouts, but he doesn’t give her a straight answer. Instead, he cries and calls for his mother, and as she is putting the phone down, Tommy tells her to tell Bruce that the bells are on.  Tommy gets taken to his cell after his talk with Kate but finds Alice inside. He tells her to get out of his cell. Alice says that Tommy’s cell is so much roomier than hers. She taunts him by saying that there’s going to be a vacancy when they strap Tommy to the electric chair for murdering
   Lucius Fox
   .  Tommy counters her statement by telling how he’s crazy now and 100% unfit to stand trial. Mouse, disguised as the deceased
   Dr. M. Butler
   reveals to Tommy that he told the Crows how he was now fit for trial. Alice tries to convince Tommy to work with her and
   Mouse
   . Eventually, Tommy gives in and tells them how inside the journal is a failsafe on how to kill The Bat if the suit ever got into the wrong hands. Alice wonders why Lucius Fox would need to know that kind of information, and Tommy drops the bombshell that
   Bruce Wayne
   is Batman.

  <p key="50c693b1-d663-4282-a077-3cf30b668064">
   This newfound revelation makes Alice want the journal that much more, but Tommy wants something in return. Mouse as Dr. M. Butler says that they can break him out of Arkham, but Tommy isn’t quite sold on it. He talks about how it wouldn’t be much of a prize since there’d be a wanted poster with his face on it across all Gotham. Alice suggests that they can always get Tommy a new face. Mouse checks that it’s just the three of them, and with Alice’s permission, takes off the Dr. M. Butler face mask to reveal his true self behind it.

   At the
   Batcave
   , Luke tells Kate that twenty-two minutes after she visited Tommy in Arkham, he made an outgoing call to The Lookout, which is technically Johnny Sabatino’s club.  But Tommy owns the building. Kate mentions how rumor has it that Sabatino has been laundering Tommy’s money through the club for years.  Luke calls it one posh-looking laundromat after hearing about this bit of information.  Through the traced call, Luke and Kate find out that Sabatino will be in touch with Tommy to give him back the journal.  Luke asks Kate how she will infiltrate the club which is on a very high floor and infested with mob goons. Kate tells him that she will do so by walking through the front door.

   Mary eventually shows up again trying to help Kate by getting her some clothes where she can conceal her Batwoman weapons, but still, blend in at the club. Kate repeats to her step-sister that it’s too dangerous to bring her into the team, and she’s not going to take her to The Lookout. Mary gets angry and brings up how she’s been stabbed, poisoned and almost insinuated. So she says that all it proves is that she can look out for herself. Mary suggests Kate needs back up, but a few seconds later Julia comes in. Mary is dejected and tells Kate that she thought there were no more spots available on the Bat team. Julia hears this part of the conversation and tells Mary that she’s really only an honorary member. Kate tells her that it’s nothing personal and that Julia is literally trained for this kind of life she is part of.

   At the club, Julia tells Kate that Sophie is on her way to arrest Tommy Elliot. Kate realizes how close her two exes have gotten as of late. Inside the elevator, Julia eventually tells Kate that  Sophie recently came out to her mom and that eating greasy food has helped the two of them bond. At the bar, Kate sees Reagan as the bartender, who tells her ex that she has actually stopped at
   The Hold Up
   a couple of times. She mentions that she hoped to run into Kate but never did. She brings up how she’s kept an eye on her real estate endeavors and suggests that Gotham could use more people like Kate Kane. After handing her a drink, Reagan confesses that she regrets walking away from Kate, but that she thought Kate would try harder to win her back. Meanwhile, Julia manages to hack into the cameras at the club so that Luke has access. The lights get turned off shortly after but on her way to Johnny’s office, Julia gets ambushed by some of his goons. Luke realizes it's a trap and Kate sees the journal just sitting on a table.

In reality, Alice has cut off Tommy’s face to put on as a mask on someone else, and is bandaging up Tommy’s bloodied face somewhere else in the mental facility. Tommy, while visibly in pain, asks Alice when he gets his new face. She tells him that it won’t just be a new face, but it will be a whole new him. But first, she’ll need that much-coveted journal from him.

   At The Lookout, Mary tries to save Kate, but Johnny tells her that it’s an all-cash transaction. He realizes that what she has in the suitcase is only 2.5 million. So he tells Mary that if she and
   Hamilton Dynamic
   want the
   Batwoman suit
   , they can have it once it’s peeled from Batwoman’s corpse.  On the security cameras, Luke detects Magpie breaking into the club too and trying to steal the journal.  In the blink of an eye, Mary manages to untie Kate and save her. Meanwhile, Julia uses that distraction to get out as well. But not until after she killed the woman who knew the truth about her current relationship with the SRR.  Once three women are in the same room, Mary tells Julia and Kate that Magpie is also in the building. Kate says she will go and retrieve the journal, but Julia needs to get Mary out of the club.

   At the roof, Magpie and Batwoman fight over the book, and Magpie throws it off the room.  Batwoman manages to retrieve, but by the time she gets back on the roof, Magpie is gone. Sometime later,  Kate apologizes to Mary for shutting her out, and also thanks her stepsister for coming to her rescue. Kate apologizes once more, this time for keeping Mary at arm’s length. She admits that it’s not because she doesn't trust her, or thinks she can't handle herself. It’s actually because she already has lost one sister, and doesn’t want to lose her too. She once again thanks Mary for not listening to her, and for risking her life to save hers. Kate ends her confession by telling Mary how she will just have to get used to the fact that her sister is a total badass. Mary asks if that all means she can be part the
   Bat  Team
   , to which Kate now happily agrees.

   Once Mary leaves, Reagan shows up and tells Kate how crazy of a night it was. She mentions how apparently Batwoman was on the case and mentions how it’s super weird because the last time she saw Batwoman was when she was with Kate.  She mentions how it’s all kind of a crazy coincidence.  Kate lies and says it’s not a coincidence and that she wasn’t actually taking a look at the competition.  She mentions to Reagan how Johnny Sabatino stole something from Wayne Enterprises and she needed it back. So she lies and says that Batwoman helped her. Reagan buys that excuse and asks Kate if she might be able to get Batwoman’s autograph for her. She says probably not, but she can give Reagan a ride home. Reagan mentions how she was actually on her way to get a drink after what happened tonight. She casually asks if Kate’s bar is still open. Kate says it isn’t and the two go back to Kate’s place where they hook up.

   The next morning, Kate wakes up alone in her bed, and Reagan is long gone, along with the book. She eventually makes her way to Wayne Tower, where she explains as much to Luke and Julia.  Kate admits that she never thought Reagan of all people would betray her. An angry Luke reiterates that it ultimately doesn’t matter because Kate’s life is still very much in danger.  Julia breaks up the argument and asks them that they really should be focusing on why a bartender of all people wanted the journal in the first place.

   At some town square in Gotham, Reagan meets up with Magpie and chastises her for costing her a really hot girlfriend. She hands over the journal, and Magpie tells Reagan it’s her own fault for falling for a mark again. Reagan tells Magpie that she can take the book and use it to get her freedom, but that she is out. She no longer wants to be an advance scout for Magpie.  Margot mentions how she thought Reagan would do anything for her sister.  Regan walks off in one direction and

Julia gets a call and tells Sophie she has to take the call. Once she is alone, Julia answers her phone and tells the person on the other side of the phone that she was going to call them.
