   After Claybourne was murdered by The Hood in 2012, Simon sought vengeance upon the elusive vigilante. Dropping off the grid completely and erasing all traces of his existence from the internet,
   he took on the fake identity "Adrian Chase" and researched his target.
   In his research, Adrian discovered his target's identity as Oliver Queen and obsessively studied him, learning everything he could about the man and his

   , which included Claybourne.
   This led to Adrian believing that Oliver was really a serial killer and Oliver's righteous crusade was a lie to justify a killing spree and therefore poisons the lives of those he cares for and swore to make his target suffer.
   At some point, Adrian met and fell in love with

   His first target was Lieutenant
   Sam Conahan

Conahan tried to shoot back but Prometheus dodged the shots, leaped to the ground, and threw a shuriken to disarm him. As Conahan tried to flee, Prometheus threw a knife into his victim's leg, knocking the lieutenant down. As Conahan desperately tried to crawl away, Prometheus slowly walked up, katana in hand. When asked if he was Green Arrow, Prometheus coldly replied that he wasn't and killed Conahan.

   Adrian was later called to Oliver's office and informed of John's arrest and wrongful imprisonment for illegal arms dealing of a nuclear trigger set up General
   J.G. Walker
   . Oliver wanted Adrian to represent John, to which Adrian was initially skeptical but agreed. He visited John and but as Walker appeared to transport John into custody, the latter insisted to Adrian that Walker would simply falsify an excuse to kill him to cover his tracks. Adrian then tried to delay Walker with various regulations but Walker said he had the Attorney General on speed dial and threatened to have Adrian disbarred unless John was placed in his custody within 24 hours.

   Later when Black Siren escaped Team Arrow's custody, Prometheus went to meet up with her. Encountering Ragman, Prometheus quickly knocked him out before confronting Green Arrow, which lead to another fight between the two. Green Arrow threw a diazepam-laced dart at Prometheus before firing a cable arrow at him, hoping to restrain and capture him. Prometheus instead shrugged off the drug and reacted quick enough for the cable to wrap around his arm rather than his whole body as intended. Breaking the cables with his sword, Prometheus told the archer he had a tolerance to the drug and they continued their fight. After seeing Felicity being confronted by Black Siren, Prometheus tauntingly asked his opponent to choose between him or Felicity, concluding the ordeal by kicking Green Arrow through a wooden wall to where Black Siren and Felicity were, before escaping as Black Siren was captured again.

   To ensure John wasn't placed in prison, Adrian told John to punch him and pretended to try and fight back as the guards intervened. Adrian then reminded Walker that if a prisoner committed an offense against the district attorney within his jurisdiction, he could personally oversee the matter and reminded Walker it "could take a while". This allowed Adrian to delay John's transportation into Walker's custody by one week.

   Adrian discovered from a friend at the

   James Edlund

Adrian was later present when Oliver and Quentin tried to convince Pike that the Green Arrow is innocent, though Pike initially refused to listen as Green Arrow still killed a member of ACU. Despite this, Oliver was successful in getting Pike to stop this pursuit, to which Adrian leaked the mayor's office's role in covering up Billy's death to the media.

While Adrian agreed, he reminded Oliver that the circumstances would call for someone to take the fall. At the hearing, Adrian and Oliver watched as the coroner confessed to filing a false report on Billy's death to Councilman Collins and as Captain Pike told them of Oliver's vouching for the Green Arrow. After the first stage of the hearing, Oliver, Thea, Quentin, and Detective

   Later, Prometheus encountered Vigilante on a rooftop (presumably using the tech from the visor to locate the latter) and warned him that Oliver is his to take down, but Vigilante vowed to kill him first and they came into conflict. Clearly being the superior combatant, Prometheus overpowered Vigilante and forced his opponent off the rooftop, though Vigilante somehow survived and fled. Unmasking, Adrian then called 911 and informed them of Vigilante's sighting. Later, Adrian talked to Pike over the various vigilante sightings and if they were simply delaying Star City's inevitable fate, though Adrian reminded him that delaying the inevitable was part of their job. As he kept Pike busy with small talk, Adrian slipped the piece of Vigilante's visor back to Dinah.

   At Oliver's office, Adrian once again offered to take the fall for everything, which Oliver still refused to accept, though Adrian pointed out that someone needed to be discredited or Oliver would be impeached; Oliver decided to offer up the Green Arrow. Adrian stood by Oliver, Thea, Quentin, and Dinah as Oliver gave a speech to the public discrediting Green Arrow with Billy's murder. Afterward, Adrian informed Oliver that Collins has ruled against ending Oliver's administration. Oliver immensely thanked Adrian for this and Adrian reassured Oliver that he didn't do it just because Oliver was his boss, but because he was a "friend". Later, Adrian approached Susan and said he supposedly had an exclusive, sickly joking that it is a "matter of life and death".

   Afterward, Adrian kidnapped and held Susan in an abandoned hotel rigged with explosives. Prometheus then filmed Susan tied to a chair and tearfully screaming in fear, as he held a knife to his captive's throat, tauntingly telling the woman to scream for him again. Anticipating that Team Arrow would use Amanda against him as leverage, Adrian had his mother relocated and left the film of him and Susan playing on a continuous loop for Team Arrow to find. Adrian was later informed by Talia that Oliver discovered his true identity, which she had divulged to make Oliver suffer, though Adrian was glad he now finally knew. As Adrian was in a board meeting discussing the drug trade, Oliver returned and Adrian discreetly taunted Oliver over his inability to confront him, asking if he's "been asleep this whole time".

   Adrian is later confronted by Green Arrow in a parking garage, who fired several arrows at his car in a failed attempt to intimidate him. Adrian was disappointed that Green Arrow wanted to arrest instead of killing him, though Green Arrow firmly stated he wasn't going to kill Adrian if only that's what he wanted to happen. Adrian then revealed to Green Arrow he had Susan hostage, warning that if he dies or doesn't get back in time, Susan will die of starvation and dehydration, nor was he concerned with the idea of torture as it would have the same results. Green Arrow reluctantly let Adrian go. Adrian pridefully taunted that he was 10 steps ahead of a game Green Arrow still didn't understand and laughed as he left the scene.

   Later, Adrian ran into Quentin and Rene (also now aware) and told them he liked this better with everyone knowing who he is now. While Quentin and Rene promised to kill him, Adrian tauntingly reminded them that threatening a city official was a felony and he is only getting started with his plans. He ordered Quentin and Rene to get back to work, leaving them powerless to do anything. Anticipating that Oliver would try to use Doris as leverage, Adrian tipped off the ESU, who arrived at his home in time and stopped Green Arrow from getting near his wife. Adrian later attended a press conference to inform the public of Green Arrow's "attempted kidnapping" of Doris as retaliation for these recent "crimes". Because of this, Oliver was forced to publicly order Green Arrow to be brought in within 24 hours, or the SCPD would hunt the vigilante down, but this was also a discreet threat to Adrian himself.

   After Team Arrow finally uncovered Susan's location, Prometheus patiently waited for Green Arrow and unmasked himself, noting that he's glad that they knew as he preferred to fight him face to face. While Green Arrow threatened to keep them inside until the entire building exploded, Adrian deactivated the bombs. However, Adrian was caught off-guard when Spartan arrived with Doris, exposing his identity to his wife and proving Adrian really is not 10 steps ahead. After his wife's attempts to reason with him, Adrian seemingly promised Doris he will stop his crusade but instead stabbed her to protect his secret and continue his vendetta. Green Arrow attacked him in anger and the two begin to fight. After a brutal battle that ended in a draw, Adrian told Green Arrow neither would kill the other, to which Green Arrow stated that he could kill Adrian. Just then, Talia arrived and used a tranquilizer arrow to incapacitate Green Arrow. The two kidnapped Oliver, bringing him to an unknown location.

   Adrian later returned to the precinct as Quentin escorted Susan in for her statement, giving his "sympathies" for Susan as Quentin threatened him again. However, Adrian asked not to be threatened as he was in mourning since Green Arrow "killed" Doris, but Quentin and Susan swiftly saw through his lies. Adrian reminded them that he had Oliver hostage, whom he threatened to send "back in pieces" if Quentin and Susan tried anything. While Susan did still give a statement to the police, Adrian had an airtight alibi so they didn't believe her and his cover remained intact.

   In Oliver's holding cell, Adrian watched Oliver futilely try to reason with Talia, who then ordered Adrian to make Oliver suffer, which he happily agreed to. As Oliver promised his own friends would find him, Adrian simply reminded Oliver yet again that he wasn't going to kill him. He then told Oliver that he'd confessed to a captive Susan that Oliver had helped him discover who he truly was, and promised to return the favor before subjecting Oliver to torture.

On the sixth day, Adrian held Oliver's head underwater for 145 seconds at a time, the same amount of time it took for Adrian's father to drown after being shot by Oliver. When Oliver didn't "confess", Adrian resumed the torture.

   Once Oliver regained consciousness, Adrian planted photos of his various victims, but as Oliver reminded Adrian that they all had victims themselves, Adrian further pointed out they also had families who all suffered because of Oliver. He then brought up a memorable victim whom Oliver had killed 3 years previously to save Felicity:

   her apartment

   Afterward, Adrian returned with Evelyn to deceive Oliver by pitting them against each other, promising to let the survivor go or he'd break Evelyn's neck, before leaving to tend to other business. When he returned, Adrian, disappointed to see that Oliver hadn't even tried, pretended to break Evelyn's neck as she played dead to horrify Oliver.

  <p key="32412f57-391d-4985-9d35-099bb8773cae">
   Returning, Adrian intensely taunted Oliver that his belief that everything (The List, the Hood, and his heroic crusade) were all just an excuse for why he truly killed. Oliver finally cracked, angrily admitting to killing because of liking it. Pleased, Adrian mused that he'd made Oliver confess the one secret he wouldn't even admit to himself, with Evelyn dropping her façade and agreeing with him. Adrian stated he was right, that Oliver infected every life he touched as his crusade was based on a lie, resulting in a price, namely the death of his loved ones, and John and Felicity would eventually pay too.

Before doing so, Adrian reflected that Oliver must have done something extraordinary to have earned a captain rank in the Bratva, and how the burned tattoo would now serve as a reminder of his confession.

Adrian then left while Oliver was unconscious, returning his uniform and equipment and leaving the door open as promised.

When they were alone, Adrian gave Oliver a knife and presented an ultimatum; either kill him as a civilian in broad daylight, as Green Arrow couldn't reach him now that he is in protective custody since the vigilante "murdered" Doris, or let him go knowing there is nothing Oliver can do. Oliver ultimately declined Adrian's offer, much to the latter's disappointment. Adrian told him to keep the knife as he left. Later, Adrian's protective custody escort was attacked by Bratva agents hired by Oliver, but Team Arrow intervened and Adrian used this chance to escape.

   Because of Adrian's exposure to the public as a serial killer, all the convicts he detained were released after retrial, including Sampson. Adrian soon enlisted Sampson's aid to seemingly recreate his father's
   tuberculosis
   outbreak by having him steal the chemicals required. While having Sampson obtain these chemicals, Adrian distracted Team Arrow by ruining Robert's memory; he sent a crate to City Hall containing the body of Councilman
   Henry Goodwin
   encased in concrete, exposing Robert's role in Goodwin's death 15 years previously to the public. Anticipating that Oliver would confirm the origin of the cement encasing Goodwin's body came from Oliver Enterprises, Adrian rigged one of the hallways with a trap which Oliver and Diggle fell into. They fell into a secret room in which Adrian had set up raw cement to flood the area and eventually kill them in the same manner Goodwin died. Dinah and Curtis were able to save them, but at the cost of Sampson obtaining more chemicals for Adrian's plan. Knowing that Oliver would seek out
   Darren Coffman

Meanwhile, Prometheus continued to fight Green Arrow as their battle carried out down two flights of stairs, with both combatants being fairly evenly matched. Unmasking, Adrian taunted Green Arrow that their fathers' legacies are what led them to become who they are.

   However, Green Arrow revealed to Adrian (having learned from Coffman) that Claybourne was originally going to disown him, not because Adrian was illegitimate, but because Claybourne believed his son to be a psychopath. Green Arrow noted that Robert never gave up on him while Adrian had been fighting to avenge a man who was ashamed of him. Seemingly crushed to learn this, Adrian collapsed to the ground in grief and offered his katana to Green Arrow, begging to be killed.

   in the monastery. Adrian taunted Oliver about William and dueled with him as the rest of Oliver's allies took on Talia, her acolytes, and Black Siren. As they dueled, Oliver knocked Adrian off a balcony and trapped him in a headlock, with Adrian goading Oliver to snap his neck. However, much to Adrian's shock, Oliver chose to spare him in the end, stating that Adrian can blame Oliver for his father's death for the rest of his life, but Oliver has already forgiven himself for his own father's sins. Adrian once again tried to goad Oliver into killing him by claiming that William was dead, but Oliver saw right through the lie and affirmed that even if it were true, Oliver would never let Adrian get the outcome he wants. As Oliver turned to leave, Felicity alerted him about Adrian's dead man switch, having discovered the network of C4 bombs. Adrian then escaped from the monastery using a smoke bomb with Oliver close in pursuit, eventually finding the former trying to flee in a boat.

   Oliver caught up to Adrian and brutally beat him down, demanding to know William's location. Adrian simply taunted Oliver about losing his friends, revealing that the former's plane was sabotaged. Oliver then urged his friends to flee Lian Yu using an A.R.G.U.S. supply ship. Suddenly, Adrian dragged William out on the deck. Oliver aimed his bow, but Adrian issued an ultimatum: for Oliver to kill him so everyone on the island would die or spare him so he would snap William's neck. Oliver lowered his bow, seemingly agreeing with the second option, and Adrian smirked in triumph. However, Oliver instead shot Adrian's leg, causing the latter to collapse to the ground in pain and saving William.

  <p key="ad11f7d8-d613-4bcd-bf9e-3d062a3fd133">
   Adrian lay on the deck defeated, realizing that Oliver was resolute in his will to never kill him. He congratulated Oliver for winning, explaining it was good that he and William have each other since it was "going to be lonely, without Mom and Felicity". Adrian then drew a pistol, which he pressed against his head, intending to shoot himself. Realizing his adversary's intentions, Oliver frantically attempted to stop him but Adrian fired the gun while grinning at Oliver, dying by suicide as a last-ditch effort to break him, one way or the other. Adrian's death triggered the dead man's switch, leaving a horrified Oliver and William to watch as Lian Yu was destroyed.

Adrian's motive for Faust destroying the buildings was to trigger PTSD in Oliver from Lian Yu's explosion.

  <p key="8cb0a9ca-dde5-4bf8-9b7a-b3b5356b34f3">
   After his father's death, Adrian was consumed with grief and hatred for his father's murderer, and spent four years studying, training, and patiently waiting to destroy him completely. Adrian wanted to truly attack Oliver in a personal way similar to Slade Wilson's attacks, yet did not want to kill Oliver, but destroy everything Oliver stood for as well as his allies. Adrian used Oliver murdering his father as the event that defined his entire character and actions. After uncovering virtually

   While trying to accomplish his mission, Adrian developed the facade of a compassionate district attorney who cared about cleaning up the streets of

   and ironically a trusted confidant to his father's killer.
   In reality, Adrian's hatred for Oliver was so intense that he refused to allow anyone else to kill Oliver, as shown when he threatened and later killed
   Tobias Church
   .
   In spite of his hatred for Oliver, Adrian was not interested in killing him but to make him suffer so much that he wished that he was dead.
   Adrian had gone to great lengths to psychologically torture him and destroy his life including: killing innocent people to send a twisted message to Oliver, recreate the crime scene with dead bodies of Oliver killing Adrian's father, kidnapping his loved ones, and recruiting

   Adrian's hatred for Oliver even outweighed the apparent love that he had for his wife,
   Doris
   , as he killed her when Oliver used her against him after tearfully proclaiming he would go to the police. However, Adrian still later claimed that it was the Green Arrow who killed his wife.

  <p key="53ddda92-97e4-4295-a2f8-17dc3a7cf2fc">
   Adrian also believed that Oliver was not a hero but a killer who ruins the lives of everyone that he comes into contact with and was desperate to show that to him,
   going so far as to physically and psychologically torture Oliver for an entire week and Adrian succeeded in proving that on some level Oliver enjoyed killing.
   Adrian was also a hypocrite on some level as despite viewing Oliver as a killer he himself committed far more heinous actions than Oliver did, freely killing innocent people, using some of his victims' bodies as trails to recreate the scenes of Oliver's past kills, and even killing his own wife to further his vendetta, where Oliver never killed anyone who had not committed at least some kind of crime, proving that even though Oliver is a killer, Adrian was truly a psychopath. Adrian was also arrogant, smug and boastful towards Oliver and

      While torturing Oliver, Adrian used the same methods of Oliver used to hurt his enemies, including water-boarding and shooting him with arrows, all while not killing him. At the same time, Adrian psychologically tortured Oliver by threatening his loved ones and seemingly killing Evelyn in front of him.
      Adrian was eventually successful in breaking Oliver, a feat that only
