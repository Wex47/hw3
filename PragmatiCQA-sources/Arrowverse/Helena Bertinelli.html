In anger and grief, Helena went to Sicily, wanting revenge, and eventually discovered the existence of
   La Morte Sussurrata

Helena began having sex with various members of the organization to earn their trust, ultimately learning to fight and kill for them. She decided to use her skills to take down her father's criminal empire by killing people his closest associates and ultimately her father himself.

He talked about how they found out about Michael and threatened to kill her the same way he killed Michael. Oliver stopped him and just then, Oliver and Helena freed themselves and fought Nick and his men, killing Nick and a few others. Helena realized that Oliver is the Starling City vigilante and that night, he dropped into her room. Both admitted that they like being able to tell each other the truth and Oliver slept with her.

Oliver later visited her at her house and showed her Sara's grave and explained how he had hurt people with his actions. She recognized herself in his story and decided to let him help her in her crusade. Oliver tried to teach her that there was another way to take down her father without killing innocent people. He trained her in archery, which she considered impractical at first. He taught her that archery is about patience and discipline, though he ultimately decided a crossbow was more suitable for her. He also created a costume and mask to conceal her identity.

Tommy and Laurel had a small argument, and eventually, things grew awkward and the group dispersed. Helena said that he still had feelings for Laurel, so she walked away angrily. Realizing Oliver was not truly on her side, she continued her original plan. She killed Zhishan and some other high-ranked members and told one survivor that Bertinelli sent his regards.

   She watched from a distance as Chien Na Wei and a hit squad attacked the mansion. Her father managed to escape, but she shot an arrow in his leg. He was shocked to realize that she wanted to kill him. She prepared to shoot him; however, Oliver disarmed her with another shot. She angrily attacked him and the two engaged in hand-to-hand combat. She managed to take him down and made an attempt to overpower him. She was unaware that her father grabbed her crossbow. Oliver tried to shield her; however, the arrow hit her in the chest and knocked her down. She later woke up in the Arrow cave and was angry that Oliver had saved her father from her. He tried to tell her that he tried to save her from herself and that killing her own father would destroy her. He said that her father was in custody and would be in jail soon. She indignantly replied that she will keep going after her father, then left.

Ignoring him, she forced Felicity to track down her father's location. She invaded the safehouse and killed the US Marshals assigned to protect him. Before she could attack her father, Oliver intercepted. After a brief standoff, Oliver tried to shoot Helena, but she caught the arrow. Furious that he tried to kill her, she struck him.

She broke into the courthouse where his trial was about to take place and attempted to kill him, only to get confronted by a SWAT team. She and her men engaged in a firefight and the SWAT team was forced to retreat. As her father had managed to escape she ordered her men to take everyone hostage. Helena negotiated with the police and threatened to kill hostages if they would not surrender her father to her. As she was about to kill the first hostage, Laurel and
   Sara Lance

Shortly afterward, she was arrested by the police, lamenting that she was not the one to kill her father, who had been accidentally shot by the police in the crossfire.

     Helena's personality changed completely, after finding out that her father murdered her fianc√©
     Michael Staton
     whom she deeply loved. Swearing to take her father's world apart and see him suffer, she turned unstable, vengeful and volatile. She has no humane morals or remorse, meaning she is more than ready to hurt and kill people, even if innocent, if they get in her way of her exacting her revenge. She also readily manipulates and threatens innocent people if it means seeing her goal fulfilled, although she seems to not always want to as she begged Oliver not to "make her do something both of them would regret". Trying to justify her killings, she would even cite that her actions are for the sake of justice, despite them being done out of vengeance alone. However, she is still capable of love, as she still loves Michael years after his death and simply does not want to be hurt again, such as when she and Oliver were dating, she only becomes angry when she realizes that he still loves Laurel. Helena also believes that she is obligated to fulfill her quest for vengeance as she claimed; "once you let the darkness inside, it never comes out".

     After Frank is killed at the hands of an unstable police captain (
     Stein
     ) instead of her own, she gathers two feelings; first, regret that she wasn't the one who killed Frank, second, loneliness, because once he was dead, she believed that Frank and Michael are together now, Helena is also shown to be sympathetic and compassionate towards Oliver's cause as she hates being the daughter of a crime lord just as Oliver was the son of a billionaire businessman expected to take over the company. Despite knowing the truth about Oliver, Helena also seems to have residual romantic feelings for him as she has kept his secret from the police even after he attempted to kill her.

     Helena exhibited an overconfidence, arrogance and condescending attitude towards those who confront her; she openly taunted
     Sara Lance
     (under the persona of the Canary) during their first duel where Helena merged victorious, when she squared off against Sara once again, Helena quickly reminded her of her defeat the last time they fought. However, she finds out the hard way, that the reason why she was able to best Sara in their first confrontation, was because the latter was holding back at the time; Helena's arrogant and overconfident traits can easily lead to her downfall.
    </p>
    After the death of her father, Frank, Helena finally realizes that Oliver was right; that killing her father would not change anything and would not make the pain of him killing her fianc√© go away. She seems to be beset by guilt and remorse for her immoral actions and seems to seek redemption. However, she maintains her isolation attitude, at least for the time being.

     Expert hand-to-hand combatant/Martial artist:

    Helena is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist; able to easily beat multiple opponents, be it thugs or trained police officers. She even proved to be an unpredictable combatant to more skilled opponents; such as Oliver and
    Sara Lance
    ; Helena was able to contend with Oliver and disarm him in all their fights, but was ultimately bested on both their encounters, and beat Sara while she was armed with her bo-staff and holding back without much effort, and even briefly stood up to her once Sara fought to kill, but was eventually defeated and restrained. Helena seems to favor grappling moves during her fights.

    Helena is proficient with various types of firearms, but her skills are noted to be rudimentary at first when she shot and killed
    Paul Copani
    and
    Zhishan
    . Although still willing to use guns and not being trained enough to use a recurve bow, she began to show favoritism to hand-held crossbows. Helena later demonstrated highly proficient use of one that she could shoot and kill
    Gus Sabatoni
    with two precisely-aimed bolts, as well as temporarily paralyze
    McKenna Hall
    and take out a team of armed US Marshals with a single crossbow.
