      The
      Legends
      travel to
      Nazi
      -occupied
      Paris
      , but find themselves surrounded by the
      Justice Society of America
      (AKA JSA.) The Legends discover a time
      aberration
      that threatens the JSA, but the JSA wants nothing to do with them or their help. Nevertheless, the Legends force their way into the JSA's mission to intercept and seize a
      mysterious package
      .
      Nate
      is desperate to prove that he should be part of the team, but he has a secret that he shares with his grandfather
      Commander Steel
      that might make it difficult.
      Ray
      is so focused on impressing the JSA, he puts himself and
      Vixen
      in danger. Meanwhile,
      Stein
      has stepped in as the leader with
      Rip
      gone, but when decisions aren't being made
      Sara
      seems to be the one calling the shots.
