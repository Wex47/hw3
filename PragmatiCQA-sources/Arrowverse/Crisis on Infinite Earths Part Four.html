   to rewrite reality and take the place of
   Clark Kent (Earth-96)
   , the real Paragon of Truth. Ryan goes onto say that there are a lot of ways to describe Lex Luthor...But that he personally finds douchebag to be the most descriptive. He finishes his letter by saying that as for  Barry Allen, AKA The Flash, AKA the Paragon of Love is just gone. Missing.

   Oliver also adds that there are fewer things more powerful in the universe than memory and connection. So he's using their memories of their friends and closest allies to keep all of them from falling  out of the Speed Force. Because if they do fall out of the Speed Force, they will be  consumed by antimatter like everyone else before them. Oliver explains that he can buy Barry time but that he needs to get to each of them before it's too late. Barry argues that the Speed Force is infinite, and he wouldn't know where to look. Oliver tells him before he disappears, to remember what he just said about memories and connections. He goes on to say that he needs to take into account their greatest victories, their most crushing defeats, and the moments when the bonds between them were forged.

Barry says no, that he's The Flash, but the other Barry Allen has no idea what Earth-1 Barry is even talking about. Earth-1 Barry says it's complicated. The other Flash tells Earth-1 Flash that he likes his outfit and that it looks very comfy. Earth-1 Barry tells the other Flash, he likes his suit too and says that it seems safe and  cool.
