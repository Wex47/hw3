   Sara pours a drink out for Oliver, while Kate and Kara look on. Sara points out that Oliver died a hero, saving a billion lives in the process. Kara then asks if they aren't going to wait for Barry, but Kate replies that she doesn't think he's ready to say goodbye to his friend just yet.
Kara refuses to drink, saying that it feels like giving up, and believes that there's a way to undo the

Sarah however, mentions that she kinda promised their crew that they wouldn't have to do another crossover. Harbinger replies that they don't need Sara's crew; just Ray's lab, and they have an entire

   When the Waverider arrives on Earth-1, the Monitor says that they've suffered a horrible loss. However, there are seven heroes of the purest will. Clark and Kara try to comfort Jonathan, but the baby doesn't settle down until Mick takes him. The Monitor says that the seven heroes are
   Paragons
   , and he only learned of them by consulting the
   Book of Destiny
   . When Kate asked The Monitor where he got these names and pseudonyms, he answers that he enlisted the help of

   . Who earned the wisdom from a second book. He summons the aforementioned Book and explains that he went into the time-stream and retrieved the book. As Mia arrives, Kara asks if the Book can bring back the destroyed Earths. The Monitor warns that it would cause madness, and Mia asks if the Book can bring Oliver back. Mar Novu says that it's impossible and that he grows weaker as the Anti-Monitor grows stronger. The Monitor tells them that Kara is the Paragon of Hope. Sara is the Paragon of Destiny, and one of the others is a Kryptonian who is the Paragon of Truth. Clark and Lois offer to find him, and the Monitor says that the fourth Paragon is of Courage and is known only as the "Bat of the Future". The Tome of the Guardians revealed Kara and Sara's names to him and the descriptions for the other two. 
They also all collectively find out that
   Bruce Wayne
   is the Dark Knight, with Kate asking if they could all keep that to themselves. Kate then asks the others who wanted to meet
   Batman

So he resurrected him after he'd been killed. As Kate comes in, the Monitor explains that he had the power to bring Lex back before the Crisis began. Kara refuses to work with Lex as an ally, and Kate meets Lex and introduces herself as new &amp; unfriendly.
