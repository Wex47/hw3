   Clark and Lois, who were enjoying their peaceful time with their son in
   Argo City
   , received a holographic message from
   Kara Danvers
   , warning them of the city's impending destruction by
   antimatter
   . They evacuated John to his pod with help from
   Alura Zor-El
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b11e483e-cff9-4942-9edd-be8c4d601d1e">
   Jonathan's pod took off just seconds before the city perished. Though his evacuation was successful, the antimatter knocked Jonathan's pod off-course, which in turn landed him on
   Earth-16
   . Lois traveled there with
   Querl Dox
   and
   Sara Lance
   in tow, and found Jonathan inside the
   Arrowcave
   , where he had been rescued by
   Oliver Queen
   . Lois, Jonathan, Brainy, and Sara then returned to
   Earth-38
   .

   Soon after, they evacuated to

His father congratulated him and after an embarrassing minute, he left the room, leaving Jonathan and Eliza talking. The next morning, while drinking coffee, Jonathan overheard his parents talking about his grandmother
   Martha
   , he asked if they would see her in Smallville, Clark said they were late and Jonathan said Smallville is boring. When Jordan came in, Jonathan questioned him about his outfit, with Jordan answering him sarcastically. Then they went to school.

   her family
   arriving, he warned Jordan and they went over to meet them with his parents, Sarah said she was sorry for his loss, when his parents left, they talked about the summer they met.

   Sarah then asks for a phone number from one of them, Jonathan thinks it's his but actually Jordan's. Sarah then picks up the phone and says that there will be a bonfire tomorrow and he can go. Jordan tries to impress Sarah by climbing on the scaffold without a ladder to reach the router, but he falls hard on the ground when the straps that hold the steel beams are broken. Jonathan then tries to save his brother from the steel beams by jumping in front of him, but Jordan manages to turn them over and save them both. Sarah alerts Clark, who finds the boys, and quickly takes the steel beams off them.

   Then, a doctor examines them and says that they only have mild concussions. Jonathan asked the doctor if his diagnoses are correct and Clark says the two are lucky. Then they go to their rooms. Jonathan says he missed training for the week and Jordan asks him if he really cares about it now. Jonathan said that if he wants to stick to something, it must be Sarah Cushing. He takes Jordan's cell phone and mocks the message the other one sent to Sarah, calling him freaky.

   The next morning, Jonathan and Jordan investigate the barn; Jordan finds it strange that they are not dead. Their search reveals a

Jonathan then says that Jordan can control, which is like learning to drive, if the cars were indestructible and with giant lasers. His parents scold him and he goes to his room. Jonathan is happy that he does not have powers; it proves that his athleticism is human, not half-alien. The next morning, the twins talk to Sarah about what happened the night before.

   Fortress of Solitude

   At the time of football training, they sabotaged and humiliated him, preventing him from receiving the team manual, frustrating him and making him angry for having moved. When Clark and Jordan returned home, he heard his brother complain that he was not special as he believed, and the two started to argue until Lois appeased the situation and the two went to their rooms. Then they went to the
   Cushing family
   barbecue, where they met Sarah and Sophie Cushing. He also talked to Eliza in a video call. That night, they reconciled and Jonathan promised to help Jordan discover the truth about his powers.

   The next morning, they were trying to paint the house until Clark heard something and had to leave. Then they went to school, where Sean and other members of the football team intimidated Jordan, despite Jonathan's efforts to protect him. Then his father suddenly showed up at school, making the bullies go away and making the twins angry. Later, Jonathan was at football practice when Tag warned him that his brother was coming to participate. Jonathan tried to convince Jordan that it was a bad idea, but he was insistent and secretly using his powers, he proved to be dominant on the field. Jonathan then got angry because his brother suddenly decided to succeed in something that was always outside of him,

  <p key="b792191d-c861-4090-a0dc-c61ff30f1a0e">
   and asked why he was playing and that he always hated sports. They also chatted with Sarah at
   Victoria May's
   , until Lana came out and yelled her out. When his parents learned that Jordan had joined the team, they forbade him to play. Jonathan was initially pleased but when he spoke to Jordan to make sure he was okay, he realized how depressed Jordan was. He realized that another player sent a message to Jordan, who had never had friends, and then he realized that playing on the team was the best for him. Jonathan then convinced Clark to let Jordan play for the team, telling him how his confidence and social skills had improved while playing on the team.

They found him suffering immense pain due to the uncontrollable vibration. Jon wanted to call Clark for help, but Jordan reminded him of Sam's warnings, and blaming himself for Tag's situation, tried to help him. Tag threw Jordan away, knocking him unconscious, so Jon used the signaling device to call Clark. When he arrived, Jon saw as his dad carried Tag into the atmosphere, where he passed out. Back at home, Jonathan admitted to Jordan that he was jealous of him and assured him that he was not responsible for Tag's condition. Clark then asked why the twins waited so long to call him when they learned the truth about Tag and he and Jordan revealed Sam's order to disturb their father with their problems, to the joint fury of their parents.

Jon invited her to visit Smallville for the annual Harvest Festival, and although she initially agreed to come, but she breaks up with him. When they return home, Lois goes to console him. Jon later told his parents that he wanted to move back to Metropolis, as a friend of his had agreed to let him stay with them. At the Festival, Jon met up with Timmy Ryan and another boy, and got drunk on liquor they had brought with them. They drunkenly made fun of Jordan and Sarah Cushing, and Sarah stormed off in disgust at his behaviour. Jon apologised to Jordan but when their parents found them they found he was drunk and sent them to home. At home, Clark told him that he would not be punished, but asked him to give Smallville a chance, telling him they would discuss allowing him to move to Metropolis if he was unable to find happiness here.

   Jonathan has been described as modest and kind-hearted, with an aw-shucks attitude that somehow doesn't seem dated. While his twin brother Jordan is quite timid and closed off, Jonathan is social and confident. His father has said that things seem to come easy to Jonathan, seen with how popular he is in conjunction with an athletic prowess that has given him a shot a being the quarterback of the football team as a freshman. Jonathan also seems to have inherited his father's bravery and compassion as he tried to help Tag despite how much of a hard time he had given him since he arrived.
  </p>
  <p key="fca67c33-c119-4687-a1bc-2d9bacc2a312">
   Jonathan seems to have a healthy relationship with both of his parents. He seems able to talk with his mother about personal issues and seems to actively let his father know what's going on with his life. Though, he was upset when he learned that both of his parents were hiding the fact that his father was really Superman, lying to both him and Jordan all their lives. Yet, it seems that he is quickly adjusting to this new revelation.
  </p>
  <p key="c985f582-af68-4633-b057-e1bc415d54a4">
   Jonathan is protective of Jordan, encouraging him to socialize with his childhood friend,
    Sarah Cushing
    and impulsively jumping to try and shield him from the poles or defending him when he was attacked by teens at the bonfire. He also chose to leave his life in Metropolis behind as he realized that coming to Smallville would help his brother adjust to the new changes he seemed to be going through. While it was clearly a hard decision, and one that he is struggling with, he bares through it as best as he can for his brother's sake and even told Jordan that he would be there to help him navigate through whatever was happening to him if no one else would. He also on occasion teases and banters with Jordan like any other sibling though doesn't seem to mean any ill will by it. Though they did go on to have an intense argument, they quickly made up can't stay mad at each other.

  <p key="d0c7722d-0999-4707-9667-505ff08bce19">
   However, despite this, Jonathan's patients and tolerance towards Jordan's antics does have it's limits, after Jordan broke his wrist well he was trying to prevent him from hurting
    Jimmy Cutter
    after the latter had taunted him, as Jordan let his emotions get the better of him again, he was extremely furious.
  </p>
  <p key="f46936a8-d155-48d2-9cf6-96a86883af83">
   Later, when Jordan eavesdropped on Jonathan's conversation with Sarah (via super hearing) and accused him of trying to move in on Sarah, he became extremely furious and puts Jordan in his place, coldly stating that he has always had his back whenever someone called him stupid, weird or outward; as he never believed any of it; because it is not true, Jonathan also stated to Jordan to never spy on him again.

     Peak of human physical condition:
    </b>
    Jonathan is a physical specimen and a talented athlete. At a young age, he was able to easily rip through a rope by throwing a football at it. Before moving to Smallville, he was slated to be the first freshman to be starting quarterback for his varsity football team at one of the most competitive high schools in the United States of America. His performance on the field is so impressive that his parents speculated he might have inherited latent
     Kryptonian
     genes from his father and unknowingly used them. Jonathan is overall in excellent shape and sports a well-muscled build. He also has quick reflexes, as he went to cover Jordan when metal poles fell on him. He is also tough, as he only received a mild concussion from the poles landing on them, and strong enough to briefly overpower Sean and his friends in a fight, he was even able to easily pick up and swing
     John Henry Irons' hammer
     . Jonathan has also been referred to as a "star quarterback."
