Alex calms down with the arrivals of everyone Lyla has collected. She has brought with her eight individuals, including Kara's cousin Superman and Lois Lane. Supergirl is relieved that they survived, and they inform her Lyla was the one who brought them here before Argo exploded.

Supergirl tells him not to say things like that, she knows baby Jonathan will be safe and they will save everyone no matter what. Superman is rather surprised at how hopeful she is, Supergirl just insists that's all they can do.

   While outside the tower, the six heroes are again left disappointed when the tower breaks. Oliver tells Superman and Supergirl to see what they can do and they both fly up, Superman realizes the tower is powered by what looks like solar panels and immediately begins blasting it with his heat vision, Supergirl follows suit. They continue to blast at the solar panel for as long as they can, Superman is the first to fall, followed soon by Supergirl. Luckily it was enough to power up the tower again. The red skies dissipate but they are still faced with flying angry spirits, and they now have only 14 minutes until the tower shuts down again. Everyone begins fighting them full throttle but The Monitor appears insisting they save their strength, this world is already doomed and he begins vanishing in them away one by one. First Batwoman, followed by Superman, Supergirl, he also takes the Flash, Ray, and Mia. Only Green Arrow is left. Before he can take him, Oliver demands to know how many people are left, and The Monitor admits there are still many that won't be saved. Oliver refuses to leave and shoots The Monitor with an antimatter arrow, disrupting his powers. Oliver is struck by one of the flying spirits and loses his footing, only to realize he is out of arrows. Not wanting to give up, Oliver takes a stand and decides to continue to fight with his bare hands, even if it is in vain, wanting to save as many people as he can.

   Oliver appears in his lair, extremely bloody and bruised, on the verge of dying. He is immediately surrounded by The Flash, Supergirl and his daughter Mia. There, The Monitor tells the room, Earth- 38 did not survive, but because of Oliver Queen's noble sacrifice, he was able to personally ensure the lives of another billion people. Kara is both devastated at the news of the loss of her planet, along with the reality of her friend Green Arrow's pending demise.
