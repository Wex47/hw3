   to recover and focus on himself. He soon received and accepted a new job at the
   Time Bureau
   , where he runs the magic department.
   After Ray was possessed by
   Neron
   , Nate rejoined the Legends to aid his friends in bringing Ray back, continue his relationship with Zari, and help her care for
   Wickstable
   .
   Nate let himself be killed in order to destroy the demon and save Ray, but his father's spirit and the Legends used magical music to bring him back to life. Zari disappeared since her future changed and her brother

   However after being briefly subjected to hypnosis it was shown that he unconsciously remembers things about Zari from the original timeline.

   Later Nate met the new version of Zari and realized that she was the product of the events that took place at Heyworld. Nate also learned about their now erased relationship and was dismayed that the current Zari was much different than the one he fell in love with. He later found out that the original Zari's consciousness and spirit still existed thanks to the
   Air Totem
   and were influencing the current Zari's actions and behavior. As she possessed her counterpart, the pair was finally reunited, with Nate's memories fully restored, before Charlie used her powers as a Fate to give the original Zari her own body to use. However, Nate and Zari were forced to part ways once again when Zari returned to the Air Totem to save Behrad's life.

   In addition, Nate was always interested in stories about his
   paternal grandfather
   , eventually getting his soldier "dog tags" passed down to him.
   Nate didn't have the best relationship with his father and always referred to him as "Hank".
   Eventually Nate left home at sixteen for college. He studied abroad at Oxford for a year while completing his master's degree, during which time he dated a girl named Wendy and read an unpublished paper by
   J.R.R. Tolkien

Mick confirmed Nate's findings and suspicion and, on Oliver's advice, the two decided to travel through time and gather the Legends' members that have been scattered throughout time, due to the ship's emergency function before it was hit by a nuke in 1942.

   Nate and Mick eventually located and saved all team members sans Rip Hunter, before setting up to safeguard both
   Albert Einstein
   and
   Mileva Maric
   in case the Nazis, or a rogue time traveler, tried to kidnap them once again. The Legends, with Nate as the newest member, appeared in 1942 prior to Albert Einstein's physics symposium in the guise of CIA, convincing the big guy to tell the public of his ex-wife's accomplishments. Einstein happily obliged, making Mileva's support of his research public, and thus prompting the United States government to safeguard them both. Nate listened to Einstein's speech with wonder and adoration, barely able to believe that they changed history for the better. As Nate was ready to leave the premises along with the other Legends, they were halted by the
   Justice Society of America

   Nate was excited to meet the JSA, in particular, Commander Steel. The Legends tried to negotiate with the JSA but they insisted on taking them into custody with Nate being knocked out by Commander Steel with a punch. Imprisoned by the JSA, Nate revealed exactly who they were to the rest of the team though Commander Steel thought they were Nazi spies. Nate then revealed that he was wearing the same dog tags that he was and explained to Henry Heywood/Commander Steel that he was his future grandson. They then met Rex Tyler though he insisted that he never met the Legends before and asked them to leave as they had a new mission in Paris.

   at first intended to bid Nate goodbye, concerned with his unpreparedness for the dangerous adventure as an untrained historian, Nate vehemently opposed this, wanting to finally do something with his life. He then found that his dog tags were missing which meant history had changed and learned that the JSA never returned from Paris. Nate then revealed that he spoke six languages and Sara wondered why he became a historian due to his background though he said it was complicated. They infiltrated the nightclub where the JSA's target, a Nazi named
   Krieger
   was arranging an exchange. A fight broke out in the club that had Nate getting injured. The JSA agreed to work together when they revealed that they never returned from this mission. Sara then learned that Nate had hemophilia meaning that his blood didn't clot normally and that was why he was sheltered his whole life but Nate refused to back down because he finally felt alive. He then visited his grandfather and wondered why the man seemed to be shutting him out and he revealed that his hero worship of him frightened him as he did what he did so others, like him, didn't have to. Nate told him that he just wanted to be a hero like him but couldn't because of his affliction but Henry told him that he didn't have to be a soldier to be a hero.

   When the mission to intercept Krieger went south due to him transforming to a berserker creature due to a serum, Amaya Jiwe and Ray Palmer were captured. The Legends and JSA went to rescue them but Henry was left behind to get caught in the bombing run. Nate went to rescue him with a motorbike but they managed to get caught just outside the bombing radius and Nate was injured. His body wasn't healing due to his blood not clotting and was starting to die. Ray then injected Nate with the serum that he stole and modified and his body started to immediately recover. When he came to, he saw that his grandfather had been watching him and hoping to speak to him before they left. Henry told him that it appeared that he was a hero after all. Nate and his grandfather then saw his dogtags had returned which meant that history was back on track.

As Sara and Amaya came to an agreement, they watched Nate excitedly testing his powers with Ray, taking shots from the
   A.T.O.M. Exosuit
   . In their excitement, the two vigilantes ended up damaging the ship and then freefalling through the timestream and out of the Temporal Zone, ending up in mid-17th century
   Japan
   . Awed by his historical surroundings, Nate passed out, before being found by
   Masako Yamashiro
   , a local villager. Despite it being dangerous for the villagers to assist a gaijin under the tyrannical rule of Shogun
   Tokugawa Iemitsu
   , Masako and her father,
   Ichiro Yamashiro
   , nursed Nate to health. Masako gave Nate a bath, telling him of her unfortunate story of being betrothed to the cruel Iemitsu. Refusing to accept injustice, Nate tried to challenge the Shogun's Samurai, who arrived to the village to inform Masako of the coming wedding day, but ended up unable to activate his powers, getting flattened by an armored samurai, and heavily wounded once again.

  <p key="c5823070-7218-4fe8-9d52-0abd0391cde1">

   . Recovering from his wounds, Nate was being trained by Ray to reconnect to his abilities, but to no avail. Masako imparted him with wisdom that, to Ray, sounded reminiscent of that of a fictional character, Master Yoda, whom he claimed to have been his sensei. As the Shogun and his men approached the village, Nate came out to oppose him, but, once again, couldn't activate his powers, sustaining heavy damage from the Exosuit's light blast, getting knocked out. He eventually recovered, just in time to save Ray and Masako from being slain by
   Tokugawa Iemitsu
   . Transforming into his meta-human Steel form, Nate grabbed the Shogun's sword, then, together with Ray, confused him in the duel, before catching the
   Yamashiro family katana
   thrown by Ray and destroying the Exosuit's alpha-stabilizer with it, leading to a somatic overload that had the suit blown up, along with the tyrannical Iemitsu. Nate checked on Masako, who praised him for blowing up the Exosuit, before going to comfort Ray, who was proud that Nate had "steeled on" and embraced him. As the village celebrated, Masako tried to persuade Nate to take the katana with him, but he disagreed, saying that she was just as worthy to be its wielder. Nate thought to ask Masako if she'd be interested in continuing their relationship, but she pragmatically noted that as he "came from the sky", he'd have to return, and it was impossible. The two parted with one last kiss.

Notified about an aberration caused by Merlyn and Darhk in Hollywood, 1967, Nate went on a mission with the other Legends.

This caused another aberration, changing the personal timelines of Ray and Nate, who, without watching Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies, were now never inspired to pursue their respective academia. This led Nate to become a yoga instructor instead.

   As the aberration started to set in, Nate's meta-human powers and Ray's

   also disappeared. Trying to now, hunt down both Lucas and the Spear, the two ended up trapped with George and Amaya in a trash compactor by Darhk and Merlyn, forced to find and give them the spear. As the four were about to be killed, Nate, Ray and Amaya pleaded with Lucas to believe in himself and reaffirm his wish to dedicate his life to filmmaking. Now ready to believe in the impossible, George shouted about how much he'd want to direct, removing the aberration and giving Nate and Ray their powers back. With them all back to normal they escaped from the villains' trap, along with the piece of Spear and even took back the medallion. It seemed like they would be able to defeat Darhk and Merlyn but then their speedster enemy reappeared and turned the tide of the battle back for the Legion. Rip Hunter then appeared, seemingly have gotten his memory back but it was quickly seen as just an act to try and distract the Legion. Nate and his team watched as the Legion captured him and then retreated.

   Nate was trying to find some clues to the identity of their speedster enemy when Martin revealed that he had caused an aberration which resulted in him having a daughter,
   Lily

He and the others kept trying to find the speedster's identity when Nate realized that perhaps the reason they couldn't find anything about him was because he had somehow been wiped out of existence but was still somehow around.

   Nate and Amaya were talking about how they loved what they did though they would like to get off the ship at times when they were docked in the Temporal Zone. Nate began to talk of dating in the future and how it was different from 'courting' in Amaya's time when there was a massive time quake that made her fall into his arms. The quake was from
   Christmas
   of 1776 which Nate knew was when
   George Washington
   crossed the Delaware during the American Revolution. The team learned that Washington had been killed. They figured it was a trap by the Legion but they had to save Washington. Nate and Amaya posed as wealthy newlyweds which caused a few heads to turn because of the racial prejudices of the time. They were then attacked by Redcoats wielding automatic weapons and Nate shielded Amaya from the bullet barrage with his steel body. They returned to the

Nate and Amaya went on the trail to get back both Mick and Washington but were ambushed and Nate ended up falling into the freezing river but was saved by Amaya. She heated him up with her body heat to keep him from succumbing to Hypothermia and ended up sleeping together. After, they quickly reached the British camp and helped Rory and Washington escape.

   The team then found that Lily's algorithm had located a fragment of the spear in 3000 A.D. While most of the team was excited to travel to the future, Nate wasn't too thrilled with the idea. Amaya told him that if he didn't want to go then he should just stay on the ship. When the team discovered
   Dr. Mid-Nite
   dead and the spear gone, they realized that Rip must've had something to do with the JSA. They then found another fragment in 507 A.D. in Britannia. Nate was excited to be back in the past though immediately shot down Ray's expectations of knights and jousts based on Arthurian lore. He also commented that what the medieval times weren't like the stories that the team seemed to grow up on when they were suddenly surrounded by knights. Ray then spoke to them in a dialect that Nate hissed was incorrect, however, it pacified the knights. One of them revealed themselves to be
   Guinevere
   , the queen of
   Camelot
   . When they were taken to Camelot, Nate quickly commented that this place shouldn't exist at all. They were taken before
   King Arthur

   Nate, Ray and Jax feasted together in the castle when Ray pointed out

When Arthur returned from a hunt, it looked like he had captured the Black Knight that was terrorizing his kingdom. However, it was seen that it was a trap set up by Damien Darhk and Rip Hunter who had Arthur under their control from futuristic mind control tech. They demanded the spear fragment in return for Arthur and Camelot's safety. Nate was present for Guinevere speaking to the knights and calling them to fight and protect their kingdom from Darhk's army. He told Ray that they all didn't stand a chance and if it was worth it for a dream and Ray told him that it was as that dream meant the world to him once. As Ray left to join up with the knights, Nate looked through a manuscript of Arthurian lore and saw an image of Ray at his funeral.

   When Amaya and Sara found the spear fragment and were preparing to leave, Nate went to collect Ray. He had taken Galahad's sword and infused it with Ionic energy from his suit. Nate then told him that they were leaving as they found the spear but Ray refused to leave as he couldn't abandon the knights. Nate then told Ray about his death but Ray was determined to stay.

Amaya told him that they couldn't risk losing another fragment to the Legion and that it was Ray's choice but Nate wouldn't have it. The team then realized that they couldn't abandon Ray, Stargirl or Guinevere's army. Nate headed to the battlefield with Amaya and Sara and when Ray asked if he came to fight for an imaginary kingdom after all, he told him that he came to fight for his dumb friend. When Ray left to try and stop Darhk from getting away, Nate yelled after him and eventually followed him, finding him seemingly dead after Darhk shot him and escaped. Nate panicked until it was revealed that Ray had been wearing his suit under the army for extra protection due to Nate's warning. Back at the ship, Nate admitted that maybe legend and history weren't so different as both could teach future generations and help them reveal who they could be.

   Nate started getting nervous when Gideon couldn't locate the final fragment of the spear that was carried by his grandfather. Everyone, including Amaya, assured Nate that they would find Commander Steel before the Legion did. However, Rip Hunter managed to override the ship's controls and had swiped the medallion. Nate moved to intercept him with Amaya and Rory. They cornered him before he could escape and he went and destroyed the medallion in front of them before Rory knocked him out. The

Nate went with Ray and Amaya to look for it though his heart wasn't too into it as they had now lost the medallion. Amaya managed to cheer him up when she helped to take a snake that was wrapping around him and sent it on its way. Nate moved to give Amaya a kiss but Ray had interrupted when he tried to warn them of a T-Rex named Gertrude had locked in on his scent. They then learned that Gertrude had a grudge against Ray for stealing one of her eggs to eat when he was there last time.

   They then regrouped in a hut that Ray had built for himself when he was stranded in this time. Ray offered to catch an iguana for them to eat but Nate told him that he brought energy bars from the ship. Ray left the two of them alone and Nate and Amaya were ready to try and kiss again when Ray quickly came back with his catch before they could. Later that night, when Amaya left to gather firewood, Ray went over to Nate and told him that he couldn't be with Amaya as she had a future to go back to in 1942. He told him about his granddaughter

The next day, the group found the part they were looking for in Gertrude's nest. They managed to get it but Gertrude returned. Nate and Ray were ready to fight but Amaya used the power of her totem to pacify the dinosaur to their amazement. Nate assured Ray that he would stop his relationship with Amaya though when she told him that she would be waiting for him in her room, he told himself that he would start tomorrow.

   Rip Hunter revealed to the team that he left Henry Heywood in 1965, Manhattan. Nate went with Rip, Amaya and Sara to a moment after Rip had left Henry to find that he was gone. They went back to the ship and reviewed clues to where he could've gone and found a news clipping image of Henry as a mission control manager of NASA in 1970 for the Apollo-13. They went to 1970 and Nate was reunited with his grandfather. He informed the Legends that he left his fragment of the spear on the moon in Neil Armstrong's flag which Nate thought was very clever. They moved to retrieve it when they learned that history had already changed since the Apollo-13 avoided a catastrophe that it was originally supposed to have. Nate's grandfather was cold with Rip Hunter for leaving him in 1965 and forcing his wife to raise their son by herself though Nate told him that Rip lost his family. Henry then suggested that he go back to 1956 and have it so it would be like he never left and Nate was happy at the thought of his father being able to have his own father back in his life and possibly making the man not become as cold as he presently was. Amaya then confronted Nate about the ramifications of changing his father's childhood as that would effect how Nate turned out himself but Nate was sure that events would be altered for the better. Amaya then informed Henry about the truth of time travel and the risks of going back to his son would have on how he grew up and what it could do to Nate. Henry asked Nate why he didn't tell him of all this before but Nate told Henry that his father needed him. Henry then reminded Nate that they can't forget that the mission must come first for the greater good, even over their own family. Nate became angry with Amaya for telling Henry about the risks but Amaya told him that it would change who Nate was and she liked who he was. Nate however told Amaya that they didn't have a future together and she had a destiny to go back to in 1942. He then spitefully alluded to her granddaughter and the fate of her village and asked her if she would still choose history over family. Nate went with the others to meet up with Ray as they picked him up from the moon with speedster weapons ready as he also brought in Thawne as their prisoner.

   Before they could return to Earth, Stein and Rory contacted the team to tell them that Nate's young father Hank had arrived because he won a contest to see Apollo's mission command. Henry then revealed that he had rigged a contest because he wanted a chance to meet his son. When the ship needed to be angled a certain way to re-enter the atmosphere, the team saw that someone would have to open the cargo bay door but that person would be killed. Nate saw to his horror that his grandfather was missing. He then ran off in time to see that Henry had closed the door into the cargo bay trapping him inside. Nate frantically tried to tell his grandfather that his son was waiting for him back on Earth but Henry told Nate that he had to do this. He also made Nate promise to destroy the spear so that this wouldn't happen again. He then watched as his grandfather opened the door to angle the ship and was then sucked out into space.

   After losing his grandfather, Nate grew depressed, becoming apathetic toward the entire mission. However, he perked up after learning that the Spear, when burned with fire, displays a secret message, one that translates to, "Born of blood, undone by blood".

   Jesus Christ

Nate filled him in on what they were looking for and managed to convince Tolkien by talking about how the darkness of the war will pass one day, and how they're fighting a much bigger battle for the sake of humanity. In the long run, Nate's kind words and heroic actions as Steel convinced Tolkien that the latter's not a coward, and gave him ideas for his future book series;

   Nate took Tolkien with them when the team went to check out the chapel where the research said that Sir Gawain's remains could be found along with the blood of Christ. Mick found a golden goblet which helped both Nate and Tolkien navigate through the clues in the chapel's floor that led to the pillar where Gawain's remains were. However, they didn't find the blood with him, but a shield with an engraving. The team was then surprised with the sudden arrival of
   Leonard Snart

   The team was trying to come up with a way to get to the blood without getting killed from the warfare raging on the plain. Amaya proposed that they use the spear's power to erase the Legion but Sara and Rip were against the idea as the spear's power was too great and could tempt anyone. Eventually, they came up with a plan to get the two armies to call a cease fire. Nate left Tolkien with his regiment and then went off with Sara, Amaya and Mick to get the blood. They found a flask of it in a box buried in the middle of the field. However, Snart and Darhk arrived and held them at gunpoint, demanding the spear. Mick had it and when Sara grabbed the blood from Nate to destroy it, Mick took it away. He decided to use the spear to spare his own past and even asked Amaya to come with him but refused. Snart then threw a bomb into the air to spark the fighting back up between the two warring sides. Nate took cover and then tried to save the flask of Christ's blood but the gunfire shattered and destroyed it. He then watched as Thawne sped through and took Darhk, Snart and Mick to safety.

   Back on the ship, Nate was lamenting on everything that had happened. He especially was upset about failing Tolkien as he had given him hope for a better future and instead had him cured of his disease so that he could return to the horror of the war trenches. He wanted to go back in time and prevent Tolkien from ever having been involved, no doubt ruining the future impact of his stories, but Rip pointed out that with the spear in the Legion's hands that might be a mute point. However, Nate still had hope as he guessed that even though the Legion had the spear, they didn't know how to use it. What he didn't know was that they had acquired the means to use it and his reality was then changed along with everyone else's.

   Nate's life was altered so that he became a conspiracy theorist that ran a site that only his mother really read and he lived out of her basement. He began to have 'reality scars' which made him look into how the current reality was not right. He decided to go to Eobard Thawne of S.T.A.R. Labs to get his help to make sense of things, not realizing that he was going to the ones responsible. He managed to get through Thawne's security and made it to his lab where he found Thawne with Snart and Rory. Thawne listened to his theories and told Nate that he was onto something. Nate was happy that Thawne seemed to believe him but that went away when Thawne ordered for Snart and Rory to kill him. They took him out to the woods outside Central City to kill him though Nate didn't understand why, until he realized that his theories were all correct. Snart was ready to kill him but Rory stepped in and stopped him as he was starting to think that the changes to reality weren't what he hoped they would be. He then told Nate about the Legion and the spear and drove him to find Ray as he felt that he was their only chance.

   Nate and Rory found Ray in a run down apartment, as he had been made a lowly janitor for Star Labs. However, Ray told them that he felt that things in the world weren't right either and made a device to try and undo changes done to the mind. Rory took it and used it on Nate and he instantly remembered everything, and he quickly punched Rory for his betrayal. They then restored Ray and were about to try and find the others, when Sara and Amaya barged in on them. At first, Nate and Ray were happy to see them but Rory informed them that they didn't know who they were and worked for Damien Darhk in this reality. Nate also realized that even though he had his memories back, he no longer had his powers but still tried to get through to Amaya but couldn't reach her as she and Sara tried to kill them. They managed to drive Amaya away and then restored Sara's memories. To avoid the Legion finding them they had to go into hiding and Nate brought them to his basement as he felt that would be the last place the Legion would look. Sara went to go get Amaya back, and then Jax, and they regrouped in Nate's basement. Jax then told them of Thawne's new project, a thermal reactor, which they realized he was going to use to destroy the spear and make this reality permanent. They then made the choice to try and get the spear back before that could happen and have Amaya use it to reset things back to how they were. Nate was able to find the incantation, with Rory's help, but the group felt that they couldn't trust Rory after what he had done.

   They infiltrated S.T.A.R. Labs' new reactor but Stein, still under Thawne's influence, managed to alert the speedster. Thawne had the spear in his possession and called for his security force to surround the Legends. Stein then revealed that the reactor was complete and Thawne was about to toss the spear in to destroy it but the rest of the Legion arrived, with Mick, intent on betraying him and taking the spear for themselves. This caused a small fight to break out with everyone trying to get the spear. Nate managed to grab it but Darhk got to him. Thawne sped for them but Nate used it to launch the speedster across the room and knock him out. As soon as he did, Darhk then knocked him aside and took the spear from him. The spear kept changing hands before Mick got his hands on it and then chose to give it to Amaya to set things right. However, Nate watched in horror as Snart used his Cold Gun to freeze Amaya and then kill her by shattering her to pieces. Soon after, Thawne regained himself and stole back the spear and then tossed it into his reactor, destroying it and cementing the reality. Thawne then chose to spare the Legends so that they could spend the rest of their lives living in agony and defeat in the new world as he felt that was a fate worse than death for them. They all returned to his apartment, unsure of what to do now that the spear was destroyed. Sara then proposed that the only move they had left was to go back in time and stop the Legion from ever getting the spear in the first place, but for that they needed to find where Rip and the

Jax asked what would happen if they did manage to destroy the spear and they all realized that they would be erased as they wouldn't exist if the Legion never got it, making them the aberrations. The team tried to get the blood of Christ to leave it for their old selves to find but Thawne guessed what they were up to and arrived to destroy the blood. He then went and killed Ray. They then decided to try and sneak aboard the ship and steal the spear and simply time jump away with it. Nate went with Rip and Mick to the ship while their past selves went to the church with Tolkien. Nate went to the library where the past Stein and Jax were and told them that the mission to the church was a dead end but was taken aback when he saw Amaya again, alive. He then tried to point the team to the Galapagos Islands and left to rejoin the others. They had been waiting and he apologized for getting held up but found they couldn't leave as their past selves were returning. Jax and Stein realized they weren't the true them and attacked them but their past selves then realized that they were the future versions of themselves and not the Legion in disguise.

Nate and the others, save for Present Sara, were knocked out by the multiple speedsters. Sara quickly used the spear to depower it before

They arrived in Los Angeles, 2017, to find that the past, present and future were all jumbled together as a result of them interacting with themselves.

   P.T. Barnum

After Barnum offered to give them a "private show", a cover for his kidnapping them for the circus, Nate declined in order to talk to Amaya, but ended up passing out in the cargo bay, where he was found by Sara, Mick and Amaya. After finding Ray and Jax dressed as conjoined twins in the circus tent, Nate and Amaya attempted to free them, but were in turn captured by Barnum's troupe. While in captivity, Nate expressed how mad he was at Amaya for leaving him on his birthday to go back to Zambesi. Amaya revealed to Nate that she had gone to Detroit to see Mari first before going to Rip to send her back to 1942 to prevent Mari from disappearing.

   Nate stayed awake for the following nights, looking for a pattern between anachronisms. He managed to find it, discovering a surprising thing - two of them did not fit the pattern. The first was 2042, from which legends took Zari, and the next was 1895, which they decided to go to. As it turned out, their problem was a vampire who sucked blood from victims and tossed their bodies in random places, but there was no evidence of his existence. The investigation led them to an excavated grave from which Rip Hunter emerged. Upon returning on board, the director of the Time Office revealed that he was on a secret, even for his own organization, mission following a certain

After some time, Rip and Sara came to their friend to help, discovering that it was Damien Darhk who was about to be resurrected.

The man was not going to fight the legends, wanting to compromise. Sara, however, did not agree, took Helena to the Waverider and ran away with her friends. When things seemed to be going their way, Martin Stein in Jax's body stood up for

   Mick's father

All this time Heywood tried to make Mick realize that his father wasn't so bad, but Mick found out for himself in the evening, during a frank conversation around the fire. Eventually, the soldiers reached the desired location, where the "beast" lay - the source of their problems. Due to his insubordination, Nate was stunned when the armed men entered enemy territory. Dick was going to kill all the campers, but Rory explained to him that it was pointless, threatening him with a gun and saying he had a lot to lose. After all the confusion and the anachronism were over, the team returned to the ship to eat a cake from
   President Johnson

During this time, the man was tortured by Damien, who was struggling with a crisis. He did not trust his daughter, who had been possessed by a demon, and he talked with the bound hero about his feelings until Eleanor stunned his father. At the last moment, Vixen and Kid Flash arrived and began to fight the enemy. The moment of inattention was used by Kuasa, who freed Heywood. Mallus was unstoppable in his present form, but his focus was on the betrayal of his former ally, who had been ripped from the heart by the totem of water, killing her in front of her grandmother. Jiwe was ready to fight and avenge the murder of her granddaughter, but West and Heywood managed to pull her away and escape to the ship. There, Amaya told Nate that she still did not know what she wanted in life and went secretly on the Jumpship, with which she went to Zambezi in 1992.

   When Nate saw that Amaya was gone, he immediately notified the team. As if that were not enough, Rip Hunter needed help to distract Grodd from the young Barack Obama. Nate and Wally were sent to stop Jiwe from doing the foolishness. Unfortunately, they arrived too late and witnessed the handing over of Anansi's totem, without her successor - daughter Amai. Immediately after that, the men began looking for a friend who was responsible for everything, who finally persuaded Heywood to help. Wally was not convinced of this plan, knowing what he had led Barry to with "Flashpoint", but decided to support his friends anyway. Nate managed to steal the old totem Amai, not expecting that she would wake up and attack him with full verve. The woman acted as if she didn't remember the man, but eventually decided to listen to him and used the advice she had given to her daughter. Thus, Esi accepted her heritage, and the three legends were able to return to the Waverider. There, it turned out that the team did not mind the anachronism created by Amaya, as they wanted to use the phenomenon to defeat Mallus with their associate Damien Darhk, whose sole purpose was to save his daughter. Together with the enemy, they moved the possessed woman to a village in Zambesi and waited for the demon's release, equipped with totems. The plan, however, failed due to Darhk's release from Grodd, to whom the death totem showed another way to retrieve Nora. Nate successfully chased the meta-human with the help of the earth totem, discovering that old Jiwe remembers him. Despite the efforts of the heroes, Mallus freed himself mocking the ineptitude of the team.

   The legends, seeing no chance in the fight against the demon, decided to regroup on Waverider. They were helped by Rip Hunter who sacrificed himself to gain them some time. The heroes had to stop despairing and headed to Salvation in 1874, where, as Nate and Amai discovered, they intended to use the power of the wards to create something pure that would stand against Mallus. The first try did not turn out well, which ruined the team's morale. Their quarrel was interrupted by the arrival of Ava with reinforcements of Helen of Troy, Kuasa from the new timeline, and Jax in 2023, who were ready to help fight evil.

   After that, Amaya decided to go back to her time, to which Heywood had escorted her. The woman did not agree to erase her memory and said goodbye to her beloved with a kiss. After returning to the ship, he went with the rest of the team to Aruba in 2018, but their rest was quickly interrupted by Gary and Constantine.

   Fairy Godmother

Carrying Ray in his suit jacket, Nate approached his father and presented Ray, but nothing happened. Nate continuously raised Ray in the air, pleading him to turn back into a human. Eventually, when the Fairy Godmother was released by her host, her spell on Ray was reversed, causing him to spontaneously turn human in Nate's arms and forcing Nate to reveal his powers to Hank in order to keep his hold on Ray. However, this convinced Hank to give Ava the $4.2 billion she needed to work on the fugitives.

   Later, after making plans for another meal with Hank and describing his travels with the Legends, Nate celebrated his victory with Ava and told her that he was always happy to help. Ava replied that she could use his help in the Bureau and help him get some income in the process. When Nate hesitated, she left him alone to think about her job offer. After getting new clothes, Ray met up with Nate so that they could travel back home by

Nate announced that he would remain in the present temporarily to accept Ava's offer, work at the Time Bureau, and continue to reconnect with Hank, but he promised that they would "see him for the next one".

   On Thanksgiving, Nate and Ava planned to take the day off and attend the Heywoods' Thanksgiving dinner, as Nate could keep connecting with Hank and Ava didn't have a family to celebrate with. Nate arrived and introduced Ava to his
   mother

   Mona
   , whom he invited to eat with him. As Gary and Mona were preparing, a
   Baba Yaga
   , a
   Chupacabra
   , and a
   Kaupe
   that were being incapacitated by the Bureau woke up from their tranquilizers and escaped, wreaking havoc. Gary called Nate, who had Ava distract Hank while he went to help Gary and Mona. Nate quickly deduced that they were starving. Mona rattled off the foods that each creature liked before escaping to go find them. Meanwhile, Hank soon realized that something was wrong and forced Ava to portal him to the Bureau and find his son. Hank and Ava arrived just as Mona returned with the food, which the fugitives eagerly ate. Nate and Gary updated them on the situation and praised Mona, who was later hired as the Bureau's official creature handler.

   Hank complimented Mona and told Nate that they both had a similar eye for talent. Nate realized that his experience must have been how Hank felt when he left family gatherings, but Hank admitted that he partially did it to escape from the house. Nate playfully called him an "old so-and-so" as Ava joined them so that they could return to the Thanksgiving dinner. The three arrived just as dinner was ready, and Nate began to cut the turkey. However, Hank's phone rang, and Nate dismissed him so he could take the call. Hank went into a private room and told an unknown individual that the fugitives were controllable, and "Project Hades" was go.

   to see what the Legends did and prove that their efforts were worth the high deficit. Though Ray was very excited to see him and vice versa, Nate was surprised to find John Constantine living in his library, Gideon with a new look made by Zari, and "Amaya", who turned out to be Charlie and slapped him when he tried to embrace her. Ray and Sara filled Nate in on the situation but the three raced out after realizing they'd left Hank with John and Mick, leaving an annoyed Charlie alone. Nate, Sara, Hank, and Mick went to the Cafe du Dome to talk with some of the locals, including both Heywoods' idols, Ernest Hemingway (Hank) and Salvador Dalí (Nate). Nate and Mick approached Dali and listened to his story of the fugitive. Nate had Dali draw him a picture as Sara and Mick supervised Hank, who was busy hanging out with Hemingway.

   While questioning the locals, Nate ran into Charlie, who asked if he was lost. Nate snapped that he didn't need directions from her, but Charlie reminded him that regardless of what happened with Amaya, he shouldn't let it out on her. The two were approached by
   F. Scott
   and
   Zelda Fitzgerald
   , exciting Nate. Charlie told them that she and Nate were not a couple, but the Fitzgeralds insisted on taking them for drinks. Nate reluctantly let Charlie pull him after them. The four of them settled down in a restaurant and discussed the
   Minotaur
   . Charlie interrupted the Fitzgeralds with the fugitives' side of the story: the Minotaur had been rejected by his father, and he had chosen to stay in the maze in order to avoid the problems. Nate realized that Charlie's myth applied to him, abruptly leaving to find a way to stop the Minotaur peacefully. Just then, Sara and Mick returned with Hank, who had been injured by the Minotaur. Gideon sedated Hank, and Nate and Sara left to work on stopping the Minotaur. Nate eventually remembered the story of Daedalus's lute, which had been used in mythology to lull the Minotaur to sleep. Hank, who had been healed, complained at the plan and tried to get Sara to back him up, but Sara supported Nate, saying that his benevolent approach to the fugitives made him a Legend, no matter where he was. Nate, Hank and the Legends (save Zari and Charlie) headed back to Paris, where Nate brought and began to play a lute for the Minotaur. Unfortunately, he failed and was smacked across the room by the creature. However, Hank retrieved a guitar and began to sing a James Taylor song, and to everyone's surprise, Hank's music was enough to sedate the Minotaur, causing the latter to pass out on the spot.

   After everyone had switched to casual clothes, Hank told Nate and Sara that the mission was messy but fun, and he now understood the Legends' purpose. Nate opened a portal for his father to return to the Bureau headquarters, leaving him alone with Sara. Nate admitted that at this point, being a Legend felt like "the old days", and Sara joked that they of all people should know how confusing time is. Nate said that he loved the Legends, but he now belonged at the Bureau. Sara understood, telling him that she was proud of him and sending him off to do his "adult thing". The two were about to hug goodbye, but Sara suddenly asked if he was in a rush. They headed to the galley, where the Legends threw a pizza party that Nate had suggested earlier. Nate distributed beer while rattling off suggestions to make the

   trying to run from his problems at home, but being with them had shaped him into the man he needed to be and made him realize that he didn't have to run anymore. Nate then called for a toast, reminding the Legends that they never knew when their journey would end, so they should all "enjoy the ride while it lasts". He moved aside to speak to Charlie, telling her that because he had found his place with the Legends, he knew that she would too. The two new friends shared another toast as the

Nate approached Gary and scolded him for following such misogynistic dating advice. Gary asked Nate to help him ask Mona out, but Nate said that they weren't in high school. Realizing that "high school" was a trigger phrase for Gary, Nate changed his mind and reluctantly agreed to be Gary's "time bro wingman". He later approached Mona, who revealed that she had a crush on one of her coworkers. Mona was afraid that she would lose her job if he confessed her feelings, but Nate told her that he would personally ensure that Ava would not fire her for following her heart, adding, "Carpe datum!" Mona left to confess her feelings, exciting Gary. However, neither of the boys realized that Mona's actual crush was

Kilgore and other generals obtained an explosive ball to attack Cuba and threatened to kill Zari, so Nate, Kennedy, Bobbie and the other prosecutors played a game of football against them to get the ball, and they managed to triumph, but Cuba had sent a missile towards them. They were saved thanks to the missile being deactivated, and Nate along with Kennedy and the others celebrated the victory.

   His adoration of time travel is further shown when he looks with awe at Einstein's speech, commenting on how he can't believe the Legends, him included, had just changed history. However, it is seen that traveling to the future makes him uncomfortable as it's too uncertain and his historical knowledge is of little use. It also frustrates him when he encounters something that history has regarded as legend or fabrication but turns out to be true such as the legends of
   Camelot
   , though in that case it was partially a case of a
   time traveler
   changing history according to the legend retroactively.

   Throughout his life, Nate suffered from his hemophilia, spending half of his childhood in a hospital and never leaving home until he went off to college at the age of 16. Sheltered at home and unable to make his own decisions, Nate longed for a life as an adult, where he took the choice to go on an adventure as soon as one came up. Brave and dedicated, he refused to agree with Sara's suggestion to have him leave the

   in fear for his safety. Instead, Nate risked his life for the team and the Justice Society of America, ending up on the verge of death, but recovered after Ray injected him with a dose of
   Eobard Thawne's biomolecular enhancer
   that Ray's modified to drastically increase his strength, as well as grant him accelerated healing and enhanced durability.
  </p>
  <p key="84072334-b007-4e77-b2a3-3535ab86803e">
   After gaining powers due to the enhancer, Nate showed even more childlike excitement, testing out his strength against that of Ray's
   A.T.O.M. Exosuit
   rather recklessly, ending up with a damaged
   timeship
   and two time travelers freefalling through the Temporal Zone. Arriving to Medieval Japan, Nate immediately recognized the time period, claiming it to be awesome, before passing out. Despite being a historian and trying to make his story of a "gaijin merchant" to
   Masako Yamashiro
   seem believable, he ended up blundering when he referenced the
   <a href="United States (Earth-1).html" key="9d412912-edf1-4d8a-bd7f-2d50042318ee" title="United States (Earth-1)">

   </a>
   , before realizing those weren't supposed to exist yet. Nate also shown himself to be a fan of popular fiction, referencing the fictional "Master Yoda" when listening to Masako's advice, further confusing her. During his stay with the
   Yamashiro family
   , Nate showed both a flirtatious side in his interactions with Masako, and, once again, his altruism when trying to protect her and the village's freedom from the Shogun's Samurai. Despite his infatuation with Masako, Nate agreed with her pragmatic response regarding their possible relationship: as a time traveler, he could not stay with her. He also was willing to kill in battle, as he personally took the life of
   Tokugawa Iemitsu
   when he destroyed the
   A.T.O.M. Exosuit
   Tokugwa was wearing.

   Nate is courageous and willing to try new things for a good cause. When the Legends visited Liberty, Colorado in 1874, Nate stopped a train containing a large amount of dwarf star alloy that Quentin Turnbull was using to create his own country. Nate stood in front of the train and, using his steel powers, pushed against it until it came to a stop. This ultimately fixed the time aberration.

   After the Legends went their separate ways when Rip disbanded the team, he went off and worked with Team Flash in Central City, forming a bond with
   Wally West
   . The two shared similar backgrounds with formerly-absentee fathers, similar stories of accidental powers, and similar personalities when it came to being heroes, thus giving them much in common.

   Possibly because of his lack of paternal care growing up, Nate has shown to have somewhat parental instincts. When he and
   Zari
   recovered a
   dragon
   egg from the 1930s, Nate quickly began researching and applying the best ways to care for eggs and babies, even going so far as giving the dragon a name, playing classical music, installing a space-heated incubator, and carrying the egg on his chest when the incubator was powered off. Both Nate and Zari even hesitated to loosen up in their relationship until Nate realized that intimacy would generate extra body heat for the egg. They also made sure to secure the egg while the

   Nate is approachable and friendly, able to easily bond and make friends with all of his fellow Legends. He has grown especially close to Ray, forming a strong friendship to the point that Nate was even able to hold a naked Ray without being flustered
   and was the loved one that
   Neron
   chose to pursue while attempting to possess Ray.
   Sara has remarked on their bromance and "sibling rivalry",
   and they have exchanged hugs, high fives, chest bumps, cheek kisses, and even a forehead touch on one occasion.
   Nate was also the first person to whom Ray confessed his feelings for
   Nora Darhk
   , implying that they trust each other with their secrets
   Nate has shown to be protective of Ray to a degree; he did everything in his power to stop Ray from risking his life in Camelot and panicked when he thought he had failed.
   This protectiveness has been returned by Ray, who sat with Nate in the med bay after the latter's first injury in battle
   and showed extra concern whenever he heard Nate's urgent voice on comm
   or discovered that Nate had not been sleeping well.
   Their friendship has even saved Nate's life: when Nate's anger was about to drive him into becoming a vessel for Neron, Ray immediately went after Nate even as the latter punched him in the face, and Nate's guilt from hurting Ray was enough for him to regain control.
   Ray eventually gave Neron his body in exchange for Nate's life, inspiring Nate to rejoin the Legends in Ray's honor.
   Nate later died to return Ray's soul, and Ray, along with the rest of the Legends, channeled love into
   Tabitha
   's staff to bring him back.
   After being resurrected, Nate continued to support Ray and his relationship with Nora (despite his fear that it was rushed) and eventually had the honor of being Ray's best man at their wedding.
   Nate was the most impacted by Ray's departure from the Legends and misses him dearly.

     Tranquilizing drugs:
    </b>
    Tranquilizing drugs can temporarily disable Nate's ability to access his powers. This was first demonstrated when Nate, Amaya, and Mick traveled to 1951, to the first time the Dominators invaded Earth to try to find out why the aliens returned in 2016, and Smith's NSA agents knocked the trio out with tranquilizing darts. When he came to, Nate stated that whatever drug it was they'd been injected with was preventing him from accessing his powers.
    This was also shown when Nate was drugged and abducted from the streets of London in 1895 when attempting to draw out what he and his team, at the time, believed to be an anachronistic vampire. When Nate awoke sometime later and found himself strapped to a table in what appeared to be an operating room, he found that whatever he'd been "roofied with" was preventing him from using his powers, making it impossible for him to attempt to escape.
