    Barry Allen

   when he traveled back in time and saved his mother
   Nora Allen
   from Reverse Flash. The timeline was reset when Reverse-Flash ran back in time and killed Nora again, restoring everything pretty much to how it was before, albeit with some minor differences. However, after Barry Allen used a
   superseding form
   of speedster time travel to live in this timeline's version (Flashpoint) of 2016 for three months, he found the world much different to the timeline that existed before, with
   Cisco Ramon
   becoming the genius industrialist instead of
   Harrison Wells
   and
   Tess Morgan
   ,
   Wally West
   becoming The Flash instead of Barry, and
   The Rival
   becoming a new menace of
   Central City
   .

   As
   Jay Garrick
   later explained to Barry, speedsters are not gods and can never recreate a timeline to their liking; it would be akin to gluing together a broken cup; it remains visibly cracked and isn't back to exactly the way it used to be.

   The Flashpoint timeline was seen again when Cisco vibed it to figure out the name of the officer
   Clive Yorkin
   was planning to kill.

   , so distraught over all the tragedy that he had experienced, ran back in time to stop the
   Reverse-Flash
   from killing
   his mother
   . Barry arrived in the year 2000 shortly after his future self from 2024 took his younger self to safety, and once the coast was clear, Barry ran into the house and tackled the Reverse-Flash to the ground just before he could stab Nora, and beat him unconscious. He assured his petrified mother that she was safe and ran back to the present with the Reverse-Flash. He watched as the version of him from back in 2015 vanished in thin air as he altered time.

   Barry took Thawne and ran them to the 2016 version of the new timeline he created and placed him into a cage that dampened his speed. For the next three months, Barry lived in a life of pure bliss with both his parents alive and well, he still was a CSI for the
   CCPD
   and spent a lot of his spare time at
   CC Jitters
   waiting for the right time to ask
   Iris
   on a date. He noticed that there were a few differences around the CCPD such as there was a new captain and Joe West was an alcoholic, in danger of losing his job as a police officer. On the day he was finally going to make his move and ask Iris out, Barry heard on the news about a fight happening across town between
   The Flash
   and
   The Rival
   . Barry was happy that this new reality had its own Flash so he didn't have to be a vigilante speedster, but that changed when he realized that the alternate Flash was Iris' brother, Wally. He also saw that they didn't have the same resources and aid that he had trying to protect the city.
  </p>
  <p key="b8855cf0-1ead-423d-a708-e69a60dd6969">
   Following this, Barry revealed himself to the West siblings, explaining what the truth of what had happened though Wally and Iris were a little skeptical. He tried to go and receive the help of Cisco Ramon and Caitlin Snow but their lives were so much different than from his own timeline and neither seemed to want to fight crime like their previous selves did. Soon, Barry began to notice that his memories of his previous life were fading away and Thawne revealed that this world was starting to rewrite their old one and if he didn't let Thawne go and reset it soon, Flashpoint would be permanent when Barry's memory of being the Flash faded. Barry didn't want to lose his parents or his chance to be with Iris in this new world and refused. Barry decided to help Wally stop The Rival and teamed up against him. In the fight Barry managed to defeat the Rival with the aid of Joe but Wally became gravely injured, so much that his hyper healing didn't seem to be enough to help him. Barry realized that all of his friends were starting to pay the price for him to have happiness in this new world and knew he had to put things back to normal.

   He freed Thawne and told him that he needed to go back and kill his mother to put everything back. Barry, weakened by the loss of most of his memories, was taken by the Reverse Flash back to the year 2000 to when Barry had saved his mother. When they arrived, the versions of Thawne and Barry there vanished and Thawne preceded to kill his mother as before. Once they returned to the present, Thawne smiled at Barry and hinted that things may not be exactly as Barry had left them. When Barry reunited with Joe and Wally, he immediately noticed a number of massive changes.

In the case of the first assumption, some of these changes may have happened during that time frame regardless of Barry's alteration of the timeline; only the changes older than three months are known for sure to be a result of Barry's time traveling.)

    launch an invasion of Earth, as they were alerted to Barry's time traveling and seek to prevent Earth's meta-humans from doing further damage to the universe. (Mostly out of fear that some would be sadistic like Agent

    Because Barry removed
    Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash
    from his native time period in the act of saving his mother, Eobard was able to exist as a
    time remnant
    and as a result, avoid his erasure by
    Eddie Thawne
    in 2015. Eobard's paradoxical status caused him to be recklessly hunted by the
    Black Flash
    , a demented
    Speed Force
    enforcer, in order to remove him from the timeline.
    As a result, Eobard assembled the
    Legion of Doom
    and began a campaign to retrieve the
    Askaran Amulet
    and
    Spear of Destiny
    in order to rewrite reality and forcibly make himself a part of the timeline, during which he changed history several times, antagonizing the
    Legends
    . Despite his initial success and the creation of an
    alternate reality
    where he captured the Black Flash, the new reality was eventually reversed by the Legends and Eobard was subsequently erased from existence by the liberated Black Flash.

    The

    and the

    ' memories weren't affected by Flashpoint.

    Other Earths in the
    multiverse
    were not affected by Flashpoint, due to them each having their own timelines.
   </li>
   <li key="e9a69718-ff54-4f50-899a-fcbf81f2e5f9">
    As Joe mentions Barry just lost his father upon his arrival to the new timeline, this may be implying that his war with Zoom carried on for three more months, although this is unlikely as it would constitute a fairly major change to the timeline. Alternatively, Thawne dropped Barry off on the night right where he left off before he time traveled, but this is contradicted by later statements indicating that time has passed since Flashpoint began.
   </li>
   <li key="5f96081f-3117-49ff-ac84-25ea5e0eab48">
    It is unknown, how all the meta-humans in the Flashpoint timeline gained their powers. One could assume that since Barry took Eobard Thawne away, he was never able to kill and assume the identity of the original
    Harrison Wells
    . Thus, it is possible that Harrison Wells built the particle accelerator, and somehow it could have given the meta-humans their powers, but this is purely a conjecture, and it can't be confirmed, since the S.T.A.R. Labs had become Ramon Industries.
   </li>
   <li key="4198f73c-63c7-4eb0-b339-b6b4026b590f">
    While Flashpoint's world-affecting consequences to Earth-1 stay true to the comics, Flashpoint itself did not follow the comic arc, which had personal and global stakes, making it a do-or-die situation for Barry. This alternate timeline instead focused on Barry's personal stakes of forgetting his current life, and the world remained seemingly fine.
    <ul key="82ba2772-78ed-42a6-ab4c-992f5e3dae86">
     <li key="179565aa-baed-4503-8587-5869d0912e1d">
      Ironically, Thawne's
      Reverse-Flashpoint
      did a better job of adapting the Flashpoint arc. Not only did Barry lose many of his allies, he also had to risk destroying the world to reset the timeline and restore his own existence.
