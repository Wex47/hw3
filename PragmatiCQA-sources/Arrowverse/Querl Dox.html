   In the 21st century, Brainy and the Legion helped
   Supergirl
   to defeat
   Reign
   and the
   Worldkillers
   . After they were defeated, Brainy decided to stay in the past and join the

   . Subsequently, Brainy met the
   Naltorian
   Nia Nal
   during the attacks of the
   Children of Liberty
   and helped her to control her powers. Unfortunately, during a rescue mission with
   J'onn J'onzz
   and Nia, he is electrocuted by security guards, causing his mind to "reboot", making him cruel and emotionless, similarly to his evil ancestors. He later regained his emotions after seeing Nia in mortal danger. Later, Brainy declared himself to Nia and they started a relationship.

   and help Brainy to accept and turn off
   personality inhibitors
   . Eventually, the Brainys decided to leave the Earth and exist within the
   Big Brain
   , but before leaving,
   the female doppelgänger
   advised Brainy to ally with
   Lex Luthor
   and cut off all emotional attachment to defeat
   Leviathan
   . So, Brainy is forced to break up with Nia and acts cold and distant towards the Superfriends.
  </p>
  <p key="377742f3-89f5-4116-8bd4-795d20466c85">
   During this time, Brainy was in agony, not only from not having Nia in his life, but also from the fear of losing himself to the darkness within him. Brainy's efforts working with Lex proved to be successful, as they were able to stop Leviathan, although Brainy was forced to give up his lifeforce to do so. He later learnt that Lex had been manipulating him, planning to use the Gods against Supergirl. Brainy was saved by Nia and they, along with the team, defeated Lex Luthor, but first he sent Supergirl to the
   Phantom Zone
   , leaving they trying to find a way to bring her back.

   came along. Back on
   Earth
   , Nyxly and Lex teamed up to find the
   AllStone Totems

   Querl was born in the 31st century on the planet
   Colu
   into the so-called "Brainiac clan".
   He is implied to have had a strained relationship with
   his mother
   .
   A genius with a 12th-level intellect, the highest ever recorded on the planet, Querl was inspired by the superheroism of the 21st century and
   Supergirl
   's ideals, as well as the story and legend about her.
   At some point, during Querl's younger years, he visited a planet with his parents, leading to his
   mother
   bottling the planet for him to keep. However, his
   father
   found out and placed personality inhibitors on him in order to prevent Querl from becoming like her.

  <p key="921182b7-008d-4854-890d-dedd2eb7f470">

  <p key="8ed751ec-de84-474b-9a81-63be2a7fbb97">
   After a while, they decided to reveal the details, but still couldn't help. After this awkward conversation, Imra made the devastated Mon-El realize that you fight when there is something to fight for. These words motivated the hero, who immediately set off with Saturn Girl and Brainiac 5 to fight Reign. However, the opponent turned out to be much stronger for the three heroes, and when she was ready to kill the wounded Imra, Supergirl awoke from her coma and injected thee nemy with kryptonite serum, forcing her to flee. After that, the heroes returned to the headquarters of D.E.O., where scientists dressed their wounds.

   D.E.O. began to work and, wanting to learn more about Reign, they had to talk to
   Jindah Kol Rozz
   - a priestess who was a prisoner of
   Fort Rozz
   . Unfortunately for them, the
   Kryptonian
   prison was in the depths of space next to a celestial body that limited Kara's powers. Therefore, Imra decided to help the heroine and together with
   Livewire
   and
   Psi
   , using the
   legion's ship
   , reached the space prison. All the while Querl did his best to help the women's team from the
   D.E.O. base
   , but he was crowded with old technology and their unreliability, refusing the help of
   Winn Schott
   , whose tips ultimately proved to be extremely valuable. It was thanks to him that the team returned to

   When Kara and Mon-El discovered a group of birds that fell to the ground dead, they immediately examined them. It quickly turned out that the last worldkiler -
   Pestilence
   , which Imra wanted to get rid of with all her strength, could be behind it. Supergirl, however, wanted to reason with her opponent, trying not to make the mistakes she had made towards
   Julia Freeman
   . Soon after, Brainiac, along with Imra and Mon-El, began working on a cure to combat the effects of Pestilence, during which the couple quarreled over the lies about the purpose of their mission. When did D.E.O. linked the worldkiller identity to
   Grace Parker
   , they immediately took care of the woman. Before that, however, Imra got the location from Brianiac and also flew to the place where she saw that Kara might be right. Despite her efforts, Pestilence with
   Purity
   's help managed to escape, but the entire attack managed to get the alien's DNA, which allowed for the development of a vaccine. The heroes returned to the headquarters of D.E.O., where they dressed their wounds and regrouped, administering medicine to the wounded. The conversation was interrupted by the attack of two worldkillers on the underground under
   L-Corp
   , where the team moved immediately. There, it turned out that under the hood Reign was
   Samantha Arias
   , a friend of
   Lena Luthor
   , who had been studying her for a long time. The worldkillers, however, managed to escape, being even more powerful than alone.
  </p>
  <p key="835c13c7-7670-4aed-a3eb-d716cc4ded0c">
   The heroes took Lena to D.E.O.'s headquarters, where they interrogated her, finding out that the woman had been trying to save Sam Arias from Reign for several weeks. Soon after, it was revealed that the united worldkillers were bringing an apocalypse on Earth, starting with a solar eclipse, during which Supergirl lost consciousness for a while. When she awoke, she revealed that she was in a
   dark valley
   and saw Sam. Luthor immediately confirmed that this is some kind of alternate world that Arias exists in when Reign takes control. Therefore, the heroine came up with a plan to get there and help her friend. Thanks to the Legion's ship and the help of Imra, Mon-El and Querl, assumptions became possible, and the heroine's actions led to receiving a signal from Sam in the middle of the desert. Supergirl was awakened and immediately after that the hero found the
   Fortress of Sanctuary
   , where a fight with worldkilers took place. As a result, Purity and Pestilence died, but their power was absorbed by Reign, who escaped before the heroes could do anything.

   The legion began preparing to return to the future by saying goodbye to friends. Querl said goodbye personally to Winn, whom he befriended. He handed him sand from the future in which he had planted the bedbugs. With their help, shortly after leaving Earth, he learned that Reign had tripled her strength. Thus, he calculated the probability that Supergirl and the team had to defeat the enemy. This made Mon-El more and more contemplating returning. It was then that Imra allowed him to leave the ship to help his friends. She believed that if he did his job and stayed there, it would also be his destiny. Despite everything, she believed internally in the return of the man.

   Later, Querl, along with Imra, returned to Earth just in time to help the heroes fight the decaying Earth, caused by the witches of Krypton. They stopped a giant wave heading towards National City, after which everyone celebrated the victory at the D.E.O. Taking advantage of the moment, the alien decided to talk to Mon-El and Winn, introducing them to the situation that is taking place in the future. The main point was that Agent Schott would have to replace him on his time. The man, after much reflection and talking to his friend, agreed, and the agency said goodbye to the agent. Querl soon found an envelope on his desk with a diagram of the device that made Winn shine in the future.

In his newly revealed true form, his two
    remaining

    Winn Schott
    who reunited with his friends. Alex tasked Querl with uncovering who Toyman's ally was, not knowing that in reality it was Querl. At the D.E.O, Querl told Lex to call Toyman off so that he didn't hurt anyone. However, Lex refused and Querl stared to begin to doubt Lex. The team meets again at J'onn J'ozz's new headquarters, The Tower, where Querl saw Nia Nal. When Nia Nal, didn't tell anyone what she saw in her dream, Querl started questioning her, which lead to her pushing him and using his old nickname. The team found out where Toyman was going to attack and stopped the assassination of Andrea Rojas. During the battle, Querl paused, worried for Nia Nal. Winn noticed this. Afterwards, Winn confronted Brainy about his behavior, and Querl told him the truth, visibly nervous that he was doing the wrong thing and saying that he was afraid he was becoming the bad guy. Winn reassured him that he still considered Querl, an old friend and that he would keep his secret.

   When Kara, Alex, J'onn, and Winn were at the dive bar, Brainy was on a call to Lex, who told him that he should keep Alex "under control" as she had planted spyware on her tablet. He was later attacked by a drone controlled by Toyman who had uploaded his conscious to the D.E.O servers. Kara, Alex, and Winn stopped the drone, and Winn recognized the music the drone was broadcasting. At the D.E.O, they figured out that Toyman was attempting to get out into the internet. After, a brief skirmish, they got a call from Lex, stating that Supergirl couldn't use her power as they had kryptonite safeguards and no anti-kryptonite protectors. After, everyone left, Querl called Lex back. Lex told him to get Toyman's immorality code. Winn briefly confronted Querl on whether or not this was one of Lex's plans, where Querl said it was. While Alex was trying to delink D.E.O equipment, she found out that Querl has deleted her Spyware. Alex confronted Querl, who confessed to deleting the spyware but said it was to keep her safe.  After, Toyman was defeated and Winn went back to the future, Alex told everyone she was quitting the D.E.O. Querl went to tell Lex this and give him the code which he gathered during the commotion.

   Lex came to visit Querl while he was working on a mortality code in order to kill Leviathan. He informed Lex that they would need something to weaken first. Lex quickly shot the idea down so Querl added there was another option but that they needed access to Leviathan’s base. At the same time, an agent informed him that there was an attack on Andrea Rojas. Lex decided to use this as an opportunity to gain Leviathan by using supergirl to defend Andrea. Later, Alex calls him asking for info about a suspect. Querl lies to her, in order to prevent her from looking into it. Querl then, bring up a hologram of his doppelgänger and talks to him about how his worries of betraying his friends. His doppelgänger tells him that he has to work with Lex to save the future. When Supergirl bring Andrea to the D.E.O, Querl puts her in a cell so that she is safe while he goes to stop the launch of Obsidian Platinum.

   When Querl is unable to stop the Launch, he calls Lex for him but he doesn’t respond. Supergirl eventually stops it and Querl confronts Lex. Lex tells him that Supergirl will always save the day and Querl starts doubting Lex even more. When the D.E.O arrives to a crime scene where Nia had just taken down a dominator, Querl thanked her and was about to say something but instead just thanked her again. Nia also was going to say something but then stopped. Later, Kara called him to ask him for help locating a homophobic attacker. Querl said that it was terrible, then rephrased his statement so that he could keep up his charade. After he helped Nia, and she had taken down the attacker, Querl went to the police and gave them files on a transphobic group that the attacker belonged to.

   When Querl asked Lex to help him locate the people kidnapped by Leviathan, Lex said that he couldn't, as it would put him and Lena in danger but encouraged him to help by using
    Myriad

   Sun-Eater
   (confined at the Fortress) as a distraction. Querl helped stop the Sun-Eater by suggesting that Kara should wear a Lexosuit to enable her pursue the creature into space.

   Querl confronted Lex about releasing the sun-eater and helping Leviathan destroy the world. He stated that his friends could have died and that he wasn't going to stand back while Leviathan tried to kill his friends. Lex ordered to not intervene. Querl disobeyed Lex's orders and went to help the super friends fight Rama Khan. Kara tried to convince him not to take Rama Khan to the D.E.O but he did. Querl tried to strike a deal with Rama Khan to take him to
    their ship
    . However, it was a trap, and Rama Khan completely destroyed the D.E.O. Querl looked sadly at the destruction of the D.E.O. He then attempted to talk to Kara and Nia but they shut him out. After Kara left, Nia got angry at Brainy as she thought that this Brainy was different than her Brainy and she couldn't trust him. She asked him to tell her the truth but he didn't after which Nia told him that if Querl couldn't choose a side then she would do it for him. Querl then met with Lex where he told him that the D.E.O's destruction was all his fault. Lex started laughing at that and Querl figured out that Lex wanted Rama Khan to go to the D.E.O to get kryptonite. Lex told him that he gave Leviathan a tool that could hurt Supergirl but it needed kryptonite. He added that Leviathan was pleased with it and gave him an invite to their ship.

   When Lex returned, he yelled at the Brainy asking him why he didn't wait for Supergirl to die; the latter replied that he underestimated him as he would never let his friends die, to which Lex laughed saying he didn't underestimate anything since he knew since the beginning he would have chosen to shrink the Gods in a bottle instead of kill them but he didn't expect for him to choose suicide in order to do it. Taking away the bottle in which Brainiac 5 sealed Leviathan, Lex informed him that he succeeded in preventing Leviathan from killing Supergirl, thus; forcing him to do it himself. Continuing, he said it would be fun right before mockingly saluting him and exiting the room.

    to confront Lex personally, Brainy apologized for his months of distance and asked if they could rebuild their relationship. When Dreamer agreed, Brainy gave her a flight ring to help her in battle.

   Brainy saw the news report that Lex was acquitted from his crimes against humanity and began talking to the screen expressing how angry he was and how Lex deserved punishment. When the Martians entered with Silas who had been infected by
    Prime Phantom
    , Brainy researched the origins of phantoms and related to Alex that, in the future, the soul was discovered to be a true object. When Silas lost his soul, turned into a phantom, and attacked, Brainy and J'onn  fought and captured him.

   Later, as Lena rhetorically suggested death for Lex, Brainy took the suggestion seriously and began plotting how to dispose of his body; Brainy was dissuaded from the plot by Lena, causing him to have an emotional breakdown where he admired his rage and that he missed Kara. Prime Phantom led an attack on the Tower but it was repelled by Lena, Alex, and Brainy.

Brainy found out that Nia was responsible for freeing Nyxly from the dream realm, but he didn't bother and asked her to tell Kara the truth. Brainy and the team began to build an anti magic amulet to take away Nyxly's magical powers. While working on the amulet, he and Nia were interrupted by Mxy, who wanted to help, but Brainy refused his help.

Shortly after, Brainy spoke with the Brainy of Earth-TUD15, who told him that he should go back to the 31st century, but Brainy refused to go because he did not want to know more about the future, and he loved being in 2021. At the end of the call, Brainy told the Superfriends everything about the future. Brainy argued with Nia about going back to the 31st century, but she couldn't come with him.

     Querl is an extremely intelligent, logical, but compassionate individual. In the beginning, Querl's compassionate nature was shown in his efforts to help Kara awaken from her coma. Mostly likely due to being a synthetic being, Brainy sometimes comes off as socially awkward and slow to pick up on people's feelings.
    </p>
    <p key="fa385642-3177-43c0-b451-d123141d7827">
     However, Querl's massive intellect boasts an equally massive ego, calling himself a "12th Level Intellect", coming up with impossible solutions with technology that doesn't exist yet or dismisses other people's ideas in favor of his own, sometimes even to the point of vocally demeaning other intellects; in addition, he makes his decisions based on logic and calculations which occasionally compromises his morals, which is why he sided with Imra - behind Mon-El, Supergirl and the D.E.O.'s back - in her quest to rid themselves on Pestilence in order to save the millions of lives in the future, including Imra's own sister, Preya. He is also shown to overestimate his capabilities, especially back in the 21st century where the technology is far more limited than to what he is used to.

    <p key="572bb19c-e670-43f0-9c6e-b51aab56d59b">
     Even after spending months in the 21st century, Querl has some trouble understanding some things; he doesn't understand needing to keep quiet about carrying on off-the-books research while tending to not understand the purpose of tasks asked of him until explained in greater detail. However, he does have an appreciation for classic movies that both Mon-El and Kara told him about.

     Querl seems to have an infatuation with
      Nia Nal
      , trying to act cool or becoming clumsy in her presence, she seems to return the attraction, flirting with him several times, furthermore, after Querl lost his emotions, once he saw Nia in a mortal danger his original personality was restored, indicating he deeply cares about her, Querl later admits Nia is the first person he has truly loved in his life, due to this fact, he tends to make some (hilarious) blunders in trying to be romantic, after Nia expressed gratitude for breakfast in bed, Querl attempted to make her happy by sending her lunch, in unfortunately large amounts, although Nia once makes it clear that he was trying too hard to be romantic, Querl backs off and starts trying simpler methods. Querl tends to ask Alex and Kara for dating advice.

    Since Querl removed his inhibitors, he has lost the wall holding back his caring and vulnerable side; he also fears the darkness of his ancestral memory, worrying that surpressing his kind side will change him for the worse, noticibly, he is pained to force himself to be apart from Nia, to protect her and their friends while he works against Lex in secret. Though he does subtly show his affection for her, by helping out her community; he assisted the NCPD by giving them better-researched information on their cold cases in trans murders. Querl often seeks advice from the Brainiac 5s that gave him their projectors, as he is not used to operating with raw emotion like they had.

     After being tortured by the

      , Querl's mind rebooted and made it line up to his more emotionless ancestors, the loss of emotions made him quite ruthless, leading him to leave both
      Nia Nal
      and
      J'onn J'onzz
      behind to be taken to an unknown location, disregarding their safety. He didn't mind if something bad happened to them and he acted carefree at this idea.

    As a Legionnaire, Querl is highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist.

In fact, thus far; there are but a handful of occasions where Querl got aggressive such as a case somewhat when he kicked down
     Pamela Ferrer
     to incapacitate her and when he and Sentinel/Alex had to defend the tower and prevent J’onn and M’gann from being interrupted when J’onn was trying to give M’gann his fragment of her soul, her life force using the ura’er’un in order to save her or when he fought hat and was able to determine where he would reappear using differential calculus.
