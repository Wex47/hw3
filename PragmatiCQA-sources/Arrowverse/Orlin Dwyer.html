   Orlin Dwyer grew up in the Midwest. He was a delinquent youth, having been in and out of juvie.
   Orlin had
   a sister
   , though their relationship was implied to have become distant in adulthood (Orlin was clearly unaware of the fact that his sister had gotten married and started a family, implying they no longer kept in touch).

  <p key="e087e9ed-7023-49c9-9596-cdcd1e17ddd8">

   On the night of May 4, 2017,
   CCPD
   Officer
   Jones
   arrived at Orlin's door to reveal that his sister and
   her husband
   had been killed in a
   meta-human
   attack, much to his shock. As a result, their daughter and Orlin's niece,
   Grace Gibbons
   , was sent to live with him, as he was her next of kin. However, Orlin was initially unprepared and unwilling to care for a child, and thus had a strained relationship with Grace.
  </p>
  <p key="547329fb-66b7-4163-bb1f-6f8e336c663e">
   Several weeks later, Grace began getting into trouble at school for lashing out at her classmates, so Orlin was called in to the principal's office to discuss the matter. He scolded his niece for her behavior but Grace angrily yelled that Orlin wasn't her parent since he made her life worse and she hated her uncle, just like he hated himself. Shocked at her outburst, Orlin was forced to realize he needed to change his ways.
  </p>
  <p key="f9111114-c665-4687-acf0-d7d7bd30c5e5">
   Shortly afterwards on May 22, Orlin arranged for him and Grace to move into his cousin
   Robbie Byrne
   's old
   house
   . There, Orlin apologized to Grace for failing her and admitted she was right in that he hated himself. He asked for a second chance to be a real caretaker, which she agreed to. Over time, Orlin and Grace began to bond through fixing up the house and decorating a dollhouse, and Orlin soon came to love Grace as his own daughter.

   A year later on May 22, 2018, Orlin took Grace to the Central City Carnival to celebrate the anniversary of the day he made a promise to change for her. Suddenly, the
   Enlightenment
   began, which rendered Orlin, Grace, and nearly everyone else in the city unconscious as the
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   satellite worked to reset the populace's brains. When

   destroyed the
   dark matter
   -loaded satellite, the resulting force of the double speedster punch caused the device to shatter into multiple pieces. Orlin and Grace attempted to flee as the debris rained down on Central City, but the satellite's core exploded near them. A piece of the core shaped like a
   dagger
   , which was infused with large amounts of dark matter, impaled Orlin in his chest, causing a permanent injury in his lung. Another piece of shrapnel hit Grace in her head.

   Orlin brought Grace to
   Central City Hospital
   , pleading for someone to help her. Dr.
   Vanessa Ambres
   had Orlin wheeled into the emergency room as she looked over Grace. Later after Orlin was discharged, he went to a comatose Grace's hospital room, where Ambres sadly warned him that she may not ever wake up due to the injuries she sustained from the satellite shrapnel. A heartbroken Orlin blamed himself for not protecting Grace but Ambres assured him it wasn't his fault, claiming the meta-humans in the city were to blame due to running around unchecked. After Ambres left, Orlin saw the news heralding The Flash and his allies as heroes for saving the city, as well as a report of
   another meta-human
   escaping the police after a robbery. Orlin was filled with rage, causing the dark-matter infused lightning dagger to fly to his hand. As the dagger glowed, Orlin vowed to Grace that he would make things right and decided to use his abilities to kill every meta-human in existence to avenge his family's suffering.

   , Cicada ambushed the convoy. Throwing his dagger into the path of the truck, a burst of electric energy radiated from the blade, bringing the truck to a halt. After a brief altercation with the
   police
   , in which a few suffered severe injuries, Cicada went to the back of the transport vehicle to gain access to Lang. When questioned by Lang about who he was, or what he wanted, Cicada simply replied, "For all of
   you
   to die". He then approached Lang with the same lightning bolt-shaped dagger, flowing with the same unknown electrical energy.

   Upon attempting to kill him, Lang freed himself and fought back. Although the fight looked to be in Gridlock's favor, Cicada's discarded dagger seemingly absorbed his powers, leaving him defenseless. Cicada easily overpowered the now-powerless Gridlock, beating him to the ground before fatally stabbing him in the chest, absorbing whatever energy he had left. Afterward, Cicada retreated to an unknown factory, still reeling from his injuries as he reflected on the fight. A coworker sees Cicada and inquires on whether he's been in "another fight", to which he confirms. As the co-worker leaves, Cicada gets up to place both his dagger and mask in his work locker, seemingly hiding in plain sight.

   When The Flash and XS defeated
   Vanessa Jansen
   , Cicada revealed himself to the group after throwing a dagger through Jansen's chest. He then confronted the two speedsters,
   Vibe
   , and

    Elongated Man

   . As XS transported Jansen to a hospital, Cicada threw his dagger into the ground, negating the remaining trio's powers, as he had done to Gridlock. Although the group attempted to subdue Cicada with hand-to-hand combat alone, he proved to be the superior fighter, defeating all three. After incapacitating the Flash, Cicada was about to inflict the killing strike with his dagger when XS returned, shouting "Dad!". Seemingly affected by the parent-child bond shown between the two, Cicada paused for a moment before calmly getting up and walking away as the police arrived.

   While most of the members of
   Team Flash
   were investigating about Cicada, the latter held
   Joe West
   captive in Joe's own home in order to get Vibe and kill him. With her telepathic powers,
   Cecile Horton
   discovered that Joe was in trouble. Joe told Cecile via his thoughts that she shouldn't use his panic button to call for help. When
   Joe and Cecile's baby
   cried, Cecile ended up using the distress call. Vibe came, Cicada tackled him, forcing him through the breach Cisco created to arrive on the scene, bringing both of them to a forest. Cicada hurt Vibe on his right shoulder with his dagger and brought him. When Vibe's teammates discovered what forest he was in and arrived on the scene, he nullified Flash's speed, but XS could throw him off for a while. Vibe threw a reactor on Cicada, but it was reflected back to Vibe, and the big explosion made Cicada think Vibe died, which seemed corroborated by a news article published a short time later. He doesn't know that Cisco faked his death. He then later went to a hospital to see
   Grace
   while also showing a doctor his shrapnel wound, telling him to stop. He ignores the doctor and then kisses his niece goodbye.

   A week later, Cicada returns to his home in incredible amounts of pain, because of his shrapnel wound. He then grabbed onto a metal pipe for support and then, much to his surprise, starts crushing it. Realizing he has super strength, while still in agony.

   Orlin then goes to

   young meta

   Days later Orlin was in Grace's room but almost got caught by Barry Allen that was investigating her father but Dr. Ambres tells him that he is dead and that the hospital is the only family that the girl has before Barry left. Later that day he comes to the hospital but Doctor Ambres warns him that it's too risky to come here but Orlin comes anyway saying that it's Thanksgiving and that he must be with his family.

  <p key="8b309ddd-e224-461a-bb18-178b70ac0ef0">
   Days later he was spied on by Team Flash when he was on his way to the hospital. The group had devised a plan to travel back in time to construct a device to negate his dagger's powers using items they'd previously come across and had planted it at the hospital the night of the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator explosion to use against him when they returned to the present. At night, he detected the Flash and his allies' presence and fought them, he also finds out that Vibe didn't die and Vibe breached his dagger into outer-space and got punched multiple times by the Flash. He managed to summon his dagger back from space and almost killed the Flash, but Killer Frost (being immune to the dagger's power-dampening effects) surfaced and blasted him. Realizing he couldn't win, he then flew away.

  <p key="415eb624-7d1a-4efc-a0ca-0c8606337d41">
   After a while, Cicada returned, and went on a killing spree, targeting meta-humans with criminal pasts (though these individuals had already served time for their crimes, and been released from prison) using a list of known meta-human former criminals leaked to him by
   an officer from the CCPD
   who'd also grown to secretly despise them. When Team Flash confronted Cicada, he ended up critically injuring Nora, leaving Barry ready to kill him, claiming it was the only way to stop Cicada from killing anyone else. During a battle with the killer, Barry (able to access his powers thanks to Killer Frost keeping Cicada's dagger away) brutally beat Cicada with a vengeance, angrily saying that he'd never hurt his (Barry's) daughter again. However, before Barry could deliver the final blow, the now fully-healed Nora showed up, asking Barry not to kill Cicada, snapping Barry out of his fit of rage. Cicada then took this opportunity to flee.

  <p key="05dffe93-7ae2-47c7-82ce-872c434bff82">
   Later, when Barry Allen took the meta-human cure Team Flash had been working on (which Barry had suggested they use on Cicada in order to stop him
   ) into the Speed Force to get it ready faster (Cisco had stated that they'd have to let it cook for twenty-seven days, but they decided they couldn't wait that long, as there was no telling how many innocent meta-humans could murder in that time. If Barry took it into the Speed Force, thereby exposing it to tachyons, the cure would be ready in one hour. While Barry was gone, Iris went into her office to finish an article she was getting ready to publish. While she was there, Cicada showed up and kidnapped her, but not before she was able to send out a distress call to the rest of the team. Nora raced to save her but ended up having to reverse time a total of 53 times to prevent anyone on Team Flash from getting killed by Cicada. After each time reversal, Nora took notes in her journal, so that she knew what to do differently the next time. With help from the team, she was able to reverse time in such a way that none of Team Flash was killed, and Orlin ended up getting stabbed in the chest with his own dagger, forcing him to retreat.

   One night Orlin chase a meta named

The Flash than appears and give him the choice to use a cure to take away his power but he refuses because he doesn't care about his legacy and attacked him. When he was about to kill him, he runs away after spotting Killer Frost. Later he meets again with the Flash and he discovers that grace is also a Meta making him remorseful and come to an agreement where he will take the cure only if Grace takes it also.

   S.T.A.R. Labs
   to cure him. He didn't have a good impression since he wanted to go to the hospital and ask that Dr. Vanessa Ambres has to come if they want him to take the cure. After Ambres arrived at S.T.A.R. Labs, she, Caitlin and Cisco started to inject the cure and stabilize his vitals. However, when they were about to stitch up his wound, the lights went out and another Cicada broke into the room. Caitlin told Dr. Ambres to take Orlin out while they fought the other Cicada. At the elevator, however, Ambres and Orlin were stopped by the other Cicada, who killed Ambres, took the unconscious Orlin and escaped. Later, Orlin was seen still unconscious while the other Cicada who watched him took off the mask revealing that it was a future version of Grace.

However she killed him when he told her that the reason he took the cure was because it was the first step to not misuse his own powers to kill anymore metas. So after killing him Grace's mind coped with his death by envisioning a still vengeful Orlin who encouraged her to keep their mission alive. In Grace's mindscape, there was still a good Uncle Orlin who helped Grace erased her evil future self out of existence.

    Orlin Dwyer was originally very selfish and lazy person; he didn't want to have to take care of anyone and he hated having to go to work. Orlin was a very troubled and isolated individual from his youth, which strained his personal relationships. However, after taking in his orphaned niece,

        Despite no prior training or experience, Orlin proved to be a quick study with his lightning dagger and showcased incredible knife-wielding abilities, as seen during his fight against the Flash, Vibe, and Elongated Man.
        Orlin fought on par with Raelene while she wielded metal blades projecting from her arms using his dagger for a time, though she managed to wound him.
        Orlin also battled evenly with

        in a knife fight, though she eventually cut his arm, forcing him to fall back on his force-field power.
        Orlin is a highly capable knife thrower, as seen when he threw his dagger in front of a moving convoy truck when attacking Gridlock.
        Orlin also hurled his dagger into Block's chest with great accuracy from a fair distance.

    In the comics,
    David Hersch/Cicada
    was an enemy of
    Wally West
    who also killed people and drained their energy with a lightning-shaped dagger, but his goal was to collect the energy to resurrect his wife. Hersch had been struck by lightning and given immortality. His name came from the cicada insect, which is traditionally associated with immortality, which he also left behind after murders and instead of a mask, he had a distinctive silver beard, which, along with his baldness, gave him a resemblance to real-life serial killer
    Charles Manson
    .

      In the comics, Cicada led a cult. While this never appeared on the show (likely to avoid displaying too many similarities between him and Alchemy), it is referenced by Orlin having other humans, such as Officer
      Jones
      and Dr.
      Vanessa Ambres
      , supporting his cause.

        The Cicada comic book featured in the
        Flash Museum
        is a real-life comic book, with the cover featuring Cicada, The Flash (Wally West), and prominent cultist
        Frankie Kane/Magenta
        in displayed in front of the rest of the cult.

      Cicada's comic book identity is referenced in the show, with
      Sherloque Wells
      assuming he was
      David Hersch
      , as he was Cicada in all other universes. Additionally, a
      CCU
      faculty member known only as
      Hersch
      was referenced back in
      Season 3

    Cicada was originally supposed to appear as the second cliffhanger scene of the
    Season 4
    finale, but he was cut due to time constraints and the scene was used in the trailer for
    Season 5
