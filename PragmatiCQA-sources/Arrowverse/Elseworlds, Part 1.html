   In Central City, Oliver Queen awakens and is confounded to wind up in Barry's bed. He strolls through the condo and Iris kisses him and serves him breakfast. He understands that Iris accepts he is Barry. Ollie cooperates, obviously befuddled. They're cautioned at a burglary and when Iris leaves, Ollie understands that he is a speedster. Iris brings his ring and Ollie makes sense of how to get ready.

   As yet getting the hang of his speed as The Flash, he speeds past the burglary and needs to turn around. Inside, precious stones are being taken and the looters have a prisoner. At first, Oliver has difficulty handling the situation, until Cisco tells him to hit them with lightning blast. He enters Flashtime, and speeds around in order to do the strike. The strike causes the bandits to flee, and the lightning bolt starts bouncing around, and Oliver flees too, not noticing that the lightning bolt awakened a large robot.

   Barry gets ready as The Green Arrow and enters the conflict in the wake of shooting an inappropriate bolt.

   At the point when they see Iris without anyone else, Barry advises Oliver to converse with her. He proposes calling Iris his "lightning rod" which Ollie disregards. Iris enlightens Oliver, that she talked with Felicity after Oliver was imprisoned and how that can't be her person. Oliver requests that Iris acknowledge his story, yet before long is rendered oblivious as Iris spiked the wine she gave him with nanites. Barry sees Oliver on the ground, yet before he can help him he is taken out by Ralph.

   Barry awakens to see that he and Oliver have been bound and secured in the pipeline.

They figure out how to get away from the pipeline and go to take and extrapolator and penetrate to Kara.

   On Earth-38, Kara is visiting Clark and Lois on the Kent farm in Smallville. Lois wants to write an article about Argo City, as she is literally the first human to walk in the remains of Krypton. Clark is a little reserved about it, but doesn't object. Kara then comes as Lois heads to in to the barn, while Kara and Clark take a break with beers. They talk privately about Clark's time in Argo City, and Kara's recent discharge from the D.E.O., after she refused to reveal her identity to President Baker. She wonders if she did the right thing, and Clark claims she did in order to protect her loved ones.

   Suddenly, they hear noise from the horse ranch, and it's Oliver and Barry who ran straight to Lois. She is about to strike with a hammer, but Kara speeds there, and breaks the situation, and introduces Oliver ad Barry to Clark and Lois, and vice versa.

   At S.T.A.R. Labs, Cisco lerans the robot's name is
   A.M.A.Z.O.
   . They discover that it is utilizing mirakuru to duplicate superpowers. Sherloque has made sense of that Iris helped Barry and Oliver getaway and advises her to admit. She says that she trusts them about their characters and Cisco also comes to believe it. Suddenly, A.M.A.Z.O. returns to wreak havoc in Central City.

   Back on the Kent Farm, Oliver goes to Barry. He concedes the amount he detests seeing Barry be so carefree with his abilities, so as to be The Green Arrow Oliver utilizes the entirety of his history of torment. Barry says that being The Flash for him is the inverse. Relinquishing his torment encourages him. They understand that Oliver is a superior speedster when he is upbeat and Barry is an increasingly gifted warrior when he's distraught, so with Kara's consolation they choose to be progressively similar to one another.

   Cisco arrives to the farm to be greeted by Oliver, Barry and Kara. He tells them they believe their characters have been switched, and requests their help in defeating A.M.A.Z.O. Clark also joins and reveals himself as Superman to Cisco.

   By the time the heroes arrive at Earth-1 Central City, A.M.A.Z.O. is already on a rampage. Oliver, Barry and Kara strike at it hard and fast, and eventually Clark swoops down from the sky and strikes the robot to the ground. However, it gets back up and copies all of their powers, and the heroes can't harm it, as it can now phase like the Flash can. Iris asks if Cisco can do anything to stop it, while Cisco denies it, and Sherloque tells them "It's a computer right? So- Just turn it off."
  </p>
  <p key="cac9e486-7546-4237-a47b-2c5296b6a286">
   Once the countermeasure is ready, Barry then tells Oliver to lure A.M.A.Z.O., as it can't run and phase at the same time. He tells Kara and Clark that they must hold the robot still and Barry will then shoot it with the countermeasure. Cisco arrives with it, and Oliver brings the robot. Kara and Clark grab hold of it, and Oliver grabs on it too to neutralize it's phasing ability. Barry aims at A.M.A.Z.O. and says Oliver's catchphrase, "You have failed this city!", and shoots. it's a direct hit, and A.M.A.Z.O. shuts down.

   Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry talks with Iris and she reveals she let him and Oliver go, because she felt something when Barry told her the truth. But she wants him to promise that he will come back as himself and not as Oliver. Barry promises. Cisco then reveal to Oliver, Barry and Kara about the vibe he had about the Monitor. Oliver wants to see it, and Cisco vibes with him and Barry. It is seen that the Monitor gave a book to John Deegan, and he could sense Cisco's presence and is amazed that there is someone with Cisco's powers on Earth-1. He claims that the events are already in motion, and that they can't stop what comes and it's better to run. The vibe ends and Cisco bleeds afterwards. Monitor's words didn't make sense, but Oliver quickly draws a picture about the place they were on, and while they don't recognize the men, Oliver recognizes the name of the tower in it: Wayne Tower. This means that they are in Gotham City, and that's where they will be going.

      Given that the last remaining sample of the drug was given to
      S.T.A.R. Labs
      to synthesize for a cure
      , obtaining it from there would have been the only possible means for Ivo Labs to get a hold of it.

    According to Barry, A.M.A.Z.O. can't run and phase at the same time, although there were countless instances shown where speedsters phased through walls while running; including Barry when he first learned to phase.

    As seen when John Deegan later rewrote Earth-1's reality with the Book of Destiny a second time, thereby turning himself into Superman and leaving Kara locked up in the S.T.A.R. Labs' pipeline,
    even if someone who's not native to an Earth altered by the Book of Destiny is on the affected Earth when reality is altered, they'll retain their memories of reality as it had previously been. But, when Barry and Oliver swapped lives as a result of Deegan's first Elseworld,
    Sherloque
    , who isn't from Earth-1, still perceived Barry as Oliver, and Oliver as Barry.

    To convince Iris about the truth of their situation, Barry suggests that Oliver talk to her and call her his lightning rod. Since Iris already believes that Oliver is Barry, this would only serve to reinforce that notion; she would more likely be convinced hearing it from "Oliver".

    Team Flash considered the possibility that "Barry" and "Oliver" are telling the truth about their lives beings swapped. Even Sherloque agreed that the idea is feasible. Iris adds that "Barry" has been treating her like he doesn't even know her. However, they all agreed to detain the two, fearing they will go bonkers if left alone.

    Clark and Oliver (as the Flash) raced with Oliver not being able to control his speed, and questioned Clark's methods. Clark then taught Oliver on how he learned to control his own speed with the help of his

    parents
