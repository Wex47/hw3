   Jada Jet
   and a late
   unnamed man

   Marquis Jet
   , and the adoptive daughter of the late
   Cora Lewis
   . In an
   alternate timeline
   created by Eobard Thawne, by 2031, she had married

   Alice

   Ryan has since received

   After Kate was found and had her memories returned, she passed the mantle of Batwoman to Ryan and named her the new acting CEO of

  </h3>
  <p key="592b1882-60f3-41d1-91db-700650bba8f5">
   Ryan Wilder was born on May 30, 1995 in
   Gotham City
   to
   Jada Jet
   and an
   unnamed man
   with whom she had an affair.
   Jada paid the attending doctor,
   Anthony Quadracci
   , to make it seem like she died right after giving birth to Ryan under the alias "Nia A. Wilder" before abandoning her daughter.
   With Ryan's father having died sometime prior, she was sent into foster care and bounced around multiple homes growing up, unaware of her true parentage.
  </p>
  <p key="032c24cc-ce80-42c5-980e-0d7316c0c4e0">
   When she was eight years old, Ryan was transferred into a group home for girls. She attempted to make friends with the other residents, who only bullied her in response. Ryan then encountered
   Angelique Martin
   , a fellow foster child who had snuck out of the home, and opened a window to let her inside. Angelique noticed that Ryan read a comic book featuring
   Ghost Kid
   , which she also liked. Angelique started reading the book and a friendship formed between the young girls.
  </p>
  <p key="91d2e4a6-daa6-4fd2-959a-4fd4fc767963">
   One day, Ryan went to
   Hero Galaxy Comics
   in
   <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvV2F5c2lkZV9IZWlnaHRzP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" key="a645e432-589c-4ea8-855b-bd6c3145b435" title="Wayside Heights (page does not exist)">
    Wayside Heights
   </span>
   to collect some free comic books, where she was kidnapped by
   Candice Long
   , who convinced Ryan to look at the comics in her van. She was taken to a house where she was held for several days. One day, the woman gagged Ryan and told her to be quiet. Ryan saw through the window that there was a student volunteer group asking the woman if she had seen a missing girl. Ryan tried to signal that she needed help until realizing that the group was looking for a
   white girl
   , causing her to give up, heartbroken.
  </p>

   Later, the woman also captured Angelique, who actually let herself be captured to find Ryan, who was very happy to see her friend, but feared for her since she herself had been there for weeks without a ransom. Hidden behind the door, Angelique attacked the woman, who retaliated with an aerosol spray that blinded Ryan, who had jumped between the two. Angelique hit the woman with a jar of candy and knocked her out. She then woke Ryan up so they could escape.

   As a teenager, Ryan was adopted by
   Cora Lewis
   . She would develop a strong bond with Cora and come to see her as her actual mother. With Cora's guidance, Ryan was able to graduate from high school and eventually come out as a lesbian, which her adoptive mother was very accepting of.
   At some point, Ryan received a vase of
   flowers
   from Angelique, which she later gave to Cora.

   On December 13, 2015,
   Ryan and Cora were moving into a new apartment where they were attacked by the
   Wonderland gang
   . The gang killed Cora and their landlord, before proceeding to beat Ryan up until the arrival of their leader,
   Alice
   , prompted them to leave. Ryan tried to save her adoptive mother with CPR, only to find that she was dead, leaving her alone to mourn for Cora. Ryan was subsequently instilled with a lasting hatred for Alice and her gang. According to Ryan, her world fell apart that day.

   Sometime after this incident, Ryan began a relationship with Angelique, though it was troubled due to the latter's criminal habits and drug use.
   Victor Zsasz
   came to know about the women's domestic problems.
   After being together for some time, Ryan noticed that Angelique's addiction had turned her into a different person. Trying to help her girlfriend get clean, Ryan found and stole her drugs. As she left Angelique's house, Ryan was noticed by two
   Crows Security
   agents, who catcalled her. In retaliation, she flipped them off, prompting the men to search her. Upon discovering the stash Ryan was carrying, they arrested her for drug possession and distribution. Ryan asserted that the drugs were not hers but the Crows did not believe her, since she refused to give up Angelique.

  <p key="2b08d945-28de-497b-9db1-0aff8ea85430">
   Ryan was sentenced to 18 months in
   Blackgate Penitentiary
   , a lesser sentence for a greater charge presented to her by the judge presiding over her case, that she was forced to make a plea deal of. Left with no other choice, Ryan had to cope within the prison’s rough and secluded environment, filled with ragtag occupants. For her own survival, lest she not live to see the day of her release, Ryan improved herself not just in body, but in mind. During this period, Ryan met Crows agent
   Sophie Moore
   , and came to dislike her.
   When Ryan was finally released, she was left living in a van with her mother's plant and struggled to put her life back together from scratch. It was implied that she even took up martial arts and did part-time teaching for people who were at least willing to hire Ryan for her tutelage and training services.

   One
   Halloween
   night, Ryan was walking through the streets of Gotham with a backpack and wearing a cat-ears hairband when she was approached by some criminals who ambushed and tried to rob her. They were about to kill her when they learned Ryan didn’t have much to offer, but she was saved by
   <a href="Kate Kane.html" key="e45df31e-0939-4a53-bb16-c22815548bf1" title="Kate Kane">
    Batwoman

   . During the scuffle, Ryan handled and somehow capably threw a
   Batarang
   for the first time, disarming a robber from a distance while the vigilante fought the man's cohorts. Ryan then looked on in complete awe and admiration as the Bat-themed crimefightress used her custom
   grapple gun
   to depart from the scene.

   Two months later,
   Ryan was sleeping in her van one night by the riverside, when she was awakened by debris falling from the sky that landed right in front of her van; Ryan went to investigate when she saw an airplane crashing from the sky and into the waterfront. Ryan immediately rushed to the wreckage to search for survivors and found a man in the wreckage. Unlike her adoptive mother, she was able to reach him just in time and revive him with CPR, though Ryan ended up puking as a result. She looked around and stumbled upon a
   red and black suit with a wig
   and figured out that Batwoman had been on the downed plane.
  </p>
  <p key="e5a069b3-a1dd-4c4e-8b37-fbd74cdf8931">
   The next morning, Ryan went to see her parole officer,
   Susan Stevens
   , and said that something good had happened in her life. And seeing Ryan's noticeably bright and indeed positive mood, Susan asked if it was a home or a job vacancy, and Ryan said no. Ryan said that nobody wanted to employ a former inmate, even one with a martial arts background like herself. But that did not matter; not with the recent developments happening to her life.
  </p>
  <p key="22369b6f-b13d-4c2f-b1e2-c3f2b0492685">
   Ryan then decided to wear the suit and defeat some members of the
   False Face Society
   , and all while also with the intent of grilling them for information on Alice's whereabouts. Choosing to privately don the Batsuit in an unkempt public restroom, she produced it from her bag and proceeded to displace her civilian clothes. It took a while for Wilder to figure out how and even mildly struggled as she garbed the outfit unto her person along with its affiliated accessories (i.e. wiggled cowl, gauntlets, cape, boots and compartmentalized belt). She finishes in the end and there she was: fully-attired in the Batwoman gear and Ryan, for a moment, struck a hands-on-hips pose as she checks herself out and admires the view of her wearing the suit being shown in and reflected back at her from the room’s mirror before setting forth to undertake what she intended to do whilst wearing it that night.
  </p>
  <p key="bd1df250-1be7-4885-ae99-b8a189b4a80a">
   She soon homed in on her targeted individuals — a pair of masked thugs loitering by their parked car in a secluded alley and getting ready to get high on some acquired dope. Ryan, with her gear’s installed voice filter switched on to make her voice unrecognizable, arrived thinking she could take them by surprise and then subdue them easily in Batwoman's guise, only for one of them to pull her down as she perches upside-down trying to scare him from overhead, slamming Ryan hard against the pavement.
  </p>
  <p key="fa3ba044-cd3a-4575-9e9a-085c66a69658">
   Wincing as she was loomed down upon, Wilder curses herself under her breath for her own imprudence by not considering that the False Face Society, and particularly these two members thereof that she was now facing against, may not fear Batwoman. The one who slammed her lunges at Ryan again, grabbing her by the shoulders, but with her right hand she manages to bring out the
   Grappling gun
   in time firing it over his right shoulder and at the rafters from above, freeing then pulling the Batsuited Ryan upwards and away from the thug’s hold; only to remain suspended and clumsily swinging to-and-‘fro there for a brief while as she is continuously shot at by the criminals from below.
  </p>
  <p key="668e7bde-bf4b-4ee4-a228-8017714f086b">
   She tumble-rolled then safely landed on all fours back on the alley’s street and getting back up on her feet, Ryan excitedly laughs in relief when she observes there’s not a mark on her as she stood up proper, realizing that wearing suit renders her impervious to gunfire. However, the cowl’s night vision eye-lenses were somehow incited and set into infrared mode by Ryan’s somewhat rough landing — causing her to unexpectedly see her attacker’s thermal readings though those lenses.
  </p>
  <p key="a830cbac-62b0-4d8c-b136-23e893b68703">
   Confused, Ryan begins tapping randomly at the buttons on her gauntlets, unknowingly activating the suit’s tracker and allowing its present location to be detected from the
   Batcave
   by
   Luke Fox
   . She eventually presses what retracted the lenses and the thugs, wonder and ask themselves if they are being confronted by a “wannabe Batwoman”. At that point, Ryan, who was still experimenting with her gauntlets, jabbed at a button on the left one. This launches forth
   Batarang
   that embedded itself through the right leg of one of the thugs, excruciatingly sending him down on one knee. Ryan awkwardly apologizes as the injury was accidental and thereby not her intent, not when she planned to interrogate them for some intel and that cannot happen if she incapacitates both of them.
  </p>
  <p key="e9fbf27a-f476-4b78-bfad-0a322026f1bb">
   The felled crook badmouths her in response and Ryan decides to use her own words. Telling them that she is searching for someone in the city’s criminal underbelly, and that their society may or may not have the information she seeks — hence the altercation taking place in the alley they are in. But the other masked thug did not appear ready to comply without a drawn-out fight yet. He tries to take this “Batwoman” on, resulting in the latter drop-kicking him onto the hood of his car and then rolling off to its side. The disguised Ryan kicks him again, slumping him by the vehicle’s right front wheel, and then menacingly threatens him with another button on her left gauntlet as she points the wearable item itself at him, hinting that she is still unsure of her suit’s overall capabilities and nor will she take responsibility for what will happen next after pressing that particular button if the goon doesn’t tell her anything useful.
  </p>
  <p key="7a996063-9ad0-4824-81b5-a6787e45f837">
   Obtaining new knowledge that not a single member of her Wonderland gang has been sighted for weeks, Ryan treks down into Gotham's underground sewers and was walking there all by herself when she was found by
   Luke Fox
   and
   Mary Hamilton
   , thanks to the Batsuit’s tracker evidently left still active. Spotting her costumed figure moving in and across of the tunnels, they mistook her for Kate in the Batwoman suit and ran up to Ryan only to see, in disappointment, that the young woman wearing the suit was one of color when she turned to face them. Understanding that they were confidantes of the original wearer of the suit she is currently donned in, whom this encounter just confirmed was the still-missing Kate Kane, Wilder blandly apologizes for disappointing them this way.
  </p>
  <p key="d2e754d0-ff91-4083-9201-f13324ee5506">
   Mary declares that keeping the suit is pointless, for it has an encrypted GPS tracking signature, and that Ryan must return the suit to them on the grounds that is still the original Batwoman’s property. Instead, Ryan takes off the cowl and formally identifies herself to them, then crassly refuses to return the suit since she has yet to conclude her interests for having it and even derided Kate for what she believes were shallow reasons as to why the billionaire took on the mantle as Batwoman, in response to Mary emphasizing that the Batsuit was explicitly meant to be worn by a hero - and certainly not up-for-grabs or to frivolously adorn someone who merely happened to salvage it from the plane crash that night. Luke chides her, indignantly expressing to Ryan that she doesn’t even begin to understand the full significance of the suit she’s presently wearing, let alone what it stands for whenever Kate wears it.
  </p>
  <p key="18b04a4c-5e30-4c60-acb0-98876fc12b8a">
   Wilder confirms that, completely self-aware that what she stood for was practically next to nothing. That she did not have credit to her name and nor was she a symbol or a legacy, prompting Mary to challenge why someone like Ryan - with said questionable worth - should be in Batwoman's literal trappings if that be the case? Ryan lashes out a retort that all her life she's been disadvantageously cornered and her foster mother, the person in Ryan's life who made it all bearable for the latter, was murdered with her killer still out there roaming free and that is just one case of many not graced by justice in the country; Ryan herself is an unjustly accused person and that she wanted to exact revenge for her mother's untimely death upon the parties responsible.
  </p>
  <p key="6e65d616-44b1-4d7e-80ae-a3d25779ff05">
   In conclusion, she callously assures Luke and Mary that she'll hand them back the Batwoman suit once she's finishes what she set out to do. And with that, Ryan used the grapple gun to get away leaving both of them impressed at Ryan’s skill with it and, at the same time, stumped at the rogue's macabre conviction.
  </p>
  <p key="2566645c-ee5f-4132-b6a4-65b653104e9c">
   Ryan then returned to her van and presumably figured out how to deactivate the traceable signal from the suit. In the following morning, she reads a news item in the newspaper about Kate's disappearance; Ryan was researching the person who wore the Batsuit prior to her, for the time of when Batwoman came to her rescue from a couple months back was still fresh in Wilder’s mind. She read and was moved by Kate's due story, leading to Wilder concluding that she was a real hero, suit donned or otherwise. Deciding that Kate Kane’s legacy deserves better and thus the suit needs to be in better hands, she promptly reactivates the installed beacon on the gauntlet so Luke and Mary could discern its location, and then she could surrender it to them when they arrive. Then Ryan fell asleep.
  </p>
  <p key="b36e6c58-20d2-4026-9141-a51f97243776">
   She was woken up by Luke's urgent voice on the suit’s communicator compelling her to get up and investigate. And right on cue as Ryan saw, after peering through her ride's rear door window, the
   Batmobile
   speeding towards her from behind so she started the van, culminating in a high-speed car chase across the abandoned amusement park where Ryan had her vehicle parked. As she drove past the rides, tents and stalls, Ryan asked if
   Batman
   was following her and Luke said “No!” over the comms, that it was actually
   Tommy Elliot
   , a fugitive from
   Arkham
   who looked like Bruce Wayne and would kill anyone to get the suit, not comforting Ryan in the slightest. Ryan opined to throw the suit out the window in hopes of drawing away the other vehicle’s driver away from her van and give up the chase, but Luke and Mary quickly said and insisted otherwise. For if Tommy got the suit then he would be Gotham's most dangerous person. Luke urges Wilder to get as far away from Tommy.
  </p>
  <p key="fa6b4af0-4563-4ea9-a97a-73e116342278">
   At Mary's hesitant suggestion, Luke succeeded at remotely hacking the Batmobile and Ryan managed to lose Tommy. Ryan’s armed pursuer now moving on foot gave her time to put on the suit and tried to catch him off-guard, but he had a shotgun with a single, substitute bullet out of
   <a href="Kryptonite.html" key="768288c8-a3b3-4cce-99e1-7062a1f76da7" title="Kryptonite">
    Kryptonite
   </a>
   - that was able to pierce the suit - loaded into it. Unaware of that, Ryan, again as Batwoman, descends down from the dilapidated roller coaster’s elevated tracks and lands several feet away from Tommy’s back. She announces that she knows the person there with her is not Bruce Wayne; and Tommy responds likewise, saying that neither is she Gotham’s premier queer heroine.
  </p>
  <p key="9d6fbb59-972b-4485-a5aa-98cccbac0029">
   Tommy fired, hitting Ryan square in the chest and knocking her down with the shot, and Ryan pretended to be down-for-the-count dead for her shooter to approach in order to collect the Batsuit from her body. When he got close, she rose up, grabs and disarms him, then tries to put Tommy in a submission hold using her legs and an arm around his neck, only for Elliot to roll-flip the dark-clad Ryan over himself breaking her hold. And clambering up her feet first, Ryan swung a low kick that sent her adversary to the grass-covered ground again. Ryan dodges a lunge then kicking him after he careens past her, leading to Tommy slamming to the rear doors of Ryan’s van and causing them to open.
  </p>
  <p key="b38e491e-a3cf-4926-acf6-9f84c916209a">
   They continued to fight; Tommy swings his fists at Ryan, who avoids them using agile right and left side-steps before thrusting forth a straight kick, stopping Elliot, then doubles it down with a full-clockwise spin hitting Tommy across the face with a right backhand that spun and sends her opponent stumbling to the rear threshold of the Batwoman-outfitted Ryan’s van and she follows. Reaching inside for a usable weapon, Tommy grabs then broke her mother's plant in the van. This elicited a big “No!” from Ryan and got her so furious that she violently gets into the altercation, blocking his hits while cleanly landing unopposed some of her own. All of it amounting to her felling Tommy down on his back, then Ryan mounting on him and brutally beating him up on the grass until his fake face came out. Standing teary-eyed but victorious, she informed Luke that it was over.
  </p>
  <p key="84876d32-8798-4ff6-8fd9-73a7da80d8e4">
   She went to Wayne Tower, before dawn, where she coolly returned the suit, in a duffel bag, to Luke and Mary noting to them, unimpressed, that the suit was not as impervious as she initially thought and even tossed to Luke the Kryptonite fragment that Tommy fired at her, having apparently performed first-aid on herself to dislodge the shard from her body, much to his and Mary’s concern with the latter wanting to see Ryan’s sustained injury herself since weaponized substance was said able to kill the wearer of the Batsuit, but the latter dismisses it. Ryan apologizes for her part regarding the suit’s present state, then kindly wishes them luck at finding Kate.
  </p>
  <p key="0c7f5c60-7e45-4fc1-96f2-75eb430c4359">
   Ryan takes her leave as Luke further inspects the damaged Batsuit on Kate’s desk; but Mary runs after her forcing the former to stop by the office’s threshold, turning around to face the latter again. The influencer-in-the-making brings up all the things Ryan said the night before as to why she needed the suit, and the homeless vagabond resignedly accedes they were right and that she was not worthy to wear much less use it, and left. She then returned to her van; and that night, Ryan with her beloved plant (now in a new pot) between her legs sat atop of her van as she gazes up to the sky at the
   Bat-Signal
   and as she contemplates her recent actions as of late, Ryan winces and she discovers that her fresh Kryptonite wound near her collarbone was affecting her in some way.

   She was next seen in formal attire and seated at a job interview at
   Bolton Security
   . Ryan, hoping to land a job there as security, confidently discloses her proficiency with the orthodox combative arts and the man, reviewing her offered file and resume, sees that she did time at
   Blackgate
   . Tentative, she confirms that though the circumstances that led up to her incarceration there were stacked against her - as she was presented by the judge with a choice in the plea she made, and it was either 18 months or 15 years that all made the difference.
  </p>
  <p key="d0c3aab3-dbff-4657-b6fc-6231097eb82b">
   Sensing that bringing up her ex-con background was not giving her much headway with the interviewer’s good favor, Ryan continues saying her time at Blackgate hardened her to not only be able to stand for and defend herself if need be, but also sharply assess any given situation to single out potential threats or simply to glean on another person's drives and motives just by the look on their faces. The interviewer leans back on his chair, intrigued but hiding it well, then asks Ryan what she thinks of him and Ryan sighs, saying that he was already prepped to turn down her application.
  </p>
  <p key="2ae101a3-06eb-417a-b6e0-8fc2ed953d2d">
   Later, Ryan walked between the aisles of a grocery store in what appears to be the Vitamins and Supplement section. Browsing the merchandise, she tried to get an item from one of the shelves when her shot injury, courtesy of Tommy Elliot, began to act up again halting Ryan. She gets flashbacks of the night that Elliot shot her in and through the Batwoman suit. Wincing as she feels around her still-recent wound with her right hand until the aching begun to wane again, she switches her selection and instead picks up a small container of extra-potent Ibuprofen with her other hand.
  </p>
  <p key="9b11f032-ea27-446e-8c1c-98a48c4ad4c5">
   Shrugging and unsatisfied, she calls out for a grocer nearby if they have any generic versions of that particular medication; and that was when Ryan spots an armed robbery in progress; two masked men, whom she did not notice until then, had just entered the establishment. One of them stood as lookout by the entrance and with a shotgun held in his arms, while the other striding towards the counter brandishing a gun at the cashier standing by the counter's other side.
  </p>
  <p key="6124435a-f288-4abd-804c-f73c4ad34e63">
   The cashier complies, extending out the cash to be taken and then pocketed by the one holding him at gunpoint. But that wasn't enough, it seems; demanding the grocery store’s office safe be opened next, the robber hits his hostage over the head with the butt of his firearm when the worker was slow to comply. And in an instant, Ryan was already on the assailant, hitting him in turn over the head with a piece of hard merchandise. The other one sees this and point his weapon at Ryan, forcing her to take cover behind the end of one of the aisles in proximity to both the door and the counter,
  </p>
  <p key="c4f91110-42cb-4efd-8c00-ef6f40a8e998">
   and narrowly avoiding getting shot at the cost of destroying some merchandise. After a second shot was fired, she grabs another grocery item and forcefully throws it at the stalking gunman, drawing out a loud groan from the latter. He brandishes his shotgun to try shooting her for the third time, only for Ryan to close the distance again by sliding across the floor towards him and rising half-way up to intercept his aim. Then, Ryan stands up to kick him up the groin and between the legs. She wrenches the gun from the robber’s hands and followed-up by swinging the weapon’s butt at his head - sending him crashing against the displaying shelf near the entrance.
  </p>
  <p key="eb935850-4ec6-41e5-a015-5221c582e9a2">
   But at that point, the other robber has stood up and recovered, ambushing Ryan from the side and behind with a rabbit punch that struck her at the back of the head and knocking her down. Miraculously, instead of inciting upon her more harm, he goes to help his felled cohort and together they ran off, leaving the grocery store as Ryan slowly rises up with her right hand over the occipital region of her head. Looking out to see that they're gone, Ryan then rushes over to the incapacitated grocer to inspect his condition. Just then, the sound of a gun click drew her attention back to the door to see a
   Crows
   agent
   pointing a gun at her and ordering her to submit. Ryan could only roll her eyes and she complied with a sad sigh.
  </p>
  <p key="a9704742-c697-49d5-b1d3-ef0294a835cf">
   She got taken and later seen in one of the Crows’ interrogation rooms. And this was not an unfamiliar sight for Ryan. Even less of a stranger was the distinct Crow operative who came to badger her: Sophie Moore. Ryan, jaded, looks at Moore as the latter enters the room and both of them exchanged familiarity-filled glances at each other. Walking up to the table at the room's center where the younger woman whose right wrist was cuffed to and already seated at, Sophie tosses her some ice cubes contained in a sealable plastic baggie, then opened up a case file that she brought with her and stood at the table’s other side opposite of Ryan. Moore starts the conversation by humoring Ryan who takes the baggie and gingerly presses it against the aching back of her head, and Ryan similarly responds by teasing Sophie back about her hair, saying she likes it.
  </p>
  <p key="d1698cda-745c-4f81-9c66-a801cd751cba">
   This sours Sophie’s mood a little, who would rather Ryan address her more formally but Ryan pipes up that they were too familiar with each other at that point to not be on a first-name basis. She then wonders if Moore got demoted, given the latter’s status in the Crows' ranks, yet currently overseeing a case of a petty armed robbery. Sophie responds in turn that such was a step-up in Ryan’s case, as she is usually brought in for questioning in regards of drug-related cases; apparently, she used to have a partner in that sad enterprise whom Ryan now parted ways with. Therefore, she could not give Sophie any information in that area. Ryan then defends herself saying that she didn’t rob the store, but Moore reviews the file detailing that Ryan was found standing over the unconscious cashier, with the shot gun at the crime scene bearing her fingerprints, and reading that out loud for Ryan to hear.
  </p>
  <p key="c4d3af3f-71b4-47f8-937c-6c824ee8fae8">
   Ryan argues that she in fact tried to stop it from taking place - and a skeptical Sophie understandably has her misgivings of the former playing the role of hero. And given Ryan’s recent stint at Batwoman not so long ago, that she of course cannot divulge to Sophie, she could only nod silently at the Jacob Kane's right-hand woman. The room’s door opens and in came the same agent who arrested Ryan at the store. He whispers to Moore of having reviewed the establishment’s security footage, which confirmed Ryan’s side of the story. Sophie scowls at Ryan, who gave her a triumphant smile knowing that Moore has no reason to hold here there now that this whole affair had just been cleared meaning that she’ll have to un-cuff Ryan and soon. Sophie apologizes and proceeds to do just that. And she heads over to untether Ryan, the latter cynically comments that the last jumble-up she suffered as result of the Crows not doing their job right only resulted in her staying behind bars for almost two years.
  </p>
  <p key="d235b07e-18b9-4640-a6f6-cc1b48e420bc">
   As Sophie undid the cuff, she gives Ryan a piece of advice: if staying in that part of Gotham puts her at a disadvantage day after day, perhaps Ryan should just pack up and move elsewhere where her luck might change. That struck a nerve. Ryan asks where can she find such a place in a city where the word of Crows Security is essentially the law. And they’ve cuffed people like Ryan more times than can be counted because they were easier to bring into custody than a murderous criminal mastermind like Alice, or any member of her gang. She stands up, edges in and gets into Sophie’s face confronting the latter that she knows why Jacob Kane and the rest of Crows has yet to fully resort lethal force in hunting down the Wonderland gang, particularly Alice herself. Sophie gets nervous but hides it; she informs that any feeling of sympathy Jacob may have had for Alice is long gone by now.

   Ryan stares at Sophie, confused and has absolutely no clue as to what the Crows agent meant by that. It was then revealed that she thinks Kane being secretly racist as the reason why he had been seemingly lenient towards Alice, by virtue of the criminal being Caucasian. Realizing that she may have said too much, Sophie gets defensive and promptly ushers Wilder away, showing Ryan the way out. Still nonplussed, Ryan repeats and muses on Sophie’s words, looking over her shoulder at Moore standing in the middle of the room as she left.

   After talking to Sophie, Ryan realizes that Alice is Jacob's lost daughter Beth Kane. Ryan goes to Mary's secret clinic to confront her on this and becomes sympathetic to her when Mary reveals she hates Alice as much as she does due to Alice killing her mother.

   's corpse, leaving Ryan disgusted as Mouse's corpse is covered in bite marks. Ryan stayed with Mouse’s body on a metal slab as Mary conducted her medical forensic tests in the other room when Luke walks in, quipping that people from all walks of life can indeed come in and go from Mary’s secret place either at their own leisure, stressing Ryan’s presence there.
  </p>
  <p key="b81c762a-6839-402f-8240-76751aec9db9">
   Wilder rolls her eyes as Luke himself moves over to inspect the corpse, wondering what manner of fauna could have done this much damage — which he identifies as severe bite marks and apparently too many to count for the assumption that all of it was done by a single individual. Wilder morbidly voices that dying like this counts as unthinkable in her book. Mary approaches, denoting to Fox and Wilder that Mouse’s wounds happened after he died apparently by poison. And not just any poison; Mary affirms that the same toxin that claimed her mother’s life was used. Only one individual outside of
   Hamilton Dynamics
   would have access to it; Alice. Just then, the corpse they were observing suddenly spasms. The spasm went on, intensifying until a bat burst from and flew right out of poor Jonny’s chest then glided about in the clinic. Witnessing that, Ryan screams and both Luke and Mary cast incredulous looks at her. Wilder reveals that she hates bats.
  </p>
  <p key="266840f4-407e-4161-a2ce-323c1f1d3dd5">
   They later recaptured the bat and placed it inside a glass case. Wilder notes it coming out of Mouse postmortem that Alice must have allowed the bats to feast on his body. Finding the idea disturbing kept on flying within the case’s confines, Mary replies with a grimace that this must be how Alice sees “closure” should be like. Luke walks in with his smartphone in hand and informs them of just receiving a call from
   Julia Pennyworth
   . Alice all but admitted to Pennyworth of having a massacre planned out and already in the works, before stabbing her in the back, but Luke told Ryan and Mary that Julia was fine. When Luke and Mary tried to find out where Alice would carry out her plan, Ryan saw a protest being broadcast on TV and realized it would be there. She then warned Luke and Mary. Ryan suggested that she dress up as Batwoman so she can disperse the crowd before the attack, but Luke said they would realize that she was not Batwoman, since she was white and Ryan is colored. After a brief discussion between them, Ryan is allowed to wear the Batsuit by giving the people a sighting of Batwoman.
  </p>
  <p key="73ffce85-3e89-4a9a-a457-9986c2952b6a">
   Ryan put on the Batsuit and awkwardly landed on the roof of one of the tall buildings near Gotham Plaza. From the Batcave and through communications on the hood of the Batsuit, Luke assures her that no one saw her lose her balance when landing; except him and Mary. Luke at one tells Ryan that she could have used her cape as a parachute to further stabilize her descent, ensuring a disgruntled response from her. Ryan then went to the front of the building so that the protesters could see it, but it didn't work out of the blue. Ryan then waited for tips on how to look legitimately heroic and inspirational as the vigilante she was trying to impersonate. Amongst the protesters, a teenage girl spots Ryan in the Batwoman suit and notifies the others of that, telling them of the vigilant bat returning at last before the public’s eye. Noticing she's garnering the crowd's sought attention just like she and the Bat Team planned-with her spoken words voice-filtered, she proceeded imploring to the rallied protestors to depart immediately from the plaza, for something terrible was about to happen there. Unfortunately, they were unable to hear her as she was very much on top of and several storeys up above the crowd.
  </p>
  <p key="22e74a16-1621-4449-903c-0d9026d5cf35">
   Failing to properly hear or comprehend even a single word from what “Batwoman” was saying to them, the protestors stood their ground showering adulation up at the vigilante, much to Ryan’s frustration. Just then, she heard the slow sound of clapping from somewhere behind her. Turning from her perch, she finds a less-than-impressed and condescending Alice, all alone and slow-clapping as she regards Ryan, knowing at once that she is not her sister but also admitting that this person in Kate’s vigilante get-up is a complete stranger to her. The shocked Ryan seemed fearful for a second before the surprised look on her face ominously transitioned into fury.
  </p>
  <p key="ef60817c-10ee-4c9b-a3da-ef95e7a2ee61">
   Alice mock-congratulates this unknown female wearing Kate’s Batsuit in front of her for easily deceiving the hapless percentage of Gotham. But being talked down as a fraud like that bore no weight for the life-hardened Ryan. She jumps down from the ledge and starts walking slowly in each step on the same level taken towards Alice. Luke tries discouraging the latter from engaging the latter into an altercation, but Ryan disregarded that despite not ignorant of Alice's infamy as a proficient murderer, seeing how the latter had an hand on the demise of her foster mother Cora. Ryan then says that she will kill Alice, which frightens Luke and Mary. Luke said she can't do that, since Batwoman doesn't kill, prompting Ryan to reply that she is not Batwoman, as Luke had said before. Ryan then disables the suit communicator.
  </p>
  <p key="5201f766-e4d2-4100-abe9-dae735caea11">
   Whipping out a pair of pistols, Alice repetitively shoots Ryan several times but to no avail since the Batsuit is bulletproof. Alice then realizes that this is the real batsuit. She decides to change tactics and challenge Ryan in hand-to-hand combat, in which Ryan narrowly won and was about to kill her.
  </p>
  <p key="9369d8a0-6900-4813-a29b-c72e0069e36b">
   So Alice uses a device to summon a swarm of bats that attacks the crowd below, distracting Ryan and allowing Alice to escape. Ryan was going to chase her but Luke managed to say that she had to choose the crowd. So Ryan let Alice escape. Luke espies through the sensors and relays to Ryan that a sub-sonic frequency is pulsing somewhere in the plaza — most likely a hidden transmitter planted by Alice that’s luring the bats there. He recommends Ryan to go down there and find it.
  </p>
  <p key="e9832ff8-841b-4c61-a37d-043175f76138">
   Luke also recommends Wilder to incite the cowl’s eye-lenses so he could remotely set their allowed perspective into the mode that “views” sounds inaudible to the unassisted human hearing ability so they hopefully may locate the sub-sonic transmitter. So, Ryan quickly descends and safely sets foot somewhere on the plaza after selecting she should land there and then jumping off from the ledge, cape-parachuting down. Upon landing, she surveys her chaotic environment with and through the Batsuit’s white-tinted, sliding cowl lenses over eyes; the Crows, GCPD, Gotham news anchor teams and even the generic civilians already got their hands full with rabid bats in a biting frenzy to pay the new Batwoman much heed.
  </p>
  <p key="53e94232-e9b0-4165-a373-3cb29501ff68">
   Via the said lenses’ detection of sub-sonic, Ryan soon spots the device. The pulsing seems to be originating from one of the newspaper dispensers in a group of such close to where she landed on; so Ryan nears them and singles out the specific dispenser she seeks, disengaging the eye-lenses. That way, she can then see in normal view when casing that particular vessel and urgently rips open its compartment door on the side using both hands, revealing the beeping contraption that Alice hid inside. Ryan takes it, exclaiming to Luke on the comms of her find; then she glances behind her as her mind races on what she must do next. Not too far from where she is was Crows agent Sophie Moore saving helpless citizens from the attack, not noticing until almost too late that a bat was gliding towards her left. Thankfully, the critter was slapped down by Ryan Wilder. The agent observes this new arrival just as the costumed Ryan reciprocates to see if the former was alright. And like with her commanding superior, Sophie quickly distinguishes that this unfamiliar woman now garbed in the Batsuit is not the original.
  </p>
  <p key="e61ab383-692f-434c-b37f-40976d932266">
   Sophie asks who she was, and the latter pragmatically responds that she is her savior. Ryan then walks past the Crows agent as she converses, through the comms, with Luke on what her next step should be. The latter suggests destroying the gadget and Ryan refuses; for even with the transmitter gone, this colony of poisonous bats will still remain in Gotham. Luke brings up the “suggestion box” idea and one comes up in Ryan’s mind on the spot after looking down on and then up from the device in her hand. She says that neither of them shall probably like it. She then enters the Batmobile. Later, the car sped over and across Gotham’s paved streets. Soundly overtaking and driving past other moving cars as she steered on the streets - and all the while, a poisonous bat swarm gliding and flapping after the Batmbile.
  </p>
  <p key="28ceeed3-b0a4-4235-b975-7d0154983821">
   With Luke in the Batmobile’s comms, he and Ryan spar-quibbled for a while on where to best attract the bats chasing the latter without hurt more people. Luke suggests a number of possible sites to bait the bats into — all of which were continually refuted by Ryan as she desperately drove. At some point, Wilder made the Batmobile do a crisp turn to the left, on an intersection, that fleetingly diverted the pursuing bats for a moment before they corrected themselves and went after the again.
  </p>
  <p key="e6e5c5b2-2353-4d16-adb4-f342bb76f0c1">
   Ultimately, Ryan glimpses a Crows’ affiliated detainment bus driving towards the Batmobile and that gave her an idea, piquing Luke’s attention. But Ryan defends that it was probably best she let her actions to the talking. She abruptly hits the brakes, decelerating at once before the bus and compelling the latter’s driver to follow suit. Noticing this from the Batcave’s feeds, Luke demands Wilder of her intent only for Ryan to confess that she isn’t so sure herself as she takes the transmitter, exits the Batmobile and strides over to the detainment bus and begs its driver to exit his respective vehicle. When said driver refuses, Ryan reacts by pulling out her grapple gun and brandished it at the Crow operative, intrinsically turning a pressing request between a vigilante and a lawman into an on-the-street stick-up.
  </p>
  <p key="020a2a38-b426-4735-ad91-da4448ba11a7">
   Forced to do what she said, the driver promptly opens the doors on the right side of the bus and exits it through them. Wilder enters and hangs the transmitter by the bus’ rearview mirror, then closes the vehicle’s passenger doors. Then she jogs towards the bus’ rear door just as the bats concentrate on where she left the device coaxing them onto the device’s position. She opens the door wide for the critters to fly into the bus to collect them all inside, while also raising her cape up and making sure that it covers her well enough to keep them away from herself. It did not take long before every one of Alice’s weaponized bats were now in the bus’ interior’ so Ryan closes it shut before rearing a few steps back and unlatches a compact incendiary from her utility belt; she unpins and tosses it under the bus’ chassis.
  </p>
  <p key="722061f6-c03b-463a-974a-5b7928a734c3">
   Just then, Ryan turns behind her to notice a homeless teenage girl getting up from and out of a ramshackle tent, hearing all that vehicular commotion. Yelling to take cover, Wilder rushes over to her side and wraps the teen in her cape in time just as the bus detonates — killing all the bats. She and the girl she just saved straightened up, as Ryan pulls back her cape from the younger girl, at the sight of the destroyed vehicle; the latter wonders if the person next to her was Batwoman and Wilder declines. But the girl insists that Wilder is Batwoman, to her anyway, looking up with grateful admiration at the disguised Ryan.

   Ryan later went to
   Batcave
   and received Luke and Mary's blessing to operate as Batwoman in Kate's place; at least until Kate returns; becoming the second Batwoman and part of the Bat Team in the process. Ryan started writing for Kate in her diary just like Kate did for Bruce.

   Later, Ryan, as Batwoman, intercepted a transaction between an addict and a masked dealer from the
   False Face Society
   . However, her entry was not perfect, as she had a slight stumble when landing that almost unbalanced her after the touchdown, she said she would have made it if the boots didn't tighten. As she threw batarangs to try to stop the dealer, Luke tells her to stop wasting them, because it costs $ 1,000 each. The criminal said she was not the Batwoman and she waited for an answer from Luke, but did not come. The suit started to beep, so she knocked out the thug and asked Luke to call the police since she had another appointment.

  <p key="8abc10e5-79d6-4964-9ef0-5c10595b5c25">
   Ryan arrived at
   Susan Stevens
   ' office, who asked her if she was late because she got a job. So Ryan went to Mary's clinic and said she was going to get a call and had to say yes. Mary got a call from Susan, who asked her if she had given Ryan a job at
   The Hold Up
   , and Mary said yes, with Ryan pushing her. Mary told Ryan that the job at the club would be a good idea for her to hide her secret identity, as they were going to spend the whole time together. Ryan then questioned her what "all the time" would be like since she would only be Kate's temporary replacement, so Mary said she needed to get back to work. At the Batcave, Ryan, Luke and Mary saw on the news that a man had invaded Hamilton Dynamics and killed two employees. Ryan asked what he stole and Mary said that she did not know what it was, since she had sold her shares and does not participate in the affairs of the council. Ryan then realized that Mary is rich and asked why she earns so little at the club. Luke asked why she started working at Hold Up, and Ryan said that his probation officer kept asking for a job.

  <p key="527d9878-bcc4-42d3-9d10-58f513ae6a85">
   Eventually, Ryan also realized that the man who invaded Hamilton Dynamics is
   Victor Zsasz
   . Luke asked how she knew him and Ryan said that they know people in common. Susan called Ryan and said she was waiting for her at the club, so she had to go, and said she would look after Zsasz when they found his address. When they found Zsasz, Ryan donned the suit and went over to his apartment, where she found the stolen drive, but Victor was there. Ryan looked for batarangs in the suit and Luke said she used them all, so he asked her to use the bo-staff. Zsasz asked what happened to the previous vigilate and Ryan said she didn't need to answer an old man who uses his skin to sharpen knives. Zsasz said the suit did not belong to her and she was not Batwoman. Then he fired a rocket launcher at Ryan. She manages to dodge by jumping out of the window and returns to Batcave. The Bat Team plugged the drive into the computer and saw a large list of names that Zsasz was going to kill. So Ryan volunteered to speak to him to find out who hired him, not as Batwoman, but as Ryan, with Luke's reluctance. So, she asked Mary to purse of money to make the deal with Zsasz.
  </p>
  <p key="501295a4-7ba9-427f-8143-8c6303cf7333">
   She found him at a restaurant and asked if he remembered her. She said she was dating Angelique Martin, so Zsasz decided to listen to her. She asked him to kill Alice since her gang had killed her mother, but he denied it and left. Ryan then asked Luke if she had come close enough to his cell phone. Luke said yes and that the mystery customer was
   Safiyah
   .
  </p>
  <p key="615bb1d6-19eb-45f6-ac8a-4c7561fc3ba7">
   Ryan later returned to Batcave and made some modifications to the suit. She then went to Wayne Tower and received a call from Mary, saying that the Desert Rose had cured the cancer of a patient. Luke realized that everyone on the list had been healed by the rose after the attack of infected bats. Later, Mary said that Zsasz broke into the clinic. Ryan told Luke to keep calling while she went to put on the modified suit. Luke said the suit was perfect and Ryan asked if he had seen the damn wig. When Zsasz was going to kill Mary, Ryan arrived in the new costume and stopped him. They had a brief fight and Zsasz took it down. So Ryan used the bo-staff and knocked him out. Mary came over and said she loved the new wig, Ryan smiled and used the grapple gun to leave.

  <p key="127b506d-ade0-47a5-95ee-15e6ff770452">
   The next day, Ryan returned to the parole officer. Where they talked about the new Batwoman and Ryan's new job. Susan later said that she should get a new home or she would report it. Ryan then started working on Hold Up. Luke arrived and asked how the journalists got a professional photo of Batwoman, and Ryan said that Mary was taking care of the publicity. Luke gave her a new batarang and Ryan said he would train his aim. Luke apologized for distrusting him and Ryan said he understands, but he needs to give her a chance until Kate comes back. Luke agreed and Ryan asked if she could make any improvements to the Batmobile. Luke said she went crazy and left, making Ryan smile.

   When Kate is declared dead due to body parts found in
    Bludhaven
    , Ryan has permanently taken on Batwoman's mantle. She was at her apartment with Mary when Angelique arrived. She apologized and wanted them to come back. When Commissioner
    Forbes
    was murdered, Ryan and the Bat Team investigated and found that
    Jordan Moore
    had witnessed what had happened. When Jordan and Sophie were going to be attacked by the
    False Face Society
    , Ryan saved them. Jordan revealed to Batwoman that she saw that the driver of the getaway car had a hanger that Ryan knew whose she was, Angelique. So she went after Angelique and confronted her. Ryan said he would protect her and Ange asked how. Ryan thought about telling the truth, but instead she said she knew Batwoman. Ryan then went to the Batcave and told the rest of the Bat Team the truth about Angelique. After a brief discussion, they decided to do it in Ryan's way. Later, Ryan met Jordan and Sophie at The Hold Up.

After an investigation, she discovered Angelique's location to an abandoned place, where she was attacked by members of the False Face Society and arrested. She woke up and saw the

     Ryan is proven to have good morals; for example, killing and torturing her enemies is a line that she would never cross, although she initially intended to kill
      Beth Kane

     Cora Lewis

     Ryan is extremely distrustful towards
      Crows Security
      to the point that she refuses to work with that organization, as she doesn't trust their intentions for good reason, partly due to the fact that two Crow agents arrested her for a crime that she never committed (as they are indirectly responsible for ruining Ryan's life) and that Crows tried to kill her predecessor, Kate (the original Batwoman) in cold blood, but mainly due to their immoral and dishonourable ways. Ryan's hated towards the crows is also to the point that she refers to them as "bastards".
    </p>
    Ryan is quite cold to the point of being hostile towards individuals she does not trust, such as
     Sophie Moore
     , due to her being a member of the Crows, as she coldly stated to the latter: "until you resign from that organization, we will no longer be working together".

Now that the suit has been tailored to fit her, Ryan now lands perfectly on her feet, especially when grappling onto buildings.

    As a former martial arts instructor and ex-convict, Ryan is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist who (according to her) is versed in at least half a dozen fighting disciplines and could even mentor others in that respect. Her fighting style seems to comprise of Boxing, Karate, Taekwondo, Jujitsu, Judo, and Kali. Although it was inferred that she had been out of active practice for some time, Ryan was still able to subdue members of the
     False Face Society
     and bested
    Tommy Elliot
    in their first confrontation. Even Alice took notice and appreciated Ryan's apparent intent to kill following the brief skirmish between herself and this new Batwoman, deeming that the latter will prove to be a "handful" in comparison to

    , who always stayed her hand from delivering the killing blow when it came to combating Kate's own twin, Alice. Ryan was able to easily subdue the members of Russell Tavaroff's murder of Crows, and beat Tavaroff himself on two occasions. However, in her only altercation with Black Mask, she was defeated, though this is due to the fact that Black Mask used dirty tactics. Ryan later fought on par with Tatiana, forcing the latter to retreat. When fighting against Kate Kane as Circe Sionis, Ryan was beaten by her in two of their fights, though Ryan managed to defeat her in their third fight, even when Kate was wearing an altered form of the Batsuit. She was able to easily defeat members of the mercenaries who took Nora Fries, though she lost to the head mercenary, though that was due to her catching Ryan off-guard.

She is also skilled in using two batons, able to hold her own against Circe Sionis and Tatiana, even causing the latter to retreat. She was also able to take down members of the Arkham Asylum orderly relatively easily using her staff.

     Keen-level intellect/Expert investigator/Expert tactician:
    </b>
    Ryan is a very intelligent individual and an excellent investigator; she deducted Kate Kane's identity as Batwoman, after only finding the
     Batsuit
     from the wreckage of Kate's plane. After encountering
     Luke Fox
     and
     Mary Hamilton
     in the sewers, they mistook her for Kate, which only confirmed her presumption. After
     Sophie Moore
     unwittingly stated that
     Jacob Kane
     no longer holds any sympathy for
     Alice
     , Ryan was able to correctly infer that Alice is Beth Kane, and soon after confronted Mary. Despite Ryan's former low-class status, she was able to figure out how to operate most of the Batsuit's advanced tech in record time, albeit it took her longer to master the others - discounting the fact that she faced some difficulty exploiting them in the heat of battle for the very first time. As a former convict of close to a 2-year sentence, Ryan is also experienced in threat assessment, gauging individuals and looking over her shoulder in order to survive, having been in the company of Gotham's worst during her stay at
     Blackgate
     and still thriving in the presence of the unscrupulous and uncivilized living here and there as a homeless person on the city's treacherous streets. That said, Ryan is very knowledgeable with the transient community of Gotham to know where such individuals or groups of them can be found clustered together or individually scattered after being pushed aside from the presence of the upper and middle classes, along with where those on the opposite side of the law would usually nest or briefly stay to simply enjoy their leisure. Ryan is also quite an adaptive thinker and problem-solver who can conceive immediate solutions and credible answers, respectively, on the fly; moreover, she is just as quick on her feet enabling her to execute them near-efficiently and close to flawlessly. With these serendipitous qualities, Ryan saw to it that Alice's toxic bats were expunged from the city without risking anyone else as collateral damage, using herself to lure them away as she sped off in the Batmobile. As Ryan puts it, word-for-word to Luke and Mary, her time in the company of criminals acclimated Ryan with the workings of crime, organized or petty, in Gotham's dark underbelly - giving her the insight on how criminality plots and operates, particularly in their city. But most importantly, how to break off said perpetrators and their bearings, if need be, in ways that Kate; due to her privileged upbringing, must have and inevitably overlooked. After significant mental training, Ryan became the
     Bat Team
     's "certifiable genius", with the title being given to her by Alice.

Later, in the Batmobile, she expertly drove the specialized conveyance through Gotham while being pursued by a colony of envenomed bats - making an abrupt turn at one point that momentarily threw them off as they were hot on Ryan's trail.

    A driven and determined individual, Ryan is nearly fearless and almost never gives up under most situations. After being shot with Kryptonite, Ryan immediately rose up again within seconds to readily fight and took down her shooter; she is able to put up with the lasting effects of the inflicted wound displaying signs of discomfort for only brief periods. Ryan would later display her tenacity in single combat against Alice - matching the latter nearly blow for blow, despite of the apparent size difference between them, until the former finally succeeds restraining the criminal by forcing her down on one knee and then gripping firm with both hands around Alice's neck. One of her greatest displays of tenacity was when she was able to stay awake for quite some time despite being nearly frozen to death. She was also able to drive off Professor Pyg's paralytics not long after being poisoned. Despite getting a stinging feeling when shot by a gun while in the Batsuit, unlike Kate, Ryan does not wince when getting shot with a gun nor makes a face when in pain.

Sometimes the infection distracts Ryan from her current mission. Ryan had felt exhaustion and even dizziness as the wound had gotten more infected. It was eventually revealed that the kryptonite's radiation was still in Ryan's blood system, as it was slowly poisoning her; the only medicine that can cure it, is the

And for a time, Ryan wore Kate's same wig that is part of the Batwoman guise until the former adopted a new look to her own version of the Bat-themed superheroine who came before her - sporting a dual-toned, very curly brown wig with red endings spreading and trailing down the back of her cowl.

Ryan can deploy these either by hand - either as a melee or throwing weapon - or by firing them from a special launching mechanism that Luke included into one of the Batsuit's gauntlets. Luke personally modified one of the Batsuit's custom-built gauntlets into a projectile weapon launcher; pressing a specified button on It would result in a Batarang fired forth from the wearable - an alternative way deploying the normally hand-thrown implement into battle.
