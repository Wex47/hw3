    Raymond Carson "Ray" Palmer
   </b>
   (born 1981
   ), is a businessman and the former CEO of
   Palmer Technologies
   , previously known as
   Queen Consolidated
   . He is the son of
   David
   and
   Sandy Palmer
   and younger brother of
   Sydney Palmer
   , who in at least one version of the future is considered to be the father of the robotics industry. Ray is the husband of
   Nora Darhk
   , the ex-fiancé of
   Kendra Saunders
   and the late
   Anna Loring
   , and the ex-boyfriend of

   Having designed a powerful
   exosuit
   , Ray began acting as a vigilante in

   <b key="0a564c2a-6907-4007-8118-d5dbe30794b1">
    The Atom
   </b>
   . While testing out a new function of his exosuit, Ray accidentally caused an explosion which shrunk him to a miniature size; stuck in this state and unable to call for help, he was presumed dead. After six months, during which time the city was renamed "Star City" in his honor, Ray managed to contact Felicity but was captured by
   Damien Darhk
   and
   H.I.V.E.
   for his technology. However, thanks to the efforts of
   Team Arrow
   , Ray was rescued and would continue to aid them in their fight against Darhk.

   In early 2016, Ray was recruited by time-traveler
   Rip Hunter
   into the
   Legends
   on a mission to take down
   Vandal Savage
   . After Ray's A.T.O.M. suit was destroyed during a mission in Feudal
   Japan
   ,
   Mick Rory
   gave him the

    Colonel Cold

   , using both
   Leonard Snart
   's weaponry and goggles. After getting a new source of
   dwarf star

   Ray was possessed by a powerful demon,
   Neron
   , after accidentally interfering in
   Nora Darhk
   and
   John Constantine
   's efforts to subdue the demon until Neron killed Nate (voiding the deal he made: sparing Nate in exchange for control of his body), allowing John to kill Neron and grant Ray his body back.

   Post-Crisis, Ray helped the Legends fight the
   Encores
   such as Damien Darhk, who gave his blessing for Ray to marry Nora. After getting married, Ray and Nora chose to leave the Legends and focus on Nora's job as a Fairy Godmother.

  <p key="66310f0f-5aa7-440f-afbe-c5689d891aa7">
   Ray went to
   Central City
   for the Technology Convention, where he met a member of

   and his fan,
   Chester P. Runk
   . Ray helped

   Ray was born in 1981 to
   David
   and
   Sandy Palmer
   in
   Ivy Town
   and had a twin brother,
   Sydney

   fancying himself as "
   Sir Galahad
   " and naming his personal playground in the woods after the legendary
   Camelot
   .
   He was inspired to become an engineer and inventor after watching

   In 1988, Ray had come across a time-displaced baby
   Dominator
   alien as he was hiding away from some bullies.
   He befriended the alien and named it
   Gumball
   . Ray took Gumball home, fed him candy and watched movies with him. Soon, the situation drew the attention of the
   NSA
   , who wanted to capture Gumball to study him.

   Ray tried to free his friend from the NSA, but the agents shot him before he could. Ray's body was left in the woods for the authorities to find days later, with enough damage done that it required dental identification. An article was written about him post-death by
   Ivy Town Times
   , although his family was too shaken to comment for it, and faculty at
   Ivy Town Middle School
   began working on a “Ray Palmer Memorial Garden", where they planned to grow Ray's favorite snack.

   However, this event sent a ripple through time that drew in
   a strange group of people
   , unknowingly including his future self. Ray, with help from
   Zari Tomaz
   and his future self, rescued Gumball from the NSA agents. After they escape, Ray reunited Gumball with his
   mother
   , tearfully letting him go. Back home, Zari assured Ray that he did the right thing and that he would go on to find people that he fit in with, urging him to stay positive. Ray then went trick-or-treating as "The Atom", with his new adult friends standing by him against the teasing from his bullies.

After she dismissed his proposal, he inquired about a satellite frequency communicator, which she automatically assumed he had no knowledge of. However, he proceeded to show his extensive technological knowledge of them, which prompted Felicity to suggest the forthcoming TX50 model. She also suggested using a remote administration tool. Following their encounter, Ray used the satellite frequency communicator to hack

After a moving speech from Oliver, Ray stood up to give his bid. As a screen came down, he noted how one of the board members had one of his smartwatches, which he was especially proud of. Heading back on track, Ray began talking about Queen Consolidated's performance figures shown on the screen, noting that the figures showed on screen (which he'd previously retrieved with the help of the satellite frequency communicator) were not big enough for Wall Street. He noted, however, that the low percentages were not Oliver's fault, but the city's fault on a whole. Ray went on to describe his hopes that when Queen Consolidated metaphorically "rose from the ashes," that it would take the city with it, naming this new version of the city "Star City." The board elected Ray to be the new CEO and he planned to rebrand the company into
   Palmer Technologies

   A few days later, Palmer bought the holding company which owned all Tech Village stores. When Felicity discovered the news, Ray made an attempt to hire Felicity for an office job at Palmer Technologies, which Felicity angrily declined. Ray quickly realized that Felicity wasn't mad at him, realizing something was wrong. He tried to assure Felicity things would brighten up. At his Star City pledge, Ray announced he would give half of his net-worth to the benefit of Starling City to become Star City. The benefit was soon crash by

The man started the topic about cogeneration and made some preliminary calculations. Instead of selling energy to the city, he wanted to give it away for free. Conversation was interrupted by the doorbell and the visitor was Felicity's mother. Palmer was surprised by the difference in personality between women when she suddenly noticed him. At first she thought he was staying with her daughter, but when she found out who the man was, she linked him to the SmartWatch she had bought. Ray introduced her to the prototype of the latest model and gave it back to her. He decided to leave both women and left the house.

The next day, Palmer visited Felicity's offices again, with whom he wanted to talk about cogeneration. There he noticed a mother hugging her daughter, who seemed happy.

He told her a story about his ex-fiancée - Anna, who died during the night of the siege. The man blames himself for her death all the time, as he failed to protect her and therefore tried not to bond with other women. After this conversation, Felicity decided to return to the office to find Ray sitting over the microscope. The girl started asking him what exactly he was doing with the company, so Palmer decided to show her.

Ray gave the example of the Arrow, which has no armor and is alive, but Miss Smoak was not sure about it. To end this discussion, the man asked her friend to repair the glove chip. In the evening, Ray visited the girl in her office, where he saw her all crying. When he asked how the chip repair was progressing, Felicity announced that it would not succeed. She referred to Anna and said that the exoskeleton would not revive her, because when we lose someone, they go away forever and nothing will return them to us. Palmer noticed his friend's behavior and upset decided that she had no right to say what his ex-fiancée would like. Miss Smoak apologized to the man and left the office.

Deciding that she would not help him on the suicide mission, she dressed and left. Some time later, Ray and Felicity entered the building where the meeting was being held.

   In January 2016, Ray helped Oliver with a mission to stop several
   H.I.V.E.
   ghosts. After defeating them, he was intercepted by
   Rip Hunter
   . The former
   Time Master
   presented a proposal to form a
   team
   to take down
   Vandal Savage
   , a future dictator before he could rise to power. Rip promised Ray that he and the other potential members of the team would be remembered as legends. Ray returned to Oliver to seek his friend's advice, and ultimately accepted Rip's offer. Other members of Rip's team included

   Next, the team headed to Norway, where Savage was holding a black market auction of a nuclear bomb. Against Rip's wishes, they went after Savage during the auction. However, Savage sensed the presence of Kendra and Carter, ordering the other attendees to kill them all. A huge fight broke out and Ray emerged from Martin's pocket and joined the fight. However, the team failed to kidnap Savage, and Ray left a piece of his exosuit behind, altering history. Martin and Ray deduced that the exosuit's alpha particles could be tracked with a device created by a younger Martin Stein in 1975. While the rest of the team tracked down the exosuit tech, Ray accompanied Leonard and Mick to steal the
   Amon Dagger
   from the mansion of a "
   Sasha Mahnovski

Mahnovski, who was actually Vandal Savage, revealed he was the owner of the dagger. The team then came to rescue them. Ray helped the team hold off Savage's forces while Kendra and Carter went after Savage. Unfortunately, Savage got the upper-hand, killing Carter and critically wounding Kendra, forcing the team to retreat. Back on the time ship, the team renewed their commitment to defeating Savage in memory of Carter.

   When the team touched down in
   Leipzig

However, during a first attempt, Ray was only able to destroy one of the fragments before another smashed into him, causing him to panic and abort the procedure. He resented the fact that Martin didn't remember him as one of his top students. Later, Martin confided to Ray that he acted like he didn't remember Ray because he was jealous that as one of his students, Ray seemed more brilliant than he was. Ray then admitted to Martin that he panicked because the situation reminded him of how he wasn't able to save his fiancée,
   Anna
   . Martin guided a newly-confident Ray through Kendra's bloodstream and they managed to destroy all of the remaining dagger fragments. He then noted to Martin that he realized Martin lied about remembering him as a student, but Martin justified it by saying that Ray needed the push. After the rest of the team recovered Carter's body from Savage, they held a funeral for Carter and Aldus.

Exosuit in order to both keep the peace and subdue anyone found to be a violation of the law. Ray was appalled by this appropriation of his technology. While Rip and the other members of the team set out to kidnap
   Per Degaton

   Sydney

However, as Bryce referred to her ancestor as simply Dr. Palmer, Ray mistook the bust to be of his own image, and came to the incorrect conclusion that he must have had an illegitimate child in the 21st century in order for Bryce to have been born.

When Hex explained that their actions in the saloon would cause the deceased outlaw's gang, the Stillwaters, to raid Salvation in retaliation, Ray insisted on going with Hex to the local sheriff's office in order to assist in any way that he could. When Ray and Hex arrived, however, they found that the sheriff was abandoning his post. On his way out the door, the former sheriff stuck his badge in Ray's open hand, naming him the new sheriff of Salvation.

   Ray, now determined to protect the town, met the
   Stillwater Gang
   at the entrance to Salvation when the outlaws returned for retribution. Ray had strategically placed Leonard with a rifle in an open window overlooking the road; when Ray refused to let the gang take whatever they wanted,
   Jeb Stillwater
   , the gang's leader, reached for his pistol, which Leonard immediately shot out of his hand. Ray proclaimed that he had sharpshooters surrounding the Stillwaters, and the gang begrudgingly rode off on their horses, temporarily defeated. Hex, knowing that the bandits would only return after Rip's team left Salvation, convinced Ray and the others to form a posse to ambush the Stillwater gang at their hideout. During the ensuing firefight, Ray and his allies captured Jeb Stillwater, though the gang managed to lasso and kidnap Jax as the group made their escape. In order to free Jax without releasing Stillwater, Rip chose to have a quick draw showdown at high noon with the gang's leader in the streets of Salvation. Rip easily dispatched of the outlaw, and Jax was released unharmed.

Kendra accepted, but after Ray's past self is rushed to the hospital, his contemporary counterpart recovered more quickly than expected, and she began to have doubts about their engagement. During the events of Salvation, Kendra had come into contact with
   one of her past lives
   , who had warned her that any relationship with a man other than Carter Hall only ended in tragedy. In addition, Kendra worried that she had only accepted Ray's proposal because of the life or death situation in which he had proposed. During a moment of reprieve from the Pilgrim's onslaught, Kendra sought advice from Sara and told her of her concerns, a conversation which Ray overheard.

   After the rest of the team safely secured their past selves with Rip's adoptive mother, Ray confronted Kendra about what he had overheard, and she revealed to Ray the truth about what had happened in Salvation; she added that although she wanted to be with him, she believed as a result of what she had learned from her past life that they could not last together, a sentiment that Ray did not share. The Pilgrim, meanwhile, grew desperate and began kidnapping the team's friends and family, including Anna Loring. Through their combined powers and with the assistance of a young Rip Hunter, they overwhelmed her, reducing her body to a pile of ash. While Anna recovered from the ordeal in their quarters, Ray and Kendra discussed their own relationship in the corridor outside. Kendra revealed that following their confrontation with the Pilgrim, she had decided to choose her own future and that she wanted to be married to Ray. Overjoyed with the news, Ray embraced her in a passionate kiss.

   Using scans from Ray's exosuit during his battle, the team discovered that Savage's Leviathan robot was technologically at least a hundred years ahead of anything in 2166. Rip Hunter saw this as an opportunity to bring Savage before the Time Council for manipulating time. During the voyage to the
   Vanishing Point

Savage compared himself to Ray since both them have loved Kendra but that Carter/Scythian had stood in the way their relationships with her.

Savage incapacitated Ray but Kendra managed to awaken Scythian's powers and knocked out Savage. Later, Ray and Kendra talked; Ray concluded that even though their relationship was over, it showed that he was able to love again after Anna's death.

However, Rip realized that these events were the ones that Druce showed him that would lead to Ray's death. Ray accepted his fate, but Mick knocked him out and elected to sacrifice himself to save Ray, although Leonard would later sacrifice himself in Mick's place.

Later, Ray revealed Sara's side mission to the rest of the team. Sara argued back that without his suit, Ray was only a self-righteous rich guy. Ray brushed it off and told the team that his suit can track the radiation from Darhk's Uranium traces. They tracked Darhk to the

Nate was a little nervous as he still couldn't hone in his powers and his uncertainty made Ray angry as he had to teach him how to destroy the ATOM suit despite the money, time, and effort to master shrinking he put into it. He claimed that it was the only thing that truly made him a hero which made Nate speechless.

Ray managed to save Jax from getting killed by the speedster but he managed to get away. They then learned that

   Ray and Amaya were woken up by Nate's noise in the library as he was trying to unravel the mystery of the medallion. Nate then officially dubbed their enemy trio as the
   Legion of Doom
   which Ray seemed to like. They then learned that the medallion was able to help locate the
   Spear of Destiny
   which had the power to reshape reality itself. When they found signs that the Legion was in 1967 Los Angeles, they went off and found Rip Hunter who was going by the name Phil and was working on a film set. Unfortunately, their battle with Darhk and Merlyn to get him back scared
   George Lucas
   and he decided to quit film school. This created an aberration which made Ray start to forget his scientific knowledge as it was through Lucas' film Star Wars that inspired him to become an inventor and instead made him a surgeon. They did manage to find and rescue Rip but learned that he didn't have the spear, George Lucas did. He along with Nate and Amaya tried to find Lucas to get the spear and convince him to go back to film school but were jumped by Darhk and Merlyn. Ray found that his suit was gone and Nate didn't have his powers anymore since Ray hadn't invented them anymore.

   When they learned that the spear had been thrown away, they all went to the dump where Ray, Nate, Amaya and Lucas had to dig through the trash to find it. The two former assassins began the trash compactor to motivate them to look faster. Ray and Nate told Lucas that he had to go back to film school or they wouldn't have their powers anymore. They found the spear but knew that if they gave it up they would be killed anyway. George Lucas then admitted that what he really wanted to do with his life was direct and it corrected the aberration giving Ray his suit back and Nate back his powers. Using them, they were able to escape and overpower Darhk and Merlyn as well as take the medallion back from them. It looked like they would stop them but their speedster enemy arrived and tipped the scales back in the Legion's favor. Rip then appeared, seemingly his old self again, but it was quickly revealed to be an act to try and distract the Legion. In the chaos, the Legends watched as Rip was captured. That night, Ray along with Nate and Amaya decided to have a movie night with George Lucas' films.

   Ray worked with the other Legends to learn more about their new speedster enemy. When Stein revealed that he had a daughter that was a time aberration, he jumped at the chance of working with her when she had an idea of linking the medallion data with Gideon. He met
   Lily Stein
   and together they succeeded in networking the two and celebrated with some champagne. However, Mick accidentally revealed that that Lily was an aberration and Ray suggested to her that she should talk to her father.

   Ray was in his room when he found droppings from a rat which he guessed had stowed away because of Mick's sloppy eating habits. When there was a massive time quake, he quickly found Nate and Amaya as Gideon told them that it was due to

   Gideon was able to use Lily's algorithm to locate a piece of the spear in the year 3000. However, when the team arrived, the spear had already been stolen by Rip and he had murdered
   Dr. Mid-Nite
   . Shortly afterwards, Gideon again located another spear fragment in 507 A.D. Britannia. Ray was excited to be in Brittania as he loved Arthurian lore though Nate told him that his expectations were way off base. Ray, Nate, Jax, Amaya and Sara went through the woods towards the spear's location while Nate kept correcting them on their views of medieval England, especially their misconceptions about knights in armor, just as knights in armor arrived to surround them. Ray immediately spoke to try and explain themselves and was ecstatic to see that they were Knights of King Arthur's
   Camelot
   . The leader then revealed herself as
   Guinevere
   and agreed to escort them to the castle. In the castle, they found King Arthur sitting with his other Knights of the Round Table. He explained that a dark knight was recently abducting knights from his kingdom and Ray quickly assured the king that they weren't their enemies.
   Arthur
   was still not sure so he called for Merlin to see if they were truly trustworthy. Ray and the others were shocked to find that Merlin was really
   Stargirl

   Ray was feasting with the others in the castle and he quickly found Sir
   Galahad
   and went over to introduce himself. Ray told Galahad that he was a big fan of the knight thought it meant that he made wind. He quickly explained himself better and Galahad told him that he was just a humble servant and was happy to serve an inspiration like Arthur which Ray quickly agreed the king was. When the king returned, it appeared that he captured the knight that was terrorizing the kingdom but it was revealed that it was a trick by both Damien Darhk and Rip. Rip was using mind control tech to have Arthur be their puppet and demanded that they get Stargirl's fragment of the spear. A fight broke out which had Arthur kill Galahad while Darhk demanded that they surrender the spear or they would unleash a brainwashed army to destroy Camelot. Ray mourned Galahad's death and took his sword. When Guinevere gathered the knights together to stand against the Legion, Ray was present for her inspirational speech and moved to join them for battle. Nate found him as he took Galahad's sword and infused it with ionic energy from his suit to make it stronger and even light up. Nate told him that the team had the spear fragment and were leaving though Ray wanted to stay and fight for the kingdom as it meant so much to him when he was a child. Nate warned Ray that he checked his manuscripts and saw one of Ray's funeral but Ray accepted it all being part of what it was to be a true legend.

  <p key="ff827afa-1dfa-4779-b8b1-97823ec58690">
   Guinevere took Galahad's sword and officially knight Ray as Sir Raymond of the Palms. The Legion met the knights on the battlefield at dawn and the two sides clashed in brutal combat. Ray fought beside Stargirl as Nate, Amaya, and Sara arrived to help. When Ray got to Nate, he asked if he came to fight for an imaginary kingdom after all but Nate told him he came to fight for his friend. When Stein and Rory managed to cut off the Legion's control of the army, he watched as all of the men were freed including Arthur. He then watched as Arthur unhorsed Rip and helped capture him. However, Darhk rode his horse from the battlefield and tried to escape. Ray went off and pursued him, ignoring Nate's cries to keep him back. Ray rode to find Darhk's abandoned horse and Darhk emerged from his spot and told him that he was a glorified nerd, not a knight. However, Ray wasn't intimidated and was ready to fight against him.

   The two crossed swords and Ray was able to use his ionic charged sword to destroy Darhk's sword and knock him down by clearly catching him off guard. Darhk quickly admitted defeat before he pulled out a hidden blaster and shot him. Nate caught up to him and found him on the ground, unconscious and seemingly dead, and became scared that the manuscript's prediction had come true. Ray then woke up and revealed that he was still okay as he had worn a piece of his Exosuit under his armor for further protection. Guinevere told Ray that he would always be welcomed at the Round Table and he and Sara left but not before he told Sara that every good legend ended with a kiss. Ray moved aside as she went to kiss the queen goodbye. When Ray made it back to the

Gideon explained that when she was rebooted, she took them to the oldest time that was in her logs which was his time. They all wanted to leave but couldn't as a vital part of the ship broke off in the crash. Ray volunteered as he knew the area and took along Nate and Amaya. They found out that the part landed in a place that Ray knew belonged to the T-Rex Gertrude that he stole eggs from. Gertrude picked up his scent and tried to go after him. He took the others to the hut where he had stayed when he was there and when they found his dolls, he explained that he had been lonely. He left to catch something to eat and loudly announced his return to the hut, breaking a moment between Nate and Amaya.

   Later that night, Ray quietly told Nate that he interrupted them on purpose and told Nate he couldn't be with Amaya as it would endanger the existence of her
   granddaughter
   . He told him that Amaya has a destiny, unlike them, and will eventually have to go back to 1942 and to her village. He also told Nate of the fate of her village and he wanted to tell her but Ray told him that he couldn't. The following day, they found the part and it was in Gertrude's nest. They managed to sneak in and grab it but Gertrude caught up with them. He and Nate were prepared to fight but Amaya invoked her totem and calmed Gertrude and the dinosaur left them in peace. Ray then reinstalled the part and he quickly apologized to Nate for trying to steer Nate away from Amaya but Nate told him that he was right and couldn't be with Amaya. He then stood with the team when Rip, with his old self fully restored, met with the team. Ray was happy to have the old Rip back again and he revealed that he knew where the last fragment of the spear was.

   The Legends managed to track down

Ray went with Rip and quickly found Henry Heywood at a press conference and Ray deduced that he must be nervous due to the crisis that Apollo-13 suffered when its oxygen tank exploded. He then spotted them and he then quickly punched Rip on sight. Ray then nervously greeted the man after Rip was taken away. He asked Henry why he punched Rip and he told him that it was between the two of them. When the others joined them, Henry revealed that his fragment of the spear was safely in Neil Armstrong's flag on the moon.

Sara had Ray shrink down and head for the shuttle to find out what was going on. He flew over and got inside to find that two of the astronauts were unconscious and Eobard Thawne was there. He moved to follow him but was quickly spotted by the speedster. They went into an all-out brawl and though Thawne couldn't use his speed, he managed to damage his suit's thruster system. Ray managed to blast Thawne and then tied him up.

Thawne quickly pointed out that if Ray didn't do it correctly then it would make the shuttle explode mid launch. He argued that fixing the shuttle would require two people to help repair it. Thawne offered an alliance and temporary truce which Ray grudgingly accepted. They moved to repair the shuttle and Thawne told him that it was nice to actually work with another scientist again and that they had more in common than he would think as they were both scientists that chased after the impossible.

Ray disagreed as Thawne killed Barry's mother twice, Rex Tyler and brainwashed Rip so that he would turn into a killer. Ray claimed that he used his science and suit to try and help people but Thawne told him that he really was the ATOM because he wasn't satisfied with his small life and there was no shame to try to be greater. Ray asked if that was why he wanted the spear for but Thawne said that what he wanted was to live. They finished repairing the shuttle and managed to successfully take off and make it to the

   Ray moved to put Thawne into their ship's brig before going to the bridge with the others. They saw that they needed to re-enter Earth's atmosphere without the help of Gideon and if they didn't angle themselves correctly then they would either burn up or get bounced off for the sun's orbit. Ray knew that Thawne would know the right angle and Thawne easily told him it was 38 degrees. The team was having doubts about trusting Thawne's answer and Ray believed that Thawne was telling them the truth. Sara agreed and decided to angle the ship to 38 degrees.

   To get the ship to be angled, Henry Heywood had to sacrifice himself to open the cargo bay doors which sucked him off into the atmosphere. When they landed, Thawne then phased out of his cell but Ray was waiting for him with a

Thawne's watch alerted him and Ray guessed that Thawne would have to leave without searching the ship for the fragment. Thawne smirked at him before he assured him that they would meet again before he sped off.

Rip revealed that the Legion had been operating from the Vanishing Point and they set course for the destroyed outpost of the Time Masters. Ray shrunk down and went through the base and found Thawne in his lair. He didn't seem to realize they were there and kept his eye on him until the rest of the team found the fragments and got them. When the fragments were placed together, they watched as they melded together and the spear became whole. Rip then warned them that the spear would try and tempt them into using it by playing on their desires, dreams, and regrets. Mick tried to destroy it in front of them with his Heat Gun but didn't affect it at all. However, it revealed a message that Nate was able to translate into revealing that the Blood of Christ created it and could also destroy it.

They had gone back in time to before Snart joined the Legends and told him of his fate and he agreed to join them to change his future. Darhk also appeared with a platoon of World War I German soldiers who attacked them. They were then forced to flee and head back to the ship. After Nate and Tolkien found the location of the blood, which was in the center of the battlefield, the team decided to get the two warring sides to call a temporary ceasefire.

Rory then used it on Nate and found that it worked when Nate regained his memories and punched Rory for his betrayal. Rory then used it on Ray and he also punched Rory immediately for his betrayal and for him getting stuck cleaning an obscene amount of dirty toilets.

However, when Nate took a selfie with Caesar, he inadvertently allowed Caesar to steal his history book on Rome, allowing Caesar to learn about the future and allowing him to conquer the entire world. The Time Bureau arrived before the Legends could act, however, and attempted to take over the operation only for Agent Sharpe to be captured and the operation to end in abject failure. After some persuasion, Rip allowed Ray and the Legends to finish the job, and Nate and Ray retrieved the book successfully: thereby setting history back on its proper course.

   P.T. Barnum

   Ray and Jax eventually accompanied a frustrated Nate to a nearby bar for drinks, during which Nate revealed his powers to P.T. Barnum in a bar fight. When asked by P.T. Barnum regarding his abilities, a drunken Nate revealed the abilities of everyone presented he said Ray could shrink. Ray protested and said he couldn't do it naturally without his suit, but Barnum kidnapped him and Jax. They were forced to dress as conjoined mixed racial twins. When the crowd began to lose interest in the performance, Barnum coerced Nate into "steeling up" by first threatening him, then Amaya. Barnum then shot Nate multiple times despite Nate's protests, angering Amaya to the point where she attacked Barnum, driving him out of the tent. This distraction allowed Ray along with Jax to be free. After that Ray made his way back to the

When they learned of an anachronism in 1937 in Hollywood, the heroes immediately went there and discovered Helen of Troy, who was their target, on set. Her ability, or rather the "curse of beauty", forced her to flee and join K&amp;B Pictures. The team went to the college prom where Helen was to be introduced, but there they discovered that Damien Darhk himself was their agent.

   The Legends removed an aberration interfering with a tour of

   The second was found in

   Zari
   went into town to find the fugitive, and their search eventually led them to
   Prudence Hawthorne
   , a teenage girl whose
   mother
   had been accused of witchcraft. Fetching
   John Constantine
   and Mick from the

    Waverider

   , the Legends followed Prudence into a remote forest, where they found Prudence and a growing cloud of sparkly fog. John demanded for the wicked spirit to show itself, but that "spirit" turned out to be Prudence's
   Fairy Godmother
   , who had escaped from Mallus' realm and been spit out into the timeline of Salem. The Godmother introduced herself and was about to sing a song until they cut her off and brought her and Prudence onto the ship.

   Closed in one of the rooms, Prudence worried about her mother, eventually using her Godmother's magic to unlock the door and escape. Ray and Mick moved to intercept them, but Prudence yelled at them to move, calling them swine. The Godmother turned both men into pigs, as well as removing John's mouth from his face before sweeping past them and exiting the ship. Just then, Nate arrived, having been sent by
   Ava Sharpe
   to find evidence of magic existing to help her receive the funds she needed to help the Legends with the fugitives. Nate listened as Ray explained (in pig language) the situation, replying that he could use Ray's help at the
   Time Bureau
   . Ray agreed to go but made sure that Nate would carry him there. Nate brought Ray forward and raised him in the air, but nothing happened. Nate tried again several times, pleading Ray to turn back into a human. Eventually, after a heartfelt conversation with Zari, Prudence released the Fairy Godmother, undoing all the spells she had cast but causing Ray to suddenly turn back into a naked human. Nate revealed his powers and caught Ray, whom he introduced to
   his father
   . Ray's transformation and Nate's powers would end up being enough to convince Hank to give Ava the $4.2 billion she needed for her new magic department.

   Later, after getting new clothes, Ray cheerfully met up with Nate, celebrating his "non-cloven digits" and opening up a
   time courier
   portal back to the Waverider. Ray gestured Nate through the portal, but Nate told him to go ahead, announcing that he would be staying in 2018 for a while to work at the Time Bureau and reconnect with his father (as well as finish recovering from his recent heartbreak, which he only told Sara
   ). Ray made Nate promise that the Legends would "see him for the next one" before hugging him goodbye. Ray shared a final glance with Nate, who gave him a reassuring smile, before sadly returning to the

   After leaving Nate, Ray continued his work with the remaining Legends, forming a bond with
   Charlie
   and getting a tattoo of a corgi on his bicep, but he admitted how much he missed Nate. Sara spoke to Nate and reassured the other Legends that he would be back soon.
   While in pursuit of a
   shtriga
   in 1990s Maine, Nate was too busy at the Bureau to team up with Ray, so John went with him instead. The two served as summer camp boys' counselors while searching for the shtriga and the children that it had captured. Eventually, they found the missing children, but the kids were all on the verge of death. As Ray chanted the necessary incantation, John used magic to return their life forces back to their bodies, unmasking the shtriga's true identity in the process and allowing Sara and Ava to kill him. However, one little boy was still in severe danger. Eventually, John made a heroic sacrifice, sucking his own life force out of himself and healing the boy. Just then, the other boys that the two men had counseled arrived, worried after they didn't show up for food. Ray praised them as they loaded John onto a stretcher and gave electrolytes to the rescued children. The two returned to the Waverider, where Ray and Sara had Gideon sedate him while discussing possible solutions to healing John.

  <p key="83da87f8-b0c2-4861-bfb5-e8b31e7f208a">
   Ray finally decided to search for
   Nora Darhk
   , who had escaped to a Renaissance Fair in 2018 to hide from her pursuers and avoid her use of magic. Ray tracked her down and saved her from a man who was trying to make a move on her, bringing her back to the Waverider and asking her to help him save John. She refused at first, afraid because her magic was connected to her dead
   father
   . Eventually, she agreed to a lifetime of magic after a speech from John. Ray connected her to a machine that used energy to help her send him life force, and in time, John was healed.
  </p>
  <p key="e7a0da6c-26e8-4c03-bcb1-d70ec81c4d71">
   A few minutes later, John stood up and left to smoke, much to Ray's annoyance. Nora thanked him for seeing the best in her, saying that it was time for her to go. Ray placed the time stone in Nora's hand, begging her to travel as far away as possible and hide, not telling him where she was. Nora reminded him of how upset the team would be if he released her again, but Ray confessed that he cared about her more, only wanting her to be free. At this, she took his hand and the two traveled by time stone to the Bureau headquarters in 2018. Ray told her to get out, but she said that she couldn't keep running because she realized that repentance was her path to freedom. She placed the time stone in Ray's hands, reassuring him that it was time to pay for her past. As the Bureau agents approached, she squeezed his hand once more, and Ray watched as she turned herself in. She gave him one last look before being escorted away at gunpoint.

   A month after their separation, Nate returned to the Waverider, where Ray eagerly went to greet him despite Sara's warning that Hank was also on the ship for an impromptu evaluation. The Legends noticed the time seismograph going off and settled on a mission to 1920s Paris. However, Sara had Ray, Zari, John, and Charlie stay behind on the ship to avoid looking unprofessional or causing a scene. Ray and Zari attempted to teach Charlie an American accent so she could act out as Amaya until Hank was gone, ultimately failing. Sensing his feelings for Nora, John reminded Ray that he could most likely sneak off the ship without being noticed. Ray flew the jumpship to the Bureau and begged Ava for permission to see Nora, but she refused. However, the new creature handler
   Mona
   had overheard their conversation and offered her help. Ray shrunk himself into an envelope, which Mona brought to Nora's cell, claiming it was a love letter from Ray. Unfortunately, Nora accidentally used magic to lock all three of them, as well as Ava, in the cell. Mona brought out a bottle of alcohol, and the three women began to bond as they drank the bottle. Mona and Ava eventually convinced Nora to open the letter from Ray, at which point he revealed himself and asked for help escaping from the letter's glue. Ray explained to the girls that he simply wanted to see Nora and make sure she was okay, which Nora found "stupid but sweet", but Ava scolded him for not listening to her. Ray then shrunk the door, allowing himself, Ava, and Mona back out into the headquarters. Later, as Mona was bringing in congee to help with their hangover, Nora asked her to deliver a response to Ray's "love letter", which the latter was happy to do because she now considered the two her generation's "Ross and Rachel".

   The Legends regrouped on the Waverider, where they threw a pizza party before saying goodbye to Nate. Ray sadly mentioned how different the ship was without him, but Nate reassured him that they could always visit him at the Bureau and he would always be there in Ray's "giant heart". Ray listened as Nate gave an emotional speech about his growth as a Legend and reminded them to "enjoy the ride while it lasts". As the Waverider flew off into the temporal zone, Nate went to speak to Charlie in private, and the remaining Legends shared a toast together.

   Ray offered the team a plan to travel back in time before the Encores were bad, but no one supported the idea. Ray ran into Nora, who was fed up with children asking for ponies, and he offered her his bed, so she could rest. The Legends traveled to the school reunion in 2004 to catch
   Freddy Meyers
   . Given the deaths that occurred, the Legends embraced Ray's idea to prevent Freddy from being evil. Ray along with Nate, traveled to 1989 to prevent Freddy from becoming a murderer. Ray and Nate pretended to be school mentors to talk to Freddy, but he turned them down, so Ray asked Nora for help to be Freddy's Fairy Godmother.

   Ray tried to talk to Nora while she was working as a Fairy Godmother, but was interrupted by Mick. Ray inspected Mick, but saw that he had nothing and assumed that Mick was in love with
   Ali

   Marie Antoinette

Ray and Mick confront Marie's body and managed to retain her by locking the body next to her head in the cell.

   Japan

   Soon after, Ray along with Behrad, Gary, and Nate prepared everything so that Ray could propose to Nora, but he could not because Nora was tired of taking care of
   Pippa
   and Ray had to take care of her while Nora rested. In the Waverider, Ray entertained Pippa by showing her recordings of the show he watched as a child,
   Mr. Parker's Cul De Sac

   Damien Darhk
   was resurrected and Nora had to pretend that Constantine was her partner, so Ray followed the deception and returned to the ship.

   Ray continued to watch Mr. Parker episodes with Pippa until Pippa encouraged him to propose to Nora and Ray thanked him. Determined, Ray returned to the house and together with Nora they revealed their romance to Damien, who did not take it very well and planned to kill all the Legends until Pippa arrived with the rest of the team and with a wish from Nora, Pippa sent everyone to

  <p key="c0ddc8d4-cd51-4aec-8f4e-1dd6bd7c0ae8">

   Ray managed to get Nora and her father to solve their problems and the three shared a hug and to finish, Ray introduced Nate as a sun, and they all made it out. Ray and Damien solved their problems, and Darhk gave Ray and Nora his blessing to get married. With everything ready, Ray was congratulated by his friends and Ray and Nora got married at Constantine's House and celebrated. During the celebration, Ray spoke with Damien, who told him that they should leave the Legends, so that Nora can do her job without problems, which Ray accepted and joined the others to dance.

  <p key="eb6222f4-eaa0-4173-81e1-6e53092dcaf1">
   After getting married, Ray and Nora had a night of passion, which Mick listened to. Upon awakening, Ray saw photos of his first missions in the Legends and told Nora that they will leave the team so that she can continue with her work as a fairy godmother. Ray and Nora lined up to go to the bathroom and tried to say they were leaving the team, but Mick went first and revealed that the couple is leaving the team, except for Nate and Ray had to lie to his best friend, so that do not be sad.
  </p>
  <p key="a8209402-998f-44cd-b835-64ee690d3090">
   To start the search for the Loom, the Legends had to travel to 1594 to ask William Shakespeare for the first piece of the Loom and Ray considered that as the last mission with the Legends and Nate planned that the mission would be incredible before Ray and Nora went to honeymoon. Upon arrival, Ray, Constantine, Nate, Mick, Behrad, and Charlie easily got the first piece of the Loom and Ray convinced everyone to stay to celebrate the victory to make the mission longer.

  <p key="85db6615-3c7a-4fba-b3d6-0978a08017fa">
   While celebrating, the Legends were drunk and accidentally started a fight where they showed off their powers and Ray accidentally showed off his exosuit, so they had to run off with the piece. When they returned to the

   Ray apologized to Sara, who was also drunk, but she also apologized and said goodbye to Ray before he left the team. To make amends for his mistake, Ray talked to Shakespeare and managed to convince him to write Romeo and Juliet and Nate heard that Ray was planning to leave the team, which made him angry. When he returned to the ship, Ray and Nate argued about leaving the team and cheating on him and both ended their friendship, but secretly the two felt bad.

   Ray and Nora packed their things and were ready to leave the team heading into 2020.

Ray eventually shrunk himself and caused Despero's belt to malfunction, though he could barely recognize the navigation system, teleporting the alien to a random location and saving Barry.

     As a child, Ray was lonely to the point of being delusional, as he didn't want to face the fact of that the world is imperfect; however, he eventually outgrew his lonely and delusional traits by the time he became an adult.
    </p>
    <p key="72693ba8-8f70-45d7-814d-b21d15ac2c45">
     As an adult, Ray is an ambitious, intelligent and charismatic businessman. He is highly motivated to achieve more success and is willing to work both honorably and extremely hard to get what he wants. Ray can often find himself awkwardly babbling, likening him to Felicity in that respect. Ray is also selfless, putting himself in between a gun and Felicity, and eventually breaking up with her civilly to allow her to pursue her love of Oliver Queen. Ray is also a trustworthy friend, keeping both Oliver and Barry's alter egos a secret. Ray can occasionally be stubborn, such as when he believed he could take on a dangerous meta-human, but is not above admitting to this. Even after being held captive by
     Damien Darhk
     for 6 months, the experience has not changed his positive and optimistic attitude. He is naïve when it comes to women, as Ray believed
     Valentina Vostok
     to be an innocent person, only to find out the hard way, that she was actually working for
     Vandal Savage
     .
    </p>
    When setting a goal he seems to be highly persistent in achieving it, as it took him a lot of effort to finally get Felicity to work for him. Ray seems to be a visionary as well, as he gives expensive things away and seemingly wants to improve the city and make it flourish again, prompting

    's body. Ray can become obsessed with completing these goals, however, as when building the A.T.O.M exosuit he ended up tired and rather reckless, but was determined to finish the suit.
   </div>

    <p key="d35b3cff-effe-46d0-869a-d40d3a809102">
     Behind his positive attitude is a sad side as Ray had lost his fiancée Anna who was killed in front of him. Ray mentioned that he was not strong enough to save her which seemed to be a motivation to as why he is so keen on helping the city and training to become stronger. Ray can sometimes be stubborn and jump to conclusions before he gets his facts straight, despite this Ray is not above apologizing or admitting when he is wrong. This caused him to not see what good the Arrow was doing and attack him using the A.T.O.M exosuit, daring the latter to kill him and prove that he was the villain Ray thought he was.
    </p>
    <p key="f397f006-44e4-4ca5-a717-c7ba9387028c">
     Ray is also known to be a workaholic, as he once went several days without sleep, food, or bathing while still obsessing over his A.T.O.M. suit. It took Felicity's prodigious and thorough programming skills to shut him out of his work and get him to take a break and wash his noticeably foul smelling armpits. His workaholic tendencies are most commonly witnessed the expression of his indomitable willpower, as he is never prone to giving up, whether it's taking on an enemy or in his engineering pursuits. Ray is simply an unstoppable force to be reckoned with.
    </p>
    <p key="48830907-02e9-48c7-a6e8-efa4f8548efa">
     Ray is a very loyal person that can't stand to see people in trouble. While personality wise, he is considered a "boy-scout", especially by the likes of
     Leonard Snart
     and
     Mick Rory
     , he is dangerous, confident, and sometimes ruthless in combat. He is willing to attack without restrain, using all of his power to defeat his opponents. He is also inventive with his abilities, such as combining his punches with his energy blasts to hit harder. He also utilized his shrinking ability and flight to fly straight through one of
     the Hunters
     , piercing through him like a bullet and seemingly killing the man. He had also shown willingness to kill when not interfering in the
     team
     coming close to dealing a killing blow on Chronos before he was revealed to be
     Mick Rory
     , and when the team collectively obliterated
     the Pilgrim
     .

    After learning of the message sent by

    from the year 2056 and that he altered the timeline, he criticized the present Barry for his actions. But he and the other heroes decide to forgive Barry with Ray saying that he and the other heroes still trusted him no matter what message, however, Ray was also being hypocritical; as he would have done exactly the same thing the latter did, if he was in an emotional state, and not thinking clearly. It was also seen that Ray is a little self-conscious of the fact that he fears he wouldn't be remembered or do anything too significant with his life. It was this fact that led him to join
    Rip Hunter
    in the first place. It was also seen when he showed his anger in helping Nate Heywood learn how to destroy his suit, believing that it was the only thing that even made him a hero.

     Ray is very open and warm-hearted, always working to keep the team's spirits up and seeming to want to make everyone welcome. Ray's sense of optimism, innocence and steadfast adherence to his principles would easily make him the most morally-upright member of the Waverider's crew. Though he was one of three remaining members of the original team, he seems to love meeting and connecting with new members. Soon after
     Amaya Jiwe
     and
     Nate Heywood
     joined the team, he formed very close bonds with both of them, and they went on a few missions together as a trio. Being close with both of them also allowed Ray to help Nate begin to navigate his romance with Amaya.
     Ray also played icebreakers with Zari when she joined,
     showed excitement when he saw that
     John Constantine
     was joining,
     and opened up to
     Charlie
     even before he knew that she would work with the Legends.
    </p>
    However, as much as he likes new members, he also strongly dislikes saying goodbye to old ones. Ray openly mourned the losses of
    Carter Hall
    (even though he barely knew Carter),
    Leonard Snart
    ,
    and
    Rip Hunter
    ,
    and he even cried during the funeral of
    Martin Stein
    .
    When Nate began working at the Time Bureau, Ray became lonely and a bit more serious until reuniting with
    Nora Darhk
    , and he sat in quiet sadness for most of Nate's farewell party.
    Nate's apparent death left Ray devastated, and he was one of the first to help channel love in order to magically save Nate's life.
    However, throughout his time on the team, Ray rarely let his sadness or nostalgia distract him when a mission was at hand, proving his strong morale and inner workaholic.

    Ray uses his advanced exosuit to replicate powers akin to those of

       Size alteration:

      Ray is able to change his own respective size, able to shrink or grow to whatever size he chooses. The effects still apply to him even after he's taken the suit off. This allows him to infiltrate wherever he wants with a low likelihood of being caught when he's shrunken. His larger heights also proportionately increase his strength and durability, allowing him to fight
      the Leviathan
      and win.
      By the time of the
      Earth-X invasion
      , Ray was able to enlarge only parts of his body with no loss of balance and control, which notably allowed him to enlarge his arm to fill an entire corridor and crush several armed men, knocking them unconscious.
      Additionally, Ray can also change the size of other objects around him using his ion cannon, an example being a
      Thanagarian
      "tech meteor".

    </b>
    This sword belonged to the legendary Knight of the Round Table, Sir
    Galahad
    , and Ray used it after the man was killed to help defend
    Camelot
    when it was under attack from
    Damien Darhk
    and
    Rip Hunter
    . Ray notably used his suit to focus ionic energy into the blade and enhance its strength, which he used to gain the upper hand in a sword fight with
    Damien Darhk
    . Afterwards, Ray presumably returned the sword to be buried with the fallen knight.

    When Thawne phased out of his cell but was met with Ray, who was waiting for him with a speedster weapon handy. Thawne couldn't help but laugh at the irony as he stated that he was the one who invented them in the first place. Ray kept his weapon on him but let Thawne go as the latter wouldn't have time to search the ship for the fragment of the
    Spear of Destiny
