   As a teenager, Evelyn grew up to become an excellent student and a top gymnast at

   , never so much as missing a single day of school. By her junior year, she was also elected to be class president and captain of the academic decathlon team.

   Around
   Christmas
   2015, Evelyn and her parents were among the Star City citizens who got involved in the following of
   Damien Darhk
   , and were heavily implied to have been drugged into submission with suggestion pills. The family then became test subjects for
   H.I.V.E.
   , who imprisoned them at Reddington Industrial. Shortly after,
   Team Arrow
   arrived at the facility to battle Darhk, but were unable to free the prisoners. As a result, John and Mary were gassed to death in H.I.V.E.'s testing chambers. During the chaos, Evelyn witnessed the

  </p>
  <p key="3fbfd0b3-affe-45cb-9c76-6d0fa8e00f71">
   Afterwards, Evelyn continued to stay under the radar, officially remaining missing. She blamed not only Darhk for her parents' murders, but also
   <a href="Oliver Queen.html" key="31cf1469-9450-4ad0-a9b6-d60cf5df549e" title="Oliver Queen">
    Green Arrow
   </a>
   for abandoning them, since he assumed all of the candidates were at Reddington Industrial voluntarily. However, Evelyn came to idolize Black Canary, believing she was the only one who even tried to help them. Over the next few months, Evelyn began training and preparing herself to get revenge on H.I.V.E. for what happened to her parents. Knowing she couldn't take on Darhk by herself, Evelyn plotted to kill his wife,
   Ruvé Adams
   (having presumably learned her identity while with the organization), and anyone else associated with them.
  </p>
  <p key="ac48ff13-1de1-474d-abe4-351031a9463a">
   During this period, Evelyn somehow became a "frequent flyer" at
   Starling General Hospital
   , having been treated in the E.R. several times. Likely due to her connections there, Evelyn discovered on April 6, 2016 that
   <a href="Laurel Lance (Earth-1).html" key="c20c3097-8c35-42a6-a34d-b7987909baea" title="Laurel Lance (Earth-1)">

   After Laurel died at Starling General of injuries afflicted by Darhk, Evelyn snuck into her hospital room and stole the Canary Cry. On her way out, Evelyn passed by a mourning
   Team Arrow
   , whom she briefly spared a glance before swiftly exiting Starling General.
  </p>
  <p key="4dc651e4-dc5c-454d-af06-017b60c1f650">
   After successfully altering the Canary Cry so she could use it, Evelyn donned a suit identical to that of the Black Canary in order to take up Laurel's mantle. Later, she attacked a gun ring and stole their weaponry for ammunition.
  </p>
  <p key="dedf920a-cc43-447c-8830-07df3db60c49">
   Afterwards, Evelyn attacked
   Alex Davis

    Thea Queen
   </a>
   due to his association with Ruvé. Using the Canary Cry to shatter the windows, she accused Alex of working for H.I.V.E. and attacked him. After knocking Alex unconscious, Evelyn prepared to execute him with a gun but was disarmed by Thea, who removed her mask. Evelyn used the Canary Cry to push Thea back and quickly fled. While running, she was pursued by Green Arrow through an alley. As he cornered her, Evelyn furiously confronted Green Arrow over leaving her, John, and Mary behind at Reddington Industrial to die and then subdued him long enough with the Canary Cry to escape.
  </p>
  <p key="feae9599-fb07-4f99-b8eb-5d81fdea7b55">
   The next night, Evelyn prepared to kill Ruvé at a gala in the
   Star City Plaza Hotel
   . She shot two bodyguards at the entrance to the ballroom but was then stopped by Green Arrow. He apologized for not saving her parents and tried to explain this wasn't the way to get justice done, but Evelyn simply declared, "it's the only way [she] [had] left". She continued and scattered the crowd with her Canary Cry before holding Ruvé at gunpoint. Green Arrow tried to talk to her again but Evelyn refused to listen and wounded the vigilante with a gunshot so he couldn't physically interfere. As Evelyn prepared to shoot Ruvé though, Green Arrow reminded her how the real Black Canary was a hero and asked what she would want Evelyn to do. After some hesitation, Evelyn dropped the gun, wishing to stay true to her heroine, and took off as the police moved in.

  <p key="860ea5eb-450c-4137-9334-3e6bf2345cb4">
   Later, Evelyn attended Laurel's funeral from afar. She watched with both wistfulness and approval as

   Following Darhk's death, Evelyn continued acting as a vigilante in Star City.
   Five months later, she was approached by Green Arrow, who offered her the opportunity to join
   his team
   if she could prove herself capable enough. Evelyn accepted and went to H.I.V.E.'s former base, where she met the other recruits,

   as "Overwatch", Green Arrow's tech-support. When Green Arrow arrived, he tasked the three to get past him and ring a bell. Green Arrow frequently beat the trio and they were ordered to return to the start line and try again. However, his brutal methods began to cause resentment from Evelyn, Curtis, and Rene. Later when
   AmerTek Industries
   was funding a medical clinical event held by Mayor Queen, Green Arrow ordered Evelyn, Rene, and Curtis to attend and be ready to respond as their
   CEO
   was being targeted. When the attacker,
   <a href="Rory Regan.html" key="7bb7ac04-eea1-4c31-a32a-fc28c2d0aec2" title="Rory Regan">
    Rory Regan/Ragman

  </p>
  <p key="e61e7431-ac7a-4a5e-8470-cf53c440dbae">
   Later though, Green Arrow called the recruits back and revealed his identity as Oliver Queen, apologizing for the harsh training and asking for a second chance. The three of them agreed and Evelyn was given the codename "Artemis".
  </p>
  <p key="2c29a016-da79-4dde-bbda-4bce794ec54a">
   After training for another week, Felicity began showing Evelyn, Curtis, Rene, and Rory (who Oliver convinced to join them) Green Arrow pursuing criminals through surveillance cameras to demonstrate how he gets results. They watched Green Arrow chase a street dealer distributing a new drug,
   Stardust
   , and learned that the supplier was
   Derek Sampson
   . The team still wasn't participating in missions, since Oliver wanted them to keep training until he felt they were ready to help in the field. Rene went out to find Sampson on his own and persuaded Evelyn to tag along, though she believed it was simply recon. Rene instead attacked Sampson, forcing Evelyn to fight back against his men. Rene caused Sampson to fall into a pool of chemicals used to create Stardust, presumably killing him. Sampson survived though, and became stronger, unable to feel pain. Green Arrow later brought Artemis, Wild Dog, Ragman, and Mr. Terrific to stop Sampson. The recruits handled Sampson's men and sabotaged his equipment needed to replicate more of the chemicals that made him invincible while Green Arrow confronted him.

  <p key="7a6f28b6-7607-4eb6-ada5-5d655fb5fab2">
   After succeeding in apprehending Sampson, Oliver brought Evelyn, Curtis, Rory, and Rene to the

   As the new team was finally allowed to become known to the public, Artemis officially replaced Speedy as the second archer. However, when taking down a delivery man associated with
   Tobias Church
   , whom Evelyn was initially ordered to shoot with her arrows, there was difficultly due to Rene's continued impulsiveness, which almost resulted in the target escaping. The team had trouble getting along but knew they had to pull it together.

   out of a military prison, Evelyn and her teammates returned to the Arrowcave, where they got news of Church's latest criminal actions. Felicity was reluctant to send them out against Church, but Rory's return to Team Arrow ultimately convinced her to allow the mission. The team engaged in battle, saving some
   ACU
   members, but was forced to retreat when Church threw a knife into Curtis' back. Evelyn and Rory took Curtis to the getaway car driven by Quentin while Rene stayed behind to engage Church and buy them time. Shortly after, Oliver returned from rescuing Diggle, who personally met the new recruits, and assured the team they would find Rene.

   ) to draw out Church. The team discovered that Church wanted to head up a drug-smuggling ring in five cities. Evelyn and the team were able to beat Church and his gang and have them arrested.

    The List

   . This forced Oliver to reveal to his new team his past actions as The Hood/Arrow. Evelyn felt betrayed and angered, as she knew several names from The List and believed Oliver to be a hypocrite for not allowing her to commit similar acts of vengeance against her parents' murderers. As Evelyn, Curtis, Rene, and Rory discussed being kept out of the loop and not trusted like Diggle and Felicity, she expressed her doubts on continuing to believe in Oliver's crusade. Despite this, Evelyn did not leave Team Arrow, declaring that she was doing it for herself and so was not beholden to Oliver.

   Artemis guarded one of Prometheus's potential targets, a train driver. Felicity tried to talk to her about her feelings regarding Oliver's secret but Artemis switched her comm off, annoyed. Suddenly, Prometheus appeared. Determined to protect her assignment, Artemis fought with Prometheus, managing to cut his arm, but was swiftly defeated. Green Arrow then arrived and fired an explosive arrow at Prometheus, who redirected it to the ceiling and escaped. Upon discovering a bomb Prometheus left behind, Green Arrow, Artemis, and the driver escaped the train using a parachute arrow before it exploded.

   Back at the Arrowcave, Oliver patched up Evelyn and the two seemingly made amends. Evelyn was later seen at the "Star City Nights" festival at the
   Rockets Arena
   accessing the backstage of a concert with Thea, Curtis, Rene, and Rory, thanks to Oliver's connections.

   Despite appearing to make amends, Evelyn still resented Oliver. Some time later, she was approached by Prometheus, who offered her the chance to watch Oliver die in exchange for aiding him against Team Arrow. Evelyn accepted and began acting as a double agent for Prometheus, providing him with information on the team's members and their loved ones.

   After
   Team Arrow
   clashed against

   Prometheus
   . Once he arrived, Evelyn assured Prometheus that no one followed her, as Team Arrow did not suspect a thing about her current alliance to the enemy.

  <p key="6528e6ef-8ffe-4c67-aed7-cc842888e70e">
   A few weeks later, Evelyn met with Prometheus in an abandoned building to give him photos and addresses of Felicity and Rory, the last of her intel on Team Arrow. When he didn't acknowledge this, Evelyn reminded Prometheus of their deal: in exchange for her help, she would get to watch him take down Oliver. However, Prometheus reminded her that he is not going to kill Oliver, but make him wish he was dead.

   On Christmas Eve, Evelyn arrived at the Arrowcave for a Christmas dinner with Diggle, Curtis, Rene, and Rory, along with Diggle's wife,
   Lyla Michaels
   , and son,
   JJ
   . She also gifted the team Christmas stockings with their names printed on them.

  <p key="c6ef3222-0a9c-4c06-bceb-e75ffe8e842d">
   Later, Evelyn and the team learned that Prometheus attacked Curtis outside
   City Hall
   and is possibly
   Justin Claybourne
   's illegitimate son. The team tracked down Prometheus and as Rene attempted to shoot the archer, Evelyn disarmed him, revealing her alliance with Prometheus. Furious, Oliver asked why she would betray them. Evelyn responded that Oliver is a fraud and that "this city needs to be saved from [him]." Prometheus then used a smoke bomb to escape with Evelyn.

   When Adrian kidnapped and tortured Oliver from March 15–22, he set about breaking his victim psychologically. One of Adrian's methods was "revealing" that he had been keeping Evelyn in the same prison as Oliver. Evelyn tearfully apologized to Oliver for siding with Prometheus, claiming she couldn't handle being his captive anymore. Adrian placed a knife in the cell and left, stating that whoever kills the other can go free. Oliver tried to convince Evelyn to help him escape but she attacked him out of fear, though he disarmed her. When Adrian returned, he pretended to snap Evelyn's neck, attempting to show Oliver once again that everyone around him is in danger. After Oliver finally proclaimed to have enjoyed murdering his victims during his past crusades, Evelyn stood back up and revealed her ruse. Gloating how she knew that he would soon break, Evelyn reassured her hatred for Oliver and left him in the prison with Adrian.

  <p key="48bcc700-6612-4fd3-af83-fcf263305db1">
   When Evelyn woke up, she realized that Talia and Digger had left her behind and was forced into one of the cages by Slade, who coldly advised Evelyn to "choose [her] friends more wisely." When Oliver questioned her as to the whereabouts of the rest of his friends, Evelyn bitterly stated she wished she knew so she could tell him and everyone else "to go screw [themselves]." When asked why Adrian split up the hostages and what his endgame was, Evelyn just smugly pointed out that Adrian was always ahead of them and raised the possibility that leaving her behind was part of his plan. Despite everything Evelyn had done, Oliver promised to come back for her once this is all over. Evelyn instead declared that once this is all over, he would be dead. When Adrian killed himself to detonate the C4 explosives covering the island, Evelyn was still locked up in the cage.

    Despite listening to Green Arrow, Evelyn admitted to still despising and blaming the vigilante for her parents' deaths.

     High-level intellect/Skilled tactician:

    Evelyn was noted to be a star pupil at her
    high school
    , being excellent in her studies and never missing a day of school. Combined with her intellect and hardworking nature, she even rose to become a regarded academic decathlete. Evelyn's status profile/missing persons report also implies she's a very well-read individual. Evelyn formulated a plan to take down
    H.I.V.E.
    's members by using the knowledge she gained as their prisoner, all while avoiding both the organization and
    Team Arrow
    's surveillance.

Later while helping Prometheus torture Oliver, Evelyn was able to fool the latter into believing that Prometheus abused her and she regretted siding with him, going as far as to play dead for a while.
