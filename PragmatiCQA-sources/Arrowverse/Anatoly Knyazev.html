   From an early age, Anatoly became affiliated with the
   Solntsevskaya Bratva
   . In 1986, as a 13-year-old boy, Anatoly worked as a lookout for the organization under "
   Yuri the Bear
   ". As the time-traveling
   Sara Lance
   entered the locker room of the banya and engaged in a fight with members of the Bratva, Anatoly almost immediately ran from the room.

   At some point in his life, Anatoly became a navy sailor and later an operative of the
   KGB

   Soviet Union
   's secret service, gaining the codename "KGBeast".
   According to Knyazev himself, the KGB "taught him many things", particularly information on the workings of landmines.

Later, right when Ivo was about to gouge out Anatoly's eye, Oliver set off an explosion on the beach that distracted Ivo, so he never did actually remove Anatoly's eye, instead he took measures sending his men to the beach to capture Oliver,

   , and
   Sara
   . Oliver allowed himself to be captured so as to feed Ivo misinformation on the whereabouts of Slade and Sara, effectively allowing them to come aboard unnoticed and allowing Sara to free the other prisoners. The plan succeeded and Anatoly and the others were freed.
   Upon returning to land, Anatoly was the first to notice Oliver's disappearance and they discovered that Slade Wilson had taken Oliver prisoner. They later agreed to trade Oliver for an engineer they had and attempted to kill Slade with landmines but failed.
  </p>
  <p key="46594548-df0f-48a5-af26-252f43d51673">
   Oliver and Sara then fixed a nearby submarine to destroy the Amazo in the event they failed to cure Slade of the Mirakuru.
   Anatoly waited for a time limit given to him by Oliver and reluctantly destroyed the ship, dragging Sara, Slade, and Oliver to their presumed deaths.

  <p key="a5bf8433-6aa6-4277-9dac-477065020c3d">
   Anatoly and the other former prisoners of the Amazo later managed to leave the island, presumably with the Japanese submarine, and return to their homes.

   Anatoly and Oliver are later reunited in Russia, where the latter intended to hunt and kill government strongman and part-time crime boss
   Konstantin Kovar
   , a brutal ruler of
   Krasnoyarsk
   . Anatoly, who oversaw the Krasnoyarsk division of Bratva at that time, recognized Oliver, saved him from death and, in return for what he did for him on Lian Yu, offered to help him become a full-time member of the Solntsevskaya Bratva, a membership he needed for his mission.
  </p>
  <p key="8c834a3d-31d8-4b7e-8218-faa4665b733e">
   After a dangerous initiation process, Anatoly brought Oliver before the other Bratva bosses in Krasnoyarsk, who, after listening to the American, agreed to give him formal Bratva membership, nicknaming him "Kapiushon".
  </p>
  <p key="011cbd94-bf78-4978-8028-c318767de0aa">
   Some times after this, Anatoly introduces Oliver to Bratva Pakhan
   Ishmael Gregor
   , who sent him on an undercover mission to destroy one of Kovar's casinos.
   However, after he discovered that Pakhan Gregor had made a deal with Kovar, Anatoly questioned his decision as it betrayed the organization, so he was beaten badly by Pakhan's men. After Oliver visited him and found out about what happened, he proposed to Anatoly a plot to kill the Pakhan.
   However, before the two could decide their moves, Gregor and his men attacked them in the hospital where Anatoly had recovered.
  </p>
  <p key="9972a733-abff-4fbf-8de0-1b34690522f9">
   Knowing prior that he and Oliver could be killed, Anatoly invoked the "spros dopros", a Bratva trial in which the Pakhan is asked to answer for his deeds. Before the process, Oliver broke into Kovar's home finding evidence of Gregor's corruption, therefore the majority of the Bratva captains decided to vote for Anatoly as the new Pakhan; then Gregor's men opened fire on them starting a mutiny.
  </p>
  <p key="9ae6003b-d8a1-4c69-b027-d39e2e9f9284">
   After the shootout most of the captains are killed and Gregor escaped with some of his men intending to promote new captains loyal to him; however, Anatoly and Oliver, dressed in his green suit, attacked Gregor during the meeting with his loyal Bratva members managing to kill him.
  </p>
  <p key="2589f0fc-15bd-4c9f-9a85-a86e2d3449f6">
   As the new Pakhan, Anatoly met with Konstantin Kovar to question him about the deal he made with Gregor, learning that the governor planned to overthrow the Russian government using a nerve gas during an evening into his casino. Anatoly, Oliver and their fellow Bratva companions tried to prevent Kovar from acquiring the weapon but failed and are then forced to infiltrate the casino battling
   Kovar's criminal organization
   ; however they are betrayed by
   Viktor
   and taken under custody by Kovar, who then tried to kill them and all the people into the building with the gas.

  <p key="055269be-45fa-4f44-9afc-f0224e30df44">
   After Oliver managed to stop Kovar's plan subduing him, Anatoly tried to convince his friend to bring him to justice, but Oliver choose to stab him instead. Later, Anatoly made Oliver a Bratva captain.
  </p>
  <p key="f08004eb-7a09-4cff-b81c-d71658df3d5e">
   Oliver then asked Anatoly if he could get transportation back to Lian Yu, as it was the one alibi that could explain why he had been gone so long. Anatoly asked him to reconsider, wanting him to become a full-time Bratva member. After Queen refused the request, Knyazev asked Oliver to visit a hospital with him. They saw many sick children and Anatoly revealed that he wanted to steal medicine from a warehouse to help the kids and have their faith in the Bratva. This heist would also act as a goodbye celebration for the both of them. After stealing and distributing the medication, Anatoly once again tried to persuade Oliver to stay. Again, he kindly rejected the offer. Anatoly relented, wondering what he would become without Oliver at his side.
  </p>
  <p key="c778efa4-52de-414f-bad3-571c27c679a3">
   Later, Anatoly and Oliver returned to Lian Yu together to enact Oliver's plan to be found there. Upon the shore, Oliver found Slade Wilson's mask and impaled it with an arrow, believing that it was a sign. He then bring Anatoly to the graves of all the people he buried on the island, explaining why he has to complete his mission, once he will return home.
Before leaving, Anatoly tells him that he bribe some fishermen to come to the island in 48 hours to rescue him and made it look like it was just a coincidence that they found him. He also gave him a fake beard and wig from one of his KGB friends to further complete his story as a castaway.

  <p key="480456d4-6113-4365-b10b-2befe5bdc1a3">
   After he and Oliver parted ways, Anatoly told the other Bratva members, including
   Alexi Leonov
   , many good things about him
   however, for an unknown reason, Anatoly never liked Alexi.

   Moscow
   and, in 2013, he met again with Oliver to help him find information regarding the whereabouts of
   Lyla Michaels

   Koshmar
   , but evidently had trouble breaking back out. He later helped them break Lyla Michaels,

   Sometime after that, Anatoly heard that Oliver asked for a favor from
   Alexi Leonov
   , but when Alexi asked for a favor in return, Oliver pointed a gun on his head. He also heard that because of this favor, Alexi got killed. Anatoly got angry on Oliver for breaking the Bratva's sacred rules and realized that he shouldn't welcome Oliver as a Bratva member anymore. He also decided that Oliver is not welcome in Russia.

   In 2017, Oliver decided to come to Russia to stop general
   J.G. Walker
   from selling a nuclear device to a group of separatists form
   Markovia
   . Due to Anatoly being his only friend in Russia, Oliver tried to contact him, but Anatoly didn't respond, probably because of what happened with
   Alexi Leonov
   . Oliver came to Russia anyway, and as Anatoly met him at the airport, he punched Oliver in the face saying that he should never have come back. Anatoly reminded Oliver that he once disobeyed the orders of Alexi, and told him that in doing so, he broke the sacred rules and was no longer welcome. Oliver and Diggle met with him later that day to request the Bratva's help to catch Walker and reminded Anatoly that the only reason that he was Pakhan was because Oliver had killed Gregor. Anatoly consented to help, but on the condition that Oliver help him with mob business. After Queen refused, Anatoly told them that there was no way he would help. Queen later returned, asking what was required of him. Anatoly sent Oliver and

   Team Arrow

After drinking with Drake, he called her his new "favorite American". He approached Oliver about another favor and his loyalty to the Bratva, reminding him that his oath was for life.

He insisted on a two-part payment to complete the deal, two sets of pharmaceutical drugs from factories throughout the city, and Oliver agreed.
While stealing diabetes drugs, Knyazev and his men were interrupted by Diggle, Dinah,

While meeting with Oliver, Anatoly explained that he was combining two drugs to create an opioid that was more addictive than heroin, thus finally cementing his role as Pakhan. Diggle arrived and caught the end of that conversation, causing him to be more committed than ever in getting the Bratva out. After his men were stopped from killing Chase by Oliver's team, Anatoly yelled at Oliver for letting his friends get in the way again, and Oliver announced that their deal was off and his men needed to stand down. Anatoly was satisfied, as he needn't kill anybody and he could still take the rest of the drugs. He warned Oliver that if Oliver interfered, their prior relationship wouldn't keep him from being declared a Bratva enemy.

   Anatoly and the Bratva headed to the next location, this time taking hostages during the heist. As he was confronted by Green Arrow and his team, he ordered his men to kill the hostages, forcing Oliver to choose between the people and pills. Oliver sent his team in to free the civilians while he fought Anatoly's men. In the end, Anatoly gave him an ultimatum: if he wanted to kill his old life, he'd have to kill Anatoly. Oliver instead activated an alarm so they all had to run before the police arrived, giving his old friend a chance to escape.

   Anatoly decided to head back to Russia but leaving behind his men, who were furious at Oliver's betrayal. Oliver refused to apologize for keeping Anatoly from menacing innocent people for money, telling him that he was no better than Gregor. Anatoly admitted that he had to become what he'd became. Without Oliver's presence, Anatoly slipped into corruption and self-interest.

So he and a group of his men came back to Star City and kidnapped a group of Markovian delegates, demanding ransom. After Oliver and his team freed three of his hostages, Anatoly escapes with
   one
   , injecting him with a deadly toxin and demanding a ransom for the second time in order to spare the man's life. After Team Arrow detects the toxin and Oliver injects the hostage with the antidote, Anatoly kills the man due to not having received his money, then he was confronted by his former friend over his change of attitude. Anatoly still insists that he is an honorable and good man, claiming that the fact that he did not kidnap, torture or try to kill William, Oliver's son, and revealing that he did not reveal Oliver's identity, as proof and escapes.

However, as it turned out, Diaz had fooled Anatoly and had used him to lure Team Arrow to a trap, which Anatoly only realized after learning that the place where he sent them was mined, after which Diaz called Anatoly. Anatoly immediately scornfully lashed out at his former ally and Diaz in return cruelly promised he will kill Anatoly painfully instead of the swift death he planned for the FBI and Team Arrow, but having known of what Diaz truly is, Anatoly remains unfazed.

   Five months afterwards, Anatoly went back to

   and started working as an A.R.G.U.S informant, helping them discover the Longbow Hunters' actions.
   However one month later, he was tracked down by Diaz who, wanting to exact his revenge on Anatoly for his betrayal, used his newfound strength to easily dispatch his guards on top of a roof holding Anatoly near a ledge. As
   Silencer
   walked up she asked if he got what he wanted. Diaz happily answered her question, saying he was going to keep his promise and sarcastically asked the frightened Anatoly if he was right.

   Anatoly was taken back to Star City, where Diaz duck taped him to a chair and tortured him. Diaz reminded him of the last time they spoke and how Anatoly betrayed their "friendship". Anatoly claimed that Diaz has no friends. Diaz decided to point out that all of his friends are gone and that he picked the losing side. Diaz picked up a blowtorch and told Anatoly that he's going to help him destroy Oliver Queen, before burning him. Once Diaz was through torturing Anatoly, he forced him to contact an old associate of his in the KGB,
   Pyotr Roslov
   , to purchase two of a weapon called BETAB-500 so he could destroy Star City. Having gotten what he wanted from Anatoly, Diaz and the
   Longbow Hunters
   took him to a munition's plant in Orchid Bay and put him in a crate with Honor's belt, finding the tracker that

   After being safely taken to the A.R.G.U.S. headquarters, Anatoly was forced by Felicity into helping their investigation on Diaz's purchased weapon under the threat of revealing his position to the FBI, so he met with Roslov using the excuse of talking about old times in KGB to stole him the files regarding the BETAB-500; however he was discovered and nearly killed due to Felicity refusing to proceed with the extraction plan until the files were entirely copied on her computer.

Anatoly managed to find the general at a Bratva fight club so he, Oliver and Laurel went there to discuss about the experimental weapon he was working at, a pulse wave generator. After Oliver accepted to take part in a fight for the general in exchange of the weapon's plans, Anatoly watched the battle with Laurel confessing he still doesn't trust her. Later, Bratva members kidnapped Oliver and Mia, leading Anatoly and Laurel to rescue them with William's help.

Before Oliver's departure, Anatoly said goodbye to him stating that they had been friends, enemies and from that moment on they would simply be brothers. He also apologized to Laurel for having doubted her change, prior to saying farewell to her too.

   Despite Anatoly's status as a mafia leader, he has a deep sense of honor, as he awarded Oliver the rank of captain in the
   Solntsevskaya Bratva
   and therefore; granting him access to its resources, for saving his life, even though it was extremely rare for an American to hold such a rank in the organization, even Oliver stated that his relationship with the Bratva and Anatoly is an extremely valuable one, he holds Oliver in high regard, to the point he doesn't hesitate to help Oliver in anyway he can and also takes an immediate liking to anyone Oliver vouches for, Anatoly is also proven to be a very considerate individual, as he was the first individual who asked where Oliver was after escaping the

   when he refused to deter from his mission to save

   from the Gulag, despite hearing how dangerous of a mission it is. His loyalty to his friends is without question and oddly enough for a mafia leader, Anatoly is exceptionally friendly and seemed to be a man of good morals as seen by his reaction to Oliver's growing violent tendencies and when he tried to convince Oliver to let the Bratva bring
   Konstantin Kovar
   to justice instead of killing him.

  <p key="a0244942-0fd7-4e2b-b120-5dde5babeeb2">
   However, over time, Anatoly began to change in Oliver's absence, becoming corrupt, ruthless and self-serving under the justification that he became what he needed to be, these traits caused his friendship with Oliver to end and turned them against each other, however, Anatoly does still hold onto his friendship with Oliver as he was visibly affected to the point of near tears when Oliver lectured him on how he has fallen and he did warn Oliver that his best men were staying behind in

  <p key="0de4a7bf-8826-4693-892c-598f00fdf280">
   After Anatoly was exiled from Russia and stripped of his Pakhan status, he blamed Oliver, as his friendship made him appear weak which has made him forgo his personal sense of honor in favor of ambition and power, although Anatoly retains his jovial and sarcastic demeanor, he displays a far more ruthless streak; such as when he kidnapped a group of Markovian delegates, demanding ransom money and injecting one of him with a deadly toxin in order to force Oliver to give into his demands, then killed his hostage without hesitation; when his ex-friend didn't give into his demands. Oliver was horrified by this act, claiming the good man Anatoly was has devolved into a monster even worse than
   Ishmael Gregor
   (the latter who focused more on personal fulfillment than the good of the Bratva that Anatoly ironically despised) Anatoly corrected Oliver; stating that Gregor was just as bad as he was describing him to be, but Oliver never saw it as he was too naïve.
  </p>
  <p key="5cccc381-337d-44ec-9d40-30a6285271eb">
   Despite Anatoly's ruthless actions, he still retains a sense of honor, as he claims to be an honorable man; proof of this was the fact that he did not resort to revealing Oliver's identity as Green Arrow to the public or having his son,

   kidnapped and tortured, as well as offered Oliver a chance to surrender instead of shooting him outright, proven that even though they stand apart and he blamed his ex-friend for him losing everything, he still had a level of care for Oliver. Anatoly also was clearly disapproving when Oliver revealed that all his allies have left him and he is doing it alone due to his convintion that alone means he can succeed, showing that he does not approve of just simply neglecting allies.
  </p>
  <p key="80e9ef66-8314-424a-9105-c4d3dbb29e14">
   Even with all that happened, Anatoly's own sense of honor and decency proves to outweigh his desire for money, power or reputation, as he was drawn to

   's
   operations
   because of the rewards it would reap, however, after witnessing Diaz's true nature, that of a self-serving and cowardly sociopath with no sense of honor and decency, as when he unhesitatingly cheated to defeat Oliver, Anatoly's eyes were finally opened and he saw Diaz for what he truly was. This caused him to realize that despite his claims of being an honorable man, working alongside Diaz meant abandoning all form of decency and honor, just like Oliver said he was becoming by following Diaz, still deeply valuing honor, Anatoly was horrified and disgusted by Diaz's true nature, and was ashamed and regretful for what he almost became, because of his ambitions. He remorsefully and sincerely apologized to Oliver for not realizing what Diaz truly was and for working with such a man.
  </p>
  <p key="28d2b0ce-ac1e-4a65-8d8d-7cc7c0f31eea">
   Therefore; Anatoly's new-found clarity of Diaz's true nature caused him to immediately switch sides, completely reconciling with Oliver out of sympathy and guilt for what his ex-friend, who betrayed him but clearly proved to be a honorable and decent man; unlike Diaz who lacks any form of honor and decency, to the point that he was willing to break Oliver out and openly betray Diaz despite the risk it would put him in had he not been interrupted by Diaz's men, after Diaz began open war with Oliver, Anatoly does not hesitate to risk his life to give Oliver information and even willing to turn himself in to warn Oliver of the
   Longbow Hunters
   . Upon realizing that his cover was blown, Anatoly immediately lashed out at Diaz and did not attempt to reinforce his cover, exchanging spiteful words with his former ally.
  </p>
  <p key="f187b422-f144-4375-a3fc-536af7aee862">
   Due to Anatoly being completely aware of Diaz's true nature, he has no fear of him, remaining unfazed by Diaz's threats of a slow and painful death, as he was only concerned by the fate of the ones trapped by Diaz, however, after coming face-to-face with a now-enhanced Diaz months later, Anatoly displayed true fear of Diaz, not because he was going to fulfill the promise he made months ago (regarding a slow and painful death) but because of the latter's new-found enhanced strength. However, despite this, Anatoly quickly got over his fear of Diaz's enhanced strength, as he began to taunt the latter, stating that "men like you don't have any friends". Anatoly is also proven to be reasonable, as he bore no ill-will at Felicity for risking his life and instead gave her advice on how to be ruthless.
  </p>
  <p key="1081882b-bbfc-423e-b053-847b026ac3c3">
   By 2019, Anatoly has largely turned his life around; he now has a peaceful life as a bar owner. He now considers Oliver as his brother, regardless of whether or not if they are blood related. He even offers to be the "cool uncle" figure to William and
