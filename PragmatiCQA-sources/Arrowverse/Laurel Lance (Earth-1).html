   Laurel was born on November 15, 1985 to

   . As children, Laurel and Sara would play and dress up together. In one instance, they pretended to be grown-up versions of themselves with Laurel as a police officer and Sara as a doctor.
   The two would also race to climb to the top of a particular tree, in which Laurel was implied to have always let Sara win, because she knew her little sister was a sore loser.

   , and the three of them grew up together as lifelong best friends.
   She also became close with Oliver's younger sister,

   . Growing up, Laurel was always studious and responsible, in stark contrast with Sara's rebellious nature.
   From an early age, she was very close with her father, sharing Quentin's drive of administering justice and making the world a better place.

  <p key="108b2144-1d31-4392-adf8-8bfe27927cb2">
   In Laurel's senior year of high school, she became the student body president with help from Oliver and Tommy, who handed out gift baskets to the voters.

   Laurel planned to attend
   Starling City University
   after high school, but was struggling to figure out what she wanted to study in college. Meanwhile, Quentin asked her to keep an eye on Sara due to the latter's suspicious behavior. The next day, Laurel tried to walk home with her sister but Sara rejected her offer of help. Later, Sara came home with a black eye, which revealed she was being bullied. Quentin scolded Laurel for not being there for her sister, citing that they should always look out for those who couldn't protect themselves, and began giving her and Sara self-defense lessons. Later as Laurel and Sara were walking home from school, Sara's bullies cornered them, but the sisters worked together to fend them off and they never bothered Sara again. Afterwards, Laurel took her father's words to heart and decided to study pre-law at Starling University, aspiring to become a lawyer to help people.

   In 2005, Laurel was attending one of Tommy's private college parties when Sara snuck into the event so she could spend time with Oliver. Their father and the cops later arrived to shut down the party, resulting in Sara getting grounded. She would come to believe it was Laurel who tipped off their father to sabotage the former's chances with Oliver, due to apparently having known about Sara's crush on him. However, it remains unclear as to whether or not Laurel actually did this. One month after Tommy's party, Laurel and Oliver began dating and fell in love,
   despite his reputation as a "frat boy".
   Their relationship was approved by Oliver's family, with

  <p key="eb3edea3-3900-46bd-9af0-675d0d9b0206">
   Two years later in 2007, while applying to law schools, Laurel broached the topic of her and Oliver getting a place of their own. She cited that they had been dating even longer than their friends,
   Ray
   and
   Jean
   , who were already moving in together. Oliver seemingly agreed, only to become suffocated and try to run away from the responsibility by cheating on her.
   Laurel remained unaware of this as she began apartment hunting for herself and Oliver while planning their future together, hoping to one day become "Mrs. Laurel Queen". While Sara was visiting from college, Laurel excitedly detailed her aspirations. However, Sara expressed wariness and tried to talk to Laurel about the possibility that Oliver might not be ready to settle down, given his reputation. Angered by her sister's apparent lack of support, Laurel refused to listen and the two got into a heated argument.

Possibly with Sara's previous warning in mind, Laurel wondered if she scared Oliver with her proposal of moving in together, but he (falsely) assured Laurel that she didn't and everything was fine before bidding her farewell.
   A few days later, Laurel and her father saw on the news that the

   At some point in law school, Laurel made it to the final mock trials in Moot Court and asked her father to come watch, which Quentin initially agreed to. At Moot Court, Laurel was the defense attorney for a suspect who was wrongfully arrested for and accused of a murder that was carried out with his stolen gun. She waited for her father but he didn't show, leaving her disappointed. Laurel proceeded as the defense and eventually won the case. Afterwards, Quentin apologized for not coming, explaining how he finally apprehended a serial killer known as "The Night-Stalker", but Laurel was still upset.

   By February 2010 during her final year of law school, Laurel accepted a job offer at
   Weathersby Posner

   Merlyn Mansion
   , where the two caught up before encountering Thea, whose new party-girl lifestyle concerned them. The event was broken up by the cops when a drug dealer was found dead. After Quentin arrived at the scene, he lashed out at Thea and Tommy, also berating Laurel for continuing to associate with Oliver's crowd, much to her anger.

   City Necessary Resources Initiative

   At Tommy's funeral, Laurel gave his eulogy in Oliver's absence, emphasizing that Tommy was so much more than a billionaire playboy and how much she came to love him. Oliver visited her after the funeral, believing that he failed Tommy. Laurel insisted he shouldn't blame himself for Tommy's death but Oliver stated she would blame him too if aware of "the truth". A week later, Oliver and Laurel, seeking comfort in one another, sorted through some old photos of their and Tommy's childhood. Laurel reflected how the three of them were always a great team and suggested she and Oliver could work together to try and save the city, hopeful about the future. The next day, Laurel found a letter from Oliver in her apartment along with the picture of herself she had given him over five years prior. In the letter, Oliver assured Laurel that she is a hero who will help the city recover and he would only hold her back from doing so, which is why he's going away for a while. Oliver told Laurel to never doubt his love for her and that she has always been the best of himself. Laurel was heartbroken and began crying.

Seeing her with the gun, the Arrow tried to talk her out of her revenge, warning her this wouldn't bring Sara back, but Laurel refused to listen, angrily declaring she was doing this for her sister. Komodo denied having killed Sara, but was unable to convince Laurel as she pulled the trigger, only to discover the Arrow had removed the bullets.﻿

Following Oliver's advice, Laurel went to the precinct to talk to her father, but she was unable to tell him the truth when Quentin's medication reminder alarm went off. She sidestepped by apologizing for lying to him the day before. That night, Laurel and Team Arrow put Sara to rest in her old grave from when she was presumed dead after the

   Wildcat Gym
   to question Bronson's fighting teacher
   Ted Grant
   . When he was told that witnesses had placed Bronson at the scene the previous night, Grant claimed Bronson was with him at the time, causing Laurel to angrily accuse Grant of perjury. Despite admitting to nothing, Grant answered that some people in Starling City were dealt bad hands and that he was willing to lie to keep a good kid who made a mistake. Seeing Laurel's rage, Grant invited her to train in his gym in order to work off her rage.

   In her next AA meeting, Laurel confessed she was feeling rage over something she couldn't say and admitted to not knowing what to do with it. She then listened to a woman named
   Erica Vendel
   share being beaten by her alcoholic boyfriend. After the meeting, Laurel revealed to her father that Erica had been telling similar stories every month and the abuse is getting worse, stating that her boyfriend,
   Michael Ancona
   , had eight assault charges against him. However, Quentin knew that the police acting on Erica's confession would defeat the purpose of the anonymity of AA. Deciding to take justice into her own hands, Laurel followed Michael and assaulted him with a baseball bat while wearing a ski mask and her sister's jacket. Laurel managed to get in a few hits at first, but was soon overwhelmed and severely beaten. She was subsequently taken to the hospital and visited by her worried father, who pleaded Laurel to never do something like that again. Laurel promised, admitting she made a mistake.

Nyssa pointed out that she had found Sara alone and starving on Lian Yu, and had loved and protected her since. Upon seeing Sara's jacket on Laurel, Nyssa stated that Laurel was not fit to wear it before leaving the cemetery.

   The next morning, Laurel was contacted by Oliver and told before her death, Sara had asked her father for information about something named "Jansen." Heading to the precinct, Laurel questioned Captain Lance about what Sara had asked about. Her father explained that Sara had been in Starling, but asked him not to tell Laurel, and that he had given her the last known address of
   Ken Zhi Jansen
   . Seeing Nyssa walk into the precinct, Laurel went to confront her. Nyssa figured out Laurel had not told her father about Sara's death, and although believing he had the right to avenger his daughter, she did not reveal it to Quentin because Laurel asked her not to. Quentin gave Laurel Jansen's address, and she went to wait in the Arrow's headquarters as the Arrow, Arsenal, Nyssa, and Diggle went to investigate the address.

Upon learning that Oliver had tagged Malcolm with a tracer arrow when he had a clean shot at him, Laurel demanded to know what he would do when he found him. She wanted Oliver to kill Malcolm, but Oliver adamantly refused, causing Laurel to storm out. Outside, Nyssa caught up to Laurel and promised that they would find Malcolm, and she would kill him.

   When Nyssa kidnapped Thea to set a trap for Merlyn the next night, Oliver asked Laurel's help in tracking them down. Laurel did not find anything specific to Nyssa or Thea, but she discovered the smoke signal Nyssa was using to send Malcolm a message on city cameras. Laurel went back to the Arrowcave and gave the location to Oliver so he could rescue his sister. After Thea was saved, Oliver returned with Nyssa and told Laurel Malcolm had not killed Sara. When Laurel asked Oliver if he was sure, he told her he would not let Malcolm leave otherwise. Nyssa visited Laurel while she was training at the gym, and admitted she had now proven to be worthy to wear Sara's jacket.

   Starling National Bank
   after Brother Eye threatened to reset the balances of every accounts to zero in Starling City's banks. Trying to make sure no one got hurt during the protest, Laurel pushed the boundaries of her authority and sent an emergency service unit to the bank, but the riot squad only served to exacerbate the situation. Before the protest turned violent, the Arrow and Arsenal interfered and dispersed the crowd by using tear gas on them. Quentin was furious when he learned Laurel had gone behind his back and escalated the situation. After calming down, Quentin asked Laurel to talk about whatever was hurting her, but she refused to say anything about Sara's death. Quentin accepted her refusal, but urged Laurel to at least talk to someone else, expressing how much secrets hurt. Laurel took her father's advice the next morning and confided in Ted about her sister's murder. Ted stated he now knew how to teach her and promised to help Laurel deal with her anger. Ted asked which color uniform she would like, to which Laurel responded, "Black. Definitely black."

   Laurel kept training with Ted, who also started to use grappling against her during the boxing sparring. After the training they decided to have dinner together. When they returned a body was strung up in the gym and The Arrow confronted Ted. Laurel came in between and said Ted could not have done it as he was with her after closing the gym. She talked with her father who questioned her relationship with her trainer. She left the gym and walked straight past
   Carrie Cutter
   , who was observing the crime scene. Talking with Oliver she said Ted was innocent and had lots of (former) criminals in his gym who might want to send a message. Oliver questioned that she trained with him after he refused to learn her to fight, and told her she had to watch out with Ted. Laurel learned about the body in Ted his hideout and that he was a former Vigilante. She identified the victim as a former magician assistant. Ted told them that both are related to a hotel where a drug dealer got killed before he stopped being a vigilante. Oliver asked Laurel if Ted was aware why she was training and that she wanted to follow in Sara her footsteps. Laurel claimed she can handle it, to which Oliver stated she plays a dangerous game.

   Laurel later learned that Oliver had Ted arrested after they found the real killer. Roy confessed to Laurel he probably killed Sara while he was still suffering from the Mirakuru. Laurel asked why and he said he remembered doing it. However, Laurel was confused as Felicity pointed out the DNA did not match with Roy's. Oliver said she needed to focus on Ted right now. Laurel talked with Ted while he was in custody. Ted told her about his former partner,
   Isaac Stanzler

Laurel attempted to fight back, but was defeated by Count Vertigo. She began to suffer from the overdose, but Oliver arrived in time to bring Laurel to the Arrowcave for treatment.

Felicity encouraged Laurel to use that as her driving force behind Black Canary instead of trying to be like her sister.

Back at Palmer Technologies, Laurel, Diggle, and Felicity scanned the data and determined that Malcolm may have actually been telling the truth, though Felicity is still reluctant to trust Malcolm. Laurel and Diggle were about to take off with Malcolm when Felicity arrived, having changed her mind, deciding to come with them to stop Ra's al Ghul. When the trio arrived, they were confronted by numerous assassins and a large scale fight ensued. When the virus was about to be launched in a jet, Ray arrived and destroyed it, at the cost of damaging his

Proclaiming that they're both alcoholics, Laurel told Quentin he can continue blaming her and Oliver for what happened with Sara, but falling off the wagon is on him. Now though, he has a choice to make: keep being an angry drunk or make both of his daughters proud by becoming sober and helping Team Arrow save the city. Laurel and Team Arrow scouted different positions around the city for the virus, quickly learning that Ra's was using his own men to carry it. With Nyssa's help, Laurel managed to take down and defeat numerous assassins while Oliver killed Ra al Ghul and Ray dispersed the cure, saving the city and preventing The Outbreak.

Laurel and Thea later decided to travel to Nanda Parbat under the guise of a spa weekend in hopes for finding a solution for Thea's bloodlust and so Laurel could have a chance to bring Sara back from the dead.

Oliver confronted Laurel over her secret visit to Nanda Parbat and messing with forces she doesn't understand. When Thea was hospitalized after being attacked by Sara, Laurel went to check on her. There, Laurel and Oliver had an argument and Oliver scolded Laurel about how her actions endangered his sister and many innocent people. Laurel apologized for putting Thea in danger but stated that Oliver has never seen her as an equal since she became Black Canary due to the secrets he kept from her, such as the truth about Sara's murder and Thea's experience with the Lazarus Pit.

Laurel revealed that she kept the photo of herself she gave Oliver before he got stranded on Lian Yu because it reminded her of a simpler time between them. Realizing anything could happen, Laurel assured Oliver that she is glad he found Felicity and hopes he can find his way back to her, also admitting that while she knows she is not the love of Oliver's life, he would always be the love of hers.
   Laurel then asked Oliver to promise not to let her be the last Canary and give the identity to someone else, so there will still be a part of her fighting beside him and the team. Oliver promised.
   Suddenly, Laurel started seizing from an embolism. The doctors tried to resuscitate her but despite their best efforts, Laurel passed away at 11:59 pm on April 6, 2016, much to the devastation of Oliver, Thea, Diggle, Felicity, and her father.

   , Laurel appeared as a manifestation of her desires, or possibly a spirit given the Spear's mystic nature. Sara had been reluctant to use the Spear as she knew that its power could undo Laurel's death, but it was not the right thing to do. Laurel explained that the Spear didn't need someone "pure of heart" to wield it, but someone who was willing to do the right thing. Laurel promised Sara that she wouldn't ever be too far away from her and the sisters embraced. Sara tearfully told Laurel she loved her one last time, which Laurel reciprocated. Sara then used the spear to return to reality.

The two carried Quentin out of the building to safety, using their canary cry's to fend off Diaz' men along the way and Dinah handed Laurel a gun.

   After getting Quentin to the paramedics, Laurel headed back into the building and went to the rooftop where Oliver had nearly subdued Diaz. Diaz dared Oliver to kill him, as it was the only way to truly defeat him and knew Oliver wouldn't. Knowing Oliver wouldn't kill him, Laurel told him that Diaz was right that he'd have to kill him to beat him before blasting Diaz off the roof with her canary cry into a river below in an attempt to kill him herself, frustrating Oliver as he knew Diaz would survive the fall and angrily lashed out at Laurel, who in turn told him that she was trying to end it and she could only hope that the fall killed Diaz.

   Oliver and Laurel then headed to the hospital to see Quentin, and while Oliver went in to speak with him, Laurel waited outside the room and called Quentin's other daughter and her deceased doppelgänger's sister Sara Lance, who arrived and seemed fairly amazed to see her deceased sister's face again on her doppelgänger. Laurel thanked her for coming, believing it was only right for Quentin's daughter to be there. Sara thanked her for calling her, and Laurel asked if it was weird for her to see her, which Sara responded that it was a little. Sara then asked if she was anything like her Laurel, which Laurel replied she hardly was at all, visibly disappointed at herself. Sara and her later walked over to Team Arrow and witnessed
   Samanda Watson
   arresting Oliver, to their confusion as he explained his deal to enlist her help from liberating the city from Diaz also involved him turning himself in in exchange for immunity for the rest of Team Arrow.

   Dr. Schwartz approached them, and when Oliver asked how Quentin was, she told them he had seized during surgery and died as his brain was deprived of oxygen for seven minutes, leaving Laurel, Oliver, Sara, Dinah, and the rest of Team Arrow devastated as the FBI took Oliver away, who told all of them to take care of each other. As a grieving Sara hugged Felicity, Laurel turned away visibly teary-eyed and heartbroken by both Quentin's death and Oliver being taken away. Later as Oliver (under the direction of the FBI) revealed his identity as Green Arrow to the rest of the world and called on his friends and allies to keep fighting to save the city, Sara and Laurel cried and mourned together as they stood over Quentin's body.

   Five months after Quentin's death, Laurel was appointed district attorney of Star City. When Diaz returned to Star City, Dinah placed Laurel into SCPD witness protection; much to Laurel's annoyance. Despite being told that the Longbow Hunters were in town along with Diaz, Laurel refused to placed under police custody. Laurel eventually snuck out of her office, but was found by Dinah. While Dinah wanted to call the SCPD in to help, Laurel said she was intending to take down the Longbow Hunters and then kill Diaz herself to get revenge for Quentin. When they entered the building, they separated and Laurel was attacked by one of the Longbow Hunters. Upon being found by Dinah, they both used their sonic screams to defeat The Silencer, but were not successful in capturing her. The following day, Laurel visited Dinah at the SCPD and thanked her for the help in defeating The Silencer. Before leaving, she tearfully apologized to her for killing Vincent and stated that she was no longer a murderer, and that she hoped that Dinah would one day see how much she had changed.

   About a week later, Laurel was approached by Felicity who asked for her to help interrogate The Silencer, whom she had captured with the help of Rene. Laurel interrogated her by torturing her with her sonic scream; however, due to Honor's resilience, Felicity started to lose her temper and told Laurel to use extreme force, even if it meant killing her. Laurel then said to her that once that line is crossed, it's nearly impossible to come back from that, and suggested that she find another way to interrogate The Silencer.

   When Felicity was declined access to visiting Oliver at Slabside, she turned to Laurel, who then turned to Dinah for help. Felicity had been told that Oliver was taken to "Level Two" at Slabside, with Laurel stating that there is no documentation of its existence. The three of them eventually found that "Level Two" was a psychiatric program that was intended to re-socialize the Slabside inmates. Laurel, Felicity, and Dinah were able to reveal the illegal practices of Slabside to the press, to which Laurel said that she could attempt to appeal Oliver's conviction.

   Despite her success in working with Felicity and Dinah, Oliver was not trusting of Laurel, as shown when she visited him at Slabside. Frustrated, Felicity comforted her by stating that Oliver had not had a chance to see that Laurel was a changed person. Her frustration grew after her attempt at appealing Oliver's conviction was denied. She intended to torture the judge, but before she could, she was talked down by Dinah, who reminded her to not through away her attempts at doing the right thing. Ultimately, Laurel was able to make a deal with the FBI to have Oliver released if he was willing to help with their case against Diaz.

   A week after Oliver's release, Laurel attended the gala held by Star City in honor of his return and to support prison reform. Despite having helped get Oliver out of prison, she was greeted coldly by everyone, except for Felicity, who reminded the others how they should all thank her for what she did to set Oliver free. Oliver then (genuinely) thanked her and apologized for not having given her the benefit of the doubt.

   After the death of Ricardo Diaz, Laurel was placed in charge of investigating his killer. Ben Turner called her and asked her to come visit him at Slabside so he could give her some intel. He revealed to Laurel that he knew who killed Diaz, but in exchange for disclosing that information, he wanted to see his son and also asked Laurel to get him out of prison faster. Although hesitant, Laurel accepted those terms and arranged for Turner's son to visit him. Turner then told Laurel that the person behind Diaz's death was the

   Laurel then called Emiko and arranged for a meeting. At the meeting, Laurel revealed to her that she knew her true identity and that she knew she killed Diaz. However, Emiko responded by saying that nobody would believe her because of her past as Black Siren. When she disclosed this information to Oliver, he (once again) did not believe her and demanded that she leave them alone. The following day, Laurel got a call from Dinah, who scolded Laurel for forcing the confessions of her suspects during interrogations. Although Laurel agreed to do things "the right way", she lost her temper and threatened to kill Gustavo Hernandez after he mocked Quentin's death during an interrogation.

   Right after Hernandez was released, he was mysteriously found dead. Dinah confronted Laurel and accused her of killing him, to which Laurel questioned why she was being accused. Although Laurel denied killing Hernandez, Dinah did not believe her, stating that she looked at him in the way that she looked at Vincent right before killing him. Frustrated, Laurel responded that despite how hard she had worked at redeeming herself, Dinah would never ever believe her and only see her as the Black Siren. Later that night, Laurel was visited by Emiko, who had released a photo of Laurel working alongside Diaz and told the public that Laurel was responsible for killing Hernandez.

   Frustrated that her criminal past caught up with her and hurt that her "friends" had not believed her, Laurel donned her Black Siren persona and contacted
   an old friend
   . Together, they began a crime spree around Star City. Although Felicity believed that Laurel could still be saved, Dinah was adamant on bringing her in; even after she found proof that it was not Laurel, but Emiko who had killed Hernandez. After an unsuccessful attempt at pulling through to Laurel herself, Felicity contacted Sara, believing that she could help pull through to Laurel. Despite the efforts of Felicity, Sara, and Dinah to pull through to Laurel, she seemed to rebuff their efforts on multiple occasions. However, after Sara realized that she had Laurel had no intentions to kill people and just felt hurt and abandoned, she attempted to give her some encouragement when visiting Quentin's grave, to which Laurel resisted.

   As she was preparing to steal a lethal weapon, Laurel was approached by Felicity, who told her that she still believed in her. When Laurel stated that being a criminal is her true self, Felicity challenged Laurel by saying that if she was happy with the weapon killing people, she should just kill Felicity right then and there; which was echoed by Sara and Dinah. Unable to kill her friends, Laurel decided to stop her crime spree and turned against Shadow Thief, who revealed to them that she had been anticipating that to happen. The four women were then attacked by Shadow Thief's other partners, but after a brief fight, Felicity detonated the weapon; destroying the building and all four of the women managed to escape.
