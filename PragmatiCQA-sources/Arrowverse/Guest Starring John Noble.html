   Zari

   At the college the Legends take the miniaturised Grodd back to the ship and wipe Obama's memory. As Rip and Sara leave, Damien Darhk appears. Sara tells him that he can't have Obama. Damien tells them he isn't there for him, he's there for his daughter – and he needs their help. On the Waverider they are trying to contain him inside a magical circle given to them by
   John Constantine
   , although it doesn't appear to be working. Damien offers them a gesture of good faith and gives them the
   water totem

   Ava
   points out that freeing Mallus was the reason Darhk was creating anachronisms in the first place, and Damien explains that he was doing that before he knew that freeing Mallus would mean the death of his daughter. Like it or not, Damien's interests and that of the Legends are aligned – stopping Mallus will allow him to save Nora. Sara tells him that they won't help him and orders Mick to kill him. Rip and Ava suggest instead imprisoning him at the

   Anansi totem
   to her daughter, and introduces
   Esi
   . However instead a young girl carrying a baby enters. Amaya asks the girl, a young
   Kuasa

Unseen by the villagers the younger Amaya also leaves. Nate and Wally go after her. They notice that Amaya seems happy and ask her why. Amaya explains that Esi didn't bond with the totem. That means that if she can persuade Esi to bear the totem then when the warlords come she will be able to protect the village and her family won't die. Wally tries to warn her that they can't change history, citing his experience of

   On the Waverider, Ava comes to see if Sara is alright. Sara explains that the hardest thing she ever had to do was let Damien Darhk live (after their encounter with the Spear of Destiny), and that it is taking every bit of strength she has to stop herself killing him now. Ava tells her that she needs to let Darhk live for the good of the mission, and admits that Rip sent her to check on Sara. Sara is amazed that Ava would do anything Rip asked, seeing that he was the one that implanted false memories in her and hired actors to pretend to be her parents. Sara tells Ava that she needs to confront Rip, but Ava decides not to, choosing to put the mission over her own feelings. Rip comes in and asks if they are ready to transport Damien Darhk to the Time Bureau. Sara tells him they're not, and that she needs to go and talk to someone who can make sense of all that is going on. She travels back to Occidental College to talk to Obama. Having explained to him all that has been going on, Obama tells Sara that the Time Bureau are probably not the best people to deal with a demon, and suggests that a more unorthodox approach is in order. Sara thanks him, and wipes his memory again. Back on the Waverider Sara confronts Damien and tells him that whilst she doesn't believe for one second that he has changed, she will work with him in order to defeat Mallus under one condition – that once it is all over that she will put him back in the ground where he belongs. Damien agrees.

Amaya tells her that she has her mother's strength, and the strength of all of the totem bearers who came before her, but also that there is danger coming and her village will need her. She offers Esi her hand, and Esi takes it. In another part of the village, Nate and Wally are outside the older Amaya's home. Nate suggests that Wally speed in there to go and get the totem so that they can give it to Esi but Wally refuses, as he is worried that if they change the timeline and save the village, that Mallus will be released. Nate says that he has to help Amaya. Wally warns him that if he goes too far, that he will stop him. Nate enters Amaya's hut. The older Amaya is asleep. Nate tries to take the spirit totem but Amaya awakes and throws him to the floor. Nate tries to tell Amaya it's him, but she doesn't remember him. Nate is able to show he pictures of the two of them together. Amaya asks why he is there. Nate tells her that he is there to fulfil a promise he made to her to make sure that Esi gets the spirit totem. Amaya says that her daughter didn't show up for the ceremony, and that she has doubts. Nate comments that she was the same at that age, and tells Amaya that if she tells Esi she believes in her, that Esi will bear the totem and be unstoppable.

   At Darhk HQ Damien has returned to his daughter. Nora wants to know why Mallus is not free and tells Damien that he has failed them. Damien tells her that the Legends have captured Grodd, and suggests they ask Mallus what they should do next. Unseen by Nora, a miniaturised Ray has flown into Nora's ear and plays the recording they have made of John Noble, which tell Nora to go to the Waverider with her father. Nora believes the recording and tells Damien to take her there. They use the

He tries to reach Nora, telling her that he was a terrible father and that he turned her into a monster long before Mallus possessed her. He tells Nora to fight Mallus, but Mallus tells him that Nora gave herself willingly to him and that she is gone. He says that one more alteration to the timeline is all it will take for him to be freed. On the bridge Ava and Rip have been watching the encounter. Ava says that she can't believe the plan worked, but Rip says that Sara knows what she's doing and that he always picks the right people for the job. Ava asks why he picked her. Rip tells her that it was because she has strength, a brilliant mind, a calm demeanour, and she knows how to follow the rules. Ava reveals to him that she knows she's a clone and asks why he picked her. Rip tells her she's special and critical to the mission, but Ava realises that she wasn't the first clone Rip had. Rip admits that there were 11 clones before her. Rip tries to explain, but Ava leaves. In the corridor outside where Nora is being held, Damien tells Sara that Nora is gone, and it is only Mallus now. He asks if she is enjoying seeing him with a broken heart. Sara asks where that heart was the night he killed her

   League of Assassins

   In Zambesi Esi has embraced her destiny, and has taken on the Anansi totem. Amaya is confident that when the warlords attack the village tomorrow that she will protect them, and Nate says that if she doesn't that they will be there to fight alongside her. He tells Amaya that her older self doesn't remember him or the Legends. Amaya realises that she must have wiped her memory, so that when she returned to 1942 she was able to protect her village properly, without being torn remembering her love for Nate. On the Waverider Wally tells the team how Amaya and Nate plan to save the village. Sara asks Zari whether her simulation program has found any loophole, but Zari tells her no. For time to remain intact the village had to be destroyed, and if it isn't Mallus will be released. Sara suggests that perhaps they should allow Mallus to be freed. As they have the six totems they stand a chance of being able to beat him. Rip reminds her that the last time the bearers of the totems were defeated, but Sara says that was only because they were betrayed by the death totem – which won't happen this time. Rip asks how she can be so sure. Damien suggest that it won't happen because this time it would be him carrying the totem. Like Sara he has been raised from the dead, which also makes him eligible to carry the totem, and killing Mallus is the only way to save his daughter. Rip suggests that Sara would never give Damien such a powerful weapon – but Sara passes the totem to him and says it's all his. Ava says that the Time Bureau will not condone such an action, and tells Rip that they will return to the Bureau. Rip tells Ava that he is going to stay with the Legends, and Ava tells him that he is no longer a member of the Time Bureau, and leaves. Sara goes after her to try and convince her to stay. Sara tells Ava she loves her, but Ava tells her that there is "no me to love" and portals back to the Time Bureau.

He tells them that even though the warlords have been defeated, the village still gets destroyed – by an angry gorilla. Rip notices that the container containing the shrunken Grodd is empty. Damien admits to releasing him – he needs history to run its course. Grodd attacks the village. Esi goes to face him.

When the other Legends try to stop him, he knocks them out as well. Out in the village Esi is fighting Grodd. Grodd is able to use his psychic ability to paralyse Esi but the older Amaya attacks him to protect her daughter. Grodd strikes her, sending her flying. Nate is able to use the power of the earth totem to defeat Grodd. He sees Amaya and runs to her thinking she has been killed, but she has survived. The older Amaya remembers him, and is surprised that he is a totem bearer. Back in Amaya's hut Damien frees Mallus/Nora and tells her to escape.
