   Talia (apparently) had a closer and more affectionate relationship with her father, Ra's al Ghul, than her half-sister,
   Nyssa
   did, however, her ambition and complacency were greater, as, after years of being denied the right to succeed her father as the
   Demon's Head
   , it caused a strain on their relationship, as a result, Talia left the

   to find her own path in life. This also showed a very self-serving nature, as she left despite knowing that with her absence, it would leave Nyssa to endure the full focus of their father's harsh parenting style.

   to get revenge, knowing full well that the former is a psychopath, showing that she as well is extremely vengeful like her new ally, in addition to this difference in philosophy, she seems to have a policy of cutting off all associations once she has finished training her students, so much so that her current students will attack any former students that try to have an audience with her. The only known exception to this policy that Talia has been shown to make is her alliance with Adrian, as they had the shared goal of getting revenge on Oliver, who killed Talia's father. This makes Talia indirectly responsible for
   Justin Claybourne
   's death, because Talia trained and encouraged Oliver to attack those on the list.

   However, Talia is proven to be forgiving in certain moments, most notably when she and Oliver make up over their vendetta for one another, with Oliver helping her escape from

   Talia's revenge against Oliver made her forget that she was to blame for her father's death for encouraging Oliver to be a vigilante, as well as ignoring the fact that her father was a murderer who was not going to stop for nothing she knows very well that Oliver had no choice he also ignores the fact that her father was not innocent while Thea, Quentin, John and Felicity, William, Samantha had nothing to do with his revenge.
