   he began to see the law can only do so much but the Hood can go outside the law to compensate for the law's limits. He eventually began to work with him to catch criminals, even knocking out his fellow policemen that tried to attack the Hood, now known as the Arrow. He recently had a falling out with the Arrow, after having held a grudge for his not telling Quentin that Sara was dead. He has decided he's done with the Arrow and issued a city-wide manhunt for him. This also estranged his relationship with Laurel since she hid the secret from him as well. After

After Oliver defeated Darhk, Quentin was dismissed from the SCPD for assisting Darhk, despite the fact that he was under duress, and became an alcoholic to cope with Laurel's death.

   Quentin Lance was born on June 15, 1960 in
   Starling City
   . In his younger days, Quentin met and fell in love with
   Dinah
   and the pair moved in together into their first home at Spring Street while in their early 20s. According to Quentin, he repeatedly proposed to Dinah, only for her to turn him down until the right moment. Quentin claimed he spent a year with that engagement ring "burning a hole in [his] pocket", waiting for Dinah to finally accept his proposal.

   Quentin's father
   gifting him a wristwatch on their wedding day.
   On November 15, 1985, they had a daughter,

   Quentin shared a particularly close bond with his eldest daughter, Laurel, in part due to their similar ideals.
   Every year on Laurel's birthday, Quentin would personally pick up chocolate-frosted yellow cake, his daughter's favorite, from the bakery.

   Having to deal with being a police officer and a father to his partying daughters, Quentin was not able to administrate much responsibility into his life. Upon learning that Sara was being severely bullied by some of her classmates in high school, Quentin taught his daughters self-defense
   and also had them take classes to refine their skills.
   Quentin's relationship with Sara was especially difficult as his daughter began rebelling and acting out as a teenager. He worked hard to help Sara go straight, including preventing her from being arrested for shoplifting.
  </p>
  <p key="f37745f8-9f05-4c59-9671-acce8f3ed557">
   In 2007, Quentin worked on the case of
   Camille Declan
   's murder.

  <p key="6126d973-67ed-4a8f-af0c-f44b592346ca">
   Sometime in 2007, Quentin brought Sara to the precinct to help her research a school paper on the criminal justice system. She wanted to see what it looks like on the inside, but she was not expecting her father to walk her through the booking process—including handcuffing her to a desk, with every intention of the inside of a jail cell being next. However, before he could, the SCPD is attacked by a
   professional assassin
   who is targeting Sara. The Pilgrim kills every cop but Quentin and before she can manage to make the kill on Sara,

   and a woman with a staff come to her rescue. They successfully defeat the assassin, taking Sara along the process and leaving Quentin behind. However, the assassin (known as The Pilgrim) soon abducts Quentin along with other individuals are threatened as a way of luring the
   same people who saved Sara earlier
   . With the Pilgrim having been defeated, Quentin soon encounters the woman with the staff, who reveals she is a future version of Sara. Quentin gladly hugs her, stating that he is proud of the woman she has become. With that in mind, he takes a pill that erases his memory of the events that occurred.

   Later in 2007, Sara came home from college for a surprise visit. Without Quentin's knowledge, Sara had began an affair with Laurel's boyfriend

  </p>
  <p key="a7c0d154-80c5-40f0-86f1-177441acbc75">
   Quentin blamed Oliver for Sara's death and harbored a great contempt for him and his family despite his own supposed death. Following Sara's death, Quentin fell into a deep state of depression, becoming an alcoholic, and buried himself in his work in an attempt to ignore his pain, taking every case that passed his desk without pause.
   Sara was also the first and last thought of Quentin's mind every day and it took him years to get past that point. His drinking and work obsession eventually lead to Dinah divorcing him.

  <p key="f514ef74-cab0-4459-b741-22b843561ddc">
   By February 2010, Quentin's drinking problem had only gotten worse and after spending one afternoon at a bar and ignoring work, Laurel was notified by Quentin's desk sergeant. She paid for her father's drinks and took him home. That night, Quentin was called in to

   Lucas Hilton

Oliver explained "a man in a green hood" saved their lives, which the detectives initially refused to believe. As they left, Quentin stated how Oliver's luck "never seems to run out", bitter over him surviving the sinking of the

   Adam Hunt

   Hunt Multinational
   .

  <p key="efa348c9-be53-43e7-b845-27d05d171d5c">
   That night, the vigilante attacked Hunt Multinational, killing the security personnel and stealing from the company's bank account. Quentin and his

The police stormed the party, where Quentin informed Oliver and Tommy the vigilante had attacked "a millionaire bottom-feeder" like them. The two men didn't know anything useful, so Oliver jokingly offered $2,000,000 to anyone who could find the vigilante. Annoyed and insulted at his seemingly unchanged playboy attitude, Quentin angrily asked if Oliver even tried to save Sara, remembering how she and

   A week later, Quentin interrogated
   Martin Somers
   at
   Starling Port
   in response to The Hood attacking him the night before. He questioned Somers as to why The Hood would be interested him, but Somers tried to deny that a confrontation even occurred. When Quentin pressed the issue, citing a 911 call and a green arrow left behind, Somers subtly threatened Laurel, who was prosecuting him. The next day, Quentin went to
   CNRI
   and placed Laurel, her friend and colleague
   Joanna de la Vega
   , and their
   client
   under police protection in case someone tried to attack them, due to Somers' threat and connection to the
   Chinese Triad
   .

  <p key="1cba436c-69c4-4b9e-9f5f-6189e96d70c1">
   That night after the Triad tried to kill Laurel at
   her apartment

   Starling City Docks
   when there were reports of The Hood battling
   China White
   . He cornered The Hood at gunpoint, but the vigilante escaped, leaving behind a trick arrow for Quentin with a recorded confession of Somers' crimes. Following Somers' arrest, Quentin made it his mission to bring down the vigilante.

  <p key="cdd7c709-b532-48ee-9b26-21a18f856e0d">
   Quentin and Lucas investigated the scene of
   James Holder
   's death, with the former correctly deducing that The Hood wasn't the one who killed him. At the police department, Quentin learned that the bullets which killed Holder were laced with
   curare
   , further supporting the theory. After exploring the crime scene again, he deduced where Holder's shooter was positioned. A few nights later following a second murder,
   Carl Rasmussen

    Moira Queen

   That night, Quentin was walking to his car after work when he was cornered by The Hood and pinned down. The vigilante needed the police's help protecting the people at the auction for Unidac in the
   Exchange Building
   . He revealed that
   Deadshot
   would attack the event and advised Quentin to have the SCPD wear Kevlar to protect themselves from the sniper's poisoned bullets, leaving behind a laptop of evidence. Despite his hatred of the Hood, Quentin took heed of the vigilante's warning and stationed multiple officers near possible vantage points in the Exchange Building. When Deadshot tried to kill Walter, Quentin pushed him out of the way, saving his life.

   When Laurel decided to represent

   Camille
   's murder, though believed it was a clear open-and-shut case. Later when Camille's supervisor,
   Matt Istook

   , Quentin rushed to the scene and realized Peter was indeed innocent after the
   real murderer
   confessed. Upon reuniting with Laurel, he admitted she was right about Peter but remained firm on his stance about The Hood. Laurel revealed the vigilante was wearing a prison guard uniform and ski mask when he rescued her, giving Quentin an idea. At the precinct, he had CSU tech
   Kelton
   review the footage from the Unidac auction attack from an altered perspective and discovered Oliver taking the vigilante's suit out of a duffle bag. The next morning, Quentin and the SCPD burst into the
   Queen Mansion
   to arrest Oliver on suspicion of obstruction of justice, aggravated assault, trespassing, acting as a vigilante, and murder.
  </p>
  <p key="1f89acd4-6e26-444d-9dbf-11b5eabb25ad">
   Quentin proceeded over Oliver's interrogation. Oliver insisted he wasn't a vigilante, to which Quentin angrily declared how he had always been a "dangerous menace". His interrogation was interrupted by Moira and Walter, who demanded Oliver not be questioned further without a lawyer. Seething, Quentin acquiesced and allowed the family 15 minutes. When Laurel decided to defend Oliver, Quentin was furious. Quentin also received a call from Oliver and saw that he was in danger, so he shot
   the man
   who was threatening Oliver's life.

In the middle of his interrogation of her, Quentin was called by The Hood and informed that the Glades will be destroyed by Malcolm Merlyn. Felicity alluded to the fact that she knows what the call was in reference to, basically stating "Sounds like you have bigger problems than me." Despite the fact that it might endanger her later, she pointed out that her opinion of The Hood was the same as his once, but had changed when she realized he had sacrificed a lot for the city and it made him a kind of hero. This, tied to the fact that The Glades was in danger, led Quentin to inform his superiors about

Instead of mobilizing the forces, Lieutenant Frank Pike suspended him, and the police took no action until Moira Queen held her press conference. When Diggle decided to go with Oliver to confront Malcolm Merlyn, Oliver called Detective Quentin to dismantle the earthquake device, instead of sending Felicity directly into the impact zone. The newly suspended-Detective Lance, along with Felicity's help, searched for, and successfully deactivated the Markov device. Nonetheless, Malcolm Merlyn hid a second device, which activated, and took out half of the Glades. Quentin rushed back through the crowds and towards CNRI, where he found Laurel barely escaping the rubble of her workplace's building. He held her back as she tried to go back in to save Tommy, telling her that it was too late. They stood there, watching, as most of The Glades was falling into rubble and ash.

During the hostage situation at the courthouse, Quentin runs to the scene and screams after Laurel but Oliver tells him she got separated from him. Fearing for his daughter's life and in his rage, he punched Mr. Donner and asked if the hostage situation was his idea. Officer Lance calls The Arrow and coincidentally, Oliver got a call from his "mom". While Oliver walked away, Quentin started to talk to The Arrow about the hostage situation and Arrow replies that he's aware of the situation. Quentin, Arrow, and Canary kidnap Frank Bertinelli to make The Huntress release Laurel. During the prisoner exchange, a crazed S.W.A.T officer opens fire against the vigilantes and aimed his gun at the Arrow but Quentin saved him by knocking out the policeman.

   Sometime after the Alpha-Omega incident, Quentin was approached by Damien Darhk. Lance began working with Darhk, believing that Darhk could help the faltering Starling City (which was renamed Star City to honor Ray Palmer, who died in an office explosion). Quentin was kept unaware of Darhk's true motives, or that Darhk was responsible for the sudden emergence of armed robbers terrorizing Star City, which earned the press nickname of "Ghosts."

   Lance was made a part of the city council to run Star City in the absence of a mayor. Aside from the pressures of trying to reinvigorate his home, Quentin struggled with handling the Ghosts. Eventually, Darhk made his presence known to the council, and explained his plans to let the city die. Darhk then went on to kill three of the council members, and then staging an assassination attempt on Quentin in order to hide their partnership. While Quentin was "saved" by Black Canary, he was shot in the shoulder. Some time later, Laurel came to her father, with evidence that the Ghosts had stolen cluster bombs from Kord Industries. While at the soon-to-be-reopened railway to Central City, Lance ran into Oliver Queen, and took the opportunity to blame him for Star City's condition, claiming that his presence created monsters. Quentin later confronted Darhk about his true agenda. Darhk reminded Lance he had no choice but to work with him and demanded information on the new "Green Arrow."

  <p key="24ffe3eb-0ee9-4f5f-b38b-0dd2a542cb0f">
   Days later when two police detectives were found shot dead, Lance found himself angry that finding out who the murderers were was not the SCPD's top priority. He then ran into Oliver Queen who told him that he would be running for mayor although Lance was not very supportive of this noting the fates of the other mayors. He then received a text from Laurel and told Oliver to have his team examine the evidence. Following Laurel Lance, he found Sara alive but chained up and in a feral state although Laurel assured him that she just needed some time for her senses to come back to her. Later at the police station, Oliver revealed to Lance that his detectives were killed by cops, a fact that surprised Lance. Oliver told Lance his plan to lure the cops out with drugs he procured and told Lance to spread the word.

   When the cops arrived, Lance and Team Arrow attacked them but the officers escaped. As they escaped, Lance realized that they were part of the Anti-Vigilante task force that Lance had reinstated when he was trying to capture Oliver. At the Arrowcave, the leader was revealed as
   Liza Warner
   one of the original recruits. Later, Lance went to Damien for advice for how to fix Sara; however, Damian only offered the advice that he put Sara out of her misery. Later back at his house, Lance found Oliver there who revealed to him he knew he was working with Damien Darhk. Lance defended himself saying Oliver had no right to judge him only for Oliver to point out that until now Lance was always the one that was more righteous.

  <p key="11c30b03-1c01-45ef-996f-6935561c9ef2">
   Lance explained that Damien came to him as a man who simply wanted to help Star City but by the time that he found out what type of person he was that Damian threatened Laurel. Oliver pointed out that Laurel could defend herself although when Lance tried to bring up Sara, Oliver accused Lance of hiding behind his daughters and that both Laurel and Sara would be ashamed of what he was doing. Oliver then told Lance that he was the reason he was running for mayor because he wanted Lance to see what true man he was and left. Lance went to the warehouse where Sara was imprisoned and was tearfully about to shoot her dead until Laurel talked him out of it.

  <p key="d297f369-2fff-4b98-81d9-f028c74f5aca">
   Later, at Laurel's apartment, Lance was captured by Liza and the group. Lance was forced to unlock the drug warehouse where he was tied up. Team Arrow arrived and defeated the task force however Warner managed to hold Green Arrow hostage only for Lance to talk her out of it. Later at his house, Oliver thanked Lance for saving him. Lance told him he meant what he said to Warner and that he would turn himself in only for Oliver to tell him that they needed someone close to Darhk and convinced him to work as a spy for the team.

Quentin brought it to the Arrowcave where Felicity analyzed it and identified it as a device designed to erase data. Oliver had Quentin work with Diggle which Diggle didn't take too well because of H.I.V.E.'s involvement in Andy's murder but agreed to work with Quentin. They broke into the server farm and installed the device watching as the device erased files on people.

He met with Laurel and Oliver at the Arrowcave. Along with Malcolm, they planned their next moves. Laurel took him aside and told him that she doesn't need him working for Darhk to protect her.

Quentin and Laurel talked where she showed remorse for locking him up, Quentin discovered that she was different from his daughter as she is a villain than a hero and has been working with Adrian. During a climactic battle on Lian Yu, Quentin would knock out Laurel before she could kill Dinah. When Chase killed himself setting off a chain reaction of explosions leading to the death of Samantha Clayton, Quentin and Dinah investigated the temple, where they encountered Laurel. Laurel was about to kill Dinah, in which Quentin instinctively shoots her and believed that he had killed her, wrecking him with guilt.

   Six months later, Quentin discovered that Laurel had survived her gunshot and has caused trouble in Star City, Quentin admitted the truth to Oliver that he had shot Laurel and has shown great remorse for it. He later caught up with her, but she used the guilt and remorse of shooting her to make him drop his weapon. It would be later revealed that she has been working with Cayden James, and she captured him to force Team Arrow to trade for him. Quentin conversed with Laurel and discovered that his doppelganger on Earth-Two died when shewas thirteen, he discovered that they both got the same kind of cake for their daughter's birthday.

Though he was unsuccessful at the time in truly getting her to turn over a new leaf, he did manage to get her to develop a mutual genuine father-daughter affection for him and to no longer hate her counterpart. He was initially angry when she unexpectedly revealed herself to the public pretending to be his Laurel, alive and held captive for 2 years by H.I.V.E., though he and the rest of Team Arrow decided to go along with it and allowed her to live with him in his apartment. She also began referring to him when speaking to others as “my father”. After finding out she never had a real job, he gave her his Laurel's old books to study to try and help her develop a life for herself away from villainy.

   After calming down and realizing Laurel was telling him the truth, Quentin told her that he believed her and was sorry for what he said, explaining to her it would be hypocritical to judge her for doing bad things for the right reasons (which in her case was protecting them both), as he had done the same working with Damien Darhk to protect his Laurel. He asked why she was so terrified of him and she told him how she had worked with a bunch of bad people who were filled with hate but Diaz was worse than that and she'd watched him burn a man alive over a childhood grudge. He promised to protect her even though she appeared skeptical he could and she in turn agreed that they’d protect each other. He and Oliver ultimately were relieved and shocked respectively after Laurel took him up on his advice to stand up to Diaz by betraying him and testifying in court that Oliver wasn't the Green Arrow even after Diaz had threatened her not to, with her telling Quentin that he got her change her mind and she knew what to do thanks to him after Quentin advised her not to stay in town to protect herself.

   Samanda Watson
   (who was helping them liberate the city from Diaz), Laurel's true identity and that she wasn't really his daughter while prioritizing catching Diaz over saving Laurel, telling him that his way of prioritizing catching the bad guy while simply insisting they can protect his daughter is what got their Laurel killed in the first place while questioning Oliver if he'd be trying to get Diaz over saving Laurel if it was their Laurel.

   He later made amends with Oliver and during a discussion about how far they've come with their friendship subtly mentioned he had a pace maker and went rogue against the FBI and Team Arrow's plan to use him in a sting operation to catch Diaz during the operation, turning himself into Diaz (knowing they’d be able to track his pace maker which Diaz was unaware of when he had him patted down) stating he wanted to see Laurel and was taken to her. Diaz immediately offered her to let her go in exchange for getting the FBI out of the city and threatened to shoot Laurel (who was forced to wear a power-dampening collar) in 5 seconds, with her telling him not to let him have the city and betting her life that Diaz was bluffing. Diaz gave Quentin five seconds then attempted to shoot her, though Quentin jumped in front of the bullet for her and Laurel stood guard over him and teared up while desperately attempting to comfort him and keep him from falling unconscious, calling him "dad" for the first time despite having only referred to him as "her father" when speaking to others in the past.

   Diaz told her by shooting him where he did she had enough time to get Quentin to get the FBI to leave the city, claiming he had given him mercy similar to the dog in a movie that he asked her the name of. An enraged Laurel told Diaz she was gonna kill him then spotted up to him and stared him down defiantly as Diaz told Quentin he was just gonna shoot her now in front of him, with Quentin pleading him not to. As he was about to kill her in front of him, Oliver, Team Arrow, and the FBI arrived, forcing Diaz to flee. Oliver called out to Quentin and saw him critically wounded with Laurel tending to him. Dinah told him to get Diaz and he shot the lock off their cell. Dinah arrived and to Laurel's shock, she freed her from her power-dampening collar rather than attempt to kill her again and together they assisted Quentin in getting him to the paramedics outside while fending off Diaz's men.

He thanked Oliver for everything he had done, with Oliver in turn smiling and telling him they'll be waiting for him when he's out of surgery.

     Quentin's morals and beliefs center around true, and justice coming from law and order; his beliefs about the Arrow being a menace to
     Starling City

     </a>
     , seeing how powerless the police is in dealing with the various crises in the city and knowing how effective the Arrow is with dealing with them, his beliefs about law and order have changed; while he still holds himself as an enforcer of the law, he now believed that the law isn't omnipotent and that justice should prevail over doing that is strictly legal; as such, he is now more willing to seek extra-legal measures to seek justice and is now pro-Arrow, especially after finding out that the Arrow is now going out of his way to avoid killing his enemies.

He chose to remain willfully ignorant of the Arrow's identity, telling Laurel that knowing the identity of the man under the hood would endanger the Arrow and diminish his effectiveness.

     Quentin has a sense of justice, honor, and good morals, even during the time when he despised the Arrow; he refused to let him take the heat for a murder the Dark Archer committed, even when his commanding officer,
     Brian Nudocerdo
     gave him an order to blame it on the Arrow, even though it resulted in him being taken off the case. Even when he got demoted for associating himself with the Arrow, he never blamed him and continued to work with him, especially after realising that the Arrow is trying to avoid killing unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p key="e72858cd-8b6c-45ca-be9d-0ee4d6e27b07">
     Over time, Quentin began to realize what the Arrow has to give up in exchange for maintaining his identity a secret while at the same making Starling City a better place; even when Laurel learned that Oliver was the Arrow, Quentin told her to not speak about it and said he would rather spend 18 months in prison than uncover the Arrow's identity for his freedom even though he was attacked by a prisoner who he and the Arrow previously put away. The first thing he did after being promoted to police captain was disband the Anti-Vigilante Task Force so the Arrow could continue his work uninhibited to make his job and life easier.

     Quentin is proven to (genuinely) care about the well being of innocent individuals and catching criminals. Even after he was promoted to a police captain, the purpose of which was to remove him from the field because of the medical condition he developed from fighting

     , he still continued to go on the field to help the Arrow.

     Quentin is proven to have a sarcastic sense of humour; when the Arrow told Quentin he had to cut their meeting short because he had to be somewhere, Quentin sarcastically asked if he had a "hot date" (which was actually true) Quentin also sarcastically asked if there was a "spare earthquake machine" after a break-in at

     When Quentin found out from Laurel that Sara is dead, this time for real, he was devastated over his daughter's death. However, unlike before, he was able to handle Sara's death; he (initially) did not become an alcoholic again, although he was tempted to drink a bottle of wine. His relationship with Laurel had become estranged; due to the fact that she knew that Sara was dead for months, but she did not tell him, as Quentin had every right to know that Sara had died (Laurel using the excuse that he literally wouldn't be able to take it because of his medical condition). He was also furious and feels immensely betrayed towards the Arrow for knowing Sara had died but kept it secret from him, and returns to his original "law and order" mindset, deciding that he was done with the Arrow.

When he discovers that Oliver is the Arrow, he blamed Oliver for all his family and the city's problems, and his opinion for Oliver became low again, as he had stated to the latter that he is "no hero, but he is a villain". However, in spite of letting his personal feelings cloud his judgement against

     Quentin relapsed and had become an alcoholic again, although he tried to downplay it that "it's two drinks a day". However, when called out by Laurel that they're alcoholics, he was told by her that he can continue blaming her, Oliver and the rest of the world if he wanted for Sara's death, but falling off the wagon was on him and now he had a choice to make, keep drinking or make his daughters proud and help save the city during the
     League of Assassins' biological attack
     on Starling City. Ultimately choosing the latter, he assists
     Team Arrow
     once more and, while his opinion of Oliver was not at all what it once was, he admitted he doesn't want Oliver dead when he was trying to protect the city, as he still has some respect for Oliver left.

     6 months later, while keeping Oliver's new identity as "Green Arrow" a secret and willing to work with him again, but simultaneously, Quentin still blamed Oliver for making the city become so dangerous. However, after Oliver discovered his secret alliance with

    <p key="07e78e9f-431c-48a6-a32b-24eb70562c08">
     Quentin had witnessed first hand what Damien was capable of and knew, even with Laurel's newly-improved combat skills, she still would be no match for the master sorcerer; his fears later proved to be correct. He would have turned himself in for atoning his crimes, if Oliver didn't convince him to act as a double agent for him.

    Quentin loved Laurel very much to the point that believed that he could make her

    more like her even though she stated that she was nothing like her, however, this notion began to cloud his judgement as he often clashed with the team in trying to connect with Earth-2 Laurel. Ultimately, he is proven to be correct as Earth-2 Laurel stood up to

     In the new multiverse, Quentin possessed a similar personality and the same memories as he had prior to his death, with the exception of memories experienced after the time of his death. By this time, Oliver and Quentin had become strong allies, the latter trusting the former so much that he didn't hesitate in believing Oliver when he claimed they were stuck in a time loop (and joked that after all the crazy things he had seen, this was not outside their version of normal) Quentin was also shown to be selfless; in some of the loops, Oliver even told him beforehand what to expect but put his life on the line to help others anyway.
    </p>
    In the final loop, where Oliver realized he needed to say goodbye and accept that fate can't be changed, Quentin revealed that it was his daughters that ultimately allowed him to see the good that Oliver was doing and influenced him to stop attempting to take him down all those years ago; he recognized that Laurel and Sara were both good judges of character and that, therefore; if they trusted Oliver then he should too.
