   Kryptonite is normally green, and
   Kryptonians
   exposed to the element will become weak within close proximity to it or if pierced by weapons laced with or made from the substance, and prolonged exposure is fatal. Kryptonite is comprised of sodium, lithium and boron, as well as elements not found on
   <a href="Earth.html" key="63109501-807e-460e-9e65-76c6da416a08" title="Earth">

   .
   Kryptonite's effects are radioactive in nature and therefore cannot penetrate the element lead. The radiation of the mineral can be harnessed and used independent of the substance itself to harm a Kryptonian; usually appearing in the form of artificial light emitted from certain machinery.
   It has even been used as anesthesia or a sedative against Kryptonians due to its effects. Kryptonite inside the body causes green glowing veins to protrude from the skin of a Kryptonian and the physical pain it causes becomes unbearable at that point (as seen when

   injected
   Astra
   with liquid kryptonite to torture her for information).
   Physical signs of being affected by kryptonite are somewhat fever-like; including nausea, weakness, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, pain and loss (or near loss) of consciousness. Physical contact with kryptonite of higher intensity is enough to cause burning pain. Kara described the kryptonite poisoning as like having "nails in [her] blood".

   and was later confirmed to in fact be the alternate multiverse's version of a Kryptonian),
   being hit with green kryptonite only made him stronger (like what happened to
   Bizarro
   of the regular multiverse's Earth-38), though, unlike Bizarro, the kryptonite didn't degrade his body or mind.

   the way it does Kryptonians, having it pierce the skin—such as being shot with a chunk of kryptonite in a manner similar to being hit with a regular bullet—can still cause terminal radiation poisoning. Even if the kryptonite is removed from the wound a short time after being shot with the stone, this ultimately leads to slow and painful death in humans.

   Maxwell Lord
   ) was shot with bullets made of green kryptonite, in spite of her strength being equal to Supergirl's, her powers work in a manner directly opposite to a Kryptonian; being hit by green kryptonite unexpectedly corrupted her; physically and mentally degrading her, and only made her stronger
   (though Bizarro is
   meta-human
   rather than Kryptonian). In the case of
   Kyle Cushing
   (who'd been empowered by X-kryptonite by
   Tal-Rho
   's experiments to turn the people of Smallville into his own army by using X-kryptonite to place the consciousnesses of deceased Kryptonians inside the bodies of humans; thus making those people like meta-humans to a certain degree),
   being around green kryptonite impacted him in much the same way it would a Kryptonian (thus, shooting him with kryptonite while the Kryptonian persona in his body was active presumably would've affected him in the same manner as it would a regular Kryptonian). However, how being shot with green kryptonite would affect other meta-humans (such as

Because of the threat it posed, Superman wanted to destroy it, but J'onn kept it to use as a weapon against other hostile Kryptonians. This led to a falling out between the two that wouldn't be mended until several years later when J'onn entrusted all of the D.E.O.'s kryptonite to Superman to get rid of in order to keep it out of the wrong hands.

   When Mon-El's mother and father (Rhea and Lar Gand) arrived on Earth looking for their son, but Mon-El said that he wished to stay on Earth, his parents—especially his mother—refused to let him stay with his
   new family
   . When Kara decided to try to just talk to Rhea, the latter met with Kara and Mon-El at the Fortress of Solitude, and, as Kara learned by being near Rhea, the latter had a pair of kryptonite daggers with her, which she explained that she'd had made from kryptonite that fell upon Daxam when Krypton was destroyed
   (with the fallout of that planet's destruction endangering Daxam; thus the reason Mon-El had been sent away from Daxam in the first place). She then attacked Kara with the daggers, prompting Mon-El to agree to go with Rhea to make his mother stop hurting Kara.

  <p key="ba9094c9-382e-435e-8956-38bc401884c2">
   A short time later, Kara, J'onn and Winn ended up using a
   transmatter portal
   to get themselves onto Rhea and Lar Gand's ship to rescue Mon-El (who, in spite of reluctantly agreeing to what his mother wanted, was still being taken against his will). In the fight that ensued aboard the ship, Rhea's daggers ended up getting sucked out a broken window into the vacuum of space. After Lar Gand ultimately allowed Mon-El to stay on Earth, as he could see that that was what his son truly wanted, Rhea murdered her husband and vowed to make Earth suffer for taking her son from her.
   During
   the Daxamites' subsequent invasion of Earth

   the Legion of Super-Heroes used their future technology to heal her. The Legion knew from future history that Supergirl would survive, and that Reign would leave eventually; but they didn't know when they'd be rid of Reign, or how it would happen. A short time later, after Reign declared war on all criminals and law enforcement officers alike, J'onn decided to initiate the Sundown Protocol against Reign. This was a last-ditch option intended to take down Superman if he were to ever go rogue. This meant using all weapons that could be used against a Kryptonian; sound bombs,
   red sun grenades
   and more—kryptonite included.

   Winn reminded J'onn that Clark had gotten rid of all the D.E.O.'s kryptonite, but J'onn said that they still had kryptonite the D.E.O had recently confiscated from
   Thomas Coville
   ;
   the founder and leader of
   a cult
   dedicated to worshipping Supergirl (the last thing he tried doing before being apprehended had been to attempt to detonate a bomb under a packed stadium, so that Supergirl would save everyone inside; with Thomas hoping they'd be "converted" to his cause). When Supergirl tried approaching it, she'd weakened, due to the fact that the bomb had soil from Krypton on it; which contained traces of kryptonite. Kara then took advantage of her weakened state in the substance's presence to cut herself in an attempt to prove to Coville that she wasn't a god.
  </p>
  <p key="fd24d8e9-1c83-43d3-a8d9-09753c65961d">
   This prompted Thomas to try to stop the bomb, but he couldn't. Alex then arrived on the scene and removed the kryptonite (which the D.E.O. then kept), and Supergirl was able to use her heat vision to send the bomb far enough underground so that no one was hurt in the explosion; though it did awaken Mon-El (who'd travelled 12,000 years into the past with the Legion of Super-Heroes as part of a mission, and the group had subsequently put themselves to sleep, intending to reawaken in the thirty-first century) from stasis in
   a ship
   buried in the Earth).
   When everything was ready, the D.E.O. staged a bank robbery to draw Reign out. In spite of all their preparations, and utilizing all of their anti-Kryptonian weapons against her at once, she managed to shrug everything off—even the kryptonite—and escape; also breaking Alex's leg in the scuffle.

   a special suit

   Eventually, it got so bad that in addition to the intense pain that the injury continued causing her, she also began experiencing episodes of severe vertigo and photopsia; prompting her to do more research on the stone's properties.

Leslie then accompanied Edge to Metropolis, where they started attacking the city, with Edge empowering several of the city's residents with Kryptonian abilities; thanks to his new powers granted by the Eradicator. A short time later, when Edge attacked the van Sam Lane was driving; hauling Sarah Cushing along with Jordan and Jonathan. After the vehicle rolled over due to a collision with Edge, Sam asked the boys to reach into the glove compartment for a pistol loaded with kryptonite. Jonathan grabbed it and, on Sam's instruction, fired at Edge. However, Edge flew out of the way, grabbed Jordan, and flew off. Edge then took him to another location and used his Eradicator power to place his father (Zeta-Rho)'s consciousness inside Jordan.

   Maxwell Lord created a synthetic red form of kryptonite (though whether this kryptonite was made from scratch (like synthetic kryptonite created by Lena Luthor) or by modifying green kryptonite (similar to how Alex "made" blue kryptonite) is unknown) in hopes of subduing
   Non
   's next attack. However, it didn't work as intended; rather than weaken Kryptonians physically, red kryptonite alters their minds by weakening and gradually destroying their inhibitions, as well as bringing every negative thought to the surface. They can even feel its effects long after they have left its presence. As this happens, red, glowing veins momentarily protrude from the skin when they first come near red kryptonite and subsequently in times when the victim's actions and thoughts are most affected by the substance. Symptoms of red kryptonite infection first start as the Kryptonian becoming more abrasive and immature in personality and actions as their mental and emotional restraint is lessened. Eventually, the Kryptonian will be left without morality, patience, rationality or any cares, whatsoever. They can even develop narcissistic tendencies and arrogance that results in an inferiority complex. After having expressed their negative personality traits fully, the Kryptonian will become malevolent and prone to hostility and aggression, leaving them a danger to everyone around them.
   However, Maxwell also developed a cure for it in the form of a red energy blaster that neutralized the red kryptonite in a targeted victim; as seen with Kara Danvers, this briefly knocks the affected Kryptonian out, as the substance then left Kara's body in the form of a red gas. This ultimately returned Kara to her normal self.

It quickly became bad enough that Jordan began having trouble breathing; as an A.I. of Jor-El at the Fortress of Solitude told Clark, the kryptonite was causing Jordan's lungs to fill with fluid, but due to his system cooling the air he breathed (his freezing breath), the kryptonite was essentially gradually freezing his lungs. As Jor-El's A.I. explained, the only way to get the kryptonite out of Jordan's system would be to do as had been done with Clark in the past (burning it). As Sam told his daughter Lois, the gas was untested, and they had no idea how it would affect Superman.

He stated that he was wrong to think that Superman could ever go rogue, and intended to only keep enough kryptonite to contain Morgan and Leslie; the rest of Project 7734's arsenal would be enclosed in concrete and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

Lois insisted that if weapons that could harm Superman existed, the wrong people inevitably would get ahold of them. After Clark explained his reasons for wanting Project 7734 to stay in place, Lois agreed, but refused to trust the D.O.D. regarding the matter. Clark then spoke to John Irons; saying that if necessary, John alone should have the capability to kill him. John honestly stated that he trusted Superman now, but Clark said that John had come to Earth-Prime striving to protect the world from Superman, and that's what he was asking John to do by leaving the latter in charge of Project 7734.

   On their home world or in Argo City, black kryptonite is harmless to Kryptonians. However, on Earth, touching the substance not only causes great pain to a Kryptonian, but also makes their powers unstable. It can also be used to split a Kryptonian into two separate entities (such as when Lena used it to separate Reign from Sam; one of them evil, the other good). When Kara used it to send herself, Reign and Sam into the
   Dark Valley
   to defeat Reign; preventing anyone else from getting hurt in the conflict, it split Kara in two—unbeknownst to Kara at the time—sending

   Harun-El is also an incredible power source. It was able to power the dome of Argo City as well as sustain an ecosystem and the artificial gravity on the asteroid that houses Argo. Argonians were given a recipe to make the substance from elements on Argo, courtesy of Lena Luthor who figured out how to make it. When harnessed correctly, black kryptonite has mutagenic and healing properties on humans. Tumor masses that Lena was testing the serum on had unintentionally been made invulnerable. It was revealed that the powers bestowed upon human subjects proved fatal in the long run, with Lena's experiments focusing on removing the deadlier effects before proper use. After supposedly being perfected, the serum was used on James Olsen and Lex Luthor to heal them both.
   Said version used on James was thought to be separated from the mutagenic part, but this wasn't successful and he gained temporary Kryptonian abilities; including enhanced strength, senses, durability, accelerated healing, flight and heat vision, until the drug was extracted from his body. Lex Luthor and Ben Lockwood at least gained the power of super strength, while the former also gained levitation with the Harun-El in his system, though somehow Luthor's version of the injection seemed more stable than either Ben or James's for unknown reasons, as he didn't suffer any noticable side-effects from the serum. All three later had the drug forcibly taken out of their bodies.
   As seen with Lockwood, while he did gain powers from the serum,
   due to the fact that he injected himself was an unfinished version of the drug, his body began to gradually deteriorate,
   though this stopped once the Harun-El was removed from his bloodstream.

When Clark had crashed on Earth, kryptonite impacted all around the world for a week; all types of kryptonite made it to Earth in constant meteor showers that occurred during this time, but only Smallville had X-kryptonite; thus the reason only people who'd lived in Smallville for years were gaining stable powers from it (by contrast to people like Derek Powell, who weren't from Smallville), and the reason Morgan Edge had specifically come to Smallville to find recruits for his army.

However, Dabney truthfully stated that he had no idea how the technology even works, and that in order to put a stop to Edge's scheme, they needed to place the consciousness of the one who invented it (Superman's biological mother;
   Lara Lor-Van
   ) inside a host to speak to her (and, due to the nature of the procedure, that individual had to be from Smallville in order for it to work). Lana Lang immediately volunteered, and even though Lois was hesitant to allow her to do it, she eventually agreed to let Lana go through with it. Lara, through Lana, then stated that she'd never intended for her technology to be used for what Edge was utilizing it to do, and helped them to use the Eradicator to reverse the process. Due to Superman's weakened state following him releasing all the solar energy in his body at once (creating a solar flare) in order to give the Eradicator enough power to de-power everyone Edge had placed Kryptonian consciousnesses inside of all at the same time, this left Clark powerless until his cells had replenished their supply of solar energy, and he crash-landed at the Fortress of Solitude.

It weakens a Kryptonian's physical attributes, including blocking the ability of the body's cells to absorb and use yellow solar radiation with continued exposure. Green K can kill with prolonged exposure.

The two fight and when Clark wins, the personas merge and Superman returns to normal.

    Unlike its comic counterpart, white kryptonite was created by using the same duplicating ray that made Bizarro in an attempt to form a kryptonite to kill Bizarro. Instead, the white kryptonite stabilized and cured the molecularly unstable Bizarro.

     Green Kryptonite:
    </b>
    Aside weakening and harming Kryptonians (and suppressing their powers, especially their healing factor and invulnerability), can, under certain circumstances, to caused mutations in humans, animals, and plants. Humans developed a variety of superhuman abilities that typically proved dangerous to themselves and others. In some cases, the radioactivity of green kryptonite could be neutralized and the resulting "clear" kryptonite would be harmless to Kryptonians and humans.

     Red Kryptonite:
    </b>
    Continuous contact with red kryptonite compromised a Kryptonian's inhibitions and morality; often causing them to break the law and act selfish and rebellious. Its effects on humans are mostly unknown, though it seems have no effect unless it's combined with some chemicals. Removing the contact quickly ended the effects.

     Black Kryptonite:

     Silver Kryptonite:

     Blue Kryptonite:
    </b>
    Suppressed superhuman abilities in Kryptonians with continuous contact, specifically resistance to illness and injury. Aging in Kryptonians was also increased to the speed of humans by prolonged contact. Kryptonians were resistant to effects of green kryptonite when in contact with blue K. In humans, blue K dramatically improved health. With Bizarro, blue K exponentially increased the clone's powers to the point the body became unstable and exploded, killing the Phantom Zone wraith. It also removes a Kryptonian's powers, but only as long as the Kryptonian remains in contact with it.

     Gemstone Kryptonite:

    A mineral infused with Kryptonite that would give Kryptonians the power of hypnotic persuasion over others. It was primarily seen in pulverized dust form. The persuasion could also affect the Kryptonian persuader if their command was directed back at them through a reflective surface. The effects were counteracted with green K.
