  <p key="7a0dc206-9f93-4246-bb2a-4fa5aff78c98">
   This scene begins with Barry seeing the vision of Savitar murdering Iris. Turns out it's a bad dream Barry has while dozing as he and Iris are sleeping. Barry advises her to return to rest yet Iris squeezes him to discuss it. They appear to be very private.
  </p>
  <p key="a7f59de9-2fb7-4a70-a33e-1b1b763f2817">
   Their telephones ring and get a ready that a fire is in progress. Iris makes reference to that Wally is going to beat Barry to the scene.
  </p>
  <p key="d55a809c-21b5-41b2-9d80-68954e67cd25">
   Barry hurries off and gets to the scene and he and Wally meet and discover that the fire is caught in a room. Barry understands that the fire will extend on the off chance that they open up the entryway so Bary makes a vortex to suck the fire out a window and go in to spare each.
  </p>
  <p key="7259149b-2222-44b8-ba4f-86642e6e7f2f">
   Wally and Barry head back to STAR Labs and Wally specifies something about "kicking ass." Cisco catches him and gets a piece curt about how being superheroes aren't tied in with kicking ass.
  </p>
  <p key="f6177da4-979a-4223-a372-86ea34b3b9da">
   While at STAR Labs, Caitlin makes notice to Cisco that her wristbands aren't working and continue passing on.
  </p>
  <p key="877b9394-c8e4-46b8-a525-a2a023fb4abd">
   We see Wally stroll into the police office and the refined man they spared from the fire before is conversing with a police criminologist about how the Kid Flash is by all accounts more slow The Flash. Wally catches everything and shows a dislike his face.
  </p>
  <p key="27e24574-a2e2-4c49-8ee3-911e5fbd2650">
   Back at STAR Labs, Wells gives the gathering a visit through the historical center he's making and shows the gathering that he's made a 3D image of Cisco to use as a local escort.
  </p>
  <p key="faa2b1f9-c7a9-4cc2-86b6-a399e64fabe7">
   Caitlin goes to visit Julian at the police headquarters and requests his assistance with disposing of her forces saying she needs to dispose of her forces "before she harms another person." Her wristbands begin blaring and she runs out into the foyer as we see her eyes turn white, as they've done in the quick while she was Killer Frost. She connects her wristband to a force source, implying that her forces may be wild if the wristbands are dead.
  </p>
  <p key="759219d3-fa13-4ac4-8fd1-c9e6de308351">
   Back at Barry and Iris', Barry shocks her by unloading a portion of their products and Iris approaches him again about bad dreams he's been having. Barry's telephone begins sending a caution and it's a theft in progress. As Barry gets to the gems store, he discovers it's being burglarized by Jared Morillo.
  </p>
  <p key="2ed8372f-4582-4232-804d-bc8bfcd1a10c">
   At STAR Labs, Team Flash assembles to talk about the new looter who got away on a bike. Barry has a brisk flashback to the past course of events where the news reports are discussing Morillo and he interfaces the two that Morillo is presently in this current timetable because of Flashpoint.
  </p>
  <p key="7b7a67cd-a504-4184-a012-3926489466c2">
   Caitlin discovers her way back to the police division where we see her reassuring a down Julian about the activities he did under Savitar's influence. Caitlin recommends he joins Team Flash at STAR Labs and Julian decays.
  </p>
  <p key="8d9c3c17-fe02-460c-bc2d-d38c2a2bddd4">
   Barry approaches Wells back at Team Flash HQ and asks him whether he has faith in a fixed future or an ever-evolving future. Wells reveals to Barry he thinks what's to come is constantly fixed with Cisco rings in and says another theft is in progress.
  </p>
  <p key="42bbf823-bd6e-4886-935f-735738f6918e">
   Barry Rushes and discovers Morillo in another theft. Morillo appears to have extraordinary projectiles that can case Barry and he in the long run dodges them just to see Wally appear and take Morillo leveled out. While an onlooker is recording a video, Wally investigates the camera and presents himself as Kid Flash.
  </p>
  <p key="7e8b4ccd-5cb7-4c36-82ab-67d464c68f2e">
   The Flash and Kid Flash come back to STAR Labs and the air is happy. Everybody is high fiving, embracing, and praising Wally on halting Morillo however Barry dampers the disposition as he reminds Wally that he should shadow. On out, Joe reveals to Barry that "Whatever the explanation you have for teasing Wally, if it's not too much trouble get over it."
  </p>
  <p key="4c1c43e1-3efe-486b-8cb5-4778a1723816">
   We go upstairs to the excellent opening of the STAR Labs Museum and nobody has appeared. A few strolls in and Wells takes a stab at getting permission expenses out of them and as the Cisco 3D image begins blaming out, the couple surges out of the historical center. Julian at that point strolls in and says he acknowledges Caitlin's proposal to join Team Flash.
  </p>
  <p key="8f23dacd-eea0-40c4-b19f-f1c3e0acd8bc">
   Barry, Caitlin, Wally, iris, and Cisco are seen ground floor having a private discussion about the implications of Julian joining Team Flash and Caitlin reminds the gathering the Julian hasn't uncovered Barry's job as The Flash yet. Barry brings Iris into the mystery room the Reverse Flash kept and shows Iris the paper he generally verifies whether the future changes.
