   is the son of the late
   Rachel Rosso
   and a former friend of

   . His plans to create a cure for HLH using

   meta-human
   . Despite his research and the best efforts of himself and
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   , he was unable to find a permanent medical solution to his condition, though he eventually came to the conclusion that he could live forever so long as he strikes fear into others and feeds on their adrenaline-infused blood, leading him to completely abandon his humanity in favor of self-preservation.

   When Ramsey was seven, he hurt his knee in a biking accident. He felt extreme pain and wanted to give up, but his mother encouraged him to never give up despite the pain. Years later, this would become a defining incident with Ramsey and his personality. He eventually followed in his mother's footsteps and became a doctor, working alongside
   Caitlin Snow
   until she left to join
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   on his mother's recommendation.

  <p key="f28b2e99-f914-467e-80aa-6ca12fb0e2db">
   Eventually, his mother was diagnosed with HLH cancer forcing Ramsey to watch as his mother's life slowly faded over the course of months. However, instead of fighting the cancer, Rachel Russo instead spent her remaining time doing the things she most wanted to do in life. This particularly angered her son who felt she was being cowardly by not fighting her cancer. Rachel then passed away, leaving her son with lingering feelings regarding death and lab results that showed a 99% chance he would have the same cancer she had.

  <p key="a8990373-0fe7-49bc-afea-c9a69271d4d3">
   Ramsey relentlessly researched a cure for himself, running countless simulations that all came back with the same result - that he needed
   dark matter
   to complete the cure. Knowing that Caitlin was still employed at S.T.A.R. Labs, a known producer of dark matter, he invited her to his mother's funeral. There, they exchanged pleasantries and Ramsey brought up the idea of meeting again under the guise of friendship.
  </p>
  <p key="444fd2f3-b542-4bb3-ba3a-61d100c96a06">
   Caitlin eventually agreed to share coffee with him and they met at

   . Ramsey quickly moved the conversation about his mother to his research, letting Caitlin know that he needed dark matter to finish it. Caitlin repeatedly objected because it would cause unknown risks, angering Ramsey and causing him to leave the coffee shop. Now being forced to find dark matter elsewhere, Ramsey purchased a dark matter powered weapon off the black market. Taking the dark matter he needed, Ramsey injected himself with the cure. Initially, it seemed to work, but things turned horrifying moments later, mutating Ramsey into something else.

   Despite injecting himself with the cure, Ramsey wasn't completely cured. He sought out another dark matter weapon, only this time his dealer was
   Mitch Romero
   . Mitch informed him that the price had jumped from $500 to $5000, when Ramsey informed Mitch that he didn't have the money a fight broke out when Ramsey attempted to take the weapon from Mitch. Mitch knocked him to the ground, leading to Ramsey activating his powers in a moment of distress and exposing Mitch to an unknown substance that ultimately killed him.

  <p key="712f760a-1bd2-41c6-b07f-295fbb488415">
   Ramsey discreetly took Mitch's body back to his lab, where Mitch resurrected himself and knocked out Ramsey.
   Ramsey then awoke the next morning to find

   and Caitlin interrogating him over a dark matter theft that the undead Mitch committed. Ramsey lied, informing them that
   Ted Kord
   gave him dark matter and that Mitch broke in and attacked Ramsey. He then manages to convince Barry that he could help their investigation by analyzing a blood sample they found at a crime scene. After some verbal sparring between him and Caitlin, Barry gets a call that Mitch has broken into
   Mercury Labs
   .
  </p>
  <p key="483fc3f0-e58d-4f2d-bc01-7e498d5dfffd">
   After Barry brings him a sample of Mitch's blood, he discovers that while the dark matter enhances Mitch it also destroys the healthy cells. Barry informs Ramsey that Mitch has been dead for over 24 hours and starts to leave before Ramsey pleads with Barry to take him with on the investigation. Barry reluctantly does and brings Ramsey to S.T.A.R. Labs to develop a way to beat Mitch.
  </p>
  <p key="c87616a3-29d5-45da-b299-c9a6115ace8f">
   Ramsey explains to Barry that he could use gene-splicing to weaken Mitch long enough for an arrest, but informs Barry that he'll need more supplies. Barry then leaves the room, allowing Ramsey to steal some dark matter. Barry comes back, revealing that he suspected Ramsey would try something like what he was doing. Ramsey angrily retorts that he's dying and that the dark matter is the only way to cure him, something Barry should understand as he knows the look of a dead man. Barry manages to convince Ramsey to give back the dark matter and help them defeat Mitch.

   Later that night, Ramsey continued to study Mitch's blood sample that was mystifying him. Suddenly Ramsey heard a noise and went looking for the source, discovering that Mitch had sneaked into S.T.A.R. Labs, who attacked Ramsey shortly afterward. While being strangled up against a wall Ramsey pleaded with Mitch to stop which, much to Ramsey's shock, worked. After being lowered to the floor Ramsey discovered that Mitch was responding to his voice and visual commands, before Barry rushed Mitch down to the
   Pipeline
   and defeat the zombie-like creature.

   The ordeal over, Ramsey left S.T.A.R. Labs and took a sample of Mitch's blood with him. He observed immense healing properties and hypothesizing that this was the permanent cure he was looking for. He then proceeded to absorb the blood before concluding that he needed more.

   Sometime afterward Ramsey broke into a blood bank at a hospital, stealing the blood and taking it to his lab. There, on the verge of collapsing, he injected his mutated blood into the regular blood in the hopes that it would create the same substance from Mitch Romero. Hours later, he injected himself with the new version of the cure but collapsed in pain shortly after injecting it. He discovered that his new cure lacked something that Mitch Romero had before death.

   Barry then dropped by with a cure made from
   Dominator technology
   leftover from their invasion three years prior. This left Ramsey stumped as he knew Barry himself was dying and that this cure could work for him too. Barry just responded that Ramsey could save lives as well before leaving. Ramsey took a sample of the Dominator cure and injected it into a sample of his cells, dismayed to discover that his body was too far gone for the cure to work. Suddenly he made a realization; Mitch was afraid at the time of his death and thus was releasing adrenaline into his system before death. Ramsey concluded that his victims need to feel fear before he kills them, disregarding the Hippocratic oath that hung above his lab. He arrives at a hospital and starts killing patients and doctors alike.

   Long into his killing spree, Flash and Killer Frost arrive to see the damage he's done. While Killer Frost fights his reanimated victims Flash confronts Ramsey, asking him why since he was handed a cure. Ramsey takes a hostage and explains that the cure didn't work, so he decided to use living people as incubators for his cure. He explains that he hasn't just found the cure for HLH but for death itself, making him life eternal. He kills his hostage and escapes through the window, satisfied with his efforts but nowhere near done.

   on a rooftop, grabbing him and falling off the building with him. As soon as they fell to the ground, Ramsey continued attacking Ralph, throwing a car at him and firing chunks of black blood at him, most of which the latter was able to dodge, but not for the last few. Ralph managed to gain the upper hand by punching Ramsey and attempted to take him to Iron Heights before Ramsey recovered and absorbed the former's healthy blood cells with his own blood, leaving him on the ground convulsing.

  <p key="afedea10-8f36-484b-aa14-29e9f3cc13f3">
   When Barry managed to save Ralph's life by injecting some of his blood into him, a tiny amount of Ramsey's blood had made its way into Barry's body, slowly taking control over him and turning him into a monstrous speedster, who made his way to see Ramsey before bowing to him as his follower, or in Ramsey's words, "Blood Brother".

  <p key="81bd6234-ed78-459a-9031-a32adc602ad2">
   While seemingly once a noble man who with a strong devotion to the protection of life, Ramsey's true nature can be defined by his obsession and fear of death. Watching his mother die without fighting her cancer caused Ramsey to develop an intense obsession with defeating death. And his mother's acceptance of death caused him to label her a coward, for not taking a chance to fight and survive. Ultimately it was a fear of death that pushed Ramsey to extremes in developing a cure for cancer then testing it on himself, despite advice being given to him about its possible adverse effects. His new obsession strained his friendship with
   Caitlin Snow
   .
  </p>
  <p key="14167bf2-69f5-4487-ad46-0992e73fa568">
   A short time after developing his powers and learned how it could extend his life and potentially grant him eternal life, Ramsey quickly went down a sinister path. Despite Ramsey having a copy of the Hippocratic oath hung up in his lab, he is proven to have no value to the quote "I will do no harm to others" and proceeded to break the oath. Having seen a victim of his powers produce a healing substance from the fear-induced adrenaline in their blood, Ramsey became determined to create more no matter the lives it costs.
  </p>
  <p key="13b2241f-ecc8-417c-8ef8-74916a1f1da5">
   Through his descent into madness, Ramsey has developed both a delusion of grandeur and a messiah complex. For all his remorseless killings of innocents, he ironically views his actions as a salvation for humanity. By reanimating his victims as zombies in a hive-mind of his control, he believes that this is the way to forever overcome death for all. Ultimately, this has made Ramsey's goal to infect every
   human
   on the entire
   <a href="Earth.html" key="04902773-7f14-4b55-8892-f71bf8ffc79c" title="Earth">

   and get them to pledge their full loyalty to him.
  </p>
  <p key="2b8baffe-a2fa-4455-8415-ac3316d7415c">
   Ramsey appears to hold life in high regard still. This is evident by his horrified reaction when "
   Kamilla Hwang
   " intentionally killed herself to free him from his cell; he found the act of killing one's self to be unthinkable. To him, choosing to die is an act that makes even him uncomfortable. As such, he seems to justify his killing by both thinking that these people are not intentionally choosing death, and that he is actively choosing to live. Ramsey can view not killing his victims as him purposefully choosing suicide, further establishing his twisted views on life and death
  </p>
  <p key="34ea4861-dd65-4ddc-99dc-b36f6e4b1e17">
   He also seems to still possesses some pride and brilliance, despite his near inhuman state. When the mirror duplicates were explaining who
   Eva McCulloch
   is, Ramsey angrily retorted that he knew who she was because, he too, was a scientist, hinting that he still views his former profession as a prestigious one. His calculating mind also came through, in that, despite being free of his cell, he would never escape
   A.R.G.U.S.
   . Instead, he choose to sit and wait, plotting out another plan.
  </p>
  <p key="194bc113-eb0d-4496-98a1-14eb49cce952">
   Ironically, Ramsey's claim that the Speed Force was using Barry (manipulating him, as Barry said himself) would later be proven correct. Other forces were born alongside the Speed Force's rebirth, and it attempted (and ultimately failed) to manipulate Barry into killing the new Force avatars, justifying its actions as self-defense and cleaning up Barry's mess.

In order to keep himself alive, he needed to feed off of human beings with adrenaline-infused blood. Therefore; he had to put his victims in a state of great fear before he absorbed their blood, killing them in the process.

     Mental instability:
    </b>
    Ramsey's obsession with defeating his impending death defiled his humanity. He eventually came to only care about surviving and nothing else. The more individuals he killed, the more unstable he became.

     Constant movement:
    </b>
    In order for Ramsey to keep as much blood pumping around his body as possible, he needed to be constantly moving. The less he moved and the calmer he was, the weaker he became.

     Photon Gun:
    </b>
    Cisco theorized that his gun could cure Ramsey or kill him and while he used it on him it showed that it could temporarily weaken him and stopped him from using his powers, though it didn't work on Ramsey nearly as well as Cisco had hoped.

     Mental link to Blood Brothers
    </b>
    : Just as Ramsey was able to affect Barry's thinking using a mental link, after being infected by him, Barry was able to do the same to Ramsey. He used an image of Ramsey's mother to distract him long enough so he could lock Ramsey in the
    MAC
    ; the only thing Team Flash was certain would be able to contain him.

     Electromagnetic Waves
    </b>
    : EM waves were crucial in severing Bloodwork's link to both Barry and the other zombies. That weakened him a bit.

     UV rays:
    </b>
    When Ramsey put his blood in the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator to create an explosion that would turn all of Central City into
    Blood Brothers
    , Allegra Garcia releasing her UV rays into the accelerator caused the particle accelerator's explosion to release a wave that cured all the Blood Brothers Ramsey had already infected.

     Cannot Use Simulated Fear Blood
