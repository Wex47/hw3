Oliver wants to go undercover and get close to Frank to figure out what is going on. He says he thinks his sister is right to think he's not being honest, as he can't tell them he's fast enough to nearly catch a motorcycle on foot. His goal now is to protect his family.

   Frank says he wants the building contract for Queen Consolidated's Applied Sciences division as Nick leaves to take a phone call. Moira had obviously been telling him no, but Oliver says he's leaning the other way. The Huntress walks into the room and is introduced as Frank's daughter, Helena. Frank needs to leave for a quick meeting. He has a phone call with Nick and asks Helena to take Oliver out for dinner. She's reluctant, bitterly accusing her father of "pimping out your daughter" and calling Oliver "the rich man's Lindsay Lohan", but after being reminded that the family business is dying, she ultimately agrees.

After they leave, Nick asks his boss what the Chinese Triad would have to gain by coming after him, but Frank says that no one has ever credited the Chinese Triad with rational thinking and arrogantly doesn't think anyone else is powerful enough to threaten him.

   Oliver and Helena are taken to an abandoned warehouse and tied up. Nick tells Helena that he knows that she has betrayed the family, as he found her crucifix at Russo's. Helena reveals she wanted revenge on her father for ordering Michael's death. Nick reveals that Michael was an informant for the FBI, he found his laptop with evidence that would have destroyed the family if the Feds had gotten hold of it. Helena says it was her laptop and denounces her father as a monster. Nick taunts her by revealing that he shot Michael in the heart, his personal calling card, and now he will kill her the same way. Before he can pull the trigger, Oliver breaks free of his restraints and tackles Nick. While Nick staggers to his feet, his goons attack Oliver. Helena breaks free of her own restraints and savagely attacks Nick. As Oliver disposes of his opponents, Nick tells Helena that she will "burn in hell" for what she has done and Helena tells him that it will be worth it, before snapping his neck. When Oliver looks at her questioningly, she replies, "I didn't have a choice, Oliver. No one can know my secret!"
