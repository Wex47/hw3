    Early life

  </h4>
  <p key="d85118c4-66bd-41c1-aea3-cdac722cd68f">
   Cisco was born to
   Mr. Ramon
   and
   Mrs. Ramon
   , and he had an older brother,
   Dante Ramon
   . The two shared a room all throughout high school.
  </p>
  <p key="3f176aab-acfa-4f9b-9bef-0b9dc2641121">
   During Cisco's school years, he met
   Jake Puckett
   , who bullied him by giving him swirlies in the toilet bowl unless Cisco allowed Jake to copy his homework.
   When Dante was 15, he owed a bookie but was unable to pay him back, so Cisco gave him all of the money that he had earned delivering pizzas that year to pay off the debt.
   At some point, Cisco met
   Melinda Tores
   , who he claimed was the love of his life. Melinda actually reciprocated Cisco's crush, but their relationship never became romantic as Dante lied to her about Cisco wanting to become a priest.
  </p>
  <p key="45783857-99b3-4ffd-8395-634f46f7d3cd">
   Cisco collected tech magazines in high school
   and showed interests in mechanics at a young age, but his talent was not recognized nor deemed of importance by his family, as their attention were mostly on Dante. Cisco knew he was being under-appreciated, but it didn't stop his passion and he continued to pursue his dream.
  </p>
  <p key="ab8b04e7-6bc1-4cf3-84f3-d6359d91ef0c">
   While in college, Cisco roomed with
   Sebastian Ollins
   . Cisco would later recall that Sebastian couldn't manage to stay awake through a full physics lecture, and that if not for "his very smart, very considerate college roommate lending him notes, helping him study, he wouldn't have made it through his finals."
  </p>
  <p key="b58a81a5-557f-4a3f-a8a2-fc9b41579151">
   Cisco eventually became employed at
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   under Dr. "

  <p key="73b64fab-0474-4cc2-b315-a51c1cbe47cf">
   During his first year at S.T.A.R. Labs, Cisco became quickly at odds with his co-worker and senior,
   Hartley Rathaway
   . When Dr. Wells introduced Cisco as the newest member of the team, the latter became skeptical of him, namely because of Cisco's penchant for hipster T-shirts. He was the official monkey trainer at S.T.A.R Labs. Hartley was likewise mildly annoyed when Dr. Wells placed Cisco on the same level as him, saying that "I have a good feeling about him, just as I had about you."
  </p>
  <p key="99b18f63-d103-400f-8e0a-946f76112d0c">
   While spending time together, Cisco and Hartley openly expressed their dislike for each other, with Hartley snidely remarking on Cisco's argot and Cisco telling Hartley that if he thought him incompetent then he should try proving it to Wells.
   Caitlin Snow
   introduced herself and intervened in their dispute, offhandedly taunted Hartley at the same time, much to Cisco's appreciation. In order to spite him back, Hartley stated Cisco would not last more than a week at
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   , but was proven wrong.
  </p>
  <p key="be3bdcc5-1021-4923-b98e-32f0fa6ae24f">
   At one point, the team at S.T.A.R. Labs that was working on the
   particle accelerator
   was under a very strict deadline. Cisco, Caitlin, Ronnie, and Hartley were struggling, working late at night on the iridium plating for the synchotron, and they could not get the dubnium capacitor to hold a single charge.
  </p>
  <p key="bd5c102f-33ee-4553-8256-82cb95b1fcc7">
   After Hartley was fired Cisco was highly relieved and hoped never to see him again, and Cisco became close to Dr. Wells, with Wells regarding him as a son. Cisco also becomes close friends with Caitlin and her boyfriend (who was also his fellow engineer)
   Ronnie Raymond
   , both of whom Cisco looked up to and regarded as family.

   After the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator was switched on, it worked for a few minutes before it began to malfunction. Cisco was sent down to the core chamber with Ronnie to shut it down. Once they got down there, Ronnie requested that Cisco put the accelerator on lockdown if he wasn't back within two minutes. He was forced to lock it down, much to his distress and was promptly joined by
   Caitlin Snow
   . They were contacted by Ronnie, who told them of his plan to direct the impending explosion upwards rather than out, and so Cisco had to adjust the particle parameters to compensate for the change. During the particle accelerator's resulting explosion, Ronnie was seemingly killed as the accelerator exploded and produced a blastwave through the city that affected numerous people in Central City and gave them super abilities.
   However without knowing Cisco was also affected.

   . The two were doing an inventory count and discussing the particle accelerator's explosion when they heard movement in the warehouse.

Before the man could reply, he spat blood out and dropped to the ground, with

   , a song he allegedly liked. He called Dr. Wells down to lab as quickly as possible, and explained to Barry what had happened, introducing he and Caitlin. The two took a break as Wells showed Barry around S.T.A.R. Labs, explaining in depth what had actually happened. Later, after discovering that he had the ability to run super fast, the team of four headed down to
   an airfield
   . He had Barry put on a suit of his creation, which would hold up when he ran fast as well allowed them to monitor his vitals and energy output. He stood back, holding a radar speed gun, as Barry raced off, knocking over Cisco. He continued to monitor his speed before he tripped over into barrels of water. They headed back to S.T.A.R.

   for lying to him in regards to meta-human abilities. Cisco found the idea of controlling the weather cool, but Barry guaranteed that it wasn't cool, as it had caused a murder. Barry returned later, offering an apology in return for Cisco and Caitlin's help in catching rogue meta-humans. They agreed to help, and Cisco revealed a suit he'd designed for use by firefighters, which he believed would suit Barry's purposes well. Barry donned the suit and headed out to where they pinpointed Clyde to be. Cisco and Caitlin communicated with Barry, giving support. When Barry began to attempt to unravel it, Cisco stated his belief that Barry could withstand the pressure, which he eventually did.

   After a run-in with a strongman at the
   Central City National Bank
   , Barry arrived back at
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   with a wrongly-healed ankle, after having previously broken it. They decided to re-break it, and Cisco did it as quickly as possible. Following that, Cisco and Caitlin tagged along with Barry to grab some DNA samples from the crime scene at which the strongman had been.
   While analyzing the sample, they helped Barry find a group of chimpanzees that had escaped from the
   Central City Zoo
   . As he locked them up, they revealed that the DNA sample was that of
   Joey Rose
   , a former strongman at the
   Central City Circus
   . They delved deeper into the closed circus, discovering that its owner had escaped from
   Belle Reve
   and killed several people.
   They notified Barry of this, while Dr.

   also provided some details he knew on Mr. Bliss from having attended the circus previously, and Barry left to find the circus.
   Having been gone for a while, Cisco and Caitlin took a truck and crashed through the tent of the circus. Cisco grabbed Barry and Caitlin attempted to drive away, however, their truck was lifted up by Joey Rose, who threw it some distance from the tent. As they crawled from the wreckage, they encountered the snake lady. The lady promised to let them pass, but Caitlin believed it to be a trap. The lady assured her that she was genuine, as they were only compliant to Mr. Bliss otherwise torture would be inflicted upon them. Before leaving, Caitlin asked what all of it was about, but the woman was only aware that something big was happening. They headed back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Caitlin explained what had happened to Barry and Cisco further explained what the snake lady had told them.
   Caitlin suggested that she could experiment with psychotropic drugs on Barry, though she was unsure how he would react. Cisco noticed that Mr. Bliss had arrived at a
   Central City Cougars
   match, so Dr.

   urged that they go down to warn everyone. Having destroyed the work van, they took Cisco's car, which Caitlin found unhygienic and rather small.
   As they arrived, they noticed that the Flash had already evacuated everyone. Iris greeted them and Cisco claimed that they were there for the circus.

   Cisco directed Barry to a burning building to save people inside. Midway through, Caitlin walked in, causing Cisco to shut the computers off quickly. Caitlin realized what they were doing and after Barry had saved everyone and returned to S.T.A.R. Labs. Cisco explained how he was the "eyes and ears" and Barry was "the feet". He queried Barry about his vitals randomly spiking during their escapade, though the latter claimed to be perfectly fine. After later fainting due to using his super speed, Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, where they monitored him. Caitlin got angry at Barry, which Cisco claimed had only happened at such a level since
   Ronnie Raymond
   , her late fiancé. Wishing to see why he kept fainting, Cisco modified a
   treadmill
   to fit Barry's needs. They had him gradually work up his speed while monitoring his vitals, before they noted his glucose levels, causing him to faint. When he woke up, they explained that he had acute hypoglycemia and he wasn't eating enough to keep up with his accelerated metabolism. Cisco had determined that he needed to eat the equivalent of 850 tacos (though figured that it would be different for cheese and guacamole tacos.)

   promptly arrived and Cisco watched on as they argued, Barry claiming that Joe had no control over him. Later, after a run-in with another meta-human,
   Danton Black
   , and his many clones, Cisco was annoyed that Barry had gotten blood on the suit, which he'd made. However, Barry reasoned that some of the blood was Black's, leading to Cisco nicknaming him "Captain Clone", though no one seemed to like the name. They gathered some more of the blood and Caitlin was able to trigger the replicating process in Danton's cells, making an entirely new clone. They were able to guess that it was acting as a kind of "receiver", hence why it wasn't immediately attacking them. Suggesting that Barry should go after Danton, Cisco presented Barry with a high-calorie protein bar to keep his metabolism in check. When he was in the field, the team provided support as per usual for Barry. Following Danton's ultimate death, they watched it on the news, Cisco expressed that "Multiplex", as he renamed him, couldn't hurt anyone else. Barry assured that the three of them were always with him, and that really all of them had been struck by lightning, not just Barry, at least in the metaphorical sense.

   A while later, Cisco alerted Barry to a man with a gun in a getaway car being chased by cops, who Barry sped to and placed in the cop car within a matter of seconds. The following day, after the Darbinyan crime family were gassed to death by a presumed meta-human, the S.T.A.R. Labs team began researching what they could, all of them excited by the potential prospects. Joe noted that they would have to find somewhere to hold them, as

   </a>
   went down to the particle accelerator's core chamber, where Cisco had a hard time being due to the former night's events. They headed back up, Cisco keen to leave the area. The two of them assisted Barry after he went after the gaseous meta-human, pinpointing his location. Barry soon inhaled some of the man's toxic fumes and was forced to race back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where they extracted the gas for sampling. As Barry woke up, they discussed being able to find the meta-human's identity, whereupon Cisco instead nicknamed him The Mist. Cisco and

   </a>
   went on to identify the gas, noting that although it was hydrogen cyanide, it had traces of a sedative (specifically that used on death row inmates before execution). They identified the meta-human,
   Kyle Nimbus
   , and his next target,

    Joe West

   . As Barry sped to Iron Heights, where Joe was visiting, Cisco offered to help Barry break in, though Barry claimed to have known how to since age 11. Barry eventually beat The Mist, capturing him, and they put him in their makeshift particle accelerator prison. Caitlin was skeptical that the prison would hold, though Cisco was certain that it would, as it had a super-conductor 100,000 times the strength of Earth's magnetic field. As Dr. Wells left, Cisco attempted to apologize for the night of Ronnie's death, however, Caitlin admitted that she was okay, as she was even more proud of Ronnie. The two headed out to the movies, followed by ice cream.

   Cisco played table tennis with Barry as Barry was also playing a game of operation with Caitlin and a game of chess with Wells to which Cisco lost. Soon after, they were alerted of a bank robbery by
   Leonard Snart
   . Later when Felicity visited the team, he learned that Barry knew who The Arrow was, which he found sweet. Cisco was later yelled at by Wells, who was furious Cisco built the cold gun, a weapon powerful enough to even harm Barry, despite his speed. Cisco later revealed he built the gun in fear Barry would become a psycho like the other meta-humans. Cisco managed to find a way to track down Snart by using triangulation though Felicity intervened as she managed to track him down in under a minute, as opposed to Cisco who claimed it would take half an hour. When Barry decided to take down Snart by also turning off his communications, Cisco along with Caitlin was told by Felicity that they should help Barry, despite his orders. Cisco, Caitlin, and Felicity later arrived with the S.T.A.R. Labs vacuum cleaner, claiming to Snart that it was the prototype cold gun, to threaten him to leave. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Wells told Cisco never to create such a weapon again.

    Caitlin
    and Barry quickly dismissed Bridge's suspicions. Despite this, after developing a
   device
   capable of helping Team Flash stop
    Mark Mardon
    , Cisco explored the claim further, having realized that there was no reason the "Man in Yellow" should have escaped the containment field in December. He began running several tests on the field to determine the root cause of its failure while requesting that Caitlin keep Wells at bay. He eventually realized that the "Man in Yellow" that they saw in December was indeed a holographic image, and the man's encounter with Wells was recorded beforehand. Just as he arrived at this conclusion, Wells appeared and confronted Cisco, revealing his true identity as Eobard Thawne and the Reverse-Flash.

   As a terrified and tearful Cisco questioned Thawne on why he murdered
    Nora Allen
    in 2000. Thawne explained that he was not there to kill Nora. Rather, he was there to kill Barry, and he was from the future, having been trapped in the past for 15 years. When Cisco asked why Thawne helped Barry for so long, Thawne explained that he needed Barry to get faster as a "means to an end." Finally, Thawne revealed that he created a speed mirage in December, which is what caused the team to see both the Reverse-Flash and "Wells" as different people. With Cisco having discovered his secret, Thawne revealed that his only option was to kill Cisco. As he pleaded for his life and claimed that he would be able to help Thawne get to his own time, Thawne disagreed, saying that he was smart but not that smart. As Cisco tearfully watched Thawne vibrate his hand, the latter revealed that he viewed Cisco as a surrogate son before phasing through Cisco's heart, killing him.

   After some time, reporter Mason Bridge began to believe that Wells was hiding something, but couldn't confide his suspicions in Iris West due to Barry's interference. As such, no information was relayed to Team Flash, and Cisco would never explore the containment field failure. After Barry captured Mardon earlier than the original timeline, Cisco was forced to attend his brother
    Dante
    's birthday party, where he grew bitter after realizing that Dante hadn't changed over the years and he was still considered the better sibling by their parents. Storming out of the party in exasperation, he went to a nearby bar where he was lured by

   and himself respectively, to which Cisco refused but later relented after seeing that the two had captured Dante as well. After developing the two guns, Leonard saw through Cisco's initial deception, noticing that he had tampered with the firing pin. He was then told to make
    a gun
    for Lisa as well with gold. After doing so, Cisco continued to be held captive with Dante, upon which the latter revealed that his high-school girlfriend
    Melinda Tores
    reciprocated Cisco's crush for her, much to Cisco's shock. Dante then revealed his own insecurities and how Cisco had the power to pursue his passion while Dante was too afraid to even attempt to do so. Having had enough of his failures, Dante attempted to break free and attack Rory along with Cisco but was stopped by Lisa and Leonard. Leonard proceeded to demand that Cisco reveal the identity of the Flash in exchange for his and Dante's freedom. Despite his insistence that he didn't know who the Flash was, Cisco eventually gave up Barry's secret identity after Leonard froze Dante's hands, causing him immense pain, and threatened to do much worse.

   As promised, Leonard let Dante and Cisco go, with the latter returning to
    S.T.A.R. Labs
    feeling that he betrayed the team. As he tearfully explained the circumstances of his return, Barry explained that it was his fault Cisco was in that position. Despite this, Cisco prepared to pack his belongings and leave Team Flash, feeling that he no longer deserved to be there. However, Wells pulled him aside, explaining that Cisco was forced to make the most difficult choice between two loved ones and that he didn't make a mistake. Wells explained that Team Flash loved him as well and he himself viewed Cisco as a surrogate son, convincing Cisco to stay.

Although Caitlin immediately dismissed the claim, Cisco explained that he was having dreams where Wells revealed his identity as the Reverse-Flash and killed him. Unbeknownst to Cisco, the "dream" he was having was a trace of the original timeline before it was reset by Barry.

   Tess Morgan
   died. As Cisco checked the site, he noticed some abnormal activity and dug up a rotting corpse, much to his disgust and shock. They later relocated the body and, with Caitlin and Barry, worked to identify who the body belonged to, before realizing that, to their horror, the DNA matched that of the true
    Harrison Wells
    . Suddenly confused as to who they were working under for so long, Cisco and the rest of Team Flash, with Caitlin now convinced, began working to uncover the truth of the Reverse-Flash.

  <p key="154b4a9d-ddf6-4ef9-b476-1ed7e2b0000b">
   Cisco later explored the
    S.T.A.R. Labs
    schematics where he noticed a
    room
    that wasn't supposed to exist. As Barry, Caitlin, and Cisco worked to find the room, Cisco noticed an increase in tachyonic particles emanating from one location, which they later discovered was the location of said hidden room, known as the Time Vault. As they entered, they noticed the
   Reverse-Flash suit
   and Wells' newspaper of the

   spoke, unsettling Cisco somewhat. After Gideon explained that she knew who Barry was, they realized that they needed to disable Gideon's memory core to prevent her from telling Wells of the encounter. Cisco initially volunteered but refused after Gideon revealed her memory core's location. Barry then asked Gideon to not tell Wells of the encounter and was surprised when she accepted the command, revealing that Barry would create her in the future. With Wells nearby, Barry sped Caitlin and Cisco out of the time vault before Wells took notice.
  </p>
  <p key="65691059-a6a5-4bb9-bbd3-7d38dc21df6a">
   Finding it necessary to explore his "dream" further in order to trap Wells, and having realized that the "dream" was, in fact, the events of the original timeline, Cisco, along with Caitlin, developed
    special glasses
    to help induce Cisco into a lucid dreaming state where he could guide Team Flash as to what was going on. After completing work on the glasses, Cisco met with Barry, Joe, and Caitlin and prepared to enter the dream where he was murdered by Wells. As he entered his dream, Cisco recounted the events of the original timeline, explaining to
   <a href="Team Flash.html" key="fa8ecede-6822-4e24-a197-4c5ec1318951" title="Team Flash">
    Team Flash
   </a>
   that he thought that Wells had tampered with his work and he needed to make sure. Cisco soon realized that the Reverse-Flash they encountered in December was a hologram before Dream-Wells appeared and confronted him just as he had in the original timeline. Cisco explained Dream-Wells had revealed his identity as Eobard Thawne, as Joe drew the similarity between the last names of him and
    Eddie
    . Cisco proceeded to confirm that Eobard had killed
    Nora
    but intended to kill Barry. As Dream-Eobard prepared to kill Cisco in the dream, Cisco began to convulse in the real world with his blood pressure dropping, prompting Team Flash to desperately find a way to return Cisco to the real world as Caitlin repeatedly assured him that his experiences weren't real. Just as Dream-Eobard killed Cisco in the dream, Team Flash recovered him and safely returned Cisco to the real world.
  </p>
  <p key="6c17611c-f5b3-4086-94e0-ece1b0486171">
   Now knowing how to bait Eobard, Team Flash decided to recreate the exact same circumstances in the dream to get him to confess to Nora's murder, but with extra protection for Cisco. In order to do this, Cisco reversed the speedster trap they concocted in December to prevent a speedster from getting in, rather than preventing them from getting out, before successfully testing it on Barry. With their plan ready, Cisco waited for Eobard to return to S.T.A.R. Labs before setting off the Reverse-Flash hologram to set the events of his dream in motion. As Joe and Barry hid in the back of the bunker, Cisco was confronted by Eobard, who claimed that Cisco was clever. As Cisco attempted to weed out a confession of Nora's murder, Eobard dodged the advances and simply said that Nora had been dead for centuries, which wasn't a real confession. As Eobard raised his hand in preparation to kill Cisco, he activated the speedster trap, but Eobard was able to enter it nonetheless, much to Team Flash's shock. As Eobard advanced on Cisco, Joe, without thinking, shot several bullets at Eobard. As Barry desperately attempted to stop the bullets, he was unable to stop the last one due to the speedster trap and it hit Eobard, seemingly killing him. As Cisco claimed that he would never sleep again, a devastated Barry explained that since Nora's true killer was dead, his
    father
    would remain in prison forever. Just then, however, Cisco noticed that Eobard's corpse morphed into
    Hannibal Bates
    , as the real Eobard, alive and far away from S.T.A.R. Labs, spoke over the speakers, revealing that Bates had impersonated him the whole time and reintroducing Bates' ability to morph into anyone he touched. Cisco listened as Eobard explained how he used Bates for his own purpose, enraging Barry. As Barry taunted Eobard to face him, Eobard said that the two would face again. Receiving an alert on his phone, Cisco told Barry that Eobard was in the time vault as Barry ran off in pursuit.
  </p>
  <p key="470bae15-c509-42fc-9e10-055b93e5cc9c">
   After Eobard kidnapped
    Eddie Thawne
    , Cisco and Team Flash worked to locate the two but to no avail. Cisco later began to look into
    Eobard's wheelchair
    , realizing that Eobard must have used it for some other reason besides diverting suspicion to his Reverse-Flash identity. Cisco later found a power source located on its underside and deduced that Eobard was using it to charge his speed, thus ensuring that he was faster than Barry at all times. After he revealed his findings to Barry, Caitlin, and Joe, Cisco was alerted to the
    particle accelerator
    's reactivation, much to his shock. Barry suspected that Eobard was in S.T.A.R. Labs all the while, which was why the team failed to locate him earlier when they were searching throughout the city. Cisco, Barry, and Joe went to the pipeline to confirm Barry's suspicions, with Cisco bringing his drink along as it could alert them to Eobard's presence. As the three opened the pipeline door, Cisco noticed his drink float in the air, indeed confirming Eobard's presence, before the Reverse-Flash raced out of the pipeline and out of S.T.A.R. Labs. As Barry ran off in pursuit, Cisco and Joe watched as
   Shawna Baez
   escaped her meta-human containment cell. Despite their efforts to subdue Baez, she was able to utilize her powers to escape and trap Cisco and Joe in the pipeline before fighting Caitlin, although Iris was able to knock Baez out and save Caitlin in time.
  </p>
  <p key="22d1983e-b370-4605-b22a-195d166fb45b">
   After Baez was returned to her cell, Joe noticed a faint voice from within the pipeline. Realizing that the voice was Eddie's weakened shouts for help, Joe and Iris were able to rescue him. While Eddie recovered, he revealed to Team Flash that Eobard had revealed his identity, just as he had in Cisco's "dream," and said that the two were family. He explained that Eobard was working on a futuristic, metallic tube and that it was the "key" to Eobard regaining everything he lost, although he didn't know much else. After Caitlin allowed Eddie to return home and rest, Cisco received another alert, revealing the "key" Eddie was talking about: a device plugged directly into the particle accelerator. After Barry asked Cisco if he could disarm the device, Cisco explained that since the device was from the future, he couldn't tamper with it without running the risk of destroying the building. Cisco speculated that the device would be fully operational in 36 hours, as Barry realized that Eobard would return to S.T.A.R. Labs then.

   With hours before the particle accelerator turned on and killed all the meta-human prisoners in the pipeline, Barry proposed that Team Flash relocate them to

   to help in transporting the meta-humans, Cisco fit energy dampers into his uncle's frozen food truck using the rig's cooling mechanisms and Eobard's power source, as the truck was big enough to support all the prisoners that needed to be transferred. With their plan ready, Caitlin rendered the prisoners unconscious and Team Flash relocated them to the truck. Cisco followed the convoy as they drove to the
    Ferris Air Testing Facility
    , although before their plan was a success, Leonard sabotaged the truck, allowing the prisoners to escape with their powers. As
   Rainbow Raider
   used his powers on Caitlin, she succumbed to its effects and attacked Cisco, blaming him for the "death" of
   Ronnie
   during the particle accelerator explosion. Shortly afterward, after Leonard and Lisa made their escape, Cisco ran to an injured Barry and ensured that he was okay.

   at once, culminating in Eobard's defeat as Oliver shot an arrow into him and rendered him unconscious. Team Flash later imprisoned Eobard in the pipeline.
  </p>
  <p key="7f57de48-1f38-4a0f-b26b-6196f9d7fe4f">
   While imprisoned, Eobard explained his plan, which was to have Barry run fast enough to create a wormhole for Eobard to travel through to return to his own time, while Barry could have the chance to go back and save his mother. While Barry considered the offer,
    Professor Stein
    pointed out the risks, as saving Nora could mean Barry would never meet Cisco, Caitlin or Ronnie. When Barry decided to go through with the plan, he asked Cisco to help him built a time machine for Eobard, as Eobard's speed, though faster than Barry's, was unreliable, proving Cisco's theory about his wheelchair "charging" him.
  </p>
  <p key="043e6d2c-cf11-417d-bb2c-746b6a07ccfd">
   When Cisco and Ronnie discovered some of the materials were insufficient, Cisco gave the plans for the
    Time Sphere
    to Eobard to examine and asked how he fitted his
   Reverse-Flash suit
   into
    his ring
    . Eobard, however, was more focused on the Time Sphere and told Cisco the correct materials but Eobard expressed annoyance that he was unconcerned about his fate, believing Cisco would be more understanding. Instead, Cisco told Eobard about him murdering him in an alternate timeline which he kept remembering, and remembered how Eobard regarded him as a son and killed him. Eobard apologized, not for killing Cisco; justifying that he must have had a good reason, but that Cisco can remember alternate timelines, meaning he can see through the vibrations of the universe, confirming what he has suspected for some time now: when the accelerator exploded, Cisco was affected too.
  </p>
  <p key="44c56f3b-3b40-4d3c-8ed7-5fe8250421d0">
   Cisco denied Eobard's claim but he assured Cisco that a "grant and honorable" destiny awaits him but hopes that one day he'll remember who gave him that gift and that it was out of love. Cisco later presented the rings at Ronnie and Caitlin's wedding. Before Barry went back in time, Cisco reminded him there would be three of him back there - the current him, the future him and the younger him - and told him to wait until young him was gone. Cisco and Joe oversaw Eobard preparing to leave in the Time Sphere, but before he could go, Flash returned and destroyed the pod, stranding Reverse-Flash there and they fought. While Reverse-Flash had Flash subdued, he prepared to kill him only for Eddie to shoot himself in the heart, causing Eobard to start fading away. Cisco realized that if Eddie dies then Eobard will never be born and he was being erased from existence. Cisco watched Eddie die in Iris' arms as Eobard faded into nothing.

   However, as Professor Stein warned, Barry's time-traveling formed a singularity that started to consume the city. Flash took off into the portal to stop it and ran around the inner ring, preventing it from opening further.
    However, Ronnie and Professor Stein were forced to close the portal by separating as Firestorm within it to unleash their power. They did so, but Ronnie was lost in the explosion and presumed dead; leaving the team to deal with the loss of both Eddie and Ronnie.

  <p key="0957d066-8617-4b43-9248-8ec71b61d6da">
   Cisco later attended the ceremony with Joe and found Caitlin there, much to his surprise. As the city prepared to honor The Flash, Barry appeared, pleasing Cisco and Joe that he changed his mind. However, shortly afterward, the ceremony fell under attack to another
   meta-human
   . During their efforts to stop him, Cisco had a vision of the man speaking with an

    B.O.O.T.
    in an effort to capture him. However, the device didn't affect the attacker at all, as he was able to use his powers and grow in size. Joe then urged Cisco to run as he and Barry worked to hold him back, successfully doing so as the attacker revealed his face and escaped before doing further harm.
  </p>
  <p key="c153ff5d-8c86-4f16-a08e-4f8d65200496">
   Cisco then worked with Joe to identify the attacker, after the latter explained that he looked just like a dead man named
   Al Rothstein
   that they had found at a nuclear plant just days before. However, much to the two's shock, Rothstein wasn't in
    Central City
    during the night of the
    particle accelerator
    explosion and thus couldn't be a meta-human, nor did he have any twin siblings. In order to subdue the attacker, Cisco, Joe,
    Iris
    , and
    Martin Stein
    returned to
    S.T.A.R. Labs
    and refused to let Barry stop Rothstein alone, much to the former's dismay. Cisco later informed Barry that they had determined Rothstein's location, upon which Barry ran off to stop him while leaving his communication headsets behind, insisting on accomplishing the task without Cisco's guidance. Despite Barry's resistance, he later saw reason after he was attacked and nearly killed by Rothstein and agreed to revive Team Flash, much to Cisco's relief, and brought Caitlin back from Mercury Labs. With the team's help, Barry was able to subdue Rothstein by trapping and flooding him with radiation in a closed-off chamber. As Rothstein succumbed to the radiation's effects and began to die, Barry asked him why he wanted to kill The Flash, to which he replied that

Despite his reluctance in crime-fighting, Cisco was convinced by Barry to join the effort to stop the Rival after the latter revealed that he had time-traveled and altered his past, unknowingly changing Cisco's fate in the process. Cisco helped Barry and
    Wally West/The Flash

   Rainbow Raider
   robbed a bank, so Cisco told Barry and Caitlin that he would help them take her down as a part of their last mission together.

     Cisco is a kind, caring, intelligent, and laid-back young man, who often at first glance seems unable to take things seriously.  However, he has often proven to be surprisingly focused when it comes to helping Barry fight against crime. It's apparent that Cisco is a nerd in many of the conventional ways. He has a clear love of comics, sci-fi, and pop culture, and is very excited to see such concepts made real for him, such as witnessing super-powers from assorted meta-humans, in particular, Barry and his super-speed. His love of comic characters has driven Cisco to often come up with names for Barry's assorted Rogues Gallery, such as
      Captain Cold
      . Cisco has great pride in his tech to the point of being extremely protective of it, such as becoming angry when Barry told him that his Flash suit was destroyed by
      Bette Sans Souci
      . Cisco is also a very careful planner as he invented

      Earth-2

     Cisco loved his brother, Dante, very much despite his jealousy and annoyance of him due to his family favoring him. He was willing to divulge the identity of the Flash to
      Leonard Snart
      in exchange that he kept Dante alive. After seeing

    <p key="d23b0e24-2ca9-4c15-ac16-d30388f947cc">
     As a result, Cisco acted cold and depressed toward Barry. Cisco eventually recovered from this state of mind due to Iris explaining that everyone makes mistakes and when he was able to save Barry from
     the Rival
     , not willing to lose another friend. He seemingly returned to his cheerful demeanor, but his wounds were reopened once
     Killer Frost
     revealed that Dante potentially died as a result of

      Flashpoint
     </a>
     , which was Barry's doing. Cisco refused to acknowledge the possibility that Dante's death would have happened regardless of Barry's actions and he let Barry know that their friendship may never return to how it used to be. However, after saving one of the
      Dominators
      back in 1951 and causing the truce between the NSA and the Dominators to never happen, Cisco realized that he cannot remain angry at Barry because he understood, after doing it himself, that altering the past in any way can have unforeseen consequences. Cisco later helped the team stop Barry from surrendering to the Dominators and forgave him by calling him his friend again.

    When Harry came up with a plan to match
     DeVoe
     's intelligence, Cisco arrogantly and repeatedly refused, telling Harry that he would only kill himself, or end up like DeVoe despite the fact that Harry was trying to stop DeVoe, who had already obtained powers from the bus metas he murdered, with no other viable option. Despite this, Cisco's concerns can be well-founded and justified at times, such as when Harry ended up causing the deterioration of his own brain after using the Thinking Cap with infused
     dark matter
     , something Harry admitted Cisco warned him against.

    Despite this, 2017 Barry changed Cisco's mind and was able to reunite Team Flash once more, bringing joy to Cisco for the first time in a while. This future was later erased when Savitar killed H.R. instead of Iris; albeit by accident.

        As stated to Cisco by both Reverb and Gypsy, "vibers" are connected by their powers and are able to observe each other if they're skilled enough. Reverb used this to track Cisco's progress with his powers from Earth-2, and Gypsy used it to find and rescue him from Savitar right as Killer Frost was about to execute him. Cisco, as of yet hasn't mastered the use of his powers well enough to do this at will, although it's possible that Cisco's visions of Thawne killing him were a result of him subconsciously using it to connect to an alternate version of himself.

     Injured hands:
    </b>
    Cisco's ability to access his dimensional powers and project dimensional energy is primarily channeled through his hands. He is, however, able to access visions without the use of his hands, like the foreshadowed possible destruction of Earth-2 and the Multiverse, which was averted, but it's much more unstable and harder to read. This is demonstrated by Cisco Ramon's alternate 2024 self, whose hands were shattered by Killer Frost in their fight, and replaced with bionic hands, mentioning he can no longer access his powers, but was able to sense 2017 Barry's arrival in 2024.
     Also, as shown when Cisco's hands got cut by Cicada's dagger, injuries to Cisco's hands still keep him from vibing as well as he usually would.

     Temporal alterations:

    Cisco's new-found connection to reality also puts him at a disadvantage to extreme time alterations. Deeper changes in the natural events of time can cause a strain on his body, one of the earliest signs being a bloody nose. The longer these deep changes remain unresolved, the worse Cisco's condition will get. Ultimately, he gets a brain hemorrhage before going into cardiac arrest. His body will then become transparent and distorted, as the time rupture begins to tear him apart. Only restoring the proper events will stabilize Cisco.
