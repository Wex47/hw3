    Early life

  <p key="ea6707ec-3efa-4471-b99a-71b9552486c0">
   Mari was born to
   Esi
   and an
   unnamed man
   in 1992 in the
   Zambesi Village
   , located in the M'Changa Province of
   Zambesi
   . She had an older sister,
   Kuasa
   . When Mari was still a baby, a local warlord,
   Benatu Eshu
   , attacked her village in his hunt for the totems of power. However, Esi took Mari to safety, along with the
   Anansi Totem
   .
  </p>
  <p key="e75eb2f4-c772-48cd-b4a4-0d9913f23115">
   Mari was eventually placed at an orphanage in
   Detroit
   ,
   Michigan
   and adopted by
   Chuck
   and
   Patty McCabe
   , who raised her as their daughter, giving her the name "Mari McCabe."
  </p>
  <p key="e9e54023-2abb-4976-85f9-2aabfa056e06">
   When Mari was 10 years old, she came home from school crying, having been bullied. Mari confided in her adoptive mother that some mean girls claimed her biological mother was a "junkie" and abandoned her. Patty promised her it wasn't true but couldn't offer up much information on Mari's birth family. In hopes that Mari could gain some answers, Patty gave her
   a necklace
   which belonged to her mother.
  </p>
  <p key="fcac049c-ae05-46a3-81c3-e6558cd43dee">
   As Mari grew up, she became interested in fashion design but was always haunted by her lack of knowledge of her own past. In 2011,
   she left Detroit and started searching around the world for any clues about who her real parents were, using the background of her necklace as an aid.

  <p key="2ce68ddc-1467-4d3b-a8ce-7aec1b773b68">
   After four years in search of her origins, Mari, finding nothing, returned to Detroit.
   Looking for work in fashion design, Mari went for a job interview, but the potential employer claimed that her work "lacks identity" and instead offered her a job in return for giving him "a job". Angered, Mari stabbed the man in the hand with a pen and was subsequently thrown in jail.
  </p>
  <p key="776229ad-4615-48d9-b55c-8463fac09bbd">
   Shortly afterwards, Mari was released after her bail was posted. As she collected her possessions, one of the guards complimented Mari's
   necklace
   and offered to buy it from her as a birthday present for his wife but she refused, citing that it was a family heirloom. Afterwards, Mari met with her foster father,
   Chuck
   , and realized he posted her bail. The two went out for dinner as they caught up. While walking home, the duo were quickly jumped by some thugs, who knocked out Chuck and held Mari at gunpoint, with the ringleader demanding her necklace.
   Terrified, Mari touched her necklace and suddenly harnessed incredible strength. She quickly took out all the thugs, much to her shock. Back home, Mari looked through her childhood photos as she pondered the truth about her necklace.
  </p>
  <p key="4a97474b-e6a9-49ac-b675-0a920e68889a">
   Sometime later, Mari went to inquire with Dr.
   Adam Macalester
   , a professor at Detroit University. Macalester believed her necklace could be the fabled
   Anansi Totem
   and told Mari of its origin, which she already knew. Mari explained some strange phenomenons have been happening to her and she hoped the totem could give clues as to why. Macalester further explained the legend behind the Anansi Totem in which one could harness the "ashe" - spirit - of the animal kingdom and use their powers.
  </p>
  <p key="806a8714-9c26-43b5-9253-48f9fda55e94">
   That night, Mari told Chuck that she believed her necklace was magical, proving it by using the spirit of an elephant to lift a table. Outside, Mari used the spirit of a spider to walk on the walls of house to the roof, where she nearly jumped off, but stopped at the last minute. Back inside, Mari shared her belief that the Anansi Totem could be the key to learning about her past. Just then,

    the Arrow

   showed up, wanting to talk to Mari. Thrown off, Mari panicked and tapped into her necklace before running off, with the two in pursuit.
  </p>
  <p key="0dad6582-107e-4731-b70d-898f738b1245">
   The Flash and Arrow chased Mari throughout the city. The Flash tried to talk to her, but Mari believed he intended to arrest her and used super strength to push the speedster back. Eventually, the Arrow shot a net
   trick arrow
   at Mari, causing her to fall off a building and plummet towards the ground. However, Mari managed to tap into her totem to gain the ability to fly from an eagle. As she flew off, the Arrow reiterated they just wanted to talk to her and Mari flew down towards the two. The two vigilantes spoke of her as a
   meta-human
   , though Mari claimed she wasn't in
   Central City
   at the time of the
   S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator
   explosion. The Arrow had

   check her alibi and the latter confirmed Mari was in Detroit that night from a credit card payment at
   Big Belly Burger
   . Mari explained her powers came from magic and requested the two heroes to stay out of her business. The Arrow and Flash offered to help Mari, but she refused and warned the two that if they came to Chuck's house again, they would "get a really good idea of what it's like to be disemboweled by a lion". She then flew away.
  </p>
  <p key="d83444f6-f038-49f1-9cf7-72f67708e3f9">
   Mari went back to visit Macalester, wanting to know more about her connection to the Anansi Totem. When Macalester asked her why she thought he could help, Mari tapped into the totem to camouflage, proving its magical powers. Macalester then apologized, much to Mari's confusion. Suddenly, a woman named
   Kuasa
   burst in with two armed men, ordering Mari to hand over the totem.
   Stressed and confused, Mari quickly agreed if Kuasa told her where it came from. However, she was unable to take the Anansi Totem off her neck, as it had bound itself to her. Kuasa then ordered her men to kill Mari. Mari attempted to run away, but was shot in the shoulder as she leapt off a building and fell unconscious.

   Whan Mari woke up, she met Kuasa again, whom she learned is in fact her older sister. Kuasa revealed to Mari they were in the ruins of the
   Zambesi Village
   , their home. Kuasa explained the Anansi Totem was created by
   Anansi
   to protect
   Zambesi
   and had been handed down from generations. Kuasa was to be the totem's next guardian, but a
   local warlord
   razed the village and massacred its inhabitants, including
   their father
   . Mari was taken to safety by
   their mother
   with the Anansi Totem. Kuasa claimed it was still her obligation to protect the village, but a heartbroken Mari pointed out there was nothing left to protect. Mari learned the Anansi Totem came to life and bonded to her because it sensed Kuasa, which prevented the latter from claiming the totem. Mari tried to escape but was restrained by Kuasa's men. Kuasa had a spider, Anansi's true form, bite Mari to sever the connection between her and the totem. The Anansi Totem then activated and Mari used the spirit of a rhino to knock Kuasa's guards away and flee. Not long after though, she passed out from the spider venom. Kuasa then caught up to Mari and took the necklace.
  </p>
  <p key="2e25332e-f45a-4093-9ab7-4544b2cc9a01">
   Mari awoke with a herd of animals surrounding her. A lion spirit told Mari that her mother left to keep the totem away from Kuasa due to the darkness inside her. The animals then told Mari they would stand with her if she stood with them, encouraging her to embrace her powers. The spirits of Mari's birth family and adoptive mother appeared to her.
  </p>
  <p key="8b37593d-2037-4dc6-b633-3e47f3084b11">
   Strengthened, Mari confronted Kuasa with help from animal spirits. Mari sent the animals to go after Kuasa's followers while she challenged Kuasa. As Kuasa tried to attack her, Mari threw a spear at Kuasa's arm, drawing blood. She then had Anansi bite Kuasa on her wound, as the effects of the spider venom were stronger when directly exposed to the bloodstream. Mari stated the Anansi Totem belonged to both of them and their family, before knocking Kuasa out and reclaiming the totem.
  </p>
  <p key="8341b52d-db1a-444d-8ec3-2629da24a96b">
   Once returning to Detroit, Mari began superheroism. She informed Chuck of her desire to protect the city, which was her "village". The two embraced, with Mari finally telling Chuck, "I love you, Dad".
  </p>
  <p key="5b09a220-63b7-4b34-8baf-1edb7f90ef9e">
   Outside, Mari encountered the Flash and the Arrow once again, to whom she reiterated her previous warning. The Flash assured Mari they weren't going to hurt her while the Arrow pointed out she needed proper training if she is to take up being a superhero. Mari asked for a chance to figure things on her own first. The two heroes agreed and wished Mari luck. Mari asked for a codename, where the Flash revealed that
   Cisco Ramon
   had been calling her "Vixen".

  <p key="602b4c82-cf0d-4a66-8bff-98db9f7cae93">
   A few months into her crime-fighting career, Mari started having trouble controlling the powers of the animals she summoned. Chuck advised her to go to an animal behaviorist he knew named
   Lena Vargas
   at the Detroit Zoo. Getting a job at the zoo Mari was given the job of looking after an ape named
   Caesar
   who she began to bond with. One day, Mari came upon Vargas being shaken down by a gang. Once they left, Vargas revealed they were smugglers who wanted to use her zoo to sell endangered species on the black market. Vargas also revealed she could not go to the police, as she herself had used dubious legal means to get animals like Caesar to safety in the United States. Mari assured Vargas she could help, revealing her powers. Mari confided in Vargas the trouble she was having with controlling the animal spirits she summons. However, Vargas explained that it wasn't about controlling, but instead embracing the animals' raw power and natural instincts and trust them to see her through. Mari then had Vargas set up a meeting where with the help of Caesar, she was able to defeat the smugglers and have them arrested.

  <p key="613e6b93-3579-4cc1-90ea-1635d1522a9a">
   Sometime later after stopping a bank robbery, Mari saw on the news that Macalester had returned from a year-long archeological expedition in
   Africa
   . Mari confronted Macalester after he finished his presentation
   Fire Totem
   of Zambesi to the
   Detroit Museum of Natural History
   . Macalester apologized, claiming that Kuasa's money for his expedition blinded him to aid Kuasa's evil intentions. He then suggested that with Mari possessing the Spirit Totem, and the Fire Totem recently discovered, they could learn so much more. Mari refused, however, and was contacted by Cisco. He told her that
   Weather Wizard
   was trying to destroy
   Monument Point
   , and so they required everyone's assistance, including her own. Vixen soon arrived at Monument Point, along with

   Firestorm

   Martin Stein
   and
   Jefferson Jackson
   . Mari proceeded to attack Mardon, but was incapacitated when he blasted her with a bolt of lightning and knocked into the water.

  <p key="7f7ddcef-1ec7-48f1-8026-9b38d19bac25">
   Mari later awoke in the hospital with Chuck by her side, who assured her that Firestorm and The Flash had successfully saved Monument Point. Watching the television, Mari learned that the Fire Totem had been stolen from the Detroit Museum. After recovering, Mari tracked down a street thug named
   Drake
   to find out about the Museum heist. After interrogating Drake, he revealed that while he did not know who did the theft, he did know that it was bankrolled by a rich foreigner from Africa. Breaking into the office of the man who had just claimed the Fire Totem,
   Benatu Eshu
   , Mari was stunned when the man told Mari she looked like her mother.
   She was shocked for a second before the two engaged in a battle that spilled outside the building. Despite her best efforts, Mari was unable to overcome the power of Eshu's Fire Totem and forced to flee.
  </p>
  <p key="459549c9-1d1e-4bc1-bbeb-5991f91f8d38">
   Mari went to Macalester, who recommended that they needed the help of someone who understood the magic behind the totem. Traveling to Africa again, Mari and Macalester met with
   Kuasa
   , who had been hospitalized after her fight with Mari. When Mari asked for identification on Eshu, Kuasa revealed that he was the one who had attacked their village years ago and killed their father. Kuasa revealed that Eshu sought dominance over all things through the use of the Totems and the only way to stop him was to find a totem that counteracted his Fire Totem - namely, the
   Water Totem
   . Kuasa revealed that she knew where the Water Totem was, but would only do so if she could join their fight.

   As the battle continued, Eshu asserted his dominance over Mari, claiming that she was undeserving of the Totem and weak. Determined that she alone was enough to defeat him, Mari used all of her effort to crash Eshu into the river weakening him, managing to take the totem and hand it to Macalester. Eshu proceeded to attack, only for Mari to knock him back into the water with a final powerful kick to the head. Mari proceeded to destroy the Fire Totem. Later, she met up with Oliver, Barry, Laurel, and Ray in
   Coast City
   , who once again needed her help in combating a threat. Oliver expressed slight surprise at her appearance, to which Mari responded it was her responsibility to protect others, whether it was in her city or not.

   Back at the Arrowcave, she apologized to Oliver but he assured Mari it wasn't her fault, as they don't know the source of Darhk's powers. Mari then remembered that similar to how she obtains her powers from the Anansi Totem, every mystical foe she'd faced used a similar object from which they drew power, concluding that Darhk had to have one.

Having earlier heard from the owl spirit Oliver's desire to keep his son close, she suggested that he instead let William go. Mari explained that she grew up in a foster home and never knew her birth parents, but it was ultimately for the best since she had "a real childhood"; Mari realized she wasn't ready to learn the truth about her powers and heritage back then, and believes William shouldn't know about his father's world right now. Oliver was unsure, but Mari meaningfully pointed out how sacrifice is an important aspect of parenthood.

   After Darhk was located at Sky Woods, Mari broke into his compound while Team Arrow took out the

Mari then harnessed the combined spirits of the strongest animals to eventually smash the Khushu Idol into pieces, destroying Darhk's source of magic and negating his powers, allowing Oliver to defeat him.

   When Amaya lost the Anansi Totem to

   , a ripple was sent through time to create a version of history where Mari never received her totem. Thus, she became a hero who set out to try and keep the streets of Detroit safe without any powers. In 2018, Mari went into a burning building to rescue some people trapped inside. In the process though, she was critically injured and sent to the hospital.

     , accepting them as her parents. Nonetheless, Mari had suffered greatly throughout her life from the lack of knowledge of her roots and biological family. She was determined, at times obsessive, to learn about her identity and where she came from.

    Mari was shown to be cautious and distrustful towards strangers; as she was initially wary upon first meeting

     Detroit
     , where she grew up, her "village". Mari also finally referred to Chuck and Patty as "Dad" and "Mom", embracing her identity and destiny.

     Usually, Mari maintained a cool, level-headed temper, but she could also be very rash and impulsive, especially when she thinks someone is being rude, disrespectful, or sexist toward her or other people. Mari is somewhat stubborn and usually didn't want any of the other heroes to help her deal with the problems in her city. However, she was always very willing to help them whenever they need her.
    </p>
    Since becoming a superhero, Mari had warmed up to and become close with
    Team Arrow
    and
    Team Flash
    , to the point of being entrusted with their secret identities. She even willingly traveled to
