   Joe West was born to police officer
   Ben West
   sometime after 1967.
   In adulthood, he followed his father's footsteps and became a police officer in the
   Central City Police Department
   .
   During this time, Ben gifted Joe a watch.
  </p>
  <p key="f91f0cf7-d938-45bf-a6d6-d1f19132a781">
   At some point, Joe met a woman named
   Francine
   , and they fell in love. Eventually, Joe asked Francine's
   father
   if he could marry his daughter, which the man agreed to.
   Joe and Francine were married and on June 24, 1989, they had a daughter,
   Iris
   .
   Whilst raising his daughter, Joe apparently never bought a crib for Iris, preferring to "just plop [her] on some cushions and call it a night."
   Overtime, Joe and Francine's relationship became strained due to the latter's drug addiction.
  </p>
  <p key="805be6a0-a574-44b8-aac8-8f062460ec5b">
   One day around 1995, Joe and his partner got a call to check a house where a young girl said her mother was unconscious. Recognizing the address as his own, Joe rushed to the scene and was horrified to find his wife passed out from a drug overdose and a worried Iris standing in the kitchen, almost burned from the oven catching fire since Francine had left it on. Fortunately, Joe and his partner were able to get Iris to safety and help Francine just in time.
  </p>
  <p key="1ece5653-116c-4f8f-ab5e-a7adf0dab736">
   Joe sent his wife into rehab yet again, but she ran off soon after. He spent weeks searching for Francine, but couldn't find her. Joe then lied to Iris that Francine had died, hoping to spare his daughter from the truth and leave her with a good memory of her mother.
   However, both were unaware Francine was pregnant with
   another child
   when she left them.

   Thirteen years later, Joe was at a crime scene with his partner,
   Detective Chyre

   Central City
   . They discovered it was the work of the Mardon brothers, and after discovering that they'd escaped to one of several farms, they visited each farm. At the last farm, they discovered
   Clyde Mardon
   . He began shooting at them as he ran away, hitting Chyre in the neck. Also, before he could escape, Mardon's plane was blown to pieces by a
   shock-wave

   , Joe's foster son, was struck by lightning, putting him in to a coma. Over the ensuing 9 months, Joe and his daughter,
   Iris
   , began visiting Barry. Eventually Joe's visits became so excessive that his superiors were often annoyed by his lack of commitment to the force, and one day Barry began having uncontrollable seizures despite the fact that he had flat-lined in front of a horrified Joe and Iris. As Iris was too distraught to be in the building, Joe began stressing but was approached by Dr.

   managed to convince him that he had the resources to save him whereas no doctor anywhere else did. Despite knowing that Wells was indeed Barry's best chance, Joe didn't trust Wells and knew something wasn't right about him, yet allowed Wells to take Barry out of desperation to see Barry better.

  <p key="dbaa3ed4-7379-4e32-9e7f-4d9aa6607b3d">
   After Barry woke up from his coma, he ran into Joe back at the police department. He was called to a robbery at
   Gold City Bank
   and later returned with various suspects. They viewed various cell phone recordings, noting the freak storm that picked up inside the bank itself. They also noticed a getaway car, taking note of its partial number plate. Joe later arrived at another crime scene at which

    Barry
   </a>
   and
   Iris
   for being there and became annoyed at the former when he suggested that Mardon was both alive and had gained the power to control the weather. He went on to reiterate that Barry's father was a murder, as had been proven, and it was an obvious fact. This caused Barry to walk off in annoyance. Not long after, more police arrived, including
   Detective Thawne
   , Joe's new partner. Eddie showed Joe the sketch artist's illustration from a suspect, which appeared to be the apparently deceased criminal,
   Clyde Mardon
   . Suspicious that he could've survived, the two went to Mardon's old farmhouse, where they found him. However, before they could arrest him, he knocked them away with the wind and began to create a tornado around himself, proceeding to move it outside. Joe carried an unconscious Eddie outside by their car while they were powerless against Clyde Mardon. As a piece of debris flew through the air, it almost hit them, however, it was intercepted by

    Barry
   </a>
   with his super speed. Barry soon unraveled the tornado, and before Mardon could shoot Barry, Joe shot Clyde first. The following morning, Joe discussed Barry's powers with him and further apologized for not believing him, admitting that Barry's stories of a man in a blur of lightning killing his mother were likely true. He had Barry promise not to tell Iris about any of his powers.
  </p>
  <p key="8ccdf312-1418-4cf0-9a2e-915ca8ba3df4">
   Joe called Barry to a crime scene which he was supposed to be at. At the scene, Barry surveyed the footprints, comparing them to Captain Singh's, embarrassing himself. Back at the precinct, Joe scolded Barry for embarrassing not only himself, but also Joe and the captain. Barry attempted to apologize, putting it down to a lot of stress from recent events, and Joe mentioned how he related to all of it. He went on to assure that Barry hadn't told Iris anything, which he hadn't, so Joe sent him up to his lab to process evidence from the crime scene. After gunmen attacked an event at which Iris and Barry had been at, Joe was on the scene.
  </p>
  <p key="3e4fc885-2dae-4c3d-8979-c535bf21d755">
   Realizing that Barry had tried to use his super speed, Joe walked off to talk to Barry, scolding him for trying to be a hero, telling him that he wasn't bulletproof (a fact that he had to confirm at first). He also suggested that Barry make better excuses than fainting, or Iris would become suspicious. Later that night, Joe discovered Barry's investigation of his mother's murder behind a map. He headed to S.T.A.R. Labs where he found Barry. He tried to talk Barry out of what he was doing by scolding him, though Barry was adamant that Joe had absolutely no power over him, not to mention that they weren't even technically related. Joe was upset, expressing his hope that they found out the unknown before someone was killed by it, and then left.
  </p>
  <p key="53059bcd-64ef-46fb-b3b7-76f8f930c3d5">
   At work, Joe brought him some DNA samples of the shooters from
   Simon Stagg
   's benefit to Barry to process. Barry hoped to see Simon Stagg with Joe, though he told Barry to stay and do his job. Joe left with Eddie Thawne to visit Stagg. They questioned him about various lawsuits against him, including one from
   Danton Black
   , though Stagg assured them that Danton was nothing more than a clinical researcher, definitely not a killer. When he finished with them, he began to walk off, until they were shot at by the same group from his benefit.
  </p>
  <p key="136acbca-386f-4dee-9e61-427b8e29d9fb">
   As Simon was whisked to safety by Eddie, Joe stuck around long enough to see Danton Black pull off a mask, along with numerous other clones. Barry arrived, taking Joe to safety so he couldn't interfere. Back at the precinct, Joe tried to get Simon to reconsider protective custody, though he assured Joe that he'd upped his security, so if anything he would be happy to see Black coming for him.

    Harrison Wells

   arrived and following a short, snarky exchange between him and Stagg, Stagg left and Joe took Harrison to his office to talk.
  </p>
  <p key="76fa79a6-a4e5-46a0-8cc6-28e13c46875b">
   Joe questioned whether Harrison knew about Barry's abilities during his coma, though he claimed to only have suspicions. Wells went on to describe how Barry had quit their team. However, he was sure that Barry would join before long, though not with the same motivation he once had, doubting himself. After their talk, Joe went to S.T.A.R. Labs to motivate Barry. He quickly saved them from a Danton Black clone that they'd made, and went on to assure Barry that only he could stop meta-humans; the police only had limited resources. He suited up and went to fight Black and despite finding the task impossible, Joe mentioned that Barry himself had shown him that even the impossible was possible.
  </p>
  <p key="6861abd9-7486-46ba-9b70-48ebc0c8fa96">
   After he beat Black, Joe brought pizza to Barry in order to apologize. He revealed how he knew about Barry's attempts to prove his father innocent, and wished to join in the crusade, even if it took them the rest of their lives. He apologized for acting like his father, despite not being his actual father, though Barry confirmed that he really was, after all he'd taught him practically everything growing up.
  </p>
  <p key="f383c5f0-56e7-4f7b-b7b4-0a0fe7599bea">
   Some days following, Joe and Barry walked through the precinct as Barry took the credit for the capture of a man the night before. Joe assured him that keeping his abilities a secret was precedence. They walked on up to Barry's lab where Joe brought out the evidence from Barry's mother's murder case. Joe promised to take his time going through the evidence, refusing to quit until they found evidence proving Barry's father innocent. Before they could begin searching, Eddie interrupted, alerting them to a murder the night before of the entire Darbinyan crime family. At the crime scene, Barry was able to identify gas inhalation as the cause of death. They figured that it had to have come from inside, but found no canisters. Barry jokingly suggested that the gas had a mind of its own, causing Joe to send Eddie off for them to talk. Barry went in to depth on how he believed it to be a meta-human, while Joe suggested that they get "backup". They left to S.T.A.R. Labs where the team frantically became excited over the prospect of the meta-human.
  </p>

   Joe brought up the problem of putting meta-humans in to a regular prison, which led to Cisco suggesting they use the particle accelerator below them. They went to check the accelerator out and Detective West headed home. He went over the Allen case, watching footage from Henry Allen's questioning. Iris overheard and Joe simply passed it off as misfiled work. Eddie then arrived, under the guise of wanting to re-canvas the earlier crime scene, much to Joe's pride, and they soon left for the scene. That night Barry visited Joe for help with the meta-human. Joe attempted to help, but the conversation quickly led to Barry thinking of breaking his father out with his super speed. Despite the ease of it, Joe reasoned that often there would be some people Barry could not save, Barry's dad included. Finally, Joe went to visit Henry. He apologized for having disbelieved Henry, mentioning that he planned to re-open the murder case.

Joe soon came back to life and Barry ran off to stop The Mist. While in the hospital, Joe thanked Barry for saving his life. Iris and Eddie approached, causing Barry to leave. The couple hesitantly admitted that they were in fact in a relationship, but Joe simply explained that he had known all along, being the detective he was. He also promised not to shoot Eddie, because Iris liked him so much.

After Barry told Captain Singh his analysis of the robbery, Joe told Barry that he was slow on his improvising. He was then helped by Barry on identifying Leonard Snart who Joe notes is the son of a former corrupt cop.

At the train station where they located Snart, Joe told Eddie to stay and wait for back up but was reminded that they are partners. Joe later apologized to Iris, admitting he was wrong about Eddie after he saved his life. Joe then became more supportive of the two.

Joe explained to Harrison what happened at the scene and claimed the explanation of a yellow and red blur was similar to when Barry saved a child the night before. Joe then believed that the man had similar powers and asked if someone existed with Barry's powers at the time of the murder.

Joe later brought Harrison a bottle of bourbon, apologizing for accusing him after learning about Harrison's wife who died in a car crash. Back at his home, Joe crossed off Wells for possible suspects before the "lightning man" arrived and stole all data and placed a knife on a picture of Iris, threatening if he does not stop, his daughter would die.

   Joe entered S.T.A.R. Labs and asked those there why his clothes had changed to a style reminiscent of the 1940's; he then realized that everyone had clothes from different eras. When Iris arrived, Joe smiled and complimented her as even Iris's hair and make-up changed to 1970's style.

   Joe told Barry that the Forces are Barry's "unexpected children", just as

   (under the guise of Harrison Wells) who noted that doubt was what kept Barry from realizing his true potential; and Barry cannot believe in himself if Joe, the man who acted as his surrogate father, has no faith in him. This led to Joe acknowledging that there are things and limits to what everyone can do and that Barry is no longer the boy he protected since childhood.
  </p>
  <p key="8c449318-effc-4642-bc2a-1737acc8ab2c">
   Joe is known to let his job as a police detective blind him, like after

   was murdered, he willingly believed the idea that his good friend,
   Henry Allen
   was a murderer, when he should have realized that Henry would never kill his wife, no matter what the situation was, 14 years after the fact, Joe finds out that Henry is in fact innocent and goes to visit his friend in jail for the first time since he had been incarcerated, he admits to Henry that he feels ashamed for not believing in his friend's innocence. He apologized to his friend, but Joe was hurt when Henry was cold to him. However, he knows he deserves it for not believing in his friend's innocence and tell Henry he now believes he is innocent and vowed to get him out sooner or later.

   Joe can sometimes be stubborn, like when Barry told him that
   Clyde Mardon
   was alive and that he had gained the power to control the weather, even when there was some evidence to back up Barry's statements, he still refused to believe Barry, only to find out the hard way that his foster son was right. Despite his stubbornness, Joe is not above apologizing or admitting when he is wrong.

  <p key="4579ce5a-4236-4066-8a58-bcb119ffbe86">
   Joe seems to hold grudges, as when the
   Harrison Wells
   from Earth-2 showed up, Joe didn't trust him and constantly insulted him for the actions that weren't even from his Earth-1 counterpart, it wasn't until he realized that Harry was willing to do anything for his daughter (much like Joe with Barry, Iris and Wally) that Joe stopped comparing Earth-2 Harry to

   , as a result, the two started to form a trusting friendship based on their love for their children. Over the next two years Joe and Harry's friendship has remained as strong as ever. During their war against
   Clifford DeVoe
   , Joe became concerned for Harry's well being when he became addicted to his
   Thinking Cap
   and when he started losing his intelligence because of it, assured him that Team Flash would help him get it back.

   When Clifford DeVoe went to the police station saying that Barry was harassing him Joe had gone with Barry made him know that Barry was conducting the necessary investigation so he knew that DeVoe was lying and he kept thinking that DeVoe was not the metahuman they were looking for nor did he tell him Devie that DeVoe was lying.

  <p key="91cf5947-4d7f-4880-ab14-20faaa8412e2">
