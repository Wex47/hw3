   doing some sit-ups in pajamas in tune with an exercise video. She then heads to the bathroom to brush her teeth.
   Ray
   knocks on her door and pushes his way inside, talking rapidly about a project for
   Queen Consolidated
   involving supplying free energy to the city through cogeneration. Felicity makes coffee and sits down to listen to Ray. Someone else knocks on her door and, much to Felicity's surprise, it's her mother,
   Donna
   , who excitedly screams and hugs Felicity. Donna had texted Felicity that she was paying a visit, but forgot to hit "send" on the message, much to Felicity's annoyance. Donna then sees Ray and introduces herself, exclaiming that she bought one of his watches. Ray gives her his own watch, a prototype of a more advanced version. Felicity sends Ray out, embarrassed by the situation.
