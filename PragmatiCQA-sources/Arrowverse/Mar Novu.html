However, one confirmed truth of Nash was that Novu had protected the walls securely by fusing it with Eternium, which rendered Barry's intangibility useless and prevented any brute-force impact attempts less all of Earth-1 be destroyed. Either way, Nash is able to persuade Team Flash to help him fight against the Monitor and he then succeeds in overcoming the Eternium defenses Novu had erected.

   He later had Lyla instruct Laurel to retrieve the antimatter weapon that Oliver was planning to build to oppose him and having knew that Laurel could very well not betray Oliver and sell out Lyla, which was his plan in the first place, had Lyla knock them out.

While the heroes took this to mean that Novu was wrong, everything that he had told Barry in the time vault was true: a version of the Flash had to die for billions to survive, and that it was the sacrifice of Flash-90, not any actions that Barry had taken, that ensured Barry's survival.

Before Novu went to the dawn of time, he attempted to contact Xneen with no response; he was confronted by Lex Luthor who planned to time travel for himself, but Supergirl and Ryan Choi stopped him. Novu found his wife unconscious and was convinced not to travel back in time by the two paragons. This was believed to stop the Crisis, only to find out that an alternate Mar Novu time-traveled, releasing the Anti-Monitor.

   When dealing with his allies, Novu can be outright strict, harsh and firm both in the execution of his plans and the secrets he keeps, going to lengths to keep Team Flash from trying anything to change Barry's fate to die in the crisis, even destroying Nora's message and the plinth that showed the newspaper along with it, despite how it deprived Barry and Iris of what was left of their connection to Nora, before proceeding to coldly and firmly drive it home through Barry that no matter how hard he tries, he will die sacrificing himself to stop the crisis,
   and despite his sympathy for Oliver's sacrifice, he would still strictly demand Oliver's dedication to any mission he assigned him to without revealing anything to him, both when he had him search for the dwarf-star particles and collect Robert Wong. In addition, when Oliver meddled with the fate of
   <a href="Earth-2.html" key="8c91abba-2248-4b14-8def-c2652a9b109f" title="Earth-2">

   , Novu coldly scolded him for not heading his orders and ordered him never to disobey him again. He also dismissed Lyla's sympathy for Laurel despite moments before showing some somberness at Earth-2's destruction with yet another cold reminder that countless more like the ones Laurel cared for would perish if the crisis is not averted.
  </p>
  <p key="0ecbf24c-2f30-4168-99ee-38ae2e2c8197">
   However, Novu's actions, while ruthless, are not for malevolent purposes and instead to prepare for the crisis to find the heroes capable of saving the multiverse from the crisis, which Novu openly acknowledges to being far more powerful than himself, showing he could still feel fear.
   His confidence do not make him truly arrogant, being fully capable of respecting others, as he openly acknowledged to be impressed by the capabilities of the heroes of Earth-1 and Earth-38, and remaining calm even in the face of insults, as he was utterly unfazed when Oliver coldly told him he wasn't a god, merely saying that as there isn't a name to what he is, a god would do and then when Laurel insulted him, along with also being quite flexible when the situation has truly garnered his respect and impress,  as after seeing how persistent Earth-1 was against his test and how brave and self-sacrificing Oliver was, Novu ultimately decided that Earth-1 would be the earth to fight for the fate of all universes and gave Oliver the metaphysical arrow needed to save his friends from the test after Oliver revealed Barry and Kara are the best chances to stop the crisis and not him, although he asked that Oliver provide whatever the multiverse requires to survive the Crisis in order to maintain the balance of the universe by creating another change in place of Barry and Kara being saved.

   In addition, Novu isn't entirely without empathy, as he did have cause to show genuine sympathy towards Oliver and

   fatherless, assuring them he meant no harm for Felicity and their child and Oliver's sacrifice would allow them to live, and sincerely apologizing to Oliver for his inevitable death,
   nor is he so tactless as to callously shrug off things he did that emotionally hurt people or discriminate them for holding on to their flaws, even able to apologize and compliment on said flaw, as he noted that destroying Nora's message was not something he was fond of doing and was unfortunate but necessary as well as Barry's fate being set to die saving the multiverse and openly acknowledged its boundlessness to be his greatest quality despite deeming it to be a flaw on the Crisis.
   In addition, he was also generous and decent enough to reward Oliver's acceptance of his fate by allowing him to meet his children and would later reward Laurel for remaining loyal to Oliver by allowing her to say goodbye to

   Upon seeing Oliver fight to his last breath against the
   Shadow demons
   to save as many people of
   Earth-38
   as possible, Novu was left amazed by his heroics and for the first time since meeting the heroes, horror, as the way Oliver died wasn't the one he had foreseen.
   He was also capable of love and regret, as he had a family that he described as meaning everything for him and when they died, he felt enormous grief and regretted not showing them enough love.
   He also proves himself to be honorable, as he would keep the end of his deal to Felicity to reunite her with Oliver in a possible future, despite having no actual reasons to do so and before doing this, he warned her that she can never return.

    and was later able to appear before Laurel the moment she set her eyes forward.
    When he came to visit Oliver, he purposefully let Oliver sense his presence by causing the noise of opening the door of his house but Oliver was not able to follow his movements, being unable to see him the first time he set his eyes forward and having to turn backwards to lure Novu.

    As Mobius grows stronger, Novu grows weaker. This is because they are polar opposites; as such, it stands to reason that if one of them grows stronger than the other should grow weaker. The cause is that the energy created when the anti-matter wave collides with matter makes the Anti-Monitor stronger and therefore; making Novu weaker.
